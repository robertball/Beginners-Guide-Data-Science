Absolutely delicous!!! My husband loved it!!!! I did as some others suggested and bought the pre-sliced beef stir fry strips to make it a little quicker. The ony other thing I did was sliced my green peppers into strips instead of chopping them. I would definitely recommend adding the peppers when the dish is almost done though because they get really mushy and if you like crisper peppers I would add them last.

Don't be fooled by the name.  This is not a traditionally prepared Chinese Pepper Steak but it is very good nonetheless.  In addition to seasoning the beef with garlic powder, I added red pepper flakes and fresh minced garlic to the crock pot.  Also, I suggest adding the green pepper during the last couple of hours of cooking so that they maintain a crispy texture (I added mine at the beginning and they were very mushy).  Finally, I added a tablespoon or so of cornstarch (mixed with cool water) just before serving.  This created a wonderful gravy that was perfect over rice.

This recipe was DELICIOUS and sooooo easy to make! My grocery store had pre-sliced "Beef For Stir-Fry" on sale, so I substituted that for the sirloin and it turned out fantastic (it also saved alot of time and effort not having to slice the meat myself)! I followed the recipe exactly and it was done after about 6 hours on low... the meat was super tender and almost falling apart! The sauce was a little bit thinner than I like, so I took another tablespoon of cornstarch and mixed it in a small bowl with a little bit of the sauce, then dumped it back into the crockpot and mixed it up real well. Then I let it cook on low for another 30 minutes and this thickened the sauce up perfectly! I served it over steamed white rice and then served the leftovers the next day with mashed potatoes -- both were YUMMY! My husband and I really loved this recipe and I'll definitely be making it again!

This was easy and delicious!  Will definitely be a keeper in my recipe box.  I added a couple cloves of chopped garlic and a few dashes or Worcestershire sauce.  Like all the other reviews, the peppers were soft, but I love them that way.  For crisper peppers, add at the end.

Great recipe. Good change from your typical crock pot recipe with cream of anything soup.  Definitely put the peppers in at the end. I will double the sauce next time. The only change I made was I did not add salt. 7/7/08-This is so wonderful  I did triple the sauce this time-3 cans of tomatoes and triple bouillon/water mixture. I decreased the soy sauce to 7 TBSP. I did not add any salt. You need to make it.

This is very similiar to a recipe I have been making for years that my kids affectionately call Mommy Slop.  As in "what's for dinner? Mommy Slop!"  I don't use cornstarch, and use brown sugar instead of white, also I add more onion, soy sauce and worstershire sauce.  Then I cook and add the seasonings to taste.

Absolutely delicious! My husband and I along with our 5 year old and 17 month old LOVED it. Very tasty over egg noodles and also rice! Will definitely make it again. But my advice is: 1) Use fresh garlic instead of powder and 2) Don't put green peppers in until the last hour of cooking.

This is part of my regular fall/winter rotation.  I find it is best to put the peppers in during the last hour of cooking, so they aren't dissintegrated.  Also, I find that I need additional cornstarch at the end (when I add the peppers) to make the sauce thicker.

i made this last yesterday and served it on garlic mashed potatoes just to try something different and it was delicious...the pepper steak was a bit too salty for me so I think next time I will only use two tbsp of soy sauce or ommit the teaspon of salt, other than that I loved it

One of the best recipes from this site that we have tried. Hubby, kids and granddaughter absolutely love it! I followed the recipe pretty close, only making a few minor changes to use what was on hand. I used probably closer to 2 1/2 pounds of sirloin completely trimmed of any fat, a whole large vidalia onion, 4 bell peppers (1 each green, red, orange and yellow) and low sodium soy sauce. I also did not add the peppers in the beginning with the the other ingredients. I waited until approx. 2 hours before serving. They were very tender but not mushy. Served over Jasime rice. The meat is so tender it just melts in your mouth and the flavor is excellent. Simple, hearty, comfort food. This will be added to our "favorites file". Thanks for sharing!

I was nervous about this but it was a big hit...Nothing left in the crock pot when dinner was over...I fed 4 men and they kept dipping the serving spoon back in the pot!!!  I took the following suggestions from others:  2 cans beef broth instead of bouillon, 1 green and 1 red pepper, 1 clove fresh garlic, double the soy sauce (I used light), leave out the salt, add worcestire and plenty of it, add the peppers in the last hour.  Add more cornstarch or flour while cooking for thickness.  And I think 3 to 4 hours on low is plenty.  I'm sure I'll be asked to make this again :)

Such an easy, versatile recipe which can be customized to each family's personal likes and dislikes.  I often add pineapple, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, carrots, or whatever I have in the fridge that might complement it.  My only recommendation would be to use fresh minced garlic instead of the powdered garlic and low sodium soy sauce vs the regular soy sauce to reduce the saltiness of the dish. Thanks MJWagner68 for the submission.

The meat was tender and good but overall, this was very salty!  I would suggest leaving out the salt since the boullion provides enough on its own.

I wish I had read other reviews first.  After cooking 7 hours on low, mine did turn to mush, but I loved the flavor so much that I will attempt this one again.  It wasn't necessary to brown the meat first.  I did make it again, and loved the changes I made:  used 1 cup water, 1 bouillon, and 2 Tbl. cornstarch.  Cooked the meat and spices (no onions and peppers yet) for 3 1/2 hours.  Added the onions and peppers, then cooked for another 1 1/2 hour to 2 hours.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I believe the nutrition data for this recipe was calculated on the basis that lean sirloin beef is used. Out of curiosity I recalculated it for a fatty sirloin, and it comes out high calorie, high trans fats, and high cholesterol. It's important to be aware that for a healthy meal, lean beef is needed.  Give a miss to the fattier cuts and avoid having it deposited around your waistline :-)

This recipe is fantastic--it is now an established favorite at our house.  I use whatever beef is cheapest.  I have also made this a convenience food by browning the seasoned beef and freezing it along with the onion and pepper strips.  The morning I want to make it I dump the frozen ziplock of goodies in with the rest of the ingredients and turn the crockpot on!  I also never add the salt and use reduced sodium soy sauce and we don't miss it at all.

I have been making this recipe now for a couple of years & it is one of my favorites.  Changed very little.  Browned top round steak in olive oil, doubled all the sauce ingredients, added 2 packages of Hungry Jack Brown Gravy mix, and only added about 1/4 of the peppers at the beginning for flavor(otherwise they get too mushy).  Added the rest 1 1/2 hours before the end.  Cooked on low for 6 hours and comes out perfect and delicious every time.  Best served over egg noodles tossed with olive oil , onion powder and parsley flakes.

Although not exactly the traditional pepper steak ...I really liked this recipe, add the peppers and onions about 2 to 3 hours from being done, otherwise they turn out mushy.  I also cut out the extra tspn of salt...really not needed.  Aside from that I cut out the garlic powder and used 3 cloves fresh garlic and a 1/2 tspn of ground ginger.  This is a keeper...thanks for the recipe.

This was fantastic.  The steak just melts in your mouth it is so tender.  I followed some other reviews and added the peppers and onions the last 2 hours of cooking.  I served it over brown rice.  Also for my 2 yr old I put some pineapple tidbits into it.  To get some fruit into him and to help it cool quicker for him....he gobbled it right up!  I will definately be making this again!

This was delicious. I couldn't keep from sampling the sauce.

Although browning the meat and making the broth is a hassle, I would still be willing to make this again.

I used very lean pre-tenderized stew meat, which is about a dollar more at the supermarket than non-tenderized stew meat, but less expensive than sirloin tips.

This meat could have been more tender, but was not bad at all-- similar to the pepper steak in most Chinese restaurants. 

I added liberal amounts of garlic powder, black pepper, and cayenne pepper (as I like spicy dishes).

I also added some diced white onion that I had on hand, as well as cooking sherry and green onion, cut into 1-2 inch pieces.

I agree with the cook who suggested doubling the sauce ingredients. The sauce didn't seem thick enough with the cornstarch, although this is a problem I usually have. I ended up using 3 Tbsp., which works out to 1+1/2 Tbsp. if you do not double the sauce. At that point it worked out well. Finally, I used powdered Au Jus mix rather than bouillion cubes.

Next time, I would cut the stewed tomatoes so that the pieces wouldn't be so large.

As a note to those on a low-sodium diet: this dish  is quite salty (although fine for my tastes). Perhaps one could use low sodium soy sauce and beef bouillion and half the amount of salt added?

This is something I will cook up again for busy school nights. As per some reviews, the only changes I made were to add the peppers on the fourth hour out of six in the crock pot (on low) and they were perfect, and 30 minutes before done, I  turned the crock pot to high and added 1 tbsp of corn starch well mixed into 1/2 cup of hot water which gave me a thicker sauce - served on white rice. I mentionned at the table that next time, I would add some pineapple and everyone agreed that it would really be good, so I'll try it next time, but overall, it took 5 minutes to prepare and was very good... for me, it's a keeper!

I hate to be in the minority but my husband and I did not think this was anything special.  Not extremely flavorful.  Perhaps using red wine instead of the water would help.  I doubt I'll make this again.

I LOVED this recipe.  For my dish, I replaced the powdered garlic with 4 cloves of fresh garlic. I minced my garlic and sauted with 2 tbls of Butter. I browned the meat in the garlic/butter sauce. I used 1 tbls of Soy, and 3 tbls of Worchester. I didn't add any salt.  I used a 1 green, 1 red and 1 orange bell pepper added 1 hour before finished. Next time I will use 4 peppers.  I also added 1tsp of crushed red pepper for some kick.  I wound up using 3 tbls of cornstarch and substituted the bullion cube and water for one 10oz can of beef broth.

This dish was delicious, it will definitely go in my rotation.  I served with Basmati Rice and sweet cornbread.

Great taste! After 6 hrs, the meat was so tender it was almost melting (not so great on presentation, though). Maybe I sliced my sirloin way too thin...Other than that, I used worcesteshire sauce instead of soy, and browned my meat with some fresh garlic. Instead of boullion & water, I used 1.5 cans of beef broth. I added my peppers & onions for the last 2 hrs. and they were still too tender for my taste. Next time I'll add them for the last hr.

This recipe was wonderful. I highly recommend it. The steak was so tender that you could cut it with a fork. I did double the liquid in the recipe to make more sauce and used 3 Tbs. of cornstarch to thicken it. I added half the peppers at the beginning and the other half the last half hour. YUMMMY!!!

This is soo much better the next day when it's had time to set.  I added the green peppers halfway also cause of the other reviews.   I added some tabasco at the end cuase it needed a kick.  Also since the sauce was so soupy when it was done I added more cornstarch.  That night I wasn't sure if I like the reciepe.  The next day while I was preparing the leftovers I loved how the gravy had thickend and it was soo good over rice.  My recommendation is to make this the night before then put it in the refrigerator and eat it the next day.

Very tasty.  I will make again.  It was a little time consuming to brown the meat before putting in the crockpot but once in, it made dinner prep easy that evening.  I did as others suggested and doubled the sauce ingredients for additional gravy.  I tried it over brown rice and Angel Hair Pasta (all I had).  We preferred the pasta so next time I'll get egg noodles.  I used 3 cups beef broth (double recipe) with 2T cornstarch rather than the bouillon as suggested and doubled all gravy ingredients + added 1/2 t. of cayene pepper.  At the end I thickened it again with 2T cornstarch in cool water as others suggested.  Hubby & daughter liked it.

I have always hated green peppers but I decided to make this "for something different".  I am so happy I did!  It was so delicious.  I served it over white rice with glazed sugar snap peas and carrots. It was, without a doubt, one of the best meals I have made in a long time.   I used diced tomatoes instead of stewed.  I also added a few shakes of Worcestershire sauce.   You can't go wrong with this one!

Much too heavy on the salt. I think the soy sauce is the culprit. That stuff is a sodium bomb and it can take over any recipe where it's an ingredient. 

I've made almost this same recipe for years on the stove top. The only difference between the two recipes is that the one I use (copied from a 1960s magazine at the library) calls for 2 teaspoons of Worcestershire rather than 3 tablespoons of soy sauce. 

I tried making the recipe with soy sauce in the amount called for here, and got nothing but complaints about the salt.

Anyway, you could try substituting 2 teaspoons of Worcester for the soy sauce if you find this version too salty. If if then turns out not salty enough for your taste, more Worcestershire, soy sauce, or salt can be added at the table.

This is a great simple dish. I added 1 green & 1 red pepper in the last hour of cooking, next time I may add them in the last 30 min. of cooking. I also used sandwich steak, which was sirloin cut up, just made the process easier. I made it the night before, on a busy weekday, came home from work, made some mashed potatoes, and greenbeans, and we were ready to eat in no time. Tip: if you make the night before and have a cat, cover the dish as it cools, my cat gave this dish a thumbs up too ;)

This was very tasty. I did not have stewed tomatos, so used diced tomatos with garlic, onion and basil (all I had in the house)...turned out fine. Next time I will add a couple of cloves of garlic.

I made half this recipe and served it over jasmine rice for a very good dinner.  I used top sirloin steak and cut it into thin strips. After browning the meat, I couldn’t let all those nice browned bits stay behind in the pan, so I deglazed my pan with the tomatoes (I used diced rather than stewed), loosening all that good flavor, and then added it to the slow cooker.  I also added a big clove of minced garlic.  I used a mix of green, red, yellow and orange peppers and added them two hours before the end of the cooking time.  I also added another 1/2 T. corn starch mixed with a little water about 30 minutes before the end of the cooking time to help give the sauce a little more body.  I would make this again, but I think I’d cut back on the cooking time as I think it may not need 6-8 hours on low.  I also would add the peppers about 90 minutes before the end of the cooking time so they would be a bit more crisp tender.

This was AMAZING! I don't normally like steak unless it is super tender and this was just perfect! You can buy a cheap steak and get it so tender in the slow cooker! I followed the recipe pretty closely, however I didn't cook anything in the pan before I put it in the slow cooker, I just didn't have time. So I threw everyhthing together in the slow cooker and it came out perfectly. I did take the advice of other reviews and put the peppers in for the last 45 minutes or so. It was SO GOOD!

This is a really great recipe! Don't be fooled by the name, I thought at first "pepper" meant spicy, but it doesn't. It's a very flavorful dish and extremely easy to put together. The leftovers can be frozen and thawed later too. Definitely give it a try.

My family is already requesting that I make this again. Everybody loved this recipe. Since I had about three pounds of meat, I doubled the sauce portion and I'm glad I did because it was wonderful to have enough sauce to accomodate the rice I served this over. I did as others suggested and added the green peppers about half way through the coooking time. The meat was easily cut with just a fork it was so tender. I will be adding some pepper next time as I think it was needed and I will probably omit the salt. The soy sauce alone would have made it salty enough. So very yummy! Thank you for submitting this recipe.

Oh I also wanted to add that I think browning/searing the meat is very important to keep the flavor inside. To save time in the morning I do my meat the evening before and also cut all my veggies so I can put this together real fast

OMGoodness, this pepper steak melts in your mouth delicious.  We rarely have company since we live out in the **boonies** but when we do, it's the one I definitely choose.  It is designed for hearty appetities, and never ever disappoints. I give this dish a rating of **10+**.

Made this on the stove-top and it was awesome.  I used 2 vidalia onions since we love onions around here.  I also used flank steak which I marinated in a little orange juice, garlic and pepper for a couple of hours before browning (just dry it off first or it will steam instead of brown).  Browned the meat, removed it, sauted the onion and green pepper then deglazed with the liquid (I used beef base instead of boullion).  Covered and cooked on very low about 4 hours.  Meat was tender and delicious.  Served over rice.

Suffers from "Pot Roast-itis". This one (and just about any slow-cooker beef recipe...see my slow cooker Italian Beef review on here...same darn thing) just DOES NOT taste like it's namesake. it mostly comes out to the same thing: a variation on a pot roast.

Now, all that said, of all the "slow cooker beef" recipes I have cooked from Allrecipes or ATK's book, this one did the best at hiding the symptoms of Pot Roast-itis. I love pot roast, just not when it creeps into recipes that aren't supposed to taste like it.

That said, this stuff is delicious...it just is not what is promised/expected. It's very edible (I did the late addition of the peppers, highly recommended...however I wish I would have used half green and half red for that added visual flair. Hot pepper flakes were a worth addition as well).

I want to give this four stars for it's good balance, but at the same time it is so disappointing if you've had "real" pepper steak...so I gave it three. 

Have historically had great luck with Allrecipes 4.5 - 5 star recipes, but lately I have been picking some real duds. I guess the commonality is slow cooked beef!

Anyhow, next time this stuff is going to be made the proper way...fresh, QUICK and in a WOK!

This dish was pretty good.  The meat was unbelievably tender which surprised me.  It definitely doesn't taste like the Pepper Steak you would get at a Chinese restaurant, but it is really good.  I added minced garlic and some dried ancho chilies for a little more of a kick, and I also seasoned my meat with garlic pepper in addition to the garlic powder.   It seemed to be lacking something, though.  I think next time I will try to add some mustard seed or something like that.  Thanks for recipe!!

It was pretty good, but I didn't like how limp the bell pepper became.**** Made this again Jan '05 after reading a bunch of the reviews.  Added two bell peppers (red and green) 45 minutes before we ate, and they didn't get soft or mushy, they were perfect.  This was very easy and tasty!  Served over brown rice.

This is fantastic.  A family favorite for sure.  I've tried cooking it by adding the peppers late so they are a bit firm and throwing them in at the beginning.  The flavor is far superior when they are thrown in at the start - they add a lot of flavor and tenderness to the meat.  I used STEW MEAT which saves $$.  Just trim it against the grain and proceed  Absolutely will melt in your mouth.  Bon Apetite!!

I used regular diced tomatoes, not stewed, doubled the bouillon-water-cornstarch, added about a tsp reduced sodium Worcestershire, and added the peppers the last hour of cooking.  I served this over brown rice.  With these few changes it tasted just like my dad's old recipe - exactly what I was looking for.  I'm writing this one down so it never gets lost.  Thank you so much MJWAGNER 68

Oh, this was good!  I didn't get the beef in time to put it in the slow cooker, so I did it on the stovetop.  My family really, REALLY liked it.  I added about a teaspoon or so of Red pepper flakes just to give it a bit of a kick.  This is going into the rotation for sure.

Really great way to have tender beef. I loved it. I have a note for JohnnyD....You can use a dutch oven to make this in your oven or you can use a really big frying pan on your stove top. You won't cook it for hours but you can simmer if for a couple. After your beef is browned, saute your onions and peppers then follow the rest of the recipe and put everyone back in the pan and let it go. Don't lift that lid, just let it go. Hope that helps...Rosie

This was great! They were actually out of top sirloin at Whole Foods, but the butcher (and another customer) said that chuck roast is really all I need for a slow cooker (the customer thought that top sirloin would be overkill). The meat turned out fantastic: very tender and flavorful. The only drawback to using chuck roast, though, is that it tends to be pretty fatty so if you're picky like me you'll spend a lot of time trimming the meat while slicing into strips. I added a lot of garlic powder, and it was delicious.

We will make this easy, delicious recipe again. The meat turned out so tender and tasty. Took others advice and changed out the bullion cube for a can of low sodium, fat free beef broth.  Very Good.

Simple meal with a lot of flavor.  I used stew meat instead of sirloin out of convenience and followed some others' advice about adding water and cornstarch, putting in the peppers only for the last hour, and taking out the salt.  I added more seasoning to the meat instead (pepper and seasoned salt).  Since the bell peppers didn't go in right away, I put in two chopped serano peppers at the beginning - the more spice the better for me.  Fresh diced mushrooms also work well with this recipe. Delicious!

wonderful!! i followed others and added half the peppers in at the beginning,then the rest about 1 hr prior to the end, doubled the cornstarch, and omitted the salt. really enjoyed this one over brown rice. wouldn't consider it a chinese dish as others have noted, but def. a comfort food for the cooler weather. this one will go in the recipe box.

This recipe was delicious.  I digressed from the recipe only to use low sodium beef broth and low sodium soy sauce.  The flavors were perfectly balanced; not a hint of over saltiness.  I added the peppers more than half way through the cooking time and a handful of mushrooms and then served all over Dutch egg noodles.  My family loved it.

This recipe was great! My family admitted they didn't think it was going to be good but after one serving they were asking for seconds. I didn't have steak so I used Chicken breasts instead. It turned out to be a keeper.

I thought this was very good. I just sprinkled frozen steaks with garlic powder and placed in slow cooker. Then I mixed up bouillon, water, cornstarch, soy sauce, sugar, salt, tomatoes and onion and poured over steaks.  The peppers get pretty mushy, so if you want them more firm, don't add until a couple hours or so into cooking time.  I just cut up steak into strips before serving over rice.

A good, non-rich solid recipe. I added red pepper flakes, worcestershire sauce, black pepper and red wine vinegar--just a bit of all of them about an hour before it was done. Otherwise, this recipe is a bit bland. DEFINITELY hold off on the peppers till the last 30 minutes--I'm not a huge fan of SUPER crispy veggies, I like them to have the flavor of what they're in, but I don't like them so soft I could gum them if I didn't have teeth. We added one green bell pepper, one red bell pepper 45 mins. before it was done and it was just a touch too soft. Try 30 minutes.  We served with jasmine rice and we all liked it a lot -- no cartwheels, but lots of pleasurable 'mmmmmmm's when eating.

i know i am in the minority...but i was very disappointed in this recipe.  perhaps i cooked it too long...but it just tasted like a mushy stew to me and my husband.  both the meat and the peppers had lost all their texture and flavor after cooking for 6 hours on low.

This is a very good recipe.  I save some of the green pepers and add them in later to have some color.  Cooks up quickly, I've tried it without browing the meat and I didn't see a difference.
Great over egg noodles.

We..loved..this!! worked perfectly for a Sunday evening dinner. The only sub I made was I didn't use sirloin, I used round steak seasoned with Cajun seasoning instead of just garlic powder, and I had no bullion cubes so I used a half a can of beef broth I had in the pantry and doubled the corn starch. Served it over rice with a nice crusty bread...HEAVENLY! Thank you for posting this.

This was good, but growing up my Mom made this dish,  but a little different. She would marinate the sirloin in BEER yum!!!!! Then add to the gravy mixture;-0 I added the tomatoes then after thinking about it scooped them out and ended up poor the rest of the can of beer into the crock pot added the red/orange bell peppers onions and garlic later as everyone else suggested served over brown rice and it turned out super yummy. I would make again with the BEER I only got to marinate the meat for about 45 minutes would do longer next time.

Really good and even better on day #2! Instead of using 2 green peppers, I used 1 green pepper and 1 red. I doubled the cornstarch and added 1.5 tsp of red pepper flakes because we like things a little spicy around here. Also, I added my peppers/onions with just 2 hrs remaining so they wouldn't become too soggy. Oh, and I omitted the salt. The soy sauce makes this recipe salty enough.

I skipped the browning (to save calories by not using oil) and instead sprinkled the meat with garlic powder then threw everything in the crock pot except the green peppers.  It didn't seem to make a difference so I would do that again.  I added the green peppers and some frozen broccoli with about 2 hours cooking time left which ended up being perfect.  My husband liked this better than I did so I gave it 4 stars but it was more of a 3 for me.

This is FABULOUS! I doubled the sauce and added the peppers toward the end as some other reviewers did. I added a little extra cornstarch as well, as I like thicker sauces. The only other change I made was to use red and yellow bell peppers instead of green, which is just my flavor preference. Other than that I followed the ingredient list to a T and thought the flavor balance was quite nice. Served this over white rice and thought it was a nice change to the all-too-common creamy crock pot recipes. Will definitely make again and maybe play around with the flavors; use teryaki sauce instead of soy sauce perhaps :)

I followed the directions and in my opinion this is in no way pepper steak. I should have known better. But this would make a very good vegetable beef stew when you add more vegetables.

Made this for dinner tonight was soooo good. I added just 1 tablespoon of soy sauce and that was just right. Did not add salt and didnt need to. I did add a can of Golden Mushroom soup and french onion soup and had lots of sauce along with the stewed tomotoes. I served it over Orzo. I cooked it on High, next time I will cook it on low and cut the meat in larger strips, the meat fell apart to much. I also added the peppers in the last hour and I added some mushrooms. Cant wait to eat the left-overs

This was so good!! I used some petite sirloin I had got on sale and cut into strips. I did add some crushed red pepper and crushed garlic to pot for a little kick! I sauteed the bell pepper in olive oil and garlic and added to pot right before serving over brown rice! Thanks for a great recipe!!

One of my favorite slow cooker recipes! It is perfect over white rice. I skip the browning of the meat and just dump it in the crock pot. Double the sauce and add more cornstarch for a nice, thick gravy. Try using teriyaki sauce instead of soy sauce. YUM!

The previous reviewers were all right on.  My husband LOVED it.  I did add the extra thickening, and I also waited until closer to the end of cooking time to add the peppers.  I used a whole sweet onion and 1 red, 1 yellow and 2 green peppers.  I served it over rice and my husband was very pleased.

YUM, yum, YUM!!!  I followed this recipe exactly and it was quite tasty.  I do recommend not adding the peppers and onions until the last hour because otherwise they will pretty much disappear into the dish.  Also next time I think I will also add a pepper flakes or cayenne because our family likes spicy things and may even add some mushroom wedges.  My son who usually can't stand anything that has steak because "it is too chewy", ate 2 helpings and raved on how the steak just melted in his mouth! VERY good, our family will eat this again!

I think this is a great basic recipe.   It's what you do with it that makes all the difference. I am going to make a double batch tomorrow.  I used broth like others, I  sauteed the onion first because I really like mine almost liquefied. Added the peppers the last hour and turned the slow cooker off.  I was not super impressed with the way the flavor was going, so in that last hour, I added garlic, red pepper flakes, seasoned pepper and cumin.  It turned out more like a fajita stew which was fantastic.  My husband had it over brown rice and I topped a salad with it and a little sour cream.  Delish.  I would have given this recipe 5 stars  if I hadn't altered it so much.  My variation was definitely five stars.  Next time I am going to toss in some mushrooms and some fresh tomatoes at the end.

I made this yesterday. I added a can of mushrooms,used 2 b. cubes and 1 cup of water,5-6 TBLS.soy sauce and 2tsp of sugar. I think the sauce could even be tripled. I did add garlic also. It cooked for 6 hrs on low and it was delicious. I don't think it make 6 servings though, more like 3-4 served over rice. I will make it again. I did wait and add the gr. peppers about 2/3 way through.

I thought that the sauce was rather bland after cooking for 2 hours.  I then added 1 envelope of onion soup mix and that really helped.

VERY tasty. Followed a couple of other cooks suggestions. Did not bother to brown the meat first, doubled the sauce ingredients, put in half a green bell pepper at the start then added additional green along with red and yellow peppers and a can of mushrooms one hour before we ate. Was prepared to add more cornstarch but found it was not necessary. Served over rice. Huge hit with the fam.

I was disappointed in this recipe.  I hoped for more flavor and more color.  THe peppers lost a lot of color (I used green and red).  If you try this, don't add the peppers until the last hour or so or they become complete mush.

This is very good, Next time I make It I will put in some of the green pepper in about half way through and in the last 30-45 min throw in the rest of the pepper, just because we like it a little more crunchy! Thanx

LOVED IT. I used pre-cut strips of beef and tossed in everything but the peppers and onions on low for 7 hrs. I added the peppers/onions in the last hour so they stayed a bit firm. Served over white rice. Divine!

Yum! Making this 2 days in a row was that good. I used roasted garlic instead and seared meat with paprika spices first. I used about 6 cloves of roasted garlic added pepper and chopped up some cocktail tomatoes omitted sugar and salt  added worchestershire  and added more sauce which I thickened with more cornstarch near the end. Was one of best recipes I have tried from this site after I tweaked to my liking.

I came across this recipe on "the recipe of the day" and I am so GLAD I did!  This dish was wonderful and so easy to make.  Its almost foolproof.  I actually used a center chuck roast I had on hand and just cut it up and seasoned it generously with our favorite steak seasonings.  Also added some worcestershire sauce as others suggested.  I didn't have any beef bouillon cubes so I just used a can of beef broth instead.  Added 2 cans of stewed tomatoes due to having 2.50 lbs of beef. Waiting until the last 45min-hour to put in the peppers (used green and red) gave the peppers the perfect crispness to them.  As other reviewers noted you may have to add a little flour towards the end of cooking to thicken up the sauce.  In the end the meal turned out amazing!  We tried the Pepper Steak over both egg noodles and brown rice.  Loved them both...thanks!

Ok,I came home on my lunch break today and took a chance with this recipe and man am I happy I did!!! My 2yr old son cant stop eating it and he is a very picky eater. I followed the recipe with 2 minor changes. I used chuck eye steak and substituted the water for beef broth (I had to use it up lol). Thanks for the great recipe, this is surely a keeper for my family! :

This recipe is very similar to the one my mother used to make. I think hers called for fresh Roma tomatoes vs the stewed ones. I doubled the water, bouillon, cornstarch, soy sauce & sugar but not the salt or tomatoes and it turned out fine. I also added half of the bell pepper in the beginning and the other half during the last hour. This made just the right amount of sauce to serve over brown rice. Definitely a keeper!

Excellent recipe idea!  My personal tweaks are as follows:
spray crockpot with cooking spray
dump in meat (comes precut at my grocery)
season well with lots of garlic powder, some black pepper and generous amount of powdered ginger (this is crucial for authentic peppersteak flavor)
Add 1-2 cans stewed tomatoes, double the soy sauce to 6 tablespoons, skip salt and sugar.
Triple cornstarch to 3 tablespoons mixed into 3/4 cup hot water.  Add while still in suspension.
You can add the onions and peppers (I like large, artistic slices) now or at the end (tastes fine to me either way).
Mix everything up in the crockpot and cook as directed.

I really enjoyed the taste of this recipe.  I did make a few tweaks to it when making it yesterday though.  I didn't bother browning the meat; I added celery; and I kept about half of the peppers out until the last hour (like other reviewers had mentioned).  I also added more cornstarch in that last hour to thicken up the sauce a bit.  I found there was a LOT of sauce, so next time, I'll add more peppers and celery, and maybe add carrots and broccoli as well.  This recipe is being added to my recipe box.
Update:. I made this recipe again a day or two ago, and added about 2 chopped peppers, 2 chopped celery stalks, and bean sprouts about an hour before it was finished.  Loved it!

Great tasting beef crock-pot recipe! I was looking for make-ahead-and-freeze recipes. This one worked out great! I just prepared it the way the recipe reads and then froze the ingredients in a ziplock bag until I was ready to take it out and pop it in the crock-pot on low for 6-8 hours.

Needs more umph!. Will add red pepper flakes and ginger next time like others suggested.  Otherwise excellent base recipe.  I'm from the south and we like things spicy here.

After making this recipe, hubby tells me he doesn't care for pepper steak!  Still, I really enjoyed this recipe and shared some with my parents.  Added one pepper at the start of cooking and another about 30 minutes before serving - got the benefit of both crunch and soft peppers!

I made this for the Allrecipes Allstar's crockpot challenge. For anyone who missunderstands this is not Chinese pepper steak. It is a homestyle pepper steak recipe, which is very different. At first bite, I wasn't sure what to think. When it was done the meat was more tender and the vegetables were more soft than I remember pepper steak being. The liquid was also the consistency of water. To thicken it I decided to add 1 1/2 Tblsp. extra of corn starch, when it was finished, and it worked perfectly. I followed the recipe, execpt I used 1 red and 1 green pepper and low sodium soy sauce. It was already plenty salty between the added salt and the canned stewed tomatoes. I would even cut the regular salt back some. I made jasmine rice to go with it. It wasn't a favorite, but worked fine for dinner tonight.

Good simple recipe although for me not the very best, I used two medium red onions, 8 oz mushrooms. 4 Jalapenos.  Like many other reviewers I did add the peppers right at the end of cooking and they were nice and crunchy.

This had very good flavor using just what the recipe called for.  The only thing I had to do differently was add more corn starch to thicken the gravy, otherwise it was a little watery.

Good, but it's missing something. You could add pineapple in. And I wouldn't put the peppers in until an hour before the end or something because they get mushy. I also added 1/2 c water at least and had to stir the meat before the end so it was all moist.

gave 4 stars only because it is not pepper steak as true pepper steak is most often a stir fry dish. this is more of a chopped steak with peppers dish and it is very good. if you use a good grade of meat it will come out very tender i recommend the extra time and low setting as this really gets the meat done the way it should be

I tried this based on recommendations on the buzz.  It was very good and easy to prepare.  I used precut stir-fry beef strips and used 1 green bell pepper and 1 red bell pepper.  In addition I used no sodium beef bouillon and reduced sodium soy sauce and left out the salt.  Since it had no other asian flavors other than the soy sauce I added 1 tsp minced garlic and 1 tsp ground ginger.  Next time I will add more.  It was very good but did not wow me.  Next time I will add more garlic, ginger, and add a little crushed red pepper.

Well, the picture looked delish, but unfortantely, I followed the directions and cooked it in the slow cooker for 8 hrs on low and the meat dried out - it was REALLY dry.  I also wish I would have read the reviews and followed others advise. I dont know how to remedy dried out meat, but the meat was so pricey, I dont have the heart to just dump the whole meal in the trash. I also put the green peppers in at the beginning & they are terribly soggy. I will try it again, I suppose...but my recommendation would be NOT to cook this for 8 hrs...even on low.

My family really enjoyed this dish; even the 3 year old! Followed the recipe for the most part, but added more seasonings like Tony's and crushed red pepper. Also, adding the peppers and onions in half way through the cooking process does make a huge difference!

My tomatoes were italian stewed, my onion was red, my soya sauce was low sodium as all were what I had on hand... I spiced my beef with salt, pepper and red pepper flakes in addition to the garlic powder just because I'm a rebel... Oh Man, this was a great dish :)

We really enjoyed this!  I really wish I could give it 4.5 stars, because the flavor was really excellent.  The only thing that I did find was that between the beef bullion, soy sauce, and added salt, it was just too salty for our taste.  Next time, I will omit the added salt and see how it turns out.  Otherwise, we really enjoyed it- thanks!

I make this often and it's my husbands favorite. I do wait to add the peppers. The only other difference is that I use my own beef broth - from cooking a brisket in the crock pot - thickened with some cornstarch, - or powdered gravy mix if I don't have any on hand. Served over rice this is a delicious dinner!

We enjoyed.  I doctored it a lot. I was home all day so I kept tasting and adding spices as needed.  Added some peppers early and some near the end.  Not sure if I will make again but I enjoyed trying something new!

Made this last night for the first time.  I followed the other suggestions about adding the peppers towards the end and they turned out perfect.  I put them in and made rice while they were cooking.  I also added about another 1/4 cup of water mixed with corn starch at the same time I added the peppers to thicken a little more.

Very good!  The only thing I added was a red pepper as my family really likes them.  Did everything else as stated and we all enjoyed it.  Even my very picky husband..  thanks for sharing.

Pretty good.  I put the peppers in half way through cooking time to avoid the mushy issue.  Meat was VERY TENDER.

Very tasty!  I made it almost exactly as stated, except I added the green peppers in the last 2 hrs.  Definitely one to make regularly.  The beef was so tender!

Very tasty and super easy. I used cube steak instead of sirloin and added a some sliced mushrooms also. The peppers were definitely mushy after 7 hours so next time I think I'll add them with 2-3 hours left. I served it with pasta but I think it would be better with mashed potatoes.

This was wonderful. It cooked on low for 8 hours and the meat was so great. If you don't like your peppers and onions mushy don't add them until later like the other reviewers suggested. I do like my peppers and onions on the soft side so it was perfect. I did add more garlic powder and sea salt to the recipe. Wonderful! Will make again.

Delicious!  Took the advice of other reviewers and kept the green peppers out of the pot until the last couple of hours, which created the perfect texture (definitely NOT mushy).  Did not saute the beef ahead of time, just dumped it all into the slow cooker.  Will make again!!!

I gave this recipe four stars because I did make some changes based on the suggestions of other reviewers.  I kept the basic recipe the same, but added two generous splashes of worcestershire sauce.  Also, I replaced one green pepper with a red pepper (also cut my peppers into strips).  I used 5 cloves of garlic minced, and 1/2 an onion cut into strips.  Didn't use any oil to brown the beef.  Finally, I added my peppers during the last thrity minutes and 1 tbsp of cornstarch mixed with a small amount of juice from the crock-pot.  I only cooked it for six hours as well.  Sounds like a lot of changes, but they really made the recipe five stars (at least for me)!

Hmmm...not great.  Won't make it again.  tastes nothing like Asian food.  Maybe with some Chinese five spice powder. more garlic, ginger, and some red pepper it would taste a little more like Asian food.  I'm half-Japanese, and just because you add soy sauce to something and serve it with rice, it doesn't make it Asian.  I add soy sauce instead of salt to almost any sauce, and I eat a side of rice almost every day.  That doesn't mean it's Asian food I'm eating...

Don't read this if you don't like it when people make tons of substitutions! I use dry onion soup mix in place of the beef boullion, 3 T flour instead of cornstarch, 2 cups chopped fresh tomatoes instead of canned (yum!), and instead of the soy sauce I do 2 T each of red wine, teriyaki, and worcestershire. Skip the salt & sugar. 5 1/2 hours on low.

I love this dish!! So easy and good especially if you like peppers. I doubled the peppers but kept everything else the same:)UPDATE: I have made this MANY times now and it's still one of our favs from this site. I do add the peppers at the last hour because I want them to have a little crunch and not mushy... LOVE THIS SO MUCH!!

This was very good and the steak was so tender!  I added the peppers and onions in the last hour so they wouldn't be soggy.  Could probably use a full Tbsp of sugar.  I left out the salt but my husband added it back with his serving!  Served over rice and it was great!

I loved this!  I did change it a little bit.  I added about 3 tablespoons of freshly grated ginger. I only had chicken bullion so I used about 1/2 cup of canned beef broth and no hot water.  And it turned out pretty good!  Would make again!

This turned out very well.  I cooked it for 4 hours on high and about 1.5 hours on low.  I did add additional cornstarch to thicken the juice a bit more.  Had I read more reviews before hand, I probably would have put the peppers in after switching to low.  The peppers were mushy, but it wasn't a deal breaker for me.

Thanks for the great recipe! My family loved this. Based on earlier reviews I left out the salt and because I don't like them I left out the tomatoes.  I cooked on high 7 hours - adding the greeen peppers for the last 2 hours. It was perfect, and even better the next day.

Love this stuff!  I make it regularly. I have tried it with sirloin and with round steak and found I like it better to use thin cut round steak instead of sirloin.  When I use the round steak I cut down on the soy sauce just a little because the round steak does not have as much juice that cooks out of the meat and it turns out a little salty otherwise.

Both my husband and I thought it was very salty. Otherwise it was easy and pretty good.  I also did not brown the meat ahead of time like it said. I have no time for that when I am putting dinner together before I go to work(very early morning),and never have had a problem with not browing the meat when a recipe calls for it.

This was delicious!  The meat melted in your mouth, and the sauce was very flavorful.  I used red and orange bell peppers to add color, and also added a chopped zucchini.  I served it over jasmine rice.  Everyone had seconds!

This recipe was absolutely awesome.  I ate nearly the entire thing by myself.  I hate when I read about changes to a recipe, but I had to out of necesiity because I lacked certain ingredients.

First, I only had filet minon so I used that rather than sirloin.  Also, I had no beef bouillon but my dish was plenty beef tasting so I'm not sure what that adds to the recipe.  Also, I like my sauce a little thicker so I added 2 to 3 tablespoons of cornstarch extras during the cooking process.

FYI, this dish heats up REALLY well the next day and is great over a couple of slices of toast.  Thanks again for the recipe!

Sorry for the double post, wanted this review under mine rather than my wife's id.

I'm not crazy about pepper steak, but this recipe changed my mind.  I used closer to 3 lbs of beef stew meat since I was feeding a large crowd and used 1 can of beef broth and 1 can of tomatoes with green chilies.  I did not add the cornstarch since I didn't want it thick and it turned out really well.  This would be great with cornbread.  Thanks Marge.

I gave this recipe 5 stars because of its potential.  I always make my first attempt exactly as the recipe is written.  Here's what I'll do next time:  Use 3 tbs cornstarch, 6 tblsp soy sauce.  Cook meat 2 hours on low with liquids, seasonings and tomatoes.  Then add peppers (2 green & 1 yellow or red), a large sweet onion, sliced carrots and water chestnuts.  Then cook an additional 2 hours on low.  Thanks Marge!

Very easy and tasty! I used top sirloin and came out tender. I also added one bell pepper half way through cook time and then the other a half hour before it was done. Served over rice and it was a meal in itself. My boyfriend said make it again so I think it was a winner. Thanks Marge.

After reading the other reviews, I omitted the bouillon and water, using 2 cans of beefy mushroom soup instead.  I also added a package of dry brown gravy mix instead of adding more cornstarch...then...I got real brave and added 2 TSP. ginger.  At first all I could smell was the ginger and thought I really made a mistake, but after it simmered, the flavors blended perfectly.  Try it and see for yourself.

Like a goof, I forgot to add the tomatoes (I love the tomatoes), but this was A-W-E-S-O-M-E!  I didn't add the sugar or salt as the recipe called for, but it was perfect the way it was.  I put the crock pot on low for 6 hours and it was perfect.  My husband LOVED this.  A little cornstarch in the last 1/2 hour helped thicken it up.  Thanks so much Marge!!

My family, which includes two teenagers, loved this recipe. It was flavorful and the meat was fork tender. I bought top round steak and sprinkled it with the garlic and paprika. I used two bouillon cubes. I will definitely prepare this recipe often.

Wonderful flavor.  I didn't have any pepper steak, but had beef sirloin tips and used those instead and it wasn't quite as tender, but the flavor was excellent and very simple.  I will try again with pepper steak.

My husband and I were extremely happy with the results of this recipe! I will definitely make it again. I did follow guidance of another reviewer and added minced garlic and red pepper flakes. This is definitely a recipe that will become a staple in our home!!

this turned out great however I think the next time I make it I will omit the salt, the soy sauce will be enough for salt.

Other than mediocre pulled pork/chicken, there isn't a slow cooker recipe that I like except for an old family favourite - "Grandma 's Spaghetti".
Until this recipe! 
It lives up to it's high reviews. The aroma is wonderful and with the soy sauce and green pepper ingredients, has a yummy almost Chinese food smell. Arriving home from work everyone said they hoped the dinner that they smelled from the driveway was coming from their kitchen.
This recipe is so good!
* I finally solved the mystery of the auto feature on my slow cooker. If anyone else, who stupidly threw out the box & instructions is wondering, 
when initially set on auto, the temperature will stay at high for 1 hour then will automatically change to low for the remainder of cook time. More than a few sources stated the flavour is remarkably improved.         
Very cool!

Outstanding.  Made recipe pretty exact with minor changes: I used the pre-cut stir fry beef for ease. I didn't even cook the beef, I just threw it in the crockpot frozen.  I also added the peppers and onion the last 2 hours on low.  The gravy was still a little runny so I did add an additional 1T of cornstarch the last 30 minutes to thicken.  Just like my mom used to make for my birthday!

So tasty! The meat was tender enough that even my one-year old son was able to enjoy it.  Thanks for the tips to put the peppers in at the end. That worked great!

Followed the recommendations of others. I cooked on low for 6 hours. Put the sliced peppers in 90 min before done, and used some of the gravy to dissolve 1 Tablespoon cornstarch then mixed it back into the gravy to thicken it some. I also used low sodium soy sauce and red, green, yellow and orange peppers to make it more colorful.

Tried this recipe as written.  If was good but the steak was bland.  Needs something to make the steak have some taste. My hubby and I didn't find it absorbed any of the sauce's flavour.  The sauce itself was nice on rice. I'll try this again but add something(a rub on the steak or an extra spice of some sort)to try and give the steak a boost.

I won't be eating the rest of my batch, or using this recipe again. I did as others did and use the pre-cut beef for stew. The peppers were mush and the steak was tender but extremely chewy - terrible texture. I cooked on low for 7 hours, per recipe instructions. So the texture may have been better on high at 4 hours, but I won't be trying again.

I thought this was delicious, and the whole family enjoyed it. The meat was tender, and the sauce was great. However, I would suggest cutting the onions into strips rather than chopping them. Also, don't put the green peppers in from the start or they will turn to mush. Wait until about an hour before it's done to put them in so that they have a little crunch left to them.

Sorry...I didn't like it at all. I had to just save the meat at the end and made fajita with it. I really couldn't tell what it's supposed to taste like. It was like "no identity" dish....at least to me.

My husband and 3 boys loved it!  We will definitely add it to our  future menu plans!
I just made some minor adjustments.  I added brown sugar instead of white and put a little more than mentioned in the recipe.  I also added ginger powder to the meat and sauce.  I added 1/4th cup of soy sauce instead of the 3 tablespoons.  Put in 1 cup of onion.  I added some chili flakes to give it an extra kick.  I also added the bell pepper 1 hour before it was ready, and added only red bell pepper instead of green.

Delicious.  Left out salt due to bouillon and soy sauce.  Cooked on high 4 hours, then low for 1 - at which point I added the peppers (one orange and one red).  Added about 1 T of red wine.  (daughter did this when she made it).  Served over rice.  Only thing I would do differently next time is to thicken the sauce a bit more.  A real winner!  Thanks!

Easy to throw together for a "fix it and forget it" type of recipe. I partially froze the sirloin so it was easier to cut it into thin strips.  I didn't use the garlic powder, but rather added minced garlic to the sauce and fried the beef in olive oil vs. vegetable.  I also used a concentrated Swanson flavor packet since I didn't have beef bouillion on hand.  I opted to use a low sodium soy sauce along with a few splashed of low sodium Worchestershire sauce and left the salt out altogether.  To give it a little "kick" I added a tsp. of chili garlic sauce.  I cooked it on high for two hours and an additional 4 hours on low.  I sliced the veggies (onion, green, and red pepper) length wise vs. chopping and added them the last two hours of cooking so they didn't end up mushy.  Perfect served over rice!

We will be having this for supper this week-end.I know it will be good as I have tried similar versions of this before.1 variation I would suggest is to use garlic infused oil instead of the garlic powder and oil for cooking the beef strips.Also,use a packet of Au Jus mix instead of the beef boullion cubes.These will add to the flavor and reduce the work.
( To get the infused oil,just peel some garlic cloves and place in a small jar of Canola or Safflower,olive oil works too.store in the refrigerator until you want to use it.)

This needs a lot of adjusting... I like the idea of it though. If I make it again I may sub a can of pineapples for the tomatoes. Alternatively, if I make it as directed here, next time I will add 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar, and 1 tbls fresh ginger, minced.

Love it!!! I used a 2" thick sirloin cut into 1"x2" strips, browned them as directed with the peppers and onions and cooked on high for 4 hours with carrots and celery, about 1 1/2 hrs before dinner-- added the rest of the vegies and cooked on low. Served over white steamed rice and it was the BOMB!! Left overs were the first to go on "leftover night" and I didn't get any, I love it when a new recipe is the first to disappear. Thanks MJWagner for the fabulous addition in my recipe box!

This is very good but I wish I would have added the peppers about 30 minutes before we eat.  I added them about 1 1/2 before we eat and they were still very mushy.  I will change that next time.

Easy, Fast and can prepare most of it the night before. 
Picky husband loved this. Because of my work hours I had to leave it in the cooker for 8 hours, on low. The meat was tender, cut with a spoon and was perfect. I cut my strips  2" wide and about 1/4 thick (strips but not small strips) The peppers- I put the sliced bell peppers on the very top hoping they had a chance - no chance! They were soft but the taste was still good when I placed everything over white rice. Sauce: like others I added core cornstarch mixed with a little water to thicken it up, but it was still a soupy consistency. Regardless, the hubby had two huge servings which is rare! One cooking tip from granny: NEVER tell them how it was "supposed" to turn out!

While I thought the flavor was pretty good, I thought it was too salty.  I had even used no salt canned tomatoes, reduced sodium soy sauce, low sodium beef base and only used 1/3 of the tsp of salt called for.  I think it has potential and I will make it again. I like things salty but it was almost too much for me and my husband didn't eat it because of the salt level.

This was extremly delicious. I prepared mine in a cast iron dutch oven. Fried my beef then added  a can of mexican tomato sauce, an onion with bouillon everything except veggies,. It only took about an hour and i added my veggies(i also added celery, a red bell pepper and carrots)  in the last 15 min. or so i wanted them to have a little crunch.

Just bought a slow cooker and decided on this recipe based on the good reviews. I don't really care for beef but the sauce was really good! My partner and my 2 yo gobbled it down. A keeper in my books!

I have been making this recipe for a few years now and it never lets me down.  I just made it for Christmas Day and it was a huge hit.  The meat comes out so tender and flavorful.  I use 1/2 cup of water and 3 bouillon cubes becuase I like more sauce.  We serve with white rice and mashed potatoes.  Best pepper steak recipe ever.

I love this recipe.  I usually prefer lots of spices in my dishes, but I took a chance on this.  Wow, great flavor; seems like winter-time comfort food to me.  I did double the water/bouillon so mine was more like soup. Used red bell pepper only & served it over rice.  Maybe will try adding some ginger next time, but I just loved it as  is.  Definitely a keeper.

This is absolutely delicious!! I didn't have stewed tomatoes, so I added 2 cans of Rotel tomatoes but everything else I stuck to the recipe. Delicious! It's awesome over rice, but I think it would be perfect to make into a Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich! Running to the store right now to get some hoagies and provolone cheese!

My husband and I enjoyed this very much.  I wanted to follow suggestions to add peppers towards the end, but I forgot and threw them in at the beginning.  Will absolutely become a regular in the rotation!

Pretty good.... I am not a pepper steak fan (or fond of many Asian dishes in general), but this wasn't bad at all. :) Today has been super busy so I needed a meal that required minimal effort to prepare. Of all the recipes that came up in my search, this one jumped out at me. This is perfect for days you don't feel like cooking or have little time to cook a stovetop meal (you can never go wrong slow cooking beef, IMHO). Other than cooking on high for the first hour and adding my bell peppers the last hour of cooking , I made no changes. NOTE: Adding my peppers when I did was spot on. Had I added them any sooner, they would have been mushy. Any later, they'd be too crisp for my liking. Served over rice with a sprinkling of sesame seeds, this was very good. I think I'll try making a sub sandwich with the leftovers tomorrow! Thanks for sharing, MJWAGNER68. :-)

This just didn't turn out for me. I used really good steak and it came out really dry, despite having plenty of liquid available. I also felt like the spices I added to the steak before and during cooking were somehow washed off by the end. It was just dry and flavorless. I'm willing to try this again, but I'll be tweaking the recipe.

I am at a loss as to why this recipe is rated so highly... I followed the recipe exactly, and needless to say my husband and I did not find it enjoyable at all. The only thing I can come up with is maybe families with children have different tastes than couples without kids? I dont know, but I will not be making this again.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe as is. The meat is so tender and tasty. The whole family gobbles it up. The only problem I have is cutting the raw meat into strips...makes me gag every time. But the end result is worth it!

Very tender, my kids loved it. i feel it was missing a little something, but overall it was very good. i may add some fresh ginger and red pepper flakes the next time to add a bit more flavor. i will definately make this again.

Awesome recipe! The steak was very tender. The only change I made was that I didn't have any stewed tomatoes (not one of my favorites) so I added an 8oz. can of tomato sauce and it worked just as well. Will definitely make again.

Very, very good.  But DEFINITELY add the peppers (green AND red) the last few minutes.  Even better.  Just throw them in, turn off the crock pot and let it sit for 5-10 minutes.  I even waited to add about half the onions towards the end so they weren't so mushy.

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except at the end I took out some of the broth and whisked in 2 tbsp of cornstarch to thicken it up some. It had wonderful flavor and we actually like the peppers and onions really soft.  My family loved it!

Tasted a little bland to me at first, so I added some red wine, fresh ground pepper, worcestershire sauce, and a bay leaf.  Served over basmati rice and steamed carrots. Yum!

This was really good!  I loved the flavor of this dish.  I have a few tips...First add the peppers after 2 hours of cooking so they don't get so soggy and I also had to add extra cornstarch to thicken 1/2 hour before the dish is finished cooking.  Yummy!!

If I could give this more than 5 stars, I would.  There is not a single thing I would change about this recipe, and if my husband had it his way I would make it multiple times per week.  Absolutely wonderful, thank you so much for sharing.

Liked this very much but made a couple simple changes.  I used red and orange peppers, and a chopped garlic clove plus I had some homemade beef broth so used it in place of the bouillon and water.  Served it with noodles and it was delicious and very tender.

Quite good and tasty! I have made this a few times and I have added other things to mix it up on occasion. Try sweeter peppers. Minced garlic - a couple of cloves or more depending on your taste. Red onion added is also tasty too. This is def worth a try!

I read through many reviews and took others suggestions and did the following with great success....I marinated the beef in beer overnight.  Then, seasoned it as recipe states, but did not brown in pan, I just put it into crock pot.  I did NOT add extra salt as it was NOT needed due to the soy sauce.  I added a clove or two of minced garlic and some sliced mushrooms.  I used one red pepper and one green, but did not add until last hour of cooking.  Served with rice and had leftovers!!  Will make it again!

Very good flavor! I didn't add any salt and I added an extra Beef Bouillon with an extra 1/2 cup of water. Like a lot of other people suggested, I didn't add any peppers until it was done. I turned the crock pot to warm, added the peppers, and let it sit for another 30 minutes. GREAT!!!

This was just a good meal. It kind of tasted like pot roast to me. It wasn't really quite what I was looking for. I agree with the other reviewers, definitely wait until later to put in the onions and peppers because they get really soggy. Wish I had listened to their advice!

Very tasty recipe! The only thing I had to add was another cup of bouillon and omitted the extra tsp of salt. Next time, I'm thinking of omitting the tomatoes to get a different flavor combination. Overall, it's a family favorite!

Made just as recipe stated - put peppers in at beginning but then put in another handful of thin slices about 45 minutes before serving.  Served over seasoned brown rice and my family ate every last bit.  Great recipe that I'll make again.

Excellent! I didn't even add salt at all and it's still flavorful. Make sure to add the bell pepper 2 hours prior from being done. The only thing I disliked was the cut of meat; it was a bit dry.

Perfect as written! We however are a low sodium home  so I adjusted as follows: low sodium soy sauce and tomatoes no salt and fresh garlic instead of garlic salt. I put a stop light package of peppers (red, green & yellow) in the last hour of cooking! Great with rice or egg noodles! No leftovers! Enjoy!

I just made this today and BOY oh BOY I couldn't imagine anything being anymore delicious or easy to make! My boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed it! I couldn't believe how tender the meat got and the only thing I changed was that I added the green pepper in about 2 hours before the end of cook time so they would not get mushy. Came out perfect! This is definitely going into the "keepers" and *yummy* files!

I had family in from out of town on a weekday.  I saw this recipe and gave it a try.  Crockpot meals while I was at work was an excellent idea.  I purchased a 4 pound sirloin, because I was cooking for ten.  I did the prep work the night before, cut up beef (I did chunks) and peppers and kept separately.  In the morning, I threw together.  I noticed the recipe only called for 1/4 cup of water - I added 2 cups and blended with a good tablespoon of beef base.  I also followed other suggestion of adding peppers in the last hour.  When I got home, my kids thought it was soup!  I turned crockpot on high, added pepers.  When broth simmered, I added the cornstarch and water. Turned into a nice thick gravy within minutes.  Served with rice, salad and fresh bread from market.  Excellent!  I did not have any leftovers (darn!). I will definitely make again!

Real Easy & Really Good!  We used red peppers ( a little sweeter & less bitter) since the kids don't like the green ones .  Add peppers last 2 hours or so.  Also, if you are cooking while at work (8+ hours), add an extra 1/4 cup of water to keep it from drying up.

Very tasty!  You gotta try it!  I made some slight changes and it turned out perfect for me.  I used 2 bouillon cubes, 1/2 cup water, left the onions in rings, petite diced tomatoes, and  brown sugar rather than white, omitted the salt, and then added 1 Tbsp of worcestershire sauce.  I cooked this on high for 3 1/2 hrs and then added the peppers and onions and cooked on LOW for another 30 min so they weren't mushy.  I wish I would have doubled the recipe so I could've had more leftovers!

It was a tad bland, but a keeper. I used petite cut tomatos (personal preference) and none of their juice. A red and a green bell pepper. Probably needs some black pepper, Worstershire, I don't know what else. I added the bell peppers for the last hour and they were perfect.

I have made this a few times now.  I use stew meat, and add the peppers a little later.  Family likes it.  I consider it a good recipe anytime my kids can see the veggies and will still eat it without complaint.

this was my first time making pepper steak.. wow this was easy.. and I made a big pot of it. It was very flavorful, I didnt use any salt , because of the use of garlic powder and the soy sauce which is loaded w/ sodium.. Also at the end of cooking you can taste it , add more soy sauce for taste.. THIS GETS  TWO THUMBS UP ..

I added the peppers at the end and more cornstarch at the end for a thicker sauce.  IT WAS DELICIOUS!  The meat was so tender and yummy!  I also added some red pepper flakes and hot sauce since we like it HOT HOT HOT in our house!

Pretty good recipe.  I cut the high quality sirloin I bought from the butcher to about 1 inch but next time I'll slice it even thinner to achieve a less chewy/dry meat.  I cooked mine on high but I think a longer, lower cooking temperature would also help with the texture of the beef.

Great recipe.  Made quite a few changes. Didnt use the beef boullion.  Marinated the beef for 36 hrs before hand in soy sauce, garlic, vinegar.  Used whole tomatoes instead of stewed.  marinted the soy sauce w/ thai chillis (3 of them) for 12 hours as well.  Threw in whole mushrooms as well to compliment the bell peppers and onions.  Yummy! Turned out awesome!

this was delicious.  i added a hefty spoonful of crushed ginger (the kind that comes in  a jar) for extra flavor and also used garlic from the jar as well instead of powder.  it's the lazy way of going 'fresh'.  cooked on high for ~3 hours, added peppers ~20 minutes before the end to avoid soggy veggies.  yum!

Wow, this turned out FANTASTIC!!! I skipped browning the meat because I just didn't find it necessary. I just threw everything (except peppers) in the crockpot and sprinkled with garlic and onion powder, red pepper, pepper, and a few dashes of worsteshire.  I did double the sauce which I thought was perfect to make sure there was enough gravy for the rice.  I added a bag of frozen peppers in the last 20 min of cooking.  Thanks for an amazing new recipe!!

This was definitely average. My husband thought it needed water chestnuts to add some crunch and I though it needed mushrooms and onions for a different flavor (alas, I don't eat water chestnuts and he doesn't eat mushrooms and onions). However, the ease of this was wonderful. As a teacher, I do intend to make this again during the school year adding in the extras on the side. It would also be good to put inside tortillas a la BDs BBQ.

This is the very, very BEST pepper steak copycat I have ever had at home and takes better than takeout. Buy pre-sliced, pre-tenderized sirloin or tenderize and slice up your own. Add peppers in last and maybe add in 1 tsp cornstarch (blended with 1/2 tsp water) to thicken up sauce and cook for an addition 2 mins. If something is missing, toss in some green onions, but seriously fantastic! Serve with the fried rice recipe on here!!!!

Adding this to my slow cooker favorites list!!  My family really liked it.  I had a couple extra folks over and really don't like trying new recipes out on company, but needed to.  They loved it too and asked for the recipe.  I added the peppers at at the end, and i browned the steak with flour and garlic powder.  Those were about the only two changes I made.  I served it with rice and potstickers from the grocery store.  I just had the leftovers for lunch and they are still good the next day!!!

Great Meal.  I used tri-tip steak cause that was all I had on hand.  I served with mash potatoes covered with shredded cheddar and bacon.

This was excellent! I tripled the amount of water, bouillon, and soy sauce. No need to add salt-- soy sauce has plenty of it. I took some ideas of other reviewers and added a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce. I also added the peppers and onions with about 1 hour left to the pot, added some broccoli too. Served over brown rice. Great! Thanks for sharing!

This is just not good. It tastes like nothing but tomatoes and is very flavorless otherwise. On top of that, the texture is terrible. I had my doubts about this recipes upon reading it, but was reassured by the overall positive reviews. I should have trusted my own judgement!

Good and comfortable! I used a 2+lb of chunk roast instead of sirloin. Placed onion and beef slices in the slow cooker. In a measuring cup, mixed the beef broth (1/4cup), 2tsp of arrowroot 1 can diced tomatoes (instead of stewed), 2 tbsp each of soy sauce and worcestershire sauce, thyme, oregano, black pepper, steak seasoning and orange zest. Poured this mixture in the slow cooker and cooked on low for ~8hrs. Stirred in the pepper slices 45min b/f serving. The peppers were perfect.

I didn't have the soy sauce, I didn't think the salt was neccessry & it turned out great. Husband LOVED it. The meat was so tender & delicious. Cooked on high for at least 4 hrs. Peppers were soggy, but he liked them that way wiht this meal. Thanks for a great recipe!

Wonderful!  I normally don't like pepper steak but this was absolutely delicious!  My husband said the soy sauce over powered it so next time I'll try low sodium.  But, other then that it was awesome!

I absolutely HATE!!!! cooking with green peppers.  But, since the rest of my family enjoys them, I begrudgingly tried this recipe.  I am so glad I did.  This is very tasty.  A hit all around.  It is now in my regular rotation of meals.  YUMMMM

I made this for a party and served small sub rolls cut in half and set out some mayo (in case people wanted sandwiches or use bread to soak juices. It was a success. EVERYONE LOVED IT!! needless to say there were no leftovers.  Will definately make again for dinner and for parties.

This is almost like a stew in consistency and taste. You could probably add carrots and other veggies, and maybe pre-cooked potatoes toward the end of the cook time to make this into stew. Anyway, it was de-lish. Super easy too. I didn't have beef bullion cubes -- used the granuals instead. I also tossed in a whole container of sliced mushrooms. Really easy and as one other reviewer said, a nice change from recipes that call for cream of something soup in the slow cooker.

Additional comments:  Made again this time with chuck steak cut into 2" wide strips, doubled the water, boullion, and cornstarch.  Set on low for 8.5 hours.  All the liquid had evaporated except for tiny pools where the chopped tomatoes had ended-up/cooked down to.  Added bell pepper & onion.  This doesn't taste good with chuck steak.  My recommendations:  Don't cook on low all day,' and don't use chuck steak.

11/24/06 Sliced sirloin in 1/2-3/4" wide strips & browned in a drizzle of olive oil.  Topped with a can of chopped tomatoes & sprinkled ingredients atop (omitted salt).  Stirred in sliced onion & bell peppers for last 45" of 3.25 hour cooking on high. Flavourful light/thin sauce.  Veggies were perfect for us--not mushy but cooked soft enough to easily cut with a fork.  A very quick prep and short cooktime (for a slow cooker)!  A very good keeper.

This was good. I added the peppers at the beginning and they turned out soggy. Add them during the last hour or so!! I had to add cornstarch to make the sauce thicker..otherwise it would have been watery. Good, though!!!

My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe.  The meat was very tender and the sauce was tasty!  I agreed with other reviewers that the peppers were mushy, but when I cook with a slow cooker its because I'm coming home late, and don't have time to add them during the last hour.  I used one red pepper to add color, and had to add extra cornstarch to thicken the sauce, but other wise made no changes.  This is not a recipe that we will be raving about for days, which is why I'm not giving it 5 stars, but it was very good, and I will make it again.

I've made this many, many times. I always add a dash of red pepper flakes, and double the "broth", but aside from that, I don't change a thing. This is really delicious as is. I usually serve with cornbread muffins.

Excellent!  I bought the "sirloin strips for stir-fry" and cooked on high for only an hour and a half and it was delicious!  Meat was cut small enough that it didn't take that long.  It was a bit on the salty side (and I omitted the tsp of salt), but I'm sure a switch to the low sodium broth would help that.  Hubby loved it too!!  (oh, p.s. I used 3 tbsp cornstach & 6tbsp soy sauce per another reviewer's suggestion; the consistency was perfect, but maybe less soy would also lower the sodium content)  Update to original review:  I've made this at least 4 more times since, and it seems like only the first 2 times it came out soooo delish.  The last two times it was just "okay" -- not sure exactly what I'm doing different, but it's apparently one of those recipes that is highly dependent on multiple factors (i.e. cooking times, cut of meat, etc.), so if you loved it, be sure to cook it the same way every time!

This is a  new twist on a recipe I have for Sherried Beef and one for Beef Tips and Gravy. I always use the dry brown gravy mix instead of the bouillon because of the sodium.  I did not put in the sugar and I used red wine instead of water.  Also, as one reviewer did, I used the tomatoes with green chilis.  I also added fresh garlice, carrots and mushrooms.  I used stew meat and sliced it thin.  I only used 1 Tbsp of the cornstarch as the dry gravy mix thickens it on it's own. I also did not brown my meat before.  I served this over mashed potatoes and it was great.  Always served mine over egg noodles and wanted a change. I let it cook for 2 hours before adding the onion, green pepper and carrots.  Next time I will wait a little on the peppers and onions.  I will make this again.

This was really good for a slow-cooker meal. I added the peppers during the last hour of cooking so they wouldn't be mushy and they turned out perfect.

Great time saver. I used a top round steak, cut into very thin slices. Very tasty and tender, I also added the peppers during the last hour or so.

Great recipe! I also added and extra tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken the sauce.              **TIP** freeze the beef for 1/2 hour before slicing, to make it easier to get thin, perfect slices.

This was just terrific!!  I did follow an earlier comment and added one can of golden mushroom soup.  Also, I mixed the cornstarch with 1 can of beef broth, rather than with water.  It was very flavorful, with enough gravy.  Excellent over rice.  Thank you, Marge!

Double all ingredients except beef, garlic powder, oil and bell peppers.  This will give more juice.

I like the easiness of making this. I did season the sirloin with Lawry's Seasoned Salt and fresh crushed black pepper along with the garlic. I also added a yellow bell pepper. Very good recipe.

I was not a fan of this recipe. 

I paired this with jasmine rice, but it seemed so tomato-y that it almost called for pasta. The flavor was definitely all there, just 'off'. I think if I make it again, I'd go lighter on the tomatoes, and bump up the peppers, and definitely forego the salt.

The entire crockpot of pepper steak was finished in one sitting - two adults and three kids.  Now mind you, my picky teens never like anything I make, and I don't like crock pot meals very much because they all taste the same to me.  Not this recipe!  I ate it and loved it, and my kids ate it and loved it.  It's a keeper!

Made this according to recipe. Did use low sodium soy sauce and diced tomatoes as I didn't have stewed.  I used Pacific brand beef broth since I didn't have bouillon. I added a few shakes of worchestershire sauce. As others suggested, added the peppers about an hour before it was done. Cooked on high for 3 3/4 hrs. It came out tender and delicious. To make the sauce thicker I doubled the cornstarch. That's it!
Will definitely make this again. My family loved it.

I made this for my husband. He enjoyed it. I added 1/2 of the can of tomatoes and added a fresh Roma to. I did add 1/8 teaspoon of ginger to.  I did add extra thickener/cornstarch. I did not add the salt either after reading the other reviews. Prepped everything yesterday and got it all in the slow cooker today, added the peppers the last hr as recommended!  I will make this again! Thank You

Great dish with a lot of flavor. I was excited to try a new recipe and started off making it exactly as written (except I wasn't using a slow cooker). After tasting it before it was done I found that it tasted almost exactly like a Filipino dish that I've never tried to make. Even my husband said it tasted like it. So I chopped up some potatoes, added some peppercorn and a couple bay leaves...yup, it's a Filipino style stew now.

Made this for dinner tonight and it turned out really well. After slicing,  browning and putting garlic on the steak, I put it in the slow cooker with the other ingredients for about 5 hours on high which allowed the meat (I used filet mignon because we always keep it in the freezer) to tenderize very nicely. As many reviewers suggested, I waited until about 45 minutes until serve time to add the peppers - I used red, orange and yellow ones. Also, I omitted the stewed tomatoes because I was going for a more meaty flavor rather than a tomato-y one. I also quadrupled the water, corn starch and beef bouillon cubes so I would have plenty of gravy. I added a splash of Worcestershire sauce per some reviewers' recommendations. When everything was cooked perfectly tender, I served it over white rice and it was very good. I think that it would turn out just as well using a less costly cut of meat (such as sirloin per the recipe). Also, I would like to figure out how to make the gravy a little more flavorful; I felt like I needed to give it a stronger flavor but I am not sure how to do so.

This was delicious! I doubled the recipe and  made a few logical simple changes.  First, I used a variety of large peppers (1 each Red, Yellow and Green Bells, 1 poblano, 1 jalepano ).  I subbed 1 envelop of Liptons Onion Soup Mix in place of the bouillon.  Omit the salt since all the other ingredients have plenty.  And finally 1 can stewed Tomatoes and one can of Diced Tomatoes so not to be to sweet.

Made the recipe as instructed except I used beef broth instead of a bouillon cube and water. My peppers basically disintegrated into the gravy so I created pepper flavored steak. My husband loved it tho. If I make this again I'll add the peppers and onion during the last hour.

I should confess that I made a few changes.  First we had leftover grass fed sirloin steak that we grilled the night before.  So I trimmed and sliced it and put it in the crock pot, added grilled sliced onions and covered it in low sodium beef broth (1 1/2 cups) added the ginger, garlic powder, 1 tsp Splenda and low sodium soy sauce and refrigerated it overnight.  In the morning I added the tomatoes and cornstarch (1 TBS dissolved in some of the broth) and turned it on low, then about 45 minutes before serving I added the sliced peppers and turned it on high.  Served over brown rice with a side dish of steamed broccoli. Totally delicious! I was nervous about using grilled steak but the flavor was amazing and it was fork tender.  If you want a thicker sauce add another TBS of cornstarch when you add the bell peppers. No oil, no sugar and low sodium ingredients made this an excellent choice for my hubby who has high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and diabetes.

Loved this! So yummy. The only thing I didn't have was stewed tomatoes, so I added diced ones. Will be in my regular rotation from now on. I browned the meat and cut all the veggies up the night before, put them away in the fridge. In the AM I put it all together, along with the liquids before leaving to work. Cooked on slow for 7 hrs. The results? Amazing!

This was a tasty dish. The beef sirloin was so tender that it almost fell apart. If you like your bell peppers with a little crunch, I recommend adding them about one hour before the end of cook time. I served it over a bed of white rice. I like spicy dishes, so next time I plan to add about one-half sliced jalapeño or a tsp. crushed peppers.

Family Favorite! We used Red Peppers like the picture shows, instead of green that the recipe calls for.  It was amazing!! My picky teenager LOVED IT & asked for it again next week.  We also used flank steak that we hand sliced.

Quick meal to put together!   Because you brown the mets before putting it in the crockpot, it really doesn't take long at all to cook so it's probably not ideal to out in for a whole day while I'm at work.   As other reviews suggested, I added the pepper strips in about the last 45 minutes and was pleased with the turn-out and it made for excellent leftovers the next day.  We served it over rice.

This is a great dish, I remember from childhood.  I would skip the soy sauce and salt though. The bouillon was plenty salty tasting. Used fresh minced garlic in place of garlic powder. Used red and yellow peppers, cause that's what I had.  I added brown mushrooms.  I subbed red wine for the 1/4 cup of water. The mushrooms and the wine added a real rich flavor. The meat was so tender. I cooked it for 8 hours on low, but 7 hours on low would have been plenty fine. Served over a garlic linguine pasta with a side of steamed asparagus.  Wonderful.

The meat was delicious and literally fell apart. The picture showed red bell peppers so I used one red and one green. The tomatoes seemed a little out of place. I'd make it again but use more peppers and skip the tomatoes. As other reviewers mentioned, I might add the peppers later. I like soft peppers but not quite that soft.

This was good. I must say my husband loved it and I thought it was just good, but will probably make again as it's a nice change from time to time. I followed it exact with the exception of the beef bouillon. I didn't want to use that with the MSG, etc. so I used one little plastic container of the Knorr Homestyle concentrated stock instead that has no additives. This probably also helped cut down on the salt issue that a lot of reviews complained about. Since I didn't use the bouillon I was sure to add some salt as well so that it didn't come out bland (I just used some Montreal steak spice). I served with shanghai noodles instead of rice and that was great.

Really good. I serve over rice. I also will change the stewed tomatoes for Italian stewed tomatoes. Not a huge difference, but it's noticable.

This was absolutely wonderful! My husband loved it and had two large helpings. The only thing that I changed was to add a teaspoon of minced garlic. I mixed the soy sauce, sugar and salt into the bouillon cube mixture before adding to the crock pot. The only other thing that I did differently was to use stir fry beef that was already cut instead of a whole beef sirloin. It cost a little more but saved a lot of time and was so much easier. I will definitely be making this again!

Sooooo delicious, although next time I will add less salt.  Also, I had to add a flour and water mixture to further thicken the gravy.  Otherwise, it was hard to stop eating it, even after having a full portion.  Leftovers didn't last a day in the fridge - a new hubby favourite.  Even my 4 year old ate some!

made this yesterday while we were in the middle of a snow storm. Needed something REALLY good for dinner to go with a homemade pound cake and this recipe did NOT disappoint! It was delicious and so easy to make. It has a great taste, meat was very tender and was perfect for our icy evening. This will certainly be given 5 stars from both my husband and me!,

This was a good quick easy meal. I did not use a slow cooker but instead cooked it in a skillet on the stove for around 1 hour. Very tasty. One tip, slice your steak fairly thin.

This is an excellent recipe.  I didn't change a thing.  It was super easy to prepare and what more can a busy mom/wife want than to throw all of the ingredients in a slow-cooker and have an amazing meal after work and chores?  Everyone loved it.  Hubby (household master of grilling/smoking) said it is now one of his most favorite recipes.  Yay!

Oh my oh my how I love love love this recipe...it is now my go to recipe when I need something delicious and simple to make.  Every time I've made it, I've done it just as the recipe is stated, and have yet to be disappointed with it.  I find it best served over broad egg noodles and some really nice bread with it....You gotta try this one!!

Just made this yesterday for a friend and myself.  Very easy, very tasty, perhaps a tad slaty for my taste.  Not a problem will leave out the tsp. of salt next time.  My friend loved it as it is.  I did add three bell peppers and a whole onion.  Also used one packet of "Flavor Booster" rather than the bouillon cube because that is what I had in the pantry.  Other than that made it as written.  I have already shared this recipe with several people.  Would love to have more like this in my rotation.  Thank you for sharing, it's a keeper.

Very easy and tasty! I made it without the added teaspoon of salt and was glad I did as it would've been too salty otherwise. As suggested by another reviewer I added the peppers during the last hour of cooking to avoid over softening and they were just right. Hubby was very happy and asked if there was going to be enough for leftovers...high praise from him. Will be making this again.

We found this to be fairly bland for our tastes.  Fiance added hot sauce and he was please. I wasn't. There was no real depth. Followed the recipe but did make extra sauce. This one is coming out of the recipe box.

Although it pleased everyone who ate it, I found the gravy to be a bit soupy. Next time will strain the sauce out and quickly thicken it in a sauce pan with a bit more cornstarch and, perhaps, some crushed red pepper flakes to give it a bit of a kick. I used a red pepper and a green pepper to get some variety of pepper flavor. Served it over a plate of rice.

Wow, this was really delicious. I followed all of the ingredients closely but added an extra red bell pepper I had on hand and used a 28oz can stewed tomatoes just because I love them. I didn't think the extra liquid would make all that much difference but we had too much (flavorful) juice, so in the future I'll not add more total liquid than stated. I made sure to mix the water/bullion/tomatoes etc. in the skillet I browned the meat in, to get all the great browned bits and save a dish. Thanks so much for sharing!

My family loved this.  Served it over rice and it was a big hit.  The only change to the recipe is that I added one clove of finely chopped fresh garlic -- in addition to the garlic powder -- to the oil as the meat browned.

Did not like this at all.  I should have known that pepper steak is not a great candidate for the slow cooker.  Everything was way too mushy for my taste.  And I left the peppers out till the last 30 minutes.  All we could taste was the soy sauce and the meat was way to mushy.  Sorry.

This reminded me of the pepper steak my mom used to make when I was growing up.  It was very easy to make and tasted good too!  I modified the recipe a little and purchased the pre-packaged pepper steak instead of the beef sirloin and just sliced it into thinner strips as they were pretty large pieces.  I did not have the stewed tomatoes so I used diced tomatoes instead.  I also followed another suggestion and cut my red and green peppers into larges pieces instead of chopping them. I used a mixture of red and green to add more color.  If you like a firmer pepper I would add the peppers a little later, although I had no complaints!

I made this as written only using 1 green and 1 red pepper, as that is what I had on hand.  My family loved this dinner.  I served it over brown rice along with a salad using 'Dorothy Lynch Style Salad Dressing' another AR recipe and rolls.  A very nice and filling meal that I will make again.

I used some homemade beef broth instead of the bouillon.  Used green, yellow and red peppers sliced, made it very colorful.  I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and added the peppers during the last hour of cooking.  Served over Jasmine Rice with a fruit salad.  Thank you for sharing, it was wonderful !!

This was a great recipe. My kids and I are picky eaters and we all loved it. The meat was so tender. Made the recipe like it stated no alterations and it was perfect.  Will be making this one again.

I LOVE this recipe and use round steak, since it's lean and cheap. I only use 1-2 tbls of olive oil instead of vegetagle oil. I also use red peppers instead of green to add more of a sweetness and I skip using the sugar in it and use low sodium soy sauce. I'm making it for the second time tonight and can't wait to chow down. =-)

We liked the recipe as is but enjoyed it even more  after using paprika and garlic powder to coat the beef strip prior to cooking.

Great flavor and tender meat. The only thing that didn't work out for me was that the liquid was very very thin after 8 hrs in the crock pot, so I had to pour it into a saucepan and add more cornstarch to thicken it up.

This was pretty good, but a little bland for my taste. Slow cookers tend to dull flavor, so feel free to add more spices. I might add more soy sauce and some seasonings next time.

This was an awesome recipe! I did like the others and added extra water and beef cubes. Used stir fry meat versus sirloin. I used green and yellow bell peppers, to make it look pretty! I also added 1 fresh red hot chilli pepper. Next time i will add two fresh chilli peppers. I will definitely make this again.

It was good, though a bit soupier than I expected.  Adding a couple more vegetables (water chestnuts maybe?) would also be a good addition.  Overall we were pleased with the dinner.

This recipe turned out great... I didn't however use a sirloin steak when I made it... I used a tougher cut, a round steak and it did tender up nicely as it cooked all day.... it had great flavor served over rice.... I also tried serving it with homemade pita and it worked ok... but rice was definately easier.... a good recipe to through in the slow cooker and forget about.. I did add a little black pepper and a few red pepper flacks... another thing I might do next time is wait a little bit to put in the green pepper as they did get soft... but then I might lose out on some flavor... it was very good the way it was made...

Absolutely Yummy!  I switched the garlic powder for 3 cloves of garlic (minced) and I used (1) red pepper, (1) yellow pepper and (1) orange pepper instead of the (2) green bell peppers.  It was the best and I don't even like peppers!  Great Recipe!

I didn't think this meal had that much flavor. The next time I made this dish I added fresh ground ginger to the pan when I seared the meat.  That added much more flavor!  All in all this is okay.

This recipe has become routine in my kitchen.  I have made it exactly as the recipe states and it is SUPERB!  However, I often leave out the tomatoes and my family likes it better that way.  I usually make it on the stovetop instead of the slow cooker--since the meat is cut into small strips, it is tender and ready to serve after about an hour on low simmer.

Very tasty! I used London broil which is a tougher cut of beef and it came out so tender and juicy. I served it to my family over rice and cabbage and they loved it.

Excellent and easy.  I waited until the last 45 min to add the peppers.  At the same time I scooped off the liquid and mixed it with cornstarch to thicken.

I don't have a slow cooker, so what I do with this dish is mixed the beef with fresh garlic cloves with oil and baked in the oven at 325 for 2 hours.  2 hours later, I took the whole pan out on the stove top and cook with green pepper, onion, tomatoes and the remaining ingredients.  It's pretty tasty.

Really enjoyed this recipe and it was super easy.  Did as others suggested and used pre-cut packaged strips for stir-fry and didn't add the peppers until the last hour.  Served it on rice, it had great flavor, especially the tomatoes.  Will definitely make again.

When I made this the first time, my husband wanted to know why I had never made it before.  It's definitely a repeater.  I use a can of diced tomatoes and yellow, orange or red bell peppers (whatever I have on hand).  We serve it over rice and it is very good!

This recipe is absolutley delicious. I have fixed this many times and each time there are rave reviews and I am asked for the recipe. I didn't have the soy and have used worchestershire in a smaller amount, still great results. I usually wait before adding  the salt because boullion can be quite salty. Give it a taste first. Thanks for this great recipe. It has become a stable in our kitchen.

It was alright, I followed what the other reviewers said and added peppers later.  I thought the meat was far too overdone and the whole mess was watery.  My husband seemed to like it.  I think this recipe's heart is in the right place, I will have to play around with it.

This was so good! I made it on the stove and it was still fine - I just cooked it for about an hour to let the steak tenderize. Only change I made was I added a can of french onion soup and drained the tomatoes. Served over rice and it was excellent!

LOVE this recipe and it's super easy! However, I don't brown the steak beforehand b/c it doesn't get as tender as opposed to just cooking it all the way in the crock pot...tender and juicy mmmm! I also throw the peppers in within the last few hours to keep them from getting soggy.

This recipe is awesome and hands down is 5 stars.  Make sure you brown the beef per the directions as it results in very tender beef.  I did not have cornstarch so did not add.  Per other reviews, I threw the green pepper in with two hours left.  I did find that this meal cooked very quickly in my crockpot.  On high, it took only four hours.  Served over rice.  Everyone commented that this was one of the best items I've made off this site.

This is awesome and so easy.   I did follow the others' advice and buy beef stir fry strips, doubled the water, bouillon and cornstarch to have more sauce, and added my peppers in the last hour of cooking.  Wonderful!

This was very good.  However, I would probably leave out the salt next time.  As others suggested, I added the green pepper about half way through cooking.  I served with egg noodles and peas.

Really good as written but I love spice, so I understand why some people think this has no 'zing' to it.  Next time, I'll add red pepper flakes or a jalepeno or two!

A delicious recipe! I didn't brown the meat in a pan, but right in the slow cooker- takes longer and doesn't get as brown, but it still turns out great! I've made the stovetop version, but this way the meat is more tender.  I have always added some ginger powder to mine though. We serve it with mashed potatoes.

I rated this 4 stars as I thought it was somewhat bland, but I do think this recipe is a keeper.  It is easy to prepare using the crockpot.  As others suggested, I also put the onions and peppers in the crockpot about halfway through the cooking time.  The next time I make this recipe I will use more garlic and add red pepper flakes.

I thought this was great! Not sure about the people who thought it was bland, although I did make a few minor adjustments - I added a tablespoon of Worstershire sauce; we don't use white sugar, so I used brown sugar instead; I added some freshly ground peppers directly to the meat. This is how I layered - sliced peppers (I used 1 each large green and red) and a whole sliced large sweet onion, garlic salt, sliced beef, black pepper and more garlic salt, canned tomatoes (I had diced on hand), then the 1/4 boullion with corn starch. Cooked on high for 3 hours. With 1 hour to go, I noticed the sauce was really thin, so I scooped out enough liquid, let it cool somewhat, and mixed in 2 more tablespoons of corn starch and poured it back in. This thickened the sauce nicely. I'll be making this again, but probably place the beef in whole to keep it from getting so dried out. My husband and 2-year-old son loved it!

I used real minced garlic instead of garlic salt and used red, orange and yellow bell peppers as well as green.  The meat came out so tender and delicious.  I WILL be making this again!  Next time I will add another can of stewed tomatoes.  I added cherry tomatoes in with the stewed but they didn't add much flavor.

I thought this was a great meal. Please follow other people's advice and do not put the peppers in there for the entire duration. I did that the first time and by the time they came out they were falling apart and mushy.

This was a big hit.  My family and I enjoyed this alot.  The only thing I will try next time is to use a more marbled cut of beef.  The sirloin seems a bit dry, a problem with very lean beef in a crock pot anyway.  Will definitely make this again.

this was pretty good, but i guess i was expecting a more Oriental flavor, which this didn't have...I should have known when it contained tomatoes that it wasn't going to taste very Asian, but it was nice nonetheless.  If i were to make it again I would have to change it some:  leave out the tomatoes and add perhaps more cornstarch for a thicker gravy, and maybe some sherry

Was DELICIOUS! Used seasoning salt and pepper along with garlic salt when browning the meat, and added a little extra salt and pepper directly into the slow cooker after everything else had been added. But otherwise followed the recipe exactly! So yummy, will make again and again

We enjoyed this easy dinner served over brown rice.  I did think it was a little too salty, even though I used reduced sodium soy sauce.  Next time, I will omit the 1 tsp. of salt, since the bouillon and soy sauce make it salty enough.

I continue to search for a GREAT slow cooker meal but have yet to find it.  Here's a tip:  don't cut your beef as thinly as you might for a stir fry dish because mine ended up looking like spanish/cuban ropa vieja (shredded beef).  I cooked this on low for five hours, but I think this may have been done in about three hours.  If you happen to be home, just check on it periodically.  It doesn't taste bad, but I probably won't be making this again.

My whole family loves this recipe.  I like to mix it up sometimes. I follow the same recipe but sometimes I use half the peppers asked for and add mushrooms or add broccoli.

This was amazing! I followed the recipe exactly.  I took the advice of others and added a little more corn starch towards the end of the cooking time in order to make the gravy a little thicker.  This was the first time in a while that I finished all of the leftovers!  Will make again.

Amazing! I used beef broth instead of beef bouillon because that is what I had, but then followed the recipe. My husband licked the crock pot clean, he loved it and so did my 5 & 2 year old kids. Thanks!

Loved this recipe.  I served it over white rice and it was great! Next time, I might half the salt and add cornstarch to thicken the sauce, but other than that, I will not change a thing.  Will make this again...for sure!

Delish!! I found as I was putting it all in the crock that I was out of beef bouillon...So I used brown gravy mix. 2tblsp. I also added worcestershire and brown sugar instead of white sugar. My husband LOVED it. We had it with rice. Will definately be making this again! OH...we had a chuck roast already, so I chunked that up & used it instead of sirloin. BEAUTIFUL!

This was an amazing dish!  I love dishes that you can throw together and forget until later....this one was right up my alley!  I didn't brown the meat before adding it to the slow cooker and didn't see any ill effects because of it.  I also added a few teaspoons of Worst. sauce when I added the soy sauce.  I agree with those of you that said to wait and add the peppers and onion later.  I don't want them too mushy.  I usually add them when it has about 2 hours left.  Thanks for a great recipe.

My boyfriend absolutly LOVES this. He asks me to make it as often as possible. I always just buy the stir fry steak already cut into strips to make it easier. Sometimes I don't bother searing the steak first, to save time. It turns out fine but the meat breaks apart more.

I loved everything about this recipe except the sirloin steak. It was very tough & dried out. I think next time I am going to use a english roast & instead.

Excellent recipe! I doubled the recipe for our family of 5 and had no leftovers! I also added more vidalia onion (sweet), red peppers and mushrooms. I par boiled baby white potatos and added them during the  last 1/2 hour to the crock pot. Cooked on high for a total of 3 1/2 hours and the steak melted in your mouth! Nice mild flavor. Next time I will do the same and serve over noodles!

LOVE this dish, it is our new family favorite!  I do wait until it is almost done (30 - 45mins left on low) to add the green peppers to avoid mushy peppers.

Awesome meal! The only thing that I changed is I used brown sugar instead of white. It took 6 hours in the slow cooker on low! Turned out great and I served it over white rice. Will make again for sure!

Soooooooo good.  This tasted amazing.  I left the green peppers in for the whole time, but I like the peppers less crisp for this kind of thing.  We served it on rice and it was delicious.  I will be making this for many, many years to come.

Just have to give my 2 cents worth to the reviews.  This is one of the best "cook friendly" recipe I have found.  I kept the sauce the same--but doubled it.  I found no need to add other ingredients.  Added vegetable items that needed a better place to be from the fridge.  MOST FOR SURE add the peppers no more than 1 hour before hand.  Cannot believe a slow-cooker recipe is this good--and loved by all.  Add what you want, but this is best left alone.  Forgot to add that instead of corn starch to thicken, I added Wondra flower 1 table spoon at a time until it was as thick as I wanted it to be.  Love Wondra flour---and I don't sell it.

This was AMAZING! I used another reviewer's advice and seasoned the beef with a little bit of Adobo seasoning (with pepper) and added crushed red pepper for a little kick. Also, I omitted the last tsp of salt because there was plenty of salt with the canned tomatoes, soy sauce, and seasoning. My only suggestion is to be very careful with the salt! I served it over minute rice that I cooked in chicken broth. Highly recommend this recipe! Will make it again!!

Cooked long and tender.  The meat was so tender that I had an immediate association with a pot roast yet the flavor was completely and uniquely that of pepper steak.

Made this for my family and they loved it...made these changes...I had a frozen sirloin steak that was marinating in red wine vinegar, garlic and soy sauce.  Left out the soy sauce when cooking...added crushed tomatoes instead of stewed my husband doesn't like tomato pieces...added the peppers an hour before eating as I like them crisper...delicious...a new fave at our house.

Enjoyed it!  A little too salty though.  Next time I will leave out the salt and cut back on the soy sauce to maybe 2 tablespoons instead of 3.

this was okay, not a lot of pepper steak flavor in my opinion
heated up leftovers from the freezer and month later and liked it a lot more- maybe expectations werent high but it was tasty!

This was different than i expected, but the meat came out tender and had a pretty good flavor.  I used 1/2 T more cornstarch to thicken up the sauce and sliced the green pepper to make them look pretty.  If you like a firmer pepper, hold off till the last 30 min; I only cooked the peppers for about 35 min on low, and they were more than done.  I also threw in 2 cloves of smashed garlic.  Served with white rice.  Good, just not the pepper steak i was looking for.

I was a little nervous about the tomatoes (I used a can of diced tomatoes), but the prevalent flavor was still the soy sauce (which I wanted).  After it cooked for about 2 hours, the sauce was thick and bubbly, which I liked, but it got much runnier as it kept cooking (maybe from the peppers added at the end?), so I would add 1-2 more Tablespoons of cornstarch next time.  I sliced the onion put in half with the meat, and half with the peppers later.  Put in the peppers at the end for best results (they would probably fully cook in an hour on low).  Overall delicious!  This will be made again!

This is a great recipe I will make it again, as others said seasoning really need to be doubled not that much flavor. add the peppers at the very end and cornstrach for thicker gravy.

Very tasty!  I used one each of red, yellow and green bell peppers.  As some reviews have previous said, add the peppers for the last 2-3 hours of cooking, otherwise they'll be mush.  Serve with white, brown or fried rice.

Meat was very tender but lacked a WOW flavor for me.  Tasted like my swiss steak I make.  Was hoping for more of a "chinese" taste.  Kids loved it though!

This recipe does not require a slow cooker unless your beef is tough. I had it on 2 hours less than it said and it was over done. The flavor was great, but next time, I'll just cook it on the stove using fajita strips.

This was so good and easy to make.  The only change I made was to leave out the salt.  Thought there would be plenty in the soy sauce. Next time I think I will double the liquid.  This is one of my favorite recipes!!

This recipe is AMAZING!  It is so easy and quick to prepare.  My boyfriend loves it and asks me to make it all the time.  I served it at a dinner party once and got asked by almost everyone for the recipe.  I always use our rice cooker and serve it over a bed of rice...so good!  I have used several different cuts of meat for this, like New York strips (and a better cut of meat just improves upon a recipe that really doesn't need improving).  I was out of soy sauce once and substituted worcestershire sauce instead.  That tasted great too!  Thanks sooooo much for this recipe.

I made this today, also using the precut sirloin strips from my grocery store. I also used one each red,yellow and green pepper for some color. Not sure if my brand of stewed tomatoes lacked liquid or what but I had to add quite a bit more liquid... I just disolved some more bouillon and cornstarch and tossed it in and a bit more soy sauce too. I shared it with my parents and actually got a call saying it was excellent and a keeper for sure. I think I may try it with chicken strips too. Served mine with some rice and it was perfect although I could have justeaten it plain and been happy too.

This was good, but salty (and I didn't add the 1 tsp salt). I left out the peppers as I dion't want them to get bitter and then I wan't home intime to add them. I ended up serving over rice, with stir fried broccoli on the side. I also didn't brown the meat as I was in a rush. I will make in this some form again.

next time (note i said there will be a next time) i'll use less soy sauce, for it was a little overpowering. the sauce was a little too thin, so maybe more cornstarch is in order. i was too late to use the slow cooker so i cooked it in a 325 oven for two hours and it turned out very well.

Love this recipe.  I have made it twice and it is delicious.  The soy sauce and the garlic salt is enough sodium.  You really do not need to add the 1 tsp of salt.

We did not care for this recipe.  I think the stewed tomatoes ruined the flavor for me and made it too much like an average beef stew.

This was really really good! My husband could not stop eating it! I also bought beef that was already cut up from the grocery store to save some time in the morning. I read quite a few reviews so I would know what to expect and here is what I did. I seasoned the meat very generously with Slap Ya Momma (a cajun seasoning from where I live in Louisiana) and put it straight into the crockpot without browning it. I doubled the bouillion cube and water and I set it on low for about 9 hours (without the peppers) and left for work. When I got home I added a little bit of beef broth to make a little bit more gravy and another tablespoon of cornstarch and a ton more seasoning because it was pretty bland. I continued to let it sit on high until we were ready to eat. When I put the rice cooking that is when I added the peppers, I used green, red and yellow to add color. When the rice was done the peppers were perfect, just the right amount of crunch. Yummy! I will definitely be making this again. Here in Louisiana rice and gravy is a staple at the dinner table, my mother cooked it every night when I was growing up. It was really nice to be able to have something very similar without all the effort and added oils and fats.

Served over rice, nice thick gravy, tender and delicious. I used a tri-tip roast sliced up only because I did not have sirloin. Even better left over.

We LOVE this!  I skip the step of browning the meat first.  I just put the meat into the slow cooker and then follow the remaining directions.  Didn't use the oil.  Used a little less soy sauce so it wasn't too salty.

This was divine!! The only thing I will do differently next time is saute the peppers in a pan seperately, because they left too strong a pepper taste when I put them in the slow cooker towards the end. I also added small whole mushrooms.

I made this tonight for my family. The ONLY variation I made was I was forced to cook it in a low oven ( 250-300)....I added my onions and peppers the last 45 minutes and they kept their consistancy. I also tripled the sauce as we are huge sauce eaters with our rice dishes. All in all it came out great! I would not use as many tomatoes the next time and just increase the beef broth mixture....possibly adding some french onion in there. A bit toooo many tomatoes if you choose to double or triple..they DO cook down, however I would have rather experienced the BEEF flavor and not so much tomatoe. Thanks for a workable recipe!!! It's a keeper!! I will make it again and tweak it to mine and my family's personal preferance.

This is a great recipe, I've been using a very similar one for almost 17 years. I use 3 cloves of fresh minced garlic, a few red pepper flakes, and add the peppers two hours before the dish is finished. Instead of sugar, I have always used dark molasses. It adds a great depth to the dish as well as serves as a thickening agent!

We loved this! Used 1 T. soy sauce, 2 T. worcestershire sauce, and 4 garlic cloves instead of garlic powder. Just threw everything in the crock pot and cooked it all day. Would definitely recommend putting the peppers in later on in the day so they don't get too mushy.  Served over white rice. This was great!

It was pretty good.  Something different.  Do add the peppers later.  I didn't and they were mushy.

Very good...I used salt reduced soy sauce and we found it plenty salty...never added the additional salt. Only used one green pepper. While I was browning the meat, I added the onion for browning. It smelled wonderful while cooking!!

This was an excellent recipe!! I only made one change to this recipe. I added the peppers two hours before it was done in order to keep them from getting mushy.

I didn't even bother with the browning in oil part and saved those calories as well!  Just threw everything in the crockpot and let it cook away.  I did use the Italian seasoned stewed tomatoes as another reviewer suggested. Good idea! Also did 1 red, 1 green pepper. Next time I will try this with Rotel Original Tomatoes and see how it tastes with more hot type spice.

The flavor of this dish was okay, but it was my opinion that cooking the peppers in the slow cooker made them too soft.  Maybe my expections were too high, as I was expecting more of a traditional chinese flavor.

This did not work for my family. It was edible, but that's about as far as I'll go. With so many reviewers liking this, I'm wondering if I did something wrong, but the meat was tough and overcooked. I think that after I cut it into strips and browned it, it just didn't need 6 more hours of cooking. It might have been better if I'd just stuck with the skillet and thrown the veggies and sauce right in. The green pepper certainly didn't do well after 6 hours in a slow cooker. They were kind of gross. This also needed a lot more flavor. I added a bucket of salt at the end.

Excellent!  My husband and I enjoyed this for dinner one night and had the leftovers for lunch the next day.  This is a recipe I will definitely make again.  The only thing I would change would be a little less salt.  There is enough salt in the soy sauce that 1 teaspoon of salt is a little much for my personal taste; maybe half a teaspoon is enough.  But this is very easy and delicious!  I'm passing this recipe on to my friends.

Very good recipe, and easy. Made and served over rice and the whole family loved it. Usually my wife won't eat anything with green pepper in it, however she liked this.

Great recipe
Thanks for sharing

This had an okay flavor.  It tasted more like beef stew and less like a pepper steak.  I was hoping it would have more of a Chinese flavor but it didn't.

I went with the advice of other reviews and added some minced garlic. Wow! This dish was awesome.  The meat was very tender and had a great flavor.  I didnt add the soy sauce or the tomato's but only cause I didnt have it. The only difference I will make the next time I cook it is to add only 2 peppers instead of 3.  It was a little bit too much.  I will definitly be making this again.  :)

This was very bland.  I doubled the sauce and added more pepper as other reviewers suggested, but the flavor still wasn't anything spectacular.  The beef did come out very tender, but my husband declared it to be "a beef stew wanna-be," and I had to agree.  Next time, I'll just put in a little extra-effort and make beef-stew instead .

We really enjoyed this recipe. I followed the directions exactly, but added some minced garlic (around 2 tsps. )I cooked it on low for 6 hours, but I think it would have been ready in 5...I took some cool water, added about 1 tsp. cornstarch mixed it together and then put into the pot to thicken the sauce about a half hour before the time was up. I served it over rice and it was delicious! I think next time, I'll only cook for 5 hours and add the peppers about half way through since I do like them soft.Thanks for the recipe.

It's delicious with a few changes. I used 2 cups of low sodium beef broth since I didn't want to add a can of tomatoes (just didn't seem right in the recipe), used a large onion, red bell pepper, no sugar, added worcestershire sauce, low sodium soy sauce and black pepper - it needs pepper. Had to add a little extra cornstarch at the end to get gravy thickness to our liking, absolutely delicious on rice or a cooked potato.

I double the sauce as recommended. I did not like the stewed tomatoes. I think next time I will add only the juice from the tomatoes, and add more pepper and potatoes cut up. Had good flavor, but picked around tomatoes. Will make again, but different.

My 12 yr old step daughter said, "I don't eat steak."  I said, "Why, it's really good!"  She said, "It's too tough, it hurts my braces when I chew."  Her dad said, "Not THIS steak, it melts in your mouth!"  She ate it, asked for more. End of story.  THANKS!

Very good and easy recipe-I added minced garlic to the pot along with the other ingredients and used diced tomatoes rather than stewed.  I also added the peppers about an hour before the ending cook time to keep them more crisp. The sauce was a bit runny for my taste but I added a bit more cornstarch and let the mixture cook for about thirty more miutes-  turned out perfect and was accompanied with basmati rice and a side salad

I thought this was ok, i followed the directions perfectly. But i just dont think steak is a good meat for the slowcooker. After it was done, it had that boiled steak texture and flavor. I love steak tender, but also with that seared flavor. I added the bells and onions for the last hour, and they werent soggy.  I think next time i will do this in the wok instead for that nice crispy, but tender steak.  But the flavor was good.

My family went nuts over this dish.   I don't eat red meat, but it sure smelled great all day cooking!!!  I did add more meat than was called for (about a 4lb. roast cut up).  That still wasn't enough!  Three guys devoured this in about 1/2 hour.  Next time I will tripple the recipe so they can have some leftovers.  I served it over wide egg noodles.  My husband couldn't stop telling me how much he was enjoying this as he ate.  I will keep this one as a regular...thank you!

I used the canned petite-diced tomatoes that had garlic included.  Also substituted in some red peppers for different taste and color, but more importantly, waited until the last hour to add the peppers.  Served with rice, and was delicious.  Will make again!

Absolutely delicious.  I doubled the sauce ingredients because I knew I was going to serve this over Basamati rice.  I added the pepper and a whole onion right away and the pepper consistency was perfect. I too, like other members suggested, added Worsteschirer sauce.   I also added some sliced baby bella mushrooms since I had some in fridge I needed to use up.  My husband has already requested that I make this again next weekend when we have company over!!

This was amazing over jasmine rice...I will be making this again for sure...add the peppers closer to the end if you don't want them to be soggy! They cooked for a little over an hour in my crockpot towards the end, they were awesome.

The peppers are very mushy if you put them in at the start, but that doesn't bother us.  I use the stir fry meat which is already cut up to save time and do not precook it.  The reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is that I usually add extra stuff at the end to give it more flavor, often a gravy packet and some garlic salt.  It is a little bland as is and I feel it needs more flavor, but it is very easy to fix up.

This recipe is yummy!  The flavor is perfect, the meat is extremely tender, and it is easy to put together.  My only alterations- I omitted the salt, put the green peppers in for the last 2 hours to avoid mushy texture, added extra cornstarch at the end and let it sit for another 1/2 hour. I did a slow cook for 6 hours, but it was actually done before then.  I served it over japanese rice.  Next time I'm tempted to add other vegetables (carrots, celery, potatoes).

This was wonderful!! I used broth instead of the water as others mentioned and also used two 1 lb steaks that I left whole and sliced when finished cooking.  The meat was so tender and yummy.

Used Tri Tip instead of sirloin, one red and one green bell peppers ( for color )and cut into strips rather than chopped. Was a little too salty, so next time will cut salt in half. Also was a little too much sauce, so will try a little less water. It is definitly a keeper. Thanks Marge.

SUPER easy and so good!  I took the advice of other reviews and kept the peppers out until the end and thickened up the sauce before serving.  YUMMY!

very good flavor.  I didn't pre-cook the beef and I used a can of beef broth instead of the bouillon.  I cut everything up the night before and mixed all ingredients together in a large bowl except the peppers and onions and marinated overnight in the fridge.  The next morning before work I mixed the peppers and onions with the beef mixture and put in the crockpot.  Served with mashed potatoes althought rice or noodles would go with this dish as well.  Thanks.

Very good, made some changes based on others review. Did not pre cook sirlon, used about 2 1/2 lbs, cut into bit sized chunks. Cut the onion and green pepper in very large pieces and cut up smaller when I thickend the sauce, 30 minutes before eating. Used whole tomatoes crushed up by hand, also increased Boullion cubes to 2, and mixed up in 1/2 cup very hot water, added 6 tbsp of low sodium soy, left out the added salt, added red pepper flakes, small can of green chilies, 3 cloves of crushed garlic, splash of Worcestershire sauce, and fresh ground pepper, came out great. Meat was very tender and peppers were soft but not mushy. Used 3 tbsp Corn starch in 1/2 cup cold water to thicken sauce. Started on high about an hour and finished on low, total cook time about 6 hours. Served over white rice.

I don't understand the hype about this recipe! I tasted it when it was almost done, and it was a bit bland, so I added more garlic and ginger. It was still a bit bland when done, and the beef, although falling apart, was still a bit tough. Not a bad recipe, but not a great one. What did I do wrong? (I used sirloin tip strips and low-salt everything)

I'm a crock pot junkie.  Been using one for over 30 years.  This is a great recipe.  The only thing different I would use would be a can of crushed tomatoes.  Love your site.

L o v e d   t h i s   r e  c i p e! Great flavor and minimal prep for those working days. I just made some instant (I like the healthier brown)rice and stir fryed some veggies (pea pods, onion, mushrooms, and green peppers) when I got home from work. THANK YOU, FOR THIS ONE. WILL USE AGAIN AND AGAIN!

My husband hates pepper steak but I love it.  The only changes I make is to use 99% fat free beef broth in place of boullion and water and omit salt as there is plenty in the beef broth.  I really enjoyed this.  Thanks for the post.

I didn't have time one day to make this in the crock pot.  It sounded so good I decided to try a stove top version.  It wasn't as easy as the crock pot method but still worth the little extra effort.  You can cook the vegetables to your liking without them being overcooked as some reviewers reported.  I will definately make it again.  My husband and sons devoured it!  I wouldn't hesitate to make it on the stove again, although would like to try it in the crock pot some day.

This was a hit.  I'm lucky enough to have pure grass fed Wyoming beef -- which helps.  I sprinkled a little lemon pepper on the sirloin along with the garlic poweder and used 1 red and one green pepper; sliced the onions instead of chopping.

Don't be thrown off by negative reviews - just change to suit your own taste.  I didn't brown the meat at all and only used about 1 Tblsp of soy sauce and no extra salt - I don't like salty food - and it was really, really good.  I love cooking things all day so I don't have to fuss too much at suppertime and this was perfect.  I really recommend this recipe.

So simple & yet sooo good.
I used moose meat.I only had vegie powder broth, but it was good any way. I also used two big quartered onions(we like onion), and 4 garlic bulbs.
Next time (and there will be a next time)I will not add the salt & will add another two peppers(red?) 1/2 way thru the cooking time(the peppers do get very soft, but I think it adds to the flavour). I cooked on high for four hours & served with jasmine rice.

I made this recipe today.....Followed the advice of other reviewers for a few things...Used beef broth instead of the cube. Used a full onion, diced tomatoes instead of stewed, and tri-color peppers. Added more garlic powder and a little seasoning salt. It definitely tends to cook fast, so I had to switch it to low. My husband loved it! I thought it was good too....I am sure we will make this one again.

This smells so good as it cooks!  I did as other reviewers suggested and put half the peppers in at the end so they would not be as mushy. I cut my meat while it was still slightly frozen because it slices easier. I used a whole onion and 2 cans of beef broth and doubled the cornstarch to make it thicker. I also omitted the salt because of all the other salty ingredients. Served over steamed rice. Yummy!

Love It! Love It!  Even my picky eater 3 yr old son loved it.  Very easy to make. I didn't have any canned stewed tomatoes, so I got an easy one right off Allrecipes.   I didn't have any sirloin on hand, so I used my top round london broil, cut into strips. Cooked for 2 hours on high, and 4 hours on low.  I did cut down the soy sauce by 1/2 tsp. I served it over rice, and I'm adding this one on the recipe book. It's a true keeper!

This was good, but it didn't wow me. The soy sauce taste was harsher than I expected. I used three colors of peppers, which made it visually appealing. Also used miced garlic instead of powder, leeks instead of onions, and diced tomatoes instead of stewed. I'll probably make it again, though I won't race to do so.

This recipe is outstanding! I read almost every review and added red pepper flakes for kick, mushrooms because I like them, and put the green peppers in during the last two hours. I didn't brown the beef and used fresh garlic. I will make this recipe again and again!

Wonderful recipe.... the meat was very tender. I think it needed a little bit more of a kick though. I will definetely make again but will add more seasonings.

GREAT recipe... my only modification was to use 1/2 can fat free/reduced sodium beef broth instead of the boullion (which is so high in sodium) and I didn't pre-cook the beef as per the other poster's feedback it wasn't necessary... came out awesome... will definitely make this again.

Considering the soy sauce and salt in the recipe, it was still a little bland by the time I served it over rice.  It is tasty and will make again, but will add more soy sauce.  I used 2 Tbs. cornstarch and next time will try 3 Tbs.  Also, I cooked it without the peppers for 5 hours then added them and cooked it 2 hours more.  Their texture was perfect.  A great slow-cooker meal.

*Outstanding (Note the extra star). The strips of steak were fork-tender. Because I don't care much for soy sauce I used plenty of garlic salt instead. I served this on a fluffy bed of rice. I will make this again!

My husband was begging for pepper steak.  Personally, I had never had it.  I picked this recipe for the simplicity & also the description made it sound good.  He absolutely loved it and is begging for more.  Not only that, but it sure made a pepper steak fan out of me, too!  Yum!

This recipe needed a bit of "doctoring".  I added a packet of Lipton "Beefy Onion" soup mix and used fresh garlic instead of the powder.  I took the advice of others and waited to add the peppers till the last hour or so. It turned out pretty good, but not great. I think a bay leaf or two might help to improve the taste.

Awesome flavor.  I had always stayed away from any recipe with green peppers (hate them on pizza) but the flavor of this dish is phenomenal!!  I gave this recipe to my Mom who thought it was the best pepper steak recipe she had ever had.  This is definitely a classic and will be in my family forever.

My family flipped over this one. Yes, I thought it was good but my family found this to be outta this world. I used sirloin tip roast but followed the recipe to the letter. We served over white rice and a side of baked pototoes (I know...lots of starch with this meal:)) For the most part, I didn't change a thing and the meat was very flavorful and tender. Best of all: a no-hassel meal! Thanks Marge.

This did not come out as I expected.  I thought the tomatos would cook away more and it would have more of a Chinese food flavor than it did.  It tasted good if you are looking for a recipe for a pot roast or something like that, but for pepper steak, I've had better.

This was great!!! Changed a few things... used about 3lbs of sirloin, used 2 cans of italian style stewed tomatoes and blended in blender for just a few pulses and added some crushed red peppers as we like it spicy!!  Also instead of green peppers I used 1 red, 1 orange and one yellow pepper. Thickened a little right before serving over fresh mashed potatoes!!!!!  Just wonderful!!!!

I liked it, my husband didn't.  The peppers were too soft.  Maybe I will add them later in cooking time and a little more spices for more flavor.

This was a pleasant surprise.  Very tasty and so simple.  I added 2 sliced jalepenos and a few shakes of worstershire sauce.  I agree with another reviewer that the green peppers got a bit mushy.  Add the peppers mid-way through the cooking time.  (or later if you like them more crisp.)

I couldn't believe how much this dish smelled and looked like pepper steak from a Chinese restaurant, with one exception..it was BETTER! It was sooo tender. We added mushrooms and left the onions in big chunks. Next time I may add the green peppers halfway into the cooking time; they were a little too tender. Overall, awesome recipe!!!

This recipe is AMAZING! The only changes I made were added 2 onions instead of a half onion. Also added an extra colorful bell pepper. My family gobbled it up! Wish I would have doubled! I cooked on low for 8 hours and added the peppers at around 6 hours and they were perfect.

Very tasty! I used low sodium soy sauce, left out the salt, honey instead of sugar. Used multi-colored peppers which added a variety of taste as well as looking good. Will make again, for sure. Thank you!

I didn't need two green peppers but added a red one to it and it was delicious! the meat was so tender, and I will definitely be making this again. We had it over long grain rice and added the chinese crispy noodles. It's a keeper!

Great flavor. I made a few changes. Did not brown meat, cooked on low for 10hrs. Used 1/4 cp organic. beef broth rather than cube.   Used regular can tomatoes so doubled sugar. I also added fresh button mushrooms. I rubbed the meat with Lawry’s seasoning, then added garlic, black pepper & salt. Serving over rice.

Too much salt as written There really is no need to add in the 1t.  of  salt, even if using low sodium soy sauce. If you choose to use low sodium soy, keep in mind that sugar is substituted for salt in many low sodium products.  I recommend changing the bouillon to low sodium beef broth, or stock. appx 1 cup ish and then u can skip the water  , . Like many others, I add in more peppers, cut in strips and put them in during the last hour or so
.Sometimes, for a more Italian  version, I like to use Delmonte's diced tomatoes  with basil, oregano, and garlic. & sub the soy for Worcestershire. and a pinch or 2 Italian herb blend. plus a small squirt of tomato paste ( from a tube)  Then serve them on toasted or grilled sub rolls with a slice  of provolone.  Both versions are  very good. Just too much salt in the original  recipe as written.

Excellent recipe! I stayed pretty close to the recipe, but just expanded it. We love onions so I used one large yellow onion. I also used three bell peppers (orange, red, and green) that I added the last two hours of cooking as other reviewers suggested. I also added a tablespoon of grated ginger, and three large carrots. The recipe was a great starting point, and the flavor delicious!

This dish turned out great and was fairly quick and easy to make.  I did not use oil when browning the beef and I omitted the sugar just to make the dish a little healthier.  My family loved the tasted of the sauce!  Tasted great served over brown rice and/or riced cauliflower.  Definitely a keeper!!

My husband is still raving a week later, asking when we'll have it again. Super easy to make, and I had all but ginger on hand. Easy to put together, smells DIVINE.  Going to become a favorite, go-to meal, I can tell.

This was really good and easy. Served over rice and added a red and yellow pepper at the end for about 45 minutes as the other reviews suggested. Will definitely make again.   I did add a little extra water at the end since there was not to much sauce.

DEEEELICIOUS! Always skeptical of slow cooker recipes because not too many are exceptional, they usually taste like slow cooker meals. This on the other hand does not. It is so flavorful and perfect over rice. Followed the recipe to the T and I will be making it again.

Easy and delicious! I added the bell peppers the last hour. Next time I may sauté the onions before adding. Either way, I served this with red skinned mashed potatoes and portioned out left overs to the freezer to devour later!

Delicious!  We did not sugar and it did not need it at all.  We used the noodles and loved it.  We put the peppers in at the beginning as the recipe suggests.  This was easy and mmmmm ssssoooo good.  We will make this again and again for family and friends.

We are always looking for something new in our house to eat.  The steak was very tender, but there was just not enough flavor in this one for us.  It had a very strong tomato taste.  Definitely add the peppers the last 30 minutes or so.  I added them with about an hour to go and they got very mushy.  Would need to find a way to alter the flavor in order to make this again.

This was just okay.  I can't pinpoint one reason I didn't love it, perhaps just my tastes.  I did follow the recommendations and added the peppers in the last hour.

I had this recipe in my folder for years and never made it until two nights ago.  Wow!  Wonderful flavor, moist beef, super easy.  This goes into the folder of reliable week night staples.  Next time, I will serve it with crusty bread to soak up the juices!!

I thought this was good. It's definitely a high sodium recipe. The sirloin came out tender and flavorful. I just now realized that the big mistake I made was that I threw the bell peppers and onion in all day instead of just at the end, so I missed that extra flavor and crunch. But that's my mistake, not the person who created the recipe. I did add rice to go with it. My husband loved it so much, he finished off the leftovers for lunch today, which is rare, so it's worth repeating!

Very good...so tender and quite easy so I'll make this again for sure! I read the reviews and made adjustments accordingly: I used minced garlic (1 tsp.), reduced the water to 2 Tbsp because I used a 19 oz can of diced tomatoes, besides the green pepper I added 1/2 of a red pepper, omitted the salt adding ground black pepper, and then I increased the cornstarch to a heaping tablespoon. In the end,  the sauce was just the right consistency and went very well with the wild rice served with it. Yum!

We ended up making another 1 tablespoon slurry at the end of the cooking with the liquid in the slow cooker. This made it perfect for us. We will definitely be making this again. Can't wait for leftovers tomorrow night!

This was really delicious!!  The flavors were incredible and the meat was extremely tender.  As suggested by other reviewers, I used brown sugar instead of white and also added 2 cloves of minced garlic and a dash of Worcestershire sauce, but omitted the salt.  I used a combination of yellow, green, and sweet red pepper strips which gave the dish beautiful color.   Served with mashed potatoes and steamed green beans, it made a very satisfying meal.

Excellent!  My kids really liked this, too.  I followed directions exactly and also added a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce.  Served over noodles the first night and over rice the next (I liked it better over rice).  Will make again.  Thank you.

Added two tablespoons of Worcestershire. Used  three minced garlic cloves instead of powder. No salt. Used three cups of beef broth instead of bouillon cube. Had to add extra corn starch. Sliced red and green bell peppers and added three hours into cooking on high. Served on a bed of white rice.  Make sure to use reduced sodium soy sauce.

This was very good, and we enjoy this any time of the year over some rice.  To offset the saltiness many have commented about,  I used low sodium broth (boullion) & low sodium soy sauce, as they are both very salty on their own, and omitted the 1 t salt. I did not brown the meat first - just another pan to clean, and this step is not necessary.  I also put 3-4 slices of bell pepper in the beginning, then add the rest during the last hour of cooking so at least the flavoring is evident during the entire cook time, but you eliminate the mushy peppers when serving.  Awesome recipe!

I seasoned the beef with Onion Powder, Garlic Powder, and black pepper. I also omitted the salt since soy sauce has enough in it and it was delicious! Recommend this dish to anyone who enjoys these ingredients.

It was very good. I added extra soy sauce and about a teaspoon of ground ginger to give a little bit more of an Asian flare. Husband gave it his seal of approval and kids all had seconds! Will definitely make it again.

This is a fantastic recipe! Steak was falling apart after just 3 hours in the crock pot on high. I did find it slightly salty but the whole family loved it! We will be making this again with absolutely no changes necessary to the original recipe!

Add half a teaspoon red pepper, dash of Worcestershire, fresh minced garlic, and peppers 2 hours before serving. Additional cornstarch if needed.

Great recipe! I had bottom round so I used that,  cut instead into 1" strips. I seasoned it with Montreal steak seasinong while browning. 
Since I was out of soy sauce, I used 2 Tbsp A1 and 2Tbsp worcestershire sauce instead. I also used double the amount of peppers, a combo of red, green and yellow.  
I would suggest waiting to add the peppers until you have only 1 1/2-2 hours of cooking time left. That's what I did and they bordered on being overcooked. I can only imagine the peppers completely breaking down if you add them at the beginning.
This was fantastic and my family absolutely LOVED it--22 month old, 14 year old and husband devoured it, speaking their praise in grunts of satisfaction. I will be making this again.

the flavor of the dish was fantastic but like others, it had the 'slow cooker' taste. In addition, I think my slow cooker cooks hot because everything was mushy even though I put peppers, etc. in later. I will DEFINITELY make it again but will try simmering it on the stovetop instead of the slow cooker. Thank you for the recipe idea!

Honestly, I was NOT expecting to love this as much as I do. I *like* peppers but don't *love* them, but in this recipe all the flavors are amazing! Very easy to put together, which is nice on busy days. Just threw it all in the slow cooker, stirred a few times and it was done. My husband mixed his with egg noodles but I had mine just by itself, it was sort of like a stew. I'll definitely be making this more often.

Very tasty but I would either use a cheaper cut or cut down the cooking time as the steak almost disintegrated.  But having said that we still really enjoyed the recipe.

Delicious and tender steak. I put in the peppers and onions about an hour before eating to keep them from getting too mushy. Turned out great, served over white rice. My girlfriend and her daughter loved it too.

I thought the flavor was fantastic, and it was even better as leftovers.  Next time I will cook it for less time so the steak doesn't dry out, and I think I'll try making it a beef stew by adding some potatoes, and adding some rice right to the crockpot for the last 30 min.

No substitutions. Should have called this "Tomato steak" because that's all you taste at the end of the day. That and salt. The sauce didn't thicken up very much considering the added corn starch, and the lack of liquid caused some scorching. Don't shell out for top sirloin for this.

I used the stir fry beef strips that some people suggested, but I think that if I made this again, I will take the time and slice my own meat. Everything tasted really good, but the strips just seemed strange and out of place in pepper steak.

Very tasty. But the prep time was much longer for me. If you can find pre-cut strips of steak and veggies, it may not be a hassle, but it was certainly not the quick and easy recipe I'd read about. It is definitely worth the effort. Just be sure and allow time at the cutting board/stove before it goes in the crock pot.

Just made this and decided to stop eating and write this review. This recipe is great. I did change a few things like using beef for stir fry as was told in other reviews. I also added a bit of black paper and some adobo (Goya seasoning) at the end. Also didn't add the peppers until almost the end since a like them a bit firm. Overall great recipe.

A dish that is better served as left overs. Will choose a thicker sirloin next time and cut against the grain as some reviews have suggested.

Juice and tender as promised! Following the suggestions of others, I used yellow and a green pepper to mix things up, and finished with scallions before serving.  I served with egg noodles tossed in light olive oil and dried parsley.  Delicious!

Absolutely one of my favorite crock pot recipes.  I make exactly as directions state except occasionally add more peppers as we love peppers.  Try not to overcook, unfortunately I did this the first time and the meat completely feel apart and it was more like pepper steak mush but even still...it was delicious anyway!  We serve over white rice.  Thanks for the recipe!

I loved this recipe.  I had about 8 small peppers left from my grow this summer and they were perfect to use.  I am having leftovers tonight and I have some pineapple rings left over from Christmas ham and I am going to put them in when I heat this up, also I will thicken the sauce a little more.  Served over rice, it was delicious!

Pretty tasty dish. However, the dish did not have a strong Asian flavor that I hoped for. It reminded me of a spin on regular Pot Roast. May make it again in the future.

It is easy and delicious, and I followed the recipe except that I put the peppers in the last couple of hours and they were still mushy, so I might put them in for an hour next time.  If your looking for a pleasing crockpot dinner this is a good one served over white rice or mash taters

Made this today for dinner and we all loved it. I added fresh mushrooms just because I had them in the fridge. Delicious! Perfect for a cold Ohio night!

I made this for a family who just had a baby and everyone (including the picky dad and 3 year old) loved it. I added the peppers at the end. The meat completely fell apart so there was a little texture lacking for me but I was still happy with it in the end. I will make it again.

Very good but way too salty as listed. I even used unsalted tomatoes and didn't add all the salt it asked for. I will make this again but minding the sodium :)

Made it for Sunday's dinner. Very easy to make, its nothing extra ordinary but it is a good meal to make for the family. If I make it again I'll probably add another beef cube for flavor. Maybe a dash of cracked pepper to make it pop. Also, I added my bell peppers and tomatoes during the last hour of cooking to avoid it cooking to much and turning into mush.

So good!  But kids didn't like of course.  Serves with brown basmati rice.
Added green peppers at the beginning and that was just fine.

I made this recipe exactly as it calls and it turned out great.  I served it over long grain rice.  Especially pleased with how tender the steak turned out, and not at all dry, a problem I've had with other slow-cooker recipes.  Best part was watching my 2 year old devour not just 1 but 2 servings.  This is a keeper for my busy family.

I used fresh garlic and fresh tomatoes, no sugar, beef consume, a little extra soy sauce and cornstarch. Oh and of course, more sirloin strips. This slow cooker recipe was great! I usually make it on the stove top, but it was easier and the meat was more tender this way. I'll be using the slow cooker for this recipe from now on.

Very disappointed in this. Followed the recipe exactly and although it tasted okay, it was not at all a traditional pepper steak that it appears. In my opinion it tastes like beef stew. I'm not a fan of stew. :(

This recipe has good flavor however, I think it just tasted like stuffed peppers, which I expected it to taste more like a chinese dish. Next time I make it, I would cook it for less time because my meat just fell apart.

This has some excellent flavours and I have made it on more than one occasion. Once it is all cooked through I transfer the sauce to a shallow frying pan and reduce the liquid. I like to make big batches to freeze to heat up on lazy days.

Very good recipe.  I substituted rice vinegar for the white and used red bell peppers instead of green.  I did add more salt and pepper when it was all finished because the flavors were kind of flat, that helped a lot.  Turned out great served over Jasmine Rice.

Well, I think the other reviewers have said it perfectly!! This is a must~make! I didn't have but a teaspoon left of soy sauce in the fridge, so I added plenty of extra worchestershire sauce to taste. Delicious! Bottom line, I don't think u can mess this recipe up its that easy!

EXCELLENT...!!!!!   Suggest freezing the sirloin for an hour or 2 and then slicing it....easier when semi frozen.

It was OKAY overall. It was nothing like how I expected it. Very tomatoey tasting which I wasn't too pleased about. IF I made this dish again I'd leave out the salt altogether (it was EXTREMELY SALTY!), and as other members said I would add the peppers and onions much later in the cooking process to keep them a little crisper. I added a couple cloves of garlic to the stew as well. This particular recipe was not a hit with my family. It could use some fixing.

Easy, delicious, and satisfying, with big flavor. I did all of the chopping the night before to cut down on the AM prep work, so when I got up, I had everything in the slow cooker in maybe 10 minutes. Definitely making this again!

This is a very good recipe and freezes nicely as well. Here is how I do it. Its very important to get good meat for this. I usually get a high quality chuck roast. I trim and slice it into 1.5 in chucks. I sear the beef with olive oil, fresh garlic, red wine, salt and pepper. Transfer to crock pot then add stewed tomatoes, bouillon/cornstarch mixture, soy sauce, dash of Worcestershire, sugar, half a bag of chopped frozen onions, and more spices (garlic powder, oregano, dried parsley, black pepper). Let this cook on low for 5/6 hours. THEN I add a bag of frozen mixed pepper strips and sometimes I need a little more cornstarch depending on how thick it is. Turn up to high for 1 hr. Done! Very yummy!

Just had two bowls of it on rice.  Slow cooked 7 hours, I put the peppers in about halfway through but still too soon, they were mushy so next time I'll add more towards the end.  Delicious!  I did use chicken stock because I didn't have beef but I would make it that way again because it tasted really good.

Added about 2-3 tablespoons of coarse cracked peppercorns (bell peppers don't make this a pepper steak!) and used stew meat instead of strips of sirloin. Literally, one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth. add a TON of cracked pepper and it just mingles so nicely with the savory flavors in the soy sauce, stewed tomatoes, and beefy flavor.

I made this during a kitchen renovation so I did not have access to a stovetop to brown the meat before putting it in the slow cooker.  I also used a red and a yellow pepper in place of the green, which I added for an hour at the end, as was suggested by other reviewers to keep the peppers more firm.  I served this over microwavable rice but I think I would enjoy egg noodles more next time.  The meat turned out very tender and flavorful.

Not very flavorful.  I added garlic to the crockpot and scriracha and soy after plating but still not enough flavor for us.  The sauce was pretty watery and although the meat was pretty tender, it was dry.  That may have been my crockpot though.  It cooks fast.

Made the recipes as written. Everyone loved it. My picky 8 year old who had previously never liked pepper steak had 2 1/2 helpings! It's a new favorite for her. I prepped the beef & other ingredients the night before, there it all in the crock pot before work & set it for 6 hours on low. Easy peasy! It was ready when I walked in the door & all I had to do was make the rice. The only thing I would do different when I make this again is thicken the sauce at the end. Otherwise, it's perfect and easy!

I cooked this dish on high for 3 hours and then low for 2 hours (added the bell peppers for the last two hours of cooking to avoid soggy peppers). The beef was a little tough, but the next day it was very soft and tender. The peppers and tomatoes tasted fine with the beef. This recipe is more of a basic beef stew (more like a basic beef soup with unnecessary soy sauce in it, which cannot be tasted at all in this dish). It does not smell bad as noted by other reviewers, and is edible. This dish overall tastes OK, but is not great--on the bland side and in need of more ingredients. Hence, I'm only rating this 2 stars for a stew/soup type of recipe. For the outcome of this recipe being very soupy and bland in taste, you would have time better spent making a different actual beef stew type of recipe.

For the reviewers looking for a pepper steak type of recipe you would find at a Chinese restaurant, don't try slow cooking it! Stir fry your ingredients using fresh garlic and ginger, scallions/onions, soy sauce, and maybe even some dry sherry. If you want to add in tomatoes, cut up a few fresh to add to your stir fry along with a little bit of sugar. Don't forget the black pepper too!

Good served in a pita.  Instead of chopping, slice the peppers and onions fajita-style.  Sodium mg are high.

Next time I will eliminate salt. It was just too salty for my taste but otherwise good flavor and easy to prepare.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I did make one minor change, I used a can of diced tomato's as I did not have stewed.  I also followed other suggestions to wait until the last hour or so to add the peppers and onions. It was very easy and tasted wonderful.  Will definitely make again..

Overall a solid recipe,  however it was a little bland for our taste. We used it on egg noodles (no rice on hand) and the next day in a tortilla for an adapted burrito.

Because this recipe has limited spices and other ingredients the piece of steak you choose must be a nice piece of sirloin since the meat is the STAR of this recipe. I always prefer freshly roasted garlic in olive oil and I splashed some liquid smoke into the crock pot. Served over jasmine rice with a nice dry wine a salad and some crusty bread and you have a great easy meal. If you invest in a good sirloin this cooking method will produce a very tender beef dish. I will make this again!

Fabulous flavor!  I used various colored peppers, just because I happened to have a few.  Only thing I will do differently is to reduce the liquid a little, probably drain the tomatoes.  Only took about 10 minutes to prep everything and get in in the crock pot.  Will definitely be on my list of favs!

I made this yesterday and it was delicious!  Instead of stewed tomatoes I used fresh plum tomatoes (frozen, peeled and drained) from my garden.  I also used fresh garlic and beef fry strips as suggested in other recipes.  I did not use any salt and instead of regular bullion cubes I used a reduced sodium "Better Than Bullion" organic product sold in a jar.  The gravy was so tasty and the meat very tender.  I served it over black (Emporer's) rice and it was yummy!  This was very easy to make!

Very good. I used way less soy sauce because I was trying to limit saltiness. We had these the next day for lunch. Husband had his in a whole wheat wrap and I had mine over a salad (watching our carbs). I'm sure this would also taste great over rice too. Wll make again.

I loved this recipe. Very good taste. I served it over mashed pot. My Husband said it was "the bomb", which says a lot because he doesn't like peppers and such. I did not change a thing about the recipe. It is delicious the way it is. I even made a pepper steak sandwich later that day.

This was delicious!!!!! I didn't have cornstarch on hand so I just mixed a packet of brown gravy, the onion soup mix and the bouillon with about a half cup of water in the crock pot while the steak was cooking in a flour mixture in the oil mixture. I cut the onions and peppers in strips so the kids could pick around what they wanted. everyone loved it.

One of my fav recipes. I do change a few things.
I use a chuck roast. Just put it in to the crock pot instead of browning anything. Less for me to wash, the better.
I also use chopped garlic instead of powder. I add in a little bit more bouillon than needed and don't bother with the water (I use the liquid bouillon). I just dissolve it in the can of tomatoes.
Whole onion, no sugar (it's not needed), no cornstarch, and a couple more bell peppers. Nothing too drastic that would change the flavor really. Delicious!!! Best served over some rice and has lots of juice for extra deliciousness.

By the time you brown the meat, it could have been a stir fry. Tasted more like a beef stew. I omitted the salt a other reviewers suggested.  Probably won't make it again.

This did not turn out well for me.  I prepared it as written.  My first issue was browning the beef.  I know that it adds flavor, but when I make something in the crock pot, I don't want to cook everything first.  By the time I was done browning, I could have just thrown in the peppers and onions and had it done in 20 min.  I cooked on low for 6 hours.  By the time it was done, the peppers were disintegrating and the beef was no longer strips, it was shredded.  The flavor was very bland.  I had to add a good glug of soy sauce to give it ANY flavor at all.  I had to add more cornstarch to thicken, and by the time I was done, I pretty much had stew.  Only not very tasty stew.  I won't make this again.

Unbelievable! Even though I was an idiot and cooked it on high for 7 hours - it still came out awesome. Can't wait to follow the directions correctly the next time. Warning: it does take a bit of prep in morning so plan accordingly if going to work. Took about 30 min of prep but the next time it will be about 20 min since I'll be familiar with the recipe.

This was pretty good, I cooked mine on low for 6.5 hrs and it was too long as the meat was a litt overdone. I didn't like it over rice. Only change I made was to use one red and one green bell pepper. I  will make it again but next time I will cook it for about 5-5.5 hrs on low and I will double the liquids to creat more sauce for serving over rice.

Loved this recipe. I used round steak and after being in the slow cooker all day, it was so tender you could cut it with a fork.

Not bad wanted to try something difference. It was a little salty though. If I do make it again I'll leave out the teaspoon of salt. the soy sauce is salty enough for the dish I think

This is one of those recipes that you make and it is so good that you feel like it again the next day.  I just made it for dinner this evening.  Its midnight here and I'm waiting for my daughter to get home from work.  What did I do?  I snuck some of the leftovers.  I think this is one of my favorite recipes from this site.  It is very easy (buy the pre-sliced beef) and absolutely delicious!  I have added it to my recipe box.

Very good.  I added some additional beef stock and thickened with powdered mashed potatos instead of cornstarch.  I also added a can of diced tomatoes because I like to add tomatoes :). I also used one orange bell pepper, one yellow and added a green bell pepper the last hour of cooking.  Served over whole grain egg noodles.

Was a hit with friends and family! In order to make it a five star recipe, I recommend mincing fresh garlic rather than using powder, don't add the salt- definitely enough with the soy sauce and bouillon. One of the best bits of cooking advice I received is you can always add but you can't subtract, so add your seasonings a little at a time and taste your food to see if you need more.  Add the peppers towards the end of cooking otherwise they are way too mushy. I did use both red and green peppers for more color. I also added a dash of sesame oil and some cayenne pepper for a little more flavor and kick. Served over rice and friends and family were very happy!

Out of sheer laziness, I mixed up the sauce, added the beef (which was half frozen and I didn't brown) then threw the peppers on top.  Put in the fridge the night before.  In the morning I put on low for 7 hrs.  The meat was very tender and sauce had good flavor, but I felt the need to add more spices to give it a little more kick.  Served over brown rice and it was a hit!

Simple and delicious. I made this as written, only increased the "sauce" by doubling the tomatoes, beef broth and cornstarch. A bit salty, for me. Next time I would omit the added salt, and/or use low sodium soy sauce. Served with rice. It was a hit with my husband, and plenty left over for him to take in his lunch. Will make again!!

Delish and Easy!
 Didn't use sugar or salt but added a pinch of red pepper flakes.  As other reviewers suggested, added red and green pepper strips two hours before finished.  This was really good with brown rice and green beans.  Even better for lunch the next day.

This was really good - I didn't have the full 2lbs of steak and I would make sure to have that next time I make this.  I would also add an additional can of stewed tomatoes.  I had very large green peppers so I only used one - but I'd probably throw 2 in next time and maybe another onion.  I also added a little bit of worcestshire sauce and added the green peppers when the meal was almost done - the meat was so tender!  I added some canned sliced mushrooms also - because I had them and served over rice. Like others, I added an additional T. of corn starch at the end and let it cook on low for about 30 min. more...

Wonderful, rich and flavorful.  The ratio of peppers and onion can be tweaked to whatever you have on hand.  I used a prepackaged mix from my produce department - made this recipe so quick and easy, and waist line friendly.  Yum!

I have mixed feelings on this. While the flavor is good, I dont find the texture of the meat pleasing. As most others recommended, I didnt throw the peppers in untill the last 30 minutes or so, and the onion about an hour earlier. I use strips of pepper, along with larger "ribbons" of onion. However, cooking the meat that long breaks it down far to much for my taste, almost like a shreaded beef. I've made this a few times, and still have yet to find a good balance of cooking time, and still giving the sauce a good flavor. I actually find quick cooking this in a wok to work a lot better, and gives it a fresher overall feel.

An outstanding delicious meal that was so easy.  The only slight alteration I made was to salt and pepper my steak before browning.  I also tripled the cornstarch to sauce before serving because I thought it needed to be thicker.  Everyone including company loved it.  Definitely a  repeat for Sunday lunch.

Delicious!  Very nice flavor and super easy.  I chose to cut the meat and vegetables into strips rather than to dice them, doubled the sauce ingredients due to personal preference, and added 1/2 tsp. of ground black pepper.  Served with basmati rice.  Would definitely make this again.

I thought this would be a winner because the picture looks awesome and it got great reviews.  However, my brother and I thought it was just ok.  I think it needs more kick.  I'm going to give it another try, though, and add ginger and red pepper flakes as others have suggested.

This is one of my family's favorites!  I make it exactly as the original recipe. The sauce goes great over white rice.  Simple and extremely tasty.

it is a good recipe - it lacked a special "kick" to it, but it is a perfect recipe to add your own extras into. I followed the recipe as is, the meat came out perfect, the peppers were soft but i like them like that. I served to 6 and 4 of them really liked it, and 2 liked but felt it was fine but nothing amazing.

Made it today in my wife's new Xmas present...We both enjoyed it.
Tweaked recipe a little to cut back on salt and to have extra sauce. 
Served it over egg noodles, definitely worth trying again.

Very easy!  Used almost an entire yellow onion, 1 green and 1 red pepper.  Also opted to pass on the teaspoon salt due to concerns about saltiness from soy sauce.  Sauteed sirloin in only 1 tblsp. vegetable oil, again due to my personal need to watch fats.

I felt it needed 'something' but am not sure what.  Perhaps instead of garlic powder next time will use chopped garlic.

Overall an easy and filling meal!

Made with a few modifications, and this was delicious.  First, I did not brown the meat before adding to the slow cooker.  It was so tender and delicious that this step wasn't missed.  Used mostly red wine & a little hot water for the bouillon, fresh garlic, and replaced 1 tbsp of soy sauce with Worcestershire.  As per the advice of numerous reviewers, peppers were added about 1.5 hrs before serving & were still plenty soft.  Very tasty & simple!

Although I haven't tried this recipe for Pepper Steak, I know it's good because I have been using a recipe given to me by (working chefs) family members, and it's very similar.  The only exceptions are:  you can use any type of beef you want, tomato puree, worcestershire, beef broth, canned Chinese vegetables and canned mushrooms (you can add fresh if desired).  
It takes a little time to balance the sauce(soy, worcestershire and puree) which is later thickened with a cornstarch slurry.

This meal isn't the typical slow-cooker tasting meal. Really enjoyed by everyone. I have made it as written and also as recommended by the reviews. Last time I used a full roast instead of strips and it was tender and full of flavor - I cooked it all day on low. I also doubled the sauce and added the peppers last as many recommended.

This is a really good recipe. I made it as-is from the original recipe except I added the bell peppers 90 minutes before serving and it was still a little too soft for my tastes.  The beef was a tad salty so I will cut down the soy sauce or maybe dissolve only half of the bouillon cube.  Overall a keeper!

LOVE!  This was fantastic!  My only modifications: I doubled the water and the bouillon cube because I added a LOT of peppers and mushrooms and onions.  I also bought pre-cut pepper steak strips (fresh) from the butcher, which made this much easier.  Added mushrooms with my peppers all during the last hour of cook time, and the peppers were perfect-not soggy.  The kids and adults loved it-this one is going into heavy rotation.

Really delicious. My husband loved it, too. Only thing I  did was put the peppers in about an hour and a half before everything was done. It is really a meal to have in the middle of winter. I put it over some egg noodles. Turned out great. Would use this recipe again!

I'm a college student so being able to make it and walk away was wonderful! It's easy and it's delicious! Definitely deserves 5 stars. I did wait to add my bell peppers till about an hr before it was suppose to be done.

I made this last night and it was pretty good. I used stew meat since that's what my grocery store had, but I think next time I'll try it with the stir fry strips. I tweaked it a little by adding a couple tablespoons of brown sugar, which was nice. I served it over mashed potatoes.

Very good, however it did taste more like a roast.   Maybe I cooked it to long.

This was an excellent recipe from which to improvise.  I used beef stew meat instead of sirloin because it was much cheaper.  I used both garlic powder and fresh minced garlic.  I added a splash of worcestershire sauce, both a red and a green pepper.  I added the peppers 1/2 way through the cooking, but would add them 3/4 through next time.  Added pineapple right at the end.  Also used ginger.  served on garlic mashed potatoes.  The entire family loved it.  Made much more than 6 servings.

I love this! Instead of using two green peppers, I used one green and one red. The flavor of this recipe I thought was great. I used a couple more teaspoons of cornstarch during the last hour before serving so it wasn't more so a stew. Serve over rice and it's perfect. I will definitely be making this again.

This is very tasty and I have been using a very similar recipe for years.  Can also be done in about 45 minutes on the stove top if you don't have the time to crock pot it.  A heaping teaspoon of dried ginger kicks it up a notch in flavor.

I've made this several times but as a stew rather than pepper steak, eliminating the peppers and adding carrots, celery, potatoes and more onions about half way through the cooking time.  It's the best combination for stew I've ever found.

Great recipe and the flavor was fantastic.  I was worried that the tomatoes would overwhelm, but it was nicely balanced by the soy and beef cube.  I served it over quinoa last night and my husband enjoyed it.  I did add red peppers instead of green only during the last hour and half of cooking on high heat.

This a great recipe. I changed a few things like I added green, red, Hungarian, and jalapeno peppers to it. I also added teriyaki, sweet chili, and black pepper sauce instead of soy sauce and omitted the salt and sugar. It came out great! The boyfriend loved it!

VERY TASTY! I added about a TBS of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce, a dash or two of Worcester and a pinch of garlic salt. SOOOO GOOD! Had it over rice.  Family loved it :) (mixed together a bit more water and cornstarch and poured in at the end to thicken up the juice a bit)

I have made this many, many times, just as written, and it is excellent.  I am not a big fan of eating peppers, but I like their flavor mixed with other foods.  This particular recipe works because the pepper flavor doesn't overpower the flavor of the great sauce, which is delicious in its simplicity!!!

Pretty good.  Very easy for a weeknight.  I sauteed the peppers and onion with garlic and added them to the crockpot about an hour before serving.  Had this with rice but egg noddles or mashed potatoes would be good too.  I just thought it was lacking some flavor.  If I make this again, I might add some hot sauce/worcestershire/etc..

This was good!  I used 1 green bell and 1 yellow bell.  My steak slices just kind of shredded into the mixture but I think it's cause my slow cookers low setting cooks too hot.  Nice recipe...thanks!

I had never made pepper steak before and wow I'm happy I picked this recipe and so was my family. I followed some of the other reviews and cut my peppers in strips. I also used sweet vidalia onion and fresh garlic. Served over french onion rice it was delicious! I will be making this over and over again. Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good!  For an asian twist, try adding ginger and red pepper flakes.  Great recipe!

It is a decent weekday meal.  quick to assemble.  The dish reminded me of sliced up pot roast, but perhaps not quite as tender.  It was good, but not as good as making pepper steak in a pan rather than a slow cooker.  But the point here was ease.  Bottom line: I would make again, but for family at home, not for company.

We loved it! (even my picky little boys liked it !!) This was the first time we  did not have any leftovers ! I didn't have any beef bouillon cubes on hand, so I used Lipton Onion & Mushroom soup mix.

This will go into my rotation but with some tweaks. It comes out a bit soupy for me, any ideas? More cornstarch? I used 2 minced garlic cloves instead of powder, added a red pepper for color and added a teaspoon of Chinese Five Spice which gives an extra depth. Would also look to add a couple of Asian Chilis chopped for a spicy version.

This recipe is fantastic and super easy. I made it for the first time this weekend for a dinner party of 20 people as an extra meat dish. I used top round, cut into small chunks. I cooked on low for nearly 10 hours.  The meat was very tender and the flavors were awesome with no modifications necessary.  I did use fresh chopped garlic, lite soy sauce, and marinated the meat overnight in a bit of lite soy.  Like others, I put the peppers in only 30 minutes before serving time, and they were perfect - soft but not falling apart.  I served with rice and egg noodles.  I received rave reviews, many likened it to more of a goulash than a pepper steak, probably because of the tomatoes.  Will make again!

Good, not great. Served it over thin spaghetti. Easy to make and not time consuming. Added peppers 1  1/2 hours before serving as suggested and they turned out well.

Very easy and pretty good.  Way too salty.  I would omit the additional salt/ use low sodium soy sauce/ use less soy sauce.  I love salt and it was way to salty for my husband and myself.

Delicious! I used some black pepper marinated sirloins that we bought awhile back but didn't really care for because they were a little tough. They were tender and delicious after using them in this recipe! I used a whole onion and 2 1/2 large green peppers. I added the peppers half way through. I also added 1/2 cup of water in the beginning, so I needed to add a little more cornstarch. There was a good amount of "gravy" at the end and was perfect served over plain white rice. Thank you for a great recipe!

i should have listened when some pple said to put peppers in last.....shame on me! also used 2lbs beef stew meat and it was yummy. I had to use a lot more cornstarch though for a thicker consistancy.

This was excellent exactly the way the recipe was layed out - the only thing I added were some thinly sliced carrot sticks right near the end.  My son ate so much that he had to loosen his belt after leaving the table - I've never seen that happen before!  Even my grandson loved it.  This is definitely a keeper in my house!

I Followed the recipe except I added the peppers during the last 30mins of cooking, added 3/4 cup of water, and a tsp fresh minced garlic.  The peppers were nice and crispy how we like it. There was a good amount of sauce to pour over rice. The leftovers were even better for lunch the next day. Great recipe!

THIS DISH WAS AWESOME! MY FAMILY REALLY LIKED IT OVER SOME WHITE RICE.  I COOKED IT ON HIGH FOR 4 HOURS AND PLACED THE BELL PEPPERS IN THERE IN THE LAST HOUR.  I WILL NEXT TIME ADD THE PEPPERS IN THE LAST 30 MIN. SINCE THEY WERE VERY SOFT.  OTHERWISE GREAT RECIPE.  THIS WILL BE ON THE MENU MONTHLY IN MY HOUSE.

Very good, everyone here loved it.  I did double the recipe, so we could have leftovers and omitted the salt.  I also added the green peppers the last hour of cooking and served over rice.  Next time I'll use petite tomatoes but that is because my family are not tomato lovers.

Not like the pepper steak that I remember. This is delicious and flavorful. I enjoyed it over rice. Next time, I think I'll add some hot peppers or something that will add a bit more zip. All in all, easy and delicious!

I can honestly say I was not that impressed with this recipe, just wasn't seasoned well? I had to add to it after it was done and it still turned out kind of bland.

Kind of blah.  This would be better just cooked in a pan so the veggies don't get so mushy.

I loved this recipe.  I made it at home and brought it to work to reheat and put over egg noodles and everyone loved it.  They even took my leftovers home.  Instead of can stewed tomatoes I used the diced tomatoes with garlic.  I followed the rest of the recipe just like it said.

I loved this recipe! Like many others, I waited until about the last hour to add the peppers in. They were perfect when the meal was served. I also browned my meat in a bit of Worcester sauce along with the garlic before adding it to the pot. Since I didnt have any beef bouillon cubes, I used beef stock instead and then used the remainder of the can when cooking my rice. Overall it was a fantastic recipe and got rave reviews from my family!

Very good!  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it is a bit salty and the green peppers shouldn't be added until about 1 hr. before complete because they overcook if you add them at the beginning.  We will adjust and make it again!

Husband says 3.5, I say 4.5, so we'll average it out to 4. I think next time I would add a generous quantity of ginger and additional sugar, because I want the sauce to be more Asian-style than it is. I did not add the last teaspoon of salt as we are sensitive to too much salt. I think I'd make this again, I might play around with a few other ingredients but this is a solid base that tastes good, if not precisely yet attuned to our palate. I think most people would enjoy this dish! Thanks for the recipe!

wow!  I love this recipe.  I used a london broil and browned it in fresh garlic (I didnt have garlic powder). I also used beef broth in place of the water and boullion.  I used a bag of  frozen peppers and onions as well.  Served it over rice!

One word - Delish!  Served this on bulky sub rolls for dinner last night with provolone cheese.  The flavor was awesome and the meat was so tender.  Only changes I made were:  I used a whole chopped onion, used a red, green and yellow pepper, used a can of chopped tomatoes and omitted the salt.  I did not brown the meat, just placed in the slow cooker turned on HI for the first hour, then turned to LOW for the remaining cooking time.  I also did not put the peppers in until one hour prior to serving.  Will defnitely make this again.

This recipe was delightful. After reading some reviews I doubled the sauce and added 3 tablespoons of cornstarch at the end to thicken. Also, I put my peppers in with 2 hours remaining to reduce the sogginess and they were still soggy. I will add the peppers with only an hour left next time. Lastly, I added a Hungarian Wax pepper for a little spice. Awesome. Will make again for sure.

WOW! FANTASTIC! * BE SURE to ADD peppers LAST HOUR of cooking!!... otherwise too mushy!*  I doubled the recipe so that I could put individual dinners together & freeze them. I threw in some snow peas and added an extra 5 tablespoons of soy sauce! Whole family loved it and my PICKY hubby agrees that THIS is a keeper! =)

this is one of the easiest and tastiest slow cooker recipes.  I use Worcestershire sauce intead of soy sauce and usually end up adding a bit more garlic powder once it's all in the pot. My 5yr old devours it and everyone gets seconds.

I've made this a few times and it always turns out great. Today I'm adding fresh garlic and an extra bell pepper to give it a tad more zip. Super recipe as written, though.

Simply divine!  We sliced French rolls in half, broiled with provolone cheese and used the Pepper Steak as the filling.  We even sprinkled on a little red pepper flakes to give it an extra kick!  So delicious!

This was fantastic!  I cooked it on low for 7 hours.  It needed more broth, the top meat was either dried out or still tough.  So I added 3 cups of water, a few dashes of steak sauce and let it go another hour.  I added the green peppers about a half hour before finishing and they were still a bit crunchy.  Next time I will add more broth at the beginning and add the peppers earlier.  Oh, I also added some dry brown rice an hour before finishing and it was perfect.  I will definitely prepare this again.

The flavor was great, but I accidentally over cooked mine. It got kind of burnt edges and just kind of mushy. I will make again. Used stir fry steak to save time. Needs more liquid mixture. Maybe doubling the liquid would be a good idea.

This was way too salty. I would recommend omitting the salt, as the beef boullion and soy sauce provide plenty of salt. I also recommend adding the green peppers sliced during the last 30 min of cooking time. I will modify this dish and try it one more time and hope to be able to give it a higher rating.

I love all recipes that I can use the crock pot, this one was a hit with the hubby too. I altered it slightly; I used flour and put garlic in the sauce. Added fresh mushrooms and 1/4 cup water and a dash of black pepper, also used salt sense instead of regular salt. I will try wild rice next time.

Very easy and tasty recipe.  I used one can beef broth for the bouillon cube and water.  I skipped the browning step to save time and it turned out fine.  I added the green peppers the last hour of cooking.

I added the bell pepper during the end of cooking so it would not be overcooked.  This dish tasted a little like barbeque.

This was very easy to prepare and a really nice change.  I did as others and added the peppers during the last hour.  Also thickened the sauce with 1 tablespoon of cornstarch and about 1 tablespoon of the broth.  My very picky son had a 2nd helping!  I served this over egg noodles, but will use rice next time.

Would have preferred a thicker sauce.  Didn't add beef bouillan and used tabasco teriyaki sauce instead of the soy.  Had a good flavor, very tender.

This is very good but both the steak and the peppers are a little mushier than I like.  I think I just prefer pepper steak made on the stove rather than in a slow cooker.

Really simple and great to make when you don't feel like spending too much time in the kitchen! Searing the steak first really does help keep the pieces from falling apart in the slow cooker, but it isn't necessary. My whole family loves it, and it's certainly a keeper in my house!

I did tweak this a little based on others reviews. I used 1 cup of water, 4 boullion, 4 tbs corn start. I also used worchestershire sauce and extra soy so that we had more juice. I also waited till the last 1 1/2 hrs to add the peppers & tomatoes. It was outstanding!!

This was delicious, and the first meal with steak in it that I will actually eat! I threw everything into my slow cooker and cooked on low for about 7 hours. I added the corn starch and peppers in the last hour of cooking. My husband really enjoyed this! The meat was tender and flavorful!

Delicious!  If you want your meal to look like the photo, definitely add the peppers latera nd do larger slices rather than chopping.  I like mine melting away so I put in at the beginning.  Next time around I'm going to use diced tomatoes instead of stewed since the pieces were a bit too large for our taste.  I served over rice but the leftovers are just as delicious.  I used the steak cold in salad and it was yummy!

This is a great "busy mom" recipe.  I served this over rice and chose to cook on low for 7 hours increasing the water to 1 1/4 cups.  I also chose to substitute 1 of the soy sauces for a dash of worcestershire sauce.  I have read that people are getting "mushy bell peppers".... if you keep from stiring it often then the mushyness is less likely. I will be making this recipe again.

Made this last night and it was great. I stuck to the recipe except that I waited until the last hour to add the chopped bell peppers. This way they softened up but still had a bit of crunch left. The only things I' do differently next time would be to omit the salt, as it was a touch too salty, and use a better cut of meat. I used the precut stir fry strips as well, and we thought the meat was the worst part. However, overall this is really delicious and will be made again.

My family liked this way more than I did. I thought it was too salty for my taste but I think with some slight adjustments I will make this again. No matter what, I enjoyed having a very different dish to prepare in the slow cooker!

Oh my goodness!! This was delicious!!! We just finished eating and I had to write how much we enjoyed it. I used a london broil that I had in the freezer. Other than that I followed the ingredients as listed. I doubled the sauce ingredients, except for the salt. This is a definite keeper!!!

I used 1 lb. of steak and 1 red, 1 green pepper.  I sliced the peppers and onions instead of chopping and cooked on low for 8 hours.  Could have used a little more salt.

Seriously, this is my new favorite recipe! It was delicious!! I used beef stew meat but other than that, I followed the recipe to a T and served with brown rice. I'll leave out the bouillon next time to cut out some sodium but other than that I won't be changing ANYTHING!! Fantastic!! Thanks for sharing!

Insultingly simple with "wow" results. Added white pepper for extra kick.

Delicious!  I always start my crock pot dishes later than I should so I end up cooking everything on high.  I did this one on high for 3 hours and it was perfect.  Highly recommend.

I recommend this recipe. I just recently starting using my crock-pot and it worked just as I had hoped for this recipe! It made my whole house smell great and it was so easy to make. I was actually surprised at how yummy it turned out.  I do suggest using a "good" cut of beef and cutting it into strips yourself.

This recipe was super easy to make and was pretty tasty.  It reminded me of a pretty regular beef stir fry because the flavor was very similar.  I followed the steps exactly and would make again.

My family loved this recipe!  I used a 29 oz can of stewed tomatoes just to have extra tomatoes and plenty of sauce.  I used one yellow and one green pepper and this made this dish visually very appealing.  I also left out the tsp of salt since there is 3 tbsp of soy sauce which I feel adds enough sodium.  The sirloin was incredibly tender and melted in your mouth!

When I saw the title of this recipe I was thinking more like peppercorn sort of pepper steak, not bell peppers. This recipe is very similar to one called Asian beef. Nonetheless, this is a really good recipe. I made it exactly as written. The sauce was an excellent consistency and the beef was very tender. This is nice because you can use an inexpensive cut of meat and still get great results. I will make this again.

WOW!!! This was absolutely delicious! The flavor was really unique and not at all what I expected. Because of its great, interesting taste, it was a good change from the usual "easy" home dinner...but just as simple to make. I thought it presented well too, and I would consider making it for company. I used yellow, red, and orange peppers for color and added broccoli. I also added a cup of water, just because it didn't look like enough liquid. I served it over egg noodles. This was FANTASTIC and I can't wait to eat it tomorrow night!

Pretty good!  I have to admit, I was expecting a different taste from it, but the one that came out wasn't all that bad.  I might forgo the tomatoes next time and think up something else to put in it.  I used Soyaki sauce instead of Soy sauce, and I think it made it tangier.

wonderful. I do not do anything to the steak before adding it into the crock pot, just add is raw with the rest of the ingredients, mix it up well and go! have done it over egg noodles and rice, rice is better because sauce can be thin and it soaks it up well. Whole family loves it, even the toddlers...wow.

Since I was only cooking for 2, I used half the amount of meat, but didn't cut back on anything else.  Everything turned out perfectly.  If I make the full recipe in the future, I'd probably double the liquids etc.

My steak turned out just ok.. I think I had high expectations from all the reviews and it just didn't do it for me.  Kind of reminded me of something I could buy frozen in a bag at the grocery store and warm up.

As if this one needs another review... it was wonderfu! Quick, easy and delicious. The only thing I did different was to also add a little pepper to the meat and seasoned the meat during the browning stage- gave the meat more flavor.

This was delicious! I also made Brown Rice (from this site also) and it was so good! I added an extra bell pepper and fresh garlic instead of powder. Also we decided not to add the can of stewed tomatoes, and I think I would do it the same next time, there will be a next time!

I left this on low for 10 hours, adding cut up green and red peppers 3 hrs before serving (next time, I'd cut that down to about 1-1/2 hrs). The salt amounts seemed high for me, so I halved the amount of soy sauce, and omitted the extra tsp salt. I served this over brown rice, and topped it with a sprinkling of dry roasted peanuts. Everyone liked this.
Sept 2014: Made this again, using cheaper, cut-up stewing beef. Added the green peppers an hour before serving, as many other reviewers have also recommended. Half the soy sauce, no extra salt, and added a tsp of Worcestershire Sauce. Great taste again !

This was absolutely great. The one thing I did differently was seasoned the beef and then grilled it on both sides until medium-rare. I then let it sit for 10 minutes, sliced into strips and added to slow-cooker along with left over juices. 6 hours later it came out absolutely tender with great taste.

This was soooo yummy and the perfect comfort food to come home to on a cool, autumn day after work. I accidentally left out beef bouillon but discovered that it's not even needed. There is plenty of flavor without it. My husband absolutely LOVED this!

excellent flavor!! Sliced the onions, green pepper, and used one red pepper (instead of chopped).  Made recipe exactly as shown other than that.  6 hours was a bit too long on low for me...next time i'll try 5 hours.

I made a mixture of seasoned flour, breaded the meat and then put in oil. I used a can of whole tomatoes in juice instead of stewed, added mined garlic to mixture and used 1/4 cup of beef broth. Used red onion and added peppers at last 2 hours of cooking. Was excellent. Would use this recipe all the time. meat was so tender and peppers still had some crunch. This was so good...

This was good, but did not taste like pepper steak as I expected.  If I make this again, I will probably take another commenter's advice and add the green peppers at the very end, because they were very very mushy.

Yum, delish!!  Following other reviews, I added the green peppers in an hour before it was time to take it out.  Also, I wanted to have it really saucy, so when I added the green peppers, I also stuck a bullion cube in a cup of hot water, and added that as well.  After the meal was done, I scooped out about 1/2 cup of the juice, and added cornstarch to it, then back in the pot to thicken up the liquid, so it would be a nice gravy over my egg noodles.

This is the best ever!  We've cooked this one many times for many people and everyone always loves it.  We add a little Worcestershire sauce and cut back a tad on the salt.  (The soy sauce already has enough for the dish.)  This one comes highly recommended by my whole family!!

This was so simple and tasted so good. I followed the ingredient list exactly. I didn't brown the meat first but instead I marinated all the ingredients overnight in the fridge and then cooked it for almost 9 hrs on low. The meat was so tender it was falling apart as I served it and it melted in our mouths.

This was THA BOMB!! I pretty much kept it the same. Except used flour to thicken,Omitted salt. Wanted to spice it up so I chopped up some pepperoncins, added hot sauce,black pepper and chili powder. Tip: Put sirlion in freezer for a few mins its easier to cut. My only complaint was it was a bit expensive but I will make this as much as possible. Goes great with sticky rice:) Thx!

It was pretty good.  I'm used to the more asian-style sauce for this dish, so the tomato taste was a little unfamiliar.  Good enough to try again, not so good as to do it the same way.  Maybe I'll try the peppers added late, that sounds good, they were pretty mushy.

I did like others have suggested and put the green peppers in at the last hour and added some red pepper flakes. This came out AMAZING! I could actually taste all the ingredients not just a hogepodge of stuff. Very good thank you for the recipe.

I thought this was tasty. I cooked it for 10 hours on low, adding the peppers in for the last 2 hours. A little more kick would have been nice, but overall good.

This was great! I didn't use garlic powder, instead I used minced garlic. We like more gravey so I doubled the bouillon cubes and water. I used the whole onion only one bellpepper and didn't add it until an hour before it was ready. Instead of white sugar I used brown sugar. I will for sure make this over again.

Very good and tender. Definitely will be making again. Be careful how thin you cut the sirloin; it will shrink as the fat cooks out.

I did what others suggested and added the bell peppers about 1.5 hours before I was ready to serve it.  I also added a bit of cornstarch at the end to thicken it up a bit which made it the most delicious dish I have had out of the slow cooker thus far!!  And I actually forgot to add the can of stewed tomatoes and it was still super tasty!!  I will definitely be making this one again!

I had a lot of stew beef in my freezer that needed to be used.  I wasn't in the mood for stew or stroganoff so I thought I'd try this recipe with the meat.  It turned out great!  Slow cooking on low made the meat so tender!  I added the peppers during the last hour of cooking as suggested by others and then served it over sticky rice.  Good stuff!

My husband and 5-year-old request this recipe often.  I like my peppers to have a little crunch so I cook this recipe on low for the suggested amount of time but don't add the peppers until 1/4-1/2 way through the cooking.

This beginner cook who likes experimenting has found a keeper! I altered the ingredients a bit and love the result.  Doubled the bouillon, water and soy sauce for more sauce.  Instead of six tablespoons of soy sauce, I substituted 2 tablespoons with worcestershire to cut down on the salt.  Also, I didn't add salt - soy sauce is salty enough for us.  Brown sugar instead of white.  And added crushed black pepper with the garlic powder before browning.  Like other posters have suggested, I waited to add the peppers in the last two hours.  Plus, added broccoli florets at the same time.  I don't like peppers and the broccoli was a nice addition for my taste.  The only thing I would do different next time is to allow for the full cooking time.  I tried cooking on low for 5 1/2 hours and the meat wasn't as tender as it could have been.

This was very good..even the picky kids loved it. I did make some changes though since they are so picky. I bleded up the tomatoes so no chunks would be found. I also added minced garlic and didnt put in the peppers and onions until about 35 mins before serving. I served this over white rice.
Will definitely make this again!

I made this recipe as written and it was just so-so.  The sauce was nothing special and the steak wasn't overly tender (although this isn't likely any fault of the recipe).  I am going to remake it at some point using pineapple in the sauce as another reviewer suggested.

I followed this recipe exactly except I followed advice from others and added the chopped pepper during the last hour of cooking. There wasn't a lot of sauce at this point and it was very runny so I followed some more advice and added a full can of beef broth and more cornstarch. This helped the look of the dish but then I tasted the sauce and noticed it was very very bland. So I followed another reviewers advice and added worcestershire sauce, which didn't go at all. I then added a splash of red wine hoping that would help and that didn't either. I am giving this 2 stars only because my husband didn't think it was completely awful but he doesn't want me to ever make it again. I didn't care for it even before all the changes I made and was very disappointed considering the amount of great reviews this got. My husband and I ate just enough to not be hungry anymore. Huge waste of money!

I have made this several different ways depending on what ingredients I have in the house at the time.  I usually just make it in a combination frypan/sauce pan and do not use a slow cooker.  I usually double the soy sauce and sugar.  Sometimes I used crushed tomatoes instead of stewed because my husband does not like chunks of vegetables.  Also I do chop the green/red peppers so they disappear into the sauce for the same reason.  I am sure this would work with children too...what they don't know can't hurt them!

Very easy and good. I have most of the ingredients on hand.  We sopped up the gravy with slices of white bread.  I will make rice with this next time.

This was a simple and delicious recipe as is. The only modification I made was to use Weyler's new garlic and onion beef boullion cubes, which gave it a really rich and flavorful broth. I served it on top of "Garlic Mashed Red Potatoes" - another excellent and easy recipe on this site. My husband liked it so much he ate 3 servings!!

I didn't think that I would care for this because I usually do not like green peppers so I cut it down to one large green pepper, and used one large vidalia onion.  I guess I am odd but I liked the mushy green peppers, it helped change the consistency for me and I actually found myself liking it.  I also threw in a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, and some basil, oregano, thyme and it turned out to be delicious and I had plenty of sauce when I finished.

A very easy and good recipe. Even my 4 year old loved it. Once you get it into the crock pot you can resume your daily chores and let it cook itself. It was great. And it's the type of recipe that you can always add other veggies and spices to it! Will definitely use again.

Very yummy! I used 4 cloves minced fresh garlic, beef chuck (store didn't have any sirloin), 1 med onion, and 1 green and 1/2 red pepper, and left out the salt.  I cooked it on High for 4 hours and it was perfect!  The meat was very tender.  I  put in the peppers for the last hour of cooking, but I probably should of put them in only at half hour or so, because they still came out overcooked.  Served over rice.

Just ok for us. Nice to have dinner made waiting for us in the crock pot, but will not make again. Followed directions/ingredients as printed, just not sure what I would do differently to enjoy the dish more....

I knew when I saw over 600 reviews and nearly 5 stars that I found a winner.  This is really good. I only wish I had some mushrooms to add.  The steak is tender and surprisingly the stewed tomatoes taste good too.  I bought whole ones because I though I would pick around them. I served with rice and a glass of Cabornet.

Very very good!!  I omitted the salt altogether to avoid the saltiness per the other reviews.  I wasn't so sure as it was cooking, but when we actually went to eat and served over long grain rice, we thought is was AWESOME!  Will definitely cook again!

Very good.  I also added mushrooms to this. 

Next time I may add a little more cornstarch to make the sauce a little thicker.

This recipe is very good.  I made it exactly as directed except I added more cornstarch/boullian to thicken it up a bit.  It still ended up not being thick at all, a little too runny so only giving it 4 out of 5 stars.  The flavor was wonderful and the beef so very tender.  If anyone has any ideas how to make it thicker, please post.

This was absoloutly delicious!  It's nice to finally have a good recipe to put my crockpot in use!  I did add some worcestershire and a few extra teaspoons of soy sauce that I think really added more flavor to the recipe.  I also used a whole onion instead of 1/2.  Next time I believe I will put the onions and peppers in near the end of the cooking time.  I only let it cook on 5 hrs on low and turned it off because the onions and peppers starting to get soggy.  The steak was very tender.  Will use this recipe often!!

This was just okay.  I really wanted to like this because I love the ease of crock pot cooking and it sounded delicious.  It was a little time intensive in the morning and the result was not super flavorful.  One of the things we didn't like was that the sauce was very thin, not thick like I expected.    Not a keeper.

This was a great meal. It was easy to prep and not have to worry about dinner on a busy day. I only cooked it for 5.5hrs on low and it turned out fine, I served it over egg noodles, but I personally would have prefered rice (but we didnt have any!) The meat was so tender it easily came apart with a fork. Will definetly make again.

This was absolutely delicious. It is so refreshing to find a slow cooker recipe that doesn't involve stockpiling mountains of "cream of something soup". I didn't have any beef so I used pork and I didn't have any garlic powder so I just used fresh garlic. I doubled the recipe and substitted the second lot of soy for sweet soy. I also added some worchestershire and a heap of black pepper as other reviewers suggested. After reading another reviewers comment, I was hesitant about adding two cans of tomato, but found that they almost completely disapeared. I also waited till the final hour to add the peppers. All in all this was a great recipe that I will be making again and again! Thank you!

This turned out great!  I took the advice of other posters and added the green peppers about 1/2 hour before serving.  I did substitute diced tomatoes with green peppers and onions in place of stewed and served it over brown basamti rice - perfect!

Easy & good ! Did change it a bit for what I had on hand. Used beef breakfast steaks and cubed them. 1 bell pepper, 1 1/2 Tbsps. minced garlic, wor. sauce (as per another reviewer) and didn't have corn starch. Used 1 tbsp. flour instead. Turned out great. Served over white rice. Was a big hit !!! Thanks for sharing !!

Yummy! This was really easy to prepare and quite tasty. I followed the recipe exactly and we were not disappointed. I'm not sure that you have to take the extra time to fry the steak strips... I think it would be just as good if you skip that step and just throw it all in the crock pot. Oh, and you've got to add black pepper! That was the only ingredient this recipe lacked. I served this with "Maria's Rice", also from this website. It was a winning combination!

AHH SO GOOD!!! I REALLY liked this dish and loved the combonation between savory beef and the taste of the strong peppers. Amazing dish, deserves a 5 star. Very good served over brown rice, all the rice obsorbes the yummy juices and makes the whole dish so flavorful! Also good with crusty bread and crisp veggies.

Delicious and easy!  I didn't brown the sirloin as that always defeats the purpose of the crockpot for me... I just added the meat to the crockpot with 1/2 teaspoon oil and the meat was very tender and flavorful.  I did have to double the amount of cornstarch to get the sauce to thicken but those were my only two small modifications.

This was a very good recipe - and pretty healthy. The whole family enjoyed this and it really did have very good flavor. My modifications were adding some fresh mushrooms and a little bit of rice wine vinegar. Next time I might add a little more corn starch to thicken the sauce a little more. Thank you for a great no fuss meal.

This was delicious!!  I'm always looking for new ways to make round steak, and this was the best we've had lately. To add color, I used one each of a red pepper, green pepper and yellow pepper cut into strips and put in at the beginning so that they were soft.  I served it over white rice and topped with crispy chow mein noodles. Yummmm!

Kudos for such a great idea.  I put this on right before bed last night.  I love having dinner already made when I come home.  Was easy and tasted great.

When my hubby went back for seconds, I knew that it was good...but when he went back for thirds! I knew this one was a definate keeper.  I also bought the "beef for stir fry" to quicken my prep time.  I added a few extra spices when I was browning the meat and also added a little worsesterchire as suggested by others. I used beef broth instead of water and bouillon and didn't have any cornstarch so I left that out. Omitted the salt and added the red and green bell peppers at the end. It turned out so delish. The flavor was wonderful!

Even though I used pork it was wonderful!  The meat just fell apart and there was nothing left... the kids rave about it and it's already planed for next week with beef. Wow!  So good and so easy! We love it!

Followed all directions and even added fresh galic as suggested and waited to cook peppers during the last hour.  Nothing to brag about.  My 10 year old who loves peppers was looking forward to it as it smelled good while cooking.  Flavor was okay but nothing special.  He said the meat was "dry".  It's funny because after he said it I knew exactly what he meant.  It wasn't juicy...just in juice.  My 12 year old, who eats almost everything, finished his but said it wasn't a keeper.  I agreed.

Simple and quick to put together which I look for. We are full time RVers and I use the crock pot quite of bit.  Very tasty & very tender. Husband and I both enjoyed over rice with a tossed salad and crusty rolls.  Will make again. All I left out was the salt.  Turned out perfect 4hrs. on high.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was great! I used premium serlion steak and had the butcher cut it in strips for me, which made the prep very simple. I also made the sauce thicker and added fresh garlic to the meat while browning it. I used wild rice instead of white and took the suggestion of putting the peppers in 20 minutes before serving. I will definitly be making this agian! 

This would also be a great filler for Stuffed Peppers!

Very good. I didn't add salt because of previous reviewers stating that it was a little too salty but I think it actually needed some, a little bland for us. I added fresh minced garlic instead of powder and a little bit of ground ginger. I added the peppers and onions one hour before it was done. Came out perfect not mushy at all.Will definately make again with a little added salt.

This tasted pretty good, and I made it with sliced chuck roast; no need for sirloin.  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars from me is because my green peppers were mushy.  I think next time I will add them after the meat has cooked about 3 hours.  But, I will be making this again, so thanks for posting it.

Since a lot of the other reviewers had "a salt" problem I didn't add the salt and only used 2TB of soy sauce and I had no salt issue.  I also added the peppers an hour before serving. This dish was very easy to make and I will make it again.

This was awesome!! I have to admit, I didn't have any soy sauce on hand so I didn't add it; I actually added some worschestor sauce in its place??!!! I added minced garlic, as well as the powder. With spices I tend to do my own thing when cooking so I added salt and onion powder also. Some people noted problems with it being too salty, I guess that must be from the soy sauce so I'm glad that I didn't add it. Also, I used a can of diced tomatoes and it all just came out wonderful. A defenite keeper!

This was alright. I followed the directions exactly except added the peppers in a little later and used a tad less salt.  If I make this again I don't think I would add the tsp of salt and I would maybe throw in some mushrooms and serve over mashed potatoes (we tried it on egg noodles).

This was excellent, but we did things differently: my husband doesn't eat beef, so we made this with chicken.  Instead of the beef boullion and water, we used chicken broth.  We let it in the slow cooker for 7 hours (on low).  I think the next time, I would add the peppers 1-2 hrs before the rest is done, they were mushy leaving them in the whole time.

it seemed like the salt and the soy sauce made it too salty, so next time, i'm opting to hold off on the extra salt. other than that it was good.  we wanted a little more flavor, so we put in 2 buillion cubes. served over white rice. it was grrreat!

Very very good....definitely a keeper.  Best to cook half the peppers with the steak and save the other half to be added about an hour before serving.

My family wasn't a big fan, but I liked it.  It tasted like stuffed peppers which I LOVE!  I think this recipe would be much better if cooked on the stove in about 40 minutes.

Just got my first Crockpot last night and put this in before we went to the movies.  It ended up cooking about 4hrs, the meat was falling apart but it was delicious!  I added fresh garlic and used the pre-cut sirloin, it was fairly cheap as I had most everything at home.  Boyfriend who is Colombian said its my best dish yet, something like what his mother would cook.  Great recipe!!

The recipe was nothing special.  It was just okay.  I did add the peppers the last 30 minutes so they would be crunchy still and I added water chestnuts.  My boyfriend said it was just okay, he thought it needed a little more zip.

Wow!  This is really good.  3.5 hours on high is the perfect timing.  I used fresh garlic as I sauteed the beef. I added the green peppers during the last hour and it ended up a  bit mushy.  I will add during last 30 minutes next time.  Feel free to add a dash some green-pepper Tabasco sauce to the mix... Delish!

My three star rating for this recipe is based on several changes/additions that I made.  Like some other reviewers, I added the pepper last and used beef broth (1/2 cup).  I also added a couple of pinches of ginger and some leftover roasted red peppers I had on hand.  I didn't brown the meat and I used fresh minced garlic.  I thought these changes would improve the dish, but my husband didn't care for it at all.  He gave it a 2.5.  I didn't think it was that bad and the meat was really tender, so I gave it a 3.  It just didn't have the flavor we were hoping for.  It wasn't a waste, but I probably won't make again.

I didn't have the boullion cube, and just used some Worchester instead - worked out great.  We served it over plain white rice, which was good.  I could stand to do less peppers and another can of tomatoes next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent -- definitely a keeper.  The meat couldn't be any more tender.  I didn't have the stewed tomatoes or soy sauce in stock -- substituted a can of diced tomatoes and teriakyi sauce instead.  Very simple recipe yet comes to the table like you really had to work it!

The first time I made this dish, it didnt seem to be 5 star worthy. Gave it another try, and this time it seemed much better, the meat was so tender! I put in sliced water chestnuts. Next time I will try adding some ground ginger.

I do not like beef.  I haven't eaten it it 6 years.  However, I decided today to make this recipe.  We all loved it.  The meat is very tender... sort of falls apart in your mouth. Plus, the flavor is yummy.  disappeared quickly.  I used chicken buillons since that is all I had.  Splenda for the sugar.  Everything else I followed exact from the recipe.  A keeper!

For got the bullion, so I used 3/4 can of beef consumme. Also, went with some Ragu basic spaghetti sauce. Worked out very well. Cooked on low for 6 hours. Peppers and onions dissolved (YAY!) and was great with rice. Will make again!

This was okay.  I really like the flavor, but the beef got a little dried out... I don't know if I would brown it ahead of time next time.  I didn't add the peppers until the last hour and used low-fat beef broth rather than boullion.  I also added some ginger and chili oil into it to give it some more zip.

really enjoyed this recipe.  cut the beef a little smaller, about 1/4" strips.  Used a whole medium onion, one red/one green bell pepper and left out the salt as others suggested.  Cooked high for 3 hrs then added the peppers for one more hour.  Wonderful over rice or crunchy noodles.

This was just OK.  One thing that could be changed was to not use sirloin in the crockpot.  The meat fell apart with a couple of turns of the spoon.  The crockpot works so well with cheap cuts of meat.  Why not use stew meat?  The other problem I had with this recipe was a lack of flavor.  I had to dress up the sauce with red pepper flakes, ginger, and another teaspoon of sugar.  After these adjustments, it may have earned a 4, so,   I will try it again.

awesome!  Made some changes, eliminated the salt because of all the salt in the rest of the stuff. Needed more corn starch and I added some hoisin sauce to it.  Made it twice this week, the kids love it! Great the next day.

Followed recipe ideas along with this basic recipe and was pleasantly surprised. First time with this recipe and my kids and I enjoyed it immensely. Added the peppers the last hour of cooking and it was great. Will definitely cook this one again and again.

I can't think of a single reason NOT to give this 5 stars. It is a little different than traditional pepper steak due to the tomatoes and also because the soy flavor wasn't as prevalent.  I much preferred this sauce because it was thin rather than the gloppy cornstarch sauces that usually accompany oriental fare. I had plenty of extra sauce to spoon over rice.

I, literally, toss everything in the pot and walk away.  It turns out just fine.  The meat is tender, the vegetables are a little too done, but that doesn't bother me much.  Husband and kids gobble up every time.

Great recipe, I only added one more tablespoon of cornstarch and one whole package of sliced mushrooms. I added the peppers both at the start and hour before finish. The next time, I will put in all the peppers at the beginning. I also plan on adding another can of tomatoes and a little more sirloin.  What a wonderful recipe, everyone really enjoyed it. The small portion that was left over,tasted even better the next day. Definite 5 stars.

Found something missing with this recipe. Still trying to figure out what it was, but definitely follow the advice of those that recommend not putting in peppers until much later. Too mushy if cooked from the beginning.

I didn't think this was very good at all. It wasn't bad, it was just very bland. I wouldn't make it again.

* * * * * EXCELLENT * * * * *  
I made this recipe yesterday & served with rice.  My only changes were: I used colored peppers & waited until it was cooked to add the corn starch. My only complaint is that I didn’t double the recipe….. I’d kill for some leftovers for lunch!!!  I plan to try it with venison & chicken and maybe even give it a little kick with hot sauce.  
Thanks for the recipe, Lisa

The steak was very tender. Delicious.  I just had to add some more cornstarch to the gravy.

I thought this was ok. It was a little mushy but maybe because I cooked it on low for eight hours. I couldnt add the pepers and onions in at the last min like everyone suggested because I wasnt home. My boyfriend however loved it. So i will make it again, but when I am home to add the rest in the last few hours.

Good, but it is nothing like the chinese dish, green pepper steak.  It tastes more like swiss steak.  Followed recipe exactly with no substitutions.

Very good, very easy.  I cooked it on high for 4 hours, and it came out just right-nice and juicy.  Next time, I might add a little bit of chili peppers, as I found myself wanting that flavor as I was eating it.

When reading the ingredients initially I remember thinking that this did not sound like what I think of as pepper steak. When I think pepper steak, I think chinese food.   Well..I decided to give it a try anyway, and I am glad I did, because it was good..I just didn't think it was fantastic. I only rated 3 stars because if you follow the directions on cooking times you will wind up with a big pot of mush. I even used round steak instead of sirlion (because of it being more economical when feeding a family of 5) and thought that since it was round steak it would be fine cooking a bit longer, but it was overcooked.

I personally like to use my crock pot for meals I can put together in the pot and forget about it until the end of the day. This is not one of those kinds of meals.

Too much of a tomato taste for me, would probably taste best over noodles, I served over brown rice.  Maybe I'll try it again without adding the liquid in the stewed tomatoes.  The flavor resembled a spaghetti sauce a little bit to me not my favorite.

I thought delicous although my husband didn't like.  Utilized low sodium bouillon and light soy sauce and no salt and felt it still came out good.

Pretty good -- I took others advice and added peppers in two stages -- some near then end.  I only had beef round steak in my freezer, so thawed it and cut it into strips.  I was a little worried that it would be tough and chewy in the crockpot, but it was actually wonderfully tender.  Even the kids had no trouble chewing it up.  Older son and husband absolutely inhaled this -- although husband asked for more "gravy" next time.  I may add more broth and thicken with cornstarch near the end when I make this again.  Thanks for a new, easy dinner idea!

This pepper steak turned out great ~ very tender and flavorful! I used red peppers instead of green and I added about a TBSP of worcestershire sauce. Thanks for the recipe!!

I think I used way too much garlic, but it was pretty good nonetheless.
Next time I'll season with a little garlic and some pepper.

My husband really liked this one.  As suggested by others, I used 3 tablespoons cornstarch and 6 tablespoons soy sauce.  I skipped the browning step and the salt and added just 1 green pepper toward the end of the cooking time.  To avoid mushy meat, do not overcook!  In fact, I found this doesn't even need the length of cooking stated in the recipe.  Smells wonderful as it cooks and, served over rice, is delicious comfort food.

I wish I could give this more than 5 stars!  What a phenomenal meal.  I made it along with Vegetable Lovers Fried Rice - and what a hit!  The only thing that made it better was letting it sit in the frig overnight!  Wow!  Do yourself a favor, don't change a THING in this recipe!  Make it as is!

I was somewhat disappointed with this. Perhaps there might have been some error in my preparation, but I am pretty sure I followed the directions well. Something about the sauce flavor, I didn't like, and it seemed like I ended up with too many peppers. Overall, I thought this was only so-so, and if I were to make it again, I'd try a variation to maybe suit it more to my tastes.

This recipe turned out very good with a few changes:  I used venison steak instead of sirloin, added a lot of minched garlic and extra soy sauce.  I added the green peppers and cornstarch during the last 2 hours.  This is the most tender and flavorful venison I have ever had.  The family loved it!

Followed the recipe exactly, was great as-is.  Although certainly not a stellar recipe, I give this slow cooker recipe five stars because most meals that come from the crock pot are never-make-again recipes.  This was easy and everyone asked for seconds.  I will make this again next time I need the convienience that the slow cooker offers.  Thanks

My husband really liked it, I thought it was okay.  I made it with round steak and it had a drier, dull taste.  Next time I will use the sirloin and I will probably like it more. The peppers could be increased with no problem and I will probably increase the cornstarch to make it a tad thicker.  Otherwise it was a good meal to make ahead and have ready when you got home from work.  I served it with rice and eggrolls..

This recipe is easy to make.  I just didn't care for the strong tomato taste; it covered up most of the bell pepper taste.

Delicious!  The thing I love most about this recipe is that it is awesome as-is, but leaves room for your own flair, if you like.  I used a lot of black pepper and a few dashes of ginger.  The house smelled wonderful while it was cooking!  Like previous reviewers, I did not brown the meat and I doubled up on the cornstarch.  I think next time I'll use a bit more, but that's just my personal preference.

This was very good.  I read the reviews first and made some changes.   I used moose meat, I'm not allowed to buy beef when my hubby brings home the "moose"!!  Can't even tell the difference anyway!!! I didn't pre-cook the meat, don't really need to.  I also added 1 can of beef broth which meant I had to double the cornstarch.  It still could have used a little more cornstarch.  Also added the peppers the last 1-2 hours before it was ready.  Cooked on high in a 4 quart slow cooker for 4 1/2 hours.  Very yummy, even picky kids loved it.  Served over egg noodles.

Turned out great!   The only changes I made was, I just used one pepper, since my picky husband doesn't like them and I used pre-sliced fajita beef.  Also, after reading the reviews I added more cornstarch.   Will make again!

Loved it. Will add more cornstarch next time, but it was great. Served it over plain white rice--also added a dash of Tony's seasoning. Yummy!

This was much better than I had expected, and I will definitely make it again.  I thought it would be too "tomatoey", but it wasn't at all.  As others have suggested, I doubled the corn starch, added the peppers for the last 2 hours, added the dry onion soup mix, and didn't pre-cook the meat.  Next time, I'd double or triple the peppers though.

YUM!!  This was sooo easy and delicious!  Only changes I made were adding an extra tbs of cornstarch and adding the green peppers for the last hour of cooking.  Served with basmati rice...mmmmm...

This was the best pepper steak I ever had.  I omitted the browning process and added a can of low sodium beef broth.  My husband loved it also.  I served mine over egg noodles and it made a hearty dinner.  I will make it again and again!

This recipe was great.  I didnt fry the steak beforehand and it made no difference, the steak was nice and tender.   I added 2.5 times more starch than the recipe called for, also added pepper flakes for a little kick.  (Wouldnt recommend the pepper flakes for little ones, too spicy)

I added a little bit of dill and then let the slow cooker do the work. It was so good. My husband and I put the left overs over baked potatoes and it was just as good and very filling. Do try!! :)

Pretty good.  I'd add more seasonings next time, like some red pepper flakes as others have suggested and more garlic!  It was good over egg noddles, but I might have liked it better over rice.  And I think for some reason the sauce needed more thickening for my taste.  But an overall good recipe and easy.

This was a very tasty recipe and so easy. I have never made pepper steak before and this was the perfect beginner recipe. I used sirloin cut into strips. I didn't have any canned tomatoes, so I substituted 2 fresh tomatoes diced and a can of tomato sauce. I think next time I will add a bit of cayenne to spice it up a bit. Other than that, this was SO good, even my picky husband loved it. Thanks Marge!

This is very easy and has great flavor.  I did not add additional salt (soy sauce is high enough in sodium), and did add a few dashes of red pepper flakes along with red and yellow peppers (in addition to the green).  My husband ate it up!  If I can't find him while shopping at the mall, he is always at the food court eating pepper steak.  Now, I have an effortless way to serve it at home, even when I am too busy to cook.

This recipe was really quick, easy and good!  My steak broke down a lot during the cooking process (which usually happens during slow cooking) so it was not as together as I would have liked, but I will definitely make this again.

Very easy recipe with good flavor.  We don't like green peppers, so we substituted red and yellow.  Also, I only had london broil in the house and it turned out just fine - the steak was VERY tender.

Very good, smells great when cooking and easy too. I thought the sauce ended up thin, and after reading some other reviews realized doubling the amount of cornstarch next time will help. I don't think I'll bother browning the meat next time as it took most of the prep time, and it would cook fine in the crock pot. We loved this over egg noodles. My husband likes more kick, so he added hot sauce and was very happy. Good recipe!

Delicious on rice.  Add more peppers.  Red, orange and yellow ones are really attractive.  I cut down on the amount of tomatoes so dish is more oriental tasting than stew-y.

This is so delicious!  I used tri-tip steaks because that's what I had in the freezer, and I doubled the recipe and it turned out WONDERFUL!  Made some brown rice just before it was done and dinner was on the table!  Will certainly make this again!

This is just too good. My husband asks me to make this often. We like it on rice and sometimes we put it in tortillas. Whatever way we eat it, it is always  perfect. Thanks Marge

What a truly wonderful recipe. Quick and Easy.  My whole family loved it!! I just added a tablespoon extra of cornstarch at the last 1/2 hour because the sauce was too runny and needed a little more thicking.  Thanks so much, Debbie

I used an additional can of tomatoes, increased the soy sauce to 1/3 Cup (low salt), and used a whole red onion cut into chunks.  Wonderful!!  And the house smelled great all day!

This was easy and delicious...but being a Texan, I added a couple chopped jalapenos, some cumin and cilantro for some additional zip and flavor.
Will definitely make again.

Very easy to prepare. Added a touch of Plum Sauce to the pot. Resulted in very tender meat. Great served over egg noodles as suggested. Appreciated by all in my house. Not spicy enough to my taste though.

Wonderful flavour and very easy.  I would agree to put the peppers in half way through cooking so they are not too soft.

After having this pepper steak at my daughter's home (KarenHeaslip), I had to make it. My substitution was 2 cups peeled & chunked home-grown tomatoes cooked with a little celery seed for the stewed tomatoes and I added 1 1/2 tsp. grated fresh ginger to the slow cooker. I used venison for the meat and will add a teaspoon of toasted sesame oil before serving over rice. It smells delicious!  Thanks Karen & Marge!

Wow!  We loved this!  Really great tasting, and especially tasty when served over fried rice!  I gave it 3 stars on the kid friendliness only because my grandchildren are too young to help prepare this.  But they sure did eat it!

My family enjoyed this dish very much!  I added half of the peppers at the start of cooking time and the remainder 1.5 hours before the end of cooking time (6 hours on Low max). It came out tender and delicious.  I have already passed this recipe on to two people who were looking for a good Pepper Steak recipe....this one is it!

OMG, so tasteful!! The steak literally fell apart, it's so tender! I followed the recipe mostly, only substituting what I didn't have. No cornstarch. Garlic salt instead of powder, and beef stock instead of beef bouillon. Ifinished the metal on top of white jasmine rice.  The husband has demanded this as a mainstay in the menu now, and I completely agree!

I make this an even easier way, using a couple cans of Ro-Tel (sometimes the 'original', and sometimes one of the other varieties) in place of the bell peppers and canned tomatos.

This was super easy to prepare and turned out fantastic. As written it needed more seasoning, I doubled the garlic powder and added onion powder, red pepper flakes. I didn’t have beef bouillon, I used beef broth instead. I will definitely make this dish again.

I made just as instructed except I had no soy sauce and use Worcestershire sauce instead. That most likely  why I gave a 4 instead of a 5.  I will try again with soy sauce.

I love this dish! So easy and tasty. I used Basil, Garlic & Oregano diced tomatoes instead of plain- I enjoy very flavorful dishes. I sliced vegetables instead of chopping as well. I typically add a little more onion and put in half the vegetables at the start and the other half about an hour before it is done. This allows for some stewy softer vegetables with the crunch of firmer vegetables.

The stewed tomatoes in this recipe seemed a surprise ingredient for pepper steak which in my opinion is Asian.  I almost decided to leave them out.  So glad I didn't!  We loved this, though I had a few adaptations.  I used beef broth rather than bullion and water.  Mixed the cornstarch into that.  I also used a London Broil I'd gotten on sale and cut it into smaller width strips.  It browned quickly and I added the ingredients, except salt (not sure why it's called for with bullion and soy, both of which are salty).  I followed another reviewer's suggestion to add 1/2 t grated ginger and a splash of Worcestershire.  I also waited to add the peppers until about the last hour, as we prefer firmer veggies.  My cooker may run warmer than others or perhaps because my beef strips were thinner, in 4 hours on low this was truly ready!  I served over rice and added a few chow mein noodles on the top for crunch.  Next time I might try toasted sesame seeds.  Thanks MJWAGNER68 for a real keeper of a recipe.  I think either chicken or pork would be great cooked like this.

This was really good served over Jasmine rice, I will definitely make this again! Per other reviewers, I did make the following slight changes: used minced garlic (2 TBL), dash of red pepper flakes, dash of ginger. Cooked for 6 hours on low and it was delicious!

Excellent.

Used diced tomatoes and drained excess liquid first.

Added plenty of fresh ground pepper, some white wine, and a couple of bay leaves and served with home made mashed potatoes.  Used orange peppers for a Festive fall touch

Definitely a do over!

Thanks

Very tasty.  I omitted the salt and was glad I did.  I prepared the recipe in an instant pot, searing the beef, adding the remaining ingredients, and pressure cooking for 20 minutes.  I may try 15 minutes next time.  The meat was very tender, and I served over brown rice.

I also used precut sirloin for stir fry, 3lbs. The meat is fork tender. I always use beef base instead of bouillon, other than that , I made it exactly. My family can’t wait for me to make it again!!

The only changes I made were to leave out the salt and add the peppers toward the end, at the suggestion of other reviewers. Still a little salty. Over rice, it tastes like stuffed peppers. Overall a good recipe.

This recipe came out amazing, my entire family loved it, even my picky six year old. I followed the recipe as is, except added fresh garlic instead of the powder. I served it over rice and it was a total hit. Love it, can't wait to make it again.

Excellent recipe.  I used red, yellow & orange peppers rather that green (personal preference), and round steak.  I also doubled the recipe to be able to freeze half.  Worked perfectly. Served over rice.

I made the changes that others suggested:  use red and yellow peppers vs green, omit salt, reduce soy sauce by 1 tablespoon,  add 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, and, at the end add 2 more tablespoons of cornstarch to some of the juice and mix in to create the final product.  I also did what other said and added the peppers later.  I cooked on high for 2 hours, added peppers, and then cooked on high for 2 more hours.  My family said it tasted almost like sweet and sour beef...but not really. Ha!  Regardless, they loved it and asked for it again!

This dish had a very nice taste but I believe it could have been better if it had not cooked so long. In the crock pot my meat just fell apart instead of remaining in it's strip style. It was a little on the salty side. I made this recipe just as it was written and I will make it again but with some adjustments. For one, once I sprinkle the meat with garlic powder, it will go into the crock without making it to the skillet. Sirloin is not cheap and it doesn't take so many hours to cook. It will be cooked for about 2 hours and no more. It doesn't need to go into a crock pot because it is not a tough cut of meat so I'll cook it on the stovetop instead. I served it on top of rice, which was a nice compliment.

The meat was tender and delicious. I used sliced red, yellow and orange bell peppers instead of green and bought the pre-sliced stir fry beef. The taste of the stewed tomatoes was a bit overpowering for me, but my mom loved it.

This was a very easy recipe to follow  and it came out very delicious. I used a fat tri tip steak instead of sirloin which can b very pricy.. tri tip was just as good I thought —which I cut into large 2 inch chunk strips, and it came out super tender and great. I would suggest using a white onion and a couple cloves of garlic in there

Easy peasy to put together, wish I had thought to add some ginger, it would've bumped up the flavor.  Didnt read all the reviews, maybe someone already recommended it.  Good as is, but feel free to add more flavoring agents.  And for sure, wait til the last hour to add your peppers, otherwise they dissolve.

Yummy!  I did not cook the meat.  I just added all the ingredients into the crockpot and went to work.  I didn’t add the cornstarch before serving. I served this over rice and it was delicious. I will place this on my easy work day rotation for sure.  Thank you for sharing!

I did make a couple of changes, but this recipe makes a great starting point. I chopped fresh garlic to brown the meat with, then used the juice from the meat to mix with the corn starch. I also used one each, green, red, and orange bell pepper for added color. I will definitely make this again.

I followed the recipe except I used 2 tablespoons of teriyaki sauce instead of the soy sauce because it was what I had on hand. I wasn't crazy about the flavor, but it may have been better with the soy. I am trying a new recipe this week that is similar but has ginger, broccoli, and mushrooms added.

Will definitely make again.  Actually requested by the wife that I do so.   I stayed fairly true to the recipe except I followed suggestions by others and omitted the salt.  Did not need it IMHO.  Also did add the peppers about an hour before serving.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I've made it with bottom round steak and pork roast. They both work great in the crock pot. Other than that my only changes were added seasoning and more liquid than called for so there's plenty of sauce for the rice. Four stars because it's a good solid recipe, not something that makes me feel like I've died and gone to heaven.

It was  easy to make, I didn't have any soy sauce  so I used 
Teriyaki sauce and it tasted pretty good. 
I would make it again.

I followed the exact recipe this time however, I will make a couple of slight prep changes next time.  I will cut both my onion and peppers in bigger pieces and I will wait till about 1/2 way through the cook time before adding them so that they have more crunch left in them.   All in all, this was delicious!  Loved it!

the peppers in the last two hours of cooking.

I used elk meat and yellow and red peppers. I thought it was pretty tasty but my husband said it didn’t have enough flavor. Maybe next time I will put in more garlic  and may add some grill mate  seasoning.

This was very good I used flat iron steak and a whole onion and cooked it for 3 hours on high adding the peppers an hour before it finished.It was done perfectly for us. You could use this for pork chops or chicken thighs too. Great recipe, simple and versatile.

I used one red pepper and one green pepper instead of two green peppers as the original recipe. I had to double the cornstarch because one tablespoon didn’t thicken the juice. My family really liked the Peppered Steak. We have added it to one of our favorite dishes for dinner!

I think the chicken stock turned the recipe a little bland. Next time I will cook with white wine and add soy at the end.

When I saw the price of sirloin steak I bought chuck steak instead and it was tasty and tender at half the price. Also gave it an Italian flavor with oregano and basil instead of soy sauce.

This was delicious!!! As was recommended by someone else, I left out the teaspoon of salt, as I'm trying to cut down. Even with that, I could have used less, so I'm going to make a point of using low sodium *everything* wherever I can when I make it again (not the bullion, though). And I *will* be making this again, and again! Delicious!

Very tender and very easy to do before work.  Don’t overlook your meat dishes, use a programmable crock or ask someone to turn it on at a set time.

Excellent dinner. I left out the salt as many reviews suggested. Also I cut the peppers and the onions into thick slices so they wouldn’t disappear after the extended cooking. I did use more cornstarch than stated in recipe...and I cooked on low for six hours and added the peppers the last two hours.  I would def do this again!

Used what I had on hand; moose and coloured peppers. Went over well with others too, so that's always a bonus.
Yes, I would make it again.

This is a delicious recipe.  The changes I made were that I had an extra Anaheim pepper that I added along with everything else. Also after searing the meat I still had a lot of oil in the pan so I made a quick roux out it, instead of the slurry. It came out wonderful. I like this recipe because it is so easy to prep and tastes so good.

This was pretty tasty. I made it just as described except like some other reviewers I put the peppers in near the end--I cooked for 5 hours on low without the peppers, then 1 more hour with the peppers, and they were cooked just right (soft but not mush). I didn't quite have 2 pounds of beef but it still seemed fine (I had more like a pound and a half). 

I think it could use a little extra kick--maybe a little ginger. I'm going to try that next time.

I made this, and it turned out nicely.  The reason for the lower rating for me is the Tomatoes included in the recipe.  I think it made this taste strange and not really like pepper steak.

My husband and son are hunters, so I'm continually looking for recipes I can adapt for wild game. I tried this with venison (not even the best cuts) and it was great! The meat was fork-tender and not at all strong tasting. I let it cook on low all day while we were at work, so it was longer than suggested. The flavors were well balanced and slightly asian-y. I served it over basmati rice, with a side of salad. I'm sure it would be delicious with beef also. I will definitely make this again.

Used diced tomatoes and 1 tsp of sugar as a substitute for stewed tomatoes.
Added 1/2 tsp of ginger powder and 1 tsp black pepper.

In the last 30 minutes with crockpot on high, I added about 5 tbsp of cornstarch with minimal cold water to thicken the sauce.

Well I made this recipe but because my t-bone steak, which I used, turned out dry,  I discovered another recipe by altering this one a bit.  I ended up making the best soup my husband ever had.   
 Now I leave the steak whole while it cooks. Since I don’t have the bouillon cube or cornstarch, I add a heaping tablespoon of gravey mix to the 1/4 cup of water.  Omit the salt.  Everything else is the same.

When it was all done in the slow cooker, I take out the steak and chopped it in cubes, add chicken broth and some Worcestershire sauce, a can of potatoes diced and voila, a beautiful hearty soup for winter.

I used organic white (diced) n red onions (sliced thin), while browning the meat I add black pepper, also add 1 tbsp of lq. smoke (hickory) & teriyaki, also organic petite tomato w/juice. I used 1 cp. organic chicken broth instead of beef cube to keep the other flavors stronger . Oh I used a 2.34 lb London Broil (Had a couple, they were on sale )lol . But used all the rest of the recipe . LOL  (:-)  Thank you !!  It is really good. Making it for our choir Christmas Party today . 12/08/18

Quick, easy,  reasonably priced,  good taste if you like preppers, canned stewed tomatoes are a bit big to my liking. So I diced the stewed tomatoes. Great for a family on the go

the meat was tender and the veggies well done, it was slightly salty. I would probably make it again but cut back on the soy sauce.

My children asked for seconds!

Since I found this recipe midafternoon,  I used a dutch oven for 1 hour of simmering instead of the slow cooker and it was juicy, flavorful, and full of flavor.

Made this pretty much as stated, left out the salt and sugar.  I added a bell pepper cut in half at the beginning to flavor, then pulled it out and added more pepper an hour before serving.  I also thickened with cornstarch at the end before serving.  We all loved it over rice.  Thanks!

Smelled like it was going to be super strong/spicy throughout the entire crock pot cooking process but it literally came out perfect! We used Zatarain's Spanish rice to serve it over, and we loved it! The meat was a perfect consistentcy after 3 1/2 hours on high in the crock pot. Will FOR SURE be making it again in the future!

I made this recipe exactly as stated but I ended up having to make my own stewed tomatoes because I left it off my shopping list.  This was delicious and my whole family loved it.  The beef was so tender due to slow cooking.  This will definitely be on our meal rotation.

I make this recipe frequently at our house! I usually use a whole round steak and break it into pieces as soon as it's done. It's always fork tender and easy to break up. Also, if you want a little kick try subbing rotel instead of stewed tomatoes. I serve this with the easy oven brown rice from this site and steamed broccoli! Thanks for a good recipe!

The only changes were I used stew meat instead bc I couldn't find sirloin strips and used low sodium soy sauce. It was delicious!

WOW! Such a simple, filling and amazing dish. I didn't have bouillon so I omitted that step and used a cup of beef broth. I probably quadrupled the onion because we love it and used brown sugar just because. Served over thai brown rice noodles... superb!

This was very good. I skipped the browning in skillet part. I tripled the gravy ingredients so we would have extra gravy for the rice. I added a tsp of black pepper and a tsp onion powder. I also added the pepper strips the last hour to the crockpot so they wouldn’t be too soggy.

I have actually made this recipe 3 times now (forgot to rate and write a review - sorry!).  I love this recipe and every time I make it, I get rave reviews from the family. I love making recipes that I find on Allrecipes and the family tells me "You should actually look into becoming a professional cook" and I am thinking to myself is "All I am doing is following the directions/instructions on the recipe". Thanks for making me look like a professional CHEF! :-)

My husband I loved this. He went back for seconds. I followed the advice from other reviews and waited to add the peppers until in the last hour. I also used more of tomatoes, added worcheshire sauce, chopped garlic, mushrooms, red pepper flakes. Next time I will try pineapple in there too! These were great over egg noodles.

I personally didn’t like it, but my husband & inlaws enjoyed it.
Only thing is I would wait to add the peppers later than in the beginning,they became to mushy.

I love using this recipe as a base! I sear an entire flat iron steak and keep it whole in the crockpot, then shred it when the meat is cooked. I usually use 3 peppers- 2 green and one red and add more cornstarch at the end. So good!!

My boyfriend and I made this over chow mein noodles cooked with garlic and soy sauce. Very delicious! The meat was tender and the dish was quite flavorful. We like a bit of heat, so we added some sliced hot peppers in oil as a topping, but next time will try adding that into the slow cooker. As many others suggested, we added the green peppers and onion after 3 hours.

Has such a good flavor and easy to throw in the crockpot in the morning. I did not use salt, since soy sauce is already pretty salty. I added a couple dashes of worchester sauce, and seasoned the beef with garlic powder and black pepper. I substituted fresh diced Roma tomatoes with a dash of ketchup, since I didn’t have any canned ones on hand. I prefer my peppers soft, and I think it gives the meat a nice flavor, so I added mine at the beginning. I also used red and yellow peppers and it was still delicious. This will be a staple in our house.

Very good!  I used three peppers, and increased liquid with beef cube to one cup.  Used tenderized cube steak as that’s what I had on hand, and one can of diced tomatoes.

My family liked it ok- it was very thick- could use more liquid, I also added a tablespoon of minced garlic and since all the meat fell apart I feel like I could have used chuck roast meat instead of sirloin. I also added the peppers for the last hour- that was the only thing still in slices. 

 My neighbor made it as well this week. She said they loved it. She added an extra half cup of water for more gravy-- I wish I had too.

I have made this twice now. Both times I have substituted stew beef in place of sirloin and flour in place of corn starch. The second time I made it I also doubled the amount of soy sauce and the stewed tomatoes. My wife and I really liked it both ways, but preferred it with the extra tomatoes.

The steak was very tender, but this was extremely bland. At first it was made exactly to the recipe and it was very boring in flavor. We added devils spit bbq sauce and Worcestershire to ours to give it a little more flavor. It definitely needs more seasoning.

This is a very good and easy recipe for pepper steak. I have filed it for future use. As a rule, I go heavy on the sauce preparation to make to our taste and to thicken accordingly. I just poured off the excess liquid after cooking the meat. Excellent, Maria! Your recipe,

I accidentally bought Mexican Style stewed tomatoes, but decided to use them anyway. It came out great! They probably added a little punch to the flavor. We will be sure to try the original version soon. Great recipe!

I modified the recipe some, to adjust for a large batch quantity (made 12 servings and froze 2/3 of it in portions). I also caramelized the onions a little in the pan I browned the beef in, and I added more peppers (yellow, orange, and red ones) to the crock.

It came out great and was really good over some Jasmine white rice.

This will be a regular in my rotation. The flavors are reminiscent of the stir-fry version of pepper steak, but blended so deliciously with the tomatoes, and the meat is tender. I was relieved, however, to have followed my instincts and drastically reduced the amount of sodium. 

My modifications included  no-salt added stewed tomatoes, 2 TBS of low sodium soy sauce, no additional salt, no sugar, and I made the slurry using Better Than Bouillon (taste preference) instead of a cube. I like to bulk up a recipe with extra vegetables so I used three ribs of sliced celery, which complimented the flavors nicely. As for the sugar - I saw no need for it, the cooked peppers provide plenty of sweet. It was plenty salty enough - next time I will go down to 1.5 TBS of soy sauce or maybe even substitute coconut aminos. Served it with mashed sweet potatoes. It doesn't get much more comforting than that!

Note for Instant Pot cooks -the slow cooker function on medium for 2.5 hours was perfect timing.

Loved this easy and flavorful creation!  I followed the suggestions of others:  substituted brown sugar for white sugar, added Worcestershire sauce and cut the green peppers into slices and added to pot about 30 minutes before it was done.  Served it over rice -- delish!

Great recipe. I double the sauce recipe and add carrots, celery, broccoli and peppers. The broccoli and peppers I added at the end so they were crisp. Great for left overs!

DO NOT put the peppers in with all of the ingredients.  Add the peppers during the last hour otherwise you will have green and red mush. (I use red and green)  Once I add the peppers, I take a little broth out and mix in a cup with 1-2TBL of cornstarch (until there are no lumps) to thicken the sauce.  I prefer a  thicker sauce, especially, when serving over rice.  If you use the cut of meat the recipe calls for it will taste good and since it's being slow cooked, the meat will not be tough.  However, one time I used sirloin the steak and it tasted amazing versus just good.  Of course it's more expensive but there was a big difference in taste.  My son really likes this.

This is a FABULOUS dish, and so easy to make!

I departed from as printed by using home-made stewed tomatoes, which were pretty sweet, so I did not add more sugar.  We LOVE peppers, so used six medium sized ones, just cut into quarters.  For beef, I used a London Broil cut cross-grain in 3/8" strips.  I did add the peppers later so they were firmer - 
Loved it, and am making it again today!

This is very good. I used thick cut sirloin steak with very little fat on it. I'm not a big fan of green peppers, I like red/ orange/ yellow peppers better. Since I had an orange and yellow pepper I needed to use, I decided to do both of those along with one green pepper. Based on reviews I did add an extra Tbls of cornstarch mixed with a Tbls of water in the last hour to thicken the sauce some. I also added the peppers with 2 hours left. They came out very soft but not mushy. However, if you like crisp peppers I would add them in the last hour. I ate this with brown rice. Will make again!

Made this for an adult birthday party. It was barely touched at the end of dinner.  People took very little and ate a lot of the sides I had made. My fiance said it was "okay".  It lacked flavor.

I made this recipe but I had more meat than the recipe called for so I upped the onion and instead of a 14.5 ounce can of tomatoes, I used the bigger can and used a bit more bouillon and corn starch to compensate for extra ingredients.  What an easy and super yummy meal! This will now be part of the rotation- it's wonderful!

This is easy and delicious.  Other than omitting the garlic, due to an allergy, I followed the recipe and it turned out very well.  No thickening of the sauce required or anything.  I think some crushed red pepper or some chili sauce may have improved it, but it was very good as written.

Not bad, but ended up tasting like 99% of most slow cooker recipes. I didn't add the salt and put in the peppers for last hour only which gave it a great texture.

Made it for a crowd (doubled recipe) and it was a hit!  As several people mentioned, I doubled (in this case, quadrupled) the sauce.  Used red, fellow and green peppers for color.  Added later on, as was suggested.  Used low-sodium bullion cubes and soy sauce and skipped the salt completely.  Served over garlic mashed potatoes.

I've made this twice and really do love it.  It makes plenty for leftovers if there's only one, like me.  Great taste.  I notice that it seems like there is not enough liquid when you put it in the slow cooker, but when it's done, there's plenty of liquid and it is delicious.

This is an excellent dish that our entire family loves. I don't add the salt since the bouillon cube adds enough salty flavor. It is too salty if I add both.

This was a tasty, easy meal to make.  Next time I want to try making it without first browning the beef.  I followed the recipe, except that I omitted the salt, and added 1 green/1 red pepper about an hour before serving, based on other's reviews.

I'm a huge fan of pepper steak and this was, by far, the best recipe I've found yet....both for flavor and ease of preparation.  I had to use stir-fry chuck steak but the crockpot made it tender and tasty all the same.

This meal was great! We used a quinoa blend instead of rice as our starch because that was all we had to put this pepper steak on and even my son ate some of it (considering he doesn't eat much of anything that is amazing).  I made this in an instant pot and cooked the meat for 20 minutes, then added the veggies for 5 minutes.  The veggies were a little soft, so I will only go for 3 minutes next time.  Also, to save money I bought Tender Chuck Steak instead of sirloin.  I cut it across the grain and it was fork tender.  All in all, this recipe cooked in the instant pot, will become a regular in our menu.

I just used a chuck roast and tossed it in the crockpot.  No slicing or browning.  Used red and orange peppers instead of green.  The second time I made it also tossed in some potatoes cut into wedges.  I told the kids it was Chinese Pot Roast so they wouldn't be expecting traditional pepper steak.   Whole family loved it.  Will be adding it to my regular rotation.

This recipe was ok. I followed the advice of some of the reviewers and left out the extra salt. I also waited until the last 1.5 hours to add the peppers and onions so the texture was still a little firm

My husband loved it. I followed the recipe exactly. I will make it again, but wait to add the vegetables until cooking time is half over. I thought the vegetables were to overcooked for my taste.

This was a great hit for dinner tonight!  I added some fajita seasoning to the steak while browning for extra flavor, three bell peppers and a dash of chili pepper flakes.  I will absolutely be making this again.  Thank you for a great and easy recipe!!

I read the reviews before making and put the green peppers in the last hour. They cooked pretty fast and should have put them in the last half an hour, as I like kinda firm veges. Also I had put the onions in the last hour.In my slow cooker couple of hours is enough as in three hours it was kinda overdone but still deliciou. Did not add any salt.The dish turned out to be delicious and will definitely make it again. Very tasty!!!! Thank you.

Slow cooker pepper steak.  I use sirloin tips and cut my peppers smaller than shown.  This recipe is a keeper.  Everyone loves it.  The tips come out so tender it is incredible.

My hubby wasn't wild about it, but I thought it was tasty. It was easy to throw together but lacked something. I still haven't quite put my finger on it though.  I cut the recipe in half, including the meat, and I shouldn't have done that. So I guess all-in-all, for our taste it was short on meat.

I doubled the meat, used one green, one orange, and one yellow bell pepper, cut the stewed tomatoes up so they'd be distributed a little better, and added a little more cornstarch to thicken the sauce a bit more, so it would cling to the rice, and instead of the bullion cube, used "Better than Bullion" soup base. I used steamed Jasmine Rice (our favorite rice), and then also made a side of green beans with butter, pasta and salad elegance, and some real bacon bits. This was delicious, and we're all looking forward to the leftovers for tomorrow.

I made this dish and I loved it.  I used all of the spices recommended and added onion powder and steak seasoning. I found the secret to this dish was the soy sauce. Once adding in the corn starch it makes it a little bland, so I added a few more tablespoons to put more flavor back into the dish. Don't over due the cornstarch either, it takes away the flavor  plus it thickens as you leave it in the crock pot.  Overall, I think this was a good easy quick dish (I left in the crock pot for 4 hours). Its also pretty kid friendly too, my son ate the steak and left the rice. Would probably work over mashed potatoes as well.

I doubled the recipe and used yellow and red peppers as well as green. I also used less soy sauce and added Worcestershire sauce. As suggested in other teviews, I waited until the last hour to add my peppers. My family loved it as did I. I served it over jasmine rice with steamed carrots.

Adding the vegetables at the same time as the meat makes the veggies way too over-cooked. Steak was good, can't really go wrong on that, but the peppers and onion were mush.

I did this in my ceramic Dutch oven. Started on the stove top and finished in the oven for an hour. I waited and added my peppers in the last fifteen minutes of cooking. It turned out perfectly.

Excellent, in regular rotation for dinner. I add a little woreschester sauce and add the peppers about 3 hours before it is done so they don't get so mushy. Great over simple white rice.

I started this early morning and then ran my errands! I used sirloin steak as a meat, it was on sale. Came home and the house smelled so good! I didn't find this salty at all, I thought the meld of favors very nice. But I thought at the time I would have added another can of tomatoes. I made Amish egg noodles with this and Bisquick biscuits. This is comfort food to me and I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner. I can't wait for leftovers.

Madie it several times pretty much as the recipe is written.  All the family love it!  Usually make twice what I need as it freezes well for a ready meal later in the week.

I made the recipe as is, but while the meat was tender and delicious, the green peppers took on a bitter, mushy flavor / texture and might be better served with a red pepper and a yellow pepper. Likewise, while the onion was ok, I've recently found that yellow onions do a little better than white onions in recipes of this nature. It didn't help that we aren't huge tomato fans, admittedly, but I will likely use this as a base and modify the vegetable and sauce contents.

Good recipe. Meat was very tender. Next time I make it I will add more cornstarch to make the sauce thicker.

I subbed Worcestershire for soy sauce. I used flour instead of corn starch since I did not have any of these ingredients. Therefore, I omitted the sugar and the salt since my substitutes had them. I also sliced up 2 garlic cloves and added with the vegetables. I cooked on high for 3 hrs. I did need to make a flour slurry with the slow cooked liquid that I added 15 minutes before  serving.  It was a big hit. Will definitely make this again.

I will  most definitely make this again! 
This turned out absolutely delicious served over rice. I chose to cook on low for 6 hours and the meat melted in your mouth. I did cut the green peppers into strips, and following another reviewer's recommendation I waited to put them in one (1) hour before serving.  It turned out perfectly as the peppers were still crisp.  I also added more water /  corn starch mixture and stired it in 30 minutes before serving to thicken up the  liquid which other reviewers mentioned and it made a very nice gravy over the rice.

I made this Gluten Free. All I had to do was make sure the bullion & soy sauce were Gluten Free. It is in my Instant Pot cooking now, I am sure it will be great! will be serving with fresh mashed potatoes.

I made this tonight.  Listened to other reviewers who recommended adding worcestershire sauce, more soy sauce and subbing brown sugar for the white.  I also added hot sauce and did not add sugar.  I made the mistake of not doubling the corn starch as recommended and will do so in the future.  The sauce was very tasty but thin.  Very easy recipe for a good hearty meal.  Will make again.

Everyone loved it even our son's friend who is a guest at our house this weekend.  Went to the store and bought beef strips and already sliced packets of red and green peppers and onions so it cut down on the slicing and dicing time.  I also did not add extra salt as the bouillon and stewed tomatoes already had it .  Served over rice.  Will be making this again soon.

Making  this as I'm writing this review, and I must say, it smells wonderful! I was afraid to add the salt at the beginning, so I waited after a few hours of cooking, then tasted. Needed a bit of salt and I can't wait till time to eat! Yum!! I used low sodium soy sauce and low sodium beef broth instead of the bouillon. Delicious!!

This is a new favorite in my house. My whole family enjoyed the dish, even my toddlers. I cooked mine 3.5 hours on high. I did add my peppers the last 1.5 hours and added cornstarch with water at the same time for a thicker sauce. Served over rice. Will make again.

It was okay as written. I didn't add salt. I did made it using a top round London Broil cut. It lacked a lot of flavor. I added a few minced cloves of garlic, about a tsp of rice vinegar (apple cider would work), a tsp of mirin (sherry would work), a pinch of crushed red pepper, 1/2 - 3/4 tsp ground ginger, 1 tbs Worcestershire and 1 tbs oyster sauce (Maggi or Kitchen Bouquet would work). I also had to increase the soy sauce to 4 tbs, the veg oil to sesame oil, the onion to 1 full cup, the white sugar to brown sugar and the water + cornstarch mixture to 1 c and 3 tbs to make it appropriately thick.

Was very easy to prepare .. Changes I made, instead of the beef bullion I use broth, red and yellow bell peppers instead of green and added them toward the end of the cooking time so they wouldn't get mushy

This was good! The other comments about the salt were correct, I don't think there needs any extra salt with the bouillon and the soy sauce. I was pressed for time and planned on making it in the slow cooker but it was already to late so I made everything on stove and it turned out great. Just cooked it the order is said and added everything to a large frying pan.

Very good and easy to make.  I used real garlic instead of the powder.  The leftovers tasted even better the next day.  I served this over noodles.

I have made this several times.  We are not steak lovers but this is so tender and the flavours  of peppers and onions with the tomatoes is great.  I also add some slice mushrooms.  I recommend using the top sirloin noted in the recipe and also get it from your butcher.

This was great!  So tasty!  I did wait until the last couple of hours to put in the peppers as per suggestions from others. The peppers were still mushy so I may leave it till the last hour next time.  But that did not really deter from the awesomeness of this recipe.  I served over Suzy's Mashed Red Potatoes (recipe on this site) and it made almost like a Shepard's Pie.  This will be in my regular rotation.

This was tasty and easy to make. We served it over egg noodles (huband's preference) but I think it would be better over brown rice. I made this exactly as written except that I followed the suggestions to wait until the last hour to add peppers and onions...they don't need long. Thanks for the recipe!

My mother used to make a recipe similar to this and it had been on my mind for quite a while to try and find a recipe similar.  I found this and was not disappointed.  I added 3 stalks of celery (cut into 1/2" slices) for the last hour of cooking and then a can of water chestnuts for the last 1/2 hour.  I also used Top Round instead of sirloin and it was so tender you could cut it with a fork.
*** By slicing and browning the meat, I found that the cook time on "low" actually only took 4 hours.  I cooked it for 6 hours but it made the meat break apart like a brisket.  I recommend cooking on low for 3 hours, adding the celery for the last hour and then adding the water chestnuts for the last half hour.***

This was actually pretty fantastic. However, the one change I would make next time is not to add the peppers until there's an hour or less left. When they cook for four hours they basically dissolve, leaving the skins behind.
Oh, and I used beef stock in place of the bullion cube because of the "too salty" comments. It was great! I had a rice bowl for dinner for several nights.

I made a few alterations . Instead of beef broth, I used vegetable broth. I omitted the cornstarch. I doubled the liquid ingredients because there wasn't enough the first time I made this. These alterations worked just fine. Family and guests love it! *Recommended

I made this last night and it was amazing and the whole family loved it! I did not add the salt into the recipe and I think it came out fine. I did add a few shakes of red pepper flakes and a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce along with fresh garlic, ground black pepper and broccoli. Also I used one of each color of peppers. If you like crispier peppers I would recommend saving some to add at the end but definitely start with at least half in the pot to get the flavor *hence pepper steak*. I will make this again.

Way too many modifications needed to make this good. Between the soggy veggies, the liquidified "gravy" and the lack of grounded pepper in pepper steak this was ok at best. I'm noticing a ton of modifications done in the comments as well but still people give the recipe a 5 star when you have to change half of the recipe. A five star recipe means nothing needed to be changed or added. The rating on this site in general is super misleading.

This is great!   I used a lean sirloin steak, added carrots cut into strips, and used lots of  fresh garlic instead of powered.  Also used low sodium soy and only a half cube of bouillon to cut down on the salt, and it was still outstanding. Served it over brown rice with a side of garlic & butter sauteed mushrooms, w/ a nice pinot noir.  Great meal.  Def. put in the peppers the last 45 min or so and they'll be cooked perfectly.  A worthy add to the dinner rotation.

Absolutely delicious, it's totally a 5* recipe, however it needed more garlic and chopped onion than was said (personal taste). definitely does NOT need the extra salt, the bouillon was just fine. Ended up using London broil as it was on sale, and even with a different cut was still absolutely delicious and tender. Will make again!

Good but not great.  Tomato sauce taste throws off dish a bit. Suggest beef and broccoli recipe without tomatoes if you're looking for this kind of flavor.

I've been making this dish for 2 years. My family absolutely loves it. My daughter actually said to me,"This gets better every time you make it!" It's one of my "go to" meals along side slow cooker sweet and sour chicken. I keep a few cans of stewed tomatoes in my pantry and always have a few pounds of stake in my freezer. All I need to purchase at the grocery store is an onion since all the other ingredients I consisting have on hand. I HIGHLY recommend serving this over jasmine rice. This recipe is incredibly easy and delicious....I hope ur family enjoys it as much as mine!!! :)

I've tried making this several times and the results are never as good as what I hope.  The peppers always come out really bitter after having been cooked a long time and it makes the whole dish taste off.

Loved this recipe. I used veggis I had on hand and tossed them in there as well. (carrot, celery, broccoli, and water chesnuts) 
I omitted salt. Added a dash of Worcestershire.  One bay leaf. Added fresh minced garlic, ground and red pepper flakes. Additionally there is no need to brown the meat. I threw it all in there. It comes out delicious! Served over rice. Yum yum!

Next time I would put in the meat and sauce first, and wait and add the red pepper/green pepper later so they don't get too soft and overcooked.

My family loved this pepper steak served over brown rice. I doubled the sauce, used 2 cloves of garlic instead of garlic powder, omitted the salt and added a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes. I also accidentally bought one can of stewed tomatoes w/peppers & onions and one can w/ basil & oregano, but it was still really good. My husband liked it so much he told me to make it with the same tomatoes the next time. I'll be making this again tomorrow for my mother since she's a fan of pepper steak. Thanks for the great recipe!

OK this was a trial and error recipe for me.  I originally bought steaks, and sliced them into strips and followed the recipe, and what a disaster.  Toughest strips of meat ever.  I tried it again with pre cut stew meat, and it was so tender and wonderful.  The second time I tripled the peppers using red/green/orange bell peppers, and doubled the onion because, well because I love vegetables.  The more the merrier.  I couldn't get my sauce to thicken up, but honestly I was okay with it just the way it was over rice.  My husband loved it too.

Very tender! Thank you for the recipe!   Did use worchester instead of soy sauce and took others ideas of adding 3 different colored peppers sliced about 45 minutes before dinner.

Terrific!  I made it as written, except I used steak meat, added a can of sliced mushrooms, and tripled the corn starship to make it more thick.  I will definitely be making this again.

I followed the recipe but cut the onions a little larger so they didn't disintegrate.  I would make it again but not put the green pepper in until a couple of hours before it's done because I like them crisp tender.  This is so delicious. / the seasonings are perfect.

I made a huge mistake in preparing this. I ended up pouring the beef and all the beef grease into the slow cooker pot at the beginning. It completely ruined the taste of the final meal.

This is a great recipe.  I made some substitutions to make it more paleo - used liquid aminos instead of soy sauce, omitted the sugar and lightened up the salt.  Try using tenderized round steak instead of sirloin - cut it across the grain into strips.  Serve over zucchini noodles instead of pasta or rice.  Deelish!

Really good!  I used 1/2 cup sodium-free chicken broth instead of the water and bouillion and diced instead of stewed tomatoes.  Turned out great.  Didn't find the peppers too mushy.  Served over egg noodles.  My husband and I finished the pot in one night.

This dish had more liquid than I'd anticipated, so it was more like a stew.  I was glad I followed the advice of other reviewers and added the peppers during the last hour.

Second time I made this, I served it over herbed mashed potatoes. This was a good pairing and took care of the soupiness.

Very good...the only thing I added was mushrooms. I just wish the sauce was a little thicker to cling better to the egg noodles so to serve and sprinkled a little Parmesan cheese.

This was pretty good.  I only had red pepper, so that is what I used.  Like others mentioned, added the pepper toward the end of cooking.  More of like a swiss steak to me, than a pepper steak, but it tasted good and my family all enjoyed it.

I thought I was just ok.  Nothing about it excited my mouth.  I waited on the peppers to give it crunch but otherwise it was very boring.

This is a great go to recipe.  My family is very picky and thought they may not like it.  They loved it and said it was a keeper.  So easy to fix with rice on a busy day.  I did cut the soy sauce in half so that it would not be too spicy.  I also used 1 each of the red, yellow and orange peppers to give color. Increased the sugar to 1 tablespoon to counteract the acid in the tomatoes.  All in all great flavor!

Very easy and tasty. Don't know why the photo shows red peppers while the recipe calls for green, but it was good either way. Followed others' advice and added the peppers toward the end of the cooking time. Worked very well.

I made this dish with "no salt added" tomatoes, and I used one red bell pepper and one green.  I omitted the salt, and used 1/2 c water for the bouillon, (because I like the juice).  I poured it over No Yolk egg noodles and it is out standing!!!  We will definitely have this again.

My family of 4 loved this meal! I did change a few things though based on other reviews. I omitted the salt & the peppers (since my fam doesn't care for them), added a couple cloves of fresh garlic, a couple splashes of Worcestershire & a little red pepper flakes for a kick. Oh & I didn't have stewed tomatoes on hand so I used diced tomatoes with green chilies instead. So, I guess I changed it quite a bit but it was perfect! This reminded me of a pot roast so I made it along with whipped garlic mashed potatoes, fresh green beans & a caesar salad! So good!

I have made this recipe several times and it is spectacular. Meat is fall apart tender, very flavorful, and excellent with rice or pasta. It is easy - I often make around noon on a Sunday and everyone comments about how great it smells all day. This recipe is a winner!

Delicious. I didn't have Beef Bouillon so I used Chicken stock.  Added the peppers, fresh garlic and Worcestershire in the last hour. Served it over Gnocchi and it was perfect.

deserves a 3.5 rating actually. the flavor is pretty good. the only thing that went wrong is during cooking time is the sauce that didn't thicken right.

Very easy to make and tasted great. I made this on top the stove and let simmer for about 3 hours. Added the peppers the last hour of cooking and everything turned out perfect.  Even better the next day.

Have you ever a recipe only to realize you should have read the instructions? Then you hurry through a million reviews to see if anyone else made this mistake? Yup that's me here. I jacked up from the beginning and guess what it WAS STILL AMAZING.. I threw EVERYTHING IN THE CROCKPOT ....oil included lol ... It was a total adhd moment.. I did add the peppers an hour before.. This smells amazing while its cooking.. Great over noodles or rice.. It is simple and delicious.. You could add anything really carrots or even peanuts.. Try it wont be disappointed.

This is a delicious recipe!  Like many before, I purchased beef cut for stir-fry and added the green pepper strips about 2 hours before the end of cooking.  I served it over mashed potatoes (after all, it's still winter).  A keeper for sure.

I doubled the sauce. (I have doubled the sauce on most recipes I found on AllRecipes. We like LOTS of sauce.) No need to double the salt, though, and used 5 TBSPs soy sauce. As suggested by other reviewers, I added the green peppers for the last 30 minutes to keep their texture. Served with steamed white rice. Thank you for a delicious recipe!

Very good! I tripled the sauce ingredients so that we'd have plenty for rice or egg noodles and added lots of minced garlic and some red pepper flakes. I did not brown the meat first and added onions and peppers during the last 45 mins or so of cooking (along with an additional TBS or so of cornstarch to further thicken). Very easy and tasty. Thanks!

I love this recipe and have made it multiple times. It's really more of a beef stew to me, but it is great nonetheless and you can definitely adjust the ingredients. I add lots of veggies and minced garlic and only use about a 1.5 lbs of steak.

Really good recipe. I didn't have time to make my "go to" recipe for pepper steak, but this was a good alternative.  Doubled the meat (large family), and tripled the sauce.  Added the peppers towards the end (per reviews)and added more onion (personal preference). I omitted the salt because the soy sauce is so salty! Only addition I made was to add ground ginger. I will add this to my list of slow cooker recipes!

This was an amazing dish! I did add a few cloves of garlic, red pepper flakes and doubled the sauce. Will definitely make it again. Thank you!

Yummy Recipe!!!!  This was so easy to make.  Followed recipe as is and it came out so good.  Entire family loved it, including a picky 12 year old.  I put pepper steak over a ribbon style pasta (similar to egg noodle) and they couldn't get enough.  Will definitely put this on my regular menu.

This recipe was easy and tasted even BETTER when re-heated the next day. I substituted the garlic powder for garlic salt to really add some zing and I added one red and one orange bell pepper.

This is fantastic. I read other reviews, made more sauce and added the peppers at the end. I'll double the batch next time. This is a keeper.

The flavor was decent (replaced garlic powder with chopped garlic, the bouillon cube/hot water with beef stock and omitted the extra salt as per several posters' suggestions) but not outstanding. The meat was tender but the peppers were soggy, as expected, despite my adding them to the top, away from the liquid, and cutting them thick.

I cooked it as directed except that I didn't brown the meat before putting it in the crock. Next time I will used diced tomatoes instead of stewed, it was a little too sweet. I thought it was good but my family just thought it was ok.

One of my families favorites for years now. Amazingly we use it more as a mexican dish. Like a steak ranchero meal with a bit less bell pepper and layer it in a tortilla with Spanish rice and beans.

I love peppers and steak but this didnt have as much flavor as i would have liked out of this.  I did add onion and garlic but i think im going to stick with my cast iron skillet for more flavor.

Flavor was good. A little salty. I'm confused as to why you pre cook the meat. Also, after cooking my meat dried up and shrunk to nothing as well as the sauce. Wasn't liquid enough. I don't see where anyone else had this problem!

This was pretty good for a weekday meal.  I used the recommended meat but next time use a cheaper cut?  I added the chopped peppers about 30 mins before serving and they were perfect.

What an awesome recipe! I usually add my own spin on recipes, but I followed the directions precisely for this one, and I am very happy with the results! For dinner, I placed a serving of pepper steak over rice and with a salad on the side for my husband. He ate and came back for seconds, but without the salad. He put a healthy serving of rice and pepper steak on his plate, and was delightfully satisfied when finished. I love it! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Very good. Will definitely make again. My husband loved it! I left out the beef bullion. Will add black pepper next time maybe. I used the pre-cut beef stir fry meat. I only used 1 green pepper. Next time I'll use 2 as the recipe says.  I also used Brown sugar instead of white and omitted the corn starch. Might use tapioca starch next time. Served over rice.

This recipe wasn't the best I've ever made. I'm a pretty plain eater and the steak had almost no flavor. I did cut the recipe in half because I wouldn't eat as much as the recipe made. Threw in an extra pepper because I love peppers and put in a whole can of diced tomatoes (instead of a half because the recipe was cut in half). It was quite watery (probably because I added more ingredients) but I think it would have been very watery instead. Not sure I would try this again.

Too salty - leave out the salt - put the vegetables in later they all were overcooked.  I would use the cheapest beef also.  I would make it again, but with these changes.  I used broth low sodium and not boullion too.

Great recipe!  I modified it slightly to add crushed red pepper and minced garlic for additional flavor.  Also used the low-sodium soy sauce so it wasn't overly salty.  I cooked it on high for 3.5 hours and added the peppers with about an hour remaining.  The peppers were soft, but not mushy, and the steak was very easy to pull apart, but not overly stringy.

I used thin sliced petite sirloin steak for this, and had it seasoned at the store with a garlic based steak type seasoning. I told the butcher what I was making and he recommended that. It reminded me of Montreal Steak Seasoning, but with a more garlic base to it. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and then once the meat was browned, drained it in a strainer. I left out the tomatoes, salt and soy sauce. I instead made more of the beef base, using Better Than Bullion for it, and then added a bit if Mrs. Dash garlic and herb seasoning. I then added mushrooms, celery and a bit of cilantro into it. Instead of just using green bell peppers, I used the green but added some red, yellow and orange peppers too. Once it was in the croc pot, I taste tested the sauce and added more sugar or Mrs. Dash as needed, and it has a great flavor, without being too salty. I served it over Jasmine rice and my family loved it!

Yum!!  The whole family loved this.  I was worried because I didn't have stewed tomatoes; I just left them out.  I used canned beef broth instead of bouillon and it worked great.  I served over white rice.  The kids even ate it up.  I cooked on high for 4 hours.

Easy recipe to throw together. So flavorful and tender. I omitted salt since the beef bouillon and soy sauce tend to make food salty and did not want to add more. It was the right decision. I also left out the canned tomatoes. Will make this again!

I made this recipe today and it is wonderful.  So full of flavor!  I added most of the peppers with only an hour left to cook and they were still very soft.  I served this over rice and my husband and I both are looking forward to leftovers tomorrow.  I will definitely prepare this recipe again.  Thank you.

The whole family liked this one.  A few minor changes:  I minced fresh garlic, used beef broth, left out the salt, and added pineapple.  Delicious!

Very Good! Only thing I did different was cook the peppers on the stove while making some rice. When I added them at the beginning they were too done. So I removed a little sauce from the crock pot and added it to the pan with a little water and cooked them for about five minutes. Awesome!

Followed the recipe exactly, except adding the peppers in the last hour.  
While both my husband and I found this to be edible, it will not be made again in our house.  This had no flavor to it at all.  We found it extremely bland and to be more like a swiss steak than pepper steak. Disapointed.

Just made this for dinner tonight and it was great. After reading some of the reviews I did wait until the end to add my peppers so they would not be mushy. I also added fresh garlic, ginger and shaoxing cooking wine. This is a keeper. Taste good and it was easy.

This recipe was good.  It was a nice "out of the norm" recipe for my family.  The 4 stars was because it wasn't something to write home about but merely good.

We really liked this recipe.  We really aren't real big fans of bell peppers but we sure ate this dish.  I used low salt soy sauce and it came out perfect.

This recipe was quite tasty but a bit more watery than what I would have liked it to be. Maybe adding cornstarch towards the end to help thicken the gravy would be helpful, but not too thick. I used petite sirloin (which contains little to no fat). I would recommend trying this recipe for a change on the menu every now and again.

This is the best recipe I have ever tried on all recipes!  It was outstanding!  Followed almost exactly using steak for fajitas, browned the meat as instructed and cooked in slow cooker for 4 hours on High adding the green peppers the last hour and a half.  Served over brown rice with a side salad. The sauce has a richness to it that was scrumptious and it was just the right thickness especially after it cooled down a bit. Perfect!

This recipe was very easy and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and cooked on high for 4 hours in my slow cooker.  I thought I messed it up because right when I put everything and got down to the last ingredient (the salt) I actually put in a tablespoon instead of a teaspoon.  I was so mad at myself and thought it would just spoil everything.  Well, I still cooked it and it turned out great!  We had it over white steamed rice and it was very tender and delicious.  My husband had seconds and he thought it was great.

This reminded me more of a beef stroganoff type dish but it was still really good.  I did add a little more soy sauce and waited to add the green peppers and onions until the last 30 minutes of cooking and just turned up my crockpot on high.  Oh and I added mushrooms too.  My husband and I also added a few dashes of chipotle hot sauce to our bowls and that added a nice kick.  Would of added it to all the sauce but my kids don't like spicy things.

Pretty good. The only changes I made was to use low sodium soy sauce and diced tomatoes, as I didn't have any stewed in the pantry. The flavor was good, not too salty, but my meat was a little chewy. Not sure why. Also added frozen pepper strips during last hour of cooking.
Served over brown rice. Will make this one again.

LOVED this! I also bought pre cut stir fry strips.  It was only a pound and a half so I used one bell pepper only.  I also used stewed tomatoes with jalapenos which gave it a little zing (it was still pretty mild).  I cooked on low for about 6 hours.  I added another tbsp of cornstarch disolved in water the last half hour to thicken it up a bit and also decided at that point I wanted some more veggies. So I microwaved a steam fresh bag of broccoli and threw it in.  Noone was home early enough to add the bell peppers and onion in a couple hours before so I added them in the beginning.  They were very soft. I would have preferred to throw them in later but it didn't take away from this great recipe. The beef was super tender and it was very tasty. I served it over quinoa.

I will start by saying I'm not a very good cook and stick to recipes. It was okay but did not have much flavor. I will try this recipe again, however, I will attempt to find other/better peppers with some spice to use and will proably add in more spices. This is easy to cook and has great potential.

This recipe is very flavorful and delicious! I added freshly ground pepper to along with the garlic powder to season the meat. Vegetable bouillon because that is what I had on hand, and one green pepper and one red pepper. Other than that I followed the directions and was very happy with the results. I will definitely make this one frequently!

I used Braggs Liquid Amino instead of soy sauce.  I also cut the peppers in strips.  I don't think it needed the salt, but it had a nice flavor despite being salty.

I loved the flavor of the recipe, but maybe I overcooked it because it came out more like a stew.  The meat was falling apart.  Served it over mashed potatoes.  I expected more sliced meat with gravy.  So I rated OK but may be totally a cook error.

Good. I doubled the amount stewed tomatoes and processed them because my kids do not like chunky tomatoes. I also doubled the bullion cube.  You do not need the salt and I would add some garlic the next time. Served it over rice.

Fantastic, just absolutely delicious! I was sure I would think the beef was delicious but not too certain about the peppers, oh was I wrong. The peppers, which I added after 2 hours (total 4 on low), were so tender and soaked up all of the juices. I used 2 green, 1 yellow, 1 orange, and 1 red pepper with sliced rump roast and served it with some brown rice. We will be making this again and again!

It tasted pretty good, but my meat turned to mush. I bought strips already cut for stir fry and a steak that I sliced up, both turned to mush in my crock pot, which was set on low.

Delicious recipe!  I did switch up part of the cooking method just a bit.  We were out for the day and I knew the peppers would be too soft if I had them go in with the meat.  We like them to be on the crisp side so, I prepared the meat and assembled everything but the peppers and onions and let that cook. (I also tossed in 2 whole Long hot peppers for some heat) The day before I made the bell peppers and onions with fresh garlic but made a lot more that called for because we like it heavy on the Veggie side. Sat that aside in the fridge. When we got home I added the veggies to the meat in the crock pot to heat through.  By the time the table was set the rice was cooked and it all came together quickly.  The veggies stayed crisp and the meat was tender.  Good recipe but we would like it with a little more sauce next time. Will make again.

Prepared exactly as per the recipe, except for not pre browning the beef, using low sodium soy sauce, and omitting the salt, as others suggested. I never knew food could be both salty AND bland! When it should have been done cooking, i tried to "doctor" it as others suggested, adding worschester sauce and more peppers after 5 hours of cooking on low (when the beef was not yet tender), adding some mirin (Japanese sweet sake for cooking) and none of that helped. Eventually I had to rescue the expensive almost all organic ingredients I almost wasted on this recipe by turning it into another dish, Filipino "mechado"...(added 4 small quartered potatoes, a few cloves smashed and chopped garlic, a packet of  Kaldereta mix that I had sitting in the cupboard, and a sprinkle of sugar to offset a bitter taste that I think came from the worschester)...the upside was that the meat was really tender after crock cooking it for almost 8 hours on low, making the mechado pretty tasty for using salvaged ingredients.

Husband loved this one and so did I.  Very easy, only change I made was I used tri tip as that is what I had.  Didn't add salt as it does not need any. Used beef flavor boost as I didn't have any beef bullion and put the peppers in the last hour of cooking otherwise they would be too mushy. Outstanding recipe.  Thanks.

Great recipe!  However, I did make a few changes:  1. I used 2lb  venison backstrap instead of beef, 2. I used 4 bell peppers instead of 2, 3. I added a handful of mushrooms cuz they had to go, 4. added fresh garlic, cayenne, and red pepper flakes cuz we like our food spicy!  Also, I made stovetop instead of in the crocpot becuz I was short of time.  Worked out fantastic!  Plus, the house smells soooo good while this is cooking!   Served it on hot buttered rice, yum!  Thank you MJWAGNER68!

Made this with just a few minor tweaks.  First I used Chuck steak, cause I like it better for crock pot recipes, secondly, I used !/2 of a red, yellow, orange and green peppers, and third, I omitted the salt, as the soy sauce is plenty salty enough.  We really enjoyed this served over white rice.  Will make again.

VERY good! I took another cook's advice and used fresh garlic (always a good idea!)My husband and children (ages 8, 6 & 6) loved this meat. I have some moose meat in the freezer, due to a happy hunter husband, and am going to try this recipe with it. The beef was so tender and I could cut it with a fork! I did also add a bit of Epicure's French Onion mix, which goes so well with anything beef!

I am not a huge steak fan but this recipe added so much flavor that I didn't even realize I was eating steak.  My husband loved the dish and I like that fact it was ready by the time I got home from work. Great over egg noodles..

I made this recipe but my husband and son thought it was too bland.  They said that it needed more "something".  I know I put plenty of garlic powder in it so maybe I need to add some more soy sauce or something.  They still said it was good.

This was good. I followed the recipe except I used low sodium soy sauce and added 3 bell peppers.  Honestly, I could have put in more peppers and I would have been a happy girl.  I will follow other reviewers advice and put the peppers in when there is about 2 hours left to have them be a little less soft.  This dish made a lot of "sauce".  With about 15 minutes remaining, I scooped up 1/3 cup of sauce and mixed a heaping tablespoon of cornstarch.  Wisked it smooth and returned it to the crockpot that I had increased to high.  This thickened it nicely.  We served the meal over egg noodles.  Thanks for sharing.

Cooked this on low for 7 hours, meat was wonderfully tender and delicious. Followed full recipe, only substituting the hot water and boullion with 1/4 cup beef broth. Like other reviewers noted, this is not traditional Chinese Pepper Steak. In fact, the stewed tomatoes gave it a bit if an Italian flare. Also, cooking the peppers for the entire cook time does turn them to mush (but I like them that way).

This is great as written, but I did make some modifications the second time. I used stew meat because that was what I had on hand, and a 12 oz bag of frozen Kroger brand 3 Pepper and Onion Blend, to eliminate the chopping because I was pressed for time. I also increased the water to 1/2 cup, used 2 bouillion cubes instead of one, and 2 Tbsp of cornstarch all because I wanted it to make more gravy than the last time. Very good either way! My family enjoyed this both times, both as written and with the modifications.

My husband and I liked this recipe. I was glad that I read the reviews and did not add the salt, and I didn't add the green peppers until three hours before it was finished on low. Next time I would add them two hours before, because I thought they were still a little too soft for me.

We love this recipe.  The following are the changes I've made due to my family's preferences and time. I don't brown the meat, just slice it up and throw it in the crock pot so I eliminate the oil.I slice a whole onion instead of chopping.  I double the sauce and use low sodium soy sauce or braggs. I also double the tomatoes- 2 cans. I don't add any additional salt.  I use 3-4 cloves of fresh garlic minced and double the peppers or put in 5 or 6. (We love peppers.  I usually take just a little meat and fill my plate with peppers.) I add the peppers in the last hour of cooking.  I've tried it over rice and egg noodles and our favorite is egg noodles. This also freezes pretty well.  I send meals to my daughter in college and she loves this.

We love this meal!  I use diced tomatoes, and omit the tsp of salt.....the soy sauce has enough salt for our taste.
I add the peppers during the last hour so they don't get mushy.    Great crock pot recipe!

I used top round steak because it's what I had.  I seasoned it with salt, pepper, garlic powder and a little ground ginger before browning.  I added minced garlic to the crockpot.  Didn't have beef bouillon so I used Gravy Master instead. Substituted red and orange peppers (personal preference) and brown sugar for the white.  I also omitted the extra salt and used low sodium soy sauce.  Added the peppers in the last hour as suggested.  They would have turned to mush otherwise.  Cooks thoroughly on low in 6-7 hours. Meat was fork tender.  Served over brown rice.  Everyone liked it!  Leftovers make a yummy pita sandwich too.

This was delicious!! Only subtle changes I made was using beef broth instead of water and bouillon and added a couple of dashes of dried oregano and parsley. I also omitted the onions because I regrettably was out and didn't realize. The onions would have made it, so don't forget them like I did!! I followed the advice of others and added the peppers one hour before eating. Served over rice and this is just great!!

I made this up yesterday. I doubled up recipe. And my husband took it to work today in crockpot and heated it up for lunch for 6 guys. I got club rolls for quick sandwiches. Let's just say there was nothing left.The guys like hot food on a cold day for construction workers. I used a London broil instead of beef sirloin. Cost less.

Made this last night! Wonderful! I cooked my steak a little longer, left out the bouillion (because of salt content) and added bell pepper and onion in later after meat was tender but otherwise followed recipe.  Maybe my cut of steak was just tougher?  I love slow cooker or slow cook recipies!   
We put ours over egg noodles since I'm not a rice fan. This is comfort food!

This is a fantastic recipe! This is a regular in our house and I often take it to people after a new baby or illness.  Served over rice-- can't be beat! Thanks so much for the recipe! P.S. I wait until about halfway through the cooking before I add the peppers, keeps them from getting too mushy.

I tried this yesterday. The house smelled awesome while it was cooking. I doubled the sauce ingredients as others had suggested and added minced garlic instead of the powder,added more onion and left out the salt. My family loved this and I will be making this again.

I made this recipe with flank steak instead of sirloin, but otherwise followed the directions exactly. My husband and I both LOVED it!

Entire family Loved it and will make again! Mixed family half over rice and other half over mashed potatoes. This is very tasty and don't usually change recipes but I did purchase stir fry beef strips to save more time. Very easy and delicious what more can you ask for?

Oh my gosh, this was a little bit of Heaven in my mouth.  I made it for my mother-in-law, grandma-in-law, grandparents, parents, and brother and they've ALL asked for the recipe.  When I made this for my husband, he ate thirds!  I'm going to double the recipe next time. Amazing!

I make this all the time!  The only thing I do differently is I add a little bit of ground ginger to it, use one red bell pepper and one green bell pepper,  and I omit the salt.  Soy sauce is salty enough.  Really great.  Sometimes I serve it over rice and sometimes I serve it over egg noodles.  One of my go to crock pot recipes.

one of my husbands favorite meals is beef and Tomato with fried rice. I made this (without thinking that this would be like the chinese dish at all) and he said it is the best beef and Tomato he has ever had. Delicious!

This was incredibly easy to make and incredibly tasty too!  I doubled the amount of sauce and my family still wanted more more more.  Next time I will triple the sauce.  Followed someone else's tip to use pre cut  meat and added an extra red pepper for color. Terrific meal!

Loved this soooo much! One of my favorite recipes I have found here. Cut the peppers into strips and definitely don't add until the last 15 or so minutes of cooking unless you want soggy peppers. Delicious!

We enjoyed the flavor of this dish a lot.  Followed the recipe accordingly, however only had spicy canned tomatoes which actually gave the dish and extra kick.  Also added some red peppers for color along with the green pepper.  Turned out fantastic!

I made this the day before it was needed and it turned out wonderful.  I too added additional tomatoes for added sauce and served it over rice.  It was a hit and will be making it more.

This was definitely delicious!  Followed it to the tee, only taking Chef Eeyore's suggestion of adding just a tad more starch (I only added an additional tsp), but it was perfect even without!  The hubby immediately declared it his favorite dish ever upon trying it. Will definitely use this again!

I wish I read the reviews before I tried to cook this recipe.  My bell pepper turned out mushy because I added it from start of cooking time.Nonetheless, my kids and I loved it.  Thanks for the recipe.  I would definitely cook this again.  The bell pepper would definitely go in after two hours.:)

It has great flavor but I didn't care for the peppers being so mushy from cooking so long.  Next time I will put some in to add to the flavor of the meat but put the rest in towards the end so they stay a little firm.

Not sure it was a flaw in the recipe so much as it just wasn't to my taste. The flavours just didn't combine very well to me and I found it was too salty. The peppers would have been better had they been added  little later in the cooking process because they seemed to get a bit mushy.

I made this last evening for my family.  I'm always a little skeptical of round steak because I've been disappointed with how tough it can be even when it's cooked. In this recipe, it was so tender!  I doubled everything in the recipe except for the salt, which I kept at 1 tsp. Everyone loved it!

I go back to this recipe again and again. It's so easy and everyone in the house loves it, even the Chinese take out fanatic. The only thing I change is that I use one green and one red pepper for some added sweetness. The slow cooker time can be adjusted according to how soft you like the meat, but this holds well on the warm setting. Love it!

Yum, this was so delicious. Loved it. It's definitely a keeper. The only change I made was to add chicken broth instead of beef broth since I was out of beef broth.

This turned out really good.  Very easy to make as well. I sliced up a couple large top sirloin steaks.  I browned them in the oil with about a tbsp of minced garlic, fresh minced ginger and a pinch of red pepper flakes.  I added the browned meat, half a yellow onion cut into strips to the crock pot with the stewed tomatoes and a double batch of the sauce (water, bullion, soy sauce, cornstarch and sugar).  I did omit the salt after reading previous reviews.  After two hours on high I added one sliced up red and one green bell pepper.  Cooked for two more hours on high.  Served it over white rice.  It was good.  The only thing was that it was a little salty.  I probably should have used low sodium soy sauce.  My husband really liked it and said how tender the meat was.  We ate it two nights in a row.  I will make it again.

Love this meal!  This is one that turns out so well, we bring it out for company as well.  It's certainly not a budget meal, as Sirloin steak can be expensive.  But it tastes great.  I usually buy both green and red peppers, and I don't put in the peppers until 2 hours before it's done (if on low.)  A 5 star meal!

I did as some of the others suggested and added the bell pepper strips the last half hour.  This was delicious and will definitely be made again in this house!

so good!!!  I add the peppers 1 1/2 hours before it's done so they are not mushy.  This is a family favorite in our house

I used about 3 lbs. of round steak and even the teenager ate it (after picking out the peppers, onions and tomatoes, which were delicious).  I cooked it during a day when i could turn the crock pot off after about 6 or 7 hours.

Oh my this is good. I used venison instead of beef but followed the recipe exactly. The meat was falling apart tender. Served this over rice. The sauce came out thin for me but very tasty. Next time I will thicken it.

Pretty tasty, I'll make this again! Next time I'll probably add fresh garlic rather than using garlic powder, cut back a little on the salt and sugar, and add baby carrots! I used vegetable bouillion instead of beef since that's what I had on hand, and didn't put in the bell peppers until the last hour. I cooked it on high for about 4 1/2 hours, it turned out great! Thanks for a delicious recipe!

This was an awesome meal, I altered it a bit and added an extra tablespoon and a half of cornstarch added to 1/3 cup of water.  It's also important to make sure that your water is boiling when adding the bouillon cube, otherwise it wont dissolve very well. The sauce turned out very good and thick with the extra cornstarch.  The meat was tender and served over rice, this is definitely a money maker.

This is absolutely perfect! I doubled the recipe (all ingredients), added an extra 14.5 oz. can of stewed tomatoes, slow-cooked it on low for six hours, and served it over fluffy rice. Definitely a family pleaser!

Easy to make and tastes great! I did as suggested and waited until the last hour of cooking to put in the peppers so they didn't get as soft.

I never bother browning the meat before putting it into the crockpot.  I did add 2 cans of sliced mushrooms.  Cooked on high for 4 hrs and did use pre-cut fajita meat which made it easier and much faster. Hubby gave it a 4.5 so that's a keeper. Thanks for the recipe.

Absolutely fantastic.  I have made this several times.  My husband loves it.  I leave the onion & peppers in slices.  I always cook on low and don't add the onion & peppers until the last two hours.  I serve over egg noodles.

Fixed this for dinner tonight and it was excellent!  The only difference in preparation was I used red peppers instead of green peppers (personal preference).  From now on, this is the only pepper steak recipe I will use.

This is very good served over white rice.  Peppers do get a little mushy if you add them at the beginning.  I will wait next time and add the peppers about 1/2 way through cooking time.  Excellent flavor.

Great recipe!  I did substitute one can of beef broth for the bouillon and water and flour for the cornstarch.  Made the recipe easier.  I also put in some Worcestershire sauce.

This was good! I had to use BEEF BASE instead of bullion because I didnt have any. I didnt add any salt because Soy sauce has alot and Im not to big on salt. I served this over white rice, it was delish. I also use a top round roast steak and just cut it up. I waited to add the onions and peppers til the last 2 hours because I like my veggies crunchy. Will make again!!

Just made this and it was great. I did not add the extra salt as several mentioned it was salty enough. It tasted fantastic. Next time I will add carrots and celery too as one reviewer mentioned. My family and I loved this dish!

Followed the recipe with the exception of adding the peppers the last hour of cooking and added a few crushed red pepper flakes.  The flavor was great, the peppers were not over done and the meat was very tenders.  Definitely will make again

Honestly, just ok. Basically this is a beef stew, not radically different from any other slow cooker beef stew dish. The taste was fine, but not  memorable and nothing we'd make again.

Recipe was simple & the family ate it, but it lacked something.  I took the tips to use red as well as green peppers, adding them late, as well as some red pepper flakes, but it still tasted similar to a stew and  nothing special.  Will probably make it again experimenting w/various seasonings.

This is my go-to slow cooker recipe. It's always delicious, and every time I make it for company, I'm asked for the recipe. I omit the bouillon because when I'm browning the meat it produces plenty of flavorful liquid, which I just pour into the crock pot, and the teaspoon of salt provides enough saltiness. Sometimes I add a chopped red pepper for a little variety and extra veggies. It's great over brown rice. A real keeper.

This dish is delicious!  The only thing I changed was instead of two green peppers I used one red and one green, and instead of soy sauce I used Worchetire sauce (because that's what I had on hand).  Definitely a keeper recipe!

Made a few changes, used flat iron steak because thats what I had on hand. Added fresh garlic, and added more onion. Really good, father in law said this must go on the "make again" list.

Really good! The meat was tender and the sauce was very flavorful. (I didn't add any sugar) I served it over rice and my bf and I both loved it.

I don't know what I did wrong but when I added the cornstarch to the water, beef cube mixture it became really clumpy. I ended up just pouring beef broth over meat. I also think it would have been better without the stewed tomatoes. I agree with others that you should wait and add the vegetable closer to the end so they don't turn mushy. I will look for another pepper steak recipe.

This is fairly good. I think I cooked it too long as the meat fell apart when stirred. I added the peppers the last hour of cooking time. We'll eat the leftovers but I doubt I'll be making this again. My family prefers the pan fried recipe. Thank you.

My family really enjoyed this recipe. Like the others, I used pre-sliced beef for stir fry just to speed things up. One green and one red pepper added the last hour was just perfect for our taste. I did hold off on the salt but found it did need a little something so I added about ½ teaspoon before serving. I served this with rice and look forward to making it again.

It was good! My better half liked it, but didn't love it. Better the next day. The sauce came out more watery than I had anticipated, but thickened up after it was refrigerated. Used Bisto (beef) instead of cornstarch and added the green peppers in the last hour as per other reviews... they came out perfect.  Any leftovers were gone after a day or so, therefore I consider this recipe a success.

I am not a beef eater typically & I love this dish. Only modifications I make are to add minced garlic, a few dashes of worchestershire, and about half way through cooking time, I add an additional T of cornstarch into 1/4 cup of the hot cooking liquid & add it back in to thicken up the sauce a little. This is great over egg noodles.

Made this and it turned out great! I did double the sauce part but only added 4 TBSP of soy sauce and no salt. (personal choice). I added the peppers when I got home and my hubby loved it! Thanks for the great recipe!

I used red and orange bell peppers, chopped up a couple of roma tomatoes in place of stewed tomatoes, and left out the cornstarch, and the recipe still came out amazing. My whole family loved it.

Great recipe. I made it this past weekend and went exactly by the recipe...my husband loved it. He finished it off lastnight and already said I need to make this again. I might try using rotel diced tomatoes and green chilies the next time instead of just stewed tomatoes. We ate it rolled in flour tortiallas and it tastes alot like the carne gusada we eat here in Texas.

This was a very nice recipe. The only thing I did different was I coated the meat with the Flour and Garlic Powder then browned it. I also added a can of drained and rinsed Black Beans...this made it very filling. The only thing I would change is it needed a little more salt and seasoning, other then that it was very nice : )

This was awesome. Made a few tweaks, though. We don't use canned food in our house (because the cans are lined with bisephenol-A) so I used 3 large tomatoes and about 1/2 cup of red wine. Unbelievable. I wish I had made twice as much at least.

We loved it. I also did not add the peppers until 1 hour before eating. Next time I will omit the salt as salt and soy sauce was to much.

I gave the recipe 5 stars because my whole family loved it! Including myself, who although I am not a lover of beef (because it always seems to tough) I enjoyed it. I took advice of the other reviews and added bell peppers the last hour and it turned out well. I also added a little red pepper, not to much just to give it a kick. But otherwise I did what the recipe called for. I will definitely cook this again.

This was excellent.  I don't normally like to use the cubed steak from the grocery store because it can be a bit tough (even though it makes life so much easier!) but cooking it in the crock pot like this made it so tender.  We're trying to cut back on the amount of red meat we eat, so I only used 1 lb beef and doubled the # of peppers and used a whole onion.  Can't wait to make this again!

Excellent recipe.  Also done on the stove top, can braise the beef for as long as you need, then add the peppers for last 20 mins or so.

SO good! Definately will use again... I made a few changes... I used 2 thick sirlion steaks, I used chicken broth instead of beef  boullion cubes (abo=ut 2 cups), I used Olive Oil instead of Veg. Oil, I added a can of mushrooms because I LOVE mushrooms and I used whole wheat flour because I don't use cornstarch. Delicious!

Excellent.  If you don't have green peppers, 0.5-1 tablespoon of red pepper flakes makes a different but great flavor as well

This is basically a recipe for Chinese Beef Tomato. I gave it 4 stars because I really liked it. It turned out great and I love finding new slow cooker recipes. My husband didn't like it because he doesn't like Beef Tomato. I used 1 Tbsp Olive oil instead of 3 Tbsp Veg oil. It would have been better with a spray of Pam.

I sliced up a 2 pound roast for this recipe and it turned out great.  The next day I reduced the broth for about 3 hours and added 2 tblsp cornstarch it made a thick gravy,  and served it over egg noodles.  It was delicious.

Perfect for new, novice cooks. If I can do this, anyone can. I followed the recipe and looked at some of people's notes. I fell adventurous and added some Goya Sazon, a sprinkle of Adobo and just a pinch of italian seasoning. Served with green beans and Uncle Ben's wild rice, cooked with 1/2 chicken broth instead of water. I ended up getting a standing ovation from my wife and daughter. Delicious.

The meat was so tender after cooking it all day that it literally just fell apart. It was delicious. I put the peppers in about 2 hours before serving, so they were soft but not mushy. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars was the sauce had a little too much tomato taste with it. But I would make it again, my husband and I loved it, and ate it over the next few days with pasta, rice, and on bread.

Was pretty good. I added the peppers for the last hour as others suggested. I bought a 2.12 Sirloin steak and sliced it how I wanted it. It was very tender after cooked. I did not add the salt but I did add a couple more shakes of soy sauce. Flavor was good, kids even ate it which was a plus. I think next time I will put the stewed tomatoes in a food processor to get the chunks out. A lot of non tomato eaters in this house and it would be easier to disguise them.

This recipe was great! The sauce ended up a little on the thin side for my taste, we tried it over brown rice which was good, and then tried it in a french roll sort of like "italian beef" sandwich style with provolone cheese on top which was actually tastier, this dish also does well re-heated after being refrigerated.

Yummy.  I added some chili flakes for some zip and it worked nicely.  I also waited to add the peppers which I am thankful I did.  The meat was super tender and the sauce was delicious.

I followed this recipe exactly, and it was delish! On my way home from work, I bought a quart of white rice from the chinese take out restaurant to put the peppered steak over.  My husband usually mocks me when I make a slow cooker dish because they usually have no flavor.  But he said I redeemed myself with this dish. I prepared and put everything in the crock the night before. In the morning I just threw it in the crockpot and let it cook on low the whole day until I got home from work. This one is keeper!

I cooked just as directed only added the peppers at last and omited the salt. We thought this was really tasty. I put this over rice and it was more like a stew (I added the juice with the meat on top of the rice). I will make this again because the ease of this can't be beat and it's good. :-)

This was my first time making pepper steak and it was very tasty. The only thing I did differently was I left out 1 teaspoon salt and added the pepper the last hour of cooking since I like some crunch to it. Other than that it came out perfect.

My husband loved this and it was very easy.  I used chopped garlic instead of garlic powder and red peppers in place of the green and served it over mashed potatoes.  Will definitely make again.

This was so incredibly yummy!  I added the peppers at the beginning like the recipe says because I like mine very well done.  I did add more cornstarch at the end like others suggested because I like the gravy to be a little thicker.  My whole family loved this, even my picky 6 year old.  He ate every. single. bite.  No joke!  I made a pot of white rice to serve it with, and we all agreed this is a keeper.  Will make time and time again.  Thanks MJWAGNER68 for such a delicious and easy recipe!

My family is picky ... and they LOVED this!  i am a vegetarian however, I cook meat for them,, I do have to say the smell of this in my house was yummy!!! I listened to the other reviewers and added my green peepers in the last hour.... I also did not have any cornstarch so I used instant mashed potatoes and they did the trick, I added 4 small whole onions...perfect!

This was very good and easy!  I did not need to use the oil to brown the meat, which I browned very lightly.  This dish was actually ready in 4 hours on the slow setting.  I mixed the meat with lots of fresh garlic and some kosher salt before browning.  I used a variety of peppers, including some hot banana peppers, added them later, and actually just kept them on top of the meat until right before serving.  I also used Italian stewed tomatoes and served over egg noodles.  Great flavor.  My family says it's a keeper; success!

DELICIOUS!!! So good that I want to make it again tomorrow. I did follow some of the reviews in that I didn't put the peppers in until later. I can't wait to make it again.  YUM!

This is awesome and I followed the recipe exactly and it was the best Pepper Steak. There were no leftovers at all. My family scraped the bottom of the crockpot. I served it over Jasmine Rice. PERFECTION

Prepared recipe, but with the following substitutions: 1 c. rather than 1/4 c. hot water, 5 tbsp. rather than 2 tbsp. soy sauce, 1 can of diced rather than stewed tomatoes, with juice and omitted the salt. Also, I added the sweet peppers for the last 1 hour of cooking.  Neither my husband nor I thought that the tomatoes added anything to this dish. Would prepare again, but I will omit the tomatoes.

LOVE pepper steak and the best way to make it is in the slow cooker. I left out the beef bouillon and the cornstarch because I like mine kind of runny. I used a can of diced tomatoes because I prefer those over the stewed. YUMMY. Perfect served over white rice.

I added extra vegetables... celery and carrots just because I they are so good when cooked with the onions and peppers... I would like this even without the steak!  It's a really  tasty and healthy meal.  The left overs taste great as well after the flavors have had a chance to mingle... Excellent!! A really good five star meal!

Thank you MJWAGNER68!  This recipe was DELICIOUS!  I was worried that my children would not like it b/c of the cooked peppers (not a favorite)  But they both ate everything on their plate!  It was a big hit!  Thanks again!

I think this lacked flavor. I doubled the sauce recipe and added red pepper flakes or some heat but still didn't do much.  I only cooked it on high for 2 hours and the meat still turned out really dry-I should not have browned it first, perhaps.  Won't make this again.

Absolutely Fabulous! I served it over plain rice. It was very very flavourful and tasted even better when it was reheated the next day. I did change the recipe slightly. Instead of regular salt I used one teaspoon kosher salt . Also instead of one teaspoon of white sugar I used 3 teaspoons of demerara brown sugar.

Wonderful.  I did double the sauce and mixed soy sauce and Worchestire sauce fifty fifty.  I took out the additional salt that the recipe said to add and it was perfect as far saltiness.  I also added the vegetables an hour before serving and it came out nicely...not too soggy and mushy. I took it to a huge gathering and everyone raved about it and it was all gone.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This was wonderful.  I used thin sliced bottom round steak and browned it in oil with minced onion, seasoned salt and garlic powder.  I served it over white rice.  I will definitely make this again.

Fantastic! Cooked for 5 hours on low then added green peppers for the last hour. The meat was perfectly tender and peppers still had a crunch to them. Will make again for sure!

Good but a bit salty for my taste, however that is easy to correct (low sodium soy salt).  I will make this again and again.  Served with brown rice and egg rolls.

Everyone loves this recipe, and I now have to triple it just to have some leftovers.  Those leftovers don't usually mke it past 1 day.  I don't put the peppers in until the last hour or so.  My sons and hubbie demand this about once a month or so.  It's easy, fast and excellent to put in the crock for dinner in the a.m. on low.  Can't get much easier than that.  Thanks

this is so easy and very good.  I use Target's frozen fire roasted peppers to it and it's delicious.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated except for adding the peppers in the final hour.  This was so easy and it turned out great!  We served it over brown rice.  It tasted great the next day as leftovers too!

It looks super grose, sorta like barf.  But Alicia(my 25'year-old stepmom)made me try it.  And so when I tried it I didden't like the beef, and so I ate the rice & juce insted.  But I loved it!

Made this last night and was very pleased. Meat came out very tender and delicious.  Did as others stated and added the peppers half way through cooking.  Will definitely be making this again.

This was a great recipe for a large group of people. I always add more garlic than recipes call for so I did once more.  I made the mistake of adding a bit too much canned tomatoes so I would not do that again! Overall really delicious!

Good recipe but just not for us. We didn't think it was anything amazing - it all got eaten but without much enthusiasm.  But again, that was just our opinio.

This was soo good, pretty easy to make. I just hate chopping everything. My boyfriend loved it, he kept going on about how good it was. Not your typical Chinese pepper steak though.

Tasty, but WAY overcooked after returning home from work, and since I use the crock pot for work days, I probably wouldn't make this again.  I also think the tsp. salt should be left out.

With my husband being a hunter, I have to find yummy ways to cook venison. I season it up and follow this recipe. I put the peppers in for the last two hours of cooking. This is my husbands new fav! My mom and in-laws love it too! Big hit!

My son took a bite and looked up with a smile on his face and said "This is REALLY good! How'd you make the sauce?" I actually used half the amount of meat and doubled the other ingredients (except for the green peppers) because I preferred to eat it without the meat. It made a lot of extra sauce to pour over the whole grain brown rice I used.  My husband and son ate it with the meat and I ate it with red beans which I liked very much.  I will make this regularly! So easy and tasty!!

I make this all the time in my family. I do not add any sugar or salt as it is not needed. I add two cubes of beef bouillon and two tablespoons of corn starch with 1/2 cup water to make more of the sauce. I also use petite diced tomatoes instead of stewed.

This was really good and I am not one to rate things when I change the recipe.... but I did change some things.  I wanted this to be a little more asian flavored so I used about a cup or so of apple juice for the liquid and about a 1/2 - 3/4 tsp of ground ginger.  It turned out great.

Simple & tasty!  You can't go wrong with this one.   The meat comes out incredibly tender.  I used frozen pepper strips/onions and they worked just fine.  This will be a recipe I make often.

This recipe is delicious. Due to my own tastes, I do not include the can of stewed tomatoes, but add almost a cup of water and a little extra soy sauce. It turns out perfect. This is quite possibly one of my favorite dishes.

Yummy!  This was really good.  We added red and yellow peppers to brighten the dish and added about 1 tsp. of ginger.  We served it with rice.  My kids enjoyed it so much they wanted to take it to school for lunch the next day! Do Not Add fresh ginger it gave it a weird taste.

Everyone loved this.  I did thicken the sauce with some cornstarch.  I also cut the peppers into strips and did put them in at the beginning.  We like them soft.

This was very good and easy to make. I took advice from other reviews and waited until the last hour to add the peppers. I also took a tablespoon of cornstarch, mixed with cold water and added it to the crockpot 15 mins before serving.

This recipe is easy and is always a hit.  I usually double the beef (buying a roast and cutting it up myself) and I add ginger into the mix.  We serve it over rice or noodles and make it often.  Very good and the leftovers are wonderful for lunch at work.

This was spectacular. The meat comes out so tender, and the soy sauce adds a little tang to complete the wonderful sauce. So delicious!

Sorry..this recipes did nothing for us. The only part of the recipe I changed was I added 1 fresh plum tomato and a small can of tomato sauce since I did not have stewed tomatos.  The flavor was bland...It wasn't bad..just nothing to it.

I found this recipe to be great.  I increased the corn starch for a thicker gravy.   It seemed to get better and better when reheated.  I made fresh rice for the second and third measl.  Would make this again and again! Make on the weekend and reheat during the week.

Very yummy. I added about 1/4 cup of Sriracha sauce, and a pinch of cayenne pepper to spice it up even more. Also I followed other reviews and omitted the extra tsp of salt and added cornstarch toward the end. Will probably make again.

I'm going to try this one again. I've learned my slow cooker cooks foods MUCH faster than most, so the meat was very chewy. Perhaps shorter cooking time will give me more tender meat. Left overs were still good though.

This is a delicious recipe but I think the cooking time is too long.  In order to still have a bit of a crunch to the green bell peppers don't add them until the last 1 - 1 1/2 hours.  We also added broccoli in the last 30 minutes because we love that combination of flavors.

It tasted more like a stew, I was hoping to make Pepper Steak, like at the Chinese Restaurant. I had to take a double take when I saw HOW much sodium,soy sauce, beef boulion and still add salt... Tasted more like beef stew from a can. I will have to do something to make it less soupy and less SALTY.

This was VERY tasty and very easy to make.  I followed others' advice by thickening the sauce and adding the green peppers for the last hour and used real garlic instead of powder.  Also omitted the sugar and salt.  Cooked about  7 hrs on low and served over egg noodles.  My hubby was very satisified with this new recipe adventure of mine!  Will definately make again.

i've been using my slow cooker for about a month. everything seems to turn out very tasty. I followed this recepie pretty much. i cooked the onion and beef in oil to brown it about 10 minutes, and used onion gravy packet with cornstarch instead of the boullion. it turned out really well, it was a bit salty, so if you want to cut that down, maybe next time i would omit the teaspoon of salt, & do 21/2 soy sauce. but everyone loved it. so i will definatly use this again. great flavor- tasted just like moms.

I made this a few nights ago for my husband and I.. It was really good. My husband liked it so much, we didn't have -any- left overs. I agree with the poster who said to wait to add the green peppers to the end, they are much better slightly crisp, and cook VERY fast once you do add them.

I really enjoyed this. But my husband thought it was bland. I thought it was a healthy alternative in comparison to others that I've tried that is mostly a gravy. I liked this alot...because of the mix of flavors, Also please note, this dish is even better the second day after a night marinating in the fridge!!!

EASY, delicious, and everyone loved it - the three things I need to make sure I make something again, and will definitely make again.  Just threw ingredients into crock pot bowl before bed and stuck in the fridge, then took it out & turned onto Low for 8 hours and voila! Served over mix of brown & white rice and everyone's asking for it to be a mainstay.  Healthy & awesome - thanks!

I guess I was hoping this would taste like pepper steak from the Chinese take out.  It doesn't.  It smells funny (to me).  Ugh, will not be making again.

I tried this recipe last nite and it was a great hit with my husband and I! I added about 1/4 tsp of sesame oil and didn't use salt b/c the soy sauce and sesame oil have salt in it! It was so tender and juicy! I also added the bellpeppers at the last 30 min of cooking! Great recipe!

This recipe was wonderful! I did not change a thing from the original instructions. I used some steak that we had that was very tough when cooked on the grill, it turned out so tender! Will definately use this again, and my mom has requested it as well.

Wonderful recipe! Thanks for sharing. I too waited until about 1-2 hours before serving to add the bell peppers. I used one green and one red for color. I also ended up adding about 2 tablespoons more of constarch 30 minutes before it was done and it thickened up the sauce nicely. We served over egg noodles. My husband and children enjoyed the dish as well. Keeping this one!

Delicious recipe!  Made as per stated except, I added the peppers later in cook time.  I  used a cheaper cut of meat and it still was great.  Would make again.

It had a delicious taste to it, but the gravy wasn't as thick as I would of liked it to be. But I also did cook it on high for about 4hrs instead of cooking it on low for longer, maybe that had something to do with the consistency of the gravy? I seperated the liquid and made it thicker on the stove top after it was done cooking.

Very tasty, I followed others directions and put the peppers in for the last hour. I also addded mushrooms, and served over rice. I served the leftovers over mashed potatoes which was much better.

This is a keeper.  I did double the sauce.  I used beef broth instead of bouillon and left out the extra salt.  I put the green peppers in for the last hour of cooking and used stew beef.  I've also made it with crushed tomatoes when I didn't have stewed and it worked great for our families tastes.

This is ok, but definitely not something I craved.  In fact, I eventually threw out the leftovers since it didn't excite me.  It is too watery and lacks richness.

Very tasty and easy to make.  Even my husband, who hates cooked bell peppers, raved about it.  As suggested by others, be sure to hold off on adding the peppers until the last 30 min to 1 hour of cooking to avoid mushy peppers.

This was the first dinner I cooked in my new slow cooker.  I'm not a fan of throwing in soup and ketchup, so this sounded appealing to me.  It was really tasty and my family liked it - even my 2 year old!  I used beef broth instead of water and bullion.  I got cut up stir fry meat from the market and I used frozen pepper and onion mix.  It was easy and delicious.  Will make it again!

Great recipe!  Instead of putting the steak in the slow cooker, I grill it and then place strips on top of the bed of rice and pepper sauce.

Great recipe. It's a DEFINITE keeper... even my son who's not crazy about peppers cleaned his plate.  I did sprinkle the meat with steak seasoning and then sauteed it with fresh garlic.  I also added a swig of worcestershire to the sauce.  As per other reviewers I had to add a little extra cornstarch at the end to get the sauce thick enough to my liking.  I cooked everything on low for six hours and did not find my peppers too mushy. They were soft, but we like them that way :)

This was good, but I don't think it needs to be put in a slow cooker. And if it is it doesn't need to cook for so long. Maybe 4 hours on low. That's what it took mine. Add the peppers at the very end, like others have said. I served them over mashed potaotes, yummy. Also, I had to add extra cornstarch, the broth was to thin, for my taste. The flavors were good, just need some adjustments.

Loved this! I doubled the sauce (tomatoes and beef bouilion mixture) and also added extra cornstarch for a thicker gravy. Everyone loved it.  It is great with mashed potatoes!

My husband LOVED it!!! But I thought it was way too salty. I added wortechire sauce and served it over garlic and herb rice. I don't think I will add the salt next time.

It is out of this world, the only thing i would put the peppers in the last half hour of cooking, so there would be some kind of crunch.

Changes I made: I subbed cornstarch with flour, minced garlic for garlic powder, and subbed mild rotel for canned tomatoes. Bought the stir-fry steak at the store and sliced the meat up a bit more. Boyfriend LOVED this dish. Coworkers asked for the recipe! Will DEFINITELY make this again!
[Update - I didn't brown the meat in a skillet but instead added the raw meat, with olive oil, and some onion to the crock pot and cooked on High for about 2.5 hours. Then added the rest of the ingredients (minus the peppers -- added those an hour before serving). I cooked on high for about 4.5 hours total. Used  1/2 cup of 99% fat free beef broth (instead of water and bouillon) and served over egg noodles (which have less carbs than white rice or brown rice). We LOVE this recipe!!]

I used my electric pressure cooker for this recipe and it came out awesome.  I cooked the vegetables separate so they would keep their crunch & I also added mushrooms. I did double the liquid.  Served over rice.  The whole family loved it.  Can't wait to make again.

My family enjoyed this dish.  I liked it, but prefer my green peppers with more crunch.  Next time I make it I might add the peppers later.  I didn't brown the meat.  I just threw it in the crock pot and seasoned it with the garlic powder.

This recipe was fantastic, wonderful combination of flavors, tender, melt in your mouth steak. The only thing I did differently was that I used fresh garlic cloves when browning the steak and I added a red bell pepper along with the green bell pepper as we tend to love our peppers here.  :)  I will definitely make this one again.

This was great! I prepared everything the day before, and once I was ready to leave for work, I pulled the pot of goodies out of the fridge and cooked it on low for 14 hours. I then served this over minute rice (3 cups dry was the perfect amount). Between my fiance and I, we almost at it all!

This is a hit in my house hold. I use a little extra garlic for flavor. If you feel like you want to thinken it up and add a little more seasoning, double the cornstarch and the beef cube. I have also adder red bell pepper for color and flavor. Good recipe.

This was good, but I actually like regular pepper steak better. I didn't do the recipe as directed because I didn't have some of the ingredients....which could have been the reason it wasn't my favorite. I didn't like the soy sauce in it even though I love it on the regular kind...it was too salty and the meat actually was too tender if that's possible!

My husband and I both really liked this recipe. I was a little skeptical at first because the ingredients list doesn't seem that appealing, but it was great!! The only changes I made was fresh garlic instead of powder and I doubled the sauce to have extra with the rice. This is definitely a keeper!

one of the best slow cooker recipes i have made. followed the reviewers advice of adding peppers and onions toward the end so they stay more firm. i also added some fresh garlic. i would have added some fresh ginger but didnt have any on hand. a great way to use up some of the vension in my freezer. Update: I used to make this quite a bit and forgot about it. So glad I made this again. This last time I didn't have diced tomatoes. I used an 8 oz can of tomato sauce and left out the cornstarch. It thickened nicely on it own. I added peppers, thinly sliced carrots and sugar snap peas during the last 20 mins while I made jasmine rice. Try adding ginger, sriracha, garlic, oyster sauce, whatever you like... Its a terrific base recipe that you can play around with to make your own. Its even good sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds. Yum!!!

I too thought this was average. I think it is the stewed tomatoes that I don't care for. The meat was tender, and it was an easy recipe, I just think it needs something more. I may use the recipe again and tweak it - or more likely I will try to find a different recipe.

This was pretty good: not the best, not the worst. Our family found, however, that this rocked when reheated the next day! Put it on a sourdough roll with a slice of swiss or provolone and a tablespoon of cider vinegar. Made terrific sandwiches!

I have made this twice since I found this recipe. The first time i didn't have any soy sauce so I followed the recipe just left that out and it was wonderful! The second time I used soy sauce and OH MY was that salty! My mother never used salt so I really don't eat that much salt as an adult and when I took a bite out of the one with soy sauce that was it I was done! I will continue to make this but from now on I will leave the soy sauce out it was better without it anyway! Thanks for posting it really is a good recipe!

Love this! I add about a tsp of ginger since I love ginger. Usually make it as directed, but yesterday I forgot to toss it in the crockpot before I left for work. Did not want to leave the meat for another day so when I got home I tossed it in the pressure cooker for about 10 min ( sorry- did not time it! ) and added the corn starch at the end and it turned out just great!! Same great flavor, and was quick and easy at the end of the day! Great either way!

This was very good.  I followed the recipe closely but also added a few splashes of red wine vinegar and teriyaki sauce. My family loved it.  My green peppers were very soft and if you would like more firm ones put them in toward the end of the cooking time. I will make this again for sure!!

Very good!  I used low sodium soy sauce and did not add the extra salt and I thought it was still a little too salty so I added more sugar otherwise everyone enjoyed!  I added the peppers and onions in with 1/2 hour left in the cooking process and they came out perfect. I tripled the sauce. Flavors are very nice and I added red pepper flakes to my bowl.

This was very good but the peppers do get too soggy.  I put them in about 45 minutes before we ate and they were still soggy so I would put them in even later next time.

This recipe was ok, it turned out pretty bland and dry so I added a few things and served over egg noodles. I would suggest using more liquid or making a gravy for it. I also added some pepper flakes and a few other things to spice it up. The meat turned out very tender though.

This was a good recipe that was easy to make.  I doubled the sauce and omitted the salt, however it was still a bit too salty for my taste.  Next time, I'll reduce the amount of soy sauce.

This is so delicious and well worth trying. I bought a London Broil (on sale at my grocery store) and cut it into large chunks. Then I sauteed it as directed. Like others suggested I added my sliced peppers to the crock pot an hour before serving and the peppers were tender but not mushy. I used both red and green peppers to make it colorful. The meat was so tender and flavorful. It went great over rice and my hubby cannot stop talking about how great it was. We had left overs for dinner the next night. Definitely a keeper. Thanks for a terrific recipe.

Excellent.  The only thing I added was I also seasoned with Tony's.  (I season almost everything with it)  I did put the onion & bell pepper in at the begining and they were very cooked down with no crunch to them and that is just the way I like it.  I will be making this recipe again. Delicious & Easy.

Wasn't my favorite.  The peppers were really mushy - I'd definately wait until the end to put those in.  The flavor was fine but nothing special to me.

I loved this recipe.  I am not a bell pepper fan but it didn't matter.  I used one red bell and one green bell and followed a previous poster's advice of adding it about an hour before I served the dish.  It may be a little too sweet for some people, but it was A+ with me.

I tossed my steak in seasoned flour prior to putting them in the crock pot, which helped thicken it a bit. I also used beef base (soup base) instead of bouillion it  gave a rich taste to it. This is a keeper!

I have made this recipe SO many times for dinner parties, I followed the recipe exactly (except I also didn't add my peppers (capsicum) until the last hour). It's a great dish to have when you want to prepare in advance so that you can enjoy time with your guests before dinner instead off fluffing around the kitchen, I usually team it up with a Morrocan Chicken dish and when I had a lot of guests I also made sweet and Sour Meatballs, all this in slow cookers and rice in the rice cooker, my kitchen was tidy and I was relaxed.

Absolutely fantastic. I served ours over home-made mashed potatoes. Simply perfect.

This is so awesome and easy!  I added the peppers only 45 minutes before serving, because I like the fresher,crisp taste...but other than that followed the recipe verbatim.

Very good recipe! My husband isn't a big fan of peppers and he enjoyed it very much. The steak was very tender and flavorful. The veggies were a little mushy but I didn't have the opportunity to put them in an hour before done cooking like some reviews suggested. I used 4 peppers (2 red, 2 green) and a whole onion but decided NOT to double the juices and it turned out great. Poured over a bed of rice. Will for sure make this again.

I didn't have any peppers, but needed to use up some sirloin steak.  I sauted the beef with the onions and 1 tbsp. of garlic.  I also added 1 tsp. thyme, 1 tbsp. worchestershire two shakes of pepper flakes and two tsps. of brown sugar instead of the white to the liquid.  One hour before it was ready, I added 1 1/2 c. quartered fresh mushrooms and served over rice with mixed veggies and my 11 yr. old twins had three helpings....no small feat in my household.

This is so delicious!  I used low-sodium soy sauce, eye of round steaks (I left these whole), and served over instant brown rice.  My kids and mom really enjoyed this.  I've made it several times, it's a favorite.

This recipe has way too much sodium. I was wondering if I use fresh tomatoes and low sodium soy sauce, would it change the taste too much. Any help would be appreciated.

This is so delicious. I made it exactly as directed, except for using one red pepper and one green pepper. I added the peppers in the last hour of cooking. They were tender but not soggy.

I am very disappointed with this recipe. I cooked this for three hours on high,tasted it and realized as others that it was bland.So I added 6 cloves of garlic,fresh mushrooms,2 tablespoons of corn starch,1 yellow squash sliced,red pepper flakes and cooked for another hour.The red pepper flakes helped but it still was watery,and I will not be cooking this again.I have never given a negative review on this site.

I was so excited to try this so I put it in my slow cooker before I left for work and set it on low for 8 hours.  I came home after about 7.5 hours and the meat and veggies all looked and smelled burnt.  The taste was alright and the meat was very tender, but definitely nothing special.  If I try it again, I'll cook for shorter.

Very good recipe, though I ended up cooking it for closer to 10 hours - it would have benefited from a little less time.  I cut the green peppers into strips, and didn't have a problem with them being too mushy.  Served with a side of garlic mashed potatoes, which complemented the dish perfectly.

Made this tonight and it's pretty good.  Scaled it down to a half recipe but still used the full can of stewed tomatoes.  I added a green and yellow bell pepper plus some dissolved cornstarch in water 45 minutes before dinner time.  Turned out pretty good.  we served it over either egg noodles or rice (I have picky kids) and we agreed that the rice was better.  I'll make this again and add a few things to the sauce to make it a little more flavorful.

I had to make this on the stove due to time constrictions, so I made a couple small changes. I added 1 can of beef consomme (so that it wouldn't dry out during cooking) and about a cup of thinly sliced carrots, then let it simmer on the stove at low heat for about 1-1/2 hours. Served it over steamed rice and oh my gosh was this so good! The flavors of the beef and peppers blended so well and the overall flavor was rich and delicious! A definite keeper! Thanks for the recipe.

I love this recipe, it is delicious each time. I cut the peppers pretty large so I can take them out of my bowl easily b/c I don't like more than just the taste of them in the stew. I usually thicken it up w/ a bit of cornstarch or mashed potato flakes.

I loved this recipe and so did my "picky" family!  I did not use the slow cooker method, yet, because I did not have time but on the stove top worked great also.  All I did different was use red peppers instead because of preference and sliced instead of diced.  Nothing major to make a big difference.  Loved it!  Thank you!

This was quite tasty, although, I think we are just not used to eating much meat. I served this over noodles and it was good.

This was very good.  I left out the tomatoes, and didn't pre-cook a thing. I added additonal frozen peppers and onions, (chopped), 1 hour before serving.  I also added 1 tsp of sesame oil before serving.  For my tastes I added additional garlic powder, onion powder, and Adobo.  I seasoned the vegeatable layer and then the meat layer.  I thickened about 30 minutes before serving with a cornstarch slurry.  Over white steamed buttered rice this was yummy!

We have had pepper steak before but not in a crockpot so I thought I would give this a try. We found it very disappointing as a pepper steak, kind of bland.

Used fresh garlic sauteed with the meat, and added the peppers 1 hour before serving. Otherwise, made as written with good results. Served over rice with a green salad, for an easy, Christmas shopping day meal. Thanks!

Made some modifications and found this to be excellent.  First off, I eliminated the tomatoes; I'm just not wild about combining tomatoes w/soy sauce.  Added 1 T. vinegar and some a few good dashes of red pepper flakes.  I think this gives it a bit more authentic Asian flavor than you would get with the recipe as written - think this would be on the bland side with out the kick of the vinegar/pepper flakes, as others have noted.  I also went w/one red pepper and one green to give it more visual appeal.  Oh, and threw in a can of sliced water chestnuts for crunch.  My husband loved it - leftovers were equally good.

Needed to use up green peppers and wanted to use beef, since we were "turkeyed out" from Thanksgiving.  I used the ingredient search and thought this sounded interesting.  Used fresh garlic since I didn't have garlic powder and fresh tomatoes because I didn't have a can of stewed tomatoes.  Having never tasted pepper steak, I don't know how it is supposed to taste, but this was delicious over rice.  Our company went for thirds AND fourths, so I don't think they were just saying it was good to be polite!  Ha! Ha!  Thanks for an easy recipe with a great result!

OK - just made this for the first time and my husband said he thinks this is the best crockpot recipe I have ever made.  I might have to agree.  This was TASTY!!

I browned the meat in a skillet, then I also browned the onion in the skillet.  Put meat then onion in the crockpot.  Dissolved the bouillon in the water, then added the cornstarch, soy sauce, sugar and salt to that liquid mixture.  I poured all of that on top of the meat/onion combo along with the tomatoes and just stirred it up.  It cooked on low in the crockpot for 6.5 hours then I added the peppers (used about 6 peppers instead of just two) and it was all done in another 1.5 hours.  This was simply delicious!  Will definitely make this one again!  Thank You.

This was a huge hit with my picky family. I made a few changes based on comments made. Slice the peppers and add them toward the end. Add a few spices like garlic and Worchester sauce. We served it over rice. There were no leftovers.

I loved this dish!  I made it just how the recipes reads, only I added minced garlic as one of the other review said.  I served over brown rice w/ a hunk of french bread w/ butter on the side.  It was so good I couldn't wait to eat the leftovers the next day!

Very tasty but when in the crock pot,but you need to add more liquids. This is a very easy throw togehter meal for a weeknight!great for those who like pepper steak.  Tip when using stewed tomatoes, use one with the Italian seasonings.  It adds more flavor to the dish.

I bought beef that was already sliced, but other than that, no changes and I thought this was wonderful! I cooked on low for six hours, and added the peppers halfway through since I like them soft but not too mushy. Served over white rice. I can't wait to have this again!

I used round steak, and cooked it on top of the stove.
It was very good, I simmered it for almost 2 hours total, adding the green peppers and mushrooms (I love them in anything) during the last half hour.
 I also doubled the sauce, and there was alittle left over.
Family loved it!

Honestly, I am surprised this has been reviwed as well as it has.  I thought it lacked in flavor and consistency.  I have made far better pepper steak or swiss steak recipes in the past.  I'm not trying to slam it, my husband and kids enjoyed it just fine, its just that it could have been better.

My family loved this dish. It was something different! I used one green pepper and one red pepper plus added fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. Plus, I doubled the liquid/sauce like others suggested. Dinner was ready in about 4-5 hrs on low. Don't forget to deglaze the pan that you brown your meat in for added flavor. Thanks for another great recipe!

Great recipe.  I don't like mushy vegetables, so I didn't add the bell pepper and onion when I put in the steak and tomatoes.  Since bullion cubes are so salty, I didn't add the salt either.  Cooking this again today!

This was quick and yummy. I didn't even slice the steaks or brown them. Put them right in the cooker on low all day. I added a large can of roasted red and yellow peppers so no chopping up peppers. Doubled the broth and omitted the salt as others suggested. also added a little Cajun spice for some kick. Served with lefover mashed potatoes. The whole family loved it. My Grandma used to make pepper steak for sunday dinners and it reminded me of her kitchen smelling so nice and homey.

Family really liked this.  I used fresh garlic and added green peppers an hour before serving (cooked on low setting).  The sauce is fairly thin and works well with rice.  I would thicken it up with additional cornstarch to serve with mashed potatoes.

This was so easy and has such good flavor.  My family loved it, even my picky 4 year old!  I browned the meat the night before, put all ingredients in the crockpot and started it on low the next morning.  It was perfectly done for lunch after church

Very good and very easy.  I added some red pepper flakes to spice it up s bit.  I also took the advice of others and doubled to the sauce. I still felt it needed some more juice after cooking for so long, so I added some beef broth (about 2 cups) and disolved cornstarch into it.  That gave me a lot of extra juice which was perfect for the rice that I served it over.  Excellent recipe.  I plan to make this quite often.

Wonderful recipe!  Instead of beef bouillon, I used a can of beef~the same amount.  It had a great aroma and tasted wonderful.  I also increased the cornstarch just a tad to thicken the sauce.

Awesome, easy and delicious, 

I used top round pre-cut for stir fry. Next time I'll use a more tender cut of meat. Still, it was really good. Add your peppers last. I doubled the gravy and served over rice.

Very good and easy.  I added rice right to the crock pot the last hour of cooking, so the rice soaked all of the flavors and juice up.  Very good.  I added a little extra water because of the rice, and it didn't take as long to cook as the directions said.

5++++++. This is absolute the best pepper steak I have ever tasted. So tender! I added the pepper in the beginning for we like the peppers soft. I did add an additional beef cube, and doubled the hot water, cornstarch, and soy sauce. Served with rice.

Overall I wasn't impressed by the dish, the broth was okay and the meat was tender but very bland in taste. I followed the recipe except I omitted the salt as others suggested. I added the bell peppers, and mushrooms in at the end of cooking. I cooked it at 4 hours on high. I also added worstershire sauce. Will not make again.

I made this recipe and my boyfriend and I loved it!  The only difference was that we diced and sliced the green peppers to add in some different texture.  It had really good flavor and we served it over white rice.  Delicious!!!  I was very surprised because sometimes crock pot recipes can all taste the same and this one was a definite keeper.

I used a 28 oz. can of stewed tomatoes and doubled ingredients from bouillon to onion.  Fabulous over mashed potatoes too. Thx Marge

This was my first time ever making/ having pepper steak. Not only was it really tasty but my boyfriend polished off the whole entire thing. I did however, triple the amount of water, boullion, and soy sauce I used. I even took some ideas of the other reviewers and added a few dashes of worcestershire sauce. I also added the peppers with about 1 hour left to the pot, added some broccoli too. Added cornstarch to get desired consistency for the gravy. I will be making this again!

Wow - whole family liked this! Left out the bell pepper (hubbie doesn't like). Was on the thin side, but all crockpot recipes seem watery. Need to figure out how to thicken. Still an easy, filling meal.

Very good. I used a different (cheaper) cut of sirloin, but can't remember which. Made recipe as is, adding one small clove minced garlic & green peppers at last 2 hours per others' recommendations. Very savory and the slow cooking makes the meat very tender. Next time I'd add an additional clove of garlic. Delicious, thick gravy- the onions and tomatoes practically disappear into it!

Very good. When I went shopping, the sirloin steak was priced high, so I purchased shoulder steak instead for about half the price and it was very good in this recipe. I did cut the amount of salt in half and that was fine for us

The meat was super tender, but this recipe needed more spice.  I followed the recipe exactly.  If I ever make this again, I may add some garlic and worchestershire sauce for a little flavor.

This is a wonderful way to cook elk steak!  This turns out so tender and delicious.  My children and husband commented on how they really liked it. I rubbed the elk with minced garlic instead of powdered and then followed the recipe exactly.  You could add an extra boullion cube if you wish to give more flavor to the elk, but it wasn't neccessary.

I really wanted to love this recipe, but it just wasn't very flavorful.  I followed the recipe, doubling the sauce as some reviewers suggested, and it smelled fantastic all day.  The final product (served over rice) just didn't taste like much of anything.  Not bad, just nothing special.

Really great recipe.  Good flavor and hubby loved it. He said we could have it at least twice a week.  Did cut the pepper into strips and added l more can of diced tomatoes.

Wow.  Its 11:41pm and I just got done making this and all I can say is wow.  It reminds me of what my mom used to make for us when we were younger.  The meat is so tender and its just to die for.  I did cook it in beef broth instead of adding water and the boullion.  I absolutely love it!  You HAVE to give it a try!

Simple and delicious.  The only thing I changed was to omit the salt, since soy sauce is salty.  Served over brown rice.

So delicious! The meat was so tender it was unreal! My only suggestion would be to add less salt. There was just a tad too much salt for my taste, but overall very good!

We liked this very much.  I left it in the crockpot much longer than the recipe suggested because of our busy schedules but it was still delicious over brown rice.

This was fabulous!  I cooked on high for 2 hours without the peppers, added the peppers and cooked on low for 1 1/2 more hours... they were soft but not soggy.  My husband isn't a fan of rice so I served it over whole grain egg noodles.. I think I would've preferred the rice... but it was still great!

Just made this tonight, very good.  Nice flavor, my 9 year old loved the sauce over the rice.  Not spicy at all, but would be easy to make spicy by adding red pepper flakes/other spices.  Was side tracked, and missed my timeframe to put in slow cooker, so I did stove top instead and still turned out great!  Adding to monthly rotation!

I thought this was a good recipe - there's so much more to add to it (veggies like mushrooms etc.) I served it for company and didn't quite feel it was "special" enough!
I'll make it again tho' for my husband and I.  Great suggestion about adding the gr peppers an hr. or so before it's done!
I love the pepppers a bit crisper !

We love these flavors (stuffed peppers are a favorite), but I don't think this recipe survives well in the crock pot.  The peppers were mushy and the flavors all combined as if this were canned food.
I think I'll just stuff some peppers when I want peppers and beef.

Good but not great. Only changes were to add fresh mushroom. As per other's suggestion, waited to last couple of hours to add green pepper (and shroom) so they wouldn't be too mushy. Worked ok. Cooked on low for 6 hrs.

Excellent recipe!  I replaced the sirloin with some in-expensive chuck steak that worked extremely well. Like most, I added the peppers with about one hour to go.(1 green/ 1 red).  I also added mushrooms.....

Soooo yummy, and so easy!  I cooked it on high in the crock pot for 2 hours.  I also added more water because I like lots of sauce, and I served it with rice and chow mein noodles on top.

This recipe was everything you would usually want from a slow cooker.  I added mushrooms, other coloured peppers, and a couple of cloves of garlic as well, just to zest it up a bit.

An easy recipe to make and it tastes good too. The aroma in the house as it cooks was well worth the efort. Adding the pepper in the last 30 minutes was a good idea.

This was great.  I used one green pepper and one red pepper when I made it for a little different taste and a colorful look and also used a teriyaki sauce in the place of soy sauce and sugar because I didn't have soy sauce on hand.  I will definitely make this again.

Great tasting recipe and simple to make. Easily altered to your style, I added more garlic and used sea salt. Next time I'll try the "stir fry" steak to make it faster, cutting up the sirloin was the longest part. Thanks!

This recipe is awesome! I made it tonight and added 1 tsp. of oregano, 1 tsp. of red pepper, 2 tomatoes cut in wedges and 1 package of mushrooms sliced thick.  As suggested by others, I added the green pepper and tomatoes the last 1/2 hour of cooking.  Will definitely make again!

Added 1/2 can of tomato paste to 1/4 cup of hot water and added to the slow cooker.

Served over yellow Spanish rice.

Outstanding!!!

Thanks... Even my very skeptical wife loved it.

So many wonderful reviews, this is not the kind of meal I would normally make, but I just had to try it.  My husband and I didn't care for it, but that's just us.

This was ok....I found it very salty, even without adding the salt that the recipe calls for and I used light soy sauce.  I don't think I would make this again.

This was very yummy!!!  I put some minced garlic in and I also waited til the last couple hours to add bell peppers.  I didn't add any salt, and it really didn't need any in the end anyway.  I will be making this again soon.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Fantastic! Personally, I liked it better on top of egg noodles rather than rice. Either way, it still was delicious!

This recipe was really easy and smelled great while cooking. My husband and I felt that it was a bit too salty. If I make it again I will skip the extra salt and may use low sodium soy sauce.

Tried this recipe "as is" the first time around and it was very good (definitely add the peppers during the last 1-2 hours of cooking to avoid the mush), but I think I was looking for richer flavor.  Achieved this the second time around by adding a gravy packet (as a previous reviewer suggested) and a can of V8 juice.  I had to use a bit more cornstarch to thicken because of the added liquid.  Also, I cook for six family members, and I found that I needed to double this recipe, as two of the six of us have man-sized appetites.  Served over hot egg noodles, instead of rice. There were no leftovers...  Delish!!! Perfect cool-weather meal!

All this recipe needs is some crushed red pepper flakes and some fresh chopped ginger in addition to the garlic.
I would definitely add the green peppers the last hour or so, but I was in a rush!

Very easy recipe for this novice cooker! I made this for my boyfriend, who thought it was quite good. The only changes I made was to add some red pepper (made it prettier!). I served over white rice - will definitely be making this again!

Overall I'd probably rate this a 4.5 b/c the sauce needed a better flavor for a 5 rating. However, the meat was very tender and delicious. Like other people, I added the peppers an hour before it was finished and they tasted great. I also doubled the onion and sauce. My mom used to make this recipe on the stove top and the meat was always rough! Thanks for the suggestion of the crock pot!

A save-the-day recipe.  My son has a 2 hr. football practice followed by a 1 hour karate practice, so the slow cooker has become a must in our home!  However, I managed to trip a fuse in the kitchen (construction) and we lost power. When I reset the breaker, I forgot to check the slow cooker before we left for practice. Alas, we arrived home for dinner (starving) and it was not cooked. So I whipped out the pressure cooker dumped the contents of the slow cooker in, and had this meal done in 12 minutes!  So, my 3 hungry guys think I'm a hero!  Great flavor and easy to prep and an inspiration for me to use my pressure cooker more often :)

Not bad. Could use a little something, I don't know what. Maybe a little spice. But on the whole it was good, just didn't knock my socks off. I even marinated the meat before browning it.

I like placing all of the ingredients in a ziploc the night before.  That way, in the morning, I just fill my crockpot with the contents before heading to work.  Very simple to prepare and very flavorful.  It always gets eaten up quickly in my house.

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish. My five year old ate the beef but my 12 year old didn't like the taste. I used a yellow, red and orange pepper. The last hour I turned the crock pot on high to really make the meat fall apart tender. I also added some extra corn starch at that time to thicken up the sauce. I will make this again and my son can have a hot dog!! Thank you for the recipe!!

Used whole peeled tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes because I didn’t have any. Also used some yellow bell peppers in place of some of the green bell peppers because I ran out. I put in 2 Tbsp tomato paste with 2 Tbsp. water in and added ½ tsp. of jarred minced garlic (scaled for 2 servings). Also I used ribeye steak. Maybe next time I won't cut into strips first to reserve tenderness.

This was very good even though I had to substitute the soy sauce for worchestershire sauce as I found I didn't have any when I started, and it is 12 miles to town to get it. I did find that it was almost the same as one I fixed on the stove top.

Yummy!!  My husband loved this and I asked me to add it to our meal rotation.  I used beef broth and added the bell peppers 45 minutes before we ate.  Delicious and so so easy!!

Yum. I decided to attempt to cook and found this recipe. I was home today with a sick baby, so I just threw everthing in the crock pot. It was delicious. My husband loved it and joked that he "might keep me around after all!" :)

Delicious and easy! I'm not even a fan of green peppers, but I will make this again. I didn't change a thing except to follow other people's advice and add the peppers in the last hour of cooking.

Great recipe.  I made a few changes: I also added 1/4 teaspoon of ginger root and didn't add the peppers until the last 30 minutes.  I also added about 8oz. of pineapple when I added the peppers.  yum!

Made this several years ago as my first slow cooker attempt, forgot all about it and made it again - it was excellent. Followed several others advice and put half of the green peppers in the beginning, and the other half about two hours out,perfect combination of nice and mushy and not so mushy. Leftovers are just as good.

The beef is really tender, and I loved the sauce.  I used one green and one red pepper.  I would definitely make this again.  Be sure to have bread to sop up the sauce!

We really liked this recipe!  I doubled the sauce and didn't add the peppers until the last two hours, these changes worked perfect for us.  The meat was so tender.  Served over plain white rice but might try fried rice next time.  Thanks for a great crock pot recipe!

Very tasty.  I really enjoyed that after browning the meat all you need to do is slice a few vegetables and place it all into the slow cooker and that is it!

We are trying to use up meat in the freezer so I made this using a London broil I found.  Followed it exactly except eliminated the 1 tsp of salt.  My dh did add a little salt at the table.  My 5yo refused to try it but I caught him sneaking some later.  Excellent recipe!

I liked how tender the meat was but I felt like them meat was missing something. Maybe more flavor. I will try adding more spices to it next time.

This is an easy, delicious recipe that I'll be making from now on.  The meat turned out so tender...I wish now that I'd doubled the recipe!

This recipe was alright after 5 hrs in the crockpot- delicious after 7.  I made it in addition to fried rice and we had a fantastic dinner.  My husband didn't stop picking at it until it was gone.  He told me I would have to make it again next week so he can share with his coworkers.

I made this for friends who came to dinner, and everyone loved it! Make sure you have lots of fluffy rice to go with it. My husband and I ate it for leftovers the next evening, and I took the rest to work for lunch after that. All in all, an excellent slow cooker recipe that leaves the meat very tender and flavorful. However, I am giving four stars because I agree with others who said the vegetables are a bit squishy when it's time to serve. Next time I will start checking for doneness a lot sooner ... maybe an hour or two sooner!

This was very good! I used a thin cut sirloin, and pounded the  snot out of it before I stuck it in the crock. It was falling apart when it came out! This recipe was good enough to warrant a spot in our rotation of family favorites!

My family and I had this for dinner today and we all enjoyed it. The meat was nice and tender that my three ate it with no problem. I left out the boullion cube and instead of water used beef broth. Everything else I left the same and served over white rice. Yummy!

This was fine, but not too interesting.  Don't think I will make it again - unfortunately, I think it's partly the fault of slow cooking that it's so hard to find interesting recipes - everything starts to taste the same (like stew)...

Ok, I am always looking for crock pot recipes, although my family groans every time it come out.  That's why I had high hopes for this after seeing the 5 star rating.  I thought it was pretty good--the steak came out tender and after seasoning with salt and pepper, I was happy.  My kids (8,6 & 3) didn't agree and kind of picked around the veggies and just ate the meat.  My husband said it was so-so.  I would make it again just because it was easy, but I wouldn't give it 5 stars.

Finally! I was giving up on slow cooker recipes, but this recipe saved my slow cooker from being thrown in the trash! Great flavor and easy to make!! Wouldn't change a thing!! I gave it only 4 stars as the meat was a little dry, a by-product of slow cooking I guess.

My sister made this recipe for me a few times and it was great.  Now that I am getting married next month and have a new crock pot, I made it for my fiance and I... BUT he doesn't eat meat, so I made it with Morningstar's FAKE steak strips and it was still EXCELLENT!!!

We loved it.  Only changed a couple things, I ran out of soy sauce so used 1 1/2 tbls. of worcestshire instead, and added whole garlic cloves to simmer all day.  I got home late, and this had been in the crockpot for 12 hours, but was tender, moist, and delicious.  Served over mashed potatoes.  Wonderful.

This is a good general recipe but it did not knock my socks off or anything. Its a variation of stew and I really like peppers so that was good. I cooked it on high for 3.5 hrs and added the peppers at the end.   Brown the meat well to improve flavor.  I made 1.5 amt sauce and probably two heaping tbsps of cornstarch.  It reheats well and boyfriend and friends of mine really enjoyed it.  I guess its comfort food

Good recipe Marge! Didn't have any canned tomatoes in the house so I subbed with tomato paste. Used low sodium beef broth instead of the bouillon and also low sodium soy sauce. Just for a kick, I found a third of a jar of of hot pepper rings in the fridge and I added them to the mix. Very tasty and thanks!

Oh my! this was so good.  My husband and I both liked it.  Will definately make again.  The only thing was that we preferred the peppers more crunchy but maybe that was my fault.  I made strips instead of chunks.  Will try chunks next time but its a great recipe.  Thank you.

This recipe was absolutely awesome.  I ate nearly the entire thing by myself.  I hate when I read about changes to a recipe, but I had to out of necesiity because I lacked certain ingredients.

First, I only had filet minon so I used that rather than sirloin.  Also, I had no beef bouillon but my dish was plenty beef tasting so I'm not sure what that adds to the recipe.  Also, I like my sauce a little thicker so I added 2 to 3 tablespoons of cornstarch extras during the cooking process.

FYI, this dish heats up REALLY well the next day and is great over a couple of slices of toast.  Thanks again for the recipe!

My husband and I enjoyed this, although it was not a favorite with my children.  I added red pepper flakes and fresh garlic when I browned the meat, which made it quite flavorful.  I also omitted the salt and used both red and green peppers that I added with about an hour of cooking time remaining.  Overall, a quick, easy meal that we will have again.

So good and very easy.  I used a can of beef broth instead of the boullion, also chopped some fresh garlic, and added a little red wine vinegar, worcheshire and some red pepper flakes to give it a little more zip.  We had it over buttered noodles.

This was really good!  I didn't bother browning the steak.  I also substituted the onions with matchstick carrots since I thought my kids would like that better.  I also did not add the salt and am glad I didn't.  It was perfect! Served over brown rice.

I made this recipe yesterday and it was delicious.  I used two cans of stewed tomatoes since I wanted some sauce to go on top of the rice.  I also used 3 green bell peppers.  I put it on low for 6 hours and it was perfect.

Made this last night and was a huge hit & so easy! Used deer steak, have tons in the freezer and oh how tender & tasty it turned out! I took the advice of other reviews and reserved half the peppers to put in towards the end (last hour), more starch at end, omitted salt & also doubled the sauce. Puréed the stewed tomatoes only because husband doesn't like chunks of tomatoes. Husband and 3 boys told me this is a keeper! Thanks for the recipe!!

I used some stir fry steak stips and added some water chestnuts and served it over chow mein noodles.  Followed other recommendations on the cornstarch and it came out perfectly.  Makes great leftovers.

I LOVED this! Yum! My husband's only complaint was that it tasted a little too salty so the next time I make it, I'll reduce the amount of soy sauce a bit... maybe by a tbsp. What a great, easy meal! Thanks!

this recipe turns out a pretty decent pepper steak. i love using my crock pot & simmered this dish all day on low. note: the only changes i made was to add the peppers & onion about 3 hours before serving (so they'd be soft but not mushy) plus i sprinkled in about 1/2 tsp. hot pepper flakes. thanks mitch!

This was wonderful! When my husband and children looked at it, they were convinced that they wouldn't like it. They quickly changed their minds after trying it - they loved it - and they went back for seconds! I did omit the salt and saved some of the peppers for adding in later as others had suggested, and I didn't brown the meat before putting it in the crockpot. I also added 4 more bullion cubes to add to the flavor. We served over noodles and we will be making this again! Thanks!

This is a keeper. Was very good and hearty for a cold winter evening. I added red and orange peppers with the green. I also added more soy sauce and it took a bit more cornstarch than called for. Never measure, so not sure how much more. We served over rice. I also added a bunch more spices. All and all very good and very easy to add you own touches to meet your taste. Thanks!

Very tasty and easy to make. I added a red pepper for color along with the green. My husband raved about how good it was. Next time I'll add some red pepper flakes as suggested by another reviewer.

This is a fabulous recipe.  I added mushrooms and used Bisto instead of the cube.  I sliced the green pepper and onion into thin strips.  I also added some red wine to the browned beef.  Wonderful!

I absolutely LOVED this as did everyone else in the house! Even my father who is ridiculously picky as to his food commended me on it. So super quick to make too! Will definitely be making again.

I thought this was really wonderful. I added a little brown sugar, just because we like things a little sweeter, but it would have been perfect with out it. Great Recipe!!!

This was ok.  I'm not sure if it was the tomatoes or too much soy sauce. I probably would not make this again.

I am not sure what it was about it, but had a weird flavour that neither my husband nor I liked. My son liked it. It did need more corn starch and I did put the peppers and mushrooms in about an hour before we ate. I will not be making this one again, but seems like it was me according to the other reviews!

Very good recipe!  Easy to make and nice presentation.  I packed the leftovers for lunch at work and it was still delicious...maybe just a little too salty though.  I did pass the recipe on to my mom, cause I think my parents would love it.

What an AWESOME recipe.  Even my picky 7 and 5-year-old liked it.  I used 1/2 cup water, 3 1/2 tablespoons of corn starch added mushrooms and dumped in 1/2 can of leftover Rotel.  It needed a little more salt and pepper, but it is a recipe we will be making over and over.  I put the peppers in right before I started the rice and the peppers turned out perfect.  Thanks!

Just made this again.  Put in some of the pepper and onion to cook in the flavor.  Cooked more veggies in micro with some sauce and then added to pot in last 1/2 hour.  Also used some oriental 5 spice (to taste), 2 cans of tomatoes and total of about 1/3 soy sauce to change it up a bit.  Served over rice.  Still a 5 star! And DID NOT saute ahead of time...what's the point to that?

This was very good an liked by the family.  I used 3 tbls. of constarch for thikening and extra soy sauce for flavor.  Beef was very tender and I used it over egg noodles.

This was oh so easy and oh so delicious.  I chopped up the peppers and meat the night before, and in the afternoon I just threw everything into the crock pot.  It was delicious!!!!  Much better than the recipie I had.  This was a great quick throw it together meal.  I did need to stir it a few times, so that it wouldn't burn to the sides, but that's because of my slow cooker.  I would Highly recommend this recipie!
3/2/2004-Delicious.  I doubled the recipie, added some chopped garlic and sliced carrots.  Easy and Delicious!!

I'll be saving this recipe.  Took the advice of some others and added the peppers half way through cooking time.  Excellent over rice and my family enjoyed the leftovers as a burrito filling the next day.  Thanks for a good one, Marge.

Served this to company last night over noodles and it was a big hit! Like some of the other reviewers, I would add the peppers during the last hour and double the cornstarch.  It's one of those recipes you can play with a bit, and still come up with a great tasting meal.  Will definitely make again and again.

Not a bad recipe for fairly little work.  I too added the peppers the last hour or so and also added another T of corn starch then too.  We ate this over white rice.  It was a good "winter" meal even though it wasn't winter here. :) Will make again this winter.

This was delicious -- I used canned beef stock, mexican flavored tomatoes and 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes.  I also added the bell pepper the last 30 minutes of cooking (one red, one green).

It was very good over rice.  I also used the leftover rice and "stew" to make burrittos. Yum!

Will make it again and again.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I added extra cornstarch after reading other reviews and it turned out perfectly!  I'll definitely make it again!

The flavor of this is outstanding!  Not bland like other recipes that I have tried.  I did thicken it a bit more with cornstarch the last 30 minutes and turned the crockpot up to high.

This was a great recipe. I cooked it on high for 5 hours.  The meat was very tender and it had a great flavor.  My husband said it would be even better with a little kick of hot sauce.  I thought it was perfect the way it was.  I highly recommend this recipe.

YUMMY! We cooked up some brown rice and threw it into the pot before serving, mixed it all together and served it in bowls. Even my picky 6 year old loved it. Will keep this recipe and make again!

Made this the other night, I thought it was just okay, however, my husband and father thought it was delicious.  I followed several tips from others such as adding the bell peppers at the end and added some garlic etc, etc. Have to say it was soooooo easy though!

I made this recipe for dinner tonight and my husband and I both liked it. I served it with mashed potatoes, and the broth was a good topping. I used cubed steaks, and I didn't cut them up. I also added a small can of button mushrooms! This was so easy to prepare. I dredged the cubed steaks in seasoned flour with salt and pepper before browning and threw everything else together while the steak was browning! Everything was together and ready for cooking within 15 minutes and I was out the door for work!

The beef turned out tough. It's maybe because I used beef round sirloin. I may try a better sirloin cut next time.

Great recipe.  I added the bell peppers about 3 hours before serving as some other reviewers suggested.  I did not think I would care for this but the tast was excellent.  I served it over buttered noodles and a side of steamed broccli.  I will definitely make this again.  I also used fresh garlic.

My husband and I really liked this dish. It was simple to put together. It was flavored just right. I served it over rice and that was it. It was not necessary to have any other dish with the pepper steak. I love slow cooking because you can put it in the pot and forget it.

I cooked this in a large covered skillet, because I had the time.  This was an easy recipe with just the right flavors I remembered from having pepper steak in restaurants.  Because of the beef bullion and canned tomatoes, I eliminated the 1 tsp. of salt and my family loved it.  I will make this again.

One word yummy.  I added some red pepper flakes, actually I added a lot or red pepper flakes.  Being from Southern California, I like it hot.  Prepared egg noodles and I must say it tasted very good.  Even better next day for lunch.  Also added two fresh garlic cloves crushed.  Kids thought it was spicey, next time I will go easy on the hot stuff.  A must try recipe.  Thanks.

Over all this was a pretty good dish, I will make a few changes next time. But this time I used rotel tomatoes instead of stewed, a nice addition to it. And I used red and yellow bell peppers instead of green. Then served over rice.

Good basic recipe, could use a little more "zing" as far as flavor goes. I will make it again using some of the other reviewer's suggestions for additional flavor. It was a little better the second day!

The best review I can give is that I have a 10 year old grandson who doesn't like anything.  He tried this and cleaned his plate!

I've never had pepper steak before, this was a wonderful recipe and the egg noodles go great with it.  It was very filling.  My husband likes spicey foods and I was thinking that adding some salsa to the mix just prior to serving would really add a neat flavor to it.

This was excellent.  I used half mule deer and half antelope and it hid all wild taste completely.  I tasted it after about 2 hours and realized the kids were going to love it and quickly doubled the recipe.  Will definetly make this again and again.

I'm with MAKENZIE on this one. I was a little disappointed...expected traditional pepper steak. It was very good, but much like my swiss steak recipe only I prefer that recipe. Would probably make again, was quick and good, I mixed in the leftover rice and was much like spanish rice........great leftover.  Maybe the name should be changed, that might help.

Absolutely delicious. I doubled sauce ingredients and used beef stock instead of boullion cubes. As for the green peppers, I cut them into quarters, added them with meat and removed them 1 hour before serving.  I then added 1/4 yellow pepper, 1/4 red pepper, 1/4 orange pepper, 1/4 the green peppers and 3 cups sliced mushrooms 3/4 hour before serving.  I also used low sodium soy sauce. Results were supurb. Can't wait to make it again.

Very delicious recipe!  I added one pepper at start of cooking time then added the other the last 2 1/2 hours of cooking.  I had kids in and out of the house all day and each one asked, "What is that delicious smell?"  The meat becomes very tender, the liquids make a nice gravy and the flavor is wonderful.  Thank you Marge!

Made this today and followed the recipe, except I threw in a little more diced oni, and, like others, added the pepper for the last 1.5 hours. Served over rice - easy and delicious! Next time I will add a little more garlic powder ( hubby is not a garlic fan and I didn't want to overdo it)! Will be making again! Make sure you brown the beef first -- it really adds flavor!

I left it to cook for my husband and kids when I left for work.  (They are the most picky eaters ever!)  I was greeted at the door to hear how great supper was!  I used beef sirloin round steak.  It was really tender and filling.

Very tender and good pepper steak flavor!
Update:  I used to serve over rice, but I started adding the flavor packet from a beef or oriental top ramen packet and crushing up the noodles over the top of the crockpot towards the end.  Really good!  I also make this when peppers are on sale and use 1 green, 1 red, and 1 yellow or orange.

Excellent Recipe! I didn't brown the meat or have the stewed tomatoes(I just 
used a can of tomato soup). My husband loved it and I will make this often! Served 
it with a side of Steamed Broccoli for an all round great meal!

This was one of the simplest pepper steak recipes I have ever tried.  Especially wonderful on a hot day, doesn't heat up the kitchen.  I added a couple dashes of worcestershire sauce... was awsome.  The kids loved it!

Great recipe! My husband and I really liked this.
My 3 year old wouldn't touch it, though. I added 
some mushrooms about 20 minutes before serving. Yum!

We made this recipe using sliced tenderloin steaks... it was beautiful, smelled great and was terrific over rice!  Our 4 year old and 1 year old also loved it!  Deffinately a new favorite recipe in our home!
