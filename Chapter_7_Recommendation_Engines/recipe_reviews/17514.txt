This recipe is an excellent dish for a party! My friends are asking to make them a pie till this day. I did a couple of different things. I used whole wheat pie crust, I made one pie with chedder and one with guyere cheese yummy! I added shredded carrots, spinache broccoli, red bell peppers, tomatoes. Instead of cayenne pepper I used black pepper. They don't call it garbage quiche for nothing you can add what you like! I'm going to make another pie with the same basic ingredient except I'll add spinach and seafood!

Awesome! My husband (a chef) loved it too. We participate in a veggie co-op and I this week I got some Swiss chard that I didn't know how to use. I put the Swiss chard along with some mushrooms and broccoli in this quiche. Fantastic! I also used cheddar and mozzarella cheese because it was what I had on hand. We had it for dinner tonight and have a whole other quiche that I will take to work for lunch for the week. Lucky me! Even our extremely picky three-year-old ate it without (much) complaint. Definitely a keeper!!

Very tasty quiche - I cooked one and froze the other to eat later.  It took a little longer to cook than the recipe called for - about  an hour and 15 minutes total.  Next time I plan to use more spices - I think I'll chop up a few cloves of garlic and add some red pepper flakes or something.

I cut the recipe in half, used leftover Christmas ham instead of bacon, kept the green onions and tomatoes at the same amount and I used three large eggs. Because I was out of fat free half-n-half, I used fat free evaporated milk. I did throw in one small chopped organic red pepper, a little dijon mustard, onion/garlic powder, and a little Frank's Hot Sauce. We all liked this, though for a half recipe, I'd like to double the cheese next time. This was a great way to use up odds and ends in the fridge and leftover Christmas ham. We ate this with leftover Unbelieveable Rolls, which are also from this site. NOTE: I did scrape out most of the innards from my roma tomatoes so they wouldn't water down or gooey up the quiche. I just cut it in half length-wise, then carefully used a spoon to scrape out the seeds.

I've made a lot of quiches, but Hubby said this was the best! I stumbled upon this recipe because I had some Gruyere cheese to use up, and this proved to be a real winner. Made it exactly like the recipe except used cherry tomatoes instead of Roma. Also, it was done about 10 min. before the recipe said. YUM!

I made this dish for dinner tonight and it was the best quiche I have ever tasted!  My husband loved it too.  I substituted cheddar cheese & yellow onion, and skipped the tomatoes.  Also, I used 2% milk instead of half and half, to lighten it up, and it was still delicious.  Will definitely make again!

Awesome!  I made this in two separate bowls and pans using different ingredients (ham, cheese, onions, mushrooms in one and turkey, cheese, brocc, and spinach in the other).  I cut the center out of some squares of tin foil and covered the crust area after the first fifteen minutes to keep it from burning.  Worked great!  Cooked perfectly and set up in 10 minutes afterward.  Got tons of compliments.

I have renamed this.  Macho Men Only quiche.  This was very good.  The only thing I changed was I used fresh aspargus instead of broccoli and added fresh mushrooms which I sauteed in a tiny bit of bacon grease.  I also made my own pastry.  Highly reccommend this recipe.

This was a tasty quiche. I did not have Gruyere cheese, so I used shredded sharp cheddar instead. I used 1/2 cup diced & saut√©ed Vidalia onion to replace the green onions, too. To cut the fat, I used 1% milk. Just for kicks, I added about a tablespoon of feta cheese... YUMMY!

Very yummy.  I used what I had already, which meant that I made my own crust, used half of a ham steak (cubed) instead of bacon. cheddar instead of Gruyere, a large head of broccoli, a medium sized red onion instead of green onions, and left out the tomatoes.  It was delicious.

Very good!  I used 8 cherry tomatoes instead of Roma tomatoes and sauteed, diced white onions instead of green onions - no problem.  It is a nice meal-in-one kind of dish with the protein in the eggs & milk, then the veggies, and the carbs in the pie crust.  My husband and son both said "very good!"

This was my first quiche, and I couldn't be happier! I used "Easy Pie Crust" recipe from this site posted by B1BMOM because it looked the fastest (I normally use pre-made from the market). I highly recommend this nontraditional, but excellent crust. Seriously - try this! I don't know how it would work for pies, but for this quiche it was perfect!! Didn't have Gruyere, so used mostly cheddar with a few sprinklings of feta. Perfect!

YUM YUM, I used fresh asparagus instead of brocolli and served with a caesar salad.  I like that it makes 2 pies - leftovers for breakfast!

Used this recipe for my first quiche ever and it was great!  Very easy to do.  I used a frozen pie crust to make it easier.  Also cooked the bacon and yellow onion the night before my brunch to cut down on prep time that morning.  Used cheddar cheese since that is what we had.  Looking forward to trying the Gruyere and other filling combos.  Used a deep dish pie crust and the quantities were perfect.

Pretty good. I make a few changes (of course)- I use a combination of Gruyere and Swiss cheeses, regular onion instead of green, and I break up the broccoli into really small florets (larger pieces don't cook properly which is kinda icky). I also just mix the veggies in with the eggs, cheese, cream and seasonings, and pour everything into the pie crust. This is one of my favorite quiches. Thanks!

This was very good, I liked the flavor and texture.  We had it for dinner tonight and I'm looking forward to the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  Since my pie pans are bigger it made one pie and enough leftover for a small tart pan.  I didn't have to cook it longer either.  I didn't use salt and pepper but since we like lemon and herb on broccoli and in eggs I used some of that.

I made this for an Office Brunch and it was a big hit!  The cheese really gave it a great taste.  It took some time to cut up everything and grate the cheese but it was worth it.

I made this for a baby shower to feed about 15 women. It was totally delicious! First quiche I've ever made and it turned out great. Decent amount of prep work but it's worth it. I also agree with another reviewer, that the tomatoes made it a teeeeeny bit watery. But it was still superb. I'll make it again, definitely.

this was very good, nice consistency and good flavor.  I made a few changes based on what I had on hand...omitted the green onions, used 5 slices of bacon and used yellow and big boy tomatoes (seeded.)  I used a smoked cheddar, but would like to try it with gruyere.  I was able to fit it in one deep dish pie plate and it cooked in the same amount of time.

Good.  Could be better.  The tomatoes makes it very watery.  Could use a more appetizing name too.  When asked what the name of the meal it is doesn't sound too good to have to say "garbage quiche". haha  Over all not a bad dish. :)

Good base recipe - I really didn't use any of the ingredients listed except for the egg base and spices. For the filling I used some spicy breakfast sausage, frozen broccoli, green onions, garlic, grape tomatoes and a marble cheese mix.

Wonderful! The variations on this could be endless. I used a frozen pie shell (did not thaw) and it made the prep really easy.

This recipe is awesome! I cut the recipe in half & made it for my husband & myself and I'm ashamed to say we ate it all in one sitting! 
The only thing I changed was I used swiss cheese instead of Gruyere and it was delicious, I left out the broccoli and nutmeg, used crushed red pepper flakes instead of cayenne pepper, and used a seasoning mix of salt, pepper, garlic and onion to taste [similar to Paula Deen's house seasoning].
I will definately make this for the next special occasion that comes along....highly recommended!!

I made this recipe exactly as it's written except I had to substitute Gouda for the Gruyere cheese since my grocery had none. This quiche looked and tasted fantastic! This recipe is definitely a winner and very easy. It tasted so much better than the quiche I had at a restaurant's fancy brunch. You will not be disappointed.

This is one of my favorite quiche recipes. I use my own crust. I made this for a bridal brunch and this was the first one to go. Not too heavy, lots of flavor. I used the recipe as stated on this site.

This was one of the 3 types of quiches I made for a PTA brunch I catered last week for 50 women.  I made 2 Garbage Quiches (as deep dish quiches) and they both went so fast!!!!  I couldn't believe how much people loved them-the gruyere is awesome!  I made one quiche with bacon and the other with grilled chicken and both were hits.  The green onion and tomatoes were such a complement.  I can't wait to try this quiche again with other vegetables--so many options.  By the way, I did re-name the dish--I didn't think Garbage Quiche was too appealing!  Ha Ha

Extremely easy and tasty!  Made it for the office on a whim and it was a huge hit.  I used cheddar instead of Gruyere and I also used frozen pie shells.

Yum, this is delicious.  I used cheddar because I had some on hand and left out the nutmeg because I didn't have any and it came out great.  Very easy and very flavorful.

Made this but shortcut is to not crumble the bacon, just lay across the bottom.

I covered the bottom of crust with the crumbled bacon. Added balsamic caramelized red onion then jack cheese. Then broccoli, garbanzo beans and after adding egg mixture used sharp cheddar cheese over top. Best quiche Ive ever had!

I changed things up a bit when I made this. I left out the tomatoes and broccoli, and instead used chopped baby portobello mushrooms. The combination of the bacon, mushrooms, gruyere cheese, and green onions is fantastic. I made it for Christmas morning and it was so delicious! My mom even put in a special request for me to make it again for brunch on her birthday in July!

Great recipe!  I made a few changes in changing the variety of tomatoes since they are growing like crazy in the garden.  I also added in red onions as they are a family favorite.  I will definitely keep this recipe on hand, especially when hosting any breakfast or brunch gathering.

I made this truly awesome recipe.  I just tweaked it to accommodate my families tastes.  Instead of bacon I used steak.  Furthermore I added tomatoes, sweet peppers, and onions.  For the cheese, I used alfredo sauce. This made a truly scrumptious dish that I will prepare again.

Yum! I bought 2 frozen marie calender's pie crusts and just placed the filling into those while still frozen. I baked according to the garbage quiche directions with no problems. I made one with bacon and one without so the vegetarian guests had something to eat. I thought the recipe was delicious and simple!

I really liked this! It was quick and really easy! I only had sharp white cheddar cheese so I used that instead. I'm excited for my husband to try this one...I'm sure it will be a hit! I will definitely make this again.

Made this twice and it comes out perfect every time. I usually double it and make two at once. I buy crust dough in pie pans but I need to perfect my crust-making abilities!  So many combos of quiche ingredients,  so little time.
