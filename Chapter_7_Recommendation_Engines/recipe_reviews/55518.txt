These are wonderful!  Easy to make- I made several batches so I filled them the night before and kept them in the fridge overnight, and the next morning just brushed them with the egg and popped them in the oven. I took them to my sunday school class, and now they want me to bring breakfast all the time!

WOW!  I've had so many compliments after making these.  They're delicious!  My guest couldn't beleive that I made these at home.  They thought for sure that I picked these up at the bakery.  Next time I'm going to try different varieties including: cream cheese, strawberry, cherry or lemon filling with the chocolate drizzle or powdered sugar frosting.

A fast & easy recipe for chocolate addicts. They are just as good without the drizzle if you are running short on time.
