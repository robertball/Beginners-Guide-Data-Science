This is good!  For anyone worried about overcooking the clams, pfft. Canned clams are cooked and brined to the point that it would take an act of God to change their texture - it really doesn't matter when you add them. If you are expecting a "sauce" you won't get it. This recipe is more like a flavor coating for the pasta, clams and mushrooms. I was worried it would be too salty, but I actually ended up having to add salt after tossing the pasta. I also added some nutmeg, which was nice. For reheating, you may want to add a little olive oil for "cling". The guys LOVED this; I liked it. Thanks for the recipe!

I haven't made this but reading the recipe, I can't imagine cooking canned clams for 20 minutes, they would be rubber by then. They should just need to be briefly heated to warm them.

Fabulous!  I never made a clam sauce w/sour cream before but it really added to the flavor.  My kids LOVED it...and the are finicky eaters!  Easy.  And, regarding the reader who claimed she didn't even make the recipe but gave it a bad rating...shame on you.  Don't rate something until you've tried it!

The sauce is a little thin for my taste so I add a little heavy cream plus a few strips of bacon to give it more flavor. My husband loves this dish.

This was a very good recipe, simple to make and quick. I love mushrooms so that was a nice touch. When I saw the sour cream on the list of ingrediants I thought that was weird but tried it anyway and it just thickened up the sauce and made it even yummier. Recipe is a keeper.

A reviewer states that the clams will become rubbery if cooked for 20 minutes - if they were fresh clams, this would be true but canned clams are not going to get rubbery from cooking. As a matter of fact because they are already cooked, brined and canned, they will become less rubbery as they absorb more liquid during the cooking process. One reviewer who as acutally made the recipe states this as well. This is a GOOD recipe! I didn't add mushrooms or fresh parsley (used 1 tsp of dried) and it was FABULoUs!! I also added a bit of kosher salt (1/4 tsp) to the clam sauce as it was cooking and LOTS of salt to the pasta water. It was perfect! Don't expect an alfredo style "sauce" that you are going to sop up with bread - that's not what linguine and clams is! If you like REAL linguine and clams -try this recipe and don't be afraid to follow it as written. I will make this again and again - we loved it!

I minimized the recipe to 4 servings and it turned out terrible! There was no sauce. I won't be making this one again.

This is an excellent recipe. I really enjoyed this. I didn't add the sour cream and it still was fabulous. This is a definate keeper. I used baby portabellas and they tasted so good in this sauce.

It was bland... and then sauce just wasn't the clam sauce I was expecting.  I actually felt sorry for my guests.

I thought this was great!  I used fresh clams and steamed them in the sauce (obviously omitting the juice from the canned clams).  Once open I removed them then added the sour cream and parsley then poured the whole pan back over the pasta and clams.  I did need to continue to cook the sauce for a while to reduce and thicken it.

read all reviews and did add the bacon, and extra sour cream. also had some cilantro on hand and added a little with the parsley. Also, do not need to cook clams 20 minutes if you have let sauce reduce some before adding. Also topped with fresh grated parmesan. We love parm. thanks.and you don't have to use dry wine. I prefer pinot grigio or reisling so used the Pinot instead.

Doubled the clams, doubled the sour cream, which did make it rich and very yummy. My college kids pretty much eat anything put in front of them but in this case, leftovers were even heated up. Thanks.

This was great with fresh garlic chives and parsley from my garden.  I only simmered after adding the clams for about 5 minutes and added a little more sour cream. Perfect! Going to try with shrimp next time.

Delicious and simple. A real keeper. I added a bit of olive oil since I was afraid of burning the butter. I also didn't have any sour cream, but it was still good.

Loved it! I did't quie follow the recipe as instructed, however.  Instead of using the 4 cans of clams, I only used one and added a can of mussels and added twice as much sour cream as indicated.  It was perfect!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

Nice base recipe. Scaled down to 4 servings and doubled mushrooms, added a very large chopped green Chili, (sauteed in olive oil instead of butter) used dried parsley, and added enough sour cream to give it a nice texture. Used 1 can of clams. Served mixed with whole wheat angel hair, it was delicious.

this was SO good! i cut this down to three servings and used closer to 3 1/2 oz of pasta than 4.. i subbed margarine for the unsalted butter and maybe that's why i didn't notice it needing salt at the end like others complained about.. i used cilantro in place of parsley and i left out the sour cream (lactose intolerant).. i noticed after simmering for 5 min's the wine had almost completed cooked off so that's when i added the other ingredients.. i didn't rinse the clams, just poured everything in together.. i simmered for another 5 min's and then added the pasta.. i felt like this tasted better w/o the pepper so i'll remember that for next time.. ty for the recipe!

I've made this recipe 3 times now and it turns out amazing every time!  The flavors blend so well together and I add a 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes to give it a little something special.  I love garlic so usually add 2-3 extra cloves.  I highly recommend this recipe for a family meal or even if you are hosting a small dinner party.  Delicious with a nice spring mix salad and sour dough bread.  Also very tasty as leftovers the next day if you are lucky to have any left.

This came out just how i remember it.  I didn't have parsley and honestly feel it mostly adds color anyway. I added a little nutmeg as someone else suggested and some basil.

It seemed like such a good recipe on paper, but the flavor was rather bland and disappointing to our taste buds. However, it was still good enough that I am willing to try and experiment with some different herbs - if I do, I will definitely make much smaller quantities.

Really enjoyed this!  Great flavor and both my young children like it!  Don't expect a think white sauce - it is more of a coating.  I added some thickner to create a sauce, and that worked well.  I am considering reducing the butter next time.

The basic recipe is great...I made it healthier by using soy margarine and tofutti sour cream..also added cornstarch to thicken...used bottled clam juice which gave it more taste...my husband who is on a low cholesterol diet thorougly enjoyed it!

With a couple of additions this cane out great. I added the zest and juice of one lemon to butter mixture and added extra garlic, some black pepper and used a cup of chicken broth instead of the wine because I didn’t have any. I liked it and would make it again.

So good and easy to make. Seemed like my clams had a slightly excessive amount of liquid- over 2 cups - but it did reduce well. I did add quite a bit more garlic as we love garlic in our house but all in all it was delicious!!

I rarely rate a recipe 5 stars, especially the first time I make it. I think 4 is an excellent score and that is generally how I rate a really good recipe. But this one is great and deserves 5 stars! I made it exactly as submitted and will make it that way again. Oh, except I didn't rinse the clams. I couldn't figure out why that would matter. Thank you for this excellent recipe.

I used this recipe as a base.    I omitted mushrooms (hubby hates them) but I added approx 3 Tblsp grated Parmesan/Romano cheese, and a little heavy cream to make it into more of a sauce.  I got two thumbs up!!!!

Loved it ! The only thing is if you want a creamier sauce add more sour cream and parm to taste & a few sprinkles of red chili pepper for a little kick as needed. We live in the PNW so we bought 20 lbs of fresh clams for a family feed ! I made pots of clams separate then some with this recipe and of course lots of garlic bread ! If you're feeling adventorous then add heavy cream to the clams. Even a saffron creamy mix is delicious !!!

There are two basic recipes for this on all recipes and I pulled from each. Next time I would cut the mushrooms up into smaller pieces so it all fits into one bite.

I made this tonight! Never dreamed of adding sour cream! It was great! I always add some crushed red pepper because I like it. I also used lemon pepper because I like that too! I also added some frozen green peas for a one pot meal and color, and yes...I like it! I usually make this with fresh clams added also but having only canned on hand was great and fast!

Simple, quick, outstanding.  
We read all the reviews before diving in; the only change we made was to increase the sour cream slightly (there were 2.5 tbsps left in the container, so we tossed in the extra 0.5 tbsp) and to add 1/2 cup of heavy cream.    My sense is that, in the end, the sour cream/heavy cream decision is akin to "add salt to taste."  It won't fundamentally alter the finished product, but it does afford a chance to personalize the finished product to unique taste preferences.

The first time I made this I thought it would be disappointing, but  found myself going for 2nd helpings!   This has become a favourite recipe  - and no  - there are no worries about overcooking canned clams.   Thanks for a delicious and easy recipe with ingredients that I always have on hand.

I have been wanting to make a meal with clams but have been very nervous to try, but I must say this was DELICIOUS! I made quite a few changes but I followed the ingredients and it turned out simply amazing, probably one of the best dishes I've ever made. I used frozen chilantic chopped clams, heavy cream instead of sour cream, lots of minced garlic, and added spinach. I used too much butter and it came out a little slimy feeling on the lips, but other than that I think this was a complete success! I also used spaghetti noodles and cooked them in water with salt and olive oil and cooked the noodles on low.

I did make this recipe. I went by the instructions and something just was off. Not enough taste and the canned clams were pretty blah , if I would make again I would try for a stronger flavoring with a fresher protein. It was ok but we never finished the leftovers.

Good base recipe. Used 1 Tbsp parsley, 1 tsp cilantro and basil, all spices from tubes. Added ground pepper and double the sour cream. Simmered until slightly thickened. This sauce gave a nice flavor to whole grain pasta. Did not give the recipe 5 stars due to the additions.

Light & refreshing!  You can taste the subtle freshness of each ingredient.  Omitted the sour cream, halved the butter, and just added a little cornstarch-water slurry to thicken it up.

Good and easy to do. Even better the next day. My husband LOVED IT! He is the fish guy, it was a little to fishy for me. Next time I wont add all the clam juice. We did fallow another reader advice and added bacon which added alot of great flavor to the dish.

This recipe was just delicious and very easy to make.  I did not have sourcream so I used heavy cream instead since it was sitting in my fridge.  It turned out very good.  Thank you for sharing it.

Love this recipe, this recipe of linguine with clams has been made at the house many times now and it never fails. Great taste and very simple if you are out of time and need something quick this is pretty easy to make for those quick dinner night. My husband absolutely loves it!
