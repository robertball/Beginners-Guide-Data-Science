These were our favorite new Christmas cookies.  I hated the double dipping, & decided after to mix colored sugar with the nuts and put them on at once.  They looked fabulous & the nuts didn't have trouble sticking once the sugar was on, as in the original directions.  With these modifications, 5 stars.  The taste is a wonderful almond flavor.  Without modifications, because of the mess I'd say 4 stars.

I cannot believe that these cookies haven't been reviewed here for 3 years?  I made these cookies today.  They taste wonderful.  They remind me of marzipan!  My dough was a little on the dry side and hard to work with, so next time I would try 2.75 cups of flour and see how it is then before adding the full 3 cups.  I started out with chopped almonds and ended up using VERY, VERY finely chopped almonds!  Just chopped them even smaller in my food precessor so they really coated and stuck to the cookies.  Will make again for sure!  Thanks! ***re-reviewed 1.22.09 - I made these again this past Christmas and added in Raw Sugar (the large brown crystals) with the ground almonds.  It was fantastic.  It did make them a bit sweeter and crunchy.  I like them both ways.

My daughter made this recipe for her geography class to go with her report on Finland.  She didn't like the dipping in egg part, but liked the finished product.  I thought they were pretty tasty myself.

Follow the original recipe:). I read some of the reviews and omitted the egg paste before the almond/sugar roll because of the mess. You really had to grind the almonds very fine for it to stick well.  I had leftover almonds, so I made the recipe again but did the egg paste. It really was not that messy! And the cookies looked exactly like the picture because the paste was able to grab on to the bigger pieces of almonds and to the festive Christmas sugar crystals.  In the end, the cookies did taste the same but the 2nd batch had more of a crunch...yummmmm.

Great flavor. Ground whole almonds in food processor. Ran out of almond extract-added some ground almonds into batter. I also combined the sugar and almonds to eliminate one step. I cooked on greased cookie sheet not ungreased. Came out great. Rolled some into balls instead of sticks-still came out good. Will definitely make next year for Christmas.

I rate this a 4 only because of the messy factor. I actually made 3 cookies as suggested, then mixed in my almonds in the dough. They took 12 minutes to cook and are delicious.  They don't look as festive as the picture though, so I'm making a thin glaze frosting to put on top.

I made these for Christmas. Nice dough- easy to work with. The only complaint was the egg bath was really messy between the sugar and then the almond so use latex gloves and keep plenty of Bounty on hand. Taste was nice- very nice, but wondered if it was worth the effort.

i overbaked for a few minutes because after 10 minutes they came out very soft and didn't feel cooked through. DO NOT DO THIS! they will stiffen up after they cool. but they were still delicious. i also mixed sugar with the crushed almonds, and it worked.

These were terrific!  I had never made them before, but took a chance and made them for my cookie exchange at school.  They were a huge hit!  The only change I made was to roll them in holiday sprinkles instead of sugar to make them more festive.  I will definitely make these again!

A beautiful holiday cookie.  I found I had to make a few adjustments to the recipe. I ground the almonds and sugar together in a blender, this way I did not have to double dip the dough.  Instead of logs I formed the dough into balls rolled them in the eggs, which I watered down a little, then rolled them in the nut/sugar mixture.  Then I pressed the balls down to form coin shaped cookies.  I found you need to be very careful not to overbake these cookies.  Remove them from the oven as soon as the bottoms are golden brown.  I will defiantely add these to my annual Christmas baking.

these were a disaster!!!! i made these cookies for my geography class and people were scared to eat them. I had no idea what kind of almonds to use, so i pu in blanched almonds. Like other reviews suiggested, i combined the sugar and almonds together to roll the sticks in. This method worked okay for the first like 15 cookies but then the mixture became so saturated with the egg that came of the sticks, that i could only get the stuff to stick in akward clumps. When they came out of the oven almost all of the cookies were pretty gross looking, a yellowish color and with strange clumps. When i tried them, the coating was chewy and oddly flavorless. The inside was okay iguess but had a weird aftertaste.

For a cookie "stick", this dough was a lot softer than I thought it would be. I ended up shaping the dough into balls, and then flattened them. The cookie texture ended up something like marzipan, but it was very good. We made lots for Christmas cookie gift bags.

These cookies were a hit at our Christmas festivities.  I found the double dipping did not work very well; I had a bit of trounble getting the nuts to stick.  Next time I am going to follow some of the suggestions from other reviewers. I made some into sticks and some into rounds; either way they turned out.  I will definitely make these again.

A lot of work but worth it!  I used non-hydrogenated palm shortening instead of butter to make the cookies dairy-free and they came out tasting great.  I didn't have almonds so I used walnuts, pecans and macadamia nuts instead (individually) and my favorite was the macadamia nuts.  YUM!  Thank you!

These were delicious-a little bit of work, but soooooooo worth it!  Followed the recipe exactly and they came out fabulously!  I wasn't sure when they were done as they are really light in color and don't brown but I trusted the recipe and 10 minutes was perfect in our oven.

The taste of these cookies were the greatest!!  My favorite cookie!!  Couple complaints were that they were very messy to make, they didn't look anything like the picture and they stuck to the pan, so next time I make these I will grease the pan.  Also like the other comments I had to ground the almonds more then I expected to have them stick, ground them more like a fine powder.  Other then that they tasted great and I will try rolling them in red sugar crystals or green as suggested.

5 stars for the versitility of this recipe. I love these, they are very biscotti like so I added couple of pinches of anise seeds (great flavor combo). To make these even easier, I kept the dough just a little on the moist side and did away with the egg wash on half the batch- I couldnt tell the difference. Lastly I also mixed colored sugar crystals with the almonds ground very fine and curved them in to C's- These were as beautifull as they were tasty. A perfect cookie to accomany your favorite cup of coffee.

These cookies are pretty good. I cooked them for the amount of time stated but they didn't look done. I am uncertain if they are supposed to have a nice golden color so I took them out. Mine are also a bit fatter and shorter than those pictured here, though I made them the recommended size. Flavor wise they are a little bland but I like that they aren't sweet. These are a nice classic cookie that I will probably make again with slight revisions.

These cookies are delicious, but the egg dipping was definitely a mess.  When I make them again (and I will) I'll put the cookies in a colander as suggested by Cassdra, and pour the egg over.   I don't think I let them drain off enough egg and I had crispy edges melting together when they came out of the oven.  I started making logs and ended up just rolling into about a 1 1/2 inch circumference and cutting 1/2 inch pieces to bake in cookie shape.  I just sprinkle nuts on top after the egg and sugar dips.  They tasted amazing!!!!

When I made these for the first time, they were a hit and the flavor was all there! When I made them for the second time, the dough was a little dry. Still, everyone loved them! They were totally worth the hard work!

Well worth the time and effort.  Took much longer than the 25 minutes I was told and definatly messy, but everyone raved about them!

Not as light and crispy as I thought it was going to be... but, it tastes very good. We dipped the ends in milk chocolate and then rolled that in red/green sugar to make it festive.

Let me first say that for taste and presentation, this recipe is easily 5 stars.  HOWEVER, if patience isn't your thing, I wouldn't try these.  I found the dough to be fragile and difficult to work with.  The whole coating process is messy and time-consuming.  After removing my 1st batch from the oven, I waited the 5 min to remove them from the cookie sheet as instructed.  Saying the cookies were cemented to the cookie sheet would be an understatement.  I practically had to chisel them off.  So my first batch was basically ruined.  I did not wait the 5 min for my second batch, and they turned out fine.  By the third batch, I was out of patience and just rolled the remaining dough into balls, threw them all at once into the remaining egg, and then threw them all at once into the sugar and almond mixture.  This is what I probably should have done right from the start. I swore I would never make them again, but they were a hit no matter where I took them.  I will probably atttempt again and see how things go.
