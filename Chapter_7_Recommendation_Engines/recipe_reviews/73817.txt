My dogs LOVE these treats.  I couldn’t find liver baby food so I just pureed chicken livers for a substitute.  I don’t add much, if any, water because I prefer a stiffer dough that I roll into a log and just cut slices to bake as needed.  Also, I found that if I bake at 250 for 15 minuts, flip, then bake another 15 minutes, the bottoms won’t burn.  I rate this recipe 5 stars because the basis includes ingredients that are very healthy for dogs so you can feel good about feeding these treats to your ‘kids’ and it’s easy peasy!!

Six Stars!  Easiest thing to make and bake. Instead of water I use broth (chicken or beef). Even my neighbors pets come sit on my steps each day for a snack. Try a little cheese in these too.  DOGGY GOOD

I've made these twice so far.  My dogs (all 3) love them.  The first time I used chicken & gravy baby food and dropped by a teaspoon.  I got about 2 dozen cookies that way.  My kidz get a treat with each successful trip outside, so that didn't go very far.  The second batch I made with beef and gravy baby food and then I piped them with a frosting tip.  I used a sandwich bag with the corner cut off and a big tip on it.  I made closer to 75 cookies that way. They kinda looked like little hershey kisses.  I baked for 15 minutes.  The kidz totally approved.

My brother and I thought this was really easy to prepare.  We don't have a dog (yet!).

As you can see from my picture, my little Lily was hypnotized by these. She absolutely loves them. I could not find liver in the baby food aisle so I used a jar of chicken and gravy. Thanks so much for these winners! UPDATE: I roll about a teaspoon in little balls and then press them down on the cookie sheet to make a cookie shape. I also bake these at 250 for 15 minutes and flip them over and bake for another 15 minutes so the bottoms don't get too brown. Still have not found liver baby food, but the chicken & gravy baby food seems to suit her just fine. We love this healthy treat! UPDATE II  i had no wheat germ so I subbed dry infant rice cereal and it worked perfectly. I now triple the recipe at Christmas so I can give out little gift bags to our neighbor dogs??

The two dogs I treat enjoy these liver licker dog treats.  The biscuits I make turn out a little wet.  I'm going to be watchful of the texture this time.  See if I can get them to be a little less sticky when placed on the baking sheet

My fellow is real picky in what he eats. He loved these. Loved them!!! They were really easy to make too. I have some to my daughter for her 2 dogs and they wolfed them. I am going to try another flavor next time.

The only thing I changed was the baby food. I did a batch of chicken and one of beef. Where can you get liver baby food? I would use chicken or turkey gizzards in the future. My three pooches loved them.
