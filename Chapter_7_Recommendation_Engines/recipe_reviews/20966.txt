This recipe was a huge success with my friends!  I don't have much luck with coffeecake/muffin recipes, but this one came out great!  The batter is a bit thick - it doesn't 'pour' - but I didn't have any problems spreading it over the berries.  I agree with another member that halfed the amount of pecans....that was plenty.  I added a few drops of fresh lemon juice to the icing - it was great!

I was disappointed after all the great reviews; I only used one cup of pecans like most people said and I love pecans but I thought it was too crunchy. My husband on the other had is eating the cake right now and thinks it is "great". I did add a chocolate glaze rather than the plain vanilla one. It also took longer to bake than the recipe said.Next time I will only put nuts in the bottom of the pan to come out on the top of the cake and perhaps that will work better for me.

This was very tasty.  Next time I would add half the amount of pecans, it was just too many for my family.  I mixed blackberries and raspberries, very good combo.

DO NOT USE 2 CUPS OF FROZEN RASPBERRIES as it makes it too wet . My mistake for sure. Also the batter is way too thick it's like a thick muffin batter.
Next time I will certainly thin it down with a bit of milk. Taste was very good....I wound up with raspberry floating cake lol....again my fault..

I cut this in half for just me my husband..the batter is thick, and obviously does not "pour" so I mixed the berries around with the batter in the pan and spread it to the edge.. I used lemon juice instead of milk for the glaze.. very tasty

The batter was too thick. Followed the recipe to the letter and didn't have enough batter to finish filling my bundt pan, even after I thinned it a bit.

All I can say is WOW!! This is the best thing I have ever done with black raspberries, sides jelly of course! I took this to a summer party and it got rave reviews.  Even the kids ate it, seeds and all.
Thanks, Sherry

Very sweet-good for a brunch.  I used all blackberries and toasted walnuts.  Everyone liked it. Thanks for the recipe.  It was a nice change from plain coffee cake.

The best coffee cake recipe... EVER!  I followed the recipe to a T, using raspberries and pecans.  It was so delicious I made it a second time with blackberries and almonds...YUMMY!  The batter is thick but it spreads well over the berries and nuts with the proper tools.  The moistness of the cake is wonderful so there is no need to change this recipe.

Ok recipe, but something was off... I used frozen raspberries and walnuts instead of pecans. I didn't have any particular problems with the consistency or the process, I just didn't like the taste. Probably won't make it again.

Cake is yummy.  I wish I would have read the other reviews first.  Definitely let the cake cool a little before removing from the pan, mine was a little lopsided.  Also, I was glad to see that others stated the batter was thick, I was afraid I did something wrong.  Otherwise, I will definitely make it again.

Very good taste and consistency as written. The word pour should be changed to something like fold or spread, as batter is more like for muffins. When done & cool, I inverted from bundt pan into a pie plate. Sprinkled with powdered sugar last.

I had to add some milk as batter was too dry. Don't think I will make it again as not a fan.  The cake wasn't moist enough to mix in with the nut/berry mixture.so it was in layers. If I were to make it again I would cut back on the nuts & add them & the berries to the cake mixture.

I made this for the first time today, with raspberries from our garden. It's moist and tasty and I'll make it again. The reasons I didn't give it 5 stars; as others have mentioned, the batter wasn't pourable, I had to add some milk to thin it, and next time I'll incorporate the berries into the batter, rather than layer them, because layering them results in berry overload in some spots and no berries in others. I also omitted the pecans. Delicious!

Great use of fresh blackberries!  I subbed vanilla yogurt for the sour cream, and then only needed to use 1 tsp. of vanilla.  Also followed other's suggestions and only used 1 cup of pecans.  I layered mine in reverse order (batter, berries & nuts, batter, berries & nuts) and put it in an 8" x 11" pan.  I also added a little butter, brown sugar, and flour to the nuts on top to make a crumb topping.  Everyone loved it, and it looked great!

This was an incredible coffee cake. I made it just as it was written and it came out perfect. As one other had mentioned it isn't pourable but I just spooned the dough onto the fruit and nuts and it turned out lovely. I will definitely add this to my regular cakes :^) Thank you,

This was just ok, next time I will find another way to use my freshly picked blackberries. Batter was very thick and hard to spread and you should probably cool longer before removing the cake from the pan as to let the berries stay put. Icing is very sweet.
