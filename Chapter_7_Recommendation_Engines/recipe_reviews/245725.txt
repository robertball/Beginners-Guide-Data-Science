Uncertain what the extra 2 tablespoons of flour are for. If it was to be included with the 2 cups of flour, maybe it would be less confusing if it stated 2 cups plus 2 tbls of flour. It's listed separately, but not mentioned in the recipe.

Instead of waiting for Christmas season to come, I took upon myself to bake these goodies in Spring time and shared them with friends. This one is a good recipe and a holiday gift idea. Thanks, Chef John!

Note to self: When recipe asks for 1 cup of butter, it means 2 sticks of butter.

For a Christmas twist I added about an 1/8 tsp of peppermint extract and crushed peppermint candy. Everyone loved them.

These are easy to make and taste great!  I love the powdered sugar coating for the holidays.  Just make sure you get all the butter completely mixed in:;  i had one lonely piece that spread from a blob of unmixed butter.  They are sweet, crumbly nutty good.

I used pecans. Same yummy goodness with a different nutty taste. More like pecan sandies. Definitely hold out the 5 min before coating with powder sugar and be sure to roll them twice if not three times.

I've been making these for years and they are good and simple to make.  My kids didn't think they were sweet enough, but they are perfectly sweet in my opinion.  They are a nice addition to any Christmas cookie plate and because they are simple to make, you can spend more time on cutouts and other fussy cookies.

Very simple, the hardest part step is waiting for the butter to come to room temperature.  Set timer for 15, but expect to add time - watch closely for cookies to brown.  Perfect!

Love them soooooooooooo much. Right before you bake them you can make whole in the middle of them (make sure not to push all the way to the bottom). Then once there done baking fill the whole with jam.

These cookies are the best! I make them every year at Christmas. They are so tender and melt in your mouth. Chef John has done it again. I'm not sure why I only make these during the holidays. They are wonderful any time of the year.

I LOVE Russian teacakes, so Russian teacakes + Chef John, sounds like a winner. Nope, these lacked flavor and were pretty  dry despite being slightly brown on the bottom. I think the lack of flavor can be blamed on the unsalted butter. The other recipe I typically use is very similar to this and uses salted butter.

I got about 45 cookies following the recipe exactly (well, almost!). The only thing I changed was  that I microwaved the mixture for 20 seconds to soften the butter for easier mixing. Used a small wooden spoon instead of my hands.

Made these for Christmas Eve. Family loved them. I had always wanted to make these but thought they required a lot of work. These will be on my favorite cookie list.

Perfect and delicious! Made these with my grandkids in Texas. They had fun rolling them to bake and rolling in the powdered sugar. Used a small scoop to make them uniform in size. Thanks Chef John!

I followed directions to a T. Chef John hasn’t failed me yet!!! This recipe turns out perfect. Per suggestion, I did cook for 15 minutes and set my timer for 4 minute follow up. This recipe does make exactly 35.

I made this with gluten free flour.  The consistency of the batter was different, however, it still turned out delicious.  Thank you. I will make again for sure.  My 2.5 year old had fun mixing the batter with me.

Truly melts in your mouth and so easy.  The hand mix method meant no appliances to lug out or beaters to clean. Yay!  Definitely toast the nuts. I added some mini chocolate chips to mine.

These cookies were always around the house during the holidays and were a favorite.  So glad to watch Chef John's video to review the process, especially double rolling the cookies in the confectionery sugar.  The only suggestion I have is adding an additional 1/2 t. vanilla to increase the flavor.  Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars. The texture is perfect.

I had lost my Mom's recipe for these cookies.  I knew there were many variations, but our family always liked Mom's best.  Chef John's version tastes just like Mom's!  Thanks!!

These cookies were a big hit.  crunchy and buttery and super easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly except maybe my rolled balls were a bit too big.  Next time I will roll them smaller, like bite size.  Also, mine took 25 minutes to bake and did not brown on top at all.  After 15 minutes, I turned the heat up to 375 deg thinking they weren't done and let them stay in for 10 min more but still no browning so, I took it out and followed the rest of the recipe and they still came out great.  And the chef's notes does say you may need to keep them in longer.  Might have something to do with altitude?

These cookies are a smash with guests. I didn't change the recipe, although other nuts would work.  Walnuts are best. Thanks so much.

I made this recipe following directions exactly. The Russian Tea Cakes turned out as stated. They were so dry. The taste was so bland it was like a dry round ball of flavorless flour that was over baked. ( This is what the tea cake tasted like to me and my family ) I took the other 35 little morsels to work with me for my co-workers opinions. They each tasted them and three of my co-workers loved them and asked for the recipe. Others liked them and munched on them. I only had a couple co-workers who felt like I did. So that being said, I think it is actually -- to each his own. I wouldn't remake these just because of our taste.

We did two batches. One was significantly over cooked (20 min), the next was slightly over-cooked (15 min). I’m not a baker at all, so I think we just had a tough time looking at the cookies and being able to tell if they were done or not.

I followed the recipe here.  SOOOOOOO much easier using your hands to mix.  I have burned out 2 mixers over the years on making these.  I love the dump and mix method.  I wore gloves so I wouldn't get the dough in my nails - worked perfectly.

As for "packing" the powdered sugar  Who knew???  I've always measured it out like flour, but packing worked just fine.

I used my smallest scoop to make the little dough balls before rolling them to round them out in my hands.

I did toast my pecans beforehand.  Yum!

I also baked the cookies longer as Chef John suggests.  In my oven, I baked for 18 minutes. 

These came out perfect and my husband and friends raved.  
The texture and flavor is wonderful.  Enjoy!

Fabulous recipe. I  make these every Christmas without fail. Just be sure not to over bake these. Bake these just until set, if they are browned, they are over baked. These just melt in your mouth. Thanks for the recipe.

When I read the recipe, it reminded me of the Greek cookies my mother made for Easter, only we ground the walnuts instead of chopping them.  I've been looking for that recipe for years, and this is it!

Brings back memories! My grandmother used to make these. I modified it a bit. My daughter has a milk allergy so I used vegan stick butter from earth balance.  It worked great.

I made the recipe as instructed.  They are so delicious; perfect buttery/nutty flavor and not too sweet.  I'm sure they'll be enjoyed at my Christmas party tonight!  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

This is the perfect recipe for these delicate and delicious cookies.  I have tried and failed with other similar recipes. Chef John's video is worth watching!  The simplicity in making these cookies is an unexpected surprise.  thank you for a great recipe!

these were really good! they're buttery, crumbly, and nutty. the only note i have is that i measure in grams, and the powdered sugar measured to 55g instead of 40g.

Very good and tasty!! Only the recipe has a mistake I'm sure. It says 2TB of flour and 2TB flour. I'm positive it's supposed to say 2 Cups of flour.
