I love these.  I feel like the waiting 15 min is so the egg doesn’t cook with the hot dough.   Also if you make a double batch cook them separately initially because the tapioca flour will not bind correctly.

Batter was so runny that I added another cup of tapioca starch.  Then, bread balls flattened and did not puff in oven.  The result was  chewy toasted cheese pancakes.  The flavor was good.  I will try another version of this recipe.
