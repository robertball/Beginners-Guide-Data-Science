This was so wonderfully simple and tasty! we have access to fresh eggs so we used those, I used amaretto liquer instead of the coffee since that what i happened to have on hand, I think I will use a bit less amaretto since 1 cup made it quite strong, maybe the coffee liquer is not so strong, serve it up in a frosty glass and it's amazing!
