I used 2 mashed plums instead of baby food. I also reduced the sugar to  1 1/2 cup...reduced oil to 3/4 cup. I bake it in a 13 X 9 baking dish. However, the bread still comes out very moist, fluffy, and tasty. It has a cake-like texture. I will definitely keep this recipe. Thank you.

I was looking for a recipe to use up some of my home canned plums (I have no idea why I canned like 20 jars of plums in the first place, what can you do with canned plums????). I pureed the plums in the blender, I have also used pureed apricots and bananas, all with excellent results.

This receipe is wonderful.  I had to substitute a few ingredients because of my husbands allergies but it tasted wonderful and was very moist. Thank you.

I made this for Christmas gifts last year and it received rave reviews from the those who received it. I also enjoyed it very much. A moist and food tasting loaf that is simple and easy to make.

I expected this to have the texture of banana bread, or a muffin. Instead, the texture was that of an oily sponge. Couldn't even taste the plum at all...very disappointing.

This recipe is great, I make it with a few little alterations. I use mashed plums, less sugar (1 1/2 cups), a little less oil (3/4 cups), as another reviewer recommended. I added a mashed peach once to the two plums, and mashed persimmon another time, both were great. I also added 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cloves, and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. Everyone who ate it loved it. My husband claims he likes it better than banana bread.

Good! I reduced the oil like suggested and that was a good move, Im sure.  Next time will use the reduced sugar too.  I made this is july, it would be far better suited to the winter holidays. Will make again.
