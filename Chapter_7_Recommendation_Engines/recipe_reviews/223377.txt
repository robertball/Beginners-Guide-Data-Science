I used reduced fat mayonnaise and I threw in some crisp crumbled turkey bacon. I went a little lighter on the dill weed only because my family dosen't LOVE dill weed like I LOVE dill weed. Very basic but VERY delicious. All the ingredients in this recipe work together well. My husband and oldest son both went back for seconds--that's always a good sign.

Good basic recipe for a dill potato salad.  I had fresh dill on hand so I subbed that for the dried dill called for in the recipe.  I think it put this tangy combo over the top.  My tasters enjoyed this salad very much.  Will make again often.

This is a wonderful recipe I do use fresh dill when it is in season but when it is not I use dried. Also make sure your celery is very crisp it turns out better that way. I hope you enjoy my updated potato salad.

Made this today for a Christmas dinner. We were pretty disappointed. It was very dry. Way too much potatoes for the mixture. It was also a little bland for my taste. I added some garlic powder to it and it helped revive it a bit. It wasn't bad, but I definitely will not make it again.

I enjoy this recipe and it allows me to use fresh herbs from my garden (as in I use fresh dill as opposed to dried).  I have made this three times for parties and it is mostly enjoyed.  The most common complaint is the salad doesn't have enough dressing for the amount of potatoes called for.  While I have increased the amount of dressing, I also found it helpful to be certain the size of your potato cubes is kept small; it's amazing what a difference it makes to the texture of the overall salad.  The red onions are a nice touch of color and strength!  So, to summarize, we enjoy this different type of potato salad.  It seems consistent that increased dressing is called for by those eating it, adjust your potato size as desired, and enjoy!

I really loved this recipe! I added a little bit of paprika just because that's what my mom always used to do. I love that the ingredients are simple and fresh.

This was a really easy, and very tasty potato salad.  I used all the exact ingredients except for the potatoes.  I didn't have reds, so I used regular baking potatoes and it was very good.  I will try next time with reds and leave the skin on, I think that would be even better.  I don't understand the other reviewers who said it was dry because I had more than enough dressing and the potatoes were covered evenly.  Thanks for a nice recipe!

This potato salad was delicious! The only thing I did differently was add more buttermilk and mayonnaise, I like my potato salad wet and it was pretty dry when I measured out all the ingredients. It definitely has a strong dill flavor so if you're not a big fan put less in.

Very good recipe. I wanted something a little different to go with ham. I didn't peel the potatoes and I had fresh dill so I used that . Everybody raved about it.
