use SEA SALT!!!! it is KEY to this recipe, believe it or not!!  Try and use fresh tomatoes and you can even use tomatoe halves instead of slices....You may not consider tomatoes as a great side dish or a summer salad but in Italy it is common.  I have always made it with tomatoes, sea salt and garlic oil and LOVE it - sometimes adding fresh basil but i am now going to try it with parmesan and a clove of garlic on each tomatoe half.

I was in a hurry, so I deleted the MSG, substituted dried oregano for fresh, and used garlic salt.  This was still the most delicious part of the meal.  Very quick and easy.

Really enjoyed this recipe.  Fun (easy) to make, and delicious to eat.  Like other reviewers, I skipped the MSG (why use this to begin with?!?).  And, like another reviewer, I used dried Parmesan cheese (not freshly grated) - so I didn't have that problem of the cooled cheese sliding off the tomato...   I served it with "Olive Blasta Pasta" (recipe also on this website) - and it was well received by everyone at our dinner gathering.  Yes - I'll be making this one again.

I make something similar, but generally during the summer when the quality of tomatoes is so much better.  I also usually just roast them briefly in a hot oven. I have a good amount of Roma tomatoes left over after the Christmas holiday and this was the perfect use for some of them.  I went a little lighter on the Parmesan and oregano and added some fresh parsley. Very pretty and very tasty, and I think I actually prefer this method of broiling the tomatoes rather than oven baking them. The topping gets all nice and golden without the tomatoes overcooking.  I didn't use the MSG, not necessarily because I have anything against it but because I don't buy it. We really enjoyed this fresh, easy and healthy side dish which also serves as a colorful garnish!

This is one of my top ten recipes.  I've been making these for years and love them as a snack, side dish or appetizer.  Do not put in the MSG, but add a dash of lemon pepper or lemon juice for extra pow.  Top with a little mozzarella cheese, then serve on top of some crunchy bread.  YUM!

I made this as a side dish to a grilled chicken dinner for dinner with friends.  It was so awesome that eveybody's response was almost too much for the dinner table.  I used fresh basil and used the jarred parmesan romano combo.  I find it melts better and stays soft.  This is a wonderful way to use those summer tomatoes.  It has a fresh and flavorful taste. The dish is also beautiful if layered when assembling.

This was good, but I overcooked it so the tomatoes were too mushy and think it would be better with a semisoft cheese on top.  It definitely doesn't work with a "melty" cheese on top.  Too hard to cut through.  Will make again but maybe with a goat cheese?  Great use for all those fall tomatoes.

I didnt use msg and they turned out great! I have to say I didnt actually measure any ingredients, rather, just put on how  much I thought I would like. Very nice, quick side dish or snack.

Excellent broiled tomatoes. No MSG, but followed exactly. They were quick to put together and popped them under the broiler right before dinner. I can see the possibilities with different herbs....next time tarragon YUM!

I made lamb chops and needed something different for a side dish.  I made this but left out the MSG and I added bread crumbs before sprinkling the parmesan on top.  DELICIOUS!  Easy prep and clean up.

This was a quick and easy side dish to the pork chops and mashed potatoes I made for dinner tonight. You can really play around with the ingredients to suit your taste with this recipe. I didn't measure out the seasonings, but rather seasoned to taste. I added some basil and a bit of garlic powder and didn't quite have enough parmesan cheese, but it still turned out very well!  Quick, easy, and quite a compliment to any main dish. Thanks for the recipe!

Great slant on tomatoes but agree with another reviewer to use sea salt.   Never, never MSG because it is not allowed in any of our cooking.   Thanks for submitting this recipe.

Right after the first bite I was powerless to stop myself from going "Mmmmmm."  To my delight, my roommate did exactly the same thing.  We declare this edible tomato plate a winner.  

I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  As there are only two of us, I only used two tomatoes and two cloves of garlic, no msg.  Two cloves of garlic gave a very strong flavor, but it compliments the oregano extremely well.  Most of the other seasonings I just sprinkled to what I thought was reasonable about as much as the recipe says.  As for the parm, I skipped the measuring and just covered each tomato, but not to heaping  Looked pretty much like the picture in the end.  

DELICIOUS! 

Make sure your tomatoes are big and fresh.  You want them to still be juicy after the broil!

Excellent recipe! I only gave 4 stars because of the MSG, there is NO reason for it. The kids and I loved it made a great side dish.

Simple & delish. I had a wonderful home grown tomato. I was only doing one tomato, but I'm a garlic nut so I used 2 cloves. I don't have any MSG and had to use Kraft Parm, but still when you start with a wonderful tomato, how can you go wrong? Yum!

YUM!  The only problem I ran into was that once out from under the broiler for a few minutes the shredded parm I used started to harden and when we went to cut into the tomatoes all the cheese slid off...but wouldn't stop me from enjoying them!  Delicious.

These made a good side dish along side our tilapia.  I used roma tomatoes and skipped the MSG.  I didn't measure out the ingredients...just added them until they "looked" good.  Thanks Stephen.

I make these all the time but cut back on calories and fat by eliminating the olive oil.  The tomatoes do not dry out at all.  Very yummy!!!

bf said this was really good.. i think it was pretty good but something was missing.. i would've liked to have put a bit of mozzarella & probably would have liked it a lot more.. shoulda used all the salt.. i always do half b/c im sensitive to it.. i'd cut back on the pepper which is weird b/c we love pepper.. i think it would've gone good on some kind of bread

I thought these were amazing, and my husband was equally impressed.  I used small tomatoes fresh from the vine, and used all the ingredients but less of them really decreased the oregano, because I did not have fresh, used just a tiny bit of dried.  So Delicious!

Absolutely delicious!  I only wish I had had some crusty bread to go with it like another reviewer had suggested.

These tomatoes were very good!  We even made it with 'shaker' parmesan and my boyfriend accidentally bought ground oregano and they were still good.  Will try them next time with fresh parm and oregano.  Yum!

These were a huge hit at a party recently held for our church singles group.

This was good. A recipe I actually had all the ingredients too, wow! I used dried parmesan and added some mozarella on top. I did it in a toaster oven so it took like 15 minutes to (partially) brown instead of three!!! My cheese started to slide off as it cooled also but i was already halfway through the meal lol. Dont be afraid of the salt and DONT USE MSG! If the food is really good you dont need it and this was.

No changes.  Very good.  Fresh Oregano recommended.  Probably much better with tomatoes in season, but even without, very, very good.

Very good side dish! I made this for a group and omitted the garlic, only because my main dish had garlic. I didn’t want to over power guests, in case someone doesn’t like garlic. I didn’t use the MSG either.

Italian Nutthouse Broiled Tomatoes Haiku: "So here is the deal - this was SO easy to make, yet taste was awesome!" I had to use dried oregano and shakey-can Parmesan (I know, blasphemous!), but I plan on making this easy and delicious recipe again and will make sure to have the good stuff on hand. But even w/ the short-cuts, we couldn't believe how quick and wonderful this was - tasted like healthy juicy chunks of pizza!

Hubby hates tomatoes (I think he's crazy) but he had something similar at a restaurant when traveling for work and actually liked them.  He said this recipe was even better than what he had.  Thanks for broadening his taste buds.

Very good and very fast.  I used parmesan petals instead of grated and I wonder if the Kraft stuff would have been better.  The petals melted beautifully and started to brown at about 6 minutes under my toaster oven broiler, but the cheese slid off my ripe and therefore wet tomatoes.  Maybe romas would have held the cheese on better? Thanks for posting; I will make this often.

This is really good! I have an over-abundance of fresh tomatoes from my garden and I could easily make many meals from this recipe. Thanks!

These were good, but would be better if something was added.. If only I had enough cooking expertise to know what it needs added ;)
