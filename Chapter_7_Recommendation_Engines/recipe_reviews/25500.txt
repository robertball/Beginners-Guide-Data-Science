I made this for a "cooking party" using a great local bbq sauce and baby portobella mushrooms.  People who claim to hate mushrooms were coming back for seconds and thirds on these!  Easy, tasty and a crowd pleaser...wish I had tripled the recipe!  I was eating the leftover filling on toast the next day!

wow.  This recipe was tasty! I substituted with Philadelphia Fat Free Cream Cheese, eliminated the bacon bits.  I also used I Can't Believe It's Not Butter Cooking Spray and coated the foil with it and sprayed it on the mushrooms before placing in oven.  I also sprinkled Mrs. Dash.  This was such a healthy appetizer!!  I will be sure to make this as a healthy snack.  Thank you!!

These were quite tasty, I made them for a party and they were a success.  I used 2 packages of mushrooms as well and I used 2 packages of bacon crumples, one I mixed in the  mixture, and the other I sprinkled on top.  I would make this easy tasty recipe agaon.

These are very good, for sure you need at least two packages of mushrooms. I will make again.

These were ok, the recipe made a lot more than the one package of mushrooms, I'm glad I had bought 2 packages and I still had filling left over.

This is unbelievably tasty. I generally use it as a base and switch up the kinds of spices whenever I make it. Chopped green onions is a good addition, as well as some garlic and paprika. It's also good spread on portabello mushrooms.

It is a strange flavor and texture but pretty good and fast. I put all the ingredients in a ziploc bag and mixed them up together, then I cut of a corner of the bag and piped in the mixture. Much less mess.

I did not care for this at all but my husband liked them. They are very mushy and not a good flavor.

Yum.  My husband loves anything BBQ and really liked these.  I used pancetta instead of bacon and used 1/2 cream cheese, 1/2 shredded mozzarella because that is all we had in the house.  Also, as we were eating, we tried a dash of texas pete (hot sauce) on top--EVEN YUMMIER!!  I also used the mushroom stems chopped up and sauteed in the mix. The filling could be a good dip.

I just made these and they are NOT that good!!!! Frozen ones from the grocery store are better. Whoever thought that 1 package of mushrooms was good for this has no clue how to measure. You end up throwing a whole lot out. These are VERY bar-b-qy. So if thats what you like to taste these are for you. No need for the bacon because you cannot taste it at all. You don't taste steak sauce either so maybe increase it. All you taste is bar-b-q sauce.   I'll go back to my old way of stuffing mushrooms.

I was a bit skeptical about making these, and I have to say, they were a little strange. Definitely edible though. Nice for a change but not something I'd want again. Thanks anyway!

Aside from being super runny, the flavors just didn't go together with the mushroom for us.

Very easy to make, but I will not make them again.  I was not very impressed.
