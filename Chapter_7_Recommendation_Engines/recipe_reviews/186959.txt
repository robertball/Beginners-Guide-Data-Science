Not bad for such a quick and easy recipe.  I made a few preparation changes.  Instead of adding the ham and peas and milk to the pasta, I heated the milk in a seperate pan then melted the cheese in.  Then I stirred in my peas, ham and pasta.  The sauce was a bit bland for my tastes so I'll try jazzing it up a bit.  Also the pasta was somewhat dry, even with using a 12 oz package instead of a 16.  Needs a bit more sauce.

This is a great base for starting this type of meal.  I added: broccol, onions and minced garlic, sauted in pan, then added ham, peas and milk.  I also added 2/4 tsp dry ground mustard, next time I may double the mustard.  I didn't measure the milk or cheese, I eyeballed it.  I did add more than the milk called for for sure.  It was a bit too runny so I added about 1 tbsp flour and then added the pasta, so far so good, everyone likes it.  My 5 yr old said he liked it before he even tried it!

I substituted frozen peas for canned ones and it worked fine. I thought this recipe was good, although if you happened to get a scoop of just pasta without meat or peas the pasta tasted a bit bland. My husband really like it though.

This was somewhat bland as-is.  I do not think I'd make this again.  I ended up adding extra cheese for some more creaminess and extra garlic for added flavor.

I started by sauteing some chopped garlic in butter before adding the milk and remaining ingredients.  Used white cheddar and Parmesan cheeses.  When the sauce was done, I spooned it over the pasta.  I thought this was a good way to use the rest of a ham steak from the previous night's dinner, but my husband didn't agree.  Some people don't like ham and peas I guess!

A good base recipe, though I made a few changes.  To start, I used frozen peas and drained the pasta over them to thaw them out.  I then sauteed the ham in some butter before adding about three quarters of a can of evaporated milk and about a quarter cup of ranch dressing, though you can do it to taste.  Then I added a substantial handful of shredded sharp cheddar cheese, allowing time for it to melt before stirring in the peas and pasta.  A tasty, quick supper that I will probably make again!

I doubled the cheese and milk because it didnt seem to have enough 'sauce'. I found it a bit on the bland side and feel it really needed quite a few things added to bring up the taste. Even though I don't think I will be making this again, I didn't find it BAD, it just wasnt GREAT.

This wasnt so bad...I only used 1/2 box and halved pretty much everything except for the cheese, I kept that the same (I c. each for my updated servings) & it fed the four of us. This will def. be my "desperate times" kinda go to meal.

Not enough cheese for the amount of pasta.  I ended up using 2 cups of mozzerella and 2 cups of cheddar, plus I added more milk and 1 jar of alfredo sauce to make it creamy.

This is such a simple recipe that can adapt to anyone's 'doctoring' - I add cream cheese or yogurt with the milk.  I made this one time giving the dish a hearty Italian flavor.  I made this another time giving the dish a sweet flavor from various spices.  When you only have a few minutes for dinner due to kids schedules; and or are short on ingredients, give this recipe a try.

My family loved this!  It was quick and easy.  I used frozen peas instead of canned and just cooked them with the noodles.  I added a little extra milk and a few shakes of Season All to give it some more flavor.  A huge hit with my 5 & 6 year olds...and my hubby liked it too.

My kids loved this, but I found that the cheese all melted to the ham and created lumps of ham instead of a creamy sauce.  I'm not sure what I could have done differently.

Used basically same ingredients except different cheeses - some cream cheese, Monterey Jack and Italian blend.  Excellent suggestion to heat,  blend and mix the milk, cheeses, pepper and garlic powder.  I also lightly sautéed the ham to dry it out a tiny bit then added to milk mix and then finally into pasta/peas mix.  By heating milk etc, you have the opportunity add more cheese or milk to get a more saucy consistency,before mixing into the pasta so it won’t be dry or add more spice if desired. A nice simple recipe for a quick dinner.

This is a variation of the Italian recipes, typical of the Emilia Romagna region, but in the Italian one there's no mozzarella, Cheddar Cheese and garlic, only a little bit of Onion.

I followed this recipe most of the way... I used roasted turkey breast chunks instead of ham. Also I chopped up some garlic and added it to the milk mixture along with a little chicken broth to enhance flavor.   I added everything except for peas and turkey to milk mixture and melted the cheeses then added peas and turkey to avoid cheeses clumping.  also added about 3/4 tsp flour to help thicken.   It was SUPER good!!!!

Easy and fast. I needed to get rid of some deli meat so we tried this and loved it. We used more cheddar than mozzarella and added a tbs of butter. I added Cajun seasoning to mine and it was great.

The entire family (including 2 dogs) loved this recipe. It was super quick for me. I also added an extra can of peas which turned out very good for us. I continued to add milk to keep it creamy. Will most definitely make this again.

Good base recipe. I halved the recipe and used frozen peas.  Will definitely add more seasoning next time but my husband and 15 month old loved it!

Used this as a base to clean up vegetables that needed to be used.  Also added diced onion, frozen peas, mushrooms, fresh garlic, and a couple slices of cheddar cheese.  Sprinkled garlic herb seasoning on it as well.  Versatile recipe.

This was too dry for our family. Nobody liked it:( It's the first recipe from allrecipes.com that my family didn't like. Oh well! I gave it one star because I think I will take the leftovers and add Alfredo sauce. Perhaps that will give it the creaminess I was going for when I picked this recipe?

Based on others' reviews and comments, I altered the recipe and got great results!  I used a 12 oz. box of farfalle, 1 cup of milk, 8 oz. of cream cheese, 1 cup of shredded parmasan cheese, 1 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese, and I added onion.  While the farfalle was boiling, I sauteed finely chopped onion in a separate pan.  While the pasta was draining in a colander, I made the cheese sauce (milk, then cream cheese, then parmasan, then pepper and garlic powder, then mozzarella) over low heat in the emptied pasta pot.  To avoid the sauce thickening up too quickly and even becoming a bit STRINGY or rubbery, I recommend adding the MOZZARELLA LAST and stopping stirring the sauce BEFORE you think it is thick enough.  Return the drained pasta to the pot w/ the cheese sauce and stir in.  Each member of my family mixed their own distinct ratio of ham, onions, and peas into their bowls of creamy, cheesy farfalle.  Success! my husband, 8-year-old and I really liked it!

This is an easy recipe but it tastes just so-so. I followed a lot of the suggestions in the reviews. I only used a 12 oz package of farfalle pasta. I sauteed 1 small onion and 3 minced garlic cloves in a pan. I like sauce and I used 1 1/2 cups of milk, 1 1/2 cups of shredded Cheddar cheese and 1 cup of mozzarella cheese.  I warmed the milk and then added the cheese in a sauce pan before adding it to the noodles.   I also added a tsp of dry mustard.  But it still was dry and needed more sauce. I can't imagine if I had cooked 16 oz of pasta and only used 1/2 cup of milk how dry this dish would have been! The kids thought the meal was OK.
