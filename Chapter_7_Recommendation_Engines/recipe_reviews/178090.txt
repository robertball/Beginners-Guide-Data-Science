We had a recent diagnosis of diabetes in the family and after doing tons of googling, I found that bitter melon in the diet was consistently recommended.  So I tried out this recipe and my family liked it straight from the git-go.  The bitter melon took a little bit of getting used to, but if you can manage to find a riper one, it's less bitter...

Have to admit that I was afraid to eat this after reading on line that bitter melon tastes like Beyer asprin! I thought this soup was yummy though. The broth turns out to be a beautiful golden color, and the soup is very tasty.

I forgot to add.that my boyfriend has diabetes and struggles to get his blood sugars in check. He enjoyed this dish so much that he ate it for lunch and dinner for a couple of days when we ran out, and when he checked his sugars, that was the only time it ever goes to a normal count.
