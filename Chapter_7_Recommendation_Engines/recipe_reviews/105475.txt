I modified the recipe by using fresh cherries (picked by me, my son and grandma) that were frozen for storage reasons.  We made a straight cherry pie using Splenda and used the second pie crust completely across the pie instead of working harder making a lattice (we figured we worked hard enough picking the cherries and then pitting them).  It was wonderful!!!  We also made home-made no sugar added (Splenda instead) cherry vanilla ice cream.  Both were great!

Great Pie! Even the people who never eat anything with sweetners other than sugar loved it. I have been asked for the recipe by many.
