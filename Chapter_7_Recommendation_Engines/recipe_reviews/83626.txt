I found this recipe to be pretty good!  It was tasty and easy to prepare.  It definitely needs to be wrapped in your favorite taco/burrito shells though and add a touch of cheese (mont. jack, colby, or cheddar). Next time I'll use some salsa, lettuce, tomato and sour cream as well as other taco condiments!

This was really good comfort food.  I would definitely make this again.  I didn't have any peppers so I just used two onions.  I added some fresh cilantro a dash of chili power and a dash of red pepper flakes.  Thanks for the recipe.

Good hearty meal,went down well with family of five, I added some mixed spices to the beef while browning as some reviews said it was a bit bland and it gave a nice flavor, Ideal for a cold winters evening. comfort food.

A little bland. But not bad. I added some cumin and fresh cilantro, which made it a little better.

This was really good!  I used instant rice, so I cut the liquid down to 2 cups (used 2 bullion cubes to two cups water, instead of the broth) I also added about a half packet of taco seasoning to jazz it up.  I served it with tortillas, refried beans, lettuce and sour cream.  It was perfect.  My boyfriend really liked it.  Very filling and I have enough of the mix leftover so I'm going to try using it in a Mexican Shepard's pie. I would defiantly make this again.  Even my 10 month old loved it.

This is a really good basic dish.  I had to use red bell peppers since I didn't have any green ones, but otherwise everything was according to the recipe.  For us, it needed a bit more seasoning.  But, for those who prefer more toned down dishes, this is perfect.  We still greatly enjoyed it & will be making it, with revisions now & then, for years to come.

Very, Very good.  I will make again.  I precook ground beef, drain it and then freeze it.  I also buy green peppers on sale and dice then freeze them.  I used frozen beef and peppers in this dish and cut the prep time in half just by making that switch.  I also used leftover rice for this recipe.  I didn't use any monterey jack cheese... I only used 16 ounces of mozzarella.  The results were wonderful!   (I should also add that if you do use leftover rice for this recipe, only use about 3 cups and omit the beef broth and water.  Instead prepare beef boullion in about a 1/2 cup of water and mix into the pan then simmer a few minutes before topping with the cheese.)

Pretty good.  I served it in tortillas as burritos.

This turned out great! My family gobbled it up. I only made a few changes. I didn't have beef broth so I threw in a can of enchilada sauce and added a little extra water. I also left out the black pepper and added a small can of green chilies and added about a tsp. of cumin. We left off the mozz and mojack and used cheddar when we wrapped them in tortillas. Very good and very filling!!

Very bland, however very economical to make.  I made a few changes to enhance the flavor, added black beans and taco seasoning.  Even after that I had to add a fair amount of salt.  I will make this again with a few modifications.

Just made this tonight and it was wonderful! I used about a 1/3 bag of frozen corn instead of a can of corn and I also cut back on the cheese.  It was okay on a corn tortilla, but went wonderfully with tortilla chips! Definately will be making again.

I think this recipe calls for a little too much cheese.  I only put between a half and two thirds on and it was excellent.

I made the recipe exactly the way it was written.  It needed more salt and pepper and there was nothing to jump for joy about this recipe.  Seemed to be a lot of cheese too.

Made almost exactly as is minus the tomatoes which I did not have on hand. I think that would have taken it to 5+!  Served on tortillas with sour cream and cheese sprinkled atop instead of stirred in. Very, very tasty.

Used can fire roasted tomatoes, seasoned the meat and added extra garlic.  Came out really good.  Also used turkey meat.

This is great! I put in chopped spinach instead of bell peppers and my can of diced tomatoes had basil and oregano in it ('cause this is what I had on hand). Served it with tortilla chips. It was a family hit!!!
