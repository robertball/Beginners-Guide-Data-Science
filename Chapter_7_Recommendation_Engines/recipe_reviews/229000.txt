Tasty, tender, and gone off every ones dinner plate. This is a keeper for me. Easy to make and so full of flavor. I have made this many times since I wrote this review and find that fresh Brussels sprout and a low sodium chicken or vegetable broth works just as well.06/05/14

The flavors of this recipe was great, however I did find the sauce a bit runny! Even tho you drain the brussel sprouts they still hold water!

Thanks for posting this! I recently had a brussels sprouts appetizer at Cafe Melissa's in Avon Lake, OH. I came home to look for a similar recipe and luckily found yours! Prior to this weekend, I avoided brussels sprouts, but I am a new convert! I think the Asian flavors work well with the cabbage flavor of the sprouts.

I made this last night with a few revisions. It was OUTSTANDING! I cut theBrussels Sprouts in half and roasted them with a little olive oil at 450 for about 15 minutes to give them a nice roasted flavor. Then I combined them with the bacon, onion, pine nuts and cut the soya sauce and honey in half. I will make this again.

I used half honey, half maple syrup, skipped the pine nuts and raisin. I let the Brussel sprouts simmer for ten minutes and they turned out delicious!

Instead of boiling, I roasted these with olive oil after cutting the ends off and halving them, no bouillon used. Followed the recipe for everything else and they came out amazing. A little bit of Sriracha at the end gives it the perfect kick.

I made mine vegan friendly. I used fresh brussels sprouts and steamed them in vegetable broth.   I used olive oil instead of bacon drippings and added 3 cloves of garlic. I'm not a fan of brussels sprouts at all. I made it for my daughter who is vegan and she gave it 5 stars. Next time I think I'll add fresh ginger.

I made some variations to this dish to accommodate what I had on hand. I look forward to making the dish as written though because I'm sure it'll be even better.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit! The only difference was that I used fresh brussel sprouts and steamed them. It was delicious and easy and everyone loved it.

A good recipe for people who don't care for Brussel's sprouts I thought, because this recipe covers up their taste pretty well.  I do like them, however, so not my favorite.

Delicious! I roasted the brussel sprout halves with olive oil in the oven at 450Â° for 6 mins. I also added a couple cloves minced garlic in with the onion. Kept everything else the same. Great recipe!

Very tasty. I had to substitute pumpkin seeds for the pine nuts and Craisins for the raisins. But otherwise everything turned out great .

Left out the raisins, pine nuts, and sesame seeds and it was all still so amazing.  I may try roasting the sprouts in the future just as a textural preference, but still absolutely amazing flavor.

These are awesome! I will be making this often.  The only thing I did differently was I sliced the brussel sprouts and steamed them. Also I didn't have pine nuts but still probably one of the best brussel sprout recipes I've made.

A recipe with potential. It was too sweet. Can hardly taste the sprouts. I added garlic salt and sesame oil.  Not sure if I'll  make it again, since I  like Brussels  sprouts with butter and salt and pepper.

GOOD I made as directed. EASY  but not pretty.
The soy sauce makes it go black. If you reheat 
left overs it really goes  black. That ruins it for me.

I made this for Christmas dinner 2015 and it was a huge hit. I was very surprised at how good this was. I tripled the recipe and it turned out wonderful. The only change I made was I roasted the sprouts in the oven so they would stay crunchy in the mixture. This will be made every year!

Just made this tonight for the first time and the family wants to make this a "keeper". I did not boil the sprouts first, I read somewhere that this cooking method really toughing them up. Followed the recipe otherwise with everything went into one fry pan. Delicious!

I used fresh sprouts (halved), pancetta and added a few baby bella caps.  Turned out pretty good.  I will make it again.

As I was putting the platter down in front of my boyfriend I snagged a brussel sprout and popped it into my mouth. "oh man," I told my boyfriend, "Best  brussel sprouts you'll ever taste." He stuck a fork in one and popped it into his mouth. "Holy hell," he said, "Best  brussel  sprout I ever put in my mouth!"

Took out the bacon and definitely used pine nuts and raisins. Instead of cooking onion in bacon fat, I used coconut oil and salt. One of my husband's favorite dishes of all time.

This is an excellent recipe. Very easy and quick. It sounds like it should be for a special dinner only when you first read through it, but I will be making this often. My family, including grandkids aged 4-20 raved about it.

This was a quick weekly dish with nice flavours.  I did modify it to our tastes. Used maple syrup and chilli, added spinach and asparagus.   Omitted the honey, raisins bacon and pine nuts.  Next time I am going to add some chicken pieces.

Good mix of sweet and salty. I use low sodium soy sauce, but there's still bacon in there (I even used less.) Very good, will be making again.
