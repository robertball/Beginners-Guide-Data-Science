I didn't have vanilla paste so I used a dash of vanilla extract instead.  This was a simple, delicious truffle recipe!

I did add the butter that was listed as optional.  Subbed a dash of pure vanilla extract for the vanilla bean paste as I've never had any other recipe call for that.  Next time I will try grinding the coconut flakes before rolling the truffles.  I think I would enjoy a more fine finish and it would look more decadent.

these are utterly delicious. I made them when I had a sever chocolate craving, and one of the best recipe finds I made yet. I only had enough peanut butter for a half a recipe and cannot wait to make a full recipe. It did take longer to 15 minutes in the fridge to be able to firm the balls, but who cares, they are phenomenal

These tasted great, once I made them correctly. I ruined a whole batch before I had success. I only made half a batch, and it overcooked at 5 minutes. The 2nd time I stopped at 4 minutes.

These are absolutely amazing!!  I substituted the coconut oil with canola oil, and used Special dark cocoa...really tasty.
