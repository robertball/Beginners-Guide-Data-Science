Great salad with a delicious combination of textures and flavors giving it a nice "Meditteranean" flair!  I wasn't able to find "Spinach and Feta" chicken sausage so I opted for the "Roasted Garlic" version by al fresco instead. I used cherry tomatoes and drizzled some "Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House dressing" from this site over top.  I never thought sausage in a garden salad would be so good!

I didn't have all the ingredients so I used what I had to make a salad, I did have and liked a lot the spinach&Feta chicken sausage.Even with out all the right ingredients my salad had a very Greek flair.

this is without a doubt a new favorite.  we had to substitute al fresco sweet italian as the spinach and feta wasn't available.  we also made our own greek dressing (a simple affair with olive oil, red wine vinegar, oregano, garlic, and sea salt/fresh cracked pepper).  a summer repeat, and repeat, and repeat...

Hubby and I both said the same thing - sausage in salad? Who knew!  It turned out delicious! I used a different flavor sausage and cooked them on the outdoor grill. Yum!  I also made my own dressing with olive oil, lime juice and oregano. A perfect summertime meal!

Great salad with an extra kick of taste! I left out the olives since we don't like them but included everything else, even the spinach feta chicken sausage! This made for an easy and light dinner on a warm evening like today.

This is really good! Very easy meal for your extra/left over sausage during summer! I hate to sub but romaine lettuce works with this too!

Knowing sausage isn't my thing (and Jalapeno is the only Al Fresco variety I have available in my area), I chose to dice the sausage for my salad to help hide it (I left Mr. LTH's as called for).  Diced and hidden, I didn't mind the addition of sausage to my salad (though, I still think it's a bit weird, right?).  Mr. LTH happily ate his. I made "Creamy Greek Dressing" from AR to dress our salads.  No olives for us because neither of us is a fan.

I love the sausages but in a salad this did nothing for me, just a personal preference

First time, my family and I have eaten a sausage salad.  I am a huge fan of feta so added a few pieces of feta to the side salad.  The salad was enjoyable, but not really sure the sausage work well with this. I don't think this is anything I will be making again.

This was an easy salad to put together.  I did cut back on the amount of sausage I used, only because it was not a main dish for us.  I didn't have kalamata olives, but green pimiento-stuffed olives are a good replacement.  Thanks, al fresco!

I am a Greek salad FANATIC and I loved the twist of adding sausage. I couldn't find the Greek (darn) but used the sundried tomato and it was a nice substitute. This was a quick, healthy, low cal lunch, and it was even tasty with just vinegar (which is how I prefer my salads).

This is a great dinner salad. I'll use this recipe again on those nights when I want something filling and super easy. At first, I was concerned about there being too many strong flavors, but they all complimented each other nicely.

Loved all the Mediterranean flavor in this salad.   I've never thought of using sausage in a salad but this spinach & feta chicken sausage was lean and full of flavor.  I forgot to pick up Greek salad dressing so we used Ranch and it was still 5 stars.

This salad was really easy to put together and was very good!   I made it exactly as the recipe stated with the exception of using black olives instead of kalamata.  I am sure the kalamata would be even better, but, the black olives were more economical.  Easy weeknight light meal.

This was very good! I couldn't find the al fresco brand chicken sausages, so I used the store brand and that worked out fine. I make 'Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing' from here for the dressing, and that was a perfect match! I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I really loved this salad, and it even went over well with the kids!  We had the leftovers the next day, and the sausage was great cold too!

Loved this light and tangy salad.  I let everyone add the toppings as desired.  Also I recommend slicing the olives or everyone will be fighting over the 6 olives.   A great summer recipe and the sausage adds a great flavor to the salad.

Didn't care for the sausage in this. Once I picked it out the salad was fine.
