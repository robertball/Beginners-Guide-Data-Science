In case someone is overwhelmed with the Goya products list in this recipe, it is perfectly fine to use ANY olive oil, ANY tomato sauce, ANY spanish olives, fresh garlic, dried oregano, etc. The only Goya products you would probably need are the  Sazon, the sofrito (unless you make your own, there's a good recipe for it here) and the discos (which is the premade dough that comes ready, frozen in round shape and in packs of 10). Yes, you can make your own dough but I like Goya discos, they are good, convenient and cheap. I added some adobo Goya (not the chipotle sauce but the powdered adobo which is a blend of spices like garlic powder, salt, cumin, etc) because I found the picadillo a tad bland. To make these appetizer size I cut each round of dough in two semicircles, filled, folded and sealed edges with a fork. You can freeze these before frying, then fry when needed without having to thaw it. My son loves them filled with pizza sauce, mozarella cheese and pepperoni. We call them "empanadillas de pizza", or "pastelillos de pizza". You can fill them with just cheddar cheese, or with guava paste, cooked shredded chicken... well, whatever you are into. Just make sure you don't burn yourself, the filling is very hot and if you don't seal them right they might leak on you and OUCH!

Excellent. I used the biscuit dough that comes in the cylinders in the dairy section (next to the cheese and butter) because I wanted flaky empanadas. I baked them and they tasted soooo delicious!

OMG ... my new favorite!  Out of necessity (not rebellion), I had to change a couple things.  First of all, I double the recipe because I have a big family.  Next, I only had ground turkey meat (20 oz) so I used that instead of the ground beef.  Next I couldn't find the Goya Discos to save my life so I finally settled for pie crust sheets.  So because of that I baked these at 425 degrees F for about 20-30 minutes.  The whole batch made 20 medium turnorvers.  I served these with the Mango Salsa (also on this site) and my family went nuts over these and dovoured almost the whole batch.  I kept eating the filling ... so savory and flavorful.  I did season the meat with garlic salt and pepper and also added a bit more sofrito, but other than that I followed the measurements (doubling of course) and this recipe is a keeper.  Thanks so much for this.  My mom was Puerto Rican from Hawaii and she used to make these all the time but she died with the recipe.  It brought back great memories.

This was my first attempt at making empanadas, they turned out great.  Loved this filling, and assembling was fun and easy, just don't be in a rush when you prepare this recipe!  I baked these at 400* for 30 minutes, just a bit too crunchy, I'll lower the heat to 375* next time and bake only 25 minutes.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Goya!  Love your products and your recipes are always spot-on.

Wow, just like mom's! These really are fabulous. If made true to the recipe, they are wonderful. My mother always added a couple of small dashes of cinnamon, yes, cinnamon, to the picadillo (which I, of course, had to do), and it makes such a lovely addition. Either way, though I do recommend trying a dash or two of cinnamon, these are a winner!!

This recipe is on point. 
I'm not one to measure ingredients, I normally eye-ball it, but this recipe is easy and delicious!!!!!
The time consuming part is letting the pastry dough completely thaw out.  
One thing I would add is to add some cheese (cheddar or mozzarella) then your adding the beef to the center of the empanada. It gives it just the right amount of umpf'! lol ... Oh yeah, If you don't have oregeno, using regular bottle of italian seasoning works just as well.... 
Happy eating and thanks for posting this recipe on here... I LOVE IT!

Dee. Lish. Us. I followed the instructions for the meat as written, and it was soooo tasty. I made a slight tweak as an alternative to frying the empanadas. Instead of deep frying, lightly brush them with olive oil and bake them in the oven on 350 for about 12 to 15 minutes (or until the nice brown color appears). Both ways are delicious. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Really great recipe.  I thought it was missing a little heat so I added cayenne pepper and a few splashes of balsamic vinegar.  I also used refrigerated pie crust with a 4-in cookie cutter.  The crust was flaky and the filling was so delicious.

Perfect recipe (with some spanish olive juice added to meat)! This recipe taste closest to my mothers'... I've been looking for something this familiar since I was 9 years old! That's 20+ years... Thank you for posting... My search is over... :)

I wish I could give these more stars, because I absolutely would! I have never made anything like this before, but it intrigued me, so I took a chance and gave it a try...I am so glad that I did (and so is hubby and the little guy, lol). These were absolutely FANTASTIC and so simple to make! The only Goya products I used were the Discos (I could only find the achiote ones, which I was unsure of, but they were great), the Sofrito and the Sazon. I fried these up in my deep fryer, and they cooked up perfectly. I really cannot believe how good these were and how big of a hit they were with my family. I got 8, and I froze the leftovers (already cooked) for another time, so we'll see how that goes. I will definately make these again, anytime~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This recipe is actually good. I used Goya Ground Beef and Goya Yellow Onion instead, and it perfectly works too.

I tried this recipe basically to give the empanada dough a try. I did not add alot of the seasoning because it was just too much salt.  I used the Adobo only and I BAKED them instead of submerging them in all that oil.  They were crispy with just a swipe of olive oil and were awesome.

This five star rating is for the meat mixture.  The frozen Goya discos, sadly, were not to be found in our area.  I wanted to try the meat mixture first before ambitiously tackling the pastry aspect, so I used the meat mixture in enchiladas.  The sofrito and sazon were also not to be found but was able to get them from Amazon with free shipping and I'm glad I did.  Next time I'll tackle the pastry part with alternate helpful suggestions from other reviewers.  Now I'm inspired to try other recipes using sazon and sofrito.

My husband really enjoys this recipe.  I made it as is, which is great, then upon my husbands request added peas and carrots instead of olives.  We had them once like that at a Dominican place, and have never found them like that again.  I go heavy on the sofrito.  I make them and freeze them so they are always available for him to cook up.

Love these!  I made extra meat filling the first time and froze.  Now today I have another package of Goya discos and the defrosted meat.  Making munchies for the March Madness game.  Go Zags!  Will add cilantro, cinnamon and nutmeg to this batch.  Sounds good!  I also bake at 350 for about 30 minutes instead of frying.

These were very good. I followed the recipe exactly as it's written, and I was not disappointed. The only reason that I'm giving this recipe 4 stars instead of 5 is that the recipe takes so long to make. Maybe I'm just a slow cook, but I felt like these took forever to finish. It's also not the type of meal that you can walk away from at any point during the process, so you really can expect to be cooking for at least an hour and a half....not to mention clean up time. They were really fun to make, but they aren't an ideal meal for someone with a busy schedule.

I'm new at making empanadas but love this recipe.  How could you go wrong with Goya.  I used the discos, sofrito, sazon and the tomato sauce. Their products are very well made and not salty.  This was an excellent recipe and very easy to follow. Everything was perfect for a Sunday football afternoon dinner. I made the empanadas along with the Goya rice with black beans mix and Progresso cheesy enchilada soup. I also served nacho chips with salsa and chipotle baha dip with two different types of mexican beer.  It was a fun, delicious meal on a very cold day. My family loved it. The only thing I might change would be to use the smaller discos.  I used the larger ones and we cut them in half as they were easier to eat.  I doubled the recipe and made a big batch and unfortunately I only have three leftover.  The next time I will definitely make more to freeze for another meal.

Why bother using olive oil when the hamburger creates enough oils to soften the onion? I don't add olives because we don't care for them but followed the directions exactly otherwise and it makes great empanadas. I also use lard for frying since it has the best flavor and doesnt burn as easily as corn or vegetable oil.

These were great, and so easy! 

THe only thing that I wish I had done differently was melted a little cheese on top and/or had some kind of dipping sauce - sour cream or something. 

Great recipe!

Will definitely make again. I substituted basil for oregano an added pepper sauce instead of black pepper. Also added a teaspoon of brown sugar. The pastry was perfect.

Great recipe!  I have been using this recipe for a while and my family loves them.  When it comes to empanandas you could do pretty much anything.  I even used leftovers like baked macaroni and cheese , spaghetti etc and filled the empanada discs and fry them up and it becomes a great lunch or snack that my kids go ga-ga over.   Empanadas are the best go to quick meal with pretty much whatever you got.

My family can't get enough of these delicious turnovers. I use 2 Tbsp filling for the smaller disc and  double the recipe, for 20  empanadas. I make ahead and freeze, using the same wax paper it comes with to separate them. This makes it easy to grab only a few to fry up whenever you want. I follow the recipe precisely and they are perfect every time.

I made these just as the recipe is written, except I used premade pie crust as I couldn't find the discos anywhere local. They were a hit with my picky family. I think they could benefit from being made with shredded beef, so I'll try that next time, but as written, this recipe was delicious.

We thoroughly enjoyed these. I omitted the olive oil (as someone else said, the beef makes plenty), I drained that off the meat after it was cooked and before adding the onions (the recipe didn't say to but I couldn't see myself cooking with that still in there) and I omitted the olives as none of us eat them. They had a great flavor but it was missing something. Next time I'll add some cayenne pepper and cheddar cheese. Also, we couldn't find the discos anywhere around here. I used pie crust dough instead, which made them flaky and delicious. Thanks for a keeper, Goya!

I omitted the olives since I didn't want all the salt.  I minced the onion really fine since I was feeding a couple of guys who will freak out if they see an onion! I couldn't help but add a little white cheese (I used monterey jack) If I make it again, I will add the olives and keep the onion in larger chunks for me because I think the texture would be better if prepared as the recipe is originally written.  I loved the addition of the shredded cheese though.  As for the Discos, I couldn't find them at the grocer so used regular pastry dough that I made.

This is an excellent recipe! My family loved them! I chose to make my own dough, since my grocery store did not carry the frozen Goya kind. That wasn't too hard at all, and there are many to choose from online. Fantastic recipe and highly recommended!

Northeast meat & potato palate finally transforms to the South Florida corridor cuisine.  Latin American flair has put old, homegrown recipes to sleep. This was fantastically easy (as the ingredients are in every local store).  Will adjust the flavoring over time but this was a homerun with the family. You know its good when they say they are full, but reaching for thirds.

Excellent recipe.  We made a bunch of these.  One third was baked at 425 for 20 minutes, the other were fried.  I wouldn't bother baking.  They taste like two different recipes.  The fried were above and beyond better.  We will make this again,

This is the same basic empanada recipe Ive been using for years. The Goya sazon, sofrito, and the discos (if you dont feel like making your own dough) are a must. The only thing I do differently is add more of the olives and a little of their juice (I love the green olive taste) and I add in fresh chopped cilantro.  When I think of empanadas this recipe is what I think of. 
Also, you can use this exact same recipe to make chicken or tuna empanadas. Years ago when I had a house full of kids we actually used to make 20 of each (beef, chicken, and tuna) and it would last us for 2+ days.

Made these last night with my 14yr old as a snack. I didn’t have tomato sauce so I improvised with diced tomatoes. I honestly didn’t use this recipe but free styled it...found this recipe this morning and it’s very close to how we did ours. I plan to do this again soon because it was so much fun and yummy. Want to try different fillings, and I’ll get more disks, we ran out lol!

These were fantastic!  I followed the recipe to a T and they looked and tasted so good.  I did use my fry baby to fry them as I don't like to fry food indoors.   My hubby really liked these and said it looked like a professional made them.  I will make these again.

Was easy to make. I would not leave out any of the goya ingredients. The ingredients cooked together makes a very tasty filling.  They were gone as soon as they were made.

These things were awesome! Followed the recipe exactly. The wife loved them also. I made extras and froze them for later. Will definitely make again! Only change I might make is add a chopped hot pepper to the meat.

I have made this recipe three times.  It also works well with ground turkey for a change from beef.  They freeze well too.  My boys love to heat them up after school and eat them before heading off to practice.

Oh my goodness! I have made these three times in the past month. I fried them twice and baked them once. Either way, I cannot seem to make enough. I make 20 each time and they disappear like loose $100 bills. I prefer to bake them, they brown up nicely without the mess. To bake them I use an egg wash on the outside before they go in the oven. Thanks so much for this recipe.

I just made these yesterday and they were delicious! I doubled the recipe because I wanted to make dinner sized patties instead of appetizers. I also used 1/2 lb of ground beef and 1/2 pound of spicy sausage as well as fresh crushed garlic and about 18 olives instead of the suggested amount.

I thought it was over seasoned but my teenage kids liked it.  It also gave us some ideas on other ingredients we could put inside.  The Goya Discos were really good.

Didn’t have the Goya products so I substituted with similar items. I also used rolled pastry. My discs were about 5” in diameter and with a good dollop of mixture I deep fried them. About 3/4 minutes at 375 degrees and the Empanadas turned out great. I made about 15 of these and all were gone in short order. A great half time snack. Recommend trying and mixing your favorite ingredients. I love japalenos  but wasn’t allowed to add them to the mixture.  Maybe next time??.

Absolutely delicious. I can only find this empanadas dough at Target though. When I make them, I bake instead of deep frying. 350 degrees for 20 minutes. If I don't want to eat all right away, they freeze well. Freeze after putting empanadas together. I just put them in freezer bags and eat within a month. No need to defrost. Just put them on a baking sheet 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes. Yummmm.

The flavor was SO good!! I didn't even use the ingredients exactly as listed. I subbed a few of the ingredients with homemade versions (sofrito and dough for the discs I make from scratch), and also used Hunts tomato sauce instead of Goya. I actually subbed a few other brands for the Goya brand. It's the same ingredients, just different brands. Well, all that to see, the combination of flavors is delicious!!!

Very delicious!! I am making these for our block party and know they will be favorites! Definitely buy the Goya Discos.  They are perfect, easy to use and save lots of time.  This will easily become a family favorite.

Since I did not have the package of recommended seasoning, I used ground coriander only with the oregano. I used only sofrito sauce as we are huge fans at our home, and I did not have tomato sauce. I added left over of cooked Spanish rice (about 1 cup) to the filling. My family loved it and I will definitely make this dish again. Thank you for sharing!

Addicted to these meat pies!!  Only thing different was, I used rhodes frozen rolls and rolled them out after defrosting for 4 hours. Baked at 400° oven for 12 - 18 min. Depending on size with egg wash on top they are perfectly browned.  We LOVE THESE!! Thanks to all the empanada recipes I read!! 10 stars

I love this recipe!!! I've made it MANY times and always get compliments.  I was making it exactly as written, frying the discos which is great, but recently started making it with puff pastry and baking it and we like it even more.   It's a bit lighter and a lot less mess when making it! Either way you make it, the filling has so much flavor - you can't go wrong!

It’s a great recipe! I just added green, red, yellow and Orange Minced peppers,  homemade sofrito and  Red, Yellow and Green Onions to the recipe as well. Absolutely Delicious! I haven’t made empanadas in years.

Really delicious.  I couldn't find the discos, so I used rolled pie crust.  Of course this made them more unhealthy than they already were, but gosh darn they were good.  

I didn't have olives, so I omitted them - probably would have been even better with.

Delicious. Would do again though I'll probably use it as a base recipe and experiment to see what I like best.

Outstanding!  I doubled the recipe hoping for leftovers, but these went right away. Very easy to make, although somewhat time consuming. Definitely worth the time and effort.
