My husband Chuck-Tony says it's easily an all-time household favorite.  Even tasttier, he says, with Tabasco mixed in.  Great on top of steamed white rice!  ;-)

Very good. We made it without the onion and it still had plenty of onion flavor from the onion soup. The chicken and shrimp could have used a little seasoning. Next time I will saute the meats separately and spice them up a little. It would be very good with roasted red potatoes as a side or in the recipe even.

I was a little apprehensive about making this, I wasn't sure how the onion soup mix "gravy" would end up tasting, but my hubby and I both ended up really liking it!  I left out the celery, chilis and green pepper, and added some fresh sliced mushrooms. I seasoned it with a cajun spice blend.  I would suggest not adding the shrimp until about 15 minutes from the end of cooking time - they cook up quickly. Thanks for the recipe!

As someone who loves cajun food, this was awesome to me.  I loved it.  It had just the right heat but then.......the cayenne and red pepper were "to taste"........my taste :) I used andouille instead of kielbasa.  I also spiced up my shrimp as I cooked it and likewise with the chicken.  As for the gravy,I didnt think it needed anything else but I had cayenne and red pepper in it already along with the salt and pepper.  Great one. Thank you!

This was very good.  I left out the sausage since I don't eat sausage, and added jalapenos.  I also added some thick sliced bacon, cooked and crumbled to make up for the sausage.  It was really yummy!

My family loved this recipe. I added canned diced jalapenos (hot) and served it over Zatarain's New Orleans Rice Mix. My teenagers wrapped the rice and cajun mixture in flour tortillas the next day and said it was 'the bomb!'  Thanks!!

I was skeptical about this recipe because of the onion soup mix but it's wonderful.  My only complaint is about the gravy, 1 tbsp of butter is not enough to cook the flour in.  I had to use a few tablespoons and a little oil to have enough.  You might want to rough chop the veggies, I think I might have chopped mine a little too fine and they practically disappeared.  Next time I think I'll just slice the onion and bell pepper.

Yum this was a great tasting recipe.  I was making this for the family....small children included so I left out the hot stuff and added Franks at the table.  The flavor was great.  I was like suemck not sure how the onion soup mix would work into it.  I did not have zucchini, which I wish I did.  But I did add some mushrooms and I went heavy on the peppers.  This was great for dinner over a bit of brown rice....but even better the next day for lunch.  Thanks Nicole!

Terrible.  Too thick, onion flavor was overpowering, flour made it a thick sludge.  Will never try again.

This is a great recipe, but to make this recipe simpler I bought Tony Cachere's Jambalaya rice mix. Then cooked my peppers, onions,turkey sausage(in place of kielbasa), and  shrimp. I found doing it this was you can make this dish in under 30-35 minutes. Plus, my hysbandwho always gets this dish if we eat at this certain restaurant said he coudln't tell the difference!

I love this recipe, and my family and friends love this dish.  They love it so much that I must double everything and make a pot of it instead of a skillet!

The original recipe was a little bland for our taste.  The "gravy" required a lot of additional spices added to it for our liking.  (cajun seasoning, cumin, Red Hot, etc) I also seasoned my chicken with the cajun seasoning and used a pound of crawfish tails instead of the shrimp.  The end result ended up being delicious!

This recipe was good, but it required a few modifications to make it work. I kept all the ingredients the same, but when I got to the gravy part, I found I needed to add double the butter to be able to mix the flour without it sticking to the pan and then when I added the onion mix and water, it was a thick mess, so again, much more water was needed, which I think watered everything down.

Heavy, hearty meal, great for eating after a long day day out in the cold.  I cooked just as the chef said and liked it just fine.  As some have said you could use a different sausage if you prefer and I believe it would meet your expectations if you like heavy thick meals.  As for heat, that's up to you.  Add more pepper flakes and cayenne, you have more heat.  My kids put Red Hot on theirs and loved it.  Not something I'll eat everyday, but I will surely save this one to do again.

Absolutely loved it. Of course, I did my own thing with the Rue but it turned out perfectly and is now and will be one of my favorite dishes to make, eat and serve. It tasted so good, I wanted to slap my self :- )

Its great if you don't follow the recipe exactly. That is why I gave it three stars. It has a lot of potentional. First there is no way you can make a proper rue with 1 tbs buter and a half cup of flower. you should use equal parts butter and flour and you can use a little oil as well. I used three tablespoons butter, 1 tablespoon oil, and 4 tablespoons flour. The next problem I encountered was the onion soup mix made the onion flavor way over powering. I ended up thining it with a lot of warm water and then seasoning it with creole seasoning, and a few other seasonings I had on had to make up for the watering down. In the end it turned out fantastic. I served it over rice!

This recipe can be summed up in one word, AWESOME!  I am a huge fan of Cajun food and this is the ultimate comfort Cajun.  As long as you like all of the ingredients use them it is wonderful.  I have never been any good at making a roux but I have made this so much that I am now an expert at it.  Made this for my in-laws who live in Louisiana and are awesome Creole cooks and they both loved it.  Give this a shot, you will not be disappointed.  I have been using this recipe for a long time and I thank you so much for sharing.

We really like this.  I used frozen gumbo mix vegetables instead of zucchini and some of the peppers.   I was worried it would be too salty with the onion soup mix, but the gravy was perfect.  I'll definitely be making this again.

This was excellent.  I found that all the meats could be precooked.  Pre-cooked sausage (like using Hillshire Farms sausage), precooked shrimp, and cooking the chicken ahead of time all wouldn't have affected this recipe.  But, I enjoyed this over rice, and it was spectacular.  Will make it again.

I made this dish using chicken, jumbo shrimp, and scallops.  Great dish, Great spice, even my roommate ate it and he hates seafood....so we must be doing something right! I Will definately without a doubt make this dish again when I'm in the mood for a spicy entree.
