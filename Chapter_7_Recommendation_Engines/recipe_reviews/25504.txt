This dip was a huge hit at my last tailgate party. Everyone wanted the recipe! I added diced red pepper and black eyed peas and also used red onion instead of white. Very easy and quick to prepare. Thanks!!!!

I make this recipe all the time and no one ever gets tired of it! The first time I made it, it was too runny. So, I reduced the italian dressing to 1/4 cup and the ranch to 1/2 cup. Turned out perfect! Highly recommended!

This is a very good recipe, it's unusual, and definitely a winner!  I did alter the recipe a little and took the advice of some other reviewers and added a touch of sour cream - definitely gave it alot of body and fullness to the flavor.  I used Kens' lite ranch which was really good, and not as heavy tasting as the regular ranch.  I added some taco hot sauce, some green peppers, canned mexicorn, some cheese, and I also used a zesty italian dressing for a kick.  Additionally I used some cajun seasoning for a bit of warmth and alot of seasonings.  It was very funky tasting, and it is now on my husbands list of favorite dips....oh, and try eating this with ritz crackers - I think it's better than tortilla chips!

As far as cold and quick dips go, this is one of the best! I first made it for a Christmas party (and I think corn chips are the perfect thing to serve this with, by the way) and had several people ask me for the recipe and even more gush about it the next day. This is nothing fancy, but for a potluck or picnic or casual gathering, it's my new staple. Easy and delicious.

I served this with corn chips as part of my "Super Bowl Spread" and the guys devoured every last corn kernel!!  The only alterations I followed were to use a package of frozen Baby white corn mixed w/some frozen yellow corn instead of canned (thawed in the micro, of course), as well as to add some chopped green and red bell peppers.  I left the concoction in the fridge overnight so the taste medley could be perfected and it was excellent!!!

I have made this twice now for social gatherings - one backyard bar-b-que and 1 famly get-together. It was literally the first thing gone.  It is a MUST that you make it the night before or at least let it sit in the fridge for 8 hours.  It makes all the difference. I also have added an avacado both times and think that that really adds to the flavor. I also add a couple of spoonfuls of sour cream like someone else suggested, some diced pickled jalepenos, and cut back just a little on the dressings. Last time I served it with Red hot roasted pita chips (pitas cut into wedges, sprinkled with spicy spices and toasted in the oven). Can't count the number of people that have asked for this recipe - it's a keeper!

This is fabulous and oh so tasty.  My guests were apprehensive when just looking at the dip, but after a few bites, they were addicted (and I was too).  This can be eaten as a salad too.  In fact, I found myself sneaking bites right out of the bowl.  I used Ken's light Olive Oil Vinagrette (very yummy dressing) and Kraft light ranch dressing.  I'm making this for a luncheon tomorrow, can't wait to try it again!

This was excellent! With all this flavor (and lowfat). Do not let the way it looks fool you. Your guests will be asking you for this recipe:)

i almost didn't make this recipe because so many people said how "unappealing" it looks.  if you just add a few more things with some color, it's beautiful!  i diced up a tomato, half of a green pepper, and put in a red onion instead of a white one and it not only tastes good, but it looks appetizing too!  

good call on halving the dressing.  i think all of it would have been too much.

Don't pass this one up.  I made a double recipe yesterday for 8 adults and it just disappeared!  It's different and surprisingly light and will not be one of my standard party dishes.  I used dried cilantro and do not recommend this; next time I'll use fresh.  Still it was great.  Thanks, Jolene.

I made this recipe for a pre-dinner appetizer for my guests as we lounged on the deck.  I knew this was a great recipe when one of the guests kept sneaking into the container while it chilled in the refrigerator.

I did not find it watery at all, but found that using a very thick Italian dressing helped the consistency greatly.  

I thought about adding some sour cream, but did not have any on hand.  Maybe next time.

I also halfed the recipe, which was more than enough for a gathering of 8 people.

Very Good!  I made it yesterday to bring to work today, and it was just as the description read...not so pleasant to look at, but several people told me they just had to keep going back for more!  I couldn't find white corn, so I used "Mexicorn" with red and green peppers and it came out great!

Delicious!  I followed the advice of one reviewer and decreased both dressings- 1/4 cup Italian and 1/2 cup Ranch.  It turned out wonderfully without an overall strong Ranch taste.  I also added an avocado and a red pepper.  This was eaten up quickly at a little party and my friends just raved about it.  They were trying to guess the ingredient that made it kinda creamy.  When all flavors mingle together, it is awesome!  Will definitely make again!

Every time I make this dip, everyone asks me for the recipe. I hate cilantro, so I leave that out, and I usually omit the onion as well. The first time I made it, I expected the ranch/italian combination to taste a bit strange, but it turned out amazing! It's also good if you put in some different kinds of beans like kidney or garbanzo. I sometimes add celery as well to give it a crunch since I don't use onions.

I took this to a football party. This recipe has a good flavor, but because of the way it looks, few people would try it. That's why I only gave it 3 stars. Might be better for a more adventurous crowd.

I made this last night and although the taste was good....I can not say that I would make it again. Neither my son or husband cared for it too much. I halfed the recipe and it was still way too much for us. I am just glad that I did not decide to make this for any kind of get together as I can not imagine that it would have done too well.

The recipe is fantastic for football parties and tailgating!  My husband has been bugging me for weeks - reminding me to make this recipe for our first party of the season.  I find it works very well with low-fat dressings, but we love to eat it with Fritos Scoops - so much for low fat!  A winner - thanks Jolene!!

I didn't care for this recipe. Other people seemed to enjoy it, but I thought it was a bit watery. I will try adding sour cream or something extra next time.

One of the girls in the office brought this in for our holiday party. The Italian and Ranch Dressing mix sounded a little weird, but it tastes great. It was so good we all asked for the recipe. You can go wrong with black beans and corn.

sorry, but this was JUST GROSS~ for the "semi-homeade" type of cook! I had to wash the dressing off the whole thing in a colander in the sink it tasted SO bad! then i added some olive oil, lime juice, cumin, fresh garlic and chili powder to the remaining ingredients, before serving it. I also added two chopped tomatoes for  some color.  that saved the day, and my pride cause i was taking it to a party!

VERY GOOD. I took the advice of others and used 1/4 C Italian and 1/2 Cup ranch- I halved the hot sauce and cayenne (figured I could add more later) and it tasted great. Used red onion and I thought this was a very good dip.  I have a TON left so I think I will roll them up in tortillas and bake with some red sauce and queso; YUMMMM.

Wow - this is one amazing dip.  I have made it more times than I can count in the three months since finding the recipe.  It is easy to make, delicious to eat, and EVERYBODY wants the recipe!  I use "spicy ranch" and "zesty italian" for the dressings just for a little something different.  I always make the day before to let flavors meld.  OH and any leftovers (HAH! I only have leftovers when I make a double batch!) keep well in the fridge for at least a week!!!

This is one of my new favorites!  I have been asked to pass this on to many friends. I make this using fat free dressing and it still tastes wonderful!

Many of the reviewers suggested that more color is needed in the dip.  I find that using Green Giant's "Mexicorn" adds both color and extra flavor.  Another substitution cooks may want to try is a mixture of mayonnaise and sour cream instead of the ranch dressing.  For a little more body to the dip, I've also made this adding approx. 1 cup of finely shredded cheese.

This is definitely unique.  Beans and corn generally don't interest my husband, but he really liked this.  Corn chips are a must -- I tried some with fat-free tortillas, and it just didn't compare.  I added a couple chopped jalepenos which really added to the flavor and texture, used green onions instead of white, and habanero pepper sauce instead of standard hot sauce.  This is a real winner if you're looking for something a bit different.

Delicious -- a big hit at my party this past weekend.  Made a lot of dip, so consider cutting the recipe in half if you are serving other appetizers.

Taken to two diferent events this week, everyone wanted the recipe both times.  I used white corn the first time and yellow the second time, same great response.  I also used white chips for the light crisp taste.  I agree on the color needed, something red to improve the eye appeal.

This is a great dip, although I call it salsa. We used it on so many things...on Taco Salads..top enchiladas..roll-up in burritos, etc.
Thanks for sharing it!

This dip is awesome, one of the BEST dips I've ever made...I made it for Christmas & ended up writing out the recipe for all the women in my family. I brought it to my inlaws one day & they loved it. My mother-in-law ended up making a batch of it for a party she had. I'm making it for superbowl next!

The dip was devoured the first time I made it. 
I like a little more spice, so I used Southwestern Ranch in place of both dressings. I also added a red bell pepper, 1/4 cup jalepenos, 1/2 cup sour cream, and Ancho chili powder to taste.

I am not a huge bean eater but this went over great at a work cinco de mayo party. I took other users suggestions and only used 1/2 cup ranch dressing. I also added some sour cream. It was a huge hit and super simple to make, I will use again!

Loved it!  We roasted diced red bell pepper and roasted the white corn as well for about 30 mins on 400 degrees and left out the cilantro and served the dip warm.  HUGE hit!

I made quite a few changes because I was missing several ingredients.  Used yellow corn instead of white.  Made Italian dressing from salad vinegar, sugar, basil, and oregano.  I didn't have an onion so I used onion powder.  I only had dry spices but I'm sure fresh would make all the difference.  Even with all of these changes it was great.  I will make again.

Sorry, but this didn't go over on Christmas eve and I have a ton of it left. Nothing really that special about this dip. If you do make it cut the recipe in half because your guests may like it but not love it. it needs something extra in it.

This is very good. I made with yellow corn since I had that on hand. Reduced the amount of both dressings slightly. Served with tortilla chips.  Friends asked for the recipe. Will make this again for sure.

Oooh, I loved this dip!  Very, very good!  Definitely let it sit overnight so the flavors can merry!  After mixing it together,though, I tasted it and decided it needed a few extra "Mexican" ingredients: I added a few more heavy dashes of tobasco, some basil, cumin, and paprika.  Add all these to taste and you'll have an awesome alternative to salsa!  We'll keep you posted on what my Mexican-born neighbor thinks of it!

So good!  It does look a little funny, but once you get past that you won't be able to get enough!  I used one can of pinto beans and one can of black, and a 15.25 oz can of mixed white and golden corn.  I also used half jalapeno ranch, half regular ranch.  And added a pinch of ground red pepper.  Yummy!  I will definetly make this again!!

Used this at a SB party.  Was pretty flavorful, but a bit runny.  I thought it would be thicker.  Used frozen corn instead of canned. Everyone loved it.  Maybe next time add cream cheese or sour cream?

I have been making this recipe for a few years.  I like to bring it to the "dish to pass" events, watch people overlook it and then once I talk someone into tasting it...it disappears and everyone wants the recipe.  I confess, I call it the "Ugly Bean Dip" because it is not so attractive, but the taste - MMMM! I use plain can corn not the mexican, and be sure to make ahead of time to let the flavors come out.  Be careful, it can get too soupy. Thank you for this recipe!

I made this dip for a cookout over the weekend and everyone enjoyed it.  I did use only 1/4 cup of Italian and 1/2 cup of Ranch dressing per other reviewers, but I think next time I will use the amount stated in the recipe.  I used mexicorn and subbed a can of pinto  beans for one can of black beans.  Next time I will also use more cilantro, as I think this herb is what gives this type of dish it's flavor. Also, I think it is better to make the day before.  Will make again.

This is really good served with tortilla chips, especially the "scoops" kind! The only thing I might change next time would be to cut back on the dressing a little bit... I used light italian and light ranch and it was still great!

Made this dip for our girls camping trip this past weekend. It was gone the first night! I followed the recipe exactly with the only exception being I used 15 oz. cans of corn (couldn't find 11 oz).Everybody loved it. Thanks for the great dip!

Every time I fix this dip, I am asked for the recipe.  It's easy and delicious.  This has become a much-requested standard at every cocktail buffet.

This is too bland for our taste and just ok.  Not nearly as good as the Avocado Salsa recipe, also on this site, which has similar ingredients.

This is a great recipe!  I will definitely make it again.  The chili powder gives it a nice kick.  Next time I will use a little less ranch and a little more italian for a different flavor.

Awsome! Never lasts long. When I make it for social events, my family gets mad if I don't make a batch for home.  The cilantro really gives it that "je ne sais quoi." I can't count the number of people who have asked me for this recipe.

This recipe has quickly become a favorite in my family. I suggest using McIlhenny Co's green pepper sauce. It gives it a nice flavor without being too hot or overpowering like regular tabasco can be.

I was complimented on this dip, but personally thought it was lacking.  Try adding more hot sauce and lime juice or avocado.

Delicious! Make this 2 days ahead, so the flavors really marry.  I use more cilantro than the recipe called for, and reduced the salad dressings by half.  I used one can black beans and one can of pinto beans,  2 cans mexicorn, and added some red roasted pepper for additional color.  Excellent recipe, Jolene.

I followed the recipe exactly the first time and it turned out good. For the second batch I used the Mexicorn in a can and creamy Italian dressing instead. It was great! My husband brought it to a work taco potluck for people to spoon on tacos or use as a side (definately use corn chips! More flavor). One guy just ate it straight with a spoon!

Made recipe as written. Looks kinda yucky but tastes GREAT. Don't let the odd ingredients keep you from trying this. I used Hidden Valley Ranch & Wish Bone Italian dressings (neither one fat free)& had no problem finding the small can of white corn at Wal-mart Super Cent.

This recipe is delicious! The flavors are super fresh and light. I made it with red and green bell pepper for the Christmas holiday and it was a huge hit. I did however cut back on the amount of dressing that I used by almost half and I am glad that I did as I noticed that it was slightly watery (even after being cut in half) after sitting overnight. I still recommend allowing it to sit overnight in the fridge though so that the delicious flavors can meld and mingle.

Good recipe. I halved the recipe  to try for the first time and I found it a bit soupy. Also the Italian dressing flavor was a little overpowering so I would add less next time. The hot sauce I used was chipotle flavored so blended well with the overall flavors. I also added diced bell pepper, a handful of shredded cheddar cheese, and a squeeze of fresh lime juice which freshened it up. Five stars with the changes!

Amazing!  Wasn't sure what to expect but similar to other reviews, was blown away by how good this tasted.  Didn't even need the chips.  Just grabbed a spoon and went to town.  Wasn't a very big hit at the party though.  Most people didn't try it but got rave reviews by the people who were brave enough to try.  One slight tweek, I used frozen sweet white corn (which I thawed) and not the canned.  Also used Valentina salsa picante for the hot sauce which compared to most hot sauces is less vinegary and more chili flavor.

To my family (here in California), only refried beans  really belong in bean dip. That said it was a little more like an antipasto dip, minus the pasta but with the Italian dressing. Was a nice flavor just  want what I was hoping for.

Yes--it does look a little soupy, but taste was good. Added some chopped tomatoes and swapped some red onion for the white. Depending on how big your group is, you could easily halve--it makes a lot of dip!

Okay I made this but I altered the recipe a lot. Only because I didn't have all I needed to make it exactly as written. ..
I used two cans black beans-drained and rinsed, one can corn-drained and rinsed, one red bell pepper- diced, one cup ranch dressing, 4 oz softened cream cheese, 2 teaspoons chili powder, and a teaspoon of salt. I wanted to add some diced onion, but my brother hates onions, so I didn't. 
It was very good if you ask me. A tad bland, but that's why I added extra seasoning. I might try altering it a bit more next time. But I really did like it. Maybe I'll have all the right ingredients next time too lol

This tastes pretty good, but I did end up making modifications. After reading the reviews, I decided to start with half the recommended dressings and adding more if needed. I did not add any more. The dip was wet enough. More for appearance than taste, I added some diced red pepper. This just didn't go over so well at the party I took it to and I ended up taking most of it home.

Wow - this is amazing!  I couldn't wait the whole 8 hours so I tried this after 2.5 hours in the fridge.  It's FABULOUS!!!  I can't imagine it tasting better in a few more hours!   I did very some things according to other reviewers.  I did cut the dressings by 1/2 (which appears to be perfect).  I used the Zesty Italian someone suggested and fat free Ranch.  I also added 1-2 T sour cream.  I also diced and added 1/2 a red and 1/2 a green pepper.  I could have done the whole for both but I worried about overwhelming the beans/corn - next time I will use the whole peppers.  They add a lot of flavor and color.  I also tiny-diced 1/2 of a jalapeno.  Added a little extra cilantro.  I also added one can of the white corn and, folllowing the reviewer who added "Mexicorn" I made my way through my grocery store's Mexican section until I can across  Kuner's Southwestern Corn N Peppers.  The ingredients on it are listed as "Corn, water, red and green pepper, salt."  This seems like it'd be great in a lot of recipes (i.e Chili).    I completely agree that this would make an excellent side-dish, too - eating it right off a spoon is delicious and if you're health-concious, I suppose it's better for you this way.  (But who can resist a corn chip?!)

Everyone really liked this dip, including the kids.  The only thing I will try different next time is to add a chopped jalapeno for a little more flavor.

I found this recipe a couple years ago, each time I make it, everyone loves it.  Fresh cilantro makes this dish.  I usually halve the recipe and it makes enough for a smaller gathering.  Leftovers taste even better the next day.

Made this for a summer BBQ and it was great!  We like things spicy so I doubled the hot sauce and chili powder.  It was a little ruuny, so I think next time I'll do a little less dressing and add a little lime juice.

This was ok. It rivals Spicy bean Salsa on this site. THis recipe was definatly missing something, maybe some cayanne or some chopped jalapeno. I thought it was kind of bland

This was AWESOME!  I reduced the dressings a bit but otherwise an excellent dip!

I made this for a party and everyone freaked over it! My husband liked it so much that now I make it almost every week. It is fast, cheap, and easy to make. And it tastes awesome!

Delicious!  I didn't have any black beans on hand, so I used red.  Will definately be making this one again.  Thanks!
