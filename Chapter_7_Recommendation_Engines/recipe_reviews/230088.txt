absolutely terrific... I sprinkle the nuts on after I pour out the toffee onto the crackers. So great to give as a small gift in a tin to neighbors, etc.

These were tasty but something wasn't right about them.  The texture was grainy and really wanted the sweet pecan taste and it was just sweet.  My sister in law makes them all the time and I wanted them to taste like hers.  After making these, I used her recipe and found a huge difference. Instead of 1 c brown sugar, I used 1/2 regular white sugar. & added 1 tsp vanilla. Made all the difference in the world. With the changes they were fantastic and exactly what I was looking for. My kiddos wouldn't eat the ones I made with the given recipe. With the changes they love them.

At first I thought this wouldn't turn out well, but after sitting for several hours, it really tastes great!  Sweet, but isn't that the point?  My caramel sauce turned out a little grainy, but I'll overlook that this time.  I used one packet of graham crackers in a 13x9 pan to make them.  These make nice bite-size candies!  Thank you very much, Mary Smith!

Don't use anymore nuts than called for unless you increase the butter and sugar.Can be too dry when baked.

Used butter instead of margarine. And guess what I did? I forgot to add the second stick of butter!! I couldn't understand why the mixture didn't cover all of my crackers!! What I will tell you is that instead of Carmelita's we had Toffeelita's. The flavor is AMAZING!! Crunchy and hard over the cracker but still VERY GOOD!!

I tried these after being given as a gift. OMGOSH! I thought they were bakery made. I got the recipe and make them all the time. So simple and absolutely out of this world. I'm not much of a sweet eater but this will be a hit trust me.

This recipe is soooo delicious and very easy to make! Took me all of about 10 minutes to get these in the oven. I used butter since I didnt have any margarine and they came out perfect! The secrect is to get those crackers as close as possible because the mixture can run off - but you can maneuver it a little once its on the crackers. A keeper recipe for dessert in a flash!

Plan to make these by sprinkle nuts on after pouring toffee onto crackers.  Instead of 1 c brown sugar, will use 1/2 regular white sugar & add 1 tsp vanilla.

Perfect and easy! I needed something in a hurry and these filled the bill -- with ingredients I already had in the house.
