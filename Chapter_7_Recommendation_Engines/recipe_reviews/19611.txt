This recipe is to die for...it is sooo good. I did modify it a bit by adding a few dashes of liquid smoke and red pepper flakes. It was such a good recipe that I made it to give away at Christmas. I found that by quadrupling (by 4) that I was able to make about 2 jars (12-ounce) of sauce. It also makes a great dip for chips. Thanks for a great recipe. Definately has been added to my favorites.

This was exactly what I was looking for. A good base for a BBQ Sauce! This will be the base for all my BBQ sauces now. This time I added a little spices, herbs, Liquid Smoke, Honey and Jack Daniels.... Best BBQ sauce ever!!

Just made this sauce today. I made is exactly as written and it tasted wonderful. I don't think anyone should be allowed to rate a recipe that they've altered. Make it as is first, then rate it, then adjust it as you wish. 
This is a really good, really easy basic BBQ sauce recipe, well worth the 5 stars for taste and ease of preparation. However, for myself and my family's tastes I added fresh finely chopped onions, minced garlic, liquid hickory smoke flavouring and some honey. Wow, to die for or what! This sauce just the way it's written is great, but it is also very forgiving so you can adjust it to your liking. Everyone is different and no two palates are the same so, If you like it really spicy, add some more hot sauce or red chile flakes or add more sugar or honey like I did and just keep tasting until you get it to your liking. Heck you could even add some minced pineapple for that matter! Once you get it where you like it, then let it sit for a few hours and see it surpass your expectations as when it sits, it gets even better. Oh, and I quadrupled the recipe to make sure I had plenty left over for another day since it will keep quite a while in the fridge. Hope this helps for some of you :)

I used this sauce on ribs, and my husband said,
"Don't buy anymore sauce!  This is better than any we've ever bought!"

Wow! This was awesome! I had some sausage links on hand that I didn't know how to use. Then I remembered that I had a sausage sandwich from Dickey's the other day and it was the best. So I made sausage sandwiches with this recipe and it was just as good, if not better. Love it, love it, love it, and I can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow. Thanks! It was also incredibly easy to make.

This sauce is spectacular!  My husband loves bar-b-que chicken, but I've never been able to make my own sauce.  He loves this sauce, and I can't seem to make it often enough!

This recipe is the best I've ever tried!  My kids are picky eaters and they loved this.  (I left out the hot sauce for the kids batch.)  I marinated some chicken in this recipe and it was wonderful on the grill.  It stuck to the chicken and didn't drip all over the place.  We loved it so much, I used it the same week to slow-cook a roast pork.  I chopped the meat into chunks and added more sauce.  Put it on hamburger buns, and got rave reviews from everyone who tried it.  I made a little extra for those who wanted more on thier sandwich...they emptied the whole jar!
Kudos to Debi for a great recipe worth sharing!

I love love love this recipe!!! I made it a few days ago when I made Barbecue Ribs from this site. The ribs recipe had it's own sauce but I didn't have everything for it and I didn't think the sauce would have fit my familys taste just from reading the ingredients, so I decided to look for a sauce recipe that would fit and I found this one. I'm so so so glad I found this recipe! I worked out great for the ribs, but after I tasted it I thought about how many other things I could use it with also. I think this Bar- B-Que sauce would be awesome with the mini hot dogs that you put in a slow cooker with bbq sauce mmmmmm.... I can't wait to try this recipe with all my ideas!! Thanks!

This sauce was wonderful!!! My family cooked out for the 4th of July on yesterday and ran out of sauce so for left overs today, I didn't feel like going to the market to buy more sauce and I am so glad I didn't.  Like a few others, I tweeked the ingredients a little for my taste also.  I cut down on some of the cider vinegar, double the other ingredients, except I used a dash of regular hot sauce, and more brown sugar. I also used dry chopped onion in mine. Thanks so much for the recipe, it's a great base and I will never buy bbq sauce AGAIN!!! :-)

This is a great recipe for bar-be-que sauce.  It taste like the sauce at one of the popular Texas bar-be-que joints we frequent-only without the hydrogenated oils.  I quadrupled the batch since it was for a 6 lb. brisket.  I carmelized half of a large onion before I started (because we like onion) and added the rest of the ingredients to the pot, leaving the little bit of olive oil in the pot that was left over from the onion.  I substituted 2 cloves minced garlic for the garlic powder.  I also used organic catsup instead of the stuff that comes from the neighborhood grocery store.  The organic kind is made from cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup, which taste WAY better.  I think our catsup made a real difference.  If you have access to it, try it!  We used mostly organic ingredients, too, which have a better flavor than conventional foods-well to us anyway.  I also added 1 1/2 tablespoons of Jack Daniels when it was finished cooking.   I may use onion powder the next time so that it will keep in the referigerator longer.  Thanks!

I love this sauce.  It's very easy and inexpensive to make.  I found that it tastes better if you use it the day after you make it - gives the flavors extra time to blend.

Unless you're cooking for one, you'll want to make extra of this sauce. Made exactly as written and found it had too much worcestershire and vinegar, so doubled up on remaining ingredients. Perfection! Enough acid for me and hubs (we like our sauce with sass), and sweet enough for Mom who likes a sweet sauce. When Mom's not around I'll increase the hot sauce to kick it up bit. So simple, so quick, so easy to modify to taste. Nice sauce!

I've made this several times, and my family loves it every time. I've made it with soy sauce instead of worcestershire, and it was still yummy. I don't add the extra salt that the recipe calls for because I figure its salty enough. This is great because if you buy all natural ketchup, then you can skip having any high fructose corn syrup in your bbq sauce (which it seems like all the bottled kinds have it). I don't buy the bottled stuff anymore!

I have to give this recipe credit as the *base* of my final sauce. However, as sauce is an individual preference, you might find yourself tweaking this recipe A LOT. I wound up doubling the brown sugar, using white vinegar and increasing it by 1 teaspoon, adding 1 teaspoon prepared yellow mustard, adding 1/8 teaspoon black pepper, adding 1/4 teaspoon onion powder, adding a teaspoon lemon juice, and adding back in an extra squirt of ketchup. The sauce I wound up with was tangy and zesty. You might want something completely different. You have to play with this recipe. It does not taste very good as written, but is a decent base for your own special touch.

I have used this recipe for years & love it. I also use it  with sautéed  onions to  make  BBQ onions   I never seems to make enough!  I iuse the sauce to make BBQ beans by adding it to canned  BBQ beans, adding sliced onions & a strip of bacon the. Bake 350 for about 35.  I'm always asked to bring these to pot lucks.  There are many more uses for this sauce. Be creative!

I have never made BBQ sauce but found myself knee deep in ribs without sauce one day.  My family loved it!  I am passing it off as "Mom's BBQ Sauce"! heehee!

Ok, I have to admit this sauce turned out way better than I expected and it was super easy to whip up. It is way better than anything in a bottle.  As other people have mentioned this is a good basic sauce which you could add a little of this or a little of that to in order to make it your own.

This is our go to BBQ Sauce recipe! I wont buy it in the stores anymore.  Since we have some young eaters to please I skip the red pepper flakes and add a little honey. Perfect every time! Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

This was pretty good, but I found I needed more; I scaled it down to serve 4, then made chicken drumsticks on the grill for just hubby and I, and would have liked more sauce-there was hardly enough.  Just don't contaminate it all and you can save any extra-better to have too much than not enough. I really like the suggestion of BIGCHEEZ to add honey and Jack Daniels-I will try that sometime.

What a GREAT recipe for Bar-B-Que Sauce!!!  I doubled the recipe so I would have extra.  Made it to go on pork ribs in the crock pot.  I added the 1tsp garlic powder and then added 2 cloves fresh garlic.  Used the prepared mustard and liquid smoke as others had suggested.  I also poured in some coffee, a little secret I learned from one of my customers.  We absolute loved this sauce.  I liked that it wasn't to sweet.  Thanks Debi for posting it.

This recipe was great. It is my go to base recipe for homemade BBQ sauce. Every once in a while I will add or change an ingredient just to try a new flavor, but this sauce is great just the way it is too. Thanks for submitting it!

Excellent! We marinated wings in this sauce for several hours and then grilled them. They got rave reviews! I used 1 tsp. prepared mustard instead of mustard powder, minced garlic instead of powder, and omitted the hot pepper sauce.

Excellent sauce.  I tweaked it slightly with what I had on hand.  Instead of mustard powder, dijon.  Instead of garlic powder I used minced garlic.  I also add pepper flakes instead of hot pepper sauce. A dash of Jack Daniels put this over the top.   My husband took this to work, and the guys couldn't get enough.

I loved this recipe and only made a few minor changes.  

1.  I sauteed 2 tablespoons of finely chopped onion in 2 tablespoons of butter until tender and then added the other ingredients.

2.  I also added 2 tablespoons of orange juice.

I don't like smoky flavored BBQ sauce which is what most store brands are so I decided to try this sweet and tangy homemade version.

It's not quite one cup of sauce so I changed the ingredients to two cups.

Great!

I fixed this tonight to go with a smoked beef brisket.  My husband put a dry rub on the brisket the day before and cooked all day in his smoker.  I prepared the sauce right before dinner and served over the sliced beef.  We all loved it and it was so easy to prepare with ingredients I always have on hand!  This is definitely a keeper!  I did not change a thing!!

The flavors of this BBQ sauce are wonderful.  Much better than store-bought.  The only change I made was to add onion powder and minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  Served this with the Grilled Chicken and Herbs recipe from this site. Delicious!

This is very good.  The only thing I didn't like is the amount of Worcestershire sauce in it--I thought it was too strong.  I'll definitely make this again, but I'll cut the amount in half.

We really liked this. Just the right texture and not too sweet, but an interesting bite to it. Very good. Will use from now on.

This is a great BBQ sauce.  I do a couple things different with this sauce.  For some kick I add a chipotle pepper and 2 garlic cloves.  I put everything in a food processor just to chop up the pepper and garlic.  Makes for a very nice sauce.

I would honestly rate this 4.5 stars. It was delicious! I followed the recipe pretty much. A few dashes of hot sauce and fresh garlic since I didn't have garlic powder. I also added a teaspoon of season salt and 1/2 tsp of black pepper. I think the next time I will use a little less vinegar and a little more hot sauce. Besides that DELICIOUS! My hubby is probably trying to sneak and lick the pot as I'm typing this! I used the sauce on [Cleveland, OH style] Polish Boys. It's a keeper!!!

I have never left a rating/review in all my years on allrecipes simply because if I changed anything, it didn't seem fair to do a rating (and I always seem to find something to tweak). So, for the first time ever, I did not change a thing and this was absolutely the BEST BBQ sauce ever! I will never buy a bottled sauce again. This was easy to put together using pantry items, fast and really wonderfully tasty. The whole family agreed that this is a keeper just as it is. Thanks so much!

I simply had to try this recipe after reading so many positive reviews, but was sadly disappointed with the outcome. The sauce tasted plain and bland. Can anyone shed some light as to what I may have done wrong? Otherwise I will be reverting to the store bought version

Terrific recipe! My husband even thought it was the best BBQ sauce I have ever made. I had all the ingredients on hand and followed the recipe exactly. My only recommendation is to double the recipe and keep some in the refrigerator.

My husband's diabetic and its impossible to find a recipe with low carbs for BBQ. I used this one using heinz low carb ketchup and Splenda's low carb brown sugar. It turned out fantastic. A definite keeper.

I first made the recipe as written (doubled), but when I tasted it, I thought something was missing.  It was a little too tangy for what I was going to use it for, so I added another couple squirts of ketchup, a tiny bit of red pepper, some onion powder, and a little honey.  Then it seemed to taste just right.  This is a great base recipe, though. This was the first time I ever made BBQ sauce, so it was a complete success.   Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I doubled the recipe and still barely had enough for 2 people. (We liked it that much.) I will quadruple it times a million next time, BECAUSE it is one of my new favorite things. I made the recipe as is, and i'm 100% pleased with it. In the future i might add some cayenne or crushed red pepper cause i love it spicy.

A great barbecue sauce. Because it suited what I was using it for, I also added half a minced onion to it. If in the future I don't add fresh onions, I will add onion powder as I like that flavor in my barbecue sauces.

What a nice surprise! I was unsure of this recipe but made it because I didn't have any BBQ sauce for my slow-cooked ribs. This sauce was really good and over the top with chipotle Tabasco added to it. I didn't have any garlic powder so I added onion flakes and it was so good. Thank you for a BBQ sauce to look forward to - will be making this again and again:)

Great recipe. I substituted a different vinegar (used balsamic) as well as using prepared mustard instead of the powder and it turned out well. Even though I wasn't amazed by the outcome, my family RAVED about the sauce. The picky eater had TWO helpings of the pulled pork (on sandwiches) that I put this sauce on. Like other reviewers have said, be careful with that hot sauce, as a dash or less is all you really need. Unless you like it fiery!

I made this for Superbowl to cook some lil' smokies in.  My husband and son loved the flavor.  I made a double batch for 2 packages and it was just enough.  I thought it was a bit sweet and savory, it could have been a bit more tangy and hot but I had it mild for my 8 yo son.  Husband said he normally doesn't like those smokies but has eaten most of the first batch already!  Great for a really quick bbq sauce and most people have all the ingredients on hand.

This was exactly what I was looking for.  Just a good basic recipe for BBQ that I could alter to our personal tastes.  I didn't actually have the dry mustard so I just used regular mustard and I cut back on the sugar a little.  I put it on pulled pork and everyone loved it.  It doesn't make very much so if you have a lot of meat you will definitely want to at least double the recipe!

I made this to go into some pulled pork bbq. I'm new to this and found this recipe to extremely easy. I had to triple the batch for the amount of pork I had. My daughter doesn't really like bbq but said this was the  best she's ever had. Her and her husband didn't leave much left overs.

Delicious, nice tangy flavor.  I doubled the batch and then added half of a bottle of KC masterpiece for added thickness and a little more smoke flavor.  Was still tangy and did not have that store-bought taste.  Will make this every time now.  Hubby loved it!

I absolutely love this recipe.  It's got a great tangy flavor and the nice thing about it is that you can easily modify it to your taste -- if it's not hot enough just add more hot pepper sauce -- need it smokier -- just add liquid smoke.  I never buy/use store-bought BBQ sauce anymore!

I used this as a guideline for make my own sauce.  Here is what I changed: Ommited the vinegar and mustard powder.  Added liqud smoke.  Just a dash or two.  This is one of those recipes that I have made a TON of time and now I don't measure stuff out.  Play with it.  But everytime I make it I get request for more!

The first time I made this recipe, I added too much garlic, but the next time, it was perfect!  I've used it on ribs and pork roast..its been fantastic both ways!  I love this recipe..I won't buy bbq sauce from the store again.  I found adding cayenne pepper gives it a big extra kick!

My husband and I couldn't believe how AWESOME this sauce is.  We prefer ours a little bit sweet and kinda tangy.  This was really easy and adaptable to any one's taste.  Definately a keeper!!  Hard not to lick your fingers!! Thanks to Debi K

BBQ chicken pizza for dinner tonight and guess what? No bbq sauce in the house! Onto Allrecipes I went and found this easy recipe. After adding all listed ingredients and simmering for a bit, I knew I'd need to tweak it a bit to fit my family's tastes. Since this recipe doesn't make much (and I didn't want to double it), I stretched this a bit by adding about 1/4 c water. I also used liquid smoke to taste, honey, prepared mustard, 1T Jack Daniels whiskey, onion powder and chili powder (this ingredient is key, IMHO, for flavorful bbq sauce). After the tweaks, it was just what I was hoping for, considering it was so quick to throw together. This recipe rescued dinner and I will definitely use it again with my personal tweaks.

I have in the past made bar b que sauce. I didn't have hot pepper sauce so I substituted a 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper. Added a package of little sausages and simmered on the lowest setting on the stove for two hours. Love this recipe!

Didn't have everything for this, so used peanut sauce instead of  Worcestershire, regular mustard instead of powder, and no garlic powder.  Was very good, I'll be trying the original recipe when I pick up the missing ingredients.  Thanks

Love it!  Was out of bbq sauce and I was grilling chicken for the kids.  Found this recipe and just like it says; I had the ingredients in my pantry.  Made it as written and the family loved it.  I liked it so much, I made it again with a couple of changes.  Added Old Bay and bourbon and boy was it a hit.  I will continue to use this sauce as is, and as a base for further experimentation.  Meanwhile, my friends and family are all getting a jar along with their Christmas packages this year!

Very good and easy to make.  Wanted something to add to chicken breasts I bought on the way home from a very long, tiring workday.  Chicken on the grill and the sauce mixed up in no time!  Very easy, very simple ingredients and very yummy. 

Did substitute molasses for brown sugar, but that's just a personal preferance, technically you can change the sweetener in sauces like these to suit your taste.

It is SUPER easy to make, the flavor was BOLD and I added 1/2 a teaspoon of red crushed chile flakes because hubby likes it SPICY. I'll be making lots more during the summer for the many bar-be-cues we make! I'll be using it for pulled pork I've been making in the crock pot today!

I marinaded the chicken for about an hour in this sauce, and then my husband grilled it up. Tasted delicious! I will definitely make this sauce again, and will also try to use it as a sauce for baked chicken.

I just made this a minute ago after searching on the web for a quick and easy BBQ sauce recipe. This was a savior because I came home ready to make dinner only to discover I didn't have BBQ sauce. This was a simple, sweet, thick sauce. I used it to cover 3 large breast from Aldi. I love it. and by the way I used splenda brown sugar and it tastes great!!!

This is a great sauce from the start.
The only thing I ever do different is I add liquid smoke if I won't be making it out to the grill.

Needed something quick for our Labor Day Lunch. This recipe filled the bill and turned out just delicious. We're authentic 'bar b cue coniseurs' but due to lack of planning, needed a sauce on the spot.....and it sure did 'hit the spot'. Will look to this for all our bar-b-que sauces from now on. Thanks.

Couldn't imagine anything much easier and better.  I was lazy - just measured it into a 2 cup glass measuring cup and microwaved.  It was delicious on our grilled chicken!!

Pretty good basic recipe.  However, I felt there was way too much Worcestershire.  Next time will reduce by at least half if not more.

It doesn't get any easier or quicker than this! I realized I was out of bbq sauce and needed a few Tblsp. for a turkey recipe. I made this in about 5 minutes or less. The taste is pretty darn good to. Thank you, for posting!

Great, easy barbeque sauce!  I used it to make BBQ chicken in the oven, and my husband loved the sauce!  I added a bit of honey (maybe about a tablespoon) and a tiny extra bit of sugar.

A very solid, easy to make sauce.  Thick, very tangy, very flavorful, and not overly sweet.  Also, took less than 5 minutes to prepare.

I made this exactly as written and thought it was great.  Sweet and a little hot all at the same time.  I had some extra meatballs in the freezer that I wanted to defrost and cook for dinner, but was out of my usual sauce ingredients, and this was a great replacement.  Not only will I make this again, but I like knowing that it's full of normal ingredients unlike some of the things in bottled bbq sauce.

I think it's a great recipe. Took others advice added honey, only 1/2 tbls and a couple of red pepper flakes.
No need to buy bbq sauce anymore. I found this because we ran out & we're bbq'ing chicken.
Thanks

This is a very tasty BBQ sauce! It's mild, but you could easily kick the heat up or down with more or less hot sauce. I had to make a few changes to the recipe because I didn't have everything: 1 small fresh garlic clove instead of the garlic powder, 1 tablespoon prepared mustard for the mustard powder, and rice vinegar instead of cider vinegar. I also added a dash of crushed red pepper flakes and some onion powder.
I'll definitely be making this again!

very good sauce. Made this to marinade, baste and dip our ribs in. Got lots of compliments on it. I used prepared mustard instead of powder. Then I added some cayenne for a kick, honey to make it sweeter and some smoked paprika to round it out. Tasty and a snap to make.

Yum!  I used a "good squeeze" of yellow mustard instead of mustard powder.  I also skipped the "simmer" step because I put it on top of some cooked meatballs.  (After the meatballs were finished cooking, I spooned this sauce over them, covered the dish with tin foil, and baked for another 15 minutes.)  I wish I would have doubled the sauce recipe for my 16 meatballs because it would have been delicious on my mashed potatoes.

Fabulous just the way it is. I doubled it. put pork ribs in the crock pot, poured the sauce over it, let it sit in the refridge overnight, then cooked on low for 8 hours the next day. Wow, delish!

if possible - 6 stars. Excellent sauce! Makes a great base for any variation as well. I like to add a little liquid smoke for a hickory sauce. I also had success roasting jalapeno peppers and cooking them into the sauce (then blending the peppers in) for a hotter sauce.

Very good basic sauce. I would 1/2 the cider vinegar though. I used sweet hot mustard instead of mustard powder and it came out great! Will use again and maybe try out some different variations mentioned here in the reviews too!

Great EASY recipe!!  I had most of the stuff in my pantry, except the apple vinegar but I just used regular vinegar.  I did read the other reviews and added some honey so it was just a little less tart for my kids and that did the trick.  This recipe is definitely a keeper and will not waste my money anymore on store brought bbq sauce.

This was really good and easy compared to the other sauce I typically make. I did add some liquid smoke, arbol chili flakes, and some black pepper. I quadrupled the sauce and was glad I did it was sooo yummy!!!

Doubled the recipe and added a dash of liquid smoke. We cooked ribs in the sauce. It was a very good basic recipe. We'll be making it again, but spicing it up a bit.

OMG I made this after I learned that I had no BBQ sauce. I was nervous as my husband is very very picky. He loved it. Guess what! Now I can the BBQ sauce so I have it when we need it. I also give it to my friends and or as a thank you and people just rave. THANKS THANKS THANKS

Nice simple recipe. I didn't have cider vinegar so I used balsamic vinegar. I also used red pepper in place of mustard powder. Used as a chicken marinade for a couple of hours and cooked on the grill - very yummy. Next time I will double the recipe and save half to drizzle on when serving.

I was ready to start dinner when I realized I was out of barbeque sauce.  This recipe contained everything I had on hand.  We found it to be a good substitution and not worth our time running to the store for any other sauce.  I will make again.

Holy Cow!  This is the best bar-b-que sauce I have ever tried, much less made.  It was easier to throw this together than to go to the store and buy some.  I used a sugar substitute, because I didn't have brown sugar, and it was fantastic.  Thank You!!

A good base to start with,but needs more flavor.The flavor had to much ketchup taste to me.I added liquid smoke and honey and this made it a lot better.

I wish I could give this recipe ten stars.  My husband has me make ribs every week now using this wonderful sauce.  My kids even eat bar-B-Que now, since I started using this sauce. I let the sauce marinate on the ribs for at least 8 hours before cooking.
 I eat this sauce with fries!! This sauce is unbelievable.  I will never buy Bar-B-Que sauce again!!!  Thank you!!!

mmm mmm my boyfriend was skeptical because he always is when i make something like bbq sauce that we normally buy store bought but he was impressed in the end. this was so simple and a great base recipe using ingrediendts i already had. i do like a little more spice so added a little extra hot sauce and i was out of cider vinegar so i used red wine vinegar. thsnks for a simple inexpensive easy recipe two thumbs up.

Yum Yum! the only thing I did different was to add liquid smoke. We like a smokey sweet bbq sauce. Other than that I followed recipe. This is just like the one I usually make but I don't write it down I just throw stuff in and it doesn't always turn out. Now I have a no fail recipe. Thanks!

Really good.  This was exactly what I was looking for because I usually have these ingredients on hand.  I did not have any worcestshire sauce so I subsititued an equal amount of A1 for it.  Very good recipe!

I made this when I realised I'd run out of barbecue sauce. Friends who came round for the first barbecue of the year said this was really good and my husband was disappointed that he never got to try it. So I'll be making this again soon. Many Thanks.

We used red wine vinegar because we didn't have any cider vinegar, but made no other changes. This was very, very good on our barbecued ribs, best sauce I've had in a long time. We will definitely be making this again and again, especially since the ingredients are things we always have on hand. We did ours in the microwave, too, so it was especially easy. Thanks for sharing this one!

This is a great Sauce for my ribs!  I use regular dijon mustard, plain vinegar and am really careful about how much hot sauce I put into it!
I simmer my ribs in this sauce for about an hour....I've received rave reviews from my friends and family!  They just love it.

I doubled this recipe,and I had to use seasoned rice vinegar because thats all I had on hand. Also I diddnt have any dry mustard so substituted a sweet hot mustard that was in my fridge. This is a nice basic recipe on its own or if you want to change it up it is adaptable. I also have used half brown sugar and half molasses, and half chili sauce half ketchup...either way it always comes out wonderful.

Great BBQ sauce.  For a little extra kick I added in some hot sauce & banana ketchup that we purchased in St. Lucia.  This was a great sauce to mop onto our ribs.  Yummy! I'll be making this again and often.

Its ok. I've had better. It is just kind of there...nothing spectacular. I'm trying to tweak it a bit to make something that I love. Maybe onion pieces would actually be better...plus, I'm not too fond of the cider vinegar.

This is such a quick and delicious recipe, and it is easy to alter.  I like it a bit more sweet, so I added another tbl of ketchup and maybe 1/3 c more brown sugar.  We loved it on our ribs.

Super base recipe for outstanding bbq sauce!  So quick, easy, and inexpensive.  I tripled the sauce for pulled pork yesterday.  I found, for us, it needed some diced onion, a little honey and black pepper.  Really good. Can't wait to fire up the smoker again!

Not as good as the one I made before, but I can't find the recipe and don't remember exactly what went into it. It would be worth making again but I will also keep looking for one that "fits the bill". It was very simple to make and I did have everything on hand.

FIVE star recipe! This sauce was so good and VERY easy to make. I added a dash or 2 of liquid smoke (as suggested by others.)  I used this on wings.  I lightly seasoned my wings with paprika, garlic, pepper and a little season salt and then I brush my wings with the sauce and let it marinate in the fridge for about 2 hours.  Once my husband put the wings on the grill, I made an additional batch of sauce so that we could brush some on as they were grilling. FANTASTIC. As I was eating the wings I kept saying "YUMMMMMM" to the point my 20 month old daughter started repeating me! LOL

Now THIS is good!  I can't wait to have friends over for bbq and see their faces when I tell them the sauce is homemade!  I also added a couple dashes of liquid smoke, and it turned out awesome.

This was real good, except i had to make the recipe doubled twice. It just didnt make enough sauce, thats why i only gave it 4 stars. Other that that its delicious. I made it with simple bbq ribs from this site!! Will most definately make again.

I poured this sauce over boneless ribs and my husband and I agreed, they were the best ribs I had ever made!  A little salty so maybe next time I will reduce the salt a little, but this sauce is exceptionally good!

Great! I keep some made in a container in the fridge now because my fiance wants to eat it on everything-- chicken, burgers, steak--I mean anything! I leave out the vinegar, though, but I'm just not a vinegar person. Has a real bite to it and is very flavorful. Try it!

This is very nummy!!  What was nice is I was able to adapt it for a friend that can't have any sort of pepper.  I added almost double the garlic, was amazingly tasty.  Still sweet and savory with a hint of kick.  I have made it twice now.  So easy to 'play' with and VERY quick to make.  Perfect!!

This was a quick and very easy sauce to make. I didn’t have dark brown sugar so I used light brown sugar and it was just as tasty. I tripled the recipe to have enough for the pulled pork I made and to have extra for chicken I’d be making.

Just right and tastes great as written and takes so easily to additions or changes depending on what people like.  Like artificial smoke flavoring? Add it! Like less sugar? Leave some out or use honey! Try it with half the Worcestershire if that's not your jam.  Don't have mustard powder? Add a dab of prepared. Or try stone ground, it's delicious. Bottled sauces have too many unnecessary ingredients (like corn syrup, preservatives and oils) and we find them way too sweet and artificial tasting.

I made it this morning for the chicken breasts I'll be grilling this afternoon on my Traeger grill! 

 I followed the recipe exactly except for the  white vinegar as I am out of cider vinegar, but I didn't think it would make that much of a difference. 

Then tasted it. OMG!  Love it!  I had hubby taste it and he loved as made.  I had a bottle of liquid smoke out just in case, but we didn't think it needed anything.  

But I'll get some cider vinegar for next time and report my findings.

  Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

I made this sauce as is and it truly is delicious. I used chicken leg quarters that I baked at 400 for about 35 mins then brushed the sauce on, turned the hot oven off, let sit in the hot oven for about 10 more minutes. I brined the leg quarter in water, brown sugar and salt for a couple hours also. The meat was flavorful and juicy and the sauce put it over the top. The only thing I may do different next time is add a 1/2 cup or so of chicken broth to the sauce and let it simmer for a few minutes to allow the sugar to dissolve a bit, mine was grainy after just bringing it to a boil.  Really, on it's own it's great!

Absolutely delicious;  I decided to make this sauce because I didn't have barbecue sauce in the bottle but I had all the ingredients to make this recipe. It's very easy to make  and it taste scrumptious. I don't think I'll be using bottled sauce anymore, uh I'll see.

This tasted for like steak sauce than BBQ sauce. It was disappointing, but still had an interesting taste. It wasn't horrible. We did put it in a small crockpot and used it for dipping Smokies.

My boyfriend wanted me to start making BBQ sauce instead of buying it  so I went in search of a simple recipe and found this. Its a great simple recipe. My boyfriend is a very picky eater and he really liked it. I added a little bit of cayenne pepper to it and I'll probably play with it some more the next time I need BBQ sauce but it's really good just the way it is and takes absolutely no time to make

Holy cow I can't believe how many good reviews this sauce got! Followed the recipe to a tee and OH MY GOSH sooooo much Worcester it overwhelmed every other flavor. I tried adding more of the other ingredients in equal parts to try and tone it down but it wasn't a saveable sauce. Ick

I wish I could give this more than 5 stars.  Being from the South we are very particular about our sauce.  This one is just the right balance of sweet with a hint of vinegar.  I have completely stopped buying BBQ sauce, and just  make sure I have an extra bottle of ketchup in the pantry.  It is great on everything and stores well in the fridge.  I always make a large enough batch to use an entire bottle of ketchup, that way I have it on hand whenever I need. I also think that the spices blend over time making it just get better and better.

Awesome! Tastes like a bbq house. I didn’t have brown sugar so I used white. I also added a touch of liquid smoke. I’ll make it to the “T” next time.

Little heavy on the vinegar for my taste, and I usually like a lot of vinegar. Just evened it out with a bit more ketchup, so no harm. Easy to adjust to individual tastes, and easy to make with ingredients in the pantry, so you don't always have to have BBQ sauce on hand. May start making my own all the time now, esp. since its sometimes hard to find BBQ sauce that is organic and doesn't have corn syrup that the fam likes.

I wanted BBQ chicken tonight but didn’t have any BBQ sauce.... I found this recipe and tweeked it with ingredients I had on hand.... left out the hot pepper sauce, used Braggs Amino Acids in place of Worcestershire sauce, used balsamic vinager instead of Cider vinegar and used prepared Dijon mustard instead of dry mustard.... then I added a squeeze (don’t ask me how much that is, lol) of honey.  All other ingredients I used as listed.   It was INCREDIBLE!!!  I can say that I will probably never again buy prepared (full of chemicals and preservatives) BBQ sauce!  This was sooooo easy to make and tasted soooo good!!  I think I may experiment with it a little more in the future to make it more natural..... I.e. make my own ketchup, replace brown sugar with molasses or Pure maple syrup.... either way, it’s GUD! Lol

Substituted 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes for hot sauce.  My husband is not a big rib fan, but he really loved the country style ribs.

This is a wonderful bbq sauce and have used a similar recipe for years but love playing with the taste.  Most recently added hot curry for an extra kick...add to taste...also have added tumeric, cumin,  soy with great success.

The only thing I did differently was use regular mustard instead of the powder stuff. I was a little hesitant about having my boyfriend eat this, because he is usually pretty picky. But he LOVED it. He wants me to make this more often, and it is so easy to make I will!

Will never worry if I don't have BBQ sauce in the house again. Fast and delish. Only made about 1/2 the recipe, and had to make one substitution.  Didn't have dry mustard, so used a little spicy brown. Also used my hickory smoked salt for the salt. Actually, probably won't ever be buying store made BBQ sauce in the future!

I made this recipe and it turned out great as a Bar-B-Q / basting sauce. I did modify it by leaving out the vinegar and in its place I substituted 1 Tbs bourbon and 1 Tbs mesquite liquid smoke. Slow cooking my rack of pork ribs and using this every half hour they turned out great. Definitely worth using again

Did a search for a basic bbq sauce, this one was at the top of the list, being my favorite recipe site I came and checked it out first. I had to look no further! This is the best, matter of fact, I had a recipe that we really liked but we just wanted something different this time. I think I found my new go to and he agreed so....I followed the recipe exactly with using the note at the bottom. (1 T Worchestershire + 2 T Vinegar) Delicious!!!

Winner, winner pork rib dinner! Such an easy recipe to make and gets rave reviews each time I make it. How could you go back to store-bought after this? Some observations: double the recipe or even triple it if you like extra sauce with your BBQ as Southerners do. I add liquid smoke, as well as Heinz yellow mustard instead of dry, since most of us have that around the house. Can't go wrong with this one!

We love this sauce!! It's not to sweet, has that perfect amount of tang, and isn't overly spicy (unless you want it to be). I like that this is a really basic recipe so you can easily adjust it to your own taste.

O......MY.....GOSH! Amazing flavor! this was a last minute thing as when I went into the cabinet to fetch my store bought bbq sauce, I noticed I had none. Found this recipe and luckily had all the ingredients needed. Finished in under 5 minutes, brushed over my country style ribs and MMMMM MMMM MMMMMMMM!!! I won't be buying store bought bbq sauce again. Had enough left over and stored it in a mason jar for next time.

So good and so very easy.  Ingredients you probably have on hand.  I used a spicy jared  mustard because I had no dry mustard.  I mixed it all with a whisk in the slow cooker, added a well trimmed pork shoulder roast  and  ta da...pulled pork.  (I did remove the lid to the cooker near the end of cooking to let the sauce reduce and thicken)

This is a delicious barbeque sauce, not too hot, not too sweet.  The only change I made was substituting 1/2 tsp regular mustard because I was out of mustard powder.  We will use this again!

I started out making this recipe exactly as stated but found that it had a bit to much garlic for our taste and we like garlic and use it on just about all our meat dishes.  I did double the recipe too.  I ended up tweaking this recipe quite a bit just trying to cut the garlic some.  We like that hickory flavor so I did add some liquid smoke too.  In the end my husband did rave about it and told me he'd like it if I made this sauce from now on instead of buying the bottle stuff.  Since it's so easy to make and I always have the ingredients on hand all the time I guess I'll be making BBQ sauce from now on.  I love that this sauce is so fast and easy to make and I don't have to worry about not having all the ingredients on hand when I want to make it.  I will however cut the garlic powder down a little and continue adding the liquid smoke.  I may also finely dice some onions and sauté them then add them to the mix as well.  I like the fact that this recipe lends itself so well to mixing in anything your family likes so you can customize it to your taste easily.  I found that it taste much better on your meat rather then tasting it from your sauce pan after you've finished making it but that's a must to customize it.  I also love the fact that I don't have to plan ahead and run to the store to buy ingredients when I want to make it.  Thanks for a great recipe that's easy and quick to fix, doesn't take a lot of ingredients, taste great and lends itself to tweaking to suit your ow

This is a great  starter recipe. I made some changes. Before cooking I added about a tablespoon of honey,  a teaspoon of garlic powder, and an ounce of bourbon, and extra hot sauce. I brought it to a boil whisking the entire time them simmered it for about 5 minutes. It's really potent but a great sauce for smoking brisket.

I just made this sauce and it is good, but the taste of Worcestershire overwhelmed me. To tone it down, I added, as people suggested, liquid smoke and then a splash of bourbon. Now it is more to my liking. I will make it again, but with changes.

Very simple but delicious! Added a bit of paprika seasoning from another recipe.  It was quick and easy.  Loved it!

Great base recipe just add or change a couple of ingredients and its perfect for anything. I actually did not cook it before using because it was going into a crackpot and it was delicious.

This has way too much worcestershire sauce for me. I added more ketchup and some water to try to dilute it. And a little honey, but still too much Worcestershire flavour. Won't make again.

Loved this sauce for several reasons.
1. All the ingredients are staples in most any kitchen
2. No mess with dishes to clean afterwards
3. It too about 5 min to make.
I didnt change any ingredients as it wouldn't be the same recipe. Its perfect the way it is.

Made this tonight when I realized I was out of my regular go to brand... I will never buy sauce again. This is a great base - and so easy to tweak for different tastes (i.e.: smoke, honey, spicy!) Thank you for the great recipe!

I've never made my own BBQ sauce before, and I love how easy and versatile this recipe is! Hubby bought ribs, but forgot to pick up some BBQ sauce for them. I saw this recipe and gave it a try...WOW! So easy to add or subtract different flavours! I only had white vinegar and prepared mustard, so I used those as per another review...Next time, I'll try omitting the brown sugar and using honey and a few cloves of garlic for a honey-garlic version! Thanks for posting the recipe :)

Very simple and easy to make! I love that it just uses regular, everyday ingredients. I did modify a little bit by adding minced garlic instead of powdered. We served it on chicken with homemade potato salad on the side. Great for a summer BBQ with the family!

I made this but did modify it a bit. I felt the Worcestershire was a bit much so I cut it in half. I added dried onion flakes, some honey, and used prepared mustard. Made it a little sweeter.

Cheaper and more delicious than store bought BBQ sauce. didn't use the mustard powder worked just as well.

My parents keep asking me to make a triple recipe of it every summer so they can use it.

I was so happy to find this!  I used to make this as a sauce for oven baked pork chops with sliced onions until I lost the recipe.  Only thing I added was a dash of celery seed and doubled the sauce.  Thanks for getting this back in my recipe collection, we've missed it!

I started using this recipe at the beginning of summer to make BBQ chicken. My family loved it. Than I made BBQ Pulled Pork (20 lbs for a golf outting) using it.  It was delicious, all the pork was eaten and I got alot of great compliments. I have used this sauce on ribs, as a topping on meatloaf, a dip for chicken wings, cheese sticks and poppers.  This sauce was very easy to make and it really taste great.

This is honestly the only BBQ sauce I have ever liked. I have made a few changes to make it my own. I add Hickory flavored liquid smoke and use white vinegar instead of apple cider vinegar. Also since I simply don't have mustard powder I use ready yellow mustard. I use it on EVERYTHING!

Found this searching for a bar-b-que sauce recipe on my phone at the grocery store after reading the labels of every bar-b-que sauce on the shelf and not finding a single one that did not have high fructose corn syrup!  Even worse, that was the number one, main ingredient in all of them.  I agree with poster "csjpmac" on this issue...like her (or him?) I bought all natural ketchup (Heinz has a good version) which does not have high fructose corn syrup, to use as my base.  Doubled the recipe because I knew I'd need more, then substituted molasses for the brown sugar (which I thought I had at home).  But I used half as much molasses as the amount of brown sugar called for.  My family thought it was sweet enough and loved it (and my teenage son has a serious sweet tooth!).  Also put in about 5 or 6 additional dashes of hot sauce and even a sprinkling of cayenne and it still wasn't spicy hot, to our taste.  Baked boneless chicken breasts in it and got rave reviews!  I do think I'll try adding liquid smoke next time as many have suggested and SLICKENUF's tip to add coffee sounds intriguing!  Won't be buying bottled bar-b-que sauce again!  Thanks for posting this Debi K :)

I whipped this up because I ran out of bottled BBQ sauce. I simmered the sauce for 30 min and added 2 tbs water. This BBQ sauce is simple and tasty. I'd make this again because I always have the ingredients on hand. Bye-Bye bottled BBQ!

We LOVED this!  Made a double batch and should have made more but that's ok.  It just took a couple of minutes to stir together.  We WILL be making this often.  Broiled some chicken breasts till nearly done then added the bbq sauce and baked a bit longer.  Didn't change a thing except maybe one or two more dashes of the hot sauce.  Thanks for the easy and very tasty recipe, Debi K!

This sauce was great! After it had cooked a bit, I tried some and then made a few addons. Instead of one dash of hot sauce, I went for four since we like it spicy. I then added a squirt of honey and it turned out perfectly spicy and sweet. Will make again for sure and might try regular vinegar instead as someone else suggested.

very good. I followed other reviewers advice and added liquid smoke and some cayenne pepper. I did not care for the liquid smoke taste and I wish I didn't do that. I cannot wait to try it again without the liquid smoke. I would keep the cayenne though and maybe add some honey or extra brown sugar because I like my bbq a little sweet. Thank you for the easy good recipe.

A very easy, very good basic barbecue sauce recipe that you can tailor to your own preferences. As it is , it beats store bought hands down

So simple and kid friendly.  Sometimes we leave the Worcestershire sauce out and it still tastes great!  We stopped buying store brands because any flavors we liked have or now have HFCS in them; we couldn't find any that didn't that our kids liked.  Thanks for the recipe!

I absolutely loved this recipe! Thank you so much for posting! I didn't have any Worcestershire sauce, hot pepper sauce or mustard powder so I had to make some alterations. I used hot pepper flakes and mustard with no worcestershire sauce...still came out amazing!

I made this recipe tonight and it was truly delicious! I doubled the recipe because I like a lot of sauce. I followed the recipe almost exactly.  The only changes I made were I used white vinegar instead of cider, prepared mustard instead of powdered because that's what I had on hand.  I omittd the salt because I had already seasoned my meat and I felt the sauce didn't need more of it. I will never buy bbq sauce from the store again, it's really that good!

Use it as a rub.  I poured it over my chicken, then baked it, which thinned it drastically.  It didn't thicken much upon standing.  But it was still kinda tasty.

This was a pleasant surprise....I needed a BBQ sauce and did not want to go to the store so I tried this one.  It has a wonderful flavor and is very easy to make.  I used Cayenne Pepper to taste instead of the hot sauce, and it a nice sweet heat flavor.

Tried this today. We loved it. After making the sauce I cooked up meatballs in the sauce and served it over brown rice. I didn't make any changes to the recipe. I am not sure I will but maybe in future I may take some of the suggestions just for a change of pace.

Perfect bbq sauce! It was easy to prepare and tasted sweet & spicy just the way we like it! It's easy to adjust to your own preference by adding more pepper flakes for spicy or more brown sugar for sweet. I didn't have mustard powder on hand so I just used a couple squirts of mustard from the bottle and it tasted great! Thanks for this great recipe!

This was exactly what I was looking for. Used what I had on hand. I followed another reviewer's tip and used regular vinegar and prepared mustard since I don't like cider vinegar and I didn't have mustard powder. I also omitted the hot pepper sauce because my daughter doesn't like things too spicy. I think the recipe would be great either way, though!

This recipe is the best one I have found for BBQ sauce.  I make a batch per the recipe, and then another batch with some additional heat (he like habanero) for my husband.  It is a big hit.

Convenient ( you have these ingridients ) and much less expensive and healthful compared to pre-made/store bought sauce.

I use Chipotle Smokey Tabasco and also add one teaspoon of smoked paprika.  This sauce is better than any you can buy!

This recipe was much too sweet for my taste. I ended up adding paprika, onion powder, extra vinegar, black pepper, and prepared mustard, and eventually it came out okay. It definitely was not worth the effort to make it; I'd rather just buy a bottle.

This is so easy,fast and tasty. I have added dried onions and spicy prepared mustard. Really easy to adjust to personal tastes but great as written too. It was so good on chicken that Im trying it on crockpot  beef ribs next. No more store bought sauces!

I made this sauce using  white vinegar and regular mustard----it was excellent.  I do not see myself using bottled sauce again.  I think next time I might add chopped onion too.  Thanks Debi for the Great Recipe!

This is the best Bar B Que Sauce recipe ever!!!I have used many different kinds of sauce but making my own feels good. (Sometimes i double the ketchup so it takes just a little of the bite off).

I only came out with about 1/4 cup of this sauce, I simmered for about 10 minutes, was that too long? Well, however much it was supposed to be, it turned out pretty good with a couple of changes.  After reading some of the reviews, I only used 1/2 tbs of cider vinegar and added in about 1 tsp of honey. Will make this again, but will definitely have to double (or even quadruple) the recipe.

Nothing compares to this sauce! I have made it over and over without ANY changes!  Except we dont have ketchup in SA so I use tomato sauce. It is excellent on all types of meat even as a marinade!

the flavor was good - but for me it came out a little gritty. Maybe I needed a few more minutes on the stove? It worked well since I was totally  out of BBQ, but the texture was a little funny for dipping.

I'll admit, I LOVE "Sweet Baby Ray's" sauce so maybe this review is unfair.  I have tried several different homemade sauces and I haven't been too impressed with any of them.  This one is very garlicky and not thick at all.  Of course, it doesn't claim to be thick but I was hoping for something that would stick to my meat.  So, if you are looking for a thin sauce with a strong garlic taste, this is the one for you!

I made this exactly as the recipe stated.  This was great.  I even had to dip a few crackers into this sauce because it was so good.  I cooked chicken legs and a couple of breasts in the oven for about 1/2 hour, then covered with this sauce, baked about 20 minutes more, turned the meat over and covered again.  I am a child care provider and the kids really enjoyed this.  I will make this again.  The dash of hot pepper sauce added a yummy dimension to this sauce, no one said it was spicy.  Good recipe.  (by the way, I did not cook it on the stove, I made it up ahead of time and used it when I needed it).

I had made some pork shoulder roast in my crock pot and when I went looking for bar-b-que sauce I didn't have any. So of course the first thing I do is go here and search it. This is the best home made bar-b-que sauce I have ever tasted. We have done a few changes to suit different tastes. My kids like it with a touch of honey in it, and the hubby likes it with some molasses, dried onion flakes, and lots of black pepper.

This so easy that you never need to buy BBQ sauce from the store again. I always add a little liquid smoke just to give it that just BBQ'd flavor and it is great!

I put this on chicken and it was great.  My husband suggested adding lemon juice, which we did.  Great flavor on the chicken - I wasn't too crazy about the sauce by itself.  I might add less garlic powder next time.

This is absolutely the best made from scratch bar-b-que sauce I have ever tasted.  I mixed all the ingredients in a mixing bowl and poured over boneless chicken breasts to bake in the oven.  Will use the sauce next time to baste chicken on the grill.  Yummy, yummy, yummy.  Thanks Debi K.

I made this today and put it on chicken legs that I baked. My husband is a picky eater so I was hesitant to try a bbq sauce from scratch, but I love this website and the reviews are usually right on. Well it came out great, my husband kept saying, yea this is pretty good. I had to add more ketchup and I added a good bit of honey too. I thought the vinegar kinda over powered it a little, so I made up for it with extra ketchup. But turned out fabulous, no more store bought bbq sauce! Thanks!

This is a recipe that uses ingredients typically on hand, which is why I picked it. However, we didn't care for this. It had too much Worce. sauce for us, and was too sweet.

I made this to put on chopped chicken sandwiches when I realized I was out of Sweet Baby Rays Sauce. For convenience and speed I would rate this 5 stars, for flavor three. It was good, but not great... I did not make any changes the recipe.

Very easy and very good. I cook it with Tilapia. yum.  I left out the salt, hot sauce, and I used Dijon mustard instead of powdered(couple of squeezes).  I was lookin for a recipe that wasnt hot, and i think this is the one. ty

This bar b que sauce was delicious!  I added a few ingredients such as dijon mustard, onion powder, paprika, and some diced onions and made bar b que chicken in keeping with the zesty slow cooker chicken barbque recipe also on this site. It was the best bar b que chicken ever!

As someone who is not generally a fan of BBQ sauce, I thought this was fantastic!  My boyfriend also loved it and he is usually very hard to please.  Next time I make this I'm going to try it with a brown sugar substitute as my boyfriend was recently diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes.  Will re-review then...

Didn't have mustard powder so used prepared mustard.  The finished product was fantastic (my 18-month-old carried off the spoon & kept saying "good, good").  Broiled on ribs, it came out stick-to-your-teeth sticky (taffy texture). Wouldn't broil again.

This was good! My family liked it and my husband said it tasted like Tony Roma's bbq sauc. I left out the hot pepper and used actual mustard and white vinegar. I like my bbq sauce more sweet and this was really tangy. But I liked it and won't buy bbq sauce anymore!

This is a very good sauce.  I followed the recipe and found it to be a littly "ketchupy."  I think I will use this as a base and play with it a little.  I would recommend cutting back on the sugar because ketchup is already slightly sweet.  I don't care for an overly sweet BBQ sauce.  I think I will add liquid smoke because I love smoky/sweet BBQ sauce.

This was very good and quick.  I added followed the recipe exactly and love the subtle tang of the vinegar.  I did add a few extra shakes of red pepper flakes to give it a little kick.  Will never buy bbq sauce again.  This is just to easy and good.

This was the perfect compliment to some awesome smoked brisket and sausage we brought home from a cookout today.  It blended so well with the side of pinto beans and cool potato salad.  As others suggested, I added some liquid smoke and red pepper (crushed, since that's all I had).  Yum!

My 8yr old daughter made this tonight because we were out of bottled bbq sauce.  When it was first made, I was skeptical because I didn't really like it right after being made.....BUT!!!!!......I put it on my ribs anyway since I was desperate, and it tasted delicious!!!! It didn't have the usual smokey flavor but I added a bit onion powder and I was satisfied. Thanks!!! So EASY!!

This was perfect. Used regular mustard and real garlic, added some onion flakes. Perfect on our grilled chicken and much nicer than from a jar. Will definitely use again!

Very good base recipe. I jazzed it up with some of my fav. ing. such as ancho chili, chipotle (dried and ground for both) chili powder and about 1/4 c. honey for a double recipe. It's sweet, spicy and tangy. All the makings of a good bbq sauce. Will definatly use again with other variations. I also love that this sause does not require molassas which is never on hand at my house.

WOW...what a great surprise!  I had just bought ribs and thought I had bottled barbeque sauce on hand.  I was out and decided to look to Allrecipes for help. This recipe uses some very common "on hand" supplies.  The only thing I was missing was the hot sauce but it still came out PERFECT.  My husband and son thought they were just great!  I partially cooked the ribs in the microwave and finished them up on the grill with the sauce...perfection!  I don't think I will ever use bottled sauce again.  Why bother when you can make something this good with so little effort?  Thanks for sharing!!

Great recipe! The weather has been heating up here & I've been looking for something to brush on barbecued chicken. Next time I will leave out the vinegar as I'm just not a vinegar person. I cut down on the garlic to a 1/4 tsp because a whole tsp seemed like too much but next time will brave the whole amount :-). I also used honey instead of the brown sugar. Will make this again.

This is really great base for BBQ sauce;   I gave it 5 stars because of that.  It's fun to play around with because it is so easy.  I like to add liquid smoke and a couple of sprigs of fresh thyme.  You can make it as sweet or as spicy as you want!  That's the beauty of it!  Will be using this from now on.  Thanx
