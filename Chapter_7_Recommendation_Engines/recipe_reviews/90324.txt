The only way I've found to prepare pork chops that results in a tender and juicy chop rather than the usual tough and dry chop.  The hickory chips boost the flavor even more.

These were awesome.  I changed a few things.  Instead of white wine, I used chardonnay because that is all I had.  I cut the sage in half, added a little liquid smoke to replace the hickory chips since I didn't have any, and cooked on a propane grill.  Very yummy!

I have to say it, that hubs is the grill MASTER and always turns out beautifully grilled and juicy meat, pork chops included--and he never marinates them. So it's not the marinade that makes them tender and juicy!  Marinade only penetrates a little more than the surface of the meat. He tried this recipe tonight to indulge my wanting to do something a little different.  While he grilled his usual perfectly grilled chops again, neither of us could taste the marinade, but the hickory flavor was distinct and delicious. I don't know that I would bother with the marinade again since it uses ingredients you can't taste anyway and hate to waste.

I let these marinate for four hours.  We have a gas grill so I added a bit of liquid smoke to the mixture.  These came out moist and tender I think more in part the way they were grilled than the marinade.  The liquid smoke gave the obvious smoky flavor but not much else was going on here. A nice change of pace, but there are too many other pork marinades on here to do this one again. Sorry.

We have a huge pecan tree in the backyard that we grill with. This was good but something stood out too much. Maybe the wine.

This was too bland for us.
Sorry won't be making this again.

I let the pork chops marinate for 6 hours. The pork chops were very tender and delicious.

Smelled great but not much flavor (even though I marinated the chops overnight).  The hickory taste was there but not much else. However, the chops were moist.

It's not an overwhelming flavor, but it is a good flavor.  Absolutely need the hickory chips/charcoal.  Chops were juicy and tender.

Made it with 6 pork chops. Smoking time about 3 hrs. Served with rice & steamed cauliflower. Very good. Will make it again.

I added salt to the chops before marinating and they were delicious will do again.
