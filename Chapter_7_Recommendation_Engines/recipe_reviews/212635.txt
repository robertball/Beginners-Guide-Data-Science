This was a hit at my party.  I thought the bottom needed to be crispy. Next time I'll just grease the bottom of the pan with cornmeal.

I substituted the Campbells cheese soup with Campbell's Fiesta Nacho Cheese which gave the cornbread a little more mexican flavor.  It was wonderful.

It was nice and fluffy. I baked it at 425 for 30 min.  It tasted good but it seemed that something was missing in the flavor...like spice or herbs. I would make this recipe again but I think I would meddle with spices

This was a bit softer and more soggy than usual cornbread. The flavor was alright, but like the other reviewer stated, I missed the hard, sort of crunchy bottom that regular cornbread gets. Not sure i'd try this again.
