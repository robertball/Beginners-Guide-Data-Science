I prepared the recipe in half because I only had one pack of tofu to work with.  (I used the full amount of garlic... I love garlic.)  I cooked in toasted sesame oil rather than olive oil.  It was superb.  This will be a “go to” recipe for me.

This is an easy and tasty method to make tofu. It was delicious served with some sautéed greens but I imagine it would be good in a Buddha bowl. Thank you for the recipe.
