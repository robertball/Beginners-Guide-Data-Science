Made this for Christmas. Beautiful red looked so festive, and tasted delicious. Family loved it. I used two bottles of red wine blend, otherwise followed the recipe.

I just made a sample before my friend's bridal shower and it came out wonderful and refreshing for sure. I used Pinot noir  and Garnacha and less fruit punch. Can't wait for people to try it at the shower :)
