Excellent balance of tastes and quite pretty to display as well. I used fresh pomegranate seeds instead of craisins, which tasted lovely! Great with or without the cheese. Also, it makes a huge difference to massage the kale.

I didn't have dried cranberries, sunflower seeds, or Gorgonzola cheese. I used walnuts and didn't use any cheese. Next time I make I may add some goat cheese. This was an absolute hit for my husband and me. Next will be to make it for some of my picky family!

I made this for the first time just last week as my husband had told he did not like kale. When he tasted this- I am now be making it for the third time.  A few tweaks.. sometimes I use mandarin oranges and my olive oil has been either citrus or blood orange flavor.  It was suggested to use rasberry vinegar so did that one with the oranges.  Used goat cheese too.  This evening, this will be served to our dinner guests while my husbands approval.  What a switch from a week ago!

I made this per the recipe- it was a hit- all gone at the end of the event.  I think you could get away with less olive oil or add more cider vinegar.... And I think massaging the kale was key.  I could tell if was massaged enough by the way the color went from light green to a deep green and the color on my hands!  I like a nutritious salad- this fits the bill!

I didn't have gorgonzola so I used a different cheese, but it would have elevated the flavors even more. I don't like the texture of kale but love the health benefits, so I like trying new recipes and this one delivered. Like the others said, you must massage the kale first!

This was way to salty!  I would eliminate the salt and salt at the table if necessary.  For my taste, I would prefer nuts to the sunflower seeds.  I love craisins and gorgonzola but I still thought this needed some additional seasoning, maybe rosemary?

This is a really easy, delicious, healthy salad.  I omitted the cheese and didn't miss it at all, but I'm sure it's equally good with it.  Great way to use up all of the kale from our garden!

Love it! Followed basic recipe. Subbed raisins for craisins, walnuts for sunflower seeds, and blueberries for apples....all because I really wanted to make it but didn’t have ingredients as listed. It was so good! Added grilled chicken one night . Ate it all week for lunch at work. Just made another batch for this week! Thanks for a yummy recipe??

Wow, what a difference it makes when you massage the salt into the kale! I also added a little honey to the mix. It was delish!

Made this exactly as written but did not care for the sunflower seeds at all! Used roasted unsalted sunflower seeds but for some reason they were super strong (sort of tasted like burnt oil) which overpowered the whole salad.  Couldn't eat more than one serving. :(  I've had this issue with sunflower seeds before so next time I'll just use walnuts.  The dressing is very nice, although, next time I'll go with a lighter oil and add a teaspoon of sugar  just to add a touch of sweetness.  So, I'm not giving up on this salad! It's stunningly beautiful and super healthy!

Don't know about it being the talk of the potluck, but it certainly was talked about with us.  It was delicious!!!  I did substitute the kale with some power greens and the sunflower seeds with cashews just because I was so anxious to try this recipe that it was all I had on hand without going to the grocery store.  Kept everything else the same.  Just used what I thought was the right amount of salt and other ingredients for the amount of greens I had on hand and it was perfect!!  10-27-18

I made it with toasted walnuts, pomegranate arils, and feta instead of sunflower seeds, crasins, and Gorgonzola and it turned out great! Our family BBQ ate it all up! I love that there’s so many combos of this that work. Maybe I’ll change it up again next time. Definitely a keeper.

Yummy! I had lots of kale and was running out of ideas, so this recipe was perfect. Without running to the store, I used what was on hand, namely golden raisins in place of the cranberries and toasted almonds in place of the sunflower seeds. Also used raspberry balsamic for 1 T. of the vinegar. The only other change I made was to reduce the salt (can't use a whole tsp.) on the kale and sprinkled it with 1 T. of the vinegar before I massaged it. Worked great. I made it early, refrigerated for a couple of hours before dinner and it turned out perfect. I think I will bring it to my book club picnic this week.

Excellent salad.  I used feta cheese, since I had I on hand. Dried cranberries instead of pomegranates.  Nice dressing.

Made it for 4th of July potluck.... Many compliments... I added Blueberries for color and was a hit... Wish Pomegranates were in season - I'd have added those as well... What a healthy option for parties... Loved it!  Will definitely make it again!

Delicious, easy, beautiful colors! I used thin slices of honey crisp apples, pine nuts (no sunflower seeds in my pantry!), and crasins.  I could have halved the dressing-I also sprinkled a little bit of straight apple cider vinegar to add to the tangy-ness of the flavor.  Massaging the kale with salt definitely made a big difference-don't skip this part!

Decent. I had an amazing kale, apple, and radish salad from a local catering company and was looking for something similar. I got distracted and forgot to rub the salt into the kale until after I had assembled the salad, whoops! I'll experiment with other fruit over the summer depending on what comes in my CSA box. Thanks!

This recipe is really easy to make, and presents well.  I added a touch more cider vinegar than the recipe called for and used bleu cheese rather then Gorgonzola.  A great way to get in your greens!

Great salad, we both liked it.  the fiancé even said " YOU HAVE TO make this for my parents"  That alone says a lot, as they are very particular.  We will definitely make this again. its so easy and you will get credit like its restaurant quality.  Next time I may try it with pears or strawberries, the options are unlimited. 

Thanks Steinbachtroop for the recipe
