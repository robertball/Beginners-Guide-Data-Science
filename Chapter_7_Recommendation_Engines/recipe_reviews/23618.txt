My noodles turned out well overall. The main complaint I have with this recipe is that no ballpark amount of water is indicated, and I initially added too much (even though I've made similar egg noodles before). I had to add a lot more flour to counteract my mistake, and it may have impacted the flavor. To dry these noodles faster I spread them on cookie sheets and put them in an oven set to 175 for about 35 minutes. It worked very well. I suggest making a big batch (maybe double or triple) and freezing them to keep on hand so that you can have homemade taste without all the prep work each time!

Easy to make and traditional home cooking at its best, my family went wild for these noodles in simple chicken soup.

Although I used the recipe as a rough guideline (I'm one of those cooks that dosen't really measure anything unless baking) it's easy enough for even a novice cook to make an excellent meal.  Being single it's easy to slip into eating fast food day after day, but having simple and easy to follow ways to make childhood fravorites saves not only money, but also our health.  Thank you for the Recipe (I never had made egg noodles before, despite cooking nearly every day for almost 6 years)

This is the way my mother and I made noodles, with the exception of the furham wheat flour. The rolling and cutting instructions are right on.  Drying is important.  I've always liked my noodles quite thin but never even guesstimated the thickness.  These, when dried will freeze very well so you can always have them on hand when you need/want them.  Thanks for the post cause "the old ways" are being forgotten along with the art of cooking.

Great recipe when you think that you have them rolled thin enough roll them more.  I cooked them fresh stir gently and be sure your broth is at a good rolling boil.  Do not over cook.

I don't know what I did wrong, but these noodles turned out terrible, too hard, not a good flavor.

Tasted pretty good.  I used 5 eggs and maybe 1/2 cup water.  I think I rolled them to thick.  But I'd try it again.

I have made homemade noodles all my life. My mother taught me when I was a young kid. I use 3 ingredients; 1 cup flour, 1 egg, 1/2 egg shell of water (few more drops as needed). mix to tight mixture adding bit more flour/water as needed. Flour counter, roll dough as thin as you like, cut into strips as wide as desired, cook until desired doneness. Enjoy! Can also use this recipe for ravioli and lasagna.

This recipe resulted in perfect noodles for my Chicken and Noodles. I second the other reviewer's advice: "When you think you have them rolled thin enough, roll them more."

I will definitely make it again! I added approximately 1/4 cup wheat bran to the recipe just to make it healthy and add fiber. This recipe is right on! Rolled them out nice and thin and cut the slices and threw them in the broth. They cooked up great and tasted yummy!! I didn't have durum flour but am definitely going to get some soon. I do appreciate that you posted this recipe since I had lost my original recipe from my family recipes. My sister used to make these all the time and her kids and I would roll, cut and drop them in the broth. Reminds me of old times. Thanks for the memories.

Very tasty!  I used all purpose flour , and I didn't add any water. The moisture from the eggs made it plenty workable for me. Instead of salt, I used onion salt. Cutting the dough into quarters, makes it a lot easier to roll out.  I also, allowed them to dry. They are a tough noodle, but I like my noodles like that. Will definitely make again.

did not work for me with just rolling it out with rolling pin.  Not at all like egg noodles you buy, not even close.  may try again with pasta roller.  I thought they tasted like thick cardboard, but my daughter and her husband did find themselves snacking on them afterwards.

Uploaded a pic of Homemade Chicken Noodle Soup I made today.  Overall, texture is good if you know just how much water to use to get the perfect consistency for the dough.  I used a pasta machine to roll out and slice the noodles to my desired thickness.  I personally added a bit more salt, some pepper and thyme to flavor them a bit more.  I would also suggest a tablespoon of butter (although I didn't this time, I will next time) as it does help with noodles sticking together when you place in the boiling water.
