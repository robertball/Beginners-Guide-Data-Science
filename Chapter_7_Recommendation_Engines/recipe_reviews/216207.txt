Yummy! I even made them with light margarine, egg beaters and low fat cream cheese.  My kids love them too!  I accidentally added both teaspoons of almond to the batter but the more almondy the better!

i love almond, so these are delicious.  the trick is to set your almond slivers together very tight, as the cookie expands as it bakes.  i am still working on the technique..more work than i expected but worth it.  made the recipe exactly as described.

OMG!  I thought I was eating a gourmet poppy seed muffin.  Who says you can't have just the tops?!  Obviously, my cookies were very soft 'n  cake like and maybe wouldn't have turned out that way had I read through the baking instructions.  I just placed the cookie balls on the baking sheet and baked.  (They flattened on their own.) Then when I glazed them, I stuck the almonds in the wet glaze so they would stick to the cookie.

I love almond flavor, so I thought these were delicious. I didn't change a thing and I don't think any changes are necessary.

Although the texture and appearance were great, I did not like flavor that the cream cheese added to it.

I made this last night with my daughter.  Delicious in every aspect.  Sort of crunchy (with the almonds), and soft in the inside...great tea cookies!!!

I thought it was a fine cookie especially since it started from a mix.  I was a bit apprehensive using the full amount of almond extract, only because a previous recipe was overwhelmed with the almond that was in both parts of the recipe. I only put 1/2 the amount in both parts here. I will make this again and increase the amount of almond to see how I like it. I admit once I had one, I couldn't stop!  A good cookie with  good body.
