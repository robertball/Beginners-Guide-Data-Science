This is exactly the taste I was looking for.  Paired it with my Traditional Sauerbraten for a home run.
If you don't have a press or ricer, the (traditional) way my Grandmother did it was to put the dough on a cutting board and then "slice" small pieces into the boiling water.  It's hard to explain, but basically she would cut about a finger's size of dough and scrape it to the edge of the cutting board.  Works great with this recipe!

Quick and great.  I use a plastic bag, nip the end and then squeeze it out and use a scissors to cut the length I want!  Good with pot roast, sauerbraten, or in place of dumplings in chicken and dumplings!

Great Taste and easy to make. Served it with pork schnitzels, gravy and corn on the cob! I halved the recipe. German Hubby love it-will definitely make it again!

My great grandmother made a soup called "ripple soup" it had the same noodles. It was made with beef and a beef bone. Wonderful. I can't believe someone gave this a bad rating saying it has no flavor. It's a pasta!! I drop mine in small pinches to boiling stock. Amazing

Son never eats noodles, put cheese and butter on his, I made pork and gravy with these and was thrilled. Reminded me of a German friend who used to make these... Super easy

I followed this recipe to the letter and, having made spaetzle many times in the past, the batter seemed to be a bit too soft.  I probably should have added more flour when I saw the results but I forged ahead and, using a spaetzle press my wife rescued from the trash when we were stationed in Germany,  ended up with a large portion of smallish noodles that tasted okay.  I certainly wouldn’t be using this recipe for kaese spaetzle or with a hearty mushroom white sauce.

I made these with sauerbraten for Christmas. They turned out great. I had to add water though to make the dough thin enough to press through a colander. I think I'll try the plastic bag and scissors next time!

I didn't have a spätzle press or a river so I tried to drop in small globs off a spoon and I found they were really watery. I'm not sure what happened.

This is a great receipt! My family enjoys spaetzle with Swiss cheese and Caramelized onions! My husband could eat the whole dish if I'd let him.
