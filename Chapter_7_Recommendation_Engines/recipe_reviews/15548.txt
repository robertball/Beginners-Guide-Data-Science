This is a very good hot chocolate mix.  I did as others advised and added chocolate pudding mix to mine...I added two boxes to the full recipe.  I would also have to say that the appearance was a little on the lumpy side.  There was no problem dissolving it, but to make it look "prettier" if you are giving it as a gift, I would send it thru the food processor or blender to get rid of the powdered milk lumps.

Very yummy drink mix!  I decided to make this to give as Christmas gifts, so I had to taste it to make sure it was alright.  After a couple cups, I figured out the problem.  The ingredients are just fine (actually, as another review suggested, I added some pudding mix to it), but the instructions were a little off.  It tastes the best with 4 tablespoons instead of three, so I'll be sure to suggest that when I give it to people.  Other than that, it tastes as if I had made up a pot of hot chocolate from scratch!  Much better than store bought.

This same recipe has been in my family for years!  My 3 yr old just loves it!  I actually use a tall kitchen garbage bag to mix it, then cut a hole in the end to pour into containers.  Enjoy!

5 stars when made with a box of instant chocolate pudding and a teaspoon of salt. Tastes great and makes a great gift. I filled mason jars with this, topped with marshmallows, and gave as Christmas presents to co-workers. FYI this recipe filled 9 (8.5oz) mason jars.

This is a very Yummy hot chocolate!!  Added a box chocolate pudding mix per half batch and used rounded measurements on the NesQuick and creamer. Very delicious and easy to make! I think I will try with vanilla or hazelnut creamer next time for a twist on a classic.  Thanks for this recipe!

I gave this mix with a batch of scones for holiday gifts.  Everyone enjoyed it. It seemed a little thin until I added the chocolate pudding mix to it then it was much more creamy.  I even cut out a lot of the added sugar and subtituted an artificial sweetener and it tasted just as good as the original.

After taste testing several hot chocolate mixes this recipe won!  It was not too chocolately and not too bland (which was the problem with other recipes). A keeper!

This mix is amazing! I'm skeptical of homemade mixes, but this tastes great. I followed other reviews and added chocolate pudding and 1 tsp of salt. It tastes just like store-bought and my children and husband approve.

After losing my mom's "secret family recipe" for hot chocolate mix, this one is just the same!  YUM!  I would add about a tsp. of salt, (sounds weird I know, but it seems to enhance the flavors.)  Also, we always liked to substitute flavored non-dairy creamers if we were making the cocoa for gifts, but leave it plain if we were making it for everyday home use and add flavored liquid creamer later.

It tasted kinda watery with only a mild chocolate flavor so I added a couple more ounces of creamer, a total of four boxes of pudding mix, 1 1/2 cups more of powdered sugar, a cup of granulated sugar and a cup of cocoa powder. My daughter discovered that it has a very creamy taste and consistency when made with milk instead of water. Nice basic recipe to build on.

As written, this recipe is worthy of giving as a gift for the holidays. But, a couple of alterations put it over the top! I added a box of instant pudding as suggested by others, which gave it a wonderful creaminess. I also threw in a little Herseys Special Dark baking cocoa...WONDERFUL! I whizzed it in the food processor for a bit, to give it a nice smooth consistency. It dissolves nicely that way. This is a gift, so I taste~tested a cup before shipping, adding a sprinkle of cinnamon to my cup...Soooo good!  I'm sending this with mini marshmallows and coconut macaroons III from this site. Merry merry!

Made this twice. As written, and then with the addition of chocolate pudding and a pinch of salt. I found it too watery both ways, but better tasting with the pudding. Won't make this particular recipe again though.

This cocoa is fabulous!  I made it for our very large extended family for Christmas this year, and I think it's great.  Only gave it 4 stars because I think it is a bit on the sweet side, but I like it that way :)

Just a few notes:  I followed previous reviewers suggestions, adding the package of pudding mix and 1 tsp of salt.  

Due to the size of our family, I doubled the recipe, so if you need a whole bunch, here is what I did:

I used one (30 ounce) container of the chocolate drink mix.

The powdered milk packages didn't correlate to the measurements listed in the recipe, so I did a little math and figured out that out of my 64-ounce box of powdered milk, I needed to remove 5 1/3 cups in order to be left with the 51 1/4 ounces of powder that I needed for my doubled recipe.

Doubled, this recipe yields approximately 21 cups of cocoa, so can make quite a few nice gifts for extended family/friends/neighbors.

I would also definitely recommend blending or processing this mix so that it is more uniform in both mixture as well as texture; if you use a flavored creamer, I would opt for the sugar-free variety, as I think this may be where some of my super-sweetness came from.

And, finally, 4T of mix are a must for hot water; however, if you use milk, 3T is just perfect!

Whew - that's all I have to say!

This recipe was just ok. When prepared exactly as specified, it is too watery & not chocolatey enough. To make it creamier, I added two boxes of chocolate pudding mix, and to make it more flavorful, I added 2 tbsp salt & 1 cup unsweetened cocoa. I also recommend 4 tbsp added to 8 oz of water, or use milk!

Growing up we called this "Girl Scout Hot Cocoa" because we always had it when we went camping as scouts. Now it makes a great gift to mix up and give in a holiday container. I think it is much better than the envelopes of cocoa mix you buy at the store.

I made this today to give away as Christmas gifts to coworkers.  I did as the other reviews suggested and added the box of pudding and cinnamon.  I also used double the hot chocolate mix and about a cup of cocoa powder.  Unfortunately I still didn't find the hot chocolate--chocolatey. If I hadn't, I am afraid it would have tasted like sweet hot milk.  I was looking for something really rich and decadent that you can't get out of a packet, but this tastes just like the extra creamy swiss miss with a touch of cinnamon.  Still yummy, dont get me wrong, just not really that special.

I made this for a Halloween party and thought it was very good.  It makes ALOT!  I added the chocolate pudding as some have suggested and found I still needed to use MUCH more mix than the recipe calls for to get a chocolatey cup of hot chocolate.  It's much butter than the store bought.  I didn't process it in the food processor as someone suggested and didn't have ANY problems with lumps.  In fact, I'm shocked at how easily it dissolves in water.  Good recipe. Will definitely make again to have on hand throughout the winter!

Not impressed. Definitely not chocolate-y enough. I ended up adding 2 pkgs of chocolate pudding, like others suggested, and 1/2 c cocoa, and still didn't like it. Won't be making this again.

If the crumbly appearance of the dry milk bothers you, try using Morning Moo's milk (augasonfarms dot com), which is in a true powder form.  Great recipe!

Thanks, Judy! This is the best hot chocolate mix I've ever had! I did put 2 chocolate pudding mix which makes it just right with lots of marshmallows! Also, when I was a little girl, my mother made me homemade hot chocolate every morning with milk, cocoa, sugar, and 1/8 teaspoon of salt. (Salt brings out the flavor of chocolate.) So I put 1/8 cup (yep, that's cup) in mine! I don't see how a teaspoon of salt would do anything for this large batch of mix!

More snow today, so I thought what better way to warm up than with a nice cup of hot chocolate.  Reduced the amounts to make enough for just the one glass.  Not a bad mix at all, maybe a little to sweet and not as creamy as I like but overall an enjoyable drink.

Even after adding two boxes of pudding mix it still wasn't chocolatey enough.  I added a full can of cocoa and another cup and a half of confectioners sugar to the recipe and it finally was good.  I gave this out as client gifts along with homemade marshmallows and got wow reviews!

Very good hot chocolate!  I followed the advice of others & added 2 boxes of chocolate pudding mix.  I had to run the finished mix through the food processor to get rid of the powdered milk lumps. Turned out great!

I lost my recipe for hot cocoa a few years ago.  The only change is i used 1 box of cook and serve chocolate pudding in it gives it that extra chocolate flavor i was looking for.  All in all the family loves it thanks

What a great recipe!  Followed the advice about adding flavored creamer and a box of chocolate pudding.  Easy to make and warms you through and through.

Yum!  My husband and I made a double batch of this and packed it in pint jars with a layer of mini chocolate chips.  We tied a few strands of raffia around each jar and attached two hand-made tags with directions and a Christmas greeting then gave them as gifts.  Many of our relatives and friends are tired of sweets by the end of December, but this hot chocolate will last all winter.  It was a big hit!  Thanks!  Oh, DEFINITELY add the pudding...so much better.

This recipe is great with a couple additions!  I followed it exactly and then added 2 boxes of jello cook and serve pudding mix and 1 tsp. of salt.  And if you mix a cup of hot water with about 3 heaping teaspoons of mix and add some mini marshmallows it is perfect!  I tried another highly rated recipe and it was horrible!!!  My kids wouldn't even drink it!  This one is perfect AND a lot cheaper and easier to make!!!  I used the food processor to make it smooth, (the dry milk is pretty lumpy otherwise) but it dissolves great in hot water even if you don't have one or don't want to take the extra time to do it.

Love this hot chocolate. I add the pudding mix and use one tablespoon per 2 ounces.  12 oz cup gets 6 tablespoons.  then i top it with whipped cream and drizzle it with chocolate syrup.  Everyone loves it!

This recipe is in serious need of at least 1 cup of cocoa powder or more. Not very chocolatey at all without it. With that, it's quite yummy.

We just made this for a hot chocolate stand my girls were doing and the overall reviews from the kids who attended were very good. Definitely a kid pleaser! We mixed the recipe as is, didn't try adding pudding as some suggested, but I did use a chocolate flavored coffee creamer, so I'm sure that gave it an extra chocolate boost. I also used the 4T/1cup ratio that many of the reviews suggested. This one will be a keeper for us!

I tried this recipe, and I doubled the amount of sugar, thinking that 3tsp for 4 cups was too little. I used a non-premium brand of chocolate. Either because of the chocolate, or my messing with the recipe, it was too sweet! So for those tempted to up the sugar level, don’t! A wonderful drink!

One recipe makes a large batch.  I ended up adding 2 regular sized instant chocolate puddings that several people mentioned.  And since I couldn't find a 16 oz container of chocolate mix, I used the whole 30 oz container that I did get.  (After testing it first with just amount in recipe) DH said it still needed a little more. So I added about 1/4 dark chocolate cocoa, but I am not sure that it made a huge difference.  I would like to try it next time with flavored creamer, or add cinnamon. I think it makes a good mix and hope my friends like it too.

I made a half recipe, added one box instant chocolate pudding, as others had suggested, but still found it watery and bland. Adding 1/3 cup more sugar and 1/3 cup cocoa powder helped. I will not make this again and stick to Swiss Miss Cocoa and Cream.

My sister and I followed this recipe to a T and it tasted like creamer-water. We ended up adding another cup of confectioners sugar and another entire container (32 oz all together) of the chocolate drink mix. Then it was okay to drink. Won't be making this again. The only plus side was that it came out very pretty when we bagged it up.

Very pleased with this recipe! Processing in the food processor is essential as it smooths out any lumps usually found in the powdered milk - yuck. I used equal instead of sugar. I also made this recipe using "Special Dark" cocoa for my husband who LOVES DARK chocolate - he thought it was great. For the dark cocoa version I used equal again and added an additional 1/4 - 1/2 cup of the creamer.
I don't advise using the special flavored creamers - stick with the plain creamer.
Again, VERY pleased with this recipe.

I was really excited about this recipe, but when I made it just tasted like sweet milk, not very chocolaty.  I even added the chocolate pudding like suggested.  I was very disappointed.   I am better off just buying it from the store.  I only recommend if you don't like your hot chocolate to taste like chocolate.

Wonderful recipe! I had many compliments. I had to save a couple jars for myself because my husband really liked it. He never drinks Hot Chocolate! Thanks!
