My husband & I really liked this simple pasta dish. I was hungry for something with pesto.  I made my own for this; my recipe produced about a cup of pesto and I ended up using it all; 1/2c didn't seem like enough.  I'm not used to using crushed red pepper flakes so wasn't certain how much to add; did about 1/4 tsp and it was just right; might do slightly more next time.  Sprinkled parmesan and toasted pine nuts on top of each serving.  YUMMO!  Thanks so much, Kristin! (My pesto recipe: 1/2c evoo, 1c fresh basil leaves, 1/2 tsp salt, 2 garlic cloves, 1/2c toasted pine nuts, 1/2c parmesan; blend all together in blender or food processor.)

I have made this so many times!  People ALWAYS will ask you for the recipe!  The pesto sauce I use (classico brand) has tons of garlic, so I don't add any extra. Using bowties is a good idea, the sauce sticks good to this shape.  The sundried tomatoes in oil are the best, chopped small, with a little extra drizzle of the oil.  Adding fresh parmesan makes it happen!  Makes lots, cause it gets gobbled up!

This is a good recipe.... I made a few modifications - I used 16 dry-packed sun-dried tomatoes instead of oil-packed (soaked them in boiling water for 3-5 minutes and then coarsely chopped) and added a handful of toasted pine nuts (omitted red pepper flakes though). Very easy and tasty.  I used half of a 270mL basil Classico pesto, if that helps anyone. :)

This was so delicious and easy to make!  My husband and two year old loved it.  I used the olive oil from the sundried tomatoes to cook the chicken in which gave it a great flavor.  Next time I will add more sundried tomatoes and some roasted pine nuts too.

Quick and easy to prepare! I cannot wait to make this again. Definiately throw a few toasted pine nuts on top of the dish as well as some shredded fresh parmesan. I have also made this with chicken tortellini and it was also excellent.

I made this recipe last night, and both my husband and I really enjoyed it.  As others, I made a few changes - I used the oil from the sundried tomatoes, and I know I used more than 1 teaspoon, more like a couple of tablespoons - next time, I think I will saute in some chicken broth to cut the fat .  I also added some slice crimini mushrooms, some sliced roasted red peppers, more sundried tomatoes, and a sprinkle of parmesan. After the chicken and mushrooms were cooked, I tossed in the sundried tomatoes and red peppers, then tossed in the cooked whole wheat rotini pasta and the pesto, while keeping the pan on low. Tossing in a bowl would have been nicer presentation, but it was just the two of us, so I had one less bowl to wash.   I have never been a pesto fan, but I liked this.  It was not the best, as in 5 stars, but real close, It was relatively quick and easy to make and I will definitely make it again.

I have often made a different pesto/pasta/chicken recipe from this site and enjoyed it. I thought that I would try this out to compare. I think it beat out the competition because my husband went for seconds (he NEVER does) and my 3 & 5 year old both told me that it was very good. I followed the recipe for the most part except I added 4 chicken breasts instead of 2 and sauteed the garlic and chicken in 2 tbl of oil from the sundried tomatoes, not olive oil.

Instead of using 'additional' olive oil, I used the olive oil marinating the sun-dried tomatoes to cooked the chicken in. It had all sorts of spices, including garlic and oregano...yummy! Also tossed in some thinly sliced red onion in the end, which was a great addition to the flavour!

This was a winner in our house!  The whole family loved it!  I did use whole wheat pasta and I marinated the chicken in a little Italian dressing and Pesto Vinagrette dressing.  I also did not use oil to saute the chicken, I used a tsp. of the oil from the sun dried tomatoes.  I served it with a green salad and everyone was happy!

Great dish. My husband loved it! Very easy to make after a long day at work (and it is good the next day for lunch too). When I have more time, I may try to make my own pesto, but Contadina worked for me!

I have been making this for several years and always use home made pesto. Sometimes I use dry packed sun dried tomatoes and soak them. I marinate the chicken (time permitting) in italian or balsamic dressing. If I have a zucchini I cube it and saute to add some veggies. Also if I have no fat sour cream will add a couple Tablespoons to the pot which makes it a bit creamy but doesn't change the great flavor. Since the pesto has parmesan I add feta to the finished dish. My grandson's favorite meal.

I always want to rate the recipe as it is presented.  I believe the amount of pesto sauce should be doubled/tripled.  With that being said, I made my own pesto sauce and it was wonderful.  Great idea to add chicken & sundried tomatoes.

This is STUPID SIMPLE and my family did BACKFLIPS!  I used six frozen chicken tenders, 1/4 c. of diced red onion in the garlic sautee, folded in about 3/4 c. fresh-from-the-garden tomatoes (omitted sun-dried), and topped with Parm AND toasted pine nuts.  NEXT TIME: Nine chick tenders, 3/4 c. pesto and my other changes!  YUMMMM!

Like others, I only used the oil from the oil-packed sun dried tomatoes to fry the chicken. I made the meal for four, and used 2 Tbs and 2 tsp of sun dried tomatoes. As I learned later, the amount of oil that came with this amount of sun dried tomatoes was too much and pasta was a bit too greasy. Next time, I would use less oil.

Oh my goodness! I made this in half an hour last night after a long day at work.  My husband loved it and he is usually a strictly steak and potatoes kind of man.  I will definitely be making this again.  Couple changes- I added mushrooms and some chooped onions to the skillet while cooking the chicken and used a little wine to add flavor.  I also chopped up the sundried tomatoes so that they would be dipersed throughout the dish.  I added asiago cheese and actually mixed it in so it would be melted.  Overall this was fabulous!!

If you really want to take this dish over the top, try cooking the chicken breast cubes in seasoned rice vinegar and chili pepper (eyeball it -- the sauce should look red and soupy)...deelish! Ppl always ask me for this recipe.

Nice quick recipe!  Like previous reviewers, used the oil from sun dried tomatoes instead of olive oil.  Used leftover rotisserie chicken, added more chicken.  Had to use more pesto, since added the chicken.  Also added red pepper flakes to give it some kick, and topped with Parmesan. Really tasty, would definitely cook again.

No flavor for our taste. It was good but boring. Not much more to say. 

Edit after leftovers: there was 3 servings of leftovers since there is only 2 of us. It was missing salt and pepper. We salted before we reheated and it was fine. The pesto needed a day to sit on the pasta. Much better the next day.

This was absolutely delicious!  I have had this recipe in my recipe box for a while now and now wondering why I waited so long to make it.  My husband and I both agreed that it tasted like something from a resturant.  I did add a spoonful of extra pesto because it was just a little dry.  I used the Kirkland Brand Pesto sauce which you can find at Costco because it was REALLY green and fresh looking unlike some of the other premade pesto sauces I saw at the grocery store.  We will definitely make this again!

WOW!! Delicious! I also used the olive oil from the sun dried tomatoes to cook the chicken. I was cooking for 2 family's so I used a total of 5 small chicken breasts. I added a can of mushrooms (drained) and a whole jar of pesto. I didn't alter the pasta and still had leftovers. When it was all mixed and finished I grated some fresh cheese I had picked up from whole foods earlier that day. I served with an amazing salad. Perfect meal!!

This was fantastic!  I used a weightwatchers pesto recipe and the dish came out really great.  A new family favorite.  I made it a second time with shrimp and it was also really good.  I rehydrate dried sundried tomatoes instead of oil packed to cut down on fat and cook the chicken in the oven before and add to the skillet toward the end.  I also used whole wheat penne both times.  Great!!

I add sauteed asparugus tips and don't forget to top with some Parmesan.  Also, keep the pasta water to thin the pesto a bit if you like.  This is so good!  The sun-dried tomatoes are a must!

This was delish-- so much so that hubby and I "fought" over the leftovers!  I did add a 9 oz bag of fresh spinach to this (trying to get more veggies!), so I included a little fresh grated nutmeg (waaay better than the pre-ground stuff) and some of the pasta cooking water as well to "loosen" everything up.  The best part was how quickly this all went together, since I used store-bought pesto (Trader Joe's).  I'll definitely be making this again!

I used whole wheat pasta, Giada's (Target) Pesto and about 1/2 teaspoon crushed red peppers. I think this was ok. We ate it, it wasn't terrible but it wasn't great. Maybe using another pesto brand or a homemade pesto.

Very excellent! I used a reduced fat pesto sauce and whole grain penne pasta. Both my hubby and myself loved it! Fresh tasting and a great alternative to the usual red or alfredo-ish sauces!

I thought this was a really delicious dish.  I used just regular seasoned canned tomatoes and added them to the chicken mixture so they could all season and cook together right at the end.  Red pepper flakes give a nice little kick, and I definitely used the entire pesto packet for the 1 lb of pasta.  

Very tasty...boyfriend had 3 helpings.

This was really flavorful, but as is, I found the dish a bit dry. I even held a couple cups of cooked pasta out. The solution was to add a little chicken broth. Perfect! My family enjoyed it. I did top with shredded Parmesan and a sprinkling of pine nuts, which added a nice flavor.

I've made this before, and I agree it's the magic 3 (cheap, fast, good). The key to it is to GRILL (as in out on the BBQ) the chicken after a light coating in olive oil. The low smoke point of the olive oil adds a really nice smokey flavor to the chicken that adds a new dimension to this dish.

So easy and delicious!  I sauteed the chicken in the oil from the sun-dried tomatoes and added in some sliced mushrooms.  Then I tossed in some baby spinach when I mixed everything together. I used the Cibo pesto from Costco, delicious!

Fast, easy & tasty.  I had stored chicken in the freezer in a balsamic salad dressing marinade and used this.  I also had some fresh baby spinach I needed to use up, so stirred several handfuls in at the end.  Leftover pasta was a bit dry and I didn't have any more pesto sauce, so I added a bit more of the balsamic dressing and had it for lunch the next day.

Just tried this recipe tonight, it tasted yummy and was easy to make. I did as some other reviewers did and cooked the chicken in oil from the sun dried tomatoes, and also added some thinly sliced red onions while tossing it all together, otherwise followed the recipe as is. So good and full of wonderful flavors. will be another one in my rotation....

Tasty but not enough chicken for my meat-eating family.  So next time, I will be sure to double the amount of chicken used and maybe add some spinach.  Otherwise, the flavor was delicious and everyone loved it.

Delicious. The best pasta recipe I've found so far on this site. Often times I find myself adding ingredients for more flavor but this recipe was fantastic as is, no changes necessary. I will make this again and again.

I made this last night and it was good. I cook for my sister and myself and we both liked it (I must say that I surf the internet for recipes because she is very picky about what she'll eat and has a very limited palate, so I am constantly looking to add variety while cooking something she will like and eat).  I did alter the recipe some because it just didn't seem right. Number 1 was the amount of bow-tie pasta--I cut it in half. I flattened the chicken breasts and cooked them in the olive oil and garlic then removed from pan. Then added about 4oz. each of sliced mushrooms, grape tomatoes, and sliced red pepper to the pan and sauteed. Then I chopped the chicken into bite size pieces and combined all ingredients in a bowl with the pesto (from Costco, 1/2 cup plus 2 tbls). Garnished with fresh basil leaves, pine nuts, and parmasean cheese.  Added a side dish of steamed broccoli.  It was really delicious.  I really get my inspiration from the comments to the recipes on this site. With that in mind, I decided to write this, my first comment. Thank you to all of you fine cooks who take the time to write comments. I'm hooked.

DELICIOUS! Family loved this. Made pretty much as the recipe states, except for using Dreamfields pasta because it is a low carb pasta,and cutting down on the red pepper flakes (personal preference), but other than that everything was the same. I like the fact that it is low in sodium and cholesterol too.

What isn't good with pesto? Right? I loved this. I am gluten and dairy free so I substituted the bow tie pasta with brown rice "spaghetti like" pasta 12oz. I was worried that 4oz less pasta would be an issue, but it was not. Not at all. I left out the sun-dried tomatoes (I just had them last night). I used an entire cup pesto, as opposed to 1/2c.  I also only used 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes. Next time, I will use more. Much more. I couldn't taste it. Maybe closer to a TBS. Not to over-do it because red pepper can steal a dish if over used.  The brown rice pasta actually gave this dish an extremely creamy texture. Which I absolutely loved. After boiling pasta, drain and rinse with cold water, but not too much. Just for 30 seconds or so tossing it with your hand. I added a dash of sea salt right before serving. Topped with toasted pine nuts. And YUM. I will make again.

I use Basil Pesto and add some shredded or grated parmeson cheese to the mixture, then add some Origianal Classico Alfredo sauce and use Penne noodles (any type of pasta is good). No tomatoes or red pepper flakes.  This is a hit with my family, a six quart dutch oven is devoured by 4 people at one sitting.

Fast, easy, and tastes good!  You can make it really spicy with the amount of red pepper flakes you decide to sprinkle in.  I went very light on them, since we don't care for much spice.

Great, easy recipe. I make my own pesto to use in this recipe. I saute sliced mushrooms and some onion to add with the sundried tomato but I want to experiment with asparagus, red peppers etc. my family loved this dish and has requested I make it many times since. Quick tip during the summer make extra pesto while basil is abundant and freeze it, its so much better than the store bought stuff!

This was super easy. I made AS IS.After we started eating it my husband recommended more pesto so we did 10 ounces. This recipe is simple but delicious. I did read a review that said they added Italian dressing. I did that to my plate and thought it was quite delicious. I will make this again. ( when extra grocery budget Pesto and sun dried tomatoes not terribly cheap)

This was just ok.  I added some italian dressing to give it more flavor.  We are going to have it for leftovers and are going to add garlic salt and butter as well.  We ommitted the tomatoes as I am not a tomato fan.

I omitted the tomatoes as I can't eat those. I also purchased a pesto sauce that I mix with olive oil and water. Cheaper way to go and it still taste great.
Was worried this would be bland but it is very good.

So easy and so delicious!  The only thing I would add would be some asparagus. Also, I eliminated the tomato because my kids won't eat it with that.

Pasta was great.  Once I got all the ingredients it was pretty quick.  I would add a little more sliced sun-dried tomatoes.  They had a great taste but needed just a few more. I also added a few mushrooms.  They just added to the flavor.  Great recipe.

I found this a little bland.  I only used a 12 oz box of bowtie pasta and it definitely needs more pesto, more tomatoes and twice the chicken.  Parmesan and extra salt helped, but there really was just too much pasta.

This is superb.  Looks like something straight from Tuscany, dark and rich.  As others suggested, I added mushrooms, red pepper and parmesan, and reduced pasta to 10 oz for 1 lb of chicken.  Will definitely make again.

This was SO good and easy to make!  I simply used one leftover cooked chicken breast that I cut into bite-sized pieces.  I didn't have sun-dried tomatoes, so I added a 1/2 cup of frozen peas to give it some color.  I used a 6 oz. jar of Trader Joe's pesto.  Perfect!! :)

This was fantastic and restaurant quality.   I used fresh seeded and diced tomatoes since I had a garden abundance.    I also used fresh made pesto from the basil in my garden.   That really makes a difference in the quality of a dish.   DH and I each added garlic salt to our dishes for added flavor.

This is a keeper and one we will make often. 

Thanks for sharing.

This is a great recipe.  The chicken could use more seasoning.  I will make this recipe again, but will marinate and grill the chicken first.  My husband LOVED it!

An easy delicious favorite - great for simple dinner parties, buffets or a casual dinner in.  I usually make with homemade pesto and add a handful of toasted pinenuts and loads of grated parmesan.  Also, cook the chicken in a bit of the pesto and the oil from the sundried tomatoes.  The first time I forgot the peppers and really missed them - they add an extra punch to this recipe.

This is a great if you have lots of Basil growing. I also made a few modifications.  I used 3 chicken breasts and fresh pesto sauce (from this website).  Also, be sure to use the sun-dried tomatoes that are in the olive oil.  Otherwise they will be tough at first (but good once reheated as leftovers).  I served with garlic bread and wine!  YUMMY!  My husband really enjoyed this one!

I cooked this tonight for dinner for my boyfriend and our roommate and there were no leftovers! It was a delicious dish and I followed the directions as written. The only difference in mine was that my local supermarket didn't have sun-dried tomatoes in a can so I used 1/3 a cup of packaged sun dried tomatoes instead and diced those up with the pasta. After I mixed everything up together, I sprinkled parmesan cheese over it and mixed it in. This dish was delicious and took no time to throw together. This is definitely a keeper.

I made this a few days ago and I think it has promise. Next time I make it, I will use about half the amount of pasta, more garlic, mushrooms parm and Italian seasoning. As it is, there's just too much pasta and not enough flavor.

I tried this tonight as a friend of mine recommended it.  It was great, my husband loved it!  I also made a couple changes based on what I had on hand.  I had some sun dried tomato pesto as well as basil pesto(from Sprouts Natural market pre made).  I used the oil from both the basil and sun-dried tomato pesto to cook the chicken with the garlic, then added some sliced mushrooms and some sliced roasted red bell peppers. Once those were slightly wilted, I added the two different pestos (about 1/3 C basil and 1/3C Sun-dried pesto) I put the cooked pasta into the pan with all the other ingredients to absorb the liquids and added about 1/3 cup of grated parm/regianno.  Served it up with more Parm and it was awesome!  Be careful not to add too much cheese as it was a bit salty.

I make this all the time when short on available cooking time.  I usually make this with linquini, but any pasta would work really.  Also, although I prefer homemade pesto, the brand I found to be the closest to homemade is Del'Alpe brand.  Not a lot of 'extra' unnecessary stuff added to it.  Add some fresh broccoli to the pasta water when it is about 1/2 way through cooking and you've added a vegetable!  You can even leave out the sun dried tomatoes and red pepper flakes if you don't have it or like it.  A must to top with Parmesan or Romano when serving.

Substitute shrimp for the chicken and add the broccoli for an even tastier dish!

I normally made two separate meals every night to accommodate our three children; our youngest is a picky eater. I made the pesto from a dry packet I bought in the sauce aisle; I am not a fan of “already made” foods. All the children tried it after it was done and it was a HIT! I already fed the kids something else that night, but after the youngest tried it, he told me to add it to his favorite meals to cook for him. This was so easy to prepare, the smells are delightful and between the appearance and taste, you would never know how easy it was to put together. The only change I will be making is not using a full package of sun-dried tomatoes, they were overpowering the flavor of the dish and we ended up eating around them.

This was a very good recipe, and relatively low sodium and fat, for the flavor.  My teenage girl made the recipe for me, since I was busy, so you know it's easy!

Good. I followed the recipe as written. After the chicken was cooked I removed it from the skillet and added the pesto to the pan with the sundried tomatoes and warmed it up a bit and then added back in the chicken.

Not too bad. I enjoy this type of pasta, however with the given measurements, it was not enough flavor. We doubled the amounts of sun dried tomatoes and added a bit more pesto. Still a good choice.

Made the recipe as is a group of teenaged athletes and they loved it; came back for second and third helpings.  To me, it still needed something as I felt it needed salt, but didn't want to any. Will make again.

I made this for a cooking group and it was loved by all.  I made my own pasta sauce (I ended up using 2/3 c) and added freshly grated parmesan cheese and toasted pine nuts to the top.

I made this last week for dinner and it was really great.  The only substitute I made was I followed the recipe exactly but I put it all in a baking dish then put it in the oven for about 20 minutes on 350.  It was wonderful, my husband and I loved the flavors.  Very easy and yummy!  This is a definite keep!

So easy to do, and great tasting! Had large jars of sun-dried tomatoes and pesto from Costco that needed using up and I came across this recipe. Will definitely make again, hubby loved it.

This was pretty good.  Everyone seemed to enjoy it. I gave 5 starts because I think it would be outstanding if you don't use whole wheat penne pasta like I didn (it was what I had on hand).   I did use homemade pesto (emmerill lagasse recipe).  It definitely made the difference.  It didn't add too much to prep time and was definitely worth it.  I had been looking for a recipe like this for a while.  Thanks.

This was great.  I did not have the sun-dried tomatoes on hand so I used 2 cupes of grape tomatoes quartered instead.  I used black pepper instead of the red pepper flakes and let my husband put on his own red pepper flakes.  This was quick and easy.  A new twist on pasta.

Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I made a few changes to this recipe.   I only made this for 4 so I used 1/2 the box of bow tie. I used 3 garlic cloves. I used the oil from the sun-dried tomato jar to only cook the chicken a bit then added white wine. I put about 1/4 of a cup and then simmered the chicken for 10 minutes---wonderful flavor and very moist. I used double the amount of pesto and sun-dried tomatoes. I mixed it all and then added some of the white wine mixture from cooking the chicken just to add flavor and moisture. (I hate dry pasta). I also added a hefty amount of parm cheese, grated, didn't have the good stuff.   My family ate this in moments and wanted more. My husband is VERY picky and he loved it!!

This gets five stars because it's so easy and everyone in my famiy liked it (a rarity). I held off on the red pepper flakes until I served it because my husband and I like food spicy but not my kids. I did add a little salt to taste. I served it immediately and it ws not dry, but the leftovers did get a little dry.

Super amazing! Made the adjustments others have, as far as cooking with the oil from the sundried tomatoes. This is just fantastic. Served with rotini because that's the closest my store had to bow tie. Although I'm not new to the kitchen, I highly encourage those who are to try this. It's so easy and gourmet (not low fat but that's what running is for:)

I just made this last night and my husband is sitting here beside me finishing off the leftovers! I can't give it enough stars!!  The only things I did differently - I cooked the red pepper flakes & garlic together, I rubbed Emeril's Chicken Rub on the chicken before I cooked it, added the sun-dried tomatoes to the skillet just before the chicken was done, and added some Essence and fresh cracked black pepper after I combined everything in the bowl.  My entire family loved this and it's definitely going to be a staple dinner through the summer!  Thanks for sharing!

Delicious and not difficult.  After reading the reviews, I also added a red onion (I usually throw in onion and garlic whenever I can).  I used spaghetti just because that was what was available.  I also used the oil from the sundried tomato jar (as another reviewer suggested).  I toasted the pine nuts before adding them at the end.

We loved this.  I used store bought pesto, but I am going to try making my own next time.  Followed the other reviews and cooked the chicken in the tomato oil, added some fresh mushrooms and cooked the chicken, tomatoes, and mushrooms in the oil and some chicken broth then added it to the pasta and pesto.  Mixed it all together and we loved it!  My hubbie said that this was a reasturant quality meal and he would want me to serve it when we have guests over!  Thank you for such a great recipe

I suggest to double the amount of sun dried tomatoes, and add some adobo seasoning to the chicken before cooking.   Also, add the oil from the sun dried tomatoes to the frying pan (along with the olive oil)  so the chicken will be more tasty.

This was excellent. The only addition I made was artichokes. I served it over 4 cheese tortellini because that was what I had at home and it was phenomenal. I will definitely make this again!

I enjoyed this recipe. I tweek it a bit. I added fresh mushrooms and tomatoes. Instead of combining it all at once I did plate by plate. Some people liked mushrooms others didn't..that type of thing. Also added the extra's with the chicken and garlic so the flavors would fuse and chicken not dry out! Next time I'm going to try it with a white wine instead of oil and maybe some shrimp!!

Very quick and easy to make.  My family loved it.  I used store bought pesto and sun dried tomatoes.  The tomatoes add just the right amount of tang.

Big hit when my family came over.  A bit oily at first, but then the oil kept it from being dry after it sat a few minutes.

Delicious!  I didn't have bowtie so I used penne.  I didn't have sun-dried tomatoes (which i'm sure would've been delicious) so I added roasted red peppers.  It was delicious - my husband had thirds(which is rare for him).  I highly recommend this recipe.

This was GOOD!  I finely chopped the tomatoes to make it easier for my husband with braces to eat.  Also, I used whole grain pasta to make it healthier.  Very tasty.

decent ... very simple, which i like.  I used about 1/2 cup of grape tomatoes sliced in half because they sounded better than sun dried (and easier).  The 1 tsp of olive oil was perfect for cooking 2 chicken breasts although I didn't think it would be enough.  Next time I'll probably add black olives and maybe some salt.  I also served with a salad topped w/ homemade french bread croutons and an olive oil dressing.  My friend came over and ate it with me and got a huge helping of seconds.  Good recipe idea!

Made this recipe tonight and everybody loved it!!!! I added Roasted Red Peppers and Red Onion! I cooked the red onion w/ the chicken. I cooked both in the oil from the sun dried tomatoes and it was very tasty! I used the Lawry's Pesto Sauce and it was great!!! I will make this again in the future for sure!

Oh my Gosh, this recipe was excellent and so easy to make!! The only modifications were using LadyJayPee's homemade pesto recipe and when cooking the chicken, I added more salt, a little bit of lemon juice and garlic powder. My friends LOVED the meal, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SHARING!!!

I enjoyed this recipe, but mostly because it was quick and easy. I got a lot of good reviews on it, but I felt it could have used a little more flavor. I added feta cheese and if I were to cook it again I would add more and definatley make homeade pesto instead of using pre-made.

This was awesome--i have past this recipe to all of my friends and we love it!!!  I did make a few small changes---I doubled the sun dried tomatoes--doubled the pesto--added sliced zuccini(while cooking the chicken)-and left out the red pepper flakes --then topped it off with shredded parmesean cheese--there was none left!!!

Loved it! I used the oil from the sundried tomatoes as suggested. I also added more garlic. I had to be careful not to make it too oily from the pesto and sundried tomatoes...I'd suggest to drain out the oil as much as possible from the sundried tomatoes. Such a simple yummy pasta dish!

I was preparing this last night for my husband and I, and our two kids and their spouses showed up, so I doubled the chicken.  Everyone loved it and even with a few hearty eaters, we had plenty left over.  I served it with salad and garlic toast.  Will definitely make this again - might try marinating the chicken in Italian dressing and grilling it first and adding some mushrooms.

Quick, easy to make and so delicious! I substituted fresh cherry tomatoes for the sun dried tomatoes...chopped them in half and tossed in with chicken, olive oil and garlic mix when chicken was just about cooked. I also garnished the dish with fresh shredded parmesan cheese before serving.  Soooo good.

Note: I took the advice from other posters and just used an entire bottle of pesto.... so worth!


I thought this was a delicious recipe! I definitely would put double the pesto than it says, but it deserves 5 stars for being an easy, delicious meal. My very picky sister who has many food allergies really liked this simple pesto pasta and tried to claim the entire bowl for herself!

Thank you very much, will make again!

My kids went wild for this!  I followed recipe almost to a tee.  I did add a whole can of sundried tomatoes with the oil (instead of draining it).  I also used gemelli pasta the 2nd time I made it.  Great both times!

I love, eat it once or twice a month now, very easy and tasty. Good tip to make the pasta al dente. Don't be afraid to use a full 1/3 cup of the sun-dried tomatoes. I had never used these before so on my first try I did about half the recipe calls for, now I add a little more. Thanks Kristin!!

I had roasted a chicken and cut it up for a different dish and when I found this recipe I thought I would do it instead. Very good. I had put fresh dill into the chicken (other recipe) but that didn't hurt anything. I also used Classico pesto and used all of the 8 ounce jar.
 Will likely make again.

Husband and two teenage boys loved it. I loved the combination of flavors . I used Dreamfields low carb penne pasta and a package of julienned sundries tomatoes with no oil. Plenty moist. A keeper.

LOVE THIS! But can't give it a 5 as is. Because I tweak by using whole grain penne pasta, diced tomatoes with basil and fresh spinach. The nutty-ness from the pasta compliments the dish nicely and is (currently reported as) better for us. The tomatoes and spinach add color and nutrition but also helps to stretch the portions. Topped off with shaved parm chesse! YUM_YUM_YUM!

Wow!!! This was amazing and so easy! Definitely going into my rotation. I actually stuffed the chicken breast with cream cheese, Italian cheese blend, pesto and Canadian bacon (kind of like a cordon bleu) top with a little more pesto and baked the chicken before adding to the pasta. I can't wait for left overs! A beautiful, impressive and inexpensive meal-can't go wrong with that!

I used stew tomatoes drain them really well and I didn't have chicken breast so I used thigh meat and for me it needed more seasoning salt but that is just my taste. But over all very easy to make. I will definitely make again
loved the Bow ties.

I made this tonight.  I read the reviews and "tweaked" as I thought needed.  I, also, cooked the garlic and chicken in the oil from the sun-dried tomatoes.  I added mushrooms and asparagus to the chicken mixture, and cooked till they were al dente.  I then poured the pasta, pesto, and sun-dried tomatoes into the same pan (where I had cooked the chicken) and heated through.  I put fresh parmesan on top and served.  Very good!

I had leftover pesto in my freezer and this was such a perfect recipe to use it up. I followed the suggestion to saute the chicken in the sundried tomato oil--don't really know how much it impacted the taste but it's cost-saving! I used about a tsp of red pepper flakes because I wanted it extra spicy. I just wish I had more pesto--I think 1 cup would be a good amount. I will definitely make this again!

Super yum! All the guys loved it! I did triple the chicken, double the other ingredients but left pasta the same. Hungry family always wants more meat. Served with hot out the oven garlic bread and caesars salad. Thanks!

Very easy to make! My husband and I absolutely loved it. I did make a couple small changes. When I cooked the chicken I added some garlic salt and black pepper and used about a tablespoon of olive oil. I made my own pesto sauce and ended up with about 1 cup. I used the entire cup as I thought after mixing half of it that it was not enough. My husband and I do however really love the flavor of pesto. I will be making this many more times. The next time I'm going to try adding shallots to the chicken.

A little boring but gets the job done.  Extra pesto and sun dried tomatoes would make it yummier.

Really great recipe! Even my father loved it and he's not the gourmet type! I made it with my own fresh pesto sauce and our own home-made sun dried tomatoes! If you use spaghetti instead of other types of pasta, you'll need more ingredients for the sauce and chicken. I also poured some sour cream in the sauce, it was more creamy and smooth tasting! Loved it

I made this tonight.  Used 1/2 jar of sun dried tomatoes, drained, sauteed the chicken in the sundried oil with 1 tsp of garlic salt, ant pepper.  Cut into 1 inch bite size pieces with 4 cloves of garlic minced.  Sauteed for about 14 minutes, then added the sun dried tomatoes and pesto, a nice hand full of Romano cheese and about 2 tbs of evoo. Sauteed, cooked pasta, took one lade full of pasat water, added it and reduced to a nice thin sauce with a bit of a kick.  Major hit!!!

We absolutely love this dish!  Even the picky 16 year old eats the leftovers. I've made this as a potluck item multiple times and everyone raves about it.  Besides adding more garlic because we love it, I sauté the garlic and chicken in oil from the sun dried tomatoes...adds great flavor and the smell is wonderful!

I made this night before last with homemade pesto with basil from our garden, minus the sun-dried tomatoes. I hadn't seen this yet, and thought I had created something great. I guess great minds think alike. :o) Next time, I'll add the sun-dried tomatoes. That should kick it up a notch to make it even better.

Wonderful quick meal. I bought skinless chicken breast and wrapped them in plastic wrap and used my meat mallet to thin them out so they would cook faster and be juicy.. I hate dry chicken! Fortunately I saw my mother  using a meat mallet  growing up and everyone always wanted to know what her secret was to her meals being soooo juicy! After I cooked the chicken I added it to my pasta and then while the skillet was hot, I put the pesto sauce in the pan to warm it up along with a little can of peas and three diced sun dried tomatoes...after one minute I added this mixture to the pasta and chicken...I mixed it altogether then added 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese and put  the lid on the pot so it would melt really well...this was amazing!!!!!! My husband really enjoyed it and my neighbor happen to come over to borrow something so I offered him a plate and he said it was great!!
Great recipe and if you enjoy sweet peas, add some, it really has a great taste w/the pesto!

Good flavor but dry. I did add red pepper with my red pepper flakes and made my own pesto. I could have add more pesto to make it not so dry, but it might have made it to strong. I think I should just stick with the fatting cream pasta dishes. :)

This recipe was so easy to make, and so quick also! I used dried sun dried tomatoes instead of oiled because that is what I had on hand, I also cooked the sundried tomatoes with the chicken and garlic but still absolutely delicious! I have portioned it off to bring to work for lunch every day!

Super yummy! I improvised with some yellow squash slices instead of sundried tomatoes, and mixed alfredo sauce with the pesto for a creamy sauce. Take it easy on the red pepper flakes.

A little dry for my taste, but very good. When I went to have leftovers, I put some shredded mozzarella on top which dressed it up a bit.

This is awesome! It was very easy to make.  I added onions to my meal and cooked along with the garlic.  I also used a little bit of the oil from the sun dried tomato jar with my extra virgin olive oil.  I bought a jar of basil and pesto sauce from my local grocery store and used more than 1/2 cup. I would make this again!!!

This is a great recipe!  Quick and easy.  I would recommend a bit more pesto, maybe 3/4 of a cup instead.  Anyway, it really good.

Such a simple dish, lightening fast and so tasty!  I added roasted red peppers in addition to sun dried tomatoes to the mixture and made the pasta from a comibnation of bow tie & elbow (pantry leftovers).  May add some basil or oregano next time (which there will be one).  BF went back for a full plate of seconds :)

I instead sauteed cubed chicken with sun dried tomato paste and tossed with pesto on spaghetti pasta. It was the best pasta dish I've ever made!! Definitely making this every other week for my husband and often for my family and friends.

It was a great dish although the chicken was tasting a little bland so I added some salt and pepper while it was cooking.  A family favorite!

I have made this many times as written. I always add more pesto just because my family likes extra sauce. Also, I have used diced up Italian tomatoes, or fresh tomatoes in place of the sun-dried for a fresh flavor. One of my family's favorites.

This was very good as is. It will become a regular recipe in the rotation of weeknight meals. And it is very versatile. You could add veggies, beans, and so many other things. It is a good base recipe to get creative with.

Delicious! I find it very easy, yet versatile enough that I don't get bored with it. I have made it a few times, and while I added all  the ingredients listed, I also had fresh tomatoes or mushrooms I was trying to use up so I added those too. My picky boyfriend loved it too.

Made this exactly by the recipe. It was very good, but a little dry. Next time I will use a little of the pasta cooking liquid and maybe it will keep it from being dry. But flavor was very good and will make it again with a few modifications.

This was so good!  Easy to.  It had a great flavor and my husband and son loved it.  I added more sundried tomatoes because I like them (my son didn't eat them) and I used penne pasta because I forgot to buy the bow tie pasta.  I will definitely make this again and again.

Absolutely delicious, and easy--my recommendation would be to add a tablespoon or two of the water the pasta is cooking in to the pesto--it heats it up a little, and makes it saucier!!!  My rating is five stars.

We loved this!  Even my picky children!  We don't like sun-dried tomatoes, so I substituted with Kalamata olives.  I made the pesto from scratch with an entire plant of basil leaves, some olive oil, 3 cloves of garlic, a handful of parm and some pine nuts.  Adjust to taste.  Yum!  Thanks Kristin!

This was super easy to make and we loved it.  Re-heats well also.  The only thing I did different was used 12oz of pasta and used chicken tenders instead of chicken breasts.  Absolutely will make again!

Love this recipe.  However, my family & I aren't big fans of the roasted tomatoes.  I subsitute them with the canned petite diced tomatoes with garlic.

Very easy and very tasty... I did not use any of the oil because I cooked the oil dried tomatoes - undrained, garlic in the jar (which has oil) and the pesto sauce all with the chicken.  No need for oil - but if gets dry just use a little bit as needed.  It was great.  Also, I sprinkled it with parmasean cheese after cooking.

Had to omit the sun-dried tomatoes due to not having any available. The recipe still turned out well, though the tomatoes were definitely missed.

I recommend topping the pasta with Parmesan cheese (freshly grated, if possible).

I have to admit i used this more as inspiration, and made a few small adjustments. I did not have farfalle on hand, but had 1/2 pound of mini farfalle. I added diced onion, and additional sun dried tomato. Once the chicken, garlic and onion were cooked, I added the sun dried tomato and pesto to the sauté pan with about 1/2 cup of the pasta water. Once that thickened, I added another 1/2 cup of pasta water, and a package of frozen peas. The pasta water created a nice sauce. Turned out very well.

This recipe was delicious and a huge hit at a dinner party! The only thing I changed was to add a lot more pesto than the recipe called for. Thanks for the recipe, Kristin!

Great Recipe!  I thought it was very easy to make.  I changed it slightly by adding a little more onion and adding a few sun dried tomatoes during the cooking on the chicken and then again in the pasta/chicken bowl.  I would next like to try and make pesto from scratch instead of using the store bought Buttoni.

Delicious and very easy! I omitted the red pepper flakes (not a fan of spicy) and the sun-dried tomatoes (didn't have on hand). This dish feeds an army! I used the pesto sauce recipe titled "Easy Pesto Sauce," and I think using fresh pesto sauce definitely makes a difference. Very easy and quick recipe!

This is a really good recipe! I love pasta of any sort and chicken! I made a few tweaks though which I thought made it a little better! Instead of heating the chicken in the pan, I grilled it instead yes this takes a little more time but it's worth it! I also added some sauteed mushrooms and onions :). I wasn't able to find sun-dried tomatoes so instead I got some grape tomatoes cut them in half put a piece of mozzarella cheese and seasoned them with dill them added them at the end for a couple of minutes for flavor and color!

The whole family enjoyed this yummy dish. It was very quick and easy! I did substitute the Oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes with Dry sun-dried tomatoes (they were half the price) simmered in boiling water 3 minutes, drained, then added 1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar, 1 tablespoon of olive oil and 2 tsp. of fresh chopped oregano.

It was alright I might make it agian when I get bored of everything else but it was a bit too oily I would probably get dry sun-dried tomatoes next time. I also added more to add some flavor. The Classico pesto worked well but again it was overall just too oily.

We LOVE this dish!  We did not have sun dried tomatoes so wee used regular fresh tomatoes instead, and added artichoke and fresh chopped spinach.  It's a great way to sneak in a bunch of veggies without noticing them!  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and I made this dish last night and it was delicious! It was so easy to make and the flavor was amazing. We made a few changes though, we used a rotisserie chicken from the store and also used linguini noddles instead.

This was very interesting and new to our taste buds! I cut the amount made from 8 servings to only 3, but I dont think it made a difference. Ive been cooking (like recipe cooking haha) for only about a year so im not sure what to do when I want to make changes. What I wish it had was a little more juice/sauce. It was just a little dry. Any suggestions? Other than that, it was amazing. My husband said, "Babe, im so proud of you!" Made me blush.

I thought this was a pretty good recipe as written, I used my own pesto too so perhaps that was it, but I found it a bit bland.  I did add some freshly grated parm to add some extra flavor, but I likely won't make again.

5 stars!!! I ate so much I got a stomachache. It's SO good!!! My boyfriend loved it as well. I will surely be making it again! I also used modifications that were suggested by other users here. I used a can of already cut mushrooms and sauteed the garlic + mushrooms in the oil from the sundried tomatoes. Delicious!!!

Yum yum yum!  I stumbled across this recipe after I bought a jar of pesto sauce, wanting to find a good recipe to use it in.  I was not disappointed.  Very flavorful and delicious.  I omitted the red pepper flakes because I didn't want that particular flavor/heat added.  I would definitely recommend this dish!

This is a really simple quick meal.  I used the oil from the sun dried tomatoes to cook the chicken.  I've made this for multiple occasions and there is never any leftovers!

Awesome dish!  Even my SUPER picky 6 year old ate it...except for the tomatoes.  I added pine nuts, per suggestion of another reviewer.  Yum!  If you made this without chicken, it would be a great summer side dish at a bbq!

What a fast, easy recipe!  I made this last night - my first allrecipes.com creation - for a dinner party.  We had another couple over and wanted something simple for a nice Spring dinner.  We sat outside, drank Chardonnay and enjoy this pasta.  It was perfect!  I did add a little more pesto than they recommended.  You can't miss with this.  I even recommend serving this cold for a picnic!

Good Recipe! Needed more Olive Oil for cooking the chicken. Used Wheat Thin Spaghetti in the place of the Bow Tie Pasta & Added more Pesto Sauce.

Great fast and easy dish!  I sauteed the chicken in the sun dried tomato oil as other reviewers suggested and it was great.  I also threw in the sun dried tomatoes into skillet a few minutes before the chicken was done.  I think this helped the flavor of the tomatoes really come out in the recipe.  The pesto I bought came with a little over 1/2 cup so I just added it all and it was not too much.  Next time I may use even more sun dried tomatoes because my husband and I really love them. I also topped mine with pine nuts and Parmesan cheese. Yum! Overall, really fast and easy recipe. I will be adding this to my regulars!

I used fresh pesto made from another recipe...I agree with cooking the chicken in the oil from the sundried tomatoes. Amazing! (I did not use pine nuts because they were so expensive in my store.)

I didn't have any sun-dried tomatoes so I left them out. Great combination of flavors! I used whole grain penne and light pesto to make it healthier.

Soo good! I used this Classico Sun-dried Tomato pesto and it turned out delicious. the chicken was a little on the bland side though... next time I will add more seasoning.

This is a quick and simple dish. We like it with more pesto and more sun-dried tomatoes than listed in the recipe. When I remember (not always) to cook the chicken the night before, it becomes a really fast way to put a delicious pasta dish on the table quickly.

This is absolutely one of our family favorites, however I will never use prepared pesto sauce again having made it from scratch.  The pesto you buy in a jar at the grocery store tastes processed and there is a noticable difference when you use FRESH ingredients.  The fun thing about pesto is that you can use various types of nuts, cheeses and herbs provided you are willing to use the food processor. For basic pesto - I use fresh basil, Parmesan and Romano cheeses, garlic, fresh pepper, pine nuts and olive oil.  As you can see, it is simple to switch out any one of these ingredients (or add to it). For example, try walnuts instead of pinenuts or spinach instead of basil, other herbs, etc. Create your own master piece! I recently purchased my own basil plants because we use fresh basil in evertying from salads to sauces.  Enjoy!!!

Tried it last night and my boyfriend and I LOVED IT!  I was afraid of the red pepper flakes so i added just a pinch next time i will add more and more Sun Dried Tomatoes 1/2 cup.  I also added a pinch of oregano and some garlic powder (it really wasn't garlicky at all) The taste was great. I made my own pesto sause and toasted some pine nuts and added them to each plate.  Ladies you know what a good feeling it is for your man to appreciate your food. Enjoy

This is delicious. I've made it twice. I used sun-dried tomato pesto and added extra garlic. I imagine you get a different flavor depending on the type of pesto you use. I will try it next time with the traditional basil pesto. This also reheats very well. It is almost better the next day.

I made this dish for my boyfriend and our friend. They loved it! They both had second servings and we still had leftovers. I used 3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts and next time I will probably use 4 as the leftovers consisted of mostly pasta and not much chicken. I seasoned the chicken breasts with salt, pepper and italian seasoning and used the oil from the sundried tomateos to cook them in. I used farfalle pasta as suggested by another reviewer which made for a very nice presentation. I also served with pinenuts and grated parmasan cheese. I used Contadina pesto from the refrigerated section of the grocery store. Great recipe. Quick, easy and tasty. What more could you ask for after working all day. I will definitely make this again.

I made this and it was easy and delicious. We had company over and the presentation was beautiful. I made the pesto and omitted the garlic and pepper flakes when cooking the chicken because we had kids eating and the pepper flakes would have been too much for them, and the homemade pesto already had 3 cloves of garlic. I love garlic, but you can have too much. Everyone, from the kids to my very pick husband loved this and requested to have it again and again.

A super simple and quick recipe...plus it's healthy!  Instead of using the pesto and the sundried tomatoes I used a pre-made sundried tomato pesto sauce instead.  It was excellent!  I also used wheat penne for the extra protien and fiber and my husband couldn't tell the difference!

This was excellent! Next time I would add more chicken and sun-dried tomato.

I absolutely love this recipe!  I had to make a few modifications, we used penne pasta, and we didn't have the canned sundried tomatoes, so I chopped up a fresh tomato and added a little sundried tomato and oregano dressing for the flavor.  I didn't use oil to fry up the chicken since I was using the dressing.  I also added extra garlic, and we wanted to make the sauce a little creamier, so we added about a 1/4cup sour cream, and some milk until there was enough sauce for the amount of pasta we cooked.  Delicious!

This was quick and easy.  Next time I will either omit the sun-dried tomatoes or not put as much in, as I don't really love the taste of them.

5 stars for being delicious, easy, and good the next day! Instead of using oil packed sun dried tomatoes, I used the dry ones that I had on hand and threw them in the boiling pasta water for about half of the cooking time. I added more oil to the chicken instead to make up for it. Second time I used homemade pesto - yum!

It's hard for a pesto dish not to take delicious. I received a jar of pesto as a gift, but it turned out not to be as pungent as I would have liked. I also bought dried sundried tomatoes, and simply soaked them in a bowl of warm water while I cooked the chicke. They were fine and tender by the time I mixed all of the ingredients.

This was an excellent and easy dish.  I just made some minor changes to the stated recipe. I used 3 chicken breasts, and I didn't have sun dried tomatoes but did have roasted red peppers and substituted those.  Then I used only 8-9 oz (1/2 box) of whole wheat rotini and added about 1/2 cup of feta cheese.  Makes a great weeknight supper. I served it with asparagus and a cool Chardonnay.

This recipe has a lot of good ideas, but the execution is a little lacking. For one, I halved the amount of pasta and I still thought the recipe was a little on the bland side. Adding some spices (salt,pepper,oregano) to the chicken before and/or while cooking makes a big difference. Also, the recipe calls for cooking the garlic and then cooking the chicken with the garlic still in the pan. In my opinion, that will lead directly to overcooked garlic. Cooking the chicken and then the garlic leads to a much tastier dish.

Added some cooked broccoli to the mix. I also mixed the ingredients at the end of the recipe in the skillet all together and sautéed it a bit. It was great!

Such a simple and delicious recipe!! I used oil from the tomatoes to cook the chicken, a generous seasoning of red pepper flakes (they add the perfect spice but it’s not overpowering at all) and a whole jar of Classico pesto (218ml) and we loved it! I do think the recipe is better is better with more pesto than called for, however it does state to adjust to your liking so it worked out perfectly with the jar size I bought-I used the called for amount of sun dried tomatoes because I’m not a huge fan of them but they’re easy to eat around my husband loved them in this dish! You could use more or less to taste. We served with some fresh grated Parmesan cheese on top and loved it! I think the type of pesto you use will greatly influence the flavour of this dish, and I’m sure it’s even better with fresh, but for a quick and easy weekday meal we enjoyed it with Classico basil pesto, and it didn’t turn out oily like some other reviewers found. Will be a regular recipe in our house!

DELICIOUS!!  We had bought some fresh pesto from a farmers market and were looking for a new recipe to try.  Stumbled upon this one & will certainly be making it again. I followed the recipe as noted, with one exception, added diced red onion to the chicken/garlic mixture. For serving, topped with fresh parm & basil. Leftovers are just as good, too!

This is a super delicious and easy dish. Like others, I made a few minor adjustments: I sautéed  the boneless chicken breasts whole before cutting it up  which made them pjuicy. I added chopped yellow onion and garlic to the pan with the red pepper flakes for a couple minutes before I added the chicken to sauté. I sprinkled the chicken with Italian seasoning, salt and pepper. After the chicken breasts were cooked through, I removed them to a plate and tented. Then I added asparagus (cut in 3 piieces), a few tablespoons of sun dried tomato bruschetta (so they were already chopped up) to the onion garlic mixture, sautéed that all together and added a bit more red pepper flakes. When the asparagus was al dente, I removed the pan from the heat. I cut up the chicken and mixed everything (including accumulated juice from chicken) with the pasta and homemade pesto (used an easy NYT pesto recipe). Added fresh parm, salt and pepper and voila! A fine restaurant quality dinner. Will make again and again!

This is a nice easy weeknight meal.  We happened to have some prepared basil pesto.   It was very tasty; I highly recommend.  I'll definitely make this again and add some artichokes or asparagus or some other veggie to make a complete meal.

This recipe was good and quick.  My family doesn't really care for sun-dried tomatoes so the suggestion was made to replace those with mushrooms.  Maybe next time I'll change the chicken for sausage or even shrimp.  Lots of great ways to make this recipe for your own tastes.

Since it's hard to truly evaluate a recipe if you've changed it, I made the recipe as is.  It's got a good flavor & is quick to put together--great for a weeknight meal.  My granddaughters (5&7) both liked it really well.  I will make the dish again, but will use more red pepper flakes (w/o the grandkids) and probably drizzle EVOO and parmesan over the dish before serving.  Good, easy, quick dish with good flavor.

This was super easy, super delicious! I used shrimp instead of chicken. Sautéed shrimp in oil from tomatoes. Husband loved it. Even my very picky mother-in-law had seconds.

I didn’t have bow ties so I used shells  not a fan of sun dried tomatoes so I didn’t use them. I just wanted something quick and simple and this was perfect

Very good and quick. I didn't have sun dried tomatoes, so made it without, and added more garlic to suit my taste. I served it with some garlic bread and side salad. I will definitely be making this again.

Absolutely delish!! & it's quick and easy to make!! Thank you to the original creator for this wonderful recipe as well as other reviewers who suggested on omitting the olive oil because the recipe already has enough oil in it. (from the sun-dried tomatoes & Classico Pesto Sauce). I was in a hurry so l used frozen, cooked diced, chicken. It turned out so flavorful!!! I will be cooking this again & again!!!

I give this a 3.5.  I was really excited to make this for my family because of the great reviews.  It was good, but my family and I did not enjoy this as much as I had hoped.  After reading the other reviews, I doubled both the chicken and pesto sauce. My husband, two teenage boys, and preschooler all said it was good (when asked by me) but nobody went back for seconds. (When they love a recipe I make, they go back for seconds and compliment the dish without me asking.)

Very easy! WIll make again, next time for company, perhaps. While it's not this recipe, adding artichokes, spinach or asparagus to it would be easy (once the asparagus are cooked just a little to get them to al dente when you toss all the ingredients together). Crusty bread is a must to balance the textures and compliment the tastes (but I love bread anyway)!

Made the recipe exactly as stated and found it to be a bit dry. Added more pesto, more dried tomatoes, pine nuts and a dash of Parmesan cheese which did the trick.

Super simple and tasty quick weeknight meal.  Kids loved it.

A few changes:
-Used Barilla Gluten Free Rotini (holds up well)
-Double the pesto (Used pre-made Kirkland from Costco)
-Added Salt and Pepper to taste

I made one change to primarily enhance the appearance.  I sauteed whole chicken breasts in the oil from the tomatoes.  Then cut it crosswise into strips and sauteed the strips in the oil for a couple of minutes to give them a nice golden look.  Then I plated it with the pasta first, a sprinkle of pine nuts, the chicken strips, and shaved parmesan on top.  I served it to people from Brazil and Chile and everybody loved it!  I plan to make it again for a large gathering at Christmas.  It is so quick and easy.

This was excellent! I only had dry sundried tomatoes but soaked them in a bit of oil prior to throwing them in the pan with the chicken, and it came out perfectly.  Even my picky kids enjoyed this meal!

This so good.  The only thing added was more salt to taste and about 4 more cloves of garlic than they prescribe. It was a hit. 
This is definitely bookmarked.

Delicious, fast, easy, healthy, and inexpensive.  Even my picky husband loved it.  I am putting this in my regular rotation.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was so delicious and filling  salad for two servings. I made very little tweaks. My generic brand of farfalle had. a cook time for 13-16 and none for el dente. So I did it past the 8-12 minutes mentioned here on the recipe. It tasted great. As for the sun-dried tomatoes, I didn't have any oil-packed, and used regular sun-dried tomatoes to cut into strips. It worked out well. I would make this again in a heartbeat.

Amazing  -  I tried adding pine nuts, and I also added zucchini, but I definitely think the parmesan which i don't think was listed...is a MUST - this was SOOO tasty.  Too bad no one could enjoy it with me.

So yummy!!!  Use the pesto sauce from Costco and made a huge recipe of this for a large family style meal with friends.  I thought it needed a little more flavor, so we added some alfredo sauce to it and fresh parmesan cheese on top.  YUMMMMMM

This was a really great, simple, and time-friendly dish that I used on a busy weeknight.  It isn't a dish you would probably make for company, but it was very good when you're short on time.

Very nice pasta dish.  I used rotini because it is what I had on hand.  As for the pesto, I used the Spinach Basil Pesto from Allrecipes that I had made 2 days prior.  I also used sun-dried tomatoes in olive oil.  Delicious!  5 of us ate, and there were no leftovers.

This is the best pasta I've ever made! I ended up making my own pesto sauce, which came out to more than the 1/2 cup recommended in the recipe, and it was a delicious accident.

This was a hit for my husband and daughter. Reading all the comments I cooked my chicken with the tomatoes I didn't have sun dried tomatoes but it still came out delish. I also used Classico pesto, the entire jar make sure you salt your water for the pasta it will need it.

A good easy recipe.  Made it for some guests for a casual lunch. Added some diced onions when sauteying the chicken. Didn't add the chilli flakes because of the kids, put in some ground pepper instead. Made it with spaghetti broken in half.
Kids loved it, adults liked it too. Just missing the kick the chilli flakes wouldve given. Will definately be making it again!

Loved this recipe and so easy and fast.  Saved the left overs and taking them camping this weekend - easy warm and serve dish. I added more pesto then the recipe called for and next time will try to make my own pesto.  I used Costco 's pesto and it was very good.

Loved it - with changes.  I too added more pesto - about double. I also sautéed spinach and mushrooms with the chicken for extra vegetables and just stirred this in with the pesto and chicken when the pasta was done. I didn't have bowtie pasta, so I used rigatoni. It tasted just fine.

I used dried sun-dried tomatoes and saved the liquid to use as needed. I added some shallots, sliced mushrooms, and a small clove of minced garlic. I used bottled pesto, but next time I actually make pesto, I will use that. I had basil olive oil on hand, so I used that. Finished off with some left over goat cheese, parmesan, and chopped parsely. Very good, fast,  east dinner.

This is full of flavor, really good made by the recipe while it is warm the night it is made. It kept good in the fridge but was a little dry and had less flavor the next day. If you plan to keep it for lunch the next day or serve it as a side dish. Doubling the pesto sauce would solve the problem of what the pasta soaks up as it sits.

I made this last week for my family mainly because I had almost all of the ingredients on hand and wanted to kick us out of our food rut. I didn’t have bow tie pasta so I used penne and I didn’t have roasted red tomato’s. I think the tomato’s would have really helped complete the recipe. This made a TON of food and everyone loved it, it originally received the “what is mom trying to do to us look” but they tried it and had seconds. The next time I make this I will be adding the tomato’s, some mushrooms and spinach just because I like that in my pasta. I did add Romano and Parmesan  cheese as I was cookies because it looked like it needed something and my Italian family likes their.

Replaced the pasta with penne.  My 15 year did not appreciate my "heavy handedness" with the red peppers but said it was the perfect dish otherwise.

Absolutely delicious.  I followed the recipe pretty closely, though I did add some roasted pine nuts and Parmesan at the end, as some other reviewers suggest.  I also switched out the chicken with the quorn brand fake-chicken (or "ficken" as I usually call it) to make it vegetarian.  I've only tried a few recipes out on this website so far, but this is definitely my favorite so far.  I will definitely be making this again.

I had a jar of pesto that needed to be used.  Found this recipe today, wish I'd had some Sun-dried tomatoes on hand.  Was still good but know it would have been even better.  I liked that this recipe was very straight forward and requires few ingredients.

This was a delicious and easy dinner! I took the advice of others to saute the chicken in the oil from the sun dried tomatoes. I like the kick the red pepper flakes give tis dish! My husband respond with. "this one's a keeper"!

I enjoyed even better the next day when the flavors got to mingle together. 

Really need to add to the ingredients list...salt.  Even if to mentioned, "season to taste".  Otherwise it will be very bland.  I notice this omission in quite a few recipes on AllRecipes.

Easy and super delicious. I made it using penne, instead of butterfly pasta, and used freshly cut cherry tomatoes instead of sun-dried tomatoes.

If I could give this more stars I would!  It was scrumptious.  Sun-dried tomatoes, pesto, pasta and chicken.....fabulous combination.  The red pepper flakes give it a subtle little kick and can be adjusted to your taste.  I sprinkled fresh Parmesan on top right before serving.  I made a double batch and I can't wait to take it to work with me the next few days.  YUM!

This was YUMMY!  Made it for a big dinner party and tripled the recipe.  Used a jar of fresh pesto from Costco.  It was a little dry, so I added about a cup of heavy whipping cream, to make it a little more on the moist side.  Everyone loved it!

Just happened to have all the ingredients on hand (ok...had to use a different pasta because I didn't have bowtie), but this was soooo easy and SOOOO tasty!  My BF had seconds and even said, 'you can make this again anytime.'!  It was really good!!

This is definitely one of my favorite recipes. My husband had gotten burned out on pasta the usual way so I made this, and now I get to keep enjoying it. Even my picky kids ate it up! This recipe and "chicken milano" are my two all time favorites from this site.

This recipe is very delicious and full of flavor. My husband even commented that this was one of his new favorite meals! However, the reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it was a little dry for our taste. We added some Alfredo sauce and it made a world of difference!

I added a 1/2 cup roasted red pepper and doubled the chicken.  Used fresh spinach basil pesto which was terrific. Was skimpy on salt but found I added it afterward anyway.  Excellent and looks great. Extra chicken because that's what I had, but certainly not necessary

I've made is a 3 times in the last couple of months and will be making it again tomorrow.  Both my girls and husband love it, and they are very picky eaters.  I followed directions as stated the first time, but used roasted chicken from Costco and added generous amounts of sun-dried tomatoes and pesto.  yummm.

Really pleased with this Recipe and it's flexibility!

As I wanted more veggies, I added spinach, shredded cabbage, celery, carrots and green beans. 

I used the 'broth' from the sautéed chicken to add more moisture and omitted the Parmesan Cheese.

Overall, I am pleased with how 'my' dish came out.

Will certainly follow the Recipe to the "T" for a simpler version and flavor.

This is good as written... but I use less pesto and add a little pasta water and about 1/4 cup cream to make it more creamy.

While this recipe was good, I'd like to point out that the pasta doesn't come in 16 ounce packages. It comes in 12 ounce packages. So I purchased two packages in order to be able to use 16 ounces. Wow! Was that a mistake - way too much pasta for the other ingredients. Wisely, I only used a portion of the cooked pasta. I also added more pepper flakes, more sun dried tomatoes and capers to kick up the taste a bit.

This recipe is quite fast. I could not add dried tomatoes but added a few grape tomatoes while cooking the chicken. I also used homemade pesto that I had frozen. I think one garlic clove is not enough so I added a couple more as I like garlic. Very good recipe and will make it again!

I LOVE this recipe.  I add a few more things. I use 4oz cream cheese and add zucchini and mushrooms. Sometimes if I don't have sun dried tomatoes I cut up Roma tomatoes. Works well. One of my family's favorite.

So easy and very filling!  Well, it's pasta, duh!  Lol. I did not have sun dried tomatoes but I used roasted red peppers, chopped, with a bit of the juice from the jar....so good!  Only gave it 4 stars because I subbed the red peppers.

This was an easy recipe to make. Almost all of the flavor comes from the pesto sauce, so you can play around with that. The sun-dried tomatoes added a nice bit of flavor. I wasn't sure how I'd feel about them, so I went light on them, but I would add more next time.

I made this for my husband and SIL and it was a huge hit! The recipe was easy to follow and I used the suggestion of cooking the chicken  in the oil from the sindried tomatoes and it was perfect. I also made my pesto from scratch as my husband can't eat pine nuts so I substituted for pumpkin seeds and it was perfect. Once the pesto was made and the chicken cubed, dinner was ready very quickly. Being gluten free I used brown rice fusilli noodle as they don't make gluten free bowtie yet and it was perfect. Thank you for such a great recipe that I will keep on hand as an easy go to :)

This was a very good recipe just as it was presented. My rating is based upon that, although we did use a lot more pesto - because we had it on hand, fresh-made - and we added parmesan and mozzarella cheese and a few cherry tomatoes, halved, and added the mini-farfalle to the skillet so that it could all warm together.

When we make it again - and we will - I'm going to make some slight adjustments to fit our pallet and to avoid having to use more olive oil than is recommended (I did, and that made it a tad oily). Because we like sun-dried tomatoes, I'll probably use a half cup, finely chopped.  The big change I'll make is to steam the chicken breasts whole until almost done, let them cool, then cut them and add them to the pesto mix. This way, you don't have to cook the mixture very long or add oil to the pan beyond the recommendation.

Overall, a really good dish!

This recipe is amazing for a university student like myself! There are few ingredients, its easy to make and, of course, its delicious! Personally, I've found the amount of pesto listed to be too little, so I'd recommend putting double that amount. Also, adding bacon to the mix works really well for this recipe! :)

This was so quick and easy to make!  And the flavor was so rich!  I used penne pasta since it's all I had.  Turned out perfectly!!

This recipe sounds good in theory. However I found it to be dry (obviously since there's no sauce really) and lacking in flavor. I love pesto and I love sundries tomatoes but tossed with a pasta as an entree wasn't for me. It was more like a side dish.

I used Rotini instead of now tie. For chicken I used the Tyson Grilled Chicken. I used Julianne Sun dried tomatoes added to chicken as it cooked. Then added 1.5 cup of lemon juice. I let that reduce for about 3- 4minutes.  I chard the minced garlic in olive oil, removed the burnt pieces and added chicken to skilled with a tsp of minced garlic doing this added a bit of a smokey flavor to the dish.

My husband really liked this and I thought it was very tasty. I pretty much followed the directions, and like others, cooked the garlic in the sun-dried tomatoes' oil. I also added 2 cups of fresh spinach which wilted nicely at the end and a couple of TBS of roasted pine nuts. I used 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes (hubby loved the heat, but I thought it was a tiny bit too much). I used Trader Joe's pesto sauce and a splash of chicken broth to make the sauce easier to mix through the pasta and chicken. Very tasty for sure and will definitely make again.

This was SCRUMPTIOUS!!  I used green lentil penne pasta as I am wheat intolerant, and increased the amount of oil, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly as written.  Oh, I also used chicken tenderloins since that's what I already had cooked up.  Loved the sun-dried tomatoes but will increase the amount the next time I make this. The recipe is EASY and DELICIOUS!!  I will definitely be making this often.  LOVED IT!!

Excellent flavor.  Most enjoyable and a definite do over.  That said I didn't notice this was a recipe for 8 until well into prep.  Thus I made it as written for two peeps and good I did.  Maybe this would feed 8 elves but that's about it.  I did add a couple of mushrooms and used the pine nuts and grated parmesan suggested by other reviewers at serving.  This recipe would also be excellent with sauteed veal.  I used linguine which worked great.

I made this last week and my daughter is still raving about it!  She took the leftovers home with her and told me it was even better the next day.  She has already asked me to make it again this week.  I followed what others said and I used the oil from the sun dried tomatoes.  Excellent flavor!

Was perfect! My husband isn't a cheese fan, so it's nice to have an Italian option that isn't loaded with cheese.  I sprinkled a bit of Parmesan on mine and it was absolutely delicious! And the leftovers were great cold over a fresh garden salad.

Tasted great. Used my own home made pesto sauce...  Suggestions 1) sprinkle coarse salt and ground chile  over the pasta after plating, and 2) add whole pine nuts (which you need  to make pesto) to the pasta.

This was awesome.  I sautéed the chicken with garlic and herb seasoning, fresh garlic and garlic olive oil.  We love garlic.  I also added some green onions and parmesan cheese at the end.  Like another reviewer, I like it even better as a cold pasta salad the next day.  Thanks.

Came out delicious. However, personally I'd put in another chicken breast or two next time. Just 2 breasts for a whole package of pasta was a little light on the protein.

This time, I did take a few suggestions of the other reviewers.  I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper and doubled the pesto; who doesn't love extra pesto?  I also added toasted pine nuts and Parmesan cheese.  Super yummy!

I made this tonight for my kids and my picky eater loved it!   I did add onion flakes, Italian seasoning and extra garlic to the chicken when cooking it and added spinach on the plates of the not so picky.  Very very yummy!! So glad I found this recipe. Thank you for sharing, this will now be a regular at out dinner table.

This didn't go over well at my house. I made it according to directions. It was a bit dry and seemed to  need more chicken. I might try it again with small spaghetti instead of bow tie and with more pesto.

Switched it up by adding red peppers and mushrooms instead of sun dried tomatoes and red pepper flakes. A little plain but good

Made this tonight and it was a big hit. Did change 2 things-used fresh  grape tomatoes cut in half, added just before serving, and threw some chopped zucchini and peppers in with the chicken. Will be trying with sundried tomatoes another time. Love a recipe that provides a good foundation to build on. Thank you!

This is one of my favorite meals and the families too!  I use quinoa instead of pasta (1 cup cooked with chicken stock). My family likes it more with the quinoa and it's healthier. I also steam broccoli, cut it up small and add it at the end when mixing all together. I suggest more pesto and sundried tomatoes if making the way I do.

I posted this recipe many years ago! So glad many are enjoying it. I can't access the account I used to post and would love to make a change to the servings...because yes, that is an error! I have a family of four (with 2 grown teens) and I make 2 pounds of pasta (and will have leftovers). I know some criticize the store bought pesto. I'll be honest, my teens only like it with the Buitoni sauce you can buy at grocery store. I've tried freshly made pesto and I can't fool them! That being said, my husband and I like it with any pesto. One thing I do differently now is to add sun-dried tomotoes to the chicken (after it's fully cooked but not browned yet). It makes it creamier. Really good! This dish is very versatile!

The most critical part of this recipe is the Pesto.  Store bought Pesto is almost always mediocre.  The Pesto sauce should be part of the recipe and NOT just an ingredient.  There is no way to get a consistent flavor with store bought sauce.

This was pretty good but I was slightly underwhelmed...hoping for more flavor, I think.  I used store-bought pesto and I'm thinking if I had used fresh or possibly a different sauce it would have been better.  I doubled the garlic and used roughly 3/4 cup of pesto.  I couldn't find sun-dried tomatoes in oil so I used dry - I'll probably take other reviewers' advice in the future and saturate them before adding to dish.  I will definitely make again and play with this until it's a 5-star recipe for me. :)

My family loved it, and it was so easy! I added dried basil to the chicken and Parmesan cheese to the whole thing right before serving. I will use more than 1/2 c. Pesto next time.

My daughter loved this recipe but I just liked it.  It made a lot, which may have something to do with it since I am tired of the leftovers!  I would recommend half the pasta noodles.  It was good cold the next day, so I think this would be perfect for a picnic potluck.  I also think it would be very good without the chicken and just have pesto pasta.

Added Feta Cheese into the recipe, and cooked chicken in the pesto sauce and let sit for 10 minutes to absorb flavor!
Delicious easy and great for entertaining!

This was awesome!  Very easy to prepare and it was delicious!  I added onions, petite carrots, zucchini, and fresh spinach and also substituted basil paste for the pesto to cut the calories to less than half. This is a keeper!

I didn't think there was enough flavor. I even added fresh parmesan cheese, olives and other spices. Made a double batch as I was feeding a bunch of family. My sister made a white sauce to give it more flavor.

A simple yet very tasty dish. I made it on two batches and added mushrooms to the second and enjoyed it both times. One note is that u need a cup of pesto as a minimum and not half a cup as the recipe suggests. I made my own pesto at home instead of buying ready made one.

Loved the ease of getting this great recipe on the table in no time flat! Quick, easy and delicious. My daughter doesn't care for sundried tomatoes so I added in julienne stips of red pepper and a little lemon juice. I love the suggestion of using the sundried tomato oil to cook the chicken, when not making the recipe for my whole family!

Prepared as written, with store-bought pesto, too bland.  Pesto needs to either be increased by at least a third, or made fresh.  Some brands of farfalle (bow tie) pasta come in 12 oz. boxes, and perhaps that would be the right ratio of pasta to pesto.  Will try that next, as well as one more half chicken breast.  However, the olive oil then becomes too heavy so it is vital to remove all the oil from the sun dried tomato strips.  They also need to be chopped to add more flavor to each bite, rather than left julienned. Last, we needed to finish it with grated Parmesan cheese to give it more flavor.  Will make it again with the changes, since my family still liked (not loved) it.  Thank you!

I made this dish the other night.  It is amazing!  This is a surprisingly easy recipe. I followed the recipe pretty much exact.  We normally have left overs, but there was none of this left.  I will have to make it a regular at our house.

Very easy to  make.  I used already minced jar garlic  and it was fine.  Instead of the jarred pesto sauce I used frozen pesto which is lighter in flavor and not as oily as the jarred pesto and it was delicious. I did just adjust the pesto to taste....so it wouldn't over power the flavor of the sundries tomatoes.

Hubby absolutley luvvv'd this receipe!!  Like others i used the oil from the sundried tomato and added a little butter for browning the chicken.  I added sliced mushrooms and a handfull of spinach.  I also added 1/2 jar of alfredo sauce mixed with the jar of pesto (classico brand)to thicken the sauce and give it a slight creamy texture.  Hubby went back for seconds and took some for lunch the next day!  I will certainly make this again.  It's a WINNER!!

I have made this recipe many times. I started with preparing according to the recipe and then have jazzed it up. I now add sliced black olives, sliced mushrooms and chopped onions. These are all cooked with the chicken. I also add a lot more of the pesto and the sun dried tomatoes because I love both of those ingredients.  The best pesto I have found is the Kirkland brand sold at Costco. I make lots so there are left overs to freeze and take for lunches.  This is a never fail recipe!

I actually have been making this exact dish myself for years.  Like Kristin, I add extra garlic.  It's also good cold for lunch the next day w/a wedge of cantaloupe alongside.

Like this dish, but it lacked some flavor so I just add a little Parmesan Dressing or Zesty Italian Dressing to give it some zing.

I loved the mix of the pesto sauce (I used Classico Basil Pesto) and the sun-dried tomatoes (I put in a little bit of the oil from the tomatoes).  The Classico Basil Pesto sauce has a lot of garlic in it, so you may not want to add additional garlic; however, we LOVE garlic, so it's all good.  

If you have leftovers, I would suggest adding a little olive oil to it before heating it up.  I heated it up without adding it, and it seemed dry.

I made this for Sunday dinner and my whole family really loved it!  They even asked to take some home to eat later!  I doubled the recipe for all ingredients except pesto. I probably tripled the pesto.  Kept adding until bow ties were well coated.  Served with toasted pine nuts and freshly grated parmesan cheese.  (The pine nuts were really a big hit).  I will certainly be making this again.

So easy, so good.  For four people, I halved the recipe, except I used about 12 ounces of pasta and did not halve the sun-dried tomatoes or pesto.  I also added the tomatoes to the chicken in the pan, then added the pasta, then warmed pesto, so everything was nice and hot.

I like to saute some chopped onion along with the chicken, add more pesto sauce than called for & toss in fresh grape tomatoes that have been sliced in half. Also nice with some kind of cheese grated on top - but isn't everything better with cheese :-).

I too had to use much more pesto sauce to cover the pasta sufficiently. Probably about 1 1/2 cups. I made the "simple garlic and basil pesto sauce" from this site. I added some orange peppers cooked with the tomatoes and garlic. Very good all my family liked it even though it was green and they seem to have an aversion to anything that color.

I've tried this recipe, and it was really successful specially with my daughter (22 yrs old) who is so finicky, she loved it, had 2 helpings.  I did tweek it a bit.  Sauted the chicken like some suggested in the oil from the sun dried tomatoes which I cut in bite size pieces, took out the chicken, added oignons and zucchini which I cut in bite size pieces and sauted then added mushrooms, basil and cajun spices as well as the spices included in the recipes.  The reason for this is that I had a whole meal in one pot, also added another clove (just love garlic) This was just delicious, made this recipe for three people and didn't change any of the quantities, it was a good thing as everybody took two servings... Thank you Kirstin.

I wanted to like this, I really did, but after making it as written, I had to say it was bland. Added more pesto some heavy cream and parmesan cheese. Tasted. needs something more.

This was awesome!  I didn't have any sun dried tomatoes, so I used regular tomatoes and cut up the seed portion for a salad and used the rest in this dish and it was perfect!  A great way to use some of my fresh pesto.

I really enjoyed this recipe. It has a small kick but not too much. I added more garlic and pesto - almost double. I also added 1 tbsp butter in the frying pan when doing the garlic. I also added salt and pepper when frying the chicken. Loved it and can't wait to make it for other people.

Used regular tomatoes instead of sun dried since my family does not like their taste
Otherwise used the recipe with homemade pesto (made with walnuts and basil fresh from the garden)
Outstanding!

This recipe is a great idea for any pesto...kale, argula ect.  The one thing I do to create more sauce without over-doing the pesto is to save some of the pasta cooking water and use it to thin the pesto.  It makes a much nicer sauce. If you are not watching calories, adding either marsacrapone or good quality ricotta really kicks it up a few notches!

I want to give this five stars, but it needs Parmesan on top to be really excellent.  Also I would recommend adding a cup of chopped veggies.

only used 12 oz of penne. Used a whole jar of sun-dried pesto. Used almost a whole bag of sun-dried tomatoes and softened them in 1 cup chicken broth with a splash of wine for an hour before slicing. Added one can of quartered artichokes. Grilled the chicken.

This was an excellent meal.  I used Mezzeta pesto, ground turkey,and whole wheat penne. I had to substitute canned whole roma tomatoes, for the sun dried tomatoes, breaking them into pieces and reducing the liquid. We are growing lots of basil in our garden, so, next time we can make our own pesto!

I usually make this recipe a little different. I made it this way and it was bland to me. I add feta usually we get them in small blocks and I just use a little about half a block diced and let it melt and it makes a cream sauce. I prefer this much beter it comes out really tangy and creamy. I will stick to the way I make it.

This recipe was so easy to make.  It was a great dinner for game night.  I did use some pesto I had frozen from the fall's last batch from my garden.  I added the oil from the sun-dried tomatoes to the chicken as suggested. I added 1/2 tsb of crushed red peppers, also from my garden I dried (I think next time I will add even more for more of a kick). Also, I added parm cheese.  I rated it a 4 because it was so quick and easy & for all these changes I got from the reviews.  Even our baseball catcher enjoyed it & was full which is extremely amazing.

Good recipe.  We followed the directions as listed with the exception of the sun dried tomatoes.  We just didn't have them on hand.  Topped with Parmesan cheese.  Would have been good with some type of seasoned chicken or rotisserie chicken.  Overall,  a keeper and one we will make again!

Super easy and good recipe.  I threw in a couple of handfuls of fresh spinach (for 4 servings)in the last few minutes of cooking the chicken.  Once the spinach was wilted, it really added a beautiful color to the dish - wish I had taken a picture!

Sounded yummy so we gave it a try after reading several of the reviews.  We used our own pesto, thyme and rosemary along with onions and spag sauce that was not called for in the recipe.  One and a half cups of spag sauce was added to give it some moisture as it appeared extremely dry.  One and a half tbsp of pepper seemed just the right amount to give it a nice warm taste but not hot.  Will definitely make this again but will likely drop the thyme.

This recipe was ok.  I followed the recipe exactly except I sauteed the chicken in the oil from the sundried tomatoes.  The chicken was awesome, I just did not care for the sundried tomatoes mixed with the pesto.  I think it made the flavor taste just a little off.  If you really love sundried tomatoes I'm sure you'll love this recipe more than I did.

I gave this a 4 only because I added @ 1/4 cup of cream to make it over the top creamy delicious.  I will make this again with or without the cream.  BTW I also used cheese tortellini which had been on the shelf and called to me to use it.

This is really awesome recipe.   The only thing is, my daughter is not a fan of sun-dried tomatoes.   So I added cooked spinach instead, and she loved it.

Made exactly as written but I think it needs a little more umpph.  Definitely will make again but will try what other reviewers mentioned:  onion, salt, and parmesan cheese.  A little bit of these will go a long way in adding more flavor.  Still, this was an easy recipe and tasted good.

This was excellent! I didn't have any sundried tomatoes and I can't wait to try it with them. The only change I made was to use gluten free pasta. I made a pesto sauce called 15 year old pesto sauce that another person had suggested and it was the best pesto I ever made, I definitely recommend it, the recipe is on this website. Thank you

I have always loved pesto dishes however, I never would have guessed that it is so easy to make.  I tried this recipe because it has 2 of my boyfriends favorite ingredients: pesto and sun dried tomatoes.  I was amazed to find how tasty this dish is and how super easy it was to make.  I did jazz it up a little bit with sliced mushrooms and grated parmesan cheese.  I also used the olive oil from the sun dried tomatoes.  Needless to say, my boyfriend loved it, even called it "excellent"!  I just made another batch and doubled the ingredients.  I am treating my coworkers with this dish tomorrow :)

Wow! Looks so easy, but taste so good!  I made mine with whole wheat pasta, homemade pesto,and the entire jar of sun dried tomatoes.  Would be great with a little cheese on top!  Quick, easy, delicious!

This dish was fantastic!  My children, husband, and myself, loved it!  I did add more pesto and sun dried tomatoes than the recipe called for.  I added the entire jar of sun-dried tomatoes (about a cup), and 3/4 cup of pesto.  We like the flavor of basil pesto, and I wanted to really be able to taste all of the flavors.  Will definitely add this to our menu, on a regular basis!!

I made this last night and it was great! I did a few changes though. I did not use the sun dried tomatoes but instead I sauteed asparagus and mushrooms with the chicken that I spiced up a bit. I also used whole grain veggie penne since I was attempting to make it a somewhat healthy dish. Then combined the pasta, pesto, veggies, and chicken all together and sprinkled grated Parmesan cheese on top. Flavorful and colorful!

Very good, but a little dry. I ended up adding extra pesto, but I only had 3/4 cup, so I also added some half and half (about 1/2 cup) to make it a little more moist. I did as some suggested and added toasted pine nuts and some extra parmesan cheese. Turned out quite delicious with the changes.

Good stuff!  Two notes: - Chop the tomatoes if they are whole! Those mothers are thick and DO NOT soften once added to the mix. - Pesto is x-pensive. A small jar of the stuff WILL be enough to complete the recipe, BUT costs 5 or 6 bucks at least!

I made it with the  Pesto Sauce recipe from All Recipes.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used  two cups leftover cubed chicken. The chicken was not dry  The flavor was good, but it was much too dry.  I will not make it again. It made a ton. We did have leftovers twice and I threw away the rest, after picking out the chicken.

Made my own pesto. Ok, the bowties are the BEST shape for this, I don't know why! But I loved it. The tomato strips were a wonderfully fruity addition. My husband LOVED it, and with the homemade Pesto, it was uber healthy! Will be making this again very soon!

I used wheat thin spaghetti in place of bow tie since this is what I had already.  I took others' suggestions and used the sun dried tomato oil to cook the chicken in and added the tomatoes towards the end of cooking.  I also threw in some diced zucchini to add some veggies.  I had to add more pesto though because it was a little dry looking.  Once tossed together I mixed in some parmesan cheese and baked 10 mins.  It was really good and my husband loved it!

This is a very nice recipe for mealtime.  It is hearty, flavorful and pretty easy.  I pounded chicken flat and laid the pieces on top of the pasta.  My husband had seconds and my picky daughter ate all of her chicken.

My family loved it.  I made it thinking my toddlers wouldn't eat it, but they both did and both had seconds.  It's a super fast tasty meal.  I did toss  the chicken with a little flour, garlic and onion powder, seasoning salt, pepper, dried parsley and oregano before I cooked it.  And since niether my husband nor I particularly care for sun-dried tomatoes so I will leave them out next time.

This recipe was full very tasteful.  I used scaled down portion for two people but used 2 cloves of garlic.  It had a strong garlic taste.  I had previously made pesto from scratch using pecans instead of pine nuts.  I used 2 heaping tsps of pesto and it had enough flavor.  We are not big pesto lovers.  Would definitely make again.  Yum, yum!! Love the garlic taste.

Very tasty.  Like others, I sauted the chicken in the oil from the sun-dried tomatoes.  Added a little bit of garlic pepper.  Topped with parmesan cheese and baked for about 10 minutes.  Left-overs were delish too.

I made this last night and my spouse LOVED it! All I did was take one chicken breast, cook it in a pan with olive oil and red pepper flakes. Then got linguini, cooked that. Then in a casserole dish I put my pesto in, added a bunch of parmesan cheese, some fresh garlic, threw in the pasta and chicken and baked it at 400 for about 10 mins.

Great, quick and easy recipe.  I'm not a fan of red pepper flakes, but without them it was just crying out for hearts of palm or artichoke hearts (not marinated).  Will add one or the other next time.

This was SO easy to make and my husband really liked it.  I used dry sundried tomatoes and soaked them in boiling water for a few minutes.  I doubled the amount of sundried tomatoes and sauted some mushrooms along with the chicken and garlic.  Good stuff!

Very tasty; I ran out of red pepper flakes so I used chili powder.  But, it turned out wonderful.  The pesto was a very good hint.

Easy and delicious.  I added 3 Italian sausages which really added to the flavor. The original recipe is a little bland so next time I will try adding more garlic and crushed red pepper.

Oh so unbelievably delicious.  I could seriously live on this stuff.  This is definitely my favorite recipe EVER!!  I have made it so many times in the 2 years since I found it.  HIGHLY recommend this one!!  You can even leave the chicken out and then it's even easier to make!

My wife and kids loved this recipe.  I followed some of the suggestions on here like using oil from the sun dried tomatoes to saute the chicken.  My opinion is that if you love pesto, go for more than 1/2 cup.  Topped off with a little parmesan or asiago and this was a hit for me.

I really liked this. It was quick and easy. I love pesto and with the amount of pasta you use 1/2 Cup isn't enough. I used two 7 oz. containers and would have been even happier with more. I will definitely make this a couple times a month.

I have made this many times and my whole family loves it-- another tip that I like to use is i cut the chicken breast in 1/2" pieces and then cook the chicken and the garlic in the actual pesto sauce in a pan -- the chicken is so moist and flavorful!

WOW!  My first experience with pesto and also with sun-dried tomatoes was a good one.  Everyone in my family loved this, even the picky teenage son and hubby who is not that big on chicken/pasta combinations.  Was a breeze to put together & tasted like something you'd see demonstrated on TV.  Classico prepared pesto was yummy & there's enough left to make another batch.  I upped it to three chicken breasts because it didn't look like enough in the pan for 5 good servings.  It probably would have been OK.  I'm sure I can make again before too long!

I had some firm tofu that I needed to use up, and substituted the tofu for the chicken. It was marvelous!  Having an abundance of basil in the garden resulting in a LOT of homemade pesto, this is perfect!

It was a pretty easy recipe and it tasted pretty good overall, but I've had better.  I think part of it was the time crunch I was in, but the spices and things didn't taste quite right to me.  The boyfriend liked it though. so that's all that really matters!

Easy to make...my hubby loves it even though he is very picky. I've made ths a few times now and I've only found this recipe a couple weeks ago. I made homemade pesto for this but it's all so easy and good. I'm a huge pasta lover.

This was really really good!  Even my 2 year old ate it, which is amazing- he never wants to eat anything.  I think this would be amazing as a cold pasta salad.  I'd throw in some greek olives and cubed smoked gouda cheese too.

Very good recipe.  I followed pretty much exactly, except I added a little bit more pesto (store bought).  Next time, I will add a few more of the sun-dried tomatoes (1/3 cup didn't seem like enough).  The whole family enjoyed this, and it was easy to make.  Lots of leftovers too!

Wonderful Recipe! Easy and quick to make. My two year old and six year old gobbled it up. I think next time I may try using the oil from the sun dried tomatoes to cook the chicken with like some of the other reviewers mentioned. Definitely a keeper!

This dish came out better that expected, for the first time ever I used pesto sauce from the grocery store intead of making my own. I didn't have enough basil to make a batch. The only thing I did different was to marinate the chicken breasts with garlic, salt, pepper and olive oil early in the morning, I kept in the refrigerator all day, so the chicken got a really good flavor. Also, I was out of sundried tomatoes. Next time I want to try this recipe with my own pesto sauce, I'm sure it will come out even better.

Wonderful!  I used more like a cup of basil pesto and a few more sundried tomatoes.

My whole family including my picky 5 yr old LOVES this recipe!  I also add some asparagus, for a delicious leafy green (I recommend the grilled asparagus recipe from Larry Lampert on this site.)  Also, the Cibo Naturals pesto sauce from Costco works fantastic with this dish.  Thanks so much!

This recipe was great.  The only thing I changed was the pasta -- I used frozen tortellini rather than bowtie.  Really delicious.

I use spaghetti pasta instead of bowties. I also added yellow and green peppers and onions. I forgot the garlic and red pepper flakes, and omitted the oil. I added parmesan cheese. It was simple and decilious. I wasn't sure if my boyfriend would like it, but he did. It's such a quick meal to prepare after a long day at work and a big workout at the gym. I would make it again and again.

I substituted shrimp for chicken and sauteed the garlic in the sun dried tomato oil. I added 1 pound of raw shrimp and stirred until they turned pink. Then I tossed it with the other ingredients and added some shredded parmesan cheese.  It was served with Insalata Caprese and crusty bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.

I really enjoyed the flavors of this pasta dish. I used the marinade to cook the chicken in and added a little extra garlic. The sundried tomatoes really add a lot. I was however, dissapointed with how dry it was. I used less pasta than what was called for. Perhaps I'll look for a creamy pesto version of this recipe.

Delicious!  Used farafalle (bow-tie) pasta which made for a cute presentation.  It was really hot the day I decided to make this so my significant other suggested that we serve the dish cold.  It was refreshing.  The change I would make though is serve if I served it cold again, would be to serve the pasta, pesto, sun-dried tomatos cold and the chicken hot/war.

I made this last night for Bunco. It was outstanding. Because I needed it to be lighter, as a side, I only used one chicken breast and I diced it after it was cooked in the garlic and red pepper flakes. I used Classico's jarred Pesto, and it turned out yummy. Will definitely make this again, and may try with shrimp or scallops.

This recipe was quite good. I added lots of garlic, I believe about 10 cloves, used 4 chicken breasts, and topped it off with some kalamata olives. It was very good. 4.5 stars.

My favorite all time dish.  I also have used Multi-grain pasta and it is Wonderful.  The sun-dried tomatoes make it wonderful.
You can also add roasted pine nuts...YUMMY!

This was good and pretty easy.  I used dried tomatoes and soaked them in hot water before cutting.  Next time I will probably add more chicken.  We put parmesan on top.

A quick and easy weeknight dinner-I didn't make the pesto but needed to add a touch of salt or grated parmesan-I also served it in a ring of tomato sauce with toasted pine nuts on top-would be delish with shrimp too...

I was going to make Fettuccini Tomato Rustica II, which is also on this site, but forgot to buy the cheeses. So I made this instead and was pleasantly surprised. Very good. Next time I may try the sundried tomatoes that are not packed in oil (to save on fat content).

Tried this one last night.  I decided to add a half pound of shrimp and some spinach to the recipe.  I also used the entire 8.5 oz. jar of sun-dried tomatoes instead of the suggested 1/3 cup.  I also let the chicken and shrimp sit all day in the minced garlic.  Once it was cooked and ready, me and my fiancée loved it.

I thoroughly enjoyed this dish.  The calories and sodium per serving were just what I was looking for.  I made my own pesto from another recipe and used a little more sun-dried tomato since the recipe made so much pasta.

This was absolutely delicious and easy. I added a good sized handful of pine nuts at the end of cooking. It was a very good Friday night dinner and made good leftovers for lunch the next day. Thanks for a great recipe & we'll be having this again for sure.

This was a good base meal, but requires a lot of doctoring up to make this really good.  As is, the recipe isn't as flavorful as we like.      We had to add some more garlic, and I think I will reheat the leftovers with a lot of parmesan cheese added, and maybe some chopped tomatoes.

One of my family's favorites! I'm not a fan of peppers so I don't add it but I do add some cooking cream to the sauce... I've used this basic recipe at least twice and I will definitely do so in the future! Thanks.

This was so easy to make! I used additional pesto sauce, and sprinkled italian seasoning on the chicken for a little more flavor. Turned out great with little effort.

This is delicious, and so easy to make. It's a nice change from tomato based pasta dishes, light but tons of flavor! I used homemade pesto I had on hand,I didn't have red pepper flakes so I seasoned the chicken with a sprinkle of cayenne pepper. We had this with a tossed salad and french bread and I topped with shredded parmesan. My whole family loved it, even my mom who is a food snob raved about it and asked me for the recipe. I will make this all the time!!!

Yummy!  I loved this dish.  Quick and easy to prepare and the tomatoes and red pepper flakes gave an extra zing to the pesto.  My hubby gave it a 4 and a half stars simply 'cos he didn't think it was quite wow enough for 5. But he really liked it just the same.  Thanks Kristin

I followed the directions exactly and it was really bland.  I wonder if it was the pesto I used.  Can someone recommend a good pesto sauce (jarred or homemaed?).  I can be contacted at hesantone@msn.com.  Thanks!  I would love to try this again.

This recipe was delicious!  Even my picky 11-year old thought it was great--he ate 3 helpings!  I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe.  This will become one of our frequently used recipes.  I plan to make this when we entertain.

This was a pretty good recipe.  I would have rather bought a jar of pesto sauce because I made the pesto myself and it turned out pretty bland.  The red pepper flakes add lots of flavor though.

Definitely a 5! This was great with a side of asparagus and some crusty bread. We did make homemade pesto, which added a little time, but was worth it. Would be wonderful either way. Will make again and again. Thanks Kristin!

This pasta is FABULOUS!  I used reduced fat Buitoni pesto sauce and it turned out great.  There is a big difference in the fat content and when it's all put together you can't even tell.  I did put in some extra sun-dried tomatoes because they're so sweet and delicious.  So easy to make!

This dish was FABULOUS!  My husband raved about it and said it was worthy of being on a menu at a restaurant!  I totally agree.  It made plenty between the two of us, so we'll be having this for lunch tommorrow and then there will still be some left.  I served it with a side salad and ran up to the local bakery and bought fresh pesto foccacia.  Delightful!
