Why, oh why, do people think they can substitute ingredients willy-nilly and still get a good result? This is baking, folks. You need to follow the recipe. This recipe, for example, calls for oil for a reason -- not shortening. If you don't have enough oil, then you need to: A) go get more oil; B) find a recipe that calls for something other than oil; or C) substitute as you will, don't complain when the recipe doesn't turn out well. I made this cake by following the recipe and it is perfect and perfectly delicious. Not dense, not spongy, not too chocolaty.

This recipe is ingredient for ingredient and amount for amount the recipe on the back of a Hershey's Cocoa can
, only they called it Deep Dark Chocolate Cake.  The frosting recipe on the can is only slightly different and suggests different amounts of the cocoa depending on flavor desired: 1/3 cup for light flavor, 1/2 cup for medium flavor, and 3/4 cup for dark flavor.  That may help some people who think it's too chocolatey.  It also states on the can that the butter is to be softened, as another review notes.  Then it says to cream the butter in a small mixer bowl.  This current recipe says melt.  You may get better results with the softened idea.  And as always, you can't go substituting too far off the beaten path with either the cake recipe or the frosting and think you're getting what other people are raving about.

Ever since I found this recipe, it has been my "tried and true" chocolate cake recipe.  I use 1 cup of hot, strong, fresh brewed coffee instead of the boiling water.  I have also used evaporated milk, and it makes the cake sooooo dense and moist!  This is a great recipe, the frosting and cake are to die for!  I have baked the cake in a 9 x 13 pan, a bundt pan, and giant muffin tins.  If any of you are looking for a great chocolate cake recipe, look no further, this is it!

What a huge disappointment! I made this recipe to a "T" and I can't believe how much I don't like it. With all of the wonderful ratings I was just sure we were going to be in chocolate heaven by now - NOT! This cake overflowed the bundt pan, was spongy, chewy, crumbly, stuck to the pan and was not sweet at all. I kept thinking that I was chewing a mildly chocolate flavored sponge. Don't even bother telling me that I must have done something wrong, I didn't. I have been baking for 30 years and certainly know how to make a cake; this one just isn't my cup of tea. Thanks anyway, and I truly am glad that so many like this.

No wonder this is one of Hershey's enduring, signature recipes. You'll not find a more "perfectly chocolate" chocolate cake.  It's easy to mix up, moist, and incredibly chocolate-y. To enhance the chocolate flavor I substituted hot coffee for the water. Half a recipe made 12 cupcakes, baked at about 20-23 minutes, but keep in mind that oven temperatures and sizes of cupcake pans vary. I used my own chocolate buttercream frosting.

This is the best chocolate cake - very moist.  It's just two of us so I scaled the reciped for a single layer and baked in my 8 x 8 for 30 - 35 minutes.  I didn't melt the butter for the frosting - that just didn't sound right to me - I softened it instead.  I thought it would be creamier but it tasted great too!

I absolutely love this cake and everyone who has ever eaten this dessert has always praised me for making it!  Just a few changed I make...I add half a package of chocolate fudge Jello pudding mix to my dry ingredients.  The pudding mix makes this cake soooo moist! (You can do this with homemade cookies, too!)  I drop the cooking temp. by about 25 degrees (my oven runs a little high) and and do not cook as long as directed.  Instead I pull out the cakes 5-6 min. early and then cover with foil.  The heat being trapped will continue to cook the inside of the cake.  If you leave the foil on for several hours the cake will be even more moist.  For the frosting, I use 'Chocolate Fudge Buttercream Frosting' from this website.  Garnish cake with chocolate shavings and mmmmmmm good!

Being an American living in the Netherlands, I have a hard time making good cakes. The flour here is higher in gluten than in the USA and many recipes come out the consistency of construction material bricks. THIS cake came out perfect! Light and fluffy with a great taste. Possibly the only thing I'd do differently is add a little more cocoa for an intense burst of chocolate.
Super recipe, though.

Excellent recipe! I made this for my husbands birthday he loved it (as well as out two year old). The recipe was perfect. It came out exactly as shown and was very moist. I made a peanut butter frosting for the center between two layers with a chocolate peanut butter frosting for the outside of the cake, topping it off with reeses pieces. Def 5 stars! ***** :)

If I could give this cake 6 stars, I would!! This is by far THE best chocolate cake I have ever had! The cake batter mixes up really thin after adding the water. Don't worry - it will bake up to be very dense and rich. I made one yesterday for my husband's birthday. We ate one piece each, then shared with friends. I am baking another one right now to take to work tomorrow. I don't share recipes until they are up to my high standards. This one definitely is! Note: if you want a little different taste to the cake, try adding strong coffee instead of the hot water. Yum!

Incredibly moist cake. I've made this 3 times now and it comes out perfectly each time. Make sure you heavily grease and flour the cake pan -- this is so moist that it easily sticks to the bottom of the pan. And allow it to cool sufficiently before removing it from the pans. Otherwise, it will fall apart in your hand due to the moistness.

I think this is probably the best chocolate cake recipe I've tried from this site. However, I do prefer it with a chocolate Cool Whip frosting rather than the one included. (See Cool Whipped Frosting recipe on this site; use chocolate pudding instead of vanilla.) The recipe makes 6 cups of batter, so you will need to pour 3 cups into each pan for a two-layer cake and 2 cups into each pan for a three-layer cake.  Oh, this cake won first place for me in my local fair, and you won't believe this, but somebody actually stole the cake from its display!

5 STARS ALL THE WAY!  This is the best chocolate cake and frosting I have ever made!  I had tasted the frosting when my mother made it so I knew I would love it.  However, when I made it, it was thinner; so, a call to Mom and her secret was out.  You have to beat it a long time until it gets fluffier.  So good!!  Thank you Hershey's for sharing your recipe!

WOW, this is one of the best cakes I've made yet! I followed recipe exactly, except for adding coffee granules to the boiling water. So rich, moist chocolately and satisfying. For those who did not like the frosting, I'm having a hard time understanding why! It is so good smooth and beautiful. Let me tell you that even my brother who has a tendency to always scrape of excess icing crom a cake, ate the whole thing for the first time!! Those who thought it was grainy, well it might be because you either haven't beaten it enough, or your cocoa powder was grainy and needed sifting. I filled with mocha cream inside the cake, but frosted with this frosting. If you are craving one of those rich chocolate cakes that satisfy all your taste buds, this is it! I felt like eating the whole thing, I just love it. Oh and it's sooooo easy to make too, all in one bowl, no melting of anything, so fast, and in the oven in no time!!!! Thanks so much for this recipe!

OMG!! this cake is soooo good, the only thing that I would change would be the frosting, I didn't use melted butter, softened butter instead and try to cut the powdered sugar to 2 cups, but was not firm enough, and with 3 cups was a litlle bit too sweet, a really good acke anyway!

I came to AllRecipes to review this because they credited Hershey's. Another recipe site refused to give credit so they don't get the review! I've never made a chocolate cake in my life because the ones I've tried are dry and tasteless. But, a birthday was coming and a chocolate cake was requested. I read the reviews here; used butter for the oil, strong coffee for the water, and Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa powder. Also added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter. Baked it in a Bundt pan. Served it for birthday and four people devoured it entirely within 1/2 an hour!!! Superb, not too sweet, moist...what I would call a gourmet, adult cake. I chose to not frost it as a superiour cake should stand on its own. Everyone agreed: frosting would have destroyed this cake! So glad that I found this recipe here and that you give Hershey's full credit for it! Well done.

This was delicious.  Be sure to REALLY grease and flour the pan.  I've made many cakes and never had one stick until this one.  The frosting is excellent! Great overall.  I'll make it again for sure!

I didn't make any changes to the recipe...& won't the next time either. I filled heart-shaped muffin pans about 1/2 full of batter... dropped in a maraschino cherry, a sprinkle of mini-semi sweet chocolate chips & a 1/2 tsp of cherry juice. The cherry, of course, dropped to the bottom. I knew it would so I don't know why it didn't occur to me to roll it in flour first to try to combat that. I think it will at least help. Didn't really matter in the end...they were fabulous even w/ the cherry at the bottom. ;o) I served these for dessert for our Valentine's meal & to doll them up some for the occasion, I sprinkled them w/ red sparkly sugar. I used big, square glass plates to serve them on...off to the side of the plate, I wrote "I love you" in melted chocolate (just filled up a plastic bag w/ melted chocolate, snipped off a tiny corner & free-handed it). I drizzled  a bit of cherry preserves as a bed for the cupcake. I've posted a pic for those of you who are interested. Thsi was an excellent chocolate cake recipe...it was chocolatey & moist.

This recipe is wonderful!!!  Everyone at the party I had loved it, even those not to fond of chocolate cake.  Tips: 1) Cover the bottom of pan with wax paper before greasing and 2) Soften, don't melt, the butter.

For those of you who had problems with this recipe, it is because you either didn't follow the directions or you substituted the ingredients. The only ingredient that can be substituted is the sugar. I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup less. Also, you must mix the dry ingredients and wet ingredients seperately! I think this is a perfect cake! I didn't use the icing. I'm going to try another one. I greased my pan really well, and I had the same problem like the rest of you with my cake sticking to the pan. I didn't have any parchment paper, so I had to try any way without it.

I use this recipe for all of my chocolate cakes.  It is soo good and easy to make and the frosting is delicious too. My husband is a big chocolate cake eater...and he always raves when I make this.  I don't know what people are talking about with the frosting being too thin also.  If it looks to thin, then add more powdered sugar..it's not rocket science.  Definately a keeper for me! :0)

OMG!!! Okay, I am a VERY picky chocolate lover. Most chocolate cakes are either not chocolatey enough for me, or they are too dry or just don't even really taste like chocolate. One of the only chocolate cakes I ever have loved is the Costco All-American Chocolate Cake. Up until now, nothing has come close to that. This cake tops it!!! This cake has been a HUGE hit with everyone. It's as moist as a box cake, and even better because it's all from scratch. When I eat this cake, I'm in heaven. One thing I changed (a small change). I used butter flavor Crisco instead of the oil. This makes it even better if that's even possible. On a scale of 1 to ten...this is an 11!

It's hard to believe that something so simple to make can taste so wonderful! I'm a chocoholic, and this cake is really good. The last reviewer complained of it being too "spongy". She overcooked it. Keep an eye on it, don't let it overcook, and it's a great chocolate cake.

This recipe is excellent.  The only thing I did differently is to line the pans with parchment paper and butter the paper and dust the bottom and sides of the pan with cocoa powder instead of flour.  This leaves a nicer finish on your cake.

I've made this cake for a few years and I love it!  I won second place with it in the chocolate cake category (against a lot of other entries) at the fair a couple of years ago. Today I tried dissolving instant coffee in the boiling water for the the batter and warmed milk for the frosting. I will never do it another way! Takes it to a whole other level! For the people with the problem of the cake running over--are you sure you are using a 9" pan and not an 8"? But more than likely, your oven is too hot and your cake is rising too fast. Try splitting the cake up between 3-9" pans and bake for about 18 minutes, I think. I use a TON of Baker's Joy and usually parchment because this cake is so moist, it tends to stick.

I was in a real hurry and tried to take the cake out of the pan before cooling - big mistake - it broke.  I went ahead and frosted the other one in the pan and took it to a dinner party.  It was great - there was not a piece left and everyone talked about how good it was.

If you've never made a scratch cake - start with this recipe.  For a little extra effort you'll get a classic chocolate cake - dense and satisfying.  Mixing the cocoa into the butter while it's still hot gets rid of the chalky texture.  Keep frosting at room temp until ready to spread (doesn't spread well if cold).  The cake is so forgiving that I have spread the frosting on while cake is still lukewarm.  For birthdays I put a layer of cherry pie filling in the middle instead of frosting and use toothpicks to keep the layers from sliding.  It is my family's most requested birthday cake.  A real keeper.

Excellent!  I've never made a chocolate cake recipe other than my grandmother's, because hers is tops.  My sister told me she made this recipe & that it was great, so I tried it.  It's more dense/ brownielike than my grandma's recipe, so now I can rely on 2 different chocolate cake recipes.  I used buttercream frosting because that seemed like too much chocolate, but my sister says I must try it with the choc frost. Very very good!

This is the one by which all other chocolate cakes are judged and none have been better.  It is perfect in flavor and consistancy, IMO.  The only changes I make are to use melted butter instead of the oil and fresh hot coffee instead of the water.  Outstanding!

I'd give this cake 10 stars if I could! I've been making this cake for years and everyone thinks it's my famous cake! I've made it for birthday parties, dessert, Boy Scout Cake Auctions. I've made it 2 layers high, I've made it 4 layers high, cupcakes and sheet cake. I always follow the recipe exactly and it's never failed me - always moist and "perfect"! One thing I do different in the frosting is to use 1/2 tsp ALMOND extract in the frosting to give it a little something more. You'll never go back to nasty old cake mix again!

Very good! I needed something to take to a bunch of pissy co-workers.  Hee hee, what better way of cheering someone up than with CHOCOLATE!  I received many thanks.  I wanted to make the frosting a bit richer.  So I used 1-1/4 cup coacoa powder and almost 2 cups powdered sugar.  I probably could have used a little more sugar b/c it was still kinda bitter.  Also had to use at least double the milk.

Oh my soul!  I can't figure out why a few others have had trouble with this recipe.  I bake a lot -- I sell pies and cakes and cookies -- and this was easily the best chocolate cake I've ever made (no, I do not work for Hershey -- in fact, I used different cocoa).  Incredibly moist, dark and delicious.  And I will never make any other kind of chocolate frosting again -- it spread SO easily and was really yummy.

Man, this cake was awesome!!!  I also used coffee instead of just hot water.  It gave it a little extra I think.  Everyone loved it.  I wrapped the left overs in plastic wrap and it stayed sooooo moist!  Yummy :o)

This is the best chocolate cake ever.  My mom isn't very fond of chocolate cake but whenever I make this cake she will eat it.  The same is true with my work friends, they all said they hated chocolate cake and it took one taste and they all were hooked.  My favorite thing about this cake is how moist it stays and how great each bite tastes.

one word "DELICIOUS" I made this cake twice in 1 week, my family loved it. My husband thought it was the "BEST" cake I ever made. This recipe was very simple, just follow EXACTLY what it says, it should come out great. This cake was very moist and delicious. I will definately be using this recipe for my chocolate cakes. Thank you for the recipe, Enjoy.. :)  !

I bake a lot. Absolutely love to cook from scratch and almost always take first place in baking competitions.  This recipe was a huge disappointment to me.  I made two cakes and threw them both out!  The texture, consistency and flavor of the cake itself were horrid. However, the icing was good.  When I made this cake, I thought that it would be a chocolate dream...sadly, it was this chocolate lover's worst nightmare.  Won't make it again!!

This is the second chocolate cake I've baked in two days.  The first was called Celebration Cake (not from this web site).  It was so dry that after tasting it I did not want anyone else to eat it.  I threw it out.

This cake is wonderfully moist and deliciously chocolate.  Rates 5 stars in my book!

Wow, this cake is EXCELLENT!!  I'm not a big chocolate lover, and made this for my husband, but ended up eating as much as he did!!  I made the double layer, and instead of the chocolate frosting, I used peanut butter and this was incredible!!  Please note, maybe it was just my oven, but the cake was done after 23 minutes, so be careful not to overbake.  It came out moist and wonderful!!  This cake will be made over and over in my house!!

wow! this cake was so good! i've been a betty crocker or duncan hines cake mix girl my whole life, but now that i'm going to school in london i can't always find the mixes (or they are to expensive). This was so easy and it tasted so chocolately and moist- I will definitely make it again. I frosted with chocolate frosting (from this web page) and made some fresh whipped cream to eat it with. Delicious!

OMG! These taste like Devil's Food, only better because I made them from scratch. Instead of water, I used strongly brewed coffee. I learned with previous chocolate dessert recipes that it brings out the flavor of the chocolate. I halved the recipe and made 12 large cupcakes. The smell coming out of the oven was amazing. I'm a boxed cake girl, but I only had yellow and strawberry mix on hand. I swear I'm never going to buy boxed chocolate cake mix again. These were too easy to make and the results were phenomenal. Don't be fooled by how thin the mixture is. They rise up beautifully and are moist beyond compare. You could easily put mini chocolate chips into the batter for even more chocolatey-ness.

The frosting is so delicious.. But I only added about 190gms of icing sugar...which is half of what the recipe states..I suggest that those who prefer a more deeper bittersweet chocolate flavor to do that too.. and add a little more milk instead...the cake however was very moist so it sort of crumbled as i tried to make a two layer cake..so its impt that u let it cool completely before frosting it..

my daughter wanted me to bake her a chocolate cake over the xmas holidays...this was the best.  I have to make it twice.  the first time i made it, she didnt get a chance to have a slice..that is how fast it was gone.  I absolutely love this recipe.  When i finished the batter, i saw that it was watery and thought OMG, what happened...but i left i continued, because the recipe said it would be watery....it is the best...truly the best...i pull this out every time someone asks me to bake a chocolate cake...I LOVE IT....try it...I am a very hard critic...SO TRUST ME YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE IT!!!!!!!!

This cake is absolutely delicious! It's very moist and chocolately. I used coffee instead of water for a richer flavor. You must use oil in the recipe, not butter or shortening. I once tried making it with butter and the cake turned out dry. I use canola oil for the best results. The frosting is good also, but it is too sweet for my taste so I altered it slightly, using 2-1/4 cups sugar and 1-1/2 cups cocoa for a more chocolately taste, although it is still sweet.

i've had this recipe for quite a while. i like it because it is so moist and had a very good flavor. i make it for the guys in my husbands shop (at the A.F. base), they all just love it. when i make a 2 layer cake with it sometime i will open a can of cherry pie filling and add that (on the plate) around the bottom of the cake.
the cherry flavor goes very well with the cake.

best chocolate cake ever! 
i have made a few changes to make it my own.
1cup buttermilk(or 1 c. milk plus 1tbs. lemon juice)  
1cup coffee(made with boiling water/instant espresso powder)
omit the oil! use 1cup soft butter!!!!!!!!!
trust me! these changes have created a cake that is sooooo moist and flavorful! the leftovers(if any!) keep so well!

I was so glad to see there were a few others that had problems with this recipes. My husband (an experienced baker) made this last week, and it was a DISASTER! It overflowed the two pans, and the consistency was spongy and altho the taste was ok, it was nothing to write home about.
We tried it once again (due to the all the great reviews, we figured we did something wrong) and the same thing happened...a real mess!

Pure Chocolate Heaven! I doubled this recipe and made it into a sheet cake for my large chocolate-lovin' family. As per another review I replaced the boiling water with coffee. I replaced the milk in the frosting with coffee as well. Everyone felt extra "Happy" after eating the cake, (which didn't last long, by the way). This cake lives up to it's name. It is perfectly chocolate-y and perfectly delicious.

This is an excellent cake recipe.  I substitute soft/partially melted  butter for the oil, and it works nicely.  It's the only chocolate cake I've had that is good even right out of the oven; however, it IS better after setting overnight.  I also put a bit more sugar than it calls for. not exactly 'heaping' cups, but close.

WOW. (And I know my cakes.) Even the frosting, I mean really, I couldn't believe how good this cake is (and I didn't even make it). This recipe is the best, bar none. A friend of mine made it & told me where she got the recipe - from the back of the Hershey's Cocoa tin! The cocoa is unusually dark - almost purple, but the end result is just fantastic. :)

This is by far the best chocolate cake I've ever eaten.  My friend turned me onto this recipe that she found on the back of the Hershey's container.  My family loves it but refuses to let me frost them ever again.  They say it is so moist and good they don't want the frosting to ruin the cake.  Make it exactly as it calls for and be careful not to OVER FILL!  Never more that 2/3's maximum in the pan.

LOVED THIS!  Moist, moist. moist! Used perked Dunkin' Donuts Dark coffee for the water.    Took the flavor deeper. Used almond extract with the vanilla. The frosting needed a boost of 4 tablespoons of butter flavored crisco to cut the sweetness for our taste but had great flavor.  Will make this often!

A delicious cake with just the texture I was looking for--dense, chocolaty, moist.  A word of warning to those making this cake, however: the layers do not rise very high, so if you're one of those people who like "MILE-HIGH" chocolate cakes, this recipe will not please you.  Now, if you're like me, and you like your chocolate cake to be more on the "giant truffle" side than on the "light and airy" side, then this recipe is perfect.  And it's not too rich, just enough to satisfy.  I followed the cake recipe exactly and frosted and filled it with whipped cream.  Yum!

I make this more than any other and it is the BEST hands down and I don't even use any frosting and it SO VERY moist.  The hard part is sharing it and not keeping it for myself... lol **Update 8/30/10** - I have used this recipe for cupcakes, two layer cakes and bundt cakes. No matter which way you serve it, it is CONSISTENTLY delicous and moist. Because I use Food Processor Chocolate Whipped Cream Frosting from this site, I had to put this in the fridge due to the +80* weather we have had. This cake stood up to being covered and refrigerated for over 1.5 weeks in both a 2 layer version and a regular cupcake version!!! It never lost it's moistness - AMAZING!!!

For a little extra chocolate kick, add 2 cups of milk chocolate chips after the batter is in the pans.

Wonderful cake! Everyone loved it.  I made two cakes, a cake using regular AP flour and another using gluten-free flour.  With a few additions  to the GF one (extra cocoa and milk) it was also very delicious. Both were awesome cakes.  I frosted them with cream cheese frosting II from this site and also pressed pecans around it.  Yum

This is a really awesome cake.  I agree, it does fall apart easily.  I decided to use parchment paper and I am glad that I did.  It really helped.  I also decided to use a cup of coffee instead of using boiling water.  I don't think it really made that big of a difference the coffee was mild.  I also liked the fact that it didn't rise in the center like a lot of cakes do.  When I got done frosting it, it looked like a cake from the bakery.  Really easy to make and yummy.  :)

** I did not use Hershey's cocoa-- I just used regular ol' Western Family cocoa.  It worked great!  Also, I did not make the frosting, only the cake (I ran out of cocoa powder).  It was EXCELLENT-- very very good!  This is super moist & the perfect amount of chocolate!  I will make it again & again!

Awesome! I found absolutely nothing wrong with this cake!! I baked a 9x13 cake for Eid (Muslim holiday) and iced it with a butter frosting (chocolate frosting was too much for me!) and it was gone within hours! People visited again just to have a bite of the cake and called for leftovers! Its moist, chocolatey, yummy!!!

Yum!  Moist and delicious.  I actually much prefer to make the frosting as a sauce. The only changes I make to the frosting is to cut the cocoa down to 1/2 cup so it makes a runny sauce. I keep the cake/sauce separate then drizzle it on the cake/dish right before serving. It makes it look very elegant and is till rich/chocolatey.

I also definitely recommend greasing/flouring the pans before baking as I just sprayed it with non-cook spray and the cake came out in clumps and did not stay as a cake (but still was eaten up quickly)

DO NOT TRY TO MAKE THIS CAKE. It will over run in the oven. I followed the directions exactly as written. What  a mess it made in my oven. I did not change anything. I was very careful to follow to the directions.

I am rating just the cake portion. So good! Not too chocolately or sweet. Fluffy and just melts in your mouth.  I halved the recipe to make a 6 inch double layer cake, baked for 30 minutes. The cake came out of the pan perfectly, no breaking, cracking or crumbling.

I had to try this recipe twice b4 I got it right. If you're looking for a good recipe this is it! Don't be fooled by how watery it is. As long as you don't overcook it...u'll be fine. For a little extra flavor, I used a 1tsp almond extract. I made my own frosting which I'll try to figure out how to post in the recipe section. Since I used 3 8-inch pans..i needed this amount...u can 1/2 it for a 2-layer: 6 blocks unsweetened choc sqrs., 2 cans condensed milk...heat until smooth...add 1stick butter and 2 egg yolk (beaten)...mix thoroughly (if desired add, 1 tsp or so of vanilla extract plus 1.2 tsp almond)... Set aside until lukewarm... Then frost!!!!

It's very rare that you'll find me scraping off any frosting. But, this had me doing so.  The cake?  Holy Smokes! (Made it with coffee - wow, what a difference!) Rich, decadent, chocolate heaven.  But, the frosting?  Not so much.  Too sweet and didn't complement the cake at all.  I'd make the cake recipe again, but definitely find a new frosting.

my cake turned out awesome but only because i made a couple changes- i substituted 1 cup of water with one cup of fresh brewed coffee, also substituted applesauce for the oil and it was delicious! Also, for the frosting i only added 2 cups of sugar and it was super sweet, might not even need that much! definitely not 3 cups...

I made this today for the first time as I only have used boxed mixes in the past. I cannot say enough about this cake. It is by far perfect. Fudgy and moist, sooo flavorful without being too sweet. I confess that I didn't "make" the frosting and used dark chocolate canned frosting but it was still amazing. You have to try this recipe!! This is a keeper for sure.

I played around a little with this recipe... so bear with me. The icing was really thick and strong so I added about 4 oz of cool whip. If I did it again, I might add more; I like fluffy icing. I also added chocolate chips to the cake mix, and then stored it in the refrigerator. This was a bad idea, since when we tried to cut the cake it was very thick... after it setlled to room temperature it wasn't so bad, though. The flavor of the batter was very very good, and had I added half a bag of chocolate chips instead of the whole bag, it might have tasted phenomenal. Next time I make it I'll either leave the chocolate chips out entirely, or I'll just add fewer. Since it's two layers, when they sank to the bottom of the pan, it wasn't a bad deal since you have a layer of cake, and then a layer of chocolate chips. ^^; I also used microwaved evaporated milk (be careful, it bubbles) instead of the boiling water. Made for a very thick, rich cake, but it may have been fluffier with just water. The flavor was very very good altogether, I'll definitely be using this recipe again, thanks!

Yum, I love this cake! This recipe has taken over the old chocolate cake recipe that my mom would always make for mine and my siblings' birthdays. She and my dad have also said that this is the richest, best chocolate cake they've ever had. The frosting tastes almost like fudge too. I have made this recipe over and over....everyone loves it!

This Chocolate cake recipe is excellent for people who love very moist cakes. For a science fair project I did  "What maks a perfect chocolate cake" and used this recipe as one of my four testers. I found out it was very popular with the younger crowd(students), who find it chocolaty and delicious, while most of the teachers and staff thought it too soggy and bland.  All a matter of preference to texture I think, so to bring out a little more flavor I substituted a cup of boiling water with a cup of simmered milk.

this is the first recipe that i have ever made that was completely horrible!!! it deserves zero stars. i didn't substitute anything & even bought baking soda specially for this cake. just like another reviewer said, it was very spongy, sticky, soft & not chocolatey AT ALL!!! i'm so disappointed that i wasted all of my valuable ingredients on this cake that's headed for the trash for sure. how misleading all the 5 star reviews are.

This is the recipe from the Hershey's cocoa box and I have used it for years. Its the best chocolate cake recipe I have ever made. Note to those whose cake turned out drier... I'm not a chef but when I try to hurry like today and not pull out the mixer and just do it by hand wisking or with a spoon, it does turn out a little drier. If you follow the recipe exactly and use the Hershey's cocoa it turns out so moist you don't even need the frosting.  I like using cream cheese frosting flavored with mint instead of vanilla and serve with mint chocolate chip icecream. YUM.

I love this recipe.  I actually add about 3 tablespoons of Miracle Whip in addition to the other ingredients for added moisture.  It stays moist for at least a week.  The frosting is great too, but I usually use it on yellow cake.  I put a cream cheese frosting on this cake and it is wonderful.  And finally, I use the Splenda sugar blend for baking (no one can tell that there is any Splenda in the cake).  Wonderful!

This is my husband's favorite chocolate cake.  Whenever I'm asked to bring a dessert for something, he begs me to make it!  I've made it numerous times, and have never had a problem with it rising, as a couple of reviewers have noted.  I think I'll try substituting coffee for the boiling water, as a couple of people have suggested.  If you're making the 9-inch layers, you might want to increase the frosting a bit; it'll cover, but not as thickly as I like it to.    EDITED TO ADD: I made this for New Year's Eve, and substituted some strong hot coffee for the water; it added a depth to the cake that we really loved.

I was a bit disappointed in the taste of this cake but one thing for sure, it came out nice and moist and rich in colour.  For some reason, I didn't find the taste to be very chocolatey.  It seemed a bit bland but maybe it's because I didn't use Hershey's cocoa powder (although what I did use - Fry's - is supposed to be a premium cocoa powder...).  Also, I have never made cake with vegetable oil before, but this one definitely had a distinctive taste and aroma that could only be described as odd which I'm sure was due to the oil.  I don't think I will make this again and if I do, it will be with many changes - butter instead of vegetable oil, 1/2 coffee 1/2 water, 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white.

Great cake!  I made this in a pinch when I had made another recipe for chocolate cake and it failed.  This was a simple, and quick fix at the last minute.  It turned out delicious and moist too!  I didn't use the frosting recipe, as I has already made some great white chocolate frosting.  Maybe the next time I make this cake I will try the frosting too.

I would actually like to rate this as 4 1/2 stars.  This recipe produces a really good cake, not the best but close to it.  The first day the cake seemed to be lacking something and didn't have much flavor, but it was moist.  I thought I would be disappointed.  However, the flavors seemed to develop and set overnight.  This is a good recipe for those who are looking for a medium-flavored chocolate cake and not too sweet.  The frosting is awesome!  I usually don't care for frosting, but I had to resist licking the bowl.  For this recipe, it is a perfect balance because I think if the cake were on the sweet side, the entire cake would be more like Claim Jumper's Mother Load (which is what I am looking for.)

This was definetly a good recipe! Everyone who had some, couldn't believe I made it. One person even said to me "this is so good, you should really consider going to cooking school". Yes, it was rich, but why not treat yourself once in a while? I pay $5 for a piece of cake like this in a cafe or restaurant, and that's how much a tin of cocoa costs! So, its worth it, and it would be an excellent cake to make for guests who are chocolate lovers. Those of you who said it was dry and too sweet, obviously did not follow the directions thoroughly! The only way I altered the recipe was, when it called for 3 cups of icing sugar, I only used 2, because I only needed 2 cups for my preference of spreading consistentcy. It's a good thing I didn't listen to the other reviews when I gave this recipe a try, because they were dead wrong!

This cake came out perfectly! I followed another reviewer's advice and substituted strong coffee for the boiling water, which really brings out the chocolate flavour. This recipe has been around forever, and it's a classic for a reason. So good, especially with the chocolate buttercream--and I'm typically not even an icing fan. This will become my staple chocolate cake.

Amazing cake!  The icing was the best I have tried in a long time -- perfect consistency for spreading a thick layer! I found the cake itself took about 45 minutes to bake and still stuck to the pan a bit; it might be worth putting a circle of parchment paper in the bottom of the pan to help it come out cleaner. It received rave reviews from some pretty tough critics, this one is definitely a keeper!

This is a delicious "from scratch" chocolate cake recipe.  If you are looking for a recipe that tastes like a "boxed cake" then this isn't it (that delicious boxed cake taste unfortunately comes from all the chemical additives listed on the box ingredients...I really don't think you can duplicate that yummy made from chemicals taste with home ingredients!).  This cake is the next best thing to boxed cake...without all the additives.  It is moist, fluffy and delicious.  I always make mine a day ahead, because for some reason it tastes better the next day.  As stated, the batter will be watery - but it bakes up tall, moist and delicious-ly chocolate.  I frost mine with vanilla butter cream and it's to die for.  Don't be afraid of this recipe...just follow directions and you'll be fine (the people that had problems with this cake must have skipped a step...I've made this at LEAST 10 times - in a couple different ovens - and each time it turns out perfect).

This is an EXCELLENT recipe...so easy!! I made one cake in a 9x13 pan and baked for a little less than 35 minutes...it came out perfectly! It really is a "perfect" homemade chocolate cake! Very moist! I will definitely make this again!

Not a big chocolate cake fan, but this was delicious!  I made it as a birthday cake and used cream cheese frosting instead since the birthday boy requested it.  This recipe is a keeper!

I made it for my Foods&Nutrition class party, and it was absolutely deelish. Very moist, and rich in flavour. However, I plead guilty. I didn't use Hershey's cocoa powder, but it still turned out, so don't feel hesitant if you have a different brand! Definitely one of the best chocolate cakes I've ever made, hands down. Yum!

Addendum: I sprinkled some semi-sweet chocolate chips on the top just to make it that much more chocolate-y.

I chose this recipe after reading all of the hundreds of rave reviews. I guess I was expecting the clouds to part and a light from heaven to shine on it when I took it out of the oven. Overall, it as a decent cake. But I have certainly had better. I give it three stars because it was tasty, but no where near spectacular. Perhaps the people giving it five stars have only tasted box cakes??? I will keep looking for the perfect chocolate cake, and I won't be putting this good but uninspired cake in my recipe box.

I wanted to make cupcakes with this recipe, and I followed the directions on the back of the box of Hershey's cocoa exactly. Not a bad flavor(though not chocolaty enough), but the texture was just weird--very spongy and a bit dry.  I know I didn't over-bake these, so I don't know what could have gone wrong, but I will not be making this again.

I love this cake.  When we go to family get-togethers; they ask me to bring "The Cake"!  I use boiling strong coffee instead of water and dutch cocoa.  I use bavarian cream filling and chocolate frosting.  It is very, very good.

This is absolutely the best cake ever! I'd give it 10 stars if I could! I didn't use the frosting, though, since it got mixed reviews. I've made this twice and both times it has fallen in the middle a bit. I could be too eager in taking it out. Also, I wouldn't recommend this if you're sculpting for a 3D kids cake. It's much too moist. But, perfect to keep in the pan. My husband thanks you!

It was my first time to bake a chocolate cake from scratch.  This is the best chocolate cake I have ever tasted.  Better than store bought.  I decreased the powdered sugar to 2 cups and less than 1/3 of the milk.  I also substituted non fat milk to cut down on the calories.  I used low fat butter too and it tasted great.  However since I am baking with a convection oven, the cake peaked and cracked.  The middle part was not completely cooked.  I will be reducing the heat next time and use magic strips to cool down my pan while baking.

i was asked to make a chocolate cake for one of my managers at work so i used this recipe. everyone loved it. i used whipped double cream for the filling and made it a 3 layer cake. i thought the icing was a bit runny and had to add corn starch to thicken it up. if i make it again i will refrigerate the chocolate icing for a few hours or overnight to make it a bit firmer before i spread it. it was very hot and it started to melt a bit on the way to work in my car. this meant it flopped to one side a bit. was still very moist and rich an yummy!!!!

Excellent texture, flavor, and richness.  This is a very dense, chocolatey cake, so if you are looking for a fluffy cake this is not it.  Can't really understand how you would mess up this cake.  The batter is very thin - almost liquid - but the cake turns out fine.

the cake it self is wonderful, the frosting however I didn't care for, I would prefer a cream cheese, or another chocolate recipe.. I cut the recipe in half just to test the cake out and it made a pretty big cake, I already put half in the freezer so I don't eat it.. LOL. but I will make this again, but with another frosting recipe... infact it's almost good enough with just a glaze... I'll play around, thanks!

A chocoholics dream come true!  I subtituted applesauce for the oil in the cake mix and the results were fine.  The cake batter is very thin but don't worry...it works.  Be warned, the cake does "fall" a little but not enough to do any damage.

The name says it all..."perfectly chocolate" !!!  The frosting is the best I have tried.  I am usually not much of a frosting fan, but this was awesome.  I followed the recipes as written with the exception of using skim milk in both the cake and the frosting. I did need to adda couple extra tablespoons of the milk in the frosting to get it just right, but other than that no changes are needed.  This recipe is a keeper!!!

this cake was excellent. because i made it for a friend's birthday, i used butter instead of oil in the cake (more fat = tastes better). everyone loved it! the only suggestion i'd make is to remind you to wait until the cake is very, very cool to frost it; due to impatient friends, i frosted it a little early and the frosting pulled at the cake a little.

The recipe was good. In fact it was delicous, the only thing that I did not like was that the cake was to spongey and the picture on the recipe main page did not look like mines at all. The frosting it said with the cake was so thin. But the cake was still delicous.

Did this cake few weeks ago and its in total mess. Maybe becos i wasnt that skilled in baking cakes. After the second try, the cake turn out fabulous. Thanks to all the reviews and feedbacks. For the frosting, I've cut down the sugar to 2 cups(or even lesser) and did not add extra milk as it may become too flowy. I also added more cocoa powder for strong chocolate taste and also to adjust the consistency of the frosting. Remeber to grease pan real well if u dont want your cake to break into pieces as its really a moist cake. Use wax or baking sheets to bottom the pan then grease on the paper itself. Sure will make this again!

This is my favorite chocolate cake recipe ever! I just love how easy it is to make and how moist it is. I usually split the recipe in half, but round the flour up to 1 cup, then make 12 nicely sized cupcakes that take 15 to 20 minutes to bake. Thanks for the great recipe, this is the only chocolate cake recipe that I will ever use.

OH MY GOD!!! THIS IS THE BEST CHOCOLATE CAKE EVER!!!!! It is sooo moist and delicious. I can't believe that I actually made it from scratch, and it actually looks exactly like it does in the picture! I'll never go back to a box cake again! Only thing I changed was that I cut out parchment paper rounds and greased them with butter instead of greasing and flouring pans and the cake pooped right out! They were perfect rounds! (usually they always get stuck to the bottom of the pan, even with greasing and flouring)So I definetly recommend doing this. I also just bought store bought milk chocolate frosting. I used one and a half tubs of it by the way. My whole family raved about how good this was and have already name it they're favorite!

WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL, TASTY AND WONDERFUL!!!  I constantly get asked to make this cake by family, friends and co-workers.  I do also use a half a package of instant chocolate or fudge pudding to make it very moist.  I also use a tad bit less on the salt.  Worth making definately!

Oh My Goodness!!!  This cake was AWESOME!  I made it for my mother in law's birthday, and it was a hit!  Everyone loved it, and my in laws actually took the leftovers home, which they never do with a store bought birthday cake! lol. Thanks for the magnificent recipe!  I am making another one for a labor day cookout this Monday!

I have attempted this recipe 3 times; each time the layers resembled fudge. My measurements were exact and I followed the instructions to the letter. When approaching the third attempt I even did some research with regard to measuring, mixing, pan size, oven temperature, etc.  I give it a 1 for now.  I will try again, given all other reviews. Any suggestions from other readers would be appreciated.  (p.s. - I am an avid baker: yeast bread (no machine here!), muffins, quick brads, biscuits,you name it, I bake it!)

Excellent, moist and very rich.  Easy to prepare, however for kids, the boiling water needs supervision.  Perfect cake for entertaining, birthdays or pot luck suppers. No changes to recipe for high altitute.

This was thee best chocolate cake! I made it for my son's b'day and everyone knew it was from scratch! My kids ask me to save some of the icing to eat. 
The first time I followed the icing recipe as is. The cake slid around and the icing was a little drippy (even though I added extra confectioners sugar-used a whole box!). Now when I make it, I only add a drop of milk.

Too Yummy!  I'd give this more stars if I could.  There is not a boxed mix that can touch this moist, chocolatey recipe.  I've made this cake three times in the last month and will never use another recipe for chocolate cake. I think the boiling water is what sets this cake apart.  The frosting is really rich and since I'm not a frosting fan to begin with, I'd do the frosting as a drizzle as someone else suggested, by adding more milk to thin it out.  I think I'll go make a cake. :)

PERFECT IS RIGHT! I have made this cake 4 times in the last month.  The best part is the icing, so if you have a cake you already enjoy try this on top! I don't usually like icing much--it's always too sweet,but I only put in 2cups of powdered sugar and add a little milk and a tiny bit more cocoa to make a dark choc. taste.  After combining cocoa and butter, just add sugar and milk slowly to your liking and it will be great!

Always comes out perfect! Helpful tips for cake: 1) Microwave 1 cup of water in a glass pyrex on high for 3-4 minutes instead of boiling. 2) Use parchment rounds on bottom of pans (along with flour/butter or Pam) to reduce sticking. For frosting: For less-runny frosting, soften butter instead of melting.

Wow....this cake wasn't that great. My friend and I made it so many times, so Im pretty sure we didnt make any mistakes every single time. It was way to moist, so I suggest not adding the extra cup of water. It really didnt have much flavour, either. Could have been chocolatyer. But whenever we make brownies or other cakes, we DO use the icing. We just add a tad more vanilla and cocoa powder. This cake was really dissapointing.

The first words out of my husbands mouth was "wow, is it ever moist"  I didn't have any boxed chocolate mix on hand, so, I did something I haven't done in years - made a cake from scratch.  This recipe has renewed my faith homemade cakes.  It's worth the time and effort.  It took me about 5 minutes longer than a boxed cake and wow - what a difference.  Really, really chocolaty, moist, and just all around great!!!!  I was a little worried pouring the runny batter into the pans, but the cakes turned out perfectly!  Thanks!

I love the cake base(because of the tips I got here, I used coffee too instead of water), but the frosting was a disappointment. It was almost like a fondant icing, grainy and too sweet. So I made a new frosting using 100g heavy cream, and 100g(or more) choco chips. I think it suited the cake base better.

I'm definitely making this recipe again(except frosting), but I will add more cocoa to make it more chocolatey, and 1/2 cup butter to make it even more moist.

My family has been using this recipe for at least 30 years.  The cake by itself is moist and rich but the fudgy icing sets it off even more.  My mom actually used to cook the icing just for a few minutes which made it even more rich and yummy (I'm too lazy to, hehe)

I've been using this recipe for years and it always comes out great! I use my own chocolate frosting recipe so I can't
comment on this recipes frosting. Sometimes I even top with a chocolate ganache and use a cherry pie filling in the middle. Yum! Note* Trying using half butter and half shortening for your frosting recipes. It holds up better and pipes well. Use just enough milk in your frostings (adding a Tbsp. at a time)
for spreading consistency.

Pay absolutely no attention to the few negative reviews. They insist they are not doing anything wrong, but I insist they are. This cake is moist, delicious and full of chocolate flavor. It is by far our favorite cake recipe, and has been for more than 25 years.

One hint to the naysayers: You must measure your ingredients carefully, and do not Whip or Beat the hot water into the batter. The recipe says stir, so stir. Not once has my batter overflowed the pan, and I've made this cake at least 100 times.

INCREDIBLE! PHENOMENAL! Served with superlatives. It has a moist, tender crumb, and full chocolate flavor. I used buttermilk in place of the milk called for, and increased the soda by 1/2 tsp (2 tsp total) in order to offset the acid imparted by the buttermilk. It's the quintessential American chocolate cake. Made 3 -8" layers, baked for 30 minutes.

i made this from the recipe on the side of the cocoa can and then an AR member pointed out the recipe was on the site and i had to review it. i didnt make the frosting only the cake. this cake is a keeper! im not a scratch baker i always use a box cqke mix. no more! well not for chocolate. this recipe is easy and not intimidating and came together beautifully. its moist and rich and even though i frosted it with a canned coconut pecan frosting i dont think it really needs more than a light dust of powdered sugar or a simple glaze. totally proud of myself and my clients at work ate it up. five stars all the way.

This is an excellent recipe. I made it for a birthday at work and everyone loved it. When I told them it was from scratch they couldn't believe it. I am glad I read the reviews before I made it because I would have thought I did something wrong due to it being a "runny" batter. Will definately make again and again.

Well I read most of the reviews and then made the cake.  It certainly was not the best cake I have ever made.  My family each ate a piece and we tossed the rest out.  It had a poor texture and lacked true chocolate flavor.  It was not the chocolate indulgence I had hoped for.  Disappointed on the results and I won't make it again.  For those of you who thought this was the best cake ever all I can say to you is keep baking baby because it gets better than this!

The only part I occasionally vary is the chocolate frosting for peanut butter frosting : )  Both top this perfect chocolate cake very well!

This cake is so delicious.  Nice and moist and the icing is pretty good as well.  I added half milk half heavy cream to the icing for a richer flavor and it was so good.  You just need to play around with the icing as to your taste- if you feel like it doesn't taste like it has enough butter or milk-just add a little more.  You can't go wrong.  I think the key to a great chocolate anything is making it a day or two in advance beacuse the great chocolate flavor comes out after it sits for awhile.  ENJOY!

I have been making this cake for years now. It always comes out with excellent results and great compliments. My gramma used to make this cake, too. So you know this recipe has been around for a long time. I don't understand some of the other reviews that said the cake came out dry? This is one of the most moist cakes, I have ever made. You have to follow the recipe exactly, or you won't get good results. It's a great basic recipe for a great old fashioned chocolate cake.

I must have done something wrong, because this blew up all over my oven.  I've never had a cake do this before.  I double-checked everything, including pan size.  Any adjustments for high-altitude (over 6,000 ft)?

I've made this over and over...don't know how I haven't memorized the recipe yet. It's definitely moist and chocolaty. It's just a little hard to spread icing on it because it's so moist. 

Otherwise, it's my go-to chocolate cake recipe for the longest time.

I made this cake for a party and everyone loved it. There was one small piece left and my daughter, who is not ordinarily a chocolate fan, tried it and also loved it!

I made this cake from the recipe on the Hershey's Cocoa box... and it is the best chocolate cake I have ever made. I made it for a birthday at work, and the cake dissppeared in frighting speed. I followed the directions exactly, and it was simple and perfect. I want to try other Hershey's recipes now!

I made this cake for a company function and it was a hit! A good chocolate cake can mean different things to different people - this cake was mildly sweet, extremely moist, simple to make and truly delectable. I will definitely make it again!

This cake is AMAZING. Yes it's the recipe on the back of the Hershey's box, so what? It's not like they are claiming it isn't a Hershey's cake!  I always make the bundt cake and it's divine. My roommates love it, my co-workers love it, EVERYONE loves it.   For the frosting, I usually only use half the confectioners' sugar it calls for. It makes a delicious dark chocolate frosting that even people who never eat the frosting gobble it right up!

This is, without a doubt, the best chocolate cake I've ever made.  I didn't change a thing except I did press mini chocolate chips into the frosting for added chocolate yummYness.  I have shared this recipe with friends and family and they all agree, best.cake.ever.

This cake was great. I made it for my daughter's 8th birthday and she loved it. I didn't make the frosting because I needed to decorate the top (she wanted a Barbie cake). I will be making this many more times I am sure since my family are all chocolate fans.

This is a wonderful recipe for your basic chocolate cake with chocolate frosting and it can very well stand on its on. I only give it 4 stars because I think I made it better by changing it just a bit. Where the cake recipe called for 1 cup boiling water, I put in 1 cup of hot strong coffee. Instead of adding 2 teaspoons of vanilla, I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 1 teaspoon of Kalhua. In the frosting I also added about 1 tablespoon of coffee and then had to add a little more powdered sugar, but it tastes great. Also, while frosting the cake, I added a good covering of HEATH chocolate toffee bits in the center of the two layers and then sprinkled them on the tops and side of the cake for that extra crunch and ofcourse the extra chocolate. Now, I would give it 5 stars.

I make this cake all the time and everyone loves it! I make it with a buttercream frosting II recipie I got off of this site, and it tastes like eating a huge moist oreo cookie. It is easy to make. I suggest lining the pans with parchment paper  for easy removal. Also great as a death by chocolate base.

This recipe says it's for a 2 layer 9" cake. I used the same cake pans I normally use for a packaged cake mix of the same size. While baking, the batter overflowed the cake pans and burned all over the bottom of my oven. What a mess! This recipe should say that extra large pans are needed!

I made this cake for a birthday and everyone loved it.  It is incredibly sweet and chocolately.  I made three 8 inch layers, which I had to bake in shifts because I only have two 8 inch pans.  I learned my lesson (should have listened to another reviewer) when I tried to get the first two layers out of the pans.  I used the grease and flour method, and they stuck in the pans terribly and had to be pieced back together somewhat.  For the last layer I used non-stick spray and a wax paper circle in the bottom of the pan.  It popped out in one piece and looked perfect.  The whole cake looked great once it was frosted and you couldn't tell the layers had broken somewhat.  I also found it necessary to double the recipe for the frosting.  I would never have had enough to frost the top, sides, and in between the layers.  A single batch would suffice if you made the sheet cake, however.

Very good cake. I did not add the 1 tsp salt to the cake portion. Just seemed like a lot of salt on top of the baking soda.  The frosting was a good consistency. I added 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract to the frosting and thought it was a nice compliment to the chocolately-ness of this cake.

My husband would give this 5 stars, but the kids and I drop to 4.  Don't overbake cuz it gets dry very easily.  For the frosting, I agree that melting the butter makes it too loose, but if you don't it's really hard to get all the lumps out.  It's definitely a bittersweet chocoholic item, not a sugary chocolate.

You can't go wrong with this one!  It's a deliciously moist cake. The ONLY change I made was to use butter instead of the 1/2 cup oil in the cake (I prefer the taste of butter). I lined the bottom of the pans with parchment paper, so that I don’t have to do all that greasing and flouring.  Cakes slide right out of the pans.  My hubby loves this receipe, and one evening when I was tired and he wanted cake, he got up and made this cake himself! It's addictive so waistlines beware!

WOW! I had hoped to find an easy, moist and delicious chocolate cake that I could make from scratch. I sure found it with this recipe! I made the cake on a Tuesday night and although it took us a while to eat it (10 days), it was just as moist on the last day as on the first. Thanks for an amazing recipe! I've already passed it along.

Lately I feel like alot of the 5 star recipes are not 5 star recipes in my book so I was totally expecting to be disappointed with this recipe.  NOT SO!  It deserves 5 stars!!! HOORAY! I used to used boxed chocolate cake mix and "doctor" it with some sour cream and cocoa.  I will only make this chocolate cake from now on.  It was absolutely delicious.  It was moist, it had a rich chocolate taste without being bitter or too fudgy.  It was slightly dense but not heavy or brownie like.  Really, just perfect.  I am making a sheet cake this weekend for a party for my 6 year old son and I can't wait to have another piece!  You will not be sorry if you make this cake. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out beautiful!!

This recipe is extremely easy, i didnt have to change any of the directions. It's just as good as the box recipes. I use this recipe all the time. You can add extra flavor to it by adding any type of extract to both the frosting and the cake; i used mint extract and in turned out heavenly.

Been making this recipe for years. Perfect every time! Batter will be runny, but don't change a thing and you'll have a moist, perfectly chocolate cake every time! This chocolate icing is excellent also! Just the right amount of chocolate in both!

This was ok.  It wasn't very moist. It didn't taste horrible or anything, but I would rather have a moist chocolate cake.  It seemed super dry to me.  The frosting was very chocolatey.  You would definitley need a glass of milk to eat this cake.  A moist chocolate cake recipe I would suggest is One Bowl Chocolate Cake I.

I have been making this cake with a little extra vanilla for a few years now.  I use it as my base birthday or event cake before decorating it.  I get a lot of compliments on how moist and delicious it is.  They hardly believe I found it on the back of a cocoa box.  Try it you will love it.

Well I tried this cake 2 times and still didn't like the taste.  It wasn't moist for me and I followed it exactly.  My cake cracked and started to fall apart even with icing on.  The icing is way to runny and very gritty.  I don't know if I did something wrong to the icing to make it so runny.  Anyone else have this problem?  I am looking for another recipe now.

The cake was fine, however the icing was a nightmare. I did everything that it asked perfectly, but the icing was just SO SO runny. The recipe should have required more allowed more time to prepare so that you could allow the icing to cool to thicken up. I'm now out of time (for the party) & the cake has to iced. Its not good looking.

I agree with the majority - this recipe is excellent!! This was my first attempt at baking a chocolate cake, and although it turned out a little flatter than I had expected - it was delicious!!! I had to turn down the oven temperature because I smelt something burning...next time will try again with a higher temperature. otherwise i followed the recipe exactly as it was written. excellent...eager to try other Hershey's recipes. but will definetly be making this one again!

We sandwiched the icing between the two layers and poured chocolate ganache on top, allowing ganache to drip dry before repeating this step again.  Primo, delicious, super Moist cake.  Enjoy with a stout coffee or glass of milk.

My family loves this moist cake. I made this cake with buttermilk and dark cocoa. I used a bundt pan. Since I live at high altitude I had to make a few changes. I added an extra egg, adjusted the oil by using 1/3 cup. This was wonderful!  See my personal recipe--http://allrecipes.com/personalrecipe/64029545/high-altitude-perfectly-chocolate-chocolate-bundt-cake/detail.aspx

I am a huge fan of boxed cake mixes... never again!  This was so easy and delicious!  I used store bought milk chocolate frosting (1 1/2 tubs) and my husband and my small group said this was the best chocolate ckae they had ever tasted.  Serve w/ a big glass of milk- it's rich!

I've now made this cake three times, and it has turned out wonderfully! Rich and flavorful. I took advice from some of the other posters and reduced the heat a bit. Worked very well. I also added a bit more vanilla to the icing, and it really brought a richer flavor to it. Yummy is not word enough for this cake!

My family loved this cake and especially the frosting.  I used an 8 inch pan and I cut the cake in four layers with frosting in between the layers.  It turned out to be a huge cake.  I love the frosting.  You can taste the milk in the frosting.  The cake was moist and not too sweet.  The sweetness came from the frosting.  Drink this with a tall cold glass of milk!  Yummy!

This is world's better than any ol' box cake mix.  It's positively decadent.  Very rich and moist.  It's very easy to make, with an incredible flavor.  Play around with the frosting as you're making it to reach the desired consistancy/flavor. (You might want to add a bit more melted butter.)  I can't imagine why anyone would NOT like this, it's the quintessential chocolate cake!

This cake was absolutely wonderful. I have never made a cake before and this was a great simple recipe. My cake came out beautiful and delicious. I used some off brand cocoa powder but I'm sure it was just as delicious. My family is not as big on chocolate as I am, so, I used a recipe for butter-cream frosting instead and it still was very decadent. I am definitely keeping this recipe on hand.

My family loved this cake.  I did make a few alterations, only because I had to.  I didn't have enough oil on hand so I used half olive oil.  I worried that would make it taste gross, but it didn't.  Also I forgot the vanilla in the cake batter, still it was delicious.  My cake looked exactly like the picture.

This is the chocolate cake recipe most requested by friends and family.  I've made it countless times with satisfying results every time.  It's in my favorite, favorite collection of recipes :)

I thought this cake was delicious. I followed the recipe and it turned out great in 2 round pans. It made a very nice looking high layer cake. I did not make the icing because I didn't have any butter, I used Betty Crocker, next time I will make the buttercream icing because it would make the cake even more delicious. The cake recipe is exaclty the same as another recipe on this site Deep Dark Chocolate Cake, also from hersheyskitchen.com the only difference is the amounts in the buttercream icing.

I used this recipe to make my first cake from scratch since Home Ec. in high school (won't say how long ago that was). - The cake turned out fabulous! Huge hit!! It had a great chocolate flavor w/out being overly sweet AND it was so easy to make. -- I will use this recipe again, but will try the 8" 3-layer next time.

This is delicious but I up it a bit by using Black Magic Cake recipe which is almost identical to this except uses buttermilk and coffee instead of milk and hot water. It also uses one less tsp of vanilla. Either one is delish but I will prob stick with that one as my go to.

Fantastic cake- rich and chocolatey. The batter was really runny, but it worked out perfectly. I loved the icing; very creamy and chocoltey but not too rich. I LOVE THIS CAKE!!!

I found this cake to be quite dense, it would have sank in water! I couldn't eat a whole piece. I made it with shortning instead of oil as i didn't have enough oil, maybe that contributed to it. But the chocolate was quite overpowering. I also made it with cream cheese icing and not the chocolately frosting! So I can imagine that was extremely chocolatey! I would probably make this again to test out the oil vs. shortning theory, and maybe use less cocoa or something. If I were to make it for absolute chocolate lovers I would use the frosting listed with the receipe, but I think the cream cheese icing is the best! I love with so many things! I guess I like a more fluffy, light cake, I didn't get that this time!

This the worst recipe ever! I don't understand how it has such a high rating. (Maybe the people that work for Hershey's rated it)  I am so disappointed.  I bake a lot-- cakes and cookies are my specialities-- and this is the worst chocolate  recipe that I've tried. The texture is horrid and there isn't enough favor.

Love this recipe. I don't bake much so I was hesitant at first to try. This cake was awesome. It was so moist it fell apart (however I rushed before letting it cool because the family couldn't wait either:) but to me that's a good thing because the taste is what matters the most! I also added a half cup mayo & tbsp lemon to the mix while blending while following the rest exactly. For the icing I added cream cheese to make it a little creamier, it was mouth watering de-LISH! And I used a generic brand name baking cocoa. The cake was good plain, not too sweet but just right. The icing is what topped the cake and made the perfect sweetness. Enjoy!

Used strong coffee instead of water as suggested by many.  Cake was DELICIOUS and super moist.  The aroma in the house while it was baking was heavenly.  I used frosting from a can instead of the frosting listed here.  Couldn't be happier with the ease of making and the end taste!

Thank You for this recipe, The cake was very moist and delicious. This was the best chocolate cake that I ever made  from scratch.I don't see how people can go wrong with this recipe.

I made this cake for my sister in laws birthday.  She requested chocolate cake.  It was very spongy......a lot of cake and the cake was tasteless.  The frosting on the other hand was very sweet, too sweet actually.  We ate a few pieces and the rest went in the garbage.

This chocolate cake is awesome. I made a baby rattle cake for my baby shower and used vanilla icing...Delicious. I found myself craving chocolate again so I made this cake but I put peanut butter frosting in between the 2 layers. I frosted the whole cake in chocolate and then crushed reese cups on top. I kept the cake in the frig due to the milk in the frosting and I didnt want the peanut butter cups to melt. It was great with a glass of cold milk :D

This cake is simple to make and turns out moist and very tasty.  It was good the day that I baked it, but it was so much better the next day.  I would suggest making it a the day before you intend to eat it.  I reduced temp to 325 and cooked a little longer, but other than that I followed the recipe for cake and icing exactly as written.

This is the best chocolate cake recipe. It's very easy and moist. I have only baked mine in a 9x13" baking pan (just follow the baking time in the recipe then gradually add to it until a toothpick comes out clean). I love to frost mine with a cool whip pudding frosting. Try "Cool Whipped Frosting" on this site submitted by Shirley.

Hi! Just wanna say that i LOVE this recipie. I don't know why it turned out bad for some of you, but for me, it was my first chocolate cake baked, and it turned out beautiful! EVERYONE loved it! I added less sugar to make it less sweet and more chocolaty, as the frosting was sweet it enough, and it was all wonderful. Maybe, some of you could try lining your baking tins with parchment paper both at the bottom and on the sides, this way, you dont have to grease the tin, and it makes taking the cake out of the tin much easier. i always do that for all cakes i baked. try it!

This is a VERY GOOD & VERY EASY CAKE! I halved the entire recipe & baked it in a springfom pan,9 inch i think...the one in the middle.( if you have that set of 3 pans too) IT WAS PERFECT!! I did adjust the amount of choclate I added about 2 tablespoons more. The frosting is great. warm cake, cold milk, I am having a GOOD DAY!

Excellent cake, prefer "Carolines Chocolate Fudge Frosting" with this cake....Very moist I used Sunflower oil and skim milk...was concerned when the batter looked very liquid but baked up perfectly, I also lined and greased they tins so the cakes turned out perfectly.

This was the first truly homemade chocolate cake I've made and it was fabulous. It was rich and chocolatey and extremely moist. I loved it as did the whole birthday party group who ate it! One note, no hershey's was used...sorry, I'm living down under right now so I used Cadburys cocoa powder. :)

This is the recipe that my family has used for years, but I always found it lacking something.  For a quick easy cake it's still one of the best, though.

This cake is moist, chocolatey and tastes wonderful!!! I gave it 4 stars because the frosting leaves much to be desired. I didn't melt the butter, but softened it, as suggested and it just doesn't come out good. It is very thin, and the powdered sugar doesn't mix well. I realize another reviewer very smugly suggested just add more dry ingredients but that does NOT help at all. My husband loved the cake but agreed with me on the frosting. You are better off just buying a jar of chocolate frosting. Overall, though, this cake is delicious!!!

I tried this cake because I didn't have the ingrediants on hand for my usual homemade cake (which calls for sour cream).  This cake was okay, but really nothing special.  About the same as making a cake from a box.  Not bad, just not great.

I made this today for my husband's birthday and it was a huge hit, even with my brother in law who never eats desert.  I used Fry's cocoa as I couldn't find Hershey's, skim milk and substituted coffee for the boiling water.  The icing was really rich which pleased all the chocolate lovers.  I also made a peanut butter filling for the middle layer which turned out great.  I will definitely be hanging on to this recipe.

I've been asking this recipe for over 25 years. It is fool-proof. If you follow the instructions, it will turn out. Those who say it doesn't perhaps didn't follow the instructions as well as they think they did (i.e. substitutions, type of pan, etc...). If a 13 year old can make it (which is when I started making this recipe), than an adult should be able to pull this off. 

It is the best chocolate cake recipe I have ever had - and it is easy! Everyone who has ever tried this when I've made it LOVES it!

I do not like chocolate cake at all, but I decided to make this cake for a Baby Shower I was hosting.  This cake was outstanding.  I followed the directions as is and it was moist and dense and had a very nice chocolately taste. Don't be scared if the batter is watery after you add the boiling water (the directions state it will be).  I made a 9" double layer cake with chocolate pudding and the icing included with this recipe. For the icing, I cut down the amount of confectioner's sugar by 1/2C and added milk as needed to loosen up the consistency.  I refrigerated the icing for about 10-15min before spreading it on the cake. Definitely try this recipe especially if you like a good chocolate cake.

I am only giving this recipe 3 stars because of the icing. It would have received 1 star otherwise. The cake had no flavor whatsoever. I ended up having to poke holes in the cake and pouring evaporated milk, caramel, and chocolate sauce over the entire thing in order for it to have any taste at all. The frosting on the other hand was great. I addded whipped cream in it to make it more fluffy and not too sweet. Loved the results and will use the frosting again...maybe on a boxed mix.

All those praising 5 star reviews made me think this would be a stunning rich bakery-style chocolate layer cake, but I wasdisappointed.  It wasn't rich nor chocolatey, nor was it very sweet, but that was ok since frostings usually are too sweet.  The frosting with this recipe came out gritty, despite my melting the butter to make a fudgy cocoa when I tried the frosting again.  Perhaps if I used a better brand cocoa it would have better results.  The cake itself was just- blah.  NO chocolate taste, and felt weird in the mouth.  I won't be making this one again.

I'd give this recipe 4 stars for taste and texture (I like a "lighter" cake texture), but 2 for ease of use for making cupcakes. It's hard to put the batter in cupcake tins without creating a huge mess. I will try it in a 2-layer cake, and will use the coffee suggestion as well.

EXCELLENT!  I enjoyed this cake as well as the frosting recipe that came with it immensley!!  However... it is VERY rich!  The next time I make this cake, I will use a vanilla frosting; and the next time I make this chocolate frosting, I will use it on a cake other than chocolate!  But I will definitely... definitely make both of these again!!

I made 2 bundt cakes and it was really simple to make.  The cakes turned out to be rich, moist and chocolately.  I would suggest adding another teaspoon of vanilla extract and dissolved coffee granules for a deeper, intenser flavor.  I'm surprised it tasted so good without any butter.  I'll be making this recipe again.  Thanks.

This cake turned out great!  Very moist and a dark chocolate color.  The type of cake that would be good even without icing. I found that my cake did not rise much, but that may be that I used two small brown farm eggs instead of the bigger ones in the stores.  It was still good and I iced with vanilla icing.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

This cake was moist, rich, chocolaty, and delicious! Instead of the one cup of boiling water I did one cup of boiling water with 1 1/2 tablespoons of instant coffee dissolved in. I think if I hadn't done that it wouldn't have been as chocolaty and good.

Deep chocolate color and flavor. Really wowed my chocolate-loving family and we've tried lots of chocolate cakes in our time! But the frosting is only so-so. We top with another rich ganache-type frosting or a cooked, snow-peak white frosting. The cake, however, is the best recipe I've found.

This cake is dense and quite heavy but oh, so chocolaty and yummy. I iced it with a chocolate fudge icing and the whole thing got rave reviews at our birthday table! Just a note--when the recipe says that the batter will be thin it actually is thin enough that it could be a drink. I hesitated a moment at that point but took the risk and am glad that I did.

If you like a cake that is heavy, spongy, and crumbly at the same time, this one is for you. I followed this to the tee, even using Herseys brand coccoa and it came out cruddy. After I frosted it a piece just fell off! I know I am not the only one who did not like it nor had any luck.

This recipe turned out great for me.  It was the first time I tried a cake from scratch and I was not dissapointed - I will continue to use it since hubby says its right up there with his grandmas chocolate cake.  I made peanut butter icing instead of the chocolate icing

I baked this cake for my husband's birthday (with peanut butter frosting).  He loved it!  In fact, he told me that this is the best cake he has ever eaten in his life!  WOW!  You have to try this one!  It's definitely going in my permanent recipe box.  Wonderful and very moist!!

This cake was a huge hit, even a friend who doesn't like cake enjoyed it. It is the perfect amount of chocolate, not too sweet or rich. It's very easy to make, especially if you have a Kitchenaid. I served it chilled and it was very tasty.

The cake turned out great, moist and tasty.  Icing was nothing special at all, not very chocolatey, and too sugary.  Hindsight, would have used fudge icing.

This cake is awesome!! I followed the directions to a tee except i didn't grease and flour my pans. I made wax paper rounds sprayed them with pam, and poured batter. They popped right out! I also added 2tsp cinnamon to the batter and added 2tsp cinnamon to the icing as well. It was fab! 

I thought this would be great for our mexican pot luck and it was!

This is very good--easy to make, moist, and tasty.  Like many other reviewers, however, I'm still looking for a drop-dead chocolate cake/frosting recipe.  The best dessert I ever had was a chocolate cake from a now-defunct Key West restaurant called Jordan's.  I think they got their cake from a local bakery, but I don't know where.  Now THAT was an unbelievably good chocolate cake.  I don't suppose anyone knows the recipe or the bakery?  I'd love to try to make it.

I baked this for my older sister's 18th birthday and it stuck to the pan even if I already greased it. So I had to cut it in half! LOL But I was able to cover it up with HUGE dabs of white icing. The taste was still delicious!

In reading the reviews of this recipe, I noted that the few dissenters said it was too spongy. I would have to agree. The consistency was similar to a boxed cake mix. The frosting has a nice flavor but by the next day, it had become crumbly and dry. I never thought it possible, but I found the whole thing to be too sweet and chocolatey. Will try another recipe for chocolate cake next time.

This is the best from scratch chocolate cake recipe I have found.  It is  very moist and chocolatey.  I made these into cupcakes, which can have the tendancy to dry out, but these remained moist days later.  I am already craving this recipe again!

This has been my family's go-to cake for many years, and it never fails! I have to tell you all that one time I realized I had no regular milk and I panicked (not checking was my first mistake, baking it at 10pm when stores were closed was the second!) for a bit. I did have unsweetened almond milk though, and figured why not? So I used it and guess what? It baked up fine and I told no one what I subbed. Well let me tell you, that cake was declared the absolute moistest, most delicious one ever :) So from then on, I have just used it instead of milk and haven't looked back! I still use reg. milk for icing though. Just wanted to share!

For those who like a bittersweet tasting icing this recipe is GREAT. For the kids I added 1/4 cup less cocoa and a little more butter and about 1/2 cup more icing. they loved it! Cake is just like Devils food cake. I also jared the dry mix with instructions and gave it as a gift! Travels well!!!!

In reply to the review on 2/14 that said that the cake came out like a fudge consistency...you may want to try this recipe with brand new, unopened boxes of baking soda and baking powder.  Those are the two leavening agents in the recipe that would give the cake "lightness".

This cake was amazing! Incredibly chocolatey and moist cake with an awesome fudge frosting.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and made sure to grease and flour my pans thoroughly and I had no problem getting the cake out of the pan. I frosted the cake while it was still warm and it was a little gooey at first, but it just got better the next day and is still good almost a week later!

Very simple and solid. Also I don't follow instructions well and like to wing it.. I found this recipe to be forgiving.  Also I added a bit more cocoa powder and squirted actual hershey's syrup in the cake batter. Additionally I did a 2 layer and just poured hershey syrup between 2 thin layers.. I also made extra icing and made it intentionally a little softer. It had a great sheen to it and I poured it over intentionally so the sides had big mounds of frosting dripping over. I had planned that the icing would harden slightly and it worked perfectly.  Further more - the finishing touch I took a hershey syrup bottle and in script wrote in the name of who I did it for and a quick flower outline. I did it after the frosting harded a bit BUT before it was too hard.. the syrup just sunk in a little bit and looked awesome. Plus it added enough chocolate boost. I plan on adding cream cheese to the base to make it denser but less  caky next time I make it. But not a single complaint on my end except I thought to myself. hmm.. just a wee bit too much like a box cake.. better flavor but I'll kick it up a notch

I absolutely love this chocolate cake. It's super moist and will get rave reviews everytime you make it. I love it with my vanilla buttercream since I'm not really a chocolate frosting lover. I've made it the last 3 years for birthdays and everyone thinks it is my secret chocolate cake. Try it!! You'll love it!!!

I thought that overall, this cake was good, but the icing was kind of lousy. I wouldn't worry if the batter is very thin after you add the boiling water, because the cake will come out nice and fluffy. I give it 4 stars.

This is an excellent chocolate cake that seemed to me to be better the next day.  It's easy to make, and well worth the effort over boxed cake.  The batter disconcerted me a bit since it is very liquid, but it bakes up fine.  My only complaint is that the outstanding reviews led me to expect that it would be a to die for cake, the best I ever tasted in my life, and I wouldn't go that far. But I will definitely continue to use this excellent recipe.

As a student who loves to bake this has become THE chocolate cake recipe I use.  Takes no time, all the ingredients are on hand, and satisfies the chocolate cravings!  Great as birthday cake, muffins, or as payment for rides into the city (I have one friend who BEGS for this cake).  I change nothing and it is fabulous every time.

This was the best chocolate cake I have ever made or tasted, and I've tasted a lot.  I made it for my husband's birthday and he couldn't stop raving about it.  At first when I added the boiling water to the recipe, I thought it was odd, but it made it so moist and delicious, I will definitely be putting this in the "most loved" recipes of our family.

This tasted amazing and turned out perfect. Its literally full proof as this is my first cake ever and i know nothing about cooking. Super easy and delicious- it is sure to impress. And for all those people who clmplained about the icing, you must have done something wrong because mine turned out  perfect.

I have made this cake for many years. It has NEVER failed me (first time I saw the recipe it was in a magazine). I was nervous when I saw how thin the batter was the first time, but it always comes out perfect.  Chocolaty and moist and sooooo yummy. I have always frosted it with the frosting recipe it came with, my 4 sons all love this cake. I cannot imagine ever using another chocolate cake recipe.  It makes a beautiful double layer cake and so simple as sheet cake.

Oh My GAWD - this is the most awesome chocolate cake I have ever had.  After adding the water to the batter I was thinking "oh my - that's awfully thin" but it was "to die for good"
Thanks

Yummm!! I followed the recipe for the cake just as it was written, (imagine that.) I was a little worried about the center at first... it looked as if it was going to fall in...but it turned out fine. We all LOVED the taste...and it was very moist. I used a different frosting recipe. :D I will be making again.

I love this cake. My family requests that i make it for a lot of our psecial occasions. The only thing I change is to use only 1 cup of the water and 1 cup of instant coffee. It really brings out the chocolatey flavor.
