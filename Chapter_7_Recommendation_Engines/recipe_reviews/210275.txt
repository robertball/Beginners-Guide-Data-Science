I've made this with Sugar-Free Raspberry Preserves and it came out great. Good warm or cold.

I used orange marmalade and vanilla extract, instead of almond.  They were delicious.

I love this!!! I used Strawberry instead of Apricot because that's what I had on hand and I used mini muffin tin also. 
A great simple muffin.

I made this with homemade strawberry rhubarb jam. The taste was okay, and it smelled delicious but I found that the muffins were so thick I was full before I could finish one.

Ugh!  I doubled the recipe because of all the great reviews & followed it EXACTLY.  When I checked on the muffins after 15 minutes they were almost burnt.  They did not taste of apricots at all, but they did have a weird after taste.  Bummer because i really wanted to love these!

OMG these are amazing!!! I didn't have apricot preserves, so I used sugar free orange marmalade. I used half all purpose white flour, and half Atkins Baking Mix, and I used vanilla in place of almond extract. They are soooo good, moist, tasty, I can't wait to make them again. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

incredible. fluffy and moist. i made this with strawberry jam because i was out of apricot, but i will be heading to the store to get the apricot. subbed vanilla for the almond extract, as i was out of almond, so i'll have to buy that too. thank god it only makes 6, or i'd have eaten them all day.

These muffins were just too bland for my taste.  I made the mini version so maybe the large ones would be better.
