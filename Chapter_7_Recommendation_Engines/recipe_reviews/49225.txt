This was absolutely amazing! Everything about this recipe was awesome, from preparation to eating the leftovers the next day! This is definitely easy to prepare, and was fun to make with the kids. The aroma throughout the house was spell bounding and the taste is wonderful. For me it bought back memories of when I was visiting my family in Corfu and is the perfect comfort food. I added the extra clams, not because of just what the other reviewers suggested, but because I love clams as well. I also sprinkled a little feta cheese on top and man oh man, everyones plates were clean. I HIGHLY suggest this recipe and will be making it over and over again.

This was FABULOUS!!!!!!  I do love clams so I may be a bit biased.  I used garlic peeled tomatoes and doubled the amount of garlic called for and also doubled the amount of clams (minus the juice on the doubling portions).  The flavours in this sauce were wonderful!!!!  I would rate this in my top 5 pasta dishes ever.  I rate this a 10 star recipe and my husband rated it a 4.5 star recipe.  We would both want this again on our regular rotation.  I served this with a salad and some garlic bread.  I also served the dish over spaghetti with feta cheese.  When I make this dish again (which I definitely will!) I will use all fresh tomatoes in place of the canned.  I think with all the spices in this dish...the fresh tomatoes would be an amazing enhancement.  This was a GREAT one!!  A MUST try...especially if you love garlic and clams like we do!!!  Thank you!!!!!!

It's funny...when it's been awhile since I've found a 5-star recipe, I start to get antsy and try to give 5 stars to 3- or 4-star recipes.  It takes a recipe like this to bring me back down to earth and remind me that there IS such a thing as a TRUE 5-STAR RECIPE!!  This dish is absolutely AWESOME.  I would totally go to a restaurant JUST to eat this meal.  It's super easy to make, it looks pretty, and HOLY CRUD does it taste GOOD.  The only change I made was to double the clams (extra clams were drained).  I served it over whole wheat pasta and topped with feta, as suggested by the recipe submitter.  Thanks so much to Jennifer AND her mother-in-law for this perfect recipe.  :-)  UPDATE:  I made this again tonight with what I had on hand.  I was not able to add the extra clams or top with feta.  Man, what a DIFFERENCE!!  Tonight's version was on the "good" side of "Ok."  From now on, I will ALWAYS make sure to double the clams and top with feta!!

Really Really good.  I added an extra can of clams (drained) and used diced tamatoes with spices already in them.  Served over angel hair pasta with feta sprinkled on top. Everyone really liked this.  We are fighting over who gets the leftovers.

Now our favourite family pasta. It works best by being generous with the olive oil and slow cooking in creuset type covered pot.

This recipe is delicious. I've been eyeing it up for a while and finally gave it a whirl. I've never tried clams and had bought a can out of curiosity. I halved the recipe as there are only the two of us, and had to leave out the celery because I didn't have any. I used small diced canned tomatoes that were already flavoured with garlic and olive oil for an extra little hit of garlic. Instead of salt, I added a smidge of sugar which I love in tomato sauces, served over pasta shells which seemed appropriate, and topped with feta which I grated instead of crumbling. Thanks for the great recipe!

I must admit that I was a little "iffy" at the thought of using CANNED clams....I'm not much of a canned items user but this was FANTASTIC.....delicate flavor....nice texture.....healthy....inexpensive.....tastes like a restaurant meal! 

I like the fact that the ingredients in this recipe uses most of the staples regularly in my pantry anyway (save the clams which just may become a part of my pantry after this recipe).

I mostly followed the directions as is except that I read thru all the reviews and then added what most people recommended.....double the clams. 

Next time I will add 2 more garlic cloves (I'm one of those people who can never have enough garlic), add a little more red pepper flake, and perhaps some chopped bell pepper.

Delicious - I added some real clams too for impact and served over Angel Hair Pasta, perfect sauce and spice blend, and the FEta made the real difference. Will definately make again.

I thought this was EXCELLENT considering how easy it was.  Very few dishes that use canned ingredients will have such a lovely flavor.  I used two 6.5 oz cans of chopped clams (undrained) and two 6.5 oz cans of chopped clams (drained).  I only used chopped because I already had these on hand.  I don't think this hurt the dish but I will try whole clams next time.  I also used 6 cloves of garlic instead of four.  As suggested, I topped each plate with feta and served over angel hair pasta.  The feta is a MUST.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was excellent. I added an extra can of clams, with juice, an extra can of tomato paste, for a richer tomato flavor. And definantly top with feta. Great flavor! I hate when I stuff myself wich I usually don't, but this was so good.

This is a lot like the base recipe I use when I make my own sauce.  I think next time I'll use a 28oz can of whole tomatoes instead.  I like the sauce consistancy you get with the whole.  The diced I used had really big pieces of tomatoe that never really broke down and my family likes a smoother sauce.  I also used 3 cans of clams, but I bought chopped instead of baby.  It was fine, but I think next time I will use 4 or more cans.  The volumne of tomatoes vs clams was a little off.  Nice flavor and easy to make.  Thanks for sharing.  Oh, I thought the oregano amount was a little on the high side so I cut that in half.  I'm not a beg fan of the herb.

Similar to Manhatten Clam Chowder but thicker.  I made this for my little brother and his "Muddin' Redneck Buddies."  I paired this with a Tuscan dipping sauce and a good crusty french bread that ripped apart. They all looked at me like I'd plopped them into a 5-star restaurant!  They were cautious on the first bite - but before long I realized that not an ounce was left over!  I really didn't divert from the recipe except by adding some additional italian herbs and hot sauce!
PS.  Now they are always asking my little brother when I'm cooking for them again!

Delicious, though I had to change some ingredient amounts due to how little or how much I had on hand. Even when using less garlic (only 2 cloves) and plenty of oregano, red pepper, and crushed  bay leaves, this recipe was still great. Unluckily (surprising too, when compared to the picture next to the recipe), there wasn't enough volume to the sauce to really cover the pasta. It turned out looking kind of like seafood style spaghetti and meatballs. Still, the aroma and taste were wonderful. The advice to top with feta cheese really helped to make the meal!

This will be my go-to recipe for clams and pasta from now on.  The sauce has great flavor and will the extra clams recommended by other reviewers, this makes a really hearty meal.

I didn't find this sauce tasty enough, kind of bland, maybe I'm to used to my wife's family Italian cooking. Sauce was very weak in taste, Will not try again to many other sauce recipes here to try

This was absolutely the best clam/pasta recipes ever!!! Even my "picky-eater" nephew loved it!  I made it per recipe the first time, only adding mushrooms, and had NO leftovers!  Ive made it several times now.. adding garden vegetable ( yellow squash, zucchini, onions, carrots) whatever I had on hand and you simply cant ruin it!! what a great way to get veggies in the kids without hem knowing!! I saute and cook the veggies well and slightly mash them at the end, but it tastes delishh!!!   its my new go-to recipe.

Great! I used mushrooms, eggplant and zucchini instead of the celery and was generous with the spices, but all was very tasty.

Even better the second night. Agree with doubling the clams.
