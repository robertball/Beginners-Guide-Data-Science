I was intrigued by the milk and the idea of a homemade creamy soup. I liked this recipe although I did modify it just a bit to suit our tastes. I had remnants of a rotisserie chicken so I made my broth with that and used what chicken was on it. Only used 1 potato b/c Honey doesn't eat them but my teens do. I didn't have evaporated milk on hand but I always have dry milk powder so I added 1/2 C of that instead. Also my pickies usually pick out carrots so cooked them in chunks making the broth and then buzzed them in the blender and then poured them back into the pan. Sneaky huh? I will probably make this again. Thanks for your recipe.

This tasty soup reminds me of my Mother-in-Law's potato soup. My husband has fond memories of her potato soup. I have made this soup twice. The first time I used my food processor and chopped up the carrots onions and celery. The second time I made the soup I made the soup according to the recipe. Both ways made for a good soup. It needs some salt and perhaps some fresh chopped parsley.

I made this with left over turkey and home made turkey broth. Was good! Then why the 3 stars? One thing I disliked and would not add again was the milk. Did not care for that part.

I have a picky eater in the house so I was very cautious in choosing a simple but flavorful soup. I changed a few things around so here's what I did differently: 4 stalks celery 6 carrots 2-32oz boxes of broth (low sodium) no potatoes instead of the spices listed I used 1tsp McCormick's Gourmet herbs de Provence 4 cups chicken and added about 1/4 cup chopped parsley and 4 cloves fresh chopped garlic. I boiled chicken in broth and sauteed veggies in a deep sauce pan. I added a few cups of broth to veggies and let them simmer before adding to broth. I used 1 cup of the milk but I think next time I will use a little more. I never used it so I used the bare minimum. I cooked my noodles by themselves and added them to the individual servings instead of dumping them in the soup. It had a good amount of flavor and we both enjoyed it which is pretty rare in my house. This is my new go chicken soup recipe!

very good. I added 2 cans of Cream of chicken to make it thicker. an easy way to do shredded chicken that tastes better than boiling- chicken breasts in the crock pot with chicken broth on low all day- easy to shred. I used canned potatoes and carrots which sped it up a little. left out the milk. I may have to add some when reheating.

Delicious! I used Mrs. Dash salt-free for flavor and I also added a square of chicken bouillon and a bit more salt to it. I added 1 more of each vegetable. Will make it again big success!

I doubled the herbs and also added about a half teaspoon of pepper and just a touch of salt. This made it very tasty. I used organic chicken stock instead of broth. I added a bit more stock (about a cup more) than the recipe called for. I also added more celery and carrots than called for. I found that this soup is good as a brothy soup (no milk added) or as a creamy soup (milk added). My kids loved this soup so I will definitely make it again.

This is a keeper for us. Only things I did differently was to omit the onion (my husband is allergic) so I added 3 chopped cloves if garlic to the carrots and celery while they were cooking. Also got a rotisserie chicken and shredded 2 cups from that to add. I did add a little bit of salt at the end after adding in the evaporated milk. We had no leftovers!

I was craving chicken noodle soup and this did not disappoint.  I used spaghetti noodles instead of the egg noodles (that's what I had on hand), extra broth and salt and pepper to taste.

Every time I make this I double the recipe and make it in a big Dutch oven. It has become a family favorite in our house. It is usually gone in 2-3 days if not in the same day sometimes. Everyone loves it even those who claim to hate chicken noodle soup and after they finally try it they usually can't go without having at least 2 bowls. Also I used a purple onion instead of a yellow or a Vidalia and it seemed to add a bit more sweetness. However I didn't add the potatoes because I thought it would seem to much like potato soup with the heavy cream (I love cooking with heavy cream so that was my first choice over the evaporated milk) in it. After I put the last of the ingredients in the pot to simmer I close the lid and leave it for about 30 minutes instead of the 7-10 minutes it calls for that way the noodles get nice and plump and it all just melts in your mouth.

very good! I was a little unsure about adding the milk. I used heavy cream instead of evaporated milk. One I added the cream I really thought I had ruined the recipe but after letting it simmer for another 5 minutes it turned out fabulous! A big hit in our household!

I made my own chicken broth in the IP which added to the exceptional flavor of this soup. I think if you use canned or carton broth you will need to add some additional spices to give it the deep rich flavor that a comforting soup like this should have. It was a hit in my home.

This was so good!! The only things I changed was, omitted the potatoes (cutting back on starch) and added lemon pepper. Other than that, followed the recipe. The soup is definitely a keeper, It is flavorful and creamy but not thick, perfect!!

I made this recently when my husband son and I were all sick and on antibiotics. We hadn't been eating much and I thought we needed something comforting and nourishing. This soup perfectly fit the bill. My only changes: I did not put in potatoes because I thought potatoes and noodles were too much. I used the heavy cream alternative to the condensed milk and I added peas.My husband put salt and pepper in his serving but for me the thyme and poultry seasoning called for were just right. There does seem to be a typo in the recipe which called for "1/4 pinch of thyme." I just assumed it meant 1/4 teaspoon. This isn't the first time I've come across errors in the recipes on this site; I wish the proofreading was better.

I was looking for a recipe to use up chicken broth that was just past it's best used by date and thought this recipe sounded good. It was really good! I added a little extra poultry seasoning and some extra broth.

This recipe was a huge success. It was extremely easy to make and extremely flavorful. I did add extra chicken as my crew likes more meat/ heartiness in soups. I would definitely make this again.
