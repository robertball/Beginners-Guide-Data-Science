My family loved it! I'll be making this again.  Followed advice and just stirred pasta and ingredients together and threw into baking dish.

Made half the portion and baked in 8x8 casserole dish. 
Used 1 whole green pepper, also added onion and extra garlic 
Used spicy ranch dressing packet and added a bit of cayenne pepper to the veggies while they were cooking to add some spice. when veggies were just about done I added 1/2 bag of fresh baby spinach and cooked for another 1-2 minutes. Layered in baking dish as suggested--used mozzarella and cheddar cheese blend. Turned out delicious! Next time I might add a bit more veggies and cut back a bit on the pasta for a healthier  option

I made this last  night. This is a great Alfredo pasta recipe. Very rich in flavor. The prep/cook time for me was a bit long & my kitchen a disaster but that is my not very organized cooking style. I don't like green peppers so substituted frozen peas. Next time I will try mushroom. Other than that minor substitution I did the recipe "as is" for ingrediants. As others recommended I mixed all ingredients together & only layering the cheese. I am giving this a 4 star based on recipe as written.

Great recipe.  I did double the green peppers and added some summer squash and onion.  Next time, I will reduce the amount of pasta.  Everyone loved it.  I would make it over and over and I think it is well suited to adding a variety of veggies.  Flavor is great.

My meat and potato husband loved it . It was a bit rich for me, it is one of those rich flavors that grows on you.... I added a can of mushrooms and some olives, forgot the milk but it turns out I didn't need it .

This was rich and delicious. I made a huge amount in a large aluminum baking pan. I doubled the mozzarella and added more milk than it called for to the Alfredo, plus garlic and parmesan.  It made 16 portions, 8 in the freezer for another time.

A family friendly recipe, creamy and full of cheese. My mom loved it, husband liked it, and I liked it but felt it was a little bland. I will use this recipe again with a few changes , 1st I think half the box of penne would be enough for 3 people , as well as a 1/2 lb of meat per person.  Then follow  the rest of the recipe as written.

Best casserole ever if you like Alfredo pasta. This is like Alfredo but 1000X better. My family asked for it again the next day.

I made this for my parents and we all loved it! Some changes I made: I didn't bake the chicken in the oven. I cooked it up in a pan. It was quicker and worked just fine! I used onions instead of bell pepper. I also mixed everything together instead of layering. Although making it was kind of hectic because so many things were going on at once, we all appreciated the final result. Will make it again!

I had to make only half the recipe, as there are only 2 of us, and we didn't need 12 servings. I added 1 small onion, diced, to the chicken mixture, and I omitted the garlic, as my Alfredo sauce had garlic in it. Also, I used leftover rotisserie chicken breasts. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. The half-recipe that I made still filled a 9 x 13 casserole dish. I'm curious as to what size pan I would need if I made the the original sized recipe, like for a church potluck? We liked the casserole, but I thought it was bland. If I make it again, I'll try to come up with something to jazz it up a little!

I used a rotisserie chicken instead but followed all other directions. I completed most of the steps simultaneously and that cut the prep time to about 30 minutes. It turned out delicious!  I will probably use a little less cheese next time but my family was happy with this!

Hit with the kids and the adults only thing I did different is I used to left over bbq chicken and not the ranch packet and drained about 90% of the bacon grease. Very delicious recipe!

I've made it multiple times now. I cheated (a lot) the first couple of times and used already cooked chicken and bacon bits (not the obviously fake bacon junk). If you cheat, go easy on the ranch seasoning.

Also made it as the recipe states and, although the other way is easier, dangit, the non-cheat version was far better.

I made this again. I tried mixing it all together like others suggested. That worked well.  It cut out lots of steps.  I still wanted it to be creamy. I added 3 jars of Alfredo sauce and it still was not enough for me. Good flavor!!  Maybe if I cut down on the amount of pasta it will be more creamy.

This one is pretty good.  I thought it was heavy on the pasta, but I picked about half of it out of mine and no one else complained, so maybe it was just me.

Delicious! Although I thought layering was too much work. I cut the recipe in half and mixed everything but the cheese and bacon together in a skillet. Poured it into an 11"x7". Then topped it with the cheese, then the bacon.

This was an excellent meal, and my family thoroughly enjoyed it! I used canned chicken, and sliced mozzarella, as that's what I had on hand, and it was still amazing!! This was a hit with the whole family, and that almost never happens! Thank you!!

I drained some of the bacon grease and would probably drain more. Otherwise it tasted good
