This is fabulous!  It was super easy and tasted delicious.  Don't leave out the red pepper, it made the dish.

Delish!! I'm a meat eater and my husband is a vegetarian, but doesn't like a lot of veggies (go figure) so I'm always trying to find new recipes and this one is defintely a keeper. Nice flavor and very very easy and quick, was done in exactly 30 min from start to finish and that was in the middle of me making cookies too! The only thing I changed was is the amt of onions, and I love onions, but the medium onion after I chopped it out seemed like a lot so I would say maybe a small onion. I also did 1/2 tsp pepper vs the 1/4 to add a little zing. But again I LOVED IT!!!

Sorry, we did not like this at all.  Maybe it was the jarred sauce.

This was very delicious. After finishing seconds, my husband asked me to please make it again soon. I chopped the veggies very small in my food processor to make it more appealing to my kids.

Simply delicious!  Made this recipe with the asparagus and used Ragu's alfredo sauce.  My husband said how much he enjoyed it, and I did too.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very easy to make. Was good, but needed more flavor, Hubby said next time to add more spices, so that's what we'll be doing. Going to add cut up chicken as well. You might also want to double the sauce if you're like our family and like your pasta smothered, because this definitely was not enough.

yummy. I used broccoli and a green bell pepper and generic alfredo sauce. I also used  wide egg noodles because I had them leftover from the day before. I also added some paramasan cheese at the end. We all loved it. My husband and I also added a little crushed red pepper to some of ours for a little spice but it was yummy without it too. Will make again for sure.
