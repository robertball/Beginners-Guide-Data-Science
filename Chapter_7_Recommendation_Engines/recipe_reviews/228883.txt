What a beautiful and delicious roll! As much as they sound time consuming, these rolls were fast, easy and addicting.  The dough was easy to work with, which is always a plus. I may have added a little more filling than it called for, but otherwise I kept everything the same.  A definite keeper!

I have found my Christmas morning rolls! These are delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfect. I got 16 sweet caramelized onion (canned by DH), bacon and cheese rolls. Each ingredient you can taste distinctly. And, goodness you can eat with one hand. These would be great for breakfast. I served with Chicken noodle soup from this site. I am just learning to make breads and rolls using yeast and this recipe turned out fabulous in taste and texture. I will be making these for many meals. I also think it would be easy to tweak. How about cranberries, swiss cheese and toasted or candied walnuts? Yeah, think I'll try that.

Went a little different with this idea. I didn't have Port so I subbed Marsala. Added a good pinch of Italian seasoning with the onions. Intended to use 6 cheese Italian blend but rolled and cut and realized I forgot the cheese  (sitting right in front of me) so sprinkled some on top instead.

These were absolutely great.  I made some changes (I always do, can't help it).  I added some shallots with the onions, then about half way through caramelizing I added some minced fresh rosemary.  I also used more of everything (bacon, cheese, onions) and added some fresh chopped chives for colour and flavour. I didn't have any wine, so I just skipped it...the onions are sweet and I don't think I missed much by leaving it out.  I would emphasize that the onions need at least 20 minutes over medium heat to be perfect...rushing will ruin them. I didn't have smoked cheese, so I used aged cheddar instead.  Flavour and texture was perfect.  The only minor criticism I can think of is that 3T of butter for brushing left me with at least 1T left wasted.   Oh, and I also cut them a bit too large and came out with 8 rolls....but they were cooked at 22 minutes...any smaller and I think they would have been over-done at that time.  Make sure the muffin tin is really well greased...I think I will try just baking them on a tray next time.  Thanks for the recipe, I will be making these again!

These were amazing! The dough was actually very easy to work with- I found I needed to add a few more pinches of flour to keep my hands from sticking so keep your flour stash nearby. At the recommendation of another cook, I did not have port wine so I substituted 1/4 cup red wine vinegar and a tablespoon of sugar to make mock wine. It turned out perfectly.  If you have any leftover dough from the ends, shape it into tiny loaves and bake them along side the rolls. They turn into wonderful mini loaves of bread for sandwiches!

These are not rolls you want to make when pressed for time, but they are so totally worth any time it takes!  I didn't use the smoked Cheddar cheese, but I will next time---the sharp Cheddar is good, but the smoked would be best!  Port wine, a fortified and thus storable wine, is perfect for these rolls.  I added a tablespoon of flour to my dough but could easily have used one more (it always depends on the atmosphere as to how much flour is needed).  The process of making these is just like making cinnamon rolls.  I would urge you when rolling out the dough to stretch the ball of dough to the length you want it and then roll it out on a well-floured surface from there.  It's hard to start it from a ball and hope to get it into a rectangle because it wants to keep finding its own shape!  I like to leave the rolls just slightly at the golden brown stage so that when I go to heat them in a hot oven without a cover they will brown just a tad more.  My house smelled so wonderful from baking these!  And it was the perfect complement to a ham and bean soup!  Oh, yum!

I used my bread machine and made a basic dinner roll dough then followed steps exactly as listed.  A+ and then some! Not complicated at all and they turned out beautifully! Thanks for a great recipe!

I forgot to add in the cheese before rolling these up, but I did top with a little cheese and these were really good as is.   Next time I make these, the cheese will add even more.   I added in garlic to my onions and smoked paprika to the flour mixture, because I didn't have smoked cheddar.   I was looking for a roll to go with grilled type food and these are the perfect fit.   Thanks!

These were ok, nothing special. Usually everyone eats all of my rolls, but I had leftovers with this recipe.

These rolls are a huge hit with my family.  I make the dough in my bread machine as a time saver and for dough consistancy.  The first time I tried the recipe, I used all purpose flour per the directions.  I don't recommend using all purpose flour if you are going to use a bread machine. :)  I now use 2 1/2 cups of bread flour when making the dough.  Works great.  I use rice wine vinegar and 1 TBS sugar instead of port when carmelizing the onions per another reviewer's suggestion.  I end up with 15 nice sized rolls that are baked like cinnamon rolls on a cookie sheet.

Oh yeah these are fabulous! Definitely holiday worthy. I was a bit nervous about the port wine since I've never had it but it was wonderful. I didn't cook then in a muffin tin, I just used a 9x13 pan. The dough was easy to work with. The kids weren't very thrilled with these but us adults loved them. They reheated well the next day too. Yummy!

Something went wrong here. The flavor was not bad, they definitely have potential. But I didn't put them in muffin cups, and I think that was part of the problem. I put them on cookie sheets, and I could watch them get flatter and flatter, rising more sideways than up. We ended up with something we referred to as "flatbread".  I also didn't have onions, so I skipped those, I don't know if that had to do with it too.
I'm not sure if I'll try again. Maybe.

My family adored these rolls!  I made them to go with a loaded baked potato soup recipe my mother's had for years and these rolls were the perfect complement.  Will definitely be making again!

WOW are these indulgent!  This was my first time making a 'rolled' yeast roll, and they turned out great.  I think my roll before I cut the slices was a bit too long, so I would recommend making your dough rectangle on the conservative side so your rolls won't seem too big for the muffin tin once it's filled.  But boy, these were GOOD!  My husband ate 2 and I served them with vegetarian soup since these have lots of cheesy bacon goodness.  I'd love to make them again if I have the time.  THANKS for a wonderful recipe!

I was short on flour (only had 2 cups) but my knowledge of bread making pulled me through. My family liked them, although we all agreed they needed "something." That turned out to be a dipping sauce. We loved Sweet Baby Ray's Barbecue Sauce.

Absolutely fabulous.  Great and easy recipe. I forgot the cheese but I didn't miss it. I added a but of garlic and oregano.  Definitely  will make this again.
