I am giving this a five for it being a good recipe. It is a SUPER MOIST cookie and should not at all be put in an airtight container. If you cook it to golden brown it will ruin the flavor. It must be cooked just before browning. I had to play with my cook time and temp a bit cause if it isn't cooked enough they are a little soggy and if it is cooked too much the flavor goes away. I ended up cooking mine at 325 for 15 min. I chilled the dough and rolled them into balls. Then I covered the balls with wax paper and squished them down with a measuring cup. I put the frosting and choc. sprinkles on top. When you let them sit out the do firm up more and are great. I would like to try the icing from Cinabon on top!

Turned out fantastic!!  Very tasty!!  I used 1 tsp of the "Pumpkin Pie Spice II" instead of cinnamon.  (I didn't have cloves so I used allspice inplace of that) And I put the dough in the freezer about5-10 minutes before I made them  into balls (and between bathces) and they balled up fine.  I also flattened them just a bit with a measuring cup immediately after I took them out of the oven and they were perfect!  Cooked on 350 for 12 minutes.  Mmm...mmm...mmm...
good, will make again!  

I actually prefer these over the pumpkin roll.  Easier to make and just as tasty....

For whatever reason, I can never just do a recipe verbatim, and this was no exception. SO, I can't compare what I did to the original recipe, but everyone who tried my version LOVED them (including a "real" chef). ... Here are the changes I made (everything else stayed the same as the original recipe): - 1 cup of unsalted butter (instead of butter flavored shortening), - 1/2 cup white sugar  +  1/2 cup brown sugar, - 15 ounce can of pumpkin, - 2.75 cups whole wheat flour, - 1/2 bag of cinnamon chips. ... Rather than using premade frosting, I used this recipe ( http://allrecipes.com//Recipe/Creamy-Cream-Cheese-Frosting/ ) and then topped them with some gold-pearl rock sugar (for presentation mostly, but it added a nice extra touch of sweetness).

This is an amazing cookie.This lasted all of 1 hour at Thanksgiving today. These cookies must be stored in a tin container so they don't sog. They were soft and had a wonderful pumpkin flavor. I did not use cream cheese frosting. Instead I used the cream cheese filling from a  pumpkin roll recipe and added cinnamon. I used that for frosting.(You can find the filling in all recipes granny kats pumpkin roll) When this recipe is done correctly the finish product is outstanding. My family is very big on baking and this cookie is the best pumpkin cookie yet. The trick to this cookie is not to over cook. The batter is impossible to roll into a ball as suggested, just drop by the teaspoon. Enjoy !!!! Marisol

I found the dough very difficult to work with; it was almost impossible to roll the cookies into a ball.  The finished product had a nice cake like consistency, but the flavor was very bland.  I had to tell everyone they were pumpkin flavored since they could not tell by the taste.  I made them the night before Thanksgiving and they became very soggy overnight.

These cookies were very moist. I shared them with friends and everyone was asking for the recipe. I added chocolate chips and skipped the frosting. My dough was very sticky so the cookie was rather lumpy, not ideal for frosting.

These cookies were moist and delicious.  I took them to a potluck and was asked for the recipe by several people.  Though some people thought the dough was hard to work with, I didn't bother rolling them into balls.  I used a small cookie dough scooper and scooped 1" balls onto the greased cookie sheets.  They came out perfectly!

WOW! excellent cookie. I made a couple of changes thow. I used 1/2 of a 40oz can of sweet potatos (as the pumpkin) I drained them and pureed them in a food chopper. I have been looking for a sweet potato cookie and these worked out great. . Half of the batch I used milk chocolate chips in them. Also instead of shortening I used margarine. My picky son who doesn't eat sweet potatos just loved these, he thinks there a pumpkin cookie. This is a keeper. Thanks Michelle :) :)

These cookies didn't really have a very strong pumpkin flavor to them, but they were still very good.  I found that it was much easier to roll the dough into balls after it had sat out for 20 minutes or so.  Also I had to squash the dough balls because they didn't flatten and melt during cooking.  Th cream cheese frosting is very dilicious on these cookies.  I would definetely recommend using it.

These were a huge hit with my kids. I thought they were pretty yummy, too. As far as the dough being hard to handle:  I found that chilling the dough made it easier to roll them into balls.

This recipe has become my family's FAVORITE cookies in the world - and has all of my friends begging for the cookies and/or the recipe all the time.  Whenever I take them somewhere, they get instantly devoured.  I like more spice to mine, so I add a tsp of Pumpkin Pie spice, and sometimes a little more allspice/ginger/nutmeg/cloves as I feel like.  Simply the best cookies in the WORLD.  Make these - lots of them - and don't share the recipe with your friends!  You'll be the talk of the town.

These are spectacular!!!  Super moist and cakey.  I just added a pinch each of nutmeg and ground cloves.  I also made homemade cream cheese frosting as cookies these good deserve better than store bought canned frosting!

This recipe is awesome. As long as you don't overcook them the recipe is perfect the way it is. Make a double batch because you won't want to share the first one...

I made these for my co-workers and they turned out amazing! They are very soft. I found the dough tough to work with but I used a tablespoon to scoop it out and mold ( a cookie scoop would work too). Instead of using cream cheese frosting I used a vanilla glaze I found in the cooking aisle. By far the best pumpkin cookie recipe I have found!

New favorite holiday cookie!!! The name says pumpkin, but I say they taste like carrot cake! One suggestion. The dough needs refrigerated several hours or even overnight.  Then roll into a ball, place on cookie sheet, and flatten with a spatula to 1/4" thickness. You will end up with a picture perfect cookie that everyone will love!

These cookies were super moist so I didn't put them in an air tight container. They dried out by the 4th or 5th day, but there were only a few left so it didn't matter. Everyone loved them!!

These were incredible! They are so moist, so yummy.  I didn't frost them, but added butterscotch chips to the recipe and it was just enough sweet.  I also had to bake them about 4 minutes longer, but I probably made bigger cookies too.  Thanks for sharing!

1 more thing.  The dough is very moist, but it does not need to be rolled into perfect balls to bake well, a simple spoonful on the pan does just fine.  Flatten them with a spatula about 5 minues before they're done, and bake them for closer to 20 minutes.

I usually hesitate to make anything with shortening, but this cookie recipe is wonderful.  The cookies are more like little cakes, but maintain their shape well.  They are time consuming, but every year this are requested for our family get-togethers.  They are excellent.

Great recipe...cookies had wonderful texture and flavor. Only thing I changed was to add 1 1/2 tspns of cinnamon AND 1 tspn of pumpkin pie spice. Also made homemade cream cheese frosting and ended up baking for a little over 15 minutes.

I added a 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp allspice and used 1/2 tsp cinnamon instead of 1 tsp.  I also pressed the after rolling into ball cause they did not spread. I omited the salt and set my oven at 325 and baked for 15 min

These taste so good!  Definitely a drop cookie.  They are VERY moist.  Make sure to bake them all the way.  My first batch was not done in the center.  Don't put them in an airtight container, just on a plate.  My kids liked the frosting, but I left a few of them plain because they're great that way too!

These were awesome, super super soft and moist. The pumpkin wasn't overwhelming or anything, it gave it nice moisture and fantastic falltime flavor. Cream cheese frosting is a nice addition, but if you are cheap and don't want to buy it, or lazy and don't want to make your own and frost them, these cookies can totally stand by themselves.

Moist and yummy!  I used canned cream cheese frosting as suggested, but I think I'll make my own next time.  
I found my dough impossible to roll into balls--it was too sticky!  So, I just did drop cookies and they were fine.  Over all a fine recipe.

These are good pumpkin cookies:  Moist, tasty.  I put a cream cheese frosting on top and they were even better.

I made these cookies tonight. The batter was SO soupy that I couldn't roll the cookies into balls as the recipe said. I ended up dropping them onto the cookie sheet by spoon. I baked two cookies before I attempted the rest of the batter. Very bland. I ended up adding more sugar, some pumpkin pie spice, and more cinnamon. I baked them for 15 minutes, flattened them with a spatula, then baked them for an additional 5 minutes. They did take the cream cheese frosting this way. As for taste..okay. I don't think I'll be baking these again, but thanks.

This recipe is one of my favorites!  I made it for the first time last weekend and had to make four more batches this weekend!  Everyone loves them, and everyone is asking where I got the recipe.  Thanks so much!

this was easy enough for the kids to help. my hands were still greasy from the pans when I formed the balls so it was pretty easy. I didn't use the frosting because pumpkin pie mix instead of plain pumpkin was subsituted (by accident) but they were great. loved by the entire family.

I was looking for a pumpkin cookie for my mother for her to take to an event at Bonanzaville USA West Fargo ND. We could not imagine to find a better recipe! We had never tried or thought there could be pumpkin cookies. Thanks to your site-we found the perfect one! I have passed this onto relatives in Seattle Wa. This recipe has travelled fast and used often!

I am a 61 yr. old woman who never really baked before. I was in on a cookie exchange for xmas.  I had never made a cookie dough from scratch.  Used this recipe and it was a a hit.  I amazed myself at how good they were.  Instead of icing I shook them up in powdered sugar.  DELICIOUS!!!!

This recipe is quite easy to make. They are quite moist so I found for best results to store them in the refridgerator. They still keep their soft texture.

Moist and delicious. I made a few changes: I used all brown sugar instead of white sugar. I more than doubled the spices, using 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice and then still added extra ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. We really like spice! I used softened butter instead of shortening. Baked for 14 minutes. My husband loves these and yes they are especially good with the cream cheese icing, I make my own mixing a little icing sugar, vanilla, and pumpkin pie spice into the cream cheese.

These cookies are wonderful.  Brought them to work this morning and they are almost gone!  I also used 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon.  Rather than canned icing, I made my own cream cheese icing with 1/2 stick butter, 3 ounces cream cheese, 1 tsp vanilla and 2 cups sifted powder sugar.  Delicious!!

I used the cream cheese frosting the first time that I baked these cookies. The second time that I baked these I used Royal Frosting. The third time that I baked these I used buttercream frosting. Overall the Royal Frosting tasted and looked the best because I decided to colour the Royal Frosting orange to match the shape of the cookies (pumpkins)!!!!

This is a great cookie. Very light pumpkin flavor which is enhanced with a cream cheese icing. Consider it a drop cookie. Impossible to roll into a ball. Was a hit at the bake sale.
