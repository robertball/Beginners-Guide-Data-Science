This is an excellent recipe from Pillsbury. This was amazingly easy and so good. We love sour cream, so we had that with it. I would just caution to watch the baking time. Cresent rolls generally don't need that long to back. My crust was golden brown after 17 minutes, so keep an eye on it after it's been in the oven for 15 minutes and use your best judgement.

Excellent! I added some beans at the bottom which was a great addition.  And it only took about 17 minutes to bake instead of 25.

My family loved this. I didn't like the bottom crust. I was worried it would be soggy so I used drained tomatoes instead of salsa. And I added a can of green chilies. I am glad I added a can of beans because it would have turned out to be a wimpy pie. The beans helped to give it some body. Some corn would be good too. This was super easy to throw together. I used reduced fat cresent rolls ground turkey

I would recommend using the crescent sheets instead of the crescent rolls so you don't have to worry about pinching seams together to form the crust. I made the recipe as stated but substituted taco sauce for the salsa (picky husband). This recipe was just ok. I would prefer to use flour tortillas or just made regular tacos because they would be faster and easier. The crescent crust didn't wow us - plus it tends to be too much on the sweet side for savory dishes. Watch it carefully once in the oven - mine got a little too brown so I think the time may vary according to your oven. I don't think I would make this one again.

This was a hit with my wife and 2 year old son. I also cut up some tortilla wraps and fried them to make homemade chips, and those were a hit as well.

This is GREAT!! Delisious and easy!! I have been making this for a while now. And I've always followed the recipe to a Tee. It's my dad's favorite.
But I thought it was a little sogy maybe because of the salsa. Therefore I tried draining a can of diced tomatoes and a can of green chilies in place of the salsa. It turned out to dry and with the tomatoes on top it was a bit over kill. I will use the salsa from now on. But I might try some corn or pinto beans! Yum!

This was delicious and easy!  Not a crumb left!  I will definitely bake this again and look for similar recipes using Pillsbury Crescents as a base!  Thanks for sharing - for once a dish came out PERFECT!

I cooked the crust for about eight minutes and kept an eye on it before adding the rest of the ingredients. Crust was perfect.

This was a great, easy recipe.  I made a few changes to it by adding onions and red peppers to the beef.  Once done, I added taco sauce instead of salsa, a package of taco seasoning and one can of refried beans.  I divided the croissant roll in half and layed both pieces in a 9 x 13 pan.  Topped it with the beef/bean mixture and then the cheese.  Served it with sour cream once out of the oven.  This was a hit.

It was very easy to make but I would not use the crescent roll dough, I may try it with pizza dough next time.... The crescent dough had a sweet taste and I really didn't care for it. I also crushed tortilla chips on top then covered with cheese

Kids loved it so that makes it a keeper. I added refried beans before the meat and covered the top with lettuce. It was a little weird putting the crescent roll doughs in the right order to cover the pie pan...so some sides were thicker than others. And i am going to try a pie crust shield next time because I think the bottom could've used at least 20 mins but the sides showing were done by 17. Served with spanish rice, sour cream and hot sauce.

Made it exactly as written, I didn't care for the sweetness in the crescent dough paired with the salty/spicy taste of the rest of the pie, BUT my hubby and daughter loved it! We topped it with tomatoes, lettuce, avocado, salsa and more sour cream.

Great starter recipe. I added some kidney beans to the bottom before meat mixture. Added a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles instead of salsa. And cut up one onion with ground turkey instead of the beef. I baked at 350 for 20 minutes and came out perfect. Thanks for the recipe.

Everyone loved this,  I added a bunch of navy beans the first time and black beans the second time.  I probably threw on more cheese too as I know my audience.  I am not a very good cook, but this certainly got rave reviews from my kids and husband.

This was great. I used Newman's brand salsa which I find not as spicy, which I like. I did bake the crescent roll first for 9 minutes, filled with the filling and then cook an additional 8-9 minutes. I highly recommend doing this so you don't get a doughy crust. If you want the cheese melted without being hard put it on a few minutes before taking out of oven otherwise it makes a hard cheese crust on top, which I liked.

The only thing I changed is  I used 2 packs of taco seasoning for my 2 lbs of beef simmered for 10 mins drained so it would not make the dough wet.  It was delicious.  We added the tomatoes and lettuce an onions when it was finished.  The family enjoyed it and it's an easy  one!

I've made this dish for my family a few times and we enjoy it. We use the crescent roll dough sheet instead of the triangles and it works well. We cut off one end and reposition it in the pie dish. I recommend cutting the dish with a pizza roller before adding the lettuce, tomatoes and green onions.

I started with salsa chicken in the crock pot.  At dinner time, I made the crescent roll pie shell then scooped the chicken and cooked as directed.  Unfortunately I let my avocado go bad so we topped with lettuce, tomatoes and black olives.  Everyone liked it but I thought the crescent rolls added a sweetness to it that I didn't care for but not enough to stop me from getting seconds.  This would be a really quick meal and a change from the norm for a weekday meal. I'll make again.  I'm sure my oldest will request it.

This recipe is very good, I however made just a few small additions. I added about 1/2 cup sour cream, shredded lettuce, grape or Cherry tomatoes(halved) & sliced black olives to the top when it comes out of the oven. Awesome!!!

None of my kids would eat it. The crescent didn't taste right with the other ingredients.  It was fun to make but looks as though it'll be a one time thing.

It turned out MAGNIFISO (mwah to her fingertips) as my 5 year old said. Unfortunately, I didn't get the piece of art in picture form. It's just an amazing memory in our heads. My husband smiled so big when he tasted it. He said this is the best thing I've ever made. Needless to say we will have this more frequent than not. I made Spanish rice with it as well. Kiss the cook!! ??
