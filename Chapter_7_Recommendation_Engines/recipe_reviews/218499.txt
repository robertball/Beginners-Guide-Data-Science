So the sauce for the chicken is great, I've made it twice and and it's turned out great both times.

However, it seems that some instructions are missing (like where does the other half of the mango go?!) Obviously minor details, but I blended it, the spices and the onion together and worked out well. 

If a blender is not available, I also made it finely chopping up everything (I got a new knife, needed to try it out), and it works just as well.

Anyways, great recipe, just use your imagination to fill it out

This was very sweet, the sauce has the consistency of an applesauce and it has pretty good flavor, I just don't know how much it's worth the work. I did it without the greens or raisins and used regular strips instead of drumsticks.

This is fantastic. ALMOST identical to my favorite Mango Chicken dish @my favorite Indian restaurant, which has cilantro in it, which I will add next time. There is a step missing about adding the other half of the mango with the 2nd sliced onion before simmering. Also, I think you can skip the step where you put the chicken in a bag with the smushed ingredients. It works fine to mix the first part of the ingredients in the pan with the melted butter, then add the chicken, unless maybe you're supposed to marinate it in the bag (?) which I don't think it needs because it tasted great without. This works with or without raisins, too.

The recipe as is needs some tweaking. I added an extra mango, and just cooked all the ingredients down in the pot instead of blending ahead of time. Sugar needs to be cut in half at least. Next time I will also try using a bit more vinegar and maybe some chicken bouillon or something. Also throw in the extra spices you dipped the chicken in while it's cooking - excellent flavor, will definitely make again.

This is the best sauce for greens I have ever tasted. And yet when I was making it I was skeptical. I couldn’t find my curry so made my own. I used thighs instead of legs. And finally, my mango wasn’t ripe so I used two small pears. Since I’m lazy I skipped the plastic bag and just sautéed spiced and then added chicken. Then I threw everything else in a food processor and just added it right before the greens and let simmer for 20 minutes or so: OUTSTANDING. The sauce is just incredible ! It was fine on the chicken but we are mainlining those greens!
