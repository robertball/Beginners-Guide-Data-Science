WOW! Am I glad I stumbled across this recipe today. Started out thinking I was going to make the same tired pork roast; then found this recipe!  Followed almost exactly; with the exception of omitting the sour cream as I was out, but adding 1/4 cup more milk.  Was plenty creamy though with the milk and cream soup.  Also used thyme as I don't care for rosemary.  And finally I chopped up fresh spinach for a healthier bite and some color!  This was a great casserole for a healthy and unique choice.  WILL CERTAINLY MAKE AGAIN!!!

I stumbled upon this recipe while searching high and low for a new dish to make for dinner for myself and my husband.  After going over the ingredient list and the directions, I decided to give it a whirl.  Guess what??  IT WAS AWESOME!!  The prep stuff and cooking process was easy as can be.  The hardest part was waiting for it to be finished so we could scarf it up!! The only thing that I will change the next time I make this (and I can guarantee you that I will definitely make this recipe again) is to sweat out the onions out for just a few minutes in a saute pan before adding them into the casserole mixture, as we found the onions to be a bit strong as they were listed in this recipe.  Otherwise, it is pure casserole perfection!!  Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe with the universe!!

My whole family really enjoyed this!  I used light sour cream and added some chopped fresh spinach like another reviewer suggested.  I also sauteed the onions with the pork and mixed it all together in the same pan I cooked the pork and onions in.  Incredibly good and definatly a keeper!  Its sort of a different take on chicken and dumplings!  Thx for the recipe!!!

I made this to take to the field during harvest and it was a hit.  Don't we love to tweak recipes!! I doubled the meat and perogies, sauted the onions after the meat and sprinkled the top with French's Fried Onions.  I used Mrs. Dash and pepper as seasoning. This is a keeper.

My rating may be just a little off as I changed the recipe to fit my familys likes and dislikes. Chives,not rosemary added some broccoli I had leftover from the stuffed pork dinner the night before to add some color. I used the cooked pork cut into cubes, cream corn because that is what I had on hand. I have never cooked pierogies befor I'm glad I found them. The family loved it and I have a new goto casserole.

Made according to recipe.  Tasty and something different that everyone in the family enjoyed.  Everyone felt that the pierogies needed to be doubled for next time.  Would also be very good with chicken.

We just aren't fans of the  taste of canned soups. So I made a very basic cream soup using chicken stock, leaving it on the thick side, so as not to thin it out too much when the sour cream was added. I eliminated the milk, as it was in the cream soup I had made. I cut up boneless pork loin, removing all the fat. After browning off the meat, I then carmelized the onions. This eliminated the slight crunchiness that can result from onions in a casserole that have not been precooked, which can be off-putting to many. Additionally, caramelizing them lends a powerhouse of depth to the flavor of almost any dish. It was delicious - comfort food on steroids!  Cheesy, starchy, stick-to-your-ribs goodness. Eliminated the corn, as we had it last night. It's not a deal-breaker; I'll add it the next time. The fresh rosemary was lovely, and complemented the pork. To sum it up,  the recipe has many good things going for it, but replacing the canned soup with something made fresh, as well as carmelizing the onions both represent a huge advance in flavor. As is, it's a respectable, if unexciting option when pressed for time. Could only give it a 5 if it needed no tinkering, which we felt this did, in order to make it great.

What a great recipe to use up leftover pork loin, which is what I used.  I used all the ingredients the recipe called for, just in different forms.  My pork was leftovers, I made ‘Cream of Anything Soup’ a personal recipe from AR – mine happened to be Cream of Pepper Soup using green and yellow peppers as we do not care for mushrooms, corn that I had froze rather than canned and Pepper Jack Cheese as I was out of Cheddar cheese.  This came together quickly since my pork was already cooked.  I just mixed up everything in the pan that I boiled the pierogies in and poured it in a casserole dish.  This was hot and delicious in 35 minutes.  I did let it rest for about 8 minutes before serving to let the cheese and soup set up just a little.  I served this with ‘Coleslaw with Grapes and Spinach’ from AR and we had a wonderful dinner.  DH & DS already called “dibs” on the leftovers.  Thanks 3Scorpios for sharing this recipe.  We love pierogies and I’m always looking for new ways to fix/serve them.

I used ground pork and thyme instead of loin and rosemary but really who cares because this was just so very very good. My husband asked me to make it again the next day! I do lots of cooking and this recipe is cheap, quick, and tastes amazing.

I made this recipe basically as is, except I used left over pork roast.  This is comfort food for sure!  We both had extra servings and were groaning on the couch.  Very easy to prepare, and adaptable.

I used 2 packs mini cheese and potato pierogies, left over pork roast sauteed with whole medium onion, cream of chicken soup the sour cream and milk and a bag of fresh baby spinach.  Topped with sharp cheddar cheese.  My family loved this recipe and it was gone in minutes.  Next time I'll make two so there's leftovers.

I didnt really care for this dish, my BF thought it was just ok as well. We both wanted more spice or something to brighten the flavors.  I used thyme instead of rosemary because I like it better and thought meh its just ok. We have a lot left over and I'm hoping it tastes better the next day.

My fiance and me tryed this recipe other night sounded a little weird at first I never exactly heard of pierogies in a casserole before but I'm so glad we tried it. I made it pretty much is above Except I just roasted the pork instead And no onions. Even my super extra picky fiance loved it and that's when you know it's good!

My husband raved over-the-moon about this dish; we attended college in Pittsburgh and this was such a delightful surprise--why didn't I ever think to put pierogies in a casserole?!  I made the following changes, to suit our preferences:
--Mini-pierogies instead of the large ones, so that they are bite-size like everything else in the dish.  Also, I pan-fried them in butter instead of boiling them; they are so much tastier!
--Cream of celery soup instead of cream of mushroom
--Greek yogurt instead of sour cream
--No corn
--Sautéed onion slices to carmelize and then added pork to pan to cook
--Doubled the cheese
Thanks so much for a very tasty treat--will definitely make again!

To went with all the reviews and decided to try something new. We really didnt like it. The rosemary give it a funky taste. And it was really THICK. There was no texture. Not to mention I never liked mushroom and corn put together.

I made homemade cheddar bacon potato perogies (recipe found on here) then I added minced garlic and only used 1/4 tsp of rosemary, also used mixed veggies (corn, peas, carrots, green beans). Everyone loved it. It was very creamy. Full of flavor. I had to fry up bacon for the perogies so afterward I used a bit of bacon grease to cook the pork and I also cooked the onions in the same pan.

Made  a couple of modifications, I added some mushrooms and sautéed them and the onions. I also sautéed half the perogies and found that they were better than the ones that were just boiled.

Very good, but I thought it needed a little more flavor so I used leftover garlic rosemary pork loin, added a can of chopped green chilies, sauted the pierogies with a little butter, olive oil, onion and used a little paprika.....Perfect!

I am giving this 5 stars because it was easy, relatively quick and it was very tasty. I made it almost exactly from the recipe except that I added maybe 1/2 pound of left over cooked green beans. My husband didn't care for the pierogies because he thought they were too doughy but that may have been the brand I used. The recipe is good though. Simple comfort food. Great for a cold wet night. I served it with garlic bread.

We made this last night and it was great! I will probably make it again with chicken instead of pork. And add a little more spice to it.

I really liked this recipe, though I really wasn't planning on it! I made no changes, except I sautéed the onions for a few minutes in a tbs of butter to get rid of any raw onion flavor. Be aware, this recipe is very rich, great for a cold day and needing to fill up a lot of bellies! I agree that a few more pierogies  wouldn't hurt this recipe. I love the rosemary, it added just the right touch. Thyme would change everything, for good or bad, depending on your preference.  My 16 yo daughter loved it!

I substituted tyme for rosemary due to being out of rosemary.  I found this dish to be "something to eat".  Didn't like it, but still ate it.
