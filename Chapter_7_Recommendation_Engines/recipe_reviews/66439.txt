I really wanted this recipe to be great - but it was a disaster!  I should have known something would go wrong since onions give off a lot of water/juices when they cook!  The end result was NOT a traditional "au gratin" dish but more of cheesy soupy onion mess.  It was hardly edible and a great disappointment (not to mention waste of perfectly good onions)!  My only recommendation/suggestion for fixing this would be to bake the onions first without the mixture - pour off the excess liquid - then add the flour/cream mixture and cheeses and bake again... that's the only thing that comes to mind to avoid the soup I ended up with.  However, with that said - I will NOT be making this again!

This is absolutely one of my most favorite sides. I suggest, if you can find them in your area, using the sweets. And using Campbell's double strength beef broth really amps up the flavor, you'll just have to cut out the excess salt. And a little more cheese never hurt anyone. ;)

This was pretty good.  The onions were surprisingly sweet.  Didn't have cream so used milk instead.  I'm sure the cream would have made it richer but I don't know that it needed it.  Will make again.

I did make changes.
I used 3 white onions then Sauted In butter till almost carmelized. 
I used Xanthan gum instead of flour to thicken.
I used a mix of mozzarella, cheddar and parmesa cheese. I added thyme and parsley along with the salt and pepper. 
Will make again!

I made this last year for Thanksgiving and it was very well received.  I did cook the onions in a skillet on the stove before baking them in order to release some of the liquid onions tend to give off when cooked. However, I used too much butter. and the wrong cheese (I had cheddar and it sounded good) so my end result was still liquidy.  I blame my over use of butter and the oiliness cheddar has when melted.  My fault.  The end result was still fantastic and it's already been asked for this year (and talked about a few times since lol).
I usually despise when someone reviews a recipe that they've altered so much it's a ghost of its original version,  but I also realize cooking is an art and it's good to put your own ideas and spin on things.  Bottom line,  you can't go wrong trying this.

This was so amazing! I used vegetarian beef flavored broth and added extra cheese because I love it. This was by far my favorite Thanksgiving dish today! Thank you so much for sharing this.

I modified this recipe. I will make again. I used 2 onions and placed in a pampered chef pie plate. I sauteed the onions in couple tablespoons of butter for about 5 or so minutes. I didn't measure out exactly but I made 1/4 cup of beef broth, put enough flour into broth to make thick consistency. Added enough heavy cream to thin it out just a tad. (Usually don't have cream on hand but did because of holiday recipe) stirred all this together with onions then put into pie plate, sprinkled sharp cheddar (only thing on hand) then baked 30 mins uncovered. Nice change to onions

This is a perfect recipe. I have substituted the very small onions that you can buy at your grocery store instead of using larger onions. M
