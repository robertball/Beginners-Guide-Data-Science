We used this for dipping sauce for lumpias.  My husband loved it.  Scaled to make servings for only 1/2 the amount of the recipe.  We used red peper flakes instead of chili

Excellent if a bit salty. Used it as a base for a salad tonight but have also used it with spring rolls. Very good stuff. Thanks :)

With a little bit of tweaking plus a little splash of soy sauce,  this turned out really great. We had with some generic boxed spring rolls, and they were actually really good. It would also make a good base for an Asian-style salad dressing. Thanks!

I'm not sure what the "restaurant" version tastes like, but if it is similar to this, I won't like it...Too vinegary....IF I make this again, I will be tweaking a LOT...Less vinegar, brown instead of white sugar, and chili paste to mix better...and I heated it up while everything else cooked.

This was pretty good, and very similar to the dipping sauce at my favorite restaurant. I think it might be better if it were a little sweeter though. I will make this again.
