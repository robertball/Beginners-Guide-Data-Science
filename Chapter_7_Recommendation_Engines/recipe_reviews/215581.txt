I used a large chunked frozen banana and omitted the figs only because we did not have any. Even missing the figs, this smoothie was delicious.

This is a lovely summery drink.  I did leave out the figs (personal preference), so I upped the amount of banana.  Thanks, Sue!

I used home made cranberry juice to cut some sugar.  Upped the watermelon  and figs  (  6 figs :0) to use them up.

Flavorful smoothie without the tang of yogurt. I subbed some frozen raspberries for the strawberries and also added a few scoops of protein powder and did not add the figs. Perfect natural sweetness with no additional sweetener required. Thank you Soup Lover-Sue for a nice smoothie recipe!

I will be making this again. I think I'll make some Popsicles out of this as well.
