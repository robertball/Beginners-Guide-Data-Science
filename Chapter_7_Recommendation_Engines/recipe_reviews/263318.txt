I cut the honey, oil & vinegar to 1/2  to save on calories, plus I added 1/2 large carrot (spiralized) for extra nutrition & color. I juiced a small orange and coated the apple (spiralized) to keep it from turning brown as I don't think that I can eat all of it in one day and added the remainder of the juice to the dressing. Will be having it as a side for Salmon Patties.

Not flavorful enough. Pleasant but kind of a non-player in the meal.

This side dish is delicious, but then I love cabbage. I didn't have the rapeseed oil or the best substitue (sunflower oil) so I had to use olive oil. I'm not sure it made a big difference, but this salad is so beautiful that I'll be making it again with the right stuff. I added just a little bit of green cabbage so make it colorful. Thanks for the recipe.
