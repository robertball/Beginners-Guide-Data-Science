OH MY GOSH!!!!
I had 2 fresh pears I needed to use and found this recipe. Just what I was looking for. In fact, I made it again 2 days later with slices of fresh pears , honeycrisp apples and a small amt. of ground nutmeg added. Great with or without the orange flavoring.

I don't like pears and was looking for a recipe to use up some we had on hand.  Both my husband and I liked this recipe.  I substituted 1/4 cup orange juice and 1/2 tablespoon brown sugar for the Cointreau, and it turned out very good.

Very tasty, everyone enjoyed it.  I did not  change anything - followed the recipe exactly.  Next time, I think that I'll slice the pears instead of simmering halves.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was incredible!  I was amazed at how wonderful the pear syrup tasted after one hour of cooking.  I added the vanilla as instructed, but I didn't have Cointreau, only Triple Sec, which seems a bit harsher, so I only added 1 tablespoon.  Next time (and there will be a next time) I don't think I'll add the liqueur at all.  My husband and I enjoyed these pears very much.  Thanks for the recipe!

It was so good I'm making it again in the morning (dicing the pears over waffles) Amazing. We had to sub with orange juice. Sprinkle with cinnamon...it's all that's missing!

These were the perfect ending to our meal tonight! The recipe was just right.
To top them, I whipped some cream.
We don't have any liquer in our house at all, so I did what another reviewer did-left it out. Thanks for the good recipe.

I pretty much followed this recipe to the T and it turned our great! Wonderful smell wafting through the house.  I quartered my pears as I think it is easier to core them that way.  I did add a cinnamon stick at the very beginning and I thought  it added nicely.  I would suppose one could add a few whole cloves for a different flavor too.  Would be great served over vanilla ice cream!  Definitely a recipe to keep!

This was delicious.  I did not have orange liqueur but peach. I added it and it gave the pears a fresh, but not peachy taste.  My only complaint is that my dish looked more like cooked potatoes than pears.  Next time I would add some red food coloring.

I opted to leave my pears whole for presentation's sake and adding only a marginal amount of orange liqueur. I replaced the rest of liqueur with lemon juice upon serving. This is very sweet, (so be warned.) The lemon juice helped cut the sweetness. Was tasty.

I followed this recipe exactly as written. My husband and I enjoyed it very much but we both thought it was much too sweet. I might have allowed it to reduce too much, because even after an hour the "syrup" seemed too watery, so I allowed it to continue simmering for about another half hour. Even so, next time I make this recipe I will reduce the amount of sugar to 1/4 cup or maybe even less. Also, I did sprinkle some cinnamon on one of the pears and thought the flavor was nice, but it overpowered the orange from the Cointreau too much for my taste. 
I also think fresh whipped cream would go great with this recipe.

Excellent and easy to prepare.  I prefer to peel Bosc pears, and I frequently substitute Triple Sec for Cointreau.  Top with a dollop of whipped cream or whipped topping and it's a super dessert for guest dinners.  A drop of red food coloring added to the syrup (after removing the pears) adds color contrast, but is not necessary.  My wife suggests a few drops of chocolate liquor mixed in with the orange liquor while cooking!

I was so anxious to try this recipe on my wife's relatives that I forgot to read the entire recipe.  I didn't halve or core the pears.  I removed the pears and placed them in a bowl while I finished the sauce.  When it was time for dessert I place each pear in the center of the place, ringed the plate with a little sauce, and added a small scoop of vanilla ice cream.  The comments were unexpected!  "Oh wow, pears."  And the compliments wouldn't stop either.  We're still getting Facebook comments as well.  This is a keeper!

Was unsure, so I left the skin on and that seemed to work nicely.  The syrup was very watery even after 90 minutes over medium heat.  Tasted fine, but reminiscent of canned pears.  Not sure I would do it again.

Made it today in a frying pan, I split 3 pears instead of trying to core them whole. It took a while before the syrup cook ed down but that is fine as I wanted to finish them as the entree is ending. Adding a splash of Cointreau tightened every thing up. Next time I will make some pear sorbet or gelato & garnish with mint leaves. Bare bones it is pears in syrup (just like the can) but this is better because the pears are fresh, you control the amount of sugar in the syrup & you can add zip if you want it. Definitely a winner from the POV of both cook & diner.

Delicious Recipe Easy To Make Just Takes Time.  Like others I made a Substitution instead of using Cointreau I used Chambord which has a Raspberry flavor.  5 Stars!

I made this to accompany a baked French toast.  We were in a rush so I quartered the pairs and as soon as they were tender I removed them from the syrup.  That way I could increase the heat and reduce the liquid to syrup faster.  Didn’t have the orange liqueur so I added a piece of dried orange peel along with a cinnamon stick at the beginning.  Everyone liked it so much they poured the syrup over the French toast.

Pretty darn simple. I halved the pears, kept the sugar the same, but tossed them in a small frying pan and added a slight amount of brandy and lit it for a moment to give a little bit of color to the pears. There are many ways to plate this, too. Will definitely make this again.

Yum! I used just one pear and I sliced it instead of halving it. I also got caught up watching TV and didn't keep an eye on the syrup, so it actually started to burn! But once I added the vanilla and triple sec, that mellowed out the slight burnt sugar taste and it was delicious. Especially with vanilla ice cream!

This is awesome! However, when the liquid begins to turn to syrup, watch it very carefully and I would recommend turning the gas down a bit (not in the recipe instructions). One second too late and the syrup can burn. Luckily I saved it but it could have been a disaster.
