This tastes so good.  I'm sipping it right now... I didn't add the whiskey only the spiced rum.  I used Capt. Morgan and I also added 4 packets of Alpine instant spiced apple cidar to the brew.  I followed everything else in this recipe as written.  I served it cold over ice.  This is very yummy you can't even taste the alcohol be careful not to get too drunk it will catch up to you lol.

keeper! Only change I had made was to use Applejack brandy instead of whiskey. It's what I had on hand and it seemed like it would go well with the apple theme. I tried this with  few variations in small batches. It is better warm than cold, and it is better with apple cider instead of apple juice.

YUMMY! Made this to keep me warm while watching the husbands play in their annual "Turkey Bowl" - the guys enjoyed it after the game, once they heard what it was loaded with : ) I cut back on the brown sugar and used diet ginger ale - I see many batches of this in my holiday party future...

This was tasty but a little too sweet.  A cup or two at most was enough.  We halved the recipe and still couldn't finish it because it is so sweet. Good though if you're just planning on one sweet drink.

I recently had a party in January and had this ready for my guests when they arrived, it was a big hit! The only change I made was in adding an extra cinnamon stick.

A perfect winter drink! I do not add the alcohol to the mix after its done simmering. I add it to the individual servings which allows it to be served to those who don't drink alcohol as well.  Even though I find myself adding rum to just about every cup I serve. ;)

A friend was looking for a warm drink to bring to a shrimp boil we were attending.  I suggested allrecipes and she found this wonderful drink.  It kept us nice and tosty from the inside out while we bundled up by the bonfire watching the game projected on the side of the house.  I can't wait to make it for myself.

I make these a lot for my husband and I during the winter time, especially after playing in the snow. 

Very, very good.

Very good and wops a wallop! But tastes more like spiked spiced cider then like the recipe name - hot apple pie.

This was delicious! The only changes I made was not using cinnamon sticks because I'm not a huge fan of cinnamon, but it was amazing. This will definitely be a winter staple!

The apple pie taste comes through very well. However, the alcohol is deceptive! This drink is quickly effective and quite tasty!

I decided to make a batch of this one particularly cold winter weekend and it was so perfect we spent the whole weekend keeping it warm in a crockpot and sipping on it.  I used apple cider instead of juice and we had no issue with the sweetness level, but we did add an additional cup of butterscotch schnapps.

If you haven't used this recipe you are truly missing out. We've been using it for a few years and always goes great at holiday events

If you don't want to commit 32 ounces of alcohol to a single recipe.. You could cut the recipe down to a single serving to see if you like the taste.. Here is the converted recipe without simmering it and without the cinnamon stick.. Please remember I haven't tried it yet.. but i will post again when i get the ingredients. So don't hate me or Mindy if it tastes bad... 1oz spiced rum, 1oz whiskey, 1 tbsp brown sugar, 2oz ginger ale, and 8oz apple juice..

This was good - the first night it was too strong and no one drank it.  So I had the leftovers with a little more apple juice to dilute - yummy and great to warm you on a cold night!
