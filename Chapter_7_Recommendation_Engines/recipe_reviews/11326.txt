I tried this recipe for the first time for my Aunt and Uncle for Hanukkah. My uncle is Jewish, my Aunt (and family) are not. I bought a Hanukkah card which had a reference to rugelach, so I found out what it was and decided to try it.
I find that this recipe calls for speed when handling the dough from frig to oven. Also the amount of raspberry filling had to be cut in half due to the fact that the first batch burnt because of the filling spilling out from the insides while baking. I basically painted the filling on with my pastry brush and that was all I used. I had better luck with the second batch and plan on making it again as with only half the cookies(to give away) there aren't any for me! I did try them and they were delicious!!! 
*****************************************
Ok, I made these again and thought I'd share a tip concerning handling the dough. When I make these, I now separate the dough into 4 equal pieces. I take each individual piece and put it between two pieces of wax paper (before refrigerating), I then roll out the dough, while it's between the wax paper and refrigerate them with the wax paper intact. After 10 minutes or so, just peel off the top layer of wax paper and continue with the recipe. It makes it sooo much easier. Trust me! Good luck:)

These turned out FANTASTIC, and were quite addicting. I'm pretty critical about my baking, and these were one of the few things that I was able to call a success--to my roommate's astonishment ("you've never said that before!") Be sure to FOLLOW DEBORAH'S ADVICE (see previous review) about rolling out the dough between 2 sheets of wax paper before refrigerating--makes it so easy. I divided the dough into 4 balls, rolled each out between 2 sheets of wax paper, and refrigerated them for 20 min while i made the filling. Make sure that when you peel off the wax paper it isn't sticking to the dough--if so, put it back for another 10 min. For the filling, I only used 2 T of sugar, and it was just right. I used 1 T of raspberry jam and it didn't ooze everywhere, and I baked them on parchment paper lined baking sheets. I followed another reviewer's advice of placing them, rolled up and ready to go in the oven, into the fridge first for another 20 min before baking--this ensured that they were nice and flaky. Mine only needed 25 min in the oven.

I've used this recipe for years.  It is the best tasting cookie.  Don't let the dough get warm or it will get sticky.  I take 1 ball at a time out of the refrigerator to work with.  I also add 3/4 c of chopped golden raisins to the filling.

The taste was spot on for rugelach, flaky dough and a delish filling. I used raspberry preserves with seeds which worked fine. I anticipated problems with the dough but it was actually quite simple to roll out, place the filling on, roll up & cook. The only problem I had was a few of them came undone and the filling spilled out. Those few didn't look good but still tasted great! Next time I will freeze the rolled cookies on cookie sheets for 30 minutes before baking, I had success with this trick in another rugelach recipe I tried (after this one). Also, be sure to use wire racks, not paper towels to cool them, the paper towel stuck to the filling. Will definately make again.

Superb rugelach. Actually 4-1/2 stars, only because the dough is one of the most difficult I have ever worked with. Two things necessary, however, when working with it - speed and patience. It needs to be chilled thoroughly at all times. As suggested, I rolled it into rounds (used a pot lid to mark the 9" circle on the waxed paper) between two sheets and refrigerated the sheets for over an hour. Once spread with jam and filling, the dough warmed fast and became sticky, so I couldn't roll the crescents at that time. Had to put the filled circles back into the fridge for another 20 minutes, and halfway through shaping each circle, had to re-chill for 5-10 minutes. Just know that these are labor-intensive. But you'll be rewarded with a lovely, tender pastry, better than any rugelach from a bakery. Buying parchment is not necessary. You can easily use foil instead, shine side DOWN. Gently loosen them from the foil as soon as they get out of the oven, as a bit of the jam and/or sugar will melt out. If you have lots of time, you're going to be very happy with the result.

Fantastic!  I altered it a bit to accommodate my guests.  I made three different types: raspberry, blackberry, and apricot.  I only used preserves in each of them, so no chopped apricots at all.  Very easy and very tasty :)

DELICIOUS!! This was my first attempt at making rugelach (I'm not Jewish)--made them for my boyfriend (who is Jewish) and also for my co-workers for Hanukkah.  I gave some to my boyfriend to try and he loved them and asked me where I got them.  He couldn't believe it when I told him I had made them!!!  He was thoroughly impressed (and I was proud as a peacock!)  I had Jewish co-workers of mine saying that they were the best rugelach they had EVER HAD!!! What a compliment!  This recipe is just incredible.  Highly recommended.  Happy Hanukkah everyone! =]

This is the easiest and the tastiest treat one could make. I am so bad at baking, it's not even funny. But these turned out so good, my husband couldn't believe that he could actually eat and enjoy things that came out of my oven. I recommend it to everybody.

Great recipe, although I've always substituted different items for the raspberry and apricot--blackberry/pecan and apricot/almond make great changes!

I have made this recipe numerous times, but I now cheat. I just use a pre-made pie crust for the dough. It much easier and less time consuming. All other ingredients I have kept the same. A great recipe!

Made these for today's office holiday cookie exchange (had to represent the Tribe!). Total winner.    I modified and simply filled with chopped chocolate chips and walnuts. Oh, and I only baked for 15 minutes.

They turned out yummy yummy! I did use kiwi jam I made and pecans for the filling...the dough is hard to use and is easiest to deal with when cold or it is too sticky..I think 35 mins on my oven was too much the bottoms were a little burnt maybe only 20 mins...

A wonderful cookie, but more appreciated amongst the adults.  I used a pizza cutter to cut into wedges, because I have misplaced my pastry wheel, works great!  I also used parchment instead of the foil, just because that is what I am accustomed to using. Others have commented, and I agree with the suggestion, that these cookies be made a day or two before being served.

WOW. These did not disappoint AT ALL. The recipe made a large enough batch that I was able to share with my office and friends, and everyone wanted the recipe! RAVE REVIEWS all-around! ------------------ I also took Deborah's advice and rolled out the dough between wax paper BEFORE refrigerating (I have a feeling things would've been a total mess had I avoided that advice). That made preparation a cinch. I also used whole wheat flour, and everyone loved it. I can't wait to try these with some new variations on filling!

I made these today and was very disappointed.  While the taste was delicious, the dough was extremely difficult to work with, even after being in the fridge before rolling out between two sheets of parchment.  It was very soft, so after rolling and spreading with the jam (I used Ikea's blueberry and raspberry jam)and apricot mixture, I put the triangles back in the fridge because the dough was too soft to roll.  After an hour I tried to roll them up and first they started to crack and then became unmanageably soft within minutes.  I finally had to just make mounds of dough and filling and bake them.

I won't make them again with this dough, but I've decided to use pre-made puff pastry sheets.  I can get 4 X 4 inch squares here.  I will cut each on diagonal and roll them up and bake them.  I know they won't be rugelach, but at least they will be easier to do and look presentable when finished.

I love this recipe! I started making this during the holiday season because my dad loved the ones he tried from King's. I found this recipe, and it's been a family favorite ever since.  I usually allow the dough to cool for about 5 minutes before rolling it out to prevent it from cracking.  This recipe is also great if you try using different fruit preserves like pineapple, raspberry, peach. Chocolate rugelach can be made by omitting the dried apricot and nut mixture and replacing it with chocolate that has been melted over the stove.

Wow,what a great treat.  Even family members that weren't apricot fans loved these.  A bit of effort to make but well worth it.  Used seet cream butter (unsalted)which gave them an extra buttery taste.  This receipe is definetely a keeper!

I love apricots but I think in this recipe, yellow raisins would have been better. The chopped apricots tended to get a little gummy.Otherwise I had a lot of compliments on the recipe. Thanks a lot!

I made the dough and left it in the fridge overnight and I put the rolling pin in the freezer overnight as well. Prior to rolling out any of it I chilled the granite countertop with a frozen bag of peasl...I had no problem with it being sticky when I rolled it out...Instead of dried apricots, i used apricot preserves and pecans instead of walnuts.  I had dough left over, so I sprinkled it with some of the cinnamon/sugar mixture and rolled them.  an excellent recipe that can be modified to anybody's taste!

I rolled mine out on a ceramic cutting board and when the dough became a bit sticky I just slid it into the freezer for a few minutes while I did something else.  Next year I'm going to follow the reviews and cut the raspberry jelly in half.  It melted, ran out and was a bit messy.  Also, I may just use a smattering of chopped apricots.    I'm going to tell people that I make these every year, but actually this is the first year.  Who will know?

First time I made Rugelach. I made it for an event at our synagogue and I received what I consider to be the ultimate compliment, one lady came up to me and said it tasted just like what her Bubbe used to make. I had no problem with the dough. I refrigerated it overnight.  Have all your ingredients for the filling ready to go. I cooked on parchment paper on cookie sheet instead of foil. As soon as it comes out of the oven, let cool about one minute, then remove with a spatula to wire racks otherwise they will stick.

These are wonderful things, whatever type of preserves you use. And a mix of regular and golden raisins are as good as the apricots.  The wax paper roll-out-and-chill in another review is excellent.   I do roll rectangles instead of circles,  spread the filling & roll into a log 1 to 1-1/2 inches in diameter, dust with the cinnamon topping, then cut into short lengths and bake. Still has the spiral effect, but less filling oozes out.

Want something easier, faster and fewer calories & cookies? Buy a tube of Crescent "Rounds" Original. (These are strips not triangles of dough.) Downsize the filling recipe (I kept it pretty close to what it called for and really packed each cookie with filling). Separate and spread the dough pieces out on greased parchment paper laying on a cookie sheet.  Follow the recipe, loading the strips up with preserves, followed by the nut, apricot, sugar mixture. Roll them up and lay flat on the parchment paper. If the filling falls out just put it on top, brush with milk and sprinkle with brown/white sugar. Bake at 325 degrees for approx. 20 minutes. Yummy !

These were such a hit!  I added them to my Christmas cookie trays and they were the most talked about cookie out of all the cookies I made.

The dough is similar to my mom's Russian version of the recipe.  Wonderful.  It was gone within 1 day.  I had doubled the recipe.  I used the original filling for the 1st half.  Raspberry preserves are a wonderful touch.  For the 2nd half, I used apricot preserves and then sprinkled a mixture of chopped walnuts with brown sugar.

These are super delicious and very pretty cookies.  They are a little time consuming but worth it.  I made the variation with brown sugar and apricot spread.  I added the brown sugar to the sugar nut mixture and sprinkled it over the apricot spread that I brushed on the dough.  I used no sugar added preserves because that was all I had on hand.  At first they were oozing a bit and I thought they would be too soggy but after a little more time in the oven, they were perfect. These are a keeper.

Just made these cookies and they are wonderful. Really awesome flavor. I would recommend watching the amount of raspberry jam you spread on the dough. My first batch really oozed and I didn't transfer immediately to cool. The result was not so great. Cookies stuck to foil like cement. After I adjusted my jam they are great! I found that transfering to a piece of parchment paper was perfect for cooling.
Enjoy this yummy treat!

Quite a bit of work (time wise, not in difficulty)for an amateur baker, but worth the effort. I followed advice from another rugelach recipe to put the rugelach into the fridge for 20 minutes before baking. This was great as I needed that much time to get two trays of rugelach ready. Even my 3 year old loves these (I made mine without walnuts). Thank you!

This had just the flavor I was looking for.  I couldn't find seedless preserves, so trying to strain regular was a pain, and the dough was really sticky and difficult to work with, but the finished product was nice.

Great recipe! I substituted the apricots with craisins for a tart and chewy texture. I also rolled into a log instead and baked it for an additional 15 minutes. Delicious!

Chopping walnuts and apricots to the right size is a trick. They should be small but not so small they disappear.

they are wonderful, very very addictive. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is the difficulty in working with the dough and in forming the crescents and also the fact thet the jam goes running all over the place. But a fair amount stays inside (I used blackberry jam in the end, not so runny, luckily!). So, my result was not so pretty, it's time consuming, but it's a recipe to keep absolutely.

It is a really good recipe but it is pretty hard to make. To work the dough takes quite an effort also it gets really messy to put the Rugelashes together. Not to mention the baking part. I feel that the raspberry preserve should be no more than 1/2 tsp since it goes all over the cookie sheet at baking. It was my first time baking it so I was quite overwhelmed. May be next time I'll reduce the amount of preserves and see how it turns out. Other than that it is a tasty cookie.
