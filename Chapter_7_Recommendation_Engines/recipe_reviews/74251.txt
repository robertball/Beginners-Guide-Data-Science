Tasty and cheap. I skipped the Mann's vegetables. Because I didn't have coriander, I increased the cumin and added nutmeg, red pepper, parsley, and raisins. I added two pieces of chicken. I garnished it w/ yogurt mixed w/ tumeric and cumin. Yum.

Tasted OK, a bit bland if you are used to spicy food. I would not try it again.
