Great bakery muffin flavor! I couldn't find Blueberry Delight so I chose Country Berry, a mix of strawberry, raspberry and blueberry. I used frozen organic wild blueberries, and subbed corn oil for canola. The crumble topping is spectacular! I baked in my convection oven at 350 and they took about 20 minutes. 12 perfect sized muffins. Thanks Mott's!

I made these for Thanksgiving breakfast and they were well received.  I used Motts Unsweetened Applesauce, which I almost always have on hand.  I also replaced the canola oil with coconut oil (mine doesn't impart any flavor) and I forgot the baking soda.  I really like the idea of adding wheat germ.  The muffins were still moist 24 hours after baking, but I did think they were a bit heavy.  Oh, and mine did not turn green, LOL!

We love blueberries so this recipe was perfect for us. It didn't disappoint! I didn't change a  thing and the flavor and texture were perfect. I used frozen berries so every bite was a pleasure of moist bread and juicy berries.I'll make this recipe again.

I could not find the Mott's Healthy Harvest Blueberry Delight Applesauce so I used Mott's regular applesauce and doubled the fresh blueberries.  These were a hit with my family!

Moist muffin. I didn't have wheat germ, so subbed finely chopped pecans.

These were really good! My husband is a big fan of blueberries and these will be great for him to grab on the way out the door in the morning. They bake up nicely and came outof the pan perfectly. Will make again :)

These are delicious if you close your eyes when you eat them...mine turned a really, really unpleasant color green.  But next time I'd try omitting the baking soda and doubling the baking powder to see how they turn out.  Blueberries and baking soda often equal green and I think the combo of the blueberries in the applesauce and the soda made for an oddly forest green muffin.

But they are bursting with blueberry flavor, and this recipe is otherwise a keeper.  Very easy to make, very delicious muffins.

I cut the recipe to 4 servings and did get four nicely sized muffins.  I used cinnamon applesauce, butter instead of oil for the crumble topping, and went a little heavy on the vanilla and cinnamon.  These turned out very moist and good, but there was a lot of greasy residue on the outside bottom of my muffin papers--not sure what caused that.  Thanks, Mott's!

Good thing I made these on Halloween because I was very disappointed when the muffins turned green. No doubt it was a chemical reaction with the baking powder or soda and the blueberries. The recipe doesn't state whether or not to use frozen blueberries which I will next time and yes I mean next time because the flavor was easily five stars.

10.15.19 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/239455/blueberry-delight-muffins/ ... While good, not exceptional.  The topping was surprisingly good - especially considering the ease of making it.   It wasn't crispy like the cut-in-butter type, but slightly firm.  I added an extra half cup of berries.  Twelve nicely rounded muffins with average beauty appeal - not that beauty matters.  Winkwink.  :)

Pretty good with my changes. 

I used oats instead of wheat bran - chopped coarsely in the batter, and whole in the streusel.  Used 100% whole wheat pastry flour, as I don't keep all purpose on hand, and I only added a tbs of olive oil in the batter, as it seemed odd to add so much additional oil after applesauce. (Used 1 cup of just regular ol' applesauce, btw.) Also used butter in the topping instead of oil. Got nice domes, and came up with exactly 12 standard muffins.

Not sure why others mention getting a green muffin, and I did not experience that. I used blueberries that I had frozen, and tossed them in the flour mixture before quickly adding the liquids until combined. Maybe that helped, but I couldn't be sure.

I myself haven't tried these, because my personal trainer has banned me from wheat & flour (temporarily) .... but the reviews from friends and coworkers are awesome!! I found this recipe late last night, and got to baking. SO super easy!!! I used whole wheat flour instead of white (in the hopes that my Pt says okay, just one!), and i only had regular applesauce cups on hand (this ws 1130pm!) but that's all i changed - I  DID try the batter before baking, and WOW, delicious...!!

Nice recipe. The batter needs a little milk added to it. Other than that they're great!
