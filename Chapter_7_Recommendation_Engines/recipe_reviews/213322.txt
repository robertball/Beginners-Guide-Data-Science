I actually really liked this.  I was surprised because I really hated the idea of using canned soup in caponata but I was trying to clean out the pantry and had a can of it so decided to try it.  It turned out great.  I did not serve it as an appetizer, I think it would have been too runny for that.  I did toss it with penne pasta and topped it with parmesan cheese and it was great!  I did need to add some salt to it once it got on the pasta.  Those that don't like the idea of using soup . . . I think this would be great with regular diced tomatoes, canned or fresh too.  UPDATE:  I have made this again-pureed it in the blender and used it as a pasta sauce-it was 5 stars!  Topped with a bit of parmesan, it made a great pasta dish, with rave reviews all around!  Healthy too!  I will definitely make it again that way.  To make the sauce, I did add a bit of sea salt and cut the water to only 1 cup.  Everything else I kept the same as listed in the recipe except for pureeing it at the end of the cooking time.  Soooo good!

Was greatly disappointed with this one... A far fling from traditional Sicilian sweet and sour eggplant salad. This is closer to ratatouille. It tasted fine (runny as other critiques mentioned), but not what I was expecting (wanting).

I used less water, added two roasted annehiem peppers and a little kosher salt. It was fantastic. Using less water, you will have to stir every couple of minutes

This shouldn't be listed as an appetizer.  It has way too much liquid, even after cooking down for quite a while more than listed.  It will, however, make a good topping for pasta.
