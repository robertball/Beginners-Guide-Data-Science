Outstanding! I'm a transplant from Rhode Island to Florida. This is great, like going to the corner bakery back home, and very easy to make.

I became a member just to review this recipe! Not even close to RI bakery pizza strips. Took one bite.

Pretty darn close as-is.  I cut the sugar to 2 tablespoons, and add a small can (8 oz)of tomato sauce.  We like ours extra saucy.   I've made this 20+ times for various functions, and the RI er's actually like mine better.  Or maybe there just being nice.  In any case it's always a big hit.

I have tried to make RI pizza strips several times with no luck.  Always something was off.  Was one of my fav foods when I was there, I was born and raised there then moved away as an adult.  These were the BOMB!  I made my own dough, and unlike me I actually followed the recipe to the tee...  I had to cook them a couple min longer, probably a climate thing, but LET ME TELL YOU...they rocked!!!!  Thank you so much, the exact taste I have been missing, this is a KEEPER!!

I absolutely loved it! As close to pizza strips as you can get outside of Rhode Island. I cut sugar to 1tbsp and used the Red Gold brand of crushed tomatoes since they only have naturally occurring citric acid. My family loved it, and this will keep them content until our yearly trip back home to Rhode Island??

I was born and raised in little Rhody and love bakery pizza!!!! So, for homemade pizza strips, WOW....!!!!!  I've made this several times and have not been disappointed at all!
I did cut down to 1 Tbsp. of sugar and it's just fabulous.  I make it often and am very pleased each time....a keeper for sure.   YUM!

I made this for my daughter's class for part of her state report that she did on RI. It is yummy, however I found it to be far too sweet, so I would suggest reducing the amount of sugar and tasting the sauce before adding more. I know canned tomatoes vary in sweetness, so maybe the cans I used were extra sweet. Just a tip!
