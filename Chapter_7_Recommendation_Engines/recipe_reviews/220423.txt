Very simple, but tasty.  Didn't have the couscous with flax seed so substituted whole wheat couscous with a roasted garlic and olive oil flavor.  Used orange pepper instead of red.  Omitted butter.

Trying to eat more veggies and this recipe did the trick.  My husband loved it ... I also make this with other veggies I have hangin'out in my fridge.  Quick & easy anytime.
