This was the first time I ever made or ate cucumber soup and was a bit skeptical but I had tons of cucumbers coming out of our garden and had to do something with them so I thought what the heck I'll try it. The only thing I did different was I boiled a leg and thigh section of chicken in a separate pot until tender then shredded it and added it to the simmering soup.  I also used about a tablespoonful of powdered chicken soup base but powdered chicken bouillon would also work just as well and I reduced my salt accordingly. I also added some of the water to my soup that I had boiled my chicken in but you could add more of the canned chicken stock instead if you like. The flavor was so good that my husband said he'd be happy if I made this soup from now on when we have lots of cucumbers coming off the garden. P.S. He came back for seconds. I think he was as surprised at how good this soup was as I was. Thanks for sharing the recipe! I think the addition of the soup base powder and especially the real chicken bits really made the difference in how flavorful this soup turned out.

This is a great recipe-you wanna make it more zingy? I added more pepper, as my hubby likes lots of pepper, and then I added  chopped up cilantro.  The Thai restaurant  I had cucumber soup at had cilantro.  I didn't have lemon juice, so I put in lime juice.  It turned out super yummy-peppery and the cilantro really adds a lot.  If you like ciantro, that is!  You either hate it or love it!  Thanks for this recipe!

Based on everyone's suggestions to make it more chicken-y I used some cream of chicken soup I had in the cabinet instead of broth and added a little bit of bouillon. I had no idea that cooked cucumber would be so tasty! It was a hit with my girls (2 & 7) just as it was; I liked mine better with some pepper but it didn't need salt. Next time I would also add some shredded chicken and make a larger batch to fill it out; these portions were enough to feed us girls a small lunch but wouldn't be close to enough if my husband were home.

Awesome flavour! I added fresh cilantro only because I love cilantro. I'd Definitely make this again

This is good, but it's still missing something to be like they have at my favorite Thai restaurant.  I think it would help if I use a more concentrated chicken broth next time.  I'm not sure what else to adjust, but I definitely think that would help.  I liked it well enough to give it another shot anyway.

Very easy but way too bland.  The "zesty" just isn't there.
I will make it again, but will add fresh ginger, chile peppers and maybe some hot sauce

I'm still trying to figure out what is zesty about this soup, and what makes it Thai. I found it very plain. I made it per the recipe, and added quite a bit of pepper because I was afraid it was lacking. It needs more spices. I've added some curry to the leftovers, and will see if it is better when I have more tomorrow. I won't make this again.

I did not find this recipe enjoyable. I followed the recipe and included the first reviewer's comments of adding the cooked, shredded chicken, added extra bouillon, added a little extra chicken broth. I thought that this soup lacked all flavor.  I would not do again!
