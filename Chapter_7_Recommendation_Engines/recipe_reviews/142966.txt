As another reviewer noted, this is not like "restaurant style" Murgh Makhni.  On the other hand, authentic Indian food is seldom like American-style "Indian" restaurant food.  Thick gravy is made in restaurants by the addition of cornstarch or other thickener.  No Indian cook I know does so.

While the recipe calls for two onions, the size of onions varies greatly - up to grapefruit size.  I'd suggest using onions to taste, especially since people vary wildly in how well they like onions.

I think the suggested size for the chicken is too big, I'd go for about an inch cubes and then it'll cook more quickly too.  Prep time is about right.

Somebody complained about the ingredients being incorrect - that again is a matter of taste.  There is no one recipe for any Indian dish, although some vary less than others.  India's a big place.  I've seen simpler recipes and I've seen more complicated - Indian cooks are typically a LOT more inventive than most American's I know.  This one is typical of the dish as served in many, though not all, Indian homes.  The bell pepper is not so typical in India, but many Indian cooks use it stateside because of the ready availability here.

This is not a bad place to start. I used 2 more tomatoes, less onion (half of one), 1 more garlic, and fresh fenugreek leaves. I skipped the yogurt and used fat free half and half. A pound of chicken is also a bit much. I used one good sized breast. Also, use whole caradmom/cloves/cinnamon. Where is the turmeric?

This is nothing like authentic butter chicken. Several wrong ingredients are used and are prepared incorrectly. It really is so completely different that it should not be called butter chicken at all. Most annoyingly of all, the prep time stated is grossly inaccurate unless you are superwoman.

This dish tasted fabulous.  Just the right amount of spice, and lots of flavour.  Your house will smell wonderful when cooking this dish.  Served with naan bread on the side to soak up the sauce - which there is plenty of.  This did not turn out like the traditional butter chicken in Indian restaurants.  Sauce was not thick, however the dish is delicious nonetheless.

This was an excellent recipe.  Easy to prepare and very tasty.  The only substitution I made was using cayenne pepper for the crushed red pepper.  I can't imagine it tasting all that different with the crushed red peppers versus the cayenne pepper.  This is a definate keeper.  My hubby loved it as well as children. Not too bad if I don't say so myself.

I don't know what butter chicken is supposed to taste like, but this was a real hit.  While it was cooking, it really smelled like Indian food.  We live in Puerto Rico and don't have any ethnic restaurants near us, so it was like going out for dinner!  I will definitely make this again.  (I did have to leave out the cloves because I couldn't find them in the stores).

It was pretty good, but not what I thought it was going to be!  I was looking for the butter chicken taste from my favorite Indian restaurant.  This isn't it, but it IS good.

This wasn't like restaurant butter chicken, but it was still delicious - and I was missing nutmeg, ginger, cloves and lemon. I added extra garam masala to compensate and it was delicious!

Sorry to say but this recipe is not very nice at all. There is way too much onion in the recipe and really didnt taste like butter chicken at all.

We liked this dish!  With my  modifications and with what I had on hand it probably didn't taste exactly the same!  I had to substitute canned tomatoes.   I didn't have the following, so I improvised; no garam masala so I added a black cardamon pod, a bay leaf and 1 tsp chili powder.  I had a cup of yogurt, but no cream!  I used chicken thighs too and cut the onion down to 1/2 onion and left out the bell peppers completely since my boys are fussy and don't like them!  I would like to try it with the garam masala next time... I served over basmati rice!

Loved this recipe! I didn't have the peppers or heavy cream. I used half and half instead. I used one onion and it was the right amount.

That was my first try in Indian Butter Chicken and I was fascinated by the smooth and fresh taste. As I love coriander I added some more than written in the list. Just perfect!

We loved this curry.  We are going away so I wanted to use up some perishable items in the fridge.  I filtered plain yogurt, tomatoes, chicken and this is the recipe that popped up.  I didn't have bell peppers, so I par-boiled sliced carrots and added them.  I didn't have half-and-half so I used a 1/4 cup cream cheese.  I added 2 TBSPs tomato paste.  Hubs who is not a huge curry fan had two helpings.  Thanks.

Added entire extra stick of butter and bloomed the spices before adding onion and building the sauce. Let it simmer for hours with the chicken in it. Trust me. Used tomato paste and veg from the garden to finish it. Add spice, i.e. crushed red pepper, cayenne, turmeric, ghost chili powder, etc. Low and slow. Gives time for garlic naan. To the haters of this recipe, doctor it up to your liking instead of complaining. Your fam will thank you for it.

I make this recipe regularly- I must have made it more than 20 times by now.  I find the most important aspect is to get the Garam Masala right. Do not get any garam masala that has salt - as it puts how much salt the dish has out of control. I use "Neera's Garam Masala".

I made this with bone in thighs and marinated over night.  I used less chilli for the children, and used ghee rather than butter.  It's a big hit with my family. When I don't have double cream, I use thick Greek/Turkish or Indian yoghurt.

I just tried this recipe. it is to die for. I didn't have a lot of the spices needed. so I did this to make it easier to what I had. a can of coconut milk and tomatoes sauce. I used all spice, cumin, paprika, garlic, and red Currie power. then added the cubed chicken breast. I seasoned it to taste the same. everyone can substitute. Taste in between to get the appropriate taste for each cook. 
cheers
