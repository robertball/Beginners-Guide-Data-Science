I made these to bring to a dinner party and everyone went crazy over them.  I don't eat shrimp myself, so I served them without tasting them, but I was told that they were better than any coconut shrimp anyone had ever tasted.  I cooked them before we left the house and put them in a covered glass cake pan and then heated them in the oven at 350F for about 4-5 minutes.

Awesome! We will definitely make this again. We did not have marmalade so we mixed together honey, horseradish and mustard for the sauce and it turned out yummy. The batter was really thick so I added 1/4 cup more beer. I used light beer but I can't imagine that would make the batter thicker.

Tried it and it was as good as coconut shrimp in restaurants. Be sure to use fairly large shrimp.

A little twist on the usual coconut shrimp I make from this site which is also fabulous. Before you dredge your shrimp into the flour, make sure you dry them well with paper towels. I used pineapple marmalade for this and once coated with the coconut, we let them sit for fifteen minutes before we started the frying process. We made thirty skewers with three shrimp on each and my company couldn't get them into their mouths fast enough. This was an appy and I'm sad to say there were no leftovers! Thank you so much!!

Awesome shrimp recipe!! The only thing I had to change was to add more beer because my batter was really thick with just 1/3 cup. They looked beautiful though and tasted just as good as restaurant coconut shrimp. Will definitely make again and recommend to others!

A wonderful recipe.

Try this substitution: Replace the 1 Lb of Shrimp with 1 Lb of froglegs.  Mmmmm!

(Even my kids liked 'em.)

This was wonderful. Very easy to make. I found a bottle of horseradish mustard combined at Wal-Mart and I used 12 Tbsp. I also used about 1/2 c. or more of the beer. 1/3 c. wasn't quite enough. I had also only used 1/2 lb. of large shrimp and the recipe barely made enough batter(flour, baking powder.... mixture) to cover all of the shrimp. If you plan to use a whole pound of large shrimp, you may want to double the recipe. This recipe really is great!!!!!  :)

Absolutely fantastic!!!I thought going in that it had too many ingredients, but I was wrong. Loved the sauce, loved the shrimp. only have to deep fry about 3 minutes and voila. My family wants this everyday now.  thanks a bunch. (i unfortunately did not find creole mustard,used grainy Dijon, but will keep looking)

4 stars only due to the following changes: used sweetened coconut flakes (all I had). Turned out great. Chilled coated shrimp in freezer for 20 minutes before frying. This helps hold the batter together. I didn't make the dipping sauce; a squirt of lime juice was all these needed. Great! You'll notice one shrimp gone from my pretty arrangement - that was my father-in-law, unable to wait for me to snap my pic :-)

I made this for my god-daughters luau themed birthday party and it was a hit!!! The only thing I changed was the prepared mustard to stone ground mustard, it gave it a little more texture.  This has now become my signature dish!!! We could not make enough to satisfy the crowd.

I loved it, I thought it was an interesting and tasty way to make shrimp from the original, "garlic butter." I thought the common spices you added to the batter made quite the difference.

I used thin sliced chicken breast instead of shrimp, and it turned out great!  A little greasy, but I think that was my fault since I don't have a deep fryer and was having trouble with oil temp control.  Used sweetened coconut since that was what I had at home and it "over caramelized" but when I mixed it into the batter it wasn't a problem.  Can't wait to try with shrimp!

This was wonderful!  The best coconut shrimp I've made.  I did make a few changes though.  I added about 1/2 cup beer and some milk until the consistency was right. No curry powder.  Added 1/4 cup Japanese bread crumbs to coconut mixture.  Served with a orange marmalade sauce.

As a huge fan of seafood and coconut (especially together!), I make this recipe a lot. I do add a bit more beer for flavor and add a cup of panko crumbs to the coconut shreds for crispiness. If you don't mind the cost, you can substitute coconut cooking oil for the vegetable oil to make it a bit healthier.

hubby loved with cocktail sauce. I took the tails off and used med shrimp. For a 1/2 lb, I used 3/4 c flour, 1/4 t baking powder and paprika, no curry powder (hubby does not like it), 1/8 t salt and cayenne, 3/4 c beer. I did put the coconut in my mini chopper and had no problem with it sticking to the shrimp. You must heat the oil, I did for 10 minutes and for people with out a therm, 375 on my gas stove was a lil above medium. To reheat, 350 in oven for 5 minutes. Very good

This is the best coconut shrimp that we ever had. One change we had soda water on hand instead of beer and it still had a beer batter texture from the foam from the soda water. The recipe called for 1/3 cup of beer and I ended up using about 2/3 cup of soda water. We didn't need nearly as much of the sauce which also by the way was incredible with this shrimp. This is definitely a keeper

The flavors in this were really great! The only thing I had to change was the batter. It was way to thick so I needed to add about a 1/4 cup of the beer. Also, I didn't use a deep frier because I don't have one so at first I burnt a couple because my oil was too hot but I was able to adjust the temp and then they turned out great!

This recipe was easy and delicious. My husband was wowed. The sauce is surprisingly perfect for this recipe. I found after a bit if I let the batter drip off the shrimp a bit, it was a lot cleaner and better shrimp to batter ratio. I just tapped the shrimp with batter on the side of the bowl to get some of the extra batter off.

Made these last night and I thought the finished product was very good. I had to add more beer to the beer batter, because the amount specified created more of a paste than a batter. All told used about 6 ounces
