I guess the flavor was okay but this cake felt like a lead block. It was so dense and heavy. Not worth the effort. Check out the Died and Went to Heaven Chocolate Cake instead.

MMMMMMMMM is what my family said. My son-in-law is diabetic and I know very little about cooking for him. I got a sample of Settle's Best Coffee and this recipe was with it. It turned out great . He felt so special and had my daughter cut it into slices , wraped, and into the frezzer. Now all he has to do is go to the frezzer. Thank you for putting the nutrution value on this site. That info. did not come with the coffee.
