Tasty and easy.  Never bothered with the “cooling off” and reheating part.  I just mashed them hot and then served.  The almonds really add something special.  I microwaved 2 sweet potatoes (on the smallish side) for 3.5 minutes, flipped, 3.5 more minutes, flipped, then 2 more minutes, checked them, and 2 more minutes.  I love that this doesn’t load them up with butter and cream, letting the sweet potato flavor really shine through.

Very sweet.  Loved the idea of using the microwave to cook the potatoes.  It saved so much time in the preparation.

I love sweet potatoes and am always looking for new sweet potato recipes.  This recipe is great!  Amaretto complements the flavor of sweet potatoes perfectly.  Instead of microwaving them, I just baked five sweet potatoes for an hour at 400 degrees (after puncturing the skin, of course), then peeled the skin off the potatoes and mashed them up with Amaretto, ground ginger and cinnamon.  The sweet potatoes are so soft after being baked that you don't really need to mash them.  Tastes amazing!

I used grated fresh ginger root and added 2 TBSPs unsalted butter.  It was a little dry/stiff so next time I would probably add a little chicken broth to make it moist.

Great easy recipe.  Used maple syrup b/c I did not have amaretto. Left out the ginger (not usually a big fan) and they were great.  I put my cut up, peeled sweet potatoes in a covered casserole dish for 3.5 min on high, then turned them and put them in again for same amt of time. Then they were perfect for mashing.  I also put a little bit of water in with them when microwaving so they would not get dried out, drained it off before mashing. Worked great! I also did not use almonds b/c I was in a hurry but it would be pretty and I am sure taste great, maybe next time.

Excellent - it was my family's favorite dish at Thanksgiving yesterday.  I baked whole sweet potatoes wrapped in foil in the oven until very soft (90 minutes?), then let them sit on the counter until I was ready for them.  They held the heat very well this way.  I used the maple syrup & couple shakes of ginger & cinnamon each.  I did add just a splash of orange juice.  Outstanding, healthy, easy side dish I'll definitely make again.  Don't forget the almonds! - they are a really nice touch.

I loved the Amaretto in this recipe--I never would have thought to add it to sweet potatoes.  I actually used yams (because that is what I had on hand). I only added 2.5 Tablespoons of Amaretto and then added some brown sugar to accomodate my husband's tastes--although I probably would have liked the full 3 Tablespoons myself.  I boiled the yams rather than microwaving them--for some reason I just felt weird putting them in the microwave!  I'll probably make this very easy recipe again :)

I had a version of this at a wedding reception and went searching for the recipe. Since I had looked for it last minute, I didn't have the Ginger to add to it and my husband hates almonds. They still turned out fantastic without them! Thanks!

Not bad.  I could taste the amaretto and thought it went relatively well with the sweet potato flavor.  Bf didn't notice it at all.  He said he'd prefer plain sweet potatoes instead of any mashed, but he's boring that way.  I didnt use the microwave to bake the sweet potato but put them in the oven for about 40 min or so on 400, then peeled off the skin and mashed.  thanks for the recipe!

Liked the ease of this recipe. Not quite convinced on flavor outcomes though. Playing with a vairety of spices, sugars, etc to change it up. Texture was great.

Perfect!  Baked our potatoes, as had the oven on anyways for the turkey.  These came out with just the right amount of sweetness - my family does not like the traditional sweet potatoe casseroles that look more like a dessert than a side dish.

I used organic maple syrup instead of the almond liquor, and it was delicious! I peeled, chopped and boiled the potatoes then I mashed everything together. Placed in a glass pie dish, covered in the toasted almonds and placed in the oven at 350 for 10 min to bake the top. People who hate sweet potatoes still loved this. Success!

I used 2 large sweet potatoes and microwaved them until soft, and while still hot I held the potato with a pot holder while scooping the potato out, mashed it, added real maple syrup (I'm from New England) cinnamon,  topped with almonds and my guests loved it! Second time I've made this and I tweak it a bit for my own tastes. Very good recipe!
