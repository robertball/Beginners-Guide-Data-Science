This was a great soup!  I'm always looking for vegetarian alternatives for when I have vegetarian guests.  Even my fianc√©, who normally asks for meat on the side with veggie dishes, loved this just by itself.

The only change I had was to cook it on the stovetop over medium-low heat instead of baking.  I would add the cheese just before serving, or even just sprinkle it on top of the soup instead of stiring it in, as it got a little rubbery from cooking for 10 mins.

Also, I'll definately make more next time - the 6 serving recipe was just enough for 3 main dish servings (and that was with 15 ounce cans instead of 8 ounce), and we were wishing we could go back for seconds.

"THE BEST SOUP EVER" i used pinot grigio for the wine as that is the best wine i have ever used to cook, and will ever use, gives it a nice flavor to it, and since i hate having chunk of beans in my soup i pureed the garbanzo beans before adding them, added a nice texture to the soup, more hearty and thick. i served this to my guests and they made it 5 times in one week.

Excellent recipe.  If I had it to make again-and I will-I would reduce the fat by using half and half, and low fat cheeses.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

I modified this recipe to make it low-fat friendly.  I pureed the chickpeas in my food processor and baked as directed.  To finish, I served it with some light sour cream and shredded monterrey jack on the side.  It turned out very good.

I'm a long time allrecipes member and usually agree with consensus opinions on recipes, but my rating will be notch lower than the other reviewers.  As my son described it, "A little bland, if you know what I mean."  Maybe it's because I used white cooking wine instead of dry white wine, but the flavor seemed to be lacking something.  Maybe more garlic, more basil, or additional spices.  Too, the cheese turned a little rubbery in places. Maybe it melted too quickly.  I will try this again some day with modifications.  It looked nice, but the flavor punch was not as good as I expected--particularly for as long as it took to prepare.  ADDENDUM: My wife and I both agreed that after sitting in the refrigerator for a day, this soup tasted better.  So I'm adding another 1/2 point.

This is a delicious and different soup.  It is especially appropriate for Lent, because of its absence of meat.

Quite good! Doesn't make much (about four bowls). It got much thicker as leftovers, so I used it as pasta sauce, which was delicious.

I was very impressed with the way this soup turned out and will definately me making it again. I made the soup in a crockpot rather than baking as directed however and I substituted the dried basil for fresh dill which gave it a nice kick. **Addition to original review. I have made this soup many times since I originally found this recipe two years ago and I must say, it has been a real hit and has easily become one of my favorite winter meals. Best served with french bread, warm out of the oven.

This is an amazing soup--hearty, wholesome, and bursting with flavor. It's in regular rotation in my kitchen. I make it vegan with the following substitutions: 

1) standard sized can of chickpeas and tomatoes (whole, chopped, fresh, crushed...it's all good)
2) water if I don't have white wine (tastes great)
3) Leave out the cheeses and butter--don't even miss them!
4) Sub cashew cream (just cashews blended with water) for the heavy cream--AMAZING!
5) A twist of lemon and some salt and pepper at the end. 

I used some old bread to make some croutons today. Threw them in there...heaven.

Aunt Peg knows what's up.

Excellent! Only did a couple things different: I pressed 2 large cloves of garlic rather than mincing 1 tsp. since we love garlic.  And I added 1/4 t. thyme as that is a fave herb of mine in soups.  We will be making this again and again.

I had such high hopes for this one...it looked so good. Used good quality Pinot Grigio as someone suggested. The soup was a little sour for my taste, and just didn't have the OOMPH I was aiming for. I agree, it did taste better the next day, but still not something I'd make again.

Full of flavor...chickpeas and zucchini are great with the broth.  This is a cheese and basil flavored cream soup.  Very Italian tasting.  My wife ate all of it and I got a couple spoonfuls :)

Perfect! This was an ideal veg supper on a cold November eve along with multigrain bread. It was deluxe! So full of flavour and satisfaction. My husband raved about it while gobbling it up.

I love this recipe.  The one thing I don't like, however, are garbanzo beans, however, so when I make this (which I am about to again), I leave those out.

This is my favorite homemade soup of all time.  I have made it for a potluck before and everyone asked for the recipe (it does not make a huge amount however so if you will be making it for a potluck I would suggest making a couple of batches.)  I make this quite often.  It is very easy. It does take quite a while to bake but it is well worth it.  I freeze it and bring for lunch and reheat in the microwave. Definitely bake this in a medium casserole dish/bowl.  I have never had a problem with the cheese turning "rubbery."  In my opinion it is best to follow this recipe exactly as it is written for the best turnout.  Thank you for sharing.  This will continue to be a staple in my home.

Wow!  This is amazing.  I had to take a picture of it because it was so amazing.  I cooked it stovetop and put the cheese in at the end like others suggested.  I also added a little sour cream on top.  I'm definitely freezing zucchini so we can have this in the winter.  My sister came from Texas to visit and just LOVED it!  Thank you for the great recipe.

This is a delicous soup...definitely a KEEPER!  The only thing I changed was adding a 15 oz can of chopped tomatoes.

This was not a chowder. it was a soup. I would make alot of changes if i make it again. i would not put as many onions (way too many onions). and I would add other types of veggies such as asparagus. it needed more veggie variety. The broth was good. I added more garlic than called for and also pepper and another kind of italian season (i forgot which one). So in summary, I would make again but change several things.

This soup is really delicious, and it's okay to tinker with the proportions a bit. I use a lot more than the suggested amount of zucchini for example. It's pretty time consuming to make so double or triple up on the ingredients to make it worth your time. I also puree it to get a nice creamy soup rather than a chunky-creamy soup.
