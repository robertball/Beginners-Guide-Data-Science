Although I love curry, I decided to make this without the curry, with a combination of fresh lemon and fresh lime juice and with a little less sugar.  Fabulous recipe!  I would have never thought to put sugar in with the lemon juice!

Okay, this was pretty darn amazing! I'm house sitting right now and trying to just use food that's in the fridge/pantry/freezer to make meals and noticed I had some chicken breasts and large bottle of lemon juice. So why not make some lemon chicken? I found this recipe and thought it looked yummy, so I gave it a try. IT WAS AMAZING!!! I did make a few changes to the sauce though. I reduced the amount of sugar to about 3 tbs, took out the curry entirely, added 2 tbs of corn starch, 1/8 cup of water, 1/8 tsp ground mustard, 1/2 tbs of paprika and 1 tsp cayenne pepper to give it a little heat! I invited some friends over to eat with me and the chicken was gone in a FLASH! I'm printing this out and it's going in my recipe book for sure!

These were very tasty.  And a different way to have chicken.  I made the following changes.  I used panko bread crumbs and seasoned them with some italian seasoning.  For the sauce I didn't have any curry so I added some dry mustard powder.  I also thickened the sauce with cornstarch.  It was very good.  Nexttime I may add some capers to the sauce as suggested by POLLERHOLLER16.  I even used the sauce with steamed broccoli.  Thanks for the great recipe J.

Way too sweet for me.  The lemon sauce made my teeth hurt!  My husband and kids seemed to like it though.  In the future I might reduce the amount of sugar and lemon juice or add some water to tame the sauce a little.

I have to rate a 3 because even though my husband and I thought they were pretty good, the kids did not like the sauce on the chicken.  We also thought the sauce was a little too sweet, so I think I would cut the sugar down next time.

made the recipe with suggested changes reduced sugar a bit and used corn starch to thicken.. was ok not as great as i thought it would be, probably missing the fat from not frying the chicken. but pretty good if you're eating healthy would taste best on a salad i think. Nice change for breaded chicken though.

What a unique flavor.  Curry is something that I don't cook with very much, but really enjoyed in this recipe.  The chicken came out very tender and juicy.  We will surely be using this recipe again.

Not horrible, but tastes like I poured lemonade on top of chicken.  It was sooo sweet, and I only put in half of the sugar that the recipe called for.  The curry was a bit too much as well.  I won't make this one again.

The basic recipe for the chicken was good.  The lemon curry sauce was decent, but I think next time i'll either go with more lemon or more curry.

My husband is west indian and loves curry but i dont make it for him very often. These tenders turned out great and the curry added to the flavour of the sauce. Based on everyone's reviews, i reduced the sugar and thickened the sauce. It was delicious. I love that the chicken did not need to be fried in oil. My kids loved it and my husband asked me to make this again. Oh by the way, i had alot left over so decided to make lemon tender wraps the next day. A small amount of lettuce mayo, bean sprouts and diced tomatoe, and wow my family loved them.

It was good, but I did like the other reviews said and used less sugar... a lot less... and instead of bread crumbs I used crushed up cornflakes.  Also, for the sauce I just kept it on the side rather than put it on top.

Thank you for posting this recipe!  I used it as a starting point.  Instead of curry I put garlic and rosemary with the lemon, and we used it as a dipping sauce instead of adding it during cooking.

My family really liked this one - here's what I changed: reduced to 3 servings, used one egg mixed with some water, used about 1/4 cup lemon juice and only a tablespoon of sugar, then about 1/2 teaspoon dried mustard. The chicken was delicious and very tender, but one taster said she wished it was crispier - next time I'll broil it for a bit to crisp up the outside. Also pairs very well with Asparagus Tossed Salad from this site.

This recipe was great!! I've been looking for a good lemon chicken recipe; most times the sauce I make doesn't have much flavor, but the flavor of this one was great.  A good balance, not too sweet or sour, and the curry gives it an excellent flavor. I like that you bake the chicken instead of fry it, a healthier choice. I served it over rice & with some broccoli.

I did change the recipe. Not the sauce. I used boneless chicken breast,and beat them out a bit. Then I continued the breading process with a egg-milk mixture and bread crumbs I made from left over crossants. To the bread crumbs I add lemon pepper, garlic, salt and pepper and paprika. I rolled each breast around a thick slice of Montery Jack Cheese. I baked this until chicken was done then poured on the lemon sauce - the curry and added chile powder instead. (because I didn't have any curry) It was the best lemon chicken I had ever made. Fancy enough for guest and simple enough for family. Thank you.

Easy, tasty. The curry is just enough to add interest to the sauce. Unlike the previous reviewer, I prepared the recipe as is the first time to write an accurate review. Liked it so much made it again within the week and just thickened the sauce with flour/water and served over rice. MMMMMMMM!

I thought this was rather sweet, and I had already reduced the sugar in the lemon sauce by half. Maybe if the sugar was reduced to a few tablespoons it would be better.

My husband loved this! He thought it was the best chicken I've EVER made before! I left out the curry, just because I didn't have any on hand, and I am not a lemon person, so I only used half the lemon and sugar mixture. It was still really good!

Good recipe, but I made a few adjustments. I used chicken tenders, so I didn't have to cut the chicken into strips. I left out the curry in the lemon drizzle and only made half of that dressing. I took another reviewer's recipe and only drizzled some of the lemon mixture over the chicken and not drenching them.

My two children loved this.  It is a great way to avoid frying chicken.  Next time I want to try it with fresh lemon juice (I used bottled) to avoid that lemonade flavor.  I did use cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  I think the sauce did need to be thickened.

I would actually give this recipe about 4.5 stars.  It was an excellent base but I made some adjustments. For the chicken, I would recommend frying it lightly on a pan over baking just because you get a crispier coating. For the sauce (because I don't like curry) I omitted the curry.  I added the juice of 2.5 lemons and about 1/3 cup sugar.  I also added 1 heaping tsp of corn/potato starch to cold water and added that to the sauce to thicken.  I poured the sauce over the chicken and sprinkled toasted sesame seeds.  It was superb and there were no leftovers to dream of.

I found these to be "okay", I thought the curry was a little overwhelming; I would try them again for myself with less curry, but my bf did not care for them.

I followed this recipe exactly and found it very easy to make. My husband and I both loved it! I will make extra lemon sauce next time for dipping. I gave it four out of five stars only because my kids didn't like it (they are very picky!).

This was super easy. The chicken came out very moist at 15 minutes. I was afraid of making the sauce too sweet or too sour so I changed it like this:

1/4 sugar
1/2 cup lime juice
1 tbsp butter

The key is DRIZZLE. DRIZZLE, put the rest in a gravy boat. It came out sweet and savory and complimented the chicken really well.

This recipe was not as good as I expected.  The lemon flavor was way to strong although I was really surprised that I enjoyed the way the chicken was cooked.  Definitely will not make this again.

Chicken is good, but we didn't like the sauce. Just ended up eating the chicken alone.

I made this tonight. I did a few things different and I thought it came out good. I used chicken cutlets instead of tenders....I floured and pan fried the chicken instead of using breadcrumbs and baking. For the sauce I used freshed squeezed lemons and half the amount of sugar. I also seasoned the chicken. Didn't use curry because I didnt have any. Would definitely make again.

Overall and easy and good dish. Next time, I would reduce the amount of curry as it was a little overpowering. Also, I used cornstarch to thicken the sauce which made it a nice consistency as aa glaze or even for dipping.   I would make again.

These were a hit with my family, although I sort of doused the tenders with the lemon sauce, which I don't recommend!  My husband really loved these.

Delicious!  I cut the sugar in the sauce down to 1/4 cup and it had just the right amount of sweet.  I'm not a big curry fan so I used 1 tsp garlic powder and 1/2 tsp rosemary as suggested by another reviewer.  It was excellent and even my very picky husband enjoyed it!

Very good! I was a bit nervous about the sauce because by itself it is VERY sweet but once it was on the chicken it was wonderful. The combination of the seasonings on the chicken and the sweet sauce was a pleasant surprise. The only thing I did different was that I used garlic powder and I also spinkled the seasonings on top of the chicken after they were breaded. I also thickened the sauce a little with 1 tbsp cornstarch and 1 tblsp cold water.

Good recipe but definitely needs some tweaking. I added 1/4 cup parmigiana cheese to the bread crumbs which added a nice flavor . I also floured the chicken before dipping, much better adhesion. Also too much sugar in the recipe, so decreased to 1/4 cup, added 1/2 cup low sodium chicken broth with 1/2 cup lemon juice and 1 tsp butter. Thickened with a bit of cornstarch. All loved  it.

I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of decreasing the sugar and curry as was recommended from other reviewers. The chicken turned out rubbery and the mix of flavors was pretty much disgusting. 

Yuk!

The sauce wasn't thickening after about 10 minutes of simmering, so I made a slurry using more lemon juice and cornstarch and stirred it into the hot sauce. It thickened up nicely and we enjoyed this dish a lot. I put the sauce on some sautée spinach and it was DELISH.

This was really delicious and my family and I loved it.  The only thing I would do next time is I think I will leave the chicken whole and not cut it up into chunks and I will make extra sauce for dipping.  Definitely a keeper!!!

I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but I don't think that I did. My tenders did not turn out as I would have expected them to. The breading never crisped up or browned and left me wishing I would have pan fried them. I really did not like this dish because of that.

Made this as it first, but after tasting the lemon mixture way to much sugar for our taste. Runny too. So I added more lemon juice and some flour. After that it was good. I suggest cutting down the sugar to 1/4 a cup or less

My family liked this a lot.  I followed the suggestions and used less sugar and I just heated the sauce in the microwave in the glass measuring cup that I measured the lemon juice in.  I also cut the chicken breasts into small pieces before I dipped them and served the chicken and sauce over rice.  I have a 16-year-old with a hollow leg and I try and make all my recipes stretch with this technique.  I used dry mustard rather than curry just because I didn't have any and other reviewers said it was OK to do this.  Thank you for the great recipe. Wonderful flavor and something different for us.

This was a very good alternative to Chinese food. The only change that needs to be made is cut the sugar WAY down. I used half the amount and it was still sweet. I also skipped the curry and used the dry mustard and paprika like someone else suggested.

I really loved this meal as did my roomates.  However if you don't like spicey it may not be for you.  The lemon sauce was very tangy and delightful you don't need to add alot to give the strips flavor.  I had enough left over for other chicken meals I created.  My two male roomates really approved of it too!

Kids didn't care for the sauce and thought the tenders were a bit too spicy with the paprika. Based on other reviews, I didn't cook the sauce with the chicken and served as a side for dipping- then you can use as much or as little as you want.

I did not follow the recipe directly, I cut down the sugar and added some cornstarch as others had suggested. I also made it with real chicken and fake soy chicken (i'm vegetarian, my husband is not). We both agreed it wasn't bad (not too sweet) but that it was missing some sort of flavor. I will try making it again, but I will mess around with the flavoring, almost needs some spice to it.

I was expecting a better flavor breading after reading the reviews. The taste must really be in the sauce, which I didn't make (I was feeding my kids, who like everything with ketchup). However, the chicken was nearly gone at the end of the meal, so I'm giving it 3 stars.

These chicken tenders were good.  I used panko breadcrumbs and only 1/3 cup sugar based on other reviewers' comments about the sweetness of the sauce.  It was plenty sweet with just the 1/3 cup sugar.  Use freshly squeezed lemon juice, not the stuff in those yellow plastic containers.  It makes all the difference in the world.  The combination of lemon and curry was unique.

Flavor to the max!!! Excellent dish. My son and I loved this and had seconds, my husband didn't (but he doesn't like sweet chicken). I used hot madras (yellow) curry powder. I doubled this sauce and glad I did. I did cook the sauce about twice as long on the stovetop. Healthier too because it's oven baked. Thanks for a great recipe!

I thought this was an unusual combination of flavors. My husband really liked it but the kids didn't. I thought it was good, and will give it four stars. I will make again because it's easy and looks complicated. I did hold back a little on the sugar, and used a tablespoon of cornstarch in the sauce to thicken it before pouring over the chicken. I also broiled the chicken the last few minutes after pouring the sauce on. I would like to make again and use panko bread crumbs (I just used Progresso bread crumbs because that is what I had on hand). Thank you for the recipe.

Omitted the curry powder as I am not very fond of curry, and found these to be a little bit of a bore without it. Delicious, although not very flavourful, however they were a nice change as opposed to plain chicken fingers. The curry powder does give it a little more something that it needs however, as I discovered making it second time around, serve with a green salad for best results.

Way too lemony for my taste (and that of family).  I liked the overall flavor, but will tone down the lemon next time.  More sugar might make it too sweet though.

Very nice sweet/lemon-y flavor. These are very tasty. A little bit time consuming, but still very good. Would also double well as a main dish with fried rice.

Very easy to make, and delicious!  I left the lemon sauce on the side as a dip.  I also steamed brocolli for a side dish and drizzled the brocolli with the sauce too.  Yum!  I may just make the sauce for when we have steamed brocolli in the future.

This was really good.  Husband made it mostly.  But really tasty.  Only thing we would do differently next time is with the paprika, salt & pepper, it would be easier to mix it through the breadcrumbs.  Shouldn't make much difference.  It will save the paprika sticking all on the one sort of area on each piece of chicken though.  You really need to sprinkly carefully!  lol

Big hit in my house!  I too fried up the chicken dredged in flour, and then I used Corn bread stuffing for the topping, then baked.  Really good.

This is delicious. My family loves it, and I love that I can make it quickly when I get home from work.  I will say it takes me at least 15-20 minutes to prep it and at least 30 minutes to cook it, so don't count on it being done in 35 minutes, but other than that, I totally recommend it. The only thing I do a bit differently is to put the salt, pepper and paprika in with the bread crumbs. It saves a step, and the spices don't come off in the egg wash.

I enjoyed the dish I wish that i had noticed the suggested changes to reduce the sweetness but beyond that I think it went over well for dinner. It goes well with rice and asparagus.

This was easy to make, but the flavors didn't mesh... something about the sweetness with the lemon with the curry that my family really didn't enjoy.  We did eat them, but probably wouldn't make them again.

I made this for dinner last night and a friend (who is a food fanatic) he was in heaven! He's a sauce guy, so the lemon sugar sauce on top of the chicken had him asking for seconds! As for the overall recipe i added and omitted a few things. I used plain panko bread crumbs and added some lemon pepper seasoning to it, enough that i could see the pepper evenly dispersed throughout. For the sauce, I also omitted the curry, but added lemon zest to have a more intense lemon flavor. I served it with steamed broccoli florets, an oven baked hasselback baked potato basted in a butter lemon garlic and rosemary sauce (look it up its divine!!!) and covered in the usual baked potato dressings (sour cream, parsley, bacon bits for him). That meal was "catch a man food" for sure! Lol

Too lemony (I used fresh lemons) and way too much curry. My son said it was like a sour lemon candy melted all over the chicken - he wouldn't eat it. Toddler wouldn't touch it either - she actually cried, lol.

The Italian spices clashed hard with the curry. It wasn't awful, and it got tolerable after a few bites.. but this is not something I'll be making again. The sauce needs a base that isn't quite so strong, and the Italian bread crumbs probably isn't the best choice for a baked (rather than fried) breaded chicken dish.

I made the recipe exactly how it is written. My husband and I agreed that while it was good, the sauce/glaze was entirely too sweet. I will try this again sometime but I will definitely reduce the amount of sugar and might add some lime juice as well.

I mixed the seasonings with the eggs, and floured the chicken before dredging.  Coating stuck much better during baking.

Awesome and easy! I didn't have paprika so I unsed cajun spice and no salt but 1/4 tsp of pepper. Also, I used a aluminum foil lined cookie sheet. It was delicious and even my 13-month old liked them!

I like the flavor combinations in this recipe. However, during I think 1 cup of sugar is too much for its equivalent of 1 cup of lemon juice. Now that i think about its lemonaid. So next time i will be certainly careful about how i "make this lemonaid."

Should be called "sweet curried chicken tenders." I love curry, but this was too much curry. Or else my teaspoon measure is faulty, because I don't see that complaint echoed in the other reviews. The sauce is sweet yet bitter - something is just off in the ingredient proportions. Also, next time I would double the amount of sauce, because there wasn't any extra, just enough to cover the chicken. I made this with rice and it would have been nice to have extra sauce to soak up. The chicken itself turned out very tender and moist. The breadcrumbs are a good idea. This is easy and quick, too. I might make it again but would have to experiment with the sauce ingredients. oddly, my husband loved this.

Exactly what I was looking for tonight!  Wanted a way to use my chicken tenders in a breaded manner.  The Lemon sauce was just perfect as my wife and I can't get enough of lemon flavored dishes.  Very easy and fairly quick to prepare.

This recipe was easy and pretty good!  I prepared the chicken similar to the recipe.  (I used egg beaters, italian seasoning with no cheese, and variations on the spices)  As other reviewers suggested, I halved the amount of sugar in the sauce.  I also used a combination of concentrated lime juice and fresh lemon juice, and a bit of spicy orange sauce.  It was a hit& everyone loved it.  Thanks!

There was WAY too much sauce and it was very sweet. I actually barely drizzled any on half of them since I was afraid that the kids wouldn't eat it. I was right. I was the only one that didn't mind the sauce as much, but it was a bit much even for me. I think that it could be great with some tweaking but I am not up to that!! Thanks for a new idea though!!

I love this recipe, but I have to agree with the other reviews it is way too sweet, next time I will only add a few tablespoons of sugar. Other than than it was a great idea the lemon juice and curry was very tasty, maybe I will add capers like one suggested, I also used panko bread crums and milk to dip the chicken in instead.

Tenders was good but sauce was a little weird.  Too much curry and a little too sweet.  Might try removing the curry and going with some garlic.

Unfortunately, I didn't read the other reviews prior to preparing this dish.  I agree with the criticisms about the excessive amount of sugar.  It is entirely too sweet for my taste.  I doubt I will make this again.  Sorry.

Really good and easy. I used bone-in breasts and cooked them for 40 min. at 350, drizzling the glaze for the last 5 minutes of cooking. Cut down the sugar to 1/4 cup and it was just right. Very tender, juicy and a very nice flavor. This is a keeper.

This was a big hit at our house. I tried to go just by the recipe; the only change was an accident. Somehow I ran out of bread crumbs with half the chicken pieces still to be rolled, so I made up another batch of crumbs. (I don't know what "Italian bread crumbs" are exactly, so I just made bread crumbs in the blender and added basil, garlic and oregano.) I am guessing that people who feel that this recipe was too dry are the same people who left out or reduced the amount of the lemon glaze. It moistened things up nicely and, while an unusual flavor for a chicken entree, was really quite good. This one's a keeper, and I thank J. Roderick for submitting it.

I'm sorry, I really wanted to like this. It just didn't work for me. I may make this again without breading the Chicken. Or frying instead of baking. It was just way too dry for my Taste and not enough Flavor to it. I may also skip the Curry next time.

I made half with the lemon sauce and half without and had to throw out the ones that had the sauce because no one in my family would eat them. The tenders were good but the sauce was WAY too sweet.

My family LOVED this recipe and my husband went back for seconds.  It's so easy.  We didn't use all the sauce, just spooned on enough to cover the chicken tender - cutting down on the sweetness, and it was perfect!

But i went and made it anyway and it was an amazing choice! i don't eat chicken but i made it for my family and they LOVED it!! i make it all the time for them. the only change i made to the recipe was to add less sugar. GREAT recipe, thanks!

It was alright, but would have been better if the tenders had been fried and the sauce wasn't so sweet.  I decreased the sugar as suggested in previous reviews, but it was still too sweet for my tastes.

These were quite good, and quick and easy, too. I cut the sugar to 1 Tb and 1 tp. It made for a very tangy but delicious sauce. My husband liked it and suggested that I use a different spice (not curry) in the sauce next time for a change.

I really enjoyed this recipe. My husband really liked the chicken, but thought the sauce was too sweet. I will definatly make the recipe again, but I will be cutting down on the sugar and adding more curry. (We're huge curry fans.) My daughter ate the chicken which shocked me becuase she's been going through a stubborn streak about all food. We didn't even attempt the sauce. We will be making the chicken a lot, even without the sauce. Thanks for the recipe.

The chicken was good on its own. I made the sauce according to the reecipe and like the others found it too sweet. I played around and still felt that it was missing something. Either way it was too sour or too sweet. I won't make this recipe again.

I doubled the sauce part thinking I wanted some left over to dip the strips... but the sauce is quite lemony and it's better with the amount that you just put on it for cooking. My husband liked these a lot and I will make them again. (served them with scalloped potatoes and mixed veggies).

I followed the recipe but it was pretty lemony.  I would have rather not drizzled them in the sauce but use it as a dipping sauce. Will not use again.

I thought this was pretty good! I cut down the sugar by half based on other reviews. I'm really glad I did or else it would've been way too sweet. Instead of making chicken tenders I used whole chicken breasts pounded flat and poured the sauce over it. It was great!

This is very, very good exactly as written.  (However, I did not cut the chicken into "tenders".)  My husband and picky children all loved it.  This is a company-quality meal that is light and easy enough to make mid-week.  Serve it with white rice and a plain green veggie or salad.  Yummy!!

Soooo good!  I only used about 2 tbs of sugar and it was great.  The sauce is very strong, but wonderful.  I left half plain for the children.  I also used Panko instead and they were very crispy and delicious.  A new favorite for all.

I used a 1 lb. package of chicken tenders so I didn't have to slice the chicken breasts. The tenders were good, but I didn't care for the sauce. Too sweet, and too much curry flavor.

De-LISH!  Nice lemony flavor, not too overpowering.  Will definitely make this dish again and again!

The chicken came out moist and delicious.  The paprika was a bit overpowering, so I will reduce it in the future.  Also, lacking Italian bread crumbs, I used 1/2c of plain breadcrumbs mixed in with 1/2c cornmeal and added some dried oregano and basil as well as garlic and onion powder.  I used just under 1/2c of lemon juice too.  Turned out swell.

We truly enjoyed this dish, with just one minor change. I subbed Panko crumbs for the breadcrumbs, seasoning them generously with Italian seasoning and lots of garlic powder. We loved the texture of the Panko. YUM!!! Thanks, J Roderick... I'd make this recipe again.

I gave this recipe a try and was suprised just how good it was.  It's a simple dish but no one will know based on how much flavor there is.  I put the chicken over a fine salad.  The lemon sauce makes a great dressing for the salad too!

Big hit with some guests. To make it healthier, I marinated the chicken strips in yogurt and then breaded (no need for egg) and I cut the sugar in the sauce to 1/8 of a cup. Two breasts fed 4 people easily with some leftovers.

I was in a dinner-time crunch and already had spaghetti noodles boiling and chicken tenders cooking on the stove, so I made the lemon-curry sauce and poured it over the chicken for the last few minutes of cooking.  I then removed the chicken and added 2 tsp. corn starch to the sauce to thicken and then poured it over the pasta and added the chicken.  It was fabulous!!  Will definitely try the full recipe soon.

This was pretty good, but the sauce could have been thicker.  I think next time I make this, I'll add some cornstarch dissolved in water to thicken it.

Wow!  What a great recipe!  It was so easy and really tasty!  The only things I did differently than the recipe was to sub Peppridge Farms herb stuffing (that I put in the blender to make crumbs) since I didn't have the Italian bread crumbs and to spray the pan liberally with cooking spray and then again after putting the chicken fingers on it to make sure it crisped up nicely.  My husband and I fought over the last piece because it was so good!  Will definitely make again!

We loved this recipe!  I wasn't sure how the sauce would taste over the chicken, but it was the perfect compliment.  Our local store often runs specials on chicken breast tenders, so I didn't even need to cut up any breasts.  Loved that it really only took 30 mins (start to finish) and was able to whip up a few sides while it was in the oven!  We follow a diabetic diet so it was no problem exchanging the sugar with Splenda.  Healthy and Delicious!

And made brussel sprouts and cabbage with rice and used the same mixture on the rice and the brussel sprouts

I read the reviews before making this dish and only used half of the sugar. It was still super sweet. Probably only needed an 1/8 C sugar. I think honey would also be a nice substitute. Everyone liked it, but I thought the sweetness was a little much. Very yummy though! I will probably make this again.

Only change I made was cutting the curry powder. I've never cooked with it soo didn't want to chance ruining the flavor. I call this lemonade chicken & my kids love this dish. It's everyone's favorite. I sometimes use olive oil instead of eggs and I boil up some bow tie pasta put it in the bottom of my Pyrex dish and add the sauce before I place in the oven @350 for 40 minutes

I had to make this gluten free and sugar free. I substituted erythritol for the sugar and use very finely shredded (macaroon) unsweetened coconut for the bread crumbs. Because my husband hates curry I left that out but I am sure I would love it.

Although my husband thought it was ok I did not care for the sauce.  I did add corn starch to thicken it and cut the sugar to 3 tablespoons but would probably cut it even more. I also added some shallots.

I will definitely make this again. My family loved it. I served with ranch dressing as a dip. 
The only thing: I had to bake it an extra 12 minutes. I baked in pyrex at 400 and covered in foil. After the first 15 minutes, it wasn't even close to being done. I applied the lemon juice/sugar glaze and cooked an additional 17 minutes uncovered. Very moist and tasty.

Excellent recipe, however I found that it was just a tad too sweet with the curry and the 1/2 cup of sugar. Fortunately I prepared this to go alongside some yellow squash and rice which evened it out, and paired the whole thing with a Sauvignon Blanc that complimented excellently. Next time I may use less sugar is I include the curry. Nicely done!

Loved these chicken tenders.  I followed the recipe exactly but reduced the sugar slightly.  The flavours mixed very nicely.  Teenage son said they were dee-lish.

I just made this for dinner and it was delicious. I was out of curry so used garam masala, which was very tasty, and used panko instead of regular bread crumbs. Did I say it was delicious? It's all gone!

I plan to use this chicken in future ceasar salads. It was such an interesting combination of flavours. I only added about half of the sugar required, water, and rosemary. Once everything was prepped it took no time at all to cook!  It is worth trying.

Loved it! Easy to make. I like many others, I reduced the sugar and added a bit more curry because my family loves curry. Thanks, AMAZING!

Curry was the most predominant flavor in this for me. Luckily, I love curry! It had a nice sweetness to it. I'd add a little more lemon and cut back on the curry slightly next time.

This is amazing. I'd been looking for a new way to cook chicken and this is it. Only changed I made was I used 1/4 cup of sugar only because the consensus was the sauce was too sweet and even with 1/4 cup of sugar it was still a little sweet.

These turned out very tasty! I did as others suggested and I used a LOT less sugar - about 3 tbs. I also added some paprika to the lemon sauce, and some red pepper flakes for some kicks! :) after the last 5 minutes of cooking, they were perfect! so tender and juicy! I will definitely make these again!

I gave this 3 stars for the fact that it starts out with what are originally edible materials. After looking through the reviews I decided to try NomNomDelicious's sauce suggestions minus the paprika and cayenne b/c my kids don't like spicy. What I was left with was lemon meringue pie filling, so I added the paprika and curry powder to try and make it more savory. Then it was extremely bitter lemon meringue pie filling, so I thinned it out and added it on the chicken as suggested; hoping it would magically change in the 5 min. in the oven; Nope. The chicken by itself came out very tender and juicy and the breading was good too.

Made this dinner tonight & my DH thought it was too lemony & too sweet. I'll have to cut down on both next time. He said next time to add some chicken broth when making it, & will make it again.

This was really good actually!  I initially cut back the sugar to half the amount as suggested by other reviewers and then tested it and decided to add in about a tablespoon or so more. I actually think that next time I will make two batches of the sauce -- one to pour over the chicken to bake in and another batch to pour over the chicken and rice served on the plate.

We had a similar dish at a Chinese restaurant that we could never forget...and now we can recreate it at home! We used less sugar (rather, Splenda), Panko bread crumbs, mustard instead of curry, and cornstarch to thicken the sauce. This time I'll try curry!

This was pretty good; I had no leftovers and that's a good thing! :) I was worried that my kids wouldn't like the curry in the lemon/sugar sauce, but I don't even think they noticed. Interesting. I'll probably try again, but increase spices a bit I couldn't really taste it too much. Thank you for the recipe!

Not a favorite.  Way too sweet.  The sauce tasted like one of those cold and flu drinks to me.  The chicken alone was yummy.

Im not a pro chef but I know that nearly choking meant there was too much of somethings and not enough of others-the flavors were out of balance but the concept sounded good. I redid the sauce with a little bit of water and mixed the lemon juice , sugar, and curry to taste. Then added a pinch of flour for thickening. It turned out so much better.

This was amazing.  My husband even liked it! (and he is picky about new things)  I didn't have curry powder so I used my homemade version (red pepper, garlic powder, cumin, coriander, mustard seed) and fried the tenders instead of baking them.  I will definitely keep this in My Recipe Box to use again!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I really like this recipe.  The lemon sauce has a very unusual flavor.  Like others, I cut the amount of sugar.  I play with the amount I use each time. I pair with cous cous.  Yummy!

yummy, but it was so messy to make!  i dried the chicken like was recommended and i sprayed the nuggets with PAM before i put them in the oven, it came out A-OK.  next time, i would have two bowls for the breading because it became a soggy mess at the end.  in terms of the sauce, i used half the sugar, no curry, 1/8tsp paprika and 1/8tsp ground mustard.  it was good but i would use more sugar next time.  husband liked it and i'll make it again.

I use the recipe for the breading but omit the lemon sauce. It seems like a weird combination. The breading is really great, though.

A little dry. I kept the curry in; tasted like sweet & sour sauce (yum!). Probably would be better (and less healthy!) to use wings/other chicken parts. Enjoyed it!

If you have a  sweet tooth this sauce is SWEET! Tastes like liquified lemon lollipop and my toddler twins really liked it. I dissolved a tsp of cornstarch to about 1/4 cup water before adding it to the lemon sugar mix to make it more like the chinese restaurant style lemon sauce. Felt like i made candied chicken.

yummy, even the kids liked it.  Make sure all the chicken is covered with the sauce.  Without it, the "tender" gets tough and dry.

Made this tonight for my family for the first time and everyone, even my picky kiddies loved it.  The only thing I did not use was Curry as I did not have any available.  Otherwise followed the recipe and was very happy with it.  Great for a quick meal.

The mixture of flavors in this dish are just weird. I didn't enjoy it at all. Luckily I only did half the pan with the curry mixture. The other half I melted some butter and mixed it with lemon juice and drizzled that over the chicken. The result was much much tastier then the lemon, sugar, curry sauce.

The first few bites were heaven then the lemon started to get too strong because I only used 1/4 cup of sugar.  Next time I will use 1/3 cup of sugar instead.  I also used Italian bread crumbs as well as a panko.  It goes excellent with rice!

Very easy fast recipe I would double dip in the egg then bread crumbs and do it a second time so that the batter sticks better. I used plain bread crumbs & added basil & orgeano as this is what I had on hand. I didn't have curry so I used cumin & red pepper. It was very tasty.

I was real excited to try this recipe.  But, I think it would have agreed with my family if I did not use the lemon sauce.  None of my three children liked it and my husband thought it had a weird taste.  So, I will definately use every thing else, just not the lemon sauce.

Overall, they weren't too bad, but nothing out of this world.  My kids did not care for the sauce at all, even though I cut the sugar down.  The sauce was way too thin, so I would definitely add some cornstarch.  I didn't the sauce tasted too bad, but it was just runny and not at all appetizing.  The coating on the chicken tenders themselves was okay, but too spicy for my children.

This recipe is tasty. I didn't have lemon juice, so I had to substitute with lime juice, but to cut the sharp taste I diluted it a little bit with water...still came out nice.

I made these hoping my two year old daughter (who is currently on a strike against meat) would eat them.  They were very easy to make, and I really liked the flavour.....not too sweet for me!  Turns out she ate quite a few bites (dipped in honey, yet!), so I was happy.  I omitted the curry for her, and I didn't have fresh lemons which would make it even more mouth-puckering good, but it was still very tasty, and super tender.

These were okay--I followed some reviewers' suggestions and added cornstarch to the sauce, as it was VERY thin. It got a little too sticky. Also, it was very overwhelming in flavor--too lemony and sweet. Otherwise, a nice change from our regular breaded chicken. With a few changes, this could be a good recipe.

I really like this chicken - true to what it says it was quick and easy, and I didn't have to run to the store for any of the ingredients!  It was tart and sweet and had good flavor.  My husband ate all of his and thought it was really tasty.  Too bad my four year old wasn't thrilled (he's very picky though - he doesn't even like macaroni & cheese so you can't really go by him.)  I will be making this again.

I must say, I'm pretty baffled on this one considering all of the good reviews.  I didn't like the sauce at all--I think it was the curry that threw it off for me.  Nobody in the house could manage to eat it so we made a frozen pizza instead.

Yummy curry and lemon and sweetness...however, much too sweet for me. 1/3 a cup sugar would be just fine, maybe less. The strength of the lemon taste was great. I'll make this again with less sugar. It was really good.

My family really liked this recipe.  It was a little tart for me so I started adding 1/4 cup honey and we all like it better. I have made it almost once a week since trying.  My 10-year old (very picky) ask for it when I ask what kind of chicken he wants for dinner.

This was a very quick and easy meal to prepare and the chicken was tender, however, the sauce made the dish very sweet.  My sister-in-law loved it, but the rest of us (including the kids) found it a bit too sweet.  A good recipe if you like sweet/savoury foods.

This is awesome! One time when we weren't in the mood for the lemon sauce, I followed the recipe to that point, and then spread petite diced tomatoes and some Italian seasoning over the chicken for the last 5 minutes. Voila! Chicken parmesan without the butter! It's delicious.

Decided to give this recipe a try for something different. With some minor "tweaks" it turned out great. I only used about 1/4 cup of sugar, 3/4 cup of lemon juice, about 1/4 cup of water and a little bit of cornstarch. Also since my wife has an egg allergy I thought I would try rubbing a little honey over the strips before breading. I wasn't quite sure what to expect but everyone enjoyed it. Serve with some rice and veggies like another member posted.. makes a great meal.

i cut down on the sugar, using about 1/4 of a cup, because i thought 1/2 a cup would be overpowering. turns out it could have used the full 1/2 cup the recipe called for. despite that, my husband said this was "a keeper," and he rarely likes chicken. ETA: for the sauce, i combined the ingredients and microwaved for 30 seconds rather than using the saucepan method. it worked pretty well.

I liked it as is. The curry works well with the lemon. The only thing I added was corn starch to thicken the sauce.

I made this last night for dinner, and after reading the reviews, thought it would be excellent. I really did not enjoy this. It had a very odd taste and the curry just did not help at all. The sugary lemon made a wierd flavor at all. I will not be making this again.

Quick, easy, yummy and different.  This was a great recipe.  I didn't change a thing and it was a really nice change of pace from plain old chicken tenders.  As a nice bonus my 2 and 5 year olds loved it.  I served it with rice and tomato salad.

Very yummy twist on chicken! I reduced the sugar, but was left with an overwhelming taste of lemon (my fault).  Still loved it though!  Can't wait to try with the recommended amounts  :)

My husband and I really love this recipe!  It's fairly easy and I love the curry smell, but I don't think it's the sort of thing that everyone would like.  The sauce is very strong and sweet.  But if you're not sure that everyone will like the strong lemon flavor, you can make some with the sauce and some without.  The breaded chicken is still good without the sauce (although a little boring for me).  The only problem I have with this recipe is that the aluminum foil lining the pan tends to tear when I'm turning the chicken.  I recommend using heavy-duty foil or none at all.  I also use egg substitute to make this recipe slightly healthier.

Very tasty! My suggestion is to put less sugar in (I put a 1/4 cup) and add some honey and real lemon slices to the sauce while it heats up!

Perfect directions for cooking the chicken.  Came out cooked through but moist.

Wasn't crazy about the sauce, will probably do something else next time, but I give it 5 stars just for the breading&cooking directions!

Like it because it had lots of lemon flavor, but I think hubby thought it was too strong. He added coconut milk to his.  Maybe thicken sauce for  dipping rather than coating the tenders.

These were great!  I made them exactly as specified in the recipe, with the only exception being that I had the oven a little cooler than specified because I was also roasting some potatoes to go with them.  I whipped up a little honey mustard sauce to dunk them in, and served them with the potatoes and some steamed carrots for a great meal.  These will certainly be made again here - thanks for a great recipe!

This was a really easy recipe. I made some changes. I added the spices to the bread crumbs to make it easier. I cooked for 15mins. I started to drizzle the sauce over the chicken. But I still had a lot of sauces left. So instead of drizzling it over the chicken. I dunk the chicken into the sauce. Cooked for another 5mins. I had a little bit of sauce left for dipping. The chicken turned out great!

I think kids would enjoy this for the fun and the flavor. This would make a good take-along for playdates in the park. I like this because it's not fried. And the sauce is actually pretty tasty.

Pretty good for a 'chicken finger' type recipe that isn't fried.  The sauce is a nice variation on sweet & sour with the added curry.

Pretty good.  Nice lemony flavour, definitely tastes a lot healthier than normal chicken tenders.
