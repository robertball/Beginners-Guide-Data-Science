These were an instant favorite. I used juice from the zested orange instead of the liqueur and drizzled white and semisweet chocolate over the finished biscotti. Baking these on parchment paper, especially the first baking, made for a much easier transfer to the cooling rack. Absolutely delicious!

This was the easiest biscotti I have ever made!  I always cook on a stone, and with the even distribution of heat, the cookies came out simply perfect!  I did sub. orange juice for the liquor and made 1 batch with double cranberries instead of nuts - due to allergies.  Overall, they were AMAZING!

I've made this recipe twice now and they turned out wonderful both times, the only difference was the choice of orange liquor.  The first time I made them I used Triple Sec and the second time I made them I used Grand Marnier.  The batch with the Grand Marnier was superior by far.  When I make these again I will bake sure to use the Grand Marnier.

Excellent, excellent, excellent.  This was my first attempt at Biscotti and they were wonderful!  I used the juice from the orange I zested instead of the orange liqueur and it worked out great!  I did use a little extra cinnimon, but that is just how I like it :)  I will definitely make them again and again!

I thought these were absolutely delicious. I love the combination of orange and cranberry, and this cookie definitely delivered when it came to flavor. I didn't feel like taking a trip to the store to purchase a bottle of orange liquor just to use a couple TBS. I was very generous with the zest. As a matter of fact, I used the zest of 2 large navel oranges, a heaping tablespoon of frozen orange juice concentrate, and subbed orange flavored Craisins. I was afraid that these wouldn't have that 'orange zing' as someone mentioned they were a little bland. These turned out to be far from bland! It wasn't orange overkill either!Delicious! I loved that surprise HINT of cinnamon in the background. I too, melted some semisweet chocolate to drizzle on the tops for a finishing touch (spooned it into a ziploc bag, seal, and snipped a very small hole in one of the bottom corners). These are the most crumbly biscotti I have made, so be sure to use a serrated knife and carefully use slow strokes to cut through the log. It's also helpful to take the time to chop the cranberries into smaller pieces to make the logs easier to slice without breaking. A quick pulse of a food processor or some kitchen shears to snip them into smaller pieces did the trick for me. I didn't want to fuss with a knife. The dough will be quite sticky and tricky to shape into logs, but it is much easier if you do it with wet hands. These were an unexpected hit with my family, but NOT the kids LOL

Wahooo!!!  These were amazing!  We added a pinch of cardamom to the batter and it really made the orange flavor zing!  We did one batch and had to do another to keep up with demand.  So simple and easy to make!  We used OJ instead of liqueur and did just a touch more cranberries and almonds.  Would also be good with a dark chocolate drizzle.  Awesome!

This was my first attempt at biscotti.. they turned out amazing! I gave them to my gran and nana three years ago for xmas..and that's all they ask me for EVERY holiday! (mothers day, valentines day, easter)...it's getting tiring! But, these biscotti are amazing, i double the recipe and dip the ends in melted white chocolate. Place in a cute gift box with a ribbon = fairly cheap xmas gift!

I love me some orange flavor! These are so fragrant when they are baking! I edited the recipe by using fresh OJ instead of liquer and adding about 1/2 teaspoon of orange extract to make sure I got all the orange flavor I wanted. MMmm. These got raves at work when I took them in to my eager "testers".  Smiles all around.

Excellent!! Made these several times, they always turn out perfect, and seem to be better texture than some other flavors.  I used 2 Tbsp orange zest and omitted the liquer; also omitted the almonds (might be why they are easier to slice).  I love the cinnamon taste in the background.  Very good with white chocolate drizzled on top. Mmmmm.

I really liked these a lot - and they weren't hard to make either.  I melted white chocolate and put it in a zip loc bag and kind of went back & forth over the biscotti - then i melted milk chocolate and did the same thing.  So yummy.  I used Grand Marnier.

Delicious biscotti!!! I didn't add almonds but instead used 2 cups of dried cranberries. I added an extra tablespoon of orange zest and used 2 tablespoons of freshly squeezed orange juice. I also drizzled chocolate over them after they cooled completely. WOW. These are soooo good!

My first time ever making biscotti, OMG!!!! fantastic! I did not have any liquour and wasn't going out to buy a bottle just for 2 tbsp so I subbed 1/4 fresh squeezed orange juice and doubled the amount of grated zest. VERY messy to try and get into the shape you need, but once done and in the oven, easy-peasy! I have taste tested them since they came out of the oven and have not iced them yeet, but will be dipping one half into melted white chocolate later after they cool. Thanks for the GREAT recipe Sara!!!!

Very deicious! but a pain in the a to make. So many steps and directions (as is with all biscotti). If you don't have a few hours to keep on this recipe, don't start it. But if you take the time... they come out wonderful!! Perfect for 11-zies and dunking in a cuppa tea because they don't fall apart like most other biscotti.

I can't believe people thought these were bland! They are soooo good.  Like others I used orange juice (trop 50 which seems to be tangier than normal juice) and I used walnuts instead of almonds. I only double cooked half of the batch though.  It was getting late :)  They took forever to harden, not sure what i did wrong.  The other half is still really good as... unocotti?

These are great Biscotti ! Instead of orange liquor I just used orange juice from the fresh orange I used for the zest.

I thought this biscotti recipe was great, and I didn't encounter the problems encountered by other reviewers.  However, the flavors were delicate, and several tasters thought they were bland.

I made the recipe as is using grand Marnier.  Next time I will add more cranberries and more orange zest/GM/or orange extract for a little more flavor.  They are a bit more crumbly than alot of biscotti recipes I've made.
The dough is more tacky than other recipes as well.  I would suggest chilling the dough for about 30 mins before attempting to roll into logs.  I added additional flour but it was still a battle having not chilled it, which I knew I should have.
Use parchment or a Silpat under the logs to ease in removal from the pan. Also, bake in convection if you have that option (for both baking times).
I topped mine with melted Ghiradelli White Chocolate after done.

This recipe crumbles too easily when you eat it.  Biscotti I have made are pretty "crisp".  I think it's a little too much like a "shortbread" vs. biscotti recipe.

Oh, these are awesome! This is my first time making biscotti, and definitely not my last! I used orange marmalade instead of the zest and liquer.  It was very good.  Since I had some lime marmalade (from a Caribbean vacation), I also made these into lime-macadamia nut-white chocolate biscotti.  They were VERY good. So, this is a recipe that could be quite versatile in flavors.  Use your imagination!!  I also found that the second baking was too hot and too long.  Mine came out too brown.  However, dipping them in melted white chocolate definitely distracted from that!  These are wonderful!

Delightful!  I used  1/2 grand marnier and 1/2 o.j, and also cut the cinnamon in half.  Next time I'll go full grand marnier and cut the cinnamon completely for a fresher, fruitier taste.  I also had to bake logs an extra few minutes to get really firm for a drier, crunchier finished product.  The finer dice for berries and nuts makes the logs cut much neater, however, I really like the texture more with whole nuts.  Flavor is great and all in all a great recipe - just like the coffee shop! Especially pretty dressed up with white chocolate. Great gift from the kitchen

Sooooo Good!
I was out of liqueur, so added orange extract, and used toasted walnuts instead of almonds. Excellent texture....but the hero in this is the cinnamon in the background. I really didn't have a problem with the dough being sticky. Damp hands and right onto the  parchment lined pan. Do try these. They are great!

So yummy! I can't stop eating these :) I made mine with all whole wheat pastry flour from Whole Foods. Whole wheat pastry flour is my new best friend! The whole wheat made the biscotti a little crumbly, but I think it's worth it because they're much healthier. They are delicious & easy and I'll definitely make them again!!

These taste great, but I had problems getting them to bake properly.  I had them in the oven for at least 30 minutes for the first round, and they were still a little gummy in the middle.  Next time I will use more cranberries.

I made these today -yum!-yum! These came out perfect! I ground the almonds, chopped the cranberries and  added 1/2t. vanilla extract. I used orange juice --decreased the cinnamon to 1/2teasp. I added 1 more Tabsp flour to dough-it was soft, so  I chilled the dough for 1 hr to make it easier to roll out the logs.I bake a little longer. The flavor is fruity and light and I will make again -- I think you could use chopped dried  cherries or  apricots. I also dipped these in chocolate (white and dark). YUM!

These are so delicious and simple. I had to omit the nuts b/c of allergies and used juice from the zesting orange in place of liquer. Other than that, no changes. I did not have to add flour; I weigh my ingredients and used a total of 280 grams of all-purpose (Gold Medal).

Recipe was not that hard to do but when I sliced it, they crumbled and when I baked them they burnt easily, I only baked for 20 minutes then the 10 after slicing.

This is an excellent recipe. I used splenda instead of sugar for diabetics and I used featherweight baking powder to reduce the sodium and lite salt in place of regular salt. My husband is and I have menieres so maintain a low sodium diet. Thanks

The final product was good however I used 1/2 cup extra flour and still had a hard time placing it on a cookie sheet. It was soft like cookie dough. I shaped it into one long roll using a spoon. Next time I'll make two as per recipe. Baked for 25 min. Was easy to slice into 3/4 inch. Took additional 20 minutes on each side to dry out. I brushed melting chocolate on top. The end result was good. I didn't care for the cranberries. Probably because I paid $4. for for a 6 oz. bag and only used 1/4 cup. Dried apricots may be good. It was time consuming as I was making sweet potato casserole and a creme cheese pumpkin pie at the same time.

These were wonderful!  I took them to work and everyone scolded me for ruining their diets because they couldn't keep their hands off of them.  The orange flavour was wonderful and the cranberries a nice addition.  I dipped one end in semi-sweet chocolate which was a nice addition (but not necessary).  I'll be making this recipe again and ruining other people's diets.  :)

Not the best biscotti I ever made. The dough was very dry, and I found there were too many almonds and cranberries for it to hold together well. Many biscotti broke, and those that didn't, were very hard.

This is my favourite biscotti recipe! It's extremely versatile, making this my go-to biscotti base for other flavours as well. I've made chocolate chip, pistashio, apricot, cherry/chocolate, white chocolate/macadamia nut and many others just by changing the liqueur and spices to better suit. The reason why I gave this a 4 is because it crumbles when it doesn't have enough time to cool. I usually bake it for a little less time and let it cool for AT LEAST 2 hours so it doesn't break as easily while cutting it. I also find that if the dough gets handled too much and gets warm, then the top always cracks. I put the dough in the fridge for 10 minutes before forming and baking it if I'm making some for gifts to avoid cracks. Also, a very sharp knife is needed to get clean cuts. I chop straight down (quickly!) and it's usually pretty soft in the middle so it doesn't break. Definitely give it a try! :)

My first attempt at biscotti and they were absolutely delicious! Like other reviewers, I did use juice from the orange instead of the liqueur. Probably should have sliced them a tad thinner, as it took a bit longer than 10 minutes in the oven to dry them out. I can't wait to make more!

Nice change of flavor for biscotti. Recipe is easy and pretty quick to mix together.I used margerine, still came out great but would imagine butter would taste richer. Just remember to keep an eye on second baking, i let mine brown a little more than planned.

I love biscotti, there's sooo many ways to do it up!!
I bought slivered almonds and crushed them before I toasted them.
I also used extract instead of liquer and drizzled white and dark chocolate to finish ;}

I absolutely love orange cranberry biscotti.  This recipe was easy to make.  I used walnuts instead of almonds.  The only difficulty I had was that the biscotti crumbled a little when I sliced it.  Also, I did not get 40 cookies out of this recipe.  I only got about 15 or 16 cookies.  I'd say if I cut them any smaller they would have really crumbled.  Other than that they were great!!

I made these biscotti last night...they were very good.  I left out the cinnamon and used a little more craisins.  I used chopped almonds becuase the family likes almonds...I used some triple sec with orange juice .....also 1 tsp vanilla.  enjoy ....I made these again and added more craisins as 1/4 cup is not enough.  I used orange juice alone.  Alot of the craisins fell out while slicen the biscotti.....good taste

I enjoyed these, but like other reviewers, they crumbled apart when I cut them.  Flavor was great.  I added orange extract for a little more zip, but otherwise followed the recipe as is.  I’ll definitely make them again & try to tweak the texture.

This was my first time making biscotti, and it came out perfectly!  Better than any I’ve ever bought at the store.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I substituted a few tablespoons of fresh OJ for the liqueur, since I don’t keep orange liqueur on hand.  A couple of tips: I put the dough in the fridge for a bit to make it easier to roll, which definitely helped.  As another reviewer suggested, during the first cooling I covered the “loaves” with a damp towel, which made the cutting much easier - no cracking.  Even my picky kids, who were very skeptical when they saw me putting in the orange zest and cranberries, ended up loving it!

This was a hit.  Everyone loved them.  I may try a little orange extract to bump up the orange flavor next time.

I plan to make it again but add more cranberry for a little more stability so its not as crumbly and instead of parchment paper I coated my pan in powdered sugar for the first bake and it worked wonderfully it wasn't to sweet it was just right. Also I recommend using 1 Tablespoon of orange extract instead of 2 Tablespoons orange liqueur. Over all a wonderful taste and texture and I recommend everyone try it at least once.

Use less sugar I say 1/2 cup. Double the cranberries and the zest  . Toasting time should be less almost burnt mine.  Actually I don't think u need to toast.

Super yummy, but I had to bake it about twice as long as the recipe called for, I think about 40 minutes. I just kept checking and adding five minutes to the timer. Also used 1 TB orange extract instead of orange liquer, and twice as many cranberries, just cuz I like them so much. After they cooled, I glazed with a Tangerine Glaze, and they are awesome!

This was my first attempt at making biscotti of any kind, and I followed the recipe precisely, except that I added 1/8 tsp. of orange extract (since other reviewers said it lacked a distinct orange flavor). I used Triple Sec to make it, and I drizzled the cookies with melted semi-sweet chocolate after they cooled. Delicious! It made about 22-25 cookies for me, but (as others have stated) it is fairly crumbly, and I think it could use some more cranberries in it. I wish I could give this recipe a 4.5 rating, because I thought the flavor was terrific with the added extract, so much so that I ate up the crumbs left behind when I had cut the cookies to bake for the ten extra minutes. (I certainly plan to make it again and again.)

These were excellent! Brought them to our family Christmas, and were huge success. I did not have orange liquer, I substituted store bought orange zest, and 1 teas of orange extract. Great flavor. 
I made the almond ones also. I made 2 batches, but ran out of almonds, so I used choc chips instead. YUMMM.

This was the first time I made biscotti.  It is so easy I dont think I will buy them ever again.  Im going to be honest and tell you I didnt have everything I needed so I couldnt make the recipe as it called.  I used tangerines instead. Maybe that was my problem. I did feel the recipe could have had more flavor.  I used white chocolate with tangerine juice for the drizzle.  Made it a bit sweet but better.  Again I cant really say what the recipe tastes like because I didnt use one of the main items.
