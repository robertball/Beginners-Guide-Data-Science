This turned out really good only I used a yellow pepper as that's what I had and golden potatoes. Also I added Oregano and Italian Seasoning. And instead of velveta I used shredded mild cheddar cheese and cheese whiz  for the sauce.

Good recipe, albeit with some revisions as noted by other reviewers.  I made double the amount, and used pepper and smoked paprika on the chicken.  Also included 3 tablespoons of minced garlic, and one whole chopped yellow onion. Used 16oz  shredded low fat cheese in leui of the Velveeta.  Finally as the dish was complete, stirred in some wondra and left the top off of crock pot, which helped thicken the dish.

Based on other reviews that said it might be bland, I made a few changes right off the top:  Added a red pepper, 4 oz chopped fresh mushrooms, and 1/2 small onion, as well as salt and pepper.  

I loved the dish before I even added the cheese. The chicken itself came out excellent, and the potatos were on the money.  I used a jar of Tostitos cheese dip (plain, no salsa) and that worked out great.  Recipe is definitely a keeper.  4 stars only because I made so many additions.

Not good at all! It smelt really good cooking, but there was just no taste at all.

This was not good. I don’t typically eat velveeta. Maybe that’s why

It’s pretty good.  Used sharp cheddar instead of velveeta but otherwise followed the recipe.  Kids ate it well, adults thought it needed salt and pepper.

The first night it was great. Even had leftovers for another meal. Heated the leftovers overs up a day later and it was horrible very dry and no flavor.

Pretty good recipe but the Worcestershire sauce ruins the cheese sauce. I made it without the Worcestershire sauce and added different seasonings like garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper. It came out a lot better that way.

Could use a bit more flavor.  Add salt and pepper to your liking and maybe some peas.  I did not use processed cheese and it was just the right consistency for the sauce and not too cheesy at all.
