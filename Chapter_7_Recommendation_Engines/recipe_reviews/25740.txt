I like to reserve the ribs for another meal and add finely shredded cabbage in the last 5 minutes--Don't overcook!--altho some folks prefer drained sauerkraut.  Cultural bias, I guess.  Anyway, a hearty bread completes the nutrition and the meal. (I have made fresh rye rolls since the soup is so little effort.) 
Tomorrow, you can have "instant" bbq ribs (glaze with favorite sauce and broil to make a crust), carnitas tacos/burritos, pulled pork sandwiches, meat nachos.  And the meat freezes well, too.

OK. I tried this. I substituted two bags of frozen mixed vegetables (corn, green beans, carrots, etc.) and frozen potatoes as desired and followed everything else, but no soy sauce. Well, I added a few standard soup seasonings from my kitchen, also. Stellar! Wonderful. The ribs add just the right touch of "weight" to the vegetables to make the dish hearty. And, the soup thickens up over a couple of days very nicely. It gets better over time. You may think the five cups of water is a alot, but it's not. You may even want to add more, depending on how thin you like your soups. I really don't like the taste of beef in a vegetable soup but I like my soups hearty so this was a perfect option.

On it's own, this recipe deserves the 5 stars. I did add seasonings for my family's taste, but really it's Just personal preference. The addition of pork ribs to a traditional Tomato Soup gave a wonderful, savory taste.
