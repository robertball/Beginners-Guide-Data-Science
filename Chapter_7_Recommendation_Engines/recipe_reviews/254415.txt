This is pretty darn tasty, just like a good plate of spaghetti with sauce. I forgot I was eating a vegetable instead of noodles. My squash was smaller than average so I reduced the ingredients (one can of tomatoes and 2 tbsp oregano). It was my first time trying the microwave method and it was pretty nice. The squash cooked evenly enough and was ready in less than 10 minutes. I used tongs to scrape out the "spaghetti" and it was easier, and quicker, than with a fork. Instead of using a casserole dish, I just stuffed the emptied squash shells with the mixture and baked, then even served, in those. Definitely a keeper recipe. Thank you for sharing.

Very Good!!!  I used 1 can of diced tomatoes with green chilies and accidentally used a can of diced tomatoes 'chili style'. I also sautéed half a red onion and added that.  I didn't have fresh basil or oregano so just sprinkled dry. Great flavor and a wonderful way to use spaghetti squash.

I followed the recipe, but used my own spaghetti sauce (jarred) because that is what I had on hand. This was the first time I have ever made spaghetti squash and my whole (picky) family loved it! ** I added frozen meatballs to it, and a little more sauce and baked it for 45 min. YUMMMMMMMMMMM

This turned out amazing! I used what I had on hand: fresh tomatoes from the garden, lightly dried basil, and dried oregano, and it was perfect. I think adding some ground sausage would be good as well!

This is a great recipe! The only change I made was using marinara sauce.  I will definitely make this again, everyone raved about it.

This is so good and so easy!! I added hamburger, summer squash, zucchini spices, and LOTS of garlic. Next time I'll parboil the veggies cause it gets very watery, but the broth is good! And good to know you can use the microwave for the spaghetti squash; it was so easy and worked like a charm!

This truly was better than traditional spaghetti. I added bell peppers, mushrooms, Italian sausage and chopped onions.  I also used 1 can of tomatoes and 1 jar of Ragu thick and hearty traditional sauce.  It was great!

I baked the squash halves for 45 minutes while simmering the garlic, tomatoes and spices in a skillet (I added chick peas and black olives). After 45 minutes I used a fork to mix up the "spaghetti" then added some goat cheese and the mixture on top. I mixed together the parmesan with some bread crumbs to put on top, then stuck it back in the oven for another 5-10 minutes.

My mom always told me to make the biggest pot of spaghetti sauce possible, and then use the leftovers for lasagna!  Well, I’ve been using the homemade sauce with zucchini noodles the first time around, but since I’m cutting carbs and calories, I needed a solution for the leftover sauce.  This was perfect!!  I added the Parmesan to the leftover sauce (with a little mozzarella), and followed the rest of the recipe.  Fantastic!  Cooking it the full 45-60min allows for a lot of the liquid from the squash to cook-off - FYI.  THANKS for the recipe!!

Fantastic and a lifesaver for a carbaholic trying to cut back! for the cheese I did half grated and half shredded and also added just a bit of mozzarella to the top at the very end.

Mine certainly was not as beautiful as that in the recipe, but tasty. My youngest and I ate them for dinner. As few adds, beyond meat sausage that I had already cooked up AND a bit of Italian bread crumbs on top. Side note, my youngest isn’t vegetarian or vegan, but he said “it’s really good!”

This was very easy to throw together. I think I will mix everything in a bowl next time, but my squash was pretty large so may have made it a bit more difficult!  Great dinner for someone wanting to watch calories!

Made this again and was the best yet! I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes and 1 was fire roasted. Added one large Tbs of tomato paste and cooked the tomatoes with the spices. I also added some frozen vegan meatless meatballs and some onion to the tomato sauce. Since we r vegan I also added nutritional yeast on top of the spaghetti squash. Then added a layer of spinach and sautéed mushrooms. Added some vegan parm cheese and then the sauce and baked for 1 hour on 450. The high temp and cook time  gets rid of the excess liquid.

This was so delicious and satisfying! I'm on a very low carb, no sugar, no cheese diet and this tasted like I was eating real spaghetti. I made a few mistakes - I cut the squash in the middle instead of lengthwise so I scooped out the squash noodles directly into the greased dish. I also didn't have chopped tomatoes nor do I like them. I used 2 cans of 15 oz tomato sauce with 2 generous teaspoons of basil, oregano, Italian seasoning, chives 1 1/4 tsp garlic salt. I topped the squash with browned ground turkey, mushrooms and the sauce. I did not use any cheese due to the diet I'm on. I baked in the oven for 40 minutes mixing every 15 minutes. It was so tasty! As other reviewers have said Italian sausage would be great in this too!

Very delicious! I had to substitute a bit! Don’t laugh! I had a little bit of meatloaf leftovers so I cut up 2 beef hot dogs! I also used a can of Rotel original tomatoes so it was spicy! Yum!!

This is  Delicious. I scooped the squash into a  casserole dish  and discarded the shell.  We ate it for several days and each day it seemed to be better than the day before .

Baking the final mixture in the squash shell makes a great presentation. I added ground beef, mushrooms, onions and peppers and I bit of seasoning. The was my first time microwaving spaghetti squash and it worked pretty well, but it needed more time to get soft (I used 600w) . Next time I'll do 4 5-min turns. Also, perhaps because of that it needed a good 25 minutes in the oven to for the squash to get soft. I have a convection oven so I stirred the mixture and reduced the temp to 180 C midway through.  Will definitely try this again now that I know how it works with my oven.

Yummy! I followed the recipe pretty closely.  I added browned crumbled Italian sausage then added 1 can of Rotel (instead of the 2 cans of chapped tomatoes)  along with the Italian seasonings.  I layered it with the squash on the bottom, the meat mixture, then added a jar of spaghetti sauce on top.  I topped it off with a couple different kinds of cheese beside parmesan as that's what I had on hand.  Super good!  Thanks for this recipe iamviv!

Tastes even better as leftovers! I doubled the spices and the cheese on top, and was glad I did. I consider it more of a side dish than a main course.

Yummy!  I made 2 (4 halves) and added spinach and mushrooms and a extra can of tomato sauce. Instead of layering, I mixed the sauce with the forked squash and put the cheeses on top.  Also, I used fresh basil chopped up.

Very tasty, I used a thick tomato sauce instead of canned tomatoes. It worked well.  It took longer to make than I anticipated.

This was a really easy and very good recipe for spaghetti squash.  My husband loved it.  As with most recipes, we cut back on the garlic.  For us, half the garlic was plenty and the best flavors came from the fresh basil and fresh oregano.  I will definitely make this again.  I would make it for guests for sure.  Great side dish!

Wonderful recipe and can't wait to make it again. I had never cooked spaghetti squash in the microwave before and it turned out perfect!  Hubby loved it, we ate it as a main course!

I had never made spaghetti squash before so this recipe seemed like a good one to try.  I found the recipe very easy to follow. I used Italian diced tomatoes since they were seasoned with some of the same ingredients as listed in the recipe, instead of just plain diced tomatoes.  The dish smells really good while baking!  I'm giving this recipe only 4 stars because I doubt I'll make it again. I think this was very tasty if you like spaghetti squash, but my family didn't seem too thrilled about the squash part.

First time making anything with a spaghetti squash. I felt like the squash wasn't exactly the right texture but other than that it was pretty good.
