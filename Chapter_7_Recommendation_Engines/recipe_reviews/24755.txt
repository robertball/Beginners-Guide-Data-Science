These potatoes were ok, but I wouldn't make them again.  The taste does not justify the calories.  If you do try make them, make sure you cut the potatoes into SMALL cubes, and watch how much butter you add.  I thought it would have been better with less, as they would have browned better.

I didn't like this recipe very much at all. For the potatoes, I used 6 Russets (I think they were); I didn't peel them (the recipe didn't specify either way) - I just scrubbed and cubed them. This was also one of the rare occasions when I use "American pasteurized process cheese spread" (generic Velveeta). The cooking time of 45 minutes was not nearly enough; at that point, most of the potato cubes were still hard, and a lot more time was needed. After that, the taste was okay, but I thought there was too much salt, plus I would've liked more cheese. Still, I should add that this was best the night I made it; the quality of reheated leftovers was much diminished. Sorry, I wasn't very impressed with this.

used some leftover baked potatoes I had in the fridge for this recipe. It turned out great.  I cut potatoes in to chunks after removing the skin, and followed the rest of the directions, only placed mine in the microwave until heated through and WOW! A great way to use leftover baked potatoes! Thanks

I made these for Easter dinner.  The recipe calls for WAY TOO MUCH PEPPER.  I don't know if my potatoes weren't big enough for the amount of pepper but 1 tablespoon made them horrible.  I just read the reviews and nobody complained about the pepper so maybe I am just not a good cook.  I am going to make them again and only use one teaspoon of pepper or maybe no pepper at all.  Without the pepper I think they would have been very good.

I actually used red potatoes and just sprinkled the garlic salt over the top so it still gives it some flavor but not over the top. I love this recipe!

Loved these potatoes, but definitely made a few changes. I cooked the potatoes about 15 min. longer so they would soften up and I used half a package of Kraft American cheese with 1cup of shredded mild cheddar cheese. My husband and I loved them!

I used Idaho potatoes- peeled and cubed. Stirred while baking every 5 minutes. Halfway through, I turned the oven temp up to 425 as I was reading some of the reviews. I didnâ€™t want all the calories of the cheese- only used 2/3 of the amount- I used shredded cheddar. Delicious! We both loved them

Made this exactly as written with small change.  I added a very small amount of cheese because I love cheese.  However, the butter content was more than needed.  I will cut the butter in half for the next time I try this and I will make it again

They were all right but if I make them again I would use grated extra old cheddar cheese for more flavour.

great, easy to make side dish when you don't have a lot of time. I added some other vegetables for a little extra flavor and a health factor. I melted the cheese before adding it to the potatoes.
