The aroma of these as I was mixing them were wonderful, and the flavor was great too.  However, there are a few key ingredients left out of the original recipe post, so this is how I made my gravy:

2 T butter
1/4 cup flour
1.5 cups beef stock
1/2 cup cream
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon Worchestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper

The recipe doesn't say how many meatballs this made.  Making 2-3 tablespoon-sized meatballs gave me about 34 pretty big meatballs (like, spaghetti-and-meatball size versus IKEA meatball size), which needed to cook longer than the 20 minutes allotted.  Mine ended up cooking for 40 minutes, and were slightly tough on the outside, and the temp only got to 150 inside with my thermometer, but they were definitely done.  I think next time I will cook for a little longer at a lower temp to not have the outside so overdone.

Also, the recipe called for making the gravy before making the meatballs, but I would definitely make the gravy AFTER they are cooked since it really doesn't take more than a few minutes to whisk up.  The amount of gravy made with my measurements there only really coated about half the recipe (the hubby is a gravy fanatic, plus we wanted some for the potatoes too), so I'd at least double it next time since it's very thick, and doesn't stretch far.  Because I was waiting so long for the meatballs to cook, the gravy got super thick, but a little splash of beef stock helped loosen it as I warmed it back up on the stove.

As a Norwegian cook who also cooks Swedish, I can assure you that authentic Swedish meatballs do NOT have either cayenne pepper or Worcestershire sauce in them---only regular black pepper, to taste. Otherwise, exactly the right recipe.

I just viewed Chef John's video for the Swedish Meatballs. This dish has always been one of my favorites and I have been looking for a recipe which tastes great. This one is the recipe I've been looking for. BTW, the video was most instructive and his delivery was very entertaining. I found your sense of humor to be very much like my own.

I want to try these meatballs, however in the instructions, #5 states to whisk in Worcestershire sauce. I don't see that in the ingredient list. How much do you use?

I thought this recipe was really good, although I share the opinion of another reviewer which is to make & cook the meatballs first.  I was in a rush so this made the cooking time faster, and took a couple extra shortcuts.  I did not saute the onions-I just minced them, and did not chill the meatballs either, I just rolled them & tossed them right in the oven. (came out fine!)  I started the gravy (I also added a bit of nutmeg to the sauce)after the meatballs were in the oven for about 10 minutes so both were hot & ready at the same time.  I should add that I only made enough meatballs for 3 but kept the gravy amount as written so we would have plenty for the egg noodles we topped this dish with. We loved the flavor, and these will replace the recipe I've used in the past!

I've kinda winged Swedish meatballs for a while now, but this recipe really refined what I was doing.  Totally awesome.  I changed things ever so slightly - mixed the breadcrumbs with the milk ahead of time because that worked so well in the Italian meatballs.  And I did not start the sauce until the meatballs were in the oven - in fact, sauce and meatballs finished at just the same time. Not buying frozen meatballs ever again!

This is absolutely amazing!!! I just got done making, and the meatballs are the best I've ever made! The flavor of just the meatballs alone are outstanding! I did double the gravy and added 2 beef bouillon cubes for more flavor, but beyond that, I didn't change a thing! AMAZING!

Very good!  I used ground chicken for the meat (because that is what I had on hand) and added extra breadcrumbs to make up for the extra moisture in ground chicken.  Loved the meatball seasoning.  Gravy was very good, used lowfat condensed milk in place of cream and for extra deep flavor in the gravy, I added about a 1/2 tsp. instant coffee.  I know it sounds weird, but this is an ingredient I have always put in Swedish meatballs to deepen the flavor. I served them over spatzle.

I'm Norwegian, and these are just like I remember eating as a kid.  The gravy was perfect, although I must admit I used half and half instead of heavy cream, and had to thicken the gravy a bit with Wondra. But that's not a complaint; I substituted according to what I had on hand. I may increase the seasonings just a tad next time. This will be my go-to recipe for Norwegian (oops - Swedish)meatballs.  2018 edit -- this year I doubled the amount of onion and used a generous measure of the spices.  Perfect!  And with heavy whipping cream (instead of my substitute last time) the gravy was fantastic.  I usually make a triple recipe and freeze them on the cookie sheet after baking (after they're frozen put in an airtight container) so when I serve them I just have to make the gravy and add the meatballs.  It's an easy make-ahead dinner (or appy) for a large group.

If you are used to only beef meatballs, you can just use all beef.  The texture seems odd to me but it was still good.  It will just take getting used to having pork/beef meatballs.  They taste great; I'm just used to all beef meatballs.

However, the sauce is divine!  I grew up on using the McCormick Swedish Meatball seasoning, and I have been trying to find a recipe to emulate it. This is so much better!  Even the seasoning on the meatballs is better!  Thanks, Chef John!

Read the title people..."Chef John's Swedish Meatballs", he can put cayenne and Worcestershire sauce in to make it his take on the recipe.  These were very good, better than the big box store meatballs.

Yes, it was very good. I followed the directions exactly. I don't think I would change anything next time and will definitely make again.

these were awesome, better than ikea's even :)   remember, to avoid tough meatballs, don't overmix and try to use a melon baller to shape the balls, as the heat from your hands will tend to break them down a bit.  the only thing i changed with this recipe is that i used an 8oz container of fresh mushrooms, which were browned in butter before adding to this delicious gravy.  i also added a smidge of allspice.  delicious!  our store doesn't carry lingonberries so i made some homemade cranberry sauce using the teeny cranberries, with a bit of tangerine zest.  very nice substitute using commonly found ingredients.  used homemade creme fraiche for this recipe, and served over egg noodles from trader joe's.  bork bork!!  this is my husbands all time favorite dinner, i made it for his birthday!

Had this for dinner tonight and it was excellent! Best meatballs I think I've ever had and the gravy is to die for over mashed potatoes.  Didn't change a thing except for adding a 1/4 tsp of browning sauce to the gravy because I thought it was too pale-looking.  Adding to my regular rotation.  Thanks for posting!

These are simply delicious.  Easy to make.  If you want the gravy thicker simply simmer once the  meatballs are incorporated.

This is a great recipe! I have made it several times for my family. The only thing I have done different is I make extra gravy, since my family loves it so much. I have served it over egg noodles and rice, both work great.  A must have for your recipe box.

Chef John you have done it again! Best recipe for Swedish meatballs I have ever tried and I've tried many. His tip to use a combination of ground chuck and ground pork and then bake the meatballs is the trick. In the past I have always used lean beef and fried them. By baking you eliminate a lot of the fat, but keep the added flavor. I used 2 cans of Swanson beef broth since some readers complained there was not enough sauce, and served it over egg noodles with chunky cranberry sauce on the side. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. It was great!

LOVED the GRAVY! This is only a partial review, since I used commercial, frozen meatballs but used Chef John's amazing gravy. It was one of those nights where I needed an easy meal in a hurry! 
I served this dish with small, boiled potatoes as suggested and threw together a side salad. 
The gravy was both delicious and easy to make. The only thing I changed was that I added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and about 1 tsp. of dried parsley. One small hint: Be sure that your frying pan isn't blazing hot when you add the bouillon to the flour mixture or you'll get lumps in the gravy.
This is a great recipe. You'll never have to go to IKEA for lunch again.

I am a sixteen year old girl on my mom's account, eating this recipe as I type.. I have been searching for a good recipe for Swedish meatballs for about seven years since trying them at a friend's wedding and falling in love with them. I tried another recipe from this site that was not good, and I had to rate it one-star. I found another recipe on some random food blog and it was okay, but not the best.
    I finally had  heat-and-serve meatballs, cream, and beef broth at the same time and I tried the gravy from  Chef John's, seeing as I've tried and loved his recipes before. I made it by eye, though, seeing as the measurements seemed too much for me, even when I turned it down to one serving.  This recipe takes the cake. I LOVE THEM! Thanks, Chef John, for providing a recipe that satisfied a seven-year-long craving!!!

Thanks for sharing the recipe but the flavour didn't work for me. The gravy is ok but only after a good dose of salt. The meatballs lack flavour except for the over powering taste of allspice.

This was good. I'm not sure where I went wrong but my sauce did not thicken up easily. I ended up adding a bit of corn starch at the end to get it to a consistency that we wanted. Flavor was fantastic. We served it over couscous which was excellent! Will make it again. Also, used oatmeal in place of bread crumbs because that's how my mom always does it :)

I must say that I have made several recipes from Chef John and they never disappoint. That includes this one. I had never made Swedish Meatballs before but had eaten them at a party; I will make them again since my family loved this recipe. I did change it somewhat, I had no ground pork and so I used all ground beef but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Fixed mashed potatoes and English peas and everyone enjoyed the meal immensely. I thank you very much Chef John for sharing your recipes with us.

Overall really good. I had to add another 1/4 cup of cream and 2 more tablespoons of flour because the gravy was way to runny.

Made this recipe tonight and followed it exactly as written. My family LOVED these meatballs,and trust me,they are hard to please..especially my picky kids.The meatballs were amazing, perfectly seasoned.The sauce was wonderful, very delicate flavor,and since there was so much of it I served it over noodles. As I wasn't sure how it would turn out,I made the meatballs and sauce a couple of hours before dinnertime and kept it warm in a crockpot. I will definitely be making this again!

Very good.  My maternal grandmother was from Sweden; I think she would have liked these meatballs. I didn't have plain pork so I used ground pork sausage 1/3 to ground beef 2/3. It added a nice dimension to the flavors. I like my gravy thicker and the amount was inadequate for this recipe so used used my own tried-and-true gravy recipe and added pan drippings as much as I could. I don't understand the sugar so didn't put that in but I added a little chopped parsley to the gravy. I put the recipe in my recipe box!  thanks John!

Yummmmm
This recipe changed my hubbys view of Swedish Meatballs.  He was not a fan from past experience but we both loved your recipe.  I had to do some substitutions because I didnt have all of the ingredients.
I didn't have beef broth so I used 4 beef boulion cubes.
I didn't have All Spice so I used Apple Pie Spice (which is nutmeg, cinnamon and all spice).  I had to cut back a smidge on the Nutmeg ingredient because of this.  
I Also added more cayenne, I doubled the cayenne because I love my pepper.  By doing this it added some heat to the sweet.
I didn't have plain breadcrumbs (surprisingly) but I did have have seasoned Panko breadcrumbs so I used those.
I also used ground turkey instead of the main meat ingredients.  
I dont usually like to substitute until after I tried the recipe for the first time on its own, but aside from the meat and double cayenne I don't think my alterations would have made a major difference in the flavor. Thank You Very Much this is a great recipe, gonna try your Fried Chicken today.

I have made this recipe several times now and always get compliments. I never seem to have many leftovers, either. I sometimes use a mix of ground pork, beef, and veal (meatloaf mix) instead of just pork and beef. I also add fresh nutmeg into the sauce. I love this recipe and recommend it to anyone who craves something a little different. It is great served with egg noodles!

The meatball mixture is similar to what I've always made. My dad was a first generation American with all relatives having immigrated from Sweden. I grew up with what I feel is authentic Swedish meatballs. Definite no on the worcestershire and cayenne. The recipe my grandma Hilma made used sour cream with dried dill weed in the gravy which is how I still make it.

These were very good.  I made 1/2 the recipe for me and my husband and still had enough to freeze for another meal.  Served with garlic dill new potatoes from this site as didn't want just plain boiled potatoes with it.  Delicious.  Will be making these again.

I made the gravy from this recipe and it was FANTASTIC! I took the suggestions to double it and followed Stella's suggestion to reduce the amount of beef broth. I didn't add the sugar and didn't miss it.

This is a wonderful recipe.  The only thing I did different was to add 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon onion powder, a dash of hot sauce, and an extra 1/4 teaspoon of worcestershire to the gravy.  I served it over mashed potatoes, and it was absolutely delicious!  A true comfort food!!

Wow!  These were so good.  Even my super picky kids loved them.  The sauce this makes is fantastic.  I'll double it next time so I have more to use over noodles or rice.  I suggest watching Chef John's video on how he makes this - it is very helpful.

Very good, comfort food!  I prepared meatballs per recipie except I used garlic and herb breadcrumbs.  I think the garlic worked well.  I put half of the prepared and baked meatballs in the freezer for another day.  Since I wanted extra gravy anyway, I followed the recipie as written and served the half recipie meatballs and full gravy recipie over hot noodles.  It made a very nice dinner for my husband and me with left overs for the next day.  I'll repeat the gravy when I pull out the frozen meatballs.  The only thing I would have done differently was step up the cayenne pepper a notch.  I liked it as is but my husband would like a little more spice.... (I'm hiding a smirk!)

So delicious!  I watched Chef John's video and followed this recipe and my first time making these turned out awesome.  I like it that the meatballs were baked first.  I think this makes it less greasy than if I would've sautee them in the skillet.  I also used pork with 25% fat as he recommended. Wow! The meatballs came out super tender.  But you'll have to skim off a layer of fat in the gravy in the end.  The gravy by itself is quite bland.  The only thing I would change is to simmer the meatballs in the gravy for 20 minutes instead of 5, so the spices from the meat will carry into the gravy.  This is a time consuming recipe best left for the weekend but well worth it.

I used his normal meatball recipe (but used venison instead of pork) and doubled it all for my daughters birthday party. It was a huge hit! I will definitely be making it again! 4 pounds of meatballs and the sauce doubled, at the end of the party there were only 2 meatballs left! The best thing I've ever made! I love Chef John's recipes! Thank you!

If I could give it 6 stars I would! Absolutely delicious. Made it per recipe except for allspice (which I didn't have so I left it out) and heavy cream (all I had was 2% lactose free milk).  I did have to leave them in the oven for an extra 10 minutes but that might just be my oven.  Will be part of my regular menu from now on.

This is amazing! I have always loved Swedish Meatballs, but never made them myself, so this was my first try. They are so easy to make. My extremely picky five year old cleaned his plate and asked for seconds! I about fainted, he never asks for seconds.
I served them with noodles, since my little picky guy will not touch potatoes, and it was wonderful together.
The only change I made was using all beef, as I didn't have pork on hand. Next time I will try it with the pork, I think it will make a difference.
And next time I will cut back just a little on the nutmeg. It wasn't terribly overpowering, but it definitely stood out.
And I also recommend at least doubling the gravy.

These were spot on in the taste department, reminded me of the meatballs my grandmother use to make! My gravy was a little thin, I'm not sure what I did wrong but I added a little more flour and it thickened to gravy consistency and was delicious. I have tried several of Chef John's recipes now and I have never been disappointed, nor have any of my guests. Thank you for sharing your creations!

Great recipe, but just be prepared for the steam that jets out of the oven. At 425 degrees, those meatballs give off a lot of steam. I suffered 2nd degree burns on both forearms, and I'm a pretty experienced responsible cook. Be careful!!

Have made these twice now and they turned out wonderful both times.  When it comes to making the gravy, I add a little extra of everything to the point that I get about one and a half times the recipe amount, since it is so good over my potatoes and mixed with the veggies on my plate.  Heck, I could drink it straight if nobody was looking.  And John (and millions of Swedes) is right about the Lingonberry Preserves.  They are such a great accent to the dish, if not a bit difficult to find.  Not every grocery store carries them, but well worth the special trip to search them out.  Make these.  You won't regret it.

This was absolutely delicious! I have been searching for this taste since a friend's mom made it in high school decades ago!
I did adjust the simmering time of the gravy and reduced it to 10 minutes. I also added a  cup of chicken stock to the gravy to make less thick.

Absolutely perfect although perhaps could cut the salt down by a half teaspoon. My family loved this served over plain boiled potatoes as directed! Made this exactly as per recipe...no changes!

Made this for dinner and it was really good.  The gravy took a little longer than the instructions said, but other than that, it came together great.  I used a cookie scoop to make the meatballs the same size.  Made with egg noodles, salad, and green beans.

Fantastic meatballs. I use this meatball recipe twice. Once with this sauce and once from the Easy Swedish meatball sauce recipe from this site. Both were good.

The only thing I changed was using 18% cream instead of 35. I then thickened the sauce with some cornstarch....

I just had a party of 6 over for dinner. I served the Swedish meatballs over pars lied potatoes and it was a hit! I used rice starch instead of flour and added mushrooms to the sauce. My husband said I can definitely make it again. I also used a whole onion because I like the taste and it helped keep the meatballs together.

I got great reviews from Hubby...My only grrrrrrrr was the sauce was not thick enough even after reducing by half...I felt that that would have made it a smudge better...Otherwise...Used red pepper flakes instead of cayenne and didn't feel like frying up onions so used minced onion instead and omitted the all spice altogether...I also used ground turkey and ground pork...very good...making again for sure!

I made this recipe as stated.  I live with a Swedish-Finn, and he though the recipe outstanding. I made this with salad and steamed potatoes one night, and rice and steamed green beans the next; I served homemade lingonberry preserves with both.  This was a great recipe.  Thank you.

This is the Second recipe we have tried from the same person & we loved it! we would maybe make the meatballs a little smaller as we struggled to eat two cooked meatballs with mashed potatoes) and we are a family that loves sauce, so we would at least double the amount of sauce

This review is for the gravy part of this recipe only (although I'm sure the meatballs are fabulous too; after all, this is a Chef John recipe). I made Johnsonville Italian Meatballs and, as an afterthought, decided I wanted a Swedish meatball dish. So I began looking and decided to make this sauce. It is a little bit thinner than what I've had before, but that didn't bother me at all. I didn't add any extra salt or pepper since my meatballs used hot Italian sausage. I served the meatballs and gravy over angel hair pasta.

I made these with the other meatball recipe he has on here.  They were pretty good and smelled great, but I have another recipe that I prefer more.

I used sour cream instead of the heavy cream and baked the meatballs for an hour (they were big) so they got all browned on the outside.  It was amazing!

This was such a comforting, truly satisfying dinner! The meat balls were light and delicate. The gravy was from heaven! (the noodles were embarrassing easy). The loganberry sauce was a perfect compliment to both the meatballs and gravy—the way cranberry sauce is to a roast turkey breast. Everything was lovely. Kudos! This will be appearing, and disappearing—again, and again!

These were pretty good. Next time I would add more nutmeg and allspice. The sauce wasn't quite as thick as we prefer, but it was tasty. I'll be making a few tweaks for next time but will make them again!

These are amazing! The only thing we do different is double the gravy, it is so good I like my meatballs and noodles swimming in it. We double the meatball recipe so we can freeze them for a delicious easy meal another day. We make the gravy fresh, I cannot imagine that would freeze well.

This has become the new family favorite. I actually doubled the recipe and got  32 - 3Tbs meatballs. I split them into three meals, vacuum sealing and freezing two portions and keeping the third in the fridge. It made a super easy weeknight meal. I made sauce according to the directions the night of and once the sauce began to thicken I tossed ten meatballs in with the sauce to reheat. Ten meatballs with buttered noodles were enough to feed me, my wife and our toddler with one serving left over. We will definitely be keeping a bag of these in the freezer!

This was good, but a LOT of ingredients and steps for a beginner (if I had it to do over I would have waited until I was more comfortable and adventurous in the kitchen before trying this). I didn't really like the sauce with this and ended up using a different sauce recipe (the main reason I had to reduce the stars), but the recipe for the meatballs is good and I've used that at least 3 times now. I don't like the texture of onions so I substitute onion powder. I also omit the cayenne since I don't like any hint of spice. Other than that, I believe I follow everything else to the T (except maybe the salt as we sometimes reduce salt for some in the family). Once I did try substituting Turkey burger, usually a favorite of mine, but for me that doesn't work at all (wrong consistency and bad flavor), so I would definitely recommend sticking with the meats in the recipe. I think the ground pork, in particular, gives these a soft, juicy flavor that's pleasant while also being meaty.

Delicious! I only made the sauce though. Used frozen meatballs in the instant pot, put all the ingredients for the sauce besides flour and cream. Set the IP for 10 minutes. Made the roux (flour and butter) separately while the IP was doing its thing. Then when it was done I slowly added the roux into the instant pot then the cream. PERFECT and easy.

Amazing!!! Kids loved it, I served it on bow tie pasta with little golden potatoes. I boiled the potatoes until tender, drained, added butter and crushed garlic continued to cook for about 3 min. Like I said my teens loved them. Thank you chef John, this is a new family recipe.

Chef John, this recipe is a keeper! My teenage son could not stop talking about these meatballs. His comment was: "mom, this is better than IKEA's!". The meatballs are very tasty, juicy and flavorful.  I twisted the recipe by adding 2 minced garlic when sauteing the onions.  This recipe is very hearty and perfect for the cold weather.  Thank you!!!

really enjoyed... actually cooked meatballs (beef only)  in pan with butter, then added chicken broth (all I had) and worcestershire.  Then added cornstarch and water to thicken.  Didn't add the cream, as I didn't have any, and we all enjoyed it over egg noodles.  By not adding cream... you lighten it up a bit.

Ok. Made with venison as I had to use up a lot meat as freezer door was left open. Nice dish, nothing that really knocks my socks off. I completed recipe and then packaged for freezer for a quick dinner.

I loved it. I did of course change a few things. I did not cook onions, too soupy for the balls. I did not refrig the meat, too time consuming. I did not have any beef broth so used chicken. I think I might have put a bit to much Worcestershire sauce so at the end I added a can of cream of Bacon soup to lighten up the taste. These are so good. Put them over some spetzel Chef John showed me how to make in his video

The flavor for the meatballs and gravy was delicious! And I was super excited to find the traditional Swedish berry sauce at TJ Maxx. However, the gravy was too runny and did not stick to my noodles. Will add more flour or corn starch next time. Added 1/4c worsetechire sauce and 2/3c of sour cream (instead of heavy cream) and allspice and nutmeg in gravy! Will make again if I can get the gravy right. Boyfriend thought it was too messy.

I have made this recipe at least a dozen times and love the ingredients but have completely changed the method of cooking. I simply fry the meatballs in a bit of oil until browned on all sides. I remove them then use the skillet to make the gravy. Once made I add the meatballs back to the gravy. Sometimes I sub sour cream, cream cheese --even chip dip in the gravy. I add 1 Tbsp. of Worcestershire Sauce to the gravy since we like it.
Also, I will make up to 3X the recipe, cook and simply freeze what we will not eat today into bags and freeze. Slip into microwave to defrost and dinner is pretty easy to prepare after that!

I did make a couple of changes. I didn't have beef broth so I experimented with water and powdered ranch dressing. Also, although I know it is sacrilegious to say so, I did not use cayenne in the recipe. My wife is the cook in the family and she was very impressed. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks Chef John!

I rarely follow a recipe exactly. I don’t eat pork so I used 2 pounds of ground chuck instead. I followed all the other instructions exactly. They were delicious and the meatballs weren’t rubbery like IKEA’s. I used a cookie dough scoop to form the meatballs.

We really liked this recipe. I did adjust some quantities using only 1/2 teaspoon of salt (total) and 4 cups of beef stock. I used ground turkey instead of the pork because that's what I had in my freezer. We served it with a choice of linguine noodles or homemade mashed potatoes and both were very good. We served a raspberry preserves on the side. The berry preserves does make a big difference in the taste. I will probably make this again and definitely recommend giving this recipe a try.

Delicious! I must say I didn't make this according to the recipe, though. We can't eat pork, so I made the meatballs with approx. 1 pound of ground beef. Because of this, I used only 1 egg. I did add salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and kafta spice (which the 1st ingredient is allspice). I did not saute the onion; I just finely chopped it and mixed it in. My meat mixture made 22 almost ping pong ball sized meatballs. I baked them on a gridded cooling rack over a jelly roll pan to avoid having them swim in grease in a 425 degree oven for about 20 minutes. They came out perfectly! 
The sauce: I doubled the recipe. I did not have beef broth, so I made some with 8 beef bouillon cubes to 6.5 cups water. I did not add salt to the sauce due to the bouillon. At the end, according to the recipe, I added the meatballs.
I served this over egg noodles. My husband loved it. I will definitely make this again.

I made this recipe exactly as stated  which I always do the first time.  The meatballs were fine, not outstanding, but the real issue was the thin sauce which I feel wasn't tasty enough.  I am not unused to making sauces and it was just too thin no matter what I did to it.  I added more flour and that didn't thicken it at all and cooked it longer and that did nothing.  As for the amount of the sauce, I froze half the meatballs, so we had plenty of sauce.  I will use another sauce to use with the frozen batch.

The good - tasty as all get out! 
The bad - you truly need to double the portions on the gravy. 
Suggestions - I added Marsala wine, onions and mushrooms to the sauce which added some depth.

Made this as a Sunday night company dish that I could keep warm in crock pot until serving time. I made twice the gravy and served over egg noodles with steamed broccoli. A great treat as reheated leftovers the next day.
I also added a few splashes of dry sherry to the gravy and let the alcohol cook out for a few moments. This adds a wonderful interest to the gravy.

Very delicious and a giant hit at my Christmas Eve party. I did make a couple additions:
1) I found the meatballs themselves to be a little underseasoned, so I added more seasoning to the sauce to make up for it. Next time I will add salt to the meatball mixture.
2) The gravy needed a tiny boost in flavor, so I doubled the worcestershire amount and added a dash of nutmeg.

I’ve been wanted to make Swedish meatballs for a year or so now. I finally found a recipe worth trying. I followed the recipe for the gravy step by step. I use frozen turkey meatballs instead of making my own. I used chicken broth instead of beef because that what I had on hand. I used brown sugar instead of white because I wanted to see if there would be a big difference in taste. Hahaha. Not at all. I added 1clove of garlic minced(love garlic). I seasoned my sauce with black pepper, little pinch of salt, Cajun seasoning(I like spice), and onion powder. Oh, I devoured my dish with a side of jelly for the first time and it was delicious.

Chef John always has great recipes. As a busy cook this was too tedious for me. I made the meat for meatballs one night and next night made 1 ounce meatballs (I made appropriately 24 & baked for 20 min... perfect,) I had to thicken the sauce but maybe just my preference. I did make the sauce while meatballs were cooking as it made more sense. Knowing my family would not fully appreciate traditional Swedish flavor, I made with spicy Italian sausage and ground chuck. Served over egg noodles with cilantro (and an entire nation gasped!) very good and fun to tweek but just too much work for this criminal. Keep em coming chef!

I made the recipe with the exact ingredients as listed. The only change that I made was to fry the meatballs rather than bake them. I made the sauce after cooking the meatballs in the same pan and left all the crispy bits in the pan. This was delicious! I will absolutely make this again.

These are excellent Swedish meatballs!  I really like the difference that using a blend of ground pork and hamburger makes....  I have only ever made Swedish meatballs with all-hamburger before, but I think the blend of meats really does make a difference.  This recipe makes some very moist meatballs!  My husband and teens loved the sauce.  My only complaint is that it takes a LONG time to make (a little over 2 hours), so I don't know how often I will actually have the time to make this.  But if you have a day with time to spare, and want an excellent meal.....  Go for it!

These were delicious, the one thing that I am concerned about with baking them in the oven though, is that the bottoms burned on all the meatballs.  This significantly changed the result.  If I can fix that, this would be an awesome recipe.

My family absolutely loves this dish.  The only changes I have made were 1, decreasing the amount of nutmeg/allspice (my family is apparently sensitive to spice).. and, I serve over hot buttered egg noodles, since no grocery store within shooting distance has ever heard of lingonberries..

Very delicious recipe as are all of Chef John's. Do follow all the steps and don't skimp on anything . Bake the meatballs until they are well done and the flavors will get even better. My mouth waters every time I make.

I made this but somewhat doubled it by adding another pound of ground beef, more bread crumbs and more milk as I was serving about 8 very hungry guys. I made my own gravy recipe though. Needless to say, these were a big hit!

Subbed out heavy cream with whole milk, used chicken broth with a splash of gravy master.  Taste like a dream. Served with Cranberry sauce.

My husband and daughter loved these! And asked for it again. We were inspired to make Swedish meatball after a trip to Minnesota. These were very similar to what we ate there and easy to make, especially since I make the meat mixture the night before. My favorite part is that you cook the meatball in the oven so there’s less mess.

I wanted to double the sauce but 6 cups of beef Beth was way too much for the 6 plus tablespoon of flour I used t thicken. So I ended up using  about 4 cups of broth.  Next time I’ll  make more roux. I made the meatballs mixture ahead and froze. While the meatballs cooked in my air fryer I made the sauce. A rich meal for sure!

This is delicious. However, the gravy is very thin. Next time, I will  make it thicker so it stays on the egg noodles instead of going to the bottom of the bowl.

I don't eat pork, so I made these with all ground chuck. it tasted just like the Swedish meatballs I used to eat as a kid. The only thing I noticed was that the gravy was a bit runny. I added some of the gravy thickening powder and it dissolved nicely with no lumps and thickened it right up!

I doubled this without even trying it out first because I trusted Chef John so much. It was pretty darn good. I had some doubts in the beginning, but by the time they were done baking my kitchen smelled amazing. I even bought some fancy blackberry (no lingonberry at my local store) jam to have with it, and that really set it off nicely. My picky toddler had seconds, but my even pickier tween thought it was "meh". Win some and lose some, I guess.

I changed up the directions a little. After making the gravy, allowing the gravy to thicken to desired texture, I placed the gravy in the crockpot. Added the cooked meatballs and cooked on low for about 3 hours. This allowed the meatballs to tenderize and get infused with the gravy.  The recipe is perfect. Chef John, you never disappoint. Thanks.

We will definitely make again! Easy and perfect every time!

This is one of our go-to recipes, it's comfort food at its best.  We follow the directions exactly (except we double the recipe for our large family).  We serve over egg noodles.  Fabulous.  Don't hesitate to make this.  
NOTE: It does take a few minutes to roll all of the meatballs so allow plenty of time.  Also, we have found refrigerating the meatballs isn't necessary and does not change the taste/texture at all.

The meatballs and this sauce were absolutely delicious!  I’ve tried many recipes for Swedish meatballs, and this was the best.  My only change was to stir about 1/2 cup of sour cream into the sauce before adding the meatballs.  I served it over cheese tortellini.  Yummy!

Thanks for this recipe.  I'm Danish-American, was asked to make Danish frikadeller (meatballs) for a party yesterday, but was a bit fearful that my American friends wouldn't be into the Danish version that is made without gravy or preserves.   I found yours, made some tweaks based on my family's recipe, as well as Chef Marcus Sameulsson's recipe, and this is what became (note:  I followed tradition and fried my 'balls in butter rather than baking.  It just tastes better in my book.):

I started the meat mixture up to the addition of seasonings (had already added salt & pepper to taste), removed half to make Danish frikadeller, and left the other half in the stand mixer and added spices.  I did tweak the spices a bit, adding just a pinch of allspice, nutmeg, and a bit of honey (after reading Chef Marcus Sameulsson’s recipe for Swedish meatballs), omitting the others mentioned. I doubled the recipe for the party, so anything mentioned is based on 2 lbs veal and 2 lbs pork, and ended up with about 34 small and 12 medium 'balls.  I also followed a bit more traditional way to combine ingredients to apparently allow for better mixing and then melding of ingredients (per my Danish family and friends).

Great recipe! Softening the chopped onions in butter and salt is brilliant. I fried the meatballs instead of baking them, then de-glazed the pan with 1/4 cup white wine and a splash of lemon.

We thought that the gravy was too bland and not thick enough.  I don't know for sure what it needs really.  I think if I ever use this recipe again I would use more flour and/or less milk.

No changes.   The gravy was ok but nothing to write home about.  The meatballs just tasted like little plain hamburgers.  I realize the dish is not a spicy affair but it was just way too MEH.     I don't know if I'll bother with it again.

I made this dish vegetarian by using meatless veggie balls ... only using the gravy recipe for this dish.   I substituted beef broth with mushroom stock and added mushrooms to the gravy.   Very easy to make and delicious too!

This recipe was the first time I've ever made meatballs by hand, and it's become one of my favorites.  Made it again tonight and only made 1 change: before I added the meatballs into the gravy I added a can of mushroom stems and pieces (drained them first) and let that simmer a couple of extra minutes before putting the meatballs in.  Still yummy!

LOVE this recipe!!! It takes awhile to prepare so we tend to cook it on the weekends but it is sooooo good. The first time I made it I accidentally bought beef stock.  It was great, so I now only use beef stock. Last time I made it I didn't let the sauce thicken enough and it was a bit more watery, didn't alter the flavor but wish I wouldn't have rushed it.

Easy and delicious. The oven baked meatballs made this recipe super easy. I used 18% coffee cream as that's what was in the fridge. My kids, husband and I loved it.  I will make this again.

Chef John has never steered me wrong, and these meatballs are no exception: I can't begin to describe how delicious this recipe was! I used crushed matzo crackers in place of bread crumbs, and reduced-sodium broth. The only challenge was that the meat mixture is VERY sticky to work with; you'll want to either work near the sink or have a bowl of water handy, so you can wet your hands frequently. The recipe yielded 27 meatballs for me, and there was just the right amount of gravy -- plenty, but not overwhelming.

Great recipe!!! I followed the recipe to the letter and it was perfect. Everyone in the family (young and old) LOVE this recipe and request it all the time! The meatballs are soft, savory and melt in your mouth. The only change I made was switching up the order and made my sauce while the meatballs were already baking.

These are very tasty and easy to make. I gave it a 4/5 because the mix was very sticky. Next time i may decrease or omit the milk.

Made these swedish meatballs for christmas. They were a huge hit! Good texture and flavor. Gravy seemed thin at first but thickened up to the perfect consistency after we added the meatballs and it was in the crock pot to serve. Will DEFINITELY make this again THANK YOU!

I didn't have time to go to the store so I used what I had on hand and it turned out great!  All beef and 1/2 & 1/2 rather than cream were the changes I made.  This will be a definite to serve guests from now on.

Fabulous. Not necessarily healthy with the heavy cream, but a meal that’s good for the soul. I originally was gonna cut the recipe in half but still make whole amount of gravy bc we love gravy. I ended up making the other half of the recipe bc my 5 yr old daughter shocked me and ate 4 tablespoon size meatballs and wanted more. I followed recipe except I added dehydrated onions for I’m not the best with mincing stuff small. I cheated and used a cookie dough scoop to scoop onto cookie sheet. Baked at 350 for maybe 20 mins and we’re at 269 degrees. I made meatballs ahead of gravy bc I was also making garlic green beans and egg noodles to serve over. It was a big help to do this in advance and I set them on place until gravy was done and I put back in gravy to simmer together. This was the first time I’ve ever made Swedish meatballs and this recipe is excellent. Passing recipe along to family

Need to really thin out the broth at the start : make flour rue adding some mushroom, beef stock or both about 1/2 cup.

These were really good. I do agree with making the meatballs first and cooking them while starting the gravy. Also, I doubled the roux ingredients to go with the 3.5 cups of beef broth and it was perfect.  Wish I had added nutmeg to the gravy too!

I made this with what I had, 1 lb ground chuck with 1/4 lb ground pork. I skipped the cayenne and only had 1/2&1/2. My whole picky family ate it. When I told them that some recipes called for sour cream, the teenager added some to her dish and said, "What's not better with sour cream?"Looking forward to trying lingonberries next time.

The family really liked these meatballs. I wasn't sure when to add the salt during the meatball making process. I think the video said to add it along with the onions as they are softening, but the recipe doesn't say when to add it.  Other than that, I was able to follow this recipe as is and they turned out very well. Thanks for submitting this!

I made it but cheated. I used frozen meatballs and they worked perfectly. I followed the recipe for the gravy. Three tablespoons of flour doesn’t thicken. I added one tablespoon of corn starch to make the gravy thicker. Make sure you you add corn starch to cold water to dissolve. As soon as the gravy was thicken to my desire I added the cooked meatballs. Made some mash potatoes. Well la dinner.

Substituting ground turkey for pork doesn't affect recipe. Absolutely delicious. Accidentally ate almost the whole recipe while I was waiting on people. Had to hurry and make more before they arrived.

This was really yummy! I did make it with venison because we have a lot. I made the gravy while the meatballs were baking then tossed them in the gravy while I boiled some noodles and steamed some veggies. I did not have heavy cream so I used some regular milk and then added some sour cream at the end to make it creamier. Hubby said he was done then stood over the stove with a fork while I was trying to clean up.

It was pretty good!  Good flavor to the meatballs, enhanced by a creamy gravy.    I added some sautéed mushrooms to the sauce, as we needed to use them, but otherwise made it as written, served over egg noodles with a side of asparagus.  We'd try it again.

Great recipe!!!! I've made it twice. The first time the only change I made was to double the gravy. The second time, in addition to doubling the gravy, I used half ground beef & half ground turkey (because they were out of ground pork at the grocery) which substituted well for the ground pork. I also used about 1 1/2 C freshly processed breadcrumbs because to me they just taste better than the kind you buy in a store. I serve the meatballs with No-Yolk noodles. And as for my 4 year old, who will not touch any sort of red meat, he cleaned his plate! Win Win!

Really delicious meatballs but gravy less than stellar.  I made the meatballs using all beef and otherwise followed the recipe as written.  I was leary of using allspice but as Chef John's recipes are excellent I did as directed.  Baked them for about 25 minutes (remember they cook more in the gravy)  I think one reason why it's good to do them in the oven ( I used a deeper pan ) as quite a bit of grease comes out at this beginning phase and then it not incorporated in the rest of the dish.  I found the gravy was off balance with the butter/flour ratio and tasted pasty so next time i will keep it the same as the butter 2 TBS to 2 TBS as one usually does with a roux.  Also use a high quality beef broth otherwise this can become too salty very easily.  It's a lot of work for a 2=person meal - but we both LOVED the flavor of the meatballs .  I served ours over noodles.

Well, it's a Chef John recipe, so of course I love it!! I didn't change the recipe itself since these are quite delicious just as written. But I did make my meatballs smaller since we prefer our Swedish Meatballs smaller than spaghetti type meatballs and I doubled the gravy. Yum, yum, yum!!!

My family and I just loved these Swedish meatballs. I only changed one thing. I swapped out the bread crumbs for gluten free saltine style crackers. I will be making them again for sure. Also they would be great made ahead and thrown in a crockpot with BBQ sauce for a party. Thank you for the wonderful recipe Chef John.

I was looking for a GF recipe for Swedish Meatballs and decided this was easily adaptable, I merely substitute blender ground GF crackers for the crumbs and used cornstarch instead of the flour.  I need a recipe to make enough meatballs for 85 people for a 50th wedding anniversary.  This is Superb!  Now to start making meatballs and freezing them for the big day in June.  Thank you!

Very Good; my family loved it! But next time I think I'll skip the nutmeg (don't care for nutmeg and I shouldn't have used it to start). I would also add some garlic, because I love garlic. Served over egg noodles.

Great flavor. May want to double or triple the gravy portions so there is enough to cover whatever starch is being served with the dish.

Loved it!!  Spiced up the gravy a bit to taste, but will use it "as is" for other recipes!  Thank you for sharing!

Made these last night, followed the recipe as written, served with mashed potatoes and whole berry cranberry sauce as I didn't think to pick up lingonberry jelly.  I made them early in the day, let them cool and then closer to dinner I made the gravy and added the meatballs to warm up.  What I found was that the gravy had too much oil floating on top.  This could've been oil that stuck to them as they were cooling, maybe next time I will remove them from the pan and cool them on paper towels.  I used a small ice cream scoop to keep the size of the meatballs uniform, they were just about 1 1/2 inches in size, and I got 42 meatballs. Plenty of leftovers.   Hubby liked them  so I will make them again, though this is probably not something I will add to my rotation.  Nice for a change.

I made these for a super bowl party, and one of the ladies that is from Sweden committed that these taste just like her moms.   Very tasty, and will be making again this week for a pot luck.

I think the basics of this recipe are good. However, I doubled the sauce and when I added the meatballs to it I heated the mix in the oven at 300 degrees for 30 minutes. The flavors blended and it was much better than when I followed the recipe as listed.

Everyone in the family loved it. I would agree with the video and recommend not using lean meat. I used lean beef and the meatballs could have been more tender if I had not.

I followed the recipe and the meal came out amazing. However, for the gravy, I forgot the heavy cream so I substituted it with evaporated milk and it worked just fine. My pleased family said this recipe is a keeper!

My family tends  to enjoy  a heavier hand with regard to spices so although I did used what was listed, I just put a bit more.  The meatballs were a great hit. A definite do again.

This was an AMAZING recipe. The only thing I changed was I added 1/4 tsp. cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. ground cloves to the spices.  We didn't have  lingonberry jam but we used cranberry sauce and it was really good!!

The smell of Swedish meatballs at IKEA's cafeteria, is mouth watering, but I could never order any, as I can't have any pork. So, I was excited to make them at home using only beef. I made sure the beef wasn't lean to insurance tender meatballs. That was the only change I made. Both the meatballs and the gravy were delicious. I served over noodles. Half the recipe was plenty for 4 servings ( it made 20 meatballs )Everybody loved them.

We loved this recipe!  The meatballs were tender, and the flavor of the sauce was super. It was a little salty, however, and a little thinner than my preference. 
I'll surely make it again, but I might use just two cups of beef broth and one-and-a-1/4 cup water to lower the saltiness. I'd also increase the flour a little to make it thicker. 
I liked the idea of making  homemade German spaetzle to use as the base, but I didn't have the time. I'll try that next time.   Overall, I loved this recipe. Thanks for sharing, Chef John!

I made Chef John's Swedish meatballs the other night and followed the recipe exactly as written. The meatballs had wonderful flavor and the sauce also tasted great! Followed another reviewer's suggestion to add more salt and pepper.  I had some issue with the sauce being thin, so I did add another tablespoon of flour at the end of the recipe and let it boil off a little. Served with buttered egg noodles. My husband and toddler loved this recipe. Thanks Chef John for another great recipe!

Made this last night following recipe as written.  Served over medium egg noodles with steamed fresh green beans.  I am thinking I will add something to the sauce such as finely chopped mushrooms to make this a five star for my family.

Excellent dish!!!  I made the recipe with GLUTEN FREE flour and used 4 tablespoons instead of 3.  The flavor was amazing...very much like the Swedish meatballs at IKEA.  I coupled with whole cranberry sauce instead of loganberry and served the dish with steamed asparagus.  DEFINITELY recommend!  (Be sure to salt and pepper the sauce at the end of thickening).

Note to self:  double the gravy.  Good comfort food. Worked to make in advance  and let meatballs sit to approximately room temp before popping in oven for indicated cooking time.

12/29/16: Absolutely delicious! I wouldn't change a thing! I have never made Swedish meatballs before, however I have tried them lots of times. This by far is the most remarkable, most delicious Swedish meatballs I have ever had! Served over egg noodles and a big dish. So sorry I forgot to take a pic. I will be making this many many more times! Enjoy!

I followed the recipe to a T, and think it's a good base recipe. That said, I would make some changes. I like a softer meatball and would use maybe another egg and additional breadcrumbs.  Also maybe ground chuck instead of sirloin.  I'd also reduce the onions a bit. I liked the gravy. Will make it again, with some tweaks.

My husband requested Swedish meatballs for dinner. I watched the video and followed recipe with the exception of allspice (didn't have any). The whole family loved this. Takes a while but easy to make, served over egg noodles. YUM!

Everyone loved these, even the grandkids. I have made these twice. On Superbowl Sunday, with moose,pork and beef. The Broncos won, so a great day for us! Last night I made them with bulk Italian sausage and ground turkey. I suggest make twice as much for the gravy. Yummy!

Good recipe.  However I did add some fresh sliced mushrooms to the sauce before I added the cream and let them cook down and then added the cream.  Served it with freshly mashed potatoes.  Good comfort food

I will definitely make this again as the sauce for this recipe is absolutely divine.   I would've gave it five stars except I thought the ratio of sausage to ground beef was too high, and instead I would use three parts ground beef and one part sausage.  We found the sausage to be overpowering and to drown out the flavor of the ground beef and other spices and ingredients.   I would also eliminate most of the salt, because there was a lot of salt flavor in the sausage. I would also recommend adding along with the onion that goes into the meatballs, some finally chopped red and/or yellow peppers that adds a wonderful flavor to any meatball recipe.

I made this last week for my hubby who travels a lot and loves home cooked meals when he arrives home. FANTASTIC!  He and I ate and ate and ate some more over the weekend, having the rest tonight. Served over rice and doubled the gravy as suggested. 
Doesn't need any tweaking, except garlic sweated with onions.

I will cook this again.  I cooked this recipe in a slow cooker for 4 hours on High.   I mixed the onion, salt milk, eggs, bread crumbs, black pepper, nutmeg, allspice, ground beef chuck and ground pork together.  I rolled the meat into 2 in balls and fry them in olive oil.  Once done, I put the meatballs into the slow cooker.   I made the gravy just until it was mixed well and than add it to the slow cooker.  I added corn starch in the last hour to thicken.  I made German Spetzle to go with it.

My husband gives this ten stars, my teenage son rates it as 4.5.  My son thinks there is a bit too much of something (probably the unfamiliar nutmeg/allspice flavor) in the meat.  I thought it was delicious other than I would add less water (broth) or more flour to the gravy.  I used better than beef bouillon for the beef broth so it will be easy to cut down a little bit on the water the next time.  So good!!!!!

Even my 3 yr old granddaughter loved it. I can only use ground beef due to pork allergies, but this is the best so far. I did it exactly as written. I will double the gravy though next time.

I like gravy and wanted to serve over noodles so I doubled the sauce portion on the recipe as one of the reviewers had suggested. In retrospect, this was definitely too much. maybe just increase that by half next time? Either way, I thought it was delicious. One of my guests thought it could use some garlic and mushrooms, but she's always a critic. These would make them less Swedish, but I'm sure still delicious. Maybe next time....

Made with 1-1/2 lbs of ground beef. Only used one egg and a splash of milk. Added the nutmeg and allspice as stated. Substituted plain panko for bread crumbs. Did not chill the meat mixture prior to baking. Baked on parchment paper lined sheet. Served over wide egg noodles with ligonberry preserves from Ikea on the side. Very nice presentation and delicious. Will make again.

Love this recipe.  Third time making it, and it's always a big hit.  I added 1 Tbs of flour and 1 Tbs of butter to the gravy recipe to thicken it slightly, but followed the rest to a T.

Thank you, Chef John, for suggesting that we use an ice cream scoop to consistently have meatballs of the same size and save messy hands.  I had so much fun making this!  Even took a picture to show my beautiful meatballs!  Yummy!

So I picked this recipe tonight because I had frozen Swedish meatballs, and I was looking for a recipe to use them with.   I didn't have the heavy cream, so I looked up substitutions and found food.com's version (3/4 c. milk, 1/3 c. butter melted and cooled = 1 cup heavy cream substitute - some people reviewed and added a bit of flour to thicken).  I used that substitution with the extra flour, and found that the gravy still didn't really thicken, so I added a bit of corn starch dissolved in a bit of water at the end and that did the trick almost immediately.  I served this over egg noodles and both my husband and 13 year old liked it.  20 year old slept through dinner, so that review will come later...

This was truly divine! The only problem I had is that my gravy didn't really thicken well at all.  I finally ended up mixing a little   cold beef broth and cornstarch then added to get it to the consistency I like. Served over broad egg noodles, YUMMY! 
NOT friendly on the waistline at all, but totally worth the cheat!
Thanks so much Chef John! :)

I made these for my Dad and he said they were "perfect". I followed the recipe exactly. At first I was worried that the allspice and nutmeg would be overpowering but the taste was very subtle. I served this over buttered egg noodles. Thanks for another great recipe Chef John:)

I was told these were the best meatballs my guests ever had. I served over a risotto and they were perfect. I didn't keep them refrigerated for a full hour, but I don't think that had a negative effect. Highly recommend!!

This was sooooo good!  The only change I made was that I used One pound of ground beef and omitted the ground pork. I cut the rest of the meatball ingredients in half accordingly. Made the gravy exactly as written but had to add about two extra tablespoons of flour to thicken as it was way too thin.  Amount of gravy was perfect for the meatballs that one pound of hamburger made. Will definitely make this again and again.

My older boys loved these. My little boys thought they were too spicy. I thought these were fantastic. Looking at the spices I had my doubts I would like nutmeg, allspice, and cayenne but these were perfect.

I never had Swedish meatballs until I tried this recipe. Followed it exact and it is delicious! Hopefully I can try some Swedish meatballs somewhere else so I can compare the flavors.

I tripled the gravy, but for some reason it didn’t thicken up well. I just whisked in a cornstarch slurry before serving, and that did the trick. Good flavors. Served with mashed potatoes and squash.

Flavor of meatballs was very good, I will be a little heavier on all of the spices next time, my preference.  I did find that there was meatball schmootz in the gravy after transferring meatballs to the gravy.  Next time, I will keep the two separate.  Will definitely make this again!

I was out of W. sauce, so I just substituted a tiny bit of soy sauce instead. The flavor of the sauce was spot-on, but it didn't quite thicken to my liking. This was probably bc I used half and half instead of heavy cream. All in all, a definite hit!

The whole family loves this. I add mushrooms to bulk it up. And I find I have to cook the gravy for a lot longer to thicken it - at least 20 min or more

These were very good.  I double the recipe and had to add more spice.  I also used part ground beef and buffalo ground meat.  They were a little dry because of the buffalo, but being in the sauce you couldn't really tell.  They were a success at the party.

I've never made or tried Swedish Meatballs before and WOW, these were AMAZING! No changes except I halved the meatball recipe (only two of us) but made the full amount of gravy...only because I love gravy! Will be making again. Thanks Chef John! :)

I made these for dinner tonight exactly according to the recipe. The spices in the meatballs really complement the sauce well. I thought the sauce would have thickened up more but it was good none the less. I would definitely make this recipe again!

I made these yummy  meatballs without the red pepper flakes. I served them with pasta and salad. Everyone loved them including the picky kids. I made a double batch and froze the extras. I will be making this again. Thanks for the great recipe.

We had this last night and the whole family said they were best meatballs ever made, but they thought the gravy wasn't as good as other recipes. I think next time I will start the base with some fat drippings from meatballs and the butter and add in sour cream as well. All things considered though it was a great dinner!!

I made this and at first I was skeptical because of the nutmeg and allspice but I decided to try it anyway. I've made swedish meatballs using the package ingredients a few times it was ok but not great. I made the sauce with beef concentrate broth and used milk, no cream on hand, I figured this would compensate for no cream. It did. I also had put in mushrooms because I needed to use them up. This was so delicious!

I made this with ground  chicken as this is what I had on hand.  I also used sour cream instead of heavy cream; again this is what I had on hand.  We loved it! I did find it a little salty and next time I will used sodium reduced broth.  I agree with others about timing of the gravy,  next time I will make when meatballs are baking.  Easy and delicious recipe! Served with a mixture of mashed potato, sweet potato and cauliflower.

The sauce tastes wonderful, but I made up a buerre marne[soft butter and flour] to thicken the sauce a little. Sauce was still runny, and I used less broth than called for. I added a little more nutmeg and allspice to the gravy for more flavor. I might make again, but I'll be on the look out for other recipes. I also added some of the drippings from the cookie sheet that the meatballs were baking on for more flavor.

very good. we are gluten free and I substituted the all purpose flour with g-free baking mix. I did use 4 cups of beef broth and thickened a bit more with corn starch. I have made it twice and it has been delicious both times.

As always, Chef John does not disappoint with his excellent instructional videos and humorous delivery.  This recipe was awesome...easy to follow and my family of four was over the moon about this dish.  The only thing I changed was to use a meatball blend of beef, pork, and veal that my supermarket carries.  Meatballs were flavorful and tender. It will definitely be added to the "greatest hits" part of my recipe collection.  Thanks, Chef John!

The meatballs were a bit bland. Next Time I will probably double the spices. The gravy was fantastic though.

These were so yummy! The only thing I did differently was that I did not refrigerate the meat. I didn't have enough time for that step, but my meatballs still kept their shape and were easy enough to form. I will definitely make this again.

I served these for a church supper.  I made 4 times the amount and the were gone very quickly!  Putting foil on the pan like the video suggests was very helpful for clean up.  I think I will add mushrooms next time too.

If you like the banquet Swedish meatballs, you're going to love these. Followed the recipe very closely, except I used panko in place of breadcrumbs. I didn't have milk (or much time) so I omitted it and skipped the 1-hour refrigeration. I imagine that soaking the breadcrumbs would only improve the flavor. I absolutely recommend this! can't wait to have it for dinner again tonight.

I added 3 tables spoons cognac, 1/4 table spoon onion powder and 1/4 table spoon garlic powder; omitted the cayenne and added 2 tables spoons soy sauce and worcestershire each to the ground meat,which was ground pork,lamb and veal all about 20% fat and 3 tables spoons rendered duck fat.I also added 1 tables spoon brandy and soy sauce to sauce and wisked in sour cream and lingonberries right into the sauce.It was delicious!

I actually just made the sauce and used IKEA meatballs. I basically used Stella's (the reviewer) sauce recipe but tripled the Worcestershire. It was delicious

Meatballs came out fantastic...  As for the gravy,  A little too thin for my liking.  I simply added a little cornstarch to thicken it up.  I also added a tablespoon of sour cream to the sauce.  That was for my taste.  Overall,  the recipe was pretty  good.

These Swedish meatballs were delicious! I only had ground beef on hand so used 2 lbs of that and I was out of bread crumbs so dried out some bread slices in the oven and crushed. Will definitely be making this again, thank you for sharing Chef John!

Perfect! I will definitely make this again. I made no changes to the recipe and the whole family devoured it.
