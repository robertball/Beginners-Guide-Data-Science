As in all New Mexican dishes, this needed green chili.  Throw a can in to feel like you've really traveled to the southwest.  Another substitution that's worth considering is using crushed tortilla chips instead of tortillas if you don't have any on hand.

This is a FANTASTIC recipe!  I have made it many times and always get lots of compliments.  I have found that the santa fe cooking creme is difficult to find in my area so I often will buy the plain cooking creme and add my own spices of cumin, chili powder, red pepper flake, garlic powder, etc.  But it's an easy, delicious recipe!

This is a great recipe! The flavor was fantastic. I changed only one thing and that was to use a can of Rotel (Mexican Lime and Cilantro) in place of the diced tomatoes.

This was easy and delicious. I added green chiles and used corn tortillas instead of flour, but other than that followed the recipe exactly. Served with cilantro lime rice on the side. It's a keeper! Except it made me really wish I had a margarita! ;)

My husband and I loved this so much!  I'm sure it would have been great as is but I used Rotel instead of diced tomatoes and couldn't find the Philly Sante Fe Cooking Creme so I made it myself by mixing sour cream, cream cheese and green chiles in a saucepan and having it melt into a sauce on the stovetop. I mixed that with the first four ingredients and didn't reserve any additional sauce for the top - didn't need it. I also seasoned the chicken with chicken taco seasoning. Finally, I used corn tortillas instead of flour.  I usually don't like when someone reviews a recipe they've changed so much but really I believe it would have been great just as is.  I just swapped the corn for flour tortillas and used some additional seasonings.  I imagine we'll make this a few times a month!

I didn't use the onions, but did add corn for color.  The recipe made too much filling; I only needed half.  It wasn't very spicy, I'll use rotel tomatoes with green chilies next time.  Overall, very tasty, very easy.

Arg I bought the wrong philadelphia and bough the Italian. So I used Monteray jack cheese and garbonzo beans. I used fresh sweet grape tomatoes and they all loved it. I'm still going to try it this way!

I have made this several times and my husband really loves it. I have made a few changes. I use 1 lb. boneless skinless chicken breast cut into bite size pieces. I pan fry until its no longer pink. Add first 4 ingredients to chicken, plus one(4 oz) can diced green chili's and 1/4 cup chopped cilantro. I also use 8 inch tortillas and 1 cup of cheese. I use a deep dish pie plate and follow directions spreading one and 1/2 cups chicken mixture 3 times and 1/3 cup cheese 3 times. (The last time I made this, I tried it in the microwave for 25 minutes covered at 30% temperature. It came out GREAT.

This was not what I expected. It was not awful and I would make it again. I would use white onion instead of the green next time. I will make with out the tortillas and serve with them on the side or chips. I think it would make a wonderfule dip or stuffing for the tortilla.

This was an easy and tasty recipe. I chose to layer the ingredients, placing a flour tortilla in between layers, instead of mixing them all together.  I also did not use the Philadephia Cooking Creme. Instead, I used about 1-1.5 cups of chicken broth, and melted a block of cream cheese in a sauce ban, using a whisk, until creamy.  I added to that about half a package of taco seasoning and removed it from the heat before folding in some sour cream to get the desired consistency of creaminess.  It was a cinch to make and the kids approved. :)

Definitely on the bland side. Needs some green chilies and/or jalapenos, or instead of canned tomatoes, use salsa. We'll eat this batch with salsa and know better for next time.

I added sweet corn and used corn tortillas instead of flour, and served this with sour cream. It was so good and even better the next day for lunch. Will definitely be making this again!!!

Great recipe for a cold day.  I used Rotel tomatoes with cilantro and lime and corn tortillas and the whole family enjoyed it.
