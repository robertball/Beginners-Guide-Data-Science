I thought this was fantastic!  I live in New Orleans and believe the taste to be authentic.  Due to previous reviews about it being too runny, I drained the tomatoes (I used diced tomatoes with onion, celery, and green peppers).  I omitted the pepper (my family doesn't like them), and added 4 or so cloves of sliced garlic (a must!).  I used Tony Chachere's seasoning, and only 1/2 tsp. cayenne and I thought it was perfect, but some (like my mother-in-law who is very sensitive), might find it a big spicy (nothing a little sour cream on top won't fix :D).  Finally, I planned on adding rice directly in the crock pot, but it turned out to actually be too dry (may be because it cooked for 9 1/2 hours), so I had to cook the rice separately, then stirred it in with about 1/2 cup of extra chicken broth.  So easy, and so good!

I thought this receipe was very good.  My husband says he thought Jambalya should be a little bit more soupy.  I used turkey sausage instead and left out the cajun seasoning because my kids will not eat anything with alot of spice.  I cooked the rice seperate and then mixed it together.  This says it is a serving for 12 (but it made 17 cups for me) enough to have it again for another night.  

I am putting down information if anyone is interested and this is based on what I used.  1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breast (all fat removed), 1 pound sweet turkey sausage, 14 oz canned diced tomatoes with onions, 14 oz canned diced tomatoes with green chilies, 3/4 c frozen tri colored bell pepper strips (diced), 2 c finely diced celery (4 stalks)-(the second cup was an accident-but turned out good), 1 c 99% fat free chicken broth, 1 1/3 c frozen chopped onion, 1 pound frozen shrimp, 3 c uncooked rice, 2 tsp dried oregano, 2 tsp dried parsley, 1 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/2 tsp dried thyme  Information based on a 1 c serving (17 servings)Calories 233.2 / Fat 3.9 / Fiber 1.7 / Sodium 582.6

I have never been a real jambalaya fan...but this is the BOMB!  I love the combination of chicken, sausage and shrimp.  The only things I do different... I don't like cooked celery, so I omit that...and I serve it over red beans a rice that I make from a package, instead of plain white rice.  Oh I also use uncooked shrimp and add it a little earlier to the crock pot...cooked shrimp tends to get too chewy.

YUM YUM YUM - always requested...and this year we're having a Cajun themed Christmas of which this dish will be the main meal.

O.k., so it's a little soupy.  But let me tell you, the flavor of this stuff absoultely rocks!! It's as good as any jambalaya I've had anywhere!  And talk about easy!  If the "soupiness" bothers you, put your cooked rice in ahead of time and it will absorb liquid.  Fortunately, I am able to get andouille sausage in Houston, but I would guess that, if you only had access to kielbasa or smoked sausage, you could kick the cayenne up a notch or two and get the same result.  This stuff rocks.  Thanks for sharing it with us!!

This is good! I used 4T. of the Creole Seasoning recipe on this site instead of the seasonings listed (gives much more flavor).I also found that 4 hours in my slow cooker is plenty of cooking time and I don't end up with mush!The last 1/2 hour of cooking I add the shrimp and 2C. of instint brown rice.

My whole family loved this recipe.  I would not cut down on the spices like some suggested.  I don't like things too spicy and this had kick, but was not too hot.  I also would make the rice separate and pour the jambalaya over it.  I tried adding the rice to the crock pot and it absorbed all of the liquid too quickly not allowing the rice to fully cook.

I have had this recipe on my "need to try" list for quite some time and finally got brave enough to try it. I am from Louisiana and know a good jambalaya so I was a bit skeptical. This turned out awesome though! I did a couple of things differently but not enough that it completely changed the recipe. I added the full can of chicken broth (didn't want to waste the little that was left), 1 can of tomato paste, 1 bay leaf, and instead of all the individual herbs/spices I just used 1.5 tablespoons of the Creole Seasoning Blend that is found on the site (I use it a lot already and it had all the same herbs and spices called for in this recipe). I let it all cook on high for about 3.5 hours. I added in the shrimp (uncooked, frozen) and 4 cups of cooked rice and let it cook for another 30 minutes. Perfect texture and consistency. Not soupy at all. I will be making it again!

Flavor wasn’t bad but it was very spicy. Personally I’d call this soup, not Jambalaya. Jambalaya has rice cooked together with the rest of the ingredients and it‘s not soupy. I’ll stick with a more authentic recipe like the “Oven Baked Jambalaya” on this site. And be sure to try the “Creole Seasoning Blend”, also on this site, IT ROCKS! It’s all the Cajun seasoning you’ll ever need.

This was wonderful! I assembled it the night before a company potluck, then took it to work and plugged it in at the office. It cooked on high for 4 hours. I ommitted the shrimp, and in the last 1/2 hour of cooking, I added about 7 servings worth of INSTANT rice to the pot, and let it cook. It was a huge hit!

The only thing I really changed was that I used a Creole seasoning blend in lieu of the seasonings it calls for. It was just easier that way!

My boyfriend LOVED this dish. The spices and flavor were just right. I made this a few months before our trip to New Orleans. We compared this recipe to the jambalaya at the resturants and this one was a lot better. There wasn't any shrimp in any of them-- only chicken and sausage!

 I also added crawfish. Just the tail meat- not the whole animal or the shell or anything. I found packaged tail meat in the frozen fish section at the grocery next to the shrimp. *Make sure you rinse the crawfish meat before you add it! Otherwise it tastes a bit like dirt. But it thickens the stew even more and adds more protein!

Great recipe/base that you can dress up or down depending on your purpose.  For those who have said it's expensive or that there's still a lot of prep time, here is what I do for a last-minute version that makes it cheaper, faster, and more pantry-savvy: Replace broth with boullion+water, use Kraft jambalaya seasoning (comes in a large spice container in the spice aisle), frozen chicken breasts, and 1/2 bag of BirdsEye frozen Pepper Stir-Fry (just red/yellow/green peppers and onions).  I throw all of that plus remaining ingredients in the crock pot, leaving the breasts frozen/whole.  After 8 hours on low, I slice up the chicken and add instant rice and cook 25 more min.  Drops prep time to about 3 min. to slice celery & sausage, and another couple minutes to throw everything in pot.

This version is never quite up to the standards of using fresh veggies, customizing spices, etc. but it is good for something that is no-fuss, and not too pricey.  I don't have kids, but I constantly cook for my boyfriend's friends.  And after working all day I’d rather not waste my time or money making them meals that I slave over with fresh and/or expensive ingredients.  This is the perfect answer for that!

On a different note, to commenter WHATAYAWANT: get a new butcher!!  Andouille sausage may not be as common as italian, but even before this recipe I knew what it was.  And I do NOT cook a lot, nor do I even really like sausage.  Outrageous that a butcher wouldn't have even heard of it.

This recipe is WONDERFUL!  I used tomatoes with onion, garlic and celery as that's all I had on the shelf and increased the Cajun seasoning to 2.5 tsp.  Added the shrimp during the last 20 minutes so it wouldn't get chewy from being overcooked.  Absolutely rocked our Mardi Gras party!!!

Yummy!!! I have made this twice (so far). I love coming home to this cooking in the crock pot because all I have to do after work is make rice then it is time to eat. I usually do all the prep work the night before and keep all the components (veggies, chicken, sausage, liquid w/ spices) separate until the morning when I just throw it in the crock pot. One thing I change is I don't add the shrimp. Also, Tony Chachere's Original Creole Seasoning is fabulous sprinkled on top when serving. EDIT: 19 Nov 07 - I just made this and to solve the "soupy" problem I used a turkey baster to take all the liquid out and used it to make rice in a seperate pot. When I previously tried to add rice to the crockpot it came out undercooked and there was no more liquid to finish the rice. But now after I make it seperatly then mix it, everything is perfect!

Great recipe!  Easy and Delicious.  I made a few adjustments, mostly in method.  I followed the crockery instructions to the letter.  After the chicken, sausage, tomatoes, spices and the trinity stewed all day, I strained out the juices and steamed 3 cups of rice in a steamer with the strained juice.  I sauteed the raw shrimp in butter and garlic and added them and the cooked rice back into the veggie/meat mixture.  Turned out PERFECTLY!  I served it with a big warm slice of cornbread!  I will definitely be making this dish again.

I made it yesterday for a potluck party. Here is the key to success.
1. Use hot andouille sausage
2. It's soup like. But no problem, you take the broth from the slow cooker (before you put the shrimps). Use that broth to cook rice in a rice cooker for a separate pot.
3. Add shrimps to the slow cooker for 30 minutes.
4. Assemble cooked rice and ingredient in slow cooker. Here, you want to take the majority of liquid out from the slow cooker...stir rice in the slow cooker...add liquid back to the consistency you like. I end up throw away some of the liquid...but nonetheless, it's fantastic.

I make this every year for a big crowd during Mardi Gras on the island and it gets rave reviews.  When originally posted on the site it included rice in the recipe but it has since been taken off the list since many people did not prepare properly.  This jambalaya is great if you cook 3 cups raw rice in a separate pot and then stir into the slow cooker at the end.  May not require all of the rice, just add to desired consistency. You can also omit shrimp and add additional chicken and sausage.

AFTER READING ALL THE REVIEWS: I wanted to say Andouille Sausage is REAL easy to find esp. for the user in Houston b/c that's where I live.  MOST major chains (HEB, Fred Meyer, Carrs, Kroger, Randalls) carry it but you have to ask if you're unfamiliar with it.  It tastes SOOOOO much better than the terribly suggested kielbasa/polish and should be a crime to add that as a substitution. lol  I personally think plating rice THEN the jambalaya is your best route so you don't add all those unnecessary sodium/calories from the soup.  Had no celery so didn't add or miss it. Definitely drain the tomatoes b/c I heavily drained mine & still had plenty of soup.  I added enough chicken, sausage and OPTIONAL shrimp (cut tails while frozen, rebagged so I can just add in the end but raw can be used if you put it in a tad earlier than suggested) for our family ...doesn't have to be exact at all.  Using 1/4t cayenne gave it just the mild taste we wanted since kids were eating.  I've made this w/o onion or celery & it's fine!  You can't screw this up & best of all... you do it all in a crockpot.  Try Bourbon Chocolate Pie (a cajun dessert) with this dish and you're family will all be wearing sweats and loosening up  their belts!!

Recipe was very good. Will again with a few minor changes. I followed the directions as printed. My only concern is that it was a little to soupy for my idea of jambalaya. I'v had jambalaya in many places and most of it resembles a thick stew. That's just me, the taste was great.

Why do people make changes to the recipe then rate their changes. An honest rating would be to follow the original recipe and rate that!

From past experience I've learned that you get a much better flavor in the slow cooker if you coat the chicken (or meat) with seasoned flour and brown in a pan before adding to the slow cooker. This also helps to thicken the final dish a bit. I alway cut  back on the liquid by at least a third. Also I put the onions/peppers/celery in the same pan I browned the meat for a few minutes just to soften a bit, then add a bit of the liquid to loosen the brown bits on the bottom and put all of the ingredients in the slow cooker and cook as directed. The end result is worth this extra step.

This recipe was absolutely fantastic. No leftovers! I took the hint from several previous comments and added the rice to the slow cooker with 1/2 hour to go rather than clean another pot. Added the shrimp with 15 minutes to go. Rave reviews from all! Colleen rocks!!

This ended up being more "soup-like" then I had hoped, but it had a good taste to it.

I love this recipe as is, with one exception:  TOO MUCH CAYENNE.  The potency of spices can vary tremendously, so maybe my red pepper is unusually fiery.  I'd recommend starting with half the stated amount (a fourth, if you're not so much a spicy food fan), and work your way up from there.  You can always add more; as it stands, I'm now looking for ways to minimize the burn since I just made a double batch of this following the recipe.  Guess I'll have to enjoy this with a beer chaser.  :)

I am having a Mardi Gras Party soon so I wanted to find a recipe for the slow cooker, much easier that way. I decided to try this ahead of time to see if it was any good. My husband and I loved it! I followed pretty much most of the recipe except I left out green pepper and used Zatarain's Creole seasoning, 2 1/2 tablespoons instead of the Cajun and cayenne pepper. It had just enough heat for me. I cooked it on high, added 2 cups of rice along with the shrimp after 3 1/2 hours, and let it simmer for another 25 minutes. It was perfect. Can't wait to see how it rates with the guests at our party. This is a keeper.

i'm giving this 5 stars because this is really good! being from south louisiana (GOOO SAINTS!), i must say this is not a jambalaya as jambalaya has the rice cooked in. only change i did was to make 50% of the tomatoes rotel (just because we like hot) and added rice about 2/3'rds thru the cooking. some reviewers mentioned doing this and resulted w/raw or mushy rice. probably depends on the slow cooker - i set mine on high and the whole dish was finished in about 4 hours. did add more garlic. thanks for an AWESOME recipe!!

An instant hit!! I'd never cooked cajun type food before, so I followed the recipe fairly closely. My three changes, due to what I had on hand: 1) Spicy sausage not andouille; 2) Omit bell pepper - makes mom sick; 3) Smaller can of diced tomatoes and a tiny can of tomato paste rather than the one big one. I think the spicy sausages made up for the lack of peppers. We have a range of tolerance in the family - mom and I thought it was good, but definitely a clear-your-sinuses-have-a-drink-handy level; hubby and dad thought it was fairly mild, but not lacking flavor. At the end of the day, everyone loved it and it will be a family go-to for the slow cooker from now on!

This is amazing!!! I used Portuguese chourico sausage (not spanish chorizo, although that would work as well, as would linguisa) and it was awesome. Chourico has a lot less fat compared to andouille, which equals a far less "greasy" dish. I also used 2 pounds of shrimp instead of 1. I browned my chicken and sauteed the veggies as I was short on time. Also, I sauteed my sausage first to cook off some of the fat and I patted it with paper towels before adding to the slow cooker. Browning/sauteing the ingredients first allowed the dish to be done in 3 hours on high. In place of Cajun seasoning I used Emeril's Essence as it had the same ingredients as Cajun seasoning. Unless you like SUPER spicy cut the cayenne pepper down to 1/4-1/2 tsp which is what I did. Also, I used a few sprigs of fresh thyme in place of the dried. I use my slow cooker all the time and I have to say this is the best dish that has ever come out of it, hands down!!

I give this a five star because it was so easy- perfect slow cooker meal on a busy day. I don't think it was too soupy at all. At end of cooking time add about 2 1/2 cups of cooked rice.  This will absorb some of the liquid and flavor the rice. I only added 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper so my little kids could eat it.

This was PERFECT. However I do admit to 2 minor additions. I browned the chicken prior, then sauteed the pepper, onion and celery in the sausage juices for a couple minutes before adding to the Rotel tomatoes in the slow cooker on Low. 5-6 hr later I used a ladle to scoop out 2 cups or so of the jamalaya broth, added another cup of water to that and threw it in the rice cooker with 2 cups of jasmine rice (only kind I have on hand most of the time). Added the shrimp to cooker. Once rice was done I mixed it back into the Jambalya (the rice was tasty all by itself from the stock!) I tasted it and it seemed to be missing tomatoe chunks and flavor to me, so I scooped out the excess broth (which was about a cup or more) and simmer that with a box of Romi chopped tomatoes for about an hour while I got ready for work. Once it reduced I added mixed it up with the Jambalya and that made it absolutely PERFECT and soooo tasty!!! No more excess liquid after that. Everything was just right =) Just finished eating both servings in one sitting (I work 13 hour shifts) because it was sooo good after sitting in the fridge and reheating I couldn't help myself!!! Yum Yum Yum!!! Next time I think I will cut back on sausage and add a little more shrimp or chicken just due to personal preference. Oh, and add a bay leaf =) Will be a staple Jambalya recipe in my house! Thank you Colleen!

For a slow cooker recipe I thought this was great. I did make a few changes though. I used 3 cups of diced fresh tomatoes instead of the canned diced tomatoes. I also added 8oz tomato paste and did not add broth. I did add about 1 T knorr chicken bullion with spices as well as 2 small grated hot chilies. I didn't have regular onion so I sliced up several scallions and chopped up half a bunch of cilantro which I added at the end with the shrimp. due to others on the site mentioning that the recipe was "mush" I set my slow cooker for 5 hours on medium. I stopped the cooker at 4.5 hours and added the shrimp, scallion, cilantro and about 3-4 cups hot cooked rice. mixed it up and let the whole thing sit on off for about .5 hour. It was very good. I think I could have gotten away with cooking the jambalaya 4 hours as the chicken was a touch overcooked

Very good recipe.  You can "trick" it up or scale it down to suit your taste and availability of ingredients.  My Cajun friend says cooking the rice WITH it is the main difference between jambalaya and gumbo (and no roux)!  This is a real winner, go to the head of the class Colleen.

This was delicious. I couldn't find andouille sausage so I used mild Italian. It was watery so I added a small bag of Vigo yellow rice into the crockpot in the last hour. PERFECT!! It was a hit. I didn't think that it was too spicy at all. Although, I probably used a lot more meat than this recipe calls for...we'll be making this again for sure!!

This is a favorite in our house! To help with the soupiness, I add 2 cups of uncooked instant brown rice when I add the shrimp. This usually makes 2 full meals for my family of 4 (but my children are only 2 and 4). I just froze it for the first time and while it wasn't as good as the first time, it still tasted great!

This recipe might taste good, but it's not jambalaya. I have lived in New Orleans and can assure you that jambalaya is a rice dish - not a stew served over rice. It is the creole/cajun equivalent of paella.

Being a stay-at-home dad, I'm always on the lookout for slow-cooker recipes. This one is superb! I did use chicken thighs instead of breasts because I had some in the freezer. Also, I used 1 3/4 lbs. of andouille simply because I love the taste. 
My daughter made some cornbread to accompany the dish. It's almost as good as my slow cooker pozole I posted a few weeks ago. : ) I will definately make it again!

This recipe was super easy to make a delicious!  To be honest, I didn't use the seasoning like it was written though.  What I did was I made my own cajun seasoning and just added that.  I got the cajun seasoning from Emeril's recipe.  I also added some red pepper flakes.  I also used boneless skinless chicken thighs instead of chicken breast as it is a darker meat and adds a richer flavor, but it would taste great with chicken breast as well.

I am shocked that some people complained this was too spicy....it's jambalaya...it's supposed to be spicy!  If you want to cut down on the spice, use a milder sausage and less cayenne pepper.  I didn't have an issue with it being too soupy.  I did cook it in a 4 qt. crockpot.  If you use a crockpot that's too big, I think that could cause it to bee too saucy.  

I also made my rice separate and found that it tasted even better the next day.

Ingredients look ok but I am from New Orleans, my parents are from NO, my parents parents are from NO.  This is more like Gumbo than jumbalaya.  Jumbalaya is not liquidy, or soupy.  You should think of jumbalaya as more of a cajun rice pilaf made with veggies and meat.

Excellent flavor, and very easy. I too have made jambalya the traditional way many times and prefer the rice cooked in  rather than added at the end as the recipe. So I added an additional 2 cups of broth and 1 1/2 cups of brown rice during the last hour. After it was done i turned to the warm setting as our dinner was an "eat when you want" style that night. The rice became mushy and overpowered the favors. Had we ate it right away, it probably would have been fine. Next time I will simply add cooked rice to the bowls prior to serving, or I may try cooking the rice, cooling completely, and then adding into the pot when I add the shrimp.

4 1/2 stars! I followed the base recipe to a "T". Par-boiled some rice in chicken broth and added it with an hour left to go. Used fres RAW shrimp added 30 minutes before serving with the slowcooker turned on warm. Absolutly wonderful!

Wonderful! I cooked it the full 8 hours on low and then added cooked rice (traditional Jambalaya is a dry dish where the rice is cooked into the dish). I then waited half an hour, added the shrimp, and let it cook another half hour. So my total cook time was approx. 9 hours. Being from Louisiana I was a bit skeptical to try this b/c it looked too soupy, but it was perfect once I let all the liquid cook out!

This is indeed delicious, but definitely a little watery. I adjusted it by using bouillion cubes and only adding 1/2 cup of water instead of 1 cup. Definitely a keeper though.

Excellent and spicy / make rice seperate and pour over rice. I used fresh raw shrimp with no tails and added 15 mins before serving.  I made previous day then reheated on stove top, it is then that I added shrimp.  Turned out great / made for Mabry's get together  3/12/11

This was excellent. My oldest boy LOVES jambalaya but my two younger children do not like it as spicy so I cut out the cayenne and added about 1/2 tbsp more of cajun seasoning. I also added frozen uncooked shrimp in about 45 minutes before time to be done and cooked my rice half way in the rice cooker and when I added it in it soaked up the rest of the juices and made the jambalaya just right. Turned out excellent. Thank you for a great recipe...so much better than store bought.

Followed the recipe as directed and it was a hit.  The only changes I made was using turkey sausage and I added half a cup of rice with half a cup of broth and half a cup of water to cook it in and it turned out wonderfully.  Bon appetite!

I really don't know why this has such a high rating. this does not resemble a classic jambalaya. I was skeptical about the rice not being added and was right. In a classic jambalaya the flavors are strong and the rice has soaked up the tomato juice. This recipe was soup and I DO NOT recommend this.

used exact above recipe, cooked about 3.5 hr on high, added rice about 45 min before done, shrimp 30 min before finished. would use 1-1.5 cup of rice.   rice gets rid of most liquid for right consistency.

I made on stovetop because of time, and made a few adjustments.  Seasoned cubed chicken with salt and chayenne and cooked in heavy skillet, removed.  Sauted onion, pepper, & 2 cloves minced garlic for a couple minutes, then put all ingredients together in same heavy skillet (minus additional cayenne and cajun because it was spicy enough for my taste), and simmered on low for about 90 minutes.

This was a very easy yet tasty dinner. I'm a fan of anything in the crockpot! Next time I would leave out the shrimp out of personal taste. I know that's not a true jambalaya though!!

It's easy and good. What more do you want out of a crockpot meal! I changed very little. added 1cup of rice at 6 hours and raw shrimp at 7 hours. It is perfect and ready to serve at 8 hours.

This tasted pretty good as is (I did omit the celery), but after some thought I realized what was missing: the roux! So in a separate pan I melted some butter and added flour and slowly heated until it turned a medium brown (about 20 min, while the rice cooked) and poured that into the mixture. It thickened up and darkened the sauce and added a richness to the flavor. I served it over rice and everyone had seconds and thirds.

I'm sorry, I'm easygoing, and I only like to post good reviews, but I have to say this recipe was a big let-down.  I followed it exactly and set the slow cooker to 4 hours on high.  It was soup. I had to serve it with a slotted spoon :(  That's not what I'm looking for in a jambalaya.  I think I should be looking for a recipe that incorporates a roux.  I love sauce, and this was just watery.  The flavour was okay, but again, I was even disappointed considering how much seasoning went into it.  Could barely detect the heat!

My family liked this recipe.  I left out the green pepper because the rest of my family doesn't like it.  I also cut the cayenne pepper in half, again because most of my family doesn't like spicy food, but it was still spicy enough for them.

I love this recipe!  It's absolutely delicious!  I pour it over Jasmine or Basmati rice and my family loves it!  I've made it several times now.  I couldn't find the andouille sausage so I used a sweet Tuscan sausage, and sometimes I leave out the cayenne pepper for people with a low tolerance for spicy foods.

This Jambalaya was the bomb!  I cooked mine in a enameled cast iron dutch oven on stovetop (electric).  So I added a half cup extra chicken stock. Put on low at 9:30am and at 3:30 I added4 bags of the instant boil in bag rice.  Just opened and dumped in. half an hour later done.  Not soupy at all. cooked perfectly.  The family loved it.
Live in Philly found andouille sausage at the italian market in south Philly.

This is the most delicious jumbalaya.  I followed the instructions to a t and it turned out perfectly.  However, a couple of things I would recommend: (1) I used fresh herbs: fresh thyme and parsley, which I always think improves a dish; (2) I added a bunch of fresh minced garlic; (3) I also chopped up  a fresh tomato to put in it.  Thanks so much! I will use this one again.

Folks, just for the record, this is NOT authentic Jambalaya ...  
Jambalaya always has RICE COOKED IN THE DISH, it is NOT served OVER RICE.
Jambalaya is not soupy, and does not have sauce.  The liquids in a jambalaya are absorbed by the rice WHILE it cooks.
I've been married to, & cooking for a Cajun (& often his family) for 25 years.  His mother and grandmothers taught ME how to cook many Cajun & Creole dishes, so I do know of what I speak ...
This is more like a thin gumbo (but w/o okra etc) or like a creole, served over rice

My husband is Cajun so I've learned how to make Jambalaya, Gumbo, and Etouffee from his Grandma in Louisiana. When I made this recipe I felt like I was cheating because I know the time and love that cajun recipes take. This was so easy to make and during the day when I would smell the deliciousness that was coming from the slow cooker, I felt guilty. When I started plating this Jambalaya and saw the herbs, meats and sauce dripping down and coating the rice under it, I again felt guilty. But, when I tasted the first bite, my guilt went away. This Jamabalaya is wonderful and I still can't believe it came out of my slow cooker. For the Cajun seasoning I used the "Creole Seasoning Blend" from this site which I recommend. I will be making this many times.

It has good flavor, and would have gotten another star except for that fact that it is NOT JAMBALAYA.  Jambalaya is rice cooked in a liquid until the liquid and it's flavors are absorbed by the rice.  New Orleans style jambalaya has tomato making the rice a redish color, while Cajun jambalya is brown.  This dish is more of an etouffee, (stew), but without using a roux.  A good dish and extra points for using the trinity, just not a jambalaya.  BTW: I'm reading where people think jambalaya is soupy!  Jambalaya is not soupy, if it is you are doing it wrong! (Some non-Louisiana natives must have came up with that concept.)

This is a really great recipe with authentic Cajun taste! Everyone I've served it to has LOVED it! It does have some kick, so if some don't like spice, you might want to tone down the cayenne. 

Some have mentioned that it's a bit soupy. My solution to this is to add some frozen, chopped okra to the crock pot. Okra has a wonderful flavor that is common in cajun cooking. It also tends to thicken dishes as it cooks and breaks down. Some uncooked rice an hour or so before completion would also thicken...

My husband and I didn't like the recipe at all as it is written. I salvaged it by making a roux and adding that to the jambalaya after it was done. The roux blended the flavors and enriched the taste, but even so, I will never cook this recipe again, with or without the roux. I will try other recipes to find one our family enjoys.

I would give this 10 stars if I could.  I love spicy food, but I cut the cayenne pepper by half to better suit my family,  It was still spicy, but delicious.  If you don't like spicy, I would recommend omitting the cayenne pepper.  The only other thing I did differently was I used instant rice and I added it in the crockpot at the end and just let it simmer for amount 20 more minutes until the rice had fluffed up.  This is a very, very good jambalaya recipe. Definately a keeper.  Being a native of Louisiana, I know good jambalaya!!!!

Made the recipe as outlined substituting Smoked Ham Kielbasa as there was no Andouille sausage in town. Wife loved it, kids loved it, in laws loved it, dog loved it. I'm not a fan of spicy food, but this had just enough heat to make it good. Will be making this every couple weeks for sure.

I have made this and could not have been more pleased. I jazzed up the spices a bit and put quinoa in for the last 40 minutes because that's the way I like it. Wow it moved to the top of the leader board. My favorite.

The husband and I ate this last night and loved it!  I was a little apprehensive at first because we're both fairly picky when it comes to Cajun food.  As in, it needs to taste like our relatives in Louisiana made it. This was really, very good and will definitely be making it again! I used a deer/pork sausage instead of andouille and a subbed a can of rotel for the diced tomatoes and added a bit more broth to the pot. It is more soupy than traditional jambalaya, but when combined with the rice and all the flavors, it was not a problem for us at all.  Especially since it's something so easy to make during the week.  We are eating it again for dinner tonight and I honestly can't wait!
Update:  The last few times I've made this, I use bone in chicken thighs and cut up everything the night before, throw it all in a bowl and mix the spices in.  It's definitely made a difference for the better.

very good but 6 hours on low was probably plenty.  The chicken would have been overcooked otherwise.  After cooking for 6 hours, I drained 3 cups of juice/broth and made rice in separate pot and then poured the jambalaya over the top of the rice when served.

This was okay, it wasn't the best jambalaya I've ever had.  We cooked raw shrimp in butter and seasoning and then added it after the jambalaya was done so it wouldn't be overcooked.  We also fried the sausage in olive oil before adding it to the slow cooker too.

My husband, who is always the skeptic when trying new recipes, declared that this better be as good as the jambalaya he had in New Orleans - and he had to admit that it was!!  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  The only change I made was to add about three small cloves of fresh garlic from my garden.  Delicious - I ate it for lunch all week!

I think this may be the best thing I have ever cooked! I leave out the chicken and double the shrimp. I agree with other reviewers that it is a bit thin on the first making, so I drain off some of the juice of the can of tomatoes to make it less soupy. I garnish with chopped green onions, and serve over brown rice. My side is boiled white corn cobs also spiced with Cajun seasoning. Thank you, thank you, thank you Colleen!

Eveyone loved it.  I did not add the rice but made it on the side so everyone could add if they wanted to.  I made one strictly white rice and one with the leftover tomato juice.  The tomato juice rice was gone!  Had lots of the regular white rice leftover.  There was a lot of juice that I removed even though I drained the tomatoes really good and I did not use the chicken broth.  I think next time I would brown the sausage and chicken before adding.  However it was great and will be making it again.  Love the easy slow cooker recipes!

Outstanding Flavor ! 
As Written it was a bit soupier than I care for, but by adding cooked rice with the shrimp was the ticket.

I agree with the reviewer that said this recipe deserves 10 stars.  It is fabulous and I think the spices are a perfect combination. The consistency to me is perfect when served over rice (we used brown rice for more texture). We add a little more cayenne pepper since we like thing hot and spicy but other than that I didn't change the spices any.  The only other thing I do is this: I have found that if I put the chicken breast in at the first, it turns out tasting dry and tough.....not sure why but  when I made it last night, I sauteed the chicken in some olive oil and added it with the shrimp at the end.  It was better that way but I think next time I might use dark meat instead.  But all in all, this is one of my favorite recipes.  I can't eat just one serving........have to go back for seconds it's so good.  Thank you for posting this delicious recipe.

This is a great recipe the entire family enjoyed.  I used leftover chicken, pork and turkey kielbasa. I also added an extra green pepper and a yellow pepper, in addition to another small can of diced tomatoes.  The seasonings were perfect, although I didn't use the cayenne.  Added 1 1/2 cups of instant brown rice the last hour in the crockpot.  Thank you for a fantastic recipe.

my husband and I tried this as our first time ever making jambalaya. the recipe was easy even though there were many components. It was really good and so simple to put together, no long wait to eat it either. I made 2 mistakes (which I will correct next time) i used the exact amount of cayenne (we love spicy foods and eat them often) yet the heat was really really hot almost to the point of ruining the whole pot. i solved this by adding a bit of rue (flour/water mixture), sugar and half a potato. My other boo boo was adding the entire amount of sausage. It was overpowering in the bowl but gave the broth a very rich flavor. I will use half the cayenne & half the sausage but I will make this again. Thanks to the recipe submitter, it was well worth it.

I followed the recipe to a T and the chicken got way too dry in the crock pot for so long. The flavor really didn't wow me either.

so delicious and very filling.  I'm really watching my calories and I thought one serving of this looked small, but I was definitely very full.  I love spicy food, and I thought the seasonings in this were perfect, but I could see how depending on what Cajun seasoning you use, it could get overly spicy real quick.  Great recipe, thanks!

I made this recipe for my family for supper, and let me tell you, I have never had a meal go over as well as this one. Instead of the sausage, I used kielbasi (Our store did not have andouille sausage) and I served the jambalaya over a bed of white rice. I also added black beans and corn. The leftovers barely lasted the next morning, and may even have tasted better (sitting all night allowed all the flavors to blend even more) I will definitely be making this again and again, it's so simple and absolutely delicious. Even my sister who is a picky eater had seconds.

My husband and I loved this!  I added the diced tomatoes with the chiles in it for some extra kick along with a little chili powder.  I served it over brown rice.  I don't agree with another reviewer's assessment that this was hard to make - it wasn't at all and had a great flavor.  We had left overs and ate them the next day - even better when the spices have more time to set in.  I'll definitely make this again!

This recipe was great, even though I left out the Cajun seasoning (only because I couldn't find any at the store). I will definitely make this again, this time WITH the seasoning and I'm sure it will be even better.
Also, I made 2C rice separately and stirred it into the jambalaya at the very end, and I would definitely recommend doing that.

Very good.  Most of the kids loved it and rated it 5 stars.  Hubby thought I should cut back on the tomatoes next time.  Though, my chicken got done sooner than the green pepper and celery (and they were chopped small), so I spooned the chicken out and left it out for the last hour of cooking.

I'm giving this 4 stars only because my chicken came out dry.  Unlike many reviewers, my jambalaya didn't come out too watery.  I'm not sure why, but maybe it had something to do with the amount of juice that was in the tomatoes.  Otheriwse, the recipe was great.  I added some cooked rice at the end.

It's got a good flavor, but it's not jambalaya. I would describe this as a cajun-inspired soup or stew. It's got a much more watery texture than jambalaya, because jambalaya incorporates a roux or file to make it thicker. The photo for this recipe shows it served with rice, as it obviously should be, but it's deceiving because the texture is much more soupy - closer to a gumbo. I also think if this was more spicy it would also add more authenticity. I added some crystal hot sauce to mine. I think the key to making this work is finding a really good andouille. Luckily our supermarket had some. It's a good idea, and not altogether bad tasting, just can't rate it higher because it's not what it claims to be.

I did not like this dish at all. After reading all the reviews I was expecting it to be really spicy and full of flavor but WRONG! I love spicy food and this was no where near of being spicy. It was very soupy so I took the advice from one of the post and added 1 cup of rice. I should have added the most 1/2 cup because the dish ended up not to my liking.

We felt this recipe was mediocre. It needs some adjustments to spice it up. Otherwise, it is very bland and take like stewed tomatoes.

Delicious! Wanted a good recipe for Jambalaya that I could adjust for a low sodium diet. This worked great. Added the shrimp at the end along with precooked brown rice  - just needed a few minutes to warm through. Didn't have andouille, subbed organic kielbasa instead. Perfect - thanks so much for sharing!

This is one good dish! It smelled so good while it was cooking, and it tasted so much better! We put it on a nice bed of rice and topped it with a small dallop of sour cream and enjoyed the spiciest meal of our lives in bliss. Great leftovers as well. Loved it so much we aren't even waiting a week to share this one again with extended family.

I had never made Jambalaya before so this was very rewarding and delicious! However, I had to tweak it to make it my own. I added about a 1/2 cup of sour cream at the end and used only about half a cup of the chicken broth. Also I put more cayenne in the mix, and used a premade spice mix that was for jambalaya then added two cloves of garlic. Ok, so I didn't completely make a new recipe:) This was a great starting point and I absolutely loved it as did my husband. We were both pleasantly surprised at my first try at Jambalaya so thank you for giving me a great recipe to start with!

LOVE IT!!  The second time I made this, I changed the chicken breast to cut up chicken thigh meat - it did not dry out like the breast meat - also, added 1 cup diced smoked ham with the other ingredients.

We served this at a New Orleans Saints Super Bowl party.  It was easy to make and everyone loved it.  I add extra vegetables to any dish whenever I can and with this recipe you can easily add more peppers, onions, and celery; for these items I did about 1.5x what the recipe asked for.  The spices seemed to be the right amount; you could taste it and know it's there yet it wasn't too spicy.  There have been several conflicting reviews on this recipe regarding "spiciness."  This makes me think it's more related to which andouille you choose rather than the actual spices in the dish.  Also, some people have said this recipe was too watery; even with the added vegetables.  We found the consistency to be excellent for placing over rice.  The jambalaya did cook much more quickly than I was expecting.  It was done after about 4 hours on low.

This was a big hit at my friend's birthday party. I made a double recipe since I have a very large crock pot. To make it a bit healthier I added 2 small cans of tomato paste. I couldn't locate the andouille sausage and was told you could substitute hot links or kielbasa. I chose to do a bit of both sausages. Also I pre-cooked my chicken so was sure it was all cooked through.  I thought I had cayenne pepper but I only had chili pepper. Nobody noticed the difference. For the onion and bell pepper I used fresh pre-made pico de gallo. You get a little cilantro and jalapeno in there but it worked well with the flavors and I didn't have to cut up the veggies. Some of my friends don't like cooked celery but I like the flavor so I put in whole stalks and scored the back. I think it worked well. There was only 1 cup left. I definitely recommend trying out this recipe.

This was a very good SOUP. I say this because there was no gravy (roux). I followed the recipe to the letter. Mine cook 4 hours. The vegetables were crisp which was great. Cut the chicken up smaller, not 1''. I will make it again but I will add roux, or flour gravy at the start of cooking.

I didnt like this. My chicken came out  really dry and I didnt think the shrimp belonged at all. Maybe it's just my slow-cooker but everything came out mushy. Sorry not one I'm going to make again.

Very easy and very tasty recipe. I cooked this for my baby who is from Louisiana and was told it was very authentic tasting. I didn't have the special sausage so i replaced that with a polish sausage instead. I also substituted the cooked shrimp for raw ones that i put in during the last 30 minutes. i cooked mine on high for 4 hours. I will definitely make it again! Oh and ps i can not eat a lot of spice so throwing in a table spoon of sour cream in mine worked wonders. I feel it did not distract from the flavor just the heat.

This recipe was great - I used to live in New Orleans but now live in Washington DC.  I threw a "NOLA" party the other night and made.  As half of the guests were my friends from New Orleans, I was nervous about making this.  Thank goodness - everyone loved it and the dish was gone halfway through the party.  My only regret wasn't making more for everyone.  I also took others advice and threw in the shrimp uncooked.

Way better than expected!  I added the 3 1/2 cups cooked rice to the slow cooker in the end and the consistency was perfect.  4 hours on high .  Loved the heat!!

This is fairly easy to make and very delicious.  The cooking time can be cut a little bit as our chicken was slightly dry, but besides that perfect.  You can have extra spice on hand for those who like it spicier, the amount given is a good middle spot.
We made this for my husband's birthday dinner and friends said it tasted just like the way the restaurant Pappadeux makes jambalaya!

This might taste good, but it's definitely NOT jambalaya!  Jambalaya is a traditional Louisiana dish in which all the ingredients are cooked mixed together, not a rice-and-gravy-type dish.  Sorry!

This dish was sooooo good..!!!  I did reduce the cayenne to half a tsp, so kids can eat it too. At the end, I also mixed in the rice straight into the Jambalaya mixture and let sit for 20 minutes. The rice took a lot of the liquid away and made it just right.  Thank you for this new family favorite..!

I loved this jambalaya.  Read the recipe carefully, the water is to cook the rice, don't add the water to the slow cooker as "MarquetteHeaven" did.

This was very tasty, the only thing I changed was adding minute rice straight into the crock pot about 30 minutes before we were ready to eat.  It helped soak up some of the juice and was a lot easier than cooking a seperate pot of rice.

This recipe was stellar!  The flavor was very good. . .a little spicy, but that's how we like it.  I stirred the cooked rice into the mixture just before serving.  Leftovers were also very good.

Great - I only made two changes out of necessity:  I used diced ham instead of the sausage  and INSTEAD of cooking the rice separately - I added a cup of uncooked Minute Rice at the very end - because this had a huge amount of liquid.  Did the trick!!!  Thanks!!!

This is a great recipe which I have received raves about, and I tell them I didn't create it, I simply cooked it. Not to be mean, but some people have no idea how to use a slow cooker. One of the  properties is to retain moisture so the food does not dry out. Many time people try to take an oven or stovetop recipe and put it right into the crockpot. The problem is that the amount of water in them is expected to evaporate, so enough liquid is added to counter this. If you put in your crock pot you will have way too much liquid, which won't evaporate unless you take off the lid and cook on high for an hour. So, drain the tomatoes, and check on the liquid in the pot, and if it looks too dry, add some of the juice to the pot. When making this recipe like this, and other slow cooker recipes, you can make it as thick or thin as you want.

This recipe was great after making a few major adjustments. (1) season the chicken and shrimp with salt before putting it in the pot. (2) Add four cloves of minced garlic. (3) Add salt to the recipe to make the flavors come out. (4) Double the chicken broth. (5) Cook in a pot, not a crock-pot, cooking the chicken first in 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Then put all other ingredients in, minus the shrimp and simmer for 20-30 minutes. Then, add in 3 cups of rice and the shrimp and cook for ten more minutes. Let sit for 5 minutes, and you have authentic jambalaya instead of a soupy mess.

In agreement with other previous comments that the consistency is more soup-like than stew. 

Could be more on the spicy side, but has a agreeable Cajun seasoning that is indicative of City Creole jambalaya (also called "red jambalaya"/ with tomatoes). 
As traditionally "Cajun" jambalaya, meat and vegetables are cooked separately from the rice in this recipe. 

I served with brown rice and had plenty of left-overs (served 3). Tasters of this meal said the jambalaya tasted better with aging in having left-overs!

Really great recipe, everything works just great, the only thing I will change next time is to cut up the chicken and sausage into smaller chunks.  It had great flavor and was tasty over some rice.

I served it the night it was ready, and had a lot of leftovers so I ended up splitting it up in 2 quart size tupperwares and putting them in the freezer.  I then took them out the next day and popped them out kind of like popping ice cubes out of the tray.  I then threw them into vacuum sealer bags and sealed them up and labeled them and back to the freezer they went.  I just pulled one out after a month and set it in the fridge in the morning to defrost while I was at work.  Popped the bag into a pot of boiling water for 15 min while I was making some rice, and bam, instant no cook meal, tasted as good as the day I made it.  I highly recommend this recipe.

One comment though, is don't mix in the rice ahead of time.  I ate some left overs from the first day this way and it got a tad bland and the rice was mushy from absorbing all the liquid.

I have made this recipe twice following the ingredients listed by the creator.  I noticed that a lot of people are saying the jambalaya is too liquidly.  I agree, so, on the third try, I added cooked rice into the crock pot when I added the shrimp.  It came out perfect.  Brought it to a staff luncheon and am still getting emails for the recipe.

I've made this recipe twice now, and liked it a lot better the second time.  The first time I followed the recipe as written, and found that it was too soupy, even put over rice.  The second time, I followed the advice of several reviewers and pulled out the liquid with a turkey baster at the 3 hour mark, cooking on high.  This gave me just over 2 cups of liquid, and I made just over 2 cups of rice in my rice cooker.  While the rice was cooking, I added my pre-cooked shrimp to the crock pot on the low setting.  When the rice finished, I mixed it back into the slow cooker and served.  This gave the perfect consistency for jambalaya - not too soupy with liquid, not too mushy with rice, and not with undercooked rice.  

I would highly recommend this recipe cooking as I did the second time.  The flavors are good, but I will probably try the suggestion of a few other reviewers and use the Creole seasoning from this website as a substitute for the seasonings in this recipe next time.  Even as is, I will be making this again, but it can't hurt to search for even further improvement!

FABULOUS.... this is the best jambalaya I've ever had!!!!  I followed the recipe exactly.   I made this 2 days in advance, put the entire crock in the refrigerator.  About 2 hours prior to serving,  put it on high and added 1 box chicken broth (2 cans). 45 minutes prior to serving, added 1 box minute rice.  30 minutes prior to serving added the shrimp.   Made this for a luncheon and everyone LOVED it!    THANKS SO MUCH FOR SHARING THIS RECIPE!!!!!

Very good, made for the first time today.  Very spicy, and when I say spicy I mean red hot spicy.  I would tone down the cayenne pepper a bit and/or be careful what is in the Cajun spice.  A lot of blends add cayenne.  But overall very good, very easy, and I used turkey kielbasa so a bit more figure friendly.  I might try a different sausage next time just to see.

I've only had jambalaya once before (in a restaurant) but liked it enough then to try this recipe. I don't know about "authentic" as I'm a yankee, but it sure is delicious!! Andouille sausage was way too spendy so I  used kielbasa - and I cut the cayenne in half. I used "Cajun seasoning" I had on the shelf. In the last 10 minutes I folded in (1-2/3 cup dry) cooked rice and it was just the right amount to soak up some of the juices. The flavor is  so wonderful, and this is a recipe I will be making on a regular basis. Thanks!!

I halved this (everything, chicken, sausage, shrimp, etc). Used frozen thighs. When putting in the shrimp, I broke up the chicken and added a leftover carton of chinese rice. Served it all with a little shredded cheese on top. You'll need to season it to your own taste - for me, that meant super-hot!

I generally do not rate recipes that I alter, but this alteration was out of a missing ingredient and I feel it's missing did not change the overall result.  I did not have enough broth, but as it stands, it really didn't need it as I prefer a thicker Jambalaya.  I also added brown rice to the dish rather than cooking seperately (with about an hour left) and it was perfect.  Used the Cajun Seasoning from this site - yummy dish - and easy!  Makes a ton, freezes quite well.

Mmmm, good!  The flavors in this are awesome!  My hubby and I like things spicy and this fit the bill.  If I was making it for company though I would cut back on the cayenne a little.  

I made it as written and cooked it at my usual slow cooker setting (slow simmer) for three and a half hours and the chicken was over cooked, so next time i will add the chicken the last hour.  I added frozen shrimp 30 minutes before it was ready and that worked great.  

Thanks for a great recipe!

Made this exactly as written, and very good!  Note for those that found it to have too much liquid... Jambalaya is more of a rice casserole... where Gumbo is a Roux based stew that you serve over rice.  So if it's too runny for you... add your rice to the slowcooker and let it soak the liquid up... then it's jambalaya!  Or you can take this recipe and add a Roux to thicken the liquid up and Voila!  You have a nice Gumbo to serve over rice (don't forget to add Okra for gumbo)!  This recipe is excellent either way you want to go with it!

I increased the chicken broth to one whole can and the creole seasoning (Tony's)to 2 tablespoons. I started cooking this on low. After 3 hours the veggies were still crunchy so I was worried I would run out time so I increased it to high another 3 hours. Then, I added 1 3/4 cup of long grain brown rice. It took another 45 minutes for the rice to cook and when it was done I stirred in UNCOOKED shrimp. It only took a few minutes for the heat of the jambalya to cook up the shrimp. With 5 of us, I was expecting left-overs. There weren't any. :(

A spicy but earthy taste.  Next time I will cut the pepper in half.  A bit to hot for the kids.  Excellent dish!  Served it with Zatarains black beans and rice but added a quarter cup of powdered cheddar cheese.  If no powedered cheddar available, shredded cheddar will do too.l  A total cajun meal!

Made this for dinner tonight - it was great!  My hubby raved about it.  Only change I made was to cut the ingredients in half (except the veggies) since there is only the two of us.  Made some rice, picked up some rolls, and ate it up!  Only had a little leftover (for lunch tomorrow for me!)

Definitely drain the tomatoes before adding. I'd also cut down on the cayenne slightly, and I like spicy things.

Guided by comments from previous reviewers, I "tweaked" the recipe as follows: Used a half-teaspoon of cayenne; Did not drain the tomatoes; Shortened the Low temperature cooking time to 7 hours; With 30 minutes left to cook added white instant rice to soak up some of the soupiness.

The resulting dish was wonderful.  Still slightly soupy, but very good.  Even with cutting back on the cayenne the dish was still very spicy.  

I will definitely make this again, but next time will use only a quarter teaspoon of hte cayenne and will shorten the Low temperature cooking time even more to only 6 1/2 hours in total.

I tried the recipe last week & it was wonderful!!! I used smoked sausage instead of andouille and added some scallops as well as shrimp which really brought out the seafood taste.  Like other reviews I had problems with it being a little to runny; so I made a roux and added that and once my rice was cooked I added it to the slow cooker & it turned out great.

This was a great way to impress my friends during the SAINTS game...I even had a few, true Cajuns say it tasted pretty authentic. I used Rotel tomatoes with the chilis in it, and let me tell you, if you like your Jambalaya hot, that is the way to do it. Certainly not a dish for the faint of palate. It's hot y'all!

I used Chicken andouille sausage to cut out some fat and added 3 finely shopped jalapenos w/o seeds.  Yummy!  I have also substituted pheasant.  This is one of the favorite recipes my slow cooker rotation.

This recipe was good but as the DH says in his review of this "it wasn't knock me on my butt good.. but it was good, don't get me wrong". But I'll most certainly be making this again. It was easy, cooked while I was at home and was generally healthy. Winner winner...

This was very good! I left out the shrimp because one of my guests doesn't like shrimp. I also cooked the rice right in the crock pot to help absorb some of the liquid so it wasn't so runny. Other than that followed the directions exactly.

So fast and easy. Went to a local butcher to get the sausage and it was well worth the effort. It added great flavor to this dish. I only used 1/2 of the cayenne pepper, but everything else, as written. I served over minute rice but next time will ad regular rice to the crockpot as suggested by others. I got rave reviews on this....Its a keeper!:)

This is a very easy recipe for the slow cooker.  In my opinion, the cooking time for the low setting is a little long, because the chicken seemed overdone.  Dh and DS went back for seconds.  I followed the recipe exactly, and I served it over brown rice.

I loved the recipe but also found it to be soupy. So, when I made the rice I used the broth from the crock pot. I also add more cajun season and cayenne but I like really spicy food. Plus I added fresh garlic.

So tasty. This was soo tasty. I took the advice of other commentors and left out the juice for my diced tomatoes. It still came out a bit too liquidy so I added a tbsp of constartch and water mixture just before adding my shrimp.

We loved it. Even my fuzzy daughter ate it. It does make alot. We had it for two meals and still had some lunch leftovers. Made with corn bread and it was the perfect dinner to go with an all day marathon of Swamp people on History

Great recipe! I did add an extra can of tomatoes so it wouldn't be dry and added enough extra broth to cook rice in the pot before serving. I did not use the slow cooker. Everyone said how great it was. Thanks for the base recipe.

This took about 15 minutes to throw together in the slow cooker! You can't beat that! Mine cooked in about two hours on high in a new-ish slow cooker. Flavor is good! I used turkey smoked sausage instead of andouille.

Seriously...this dish is deserving of 10 stars..it's absolutely delicious! And soo easy!  I subbed chicken keilbasa for andouille sausage (because it isn't available in my area).  I also don't care for shrimp, so I just doubled up on the keilbasa.  I followed another reviewer's advice, and used the "Creole Seasoning Blend" recipe from this site, instead of the seasonings called for... (4 Tbs.).  About 1/2 an hr before serving, I tossed in 2 cups of instant brown rice.  Three words..To-die-for.  :~)

Good taste, but needed more kick.  Worked well for a variety of people though ~ just put out a bottle of Louisianna hot sauce to go with it.

I cooked this for the firehouse folks as well as home and everyone liked it (which is rare). It has the perfect amount of heat and the flavoring was spot on. A few of us that were sensitive to the heat cut it with sour cream, but that wasn't a necessity as it wasn't overpowering. 
    I made the recipe as written with one exception (which was an accident). I forgot to put in the chicken broth into the crock pot. The consistency was just right for it being served over rice though.

This turned out great! my husband was begging for more! For those people who said it was too soupy, you needed to add  RICE when you add the shrimp in it! it works if the rice is already cooked or if you add minute rice.

I'm not too fond of rating a recipe if its not the exact recipe that is listed.  With that being said, I made NO changes to the recipe, and it was amazing!  My husband was very impressed as well.  I will be keeping this one on hand.  :)

I was in the mood for okra, so I looked up this recipe on my Android while in the grocery store! It gave me the ingredients I needed. I bought thighs and skinned them, (cheaper) cooking them in the crock pot along with the green peppers 3 hours on high. I cooked the rest of the ingredients in a pot and combined with the boned chicken thighs. I added okra. Hubby added the shrimp to his serving as I do not like shrimp. VERY GOOD! I served this in a bowl over rice.

Delicious recipe!! Followed it exactly except reduced the amount of cayenne to 1/4 tsp. for our guests who don't like things hot, but could have added a little more and would have been ok. However, don't know how big the "serving size" portions are, but definitely not enough to feed 12 people. We had just enough to serve 6 guests before everything was gone. Guess that means it was really delicious. I would recommend to double the recipe if you want seconds or have a larger group!! A definite keeper!!

Very good, though my kids thought it too spicy for their taste.  I would change it a little so it was less spicy when I make it again.

My wife texted me after eating this for lunch today "If we weren't married, I'd propose! This is SMOKIN!" The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I haven't had enough Jambalaya to fairly compare it. I did make it exactly according to this recipe, as I always do the first time I make a recipe, and it is pretty soupy although rice does an excellent job of absorbing the juice and flavor. My new-ish slow cooker cooks too fast so the chicken was tough, but the pre-cooked shrimp was actually pretty good, somewhat rubbery as commented elsewhere but not ridiculous and they still carried some of the spices. Speaking of which, this was right on for me, my wife would like a little more heat. (I barely tolerate Jalapenos, for reference.) I also don't know exactly what the Andouille sausage brought, over some over spicy sausage - I'd bet it'd be great with whatever. And a turkey sausage could make this a pretty healthy dish. This definitely gets added to the "Make again" list.

All I have to say is WOW!!! This recipe is amazing. I made it with a side of jambalaya rice and corn bread and watched it disappear like flat screen tv's on sale for $1. A wonderful crock pot recipe.

This was flavorful and easy to make. Two suggestions: add some instant rice when you add the shrimp to soak up SOME of the juice, and make sure you stir it well before serving. All my chicken was lumped up in the bottom, cooked and stuck tog ether, which I didn't realize until I emptied the crockpot after dinner. We  thought the spice was just right.

This was fine. I have another recipe I usually use, but thought I would try this one since it was a slow cooker recipe. I think I prefer my other recipe. This was a little too watery for my taste, though the flavor was nice.

The spicing on this was excellent, not too hot, but spicy enough to make it interesting.  We sauteed the vegetables and chicken in a saucepan first, then put them in the crockpot with the other ingredients.  We used Emeril's Essence as our Cajun spice, and chorizo sausage because we could not find andouille, and Costco's frozen seafood mix with shrimp, calamari, and mussels.

This was one of the first recipes I tried in the slow cooker...it was surprising good!  Since we do not eat pork, I subbed turkey hot italian sausage and added more cajun and chili seasonings.  Lots of ways to add or spice this as much as you'd like.  It's requested at least every other month...more during the winter!

Okay....like many other reviewers have noted, this recipe is NOT for jambalaya - this is SOUP!!!! I was not pleased with the end result. I made everything as written with the exception of the seasonings - I cannot imagine jambalaya simmering without a few bay leaves, plus I kicked up a bit of Tony Chachere's Spice and Herbs Seasoning as well. While the taste was good (which in my opinion was due to my altered seasoning), this was NOT jambalaya. After the first serving, I added a can of tomato paste which still wasn't a TRUE jambalaya, as real jambalaya uses roux or file powder for thickening, but it was as close as possible without going through the trouble of making a roux.

2 star recipe as is, 4.5 stars with the changes I made. I was grateful for a base recipe to use the slow cooker, as jambalaya is pretty time consuming when cooked over the stove.

This recipe was delicious!  It ended up being a bit too spicy.  I agree with some of the other reviewers.  I added ALL the spices and followed the recipe (omitted the shrimp) and I think that is why it ended up too spicy.  I would either just use the Creole seasoning alone and not use the other spices.  However, if you insist on using all the spices maybe cut down the cayenne to 1/4 teaspoon and 1 teaspoon of creole seasoning.  I added the rice separately in the bowls and then added the jambalaya.

This recipe is now on a monthly rotation at home. Quick and easy to mix-up the night before, plug in on the day, then come home to the appetizing smell of fresh jambalaya! I have made this with and without shrimp (depending on how long I can wait before I dig in) and it tastes good either way. I do like the soupy consistency of this recipe. The rice I eat it with, soaks up all the juice!

This is wonderful dish, and you can have fun with it by putting in different meats/fishes...I wouldn't mess with the seasoning/veggies though - the flavor is perfect.  For those who say its' soupy?  add more meat to it. -love it, my favorite from this site so far

Surprisingly great flavor for the few spices and ingredients that go into this recipe.  The end result following the recipe was a little soupy for my taste though.

I also opted to use just the cajun seasoning and this turned out great! I added a can of drained and rinsed black beans. Big hit at my house!

This was yummy! I made the following changes:  used turkey kielbasa, because I could not find andouille sausage, which I added about 7 hrs. into cooking on low heat.  Also, I used raw shrimp, because it was less expensive than cooked.  I added about 1/2 hr. after I added the kielbasa, and they turned pink after about 20 min. of cooking.  I thought the spices were just right, and I like spicy/hot foods.  My husband added a few dashes of hot sauce to his.  Will make this again, and again!

This was the first jambalaya I have ever made and was looking for something different to throw in the crock pot.  It was a huge hit with the family.  The only negative was the sausage turned out a little mushy.

Excellent recipe.  I only had half the diced tomatoes, so I added another 1/2 c of chicken broth for juice.  Cooked it 4 hours on high, and at 3 hours, put in 1 cup of uncooked rice.  That soaks up the extra juice and preps the dish like my family in New Orleans always mde it - with the rich cooked in.

This was excellent for a slow-cooker version of Jambalaya. i put the chicken breasts in whole, then shredded them after they cooked for 4 hours. I didn't have any shrimp, so used 2 lb of andouille. I chopped up one to cook with the rest of the ingredients, and grilled the other pound to slice and throw in at the end. I also added 1 cup raw rice the last hour....i also added the rest of the can of chicken broth. it was WONDERFUL.

I made the mistake of buying the andouille spicy sausage. I should have gotten the regular. A few things I would change on here is, do half the amount of green peppers, onions, and celery. Its too much. I had more green peppers than rice on my plate. Also, its too much heat. I like spicy food, but when its so hot that all you taste is the heat and not the flavor, its a bit much.  I think next time I will do it again with turkey kielbasa and half the amt of veggies and regular seasonings and cajun seasoning. Omitting the cayenne. Its too much.  I drained most of the juice and green peppers and going to mix it with spagetti sauce for next day left overs. Hopefully that will cool these heat down a bit.

This was good.  I used what I had (italian sausage and rotel) which made it extra spicy.  It tastes really good though with those.  If you do this know that the sausage made it a little greasy...I may try to cook and drain the sausage a little next time.  Thanks though...I really liked it.

This is a very simple recipe to prepare. The chicken dried out a bit - I may use dark meat the next time as a result. I will also cut the andouille sausage to 1/2 lb. I like spicy food, but this was way hot! The sausage seemed to dominate the dish. I may increase the shrimp. I used raw shrimp and threw them in with 1 hour to go. They cooked nicely in that time. I served this over brown rice for a hearty and satisfying meal. Thanks for a keeper!+

I am in love with this recipes.  It definitely replaces my old recipe.  The flavors were perfect, even though I only had one teaspoon of cajun spice left.  I ended up adding a little bit of everything that makes up the cajun spice. Also, I used red bell pepper instead of the green because that it is all I had. Otherwise, I made it exactly according to the written recipe.  I made this for Super Bowl Sunday and it was the perfect meal!

Turned off crockpot at 6 hours and stirred in uncooked instant rice and the defrosted shrimp. put the lid on and when the family ate it a couple of hours later it was perfect! thanks for a great recipe.  ps. my kids call it "Jump a laya"  cause its spicy!

Wonderful recipe!  Alot like the one I have been fixing for my family the last couple of years.  Even my 10 year old asks for it all the time.  I prefer it on rice instead of combined with it.  The only thing that makes it better to me is that when its done, I desolve some cornstarch in water and add to the recipe to make the liquid a thin gravy.  Wonderful over rice!!  Thanks Colleen!

Awesome wonderful satisfying jambalaya!  I used Tony Chachere's creole seasoning and a combination of smoked sausage and Andouille sausage.  I recommend sauteing the trinity (onion, bell pepper, and celery) to softness before adding to the slow coooker, and I also added carrots and sweet corn.  Can't go wrong with this recipe!  Serve with warm crusty bread and icy cold beer!

Very good and spicy!  I omitted the celery and bell pepper because my boyfriend doesn't like them, used turkey sausage to make it a little healthier, and added instant brown rice in the last 20 minutes of cook time.  Wonderful, thank you!

I LOVE this recipe!  I did a few things different.  I doubled the chicken and didn't add the shrimp and only used 1/2 the red pepper.  I thought there was a lot of liquid, so when it was time to cook the rice, I took 1 cup of the juice to cook the rice in.  Once the rice was cooked, I added it to the jambalaya.  Then I made cornbread with honey butter.  Mmm, delicious!

I cooked this exactly as it was written, and was not impressed.  It was rather bland, and for the most part tasteless.  The chicken, sausage and shrimp were all over cooked, and the sauce was extremely bland until I added a lot of hot sauce.  This, at least to me, is nothing like authentic Jambalaya from LA.  It was edible, however.

I've tweaked it a bit after all these years; add additional can of drained diced tomatoes, add chicken a little later on (if possible, an hour on high or 3 if on low) and I add raw shrimp an hour prior to finish time.  We like ours a little soupy as my husband dips his bread into the juice but half the chicken broth if you'd like it less soupy.  

This is in response to Katie1217's review on 06/16/09.  If you note, Robin Millers recipe is from 2005 and mine was posted in 2004.  After your comment, I searched her recipe and it is not word for word as you erroneously stated.  Also, I would have to have ESP to post a recipe that did not appear until a year after mine.

I liked this recipe, but didn't love it.  I think the problem was the sausage I used.  I also did not know what andoullie sausage was and couldn't find it so I used turkey keilbosa sausage and didn't find it as appetizing after it sat in the crock pot all day.  But my family and guests liked the recipe.  I made it with whole grain brown rice and a salad.  I loved the shrimp in the recipe and was had tons left over!

An excellent, easy dish.  Prep took less than 20 minutes.  I put 2 cups of rice in about 30 minutes before serving, but otherwise followed the recipe and it was delicious!

My Louisiana husband didn't care for this recipe...he couldn't fathom the idea of cooking the rice separately so when my back was turned, he added 2 cups of rice to the slow cooker...how rude! No wonder it turned out gluggy and wrong. Keep those men out of the kitchen I say! (well, they can do the dishes)

This is another one of the those recipes where the quality of the ingredients selected makes a big difference.  It is spicy (which is good) and the sauce is very thin (which isn't).  I'm not sure if it will help, but I am going to add some tomato paste next time I make this.  Also, it the interest of saving money, the shrimp could be left out, they didn't add much.

This was just ok.  The chicken was very over done. I think chicken sometimes gets almost grainy in a slow cooker, but that is just a personal preference.  It was watery.  I didn't mind it, but I told my husband it was Gumbolaya, to make it sound like it was supposed to be that way.  The flavor was decent.  My husband wouldn't eat it at all.  I make a jambalaya in the oven that is really light, easy, and awesome.  I think I will stick to that recipe.

Ok I just finished licking the bowl (well not really), this was delicious!  I followed suggestions and added a pound of uncooked, peeled shrimp and a 1/2 cup of uncooked rice one hour before the end of cooking time.  I used more rice when I served it, because it is rather soupy.  But some good bread to sop it up goes perfectly!  Also I didn't have cayenne pepper so I used hot sauce instead.  I will definately make this again!

After reading many of the reviews I made the following adjustments. Used Polska Kielbasa sausage (available). Used 3/4 cup of chicken broth. Used 5 yellow chile instead of green bell pepper. Used 20 oz. Hunt's diced tomatos with mile green chile. Added a pinch of crushed bay leaf. Omitted celery (preference). Turned out excellently the first time! Full of flavor and spicy! FH said it was a keeper and just as good as the best he's had at authentic restaurants. 
All ingredients fill the crockpot very tightly. Served with white rice on the side. Recommended as you can use as much or as little of the juice to flavor as wet or dry you like. I will be making this again! Thank you for the recipe!

This was delicious.  I used turkey keilbasa to cut calories and added a couple of tablespoons of tomato paste. I halfed the recipe with no problem. I will definitely make this again, it would be great and easy for company.

My DH grew up in New Orleans...so finding a good Cajun recipe is sometimes challenging.  Well, this one passed the test with flying colors.  He loved it and said it was perfect...exactly the right amount of spice.  The only mistake I made was I added an entire can of chicken broth instead of the 1/2 can is calls for.  Next time, I will only do the 1/2 can to make it just a tad thicker.  Served over white rice with a slab of crusty bread...Yummy!

I tried this out on my new Crock Pot last night, and was very happy with how it turned out. I made only a few small changes to it for my preference, and it turned out perfectly.

I added about 10 oz. of frozen sliced okra, I substituted Healthy Choice sausage for the Andouille sausage (trying to be mindful of calories), Zataran's Creole seasoning (vs. Cajun), and I used 1 14.5-oz can of diced tomatoes with chilies, and one without.
I put all of the veggies in the crock pot first and then created a "well" in the middle for the chicken and sausage so the veggies would cook evenly. I set it on high for 4 hours, and about half-way through, I mixed it all together.

I think the only change I will make next time is to maybe sear the chicken a bit to retain a little more moisture.

We had our annual pool theme party over the weekend, this yewar was Mardi Gras; the jambalaya recipe was fantastic.  I had scaled it for 48, and made 10 cups of long grain rice on the side. Everyone loved it tremendously.  A little spicy, but not overly for anyone to say "NO thanks"...as a few were allergic to shrimps I omitted the shrimps, and increrased the sausage to 1.5 times. This redcipe was great cause it was easy to get ready...since it was too big for my Slow Cooker, I used a Roaster Oven, and cooked it at 250F and 200F most of the day (approx. 7 hours).  All enjoyed it tremendously.  Served with Cajun Ribs, Corn, and many other dishes along with the Mardi Gras King Cake, the parety was ahuge success, all were dressed in Mardi Gras attire.  Wild!

Marvelous!  I took the advice of others and left out the cayenne pepper altogether.  Good thing I did.  Then I used 1 teaspoon of Cajun seasoning and 1 teaspoon of Old Bay.  It was just right! I also decided to brown the chicken and sausage before adding it to the pot.  This was so good I think I'll make it for my next party.

This is the first time I tried making jambalaya from scratch. My husband and I both LOVED this recipe. He actually ended up eating a bowl of the leftovers for a snack that night and more for lunch the next afternoon. I'm sure I will be making this again and again, and the ONLY other thing I would do differently next time is add just a little less cajun and cayenne. Thank you so much for this recipe!

Very very good.  Maybe cut down on the cayenne a bit if you don't like it too hot.  Soupy--more like REAL jambalaya than other recipes I've tried--a bowl is good with a thick hunk of bread.  My husband loved it, and he's pretty picky about authenticity.  This one goes in the Make Often recipe box.  ;-)

Being from Louisiana I can say with confidence that this is not a true jambalaya, which is always cooked with rice, not served on top of rice.  That being said, the flavors were good but a bit too spicy.  I decided to modify the recipe by adding enough water (2 1/2 cups) so that I could add 2 cups of rice.  This also cut the spiciness to an excerptible level.  It turned out great.

I love this recipe! I do however, make a few changes when making it for my boyfriend and myself. About 3 and a half hours into cooking, I take about 2 cups of extra liquid out of the  slow cooker and use that to cook Zatarans Jambalaya rice. When the rice is finished, I dump it all into the crockpot and stir it up! It ends up being absolutely delicious. I cook this about one time per week!

Good, good, good! I cooked mine on stove top for around 2 hours and added rice directly to the pot, which took care of the excess liquid.

Made this today for dinner exactly as directed except I couldn't find any andouille sausage so used hot italian.  This completely fell apart in the pot and so I mostly had what looked like a ground meat soup with some chicken and overcooked shrimp.  I even used uncooked frozen shrimp but still, the 7 - 8 hours on low is way too long for this recipe.  All the meat was way overcooked.  Still, it tasted really good served over rice in soup bowls and we will more than likely finish it off again later this week. It makes a lot.  But next time I make this I'll only slow cook it on low for 4 hours at the most.

This was my first recipe with my new slow cooker.  I think that the recipe will be okay, but as others noted, one does not think of jambalaya as being a liquid that is poured, gumbo-style, over rice.  I guesstimated that after cooking there are probably four cups of liquid (one cup broth, three cups tomatoes, plus whatever moisture came from the breakdown and release of moisture from meat and vegetables), so I added two cups jasmine rice, but it took forever to cook, even on high.  Next time, I would use instant rice or simply ladle the finished mixture over cooked jasmine rice.  Again, I perhaps screwed up the recipe, but the results are not bad.

Good flavor but very watery. If we make this again, we will add tomato paste to thicken it up a bit. Also, we used raw shrimp and threw them in with an hour left.

Made exactly per the recipe. Delicious, but I might cut the cayenne just a little next time. It  overwhelmed the other spices a bit.

i picked this recipe at random.  I never had jambalya before, didn't think I was going to like it, boy was I wrong!!!! It was soooo yummy!! I didn't put as much Cayenne pepper in because my hubby doesn't like it too spicy. It was still spicy tho, glad I didn't put the whole amount in!  I will make again one day!

I know this isn't real jambalaya for all the reasons everyone wrote about. But it is incredibly good!  I've made it for family and friends and everyone loves it. I serve it over rice. Yummy... Highly recommend!!!

DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT add the rice into the jambalaya .... I would suggest cooking the rice on the side In a rice cooker And then combine the rice portion. I will attempt to make again, the flavor was great, I added chorizo into mine and doubled the chicken no shrimp was added (I didn't have)

Wife and I tried this recipe and was sadly disappointed. The flavor was a single note and just wasn't worth eating. I think sauteing the vegetables first and using a wider variety of spices would help immensely.

This was my first time making homemade jambalaya.  It was very good.  Not sure why, but the chicken came out a little tough.  I like mine a little more spicy, so I recommend doubling the cayenne pepper.

I really liked this recipe. It would be a fabulous winter dish. I had a hard time finding andouille sausage, so I used Trader Joe's andouille chicken sausage. It's pretty good and it saves some calories. I took another reviewer's advice and sauteed the shrimp briefly in olive oil and garlic before adding it to the slow cooker. I left out the celery and added some rice at the end that I cooked using the juices from the dish. Worked out perfectly!

Flavor was excellent.  I used cooked andouille because that's all I could find, and I did add it at the beginning like called for.  It turned out great and didn't get dry like I feared (cooked 8 hours on low).  I drained the tomatoes as other reviewers suggested and that left plenty of juice at the end.  I added instant rice (about 6 servings) at the end as other reviewers suggested, and cooked on low for an hour because we weren't home.  It was soggy and overcooked, so next time I think I'll try adding closer to serving time or not using it at all.  My husband loved this!

This was not only really good, but easy to make as well.  I am not usually a big fan of Cajun or spicy food, but this was more flavorful than "hot".  I brought it to a potluck at work and had lots of requests for the recipe.

I like this recipe. I pre-measure the dry ingredients and bag it to take it camping so it makes it easier. Great meal to make and be able to go out and have some fun.  Glad I found this. My husband like it when this comes camping with us.

I have tried "lots" of Jambalaya recipes and over the years have come up with a pretty good version of my own. I happened across this one and thought "No Way"....can't just throw everything, raw meat and all into a crockpot and come home to a decent product.

Well yes, apparently you can:-) I was very pleasantly surprised. Not going to say it is the best ever, but it is VERY respectable. I have for sure had much worse in more than one restaurant. Nice job on this recipe!

This was really good as an all-day-at-work crockpot dinner. I prepped it the night before and turned it on 8 hours on low when I left. When I got home, turned it on high for 30min to reheat and cook the shrimp. The hubby and I loved it and loved the heat. My toddler only ate a few bites of the chicken but his loss. It made plenty of leftovers and I'll make it again. I might even try this as a freezer meal. My only complaint was it was a little soupy, but that's easily fixable by either upping the meat or reducing some of the juices.

I learned a lot of things the first time I made this recipe and failed. First...there is a LOT of excess liquid, but don't be silly like I was and try adding the rice to soak it up. It ruined the texture of the entire dish. The second time I made this I spooned out as much of the excess liquid as possible and used it when I cooked my rice separately. It added some nice flavor to the rice, and fixed my soupy problem. I also added extra cajun seasoning and chili powder when I added the shrimp, and I used raw instead of precooked shrimp. Turned out delicious!

Amazing! I made a couple alterations and use the onion/garlic/celery diced tomatoes (with juice) and then the last 20-25 minutes of cooking I throw in a cup of uncooked rice. Comes out perfect! Also, I tried the andouille sausage the first time I made this and hated it, I just thought it was disgusting, so I use smoked summer sausage instead. Personal preference, but wow it's amazing in there.

Tasty! This is an easy, straight forward jambalaya. I opted for small, pre-cooked and tail-less shrimp, and next time I would opt for tailed, larger shrimp for better texture. Also, I would skip the soft, fresh sausages from your grocer and go with a harder skinned, easy to slice sausage. I cooked this for 4 hours on high rather than 7-8 hours on low and it tasted great.

I love this recipe.  I cook it about once a month.  The only thing I changed, is I added fresh spices like fresh oregano and thyme. I love it. I sometimes add okra even though I know that's for gumbo, but I like it. I cook the rice separately and ladle the jambalaya over it. Thanks for the recipe!

I am allergic to fowl and therefore substituted a smoked venison-pork sausage for the chicken.  I also substituted beef broth for the chicken broth and added more that the recipe calls for.  I used Old Bay seasoning and the result was amazing. Just the right amount of spice to dance on the back of your tongue.  I served it over rice and wow...excellent meal!!

Quite bland. I followed the recipe exactly and was hoping for a punch of flavor. All I got was heat and smokiness and it seem to be missing the saltiness or substance of all the ingredients that was put in there. As most reviewers said, it did come out really watery - the watery part was mainly fat from the sausage and water cooked out from diced tomato. At the end, I added 3 cups of cooked Jasmine rice and it still has a lot of liquid after I put in the rice.  Hopefully the rice will absorb all of the flavors in the next few hours. Since I thought the Jambalaya was bland, i added an additional teaspoon of table salt and sprinkling of garlic powder. Hopefully that did the trick. I'm bringing this dish to the office and we'll be eating this in 5 hours. 

I think I'll make it on the stove next time with a different recipe.

This was fantastic! Everyone in the family liked it, including my picky 14 year old son. We cut down on the cayenne a bit, because of my stomach problems, but that's a personal issue thing, rather than a taste issue. Served it over rice and it was delicious.

This recipe is fantastic, after going to New Orleans for the first time and having my fair share of incredible jambalaya while I was there I was looking for an authentic jambalaya recipe to make for Mardi Gras when we were home. This has become an annual tradition for our recipe to make this recipe in the crockpot every year. I wouldn't imagine even trying a different recipe!

Very tasty.  I put everything in slow cooker except for the shrimp.  The last half our I added 1 box of Zantarain's Jambalaya Mix and the raw shrimp.  The rice took a little over 1/2 hour to cook.  Will make again.

This was just okay for me (but jambalaya isn't something we eat regularly, so it could be it just isn't a dish for us). Was easy to put together. Does come out soupy, so definitely need to searve with rice.

Very tasty as written but I had to add salt, bay leaf and fresh minced garlic to the mix. I decreased the red pepper by half. During the last few minutes I added thawed raw peeled deveined shrimp and 1 1/2 cups of white minute rice. My picky kids gobbled it up. When in the bowl I added hot pepper sauce to my serving and it was super tasty. Great flavors!!!

Should have read the least positive reviews first.  Soupy, over cooked chicken, average flavor...not doing this again.

This was seriously the best!! I made it for Monday night football with sweet cornbread muffins and only had enough for one person to have leftovers the next day.  The only change i made was i used fresh prawns instead of frozen We will definitely make this again.  Thanks for sharing!!

Like other reviews mine was soupy so I removed two cups of liquid and used it with 2 cups of water to par boil my rice. After 6.5 hours of cooking on low I added my rice and raw, tail on shrimp. 20 minutes later the shrimp were perfect and the rice absorbed lost all reminding liquid. I didn't measure the spices, I eyeballed it. It worked for my Mom and Wife...and it was awesome. I added no extra salt or pepper, it was fine as is. Instead of chicken I used chicken and jalapeño sausage from Kroger. I also found Conehu sausage and used the Original version. I also added .75 lbs of frozen okra and 2 cans of Rotel. It was the bomb, best Jambalaya ever. I'm tempted to send Colleen roses if I could find her. Thanks!

Amazeballs. I just went to put this away and can't stop snacking on it. I don't usually like shrimp, thought it would be fishy and I'd hate it. NOPE. The shrimp melted delicately in my mouth along with all of the other ingredients. Spiciness is on point, this dish is made to have some spice. If you don't like spice, you really shouldn't be eating jambalaya. I'd say overall it's medium spicy. Anyway. The only thing I did different was add raw frozen shrimp at 7 hours on low (turned it off at 8 hrs). Like I said, came out AMAZING (aka, amazeballs.)

I've lived in "Cajunville" for years and this is very close to a recipe that I've also made for years. You don't cook the rice together with it, as someone said earlier, AND it's supposed to be spicy. You serve it over rice, instead. I don't use celery. Instead of broth I use a cup or so of condensed French onion soup, it gives it a rich flavor. I don't use Cayenne pepper but use pepper sauce. Authentic Jambalaya should have Tabasco sauce or Louisiana hot sauce (but admittedly I sometimes cheat and use 4 tsp of Frank's Red Hot Sauce simply because I love its flavor); Louisiana hot sauce is more mild than Tabasco's and Frank's. Also, you can throw in a packet of onion soup mix, if you want to stick with regular broth and fire-roasted diced tomatoes adds great flavor. If you can get it, instead of plain 'ol Andouille, get Conecuh sausage. It's what the locals use and is to die for. You can buy it online too. Warning though: once you go Conecuh, there will be no turning back... I guarantee it! ;)

Delicious!!! I was surprised at the authentic taste with out a roux. I did make a few changes but nothing that would change the integrity of the recipe. I added minced garlic and 2 bay leaves since all good Cajun foods have both. I didn't have any celery so I left it out and really didn't miss it. I will be making this again and again!

Great recipe.  Two changes 1. Omitted Cajun and cayenne due to wanting my kids to eat it and ...here's the best 2. Toward the end, I added a box of jambalaya rice mix.  It gave it the extra flavor that my omissions had left out and beefed it up a bit with the rice.  Also, adding the rice mix made it thicker, which I prefer.  Great recipe.  Sorry for the changes, but thought someone else out there with kids might enjoy a less spicy version.  This one's a keeper...thanks!!

I read the other reviews and decided to keep it "soupy" so I could cook the rice with the jambalaya.  Cooking the rice along with the jambalaya absorbed the juice and imparted a nice flavor to the rice.  I substituted 12 oz beer for the broth (I used lager style, but pilsner would work and impart a little less flavor).  I think the slight beer flavor enhances the spices nicely.  I also left out the bell pepper as I am not fond of the texture when they cook in the slow cooker (the flesh softens, but the waxy skin does not and I was too lazy to peel them).  I also used turkey keilbasa instead of andouille to cut the fat a little.

I made this recipe just to try something a little different for my family and everyone loved it! Two of us found it a bit spicy (so we simply added a little sour cream) and two of us thought the heat was just right...but everyone agreed that the recipe was a keeper. I added cooked brown rice along with the shrimp 30 minutes before finish. Wouldn't change a thing, just keep some sour cream on hand for those who can't handle the heat.

This was delicious! Cut the recipe in half and used roasted tomatoes with garlic instead of diced tomatoes. Used 1 1/2 cups of the liquid to make rice in the rice cooker. Still had plenty of liquid for the jambalaya. Can't wait to enjoy the leftovers!

If you want real Jambalaya, go to Louisiana. If you want a tasty, quick to prepare alternative for your family, look no further. Cooking the rice separtely allows you to make a larger quantity for more dinner guests or to freeze for later. The slow cooker is so convenient!

I made mine on the stove quick-style, then added about 3 cups of cooked rice toward the end of simmering.  Total simmer time was about 30 minutes (until peppers/onions were soft).  Had switched out the chicken breasts for thighs, used bulk Andouille Sausage and a little more cayenne that it called for.  Phenomenal!!  Even the picky eater had two bowls.

I did not care for this recipe. I followed this recipe the letter. I served it to company and never was so embarrassed in my life. People actually aughed and said that the taste must all be in the soupy liquid in the pot.

I love this dish.  I use chorizo sausage instead (personal preference) and omit the cayenne pepper because chorizo is so much hotter.  I do everything else the same, cook the rice in my rice cooker and then serve the jambalaya over the rice.  I love adding a scoop of sour cream on the side to balance out the heat...perfect!

Quick and Easy to make. I downsized it to serve three and still had plenty of leftovers. Mixed some instant long grain rice about 30-minutes before serving and served meal in bowls.

Delicious recipe!  I cooked everything for about 2.5 hours on high, then added raw shrimp to cook for about another hour.  About 30 minutes before it was done, I added the rice so it won't get mushy.  I like to overload my dishes with vegetables to make them more healthy, so next time, I'll add 2 more bell peppers, more celery, and 2 fresh tomatoes.

We really enjoyed this meal. I did use less shrimp because I knew that the recipe would make enough for two meals with lunches, so I made sure that there was just enough shrimp for our meal and froze the leftovers for another day.  I'll make it again but I'll halve the amount of each of the meats and add more veggies for a healthier recipe.

Very flavorful. Great blend of spices. I added a bag of frozen okra; served with Filé; super! Easy to fix.

Made per recipe and loved it.  If you aren't a fan of spicy hot, you may want to cut back the cayenne by half.  After serving the first night I threw in the rice for a dryer version the subsequent meal.  Both ways were yummy.  I recommend using medium sized shrimp.  Note the shopping list says two onions, but the directions say 1 large onion.

My husband LOVED this dish and I really didn't think he would care for it! I didn't use chicken broth(didn't need it in the slow cooker) I only had smoked sausage and no shrimp but it was still gooooood! So glad I made it. BTW, my parents live in Hixson and I was raised on Siganal Mt. I'm sharing this recipe with my Mom!!

Everybody in the household raved about this dish! I cooked the rice and mixed it in to make it less soupy. I already have requests to make it again.

Made as in the recipe, except I left out the celery because we don't really like it cooked.  I served it over brown rice with cornbread, and the whole family loved it!  I will certainly make this again.

as some one said earlier. this isi the BOMB.. fantastic  i made it one night when my dad was in town, he loves spicey foods, and he aboslutly loved this.  

I had cut the spices in half and it still  has some kick to it. I too prefer raw shrimp/prawns to frozen so i tossed them in 30-35min towards the end.  

i noticed others saying that it was more like soup so i eased up on the broth and tomato juice. almost perfect in terms of thickness and didnt hurt the flavour at all.

It also freezes well.. if you have any left over. lol i had enough for two more meals .. my dad ate it all during his visit. 

over all if i could 10 stars i loved it and cant wait to do it again

This was, quite possibly, the tastiest thing I have ever made. Ever. I agree with the other reviews that it does come out VERY soupy, so to thicken it, I added instant rice at the end with the shrimp. It was PERFECT and SO delicious. My entire family LOVED it.

Turned out too liquidy for my taste, but a bit of flour towards the end of cooking thickened it right up.  Delicious!

Great slow cooker recipe!  I left out the bell pepper and celery for personal preference.  I did add some carrots and garlic.  I added some zuchini along with the shrimp the last 10 minutes of cooking.  Cooked brown rice was also added which took care of any problem with this being more like a soup.  For spices, I made cajun spice mix from this site.  I'll be making this again.

Easy to make and yummy! My husband doesn't like spicy food but loves jambalaya, and he really enjoyed this. It was still a little spicy for him, so next time I will cut back on the cayenne pepper.  But I wanted to comment on people saying it was a little soupy. I actually added extra broth in the beginning because I wanted to use the liquid to make my rice.  When I added the shrimp, I took out 2 cups of the "broth" and cooked the rice in it - the rice was extra flavorful.

This was delish and super easy.  I took others advice and made the Creole Seasoning Mix off this website and used 4tbsp in lieu of the spices here. It was really tasty and I have plenty of Creole seasoning left to make more batches :)

This recipe says 7-8hrs of crockpot time on low, no way. I did 3 1/2 hours, I also did not add the juice from the diced tomatoes. Many mentioned how soupy it turns out, the chicken and veggies release juice ontop of the broth that you put in. Next time I will add less broth or some minute rice. I browned my sausage before placing in crock pot and I used hot links instead of andouille, andouille was $4 a half pound at my grocer. I also used cooked shrimp and I left in for 20 min before shutting off and it did not even need that. I could have turned it off and the heat would have worked. I threw it over rice and it was very yummy. Definitely not original jumbalaya but, I love new simple dishes.

This was soooo yummy! I added 200 g of rice at the beginning and upped the liquid a bit, also added an extra 2tsp Cajun seasoning. By the time dinner came, the home smelled wonderful too!

This was pretty good as listed, but something was missing with the flavors.  I think if I make this again I will take the advise of other cooks and drain part of the juice from the tomatoes, add a tsp of Creole seasoning and I've not decided what else, as I am still tasting it now.

Really nice flavor in this recipe.  But I agree with another poster that it was just a tad bit too soupy.  Next time, I'll leave out the chicken broth and the liquid from the diced tomatoes.  But overall, it was really good and I would make it again.

This is a great recipe. I didn't have any shrimp, but it was still fantastic. I used chicken thighs instead of breast and it worked out delicious! My husband unexpectedly invited a couple of his friends over around dinner time. This recipe and about four cups of white rice fed the three men and myself and we still had leftovers the next day.

I thought this was really great, everyone loved it...I used a store packet jambalaya seasoning instead of exactly what the recipe called for and that was probably a mistake...also, I followed other reviewers advice by adding the rice in at the end which I was happy with but I used three cups instant rice and next time will only used two (it absorbed the broth to the point that there was none at all)

I followed the recipe exactly with two tiny exceptions: when I put in the shrimp, I added 2 cups of instant rice AND at the beginning I toothpicked 2 cloves of garlic and nestled 'em in. It was fabulous! My husband (a chef) went back for seconds and kept asking "where did you get this recipe?" Thank you Colleen!

LOVE this jambalaya! The hardest part about making this is the prep work, but it's totally worth the time. The flavors come together beautifully in the crockpot. Not too spicy, just a slight kick.  The only thing that I changed is that I put in 1 cup of rice during the last hour instead of doing rice on the side because it seemed a bit too soupy otherwise. Other than that, it's an easy dish that reheats great! Can't rave enough about this recipe. Thanks Colleen!

This wasn't as good as I had hoped, and it was a ton of work compared to other things I make in the slow cooker, so I probably won't attempt it again.

This turned out much better than I anticipated! I doubled the recipe and the only changes made were (1) added some garlic (2) browned the sausage before adding to the pot and (3) throwing in some rice during the last half hour. Made great leftovers...

I followed all the instructions and it came out too hot for my husband and me.  Next time I'll use less cayenne and I think it will be five star worthy.  This time, I was able to salvage by adding some sour cream, milk, and flour to make it a cream sauce and serve with pasta.

I followed the recipe & it turned out ok. But I did follow other people suggesting about adding the rice to it. It came out too thick for my liking & next time I will keep it on the side. Otherwise the flavor was pretty good. Will definitely make it again without the rice. I also made the bread pudding recipe that I found & that turned out great.

Great.  I live in VT so it seems that things cook a bit faster up in the mountains so the chix was a little dry but everything else was solid. 

I like kick so I added 2 tablespoons of Old Bay Spice and 4 cloves of sliced garlic.  

Also used 1/2 a green and 1/2 yellow pepper honestly just because only had 1/2 a green one in the house.

This was delicious.  I served it over white rice. My husband and I thought this was perfect, as per the recipe.  But if you don't like a lot of heat, use a little bit less cayenne.

Very tasty!  We tripled the recipe for a large crowd, so made this on the stovetop - pre-cooking the chicken a little and adding extra water, since it wasn't cooked in the slow cooker.  We also added some cayenne and Old Bay Seasoning to spice it up - just enough to give a little burn in the back of the throat.  Very nice!

This was really good! I started in a stockpot  (browned the chicken and sausage then added the onion, pepper and celery, cooked until wilted. Then added the tomatoes and broth and spices) and transferred to my crock pot since I got a late start and only had 2 hours. It still turned out great!  I used turkey smoked sausage instead of the andouille.  My only problem with this recipe (and I think that's allrecipes thing) is that it makes no where near the 12 servings it states.  Will definitely be making this again!!

I love this recipe, have shared it with all my family, and now make it a couple of times a month!  It was so tasty and easy, and it made my whole house smell like a New Orleans French Quarter restaurant!  I couldn't find the right sausage, but I read that a smoked meat was a good substitute to get the right flavor so I used Black Forest ham and it tasted wonderful.  I did change it a little the second time I made it and left out the shrimp because it didn't seem to absorb the flavors of the spices as well as the chicken, and I added a whole can of chicken broth so I could serve it as a soup over rice.

Excellent recipe!  I had to leave out the shrimp for cost and used a whole can of chicken broth, but it still tasted great.  I recommend making two (uncooked) cups of brown rice and throwing it into the pot for the last half hour of cooking so it absorbs some of the broth.

Absolutely delicious. This was my first time making it and I love this recipe. The only change I made was taking out the celery because no one in the house likes celery. This has become a regular recipe in our household. Thank you very much.

Pretty good, of course nothing is GREAT in the slow cooker.  Next time I will probably leave out the chicken breast or swap it with chicken thighs.   Chicken breasts just come out so dry after cooking that long.  The flavor was great, I switched out the cajun seasoning with Tony Chacheres (spicier) and left out the green bell pepper because my husband hates them.

This recipe is very delicious.  My daughter and I are both allergic to seafood, so I doubled the sausage.  I used smoked turkey polish sausage.  It was a wonderful addition. I also omitted the celery - a personal preference. I don't like the taste. I added a cup of instant brown rice in the last hour.  I will definitely be making this again!

This was very good (but not on the level of great).  Easy and tasty, all my kids enjoyed it.  I added and extra tsp of cajun spice but left out the cayenne and it was quite spicy, but not tear inducing.

Followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding an extra onion, garlic, and 2 lbs shrimp. Next time I would..(1) brown chicken and sausage and then add to slow cooker (2) add spices during last hour of cooking (3) increase Cajun seasoning since I've ended up using some additional hot sauce to final dish . Also be prepared to add salt at end of cooking...very bland without it.  BTW I added the shrimp which were uncooked during last hour of cooking and they were perfect. I also have re-heated in my microwave at power level 5 which works great. Brown rice also adds some additional nuttiness.

We LOVED this recipe!!  I added more cajun spice and cayenne pepper (we like things hot).  I didn't give this 5 stars because I felt the chicken was a little bland..... I'll leave the chicken out on the next batch....

Pretty good! I did see that it was soupy as many other reviewers had observed. I added about 2 tsps of filé and that thickened it a bit and added that distinctive New Orleans essence. I also added the shrimp raw, shelled with the tails removed so they would be tender. Spiciness was nicely subtle and develops as you eat. I don't think heat should ever smack you in the face, more sneak up from behind and surprise you. Definitely have some hot sauce available for those who like more heat, though, as this is more 'warm' than 'hot'. This worked well over brown rice.

Changed as follows:  Used kielbasa, omitted shrimp and cayenne, used Italian seasoning (in place of thyme, parsley, oregano), and used about 2c canned broth.  Also used 1 whole frozen chicken breast and just shredded when ready to eat.  Added 3/4 c rice 20 min before serving. Delicious and very versatile can be healthy.  Whole family enjoyed, including a 6yr, 4yr, and 10 month old!!  Thanks for great, easy recipe!

Very good.  I made this as directed, except that my store only sells andouille in 12 oz. packages, so that is what I used.  My only other change was to decrease the cayenne to 1/2 tsp. and even then it was still plenty hot.  It was pretty liquidy, but that's fine if you're serving with rice.

This is the best Jambalaya recipe I have found so far! I love it. I've grown quite addicted to jambalaya since I moved to Louisiana. My only concern was that it was too runny, possibly because I chopped the vegies in the food processor. So I just added the uncooked rice to the crockpot and finished cooking it that way. It was SO good!  I froze at least half of this recipe because it made too much for one sitting. Next time, I will probably add the rice to half of it because the rice got mushy in the freezer, but everything else was perfect after re-heating it.

I can't call this Jambalaya simply because it was more like a soup.  My family liked it but I didn't because  I was expecting Jambalaya.  It was more bland than expected especially with all the Cajun and cayenne pepper and I even used hot Italian sausage but the spice was washed out by so much liquid.  I drained about 2 cups of liquid.  If I ordered this at a restaurant, I would have sent it back and told them I ordered Jambalaya and not soup.

Very spicy, a bit soupy, but delicious- this is coming from someone who spent more than half my childhood in Louisiana and has had quite a few dishes of Jambalaya before. Love the flavors of this one!

This was a big hit at a potluck for work. Rice and sour cream were provided on the side. This was a favored dish, with many people coming back for seconds. Thank you for sharing the recipe!

We really enjoyed this.  I doubled the Old Bay (Cajun seasoning) and we opted to cook for 3 hours on high... Next time, we'll use the low/7 hour option because the veggies were a little crunchy for a jambalaya.  It was great leftover too (maybe even better because the veggies were softer)!

This is an outstanding recipe...full of flavor and very filling. For those of you who think it's to spicy just cut out the Cajun seasoning and for those who don't like it soupy cut out the juice from the tomatoes. Also very good served over a bed of rice. But made as written...is cajun cooking all the way.

This was such an easy and delicious meal! I added brown rice to try and soak up some of the extra liquid, and found it needed 1 1/2 hours to cook after added (actually took out of crock pot and put into ovenproof covered pan for the last 45 minutes). Used raw shrimp and omitted celery. Will definitely be making again soon.

I've made this twice so far fantastic both times!  I suggest serving it with rice becuase for me both times it was very juicy (my Dad called it JumBo, a combination of Jumbalaya and Gumbo)  I bought jambalaya flavored rice at the store and served the jambalaya with that.  Terrific!

This was delicious! I made it for a supper club night & it EASILY fed 12 girls, with leftovers. I made 100% as is, but added 2 tsp garlic powder. I cooked the rice seperate & stirred it into the jambalaya right before serving.

This was one of the best dishes i have ever made. I used only one cup of liquid total (half cup of chicken broth, half cup of the tomato liquid), and it was perfect. It only needed 5 hours on low. Also, i used raw frozen shrimp, and i tossed them in for about 5 minutes before serving, (they only took about 2 minutes to turn pink). Everyone raved about his dish!

A five star recipe.  Andouille sausage is a must.  I cooked 2 cups of white rice separately and added it to the slow cooker at the end and this works well.  A word of caution on the rice.  When you add rice to the Jambalaya, add a little bit at a time and allow a good 15 minutes for the liquid to absorb.  Initially, the Jambalaya may appear to have too much liquid, but over time, the liquid will be absorbed into the rice.  Good luck.

Holy Smokes was this good! Wowzers. This was hot too. I followed the recipe almost exactly. I used Rotel in place of the diced tomatoes since I didn't have just diced tomatoes. I also omitted the green pepper and celery since we don't really care for either. The cajun seasoning spice I made from a recipe I found here on Allrecipes. I did read other reviewers regarding adding rice and there was so many different ideas on amounts that I decided to make some on the side and then put the jambalaya over it. I wish now that I would have tried to put some rice in the pot since this was very liquidy. I wasn't sure for awhile that the amount of liquid in this would be enough but it ended up being pe rfect. The andouille sausage is an absolute must for flavor in this. Thank you for the recipe.

This was great.  Made as written substituting venison sausage for the andouille as it isn't available where I live.  Would cut down on red pepper next time, but otherwise, wouldn't change anything.  Served over brown rice.

Very good and easy. I HIGHLY recommend putting the already cooked shrimp in immediately before serving or even adding them to the individual serving bowls. They only need to be warmed up, not cooked. A half hour overcooks them.

Wonderful!  Next time I would reduce the amount of oregano used (not a huge fan).  Per others' suggestions, I added instant white rice during the last half hour (when the shrimp is added in).  Since I added the instant rice, I doubled the chicken broth at the beginning.  Thanks!!! for providing a great slow cooker recipe without condensed soup!  More like these are needed!

This was pretty tasty.  I just felt like it needed a little more seasoning and more vegetable ingredients.  I added the shrimp and rice during the last half hour and they cooked perfectly.  I used raw shrimp.

Darn Yummy.  It was a big hit.   I followed the recipe but it wasn't spicy enough for us.  Cayenne and red pepper flakes were added to the left overs and the left over rice was mixed in.  Perfect the second day.

This has a very nice flavour, it's a little on the spicy side but not too bad.  I did find it a little watery, so next time I'm going to cut back on the liquids.  Otherwise it's a keeper for sure!

I made this for the Super Bowl in honor of NO and I must say it was WONDERFUL!  Per another review I also used 4T of the creole seasoning on this site and with the spiciness of the sausage it was just right.  I see how some could find it "soupy" but i thought it needed the jiuce with the rice to keep it from becoming too dry.  All in all, I would highly suggest this recipe!

I made this for our Super Bowl party and people just loved it (I didn't have any leftovers - boo!).   I did make the following changes:  1) I used kielbasa instead of andouille sausage because kielbasa is easier to cut into pieces. 2) I drained the tomatoes because the juice from the other ingredients makes it too runny if you don't (it happened to me the first time I made it) 3) I don't like fish so I increased the amount of chicken and sausage. 4) I don't know if it's my slow cooker or not, but at Low, it was done within 5 hours.

I think this Jambalaya is absolutely delightful! My son and I enjoyed it very much. We had to put sour cream in it to balance the spicyness, but it is all GOOD! I did add 4 gloves of garlic (a necessity) and did not have any cayenne pepper and used red pepper instead. We didn't have any celery so I omitted that and I used beef smoked sausage because that is what I had on hand. Also, the last half hour of cooking (4 hrs total) I added frozen uncooked shrimp. I followed some reviewers suggestions and I thought this dish was absolutely awesome. Definitely a KEEPER! Thanks so much for sharing! :D)

Update: I love this recipe and so does everyone who eats it. I just made this again yesterday for a dinner party, and I made one change that might address some of the criticisms: I added a can (small) of tomato paste and it made it so much thicker and richer. This is one of the few recipes that I season exactly as written - it turns out delicious every time.

Made this today and had dinner guests...they raved about it and gobbled it all up. I followed the recipe exactly, except I could not find andouille sausage here in Mexico. I used 1/2 chorizo and 1/2 Italian sausage and it was really good. I'll make this again and again. So easy to make when you have company for dinner. I served with a green salad and good bread. Thanks for the great recipe, Colleen.

I changed a few things.  1.  I used Italian turkey sausage and browned the slices before adding them to the pot.  2.  I bought raw shrimp because I don't trust "cooked" shrimp at the market.  I boiled water, with salt, jerk, and bay leaf and cooked the shrimp in the boiled water for 5 minutes.  3. I browned the chicken cubes because I couldn't stand the thought of putting raw chicken in my pot - call me weirdo.  I did like one of the readers said - strained the diced tomatoes - used some of the juice but not the whole thing.  I added more cayenne and jerk.  DEEELISH!!!

I made this recipe, I had some left over broth so I just added it in, than I put the rice in the pot and mixed it together. My husband and the boys loved it, we didn't have any left overs. It had the right amount of heat for me to enjoy it.

So good!  I made the mistake of increasing the liquid and then adding rice with 1 1/2-2 hrs remaining.  The flavor was good but the rice didn't cook completely...my fault.  Next time I will make the rice seperately and stir in before serving.

I thought it was ok.  I stuck to the recipe religiously and personally, I thought it had good spice but needed a little flavor.  I ended up adding about 1 1/2 teaspoons of Creole seasoning.  That did the trick for me.  Though, i did end up sprinkling a little more on my plate, but I like things salty.  I also thought it was a bit soupy and more like gumbo.  Maybe it rice was cooked together it would have been better.

This was awesome! I made a few changes based on what I had on hand... turkey kielbasa instead of andouille sausage, some roasted red pepper in addition to frozen bell pepper mix. I also just used a sprinkle of cayenne to reduce the heat. And I added a cup of bulgur wheat for the last hour (on High) instead of making it separate. A winner!

This was delicious.......I was a little concerned about the dish being soupy so I only put a splash of chicken broth. I used some bnls/sknls chicken thighs rather than the breast and added 3 tbsp of minced garlic as suggested by other reviewers. I also omitted the celery as Im not a fan of cooked celery. Overall turned out delicious! I will make this again for sure

I used everything the recipe called for, straight and unaltered. Definitely too much soup. The flavor was very, very good though. I think I'll drain the tomatoes next time. I'm jealous of all who have instant rice on hand. I made rice separately, and poured this jambalaya over, letting the soup flavor the rice. The picture I posted is from today, day two. I made rice using 2 cups of soup from the leftovers. If I had to guess, I'd say there was about 5 cups of excess soup (for anyone that's thinking of putting rice into it).

This recipe is OUTSTANDING !!! We've made it twice now and everyone who has tried it loved it, with the exception of my brother-in-laws friend Jay, but he thinks ketchup is too spicy ! For the first batch we used italian sausage, simply because you can't find andouille sausage in "Podunkville" on a dare. For the second batch we went to Metropolis to find andouille and we changed the diced tomatoes to a  can of ROTEL for added twang. This is one of our new favorites...THANKS !!!

Very good receipe, followed it as written along with one recommendation of adding garlic very good and spicy.  Added a couple tsp of cornstarch at the end to thicken without losing any of the flavor. Next time would add more chicken.

Made this as stated, except we don't have andouille sausage this neck of the woods...Rice was added but ended up too mushy (operator error LOL) but overall very good. We still like the Oven Baked Jambalaya (also from AR) better though, and may try that recipe in the crockpot next time to make it easier!

I normally don't give 5 stars if I felt I needed to change something, but spiciness can be a personal preference. For me, cutting the cajun spice to 1 tsp and cayenne to 3/4 tsp made this 10 stars++++++. Unbelievably good. The original is great but made my tongue numb even though I love spicy food. To give you an idea, I like "Fire" sauce at Taco Bell, and Late Night Last Call Jalapeno Popper Doritos, but this original jambalaya was too spicy for me. I loved it other than that, though, and the changes made it perfect for me, I will make this over and over again, including for company. I got the andoulle sausage from Wal Mart! Delish!

I made this last weekend as a Sunday meal.  Put everything in the crock pot in the morning and let it cook through on low until dinner time.  Was a complete hit!  Here are the changes I made: I used leftover garlic bologna sausage and left over pork from the night before and I skipped the chicken.  I had a ton of fresh tomatoes on hand that needed to be used, so I used them rather than the canned.  I used mostly red, but there were also a few yellow and orange tomatoes thrown in.  I also added a yellow bell pepper to the mix.  I used Indian Cayenne, which I find to be a little spicier than regular Cayenne.  Everything else I did exactly as stated and added the shrimp in (frozen) about 1.5hrs before serving.  This was so flavorful and spicey.  Just fantastic and only got better the next day!  Served over white rice with a sprinkle of mozz. cheese on top.

My wife and I love jambalaya and this recipe sounded good but we didn't care for it. The chicken was way overcooked, it was watery and the flavor was so-so. It's not a cheap dish to make so I would recommend not trying this.

This was really good and super easy.  I omitted celery just because we don't care for it much.  Also, I didn't have cajun seasoning, so I substituted Old Bay Seasoning.  I thought the seasoning was just right; the cayenne adds just the right amount of "heat".  I also added about a cup of fresh crabmeat that I picked from some blue crabs left over from a crab feast and I used uncooked frozen shrimp like some other reviewers.  I served it over steamed rice, with fresh steamed brussels sprouts on the side.  Delish!

This was a great recipe.  I made just a couple of changes.  First I added 2 tablespoons minced garlic. I cooked it on high and 30 minutes before it was done I added 1 lb uncooked shrimp and 1.5 cups of uncooked instant rice.  Adding the rice took care of the soupy problem that others had.  Other then that I followed the recipe exactly and it was great.

I think I expected too much from this recipe. After reading other reviews, I was expecting rich, thick flavors and that was not the case. The sauce was spicy but, to me, tasted watered down ( although no water was used). Sorry to say but I will not be making this again:(

Great recipe!  I doubled the recipe and served it to 14 adults last night before heading out to a jazz concert.  Cooked it on low for 8 hours; used 2 crockpots.  I cooked the rice seperately and served by placing a scoop of rice into an oversized bowl and then ladeled the jambalaya over the top.  Served it with warm crusty bread....delicious; received rave reviews.   I did make a few alterations: cut chicken into smaller than 1 in. cubes, used both chicken breasts and boneless thighs, used Ro-Tel diced tomatoes with green chili peppers + diced tomatoes to make up the 28 oz called for in the recipe, omitted the green bell pepper, added a clove of minced garlic, lightly browned the sausage before slicing for the recipe, used water with bullion cube rather than the chicken broth. Because of the Ro-Tel mentioned above + the andouille sausage I omitted the cayenne as the taste was hot enough.  I will most definately make this again.  Added bonus: the house smelled terrific!

Don't let the picture deceive you.  It doesn't do it justice.  This recipe is fantastic.  I most recently served it during a dinner party at my home and everyone loved it.  No changes necessary!  It is a little spicy, so if you have folks that are faint of heart, you could reduce the amount of cajun season and cayenne pepper.

Very, very good.  I followed the recipe except for adding a bit of garlic, one small can of tomato paste per other reviews and I added a full 2 cup can of broth.  I don't understand  why others said to drain the tomatoes( I didn't) and why the recipe called for only a cup of broth.  I feel you need this liquid. If it gets a bit soupy so what?  The liquid will be at the bottom of the pot but the rest will be nice and moist. Definitely a keeper!

The only ingredient I omitted was the cayenne.  I wanted to be careful with the raw chicken, so I set the slow cooker on high and added the tomatoes and broth, then the vegetables, and sausage.  By the time those were all cut up, the mixture was hot and I added the chicken.  Cooked on high for two hours, then turned it to low for another two.
Simply the best!  My husband raved about it.

Great recipe!!!  I served this for a party and it was a huge hit! I added a small can of tomato paste to thicken up the sauce and only added 1/2 of the chicken broth. I also added thawed uncooked shrimp and a little more cayenne pepper. I will definitely make this one again!

This is an easy, tasty Jambalaya.  I put everything in the crockpot the night before and cooked it the next morning.  It was ready and smelling good by the time we came home.  I had to ease up on the spices because one of my kids don't like spicy food.  Asked the family if this is a "make again dish" and they all said yes!  Like most crockpot meals, presentation is not the best so I would not serve this at a dinner party.  I served this with Jasmine rice made separately in my trusty rice cooker.  This will be in my dinner rotation.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was great.  Made it for the first time and the family loved it.  I did omit the bell pepper by accident  but it did not make a difference. The only suggestion I would make would be to use boneless chicken thighs instead of the breast because the meat dried out a little bit.  I also used keibsa sauage. Would make again in a heart beat.

I have no clue on the negative ratings, this came out great! and looked like the picture too.  the only changes i made was a use half turkey keilbasa and 1/2 anduille because that's what i had, used the cajun spice from this site so didn't add the additional spices except for the cayanne. lord it was good. the only thing i think i'll do different the next time is leave at the additional cayenne, it was pretty spicy the first day, the longer it sits the hotter it gets! this was probly one of the best jambalaya recipes i've had in ages. not to soupy not to thick great mix of flavors and textures! served it over brown rice.

I made this for a crowd and everyone seemed to like it.  Most of my guest didn't like spicy food, so I cut way back on the spice.  Emeril has a good recipe for Creole Seasoning where you mix spices together, and I used 2 tsp of that instead of the Cajun Seasoning and cayenne.  It still had flavor without the heat and super easy for a crowd!

Way too hot! And I only put in 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper. Other than that, very good. I would hold back on the cayenne pepper, since the Cajun seasoning already has plenty of cayenne pepper in it.

None left for leftovers.  Husband loved this just as is.  The kids and I thought it was too spicy.  Will absolutely try again with less cayenne-husband can add his own in his bowl.

This was excellent even the kids raved about it.  I did add cornstarch the last hour of cooking to thicken up the broth and served it over steamed rice.  Also I was out of onions so I used my Tastefully Simple Onion-Onion product and it was great.  I have never made Jambalaya before but this recipe is a keeper.

Excellent and easy recipe.  Came out perfect with just the right amount of "bite".  I'll use it again when I need a warm dish.  Great with a salad and rice.

It is very important to put in raw and not cooked shrimp to enhance the flavor of the broth and so that the shrimp is tender.

I made this recipe as is..the taste was great but I thought it was much too "soupy" for jambalaya. I may make it again and add tomato paste to try to thicken it a little. My picky husband actually really liked this, too. It's worth a try for anybody.

I've been looking for variations on slow cooker recipes when I came across this one, and thought I'd give it a go.  I tweaked it a bit to meet my south Mississippi taste buds.  Here are the changes I made: I used crawfish tails instead of shrimp and I didn’t wait till the last 30 minutes to add them.
I used more cayenne and Cajun seasoning than it called for, and dumped in a ton of minced garlic.  I buy pre-chopped frozen onions and I found an onion pack that had celery and bell peppers chopped in it to so I used that instead of all of the fresh veggies.  And I left out the thyme. 
I threw it all together and invited a friend over to test it out.  We stuffed outselves silly.  This is a wonderful, easy, and very filling meal.  Two thumbs up!

We truely liked this recipe except next time I will decrease the cajun spice. It was too hot for our taste. My son-in-law grew up with jambalaya and even he wanted the spice decreased some.

This was good, albeit not authentic-tasting.  Still, it was easy and a good winter meal served over rice.  I used turkey sausage, shrimp, and a piece of tilapia.  I also added a small yam and lots of extra garlic.

I found this exact recipe elsewhere on the internet a few years ago and it is one of my family's favorites.  It is a great crowd pleaser!  I add the cooked rice along with the shrimp about 30 minutes before eating it.  It goes wonderfully with Texas Toast.  We make it when our friends come for dinner (one has a gluten allergy)...without the Texas Toast of course.

This was okay. I agree that it was watery. I even added tomatoe paste as others recommended, but it did not help much. Otherwise, the flavor was good. Although I am not sure if it was good enough to make again.

This was good but it didn't have quite enough kick- maybe I'll go heavier on the spice or add tabasco next time. Also, I mistakenly put frozen okra in at the beginning at it completely disintegrated (not the recipe's fault since it doesn't call for it) though it still tasted good. If you want to add frozen okra, I've discovered it's best to add it 30 minutes before it's done.

I've never had a jambalaya before. After reading the reviews I made some changes to this. I used a chicken stock cube instead of liquid stock, increased the spices used, browned the sausage before adding to the slow cooker and didn't add any prawns. The only liquid I used was the juice from the tomatoes. After 8 hours of cooking it was not soupy at all. The end result was a very tasty casserole type dish. My husband really enjoyed it. I will have to try making a more traditional jambalaya now!

This dish was way too watery.  I cooked it for 8 hours and ended up with Jambalaya soup.  I had to add four cups of instant rice before it even resembled Jambalaya.  And the flavor was way too spicy.  I felt like my mouth was on fire while I was eating it.  My boyfriend enjoyed it though, as he loves really spicy dishes.  I will make it again, but I will obmit at least half the cayenne and cajun spices as well as the chicken broth so I don't end up with soup again.

I dont know how any one could say this was too spicy??? My family was adding spice at the table. I thought it didnt need any extra, just right. I added scallops to it as well as larger shrimp without tails. It was great served with brown rice.

I had a hard time finding the andouille sausage.  So, I just used hot kielbasa.  It was just OK.  Absolutely nothing to rave about.  My husband gets Jambalaya whenever it's on the menu.  He loves it.  He didn't even recognize what it was when I served it to him.  I would not make this again.

The kids thought it was too spicy, and while my husband and I didn't mind the amount of heat, we did feel like it was trying to replace whatever jambalaya-y taste was missing.  Also, (and I tried to prevent this by throwing the rice in the slow cooker for the end of the cooking, but) ultimately, this didn't have the correct texture of jambalaya; it was more like "ingredients of jambalaya served over rice."  The rice of real jambalaya should be more integrated in the meal.  Thanks for the recipe though.

This was great.   Next time I will use fresh shrimp instead of frozen because shrimp had virtually no taste.  My husband likes more heat in his dishes than I do so this was perfect because he just added tabasco to his and I didn't add anything to mine.   Also, I didn't have any Cajun seasoning so I used Old Bay seasoning instead and it turned out great.

This was VERY spicy!!  Next time, I will cut the cayenne in half.  To help thicken it up, I added 3 tblsp. of tomato paste AND removed the lid during the last 30 minutes of cooking with the temp set on high.

My Husband and I LOVED this recipe.
I didn't change a thing, and it did have a kick.(sausages adds more heat)!
It was tooo HOT for the kids, but I will make it again for my friends that like spice. My husband even added more Tabassco on his, but just fine for me.

This is the best Jambalaya recipe ever.  I have been looking for a good Jambalaya recipe and I have finally found one. I served it to my family of five and my parents and they all loved it.  My husband can't wait for me to make it again.  I served it over grits and it was a big hit.

This recipe was very easy to make and tasted great.  I didn't use a slow cooker.  I just put everything in a big pot and let it simmer for an hour or so.

very yummy. i left out the shrimp due to an allergy, but i had to try it out. i just used almost 2 full pounds of chicken instead. my husband loved it and said he didn't even miss it b/c it still tasted very jambalaya-y to him. Made the whole house smell incredible. Thanks for sharing this one. This is a keeper!

My family absolutely loved it!!  Great for company.  Made a couple of small changes due to materials on hand; used same amount of crushed tomatoes instead of diced, added 1/2 cup of white wine, and used raw shrimp.  Add a salad and some bread and you couldn't ask for an easier meal.

Fantastic! I made it in the Instantpot to save time. Sautéed onions and celery, then added: can of diced tomatoes, doubled the broth for more liquid, the spices, red peppers (don’t like green), chicken and chicken andouille sausage. Used stew setting for 20 minutes. Once depressurized, I added in the defrosted cooked shrimp. Sautéed on normal for a few minutes and mixed in the precooked basmati rice (in rice cooker, 2 cups organic basmati, 2 cups water, 1 cup broth, olive oil, salt and garlic powder).

Any recipe that calls for cooking chicken for eight hours in a slow cooker is bound to disappoint; that’s way too long. No more than five hours and that’s for whole thighs. Breasts or any part that is cut into cubes will be done in 3-4 hours.

So easy and so yummy! I cooked on low for 8 hours overnight and the sausage and chicken were cooked perfectly. Yes this recipe leaves a lot of liquid in the crockpot. Save this flavorpacked goodness and use it to cook your rice on the stove! Tasted just like it does in New Orleans. I’ll make it again and again. Thanks for sharing!

I made this for my family and as we sat down to eat they all talked about how their mouths were watering as we said grace. Through the whole meal I was showered with praise. This is an excellent and easy way to make homemade jambalaya   Thanks for sharing this!

Delicious. My husband and I love this. We make a big pot on Sunday and eat it for lunch all week with rice. Since we have it sitting in Tupperware the extra juice actually soaks into the rice and makes it more delicious over time.

Delicious and super easy!  I suggest not adding the chicken until hour 4  to keep it from overcooking/drying in the crock pot.  This made the house smell so good we were all very ready to eat when it was done.  Mine didn't seem too soupy once it was ladled over rice.  Definitely a repeat dinner for us. Thanks "Cooper" who suggested the  Creole Seasoning Blend recipe on this site.  Much better than store bought! !

LOVE IT!!! So full of flavor and super easy to prepare. We served it with basmati rice on the side. There’s a good bit of heat which we really like but it may be to hot for little ones.

I've made this countless times over the years. I don't care if it's "authentic" or not, it's delicious. It's perfect as is, but I do add a pound of beef sirloin. I also brown the chicken and the beef. If you find it too soupy, use two 14 oz cans of tomatoes instead of one 28 oz can, and drain one can while keeping the liquid with the other. Perfect on a cold evening, with a crusty bread and a big red wine.

I made it like the directions said except I added 2 cloves of garlic and 1 small can of tomato paste. There was too much liquid so I thought the tomato paste would thicken it up some.    Next time I will cut down on the liquid.  Also, it was way too spicy.  When I make it again I will only put 1/2 teaspoon or less of  cayenne pepper in it.  It had a great taste and I will make it again with those few changes.

Very Delicious! I prepped all the ingredients for my husband to make an easy dinner while I had a long day at work. Turned out great!  The leftovers are great too, had them for lunch the next day. All I did was add some extra kick to spice it up. Very easy and yummy.

probably would half the recipe for my small little family. Used a kielbasa type sausage and a few links of the Louisiana style sausage from Costco. Used the allrecipe cajun spice mix. Didn't have a green pepper. Pretty spicy! However, I did add about half a cup of rice at the end (it took longer than I anticipated to cook in the crockpot - 40 min? at high) which made it a much thicker consistency, but less spicy and still yummy.

Made it for my son and husband. Good base recipe. I followed another reviewer and drained the tomatoes before adding them in the pot. I also added more spices as we are a spicy kind of family and it was great. The only thing I would change would be to maybe add a rue or something to make it thicker.

I wanted a slow cooker jambalaya that was authentic and tasty. I read the reviews and decided to give this one a try. My husband and I loved it! Easy to adjust for personal preference. Thanks to Colleen and to the reviewers for the great tips!

We made this tonight and it was AWESOME!! It rates up there with the cajun restaurants in Houston, TX. The only change I made was to half the cayenne and add a can of tomato paste because I was a little short on the diced tomatoes.  But I will use the tomato paste next time too.

I made this in my instant pot type cooker tonight vs the slow cooked way and it was tender and flavorful. You can saute the onions first if desired, then add all the ingredients except the shrimp.  I set it on poultry setting,  then did a quick release and while it was cooking, I made rice on the stove.  I didn't have any shrimp, but if I did I would have added them afterwards and placed the pot on saute for a few minutes while it simmered and the shrimp cooked. Yum! Start to table was 30 minutes.

I haven't made this particular recipe, but being born, raised and still living in south Louisiana, this has all the ingredients of a good jambalaya but it isn't what we Louisianans would call  "jambalaya". This would be more of a gumbo with a thin sauce instead of the thicker roux sauce used to make gumbo. This recipe would be a Jambalaya if were to be cooked with all the ingredients listed including the addition of uncooked rice to the mixture (2 cups of liquid to each 1 cup of uncooked rice) and then steaming out the liquid. As previously mentioned, all ingredients listed in this recipe are the ingredients of a good jambalaya, but the way it is being cooked and served over rice would be considered, in south Louisiana, a gumbo. With all that being said, I would still eat it and believe that I would enjoy it also.

I thought this was a great slow cooker meal.  I work 10 hr days, 4 days a week and I love my slow cooker.  The only changes I made were to add 2 cloves of garlic and 1/2 tsp of the cayenne pepper (I think it would have been fine with the full tsp..we like our spice)  and only because I added chilies to it...the only changes I've made were for personal choice.  I also cooked my rice in the crock pot. I have my hubby stir it in about an hour before I get home.   I put the shrimp in as soon as I get home and it's done in 30 minutes.  I did not have any problems with it being too watery.  This with a nice garlic bread is a full meal.  We enjoyed it very much.  Thanks!

So easy and was awesome. Everyone loved it. I did not add the cayenne pepper and I used Oktoberfest sausage so it was not spicy at all. Yes it was soupy  so next time I will  half the broth and tomato juices. But the rice did soak up the juice for the leftovers. Could even keep the liquids and add uncooked rice??

This recipe is WONDERFUL. my husband ate half of it and loved it...me tooo!!! Thanks for sharing. I added  a tablespoon of olive oil and since my hubby is allergic to shrimp, I did not add. Also, I did not have the parsley either and I did use creole seasoning because that is what I had. But this recipe still rocks and is the BEST Jambalaya I have ever had and made. THANKYOU THANKYOU THANKYOU Colleen. Very simple and will be a REGULAR in my crib...

Made this for my Office. Plugged it in at 11:00pm and it was all set to go the next morning. I swapped the Andouille sausage for Turkey sausage and it was fabulous. lots of likes from the office staff.  Thanks for the super easy recipe!!

Great one pot meal.  Very tasty.  Made with uncooked chicken after cooking vegetables.  Placed the cooked vegetables aside and browned the chicken

The only changes I made was used Slap Ya Mama (Extra Hot) creole/cajon seasoning and chopped two jalapeño peppers with seeds and pulp. It came out great!

We loved it.  As it is just 2 of us I cut the recipe in half.  After reading the other comments about it being soupy I took and added a cup of rice into the crock an hour before we were ready to eat.  Came out great.  Only thing I will do different next time (yes this recipe has a future in my home) I will cut down on the cayenne pepper.

This was easy, tasty and had a really nice consistency.  We ended up just adding the rice to the crock pot towards the end with a little extra broth rather than serving it over rice - delicious!

Due to lack of time, I had to make the jambalaya on the stove top.   I used one can of crushed tomatoes and diced tomatoes.  I also made the rice separate.  My family loved it! They've already asked me to make it again.  Next time I will try it in the slow cooker.

I am a native Louisianian and a Cajun. I cook jambalaya for my family 2 to 3 times a month.  That being said I gave this recipe a shot and I can absolutely say that this is NOT jambalaya. Jambalaya is an off shoot of Spanish Paella. Both dishes are rice based with the rice being cooked in with other ingredients not served over rice. There is never a "sauce" with jambalaya. The rice takes up all the liquid as it cooks in a jambalaya leaving the finished dish with a sticky  dirty rice consistency. This dish is more like a stew. As others have stated the chicken is overcooked and tough.  The heat was ok but not hot enough for my palate. 

One point on cayenne pepper and spices in general. Cayenne pepper loses it punch with age. So check the dates on those spices before you use them.  Cayenne should have  a vibrant red color and have an obvious pepper smell. If not then throw it out and buy new.  That may be why your dish is bland and has no taste or kick.

I skipped the slow cooker and put the ingredients In a Dutch oven on my BBQ.  I used medium, indirect heat and baked it for two hours. The chicken fell off the bones and the flavor was fantastic.

This dish was wonderful.....my family raved about how good it was. I used Ro-Tel's  tomatoes and green chiles  instead of the regular canned tomatoes, skinless boneless chicken thighs, put the shrimp in the last 15 min and made chi's-chi's cornbread.  I liked it being soupy but in the event you have family members that don't  just make the rice with the juice in the crock pot in a separate pot. Everything was demolished. Will be doing this again and again.  I would highly recommend.

This is an excellent recipe, I'm removing one star because I had to tweak it to get rid of excess liquid. I followed the recipe exactly with 3 minor alterations.

The first thing I did was to not add the cup of chicken stock. I substituted a Knorr chicken bouillon cube without adding any liquid for that. I also reduced the 28 0z. can of diced tomatoes to a 15 oz. can. 

The liquid given off by the cooking vegetables combined with the liquid from the diced tomatoes was about a cup and worked perfectly with the bouillon cube to replace the missing chicken stock.

The final tweak I did was to add 2 cups cooked rice during the last half hour of cooking and it absorbed almost all of
the liquid and the dish was not soupy at all.

My husband and I enjoyed this. I mostly followed the recipe as is, but I only had a can of crushed tomatoes on hand instead of diced - no biggie, and I had a couple extra roma tomatoes kicking around so I chopped those up and threw them in as well. After a few hours of cooking, I tasted it and there was a harsh acidic flavor from the tomato, so I added some sugar, just as I would for most tomato based sauces (I didn't measure, but it was probably a couple tablespoons. I recommend adding a little bit of sugar at a time and tasting it as you go so you don't overdo it). Once I cut the acidity and added a couple dashes of salt I was happy with the flavor. I cooked some long grain white rice in the chicken broth I had leftover and served the jambalaya on top of it. It's pretty spicy, which we love, but if you don't like things too spicy, I would highly recommend cutting back to 1/4 or 1/2 tsp of cayenne.

Made this almost exactly as written: the only substitutions I made were to use chorizo instead of andouille sausage, and, since I was serving over cauliflower instead of rice, 1/2 cup chicken broth instead of one. I didn't find it especially runny, and I'm pretty sure if I'd used rice instead of cauliflower, any excess moisture would be soaked up. Very easy, and very flavorful...though I might add a habenero or two to increase the heat next time.

Fabulous!  The only change I made was to make a smaller batch and cut out the shrimp based on personal choice.  Delicious, easy and quick (the cooking time is long but the prep takes almost no time at all).

This was very bland and overall I was not impressed. I might try this again to see if really good chorizo makes a difference (I used a brand name but it did not seem very greasy like other brands i have used). Maybe try cooking the celery and pepper for less time so they are still flavorful. I also thought it was very watery.

This was delicious! A favourite and good fallback for the weeks where work gets a little hectic. I'm not sure what consistency jambalaya is supposed to have but I've always had it a bit thicker. This was a bit soupy for me so I added some cornstarch, lentils and cous cous to thicken it up. The lentils and cous cous were an afterthought only b/c I had just a little bit left in the bulk bags and I figured it'd be a good way to use it up.

Ate this on wasa crackers and it was delicious.

The first time I made it I used other people's suggestion of canned tomatoes with chiles and didn't like it. This time I just used organic diced canned tomatoes with the juice, just threw in frozen chicken breasts, left out the chicken broth and only put in 1/2 tsp of cayenne. Cooked on high for 4 hours, added raw shrimp and shredded the chicken when there was 30 minutes left. Served over cooked rice, it was delicious, not watery and perfect spice for us.

My first time making jambalaya and i think i nailed it! I couldn't find andouille sausage anywhere(!) so i used keilbasa. I could only find hot/sweet italian sausage or maple breakfast sausage. I felt neither of those could be the flavor i was looking for so i just went with keilbasa. Also, I felt the final product was too runny, so i took suggestions and made 4 servings of instant rice then added this the final half hour. I feel like the seasonings were perfect. The only personal problem i had was that i didnt buy a good quality shrimp. When it was frozen, i couldn't tell that it wasn't shelled, so i had to pick out the shrimp after trying it realizing the shell was still on. Epic fail :( oh well. better luck next time. Everything else was fab though!!

This was so delicious! My whole house smelled awesome all day and my husband literally licked his plate clean! Even my 2 year old daughter couldn't get enough. I did cut down on the cayenne because I have little ones, but this was excellent and we will definitely make this again! Thanks for the great recipe!

Serve over rice and I added more sausage. Not soupy at all so I don't know where that comes from. I added more broth because it was getting thick.

I added uncooked shrimp during the last hour of cooking reducing the temp to warm. This recipe is awesome as written. For us it had the right amount of spice. If you think the sauce is too thin, then add a tad of cornstarch to thicken. Thanks Colleen :)

The jambalaya was a huge success! I added 2 teaspoons instead of 1 teaspoon of Cayenne pepper. I also added a thinly sliced carrot.

Made from ingredients that are not hard to find, this jambalaya is filled with warm, delicious flavor.  Now that is the review of a born and raised Easterner who now lives in the Midwest.  I've not had traditional jambalaya to compare it too, but this recipe gets rave reviews whenever I make it.  The only tweak I make is a little cornstarch to thicken it near the end, then I serve it over rice.

Unfortunately, I could not find Andouille sausage anywhere, and used regular beef sausage instead.  As a result, it was a little bland for me...  I will try it again if I run across some andouille.  I think it would be a 5 star recipe if followed exactly.  Thanks for sharing!

Perfect amount of spice to warm you up on a cold fall day. To make it even easier use a whole prepared chicken from your local supermarket. I also added a dash of salt at the end to taste. Awesome recipe will make again!!

Relatively easy to make, but I thought it was a little spicy - maybe it was the Andouille sausage I used.  Both hubby and I agreed that next time we might try either sweet Italian sausage or smoked sausage.  Also, I used a lot more peppers - 2 green and 2 red peppers; just to up the veggies.  Turned out good with that many peppers.  Will be trying again, but with the changes I mentioned.

I thought it was okay. I really wanted less spicy power and more spicy flavor. I would have preferred a thick sauce too.

I have made this numerous times. I have followed the recipe exactly. This is what I have discovered. Don't use canned tomatoes. I buy 2 average size tomatoes and puree them. You Can taste the difference. For mild heat (husband loved this but I will not make it this way again)1
 tsp Creole seasoning, 1/4 tsp cyan pepper. ( good flavor, no heat )Medium: ( my fav) 1 tbls Creole  seasoning, 1/2 tsp cayan pepper. hope this helps. This is a fun and tasty recipe. I also puree onion and green pepper, My husband loves the taste but will not eat it if he sees veggies. I have tried adding rice. It was awesome the first night, by the next day it was mush. This recipe is better w/ rice on the side.

I like the ease and versatility of this recipe. The first time I made this I found it a bit too hot. So the next time I cut back the cayenne by half. I didn't have Cajun seasoning so I made one off this site so that may have added extra heat. On the advice of others I added cooked rice to the slowcooker this time and it was okay. The rice absorbed quite a bit of the liquid this way so if you want to keep some of that yummy sauce don't do it that way. Thanks for sharing.

Whenever I find a recipe that my kids, my husband, and I all like I do a happy dance.  This jambalaya was easy and delicious.  I did halve the Cajun seasoning and cayenne for the kiddos sake, and that turned out to be a good decision for my family's preferences.  Also, I used fresh uncooked shrimp and threw it in the last 15 minutes because I was slow cooking on the high setting.  Thank you for this family favorite.

It is so painfully easy and so good.   We have made it several times.  Minor revision to how I cook the chicken, since my slow cooker seems to run hotter. I cook it on high for 3-ish hours, leaving the chicken breasts whole.  After the 3 hours, I cut up the chicken and add the shrimp.

I've never had jambalaya before so I wouldn't know if this is authentic or not, but it sure was tasty! Spicy, full of flavour and easy to make.

Loved this jambalaya and did not modify in any way.   My only complaint is that chicken breasts overcook in the slow cooker. Next time I may panfry those separately or use boneless thighs. Bi love the flavor!  Thanks.

good for a change.  very spicy which was good for us but not so much for our 3 year old.  more soupy than I expected.  Not something I would make often but good for a change of pace.

I LOVED this recipe.  It was easy, and really tasty. I served over white rice and made the recipe as-is.  As others say, probably more of a gumbo, but who cares, it was really good!

This was a great meal! It was soupy but I liked it that way. I cooked brown rice separately and added it at the end. My family does not like overly hot and spicy foods, so I only put 1/4 tsp cayenne and added 2 tsp minced garlic and everything else I followed exactly as written. I thought the flavor was great! Will definitely be worth a repeat!

Like a good deal of the other reviewers, it was a little soupy, more like a gumbo then a jambalaya not to mention, yea the spice was simply too much.  I like a good deal of spice, but there was just too much heat to the point that it didn't add to the flavors but simply over powered them.  If I were to make this again, I might do away with the cayenne pepper and sticking with the cajun spice alone.

This was amazing. I added the rice when it was served so it did not soak up alot of the liquid, so this was like a thicker soup.

This is my husband's and my FAVORITE meal. I put the tomatoes in the food processor, add 1/4 tsp salt, and cook in a pressure cooker. I cook it on 10 lbs pressure for 20 minutes without the shrimp. I start on high, wait for the pressure gauge to jiggle, turn down the temp, and cook for 20. I then release the pressure, add the shrimp (2 lbs), replace the lid, and cook another 5 minutes. We serve it with 10-minute white rice.

Like most things on this site, I find this recipe to be the perfect jumping off point for me. I make adjustments as I go, leave things out, put things out. It's a great starter recipe.

Need more spices and maybe chicken needs to be fried a little with some spices before putting it in. The overall dish had kind of confusing taste, depending on which meat you pick to eat.

My husband doesn't like chunks of tomato, and neither of us like chunks of veggies but we loved this.  I used things I had at home - link sausage, pre-cooked chicken I had in the freezer, celery, onion and carrots.  It was fabulous over rice when we got home that night!  With the ice storm hitting Texas today, we enjoyed the leftovers for lunch - yum!

This recipe is awesome! Got lots of compliments from my family..and it isn't too spicy I have a 2 year old and he ate his whole plate of food! Definitely give this recipe a try, a couple things i did different were that i used frozen chicken breast, and used stewed tomatoes with oregano. It was great i just shredded the chicken at the end and spooned it over rice, yummy:)

I've made this many times and change it up just a little each time. Like in reviews, I use a frozen bag of peppers and onions (my favorite are fire roasted) and add some chopped garlic. I use whatever diced tomatoes are in my pantry and I par-thaw the chicken, which makes it super easy to cut up.  I use chicken andouille sausage, add the frozen shrimp according to the recipe and add the exact spices recommended. This is tried and true, ALWAYS comes out fantastic. I do not cook the rice in the slow cooker, I use frozen brown rice and spoon the jambalaya over the top of a layer of rice. I have never found this soupy or dry! One of the best recipes I have ever used from this site!

I loved the idea of making this in the slow cooker, but we didn't love the result. Even though this recipe has the same ingredients as the jambalaya I usually make, somehow it didn't have the same flavor. I'll go back to my other recipe.

My family loves this recipe and asks me to make it a lot! Since they do not like tomatoes I use tomato sauce instead. (don't ask me, I don't get it either but it works!) I love the idea of serving it over red beans and rice instead of just rice... I will try that tonight.

Left out the shrimp because hubby doesn't like.  It is very spicy although I'll say that I didn't measure- just estimated the spices and I did not have Cajun seasoning but looked up a recipe for that and improvised.

I had to 'tweak' this recipe but turned out great. Used a 410g can of diced tomatoes & 2/3 cup of tomato paste. Omitted the shrimp & used chopped ham instead. Cooked rice separately then added to slow cooker when everything else was done & set on low with lid off until the right consistency. Enough for two meals for two people. Delicious!

Amazing! Made exactly as posted. Didn't have Cajun seasoning, so made it up using a recipe on this site. I also used Zataran's jambalaya rice mix. Cooked it separately and served the Jamba over it. Yum yum yum

I thought this recipe was real good and easy to do; I cooked it on High (Slow Cooker) for 4 hours and if you like rice as in traditional Jambalaya, you can add it during the last hour of the cooking and comes out great !!!!

I have made this several times and it turns out wonderful each time.  I like to add extra peppers and hot sauce 'cause the soldiers I feed like it spicy.

Tasted great, but too soupy for Jambalaya. I will make it again and try to remedy that. Thx for the recipe!

I liked it a lot. I didn't have any Cajun seasoning so I used chili powder and it worked fine. I live on my own so made the full recipe and froze individual portions to be thawed and eaten later. 
This is a winner.

The recipe was absolutely delicious! I made it for a potluck dinner and it was a big hit! I added about 3 cloves of garlic and used canned tomoatoes with green peppers and onions. I also used 4Tbsp of Emeril's Cajun Seasoning which includes all of the seasonings called for in the recipe. Everything turned out great!

The chicken added nothing flavor wise, and was dry. If I would add it again I'd have to cut it into much smaller pieces. As it was I cut it into 1/2 inch cubes.

Noticed folks saying it was "soupy" and quite correct UNLESS you mix in about 2 cups of rice with your shrimp when finishing the last 30 mins or so.THEN it is Jambalaya!And a  good one too.My riff was some okra hanging out in my freezer and chopped carrots.I did doubled down the chicken broth knowing rice is to be added.Oh yes I used Hilshire Farms little smokies cause the market was out of Portuguese sausage.Add rice toward the end and I guarantee you anything BUT soupy.

Made this last summer for "the boys" and even though I cut back a bit on the cayenne, my brother commented his mouth was on fire. LOL. Very good recipe, will make again using chicken thighs (more flavor) instead of breast meat.

This is hands-down the easiest slow-cook recipe ever. I thought the flavor was spot on! Husband loved it! It is a little soupy however, but the rice takes care of that :-)  Will definitely be making this again.

You forgot the rice!!  I'm still giving it five stars because the flavor is the shiznit and it's easily adaptable as long as you have those spices.  Just pour this bad boy over whatever rice.  Healthy it up with some brown rice or quinoa.

The flavor was ok - definitely needed some tabasco, but you really can't do sausage in a slow cooker. It came out soft and soggy. The texture was just awful. We will stick to our usual way of making jambalaya.

I tried this & loved it.  I cut everything up the nite before, put the veggies in the crockpot, the meat in a separate container & the spices in a different container.  we like it spicier so I heap the spoons of seasonings.  I put the crockpot in the fridge over nite.  next morning I assemble & start the crockpot.  I find starting with a cold (out of fridge) crockpot, it takes a little longer to heat up but when you are gone for more than 9 hours it comes out really good.  when I get home I start the rice & add the shrimp.  I have given this recipe to a lot of people to try & they loved it too.

This is was an easy and great tasting recipe. I did add more chicken broth (whole 14 oz can) at the start of cooking then added instant rice the last 5-10 minutes to absorb excess liquid. A good hint I read in another review was to cut everything up the night before then you can just throw it together and head out the door the next morning, for those busy days!

I was beginning to give up all hope on this recipe because it was so soupy after cooking for 8 hours, so I made some Basmati rice (lighter and fluffier than regular rice) and added about 2 to 2-1/2 cups to it and it turned out perfect.  Although the spice was nice, I also felt it needed a little bit more of something so added some granulated garlic and dried cilantro.  I would definitely make this again and probably add some diced ham as authentic jambalaya generally has that added to it, thank you for sharing.

awesome! I did saute everything (veggies and meat) with bacon fat before hand. Then took out the fat and added just the bacon. Added in a bag of mixed seafood about 1/2 hour left of cooking and added a cup of rice about 1 hour before it was done. My boyfriend LOVED it!

This recipe is a keeper for me.  The smell was so good while cooking.  Along with the shrimp, I added precooked brown rice (about 2 cups or so) and let that steep for the last 30 minutes.  Rice may be just a preference, but the result was a complete meal that was so hearty and flavorful.  My boyfriend and I ate straight to the bottom of our bowls.  Thank you for posting this!

While its good.  I would say some modifications are required.  I found the chicken and shrimp to be overcooked on high heat (chicken 4 hours and shrimp 30 minutes).  Start the cooking in a slow cooker with the vegetables and add the chicken 2 hours later or cook separately and add once the slow cooker is almost done and add shrimp 5-10 minutes as the food is almost done.

I substituted the andouille sausage for 1lb sweet italian turkey sausage to make it leaner and I used diced tomatoes with seasoning (i think I used garlic and sweet onion flavor). I did not add the shrimp to the pot until I was ready to serve it - I thawed the shrimp and added it at the very end to heat through before serving. I recommend doing it this way to avoid mushy shrimp.  Anyway, I've been eating the leftovers all week with some nice crusty bread. My husband tried it mixed in with rice. Excellent recipe, definitely a keeper!

It had good flavor, and was easy to put together.  But the coloring was a little bland - I think I would be inclined to lightly brown either the sausage and/or chicken before adding it to the pot - just enough to give it a little depth.

I needed an easy dinner for guest arriving at staggered intervals. This was perfect. Everyone went back for seconds. I sauteed my shrimp in olive oil and butter and added it at the very end.

Slow cooker is a good idea, but the only andouille sausage available in my local grocery store was less juicy and released less flavor into jambalaya. I still prefer smoke sausage.

I left out the chicken and shrimp and just used more sausage and I substituted vegetable stock for chicken broth and it still turned out great!
Cooked for a few hours on high and then left my slow cooker on the "keep warm" setting until it was dinner time.

It was a little too spicy for me - next time I won't use as much spice! But still an awesome, easy recipe.

So easy and good.  I omitted the celery because I didn't have any on hand and it was not missed.  Added crawfish tails to the Jambalaya.  Cooked for 4.5 hours on high.  Received several compliments.

Delicious and so easy! I have made this many times but followed the recipe as written the first time and it was great. Now I usually double the veggies to lighten it up since it has three pounds of meat & shrimp. My favorite change is to stir in uncooked rice so it soaks up all the flavor. I use 1 1/2 cups of brown rice so I increase the chicken broth to 3 cups. This still leaves the jambalaya very moist but not soupy. Thanks for a great recipe, it's a new regular dish in my house!

I was disappointed in this meal.  The slow cooking seemed to make all the flavors meld together too much so you couldn't really distinguish between what was chicken or sausage.  It was edible, but I won't be making it again.

it came out great except for one major problem!!! i didnt have all the seasonings listed, so I used a creole blend.  ppl suggested 2-4 T.  Well...I put in 4T!! It is so darn salty now!  Edible, but very overpowering.  Is there any way I can salvage this batch? What can I do now to lessen the taste of salt??

I followed the recipe exactly (for once!) and it was tasty with just the right amount of heat. I served it over rice and that was perfect for soaking up the extra juice. It's so easy in the slow cooker. I would make this again.

I made this for my husband for our anniversary. He loves cajun food and he LOVED this. In fact, there were a lot of left overs and he made sure I froze them so that it wouldn't go to waste.

This recipe is super easy and tastes great!!!! I made the recipe exactly as it is listed but decided to add yellow rice in the last 45 minutes. It is VERY SPICY.  It does have a bit of a kick to it so if you don't like spicy you may want to cut down on some of the spices.  I plan to make this recipe over and over again because its so easy and my boyfriend loved it :) My little brother even enjoyed it and he's a picky eater.

Have never had or made Jambalaya, so this was great!  Doubled the batch and took half for a potluck at work and kept half at home.  Everyone one loved it.  Didn't change a thing and it was great.

Pretty tasty. I especially liked the andouille sausage but next time I think I will crumbled it because it was impossible to slice. Also, I accidently used dried lemon thyme because I forgot to use up the fresh thyme in the fridge and decreased the cayenne pepper by half. Next time, I would like to use regular thyme and decrease the cayenne pepper to 1/4 tsp so the kids can eat it. Served with Cajun Dirty Rice, corn on the cob, and Super Easy Mardi Gras King Cake.

First time I've made jambalaya and I think the first time I've ever eaten it.  This was wonderful.  I couldn't find andouille sausage at my grocery store so I had to buy smoked sausage.  Later when I got home I realized I didn't have cayenne peper so I had to use paprika instead.  It still had a little kick but I would like to use cayenne pepper mext time just to see.  I also added a bay leave.  Everything else was exact.  The chicken was a little tough but that's kind of to be expected when using cut up  boneless chicken breasts in a slow cooker.  You can always try the boneless thighs instead.

I used half of a roasted chicken, skin and bones removed, torn to bite size pieces and put it in at the same time as the shrimp.  This recipe is sooo good!

Jambalaya is one of my favorite dishes. Everything in this recipes is great but all the Jambalaya I have ever eaten has rice in it. I am from the Mississippi Gulf Coast, so that is what I added and it was great.

Thanks for sharing, it was delicious! Served it with  brown rice. For our taste, I only added half teaspoon cayenne pepper. Gave it a nice heat but not too overpowering.

While this is a tasty recipe, it isn't jambalaya. The flavors made a nice semi-cajun meal, but the only heat that came from it was from the andouille. This recipe is a good stepping stone to a real Louisiana treat. Thanks for sharing.

This is the best version yet!  It is very authentic, not a restaurant version of Jambalaya.  I made a huge pot yesterday and there was just enough left for lunch today.  My hubby had 3 helpings!!!

I wouldn't call this a jambalaya. I prepared this as recipe reads and it turned out alright. Not nearly spicy enough and had too many "herby" flavors and not enough of the meats natural flavors coming through for me. Would alter this recipe if I were to make it again.

This was supper simple! Just the usual prep as with any crockpot recipe (chopping, measuring, opening cans 30mins or so). I used a cajun andouille sausage which gave it an extra kick...just the way we like it. I suggest using fresh or resently thawed shrimp purchased that day and NOT shrimp thats been in your freezer for a while. I used a combination and the freezer ones very chewy/stange texture. Also, I would add another cup or so of broth next time just because it was so delicious! I highly recommend this recipe.

The recipe is excellent, a wonderful crock-pot recipe.  I didn't have any boneless chicken breast, so I used chicken wings instead and followed the rest of the receipt to a tee. I let it cook in the slow cooker for about 6 hours and then during the last 30 mins I added 1 cup uncooked rice and the shrimp, turned out AWESOME!!!!

I loved the flavor of this jambalaya.  It had just the right amount of heat. (I do like things spicy and this was very spicy.) I knock one star off because I think it's a bit too soupy.  Next time I plan to at least partially drain the diced tomatoes and want to try adding rice near the end of cooking.  Otherwise a very flavorful dish.

To all of you who said that you have never made jambalaya before, you still haven't.  Jambalaya incorporates rice in the recipe, not served over it.  This would be better described as a gumbo, although you would need to add okra.  But the flavor was good.

Without a doubt. the best jambalaya I've ever had, never mind made myself. The only thing I changed was to leave out the green peppers as I detest them, so purists will criticize me, but they weren't having dinner with me anyway. For thiose who complain it is soupy, get a nice thick slice of multigrain bread to sop up every last drop. It's well worth it!

We made this for dinner this week and it was fantastic!  Great flavor and super easy!  We used Emeril's Creole seasoning for the Cajun seasoning and it worked out perfect.  We added the chicken breasts whole and then shredded the chicken after it was all cooked which I prefer to cubed chicken.  The only other change we made was using chicken sausage instead of traditional pork sausage and it was fantastic!  Less calories too!

Good recipes, but I was expecting a lot more since the reviews were so high.  Maybe it wasn't as good because I didn't add shrimp?  It lacked flavor and was definitely very soupy.  I ended up adding the rice to the crock pot for an hour along with a can of tomato paste to help thicken it up a bit.  I don't know that I would make this again.

I never have all these ingredients on hand.  I substituted the andouille sausage for a kielbasa and I left out the shrimp because I didn't have any.  Though next time I'm going to make sure I get shrimp, I'm sure it will be delicious.  I adore this recipe.  It satisfied every picky eater in my house!!

This recipe is fantastic!  We made it just like the recipe the first time and and lessened the onion to a small onion the next time and used a can of chicken to save time.  My hubby doesn't like shrimp so in the last hour of cook time I used a small glass mixing bowl and ladled some of the jambalaya into it, set it in the crock pot with the rest of the jambalaya, and continued cooking it.  GREAT!!  I got my shrimp and he didn't complain about me trying to "poison" him.

Just made this for the first time, wanted to incorporate the rice so it could absorb the flavor so added 3 cups of cooked white rice (1.5 cups rice + 3 cups water + 3/4 tsp salt for 15min) at the 7.25 hour mark, and let it go in the crock pot till 8hrs.  It turned out wonderfully, the flavor was great, my whole family loved it!  When I went to have another portion an hour later, I realized why people separate the rice from the ambalaya, the rice had become mushy, however, the flavor was still amazing and I'm looking forward to my next bowl of it.  The only things I did differently than the recipe is that I used fresh parsley and thyme, and I omitted the shrimp altogether, as that is a foreign ingredient to our family.

I made followed the recipe almost exactly. The only changes I made were to use the Creole seasoning recipe that tigerhawk mentioned because I didn't have Cajun seasoning on hand, and I omitted the cayenne pepper the recipe called for since the Creole seasoning already had some in it. I don't handle spicy foods very well, but with only the Creole seasoning, it was perfect: not weak, but not too spicy either. I also added an uncooked rice blend and let it simmer for about two more hours. The end product was great, and I will definitely make it again!

I made this recipe exactly as written, and it was great!  I used Tony Chachere's for the Cajun seasoning, and it was pretty spicy!  I would maybe cut back on the cayenne next time.  I also threw my cooked rice into the crock pot with the shrimp, and I won't do that again.  It turned to mush. :(

Fantastic recipe! This is a good one to do when you're busy. Chop the veggies the night before, and defrost the meat in the fridge. Finish cutting the meat in the morning and toss it all in. Dinner is ready when you get home!

I didn't have "Cajun seasoning" but I had Zataran's Creole Seasoning. It worked for us. The next time I do this, I think I will saute the veggies (I also added a carrot) before putting it in the slow cooker to add a more caramelized flavor. I will definitely make it againl

I'm from the south and my boyfriend is New Orleans bred so I can tell you, this is not authentic New Orleans Jambalaya...however, whatever you want to call it, it's AWESOME! We both love it and will definitely be making it again. I used two chicken breasts, which wasn't enough..next time I will probably use 4. I used 1/2 the amount of cayenne and there was plenty of heat. I did use spicy fire roasted diced tomatoes and "Slap Yo Mama" seasoning for the cajun seasoning, so I'm sure that contributed to the heat. Also added about 1 1/2 teaspoons of chopped garlic. It's fine without the shrimp, but who turns down shrimp! Either way will be very satisfying. I boiled about 3 cups of brown rice separately and dumped it in the last 20 minutes. First night it was a little soupy but we were very pleased with the flavor. 2nd night it thickened up closer to jambalaya status, but not what we down south consider jambalaya. Regardless, it's a great cajun dish that is definitely going to become a regular with us. Thanks for sharing.

This was excellent! It was a bit soupy for my taste so i thickened it up with a bit of corn starch and water.  I also left out the celery. Otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. As one person suggested I served it with a boxed red bean and rice mix. This is a real keeper! THANKS!!! :)

I made this yesterday, and this was delicious...had to make a few substitutions as I was out of chicken broth, so used cream of chicken soup and rinsed the can out with White Zinfandel.  My wife doesn't normally like my Cajun cooking, but she loved this one...but had to give her a plate before I put the shrimp in.  We're going to cut up and ziploc these ingredients, then slow cook all day when we go horse camping...after a long ride, this will be just the treat, and use the bags of microwave rice to keep it all simple.

Although I tweaked the recipe (as I always do), the base recipe for this jambalaya was excellent. Up until then, we had only had Zatarains brand jambalaya from a box (I'm sorry to say) and had not had the pleasure of tasting something truly authenticly cajun - until now. Since then, we've actually eaten jambalaya at a real cajun restaurant, and I must say that this jambalaya tastes as good or better. We tweaked the recipe by removing the cayenne and doubling up on the creole seasoning, substituting basil for oregano, and substituting the andouille sausage for regular old smoked sausage (only because we like it better). Otherwise we stayed true to the recipe and we love it! It has become a staple dish at our house.

This recipe is great!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly.  It is a bit soupy but I used some of the excess liquid to make my rice (I used a mix of the jambalaya liquid & chicken stock to make a flavorful rice).  I served the Jambalaya over the rice and then stored the leftover Jambalaya & rice together in a container.  The rice absorbs some of the excess liquid so when you reheat it, it tastes great & the rice is moist.  My husband swears it was better the second day.  I will definetly make this again.  I think the only thing I will add is some garlic.  The rest is perfection!

It was good! We had stewed tomatoes on hand vs. diced tomatoes, and it substituted just fine.  We will make again due to the ease and the great taste.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was good. I didn't think it was spicy enough though. As everyone said, it is more like a gumbo. I will make again.

Amazing recipe my picky husband even liked it, I did not add chicken I added an extra tsp of cayenne pepper and used turkey sausage so tasty over white rice.

This recipe was okay. I thought it was kinda thin like a soup. The stores around here didn't have that sausage the recipe called for so I used italian sausage. I thought the flavor was lacking for a creole dish. It wasn't bad, just wasn't spectacular.

This is a good recipe,the best advice I can think of is to spice to taste, Cayenne has a kick. Only modification I did was to omit the sausage and stir in cooked rice.( I also cooked my rice with half water and half chicken broth)

First time I have ever made Jambalaya and I do have to say it turned out GREAT! I just made it a little different because I didn't have the time to put in it in a slower cooker so I made on the stove top. Browned all meat(used whatever sauage I had)first sepreatly then removed it, cooked onion till yellow then added everything in and let it cook till most of liquids were gone, cooked rice and that's it! Ohh I did add a hot green pepper not sure what kind but I seeded it and deveined it and chopped it, and a teaspoon of minced garlic, turned out great!

I made this on the stove top instead of crock pot and it was delicious.  I used crushed tomatoes instead of diced by mistake, but worked out great.  I add a box of Zataran's Jambalaya rice into it at the end which adds extra spice and it is wonderful.  Made this for friends who absolutely loved it as well.  Will definately make again.  A bit time consuming with all the prep work but well worth it.  Not sure I will try it in the crock pot, may just stick to making it on the stove.

Good, easy recipe.  Even my 2-year-old enjoyed eating this.  My husband thought it lacked spice so for an adult crowd, I would add more spice to it.

This was a really good recipe!  That being said, I'll tell you that I am being a total hypocrite because I can't stand people who don't follow a recipe and then rate it but this time I was one of those people...I didn't have chicken breasts so I used thighs and I didn't  have dried parsley.  Toward the end of cooking I thought it lacked a little sale so I added a teaspoon, which made a huge difference.  I agree with others, too...this recipe is rather wet so I would try one of three things...cooking the rice in the crock pot, reducing the liquids by about 1/3 or cooking on high with the lid off for the last half hour to hour.  Overall really good though.

this was good but lacking some flavor.  i haven't figured out what it needs.  I added 1 cup of rice and double the chicken broth, because of the rice. It was good, but lacked some flavor.

I would not make this again.  I had to add a ton of salt and garlic powder because it was so bland. I think it's pointless to add 3 kinds of meat in a dish when everything ends up tasting the same by the time it's done cooking.  The chicken was dry, and the meal does not look appetizing at all.  Not good.

I followed the recipe exactly, because I think it's ridiculous to rate a recipe that you've changed extensively.  It was wonderful, and my husband was crazy about it!  I will add garlic the next time that I make it, but the extra juiciness does not bother us; we serve with a slotted spoon.  I highly recommend it!

This is fantatic!!! I didn't change a single thing and it is outstanding!! The andouille is hard to find so went to Whole Foods. Theirs is fresh, so I had to slice it, fry it a little, so it woudln't fall apart in the crock pot. Used slightly frozen chicken, cut up. I can't stop eating it, it's so good. Thank you Colleen!!

super easy, was excellent! I chopped and prepped everything but the chicken and shrimp the night before.  Threw it all in the crock pot.  In the morning threw in a couple frozen chicken breasts and later shredded.  Added rice directly to crock when added frozen shrimp.  Had to add about 1/2 a cup of water for the rice.

This is VERY good, but not like authentic Jambalaya. It is a "brighter" version as it is missing the dark smoky base provided by a roux.  Our family enjoyed it - So easy to make!

This is a keeper.  I made it with creole seasoning since I didn't have Cajun and I doubled the amount.  I also added 1 tsp. garlic powder and 1/2 tsp. salt.  I am counting calories so I skipped the rice. Very good.  Thanks Colleen.

The first night I served over rice and it felt like I was serving spicy watery soup over rice.  To the leftovers, I added a can of cream of chicken soup and dumped the rice right in.  I liked it better that way.  Will make again with the cream soup and rice mixed in.  Also, I didn't have breast meat so I used dark meat.  I would probably do that again - it was good and very tender.

Yummy!! Don't need very much sausage, used 2 chicken breast and a cup of shrimp. Didn't have creole spice-may add it next time. Followed the other directions for spices, added a little black pepper as well. Added mixed green, red and yellow bell peppers. 2 small onions and a can of butter beans.

Absolutely wonderful.  I used hot italian bratwurst instead of the andouille sausage, because that's what I had on hand.  The rest of the recipe I did as is.  Everyone in the family, including my two boys, really enjoyed it and said it's definitely something to make again.  Thanks for sharing!

This Jambalaya was so good! I didn't have time to use my slow cooker, so I pre-cooked the chicken, shredded it, then threw everything in a stock pot. I left out the shrimp since I don't like seafood. Ours was very spicy and very good!!

Wow this was great! The only changes I made were that I did not add the cayenne pepper (my personal preference) and we halved the recipe. I thought it had great flavor and a nice kick from the andouille and spices in the cajun seasoning. Next time maybe I would add the veggies in a little closer to serving time for more of a crunchier texture, but again thats just personal preference. Delish over rice, and great the next day. Definitely try this one!

I didn't have time to do this in the slow cooker so I dry fried the chicken with the herbs/spices then added the vegetables (plus 4 chopped cloves garlic), tomatoes, chicken stock and some paella rice. Brought it up to the boil and cooked stirring constantly for 40 minutes.  It was delicious. The whole family raved about it.  We get a lot of paella in Spain but it was nice to have something with a bit more bite.  Thanks for posting Colleen.

This is a good base recipe, just needs a little tweaking. I added 2 tablespoons of tomato paste and 5 dashes of worchester sauce to help deepen the flavor a bit. The jambalaya was very thin and soupy, so I added okra and made a slurry with 2 tablespoons of flour and 5 tablespoons of the hot liquid from the recipe to thicken it up. Also, be aware that the chicken can become rubbery if cooked to long, so cut the chunks larger and that helps.

This was pretty easy, especially if you use frozen chopped onion and pepper.  I didn't have Cajun seasoning, so I looked it up on this site and made it from that. I used sweet italian chix sausage to reduce calories and fat but it worked out great.   My husband said it was great, so he gave it the 5 stars.  Cooked in less than 4 hrs on high. Chopped the chicken up small towards the end, before that I just cut each breast in 3 pieces.  Added shrimp while I cooked the rice.

Wow what a great meal!  The flavors really mixed very well together.  I used two whole FROZEN chicken breast and took them out after 3 hours on high shredded/cubed and put back in there, turned to low and cooked for another 4 hours.  The chicken was so moist and perfectly cooked.  This is pretty spicy.  My 8 year old son LOVES spicy...he ate this but I think it was a little hot for him...perfect for hubby and I.  I will for sure make this again....my hubby just could not get enough of this...he loved it

I read this recipe and had to make it.  Being as shrimp isn't in my budget, I left them out and added a can of kidney beans for extra protein.  I also used boneless skinless thighs - for price reasons and a few reviews said the chicken was dry so i tried to keep it moist.  I also added mushrooms because I had them in the fridge and didn't want to waste them.  It was delicious!  It's definately a keeper and will be in my rotation of crockpot meals.   My ten year old even ate the mushrooms!!

Amazing and extremely easy to make. I personally don't like too spicy foods so I put 1 and a half tsp of Cajun and .5 tsp of cayenne. This still had a pretty good kick, but by the next day it had mellowed out a bit. Excellent recipe though!

Not putting the rice in the recipe allows you to freeze the jambalaya for later meals. What could be better? A crockpot meal that you can freeze!

I am not much for sausage etc. My son loves Jambalaya so found this a few days ago on Allrecipes. My hubby, son and daughter-in-law loved it. I added about 2 1/2 cps of minute rice the last 1/2 hr. when I added the shrimp. I will give it a 5 star since they loved it :)

Maybe I am wrong, I'm not Cajun but this seemed more like a gumbo than jambalaya. Never fear - next time I am just going to throw some uncooked rice in the crockpot along with the other ingredients. Good recipe - it made the cut to my recipebook.

This recipe is awesome!  Thank you Colleen!  Probably one of the best slow cooker recipes I've found.  I didn't change the recipe much...I actually increased some of the spice amounts because I'm from the southwest and I like my food spicy (smile).  I also followed another reviewers advice and added 2 cups of rice to the slow cooker during the last 30 minutes.  Really, truly excellent!

I give this 5 stars; however, I will agree with other reviews and say that it is very soupy.  I followed the recipe to the letter.  I cooked rice separate from the Jambalaya, and in the end the Jambalaya came out pretty soupy.  Next time I make this, I'll use the extra liquids from the Jambalaya to cook the rice.  That will help drain the Jambalaya, and it should give great flavor to the rice.

Amazing!! I followed the recipie exactly except I didn't put in chicken just because I didn't have enough. I invited friends over and they loved it! It's spicy, but if you put it on a bed of rice, it's not too bad. I will definitely keep this recipie around!

I thought jambalaya was a laborious dish, but this was SO easy!  The level of spiciness is perfect.  Make sure you really wait until the END to stir in the shrimp. I thought it'd be nice to have everything ready when I got home in the evening and let the shrimp slow cook for HOURS... it didn't have that characteristically crunchy, shrimpy texture.  Some fun ideas for add-ins: okra, corn, kidney beans... yum!  Thank you, Colleen!!

Pretty good, a little spicy for us, and next time I may leave out the shrimp, since I liked the sausage & chicken better.

I just love following a recipe as is and getting the expected result.  This is SO EASY, and so great!  I had friends over and they all loved it!  The kids did complain a little about how spicy it was, so in that case you might wanna cut down on the peppers.  Also I'd say this serves 8-9 people well, definitely not 12.

This recipe is great!  I do add a few modifications, however.  I add 3 minced garlic cloves (I'm crazy for garlic!), 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce, and 2 tsp Louisiana hot sauce.  I also axe the green pepper, but that's just a personal preference.  I always add 2 c of rice 30 min before I serve, just to soak up the extra liquid.  Makes great leftovers!

This is a good starter recipe but needs work on the seasonings.  I didn't add the cayenne pepper until after so I could adjust the heat for my family.  It's pretty bland, cayenne pepper adds heat, not flavor ... added extra cajun seasoning (I used Emerils) and then added some Old Bay seasoning as well.  I would give it 4 stars with those adjustments.  It still doesn't have that authentic jambalaya taste you get at cajun restaurants.

This was pretty good.  My first jambalaya recipe, so I didn't have any basis for comparison.  Normally, I wouldn't write a review if I made changes, but I don't think the changes I made affected the outcome of the recipe--I just thought I would note it for future reference...My husband doesn't like onions and peppers, so I pureed all the veggies except the tomatoes, and dumped all the ingredients in the slow cooker to sit in the fridge overnight.  Made it very easy the next morning to just plug in and go.  The flavor was super.  The texture wasn't so great.  Kinda grainy.  I would have preferred it chunky, but the end result was really good.  I served it over brown rice.

Ww loved this recipe!!! I added a bit of spice though. I added 1/2 a jalapeno chopped fine, used a low fat chicken sausage instead of the andouille, and used a 10 oz can of r-otel and a 14 oz can of tomatoes and omitted the shrimp.

Great flavor!  I didn't cube the chicken, I put it in whole and just let it fall apart, mixed 50/50 andouille & Eckridge skinless sausage, and I doubled or probably tripled the Cayenne & added some Tabasco (made for my family from New Orleans who likes it SPICY).  My crockpot isn't big enough to hold the shrimp & rice so I had to cook rice seperate and combine everything stovetop for 30min while shrimp cooked.  Will make again!

I really wanted to like this, but in the end I just thought it was ok.  I will try it today for leftovers to see if the flavors have jelled a little bit.  I only cooked it for 4 hours in the crock pot because my chicken needed to thaw.  My veggies were still crisp.  I think this is one of those dishes you don't want to hurry.  The other thing about this recipe is that it is VERY spicy.  I have a spicy palette and add Tabasco to almost everything.  I had the bottle of Tabasco on the table and almost added it before I tasted it.  I decided I better taste it first if I was going to rate it and boy I'm glad I did.  This was spicy.  I thought with the amount of meat and liquid and rice the spice would be absorbed.  Spicy was all I could taste- no other spice.  I would cut the spice in half- most people would not be able to tolerate that amount of spiciness.  I did not find any thing off with the amount of liquid in the dish.  Thanks for sharing.  I'm glad I finally tried this one.

This was really good! I used water because I didn't have chicken broth and it was still very tasty. Easy to make. Next time I would only cook the shrimp for 20 minutes because they were softer than I would have liked.

Great taste! It was a bit soupy if you go straight from the recipe but I just threw in some oyster crackers and they mopped up the extra taste

i did not like the flavors in this at all.  maybe the onions or bell peppers were too chunky.  maybe i don't like oregano.  i followed the recipe exactly and will never make this again.

Very good and very flavorful!  I took someone's advice and added in frozen uncooked shrimp with about an hour left of cooking time and it turned out wonderful!  Highly recommend this one!

This was very simple to make and wonderful to eat!!! The only thing I changed was adding smnoked sausage (I am an AVID couponer and I have a stock pile of .25 packs of smoked sausage, so I use it as much as I can) and even my picky son and his friends loved this!

This is such an easy and good recipe. It is great for a busy day when you still want a home-cooked meal. The seasoning is great.

I love spicy food, but this recipe is almost too spicy for me.  Next time I will use less cayenne pepper.  It is good though, actually better on the 2nd day.  I served over wild rice.  I gave 4 stars because my hubby couldn't eat it (too spicy).  I will make again.......thanks for sharing!

This has to be the best recipe I have gotten from this site! I have made this twice as written except for omitting the chicken (just don't think it's needed) and me and my husband love it! I would say it is definitely more a gumbo that jambalaya... but call it what you want because it is gooood!!

it has more of a stew texture. Next time i'll add instant rice to the jambalaya. Hopefully that'll thicken it up.

Delicious and easy!  Per others' suggestions, I did use only 1/2 the amount of cayenne pepper, and added 4 cloves of garlic.   I also drained the tomatoes so that it wouldn't turn out soupy - it worked! I also cooked the rice separately, and added it into the crock pot prior to serving.

This was excellent!  I took some of the advice from others and stirred the uncooked rice in 3 hours prior to completion.  The final result was the perfect amount of 'soupiness' for jambalaya.

this was really good and had a nice kick to it. made it for a small mardi gras soiree and everyone loved it. i cooked it on high for 4 hours, added 2 cups of uncooked rice and switched it over to low. next time, i'll add an extra cup of broth since some of the rice was a little crunchy. super delicious and very easy to make. thanks for a great recipe!

I did everything it said except i omitted the cayenne pepper because of the kids.   WHAT A HIT!  Will surely make this again.  I used the leftover chicken broth and used it instead of water when I made the rice.  Great recipe for a cold winter Montana day!

EASY recipe! Prep time was on the mark. Only 3 minor changes. I used cleaned shrimp from the fish counter at supermarket instead of frozen. Also used hot Italian sausage because could not find the Cajun type.  Omitted the cayenne pepper due not knowing if Cajun sausage was hot spicy or just different spices than mild Italian sausage. I thought if it was not spicy enough when time to add shrimp then I would add the cayenne pepper. I like my spicy dishes medium to hot. With the hot sausage it was hot enough for me. My family does not like hot but they loved this recipe. My brother-in-law, who does not eat leftovers, asked me to save the rest for his lunch the next day.  I thought it had the right amount of sauce. I served it with French bread to soak up the sauce. Yum! Yum! When I made it again I will add the rice or rice noodles to the cooker instead of making it separately.  Definitely will add okra next time. Did not think about it until the dish had been on the cooker for a couple of hours and did not want to go to store to get the okra.

This was a great recipe.  What I did different was leave out the thyme and oregano, (didn't have thyme and don't like the taste of oregano) used two 8oz cans of diced tomatoes with green chilies drained, a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes, teaspoon chopped garlic and did not add shrimp.  (I just totally forgot to get some when I went shopping for ingredients).  The last thing was I used smoked turkey sausage and added about 2 cups of cooked rice at the end of cooking.  Not exactly the original recipe, but it got me started with what turned out to be a keeper for me.  I'm single and live alone so most of it I threw in freezer bags as single servings and will have it for lunch. Thanks!

Made this for the Super Bowl party (Yeah Saints!) It was a huge hit with everyone, even my husband who doesn't like spicy foods.  I cooked the rice seperate and added it to crockpot just before serving.  Simple and tasted wonderful!

Although this recipe tasted fine, I did not believe it tasted like authentic jambalaya at all.  It was more like a pot of meat/seafood and veggies.  Not very flavorful.  I had to add a lot more spices and it still seemed bland.  Good recipe for those that cannot tolerate any heat.  This recipe definitely makes a lot of servings.

This was very easy and very good.  I omitted the green pepper, celery and cayenne pepper because I did not have them on hand and used tomatoes with chiles (drained), celery seed, and a few shakes of red hot for flavor.  Also used some smoked sausage for the andouille, used raw shrimp, and added rice and another cup or so of water to the pot a couple of hours before serving.  I ended up having it in the crock longer than expected, so everything melded together more than I would have liked, but the outcome was delicious.  Served both with and without a little sour cream to ease the heat since I used a spicy sausage and extra seasoning.  I'll make it again, but I think the listed cook time could easily be cut in half, at least.

i made some of this the other night for dinner, though it smelled great when it was cooking it had very little taste.  i used regular keilbasa sausage since i cant get andouille in australia, that might have been why.  but the jambalaya was just way too tomatoey and not enough other flavor.  it could have been the ingredients quality.  australia might just do their cajun a bit different than we do in america. i dont know.  but in my opinion zatarains tastes better.  i may try it again when i have access to all the proper ingredients.

This was amazing.  I made it just as listed, however I didn't have cajun seasoning, so I made my own using pepper, cayenne, paprika, oregano and salt.  Also, about an hour before serving, I threw in a cup of uncooked white rice.  I had my crockpot on high.  I think this helped with the excess moisture that others had mentioned.  It was fantastic!  Rave reviews all around!

I used 1/2 lb shrimp instead of a full pound and added 1 1/2 cups white rice to the crock when I put the shrimp in.  I used the Creole Seasoning Blend recipe from this site as well.  My husband loved this dish, and I loved how easy it was to prepare.

I made this exactly as the recipe was. My husband and I loved it!! Had enough for two full meals maybe one serving for lunch. The first night we ate it without adding anything but the second meal I added rice as the recipe suggested. Both ways it's delicious.Will prepare again.Thanks Colleen!

I made this as written and it was pretty good, but then I added a bunch more cajun spice and cayene because it still needed a little "umph".  Overall, a good recipe for when you want to mix things up a bit.

Fantastic! My Dad loves spicey and for him to tell me to let him know when I make it again tells you it's good! I did substitute the sausage for hot turkey sausage to cut down on the fat. I also doubled the recipe but instead of full cans of diced tomatoes, I used one 28oz can of crushed tomatoes and drained a 12 oz can of diced tomatoes and added them in. We served it over brown rice. I will DEFINITELY be making this a staple in my house.

Delicious.  It was wonderfully spicy and hearty.  I added 1/2 cup rice and the prawns the last hour of cooking.  Served with french bread and sweet watermelon.  The sweetness of the fruit took away some of the spiciness.

Very tasty.  I will definitely make this again.  Although I didn't use the additional teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  The Cajun spice was enough for my northern taste.  Delicious!

I made this today and it was great! The only subbing I did was I added about 1/4-1/2 cup more fat free chicken broth(accidentally!), used 2 cans of tomatoes to make the total amt and one was italian seasoned(figure I would be adding oregona anyways so no big deal), left out the red pepper, and since I couldn't find andouille sausage I used Tony Chachere's chicken with green onion and jalapeno sausage. This dish did not come out spicy though it got hotter the more I ate. If my re-heats are the same next time I may add a bit more. I was afraid the sausage would be too hot but it wasn't. I used the high setting for 4 hours then added precooked shrimp I had thawed in the fridge then put under hot water to finish thawing. I let it cook on high probably another 20 min while i fixed some 10 min brown rice. I got about 9 generous 1 cup servings and it was weight watchers friendly. The sausage and shrimp I used were both less than a pound (14 oz for the sausage and about 12-13 oz for the shrimp)I ate with 1/2 cup brown rice in a bowl since the extra broth wasn't needed!  good recipe and I will make this again. thanks for sharing!

This is a delicious recipe.  I don't care for spicy sausage so I substituted Andouille w/ Chicken & Apple smoked sausage and it was great!  The spice ingredients in the recipe still gave it a nice kick w/o using a spicy sausage. This one's a keeper!  My super bowl guests loved it.

Family loved this.  Found it rather soupy too, so added Minute rice right before serving to soak up extra liquids.  Made serving super easy to have rice already mixed in.

Colleen,  thanks so much for this recipe.  My husband loves jambalaya and I have never found a recipe that does much for me.  This one was the one!!!I followed directions to the T with the exception of red pepper for green pepper, didn't have green.  I made this for the superbowl party and everyone loved it.  I had people eating it before I could get the rice cooked!!!

I made this for Superbowl Sunday and it was excellent!! My husband had 2 bowls!! I did add a little (about 1 cup) brown rice towards the end, the consistency was a little to thin for me - this was perfect. I highly recommend this recipe!

I made this for superbowl and I was very impressed!  Everyone loved it.  This is  soupy, but we prefered that and wanted a recipe that had some broth to it.  I cooked rice seperatly and put the jambalaya over it.  I followed the recipe exactly as is and i'm glad i did.   The seasonings are perfect.  It is about a "medium" for spicy.   It was too spicy for my kids, but perfect for the adults :)  The taste is wonderful and I thought it packed a lot of flavor.   Oh, I highly recommend buying deveind, peeled, RAW shrimp instead of cooked...the raw shrimp is a much better texture ...doesn't seem as "rubbery" as the pre-cooked can seem.   I put the shrimp in about 1 hour before it was done and it was cooked perfect.   I will make this recipe often

Loved this recipe!  I cooked (in olive oil) the chicken with the onions, peppers, celery and added about 1 tsp. or so minced garlic.  Added sausage in once chicken was starting to cook, cooked a few more minutes and then transfered to crockpot.  Add all together in crockpot.  Served over brown rice.  This is quite spicy and I loved it but if you don't love spicy food, I'd cut the crushed red pepper down.

One of the very best recipes I've made from this site.  I didn't change much.  Added 4 cloves garlic.  Used uncooked shrimp which actually cooked in about 20 minutes anyway and were really good.  I added 3.5 cups cooked rice from the fridge at the end.  The perfect amount of spicyness.  You could easily serve this to company with a good baguette.

We liked this a lot, especially my husband.  I added cooked brown rice at the end, enough to soak up most of the liquid.  It had a good consistency after that.  Quick & easy recipe!

I, Like many others, love to add a little twist to a great recipe. I had Hot Link sausage so I did not add the cayenne, in the end, perfect burn. But I think next time I will lightly brown the sausage before adding to the mix. I had the cooker at low for 8 hours. At the last 45-30 minutes of cooking I lightly cooked some scallops along with the shrimp and let them finish with the rest of the mix. At some point, I will attempt this recipe in the dutch oven over coals in our Jeep camp!

I have made this many times since I found it online. I make mine on the stove top and simmer until ready to eat. I precook chicken, add the rest of the ingredients, except shrimp, and simmer. Add shrimp at the end and cook until heated. Cuts the time down to about an hour if you don't want to wait for a crockpot to cook it.

My fiance and I love it extra spicy, so I added extra cayenne pepper, a little extra diced tomatoes (I got the Rotel tomatoes with the chiles) and I add a little Mrs Dash Southwest Chipotle seasoning.  It had a nice spicy broth and he hasn't stopped raving about it!

I made this recipes as is except for the andouille sausage, which I could not find at the grocery store, so I took another reviewrs suggestion and used keilbasa.  This dish was really delicious and easy.  Everyone in the family loved it.  I will however be making it with the andouille next time, if I can find it :)

My husband loved this, and I wasn't overly impressed, so I rated it in between his 5 and my 3. Easy to put together, smells delicious, has quite a bit of kick. But I must agree it is "soupy".  Sorry, no factor for me!

Very good but with these additions hence three stars.  Added little bit of tomato paste to thicken, couple splashes of white wine, dash of hot pepper flakes, and use frank hot sauce.  Oh, and added 5 cloves of garlic (sliced).

This was very easy to make and had a great flavor.  I didnt think it was too spicy as some reviews noted.  I think next time I would even add more cayenne pepper.  Overall I loved it!

This was easy and awesome!  Made as stated (for 12) and my husband and I finished it - it was 2 (cereal sized) bowls for me and 3 for my husband.  I did use 1 can of the diced tomatoes with chilis for a little extra kick and did not add shrimp cuz we had it the night before.  This recipe would be great rice too.

It was delicious!  I used the recommended 5 cloves of garlic (sliced), a bit more Creole seasoning and right before serving, I used instant 90 second Uncle Ben's white rice (microwaved it first and when ready - added it to the crock pot).  I used 2 pouches to soak up some of the sauce.  Will definitely make again!  Thank you!

This is the BEST thing I have ever made in my crockpot.  Dh and children loved it!  I made it almost exactly like the recipe except I reduced the cayenne to 1/4 tsp.  It was plenty hot! Thankyou for this great recipe!

This is a good base recipe as is or modified based on preferences or available ingredients.  I used 2 cups of cooked chicken (left overs from a roasted chicken).  I used 2 (14 oz) cans of diced tomatoes (one with chiles) as someone else had mentioned and then only added a dash of cayenne.  I added 2x the chicken broth. I added 1.5 cups of rice when I added the shrimp (uncooked instead of cooked) and turned heat to high.

We had a family baby shower this weekend and were trying to decide what to feed everyone after church.  There were going to be 30 adults to feed.  My son said he didn't want it to be a hassle so he bought a $100 worth of chopped beef at the famous TX BBQ place we have here.  Well, during the suggesting of what to make I said "how about Jambalaya?"  Well the mom to be wasn't really happy on that idea, but I thought I would make a batch for her to taste.  It ended up that she didn't get a chance.  It sat in my refridgerator for a couple of days.  I decided to make some rice and add two pounds of shrimp and if they eat it, they eat it.  OMG, they came inside to fix their plates and they went straight to the Jambalaya.  I had throw away bowls to serve it in and they went on and on and on about how good it was.  My greatest compliment came from my housekeeper who was born and raised in New Orleans.  She said it was excellent.    This is important for people just taking a taste.  Everyone commented on this.  When you take the first couple of bites you think it's not seasoned well.  Then on that third bite it bites you back and don't know why but your tongue wakes up and your mind and tummy say OMG, this here is some mighty fine vittles.  Then you can't get enough.   I am so glad that it made enough for everyone to try it.  Everyone did too because so much talk was going on about it and the delay to the taste buds.  Thanks Colleen.  Got anymore great recipes?  I'm going look!!

Awesome recipe.  I read the reviews and tried to cut the juices down a bit, but it was a still little too juicy.  I cut the broth down to between 2/3 and 3/4 cups, and next time I'll cut that down to 1/2 cup and add 1/2 teaspoon chicken bouillon, and drain one can of the tomatoes (I used 2 14 ounce cans).  I also couldn't find the andouille, subbed smoked kielbasa and added a little more cajun and cayenne.  Got rave reviews from everyone!

This was a good recipe but watch the spices 1 tps of my homade cajun and a 1/4 tsp.cayenne.  My Cajun is already hot and the andouille can run hot as well,. 2 cans of chicken stock, we like it a little saucier. I waited until  1/2 hour before serving to add the shrimp as it would have made it too fishy. I also used leftover chicken.  I liked the fact that it was like a stew.  We put our rice in a bowl and added Jambo on top.  I think if I told my father-in-law I was making this again he would travel from IA to have it.  Very Good

Fantastic and so easy !  I followed the recipe except I had a heavy hand on the Cajun seasoning and red pepper.  This will be a repeat in our house for sure- and also company worthy.  Only note- when I mixed it all in crockpot it seemed thick but as it cooked the liquids released and it was soupy.  This doesn't bother us, gives the rice something to soak up.  I cooked on High for 4 hours and added the shrimp with one hour left.    Thanks for the recipe !

I made this for our young adult Bible study group.  I did all the chopping and cutting the night before and just put all the ingredients in the crock pot in the morning.  It came out GREAT.  It had a great taste and was plenty filling.  My only suggestion was make sure you don't overcook it.  I think mine went about an hour too long and the meats were overly tender.

A little too soupy and salty but I can see how it could be good.  Will not use as much chicken broth next time.  Everything else was good, will make again.

I cooked it on low for 8 hours and reheated it on high for 1.5 hours the next day. I think I may have overcooked it. The meat was very dried and it was way too watery. Hubby and I like the taste and we both agree on the 4-stars. So I will give it another try with a shorter cook time.

Very good.  However, next time I will bake the sausage in the oven for a short while, to get rid of some grease.  I live in southeast Louisiana and this is almost as good as it gets. Definitely a keeper.  Thanks for the recipe.

I really loved this recipe!  I did not know what andoullie  sausage was/couldn't find it/ therefore didn't have it. I took another reviewers suggestion for this problem and used keilbosa and added more cayenne to add more spiciness.   I cooked 1 cup rice (which made 2 cups), and added it at the end. It does soak up all the liquid even if its precooked. The recipe calls for the Jambalaya to be served OVER the rice, so those complaining it soaked it up, we weren't supposed to put it in the pot. I did because I like it mixed. Next time I'll only cook 1/2 cup of rice if I'm going to mix it in.  My hubby took it to his mothers the next day (work at family business), and every ate it, and some took it for lunch the following day!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was excellent..I followed the recipe except I used fresh shrimp the last 30 minutes. It had wondeful flavor and just the right amount of spiciness. Yes there was a lot of juice but I think that's unavoidable due to the chicken and sausage giving off their liquid. The leftover liquid would make a wonderful soup starter. I will be making this again for sure!

This was a huge success tonight!! I didn't have diced so I used crushed tomatoes. I was worried it would be too tomatoey, but it's delish! Hubby can't have salt, so I used my Homemade Cajun Seasoning & homemade chicken broth. Didn't even have any shrimp, but it was devine! Had it over brown rice. Will make this often, thanks!

Phenomenal.  Next time I will add more seafood and less chicken.  Scungilli and the like.  But if all you do is follow directions, you will be very happy.

I have never made or tasted Jambalaya and now I know what I was missing:) This recipe is so good!! I needed to use up a lot of leftover smoked sausage so that was the only meat in it but it was still fantastic...will make again!

I used frozen diced onions and bell peppers and subsited okra for the celery and it turned out great!  Next time I'll add the okra later because it cooked too long and became a little slimey, but the taste was still great.  I also added some garlic powder and Tony's.

this is more like chicken creole instead of jambalaya but it was wonderful no matter what! I had to improvise on the ingredients (had no sausage and used stewed tomato instead of diced). It was  a little juicy but turned out perfect with adding cooked rice into it

This isn't typical Louisiana Jambalaya, but this recipe is awesome. I loved it! My husband said too much tomato, but he went back for seconds. I didn't have celery, but didn't really miss it. This is worth a try, and will fix it again.

Absolutely delicious! This recipe has the perfect New Orleans jumbalaya flavor!  Adding 2 cups of instant rice (I used brown) in the last 30 minutes is KEY! Made it the perfect consistancy -- not too soupy, not too dry!  THANK YOU so much for the recipe! I will make it often.

Very, very good. I added the tomato paste as others have recommended, but we still thought it could use a bit more tomato. Will add more next time.

Tasty and easy to make.  I used frozen shrimp that defrosted in the refrigerator, and  added them at the last minute, just enough to heat up...so they wouldn't get too tough.  I didn't drain the tomatoes and I added a bit more spice.  I'll make this again!

I made this for work for Fat Tuesday.  I doubled the recipe, in hopes that there would be some to take home for dinner. There wasn't.  Everyone raved about it!  I will be making this again, this time for the family!

I made this recipe for our Mardi Gras party.  I used spicy sausage so I only put in half the cayenne pepper amount.  My guests raved about it.  There was not one teaspoon left!!

I really loved this.  The only things I differently were to use Fire Roasted Tomatoes instead of stewed, used 2 Anaheim Chiles in lieu of the Bell Pepper, used about 1/2 of a large onion, used kielbasa instead of Andouille because that's what I had and left out the celery because I didn't have any.  I made some long grain rice in my rice cooker, poured the jambalaya over the rice and it was excellent.  It is more like a soup (very brothy) but does well over the rice.  You can always thicken it up w/Wondra or even cornstarch, I prefer Wondra however.

This is a great meal that we love coming home to at the end of the day. We modified it slightly - instead of serving it over rice, we add 4 cups of cooked rice to the crockpot at the same time we add the shrimp, then let it simmer for another 30 minutes before serving.

Started making this years ago. Now it's requested for all get togethers.  Super easy!  I add okra too as it thickens it and just because I like it!

This recipe is wonderful. I tripled the recipe and made for my freezer club. I love spicy food and I thought the spice  was perfect, but my DH and DD's found it too spicy. I am definitely making it again but will use kielbasa sausage.

I have made this twice now, the first time I added the cayenne and my 9 year old tried it and said he liked it, but, it was too spicy. Tonight he loved it. I added cayenne to my own bowl and it was perfect.  I do leave the shrimp out, we don't eat it, and it is perfect without it. I added some cooked Texmati rice at the end of the cooking process.

This is definitely going to be a go to recipe for me, I always have the ingredients on hand and it economical also.

I've never had/made Jambalaya before but my husband was craving some so I gave it a try.  I'm so glad I did!! He had a huge bowl and loved it.  I don't usually like spicy food but the flavor was wonderful.  I didn't change the recipe but I did remove about a cup of the liquid, added the rest of the chicken broth and used that to make instant rice on the stove.  The perfect addition to the Jambalaya!

This was great and so easy!  And I completely disagree with those who said it was too spicy.  If you like spicy food, the spice was actually perfect.  The only change I made was to use the fire-roasted diced tomatoes in place of the regular diced tomatoes.  I served it over some brown rice and it was awesome.

This was great! It was a bit soupy, but I cooked rice on the side and then ladled the jambalaya over it and topped with diced salad onions - delicious! I wasn't able to get andouille, so I used kielbasa instead and 'kicked the cayenne up a notch' as one reviewer suggested - but a notch is definitely a notch, not another half teaspoon! I used about 1.25 cayenne all in and it was a bit too hot - so word to the wise for those that can't get andouille. In all, a fab recipe that my boyfriend and I will be enjoying for 2 more (very satisfying) meals - thanks for posting!

I have to give this recipe a FIVE!!  I made this last night in the crockpot with all ingredients and it turned out fabulous.  The perfect mixture of flavors and texture.  My husband really like it, and he is a PICKY eater.  I can tell this took you some time to tweak, Colleen...Job well done.

Made this last night.  Added a little more herb and spice.  Added 5 garlic cloves-sliced.  The recipe didn't call for salt, so I added sea salt, which enhances and bonds all the flavors and prevents blandness.

My husband and oldest daughter loved it!  The 2 and 5 year old liked it, but complained that it was too spicey, but they ate it, so it must have been pretty good.  We are eating left-overs for dinner tonight - I can't wait.  This recipe is a keeper

Quick and easy. Chopped everything up, threw it in my crock pot and came home to mouth-watering jambalaya. I subbed crushed red pepper for the cayenne (I was out) and it worked wonderfully.

I made this pretty much to the recipe except with more spice and I used Kielbassa because Andouille sausage was not available. It turned out ok, but not great. The flavour was not what I remembered from my visit to New Orleans. Mostly it was just spicy with no depth or fullness of flavour.

I changed the recipe a bit by adding frozen pepper stir fry mix, a cup of uncooked rice, and for chicken I used some frozen boneless spicy chicken wings. Results were excellent and everyone loved it. The consistency was perfect, the spice level just right.

I thought this had great flavor and was quite easy.  I found that the chicken and veggies were perfect cooked on high for four hours.  Not sure what all the fuss was about it being soupy!  I just followed the advice of other reviewers and stirred in 4 1/2 cups of cooked rice right at the end to absorb the liquid(1 packet of saffron rice cooked w/ 1 dry cup of white rice).  Easy for a work lunch potluck because it only needs to cook for four hours.

I'm rating this for my boyfriend.I made it for him because they don't really have much like it in Australia where we live (I'm from the US so I'm more familiar with this). I actually didn't eat this because I don't eat shrimp or sausage- but he really liked it. We substitued chorizo because it is easier to find in Australia. My boyfriend really liked this- but he was comparing it to the 2 he tried in California at nice restaurants, so he said it wasn't his favorite. He definitely wants me to make it again though!

I thought it was too watery/runny.  Too spicy for me also (either that or my cajun seasoning is mighty potent!)...I didn't even add the cayenne pepper thank goodness, or I wouldn't even be able to eat more than two bites.  I think the flavor would have been fine, just the runny consistency (SP?) turned me off.

This was a huge hit!  I threw all the ingredients in the crockpot this morning and by the end of the football games there was a wonderful aroma throughout the house and dinner was ready.  I did not add the shrimp as my daughter does not like seafood, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  My husband and I loved the spicyness, but next time I will probably use half the amount of cajun seasoning and cayan pepper because it was a little spicy for my daughter.  It was very yummy and a definate keeper!

I have made this for the 4th time, so I wanted to share how much I like this. I share it with my neighbors and they love it too. When I add the shrimp at the end I also add real crab meat(I shred i) which gives a thicker texture. The only think i add is a few cloves of chopped garlic and omit the green pepper b/c i don't like it. I do not add the rice, I make it on the side and I don't mind the juice b/c I can put it over the rice. I am just finishing my second bowl...yummy

Wow! We loved this! The only changes I made were to substitute another sweet pepper right from the garden for the celery (can cook with celery anytime of the year), and I used two pounds of shrimp instead of a mix of shrimp, chicken and sausage.  (When the weather cools down I will make this again with the chicken and sausage added in.)  This is a great recipe with lots of "kick" to it. Thanks for sharing this one, Colleen.

Fantastic!  Made it for Madi Gras and my family loved it (even my 3 year old.)  Made it for a shrimp boil and everyone loved it - even the Louisina natives.  Great for a busy mom.  Use whatever sausage you like - I use Healthy Choice (for healthy food obviously) and make mine shrimp free at times.  Great, great, great stuff!

Yum!  I added a bag of Lipton Sides red beans and rice during the last hour to soak up any liquid.  I still don't know the diff between gumbo and jambalaya, but I know I like this!

I made this last night and it was AWESOME! I shredded a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken from the grocery store instead of the raw chacken breast because I was running short on time. I also used turkey sausage and omitted the shrimp because my fiance isn't a seafood eater. After those changes, this dish was still delicious! I added a tiny bit more ceyanne pepper than called for and found it to be nice and spicy! I served this over white rice, it was an easy, budget-friendly, figure friendly meal that pleased even my picky fiance!!

I made this recipe for my family of seven this past weekend. It was enjoyed by all and there was nothing left. Although I followed the recipe for 12 servings, I was only able to get seven servings - and that's with two children with smaller appetites.  I did serve this dish with rice and sides of biscuits and garlic bread which helped make the smaller servings seem bigger.  Have been asked to make it again, and I will but will definitely adjust the recipe. Thank you!

This was a decent recipe. I felt the shrimp overwhelmed the dish, so I don't think I'm going to add them next time (unless I can find them super fresh and not pre-cooked and frozen). I followed the recipe exactly with no problems. Thanks for sharing!

I combined this recipe with "The Captain's Famous Jambalaya" due to limited ingredients on hand and wanting to use the slow cooker, but I liked the result soooo much I had to post about it.  Here's how I varied it and it resulted in a gumbo type dish with a thick, rich, savory brown gravy.  In saucepan 2 tbs butter, 2 tbs flour-whisk roux 3 min.  Add 1 tbs old bay, 2 chopped onions and chopped garlic, cook til tender (10min). Season w/ ground oregano, dry parsley, 1 tsp cayenne pepper, dry thyme, black pepper, celery salt, ground allspice, ground cloves(amazing mmm) -use recipes to guide amounts. Dump roux into slow cooker.  Dump in 28 oz can diced tomatoes, 2 cups chicken broth, approx 1 lb cubed chicken breast, 1/2 lb sausage.  Cooked 4 hours on high, added approx 1 lb shrimp last 30 min.  Add more celery salt to taste.  I didn't have any celery or bell pepper, but didn't miss it at all.  One ladle of hot package-made rice pilaf into a bowl and then one ladle of "gumbo" from slow cooker and I thought it was great!  
Future possible additions/substitutions for tweaking: more butter, crawfish, crab claws, red snapper, file powder, chopped celery.  I will probably not add the bell pepper because I loved it without.

This is a great recipe! I used chorizo instead of andouille and omitted the chicken broth, (I used a bouillion cube for the flavor). It's a fantastic dish that I will definitely make again.

If you don't like spicy things- this recipe isn't for you. I will make this recipe again but cut the spices at least in half! Overall the recipe was good- I added 2c. minute rice for the last 20 minutes and that soaked up the juice and made it the right consistency.

Deeeelicious!  I cut the recipe in half and made four large servings out of it.  I used smoked turkey keilbasa to cut down on fat (although I HAVE found andouille sausage here in Arizona in the past, believe it or not).  I thought the oregano was an interesting addition...at first I thought it was way too overwhelming, but I warmed up to it pretty quickly.  The next time I prepare this, I will omit the oregano and see which way I like better.  Will definitely make this again!

I thought it was delicious!!! I actually used a few less tomatoes than it called for and really like that- because the tomato wasn't overpowering. I also used a little more Cajun Seasoning.

This was really good!  I made just as written, only substituting turkey sausage for the andouille (can't find it here but I'm sure it would be amazing with it).  It had a surprisingly good flavor - but was not quite thick enough in my opinion and I only used 1/2 c. of chix stock.  Next time I think I will not add any extra liquid but rather drop in a chicken boullion cube instead for that extra flavor.  Okra would be a great addition as well.  But as written, terrific flavor - awesome recipe for being as brainless as it is!  :o)

Very yummy.  I added some instance rice about 30 minutes before I served it.  But not because it was too soupy, but because I was too lazy to bust out the rice cooker.  The only downside was out of the pot I couldn't get a cajun taste.  Wasn't spicy at all to me.  I kept adding flavor but I just couldn't get it right.

I gave it a 3, my husband a 4.  Spiciness is a matter of opinion & I thought it a bit too hot.  (My 4 year old's tastebuds thought we were playing a cruel joke on him.)  My advice is to take the spice amounts into consideration & you will prepare a good meal.

Very good, I added 2 bayleafs, Old Bay, used fresh shrimp, only 1 tsp of cayenne did not have any Cajun seasoning.  Also as others recommended I added 1 cup of Minute Rice the last 30 minutes.  Will make this again.

I made this for dinner tonight, and it was very good.  I added bay leaves and worchestershire sauce, and a bit more heat, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  It was easy to prepare, and very tasty.

Absolutely delicious!!!  we LOVED it!
Didn't have andouille so just used Italian sausage.  Also browned the chicken and sausage before throwing it in the pot! Also used fresh shrimp. Thank you CMW! A definite keeper!

This receipe is not a traditional Jambalya as prepared in the Creolen/Cajun  kitchens in the great city of New Orleans. 
The flavor ican be made more authentic by adding two lafge, or three small Bay leaves. 
In my family the skin of the Andouille 
was removed.
Also, you might try fresh parsley.
Also, and important, The rice is cooked in the in the Jambalaya..

This turned out so good! My hubby was impressed, and so was a visiting friend. I omitted the shrimp because I didn't have on hand, but even without it was so tasty.

I thought that the recipe was very soupy/watery. I added a can of tomato paste and it was still watery. I would recommend reducing the amount of water (it calls for 6 cups.) I would not make this again.  Also prep time is much more than 20 minutes, there is a lot of chopping/slicing involved.

For a slow cooker recipe, this was wonderful.  Granted, a jambalaya cooked on the stove is better, but when you're crunched for time and want something unique and good, this really hits the spot.

This recipe is to die for! This is the only recipe my family and I use when making Jambalaya. My parents usually triple the recipe when they make it, so they can freeze it and thaw it out for dinner randomly. I don't really care for spicy foods, but this one I can handle. If you want it a little less spicy just decrease the amount of cayenne pepper. I will say I have done that before and I didn't like it as much so I just use the recommended amount and have my water close by if I need it. (: We ALWAYS serve this with Basmati rice. 10/10 recommend this recipe.

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious. The second time, I added a clove of finally chopped garlic and that was also delicious. This has become a family favorite.

I used the magazine version which cuts cooking time down to less than 5 hours. The spicy sausage was especially delicious. I wish my kids enjoyed it more.

I have made this numerous times, and it is very good. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of breast. Substituted 1# duck breast (fat trimmed off) for the shrimp. (We have fish allergies)  7 hours on low is perfect. Cooked the rice separately. Rating 4 because of my substitutions.

I LOVE this recipe. I have made it like 10+ times and it always turns out delicious. Sometimes I add a bit more cajun seasoning for a bigger kick, sometimes I leave out the shrimp if I don’t have it. Always great. I find that if you cook
the rice separately and add it in about 30 mins before serving it absorbs the juices nicely. I’ve also made it in my instant pot with rice included and it works great! I just found a random instant pot jambalaya recipe and used that cook time. It doesn’t make your whole house smell delicious like the slow cooker version but it takes less
than an hour from prep to eating! What was an all day cooking meal became a quick after work dinner. :)

Excellent! I made it on Christmas day. Easy to prepare, cook on high, was ready in 5 hrs! The flavor was spot on. As some have stated, it was a little soupy, I added some cornstarch, drained the tomatoes and plated it on top of rice. This will replace ALL of my other recipes!

Fantastic. Thanks for posting!

slight modifications 
--> used only 1/2 cup of stock
--> drained the diced tomatoes
--> browned the chicken and sausage
-->  quickly fried up the veg with the spices and 3 cloves garlic and 4 Thai peppers for added heat...deglazed with stock 

Didn't even use rice, just a fresh baguette for the juice. Sensational! Will make again 100%.

Absolutely one of my favorite meals to make yet.  I made two minor changes by adding a little more heat by using Cajun Andouille sausage and some additional Cajun seasoning and Cayenne Pepper.  It was fantastic.

This was my first attempt at Jambalaya.  I used spicy Cajun andouille sausage and followed the rest of the recipe to a T.  It was crazy good.....BUT next time I make it, I'll make the following changes:  
Slow cooker for only about 5 - 6 hours.
Shrimp in for about the last 10-15 minutes only!

Flavor was pretty good, but way too watery. Mine looked like soup. I foolishly did not read the reviews in advance...so I suppose part of that is my fault!

I made this almost exactly as written. The only adjustment I made was to reduce the cayenne so that it wasn't too spicy for my kids. My family didn't care for it. We found it needed salt. The first few bites were bland. The heat built yet the flavor was still bland. I'm not a jambalaya connoisseur. This recipe has great reviews. Maybe jambalaya is not for us.

Great taste, perfect spice. Had it over rice. Little too juicy, would be nice if a little thicker on the sauce.

My kids and husband loved it! It’s going to be family favorite from now on. I tweaked it a bit by adding a couple of scoops of Knorr Caldo con sabor de pollo  (chicken bouillon) and it tasted amazing. I also used some of the juice to make the rice.

If it comes out too soupy, use the extra liquid to cook your rice in separately. I use a ladle after the slow cooker is done and make my rice with the juice. I also add a bunch of siracha for heat, use hot sausage, and also tomatoes with habaneros. This is a great recipe to make as you please. You can adjust it accordingly for your family tastes

This was very good . . . made some changes  . . . made it in the instant pot, decreased the cajun seasoning and left out the cayenne because some in my family don't like things too spicy.  I also had some Jalepeno sausage that I used instead of the andouille.   The whole family loved it.  I also sauteed the chicken in the instant pot, then added the veggies, then the rest.  I saved the shrimp and added them in the end.

It is about time someone knows the difference between Cajun and Creole cuisine.  I see so many recipes labeled "Cajun" and it is for a gumbo and they put tomatoes, okra and filet into them.  NOT CAJUN!  Cajun cuisine developed mostly from the resettled Adrienne French that were relocated primarily to the areas around Lafayette, La.   New Orleans had a diverse mix of Spanish, Creoles, German and Caucasion people from the North.  There was some crossover, but the cuisines developed their own distinct styles that remain to this day.  Your recipe definitely smacks of the Creole style as the Cajun style is made with a brown gravy instead of a tomato gravy.  I praise you for pointing out the difference.

Delicious!  Made pretty much to the recipe, but added tomato paste, gumbo file, chopped jalapenos, extra garlic, upped the spices a tad, used 12 oz Andouille and 2 lbs of shrimp.  Added 2 cups of jasmine rice and 2 cups of extra broth about 40 mins before done, then the shrimp about 15 mins before done.  Cooked on low for 5 hours total.  Shrimp was perfectly cooked, and so was the rice.  It was spicy, but we like spicy, and it was just right for us.  Definitely a keeper recipe

This jambalaya was very good.  Served guests and they like it to and want recipe.  I left out cayenne since my creole seasoning was very spicy already.

Yes, I changed the recipe.  I cut the recipe in half for just me and my husband.
I used Old Bay sausage instead of the andouille.
Instead of Cajun seasoning, I used Old Bay seasoning. 
I skipped the cayenne pepper and the shrimp.
I cooked just the seasonings, broth, and tomatoes for about 5 hours.
I then put in the onion, bell pepper, and celery (I waited so they would still be a little firm and not mushy).  I let them cook for about 15 minutes.
At that point I put 1C of minute rice.  I continued to cook for about 15 minutes.
It was DELICIOUS and the rice soaked up a lot of the liquid that others complained about.

I didn't have any chicken, so I substituted 1lb of ground beef.  Also, we were out of tomatoes but i had a large can of baked beans so I used that instead.  Everything else was done per the recipe except the seasonings, as I only had creole seasoning in the pantry so I used 4 tablespoons.  I cooked it for 9 hours on high and it turned out thick and sticky, but My kids looooved it and we are now planning on a trip to New Orleans based on the exceptional results of this recipe.  Can't wait!

I didn't add the 1 t. cayenne pepper because that would have been too hot for my Dad.  I used Sweet Italian Sausage links  cut up because that was what I had on hand.  For the chicken broth, I used 1 t. Better Than Bouillon in a cup of water. It has great flavor!  I served with rice.  It was ok, but we felt it was too thin a broth.  So for the leftovers, I added a can of tomato paste and another cup of the Better Than Bouillon Chicken broth.  I also added a package of sliced Andouille sausage.   Served this time over angle hair spaghetti.  It was a hit.  It had much more flavor and I'd fix it again this way. It was nice having the two types of sausage, chicken and shrimp all in one dish.  I might would give it 5 stars with my additions.  Add the cayenne pepper if you like the extra heat. The Cajun seasoning and andouille sausage was enough spice for us.

Like others have said, it was pretty runny so next time I would drain the tomatoes, or maybe a little less chicken broth. The chicken came out overcooked, so maybe I'll leave the chicken breast whole next time as well. Otherwise, the taste was excellent! I also added a can of red kidney beans for a little more protein and substance. Would recommend!

I’ve made this countless times and it never fails to impress. Just follow the recipe and serve over some jasmine rice.

Fantastic! I had to leave the bell pepper out because hubs doesn’t care for them.  The shrimp was a bit tough but the flavor was so good I didn’t even care. Easy to put together in the morning too. I threw the shrimp in frozen when I got home from work, made the rice, and dinner was ready in a snap.  Served with crispy garlic bread. Yum.

A tad spicy for my hub's taste so I'd cut spices back a little - can always add more later or even individually when serving. Probably need to drain tomatoes as others have said- I ended up cooking about 10 hours so some liquid cooked out but a couple hours less would be better as far as the chicken goes. Def need rice but cook separate and either serve on top or add to pot. I cooked shrimp briefly in pan with some olive oil and Old Bay and then added. This is pretty good- something I will cook again!

Made this and it was absolutely delicious! the only thing that I will try to figure out and change a little bit is it is way to much liquid. I did not drain the tomatoes and so next time I think I'm going to do that but other than that it is outstanding.

Yum yum yummmmm I wouldn’t change anything. It turned out perfectly. I added more spice to it because we love the heat. But other than that it’s perfect.

This is delicious!  It will go on the frequently used list. I’m a wimp when it comes to hot spices, so I left out the cayenne pepper.  I also used only half of the sausage it called for and just 12 ounces of shrimp. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and the amount of spice was just right. Left it to cook while we went on a daylong bike ride in the cold wind and rain, put the shrimp in when we got home, then served it over brown rice.  It was perfect for warming and filling us up.

I made this as it called for except 
i used uncooked shrimp, found it a just a tad too spicy and soupy so added the rice to the whole mixture and it was perfect! Lots of meat and flavor! I think I will try chicken thighs next time just because its my favorite chicken part :)

I know I have a sensitivity to foods that are too spicy hot so I cut the Cajun spice and Cayenne measures in half. The resulting dish was still way too spicy hot. In fact, it was so hot my wife could not eat it and I quit after half a portion. So hot I couldn't taste the food. Also, the chicken got way over cooked and was dry. I'd suggest dark meat instead of breast. If I ever make this again, I won't use this recipe. I realize many people like hot stuff, but this is way too much for me.

Did this on high for 4 hours. Chicken was dry, sausage lost its flavor, vegetables turned to mush. Seasoning mix was meh. I did drain the tomatoes as others suggested so the liquidity was fine. Not sure if the problem was choosing the shorter cooking time or what, although I've had bad luck with chicken in a slow cooker before so maybe I should just learn not to do that anymore.

Have been making this for a few years now.  Everyone loves it!  One of my friends told me she cannot order it at a restaurant anymore because mine is better!  I add garlic and for a bit more kick a jalapeño chopped up.  Sometimes I don’t do rice for carb conscious friends; or just have it on the side.  Made it once with shrimp on the side for one of our guests who had shellfish allergy.  Cornbread is a great side with it!

I would make this again. The changes I made are in similar vein to what others have done. I removed four cups of juice near the end and cooked my rice in it. Then I added the rice to the jambalaya. I also added a can of tomato paste. Knowing my mom doesn't like things spicy and that the sausage itself was very spicy, I omitted the red pepper.

This is a wonderful, easy recipe.  I cut the Cayenne by 1/2 for my husband's sake, and left out the shrimp for my shellfish allergic son.  Other than that, I followed exactly.   I put my ingredients in my slow cooker before I left for work and came home to dinner!  I do think next time I will add a little more celery and a little less onion, but that is just personal preference.

Left out the juice of the canned diced tomatoes and it still resulted in more of a soup than a jambalaya texture. Tasty but not what I expected. Will be making again but tweaking some of the recipe.

Great recipe!

1) Be familiar with the andouille sausage you use.  It has a wide range of tastes.

2) Please, don't cook it more that 5 hours unless you like chicken with the consistency of mush.

I made this for an office lunch for everyone. There wasn't a spec left! Just enough heat to make it interesting but not unpleasant. Easy to fix. I prepared everything the night before in the crock of the slow cooker and left it to marinate overnight in the refrigerator. Then arrived a work at 8, set the slow cooker to 4 hours on high. Added the frozen shrimp 30 minutes before. It filled the whole office with a wonderful savory smell.

Cut the cayenne in half. Perfect spice for me, but still a bit spicie for kids. Omitted shrimp, used whole can of chicken broth and added 2 cups instant rice the last half hour. Will make it again!

Turned out perfect!  Just the right spice level to please the family - I added a little Louisiana hot sauce to my own plate for the extra hot!

This was a fabulous dish for Fat Tuesday . I ommited the shrimp and used Cajun andouille sausage. Used one cup of the liquid from crock after it cooked 8 hours to make my rice. The chicken almost melted in your mouth, entire combo was perfectly spiced.

Had the privilege of the cook who made this recipe make it for me, it is wonderful. I say that as I sit with a bowl full for my husband, and I for dinner. This is wonderful, and authentic, thoroughly enjoy the customization on the amount of spice it can include. Love, love, love it!!

This was easy to make and delicious. Perfect amount of spice. In our house we might sprinkle a touch more cayenne when in the mood for more heat, but this is crowd pleasing perfect exactly as written.  With today's varied choices of slow cookers it would be nice if instructions included roughly size to use. I have several sizes and often make chili, soups and stews in my large crockpot, but this recipe fit just right in my 3.5 quart.

Very tasty recipe and easy to prepare according to the directions.  I added a bag of frozen okra in the last hour of cooking and some nice raw shrimp just before serving.  Served it over fresh cooked white rice. It was yummy!

I usually like to make a new recipe according to directions, and then alter it if I make it again, but this time I didn't have the sausage, so I substituted 1/2 link boudin sausage and 1/2 lb Italian sausage. It was really good.

I used fire roasted diced tomatoes with garlic, and added minced garlic; went by the recipe with the spices but plan on using Tony's C cajun the next time.  Added more chicken,  about a 1 1/2lb. Cooked on high about 4.5 hrs. A little soupy but sets up, serving rice absorbs the juices.  Don't overcook, the chicken may dry out.

Excellent. Pretty rich tasting. Fills you up quickly. Unfortunately, as I was carrying the last bowl down to the den to finish it, the bowl slipped out of my hand and shattered at the bottom of the stairs. Went everywhere. :+(    
I will definitely make this again.

After reading the other reviews I decided to stick with the recipe with two exceptions. I omitted the celery and added red and yellow peppers in its place. I also used thawed uncooked shrimp and cooked them the last 5-10 min to avoid adding more liquid from the ice crystals and to avoid rubbery shrimp. Both of these changes worked well. There was a lot of liquid as previously noted so I decided to use it to cook the rice in a separate pot and the solids from the tomatoes caused the rice to burn. I was able to rescue most of it by not scraping the pan and added more water in a new pan to allow it to finish cooking. The flavor was great for both the rice and the jambalaya but when I make it again I’ll try adding the rice to the slow cooker directly.

The only thing I did differently was make my own Cajun seasoning (I couldn’t find it in the store). So I found a recipe for it on this website. This recipe is super tasty though! Everything was perfect.

This was goid, I started it too late to cook  the whole way in slow cooker, but cooked chicken and tomatoes in it first then later came back to cook veggies on stove with ground sausage too soft and added it to chicken tomatoes mixture for last hour of cooking.  Had rice or pasta on the side and everyone loved it. Great one pot meal!

Spicy but I'd experiment with Cajon spice mixes to suit to taste. But overall, worth  the try.

Very tasty. Pretty simple to make. Served over rice. Had a nice kick to it. My son said, “Feels like I’m in New Orleans, down by the river!”

I made this for a pot luck lunch at work. Everyone raved about it! Absolutely delicious. The only adjustment I made was to add 1 additional cup of chicken broth. Definitely a repeat dish.

Omitted the shrimp as we don't care too much for it and went a little heavy on the chicken to compensate, and had to use regular smoked brats since we can't get andouille. Otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. So easy and absolutely fantastic, will definitely make again.

This was pretty good! I halved the recipe but added the same amount of Cajun seasoning as the full recipe called for. I made white rice to serve it over.

Being a native of the Deep South and having lived in Louisiana for several years, the only thing wrong with this recipe is the name.  This is a gumbo recipe, not jambalaya.  Gumbo is more of a soup/stew served over rice.  Jambalaya is closer to a casserole with rice cooked in it.  If your are in Cajun country and want a dish similar to this, order Gumbo, not Jambalaya.
That said, this is great start to family recipe, which all of the best gumbo and jambalaya recipes are.  My main jambalaya recipe is from a family near Fort Polk, Louisiana.   :-)

Although the flavor was nice, but not super-special, I felt like there was about  30% too much rice.  I'd make it again and decrease the rice.

I made this pretty much as described. I added some zucchini and mushrooms since I had them already. I didn’t use a whole pound of shrimp though since I rarely eat shrimp.. I only added maybe 1/4 pound. To compensate I used about 1.5 pounds of chicken. I was unsure of the spiciness so I only used 1 tsp of the Cajun spice and about 1/2 tsp of Cayenne. It had a good flavor but was a bit soupy so I added about 2 cups of cooked brown rice to it which gave it more substance, but it still needed to be served in a bowl. My wife loved it so I’ll be making it again. She said it was perfect.

My Husband loved it; He likes very spicy food, and he said the flavor is authentic Cajun.  It is wonderful the second time around also. The recipe made a lot so I froze the leftover , and just added more shrimp, when we had it again.

I wasn't able to purchase anduille sausage from my grocer, so substituted mexican sausage. This may be why I didn't like it. Unless I can find anduille sausage I won't make it again. Also, the shrimp was chewy, even though I put it in frozen and just for 30 mins on low.

Easy to follow. Perfect taste. 8 hour slow cook time means you need to prepare this recipe in the morning so you are not up all night. Frozen cooked shrimp is a step you don’t want to improvise in.

I didn't use oregano. Being Italian it seemed out of place for this dish.  I used fresh garlic also.

This was delicious!  I added some fresh garlic to the recipe and I found that the 4 hours on high was plenty of cooking time.  It was a little soupy but you really need that so when you put it over the rice there’s enough to absorb.  We will definitely be making this again!

This is the same exact recipe as the Forgotten Jambalaya recipe from taste of home. Been making it for years. All you added was the cayenne and Cajun spices.  You should give them credit.

I use a dutch over on my gas stove. Cook the chicken and sausage together and then lower the heat add the remaining ingredients til they are cooked. One reviewer suggested adding the rice while all was cooking. Do not do this or you will wind up with rice mush.

Really good and simple to whip together when you don't have a lot of time. I replaced celery with mushrooms, just a personal family preference. Then added a can of tomato paste.

I absolutely love this recipe! I've made it a few times now and it's a huge hit. I once added habenaros and it came out so spicy, but still so good. Corn is also an excellent additive. I just popped this in the crock pot tonight for supper and can't wait!

chicken was bland.  Should've seasoned it and browned it for a minute or two before adding to crockpot.  I doctored it up a bit with some more Cajun seasoning and a can of cream of chicken to heighten the flavor profile.  It did the trick.  A can of ro-tel may have fixed the dish, too.  Another possible fix may have been boneless thigh meat.  Dark meat has a nice amount of fat and overall more flavorful in dishes.

Turned out great! It was pretty thick, just how i like it. I used slap ya mama for the cajun seasoning and it was a bit spicy for me but it was so tasty I couldn’t stay away. I will definitely make again but will go lighter on the cajun seasoning.

Love this recipe!  I read from other reviews that it's too soupy, and when I added my shrimp I could tell that mine was turning out that way.  I made a quick roux with 1 stick (8oz) of butter and 1/2 cup flour, and added it to the crock pot right after the shrimp.  This gave it a delicious creamy texture that was perfect over rice.

I added more canned diced tomatoes and chicken broth to make it more of a soup. I also added uncooked shrimp at the beginning, so that the shrimp wouldn't be so tough.

very good.  Since my family doesn't like spicy food, I used kielbasa, and used 1/2 TS of cayenne pepper.  It was a little soupy but next time I'll add a thickener at the end.

I would have given it a 5 star rating had it suggested cooking the rice in the slow cooker.  I read some people found it too liquidy.  Cooking the rice in the slow cooker reduces that to the perfect consistency.  I threw in about 1/2 cup of rice for the last hour of cooking.  It turned out perfect.  Very spicy so if you don't like spice cut back on the cayenne.

This was very good but a little too spicy for me although my boys loved it.  I normally avoid rice but without it I wouldn't have been able to handle the spice. I'm a wimp, admittedly. My only deviation was using an orange bell pepper instead of green for the personal preference.  I may reduce the cajun seasoning next time and leave off the tomatoes.  I also thought there was too much liquid so if I did use the tomatoes again I would drain them and possibly reduce the chicken broth to 3/4 cup.  Will make it again though.  Thanks!

Very good and tasty! And very easy. Omitted celery and shrimp just because I didn't have any on hand. Still very good. Served with rice which I cooked with the excess sauce, using a baster to transfer the sauce from the slow cooker  to the rice pot. Delicious!

We loved this easy jambalaya I threw in the slow cooker on my way out the door. Added rice 2 hours before dinner time and the shrimp 30 minutes.  I also added more broth with the shrimp because it was looking a little thick.

I had to alter it a bit.  No seafood and I added more veggies and left out the tomatoes (food allergies)  I made it on our stove top instead of the slow cooker.  It turned out pretty good for so many alterations. I'd make it again.

excellent - made it 3 times and everyone loves it.  Not too spicy.     The only change I made was to add the andouille sausage  during the last hour.   Cooked it on low setting.

Really tasty! Great recipe, but IMO you only need half of the tomatoes. I like tomatoes but that was  just too many for me. I did use a different smoked sausage and abut half the shrimp. I did use all the spices in the recipe. You can't go wrong with this one!

I fixed this on the stove top because I was short on time that day I made it. I made it exactly according to the recipe aside from throwing in some fresh okra from our garden at the last minute. It was absolutely delicious. My guests loved it and said it was the bed they’d ever had. I would not change a thing to the recipe and can’t wait to try it in my crock pot!

It came out very tasty -- I liked the spice combo.  Chicken in the slow cooker typically falls apart, my pieces actually clumped together when they cooked! But no problems... it came out well, just the prep was a decent amount of work chopping etc.  Not sure that it would take a long time in a standard stockpot, i.e. making it in the crock was probably not really necessary?  It did come out liquidy, so if it was made on the stovetop then I could add the rice directly (like usual jambalaya).

Absolutely perfect for an easy waiting for company meal! Just throw it all in and wait to cook rice. I did use Italian seasoning blend (I have created) in place of oregano. I used Creole, not Cajun seasoning.  I garnish with cheddar and green onion. Company was very impressed.  Served with French bread loaf and salad.

My family thought this was terrific.  I used 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper because we don't like a lot of heat.  I did not have shrimp, so I used more chicken.

We love this recipe in our house. We make it with chicken and smoked sausage as we don't have great andouille options where we are. We skip the shrimp. For the last half hour of cooking I cook up 4 cups of white minute rice using most all the broth from the crock pot. Once the rice is cooked I return it to the crock pot for the remainder of the cook time. This removes the soupiness and it does not end up dry. This is delicious and so simple!

Loved it!  So easy just chop and dump it in.   The only changes I made were to add a small can of tomato paste and 4 cloves of garlic.  Definitely going into my "make it again" stack.  Thanks Colleen!

Delicious! Five stars from the whole fam! I made a couple of substitutions that kept it from getting too soupy (a problem I’ve had before when making jambalaya): I used crushed tomatoes, rather than diced, and (boneless and skinless) chicken thighs that I tossed in whole at the start, then shredded when I added the shrimp. Added plenty of Slap Your Mama Cajun spice mix - and BAM! The best jambalaya I have ever made! Thanks!

I used boneless skinless chicken thighs. My sister who is a great cook has started to substitute them for chicken breast in many recipes. I made the switch and I am glad I did.

Made exactly this recipe. Definitely edible, but very very salty. I didn't add any additional salt. Not sure how to fix this other than maybe omitting the sausage or adding it at the very end.

Fabulous!  Had all the spices but the Cajun spice. No worries!  Found recipe on Net for Cajun spice, made it, then added 2 tsp as required by recipe, along with the other spices indicated in recipe.  It is really good!

This is a simple and terrific recipe.  It came out great.  I'm sure it will easily adapt to adding other seafood in it, like craw fish, perhaps a fish that's firm.  

Thank you, Colleen for a great meal.

Will definitely make this again! I made a few changes because I’m a bit of a picky eater  so left out the shrimp and swapped out the andouille sausage for smoked. Didn’t have regular diced tomatoes so I used Rotel mild diced tomatoes. Served over long grain wild rice. So good!

Fantastic! I did not find it too soupy, although it seemed like it at first, once you ladle it over rice the rice soaks it right up. My changes due to preference and availability: didn't have celery on hand, tossed in some diced potatoes instead; used fresh tomatoes and their juices since I have a drawer full of them (it's the end of tom season); scored and added a whole habanero 'cause this girl likes it spicy!

This was awesome..I put a tablespoon of garlic in though and drained some of the juice out of the tomatoes. Next time I will cut back on the broth. I found it still a little soupy. Definitely a winner. Thank you!

I followed the recipe  exactly. I really wanted it to be good, but it wasn't, it really really wasn't. For one, there's quite a bit of prep time, especially for a slow cooker recipe. Second, this is not a cheap recipe either--the chicken, the sausage, the shrimp, it really adds up. Which is particularly frustrating when, Third, it's basically tasteless. I was generous with the spice measurements too. Usually, when I cook in the slow cooker, I can smell dinner from the hallway outside my apartment, and this? Nothin. Add in issue four, the leftovers don't reheat well. TLDR; Too expensive ingredients, too much prep time, not enough flavor, and needs to be consumed in one sitting. Just not cutting it for me.

We all loved it. Most of us like spicy and it was just the right amount of spice! I also substituted Creole spice and it was perfect. I also used chicken thighs so it was a little more moist than breast. 
Over all a great recipe! And it’s low carb!

Another slow cooker recipe for the Instant Pot. 

Used partially frozen chicken (no shrimp - food allergies),  pressed the Poultry button, sat down with a glass of chard, and about 30 minutes later, the jambalaya and rice were done! It was a little loose, so if you prefer a thicker jamba, reduce the liquids. I stirred in the rice and thought it was about right.

Delicious, quick and easy. Thanks for the recipe.

I've been trying to makeJambalaya for years now, ever since I lived in New Orleans. This is now my go to recipe! I did follow some of the other commenters instructions and drained most of the juice from the diced tomatoes, added garlic and bay leafs. I did do the spices as instructed instead of just using creole spice. I also added a few cups of cooked rice during the last half hour with the shrimp.

Soooo delicious!! I cooked it on low for 8 hours. The only small change is that I used 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper because I don't like things overly hot. The temp was perfect for me and my husband. I served it over rice.

It was too thin and watery.  I added rice to mixture to try to thicken, but it was still too  thin.  It also tasted too much like tomatoes.  Not what I expected from a gumbo.

This was divine! I did the prep work the night before (fast) and my husband put in the slow cooker the next day and plugged it in. He is telling everyone about his jambalaya. No changes made. Definitely serve with white rice. This is a winner.

EXCELLENT !  This was easy and delicious. Fed me for a week. I'm on the low carb diet so I put this over riced-cauliflower instead of rise and it was wonderful.  I'll make this many times in the future.

I've never left a review before but this was too wonderful! Made it for a client's office potluck so left out the shrimp.  I followed others suggestions and used 3 tsp of Weber's Cajun seasoning and omitted the other spices.  I used 1 can of  original Rotel & 1 can of mild Rotel.  Perfect amount of kick.  Will definitely be making this more often!

This is  an outstanding recipe.  I pay about $12.00 for a bowl at a lovely seafood restaurant and this is better than theirs.  I used AmyLu's chicken Andouille sausage because I am obsessed with it.  The only tomatoes I had were diced fire-roasted with green chilies (Rotel) so I adjusted the cayenne.  Created my own Cajun seasoning since I had none (search Allrecipes for the recipe) and it is wonderful.  I doubled the recipe and am now trying to determine if I can freeze it.  Mine is a lovely  thick soupy result, with brown rice put in the last 30 minutes along with the shrimp.  I will make this many times over.  A definite favorite!  I loved making it in the slow cooker but  you can make on stovetop if you are home and can keep an eye on it.  Thank you for this recipe!

This is definitely a decent, easy to put together jambalaya. I really get annoyed with crock pot meals that you have to cook and sauté everything up before you put it all into the crock pot. Hubby said it was good but he likes some other recipes I’ve made of this better. I did use boneless skinless chicken thighs rather than breasts as we don’t like the blandness of breasts. We also don’t eat pork so I bought turkey hot Italian sausage. I know Italian is not andouille but if I can’t  find turkey andouille...I did not cut any of the meat up and I’m glad of that. I cooked it all for just 7 hours and by then the meat had all pretty much disintegrated into shreds. Which really wasn’t a bad thing, but if you like the meat to be in chunks it won’t be. Everything else was as exactly as the recipe called for. Served it over brown rice. It has a lot of flavor and I will make it again.

This was easy to make. Finding the sausage can be difficult, I left out the cayenne pepper and this was spicy enough for me.

Had a big 2lb. bag of shrimp and I was searching for a Cajun/Creole dish that I couldn't remember the name of and "jambalaya" came up.  Actually my son reminded me that "gumbo" was what I was looking for.  Oh well.  Anyway, I doubled this recipe following the directions exactly as far as the spices/cooking were concerned.  Didn't have andouile or celery and wasn't about to go to store.  I did have in inventory Italian sausage, asparagus, hard salami and celery seeds.   Worthy substitutes as it turned out. 

Came out awesome.  Read a couple of the other reviews and added a little instant brown rice to suck up the excess liquid in the crockpot, used Tony Chachere's spice and that worked out fine.  Boiled the shrimp "bones" and used that broth for the rice which I used Goya Arroz Amarillo yellow rice mix. 

I used RAW shrimp and "put shrimp in the last 30 minutes" is still too long.  Shrimp cooks fast and 15-20 mins at the end is plenty.

Next time I guess I'll use the andouile sausage and celery, omit the cayenne and use ground Ghost Pepper (I grow them) probably a quarter to a half teaspoon for the whole pot (if I use more nobody else will eat it.)

Bottom line?  This recipe is easy and really good.  A winner!

I thought it was delicious. My husband said it was Okay. I didn’t have time to do a crockpot that forming so I did it quickly on stove top. due to not using crock pot I omitted the chicken broth.

Followed the recipe with only one change. I added 1 1/2 lbs, of fresh cooked shrimp, as my family loves shrimp. This is a definite keeper.

So, so good! Put in a little extra Cajun seasoning and just a sprinkle of red pepper since I can’t handle the heat. Sausage was more spicy then the broth so it was perfect for me. Made this for guests and everyone loved it. Will be adding this to the rotation for sure.

Followed the recipe, added garlic and extra creole spice, and it was divine! We love spicy food, and having lived in Louisiana and had authentic Cajun food, I was really impressed with this recipe. And so easy!

I like it a lot. 
I added salt (it really needs it), and made a little thickening out of flour and water because it turned out very saucy for me. I served it over brown rice that I cooked in water with a few chicken bouillon cubes added for flavor.

Excellent recipe however I used bone broth instead of chicken broth to enhance flavoring and turkey sausage  to cut back on some fat. I will definitely make again. All leftovers we're finished happily!

This was very good.  The second time I made it, I added the chicken about an hour prior to serving.  I also added 4 servings of cooked rice at the end.

We don't carry the fancy sausage here on the west coast, so I used the Grimm's Classic Sausage.  It was a fabulous recipe, and my husband said, I've outdone myself again.  Thank you.

Cooked on low for 8 hours and the chicken and sausage came out so dry.  I didn't think anything could be dry after 8 hours cooked in juice but I guess I was wrong.  I think I will give this recipe one more chance but will make on high for less time.  Flavor and spice were nice.

I've made this about 5 times and have gotten raves eveytime.  I add about 1-1/2 cups of rice to the crockpot in the beginning along with all the rest of the ingredients and it's  perfect.  I do add 1-1/2 pounds of chicken and the same for the sausage and it's wonderful.

I made it precisely by the recipe, served it over brown rice and we thought it was so good, I'm recommending this recipe to several friends. It was runny, as some others mentioned, although in the beginning I wondered if there would be enough liquid but the tomatoes liquefied.  If I'd cooked the rice in the crock pot, I think it would have reduced the liquid considerably but I think some good crusty bread would be a real bonus when eating this to enjoy all the juices in the bottom of the bowl.

The flavor was delicious!  Our family likes it spicy but a whole tsp of cayenne might be too much for some. I will use chicken thigh meat next time because breast meat is notorious for drying out even in a slow cooker.  I added 2 cups of brown rice (minute rice) during the last half hour and it absorbed the excess liquid.  I had read previous reviews warning that it turned out soupy but the rice made it perfect!

Will definitely make this again! Was a big hit with the hubby. I did a couple of things differently-  added an extra cup of chicken broth and towards the end a cup of rice. It was not too "soupy" but next time I will add the rice even later, as I overcooked it a bit. Great flavor; spicy but not too.

Fantastic recipe! I made a few minor changes only because I was using what I had at home. (Extra celery, added diced ham,  and used blackening Cajun seasoning) I think this recipe can be very forgiving.   Delicious!!

A little runny and not enough spice for me so I’ll double the Cajun spices next time and drain the tomatoes. I used dirty rice which was great and added Frank’s original hot sauce for a little more kick. Also added garlic salt. Loved all the protein in the recipe, especially the andouille sausage.

My family loved it!  Used 1/2 tsp. Cayenne instead of a full tsp.  It was the perfect amount of heat for us.

Added chopped carrots, because I didn't have a pepper and a teaspoon of garlic powder. This was delicious. My family devoured it.

Followed the directions to the letter with one exception. My shrimp were raw/frozen so I thawed them and quickly sauteed before adding to slow cooker as recipe states. 

This was very good.

I made this last night for a dinner party. I’ve never made Jambalaya before.  We all agreed it tasted like our trip to New Orleans it was perfect. 
My alteration was I did add extra tin of tomato  then added the rice with the prawns  with a good stir 40mins from the end Making it a complete dish

Better when made with long cook rice. Only use 1/2 the cayenne suggested.

This is a good recipe but the author should have added rice into the cooking process. But since they didn't I will instead. About 15 minutes before adding in the shrimp put in 2 cups of white rice.

I've never had jambalaya but my husband has so I used his suggested rating. He suggested that it was too water and needed to be creamier. I liked it ok. I like the spice but am not a shrimp fan lol. I picked them out and gave them to my husband. Any suggestions to make it creamier?

It is a winner.  I used the steam bag of riced cauliflower with no appreciable difference in taste.  I will probably cut the cayenne pepper in half next time because Hubby is sensitive to spices.  Thank you for this recipe.

Husband said this recipe was restaurant worthy. Used fresh shrimp (not frozen). Used a bit of thigh meat in addition to the chicken breast to make it richer. Made it exactly as stated in recipe. Ladled over white rice. Hot sauce offered at the table

I've been making this recipe for years, and it is delicious. I'm not Cajun, so I can't speak to it's authenticity, but my family and I think it tastes great. This year, I used chicken thigh meat instead of breast,  and it was even better. I go easy on the cayenne for those who can't tolerate the heat, and let people add some Tabasco to their individual bowls if they want spicy.

Good recipe, but just stir in the shrimp at the last second if cooked, or last 3 minutes if raw. Other wise the shrimp will be over cooked and tough.

I don't know what you'd call this, but it is NOT Jambalaya!   Jambalaya is Not meat & vegetables  served Over Rice;  Jambalaya IS  Rice with tomatoes, meats, spices, etc. cooked IN IT!  Here in the south we laugh our butts off at people who call this Jambalaya!  At Best; this is Only a Sauce!!!

We have made this MANY times since I found the recipe - I think 4 years ago.  It is our go-to creole recipe.
The ONLY changes that we make is 1) we use kielbasa as andouille is sometimes difficult to find and 2) we halve all of the "hot spices" then serve hot sauce with it for those who want more heat.  We ALWAYS serve it over rice and usually with cornbread as a side.
GREAT recipe!

I made this for a Mardi Gras pot luck at work last week and it was a hit!  People were going back for second's and there wasn't any left at the end of the day.  I made the dish as is, but I added a bit more chicken stock and a bit more pepper because the chicken I added was more than a pound.  It is a little bit soupy, but perfect for ladling over rice and having that rice absorb all of that great flavor. I hate mushy rice, so I found this perfect to cook it on the side. I also used salad shrimp which are much smaller, but they go a bit further.  I'm actually making a pot for myself today since we ran out at work and it was that good.  Four people asked me for the recipe that day, so I'd say this one is a winner!

Oh my goodness -- this was delicious.  I wish I could remember the exact words the hubs said about it, but he was darn happy.  So was the teenager.  So was I.  I followed the recipe exactly except I cut the cayenne pepper in half as I am not a big fan of heat.  Even so, both the teenager and I got up to blow our noes midway through the meal.  When making the rice, I did follow the suggestion of using broth instead of water.  Good decision.  This will definitely be in our rotation.  And, even the cat liked it!

Really nice and spicy.  This is Whole30 compliant as long as you use sausage, canned tomatoes, and chicken broth with no added sugar.  Will definitely make it agin.

Excellent!  Made nearly just as written, including the liquid with the tomatoes, for 4 hours on high, then 30 minutes.  Used Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning.   Excellent flavor, and just right!

I did add 1 3/4 cups of instant brown rice when I added the shrimp, and it was perfect consistency to serve.  I added the rest of the can of broth to the leftovers in the fridge -- it's a still bit thick reheating because of the rice, though -- I do like it a little soupy.   

Looking forward to enjoying the leftovers in these last days of Mardi Gras!  Thank you!

Absolutely love this recipe! This has become a staple in my house. The only thing I changed to the recipe is I use chicken thighs instead of the breast. The dark meat seems to hold a little better when cooked for a long period of time.

This is a really good base recipe and I've made it several times. Following the directions makes it REALLY spicy. Not my family's thing. So after the first time, I cut way down on the spices and substituted a different sausage for the andouille and it was great.

This was a really good recipe.  I used chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts because that's what I had on hand.  I didn't think it was too spicy at all.  I cooked the rice separately and added it to the slow cooker at the end.  It was very soupy at first, even after draining the tomatoes.  However about an hour after adding the rice on the warm setting, it had soaked up a lot of liquid and began to resemble more of a traditional jambalaya.  I'll definitely make this again as it was super-easy to throw it together and smelled fantastic while cooking.

My family loves this! The only things I change is I add 1 cub of uncooked rice two hours before being done and shelled and uncooked shrimp 30 minutes before serving.

Love this recipe but..... I eliminated the cayan. Too much heat last time. I substituted with Caribbean jerk seasoning. I also added 14 oz. tomato sauce and two cups of white rice as most New Orleans jambalaya has rice. She loved it as did I. Thanks for the recipe!

This dish was absolutely delicious! I followed the other reviewers advice  and omitted the juice from the can of tomatoes to avoid a soupy consistency. I also chose to pre-cook the rice before adding it to the slow cooker at the end, before serving. Everything came out perfect. I feel like this is a recipe you can play with a little to accommodate your preference. Gave a nice kick of flavor that my entire family enjoyed!

It turned out great.  Need to note that the Cajun seasoning may come with salt already in the mix, so adjust accordingly.

This is a fantastic recipe!  I did 2 things differently one is I used chorizo as the sausage and in the last 10-20 minutes I added a package of Knorrs Spanish rice into the crockpot  & it was perfect ! Would give 10 Stars.

Great recipe! It just (barely) managed to fit into a 3.5 quart slow cooker. 4 quart would be more comfortable. Good spice balance.

To. Die. For.  I used whole, frozen chicken breasts and shredded when the dish was finished. With one hour cooking time to go, I added 1 cup Minute Rice and a little more water. Then with 30 minutes left to go, I added raw, shelled shrimp and added more water/tomato sauce if I needed to.

This is as good as a real Cajun Jambalaya gets. I have made it many times. Once I sized the recipe for 50 people. I used a stock pot instead of slow cooker. All of the folks I was feeding were from New Orleans. I wound up with 3 gallons and there was less than one serving left at the end of the potluck.. It scales easily, is easy to reheat for a large potluck and is about as healthy as any one pot meal you can make. It is a great fall dish. Make it 24 hours before you plan to eat it for best results.

I followed the suggestions to eliminate the hot spices, and Cajun seasonings.  I did use the juices from 2 cans diced tomatoes, and one can of green chilies.  Used fresh, chopped celery and whole onion, but frozen mixed pepper strips. The blending of flavors, and mixture of different meats with shrimp was excellent.  Served over rice.  Soupy was fine in a bowl.  Picky husband liked it. We have lots of nice leftovers.  Would probably feed 6 or more.

This is an outstanding recipe! I love to make this in winter when the weather gets cooler, and the most time-consuming part is the prep (cutting veggies, etc.).  Great time saver as it sits in crock pot all day. Everyone I have ever served this to has loved it and asked for the recipe.

This is good stuff! You do not need the chicken broth and drain the tomatoes well! Then it won’t be too soupy. I added garlic and scallions. I would use fresh shrimp next time. Pre cooked gets dry and chewy.

It came out amazing. I substituted the celery with red kidney beans, chicken with ground turkey, and diced tomatoes with Rotels diced tomato and chiles for extra heat. Fiancé approved. Didn't need to serve over rice.

I didn't feel like chopping up chicken so I added bone in thighs- before I serve it I pull out the chicken which has fallen off the bone and shred the big pieces and toss the bones. It does end up kinda soupy, so I used the broth to cook rice- there ended up being over 4 cups of broth- which was plenty for 2 cups of rice, and it made the rice taste amazing by itself!! Mixed the rice in and that soaked up more broth. This has become a family favorite as well as a go-to for game night and pot lucks!

Not sure what I did wrong as I followed the recipe exactly but this turned out waayyyy salty, so salty that my husband literally couldn't eat it due to health reasons. The flavor under the salt seemed good but not enough to make this worth it. 
May try this again buy find a way to cut back on salty flavors.

I usually make jambalaya w/o the slow-cooker/crockpot and w/o tomatoes, and the whole family practically inhales it. Tried this, as written, because of workday time constraints. Nobody liked the texture and we all found the spice level bland. My son called it "soggy" and made himself a peanut butter sandwich for dinner - and he usually takes seconds! Sorry, but this was a waste of good ingredients.

I've made this recipe before, and it's delicious...but make no mistake, this recipe is NOT whole30 compliant. Idk why it's showing up as such. Grains are not allowed with whole30 and rice is most certainly a grain. Just a heads up....

Delicious! Made almost exactly, just left out the peppers because I don't like them. It was a bit too much liquid at the end, so I'd probably throw the rice in next time. Otherwise, great flavor and easy to make!

I always follow a recipe to the letter the first time I make something and boy am I glad I did! This was fantastic! My husband was craving some New Orleans cooking, and he said that he couldn't get better jambalaya if we were actually in New Orleans. I cooked my rice separately and stirred it in at the end, and it worked out perfectly. This will be a staple in our house from now on!

My family  loved this recipe!  I only used 3/4 tsp cayenne, because I was afraid it would be too spicy.  But after eating it,  I think the full tsp cayenne would probably have been just fine.  I used cooked shrimp with the tails on, because I couldn't find a bag with the tails off.  Delicious!  Super easy to make!

I would try again.  I did add a good bit of garlic.  I think because I am used to making jambalaya with the rice cooking and absorbing the liquid I will try that next time.  Have to figure out the proportions.

This was awesome! Like other reviewers, I did cut back on the cayenne pepper (good choice for me ). It was soupy, but lots of white rice solved that! My husband said it was better than any jambalaya he's had - and he's lived in New Orleans! Give this one a try - you won't be disappointed!

Followed the recipe exactly, and it was a hit. Really good. This has a spicy kick to it, so those who want less heat should adjust spices accordingly.

This is my go to recipe for Jambalaya & it is marvelous.  If you don’t have exact amounts, it’s a very forgiving recipe.  I sub summer sausage for andouille & Zatairans Blackened seasoning for the Cajun seasoning & omit the cayenne (it is hot and enough already).  I serve prepared white rice on the side to add when serving.  Best Jambalaya ever & it always gets compliments from everyone ????

Pretty simple recipe. I used thin cut chicken breast, which cut the cooking time down to about 4-5 hours on low. I also didn't have all the seasonings so used Italian seasoning, which has time and oregano in it. Could not find a creole seasoning, so that was omitted. The whole family loved it. I cooked rice and added it to the mixture after it was done.

Nice flavor. A good compromise for those who like it bland and those of us who like the heat. I only added more shrimp (you can never have enough shrimp).

This is a pretty good base recipe.  I found there wasn't enough of a kick though.  After it had slow cooked, I ended up adding a lot of spices to it, especially Frank's hot sauce.  That definitely helped the flavor out.  As a disclaimer, I wasn't able to find cajun seasoning anywhere around so I made my own, using a recipe on here and perhaps that is why the flavor wasn't quite where it should be.

I did like other people suggested and didn't use all the tomato juice. It was very soupy so I used a tablespoon or two of flour to thicken it. I liked the texture and it was very flavorful, but didn't blow my mind... Meh.

I've made this twice now and it is fantastic.  It is a bit soupy as others have said so the second time I just left out the chicken broth and replaced it with a few teaspoons of chicken granules.  Even after that I ended up adding a couple teaspoons of flour mixed with a little water to thicken it up but it wasn't necessary.  Great recipe and souper ;) easy.

This is absolutely delicious!  We made a few changes, but I feel sure it would be equally delicious in the original recipe form.  For anyone who's interested:

We skipped the celery, halved the cayenne pepper.  I added 1/2 tsp each of garlic powder, sweet Hungarian paprika, Liquid Smoke and a 1/4 tsp each of seasoning salt and black pepper.  I cooked the diced chicken before adding it, which resulted in super tender chicken.  Finally, we used smoked summer sausage.  The subs. cut down the spice a bit, and it was perfect over basmati rice.  Great recipe!  Thanks so much for sharing!

Okay. So I REALLY wanted to like this. I waited ALL day for it. I was excited. Omg. I don't know what happened, but it. is. GROSS!!! My husband and I both hate it. I made a whole batch and it grosses me out so much that I'm just throwing it away. It sucks. What a disappointment! I'm scratching my head as to why it has such a high rating. Oh well. Never again.

Made this yesterday as an addition to our crawfish boil.  It was wonderful and a hit with my family.  I will make it again.  Don't be afraid to add extra meats.  I added extra shrimp and it was great.  There is enough broth to support additional sausage, chicken and shrimp.  This is a keeper!

Very good recipe. The only change that I will do next time I make it, would be to add shrimp 10 minutes prior to end of cooking time.

I used 28 oz crushed tomatoes instead of diced and substituted some Old Bay for the cajun spice and loved it!! It is a little "watery" once you pour it over rice, but didn't care.  It was not enough to be considered soup  as other reviews said.  Maybe reduce the broth to half cup if you think it might be an issue.

My Dad LOVES jambalaya! I made this for him for his birthday and he was beyond impressed, he has told so many people about  his amazing dinner.  I followed a few reviews and omitted the the juice from the diced tomatoes and toned down the cayenne (my Mom is super sensitive to spice). I was in a bind and used kielbasa and it turned out great. I'll try the andouille next time, and next time will be very soon!

Like others I did drain the tomatos and it was still soupy so I did add some cornstarch to thicken it.  It takes a lot of heat for me to think something is spicy so I did not notice it being overly spicy but my mom shared it with me and she thought it was very spicy.  I served with red beans and rice and thought it was very good and overall easy to make just a lot of prep work with the chopping.

Made this tonight for supper and we really enjoyed it! Unsure how spicy it would turn out, I decided to cut the cayenne and Cajun seasoning in half and glad I did as the heat was just right.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because of the wateriness...I was thinking that would like to thicken up the leftovers with a little cornstarch and water and see if I like that consistency better. Hubs suggested a baguette to sop up the juice instead...might be good too!

Perfect!!!! I wouldn't change anything. I don't understand why  some people said it was soupy, mine wasn't at all. Maybe it depends on the brand of tomatoes?

I have made jambalaya in the slow cooker in the past. My previous recipe asked for the chicken and the sausage to be browned. I think that the texture was preferable to this recipe.  The flavor was all right. I added Serano peppers and Bayleaf. I'm going to go back to my other recipe. I was hoping this would be OK because it had fewer steps

I and hubby are alergic to seafood, so I added 1 lb. Boneless skinless chicken thighs cut up at the beginning in place of ship at the end. Then followed to the letter.  It was a big hit with the family. We like it soupy over rice. Great meal, all you need is a nice crusty bread.

My family loves this! I made as is except I used smoked sausage & lowered the amount of cayenne pepper to less than 1/2 tsp. At the end when I added shrimp I took out some liquid to use to make the rice in an instant pot then added the rice in. It was delicious!!

The end result was way too spicy hot for my taste.  I looked on line for a way to reduce  the "hotness".  I added sour cream to reduce the heat.  It is now just right--lots of flavor.  It is soupy, but I find the broth delicious now.

As some of the other viewers mentioned, this was a bit runny for my liking. Also, I used a very minimal amount of cayenne pepper as my kids do not like spicy foods. As there is cayenne pepper in the Cajun spice mix (All recipes), I only added 1/8 tsp. My kids still found this too spicy. I used smoked sausages as this is what I had on hand and it was good (The kids favorite part). The second and third day this tasted even better..... I had lots of left over, and I did add some cornstarch to thicken it up. I will make this again, but for myself and my significant other.

I precooked my rice and reheated in the microwave.  When the jambalaya was almost done, I added the rice to the slow cooker.  It tasted delicious.

This was incredibly incredibly bland - which seems odd given the three different types of meat in it. It just kind of tasted like nothing and I'm not experienced enough of a cook yet to even begin to figure out how to make it any better. Really sucks.

This was absolutely delicious!! The only changes I made were to not include parsley (because we didn't have any), and I added two cloves of pressed garlic. The spice level was great - could have even been a bit spicier (we like spice in our household). We served it over white rice and wolfed it down. We have leftovers for dinner tonight (night #2) and can't wait! Thank you for the wonderful and easy to make recipe!

Added some minced garlic and used rotel instead of plain tomatos. It was amazing and the kids LOVED it!

Fantastic! I was a bit more generous with the cayenne but pretty much followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of substituting pork andouille for chicken andouille because I was cooking for someone who doesn't eat pork... but top notch recipe! ( I added about 1.5 tsps seasoned salt )

Was great. You can adjust the spice to your personal preferences. Will be a winter staple in our home.

This was a really good recipe.  I reduced the cook time to 5 hours and followed some of the other reviews and added my shrimp in about 40mins prior to total cook time.  It was very flavorful from all the herbs and Cajun seasoning.  I didn't use the cayenne pepper and the heat was just right, just a tad bit spicy but not overwhelming.  This will stay in rotation in my house because my family loved it!

I made this for my families Christmas meal and those that enjoy some heat really enjoyed it. It's a great, easy meal.
Only changes I made were to add cooked jasmine rice just before I added the shrimp (two pounds)
I don't understand those that have stated that it is soupy, mine was excellent and received raves! I will make it again, thanks for the recipe!

I've made this several times and each time it gets better and better. If made as written, it's a little too bland for our family so I always increase the spices during  the last two hours of cooking. By then, the Jambalaya has had time to form its true flavor so that you can adjust the spices more accurately. Also, when added on top of rice the flavor gets too dispersed. To maintain the rich flavor, I always add the cooked rice into the pot during the final 30 minutes to soak in the spices. Lastly, I'm too cheap to buy shrimp unless it's on sale, so I just add a little more chicken to compensate. Tastes great! Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

Delicious and easy recipe.  I made the rice separately and we spooned the jambalaya over it.   I added the frozen, raw shrimp during the last 30 minutes or so.  I also poured some of the juice out before company arrived and put it in the fridge for leftovers.  I am not a super-hot-food fan and this was not too hot.  The sour cream on the side was great.  Thanks for a terrific holiday meal.

After chopping the vegetables , I seasoned the chicken with cajun seasonings, basil, oregano, and red pepper.  When I added the other ingredientes to the slow cooker I seasoned them as well.  I did add a bouillon cube.  I cooked the jambalaya rice separately and I added the rice to the mixture.  It was delicious.  This recipe is a keeper.

I really like this recipe and had made it once before.  I followed the recipe exactly the first time and it was a bit spicy for my boyfriend and our daughter, so when I made it the second time, I cut the spicy spices down in half and it was great for my daughter.  She was able to enjoy it.  I also added in the rice 2 hours and 40 minutes before we were ready to eat, because I was cooking on slow (I believe it's 2 hours prior to serving if you are cooking on high).  I accidentally over-riced it by putting two cups of rice in, because I was estimating how much liquid was in it, so it was not soupy at all.  I liked it anyway, but I would recommend only putting in one cup of rice.  I also left out the shrimp, because I'm the only one who likes the shrimp.  It was excellent.

Great recipe to make for a pot luck or a sick friend since most people don't cook Cajun recipes on a regular basis (at least not in Florida). I cut the cayenne in 1/2...still has a nice "bite" at the end. Used large cooked shrimp the 2nd time I made it because the small ones aren't as flavorful---put them in 1 hour before finishing for more flavor. Used McCormick's organic spices and was very happy with the flavor. Served over Zatarain's Jambalaya rice and with corn muffins. Great Keto diet meal if you skip the rice and bread.

First time I made Jambalaya but was looking for a recipe with certain ingredients.  I served this at a Martini party and everyone loved and wanted a copy of the recipe.  The spices were perfect and not too spicy but definitely had a nice kick.  I will definitely be making this again.

I don't know why I didn't believe the reviews when they said it would come out soupy, but it did. Not a huge loss for me because when you mix it with rice, it comes out pretty awesome. 

Too scared to cook rice in it since the recipe didn't mention rice at all and in reviews that said they did, it came out mushy/under cooked (unless it's instant rice?).

A lot of people mentioning that it's too spicy, but personally I added an extra jalapeno and it still wasn't very spicy at all. I think next time I'll play with the seasoning a bit more.

Very yummy!  All 3 of my teenage sons ate it...a bit spicy for me, but I am a lightweight lol. I made it as written except I used beef broth since I didn't have any chicken broth. I also added my cooked rice to the crockpot when I added the shrimp.  I didn't drain the tomatoes as others suggest. It would be more of a stew had I not added the rice directly to the mix...either way it was very tasty. It will go into my 'keep' folder.

I altered the recipe by adding 1 cup of uncooked rice, 1 additional cup of chicken broth and omitting the cayenne pepper.  The rice came out mushy, which I consider the perfect texture for jambalaya.  The dish came out with little excess liquid rather than being soupy.  I omitted the cayenne to cut down on the heat.  It was fantastic and I'm going to make it a staple dish.  Total cost was $26.

turned out great.  only thing I did different was I didn't add the cayenne pepper.   family loved it.  the shrimp was a bit overwhelmed by the other flavors, especially the spicy sausage, so next time I think I will cook the shrimp separately with garlic butter and add at the end.

We really liked this one, I read some of the reviews before making it and in the last little bit (couple of hours) I used a ladle and drained as much of the liquid from the dish as I could and used that to make rice with then added that rice to the rest and stirred it in.  Made it very hearty.

This is delicious but I gave it 4 stars for 2 reasons: (1) it is SPICY and (2) it is too liquidy. I only used 3/4 the cayenne called for & it is still extremely hot. I was afraid to omit the broth because I left it inattended but think that'd be fine. Even adding a few cups of rice didn't help these two issues much. It's a great recipe but needs tweaking! I cooked it on low so I'm not sure if it makes a difference liquid wise to cook it faster.

I was very disappointed with this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I added raw shrimp about 45 minutes before serving.  I served this over brown rice.  At first I thought I wasn't wild about it because of the brown rice, which we usually prefer.  Tasting the jambalaya itself, without rice proved this wasn't the case.  Everything was overcooked and lacked flavor.  The delicious andouille sausage tasted like nothing, as did the shrimp.  I will definitely stick with my stove-top version, and won't be making this crock-pot version again.

I wanted to follow the recipe faithfully, but had to make do with ingredients I had on hand. I did not have onion, celery, green peppers, or andouille sausage. Instead, I used one can of Rotel's diced tomatoes with green chiles (original), one can of tomato sauce, one whole scallion (chopped), three cloves of garlic (thinly sliced), and four Bourbon black peppercorn and bacon sausages. I browned the sausage, removed from pan. Then dredged the cubed chicken in flour, salt, and pepper. I then browned the chicken in the little bit of sausage drippings with the scallions and the garlic. I then put everything in the slow cooker as instructed, except I skipped the extra cayenne since I was afraid it'll be too spicy for my 4- and 8-year-olds. Instead, I used a combination of smoked and regular paprika (2 teaspoons altogether). I also had no thyme, so used a bay leaf. After nearly 7.5 hours on low, I skimmed the fat off the surface of the jambalaya and put in raw shrimp (frozen) with 37 min left on the clock. The jambalaya was incredibly delicious and full of amazing flavor. Husband loved it. It was still too spicy for the children, but that's the nature of jambalaya. I will make this again - it was wonderful in spite of all the changes I had to make.

Followed the recipe exactly!! My husband says I can make this EVERY night if I want to. He could NOT stop eating it. Thank you for a great recipe. And, I would suggest trying this recipe just as it is before making any changes and then saying  you tried it. You won't be sorry. I would give it 6 stars if I could.

Allrecipes chefs, trust me.  I am a recipe-tweeker.  But I made this recipe exactly like it recommended and I loved it.  I would never make any changes.  I have shared this recipe with a friend and cooked it for some friends and it gets rave reviews.  This recipe for jamabalaya is the bomb.  It's better than I and my friends have tasted in restaurants.  You are missing out if you don't try it.

Delicious and well deserving of 5 stars. I found some sausage already with the Cajun spices, but followed the amount on the recipe as stated. Will definitely make again, but will cut back a bit on the cayenne pepper, to a 1/2 tsp. You can always add some hot sauce. Thank You for sharing.

The liquid was a little too much so I took some out and added it to the rice. The rice tastes good! I took out what I needed only and still kept the flavors.

My family and friends loved this  jambalaya I've  made it a few times. I usually serve it over brown rice along with turnip greens. I add ham cubes as well. This one is a keeper will continue to make. Absolutely love.

I really really liked this.  I used paprika instead of cayenne.   I sauteed defrosted raw shrimp in butter and threw that in at the end.  I believe this makes a huge difference. I wouldn't use frozen cooked shrimp.  I never liked it.  I also used defrosted frozen chicken tenders which I also believe makes a difference.  Not too soupy that's the beauty of it.  Use a slotted spoon if you don't like the juice but the juice flavors the rice (use white basmati).   Adding additional fresh halved cherry tomatoes next time.  Thanks Colleen

Nice flavor a bit like soup but good.  I improvised with what I had I used a tomato sauce and did not have cajun spices so substituted chipotle sauce.  For throwing a few ingredients  in a slow cooker it came out real good.

This is ok. But this is like going to taco bell to eat authentic Mexican food. This is a nasty soup and has been dulled down to fit a bland taste. Not Authentic not cajun. No cajun cook adds "cajun spice" bought in a container. Cajun spice is 5 at hand spices that all real chefs and food addicts have in their kitchen. Not a premade bought from Walmart made in china.

I have made this multiple times.  I cut back on the tomato juices, so it is less runny.  I kick up the seasonings as we like it spicy.  but if I am making for others, I stick to the recipe.  I cut up the meat the nite before, put the liner of the slowcooker in the fridge.  I mix all the spices, and have them in a container on the counter.  so in the morning just need to mix everything.  the house smells wonderful when I get home from work.

A few tweaks: Used approx 2 cups chicken broth. Added jalapeño and 2 bay leaves and doubled the celery. When it was time to make the rice I used liquid from the crockpot instead of water. It was perfect! Def make again!

I made this, and thought it was a bit more soupy than I'd like.  Taste is good, but, I'd recommend some tweaks to seasoning.

1. Make your own cajun seasoning.  Half the ingredients were already called out individually, so it seemed redundant if you don't buy pre-made (I couldn't even find it in my store).
2. I used frozen, pre-shelled shrimp.  I put it in about 1 hour before the 4 hour mark while cooking on high.
3. I definitely recommend not cooking the rice with the stew.  This is a traditional way to cook jambalaya, but the slow cooker will make it mushy.

This is really good. The only changes I made were to add a tsp. of file powder and a bayleaf.  I put the chicken breast in the last hour of cooking so it wouldn't dry out.  I don't know why everyone is concerned about it being soupy. It's perfect consistency to serve over rice. Definitely be making again.

So easy to make and delicious every time. Because I use more chicken broth than the recipe calls for, I use a bit of corn starch to thicken it.

This is a great jambalaya recipe.  My husband and I both loved it.  The recipe as written is very spicy though.  If you love spicy it's great but if not, I'd definitely reduce the amount of cayenne pepper added.  The Andouille sausage & creole seasoning (I used Tony Chachere's and even though I used the non-spicy version, it still has a kick) already have some spiciness on their own without adding additional cayenne pepper.  I used only a 1/4 of a teaspoon cayenne pepper instead of 1 whole teaspoon like the recipes calls for and it was plenty spicy for us.  Otherwise, good, rich flavor & the consistency was great.  I served over brown rice.

Fantastic, nice little spice, I didn't mind it being runny at all.  If you don't like spicy, you won't like this, I didn't think it was too spicy, but I like it, and if you lead them out (no cayenne pepper and half cajun seasoning)  (which I did for my wife and added them into my bowl) its very bland.  I used turkey sausage which makes it a little more healthier too

Great flavor, I added 4 cups cooked rice at end of cooking with shrimp and was not too runny at all.  Flavor blended nicely and seasoning was great!  One day of my future go to dishes.

I have made this sooo many times and love it!!  I drain the tomatoes to make less soupy.  I omit all of the  spices and use two tablespoons of  the Creole Seasoning Blend recipe on this site.  Just spicy enough.  I also add more garlic.  One of my favorite go to easy crock pot recipes.....thank you Colleen for the most excellent recipe!!  As others suggested I make the rice on the side.......

Made it for the first time tonight.  I don't typically stick to set limits for spices and go by taste.  It came out perfectly!  I added a little more sausage to mine, omitted the shrimp due to allergies, and cooked the rice then mixed it in with the jambalaya as I like mine thicker instead of like a soup.  I also added a bit of corn starch to the jambalaya to thicken up the sauce and give it a more hearty consistency.  Overall, it was just the right amount of heat, and just the right taste!  As a veteran of The Big Easy and its amazing food, this definitely compares to the real thing!

My family loved this recipe, my job transferred me from Foley Al to Denver Co. and you don't get very much creole food here in this part of the states. So I had to try this one, it is definitely a keeper. Everyone loved it!!

I made the recipe as is and it was very good.   It is a bit soupy, but I preferred that as I did not add any rice, but poured it over previously cooked rice.  That worked out perfect.  I do not like spice, so the amount of seasoning was good for me, plus the sausage added spice as well (I used Cajun style andouille sausage).  I will definitely make this again.

I've made it several times and it is fantastic!
I'll often add another half white onion, a second green pepper and another cup of chicken broth so it turns out more like a soup.

Yes, technically it is more like a gumbo, but I've tried many jambalaya recipes and this one is my favourite by far. Well worth it to make your own creole seasoning. Add rice about 30 minutes from finish or just serve over cooked rice.

I have  been using this recipe for may years now  with a few changes. My spouse is a business traveler and has spent the past twenty years on the road eating at some of the finest restaurants in America. Colleen's Jambalaya is the best recipe to date that continously has not neen beaten by any other  Jambalaya  that he has tried at restaurants on the road.  Awesome! Thanks!

This was FANTASTIC! We like spicy so used rotel instead of plain diced tomatoes.  Aside from having to add some salt, didn't change any other spices. The flavor was the BOMB!

I made this recipe twice and it has become a "fan favorite" with my co-workers. I changed the recipe slightly to spice it up by cutting the diced tomatoes to one 14.5 oz can and adding a can of Rotel Hot chilies. This adds more depth to the flavor and some real heat (don't use the "hot" chilies if you don't like your food really spicy). And to "kick the recipe over the goal post" of the flavor field, I cooked raw shrimp in spicy crawfish boil before adding to the jambalaya. 

This is an unbelievably easy recipe that has tons of flavor. This recipe trumps any jambalaya I've eat at most Louisiana or Cajun restaurants in Houston, TX.

This was amazing! So much flavor, and so easy to make. I followed the recipe  exactly and since it was pretty watery, it was perfect over rice. Will definitely be making this again!!

I made it exactly as written except I used smoked sausage instead of andouille.  I served it over steamed white rice as suggested.  It is EXCELLENT!  Very flavorful.  I will definitely make it again.

I've been using Colleen's recipe for years and I love it! The only changes I make is that I save the sausage until the last 1-1/2 hour of cooking because I don't like the texture of stewed sausage. I also add instant rice when I add the shrimp. Everyone I have ever served it to has raved about how good it is!

I loved this recipe! Exactly what I was looking for. I did drain the tomatoes like others had suggested, and cut the spices down a bit, but other than that, followed the recipe as written. I also added a couple large spoonfuls of marinara sauce at the end to help thicken a little. I served over rice. Would definitely make again. Thanks for sharing.

Didn't have the thyme, but otherwise followed pretty close.  Added my Dirty Rice mix (boxed) with 30 minutes to go.  Will add shrimp tomorrow after I reheat for Mother's Day (I figure about 20 minutes to heat the already cooked shrimp).  

So far, this is a fantastic recipe based on my preliminary tasting.  I did use chicken thighs and de-skinned and cut into pieces.  I've made Jambalaya before, but this is the best to date.  And no, you don't need garlic.  A little soupy, but with the rice addition, it is perfection.  Enjoy!

This recipe is so easy and so delicious it's the only jambalaya recipe I use. I do add tomato paste to thicken it up a bit, but it doesn't take  away any of the flavor.

I had to change the seasoning because i didn't have some of the spices it recommended, We used creole and cajun spices and cooked it on the stove.  Served over  rice.  We will be making this again.

The flavor was great, but I did not like how there wasn't clear instruction on if it was raw or cooked sausage and chicken.  I put both in raw and the sausage was mushy.  I think it would have been better if it was cooked before hand or if I had just used smoked sausage instead.

Awesome, my kids wouldn't touch it so next time I will go heavier on the spice. It is slightly labor intensive and not cheap to make so this will be kept for gatherings we host.

Made it a few times with some variations.  I don't usually have andouille on hand, so tend to use a number of different smoked sausages, some spicy and some not.  I usually add some fresh garlic too, and I am pretty flexible on my vegetable quantities.  I like using shrimp that still have their shells, it adds a little bit of extra taste.  Also, I don't pay too much attention to the liquid amounts --- I have found that I can easily remove the extra liquid and use it to make the rice at the end, which gives very yummy rice to mix into the jambalaya as desired.  Overall, this recipe, whether you want to call it a true jambalaya or not, is a very tasty dish.

sautéed all the dry ingredients in butter and creole/old bay seasoning before transferring to slow cooker. sub ham for sausage (hubs preference).
 used can of crushed tomatoes instead (what I had in pantry) and one 14.5 can of chicken broth.  few tablespoons of sugar to tone the acidity, 2 cups of rice; then shrimp and parsley at the end.  it was good creole rice.

Wow!  I consider myself an above average cook but I've never had such raves from my husband as I got while he was eating this dish!  He is still raving about it days later.  I followed the recipe but cut it down for just the two of us and I used Rotel hot with habaneros.  Cooked it in the crockpot for about 8 hours and served it over white rice.  It was awesome!

I make this often, but I add thawed raw shrimp. Shrimp cook very fast. It's not necessary to add ones that are already cooked. I did this the first time I made it and they were so overdone.

hands down the most simple flavorful jambalaya dish you can make, so simple it's stupid! I make this every couple of months and my family simply love it! I really like how the ingredient list is simple and the flavor is just out of this world. Follow the recipe to the t and you'll be glad you did. Colleen you are a godsend for this one.

This was really excellent! I loved the flavor. I only used half the cayenne and it was spicy but not burning my mouth. We also used tomato sauce instead of diced tomatoes. Loved it and will definitely make again!

VERY good. I made a couple modifications - I added an extra 14 oz can of diced tomatoes and then at end of recipe when I added the shrimp, I also added a medium size bag of frozen cut okra (not breaded).  Adding the okra at the end allowed it to retain its crunch and flavor. The okra didn't overcook or get slimed in texture.

Fantastic! 
I tried Jambalaya when I was a kid and it blew my mind. I loved the chewy shrimp and flavorful sausage. I just got a crock pot and have been wanting to put it to good use. This recipe was a fantastic base to springboard off of and has the perfect balance of seasoning. It's hard to find anything worth changing, so all I did was add an array of hot sauces to try. 

Thank you so much for sharing this with the world, and giving a solid A++ Jambalaya to the internet. 

Side notes: The whole thing cost relatively close to $10 bucks, fed 5 people and took no more than 20 minutes as stated. 
You could make this on the way out the door for work and then by the time you got home it would be ready. 

Crock potting is magical. Thanks again!

I  followed the recipe exactly except I bought more Andouille than I needed which made it meat heavy in flavor. Corrected the problem by adding an extra can of diced tomatoes with onions/peppers which worked great. A bit soupy but kind of prefer it that way. Overall great recipe!!

Made this as written except I omitted the shrimp (hubby doesn't like them) and I reduced the spices slightly so my 4yo will eat it. It tastes pretty good,but it is very watery. I added some instant rice after I had turned the heat off and let that cook which absorbed some of the liquid, and then served with a crusty bread to mop up the rest. If you don't plan on adding rice or serving with bread, i suggest you seriously reduce the liquid added to this. Other than that it's a pretty good dish.

I followed someone's suggestion to instead use the Creole Seasoning Blend (which was amazing). The only thing I would do differently is I would use 3T instead of 4T. The 4T of the seasoning is too spicy for my husband and I. We also added rice separately at the end.

I've been to NOLA and this recipe is awesome! I added rice at the end of the recipe and also a little flour to thicken it, so next time I will start a roux and I can't believe it can be any better.

This was excellent. I left out the cayenne but it still was spicy, which is OK! I think the sausage or Cajun I used was spicy. Anyways, I came home after work and didn't want to wait 3 hours for the slow cooker so I put everything in a pot a simmered it for 1.5 hours. Came out great! Will definitely make again.

This is an excellent recipe. Set and forget and it turns out an  extremely flavorful and delicious jambalaya . The only thing I changed  was to add 3-4 large diced jalapenos.

I have made this numerous times. It is one of my husbands favorites. The only changes I made were 1 tsp instead of 2 tsp creole seasoning and a little bit more then 1/2 tsp cayenne. I also puree tomatoes instead of using canned.

This is one of our all-time favorites.  We  double the chicken using only  thighs.  We put the chicken on the bottom, add everything else except the sausage and shrimp and top with the tomatoes.  No stirring or mixing.  Just put in the slow cooker and walk away. Add the sausage the last hour.  Add the shrimp the last 1/2 hour if using. We love it with or without shrimp.  Just delish!

This was so good! I loved the flavors. It was a bit soupy, which didn't bother me too much. Next time, I will add the rice to the crock pot in the last 20 mins. Also, the dish does have quite a kick to it! I may only put 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper in next time. However, this was very good! Definitely going to be one of my top 5 meals.

I followed the directions exactly.  It was good and I will make again however I will cut back on the liquid by draining the tomatoes and maybe 25% less broth.  It was a little too soupy for me. I'm sure some prefer it that way however I like it a little thicker. Otherwise it was very easy to prepare and had good flavor.

I really liked it. Once I was visiting friends in Louisiana and the neighbor made a Jambalaya in a black pot over a fire. He killed his own chickens and used caught that day shrimp with homemade sausage. I remember it being soupy and the rice was served on the side. I don't think anything on here will be that authentic. So my one experience with "real" jambalaya was pretty close to this in soupiness and rice on the side. So I do not agree with the statement that "it should have rice in it". I made it just the way the recipie called for. I will make it again.

I like having the rice included in the pot, so I added one box of Zatarain's New Orleans Style Jambalaya Mix to this recipe. The recipe called for a cup of broth, which is about 1/2 a can - the rice called for 2.5 cups of liquid - so I added the other 1/2 can of chicken broth and a 1/2 cup water. Came out perfectly. 

I also 1/2 the cayenne pepper to decrease the heat a bit. I only put it on high for 4 hours.  I tried to upload a picture but was unsuccessful :(

Had to use Kielbasa sausage because I couldn't find Andouille. Hubby LOVED it!!! (He likes it a bit soupy and then added the rice later) He said I didn't need to look any further for a Jambalaya recipe. :)

I love this recipe! I changed it up a bit using red peppers instead of green, hot sausage links instead of andouille  sausage and boneless thigh meat. I usually always double it because the whole family loves it.

A favorite crock pot dish. I prefer the rice not cooked in the jambalaya, I think the flavors show better.  I always make extra and probably don't use the exact right amounts but otherwise I don't change a thing, great recipe.

Because I cannot tolerate heat-producing spices, I had to make some changes, including making my own Cajun seasoning, again leaving t the heat. Even so, about half-way through, I added  a splash of lime juice to further tame the heat of the paprika. Served over Risotto.

My fourth time making it. Here are a few suggestions. Follow recipe with the followings changes and additions based mostly on other reviewers. Cube chicken, season salt/pepper then dredge in flour and sear to brown outside. 2 medium onions or 1 large+, 3 stalks celery, full can chicken broth, 1.5 level tsp cayenne pepper, 2 tbsp minced garlic, 1 can tomato paste, use seasoned diced tomatoes (eg sweet onion garlic) and most importantly, I threw in king crab meat and shells until the slow cooker couldn't fit any more. The shells will add great seafood flavor. Throw in a bag of dried shrimp. Then I use U15 shrimp and large grade A sea scallops. Cut shrimp into bite size, add shellfish to the pot with 5 minutes left of cook time (assumes shellfish are close to room temperature). The more veggies you add the more liquid base you end up with; which IMHO is a good thing.

One of the best slow cooker recipe I've tried on Allrecipes. I usually just use the sausage and no other protein. Great flavors/seasoning and I add rice from one boil-in-the-bag pouches to cook with the other ingredients; makes for a nice consistency. 

Because all my sausage is precooked, I just cook the vegetables/broth on high for two hours then added sausage and cooked for one more hour. I forget at one point I add the rice, but if I figure it out, will update the review.

Let me start out by saying that this is the first time that I have made anything like this, and this is a dish that I am unfamiliar with.  Throwing this together was easy and smelled wonderful as it was cooking.  The end result however, was something that we couldn't eat because it was so spicy you could not taste anything else.  We served it over white rice which I would not recommend.  I like the idea of serving this over something heartier that would maybe balance it out, like red beans and rice.  My husband who is more familiar with this dish thought it was off somehow and couldn't eat it either.

I made this exactly as recipe states.  Used Chicken andouille  sauusage and Tony Chachere's  as cajun spice.  It came out as a  fairly mildly spiced  dish.   Served it with brown rice.

This was AWESOME! I'd say it's closer to 8 servings than 12, but maybe that's just because my husband and I LOVED it. Since the recipe didn't specify, I used the canned tomatoes with green chilies (we love spicy) and kept the juice as the recipe states. This did leave some remaining juice in the bottom, but soak it up with some rice or drink it straight - super good! Only thing I actually changed was adding more onion 'cuz my hubby loves it and a tiny bit of garlic. Andouille sausage turned out tender and really contributed to the flavor. I've never had good experience adding rice to a slow cooker recipe, so I cooked mine on the side and added it in once it was cooked. Definitely a keeper and will make again soon!

Had to work late, so I was frantically searching for something to throw in the crock pot, other than the usual roast or stew,to feed my hungry brood, stumbled upon this gem. I substituted smoked sausage for the andouille, it's what I had. When I got home, there was nothing left! My men obliterated it! Both my teenage sons said this was the, "Bombdiggitybomb!"  Even though I didn't taste it, anything that gets that label from my guys is a winner to me. I highly recommend not putting the shrimp in too soon, I did and they were tough, so I heard. Lol.

I followed the recipe closely - using fresh herbs and threw in a couple of bay leaves. I do not usually purchase pre-made seasonings, but followed a recommendation on here and got 'Tony Chachere's' and it was fine. This dish was delish. It was a tad soupy, but the rice soaked it up. Very spicy - a definite keeper!

I thought this turned out really well! I don't consider myself a great cook and things often don't turn out how I hoped but this did!  the only thing I did differently was use crushed tomato because I forgot to get the right kind at the store but I think it turned out better... I'm not that fond of chunky cooked tomato anyway, oh and I put in a little more chicken broth because I didn't have the juice from the chunky tomato.. and I did 3/4 tsp on cayenne. it was spicy but not too spicy especially with the rice. Very tasty simple recipe.

I make this recipe almost weekly for my family! They love it. I am a vegetarian so I don't eat it myself but it's always gone and the leftovers always get eaten which is a rarity in our house. The recipe is so simple and easy to make and you can get everything in the crockpot within 10 minutes. Love that!

The first time I tried making this dish it turned out wonderful! I had never attempted any kind of cajun recipe before, but this was a piece of cake from the grocery shopping to the clean up. And even more amazingly, my very picky eater boyfriend absolutely loved it! Win-win :) Thanks for sharing.

I made mine w/o shrimp, and added a dash more salt and red pepper. It had a nice heat, not too overpowering. My best friend who is not a fan of heat even enjoyed it, but by the end she was sweating a little. I will definitely make again, next time I'll include some okra.

We loved this! I had to use smoked sausage.  Also added a large clove of garlic.  Mixed 3 cups cooked basmati rice in and waited 10-15 minites to soak up some of the liquid.  Definitely will make again.... soon!

Didn't have any sausage so made it without. I followed everything else exactly and it was amazing. Didn't think my kids would enjoy it, but the devoured it! Served it with rice and homemade red beans. So amazingly delicious. I was hesitant to use precooked shrimp as it becomes rubbery so easily, but adding it in the last 30 minutes frozen made it just perfect. Won't change a thing next time I make it. Super healthy and low fat without any sausage so I plan on keeping it that way!

I was going to add rice as one reviewer suggested, however, my husband stopped me before I added it.  He prefers jambalaya to be less "thick".  We both loved it.  I used deer sausage with jalapeno instead of andoulle sausage as that's what I had that on hand, and it was wonderful.

Super easy to make. Complex in flavor. Well worth it in you're looking for that cajun taste. Agree with the other reviews that say it's thinner than a typically jambalaya but I'm confident that's due to the cooking process and served over rice really makes it a moot point. I did add 2 tsp of salt and cracked black pepper, not sure why the recipe didn't call for this but I worried it was going to be too bland without the standard S&P. I'd totally make it again!

I've made this a few times now.... Changed it up a little each time, of course.... It's a very versatile recipe! Like added some chopped garlic cloves; turmeric, Italian spice, & the Keg Steak spice to add more heat & flavour to it (sometimes more spice, sometimes less, depending on what else I'm cooking & who I'm cooking for)... And I've found that this particular recipe is a little watery, so I do add brown rice to it (otherwise it wouldn't be right!) I can't digest red meat, so I use turkey sausage, (I know, what a rip-off, but that was the hand I was dealt with... At least I can eat some meat!) Also, I prefer thigh meat to breast meat for the nutritional value, so that's what I usually use as well, and if I can find prawns, I will use that instead of shrimp (prawns are also better nutritionally...I used to be a commercial fisher-woman in the '90's, but they are hard to find, seasonal usually April - Sept as they have to be trapped). This is a great dish to bring to a large gathering... My family really love it when I bring it up when I visit (we each bring a dish so my 72 yrs young Mom doesn't have to cook so much & can visit with us, too, even though she loves to fuss while she visits!)

I found this recipe on this site several years ago, and we love it. It's one of my husband's frequent requests. (I'd make it more often if shrimp were cheaper!) I follow the recipe as written, except I add about 3 c. of COOKED rice when I add the shrimp, letting it cook about 30 minutes more.

This is the first time cooking jambalaya and I just had my first bite and it was delicious. I doubled everything because I meal-prep. If you follow step-by-step, you'll get a soupy jambalaya and if you ever talk to someone from Lousiana, they'll tell you that it is not supposed to. After it was cooked, I removed as much liquid as possible and I cooked two cups of white rice. I still added some water because it was taking too long. I just watched it and stirred it until it was cooked. I added the rice to the slow cooker. The liquid was delicious and I am saving the remaining.

I made it and it was great! I added a little flour and butter to thicken it and didn't have enough tomatoes on hand, so added a can of Rotel and used a couple of brauts and hillshire  keilbasa.

Love this recipe!!   I used tomatoes with jalapenos (we love spice) so I reduced the amount of cayenne pepper a little.  I also added garlic and added the cooked rice about 1/2 before it was done. I'm not a fan of pork so I used chicken Andouille sausage instead.  Everyone loved it and this is a keeper!

This was really good and easy for this busy new mom to throw in the crockpot. It was a little too spicy for me, my Cajun spice had plenty of cayenne so I would cut back on that next time but this was still delicious.
This was a little more soupy than the jumbalaya recipes I've made in the past because they were made with rice in them but this was more flavorful and I served it over rice. I don't mind soupy myself.

LOVED IT! I'm a huge fan of all things spicy ...my family, not so much, so I toned it down at the end with a bit of cream. Also, the broth stayed pretty thin, so I took some broth out and warmed it in a saucepan with 2 teaspoons of cornstarch-added it back in and it's PERFECT! I've experimented with complicated jambalaya and gumbo recipes for years-this is by far the simplest and best I've tried. Also, I doubled the shrimp-because SHRIMP!! Thanks so much for sharing!

I made this for a family gathering and there was quite literally nothing left!  One of the members of our family has a severe shellfish allergy, so I omitted the shrimp and added a little more chicken and andouille.  Additionally, I threw in a few bay leaves, about 1/2 can of crushed tomato and adjusted the seasonings to taste.  It was outstanding!  I will definitely be making this again.

This dish is delicious. Great flavor. I skipped the celery and the cayenne pepper (Cajun spice was enough). I also used red pepper instead of green. I cooked 2 cups of rice on the side and mixed it in. I also strained half of the tomato juice out of the can so it would be less soupy. The only thing I'd do different next time is add uncooked shrimp earlier. The cooked shrimp tasted rubbery. Thanks for the recipe!!

Honestly I thought this sounded too simple to be as good as some of the reviews said, but wow was I wrong. My husband and I loved it! I made it exactly as told and it turned out wonderful! I will be making this again that's for sure. Thanks!

It's so easy!!!! When you are looking for something different but still a comfort food, this is it! When I want it to be a bit more well-rounded I make veggie sides. Thank you for this recipe!

Very good! I was raised with a grandma who grew up in Louisiana and this reminded me of some of the flavors she would cook. Only a few tweaks were made, used rotisserie chicken and added jalapeños. Served on top of jasmine rice- delicious!

This doesn't have the depth of a stovetop jambalaya with a roux and holy trinity saute' but it's tasty and easy.  The sausage I had was fairly spicy and between that, the Old Bay, and the cayenne it was a little bit hot.  (I liked it and my husband didn't need to add his usual hot sauce) The next time I may omit the cayenne.

This recipe is outstanding!  I didn't alter it in any way except that I use" heaping" teaspoons of spices. Indeed there was a lot of liquid  as noted in other reviews.What I did with the excess (liquid)sauce ~ I saved it then  and I added to plain rice and served it as a tasty side dish with other entrees. I served this to a large group and they all loved it.  I have had Jambalaya a number of times in restaurants and this beats them all! Thank you Colleen!!

This is my new favorite recipe!The depth of flavor was astounding. The spice level was perfect because my husband does not like spicy foods, but it was spicy enough to satisfy me. I will definitely be making this again to impress my in-laws when they visit.

This is an awesome, affordable, simple, crowd pleasing recipe!  After reading other reviews, I made the rice separately using the extra "juice" from the crock pot instead of water.  I then incorporated the rice into the crock pot to make a traditional jambalaya.  Other than this, I followed the recipe to a T.  It was not spicy, in my opinion. We served Tabasco and French bread with butter on the side.  Every single person who ate it asked for the recipe and it was all gone. We were really bummed, because we were hoping for leftovers!

I totally disagree with the reviews that say it's too soupy because...CORNBREAD. We put it over rice and then plopped a slice of honey Cornbread on top of it. It helps soak it up and balances out the spice. I almost always change a recipe but this is one of the best I've had as it is written. I did make one minor change. Raw shrimp because the frozen cooked stuff freaks me out.

Very good and easy! I did add cooked rice at the end and that made all the difference otherwise it'd be too soupy. I omitted the celery and green pepper because I don't like them and since I have small kids at home I did cut a bit on the spices (cayenne pepper and Cajun seasoning) so it wouldn't be too hot for them. It still had a kick to it without being impossible for them to eat. My picky kids loved it! Will make it again.

Based on reviews, I made a very minor change....in summary the jambalaya was AWESOME!!!! The only thing I changed was the amount of cayenne pepper (b/c most reviewers said it was really hot). There was a kick but I think the recommended amount would be just fine also (as my way wasn't really spicy at all)....oh and many on here expressed concern about the "soupiness" but that wasn't an issue for me. I used the juice from the tomatoes (as the recipe calls for instead of draining) and it was just fine. I used a spoon with holes (to drain) when I made plates and then used a regular serving spoon to add just a little juice....I didn't want to do like some of the other reviewers and omit the juice from the recipe and then end of up with completely dry jambalaya. Again, it was AWESOME and will now be a staple in my house. Thanks for sharing the recipe Colleen.

Love the ease of preparing it in the crockpot but it made the sausage mushy, and imo the sausage is what makes the dish. Will not prepare it this way again. Thanks anyway.

Delicious recipe! I left out the shrimp since I made it for a picky eater, and we both loved it. I put all of the ingredients into a pressure cooker for 30 mins (70 kPa) along with a box of uncooked zatarains jambalaya mix rice (original). It was done in 30 mins vs several hours and tasted great!

For those complaining about it being too runny, I added a roux thickening while it was cooking. About 2-3 tablespoons by Zataran's. Also, I didn't have any Cajun seasoning, so I used 2T loose seafood boil by Zataran's as well. Added some minced garlic and mushrooms. Also, took the cooked rice and poured it into the slow cooker ingredients right before serving. My family and friends loved it.

This was super easy to put together and resulted in a pretty tasty dish!  The only thing I would make sure to do differently next time is add a little more salt.  My husband and FIL said it lacked salt, but once they salted their dish, they ate two bowls!  I could not find andouille sausage, so I resorted to smoked sausage which was a mistake.  If I can't find andouille next time, I'll use sliced turkey sausage.  Great dish though!

I am about to eat this delish dish.  I added about 4 tablespoons of organic butter to add to the taste and had to substitute sweet Italian sausages as the person at Citartella's had no knowledge osf andouille sausage.  I also added a chicken bouillon cube.  I used all organic ingredients.  This was easy to make :)

I made this, and it was very good. I followed the recipe except used shrimp and crab boil because I didn't Cajun spice. Next time, I think I will use fresh pink shrimp. One comment that I hope is helpful: I don't like much heat in foods, so I would cut the cayenne for me. My son does and he said it was perfect. I will definitely make it again.

This recipe is so simple!  I did not have any diced tomatoes, so I used tomato paste; I was really worried, but it turned out extremely well.  I also used mild Italian sausage, since I'm not a huge fan of spicy food.  I'm known for not knowing my way around the kitchen, but THIS was delicious.

This was really good! I cut the cayenne pepper in half just to make sure it wasn't too spicy and other than that it came out perfect. I feel like it should be a little runny just because thats how ive always had it. We put it over white rice, it was delicious! I do suggest salt on your individual portion. I appreciate the elimination of salt from the recipe just because everyone's taste buds are different.

Yum! I made this exactly as outlined - except it was done after 5 hours on low in my crockpot. Outstanding! Made it on a Sunday. Cooled down, popped it into a pot and put in fridge. Came home from work Monday, cooked up some rice - voila! Dinner was ready! I'll be making this - a lot! Thanks for posting!

I absolutely love jambalaya, it's one of my favorites things to eat in the winter time.  The only change that I made was using brown rice instead of white, but the taste was still the same.  I've made this dish twice now, the first time without red pepper flakes and the second with, and I definitely tasted the difference.  It was a little bit hotter with the red pepper flakes, but I paired it with some cornbread and that took away the heat.  This will definitely be a slow cooker dish I make for years to come!

I omitted the shrimp  because I'm allergic, and added extra chicken and sausage.  I also added  a bag of kidney beans (I combined a couple of recipes),  and extra creole seasoning. Left it in the crockpot for about 6 hours while I worked. I added 2 cups of white rice when I got home,  mixed it into the Jambalaya.  Came out great!

I have gotten a few recipes from here so far but this was was by far my favorite. Very easy to prepare with tons of flavor and the perfect kick given from the cajun seasoning. Will most certainly make again, no doubt about it.

I ran the recipe just as Colleen suggested... fantastic! But I think I want to tinker with the "heat" a bit. But this is my recipe of choice to play with to make it my own... well... "ours"... thanks Colleen!

flavors were okay, but it reminded me much more of gumbo than jambalaya. it really didn't do it for us. we made microwave burritos after one bowl.

Don't cook rice with the rest. Just make 4 cups rice separately, then mix after cooking main dish and let sit for a while and keep warm. Added a bay leaf for 1st hour, then removed. This Cajun loves this authentic recipe.

This  recipe IS the bomb! Made it for dinner last night and had some left overs. Was going to make something else tonight & favorite son (only son) came in and wanted to know why we weren't having left over jambalaya! Readjusted things and had the left overs. Let me tell you, next day is even better with this dish. Giving the meat and vegetables time to absorb all the spices really increased the flavor. Next time making it a day early. Thank you for submitting!

I loved this recipe! Followed the directions, and it came out great! Even my wife who doesn't like spicy food enjoyed it thoroughly. I would dare say she even raved about it! I added homemade crushed red pepper and fatalii pepper flakes to my bowl to "kick" it up a notch or two....

Loved it!  Made it for a church group of 20. Everyone raved!  I used chicken andouille and a Cajun spice.  For 20 I added about 5 heaping tablespoons of the seasonig. Plenty spicy but not over the top. See below. No other changes. Easy and terrific!  Am making it again this week!  Thanks Colleen

This is a super delicious and super easy recipe! We omitted adding the celery and we like ours more spicy so we added 1 extra tsp each of the Oregano, Cajun Season, Parsley, and Cayenne Pepper and an extra half tsp of the Thyme   This is our go-to weekend favorite meal! My family of 4 can get 3 meals out of this!

I made this as directed and used spicy hot sausage and it was delicious! It is very meaty and the taste is perfect if you like it spicy hot. I will definitely make this again and again.

I followed recipe exactly and it was amazing! Almost exactly. I had to use crused tomatoes and it worked just fine. Very spicy.. Delicious, authentic taste! We served it on rice. I wouldn't change a single thing.  I found my Cajun spice at a dollar general for a buck... Perfect! And the johnsonville makes the type of sausage this recipe calls for... Loved everything about it!

This is a great recipe for Jambalaya! My husband and i just love the flavor. We didn't change anything with the seasoning and spices. 

We did add 2 cups of rice, 1 more can of chicken broth and took out the celery and chicken.

Always my go to recipe.  Everyone loves it.  I serve it over rice or farrow which gives it a nice heartiness.  I play around with the amount of cayenne I put in depending on how spicy I want it that day.

Almost followed recipe exactly except I omitted the shrimp and substituted 1 lb beef stew meat for the chicken.Drained about 60% of the liquid from the diced tomatoes and it is a perfect consistency. Prepare the rice separately.  Make sure you don't go cheap on the sausage; go to the market and spend a little more, you will know the difference.

Delicious! I used petite diced tomatoes without draining and made the rice separately in a rice cooker.  It was a bit soupy, but when added on top of the rice gave a nice balance.  Next time, I would add more celery as I really enjoyed its texture.

Great recipe. Too spicy for my daughter, and almost for me, so next time I'll reduce the cayenne a lot. My crock pot cooks quickly, so I needed to reduce the time. I did use frozen chicken tenders , and put them in whole and frozen and just cut them up once the dish was cooked. Will definitely make again.

It was fantastic! Everyone loved it! We aren't big on spice though so I substituted the cayenne and cajun for a half tsp of red pepper flakes, added a bit more chicken broth (1/8 cup) and didn't add shrimp. We ate it served on crackers, which was fantastic! I would recommend this to anyone, even someone who isn't big on spice!

This was a fabulous recipe!  We asked a few family members over for dinner because it made so much.  EVERY ONE OF THEM RAVED ABOUT IT! It was not too soupy.  The only change I made was to add a couple of cloves garlic (minced).  Thank you for submitting!

I don't particularly care for Jambalaya but my family loves it. They like this recipe a lot, the only complaint was that is was too watery. Next time I will drain the tomatoes. I made this as directed except that I used frozen shrimp and added it at the same time as the rest of the ingredients. The shrimp was just fine did not get chewy. Will definitely make this again.

Last night it was delightful....Left out green pepper because we both get too gassy...also I got the wrong tomatoes they were crushed but I think it made the sauce a little thicker than others described!!!!  Great flavor!

This was delicious. .of course I added my own touch with some help with other reviews...I only had one 14 oz can of diced tomatoes so I also used some cherry tomatos I had in the fridge I cut them in half..I added 2 tsps fresh minced garlic..no cayenne so I used 4 tablespoons tony catchers creole seasoning and sprinkled red pepper flakes...also used beef smoked sausage...and browned the sausage chicken onion pepper and celery in a pan before hand but only for a few mins..drained and added to crock pot..also I dont like thyme so I used sage....added can of tomato paste..and cooked rice in chicken broth seperatly but only half cooked the rice and added it when I added the shrimp and turnes it on high for the last hour

MY FAMILY WENT NUTS OVER THIS RECIPE....THEY LOVED IT. I had to make a few altercations because most of them don't eat pork (I am strictly a seafood eater no other meats....so I didn't get any of this....made a separate seafood only batch for myself). I used turkey and beef sausage for my families pot full. It was not hard to put any of it together I did have to go out and purchase a REAL slow cooker... lol mine was only a 2qt so besides that and a lot of chopping it was a snap. I didn't have time to do the eight hours so I put it on high and did the 4 hours adding the shrimp last (as suggested) it was a hot (not for taste but as in great) hit... Thanks for the different suggestions and Colleen thanks for the recipe.

I dont make alot of cajun food, but I do enjoy the spices in cajun/creole cooking. I made this recipe as instructed. It smells delicious while it was cooking. I took other reviewers suggestion to cook the rice in its original juice last 1/2 hour of cooking (so it isn't so runny). But I was just unimpressed with the flavors. I am not sure what spice overpowered the dish, but I just didn't like it. My husband ate it and felt the same way. Won't be making this again!

I cooked whole boneless thighs, the sausage, and the tomatoes & broth in the crockpot.  Before serving, I chopped the chicken, then I sautéed the peppers, onions and a bit of garlic & added it to the crockpot, along with a couple cups of cooked rice. The rice absorbed a lot of the liquid.  We loved it!

Very good the whole family liked the dish. The andouille sausage is going to influence the level of spice considerably. So depending on what you use the soup could be a lot spicier. Substituted scallops for the shrimp. Added some spicy barbecue sauce to a bowl of left over soup and it was good with the added sweet, spicy, smokey flavors.

This stuff rocks.  It was easy to put together, tasted great and for the event that I made it for was gone in a heart beat.  I had several requests for the recipe and several wanted to know when I would make it again. I used 1 1/2 times each ingredient and added some red pepper flakes. Fixin' to make it again.

This recipe is great.  My family doesn't like seafood, so I substituted cubed ham.  The spices are just right.  I really like the fact that the rice is cooked separately.

My family loves this recipe.  I'm a little more generous with the spice as requested by my family.   It's super easy.  My college senior daughter has made this several times for her basketball team's Sunday night dinner.   Highly recommend!

Wow.  This was easy to make and tasted great.  We have enough left-overs for the next few days.  I was concerned that it would need salt, I refrained from adding any (and this is tough for me).  Flavors were perfect.  Will make this again, possibly with crawdads.

awesome! substituted ham for the shrimp and followed another suggestion here and added a can of tomato paste and eschewed the individual spices for a bay leaf and 1.5 tablespoons of Creole Seasoning made from this site too. Made for a party of about 10 adults and 4 kids and unfortunately two of the kids liked it, so I have no leftovers!

This was just okay for me. I followed the recipe as is, and it just seemed to be lacking flavor. I may just be spoiled by the jambalaya my mother made growing up though.

I felt like the oregano overpowered this recipe, I only put in half of the amount and its still really strong. I think next time I'll put in just a pinch if any at all. 
Other than that it was super easy and had great flavors.

OMG! amazing, while helping with hurricane Sandy's displaced people, our camp cooks prepared Jambalaya, it was my first time ever eating it, this recipe is so close to the flavors. I added extra hot sauce. after six hours of slow cooking transferred all ingredients, minus two cups of liquid, to my electric skillet containing white cooked rice and 1 lb. cooked and peeled shrimp. as the rice thickened the dish I added the remaining liquid as need. I would make this dish again, and again.

Wow, this was so bad. I followed the recipe and it turned out really spicy, which is fine for me, but other than that, there was no flavor.  My chicken tasted like newspaper too.  What an expensive waste!  Never again!

Everyone in my family loved this!  Instead of cooking in a crock pot, I made it on the stove in a dutch oven and cooked 1 cup of rice separately.  Then mixed together and didn't find this to be too soupy or mushy as some have said. I used the Creole seasoning blend on this site for the Cajun seasoning.

SO GOOD, but I made some changes:

I don't eat chicken so I added an extra cup of broth to acct for the loss of chicken juices.
I doubled the amount of shrimp and sausage.
And I don't eat sausage so I used Gimme Lean vegan tofu sausage. AMAZING.

With 3 hrs to go on low, I added brown rice. After it was done officially cooking, I left it on keep warm for a few extra hours when I went to run errands. And when I came back, the rice had absorbed all of the liquid. AND IT WAS DELICIOUS.

I am a seasoned cook, and i am sorry to say that my family did not care for this.  To be fair, I haven't had a lot of Cajun food; but usually I can count on an Allrecipes 5-star review to be really good, if not great. Not this time. I don't mind spicy, but this was weird spicy. Just not a good combination of flavors.  My husband is a good sport & says he'll take it for lunch, but I don't know if I have the heart to make him eat it!  I really wish I hadn't wasted all the chicken, shrimp, & sausage on this dish.  I could have made something soooo much better. Like I said, I am a pretty good cook, and it's really not often that I make something bad. So this was a disappointment.

I have cooled this 3 times and it has always turned out great. The last 2 times I used chicken thighs with the bones and skin. After cooking I removed the skin and bones and used the cooking broth instead of canned chicken broth. I have also added a pound of cubed ham for a more meaty jambalaya. We always have a lot left over so we cook the rice separately each time we serve this. The left overs get spicier and taste better.

I ended up only using one 14oz can of diced tomatos and added a can of condensed tomato soup. It tastes even better the next day. I served over jasmine rice and black beans.

I loved this recipe. I made this for dinner and had a lot of leftovers which was nice. I will admit it was rather spicy so next time I might use a little less of the spicier seasonings. If you have a smaller crockpot I would recommend mixing all the ingredients in a bowl before putting it in the crockpot. Unfortunately I made quite the mess trying the mix everything together after putting all the ingredients in. Also this went really well with some bread and would probably be good with some rice too.

YUMMY!!  The whole family loved the flavor of this dish.  I used Italian sausage since that's all I could find and didn't have any celery but tasted really good.

This ended up being super delicious!  I had leftovers that I was able to freeze with rice in individual portions for quick lunches.  

I did not add chicken and I changed the type of sausage but the rest of the recipe I kept the same.  Loved it!!

Followed the recipe but added garlic and a couple of Tbls Worcestershire.  This still wasn't spicy enough for us but is a good base to start with.  This is a MUST!  Do not add the browned sausage/kielbasa at the beginning!  It loses flavor and consistency.  I'm thinking the last hour or before the shrimp.

Oh my gosh!!  This was amazing.  Fixed it just as recipe indicated and served over rice.  The ONLY thing I will do differently next time is leave out the shrimp and the ONLY reason is to reduce cost.  Otherwise.... will remain just as written!!!!!  YUMMO!!!

Delicious! However, I did not use Chicken Breasts, I substituted Chicken Sausage instead. I love Chicken so I will try that next time. I just had some Chicken Sausage I needed to get rid of. The Shrimp was my Favorite part of the dish! I served the Jambalaya over White Rice so the sauce/soupy part can get soaked up! Someone else mentioned it was just okay bc it was a little soupy but I had no issue with it being too soupy bc I would rather have it soupy than dry any day, meaning this dish is very moist! Made me and my Mom very happy! :D

I may have already reviewed this recipe but it has become a go-to in our house so I wanted to make sure I left a review.  I am from Houston originally and therefore have had some great Jambalaya on trips to Louisiana and in restaurants in the area as Cajun cooking definitely has spread to east Texas. This is a VERY EASY recipe that is great for busy folks with kids as it is authentic in taste and takes so little time to prepare in the crockpot.  Although the rice does not cook with it, the flavor is so rich because it cooks for so long that even after you pour it on regular rice, you still get a great flavor.  I follow the recipe although I measure by sight but if you want to tone down the spiciness, just add less of the hot stuff!  I think if you add all the liquids called for and maybe some extra chicken broth you could throw instant rice in there and it would cook up fine.  I may try that myself and if it works, I will post another review.  Just hate to waste expensive shrimp and ruin the recipe.  May get brave enough one day! Thanks for the recipe!  It is a family favorite as well as all guests who have tried it.

Just made this in the crock pot today - delicious!  A tad more liquid than I typically like but I'd just drain off a little of the diced tomato liquid.  I might ramp up the Canjun and Cayenne a bit more - dish had heat but could use more.  Easy prep so I highly recommend this dish.

This one's a keeper!  It was so simple and tasted soooooo good!  Perfect amount of spices.  Great ingredients.  I used a really good ring bologna instead of andouille and am glad or it may have been too spicy for my family.  It still had a good amount of heat.  I also added 2 t. sugar--I always do when cooking with tomatoes because my grandma told me to.  It was pretty soupy, but I had about 2 c. of red beans and rice and added it to the crock pot at the end.  Heated through.  Awesome.

I just got done eating this and it tasted nothing like the real jambalaya. I followed the recipe to the T and I felt like it was missing a 'WOW' taste. Also, this was more like a soup. The chicken was dry and the 'soup' was bland.

Very flavorful! Needed a tsp more of oregano and added a bit more cayenne because we like it hotter, but followed the recipe as written. We used the high setting because we started this late. Very good! Making it again today.

This dish was fantastic! We really like spicy dishes so it was perfect. I drained the disced tomatoes because i didn't want it to be so soupy. I also added the rice at the last hour of cooking. I didn't fully cook the rice. It made so much that we had leftovers for a couple days.

Very good recipe. I agree that Jambalaya is better if the rice is cooked right in with everything else, so I added more chicken broth and added 2 cups of rice about 2 hours before serving time.  I also stir fried the shrimp and added them at the top.

Love this recipe, it cooks up so nicely and easily, not to mention, its delicious. The only thing that varied for me was the cook time, it was fully cooked on low in about half the time recommended in the recipe. My family loves this dish, and I usually throw in some dirty rice towards the end to thicken it all up.

Made this for my lunch club at work in honor of Mardi Gras.  It was super easy to make and really tasty.  I served it over rice white rice for an added touch.  The co-workers loved it and have been asking for the recipe.

This was delicious!  The only change I made was the canned tomatoes.  I thought I had regular diced tomatoes in the pantry but I had diced with basil, garlic and oregano and I think it added nicely to the overall flavor of the dish.  I also cut the recipe in half since there are only two of us and it made just enough for us to have seconds.  I'll definitely be making this again!

This was a really delicious, easy jambalaya.  I've never made it before so I wasn't sure how it would come out.  Only 2 things I might change:  it was too soupy/runny for our taste so maybe decreasing the broth would help, and it needed rice.  Next time I'll throw in some cooked rice near the end.  Otherwise yummy!

Came out great, added a can of tomato paste to make it a little thicker.  Also left out some of the cayenne, perfect heat!

I made it a bit more soupy by adding about 1 and 3/4 cups of chicken broth, and I added some heat with 2 habaneros and two yellow chiles, also included some ground smoked cumin in the spices.  It came out really spicy, but thats the way i like it.  I accidentally purchased Jumbo Shrimp that had the tails still on, next time i'll try to find smaller shrimp that are free of the tail.

This was a great recipe, and SO easy to make.  I omitted the broth knowing that the veggies would put off a lot of moisture, and ended up not needing it at all.  I also cut back very slightly on the meat (all three types) because packaging is in different quantities than listed, but it still made TONS.  I subbed beef sausage for the lower fat content which turned out just fine, but I'm sure it's amazing as written... have to try it with andouille next time!
I also tossed in about a teaspoon of roasted garlic (will probably double or triple that next time) and a teaspoon of very spicy, roasted pepper pureé at the end of cooking since it's quite mild as written.  Thinking I will use Rotel instead of just diced tomatoes next time as well for the added kick.
I served this over brown rice for dinner, and it was a big hit.  Very flavorful, simple as can be with easy to find ingredients, and of course there is the always wonderful ease of the slow cooker preparation.  With a liner, it makes for quick cleanup as well.  
Jambalaya can be intimidating since you have to leave it alone so the rice won't clump or undercook, but this version is a nice alternative allowing you to poke and stir as much (or as little) as you like and instead adding rice at the end.  This recipe is going into my regular rotation... thanks for sharing it!

My husband really enjoyed this.  I made this without the Cajun seasoning or the celery and it turned out just fine. I did add a few shakes of red pepper flakes for more heat.  It was great served over rice.  Will make again!

A keeper!   Followed the reccipe for the most part except did add shrimp and used half the pepper., and husband thought it was still a little too warm.   We thought it had very  good flavor. It  was brothy as mentioned by a few other reviews, however we added a scoop of cooked rice and  a a dollup of sour cream to our bowls and  used some crusty bread to soak up the juices....a keeper.

This was really good, but I do agree with a lot of the reviewers...a little too spicy. I like spice, but when I make this again, I will definitely cut the cajun seasoning and cheyenne pepper in half. I also cooked three cups of brown rice and added it at the end. Very healthful with the chicken, shrimp and fresh veggies.

I've never made Jambalaya before. This recipe was SUPER easy!!! I used fresh shrimp instead of the frozen (I needed to clean that other vein out of them that most people don't clean) and Italian seasoning since I didn't get any thyme at the store. I will DEFINITELY be making this again!!!

This is one of my husband's favorites.  We leave out the shrimp as we have a picky 7 year old, but it's otherwise wonderful.  I also leave out the cayenne and we usually only have polska kielbasa on hand, but it's still tasty.

I made a few changes to this and felt that it turned out perfectly! I used 2 cups of broth and 1 cup of water and then put in one cup of uncooked brown rice to cook with the meat and veggies. I omitted the chicken and just used the shrimp and sausage. This was a bit spicy, but I don't think I would do anything to tone it down. It was a bit spicy for my 2 year old, but the adults thought it was tolerable.

Cooked the shrimp seperate to avoid over cooking.  Strained all the juice and wound up with 4 cups.  Cooked 2 cups of white rice with it and mixed it all back up.  Served it with a top rated cornbread from this site, crowd pleaser for sure, thanks

I followed the recipe with the exception of using chorizo rather than andouille sausage, and it was great! It was very spicy and flavorful, but all of us like heat. Great recipe and SO easy!

I've made this recipes dozens of times and given it out many times as well. Thank you Colleen for posting. I find it is very forgiving and seems so simple I'm surprised it tastes so good. I often forget to add the shrimp and have used many kinds of sausage. It turns out great every single time!

I made this without rice for a low carb meal.  Absolutely delicious!  I didn't have the oregano or  thyme spices so I used 2 tsp of Old Bay Seasoning instead.  I also added a heaping tsp of minced garlic.  My crock pot is broke so I made this on top of the stove.  I cooked it about an hour.  It was soupy so I thickened up the liquid with cornstarch in a side dish and then added it back in.  It gave the jamabalaya a nice thick gravy.  My husband, not as much a low carber as me, used the gravy to dip some whole grain bread slices in.  We both loved it.  I have a lot of leftovers that I am thrilled about.  I will definitely make this again!

This was really good, but it turned into a soup which is why I gave 3 stars.  No way I could eat this over rice.  I told my husband I made jambalaya soup, and had it that way.

This was fantastic!!!!!  I didn't think I would like it because I don't like hot stuff...but this was great!  I halved the recipe and added 3 cloves of garlic, each cut in half! I made white rice seperately, then put a scoop in a bowl and surrounded it with the jambalaya...ate club crackers with it....LOVE IT!

Got rave reviews. From other reviews, I took their advice and used the excess liquid from the slow cooker and remaining chicken broth from the can in my rice cooker to cook the rice. Very flavorful and still plenty of liquid was left in the dish. I did only use half the cayenne to taste and left out the sausage for dietary reasons, but very easy, yummy recipe. We'll definitely use again.

A great dish.  Was the best Jambalaya I've ever had.  However, unless you want it extremely hot, don't use a teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  I used a half teaspoon and it was very spicy.  Also, I used cooked frozen shrimp but mine turned out too tough.  Next time I'll use raw shrimp and only cook it for no more then ten minutes.  This should make a great recipe even better, I think.

I've made this recipe 3x so far and I absolutely love the flavor! I even made it for this past year's Xmas party and got great reviews. There's only 3 slight changes I've made to the recipe:
1) Rather than using 1 cup broth, I used the entire can (main reason is I'm an amateur cook, I don't know what else to do w/ the remaining)
2) Increased chicken to 1 1/2 lbs, per request from the boyfriend (big meat eater)
3) Added 2 cups okra. This is a personal pref in my jambalaya.  

Overall, w/ the extra broth, there was plenty of 'soup' to add the rice! Thank you for sharing the recipe with an amateur cook!

LOVED it. I made this on the stove top. I left out the celery and chicken broth because I didn't have either. I also didn't have the shrimp. I also thickened it up a bit with some flour.

I can't comment on authenticity as I have never had jambalaya before.

This recipe is awesome and the 8 other people I fed it to tonight agree!  I followed the recipe to a tee, only thing I added was a couple cloves of chopped garlic and I used raw frozen shrimp added an hour before it was all done cooking.  Also, there was no andouille sausage at my grocery store so I bought sausage called Lousiana hot links, I figured it must be close.  Thank you Colleen!

I added salt, black pepper, and just a bit more chicken broth (we wanted it more like a soup). It turned out really well.  The smell filled the house all day and was very flavorful.

This was great, loved that the slow cooker did all the work. Had everything ready the night before, toss into the slow cooker in the morning and come home to a hot tasty meal after work. Perfect!

great taste.  very easy to make.  I added about 1/2 cup more chicken broth and 1 15oz can of plain tomato sauce.  I made this modification the 2nd time around to make more of a soup like consistency.  If you prefer less juice the orginal recipe is fine.

Very good. It was lacking a little in flavor- next time I will add more seasoning as well as some salt. We used turkey sausage and fresh shrimp. Will definitely make again!

Like previous readers said, it was a bit soupy but I drained out the liquid and it was delicious!  I would have used the liquid on white rice but I ended up using a jambalaya boxed rice instead.  I'm using the leftover liquid now to cook white rice IN!  YUM!

I don't know how authentic this is...more of a soup than true jambalaya I believe.  Even so, this is a really good stew.  I use turkey sausage.  To cut down the spice for some people, I suggest adding a dollop of sour cream to their bowl.  This cools it off for those who aren't into much spice.  Love the flavor myself!
Also, I add the rice directly to the cooker around the same time as the shrimp.  Thickens it up and tastes fine.

This is a really delicious and easy receipe.  Leftovers are great, too.  Have already stocked up on ingredients to make it again....soon.  I did adjust the 'heat' by using less Cayenne and using Kielbasa instead of Andouille.  Still great. Highly recommend this recipe!

Fabulous and easy!  Fairly spicy, so if you like less heat, you could tune back the cayenne.  But I liked it just the way it is.  I made it without the shrimp and didn't miss it at all.

Easy to prep.  Delicious over brown rice.  I liked that it is served over the rice and rice is not cooked with the jambalaya.

We weren't very fond of it. My husband is from Louisiana (not that he should be the go to guy on cuisine), but he said it was mediocre.  I ended up draining the juice and blotting the "meat" of the soup and put it ontop of my salad :)

This was 'ok' but not a stellar recipe.  I did cut back on the cayenne a bit, and felt it still had enough heat but lacked something in flavor. Could have to do with the brand of cajun seasoning I bought - who knows.  We enjoyed it enough and will eat the leftovers but probably won't be making it again.

Good recipe. Used a smoked chicken and smoked deer sausage that I had on hand. Very flavorful and my kids loved it! Very easy to prepare and I love the fact that I threw it all in a crock pot and never worried about it again. I did cook the rice seperately and put the Jambalaya on the rice when serving. Will make this again!

This smelled delicious, but it was bland. Adding the shrimp, even when I used raw shrimp, for the last half hour was too long; it seems like just adding them in and giving them a few minutes to cook through would be more effective. I'm thinking that perhaps we'd like this better if I took the time to saute the veggies and brown the meat first. It wasn't a bad recipe, just not as flavorful as I was expecting.

Made this per the recipe.  Husband and I really like it.  Spices were spot on!  Served it over brown rice and topped with a sprinkle of cheddar cheese.  It made the house smell wonderful all afternoon.

Easy to make, good to eat.  I brown the sausage before adding it to the slow cooker.  Browns the outside and renders off a little of the fat.

The seasoning in this was superb! I left out the chicken and used canned shrimp, because I don't have enough money to buy real shrimp, and it was great! We enjoyed it more than the boxed kind we used to make, so this will replace that, thanks so much!

I dont give a flip if this Rx is not authentic Cajun.
A while before serving I add slightly undercooked Ziti to soak up some of the liquid instead of serving it on rice. Its a huge success at parties.

This is really quite good.  The spicing is spot on!  I add 1 pound of smoked pork butt (cubed) and 1 cup of diced yellow squash for color and 1 cup of chopped carrots for color and sweetness.

I used this recipe for our Lions dinner for 50 people and got a lot of wonderful comments on the meal.  This is a great dish to serve to a crowd.  I served white rice on the side.  For dessert, I made bread pudding, copied from Mother's Restaurant in New Orleans.  It was very good!

Not the true Jambalaya but pretty good, my teenagers gobbled it up.  I added some garlic & next time will use tabasco sauce (for the vinegar flavor)  instead of cayenne pepper.  With this quantity, I think the servings should be stated: 8-10.  There is definitely not enough for 12 adults.

I really liked the recipe, but it was a little thin for my taste and I love the amount of spice, but would tame it down for guests.  I added the rice to the slow cooker at the end so that it would thicken up a bit.  All and all, very good recipe and would make again.

I am giving this recipe 5 stars based on my husband's excitement.  I enjoyed it as well, but it was a bit too spicy for me.  My husband absolutely loved it!!!!!  I didn't have time to make it in a slow cooker, so I sauteed the onions in a bit of oil, added the chicken to brown, and finally added the andouille sausage.  I let it cook for a few minutes before adding the other ingredients, minus the shrimp.  I added some rice during the last 20 minutes of cooking and the thawed out shrimp during the last 10 minutes.  Spicy, yet delicious, and even better the next day!

Great recipe. I thought the sauce should have been thicker so I made a tomato sauce roux with cornstarch, and added it to the slowcooker. About 5 minutes later I had a perfect Jambalaya.

I had never made Jambalaya before, but this recipe received rave reviews from my family.  Instead of using a slow cooker I made stove top in a dutch oven.  I browned the chicken and sausage, added the vegetables along with 1 3/4 cups of long grain rice, an extra cup of chicken broth and 1 1/2 cups of water.  Instead of diced tomatoes I used crushed tomatoes.  Spices are just right.  This recipe is great and so easy to make.

This recipe was horrible.  It had no flavour and was extremely thin.  The sauce was like water and the chicken was way overcooked.  I only cooked it for 7 hrs on low.  I tried thickening the sauce with corn starch and putting the rice in with the sauce, but that made it worse.  It tasted like the corn starch and the rice went to mush.  I'm very disappointed that this recipe was the top rated slow cooker jambalaya.  I couldn't give it 0 stars, so I guess it gets a 1.

My husband loved it! Thought it was awesome... I thought it was way too spicy. I'll have to tame it a little next time.

Was a big hit at the meeting I made it for. I added minute Rice about 1/2 hour before hand and the cooker I use has a warm setting. Was just the way I liked my Jambalya.

When making this recipe I made a couple adjustments just because that is what I had on hand! I used "Lumberjack" Smoked sausage instead of the andoullie sausage and it turned out great! Also, after reading some other reviews I noticed someone put the chicken breasts in whole and frozen! Well seeing as I didn't start this until lunch time this worked out really well for me! Like others I started to notice that it was a little thin after cooking for a good 4 hours so I decided to try to thicken up the sauce a bit by adding tomato paste blended with a spoon full of corn starch! I was a little nervous at first but it actually turned out perfectly and boosted the flavor! Overall this is an excellent dish.. and you HAVE to serve it with cornbread too!!

This is so good. I've made it 4 or 5 times. Don't skimp and use kebasa or smoked sausage, real andouille makes the difference! I use extra cajun seasoning and no shrimp. I want to try with carrot but always forget to buy it when im getting everything else. This gets pretty soupy but I simply drain the mix before adding this to rice.

Great recipe, I doubled the ingredients before hand anticipating the great turnout, so I could njoy for a few days. To lessen the juices I only added 28 oz of diced tomatoe with juice. Tweeked the Sausage by adding Turkey Hot Links, my wifes favorite. after 3 hours on high. I added 1 bag of Shrimp along with 2 bags of rice, and let cook for 45 more minutes. The flavor from the Links, soaked deeper into the diced breasts for excellent flavor!!! My 9 year old, woke from her sleep asking what was that great smell....This recipe is a Winner!!!

YUM!  I absolutely love anything spicy and this is so awesome for cold days!  My kids won't eat it because it's too spicy, but I definitely will and hopefully my husband will.  And honestly, you don't HAVE to have rice, and it's a nice low carb, very filling and satisfying bowl of soup/stew.  But I am currently waiting for my jambalaya flavored rice to get done cooking, about 20 more minutes and i can't wait.  Funny, i'm watching the waterboy on tv while eating this.    Only thing I did different, was used red bell pepper, cause it's all I had and put lots of sliced garlic in it and some extra cajun seasoning.  and i didn't have andouille sausage, although i'm sure that would be amazing, so i used ground vegetarian "sausage" and it's really good, but i'm sure not the same.  It's all I had though.  Super easy to put together.  I will def be making this A LOT!

This recipe is fantastic!  I've made it twice, once with regular smoked sausage and once with Andouille.  The Andouille was definitely best, but the smoked sausage is good in a pinch.  I've gotten many compliments on this dish.

terry and jordan didn't like.  i actually put in already cooked left over chicken.  bad move.  the chicken turned out like tasteless dry meat.  even if i had put in raw chicken, i dont think this would be a recipe i would try again.

This was excellent.  Very much a soup and next time I think I will reduce the liquid to make it more like shrimp creole.  Delicious as a soup as well!  I used chicken sausage instead of andouille sausage because it was on sale and the calories were right.  I added 1 tsp of hot sauce to the recipe to make up for this.  We are spicy food crazy and this was plenty hot for us!

This is an excellent recipie that I have made many, many times.  The only two variations that I have incorportated (which I feel to make this excellent recipie even better) is to change the sausage to spicy turkey sausage, and change the cup of chopped celery to a cup of chopped cilantro, and add it near the end with the shrip so it doesn't become too soggy.

This dish was very easy and flavorful/spicy.  I took the other reviewers suggestions and put the chicken in at the last few hours so it wouldn’t dry out and cut the chicken after it was cooked.  I used the whole can of chicken broth and a ½ teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  I made some brown rice and put it in bowl and ladled the Jambalaya over it.  My family LOVED it!!!

I made this recipe last night with the following changes and was delighted with the finished product. I omitted the cayenne because the andouille sausage and Cajun seasoning I use are plenty spicy. I also added about 4-5 cloves of sliced garlic. It is soupy, but rice absorbs the juices nicely. I packed hot rice into a one cup measure and place the packed rice into the center of a large rimmed soup plate. I then ladled the jambalaya around the mound of rice and sprinkled fresh minced parsley on it as a garnish. My guests said it was "restaurant quality."

Delish! I reccommend a different method of cooking the chicken.  Perhaps throw it in when you throw in the shrimp?  It was very dry!  Like, toss aside dry... and I looove chicken! Flavors are great!

Excellent! I added garlic, used 2 cans of Rotel tomatoes with chiles (plus all the juice) and ended up adding another can of garlic & onion tomatoes towards the end along with some chicken broth to create enough juice so I could add rice during the last hour as others suggested.  I cooked it on high for 3 hours before adding the rice so maybe when I make it again I will reduce the cook time a bit.  I omitted the cayenne pepper b/c I was afraid it would be too hot - it had a good kick to it but next time I'll go for broke and use all the pepper.  This got better and better and we ate if for lunch two days straight until it was all gone.  Thanks, Colleen!

I followed the recipe with few exceptions. I used chipotle seasoned diced tomatoes, (I used two 14.5 oz cans; one I added juice and all, the other I drained most of the juice before adding tomatoes) and a mixture of frozen red, green, and yellow bell peppers.  I also added one clove of diced garlic.  It turned out great and I served it over Basmati rice.  My husband is usually not a fan of crock pot meals and this was the first one he has ever enjoyed!

delicious, but modified it a little, putting in hot sauce and another can of tomatoes, did not have any celery though, love the slow cooker idea, just let it stew for the day and voila a delicious meal at the end of the day

This wasn't my typical slow cooker type meal so my husband was surprised when I told him we were having Jambalaya.  I used smoked sausage because that is what I had on hand and served over rice.  YUM!

This is AMAZING. The only things I did differently was: added 1 lb of cubed ham. added all seasining to 1/2 cup of chicken broth and stirred before puring over mixture in slow cooker. after stirring the mixture I sprinkled old bay seasoning over the top. I also sprinked old bay over the top after adding the shrimp and stirring. served over zattarains jumbalaya rice (mild). my husband and I ate the entire thing in the course of 3 days. (leftovers are awesome!)

I thought this was amazing! It definitley made a huge pot though... maybe next time I will cut everything in half. It is way too much food for 2 people.

Made using hot Italian sausage just because we had some and it was DELICIOUS.  Spicy, but we like spicy food.  My whole family loved this and we will make it again and again.

Very good. I served this over brown rice with a salad & french bread w/olive oil for dipping. The only thing I added was a bit of green onion to the mix. I also used smoked turkey sausage instead of the other kind, and raw shrimp instead of cooked, added in an hour before it was all done.

This jambalaya is absolutely amazing! I used kielbasa sausage and small shrimps. YUMMY! Can't give this enough stars! Thank you for the great recipe! The only downside is that it doesn't do too well as leftovers, it gets soupy quickly. So I did the 1/2 since it is just my husband and I. Other than that, no complaints!

This was tasty.  Made it as recipe stated, but just added more tomatoes.  Used Creole Seasoning on this site to season.

I was actually nervous about so much of the tobasco and cayenne pepper being too much in this since I am a wimp when it comes to overly spicy food but this is just the right amount. Leftovers were fantastic. Made lots, and ended up throwing in left over cooked rice into the leftovers

Simple, leftovers taste just as great the next day.  Make the whole batch (12), you'll eat all within two days.

Yum! To cut down on the fat and cholesterol, I used turkey sausage. My husband thinks it needs more tomato and less juice. Since I enjoy the broth, I'll save that part for myself!  I also threw in some Franks Hot sauce because of it's unique flavor.  Just the right amount of spice for us.

This is so good! Unfortunately the first time I made it we had just found out the day before that my oldest son is allergic to shrimp(which happens to be his FAVORITE food). Not thinking I told him he had to eat something else! My hubby requested it again, and I thought, DUH I can take out his portion BEFORE I add the shrimp! So yummy, AND it gets to stay in the recipe box! Thanks!

I've never really had Jambalaya before, and thought that this was ok...Its not something that I would rave about. However, my husband LOVED it, and is even more excited that there is plenty of leftovers to take to work for the next couple of days. I didn't have enough cajun seasoning, so I substituted chipolted seasoning...my husband said it was what made it so awesome (his words). It was runnier than I expected, and I took the advice of others not to add the fluid from the tomatoes. I will probably make again, knowing what to expect....but more so for my hubbies sake than my own.

My husband cannot get enough of this dish! Which is good 'cause it serves an army. At first I was afraid it would be too soupy. But when you serve it on top of rice it is just right! I couldn't find andouille sausage(or whatever it is) so I used smoked sausage and kicked up the cayanne like one of the reviewers suggested and it was great!!

SOOO Good!! I made almost exactly according to the recipe, but used jalapeno smoked sausage because I couldn't find andouille sausage. It turned out wonderful and just the right amount of spicy. Will make again soon!

I thought this recipe was not good.  It was too soupy, although I cut down the liquids.  I used raw shrimp, which was an improvement.  The chicken breasts were dry - use dark meat chicken.To have any spiciness at all, something like Tabasco would be needed.  This was a disappointment to me and my guests from the South.

i followed the exact recipe minus the cayenne pepper as i can't handle things too spicy, and i used creole seasoning as opposed to cajun seasoning because it's what i had on hand.  flavor wise it was great! and the sausage had just enough kick for me - the cayenne would've killed me!  i cooked it 4 1/2 hours on high, adding the shrimp at 3 1/2 hours and 2 cups of rice at 4 hours.  it was too soupy for me, thus why i added the rice on recommendation from other reviewers.  the rice definitely soaked up the liquid, however i think it soaked it up too much and the rice ended up mushy.  so maybe more rice would solve that problem however i don't know that my crockpot could hold much more!  next time i'll omit either the chicken broth or the juice from the tomoatoes to make it less soupy, probably still add the rice in as i like the flavored rice but perhaps more of it, and i'll use raw shrimp as opposed to cooked because i think raw shrimp holds more flavor.  i'll have to try it again with these changes and hopefully boost up my rating...

I though this recipe was pretty good and my boyfriend loved it. I added a few more veggies than suggested and omitted the parsley as I did not have it on hand. I would suggest using raw shrimp and cooking them as opposed to already cooked frozen shrimp as they got kind of tough.   Thanks for the recipe!

I found this to be rather bland (other than the tomato taste)  Maybe I did somethign wrong because everyone else loved it!  I did add 1/2 cooked rice a few minutes before eating to soak up the juice, i tturned out well, but maybe it would have soaked up more flavour if I put the rice in much earlier.

This is delicious!  Pretty much followed the recipe, except omitted the extra cayenne (there's plenty of cayenne in my cajun seasoning) so my kids could handle the heat, and used thawed, uncooked shrimp, pulled off the tails and threw in raw about 20-30 minutes before serving.  Served with cooked rice.  This is a keeper!

This was a complete hit at our Bible Study social. I didn't have celery on hand so I omitted that, and I used stewed tomatoes instead of diced. I also agreed with some of the reviews about it being too soupy so I added 2c of instant rice the last 30 min of cook time, came out perfect. Will definately be having this again.

Great mix of flavors after slow cooking all day.  My kids loved it and my boyfriend and I would prefer more spice, so next time maybe we'll saute some andouille to add to ours at the end.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a hit with my guests!  So easy, so delicious.  However, I think that saying it makes 6 servings is more accurate if this is your main course.

I made this recipe for 200 people. I used 2 "Nesco" roasters to hold it all.  It was absolutely the best ever!!!!!!.  People kept coming into the kitchen asking me what smelled so good. It was gone in NO time at all!  Thank You, Thank You!

This was great! Cannot eat shrimp, so did not add it and added more chicken and sausage.  Will try adding the rice to slow cooker to thicken the Jambalaya before serving  next time. Over all everyone loved it.

The universe was definitely working against me while I was attempting to make this; beginning with my slow cooker blowing up, however I was a trooper and the Jambalaya and I both survived to tell the tale! Even with all the drama, this turned out delicious and will most defiantly join the ranks of our families most favourite recipies!

This was absolutely delicious and one of the easiest things I've ever made. I would probably add more heat the next time around, but the andouille I used wasn't particularly spicy. I also had a little bit of a challenge slicing the uncooked andouille so I actually cooked it like bulk sausage rather than sliced.   I served this with white rice and people couldn't get enough. It's also great reheated (though the shrimp will get tough if you reheat it.)

I wanted to love this recipe, but found it to be rather bland.  I did try punching up the flavor by adding Worchestershire sauce and garlic, but was disappointed.

Yummmmmmy! This was so good. I followed recipe exactly since this was my first time making jambalaya and I am glad I did. It was a little spicey for my taste but my husband and kids said it is just cause I am a wimp! HaHa Can't wait to make again!

Really good recipe! I don't eat meat, but eat fish, so I was looking for a slow cooker recipe with the basic ingredients. Good job with the seasonings...I added a bit of oregano. As far as veggies go I added a bit of corn and okra, 'cause I was trying to get rid of it. A goood recipe to play around with, and one that I will keep. Thanks!

This was a wonderful recipe.  I added slightly more cayenne pepper because I love hot food.  I also added a little rice to my personal bowl right before eating.

I would have rated this recipe a resounding 5 stars except for the fact that 7 hours on low is way too long to cook this.  I think 4 would have been about right.  Other than using raw shrimp, I made this exactly as it reads, and it was delicious.  Just overcooked.  I will definately make this again, though.

I added more spices and left out the bell pepper. I also used fresh uncooked shrimp. It was very tasty, but a little on the soupy side. Next time I think I'll leave out the chicken broth.

Yummy and super easy! I already had some chicken cooked up from a previous meal, so I just shredded it into the crock pot.  This is the only thing that requires much cook time, so I pretty much just left everything in the crock pot long enough to heat through.  Loved the shrimp...seafood is always my favorite part!  Really a good recipe.

Simple and delicious!  My only complaint is my chicken didn't look well done, even though it was fall off the bone delicious. Next time, I will brown my chicken first. Other then that, I wouldn't change a thing!

This was lovely, I didn't have shrimp so I used scallops which were divine (added them in the end). After 4 hours on high, I ended up having to transfer it to my dutch oven and put it in the oven for under an hour as the chicken didn't appear cooked enough (I was using legs as I was out of boneless breast).

Very good.  I used brown rice and a sweet mango sausage.  It was a nice surprise among all the spices.  I will have to work at tweeking the spices to my liking though.  Definitely worthy of a second try!

Very good! I used turkey smoked sausage instead of andouille, I only used half of the green pepper because I don't care much green peppers.  I also only used 1 tsp of Cajun seasoning because I'm not big on spicy.  It was a little soupy so at the end when I added the shrimp I also added some cooked white rice and I mixed some cornstarch and water and added to the mixture and let cook for another 30 mins.  It turned out really nice. It only took about 4 to 5 hours on high.

My husband loved this.  He didn't even bother with rice--just ate it like a soup.  I backed off on the cayenne just a touch, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Very easy and a nice change of pace.

WORD TO THE WISE: COOK RICE SEPARATELY!   This is a GREAT recipe. Easy and tasty. My only mistake was adding uncooked rice. Lesson learned.  This is a spicy recipe, but the spice can be adjusted to suit your own taste. The only thing I did differently was add minced garlic, crushed red pepper, and several bay leaves.

liked a lot.  However, VERY spicy. Next time I will only use 1/4 tsp of cayenne.  I also put raw shrimp in the last hr of cooking.  I experimented by putting in 1 1/2 c of rice the last hour. It was way too much rice. Next time if I add rice I will put 1/3 cup in or just serve over the rice.  This was ready in my slow cooker on LOW for 5 hrs. Yummy! Oh, also, might need a little salt in there too...

Great recipe, I added al ittle more seasoning than called for, and added semi cooked rice in to absorb some of the liquid. It does make alot, however it tastes even better the next day after the flavors meld.

I made this over the weekend and served it over rice.   It was delicious.  I made no changes to the recipe.  I had been looking for a good, simple Jambalaya recipe and I found it.

Excellent dish!  My husband kept saying "this is good" between bites. Trust me, he is not prone to giving out praise.  I followed the recipe as given. I did however cut the cayenne pepper in half.  I was afraid that the cayenne peper and andouille sausage would be to hot for us.  I also added a whole 32 oz container of chicken broth, because I wanted it soupy.  I also put in a package of frozen cut okra.  Just seemed right some how. HA.  A super great recipe and a keeper in this house!  Thanks for sharing.

Spicy and delicious!  I added a swish of wine, a pinch of chicken bouillon granules and a sprinkle of sugar to balance out the flavor and add depth.  Also added an extra tsp. of Cajun seasoning.  Yum.

This recipe is really good, except for the fact that it burned the  out of my mouth! I had a small bowl 15 minutes ago, and my lips are still on fire!! I dont think ill be able to eat any more of this it's so hot! I so MAD!! Next time, ill cut the cayenne pepper in half. I cant believe ONE teaspoon made it that spicy! Def will be making this one in the future. My fiance and dad LOVED it! Maybe i'm just too much of a wimp!

This was great! Much to my disappointment, my grocery store was out of peppers and andouille sausage (right before the Superbowl and 2 feet of snow), so I omitted the pepper and used smoked sausage instead. I also omitted the celery, just because, and used about twice the amount of chicken broth since I didn't want to store it in the fridge and have it grow mold... lol. When I put the shrimp in, I also threw in about a cup-cup and a half of brown minute rice. The rice was cooked just right in a half hour. Everyone in my house loved it, with the exception of my not normally picky 7 year old who said, "It doesn't look yummy". She did eat all the shrimp from her serving however.

Great tasting Jambalaya.  I used Chorizo Sausage since I didn't have any andouille and it was wonderful.  Also just added uncooked rice to the crock pot for the last hour and it cooked up great.  Had to add more liquid because of the rice and found that a bottle of bloody mary mix worked perfectly.

This was the best recipe!!  I used Trader Joe's Chicken Andouille Sausages instead for a lower fat option.  If you do this, I suggest cooking it on low for 5-5-1/2 hours before adding the shrimp. Otherwise this is an A+

This is a really good meal.  I only added some garlic per another person's suggestin.  It was just the right amount of spice and, while it can be a little soupy, adding it to rice makes it just fine. I'm from Louisiana and I say dem good eatins. Serve with salad and french bread!

Made this yesterday. Very easy recipe. My son and husband both loved it. I did quickly brown my chicken and sausage on med-high heat first then cut up and add to the crockpot. I also used peeled/deveined uncooked shrimp and added it the last hour of cooking. The recipe is spicy but we like spicy food and found it just right. I cooked it on high for 4 hours.

This was delicious.  I didn't have any andouille sausage on hand so I used smoked kielbasa.  Also I used raw shrimp which was peeled and deveined.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly as written until the very end when I made a littled bit of roux to stir in and thicken the broth just slightly.  I cooked this on high for about 4 hours and then added the roux and the raw shrimp.  I let it cook 1 hour more.  The shrimp were cooked perfectly.  Since I don't eat a lot of rice, but my family does, I served this over the rice so that each person could choose their own amount of rice.    Very good and I'll make it again and again.

Once I added the rice (which I cooked separately) too much of the flavor was lost.

Decent recipe.  But lacking flavor and heat for me.  I added instant brown rice and uncooked shrimp for the last 30 mins as per some suggestions.  The rice was mushy and the shrimp too soft and flavorless.  I would definitely serve this over rice, not cooked with.  Also, it seems to need some tomato paste and salt.  Maybe cooking the meat first with seasoning would help.  Will not make again.  Sorry!

We loved this one....just a few minor changes....I used turkey kielbasa instead of the andouille, also added some frozen okra....and only about 1/4c to 1/2c. of the chix broth....I also added a touch of cayenne...just in case it was too spicy. I added more cayenne to my bowl because I like it hot and spicy. Served over white rice. Easy and yummy, my hubby loved it! Thanks!

UPDATE: SERVED (FROZEN,THEN THAWED) LEFTOVERS THIS PAST WK. MORAL OF THE STORY... YOU CANNOT FREEZE RICE = NOT SO GOOD. EAT THIS FRESH!!! Pretty good! My fiance & I stayed home 2day to get a few "house chores" (boring!) done. B/c it's Sun., I wanted to serve a "homey" meal (Sun. are reserved for "comfort foods" at our house). Since we were both busy, I needed something that could slow cook all day. This fit the bill perfectly! Although I liked this (my fiance was on the fence...), I think an oven-baked version would suit me better. I've been eyeing Oven Baked Jambalaya (JOSLYN) for some time now, but for convenience sake, I tried Colleen's version instead. I think I will give JOSLYN's recipe a try to next time.... My prob. w/ this is that it's a tad dry for my liking. As many others did, I too add. (3.5 c.) instant rice w/ my shrimp (which by accident, I partially thawed b4 realizing I didn't need to!) at the 3.5 hr. mark & then cooked for another 30 min. as direct. I ended up add. the rest of my can of chx. broth & this helped somewhat, but I think it was the rice that dried everything out. Having said that, it was nice to not dirty another pot (and that IS the purpose of slow cooking, right???). My only other ch. was to purchase a rotisserie chx. b/c I forgot  to thaw what I had in the freezer. Oh, and I had no prob. at all finding andouille sausage. My local Italian market had Johnsonville brand this wk. Served w/ garlic bread, this was a hearty meal! Thx. for sharing! :-)

I followed this recipe fairly closely.  I sautéed the onion/pepper/celery/chicken before putting it in the crock pot and reduced the chicken broth to 1/2 cup.  I loved the result - the chicken was tender and it was nicely spiced (perhaps a tiny bit salty).  Upon cooling, the mixture thickened and so in retrospect, it probably wasn't necessary to reduce the amount of chicken broth.  I'll definitely be making this again!

Wonderful!!!! I never thought such good, authentic jambalaya could be so easy! The main thing I did different was omited the shrimp (so I added a little extra chicken). I also cooked some brown rice the night before when I was preparing everything (I left it in the crockpot in the fridge over night) and stirred the rice in with 10 min to go. I used a green, red and yellow pepper pre-diced mix and used hot sauce instead of chili pepper. This is one of my favorite meals I've ever cooked!!! Thanks so much for sharing!

The flavor is good - but its not the same flavor and consistency of jambalaya.  Its more similar to gumbo (soupy).

The brand of andouille we used had quite a bit of spice in and of itself, so next time I think I will leave out the cayenne pepper and cut back on the Cajun seasoning.  Don't get me wrong.. we love spicy flavors in our house, but this was just a tad too much heat :) The only other change I made was that I served it mixed with cooked rice.

Very good...more like a gumbo than jambalaya.  I did use smoked sausage instead of andouille sausage.

Wow. This is awesome. Only changes - swapped one can of diced tomatoes for Rotel, added 2 cloves minced garlic and some extra shrimp. Served over brown rice. Honestly, it turned me into an eating machine! Thanks for the recipe. It's definitely a keeper.

My family like's spicy and this is definitely spicy! Very good, but I was afraid it would be runny (because of other reviews), so I added some tomato paste and cornstarch. I was still concerned, but the rice absorbs quite a bit of the juices. I'm from MD, so I added Old Bay to my shrimp before adding them.  Also, my family isn't big on cooked celery so I added carrots and garlic.

This recipe was fantastic.  We used a whole rotisserie chicken and used Rotel rather than regular diced tomatoes, which kicked up the spice a bit.  Added mushrooms because we had them in the house.  The only recommendation I have is to put the shrimp in an hour before completion, as they didn't quite abosorb the flavors.  The leftovers did the trick though- YUM!

Easy to make and tastes great!   I served this with Uncle Ben's Cajun 90 second rice (3 packages)and a loaf of French bread.  Made just enough for 6 HUNGRY adults.  Everyone loved it.  We like spicy food so I added extra Cajun seasoning & cayenne.  Also added some tabasco to our individual servings.  Very good!

Easy to make, a little to hot for my kids. Good but not out of the park. I had to thicken as it's quite runny without rice to soak the juices up.

Never used a slow cooker, never made or ate jambalaya and I made this for company.  Well, my nerves were put to rest at the first bite.  Everyone raved and so did I.  The flavor was outstanding. I added cooked rice to it 5 minutes before serving because I was afraid of the reviews that said it was soupy.  Still a little soupy but no one noticed and the next day it was even better.   A definate regular in our home from now on!!!!  You won't be disappointed-promise!!!!

This was so tasty.  My husband and brother-in-law went back for seconds and then thirds!  I added cooked rice to soak up the sauce right before serving it.  I'll be making this every week.  Thanks for sharing!!

Great taste and will cook again!  Couple notes were that I used an entire 14.5 oz can of broth and it was too much liquid.  The Jamalaya cooked up a bit soopy was still worth it.  Secondly, I like a bit more "kick" but as the recipe stands it comes out as a mild dish.  If you want a bit more spice consider adding more pepper or hotter sausage.

Not so good.  The chicken and sausage was extremely overcooked being in the crock pot for 8 hours.  The flavor was good and I managed to salvage some shrimp.  But other than that, I will not make jambalaya in a slow cooker.

Very tasty, but as other reviewers have said, very watery.  I only used 1/2 c broth, but I think next time I would leave that out, and only add it if it looked dry towards the end of the cooking time (like when adding the shrimp).  The flavor also seemed a little "flat" - next time I will use 3 tsp Cajun seasoning to see if that resolves the issue (it was plenty spicy, just missed a little "oomph").  I used boneless thighs, as it seems to me that they tend to do better with the longer cooking times required when using the slow cooker; I added uncooked shrimp at 7 hours and turned the heat to warm, and even then, the chicken was a little overdone to my taste (something to do with the texture), so next time will add the shrimp and turn to low at 6 1/2 hours.  I used Creole Seasoning (from this site), served the jambalaya over rice, and served Homestead Cornbread (also from this site) alongside, with fresh fruit as the salad.  Very nice on a rainy, blustery evening.

The taste was pretty good, but I would not call this Jambalaya. More like a soup. It was OK ladled over rice, but as I said, not a Jambalaya. And DEFINITELY DO NOT use 1 tsp of cayenne unless you really really like super hot food. I didn't have cayenne and used 1/2 tsp of hot hungarian paprika instead (which isn't even as hot as cayenne) and it was plenty spicy. Don't know if I'll make this again.

Wow, this is really good and super easy. Didn't have celery on hand, but I don't like it much anyway, so I didn't miss it. Other than that, the spices are perfect and everything turned out great. Yay for leftovers the next day! Thanks, Colleen!

Excellent dish!  The only things I did different was that I omitted the celery since I dind't have any and instead of a green bell pepper, I used part of a bag of frozen pre chopped mixed peppers since that's all I had.  I did notice how it was runny like others mentioned but that was solved as I threw my rice into the slow cooker to cook and it sopped up and thickened the sauce perfectly.

GREAT RECIPE!   My only variation is that I used the Ro-Tel diced tomatoes (with green chilies).   This added some spice so I eliminated the cayenne pepper.   The spiciness was just right for us - it may still be a little too hot for some people.

Very yummy and healthy!  I left all day in the crockpot (on low) without any problems.  It is soupy, but just use a slotted spoon to get the good stuff out, and then pour a little of the juicy over the rice.  Very good!

Very good!  Super easy, and was a great way to use the ingredients I had in my freezer. I just put all the meat in frozen and worked out great. My other half (from Louisiana) gave it a thumbs up! Used Creole seasoning.

This deserves an extra 5 stars for being so easy. I cut my chicken into cubes while it was still mostly frozen and just threw them in with everything else and it came out fine. I cooked on high for 3 hours and added the shrimp (also frozen) with one hour left. I cut down on the cayenne just a tad because I used half andouille and half LA Hots hot links, which are super hot IMO. I like my jambalaya more dry, but I don't want to change anything with the recipe. I will just drain some of the juice with a slotted spoon before dumping over my rice. Excellent, I can't wait for my family to try it.

I made this, followed the recipe exactly, and it came out pretty liquidy.. Very much like a Jambalaya Stew/soup almost. I was hoping for something thicker. Was still tasty though, and my boyfriend has requested that I make it again. I, personally, just wanted something a bit thicker and with more of a kick. This was on the milder side of 'cajun' recipes.

This was great! It was supper simple to prepare and tasted great. I served it over rice. The leftovers were just as good. I definitely plan to make this recipe again, but I may omit the shrimp to make it an even more affordable dish!

Although this recipe was brothy, when I added the rice (2bags of boil in bag taken out of the bags) and shrimp in the last hour (cooking on low) it thickened up beautifully and my bf loved it, the heat was doable and the sour cream topping mellowed it out great for those that couldnt handle the kick.  I cooked it 2hrs on high then 4 hrs on low so the flavors had a chance to develop. Also I added the shrimp frozen at the end so they ended up not overcooking in the hour on low heat.

Followed the recipe except for adjusting for my slowcooker that cooks very hot, and ehhh, it was okay.  A little too much meat/too little vegetable, and too much liquid to pass off as Jambalya, imo.  Reheated leftovers tasted very bland.

Really enjoyed this...I hadn't made a Jambalaya before and this was great.  Used Kielbasa sausage and frozen chicken breasts that I shredded later.  Added the Creole Seasoning Blend that I made from this Allrecipes and it was great.  Thank you.

This recipe was awesome!  Very easy to make and tasted very very good. As for the reviews of being too watery, some jambalaya's are a little soupy for a slow cooker you just can't go wrong.  I used the creole seasoning recipe from this web site (3 Tbsp) you might just use 2 Tbsp. of the seasoning if spicy is not your thing.  Next time I will definitely use shrimp, all I had was chicken and some hillshire turkey kielbasa.  I used some left over rotisserie chicken and it was perfect, also added 1 boneless breast I recommend if you add chicken breast not to put it in until the last hour because it was a little over cooked.  But I personally will use a rotisserie chicken again next time the meat was perfect!

This was great!  Substituted 3 TB of "Creole Seasoning Blend" from this site in place of all the spices.  Had great flavor- a little spicy but not too much to handle.  DH agrees, this is a keeper!

Really tasty and easy. It is a bit more liquidy that the usual stuff, but not a soup. The only thing I'll do differnt next time is grill the sausage a bit before hand. I would have liked to see some grill marks on it.

I love this recipe, except that I like my rice to cook with everything else.  So, I sauteed the meat and veggies, threw everything plus 1 tablespoon of sugar, minus meat, in a pot.  I included 1 part rice, 2 parts chicken stock, and cooked the rice.  The meat was added at the end to avoid overcooking.  The crockpot may reduce the pre-cooking, but my approach avoided the long cook time.

This was a good base recipe, but after I followed it almost too the letter, it was kind of bland. I think next time, I'll look for a better cajun spice since I think that might have been part of the problem.

My husband declared this the best jambalaya he's ever had before we even plated it. He was taking bites out of the crock pot. =)   I followed the recipe with the exception of using the Creole Seasoning that another reviewer suggested and I'm glad I did! That seasoning is delicious!! I also drained half of the tomato juice out because some people said it was soupy. Mine still came out soupy but we actually kind of liked the consistency. The juice really went well with the rice. While it was a little soupier than restaurant jambalaya the flavor was fantastic! And really, if it's too soupy for your liking just don't scoop out the juice. Thanks! (This was even better the second day! I made brown rice using 50% broth and 50% of the juice from the jambalaya and it was delicious!)

This was great!  Between work and school I'm always looking for "keeper" slow cooker recipes, and this is definitely one of them!  My changes (due to taste/ingredients on hand): Added 1 clove of minced elephant garlic, added 1 packet of Chipotle Taco seasoning, substituted Turkey Keilbasa for the sausage.  It was light and spicy (we love that!!) and delicious!

I only did a couple of things different...  1) lessened the cayan pepper a tad & 2) used raw frozen shrimp instead of cooked and added it 1 hr prior to finish.  It was perfect!

Overall this was pretty good. Very quick and easy to prepare. For us, the heat level was perfect. Unlike many other reviewers, I didn't find that it was too "soupy".  However, I did feel like something was missing, though I am not sure what. I'll probably make again and see what I can do.

Made this last night. Didn't have the sausage so I used smoked sausage instead.  It was okay but I felt it was missing something.  My husband loved it though.  I may tinker with it and make changes to it to see if I can make it taste how I want it to taste.

I am cooking this right now and my house smells great! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is b/c I had to make some adjustments based on what I had...I used a can of mexicorn and a can of budlight clamato (closest thing to tomato that I had!) I also used regular italian sausage and instead of the spices listed used the creole seasoning from this site...my mouth is watering b/c just smelling it cook! This will definitely be a regular b/c it is SO easy to make and it is one of those recipes that you already have the ingredients in your kitchen!

My family loved this! I accidently got boudain sausage, and I didn't use chicken either. I also omitted the thyme because I don't care much for it. I will definitely make this again, and I will try it with the right sausage and chicken!

this was very good.i halved it and added 1 c instant rice during the last half hr of cooking. it helped absorb some of the liquid but not all of it. i then took some of the juices from the cooker and made a cornstarch paste and cooked another 15 mins or so. this helped thicken it to the perfect consistency and almost acted loke a roux. i served it with the honey cornbread form this site.

This was fantastic!  And fantastically easy, I can't wait to share the recipe.  We followed it with the omission of celery and halved the cayenne pepper.  It still had a bit of a kick without being overpowering.  Served over Zatarain's Rice & Beans (1.5 boxes).  Thanks so much for the great recipe!

Very tasty!  I used turkey sausage so I believe this was fairly healthy!  It was soupy but I just added in a bit of a cornstarch flurry near the end & stirred in the rice that had steamed earlier.  A nice easy twist on jambalaya.  Served with sweet cornbread.

Made this for dinner tonight.  My father and law loved it.  I think it has just the right amount of spice.  I used Trader Joe's andouille chicken sausage.  A nice recipe to have for an easy yummy dinner

Made this for our Saturday lunch at work. Everyone raved about it. I think I will precook the sausages next time to reduce the fat. Great recipe!!

It was okay to me. I felt as though it was a bit bland. I even added some bouillion cubes and extra seasoning to enhance it. I took some over for my friends family and they loved it. So, I'm glad they got to enjoy it.

Fantastic recipe. I just added more cajun seasoning because we like it really spicy.

I absolutely loved this recipe! I'm from New Mexico and grew up eating HOT red and green chile - so I used spicy sausage with jalapeno, and added crushed red pepper, and ground red pepper. I invited my parents over for dinner and THEY LOVED IT! Even my dad, who doesnt usually like anything but Mexican food, loved it! I will use over and over again! Thank You!!!

I did a minor  change I used 3 cups of broth(from b/cubes) but it was wonderful.  I also cooked my chicken and sausage to prior to adding to cut down on the cooking time but it was great!

This recipe was delicious! I did make a few changes. I used green, red, and yellow bell pepper. I also used an entire can of chicken broth (16 oz) because the mixture was fairly thick, and jambalaya is intended to be a soupy texture. I used spicy, chipotle sausage, which added a nice flavor. After it was finished, I poured it over plain white rice. So gooood!

This is remarkably fresh and flavorful coming out of the slow cooker with such little prep. I was really impressed with it, and look forward to it becoming a staple in my house. I followed the given seasoning amounts closely and thought it had a great mild-moderate, "middle of the road" kind of heat - depending on my mood and guests I may up the cajun seasonings and/or cayenne. I also found the meat/sausage/seafood amounts to be good, a little in each bite - often I increase protein in a recipe but it won't be needed in here. Thanks very much for sharing.

The taste of this was great!  However, it did not look much like jambalaya.  Part of the problem was that I couldn't find andouille sausage, so I used hot Italian sausage instead and it basically disintegrated in the slow cooker.  Next time I think I'll use kielbasa, or some other sausage that won't fall apart so easily.  And there will be a next time, because this had a great flavor.

I did not have andouille sausage so I used what I had, which I unfortunately did not add to the flavor.  I also omitted the cayenne because we don't like spicy hot.  Overall it was a good recipe, my 12 year old especially enjoyed it.  I think I'll have to find the andouille or maybe something better than what I used.    I will try this again.

This was very good.  My whole family enjoyed it.  I added some asparagus (cut in one inch pieces)and omitted the shrimp.  I also used turkey kielbasa and threw rice in slow cooker with the rest an hour before dinner.  Lots of flavor for a healthy, low-cal, low cost meal.

This was excellent and easy.  I omitted the peppers, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I put the sausage and chicken in frozen, and they still came out cooked and tender.  Be sure to have a good rice on hand to eat this over.

Wow, I was really impressed!  We all loved this.  Working evenings, I am now forced to feed my family via the slow cooker, and I have not found much that turns out well, but this recipe is every bit as delicious as a stovetop version.   The only thing I changed was substituting crushed tomatoes because I was out of diced, and it worked well.  Top Notch!  Thank you.

This turned out so yummy with just a little bit of kick.  I added some blackbeans I had left over from a previous dinner and used chili pepper powder because thats all I had, also added a tsp of minced garlic.  And I just left the chicken whole to cook until right before adding the shrimp and it was very easy to shred apart in pot. This filled my 5 qt pot to the top but it cooked down.  I added 2 c. cooked brown rice at the end to reduce a little of the soupiness of it. I will still be having lots of left overs even after all my husband ate last night. I will be making this again!

This was really good but I had some problems with cooking time.  I cooked it on high for 4 hours and the veggies were not done, still very very crunchy.  So, I left it alone for another hour and it still wasn't done.  I then transferred it to a pot on the stove and cooked it another 40 mins.  I had some leftover brown rice from the other day, so I added the cooked rice and the shrimp (partially defrosted) to the pot and cooked for another 5 minutes.  The rice helped somewhat with the runniness of the jambalaya, it is runny.  I used smoked turkey sausage instead of andouille because that's all I had.  It was very good and I think the next time, I will cook it all day on low instead of the high method, which didn't work out for me.

Great flavor. I used stewed tomatoes. Very thin even after adding a can of tomato paste but very very good tasting. I did not use shrimp. Also, don't cook but on low for 6 hours or high for 3 hours otherwise the chicken will be tough. Will make again!!

This is requested - almost demanded - at our potlucks at work. We stick with the recipe almost as written. But we add a spoon of minced garlic and use jalapeno instead of cayenne pepper (adjusting the qty of jalapenos to adjust the heat.)

Maybe I'm confused, but I thought Jambalaya was supposed to be thick and not soupy. I ended up draining it in a colander after it was done cooking. Next time I will brown the sausage before adding it, since there was alot of grease in the mixture.  I also added rice during the last half hour to try to absorb the liquid left over. Other than that, it had great flavor.

I followed the recipe to the letter with the thinking that I could always adjust on subsequent batches (seeing that I just invested in the thyme, parsley, cayenne, etc.). I loved it and so did my husband, brother, mom and my kids ages 2 and 5. I don't think that I would change it and loved it runnier for bread dunking. This is a definite repeat!

This jambalaya was very tasty. My boyfriend and I are allergic to seafood so we substituted the shrimp for more sausage. It was a little watery so in the future I would probably use less broth.

DELICIOUS!!  I dedided in the mid afternoon to make a "Mardi Gras" dinner for my family on Fat Tuesday.  Fearing that the meat would not be done by dinner time, I browned and partially cooked the chicken and sausage before adding to the crock-pot.  The flavor of this Jambalaya is perfect!  I will make it again!  Thank you

I made this in our hotel room for Christmas Eve dinner. It was super yummy! Some of the reviews say that jambalaya is supposed to be like a soup, but it's not...I think they are thinking of gumbo...I live in New Oleans...We did spice it up a bit with some hot sauce, but for the children, it was just right!

I was looking for a crockpot recipe to make on a rainy New England weekend and chose this one. I was not disappointed. The flavorful aroma assured me it would be delicious...and it was! I followed the recipe carefully making a few adjustments based on previous comments(thank you). I used boneless chicken thighs and 3 cloves of chopped garlic for more flavor. I drained the can of tomatoes before adding, using only the chicken broth for liquid, figuring I'd add the tomato juice if necessary. It was not. After 3 hours on high it was perfectly done and enjoyed over a scoopful of brown rice. The andouille sausage and seasonings give it just the right amount of heat. Hubby had 2 servings and I had 1 which left a generous serving each for lunch today. Only this morning did I realize I had forgotten the shrimp which are still in the freezer. Can't wait to try again, next time with the shrimp!

This was excellent! My husband lived in New Orleans for 13 years before I dragged him off to the midwest, and even he was impressed by this one. Easy and delicious. Didn't have a bell pepper or celery on hand so I threw frozen soup vegetables into the mix - worked out fine. Made some homemade bread to soak up the extra liquid. Wonderful dinner!

To cut the soupiness, I kept adding teaspoons of corn starch until it was the thickness I wanted.  Also, I used my boyfriend's own version of cajun spice, which was way too spicy for me.  I cut the spiciness by adding 2 tsp of rosemary and an 8oz can of tomato sauce.  Great recipe and very easy to make!!

This recipe was so good and so easy!  I made it pretty much as written.  I added the rice along with the shrimp in the last 30 minutes of cooking.  I added 3 1/2 cups of rice and it was perfect, still juicy but not too juicy.  I will definitely leave out the shrimp next time.  It came out rubbery tasting and was even worse when re-heated.  I will up the chicken and sausage to 1 1/2 pounds a piece.  I will also put 1/2 a teaspoon instead of the full teaspoon of cayenne pepper since my husband found it to be a bit too spicy, which didn't stop him from taking seconds!  I was fine with it as it was but it did have a nice kick.  I also subbed the andouille sausage for nitrate-free unprocessed sweet italian chicken sausage just so that it would be more weight watcher friendly.  I will be making this one again for sure!

Me and my whole family loved this recipe.  My husband's dad makes jambalaya every Christmas but won't share his recipe, this was a very close recipe to his and I will definately be making it many times!!  Neither of my parents have ever had it before and they both absolutely loved it.  The only things I changed was I just didn't add as much green pepper and onion as it said just because of personal preferance.  Then for seasonings I used only the recipe for "Creole Seasoning Blend" found on this site.  Then I mixed the cooked rice in with it before serving it.  Fabulous!!

Yummy...I doubled the amount of Creole/Cajun seasoning and added a couple minced garlic cloves. Just the right amount of spice/flavor...actually, if I wasnt making this for a large crowd I wouldve doubled the cayenne pepper as well! Also added about 4cups of rice to the cooker the last 30min of cooking time and that soaked up every ounce of juice but thats ok, I prefer a slightly drier consistency. Still feel like it needs something else though...next time I am going to add a can of tomato paste or tomato soup or something and I think that will be just right :)

Being from louisiana and living in California, I must rely on my on cooking skills to get the taste that I want.  I used this recipe and its become an instant hit at potlucks, tailgates, and garage junkies football playoffs games. I recommed you try this simple recipe and enjoy the taste of Louisiana cuisine. This recipe has all the flavor and zip you need. Thanks Colleen!!!

Followed the recipe exactly and served over brown rice.  Will cut down on the cayenne next time, as it was pretty spicy.  Overall, a keeper.

We loved this recipe.  I cooked this on the stovetop instead of the crockpot.  It was very good the first day, but even better the next.  This was one leftover that we cleaned up! Great on a chilly day.

Pretty tasty! I added some cooked rice and corn during the last 30 minutes, and used way less red pepper. Worked well in the crock pot.

I was pleasantly supprised how good this turned out. I made this minus a few ingredients so my picky family would have a better chance of liking it. I made it minus the celery, green pepper, shrimp and cayanne pepper and it still turned out very flavorful but not spicy. I added the chicken breast frozen and pulled them out about 30 min before it was done and shredded them up. I also added some rice about 30min before it was done and the rice absorbed all the flavorful juice. The only problem was after I turned off the crock pot when it was perfect the rice kept cooking because of the residual heat. Next time I think I will turn it off just before the rice is done. I will definatly make this again!

Great basic recipe! I added garlic, bay leaves, a little worcestershire and some cooked ham.  I had to use kilbasa. I threw it all in the crock pot with the chicken breasts frozen, just took them out later and cubed them.  I didn't find this spicy at all, so i just tasted and added as I went on.  It turned out great and made enough for an ARMY!

It was wonderful!! Great combination of seasonings. I made the 8 person portion, the only thing was... it only fed two of us. So if you plan to make this for a family, I would double up on portions :) It's THAT GOOD!

Was a bit disappointed after reading all of the positive reviews. This came out more like a stew than Jambalaya. It had a good amount of kick to it but it was  pretty bland overall. Probably will not make again.

Very tasty.  I used Kielbasa sausage instead of andoille to cut back on the grease.  It didn't make as much as I expected, but not bad either.  This was my first time making Jambalaya and I think it turned out great.

Yum!  This one is going into the regular rotation ... finicky husband had THIRDS and then packed up leftovers for lunch today.  As others noted, it definitely was "soupy" even after I drained the tomatoes and decreased the amount of chicken broth. I added several cups of cooked basmati rice (basmati was all we had on hand, but worked fine) to absorb the extra liquid ... the consistency and flavor came out just right.

Initially I went light on the cayenne pepper and cajun seasoning after reading complaints that it was too spicy, but I ended up adding more at the end and the added kick was great.

We did not care for this recipe. Sorry! We found it just hot and not full of flavor. It was a little runny also. I did cook the rice seperately and mix it in the end, but the flavor was just not there.

I made this tonight and while the chicken and sausage tasted good, my husband thought it was too spicy (although I love spicy).  It was also very watery and I just found it too mushy at the end to eat it.  I added it to pasta and it just wasn't a very pleasing meal.  Don't think we will have this again.

This recipe was fabulous.  The only thing I would do is lessen the spice a little bit.  A little too spicy for my husband and father-in-law.

Yum!  I have made this recipe a couple times and it is delicious!  I left out the celery and substituted Old bay seasoning for the cajun seasoning.  I will make this again & again.

I don't know much about jambalaya, but I know that my family and I love this dish! It is so easy and tastes great. I just got my slow cooker six weeks ago, and I have already made it twice! It's a perfect meal for company: just mix in some rice and serve with a salad. Thanks, Colleen!

Very soupy despite draining the tomatoes.  Otherwise I pretty much followed the recipe as written and served over rice.  Needs some tweeking if I make again.  Not really full of flavor, just a bit spicy.

It's a great recipe! I varied a little bit by halfing the shrimp input and subbed with crawfish. I prefer the straight shrimp method.

I made this the other night for Mardi Gras.  I followed the recipe exactly - I might have been a little heavy on the spices as I do 'heavy teaspoons' - and it was AWESOME.  The only thing I did differently was add some frozen okra (I had to open two bags of frozen veggie mix and take out the okra - but now i have veggies for a soup so no waste) I loved it, my sister-in-law who is pregnant said it was awesome and loved the spice, and my husband loved it.  The next night - with the left-overs I just added a small can of diced tomatoes (my hubby had drained the juice the night before??) and added an extra sausage and a few more shrimp.  The first night I had corn bread which rocked.  Last night I asked my husband to pick up a crusty bread and he brought home Potato Rosemary - and it wasn't a good match at all.  But the jambalaya was awesome and the recipe is perfect as is.  I liked the extra sauce for dipping and soaking up corn bread and rice.  I wouldn't even consider giving this to my two little boys because it was making me sweat.  :)

This is very good. I went easy on the cayenne pepper and cajun seasoning since I'm a little sensitive to spice, I still found it a bit hot but everyone else thought it was just about right, not too spicy but still enough kick to make you stop and notice. I put 1 cup of uncooked rice straight into the slow cooker since it was a bit soupy, which brought it to the perfect consistency. my only change was adding a half tsp or so of minced garlic. I would definitely try this again.

Very good meal.  A little too soupy and I also cut the amount of diced tomatoes in half, it was still soupy with the juice from those.  Next time, I think I will drain the juice and see how it goes.  Other than that, very good, very flavorful.  We loved it.  My 3 year old asked for all of the sausage! :)

Great flavor, but like the other posts, I thought it was too runny.  About an hour before we were to eat, I put a bag of saffron rice in and that made it more like a casserole dish.  Unfortunately, I wasn't home during that hour to stir, so the rice wasn't evenly cooked.  We'll be eating the leftovers tonight. As is, I think it is too spicy for my kids.  It's an easy recipe to make adjustments to, so I would definately recommend it!

The is a very tasty recipe.  Although I added a little bit of sugar (about one tsp) just to cut the bitterness from the tomatoes and three tsp vice two tsp of cajun seasoning--only because I wanted it to have more cajun flavor.  The hubby and kids love it!

Super easy to make and it was a big hit all around.  I added about 1 1/2 cups frozen okra to the recipe for some added veggies and thickness.

I made a couple modifications to this great recipe.  First, I used 3T of the Creole Seasoning Blend on this website instead of the spices here.  I also used cajun style sausage and added 1/2 c. rice and uncooked shrimp 30 minutes before it was done as others suggested.  I also only used 1 14.5oz can of diced tomatoes since I didnt read the recipe carefully, which ended up being fine.  In the end, right before serving, I added another 2 c. of cooked rice to the mixture to soak up some of the excess broth.  This was a great recipe though next time I would cut back on the cayenne pepper!

Pretty good recipe. I put it on the day the movers were bringing our stuff. It is nothing if not easy! I didn't have any andouille sausage so I threw in some smoked sausage along with the shrimp the last 30 minutes to heat through. It was spicy so we served over rice with a dollop of sour cream. I'd make it again.

My picky 6-yr-old took one look and said, "I'm not eating that!" But after one taste he was begging for more! My whole family enjoyed this recipe. The only thing I will change next time is I will add the diced chicken about half an hour before serving and the shrimp about 10 minutes before serving so they don't overcook and get tough. 
    This recipe is a keeper!! Thanks!

I thought this jambalaya came out really good.  I'll agree with others, it's a bit soupier than I typically like my jambalaya, but the flavors all melded together so well!  Being a New Orleans girl myself, I had to add a bit of my Zatarains seasoning to add a bit more spice/flavor, and then had the Tabasco on the table to taste.  But in all, it turned out great!  My In-Laws even liked it, and they aren't spicey food eaters!

This was good but a little to spicey for me. Next time I will leave out the chicken and add ham cubes. Also a little more tomato would be nice in it.

We thought it was pretty good, but I messed up at the end.  After reading all the reviews about it being soupy, I added about 3/4 cup of uncooked rice along with my frozen, uncooked shrimp an hour before it was to be done.  The shrimp came out fine and the rice was good then, but we didn't eat it right away and the rice got mushy.  I think next time I'll skip the rice and just serve it over fresh-cooked rice.  Also, I used one can of diced tomoates and one can of diced tomatoes with green chilies.  I think I'll also cut back on the liquid by draining one can next time.

As for it being spicy or not, I didn't realize I was out of cayanne pepper, so mine was very mild -- which was fine for my 17m daughter and me, hubby just added Tapatio to his servings.  I think I'll make it again tho!

I'm not sure how good this would have been had I not made such a huge mistake at the end. I wanted rice IN the dish as opposed to served over it. After the slow cooker was done, I made about 4 cups of rice, when the rice was fully cooked but still steaming... I added it to the slow cooker that was off at this point. I'm a nut. What a mistake.  Rice sucked up all the sauce/juice and the dish was dry. Husband loved it, but he'll eat anything. So here's you warning... don't add hot cooked rice. Flavor was still good... don't skimp on the seasonings.

Very very good recipe! Every one at the table loved it!  It was a little soupy so 1 hour before it was ready I put in 1/2 cup of long grain white rice and cooked until tender. Will definately make this one again!

I tried this dish last night it was good and fairly easy.I do like to cook it on the stove top it is a stronger texture and a heavier consistency,which I prefer, all in all the family liked very little left.

Jambalaya soup is what this recipe is!  I was disappointed and will not make it again.  I give it 3 stars only because it was flavorful.

Made this to bring to a friend's party- we are not fish people so I left out the shrimp and instead used stew beef- came out great and received rave reviews from the group.

This was mediocre. It didn't taste like jambalaya. I am from and live in New Orleans, and the seasoning combination did not taste like jambalaya. Also, I was pretty confused once I realized that it was served over rice instead of cooked together as a flavored rice dish. While it was an ok dish that tasted kind of like spanish rice with meat, I'm going back to the Zateran's mix.

This turned out great.  I added some fresh okra too.  I thought the shrimp got a little tough, next time might try like some others and use uncooked shrimp.

It was ok, but I will not be making it again. It was a little too spicy for my partner, it didn't need the shrimp and I felt it tasted quite bitter at the end - so I added a little sugar. I think this recipe did taste like a Jambalaya but it needs adjusting to suit individual taste.

this was sooooo delicious!!!
i didnt cook it in the crock pot cause i needed it to be ready to eat within 2 hours, so i didnt have the time for slow cooking.  i am sure it would have blended the flavors even better.
other than that the only other difference was that i added garlic, and used chopped left over ham instead of sausage.  
this was so good it was all gone on the second day!

This was a good recipe, but it seemed to be missing something.  I think next time I will add some Old Bay seasoning and try to thicken up the sauce...

my husband and i were delighted with this recipe.  the spices were well balanced.  nothing was overpowering.  we were a little worried that we'd come home to a dish that wasn't good with no backup plan in mind.  good thing it was delicious.  thanks!

This had very good flavor, but I made the mistake of putting the rice in at the beginning, and it turned to mush.  Next time, I will add the cooked rice with the shrimp at the end of cooking.

It was okay.  It wasn't as thick as I thought it should be and it was missing an important ingredient - okra!  When I make jambalaya again I probably won't use this recipe.

Really good...want to figure out how to add the rice to the slow cooker.  The flavor was great and the spice not too hot.  Might add okra next time.

My boyfriend loved this!  I think he ate three helpings.  I like it spicy, so I added a teaspoon of Cajun seasoning.  I also added a small can of tomatoe paste like some of the other reviews suggested so it wasn't as soupy.  Was very easy and very good.

This was really easy. I ended up making it on the stove. I took the advice of a few others and added a 1 1/2 cups rice to the mixes for the last portion to save on cleanup and be a little more traditional. I added some Creole seasoning and more parsley. I didn't use as much cayenne since my audience are a little "heat" sensative. But it was excellent and I will definatley make it again. Thanks so much for sharing!

Although this was ok, it just wasn't 'rock my socks' good.  I had to do lots of doctoring...added some tomato paste to thicken it, lots more spices - cajun, creole, chipolte tabasco, garlic, onion, extra cayenne- it still didn't have the intense flavor that I associate with good jambalaya.  I cooked the rice in the crock pot like other reviewers and added extra spices to compensate, but it was still bland for me.

This is a wonderful "fix it & forget it" recipe. Followed it exactly and it came out great. Good flavor, good texture and the entire house smelled good from it cooking all day long. This one's a definite keeper!

I loved how simple this recipe was however I did find it too soupy.  I added a can of tomato paste about half way through cooking which helped but it still seemed very watery. That aside, it tasted great and the kids seemed to like it as well.

This was really good & easy to make.  There is a little bit of a kick to it from the cayenne pepper, but my husband & I both loved it.  It would be great in the winter with fresh bread or corn bread.

I was looking for new ideas for using the slow cooker and this one sounded intriguing so I gave it a try. Overall, I was very satisfied with the result, although I did make some minor tweaks. Since I'm not a fan of shrimp, I ended up using about two pounds of chicken (boneless thighs). I withheld the teaspoon of cayenne since I was concerned about it being too spicy for my two kids (I felt level of spiciness was still satisfactory). I also added one bay leaf.

A number of reviewers remarked that it was too "soupy". I would agree, but this is easily correctable. Draining the excess juice from the can of diced tomatoes would be a start (I forgot to do this with mine). Also, and more importantly, adding in some cooked rice shortly before serving will help absorb most of the liquid. Rice mixed into the dish is also more typical of the jambalaya I'm familiar with as opposed to pouring the stock over it at serving time. I found that 4-5 cups worth (after cooking) seems to be about the proper ratio. My biggest mistake was leaving the rice in far too long (over an hour) which turned it into mush. 15 minutes should be plenty. This is a very tasty and easy to make dish and I'm confident my next batch will be even better.

Both my husband & I loves this recipe!  Of course, he would've liked it to be more spicy but it was just right for me.  Spicy but not too spicy to where I couldn't enjoy the food.  We have a big rice cooker (one we bought at an Asian market) that steams the rice and we just cooked that and served the jambalaya over it.  So this recipe is definitely a keeper!!!  Thanks!!!

This recipe was great- just the right amount of spice and all of the flavors blended well together.  My husband who is sometimes a picky eater loved this dish.  The only change I made was to use chicken sausage and brown rice.  Thanks for the great recipe

This was pretty good even though it was a bit soupy.And no,I didn't add the rice and water to this,I cooked the rice seperately.I couldn't find andouille sausage,the local butcher never even heard of it.He suggested that I use a spicy italian sausage.As for spiciness I thought it was a bit tame.My parents were over and I let them try it too.If it had been too spicy they never would've eaten it but they thought it was good too.I'll be making this again but not too soon,the cost of all the ingredients makes it a bit pricey for my meager wallet.I'd like to make this a bit more spicy too.

My husband and I both liked this.  It was good to eat on a cold winter's night.  I used venison kielbassa, but next time I will add more spice, and I'll add rice right to the slow cooker. It was easy to make and enjoyable to eat.

A keeper in my household.  I am always looking for a time saving recipe and this one has just been added to my list.  The flavor was perfect blend of "heat" for my taste and although the consistency could have been just a bit thicker, I loved it just the same.  I served this over rice with a salad and it made a perfect dinner for a cold winter's night.

Excellent!  Everyone loved this.  We had it with a choice of brown or white rice.

For the leftovers, I cooked it down a little more to thicken it, and had it over whole wheat pasta.

Also, the recipe itself is has just the right heat for everyone.  Those of us who wanted it spicier just added tobasco  .

The flavor was great.  A little too much heat for us.  We will definitely make it again but will cut the cayenne in half (at least!)  I stirred two cups of instant rice in at the end and it turned out great!

Very good and not too spicy.  I used regular Italian Hot Sausage, rather than the andouille, so that may have affected the heat.

This was fabulous!  I am always looking for recipes where I can use frozen meat instead of having to remember to thaw things out. :)  The only changes I made were to omit the shrimp (I didn't have any handy), and I put about 4-5 frozen, boneless, skinless chicken thighs on the top of the rest of the ingredients.  I also took the lid off for about an hour to let things thicken up a bit.  All my family could say was YUMMM!!

This was really good. The prep work (all that chopping!) took a bit of time, but it was simple after that. I used both spicy and mild italian sausage and both were really good. Will definitely make again.
