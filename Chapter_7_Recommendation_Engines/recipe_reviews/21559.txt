I liked this a lot although port is rather a strong flavor. Kid visitors didn't like it. I think I might substitute orange juice just to see what it tastes like.

We thought the flavor was delicious. Since alcohol is a concern in our home, I subbed the port wine with orange juice-with great results. Since I was only making one squash, I had quite a bit left over.  I continued cooking down the remaining sauce with a bit more OJ until I had a sort of 'fruit filling' that I then stirred into a basic yellow cake batter. It was a wonderfully moist and delicous cake!

This was a good recipe for a first-time acorn squash audience.  The port that I used was really potent, so I think that kids would have been turned off by the taste, but my guests liked it a lot.

Three distinct tastes that didn't meld, and didn't go well together: Squash, cranberry sauce, dessert wine (port/marsala, etc).  Even the vegan son-in-law didn't like it.

This is a sweet and easy way to enjoy acorn squash! I made mine using Golden Acorn Squash, which I think adds a nice background to the bright sauce.
I will definitely make this again.
