This was really good and great for a quick weeknight dinner! I made some changes due to what I had on hand: I used a can of cream of mushroom soup instead of the condensed broccoli cheese soup.  I omitted the can of mushrooms and added four ounces American cheese.  This is a great recipe that used ingredients I always have in my pantry and freezer!

I made this tonight and everyone enjoyed it greatly! It will be on my meal list for leftover ham. I didn't have the broccoli and cheese soup, so subbed cream of mushroom and about 1 cup of grated cheese. Both of my picky eaters demolished it!

I made this recipes because I had some leftover ham.  The only thing I changed was using cheddar cheese condensed soup instead of the broccoli cheese.  The added mustard gave it a nice flavor.

I made this exactly as written. I like easy recipes and this one fit the bill. I usually make something and eat it every day until it’s gone. It made enough to last me most of the week.Great!

They only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because it needs more cheese. I added l some Velveeta and it was perfect.

I did not add any extra salt because the broccoli cheese soup already has a lot in it -- and it was excellent.  My husband and I really enjoyed it.
