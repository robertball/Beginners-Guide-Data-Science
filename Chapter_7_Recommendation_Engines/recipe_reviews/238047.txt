Awesome salad. Dressing is good  but I didn’t put all of it on...it wasn’t. Necessary.  Will definitely make this again!

Just what i was looking for! for the dressing i omitted fish sauce and brown sugar and just did a splash of lime juice since the mangoes i had were sweet and ripe:) Thanks!

This took me by surprise.  It is good, but I don't know if it is the fish sauce or what that really makes it taste like something you like, but can't eat much of.  The texture of it feel strange in the mouth.  Keeping it in my recipe box, but don't think I could have this more than maybe once or twice a year.

Lovely fresh salad. Flavours balanced nicely. I think the fish sauce was too strong so I would only use half the amount called for next time and add more red pepper. Thanks for sharing abcgirl
