While the recipe I've used for many years goes by a different name, it varies only in that it calls for 1-1/2 cups of milk chocolate chips (which I prefer) rather than the semi-sweet. This is a real crowd pleaser for those who like their sweet treats rich, gooey and decadent and is easily put together with pantry ingredients likely already at hand. Once the bars are firm, there is no need to keep them refrigerated.

These were so very easy to make.  And they were yummy to eat!  Just a suggestion to make it easier though...I would melt the chocolate and butter before adding the peanut butter.  This way you are less likely to burn it and the stirring will be easier.  I gave this recipe a 5 and I hardly EVER give out 5's!

Oh so yummy!!  FYI:  Make sure you let the marshmallow and brownie cool before spreading on the chocolate mixture.  I didn't and ended up with a gooey mess.  Still a delicious, rich dessert.  I would think it'd be even better warm.

These are incredibly good!  A friend of mine in college used to make these frequently.  I only had large marshmallows on hand, so I used those and just cut them into quarters using kitchen scissors.

Wow! These were awesome. I only had large marshmallows so I quartered them. Also, I put the brownies in the fridge for a little bit before I made the topping and it was so easy to spread. To serve I but them into small squares since they are very rich. Everyone LOVED them!

I thought these were pretty tasty, although the topping is kind of hard to spread over the marshmallows, even after they are cooled

I would give this 100 stars if I could.  Seriously.  I made these as a treat for my husband yesterday, and while I am a good baker and tend to experiment with a new dessert once a week, I've never gotten a reaction like this--not in 15 years!! Hubby took one bite, groaned in ecstasy, took another bite and told me that this was the best thing he had ever eaten EVER.  Then he promptly scarfed a second bar.  WOW.  The only thing I changed was to use my own fudge-brownie recipe instead of a mix, and to sub Smart Balance Light for the butter.  I used Nestle's new Dark Chocolate Chips and Krema smooth peanut butter, both of which I adore.  A word to those with less resilient stomachs than my husband's--these things are reeeeeally rich.  I cut them into small squares and ate only one, and I could still feel it in my stomach hours later.  As delicious as they are, one small bar is more than enough!  Thank you thank you thank you to the creator of the recipe for this wonderfully simple and amazing treat!  I know I will be baking these for years to come.

This is the easiest dressed-up-brownie experience ever. I melted one package (12 oz) of Nestle Semisweet chocolate chips (the smoothest melting chocolate chips I've ever found) in the microwave, then mixed the peanut butter and butter in til melted, then gradually added the rice cereal. The recipes calls for the brownies to be baked longer than I like to bake mine, and I altered that, but I realize that it creates a crunchier brownie, which makes a really nice base crust for the rest. It works with softer brownie too though. My coworkers devoured this!!!

These are rich and delicious. I shortened the cooking time because I used a gluten-free brownie mix that would have burned otherwise. I also used marshmallow fluff instead of marshmallows to make this vegetarian. Was a little messy spreading it on, but the results turned out beautifully.

Most important TIP: let the marshmallows cool before pouring the chocolate mixture on! If the marshmallows are warm you cannot spread the thick chocolate layer very easily and they will not be pretty. 2 Tip: Cook your brownies however you like them...fudge-like (my kind), cake-like, crunchy...it is whatever makes YOU happy. 3 Tip: If you like more of a creamy marshmallow layer use marshmallow cream. If you like more of a soft chewy layer (my preference) use reg marshmallows. EVERYONE loved these and they were super easy! I refrigerated mine for 2-3 hours and had no problem cutting them strait out of the fridge. The fudge brownie, chewy marshmallow, and crunchy top remind me of the different textures you find in candy bars...yum! My large family loves sweets so we had no problem finishing them off. They are sweet, but isn't that the point :o) Enjoy!!

I found this recipe on another site and made it this week. My family raved about them. The only difference was that my recipe called for milk chocolate chips so that's what I used. (Normally, I just buy semi-sweet chips so I had to run to the store to get the milk chocolate ones. I'm glad I did.) I thought these were pretty good chilled, but have since discovered they are OUT OF THIS WORLD delish when you zap each square in the microwave before gobbling it down.  The brownie is warm and soft and the marshmallow is ooey and gooey. OMG!  The diet will have to start later.

Simple and so delicious!  Very rich, though; you'll want to serve small pieces.  And the chocolate topping melts at room temperature.

I would like to give this more stars but it is just too sweet.  I am a candy finatic and these were still too much for me.  I think they might be improved by cutting the top layer in half so there is just a thin layer.  Thanks for the recipe though.

Oh my goodness - I've died and gone to dessert heaven!!! These bars are the best,so easy to make but makes it look like you're the best cook ever. I cut them into little squares - got about 60 out of a 13 x 9 pan. That way they don't get too sickly. However, since I keep wanting to go back and get more............ :) These will get me the best bosses wife award for sure when my husband takes them into work.

Loved these. I used Ghiradelli double chocolate brownie mix. Baked it in a 9 x 13 glass pan for 28 minutes before topping with marshmallows. Let cool before adding topping. People kept coming back for more! A new favorite!

Great brownie...very rich. These brownies tasted much better at room temperature than right from the fridge.  At room temp, the chocolate was a little bit gooey...out of the fridge, it was more like a candy. Either way...tasted great!  I might have added a little more peanut butter, but followed the recipe.  This recipe is a keeper!

Given the reviews of this being a bit on the sweet side, and the fact that I'm not an enormous fan of marshmallows, I only used half the amount, and it was perfect. I also decreased the amount of chocolate, and next time I plan on adding more cereal than called for. They were super delicious.

Outstanding and Easy. I took some to the office and they begged for more and my grandchildren fought over them.  You can't go wrong with peanut butter/chocolate/marshmallows. The crunch of the rice cereal made it like a candy bar. Make sure you don't cut these too big as they are rich. Refrigerate until set but cut before getting too hard as the topping gets thick and hard to cut.  They will disappear fast.

I love these bars!  A girl at church brings these to functions often but will never share the recipe (yeah, I know).  Now I've found it for myself and can enjoy them anytime I like!  They are quick and easy.

Great twist on the regular brownie. Made them last night for when company came over. They are very rich so small pieces are best then you don't feel overwhelmed...lol. I didn't have marshmallows but had 2 jars of fluff so I microwaved those for a few seconds and spread onto the brownies, did put in the oven to make sure i could spread the rest evenly. I also upped the crispy cereal to 2 cups. I also didn't use boxed brownies since I didn't have any so I made Brooke's best bombshell brownies for this.

Loved the chewy/crunchy texture to these bars! I did notice that they were better if left in the fridge, otherwise they tend to be messy.

Thank goodness I found this recipe again!!! I made these back in January for my 11 YO daughters soccer team sleepover.  Kids and parents alike loved them and all said they are the best they have ever tasted.  No one could eat just 1.  Now my 13 YO is requesting them for her birthday party instead of a cake and I couldn't find the recipe I printed now they are saved in my recipe box.

These were not very good to me. The marshmallow layer was too 'tough' (after being in the fridge for 2 hours to firm up the chocolate/PB layer) and the chocolate/peanut butter/Rice Krispy layer had a strange texture that was very unappetizing... and very messy to eat. I will not try to make this again.

Very good and very rich.  Brought to a party and everyone loved.  I chilled the brownies w/marshmallows before spreading the chocolate mixture (to which I added extra rice krispies to cut the richness a bit and would do the same again), then chilled the entire pan for at least a couple hours before cutting.  Only downside is that they are hard to cut, but the taste makes up for it.

Awesome!  I used a mixed bag of peanut butter and milk chocolate chips instead of the semi-sweet which my husband does not like.  This was so yummy!!  I have already decided to make this to carry to a Christmas party.

If you let the brownies cool completely, you can spread a jar of marshmallow creme over that layer. I put a few chopped walnuts on top of that. Let that cool in the fridge, while making the chocolate/peanut butter/cereal mixture. I had no crisp rice, so used Kashi. They were GREAT!

OMG these were to die for! Sweet as anything, but man my itch was scratched! I used the Best Brownies recipe from this site, along with carob chips in lieu of chocolate...perfection! I also melted the PB with the butter first for about 35 seconds in the microwave, stirring after about 15, and then stirred in the chips and folded in the cereal. Yum!

These have become the go-to dessert in our household!  Everywhere we bring them, we're asked for the recipe.  I follow the recipe exactly and always refrigerate for at least two hours if not more.  They definitely taste best at room temperature though so take them out of the refrigerator in plenty of time.  I find that most people don't need a huge serving at first but will come back for more later so plan accordingly!

Absolutely Delish! They were a huge hit at home and my husband took some into work and they were demolished. I recommend cutting them into 2 to 3 bite size pieces because they are very rich and decadent. Thank so much for helping me look like a great cook!

I received a recipe similar to this one while teaching.  The mother of child who brought in this treat for his birthday, brought in a second batch for all the teachers and staff the following day with a copy of the recipe.  I misplaced my recipe during a move, but found this.  I use marshmallow fluff instead of miniature mallows and get requests for this recipe everytime I bring it in to share!  It's a favorite at work and among my co-workers' families.

These are fabulous.  I found this recipe on the Betty Crocker website and the only difference I can see is that instead of marshmallows, I used vanilla frosting.  I have had some similar with marshmallows and the frosting is much better!  It stays very moist and I highly recommend it instead of the marshmallows.  The rice krispies get a little stale after day 3, but they really shouldn't have lasted long.  I took them to a bunch of dieting women!!

Yum!! These are great. The only change I made was that I used semi-dark chocolate chips because that's all I had in the pantry. I cut them in small squares because they're very rich, but I keep going back for "just one more!"

I'm always looking for something a little different, yet quick and easy, to bring to church functions. These went over wonderfully! Not a crumb left. And plenty of room in the recipe to utilize what's in the pantry.

These were well loved by family and friends but we all agree they are so rich they are like eating candy.  Even though I cut them very small, it is like eating a piece of fudge at the holidays.  I will make them to include in my holiday bakegoods but go back to "plain ol' brownies" for something sweet after meals.

These are addictive!!!  They are soooo easy and quick to make.  I love the marshmellow middle!!  They are also versatile in the way you can make the topping.  I followed the recipe to a t and they were great but you could change them up with adding cherry bits, nuts, heath bar bits, etc.  Several people at the office asked for the recipe.  Thank you for this delicious treat!

These are a true 4 star - good but not perfect because they are veeerrry sweet.  I didn't love them at first, but they grew on me.  Good in very small squares, so a 9 x 13 pan makes lots of them.  My husband and I both liked them, but weren't raving about them.  Good for a bake sale because they look delicious! Kids would probably love them, too.  Soft and chewy, even when refridgerated.

There  is nothing not to like about these bars. Easy to make and everyone enjoyed them. I used peanut butter/milk chocolate swirl chips and they worked really well. Next time I think I'll add some coconut and maybe chopped peanuts.

I made these once and forgot the rice crispies because I was tending to my daughter.  You MUST remember the cereal, or it will not be anything like it's supposed to be.  Still tasted good though. :)

AMAZING! A gal described this recipe was what she was bringing to a playdate and we were all sooo scared to taste it (it usually doesn't turn out too pretty when we make it). It was gone in SECONDS. Now, we save it for special occasions to save our waist and bottoms. It DOES need to be in the fridge for awhile. It melts down quickly so you want it to set. THANKS for posting!!!

I made these in a 10x15 bar pan, turned out great!  Much better cold and must be in order to cut.  I also froze some to enjoy later and they were just as wonderful as the day I made them.  I may add a smidge more peanut butter next time.

These were extremely sweet. I took them to an office function and half were left (and normally my office eats everything up) If you serve them, make sure they're at room temperature. Otherwise they're way too hard to eat. I think next time I'll leave out the marshmallow and add more peanut butter. All in all, I thought they were just okay.

Very good idea! I made a change though-- I used a can of chocolate frosting instead of the chocolate chips and butter. It worked very well and tasted amazing. Thanks!

I made this for a potluck and let the kids sample it before I left.  Their response "Why don't you ever make us good stuff like this!"

the top two layers are DELICIOUS!  i don't think the bottom brownie layer is particularly good partly due to the fact that the cooking time is perhaps too long.  nearly 30 mins on this thin of a crust makes it hard and nearly unpalatable.

Talk about sugar overload! Definitely for anyone with a sweet tooth. Good flavor though, and I'm sure kids would love them. I didn't have any semisweet chips, so I used 1 cup of peanut butter/chocolate swirl chips and about 2 T. of cocoa powder and this worked well. This is one of those foods that tastes even better the next day.

These were wonderful! I used a Ghiradelli brownie mix and they were perfectly moist. They were even better than when I've made the brownie layer from scratch. Thanks for the recipe!

I made the recipe exactly as it was written. Wonderful! The brownies were a little dry so next time I'll use a high-quality mix such as Ghirardelli.

My friends called these "Orgasmic Brownies" They were a hit! A bit too rich for me, but others loved them. Easy to make.

I didn't make this exact recipe, mine has the brownie bottom made from scratch, but the other ingredients are the same.  I also used Cadbury bars for the top.  Everyone who has tried them loves them.  I made them last Christmas, and they were a big hit, so I made them again this year.  They're definately worth trying.
