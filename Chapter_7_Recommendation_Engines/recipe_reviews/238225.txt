This dish was very tasty!  I will be making this again and possibly bringing to others when they need a home-cooked meal delivered.   My son who dislikes chicken even ate it!  I have a large family so I used 3 breasts, split horizontally to make 6 pieces.  I also doubled the rice and water.  It filled my 9x13 pan nicely and I still had plenty of the mayo mixture to evenly coat the chicken breasts and then some!  Everyone in my family loved the mayo mix and parmesan on the chicken.  I found 1/2 cup of the parmesan was more than enough.   I didn't have fresh rosemary so used about 2+ teaspoons dried rosemary.  I only had brown rice on hand, so used that, but consequently the rice was not done by the time the chicken was.  Not the recipe's fault as brown rice takes longer to cook and I should have considered that.  Next time I will either use white rice or I will just bake the brown rice for a while until half cooked, then add the chicken and bake for another 45 minutes.  Also, I added frozen peas to the rice mixture.  I really liked the extra color and taste the peas added to the dish.  I felt like it rounded out the meal and added extra nutrition.  This dish would be great served with some homemade rolls!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! I had to trick my boyfriend into eating it at first because I knew he wouldn’t think the mayo sounded good, and he loved it too. Now he asks for it quite often. I started using chicken broth instead of water to give the rice more flavor, and cook the rice and broth about 15 minutes by itself before adding the chicken to it. Comes out perfect every time.

When I finished putting this together I was very leery about it working out.  How could something so easy be good?  The only change I made was to use dried basil instead of Rosemary since that's what I had on hand.  I also doubled the rice and water because my kids eat a lot of rice.  You end up with moist chicken, fluffy rice and delicious sauce, with only one pan to clean.  What more could you ask for?  My husband and triplet 15 year olds loved it and asked if I could make it again, soon!  One more thing, my husband doesn't like mayonnaise so I made sure not to tell him the main ingredient.  Shhhhh!

This is a super hit!! Easy to make. I’m glad I used fresh rosemary chopped fine. Would recommend doubling up on the rice portion and adding a little extra water if using jasmine rice. I served it with a side of cooked frozen peas. Totally made the meal balanced.

I made the (white) rice separately to be sure it got done.  I added chicken flavored "Better than bouillon" to the water.  I baked the chicken according to directions except I didn't have any rosemary and I covered the chicken on both sides with the mayo mixture because I had plenty.  When the chicken was done there was a lot of liquid in the pan so I just dumped the rice in and mixed it with the liquid because the rice was thick and dry.  Three grown men said it was the best rice they ever had!  The chicken was good too.  Will def make again but will probably make the (precooked) rice along with the chicken.

The flavor was good and it was definitely easy, but my rice did not cook in 35 minutes.  After adding 15 minutes it was still a little crunchy but edible.  I used regular white uncooked rice but maybe using parboiled and hot water would have helped.

I posted the photo of the recipe, just figured this delicious recipe isn't getting the attention that it deserves. I wanted something quick and simple but yet tasteful to make for supper last night and I usually don't make a recipe that doesn't have a photo but this sounded absolutely delicious and had to make it without there being a photo, deciding to add one of my own. 
Instead of using rice, since I didn't have any, I used Couscous. I cooked it and then I also added some onion powder and parsley flakes in with the Mayo for the Mayo I used Mayo with/Olive Oil...might I say that turned out delicious. Will definitely be making this little dish again. :)

I'm not a rice lover, so just did the chicken and served it w/Knorr's pasta.  Duke's mayo gives it a nice flavor and keeps it moist.

Made this tonight - used fresh rosemary and probably finely chopped about 2 tbsp - I used a little bit more mayo - and would definitely use more rice if making this for more than 2 people.   Coated the whole top with the Parmesan - turned out great.

DEFINITELY either cook the rice first or cover the dish for the first 30 minutes. At 40 minutes the chicken was cooked but the rice was not. I added a little more water and put a lid on for another ten minutes in the oven.

Great Flavor ! I used half sour cream half Mayo instead and Added Chopped onion and broccoli to the rice.  Be sure to cover all the rice with chicken or sauce to prevent some of the rice from getting dry and crunchy.

I used chicken broth instead of water and it flavored the rice nicely. I also stirred the rice midway through, so good. my husband and I were very surprised. this will be a regular at our home. Wow!

Just needed more water over the rice, I might par cook it first and prep everything else before I put it in the oven, and then add the parmesan cheese at the end.  But the husband and I love it, just need to tweak a few things

Looks bland but is surprisingly flavorful! On advice of others I increased rice and liquid to 1 1/2 cups, using bouillon powder in boiling water for flavor. Since I was using chicken tenders I started the rice 10 minutes before topping with the chicken, mayo topping, and parmesan.  Next time I may try a little parsley in the rice for some color. Easy and yummy!

This turned out great!  I would make it again and again.  After reading the reviews, I decided to use two cups of rice instead of one.  I didn't have quite enough white rice so I went with brown instead.  Again, based on the reviews, I cooked the rice on its own to give it a head start before adding it to the casserole dish.  I believe it simmered for about 25 minutes.  I substituted chicken broth for one cup of the water the rice was cooking in, and added some "chicken seasoning" to it as it simmered.  The rice alone had so much flavor!  I layered the rice in the casserole dish first, then the boneless chicken thighs which I mistakenly thought were chicken breasts!  I then spread the mayo mixture all over the chicken and baked it all for the recommended time.  The Parmesan on top was just the final touch it needed.  Rave reviews from all of my "recipe testers."

Super quick and  delicious. The mayonnaise adds a wonderful tangy taste.
