This is the best bread in the world and so versatile.  I have made it with all wheat flour when I ran out of all-purpose.  I have used sugar substitute for my diabetic mom.  I have added oats, wheat germ, flax seed, grape nuts, and walnuts and raisin to make a breakfast bread.  We bake this daily and use it for everything.  We make sandwiches with it, toast it,or eat it plain. It is great sliced thick with soup, chowder, or stew.  One of our favorite things to do is to roast it in the oven with garlic butter for a side with pasta, then we cut the left overs up into cubes, roast them again and use them in meatloaf or stuffing or on salads.  I don't eat butter so i like to toast or roast this bread and then dip it in seasoned olive oil.  Yumm! It is addicting.  Not only is this bread delicious but it is sooo easy to whip up.  No one in my family thinks twice about it. Everyone over the age of 10 has the recipe memorized. I take this to any meal I go to and have given this recipe out at least a dozen times. Thank you for a delicious, easy, healthy recipe.

Buttermilk is hard to come by sometimes....especially when a recipie calls for it.  I substituted 1 cup buttermilk for 1 tbsp of white vinigar and then adding milk to equal 1 cup.  I did this four times.  My grandmother offered the substitute, she says homoginized milk is the best to use when substituting, I only had skim and it turned out fine.

Great recipe! To make it more moist, I like to substitute half a cup or more of molasses for half a cup of brown sugar.  Usually we have it with baked beans, but if we're having it for tea or for breakfast, I add raisins.

I read all the reviews before making this. Everyone enjoyed it smothered in butter, but there was an aftertaste of baking soda, if you just ate the bread alone. I'm thinking of adding spices (cinnamon, ginger, cloves and nutmeg) next time....

Just took this out of the oven a few minutes ago and we have eaten half of it already (but I have 7 children to feed).... just caught my 2 year old sharing with her 6 month old sister.  

I have been on the lookout for a new way to use my wheat and this is a perfect bread for anytime of day: breakfast, snack or dinner.  Instead of buttermilk, I substituted sour milk (add 1Tb vineagar for each cup of milk) .  I might use just 3/4C brown sugar next time and add some chopped dates or raisins.

Thanks for a great recipe!

I made it last night and it came out great!  My family looked at me after the first bite and said "It's a keeper!"  It definitely is.  This is probably one of the easiest breads I've ever made and I'm very happy with the results.  Thanks for the recipe!

Really, really good.  Followed the recipe exactly and while it's rather dense (but so is banana or other quick breads) this had a healthy yet sweet taste that my whole family liked.  This bread is a cross between a whole wheat bread and a sweet bread.  It was quick and easy to make.  I will be making this again and again.

I am allergic to yeast, so I have been trying recipes for a bread that I can eat but also that my family likes.  This is the best so far.  I only had one loaf pan, so I halved the recipe.  I can't have buttermilk so I used 2% with a tablespoon of lemon juice for each cup and let it sit for a while.  Baked at 350* for 45 min.s not 1 hour.  It turned out perfectly.  It is a recipe that could be changed by the amount of sugar and spices added.  I think I will try it with nuts and cinnamon next time.

Very good. I added a cup of multi-grain oats and about 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract, simply because we had them in the pantry and I was waiting for the oven to finish heating. I think the oats gave it a really good texture. I will definitely be making this bread again, and maybe experimenting a bit more with it.

A fantastic bread. Dense and not at all too sweet; this is perfect with some butter and/or jam and a cuppa tea. (The bread is quite tasty on its own, too, without any type of spread.) Definitely not a sandwich bread, but a great bread for breakfast. I followed the recipe exactly and found that I pretty much needed the whole hour to bake the bread. The top gets pretty brown, though, so I did a few knife-tests to make sure I still had to let the middle set (I did). 

The best part about this recipe is that it was EASY to make the bread--no mixers, no taking butter out of the fridge an hour before to soften, no creaming of anything together. Just throw it all in a bowl and mix it up, then bake! Clean-up was a breeze, too.

Great Recipe. I also used 1tbsp vinegar in each 1 cup of milk as a substitute for buttermilk and it turned out really well. Besides this I also added crushed almonds on the top that made it very delicious.

Absolutely delicious!  I bake a lot of bread and this is would be one of my favorites even if it weren't so darned easy and quick.  I took one person's advice and substituted 1/2 cup molasses for 1/2 cup of the brown sugar.  It came out moist & beautifully textured.  This is a Keeper!

Was going to half the recipe, but decided to make the two loaves. Glad I did! This is a great recipe exactly the way it's written. I used my big mixer with the dough hook and the speed on 2. Perfect texture, crust and taste.

I use powdered buttermilk mix (found in the baking aisle), so I always have all the ingredients on hand.  This is so fast and so yummy.  And it's whole grain...a healthier option for a starch side at dinnertime.  Thank you for the recipe!

Love this recipe.  For the steamed taste of traditional Brown Bread while the bread is still warm, I place it in a gallon size plastic bag to let it "steam".  Family really loves it.  You can double the sugar and add raisins, dates or nuts to make a healthier quick bread.  Love the fact that it does not have eggs or any other fat because hubby needs to have recipes lower in fat.  Many thanks for posting the recipe Annette!!

That was easy!!!!  The leavening is the soda reacting with the buttermilk.  It is important to mix this just until the dry ingredients are incorporated.  Get the batter in the pans and in the oven for best results.  Next time I might cut the sugar in half to get a more savory bread, though this was excellent and easy just as is!!

This was easy and helped me use up some sour milk without needing to add butter and eggs, which was nice. It cooked well and was very sweet-good for eating by itself, but it doesn't really go with meals. Also, my husband complained that he could taste the bitter baking soda on the second day :P

Excellent recipe. I didn't have whole wheat flour so I substituted all all-purpose flour instead. It turned out great, even though I used 1 cup sour milk (1 tbsp vinegar in a liquid measuring cup, filled to the 1-cup line with milk) for each cup of buttermilk. I even used skim milk. For one of the loaves, I replaced 2/3 cup of flour with All-Bran cereal, and added cinnamon, vanilla, nutmeg and ground ginger. It was nice, kind of like a fat-free bran muffin. Such a simple and easy recipe on which you can base all kinds of different quick breads! Best of all, it's virtually fat free and has no eggs. I made it for breakfast this morning because I ran out of store-bought bread and eggs, but I will definitely make this again.

Despite the word "sweet" in the descriptor line, I did not expect this to be as sweet as it is. It is rather tasty - next time I'll cut some of the sugar and try for a more savory version. As is, this was a great tea bread with honey butter, or jam, or made into a decadant french toast.

I made this early this morning because I realized that we were out of bread AFTER my husband left for work. Drrr.

I didn't have buttermilk, so I did the old vinegar and whole milk trick. This bread terrifically simple and really didn't take a whole lot of thought on my part. (This recipe is great for Mom's who haven't had their coffee yet and are 
trying to juggle kids and breakfast.) It
was easy enough to put in the oven with 
the Peach Cobbler Bread I made and they
both were done about the same time.

Dense bread but super yummy. I didn't need the whole hour, seems to me that it really only took about 45 minutes in my oven and it was done. I'd like to try it with half molasses next time and see if that makes it even better. I didn't get a picture of it because we played outside until lunch and by the time I made lunch, my kids and I were ready to eat. When I remembered to take a picture, the loaf was half demolished!
I had a slice with natural chunky peanut butter and my kids ate it with butter. 

This is going in my "must make again" recipe pile. Really a nice easy bread recipe when you find you've run out and forgotten to buy more!

EDITED TO ADD LATER THE SAME DAY: I used the remaining half of this loaf in the 
Garlic Bread Fantastique. So. Good. My
whole family liked this bread so much that I made another one after dinner. This one's a keeper.

EDITED TO ADD AGAIN 08/19/08: Made this again tonight. Goes really well with Christmas Eve Beef Stew from this site.

I actually like that this recipe, as stated, makes two loaves of bread because it gave me an opportunity to makes it as stated, then alter the second loaf.  The original version is pretty tasty -  a slightly sweet whole wheat bread.  I suggest testing for doneness at about 50 minutes - at 55 mine were a bit darker than I would have liked, but fortunately the bread was still moist.  It was good warm, but even better toasted the next day with some butter and jam.  I could see this beinf used as a sandwich bread for maybe chicken salad, especially the fruited kind, but it is definitely sweeter that regular whole wheat bread.  To the second loaf, I added a heaping tbsp of honey, same amount of wheat germ, some cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves, and some chopped dried prunes and raisins to make it more of a quick bread.  I like the fruited version better, but still found the original to be enjoyable.

This is a very simple bread to make, with very nice results!

ps - I substituted sour milk for buttermilk and it turned out fine.

Fabulous simple brown bread recipe, works every time and kids love it. To make it more of an Irish soda bread, reduce the sugar to 1tsp, but we like it sweet! If you don't have buttermilk, just use lemon juice or vinegar (measure a tablespoon in a cup measure, fill with milk, repeat x4) :)

I was not really impressd with this bread. It was heavy with dry crumb and very little taste. I'm not going to be making it again.

What a wonderful, easy bread!  My whole family loved it and they don't usually like wheat breads!  I did the recipe as is except I never buy buttermilk; I do the lemon juice with milk substitution.  I will DEFINITELY make this bread again.  Thanks ANNETTE1951 for a terrific recipe!

Beyond adding a bit of oatmeal for texture, I stayed true to the recipe. I did cut the portions in half to make one loaf rather than two.  Next time I'll add a bit more sugar, some vanilla and some mashed bananas. I think it will make an excellent banana bread!

Very good quick bread. Since it made two loaves, I followed the example of one of the other reviewers and made one loaf the way the recipe says, and added two chopped apples plus a teaspoon of cinnamon to the other loaf. Both turned out nicely (though I think I will need to add a little more cinnamon the next time I want to make the apple version). The apple version did eventually start to go bad, so I'll have to eat it more quickly next time! And if you make the regular brown bread, you absolutely must eat it with butter melted into the warm bread - it's very tasty. Thanks for the recipe!

I'll be using this recipe alot! It just came out of the oven and it looks perfect and smells wonderful, like caramel. I made a single loaf to try. Used only unbleached flour. Had about 1 1/2 T. maple sugar to use up so put that in the bottom of my measuring cup and packed the rest of it with brown sugar. Everything else by the recipe. Baked in a pryex bread pan at 325*F. for 45 minutes and it came out just right! Looks like I really worked hard on it, but it was the easiest loaf I've ever made. Stirred with a spoon. Just know it will taste great too! Needs to cool some first, though.

This recipe is an excellent!  Thank you! It can be more healthy if you use non-fat powdered milk with vinegar to substitute for the butter milk.  It has no reflection in the end result.  Sunflower seeds, honey, molasses, the options are endless.  Muffins too!  Be prepared that it will erupt like a volcano as baking.    Enjoy and thank you for a great recipe.

This is an excellent recipe--totally a snap to make, and my family loved it.  I served it up with soup one night, then the next, we slathered it with jam for a snack with some tea.  I usually do half a recipe, but I bet this would freeze well too.

I love this bread!  We make it often in our home.  Recipe is perfect as written, although I often add flax seed meal or wheat germ just to hide a little bit of extra nutrition.

I made this bread about a week ago, and it was wonderful. I loved it fresh out of the oven with some butter, and that was delicious. Then I made a sandwich using it, and that was perfect too. I was expecting it to be cumbly, as I've heard happens with whole wheat flour, but it did not crumble at all. I will be making this again! It doesn't compare to any other bread I've tried! Thanks.

Very very good!  i was a little skeptical, as my 9yo picked this out to try for her birthday with her potato soup, but it was her pick and everyone loved it. I think it would be great with added raisins for a snack-ier bread and we'll try a little less sugar (personal taste) next time. Super easy and quick to make.  I'm sure we'll make it often.

I needed a quick bread since I ran out of bread and did not want to wait for yeast to rise. Instead of the all purpose flour I used ground oatmeal to make it healthy.  The texture and density is more like a muffin not bread and the flavor is okay. I will probably decrease the sugar and add dried fruit next time to make it even healthier. I also used the milk and vinegar since I did not have any buttermilk on hand.

Wow!!! I have never made a wheat bread without yeast before, and this recipe was really good!!! I made only one loaf, and I used dry milk mixed with water and lemon juice in place of the buttermilk. Thanks for the recipe! My family is enjoying it!

Delicious!  I was looking for something without yeast, since my toddler is sensitive to that.  She loved it and so did I!  I halved the recipe, used powdered buttermilk, and added 1 cup chopped raisins.  Lightly sweet, very flavorful, and easy.

I made this to bring to a Presidents' Day dinner party, and everybody loved it.  I couldn't believe how good it was, considering there's no kneading or rising or anything.  I may never make whole wheat yeast bread again.

I have to agree that this recipe calls for too much baking soda.  You can taste it, and that shouldn't be.  I'm going to try halving it next time.  The good news is there *will* be a next time!  I like the recipe enough to try it again.  The substitutions I made are I used spelt flour instead of whole wheat, unsweetened vanilla almond milk instead of buttermilk, and Sucanat sugar instead of brown sugar.  All of these substitutions worked!  The bread rose nicely, and it was moist and yummy... except for that baking soda after taste.

I just put this recipe together and it is now in the oven. But I weighed my flour instead of using a measuring cup. I added two more cups of buttermilk to absorb all the dry flour mixture and covered the top of one loaf with brown sugar and the other with raisins and brown sugar. I hope it turns out! I'll let you know as soon as it is done. My question is, is this supposed to look like a tea bread batter at the end of mixing or a thick wet dough. Mine looked more like a thick wet dough.

Thank you very much for posting this recipe. My only fault with this bread is how addicting it is. It's good with sweet toppings (like jam) and just as good with savory. Simple to make and delicious to eat--my kind of recipe!

This bread is delicious! I halved the ingredients to make one loaf instead of two. The bread came out perfect. I sprinkled some oats on top before baking, and loved the taste and texture they added. I will be experimenting with this receipe - adding more whole wheat flour with oats in the batter...possibly adding walnut and apple chunks, too. This is an easy, versatile and delicious bread.

Absolutely amazing and super easy!!  The only tip I would suggest is sprinking the brown sugar in.  I used packed brown sugar and found a clump baked into the bread.

This was excellent!  I made it exactly as the recipe shows and it was unbelievable.  My family LOVED it!  The texture was amazing.  To all who are not big-time bread bakers - these did not take the full baking time - I had 6 minutes left of the hour on the timer - so make sure you are checking it towards the end.  I think I will make this recipe again as a breakfast sweet-bread with raisins and cinnamon!

This was very good and SO easy!  One of the few recipes where I can actually preheat the oven first, because in the few minutes it takes to get the oven to temperature, I can throw the ingredients together and have the pan ready.  I made it for the first time a week ago, and made a second batch already today.  Made it exactly as written (half recipe each time) except I didn't have buttermilk either time - used vinegar the first time and lemon juice today, both times with skim milk.  Couldn't tell the difference.  Great way to get whole grains, but I'm looking forward to trying it with some added coconut, pecans and cinnamon.  I was going to do that today but my husband wanted it just the way we had it the first time.  We've eaten it plain, with light butter, pumpkin butter (from this site), strawberry preserves... all good.  Used a Pyrex loaf pan sprayed well with cooking spray and they didn't stick at all.  The middle of mine was still a little mushy when the outside was done, so I may need to try tweaking that a bit.  Best hot from the oven, but also great as toast the next day.  With a hearty soup, would make a great meal.

What a fantastic bread.  I had buttermilk to use up and this did just the trick.  I halved everything due to the lack of  that much buttermilk and I sure wish I had more.  Will make again.  Very quick and easy.  Thanks so much.

I'm giving this 4 stars only because there is a slight baking soda aftertaste (which can be covered up nicely with butter!).  Other than that the bread turned out delicious.

Added 1/4 cu flaxseed and put half of the batter in mini loaf pans.  The regular loaf cooked in 50 minutes and tasted good (as expected, rather plain).  The mini-loafs were probably overcooked at 40 minutes and too crusty; I will make the recipe again but will not use mini-loafs.

Pretty good. Would have liked if it had risen a bit more.  Toasting it made it completely bland, but fresh from the oven it was yummy. We did get a little sick of the flavor after a few days having it around.

One of my absolute favorite recipes.  But I suggest using full fat buttermilk. Low fat versions tend to make a drier bread.

This bread was good, very filling.  The dough seemed pretty dry, so I added some honey and golden raisins to a second loaf and it turned out even better that the first!

Needed a bread for an impromptu dinner so I found this & made 1/2 recipe (1 loaf) to try it.  It was a hit for me AND my dinner guests!  It stayed moist for days (as long as it lasted anyway!) .  One guest went home with most of what was left over!  It reminds me of my mother's brown bread recipe she used to make with raisins & almost always served with baked beans on Saturday.  I'll try adding raisins next time, and there WILL be a next time!

Loved the flexibility and speed of this bread.  Needed a dinnertime bread and had forgotten to bake a proper loaf earlier in the day so this was an ideal substitute.  Made 1 loaf per recipe - perfect for our chicken dinner (with butter).  Made 2nd loaf with flax seed, vanilla, cinnamon and raisins to use for breakfast/healthy kids snack.  Both turned out great.  Easy to figure out sweet add-ins for breakfast type bread - hoping to find more savory add-ins for dinner bread even though it was good as described with butter.

This was excellent.  Followed directions exactly and loved the result.  My wife, who ordinarily doesn't care much for bread, said it was the best bread she'd ever eaten.  She's excitedly bringing the second loaf to our two year old's playgroup tomorrow for a snack.

I lovvvved this bread!!  I went by the recipe but added raisins & a partial bag of left over walnuts.  Since I only had a few left in the bag & didn't think it was enough I looked around my kitchen & found & used sunflower seeds & loved the nutty taste they gave the bread.  I gave my neighbor a piece & he described it as "Awesome" as well as healthy!  A really versatile recipe that I intend to keep experimenting with....

Excellent bread. I wanted a breakfast bread so I added 1/2 cup sunflower seeds, 1/2 cup pumpkin seeds, 1 Tbls. ground flaxseed, 1 Tbls. wheat germ, 1 bag dried blueberries, 2 cups wheat flour less 2 Tbls.., 1 teas. cinnamon, 1/2 teas. salt, 1 Tbls. molasses, 1 teas. vanilla, 1/2 cup brown sugar less 1 Tbls, 2 cups buttermilk (skim milk and 2 Tbls. vinegar). I let sit in the pan for 10 minutes then baked for 1 hour. Made 1 wonderful bread. The molasses adds a nice touch.

Very yum and beautiful texture. I will make this many more times.  I've already shared this recipe with friends. Thanks IleneG for the suggestion to mask the baking soda taste with cinnomon. One friend suggested adding raisins and nuts. Another friend said it was fantastic when spread with crnchy peanut butter.

Very tasty and simple bread! I love that I can make it in the afternoon and not spend all day making bread for dinner. I decreased the sugar as others recommended to 3/4 c. and it was plenty sweet. My family said it tasted a bit like cornbread. It worked great with our roasted vegetable soup. It was great as toast this morning for breakfast too. Thanks for the great recipe. I'll make it again for sure.

This was my first "brown bread" and it came out wonderful! I did do the substitute for the buttermilk since I was snowed in and had milk and white vinrgar  Next time I will add raisins. I will be making this again. Thanks for a great recipe.

Such great results for such little effort! Warm, out of the oven, with a bit of butter...Unbel I thought for sure I was having dessert!! It is a bit like a pumpkin bread (texture wise), so I can see adding fruit to it to make it a breakfast bread or snack. Unbeleivable that there is no oil or butter! It will be great for the kids school lunch.

Just GREAT BREAD- I used the new (at least to me) white whole wheat flour and added 1 Tbls. of Molasses just to compensate for the baking soda taste others commented on -otherwise followed exactly as recipe is.  So reminiscent of the Boston Brown Bread we had as kids without all the work. I can see adding raisins for the 2nd loaf for a breakfast treat Thanks so much for contributing this recipe- now gotta go and cut another piece.

Even without them, this bread reminds me so much of a date bread that my mother used to make when I was a kid.  In fact, I think the next time I make this bread, I will reduce the brown sugar and add dates and raisins for a change of pace.   An extremely easy recipe to make.  When I was baking them, I thought the loaves were overdone after about 50 minutes, but the knife test told me they still had to bake more.  Anyway, enough from me!!!  A recipe I will definitely make again.  Thanks to the contributor for sharing.

Mmmmm...I have always wanted to try Brown Bread and I am glad I did.  I only made one loaf (there aren't that many in our house) and I made it with soured milk and molasses.  My one caveat is to make sure that you really mix it well.  I did not mix mine enough and ended up with white streaks in mine.  That is my fault though, not that of the recipe's.  I served mine warm with vegetarian baked beans, ham, Swiss Cheese, and salad for dinner and everyone liked it.  Thanks so much for the recipe.  I will definitely make it again!

This is a good bread, but not 5 star worthy in my opinion.  I like my bread a little sweeter, so next time I make it I'll use a little molasses to sweeten it up.  If you like a hearty "wheaty" bread, this one is good.

my teenage son and his two friends and my two younger kids all loved this bread with butter and cherry jelly on top. they ate one whole loaf the first night. i also loved it but am not getting any help with the leftover second loaf I think I will halve the recipe next time.

I was looking for a way to use up buttermilk I had sitting in the fridge.  Simply a breakfast or snack bread.  Good toasted with butter and jelly.  Gets old after a while.  If I'm going to have a sweet bread, I'd rather it have fruit.

This was really great, even with all my substitutions. I used reconsituted powdered skim milk with lemon juice for the buttermilk, half ground oatmeal in place of the whole wheat flour because I didn't have enough, and I added some dried fruit and nuts. It was very moist out of the oven, and just as good the next morning. I think the oatmeal really helped keep it moist.

Very good bread and smelled wonderful while cooking. I did not have buttermilk so I did the milk with vinegar. The bread taste like it has molasses baked in without the bother. Thanks for recipe!

This bread was just OK.  Something about the flavor just didn't seem right.  It was a little better when eaten with herbed spreadable cheese.

This was okay. Was a nice quick bread but not alot of flavor. Baked in less than 1 hour. About 40 minutes.
