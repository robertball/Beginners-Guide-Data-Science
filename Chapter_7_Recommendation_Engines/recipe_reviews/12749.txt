This is an excellent recipe that can be used with almost any fish. I used a thin fresh walleye filet. Due to the high oven temperature, the secret to success is to use a thin cut of fish. I recommend 1” thick or less.  Too thick and the crust will burn before the fish is done.  Since the recipe calls for cod filets, most frozen cod is usually too thick and should be horizontally cut in half before applying the crust and baking. I also took other reviewers advice and used the salt & vinegar chips. I recommend using a food processor to “crush” the chips.  Once the chips were crushed, I added the cheese to the processor and gave it just a couple of more rotations to evenly mix the cheese and chips

So, this dish is so yummy! I did'nt have chips or the cheese recomended. So I used ritz crackers and monterey jack cheese, adding grated parmesean to the mix. After marinating the  fish in the dressing, I sprinkled it on both sides with garlic salt, black pepper, and red chili pepper. It came out great -watch your hand with the chili pepper if you dont like spicy food. Enjoy!

Yummy! A few reviews that said this was not tasty?? Coat heavily in any creamy salad dressing, make sure the fish are not touching. I used more chips and cheese than called for, sliced the cod thinner, and cooked 2 minutes longer. Next time I'm trying the vinegar and salt chips, but it was fine this way!  My 15 year old son who hates fish, LOVED IT (everyone did). It tastes fried without immersing in oil ;)

MADE IT AGAIN...This time using Flounder...used up the ends of Green goddess and some Ranch dressing....again...5 star recipe! I love the fact that I used up the ends of bottles and the bottom of the chip bag...things you would normally just discard!So quick to make too! UPDATE! Used whiting this time, a stronger fish and had to sub Mozzarella and Mexican Parm, exellant crust on top!Mixed the cheese and chips in a ziploc, added parsley for prettiness!PREVIOUSLY: SSoooooo easy! I used Tilapia, and used mostly sharp cheddar but added a couple of tablespoons of blue cheese and pepper jack trying to use up some bits and pieces of leftover cheeses. I piled the topping on (i mayt have made extra topping since I just eyeballed it. Good way to use up the bottom of the chip bag! The timing and temperature were perfect....the only tip I would add is: Spray or grease the pan really, really well! The cheese that melted off the edges of the fish wanted to stick and you don't want to fight with it to get it off the pan...use foil lining,too.

This is my first time writing a review but I had to because I love this recipe so much.  I hate to cook but this recipe is so easy to make and it turns out wonderful every time.  My boyfriend (who hates fish) practically eats the entire thing when I make this.  The only thing I do differently is marinate the fish in the Italian dressing for a longer time.  Also, I took the advice of the previous reviews and make sure my chips are Salt & Vinegar (and I add some jalapeno ones for a little spice) because it truly adds to the flavor. Thanks Caroline for a great meal!

This was so quick and easy to make, I love it.  I didn't have any creamy Italian dressing so I used regular Italian dressing and it turned out delicious.

Not a bad recipe for those who really don't like fish.  The flavor of the fish is lost in all the stuff you did to it.  Maybe some like that, but I'll never make this again.

This is one of the better fish recipes I've tried in a long time.  Really liked it, and very easy to put together.  I used cod, Nacho-Cheese flavored Doritoes, and Ceaser (sp?) dressing, as I did not have creamy Italian.  I also increased the shredded cheddar in topping to 1 cup.  Also, baked fish at 425 for 12 minutes.  Yum!  I served this with brown rice and asparagus--wonderful combo.  Will make this again--next time I will use the spicy Doritoes.  Topping is great!  Thanks for the recipe.

Mmm yummy! I used cod fillets. They were thick so I butterflied them horizontally first. I also used a cheesy Ranch salad dressing. I just spread the ranch on top evenly then added the chip/cheese topping and patted down gently. Use aluminum foil to line your baking sheet sprayed w/ Pam: easy clean up! I didn't quite have enough chips, so I used half herb seasoned crackers crushed w/ half sour cream & onion potato chips, and colby jack cheese. It was the "BEST fish we've ever tasted", that's what my husband and 6 yr. old said ;) I also followed another's review and baked at only 425 degrees for 13 minutes. It was perfectly crispy on top and not over browned. The fish was moist and delicious! We served ours w/ rice and mixed veggies. This recipe will be added to my weekly rotation. Thanks for sharing!

I've made this recipe three times so far and it's so good my 12 year old who "does NOT like fish" even eats it.  I use Boulder Canyon salt & MALT vinegar potato chips for the chips.  We really like the malt vinegar flavor with the chips.  I use my mini food processor to crush the chips and cheese. I have used walleye all 3 times.  I have marinated the fish in both creamy and regular Italian dressing (depending on what I had in the pantry) and both worked well.  I marinate the fish for about 10 minutes otherwise the marinade overpowers the mild flavor of the fish.  It is very important to wipe any excess marinade off the fish (I use a pastry brush) before putting it the pan that you use for baking.  This allows the topping to get crisp (otherwise it's a little soggy, I know it happened to me once).  I cook it for 10 minutes (we like our fish well-done).  It takes great and it's a fast dinner for a busy night.

Delicious.  My husband was especially fond of this dish.  I didn't have creamy Italian-style dressing so I blended some Italian Dressing and Mayo and used that.

Great recipe.  As others have mentioned, if you fillet is too thick you will need to adjust the baking time.  I used thick cuts of cod, but covered the top lightly with foil.  I needed to bake it for 30 minutes and turned the temp. down to 425.

I am a born and raised what some people call a "mackeral snapper" and I grew up having to eat non-meat dishes EVERY Friday and I wasn't always thrilled about it. Where in the world was something like this back then? (Sorry Mom, up in the Great Kitchen.) This is delicious!! And, it's very easy to make. I went by the recipe, except I doubled the cheese. (Wife is a cheese freak.) I did three tilapia fillets that weighed in at just over a pound all total. But, I used my gas grill at 500 degrees. I used a 9 X 12 pan with aluminum foil sprayed lightly with vegetable spray. The fish turned out perfect after 12 minutes...moist but not overdone. I put a similar pan next to it with frozen Orida french fries. Next time I will sprinkle some dried dill weed on the fish, just because I always use dill in my fish batter. I may try catfish fillets next time. They are cheaper, especially if I do some good at the lake, and we like them. Wife who grew the same way raved about this. Thanks for the recipe and thanks again for such a great website!!!

I used Ken's creamy Italian dressing and orange roughy for this recipe. I thought the flavor of the dressing was a bit overpowering for the fish. I did like the crunchy potato chip layer though. Plus, it was easy to assemble and back. If I try this again it will be with a different dressing or maybe plain yogurt.

Tried this one tonight and it was great.  I used  lite ranch dressing instead of italian; lite cheese and lite chips.  It was very good and even got a thumbs up from dh.  He asked me to make it again.  Kids wouldn't touch it -- they aren't fish lovers.

This is a quick, easy dish if you're at a last-minute dinner standstill and don't know what to make (story of my life.) I've made it with both cod and tilapia; definitely increase cooking time for cod. You can use whatever salad dressing you have on hand. I like the creamy Italian but didn't have any so used ranch tonight. Like other reviewers, I used my mini chopper for the chips and cheese. I've always used regular Lays chips, but I add some dill and it really makes the dish. Easy, quick, tasty and gets my kids to eat fish. I'm in.

This is the easiest, best fish preparation method I've ever stumbled across!!  I have to admit, the high temperature made me a little hesitant to try it at first, but I decided to trust previous reviewers, and boy am I glad I did!  Everyone I've made it for has loved it!!  The first time I tried it, the only cracker or chip-like items I had in the house were flatbread crisps - so I made crumbs from those and combined with Tillamook medium cheddar, and it turned out fantastic.  The second time, I used Hawaiian Sweet Onion Chips and Tillamook, and the results were equally outstanding.  I used parchment and a heavy cookie sheet both times.

I made this with regular Italian dressing, pepper jack cheese and crushed up Rice Krispies.   I baked it with smashed potatoes for 25 min. @ 450. My and I husband loved it!  It's our new favorite one to use with fish.  Thank you Karena

I was a bit skeptical but I needed a quick recipe for tonight.  I marinated for 1/2 hour in italian vinagarette.  Then I used Cheddar Cheese Pringles and a mixture of Colby/Monterry Jack.  It was AMAZING!  Definitely a keeper!

Wow this was good.  My five year old asked me to make it again tonight!  He loved the idea of chips on food.  I used a previous writers comments and used part Itailian part ranch for the sauce.  YUMMY!

Teenage Children thought it was the best halibut recipe they have ever tasted. The younger children weren't so convinced. Wife loved it and so did I.

Excellent!  Loved it for a change.  Not quite as healthy but it makes a nice change.  I spiced the fish first with Chilpotle and Cayenne and then followed the recipe (used only 1/8 cup of Italian Dressing to marinate.  Delish!

Great recipe!  I used kraft creamy italian dressing, lays original potatoe chips, & finely shredded sharp cheddar cheese.  I made extra chip/cheese mixture and used extra dressing for the marinade.  I also put about a tablespoon extra dressing on top of the fish in the baking dish before adding the chips & cheese.  So moist & flavorful & easy!  I served with wild rice & green beans.  Forgot to take a picture but the plates looked beautiful & tasted amazing.  Thanks for sharing!

Who would have thought potato chips would be a good breading?  I bought haddock, my wife's favorite, made the Italian dressing and we raved about it. Its simplicity and flavors are fantastic. Any fish would do, and I love cod, but you couldn't go wrong with anything. This is a keeper.

This was the most fab recipe ... I used Talapia ... caesar salad dressing from Trader Joe's ... didn't have cheddar so I used smoked gouda ... it was so yummy I can't tell you.  And I love how this recipe can be changed depending on what you have in your fridge... this tasted so elegant I would serve to company ... I served in with French Green Beans and mushroom rice ... mine looked exactly like the pic ... I would worry, I must admit, if I used a thicker type of fish such as Halibut ... the thinner Talapia was P E R F E C T and it was perfectly cooked and delicious!!!

I usually don't rate recipes but this one deserves it.  I am not good at cooking fish and was tired of my same old fish fry.  This was super easy to make and came out phenomenal.  Everyone loved it, even my three year old.

We were pleasantly surprised by this and really, REALLY enjoyed it! My grocery store didn't have creamy italian dressing (go figure), so I used creamy ceasar dressing, and that worked out wonderfully. Also, I only had sour cream and onion chips on hand, so I went with those. This baked up wonderfully with a nice crispy top. Very flavorful, and something that I would definately make again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Loved this recipe!! I used blue-gill and bass (a mix of fresh fish from my dad's fishing trip). I was able to throw together my own "creamy italian" dressing by adding a tablespoon of miracle whip to some light italian dressing. My husband & I devoured this one! I may try to use unseasoned cornbread in place of the chips next time...

4/16/11 UPDATE: I made this again using Creamy Italian Dressing I, from this site. Excellent! Better than using the ranch dressing I used the first time I made this.  ORIGINAL REVIEW: I made this using tilapia and ranch salad dressing.  I just eyeballed the ingredients and probably added a little more cheddar.  I assembled mine in the afternoon, covered and refrigerated until time to pop in the oven.  I baked mine  at 425 for about 20-25 minutes and they were perfectly cooked, still nice and moist, and flaked easily.  I served this with a dollop of Harry & David Pepper and Onion relish and it was delicious!  If you have chips getting stale, give this one a try!

Loved it!!  Couldn't find creamy Italian dressing so I used Kraft Fat Free Peppercorn Ranch.  I don't buy potato chips or dip because I am one that could sit down and eat the whole bag.  I found some 1 oz. bags of Sea Salt & Cracked Pepper kettle cooked potato chips.  I used one bag per filet (3 fillets) but didn't decrease the cheese.  Bags crushed to 1/4 cup after eating one chip out of each bag.  Using a rolling  pin I crushed the chips right in the bag.  I also put tin foil in the 9 x 13 pan for easy cleanup.  Recipe is delicious as is, but I would like to try sprinkling a little garlic or onion powder on the filets.  Thanks for the recipe Karena.

Extremely tasty and easy to make. It doesn't really even taste like fish. I used a little dried dill in the chip/cheese mixture. A definite keeper.

I made this dish tonight and have to give it 5 stars because my young kids AND husband liked it! (so did I)  My husband and I eat out a lot and he is not usually impressed with non-restaurant food.  He really liked this one though, and I loved how easy it was!  I baked mine for about 20 minutes at 425/450.  Thank you Karena!

Sorry; neither my husband nor I liked this dish.  Perhaps it's just that we aren't big cod fans?  Or, perhaps I did something wrong?  The taste was rather bland.

Loved this recipe - easy & tasty!
I used catfish, ranch dressing (which I spiced up a little) for the marinade and BBQ chips for the topping.
Will definately make this again  :)

I love fried fish, so breaded the bottom of the fish and laid on a rack over a shallow pan that had parchment paper in for the drips. Then I piled the rest of the toppings on the top side of the fish. It would have turned out great and very crispy on both sides if I hadn't forgot about it..lol still good next time I will set timer.

My favorite fish recipe!  Very simple.  The recipe is great as written, but I prefer to use tilapia, zesty rather than creamy italian, and salt and vinegar kettle chips.

We liked this a lot! I followed the recipe as written, except for two things:  I used crushed Ritz Crackers, as I didn't have chips on hand, and I baked it at 400 for about 10 minutes and then finished it up under the broiler at the end.  It was flakey, moist, and had good flavor.  Thanks!  This is a keeper!

I followed the recipe.  Had a hard time finding the creamy Italian dressing until my husband suggested looking in the dairy section of the grocery store.  I found one there by Marzetti (Sweet Italian, which is creamy), and was delicious!  It only took 1/4 cup to marinate the fish (cod) completely.  I followed other users suggestions and used my food processor to crush the potato chips and then at the end added in the cheese to quickly blend.  Easy!  This made thee best topping ever!  My entire family LOVED this dinner!  My sons normally require tartar sauce w/their fish, but this was so delicious, they didn't need any! Definitely a do again...so few ingredients, so easy, so quick!  A great week night meal!

I used this recipe for $20/lb fresh halibut. I was hesitant to use such a "down-to-earth" recipe on such expensive fish (and because of the standard, "no cheese with fish" advice) . But OMG -- it was FANTASTIC! Like others, I couldn't find creamy Italian dressing, so I substituted a good-quality ranch dressing. Based on other reviews, I was worried the filets wouldn't be done (without the top burning), since my filets were more than an inch thick. But they turned out perfect, exactly as the recipe was written (9 minutes). This is the only way I will be making white fish in the future.

I never had cod before. Don't know if it's this recipe or what, but it didn't even taste like . My cheese/chip mixture slid right off my fish when it came out of the oven, so I kind of had to mash everything together. This was good, but not great.

this was just okay for me.  I used tilapia and salt and vinegar chips but I wish I stuck to regular chips.  For some reason the vinegar flavour was weird.  Maybe it was the fish.  I made my own creamy italian dressing.  I may try it again but with plain chips and another type of fish.

After seeing all the great ratings I was excited to try this recipe.   I was so upset when I realized I had ran out of creamy Italian dressing.  The only creamy dressing I had on hand was creamy peppercorn ranch.  So I marinated my tilapia in the peppercorn ranch dressing, pulsed the chips and cheese as GUYCHEF had advised.  I have to say that fish never tasted better.   I can’t wait to try this with the creamy Italian!!!

I used the vinegar chips as others suggested...not the biggest fish fan, but it was good & i would make it again this way!  Baked at 425 for 13 mins & then turned it up for 2 mins to brown the top.

I make this almost once a week.  I usually use 1/2 c. of cheese.  I also make it with tilapia since that's what's fresh in the store near us.  Kettle brand salt and vinegar chips are better than Lays.  Love it!

This is quick, easy and delicious.  I even fed it to two teenage boys and they loved it.  I used BBQ chips and the results were fantastic.  I am married to a fisherman and always looking for different things to do to fish because we get sick of the same old thing.  This will definitely go in the rotation!

I've made this recipe for years - particularly with salmon.  Instead of the dressing, brush the fish with dijon mustard and then coat with crushed potato chips and bake.  Fantastic!

The flavors of this recipe were good, but I did not like it on cod.  I'm used to cooking tilapia, a more tender fish.  Maybe I will try it again with a different kind of fish.

I have used this on whitefish and tilapia. So easy and good! You can change up the topping and spices easily. I have used seasoned bread crumbs and parmesan, crushed ritz and mexican blend cheese. However, I always use more cheese to the ratio of chips, crackers or bread crumbs. So good!!

This was good, I did make a few changes. I used a combination of balsamic basil and Ken's greek dressing for marinating.  My son had 4 helping and had the leftovers for lunch the next day. My husband who is really picky about fish loved it too.

I was disappointed with this. I used ranch dressing as I had it on hand. I could not taste it all. The potato chips didn't add much flavor either. To me, this tasted almost the same as if I had just baked the fish plain. My husband took a couple of bites and then made a bologna sandwich! I saw all of the good reviews and was hoping for tasty new fish recipe. Funny how different everyone's tastes can be, LOL!

I don't even want to think about calorie content of this fish, but it sure is delicious. I didn't have creamy Italian dressing so I used low-fat creamy garlic dressing. I poured it over sole and baked it a bit longer on 350 since ten minutes on 450 didn't seem to be enough.

This is a great recipe.  Very quick and easy and my husband and son loved it.  I added a little chopped fresh parsley to the topping.  I did marinate the fish for about 10 minutes and it was just great.  Will make this one again!  Thank you!

I always have left overs but when I made this, there was not a crumb in sight.  Unfortunately I have not had a chance to eat it myself. ( I had to work that night). But my 2 boys, (6&3yrs) devoured every bite.  My husband enjoyed it as well.  I can't wait to make it again!!   :)

Very easy and recommended even for non-fish lovers. I've made this a couple of times with Black Sea bass and used ranch dressing and parmesian cheese instead of cheddar and it turns out great. I also roll the marinated fish to coat completely with the chips/cheese mixture.  Never disappointed and always moist.

I tried this for the first time, and we loved it!  I mixed Ranch and Creamy Italian dressings.  My cod was a little thick so I baked it at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.  It came out perfect!  My husband says it's the best fish he's ever had.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Tasty and fast on a night when I was short on time.

When out of potato chips, I've made this with Nut Thins (rice crackers) and panko with seasoning. Both good and easy. Adaptable and simple recipe.

Made this tonight and really loved the easiness! I did not have Italian dressing so tried Southwest Ranch and colby jack cheese. Great combination. My husband is gluten intolerant and the chips work great for that. Will definitely make again. May try with chicken too. Thanks for the recipe:)

My family and I really enjoyed this fish dish.  I picked it because I thought it sounded good, but I mistakenly added it to my menu last week without looking at all the ingredients.  I am trying to cook everything from scratch and potato chips are not an item I would keep on hand.  So I substituted bread crumbs and I also made the creamy Italian dressing from scratch.  
Next time I will try to make some potato chips and try it that way.  I accidentally made too much fish, but that didn't matter because these monsters gobbled it up.

I love this recipe. Simply and tasty.   I subsituted Italian vinegar and oil dressing (Wishbone) for the creamy Italian.   I also increased the amount of cheese to 1/2 cup. I used cod fish.   I've had this recipe before as my X was a big fisherman

I tried this yesterday, using swai.  I thought it was very easy and quite tasty.  I had to bake at a lower temp due to other things in the oven, and it still came out good.

Really good!  Don't change a thing . . . but unless your fish filets are really thin, you'll need a little longer than 8-10 minutes baking time!   (I used salt & vinegar potato chips -- Yum!)

Family loved it though I didn't quite follow the directions. I used Creamy Caesar since I didn't have creamy Italian, my fillets were Pollock, and I didn't quite use a cup of potato chips. I just eyeballed it. Also, I didn't marinate the fish but just put them in the baking pan, poured dressing over them (didn't measure this either), sprinkled on the cheese, and sprinkled on the chips. WAY easy!

I made this for dinner tonight.  I had no chips at home so like others, I used crushed Ritz crackers and grated whatever cheese I had on hand. The Italian dressing was Good Seasons regular, not creamy.  It kept the fish moist and added just enough spices.  My family loved it!

I've made this dish twice.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly and it was great; the second time I added a little cayenne pepper to the chip/cheese mixture and it was awesome.  I used fresh cod and they were a little thicker so I had to adjust the cooking time accordingly.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is not the best choice if you are looking for something that accents a good piece of fish -- rather, this is a good choice for those who are not sure they love fish.   Simple, fool-proof, tasty.  I have over 100 fish recipes, and this one still goes in the book!

I was hesitant to make this recipe because of the potato chips but went & tried it anyway. Am so glad that I did!  It was really good, I did not even change a thing. Would definitely make this again. As a matter of fact, I went & bought more cod fish when I went shopping this week. It's a keeper!

This fish was edible but not that great. It was very bland as-is and even with the addition of peppercorn cheddar and chile powder it remained that way. It would be fine for kids, especially ones that aren't too crazy about fish, but I don't think it will be gracing my table again.

This recipe was very easy to make, tasty and very forgiving on ingredients. I used tilapia filets, regular Italian dressing and crushed Boulder Canyon Rice & Bean chips as that was what I had on hand and shredded cheddar cheese. My husband thought it was very tasty, as did I, though I may have cooked the tilapia a minute or 2 too long as they were thin filets and probably cooked fast! Very happy with the recipe though!

Even though I did not follow the recipe exactly it was very good.  I didn't roll the chips finely enough so I think that would be a better option and definitely use a cheese that has a good flavor not something bland.  I also think that the 500* seals the deal as it cooks it fast but still keeps it moist.  You probably could do a run with thin pounded chix/turkey cutlets as well.  You are only limited by your imagination!

Really like this recipe, it has a nice crunch and flavor. I feel it is missing some type of acidity however. Next time, I'm probably going to marinate it in lemon juice instead of the dressing, which will also cut down on fat. But the recipe as is is tasty and easy and definitely worthy of 5 stars. I like the diversity this recipe offers, allowing people to use different types of dressing and chips.

We eat lots of fish, so its nice to try some different preparations.  This was good, but not one of my favorites.  Husband gave it an "OK".  Did use the vinegar chips as suggested.  Its worth using again for variation.

everyone liked this, even the picky 3-yo, once she could be bribed into trying it (french fries are always useful on new food night!!!!) I did use caesar dressing instead of Italian, and it had to cook more like 15-20 min, but even with that high heat, it was moist and tender and the topping was crunchy, not burnt. We'll make it again.

This is one of my family's *favorite* fish recipes! When the description calls it a "no-fail" fish recipe it is not kidding! We actually use this a lot with Tilapia and other white fish. Instead of creamy italian I use zesty italian and the flavor is fantastic. When it comes to fish do not marinate too long, because the acid in marinades can actually "burn" white fish, so 5-10 min is the max you should let it sit while you are getting everything ready. I usually double the amount of cheese I use, but I have found that most types of shredded cheese work. We have used cheddar, mild cheddar, low fat cheddar, Monteray Jack, colby jack, casserole blend and even 4 cheese mexican blend! this is a very forgiving recipe. I do have a friend that used a bit of parmesean and he said he does not recommend that one!

I had such a craving for fish and this definatly did it!! Ofcourse I , like most, did a little tweaking. I used Cod fillets, and rather than plain italian i used a marinade, Roasted Red Pepper Italian w/ Parmesean cheese. I also choose salt and vinegar kettle cooked chips , finely chopped , but added Land O Lakes Parmesean and Herb Seasoning to the chip and cheese mixture. Cooked up a few pre-cooked crab cakes in EVOO and margerine until nice and crispy on the outside and it was an amazing meal!!! ENJOY!

This was really good, family liked it. I had thick cuts of cod, so I followed a previous suggestion of cutting down the temp (to 425) and cooked it for about 25 mins (covered with alum foil). Turned out perfectly. Will make again.

Wow, I had forgotten about this fish and just found it on allrecipes again! My dad and DH absolutely Loved it! I used regular italian (I don't think it matters if it's creamy or not), sharp cheddar, salt and vinegar chips and tilapia (easy to find and cheap) This recipe is delicious, easy and fast! Can't beat that :o)

I just fixed this recipe for the first time, made some adjustments: I used crushed club crackers, added Old Bay lemon & herb spice, just a few red pepper flakes, salt & Colby & Monterey shredded cheese. Marinated the fish (I used cod) in Zesty Italian dressing and baked it at 425 for 16 minutes. It was awesome!! Even my next-door neighbor loved it. Will make this again soon.

This recipe is SO quick and SO easy!  I used Sea Salt & Vinegar Kettle Chips and I tripled the cheese.  Be careful and watch the baking time, if you bake for too long your chips will burn!  Thanks Karena for a tasty & quick weeknight meal.

I don't know why people are disappointed with this recipe. I don't like sharp cheddar so I used a Parmesan Cheese blend with the potato chips. I put them in the food chopper and pulsed them together before spreading it over tilapia. Put it in the oven, made some rice and carrots. I tasted it and thought it was good but when my husband said it had a nice flavor and it was really good, I knew it was a winner for sure. The fish was moist and flavorful. The chips gave it a nice crunch and flavor.

Very nice dish. I will make it again.

This was good, just not great. I was expecting it to be "FANTASTIC" after reading all the rave reviews, so it was a bit disappointing that it was merely "GOOD". I will probably make this one again, but not with such high  expectations!

This was really good.  I couldn't get enough.  I followied others advice and used 1/2 italian & 1/2 ranch.  Added a lot more seasoning...salt, pepper, dill and red peppers.  I also used about 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar and my fish of choice was talipia.  I could eat this everyday.

I chose this recipe based on the wonderful reviews but I was pretty disappointed with the results. I followed the directions to a tee but I still found the dish (I used cod) to be lacking in flavor. I tried the salt and vinegar chips and that is pretty much all I could taste. I think next time I get white fish I will stick to something a little more traditional.

I used Italian Style bread crumbs and it wasn't as good as everyone else here says.  My son loved it but next time i will use Lay's chips (they are more greasy than the dry bread crumbs) and i bet this will be better. Follow the recipe--don't try bread crumbs!

I LOVED this. I used Scrod (because the cod was a little expensive for us), salt & vinegar chips and a mixture of cheddar and a little mozz. I marinated the fish for a few hours before cooking. This had awesome flavor and the salt & vinegar chips were definitely the kick it needed. I used the same mixture on a shark steak and it also was real good. The shark wasn't slimy or chewy after cooking with the fish. I will definitely make this again.

This was certainly quick and very easy, but nothing to rave about. I don't think I'll make it again since it didn't do anything for my palate. My husband liked it, but there are other recipes for fish that taste REALLY good and not just so-so.

My fish was pretty thick and I ended up having to cook it almost 30 min. That dried out the fish quite a bit. Next time I will slice the fish thinner so that I don't have to cook it for so long and dry it out. I think I will like the flavor more if it was moist. I might drizzle some melted butter over top of it next time.

Great...This is another must try.  I made seven pieces for four people and everything was eaten.  They were actually scraping the cheese and chip mixture off the cassarole dish.  I used whiting (scrod) with creamy italian dressing and for the chips I used sour cream and onion (the thin ones.)  As with most of my cooking I doubled the cheese.  I ended up folling a previous reviewers advice and cooking it for 12 - 15 minutes @ 425/450.  What a hit thanks for another good one

Instead of adding cheese, I used cheddar flavored Pringles type chips (Walmart brand).  It came out really good.  My husband loved it!

I love this recipe! So goood. We did a few things different, though. We used cod for the recipe. I marinated the fish for about a half hour to an hour. I double the chips and cheese to go on top. I also use salt and vinegar chips. Adds a nice touch to the Italian dressing. One time I only had the regular Italian dressing and I do NOT recommend it. Stick with the creamy Italian dressing only.

This recipe ought to be referred to as a "concept" rather than a recipe because it will work with so many variation. I didn't have any creamy dressing, so I used a garlic and herb marinade for about 30 minutes. Then, I didn't have potato chips, but I did have some tortilla chips as well as some Monterrey  Jack cheese I want to use up, so I mixed those together. Finally I rolled the cod filets in the crumb mixture, pressing it firmly onto the fish so it would stick and baked it on my broiler pan (cause it has holes for liquid to drain through) for about 15 or 20 minutes. The chips were nice and brown and the fish had a good flavor.

I'll be honest here. I am an avid fish and shellfish cook/eater. I usually make Salmon, tilapia, catfish, and fresh trout. Tonight I picked up Cod to give it a try. After working out I was tired and wanted something quick and found this recipe. I went to the fridge and was distraught at not finding any creamy Italian dressing. I am not one to worry and can always improvise. I had some Sweet Viadalia Onion dressing and used it instead for the quick marinade do to its creaminess. I finished with the potato chips and cheese mixture. I was bored while waiting on the fish and I like to make and bottle my own sauces. I love Cod with malt vinegar so I got to thinking and made a balsamic vinegar (thought this would pair better) aioli and drizzled it on top. This was sooooo good! One of the best fish recipes I have made. It was so good that if it wouldn't had been so late I would've went out to buy another piece. More than likely I will be eating this tomorrow night. Awesome recipe!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  Normally, he is ridiculously picky, and I fully expected him to hate this dish -- but he really liked it.  I followed others' suggestions and used salt & vinegar potato chips, and we made sure the fish filets were thinly sliced (less than 1 inch).  I used Newman's Own Italian dressing as a marinade, and it was delicious.  The only issue I'm going to try to address the next time I make it is the saltiness -- which may be a challenge because of the potato chips.  Regardless, this is a great recipe.

Mine turned out soupy. I didn't put the marinade in either, I drained it first. The taste was just ok to me and my husband didn't like it and the kids didn't like the way it looked so they wouldn't even try it. Oh well.

This was awesome.  We bring home walleye from Canada, and I've been looking for an alternative to deep frying (as good as that tastes) especially preparing fish in the winter.  This was unbelieveably simple and great tasting.  We used parmesan/garlic chips, and mixed them in a food processor like another reivew suggested.  This recipe is a "keeper".  Thanks.

Everyone liked it--husband, kids (including picky kid.) I'll definitely do this one again. I had no idea what to make for dinner and quickly cold-water thawed the fish, cut them in 1/2 to make them thinner as suggested earlier, and marinated in homemade dressing for 5 min. Only change was I used 1/2 c chips and 1/4 c. almond meal. Great!

Made this tonight, thinking kids would eat since potato chips on it. They loved it and so did my husband. Really easy to make, didn't have Italian dressing so used French. I would recommend this as a really quick family friendly recipe. Thanks!

Wow! You have to try this.  Absolutely delicious and sooo simple to make.  I baked some seasoned cubed potatoes along with it for a side dish so I kept the oven only at 425F and cooked the fish for at about 15 minutes.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly but I marinated the fish a bit longer than called for and added some fresh parsley to top it off.  Wonderful. Plan on making this again really soon.  Thank you so much for the recipe Karena!!

Simple but REALLY good. I used Petrale Sole for this recipe, turned out great. For the fish type used I decreased the temperature and cooked about 15 minutes. I eyeballed the other ingredients for measurements and used the suggestions from other postings.  Kettle brand Sea Salt/Vinegar chips and Chedder cheese. I also added a little garlic sprinkle and pepper to the coating. This was a great recipe, one we'll use again I'm sure.

I rated this 5 stars because not only is it really good, but it is very easy and quick to make.  Everyone loved this.  I made one change that I would recommend, I used crab flavored chips instead of plain.  The Old Bay flavor was a great addition.

This is great! I used sour cream & onion potato chips and ranch dressing. You can be creative and use any flavor potato chips or flavored crackers. I used frozen cod and had no problems with the cooking time. This is highly recommended!

What a GREAT quick and easy dinner! We have made this a couple times now and it's always good. We use about 2lbs of cod and it takes about 12 minutes to cook through. Even so that means maximum it's like a 20 minute dinner from start to being at the table, hot and ready to please. Thank you so much for a new weeknght staple!

Good, but wish I would have left it in longer than the recommended 8-10 min. I like my fish to be a little more dry.

Not so good.  I prepared as listed and the fish came out soggy and greasy.  The chips and cheesy became a gloopy mess.  My husband ate it, but he'll eat anything. Sorry would not recommend this one.

I loved this recipe.  
I used Pringle's Select Crisps, the Parmesan/Garlic flavor, and Fat free Ranch dressing, since that's what I had on hand.  I baked it at 450 for 11 min, and used tilapia fillets that were about 3/4 in thick.
Turned out perfect--flaked well, very moist.  My husband devoured his, and was disappointed that I hadn't made more.

A keeper.

This was a great recipe.  Super easy and tastes great!  It was a fan with an 8yr old that's a declared fish hater. 
I used Mahi Mahi (it was the only fish we had in the freezer)  and marinated it in Italian dressing for about an hour.
FANTASTIC!

This was really good. I marinated the fish in creamy Italian with peppercorns for about 15 minutes. I didn't have cheddar cheese, so I used mozzarella, and it worked well. I didn't measure the cheese though, so I'm sure I used more than 1/4 cup. I put the chips in a zip lock bag and rolled a glass over it & they crushed up just fine ... then when mixing the cheese, I smooshed it together. This was quick and easy. Can't wait to try it on other fish.

Good, quick meal.  As others suggest, I add more cheese & chips (or crackers).  My non-fish loving family eats it and loves it.

The entire family LOVED this recipe.  I coated very heavily with the creamy italian dressing and used the salt and vinegar chips, again coating fairly heavily.  I used Chilean Sea Bass instead of Cod, since that is what I had, and everyone said to make sure the fish wasn't too thick.

This is definitely and quick and easy recipe. I used salt & vinger chips but I think it was too overpowering. next time I'll use plain chips.

This was okay, but I think the fish I used was too thick.  None of the flavor absorbed into it.

Very good!  Used fresh cod/sprinkled a little lemon peper over it and added a little paprika to add a little color.  No need to add salt because you get the salt from the chips.  I was pleasantly suprised! Will definitely make again.

I really was not expecting to like this recipe, but needed different things to do with fish.  I was so surprised, this is really good.  I used creamy ceaser dressing though, and my kids loved it.
