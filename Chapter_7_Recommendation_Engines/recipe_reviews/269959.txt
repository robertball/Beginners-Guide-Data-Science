A little time consuming, but very tasty.  However, sometimes there is little too much bread ratio depending on how much you scoop out vs. the size of the meatball.  I would make again only make the meatballs flatter so they take up more space in the slider.  I did not change the recipe at all and it was great!

Made it twice first time with fontina cheese and 2nd time with gruyere.  My boys loved them both and my husband loved it with gruyere.  I used the hawaiian rolls because I like the sweetness the rolls add.  I was trying them out for an event next week.  I will cut down the last cooking time just till cheese melts, my oven may be too strong and both times they were a little more darker then I prefer.  Thanks for the recipe.

ALWAYS LOOKING FOR AN EASIER/QUICKER WAY, I skipped #2,3,4 on the directions & used frozen meatballs that I had simmered in Prego (with enough sauce to handle #7 as well enough to serve over pasta) until they were completely defrosted. For #6, I used a 12 pkg. of Hawaiian rolls, I lined the baking sheet with no-stick foil & greased same lightly, next time I will once again use the no-stick foil BUT grease it heavier as my roll bottoms were slightly darker than I would have preferred.  #7 Used Kraft Parmesan shredded cheese.  It was just two of us for dinner, there was enough for lunch the next day.  Very tasty. Try it!!!!!

They tasted great!  Long prep time for me.  Used King's Hawaiian sweet rolls and would use them again next time.

I made as directed for our super bowl party.  I actually made two, one with veggie meatballs and one with beef ones.  I had both and thought they were both excellent.  Some of the sweetness of the Hawaiian rolls gets lost when cooked in the over, next time I may just use regular rolls.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was awesome!  I have now made them 3 times!  I suggest Rao’s marinara for the sauce!

Only thing I would do differently, increase the size of the meatball. Other than that, you can tweak it anyway you want.

Turned out awesome, had to use premade meatballs. Sautéed onions and placed them under the meatballs which worked great. Also used Swiss  and a Italian blend for the cheeses.

Will make again as they are fantastic.

Super tasty! I used wheat rolls and Italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of plain. Plan on taking some to the next neighborhood party.
