Sprouts and chestnuts are naturals together.  Adding orange is a touch of genius.  Delish recipe!

This was good, but for the amount of work, not worth the trouble, because I like brussel sprouts anyway so it's easier to just steam them.  I would make this in the future, but not on Thanksgiving when there are so many things to cook.

I'm a big fan of brussels sprouts, so I'm always looking for different ways to prepare them.  This was delicious!  Now, if only I could get my husband to eat them!

I did not care for the taste. It may have been the quality of the orange I used. I do like the possibilty of an orange sauce and brussels. May give it a try with orange juice.

This was good, however in the future I will consider soaking the brussel sprouts in orange slices and juice the night before cooking. The orange flavour wasn't taken on by the sprouts the way I was hoping until the day after
