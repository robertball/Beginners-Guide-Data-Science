This was delicious, and less trouble to prepare than I had feared.  Next time I might increase it to three zucchinis, because there was way too much filling to fit in two.  I guess it didn't matter that it overflowed, though.  I'm wondering if I could use sour cream or plain yogurt instead of milk for a more stroganoff-like taste.  Mushrooms would be a tasty addition too.  I'll try that the next time I find zucchini (it isn't easy to come by in Taiwan where I live).

I had bought a ginormous (is that even a word?) zucchini at the 99 cent store and wanted a stuffed zucchini recipe that could be used as a main dish.  This recipe suited my needs perfectly and we all loved it.  I added an equal amount of panko crumbs to the Parmesan cheese on top to give it a little crunch.  Since the zucchini was so large, I doubled the filling ingredients, but it turned out I shouldn't have done that.  No worries, though.  I just put the extra filling in a casserole dish, topped it with the Parmesan/panko mixture, and baked it along with the zucchini.  The topping didn't brown very well in the oven, even after almost 30 minutes of baking, so I put it under the broiler for a couple minutes to finish it off.  This will definitely be repeated, but I think I'll peel the zucchini, dice it all up into the filling, and bake it as a casserole instead.

Very yummy, but I am not sure if I made the sauce right, it was more like a paste. I went ahead and finished and it tasted very good. Even my daughter, who is a very picky eater liked it. Thanks

This was incredible. and my husband ate his squash as well as the filling. (He's as bad as a kid with some of his eating preferences.).  I chose the recipe because it does not call for tomato sauce, which gives him heart burn.  I made some minor changes. I doubled the nutmeg and the garlic. Then, since the sauce was very pasty, I added an extra half cup of milk--much creamier.  My husband does not like the taste of parmessan cheese, so I used mild cheddar but mixed it in to the whole concoction before piling into the shells. Then, since I used BIG squash ( one that had gotten away from me in the garden),  I had to toss most of the pulp because the seeds would have been tough. So I took some nice small yellow squash, sliced it then and cooked it until just tender in the meat after the meat was all browned.  I also had some mushrooms I wanted to use up--maybe about 3/4 cup--so I tossed them into the meat mixture. Then I piled the whole mess into the shells, sprinkled a wee bit more cheddar on top and baked it for 30 minutes.  The combination of boiling and baking made even the skin on the large zucchini tender enough to be edible.  It was really good.  I think a person could use the base recipe and experiment with lots of different flavors.  I actually forgot to put the paprika in, but it was still awesome.

I was a little unsure about the recipe to begin with but was pleasantly surprised. My family really enjoyed it. I miss read the instructions and took the skin completely off instead of just scooping out some of the zucchini. I just turned it into a casserole with bread crumbs and cheese on top. Worked perfectly.

I live in Japan and since you wrote the temperature of the oven in Celsius it was much easy for me. I thought it was going to be complicated but it was not: easy, fast and yummy. I had all the ingredients! Couldn't believe it! Thanks !

Just made this recipe, and my Grandmother loved it.  I liked it a lot too, but it wasn't my absolute favorite.  Really I may just not be a big nutmeg fan, but it was still good.  Not a whole lot of work, actually fairly easy, but it does make quite a few dishes :).  Overall a solid four stars.

Was a little skeptical of this recipe at first with the nutmeg because my husband can be very picky about his food.  I LOVED it and my husband did too.  My 4 year old loved the filling, but is not very fond of zucchini.  Quick and easy meal.  Will make it again.
