A little too spicy for my liking but very good;  I added some lite coconut cream to cool it a little which worked well;  I would leave out cayenne pepper next time;  I do however recommend trying this recipe if you are a curry lover.

My family loves curry and this is no exception. It was a little too spicy, but it was really tasty overall and even I love it, as I'm not as big a fan of spicy as the rest of my family.
