I thought this was such an awsome recipe! The flavors are all very wonderful together. I followed this recipe to a T except I used almonds instead of walnuts that's all I had, and I cooked mine in a silicone muffin pan. I had a tough time figuring out the broiling part with mine, but they still turned out great. All in all my family and I loved it! My 4 year old asked for it to be his birthday cake for his next bday! Great Recipe!

Yum! Yum! Yum!!

Made these for my best friend's Bridal Shower that I both catered and hosted. She wanted to do cupcake decorating, and her bridal colors are Pink and Black. I tested this recipe the week before the party, and FELL in LOVE with it. Didn't even bother with the coconut topping, just made the cupcakes and they were DELICIOUS! I added red food die to make them pink, and EVERYONE loved them. By far the best vanilla cupcakes I have ever had!

These cupcakes were so good and easy to make!  I didn't make the coconut topping because I don't like coconut but they were just as good with regular frosting from the store.  These were much better than the store bought boxed cupcakes.  I will definitely make these again.

These came out way to heavy and not very tasty either. The topping was good but the cupcake itself was not. I was very dissapointed!

These were only ok for me. I did halve the recipe as it was just for my husband & I and we don't need to have 12 cupcakes around :) but I did it exactly in half (the site calculates it for you) and they turned out rather dry. I felt more like I was eating a muffin than a cupcake. The topping was interesting but again seemed like a muffin topping instead of a frosting.  You do have to be careful with the broiling- I did not spread to the edges as directed, thinking it would spread itself under the heat, but it did not, and a few did turn dark in that area, so I would advice spreading it out to cover the whole thing.

My 14-year-old daughter, who LOVES to bake, found this recipe (she was looking for a recipe with coconut, because we had so much left over from the holidays), and it was a HIT!  I am not really a fan of sweets, but I always "taste" what she makes, because she really is a great baker ... and I am telling you that these cupcakes are my favorite ... they are DELICIOUS!  She followed the recipe to the "T" (she generally does), except she omitted the walnuts, because she has a nut allergy.  She has made them twice, and they came out PERFECT both times!

I must say I was looking for a good buttery cupcake more than a sugary topping. I just made the cake. Maybe with sugary topping, but it does not stand on it's own.

"Your best cupcakes ever!" exclaimed the roommate.  "I love you even more" said the boyfriend!  And all because of these cupcakes!

Hints: Use the cinnamon in the cupcake bottom, otherwise they're boring.  Make sure you butter is warm enough to cream with the sugar.  Lumpy cake batter is going to make your cupcakes a crappy texture.

For the topping, you can spread it to the edge if you want the topping to melt into the paper and then catch on fire (extra hint: you don't).  If you grease the cupcake pans you can spread the stuff closer to the edges.  If you don't use walnuts (which you should, they were super-yummy) add more coconut, otherwise your topping will be a little too... buttery.  

YUM YUM

I made these today and I am not sure about the broiler part - I didn't "spread" the coconut topping part to the edges, like the recipe said, and the broiler burned the outer edges (where the coconut wasn't covering the cupcake part) after 1 minute.  We were able to salvage them, but they weren't pretty.  STILL A GREAT TASTE THOUGH.

I just made the cupcakes from this recipe (not the frosting) and they were delicious. Excellent consistency and flavor. I will definitely make this again for any vanilla cupcakes. Easy to make too.

Very good.  I adjusted a bit because I wanted to use more coconut in the cupcakes themselves, and I didn't really have the time to make the frosting--plus, I already had leftover frosting in the fridge.  So, I used the cup of coconut in the cupcakes, frosted with whipped cream cheese frosting, and then topped with chocolate sprinkles and some coconut.  Husband loved them, as did coworkers.  Thanks for the recipe!
