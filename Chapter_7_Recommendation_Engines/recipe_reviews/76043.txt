Good recipe and I prefer the corn starch to flour.  I have made this with 3 whole eggs as well--lighter texture, kind of dull in color.  I have a good tip--when the pastry cream is warm, put it through a mesh strainer and you will not have any lumps.  Works every time.  I put almost every type of custard through my strainer.

This is a basic pastry cream recipe. Pastry cream is exactly the same thing as cook and serve pudding, and was traditionally used to fill fruit tarts, pastries, cakes, etc. The woman who gave the recipe one star and was unable to fill her cakes with it clearly knows little about baking. Perhaps if you use it straight out of the fridge it will be thick and may tear a cake, but if you let it come to room temp there should be no problems. In either case, a torn cake can be repaired with buttercream. It just bothers me to see such a negative review for a recipe when there is absolutely nothing wrong with the recipe.

AWESOME!!!  Really, really good!  Ok, DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT, cut the sugar amount in this recipe. It is NOT sweet enough without all the sugar.  It's best with the called amount, I've tried both ways, trust me.  I didn't need to strain mine, no lumps. I beat the egg/yolks well with the corn starch and constantly mixed the egg and milk mixture while heating..lump free.  Great recipe!!!

This recipe was excellent...to avoid lumps i advise that once the mixture is put back in the pan to boil to start mixing it immediatly rather than waiting for it to start boiling before stirring...I used this as a filling for a cake and mixed fresh strawberrys in...definently a keeper!

I used this recipe for my first attempt at making pastry cream for a Boston cream pie.  It was easy and perfect! Note: Med/Lo heat and constant stirring with a whisk for any cream recipe is a must to avoid lumps.  I usually pull up a stool to the stove and turn on the radio :)

Advice from a beginner: If you have a GAS STOVE, try the DOUBLE BOILER method. Otherwise, a "low" fire didn't thicken the custard, and a "medium" fire curdled the eggs. On my third try I tried the DOUBLE BOILER, where I stacked a metal bowl over a small pot and filled the small pot with water just 1" under the bottom of the metal bowl. Cook the custard in the metal bowl by boiling the water below. Water level does NOT touch the metal bowl. I kept the fire on "low" and the custard thickened wonderfully. The custard came out over sweetened -- I would use just 75% of the sugar suggested.

All in all, I am thrilled that someone contributed this recipe. Thank you. Now I can make cream puffs for birthdays!

I made a fresh fruit tart using this pastry cream and it was excellent! It had an awesome flavor! I used the recipe for the french pastry crust that is posted on this site as well.  Those two combined with fresh strawberries and blueberries on top made a delicious dessert!!  I had a dinner party for a few of my girls and they loved it!  I am a frequent patron of this french pastry shop called La Madeliene and I am in love with their fruit tarts.  Well, I must say that this pastry cream taste exactly like theirs!!  I will be using this recipe time and time again!! Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe!!

I can't believe I fell for this recipe twice. The first time I made it, it ruined my son's, the second time my daughter's birthday cake. I was really disappointed by the "cream". It is not a cream at all, rather like a Jello Cook'n Serve pudding custard, by no means anything you would like to put in or on a cake or pastry. Once cooled, it cannot be spread without ripping the cake or pastry into pieces. Even the ingredients (milk, corn starch, sugar, vanilla, the egg and butter don't add anything to the texture) are almost identical to the Jello custard, which is prepared with far less effort. So, if custard or "pudding" is what you want, save the time and use Jello instead of this recipe.

I needed to make this non-dairy, so I used soy milk and margarine in place of the milk and butter.  It still turned out smooth and creamy!  I'm using it to fill a boston cream pie.  Yummy!

This is the BEST!  I rarely could make a pastry cream that didn't have at least a few "lumps" in it and I have tried several recipes, including my Mom's and grandmother's.  This one was perfectly smooth and had a wonderful custard taste.  I did fold in plain whipped cream for a lighter filling and used it in Cream Puffs and it was absolutely to die for!  Thaks so much for this perfect recipe!

Luscious  and rich, with clear cut directions and dependable results.  Certainly one to remember for the future.    I used this for individual dishes of vanilla pudding – layered Hubs’ with a Raspberry Melba sauce.  I kept mine plain and didn’t miss any embellishment at all, save for a little whipped cream.

I used this recipe to fill the middle of a Bundt cake (Jan's Chocolate Cake from this site) and it received rave reviews all around.  The pastry cream is decadent -- oh-so creamy without being too sweet.  It would also be delicious served warm over fresh berries or peaches.  Thanks!

Excellent!  Texture is perfect for filling, thick enough to add some buttercream frosting to it make what our local baker calls "Marilyn" filling.  EASY to make and tastes fabulous!  KEY TO NO LUMPS: Stir constantly with a wire whip after the cornstarch and sugar have been added, stirring quite quickly once it begins to thicken as it only takes a few seconds for it to come to correct consistency.  Enjoy!

I don't usually review a recipe if I have made changes but... I needed a filling for crepes with berries.  I had two guests that are diabetic.  I add granulated Splenda instead of sugar and it was delicious. substitute it cup for cup.  All enjoyed!

Fantastic! I added a cup of whipped topping to make it a little lighter so I could use it (along with strawberries) to fill crepes. Everybody said the filling was amazing :)

WONDERFUL! I was really worried mine would turn out with lumps, but I did the following and mine was lump free! 1) When mixing the sugar and cornstarch, stir very well to ensure there are no clumps before pouring into egg mixture.
2) Start whisking before and during the drizzling. 3) Start stirring the final mixture as soon as you place it back on the stove and are waiting for it to boil. Thanks for this great recipe - this one's a keeper!
PS - The amount of sugar this recipe calls for is great - just sweet enough but not too sweet!

My pastry cream came out too thick and slightly lumpy, despite whisking at all times mentioned by other commenters. I think I will decrease the amount of corn starch next time. I will also stick to egg yolks only, as I felt the cream tasted too egg-y. The cream did have a nice taste! UPDATE: I forgot to mention I used lactose-free milk, but I'm pretty sure this wasn't the reason for the lumpiness.

Great recipe!!!  It is perfectly fine with less sugar too, I don't know why others said it wasn't -- better even, as the original is really too sweet.  Very versatile too! Made some today with a ton of spices hoping it would turn out like a sort of eggnog pudding... wasn't quite that, and still a little too sweet so I added some pumpkin and voila!  Pumpkin pie pudding.  Makes a great fruit dip!  Plain recipe is also great with a Tb. of amaretto.

Yummy.  Used this recipe as a filling for my fresh berry tart.
I did make a few changes:  I used 4 egg yolks instead of using 2 egg yolks and a whole egg.  I omitted the butter, and I wanted a lot of vanilla flavour so used 2 teaspoons vanilla extract.
I did not have any problems with lumps, but I used a whisk and whisked it the entire time it was on the stove.
This recipe would be delicious in Boston Cream Pie, Cream puffs, or any kind of fruit tart.

This is absolutely brilliant and I keep finding excuses to make it! It's also really great with nut liqueur (like Nocello or Frangelico) in place of the vanilla extract. Thanks!

This is what I think: I licked the whisk. And I'm a grown-up (hoping nobody was watching). I don't know anything about classic cooking methods, but my husband (who was a foodie before I ever met him) once made pastry cream & it was a big deal that he still talks about now, years later. Well. Here I am this afternoon, needing pastry cream for a recipe... so, you know, I just whip this one out. No problem. No lumps! Just go slow and follow the directions.

This pastry cream has an okay taste, but the consistency is way off.  I always strain my pastry cream before folding in the butter, and first it didn't thicken on the stove, so I tried to see if I kept it on for a minute to boil (still whisking) it would thicken.. it didn't.  So I strained it and then folded in the butter.  After a few minutes cooling on the counter with plastic wrap on the top, it started to get lumpy.  As a baking and pastry culinary student, I will continue using the recipe I was given from my chef instructor.  Also I have never heard of anyone adding any egg white to pastry cream..

AMAZING!!! I used 4 yolks and zero whites because I find whites make it taste too "eggy". I also added a pinch of salt because everything needs salt. Used it as filling for a Boston Cream Pie.

After eating at Extraordinary Desserts and tasting very elaborate cakes with mysteriously layers upon layers I figured out one of the layers was pastry cream. I decided to make my own similar cake at home and whipped this recipe up. The only difference is that I bake with liquid eggs so I used whole liquid eggs (1/2 cup) instead of dealing with egg yolks. Turned out perfect and didn't have to bring it to a boil the second time because it thickened up quickly so I just did a lot of whisking to ensure it stayed smooth.

Mmm...tastes like Boston Cream doughnut filling. Would be excellent on homemade Danishes. Avoid using cream vs. milk as the heavier the fat content, the more gel-esq the cream gets, but still flavourful.

omg!!!!!!! who knew how easy it would be to make my own pastry cream and it was sooooo much better than a $6 bag.by accident, i added the egg slowly to the hot cream and sugar mixture and whisked my heart out and there was no need for it to boil and still had no lumps or cooked eggs. it thickened as i poured the egg in pretty quickly.

I made this EXACTLY as the recipe specifies, word for word.  It was delicious.  I did put it through a sieve because I had a few small lumps.  I refrigerated it and put the plastic wrap touching so it didn't form a "skin."  I used this as a filling for a "giant cupcake" birthday cake (as seen on TV) for my granddaughter.  I tinted the filling pink and put it inside a yellow "giant cupcake."  The filling made the dessert.  Without the filling, the cake would have been too dense... and it needed more than just the icing.  I was worried about having enough filling, so I added whipped cream (Cool Whip) to the pastry cream.  Thus, when we cut the cake, the filling was "runny" but the taste was terrific.  I just spooned the filling onto each piece and everyone loved it.  I was glad the children wanted more pudding than more icing!  I will use this recipe for other cream fillings and keep in mind that the whipped cream does affect the ability for it to solidify.  Thanks Christine for a great recipe and complete instructions!  FURTHER NOTE:  I've made this several more times and used the reviewer's hint of whisking constantly.  With that, I've had not lumps and the same delicious flavor!

this is almost exactly like the recipe i learned at school. straight into the recipe box :P. for those who have had trouble with lumps. when you add the cornstarch and sugar to the eggs, you must stir it immediately. the sugar can make the eggs lumpy if you just let it sit there. edit

i used it again for some banana cream pie, turned out wonderful!

Very easy to make and very good! I like the fact it doesn't require so many egg yolks like a regular custard would. Tastes just like creme brulee! I used it as a filling for two cakes I sold and customers loved it =) thank you!

My 1st attempt at Pastry Cream & what a super-duper success!I'm so thankful for everybody who has reviewed this! :) I made only 1 change to the recipe, & that was to use two whole eggs instead of 2 yolks and 1 whole.Another tip that I stayed very faithful to was to use an electric hand whisk.So whilst the milk-sugar mixture was boiling,I whisked the eggs & then added the cornstarch-sugar mixture spoon by spoon into the eggs antil fully incorporated.The result is that there's absolutely no scope for lumps!Also,I used the 'eggs tempering' technique when combining the boiling hot milk mixture & the egg mixture.I took about half cup of the milk mixture and added it in a very thin stream (not necessarily a continuous stream),whilst using my electric hand whisk all the while.I repeated this with another 1/2 cup of the milk mixture to increase the overall temperature of the egg mixture,before finally adding the entire egg mixture into the remaining milk mixture, once again whisking all the while.Once fully combined,I put it back on the stove for boiling, stirring continuously.You need to be very alert because it starts to thicken very suddenly, and if you aren't careful,you'll have lumps in your pastry cream despite all the hard work.Once it had thickened,I took it off the stove, & again used my electric hand whisk to whisk it well and ensure there were no lumps. It doesn't need to be whisked severely...just enough to ensure it's lump free.PERFECT!Thanks ChristiniBeanie!A keeper! :D

Really good recipe! For the filling i decided to use the Pastry Cream recipes on this site because it was from scratch and didnt require any pudding mix. Which by the way, is a WONDERFUL recipe. Really easy to make and tastes just like custard. Everything turned out perfectly and the eclairs rose quite a lot but when I lowered the temperature I also rotated the eclairs which was a mistake. Make sure NOT to open the oven while cooking  these because they will basically completely deflate. Other than that, This was a great recipe :)

I made it to use as a filling for boston cream pie that I made. It was pretty good, straight forward and easy. It did solidify a little too much too quickly for my taste though. The taste was great, no egginess or anything, but it felt like we were eating vanilla pudding. I was more looking for the somewhat runny and smooth consistency you find in the boston cream doughnuts. It was far from that unfortunately. If you want a good pudding recipe that becomes very jelly-like, then this is the reipe for you. Thanks for sharing!

I lost the recipe that I copied from an old Le Cordon Bleu cookbook, so I decided to use this. Very good decision. The flavor was identical; not too sweet, smooth, and it went well with anything I made.
My only problem was that it never thickened properly. I chilled it and tried everything I could, but it never thickened past a runny pudding.

Even after I goofed up the recipe (put all the sugar together with milk instead of 1/4 cup), it still worked out and tasted great! It was easy and I didn't have to use 12 eggs like the recipe I was going to use. I can't wait til it chills and gets put into the center of my red velvet mini cupcakes!

I made this with the three eggs, otherwise followed directions. Smooth, rich, sweet, but not too. My husband thought it delicious. I used it in some omelette/crepes I made, filled with the cream and strawberry slices, for Father's Day. He loved it!

This was a bit lumpy when I finished but it's going into a cake so it will not matter. It was quick to make and I would probably redo the same recipe for a cake filling.

I am french and this pastry cream reminds me VERY MUCH of the cream filled pastries in France! In France this cream is commonly found on mini pies ( 1serving size pies) topped with fresh fruits (strawberries, blueberry, rasberries...) that french people buy fresh at the bakery.  I made this recipe with 3 whole eggs.

Oh so yummy!! I used this as a filling for a cake with sliced strawberries on it. It was exactly what I was looking for. Just like the cream filling bakeries use for cakes. I had no problem with lumps. I did constantly stir this the whole time I was cooking. I didn't pour the milk mixture into the eggs, I tempered the eggs with a few tablespoons of the hot milk mixture and then just poured the egg mixture right into the pot on the stove. My mixture thickend up pretty quickly, only a few minutes after I added the eggs, which is why you really want to constantly stir to avoid lumps. For my 9" cake I only needed 1/2 a recipe, the whole recipe would be the perfect amount for a larger sheet cake. I will always use this recipe!!

As a master pastry chef working for a bakery which won the 2013 bride's choice award for best cakes, I have to say that this is a really great recipe. I have been using my own recipe for a few years now but wanted to try some other ways in order to reach that rich bavarian flavor. I noticed a few reviews saying this recipe is horrible and cannot be spread on cakes, this is not true and was obviously not done correctly. This is an authentic and original pastry cream recipe and should NOT be used as an icing or filling for cake without mixing it with buttercream or an icing of some sort, at the very least you could add whipped cream to make it more spreadable. Pastry cream is a stuffing commonly used for puff pastries such as eclairs or even french donuts. This specific recipe works very well with my Italian buttercream recipe for cakes (such as a triple vanilla creme brulee). I give this recipe 5 stars mostly based on flavor, but also how easy it was to make. This should be in every pastry chef's recipe book. Simply great!

VERY GOOD!  After using the flour method for years, I was happy to use this cornstarch variety.  To make it easier ... Boil your milk & sugar in the microwave in a big glass Pyrex measuring cup.  It will make it easier to pour the hot milk in the cornstarch/egg/sugar concoction.  I mixed my egg mixture in a sauce pan & then added the hot milk a bit at a time.  I stirred like heck while adding the hot milk & then put the final mixture on the heat.  NO LUMPS!

Technically this recipe is excellent - no lumps, a good consistency, and it set nice & firmly in the refrigerator.  I used it to fill chocolate eclairs, and it worked brilliantly.  
The only change I would make, would be to cut back on the sugar a touch; I was looking for that cool, vanilla-y hit in the middle of the eclair, to offset the sweetness of the chocolate, and this was a little too sweet.  It's probably a matter of personal taste though - if you're a sweet-tooth, make it as is!

This is delicious!!!! Even better with a seeded vanilla bean (along with some of the extract). Great flavor....not just plain sweet. I love to use it as a filling for eclairs. I always pass my custards through a mesh strainer to make sure they are extremely creamy and free of lumps, even if they don't seem to need it. I like to be absolutely possitive that it will be a completely creamy indulgence for my guests.

i found this recipe too sweet and too floury in texture.  i would just add 1/4 cup sugar to the egg mixture and not use sugar in the milk, and use 1/8 cup flour instead of corn starch.

Everyone at my sisters Christmas party LOVED it! I should've made a second batch because it was gone in minutes!  I put the pastry cream in little phyllo cups and garnished them with shaved chocolate.  So easy and so delish!

OK, but not quite rich enough for our taste, imo, needs more egg to be a classic pastry cream.  Also, if you're having trouble w/lumps, it's probably that you cooked it on too high a heat - cornstarch cooked over med-high will tend to lump.

This was super delicious, with the perfect amount of sweetness. One tip though: it was very lumpy even after whisking continuously while waiting for it to boil again. After I took it off the stove, I whisked VIGOROUSLY!!! That seemed to do the trick, as it was now smooth and creamy! I didn't know I could make this type of cream filling. I have always searched for one, and now I found the perfect recipe!!

This was pretty good flavor-wise, I made it as a filling for black magic cake and the flavors went well together.  I infused the milk with a whole vanilla bean instead of using vanilla extract.  My only gripe was that it still developed lumps despite sifting the cornstarch/sugar together and constant stirring throughout.  I think the trick is not only to stir constantly but quickly too especially when returning the egg/milk mixture back to boil.  Despite the lumps I stirred vigorously and managed to smooth it out for the most part.

This was good & tasty. But, I had lumps in it, even though I followed the directions precisely and read all the user tips - the lumps were unavoidable!   Additionally, the prep & cook time took MUCH LONGER than it states!!

Delicious!!!! This was very easy to make and has such a wonderful flavor! I was a little nervous making this since I have a tendency to burn things, so I measured out all the ingredients ahead of time and placed them in bowls so they'd be ready to add. I stired constantly and it turned out very smooth and lump free. :)

Great recipe!  My advice for a smooth cream/custard is to take your time heating and use a wire whisk.  I whisked mine constantly and brought it to a boil both times rather slowly....no lumps.  It thickens quickly upon boiling the second time, so keep a close eye on it.  A good custard takes time, but it's worth the effort....so much better than any boxed pudding/custard.  Thanks so much for sharing, Christine!

Best pastry cream I have used yet. I had ZERO lumps... absolutely perfect. Couldn't stop snacking on this while I filled my cupcakes!  I did use the double broiler method and whisked it throughout.  Pretty much yielded perfect results. Thank you!

This came out so well! The suggestion on how to add the hot milk to the egg worked like a charm. (I've always been told to "temper" the egg then dump it in an stir- it never works.) Thickened nicely and tasted great. I had intended to use it for a cream puff cake, but that didn't cook right. Instead I used it with vanilla cake to make a trifle- awesome!

Horrible, very blah. Next time I need a pastry cream/custard I'm going to use the coconut cream pie recipe base from this site submitted by Karen. THAT is great & can mix blueberries w/it for topping/filling.

4.5 stars! Do not decrease the sugar, but do add 1/8tsp salt. The salt will balance everything out. I particularly like this served warm on berries and sponge cake. Ignore the reviewers who say this tastes like Jello brand pudding; this has more depth than Jello will ever have!

Ive worked as a pastry chef and been to culinary school.... this is the recipe I tried when at a friends on vacation. She wanted to buy a coconut cream pie from the frozen section of the grocery store and I just couldnt fathom that, so I told her Id make her the best one she'd ever eat.  As it turns out its almost exactly the same recipe I first learned years ago.  The only thing I might add to directions is after it thickens and comes to a low boil. Reduce heat to med. and beat with wisk constantly for 2-3 min. this will reduce the starchiness and give it a velvety smoothness.  Its not overly sweet, so it lends itself to all kinds of variations.  I added half a can of CocoLopez and 1 cup of Bakers Angel Flake coconut to a double batch.  Topped with whipped cream, more coconut and finely chopped pecans.  Excellent!!

I made this today to incorporate into a trifle.  It was very simple to make, quick and delicious.  Like other reviewers have said, I tasted it before refrigerating it, and it was very difficult to not just grab a spoon and have at it!  However, willpower prevailed, and now it is layered with chunks of chocolate donuts, fresh strawberries, chocolate pudding and Cool Whip in a most delightful and incredibly tasty dessert :)

Exactly what I needed to fill my cake.  Not too runny, not too stiff.  I was worried while it was cooking, because it looked like it was getting lumpy, but I kept whisking and it smoothed right out.

This is an awesome pastry cream. I did halve the recipe (only used one egg) and used up some leftover rice to make "instant" rice pudding (I added some raisins). It turned out really good. No problems with lumps as I whisked the cream while it cooked- whisking is key to creaminess. I will definitely use this again.

Super yum! This recipe was really good and pretty easy. I used it it fill an airplane cake I made my hubby for his birthday. Worked perfect. I had no trouble with lumps or anything as others have said. The key, I think, is to continually and vigorously whisk the whole time it's cooking. I will be using this recipe again for sure. I may try folding some whipped cream into it next time for a little something extra.

Awesome, I made it twice my family love it. I made it with home made chocolate cake. I used the Pasty Cream as a filler inbetween layers. Then I made homemade creamcheese icing.  WOW. What a great recipe thanks.

This cream is awesome! I don't add the butter though..might taste better with it, but still very good! I used it to fill a cake. I'm also using it to make banana cream pie! Fantastic!

This custard is amazing, and exactly what I was looking for. It's rich and creamy and really easy to make, absolutely a recipe for my recipe book.  I used almond milk and soy butter in lieu of the dairy products with no difference in the final product.

This one is definitely a KEEPER!!  It turned out BEAUTIFULLY!  Couldn't have been much easier!  I did not have any problems with lumps (I did stir throughout), and the smell and flavor were just perfect!  I was expecting it to thicken more in the fridge, but it still worked beautifully for my purposes (perhaps I will allow it to thicken more on the stove next time).

Great recipe. I used 3 whole eggs and heated the milk up via the beverage setting on the microwave (2 cycles) and pastry cream turned out wonderful. Will keep this recipe and use again. In fact I want to make cream puffs and fill with this cream.

This was the first time I made pastry cream and it turned out wonderfully!  I ended up adding my own homemade whipped cream to make it lighter and sweeter.  I used this in a spin on an eclair using puff pastry dough.  Delicious and rave reviews!

It is very tasty, I found it too thick and a little too sweet, had to thin with more milk and I will reduce sugar next time. Used to fill cream puffs.
I have made it again and I halved the sugar, I like that better for filling cream puffs since the glaze is very sweet.

Excellent pastry cream, I've tried a few recipes now, and most of them are either too eggy or you can taste the cornflour.  It was a bit too sweet for my taste but thats just me.  I didn't have lumps just stood there using a whisk constantly on a lowish heat till it thickened.  Oh and I added some instant coffee granules to make it coffee flavoured, yum!

This is a great, fast and easy recipe!  I thought the sweetness was great when added with puff pastry and fruit.  It does take some muscle to whisk until it thickens, but it did so beautifully.  On my gas range, I used just above low heat and it took about 10 minutes to thicken and boil.  It's also nice to find a pastry cream recipe that's rich but doesn't use heavy cream or half and half.  I'm definalty keeping this one close to me when I'm in a pinch for dessert.

UPDATE: Made it again following the recipe exactly and I am thrilled with the results.  And a tip - pour through fine sieve to get a really smooth custard. Increased to 5 stars! FIRST REVIEW: (Original rating of 3 stars) Follow the recipe!  I made the mistake of making this in a double boiler and it took forever to thicken.  I should have brought it to a boil over low heat as stated in the recipe.  I am disappointed with the end product (can taste the cornstarch), but it's due to my own mistake.

Loved the recipe.  It was fast and made a delicious pastry cream for filling tarts and topping with fresh berries (then brush the berries with a glaze made of diluted apple jelly or orange marmalade).  I also have made banana cream tarts and coconut cream tarts with this recipe.  I used whole milk and also have made it with all whole eggs.  If you encounter any lumps, just whisk it quickly and they dissapear.  I actually 6X this recipe and filled several dozen tarts.  This recipe is a keeper.

This is really good! I used it to fill eclairs. I did it in a double boiler worked great, didn't have any trouble with lumps. I put the egg mixture in a mixer bowl and let the mixer do the stirring when i added the milk. worked very well.

Last time when I make puff pastry, I use Kevin Ryan Pastry Cream.  So this time I thought I would try this pastry cream recipe and I did not regret b'cause is also as good as the latter and it use less egg too.

The pastry cream is delicious. The following modifications of the recipe should give you a lumpy free pasty cream. To start, follow the recipe until the milk and sugar comes to a boil. Turn off the heat. Start adding one to two tablespoons of the milk mixture into the egg mixture while whisking the egg mixture until you have used about half of the milk mixture. Then slowly pour the egg and milk mixture back into the saucepan while whisking the ingredients and turn the flame on to a low to medium heat stirring constantly until the mixture thickens. Then add the butter and vanilla and transfer into a bowl and follow the completion of the recipe.

This is a fantastic pastry cream recipe. First, I must say, I have been making cake and pastry professionally for almost ten years. I have replaced my former tried-and-true recipe with this one, as this achieves the exact purpose that pastry cream serves. It's thick, not pasty, and sweet enough. If it seems too thick, after you cook it and chill it, you can just stir it with a whisk to loosen it up. You can also use whole eggs or just yolks. If you use whole eggs instead of yolks, replace every two yolks with one whole egg to make it a bit lighter. Similarly, replace one egg with two yolks for a creamier, denser custard.

The thickness of the pastry cream depends on how long you cook it. Before adding the eggs to the pot, whisk in about a third of the hot milk into the eggs to warm them, then whisk the egg mix back into the pot. Stir with whisk constantly (on medium-high heat, for me) till mixture begins to boil, then whisk like crazy (carefully) till it begins to thicken. Pull it off the heat when it looks just thick enough. Remember that it'll continue to cook slightly as it sits. If you want a looser cream, don't cook it till it's super thick in the pot.  

Whisk your softened butter in thoroughly. Don't leave streaks of melted butter. Mix in your vanilla (I use 1.5 t of bourbon vanilla extract) thoroughly,  and push the custard through a strainer. Always strain your custards! Even if you don't have curdled egg in your mix, it gives you a more refined final product.

I am a cake baker and decorator, making many cakes from home for people.  I have been searching for the PERFECT pastry cream recipe for some time, have tried many, they turn out OK, but just not QUITE right.  I was a little concerned with the whole egg in this, but it turned out great.  I actually cheated and used the microwave, as I was in a hurry to get it made so I could get to bed and use it first thing in the morning when cooled.  I heated the milk and sugar as called for, but in a glass bowl, then tempered the eggs before adding back into the milk mixture.  Only about another minute in the microwave and it was thickening, I whisked it every 30 seconds or so, then whisked really well before putting in the fridge overnight.  It was very thick in the morning, but I allowed it to come to room temp and then whisked really well again, and added a cup of plain whipped cream and it was AMAZING!!  No lumps, and no grainy texture that I have experienced with other recipes.  Will be the only one I use from now on.

Amazing recipe! I will be using this as a filling for a strawberry tart. It was very easy, and I was very happy that this recipe didn't require heavy cream, as my old recipe used. One tip that I have is instead of straining the pastry cream at the end, sift the cornstarch and remaining sugar into your eggs. I find this MUCH easier than pushing the pastry cream through the strainer. One more thing- I did half this recipe. Just estimate the 1/2 egg, and you'll be fine!

The ingredients are okay but the directions are sketchy unless you know what you're doing. The milk should not be brought to boil as it adds a scorched flavor. Heat it to just before boil, to simmer. Also, you MUST temper the eggs properly to avoid scrambling them.

The best pastry cream I have ever made. Has no floury taste and is great for all my cakes. I am from the UK and we have cornflour not cornstarch. After several attempts and reading up on the difference between the two flours you need to double up, so 1/2 cup of cornflour works perfectly, tastes wonderful.

This is nice and thick, but very finicky.  Takes forever to get to a boil, but when it comes together, it's the perfect pastry filling for cream puffs.  Very yummy.  I did a double batch because of the number of cream puffs I had and I think it would have been better to make 2 individual batches.  I think the time it took to boil was very much related to the volume of liquid being doubled.

This is an excellent recipe.  I used all of the ingredients but changed it around a bit.  I always put all of the dry ingredients as well as the milk & butter in the sauce pan & thoroughly combined.  I never use whole eggs when making pastry cream.  I used 4 yolks & lightly whisked them and set them aside.  In the sauce pan, I cook on medium or slightly hotter then medium until the mixture comes to a boil.  I move the mixture off of the heat and "temper" the eggs by taking a ladle of the hot mixture and drizzling it into the yolks slowly while quickly whisking the two together.  Then I whisk the egg mixture back into the pan and bring to a boil until thickened.  Transfer it to a bowl if  you wish for it to cool then put a piece of plastic wrap over the bowl but put it right down on top of the cream so it does not form a "skin".  Air will cause a skin to form.  If this happens, whisk it or use electric beaters to fluff it before use.  For a richer cream, use half & half or heavy cream instead of the milk.  If you do, it will most likely thicken quickly.  I will continue to use this recipe.

I'd like to say that this was delicious in a cake or pie but it never made it that far. Once it cooled it was devoured by 2 adults and 2 children. Would be perfect with some seasonal fruit, if it can last that long in the house. :) Yes, definitely a keeper, as is.

Absolutely to die for.......mmmmm.....I was licking the bowl, spoon, etc.  I did manage to get most of it into the refrigerator to set.  I served this with a choux pastry to my husband and he was licking his plate to the last bit.  A couple of drops fell to the floor and the dog immediately licked that up and was begging for more.

I realize that a custard is supposed to taste eggy, but this didn't have a whole lot of flavor besides that. I ended up adding about 5 times the amount of vanilla to it and it tasted much better to my way of thinking. I was using imitation vanilla, though, so that have been why I needed so much. Other than that, though, I thought it was great.

I thought this recipe was amazing.. very delicious BUT next time I will cut down the corn flour to one spoon!! The taste of corn flour was TOO obvious while eating and it gave it a 'weird' taste, but nevertheless it's delicious.

Yum yum! I strained my pastry cream too, but I didn't find any/many lumps. Only changes I made was to halve the vanilla and add a pinch of salt (along with using salted butter). Salt really helps bring out the flavor of sweet foods.

I used this as a Bavarian Cream filling for a cake and it worked wondefully! I personally have never really liked the way Bavarian/Pastry cream tastes, but this with the French Vanilla cake was delightful. Not really a fan of it by itself, but theat's just personal preference. :-)  To keep it from getting lumpy, I followed some of the other raters advice a stirred it with a fork until it was think. No lumps at all! ;)  Thanks for the recipe!

Followed recipe exactly.  Had no issues.  Next time, I will try seeping a vanilla bean in the milk for more flavor.  The consistency was exactly what I was looking for.

Delicious, and not hard at all!  I added 1 tsp artificial rum flavoring.  Good, but that amount was almost too much - would cut that in half if doing again.

I made this for a boston cream pie and it was great! I had a little extra, but did not mind. ;) I may have heated it too quickly when thickening, because it began to clump, but it mostly beat out when I immediately took it off the heat. Next time I will be more careful and I am certain it will be perfect- still tasted awesome and was a good first try. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this exactly as directed and it came out perfectly.  I used it as the filling to a Boston Cream Pie and it was a hit.

It came out just wonderful! I actually used flour instead of cornstarch. I also mixed all the sugar in with the milk and then mixed the milk in with the egg and flour mixture. I had no clumps and didn't even have to strain it. Tastes great. To minimize the "flour" taste I recommend cooking the entire mixture while regularly mixing it on the stove.

Followed directions exactly as written. Came out perfectly. Just like the eclair filling used in bakeries. Watch your milk mixture closely. As soon as it has lots of tiny bubbles, it's time to add it (SLOWLY)to the egg mixture. Also, Remove the cream from the heat as soon as it begins to boil, or it will get too thick as it cools.

I Love this recipe. I first made this 3 years ago, when I started baking for the first time and was a little nervous because of the other reviews, but it turned out beautifully on my very first attempt. I love using this as a filling in my cakes to help tame the sweetness of any icing.

The BEST pastry cream recipe I've found and I've looked all over the internet and in cookbooks. It's the perfect consistency and sweetness I was looking for. Other recipes I've tried have been way too eggy. The 2 yolks + 1 egg is perfect. It tastes just like filling in the Beard Papa's cream puffs in NYC that I love. When it's still hot, I like to run it through a fine mesh sieve to get rid of any lumps. I chill for several hours, and it comes out so smooth and delicious.

This recipe is awesome! Easy to make and tastes just as good as what you get at pastry stores. I used this to complement the Miniature Chocolate Eclairs in this website. Instead of using chocolate pudding as suggested in that recipe, I used this. YUMMM...

Try making this in the microwave!  I've made the Microwave Lemon Curd on this site before and it turned out really well so I thought I would try making this in the microwave also. I mixed all the ingredients, except the butter, in a bowl (dry first, followed by liquid ingredients) and microwaved on high at 1 minute intervals, stirring well with a whisk after each interval.  My microwave is 1300 watts and it took 3 minutes before it thickened up to the correct consistency. There were no lumps but I put it through a sieve anyway.

Delicious! I used 3 yolks instead of 2 + a whole egg, vanilla paste instead of extract, and doubled the butter for a richer flavor. Tip for lumps:put through a fine sive and cover with plastic wrap touching the top of the cream (allow to cool completely before using), or once removed from the stove put it into the bowl of a mixer and with the paddle attachment mix on low/med speed until cool (still cover with plastic wrap touching the surface though when storing).

If you are looking for an excellent custard filling for cakes this is the best recipe. It is very forgiving, easy to prepare and holds up well even in combination with fruit. I would highly recommend it.

Wonderful! I also made this dairy-free using soy milk and margarine. At first it tastes gross but once the vanilla is added in, it's delicious! Keep stirring. Don't stop stirring.  I used this for a fresh fruit tart.

This turned out wonderful! I can, however, see how people could have problems with this recipe if they have never made a custard type recipe before. A critical part I find to be missing is to temper your egg mixture with about 1/2 cup heated mixture before combining them all together, so you won't have egg chunks. Slowly pour in your 1/2 cup heated milk while constantly stirring, then take that warmed up egg mixture and slowly add this to the remaining heated milk, again while constantly stirring.

More of a vanilla pudding; I don't know that I'd call it a pastry cream. I had no real issues with lumps as I slowly tempered the egg mixture with about 3/4 cup of the hot milk mixture, whisking the entire time, and continuing to whisk as I poured the hot egg mixture into the remaining milk. I removed the pan from the heat as I added the egg mixture to the milk and once it was combined I put it back on the burner, whisking until desired thickness was achieved.  I removed from heat, whisked in the butter and vanilla, giving it a good blending, and it came out fine.  My only issue is the flavor--I find it to be a bit blandish, hence the 3 stars. Perhaps more vanilla?  This recipe worked up lickety split and worth a try and perhaps a repeat with the increased vanilla.

I don't rate too many recipes (not as many as I should anyway). But, I had to for this one. 
I've always used a flour based version because I thought cornstarch had a funny taste and was too difficult...boy, was I wrong.
This recipe is the best custard recipe I've ever tried. Easy, fool proof and so delicious! Made exactly as written and it was wonderful. Thanks so much for the recipe! Edit: Made this again today with chocolate added to it-splendid!

Taste is too eggy and too sweet for me. Next time I'll try with a bit less sugar and maybe cut one egg out.
Still it's easy recipe to follow.

I made this as a filling for cream puffs and it was perfect.  It's not as sweet as commercial pudding and pie filling and its texture is different, so keep that in mind when making it.  Be prepared to stir it for a long time as it slowly comes to a boil, but it's worth the wait.  I had no problem with lumps.  I had some left over and we just ate it as pudding later.

I made this pastry cream to fill Boston cream cupcakes, and it was perfect!! I didn't have to add any whip cream, because it was very light as is. I filled 24 cupcakes and only used about half of the filling, so I could have filled 48 cupcakes. I love this recipe!

I just finished making this. It was so simple!! Right now it's cooling in the refrigerator but I, of course, tasted a little bit before covering it with the plastic wrap and for me it was the perfect amount of sweet. I gave it 4 stars because as of right now it's not quite as thick as I want it to be BUT BUT BUT it IS still warm so I'm guessing (and hoping) it will thicken up considerably once it is completely cooled. I plan on using this between cake layers and I made my butter yellow cake so I think it will go beautifully together. Overall, great recipe!

Fantastic! Made this exactly as presented. Stirred constantly which made it very smooth. We have chickens that lay brown eggs, and their richer yolks gave the cream a wonderful, rich yellow color.

This is a really good basic recipe to make "as is". It was a little sweeter than I expected, but delicious nonetheless. The only adjustment I made was to strain the pastry cream once cooked. This was my own fault though, because I left it on the heat a *little* too long and it got a bit grainy, but a quick straining fixes that right up.

This is easy and has a nice thick consistancy.  You can add any extract you want to achieve a different flavor.  I tried adding 3 rounded tablespoons of cocoa powder to the cornstarch mixture but it needed more for a bigger chocolate flavor.  Next time I would add 4-5 tablespoons or even try adding melted chocolate in at the end when you add the butter and vanilla.

Wonderfully creamy...just keep whisking over medium low heat and you won't need to strain anything.  I did use less butter as a personal preference and it was excellent.

I make this cream for anything that calls for it. (ie. cakes, crepes, etc.) I don't heat the milk and sugar before adding in the egg/sugar/starch mixture.  I just combine them well and heat slowly.  I stir constantly as it thickens.  Don't leave out the butter in the final stages as this is what gives it that perfect rich flavor.

This was much easier than I thought it would be and turned out great! It is still chilling in the fridge but I tasted it while it was warm and it was perfection. It could probably use a tad bit more sugar, though. I had the idea of making a pumpkin cream and will try that next using this recipe. Thanks!

Yum! Tastes like yummy vanilla pudding! I made White Almond Wedding Cake from this site & layered it with this pastry cream & a strawberry filling.  The only change I made was using 2% milk.  Very good!

This cream is phenomenal!  I used it in a layer cake with fresh strawberries for a friend of mine's baby shower and everyone loved it!  My kids couldn't get enough of the leftovers so I had to make more!  Very creamy and just the right amount of vanilla and sweetness.  You could use it for any filling or just on it's own and you will be happy.  I did not change a thing in the recipe.

YUM.  I made it non-dairy, using soy milk.  You can taste the difference, but it's still incredible.  I used a whisk for all the mixing and got no lumps.  I didn't have corn starch; I used potato starch instead - no problem.  Thank you!

I made it dairy-free too using soy milk & milk-free margarine (probably better if I had used part butter-flavor crisco & vanilla flavored soy milk).  I did think it needed a tad more sugar and a tad more vanilla, but was a great filling for the napoleons I made.  It is a must to whisk/stir constantly.  I didn't need even a sieve to get out the lumps.  Thanks for the versatile recipe.

This pastry cream was for my first attempt at a Boston Cream Pie. It was pretty easy to make and set up nice and firm between my two cooled cake layers. It isn't too sweet and overwhelming, either.

Delicious, simple, and FAST--it took a little over 10 minutes in the kitchen.  I used this cream with strawberries in a layer cake.  You can also make a softer version by reducing the corn starch by a teaspoon.

Perfect! This was exactly what I looking for. I served it as a filling in crepes with some berries for dessert and the taste and consistency were right on. I took the advice of others and stirred it like a mad woman after returning it to the heat, but it still clumped as it thickened. I think maybe the trick is in whisking the corn starch into the sugar so the corn starch isn't in little clumps to begin with. The lumps really weren't noticeable though. Great recipe!

Mmm. I've been making this for a few months now and it always turns out perfect. I stir it with a whisk instead of a wooden spoon and never get any lumps and it always ends up incredibly smooth. I cut down on the sugar a bit, and it turns out great. I usually use two or three whole eggs instead of one egg and two yolks... I use it for everything- puddings, cake fillings, eclair filling, tart filling, pie fillings... the list is endless. Any time a recipe calls for instant vanilla pudding, I use this instead and it improves any recipe...
I have some in the refrigerator right now that I'm going to use tonight for some trifle!

This really was amazing! It tasted amazing and was the perfect consistency that I was looking for. I mixed with just a little whipped cream for fluff and filled cream puffs with it. ( the recipe from this site - amazing) I would highly recommend this recipe!!

This is a very rich and creamy recipe. I used vanilla bean once it was finished, then I let the flavors combine for a few days. It taste even better two days later, really!! Never go by what it taste like the first day. This is a very yummy recipe, its a keeper!!

This is a very simple recipe that's quick to make. I love it for eclairs and cream puffs.  I used 3 whole eggs and the consistency is just terrific.  Not too sweet either so it doesn't compete with the other flavors.  I'll use this recipe again and again!

Absolutely delicious!  I added a brick of cream cheese and a jar of nutella and used it to make chocolate hazelnut cream puffs.  To die for!  The nutella was so sweet though that I cut back the sugar a bit.  The girls in the office are still talking about them!

This is a very good pastry cream for fillings, trifles, or just as pudding. It is improved by a bit of salt (about 1/4 tsp), especially if you use unsalted butter.

taste is not bad, but I still got lumps. So MAKE SURE TO STIR, STIR, STIR.  Stir quickly at very low heat, otherwise it gets lumpy fast.  Remove from heat as soon as it begins to thicken, and stir.  Taste wasn't what I thought it would be, but it's still tasty.

I love this recipe and have now used it several times. I do add homemade whipped cream into mine for a lighter cream texture. I've also added lemon extract to the cream as well when using it to fill lemon cakes and it's a crowd pleaser - I get raves of compliments everytime!

I used this recipe twice, both times to fill king cakes for Mardi Gras. It works beautifully for this purpose. My friends love it, especially topped with chocolate on the cake instead of the traditional sugar topping. It was an eclair-inspired king cake!

This recipe worked great. I whisked all of the sugar and cornstarch together. I whisked the eggs and milk together and blended it into the sugar/cornstarch. I brought it to a boil on the stove while whisking. Cooked until thick and added butter and vanilla paste. It’s so rich and delicious. I’ll mix in some whipped cream once it cools for my cream puff filling.

This was quick and so easy as written. I sifted my 1/4 c sugar and the cornstarch together before adding it to the eggs, and the end result was that the pastry cream was silky smooth perfection! The only substitute I might be tempted to make would be to cut down the sugar a bit, and use Vanilla Bean paste instead of Vanilla extract for a more potent Vanilla flavor. Thanks for sharing this quick & easy basic version!

This was excellent! Perfect pastry cream like you get in bakery eclairs or Bavarian cream donuts. Tip: once the milk comes to a boil, remove from the heat and drizzle into the egg mixture with a ladle, whisking constantly. After two or three ladle-fulls, it's ready to return to the milk in the pan, again whisking constantly. Return to the heat, still whisking, where it will thicken quickly. Perfect texture and sweetness...thanks for the great recipe!

So easy!! I read the recipe and then all of the comments so I was really prepared. I made sure to set out all of the ingredients first so I was completely ready because this recipe moves a bit fast towards the end. I followed the recipe to the T, making sure to stir the milk mixture into the eggs in a slow and steady stream. I thought my arm was going to fall off for a second there :)
It’s a great, easy recipe and I can’t wait to add it to my mini lemon strawberry cakes.

I kinda wanted to change things up a bit so I steep ground coffee in the milk (deathwish coffee) used about 1.5 tablespoons with about 1.5 cups of milk, when it came to making it I cut the chocolate powder to 2 tablespoons and at the end it turned out awesome, I could have eaten the whole bowl of it alone 5/5 this is my go to pastry cream recipe

I had never made pastry cream before.  In a moment of weakness, I agreed to make a dessert for a friend and offered to make miniature fruit tarts. Seriously, I was up at night worrying about the filling. This recipe was delicious and came out smooth and creamy. I simply followed the directions exactly and was so relieved when it turned out! I was high-fiving myself for my accomplishment, but really, this recipe deserves the credit. Yum!

Great ! Easier then expected. Follow as is, it's perfect .
I cut recipe in half, still perfect. Thicken up quickly.
*I used for the cream in a chocolate raspberry trifle.
(Did add some Half and Half before using in my trifle, just for the consistency wanted)

I LOVE this recipe, I have made this several times. I mix the sugar and cornstarch together before adding it to the egg/ milk mixture.   I also put all my custards through a mesh strainer.

Add 4 oz cream cheese when you add the butter, then chill and fold in some whipped cream, you’ll have the best filling ever, I also used vanilla beans and made it for cream puffs.  It does have a little to much cornstarch.

This is a perfect" Cream Pat "recipe. The ratio of eggs, sugar, cream and cornstarch is just right.
After you combine the egg mixture to the scalded milk it cooks really fast on medium heat.

I loved it! I'm fifteen years old and managed to make a decent cream with barely any help! It tasted a lot like creme brûlée, though? Not that I'm complaining. Overall a great recipe and my mom loved it.

This recipe is great, however did the following;
First, this type of cream with corn starch thickener, be sure to fully cook, whip should be leaving full trails behind it
- used organic coconut sugar, fully replaced white sugar
- used two whole eggs- no added yolk etc
- For flavoring, used a little ('real") maple syrup and maple aged spirits (Southern Tier Distilling), basically rum made with maple sugar
- used butter melted on top to prevent "skinning" while cooling
- added about one tablespoon sour cream to cooled cream to make a little richer
- placed GF Snickerdoodles in bottom of pan, place half of cream, then sliced bananas
- place balance of cream on top of bananas
- top with real whipped cream

First time making it and NO LUMPS! It's a very thick, creamy filling that reminds me of doughnuts from the corner shop as a little kid.  I had no idea I was eating culinary perfection at such a young age...and now?! I can freaking make it all the time!! Made these to fill my eclairs I just made for the first time.  My kids LOVE to watch baking shows and we decided to try choux pastry! (I should probably preface this with I made macaroons first try:) and the eclairs?! Perfect! I didn't change anything, used low heat on a professional gas stove (it's a beast, my husband loves to cook) and whaaaLAAA!! Kids first day of school breakfast?! Yeah. Eclairs and cocoa.  They are only young once!

So delicious! Just a few notes when making it. First of all it takes a bit longer then I personally expected for the pastry cream to thicken while stirring it in the saucepan. The first time I made the cream, I didn’t let it thicken long enough and it turned into a liquid. Second note (this doesn’t actually have to do with the recipe), I put the pastry cream in some bread rolls and topped them with chocolate icing. REALLY GOOD AND HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!

I made it the first time, it came out perfectly, the second time I made it, it looked like yellow milk, so I made it a third time and it came out great again, the only thing different between the second and third time was that I made sure the milk was whole milk (not lactose free), I whisked the milk until it was frothing and half way up the saucepan, I also keep whisking the egg mixture more too and I introduced the milk to the egg mixture very slowly.  So making sure your milk is really boiling and whisking both all the time while cooking is essential. There weren’t any lumps at all.

I've made this recipe 7 or 8 times and it came perfectly every time. It's pretty much foolproof If you follow the steps. I use this to make fruit tarts, and the custard is the perfect consistency and flavor. 1 recipe is also the perfect amount to fill a crust. This has never curdled and always comes out smooth. I whisk it again after it has been refrigerated, but I've never had to strain it. The only change I made was throwing a cut vanilla bean in with the milk to flavor it, and I scoop out and add the vanilla beans at the end. I've tried our several other recipes and always had issues with lumps, so this is the best, easiest one.

I could eat this by the bowlful! Really, any dessert with crème pâtissière is my favorite, and this did not fail me for flavor. I, likewise, pressed mine through a mesh strainer to make sure it was velvety smooth. I used 1 tsp Heilala vanilla bean paste for the lovely flecks of vanilla.

I think it is a touch sweet on its own. It would probably pair well with som fruit that was maybe a little bit more on the tart side. I added a little salt as well which I didn't see the recipe call for and this helped as well. I used the double boiler method when i finished cooking it off on the stove. Worked perfectly. Thickened up beautifully.

I am going to culinary school. We were taught how to make pastry cream but I lost my recipe somewhere sink decided to use this one. It works perfectly! We were taught to use a whisk the whole time to keep lumps from forming. Instead of pouring he hot milk into the eggs use a ladle to scoop it k to the egg mixture a little at a time and then once the eggs are warmed up pour into the pot and whisk. You can’t tell it’s done when it has (as my teacher said) the lava plops. The bubbles coming through are like thick lava bubbles that plop when they get the surface. Cut the butter into small cubes and it will melt faster.

This is a really good recipe.  My older custard recipe used flour, but this recipe is creamier.  I think that using a double boiler is THE way to go for any pudding or custard recipe, so I never have to deal with lumps.

As a first timer at making pastry cream this recipe was so easy! I put it through a sieve at the end to make sure there were no lumps and stirred in some whipped cream to fill my doughnuts. It was so delicious, will definitely keep this as my go to recipe!

I used Half and Half, natural sugar and added spiced rum for my trifle with fresh berries. I cooked it in the microwave and used my electric whisk. Perfect! Might cut down a bit on the sugar next time

I didn't have any cornstarch so I used flour (double the amount of cornstarch), but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly- WONDERFUL vanilla pudding- which is what I was looking for :) This is going to be my go to recipe now for pudding.....can substitute brown sugar for white to make butterscotch, or add chocolate chips and baking cocoa to make chocolate pudding.....really, really yummy!

This as my first time making pastry cream.  I plan on using it in Napoleons I am making tomorrow. I think the recipe came out well! It was easy and seemed to thicken nicely. Perfect level of sweetness. I added a pinch of salt because I think adding a touch of salt helps bring out the flavor. Would make again

I almost didn't use this recipe because of a bad review. Glad i didn't listen! Very very good recipe! Lots of flavor. Use high quality vanilla and follow directions. One thing missing is a pinch of salt. You ALWAYS add a tiny bit of salt to desserts to bring out the flavor.

It made for a really good custard (because that is what a pastry cream is) but it is best if it is cooked slowly at medium or medium-high on the stove top.

This took my husband 10 minutes to whip up, we were out of corn starch and used potato starch instead. He mixed the starch in with the sugar and therefore had almost no clumping. We did not need to strain it and it thickened up nice and quick. A keeper!

I love this. Custards are my mortal enemy, for the first time ever I made pastry cream on my first try.  Looking forward to strawberry crepes with it later!  Thanks for sharing this.

Used 1% lactose free milk, added a pinch of salt, and skipped the butter.  Delicious!

This turned out way better than my last attempt at pastry cream.  I did add a pinch of salt and used unsalted butter. I also let the milk cool to under 145 deg. (the temp at which eggs start to cook) and used my kitchenaide on slow speed with the wire whip to incorporate the hot milk into the eggs. Way easier than trying to slowly pour the milk into the eggs and whip at the same time.

It turned out good. I made it for filling up donuts. It took me about 45 mins constantly stirring the mixture under low heat in order to make it thick and creamy.Plus, it also didn't boil since it was on low heat. Could i increase the heat a bit and stir constantly so that maybe it will thicken up faster ? 

  Also, the  custard was too sweet. All the other ingredients seemed to be in the right proportions but next time i would lower the sugar. Nothing else is wrong with the recipe

This custard came out great- I used it to stuff homemade Long Johns. I have attempted custard creams from other recipes in the past, and failed 90% of the time. If you are a beginner, do not be daunted! This special part about this recipe is how specific it is. If you follow all the directions, there is almost zero chance of screwing up.

First time making this and I loved the texture and almost the taste. I felt it was too sweet for a filling. I tasted it before and after the butter and it still was too sweet. I will adjust the recipe. But no lumps. You need to whisk the heck out of it when you are mixing the egg also after the butter.  Very easy recipe. My Mom -in-law's birthday she will be 96 on Nov 2, 2016 and she will love the cake and attention. Happy Birthday Mom and to all the ladies in your senior years.....

OMG SO GOOD! I'm very glad I chose this recipe. I haven't made custard since home ec class in 6th grade. I made it to fill in my son's first birthday cake. I refrigerated it a few hours and it was so sturdy! Was GREAT cake filler. Filled some white sponge cake with this and strawberries and also did some custard filled cupcakes with strawberries on top and they were DEVOURED and raved about. Thank you!!

I made this pastry cream to be used in a large tart shell which would then be covered with fresh fruit and glazed. I doubled the recipe since the tart pan was double sized. I used lactose free whole milk in this recipe which was undetectable in the finished product but very appreciated by my stomach.  Instead of heating the milk over the stove, which I find tedious, I heated it in the microwave to the requisite 185 degree temperature and then proceeded from there to incorporate it into the eggs. From there it went into a saucepan for the final heating. It was excellent and very easy to make.  The next day when I went to fill the tart shell, a quick stir with a whisk made it smooth and spreadable.

I agree with the other 1 star rating...this tasted like jello  pudding, and had the same consistency.  Not the buttery, rich texture I was looking for.

This was almost great. I did it exactly as written- but I wish I had put it through a strainer as others had suggested. The lumps seemed unnoticeable until I was actually eating the pastry with this cream in it. Next time I'll strain it and I think it'll be perfect.

excellent excellent recipe it was super easy to make no lumps because I stirred constantly and the texture and taste was awesome I did add extra sugar and fresh vanilla bean. I work in a professional fine dining restaurant where I make pastry cream quite a lot but I didn't have my recipe book with me at home and I needed to make it for a cake really quickly. The colour is a bit dull but that was fine because I use the pastry cream to make moussline creme by just whipping some room temperature butter into it after it was cooled. I wanted a rich creamy filling for a strawberry cake.

Excellent recipe, which I followed exactly and even though I had to make it 2 days before I needed it, it was perfect.  There were no lumps, however, I avoided that risk by mixing some of the hot milk in with the egg mixture before combining it all in the saucepan.  I would note that this is a Pastry Cream as the name says.  It isn't a cake filling.

It's OK for what it is. I would have liked it heavier, like a Bavarian Cream- I'd add another egg yolk or two if I ever made it again. The amount of vanilla is so strong that it tastes kind of fake in some way.

I just wanna say this is a great recipe. And to that lady that gave it one star and says you can't spread it clearly knows nothing about pastry cream. Pastry cream is thick and needs to be piped.

I absolutly love this recipe! The more times you make it the better it will taste and the easier it will become. The first time I made it I followed the recipe to a 'T' it was super yummy and everyone loved it, however being a baker I could taste a little egginess and the vanillia was a little over powering but like I said I still really loved it. So, the next time I made it I added more sugar and a cap full of vanillia the sugar balenced out the Van and the Van ballenced out the egg and it was amazing. I very much so recomend this recipe it is now my go-to for fillings. So Yummy... TIP make sure your really careful when tempering the eggs, wisk wisk wisk as long as you do that it should be smooth and creamy.

Very simple but really delicious. The key to having it super smooth is to start with low heat while whisking briskly and then turning the heat up little by little while continuing to whisk. Yes, it takes awhile for it to thicken but the end result is  worth it. I took it off the stove the moment I felt it was thick enough. I never  allowed it get to a full boil.

Thick and creamy, I loved it! Used it to fill cream puffs, but I added some rum extract and whipped cream to lighten it. (Which I highly recommend, its nice on its own but a couple dollops of cream make it so fluffy!) To avoid lumps in your end product you can strain it after heating , which makes all the difference. It was a bit sweet for my tastes, but I think it's pretty perfect.

I made this for the topping of a cake I made for the Holiday party at work.  It was delicious.  Because I was using it as a topping I wanted it to be a little litter so i whipped some heavy cream and folded it into the recipe.  Lightened it up a little and I got a lot of good reviews on it.  Also won some cash for my dessert... Thumbs up

I made this using the corn starch. I needed it to be slightly thicker to use for a Boston Cream Pie so I added about 1/2 tsp more cornstarch. It thickened nicely and was a huge hit. Everyone loved it. I'd definitely make this again.

this turned out great with no lumps.  I used 2 eggs instead of 2 yokes and I egg because that's all I had...LOL.  Next time I will put in lemon rinds like my mom use to make.  You put in the lemon rinds while the milk is heating up, then remove them before you put in the butter and vanilla.

A worthy recipe. As it was it was too thick. I adjusted by removing a yolk and substituting half the cornstarch for flour. I also combined the thickening agents into the cold milk and sugar before heating. Excellent after that.

Made as written with whipped cream folded in. Eggs did not curdle but texture not smooth. Put it in graham cracker crust then topped with fresh strawberries. When completely chilled the texture was surprisingly creamy. Tastes delicious!

Personally i like this recipe with everything, it's very good as a desert with fruits. The secret for the lumps is to mix the butter with the flour/ cornstarch, and to add the milk bit by bit. That's how my cooking teacher taught me, when i was studying cuisine.

Delicious bakery worthy cream! Made this to use as filling for the Cream Puff Cake recipe from this site- perfect! Wondering if I could make it maple flavored for the fall, maybe use maple syrup instead of sugar, might have to try it!

Yum!
My first time making custard.. Followed instructions and it came out beautiful.
Did reduce sugar to 1/4 + 1/4 and it tasted great for me. Might even reduce a tad more next time. But recipe's a keeper surely!

This recipe is exceptional for texture and ease of making it.  I still gave it 5 stars even though it's a little sweet for my tastes, but that's not a reason to give it less stars.  I am going to whip heavy cream and fold this in as soon as it's cool for a filling for cream puffs cause I like my filling a little lighter.

This recipe is the jam. I added rum and ground cardamon as flavoring and used it in a Napolean and it turned out delicious.  I didn't follow the method however. I put all the ingredients in a heavy bottomed pot except for the butter and flavoring and brought to a quick boil whisking the whole time over medium high heat (gas stove). Once thickened I strained the custard base over the butter and flavoring, whisked till incorporated, covered with plastic wrap and let it cool overnight. The flavor is better next day.

Great recipe! I did however use only the small amount of sugar, used potato starch (not potato flour) instead of corn starch being most certainly a GMO engineered product, I dissolved the starch in enough water to make it runny, mixed with the eggs,, removed the milk from the heat for a moment before adding the egg mix, then back on the medium hot burner, stirring constantly until thickened. Bingo! Oh, and I substituted some of the milk with whipping cream and I used a real vanilla bean (sliced open to release the black seeds, cooked with the milk then removed before adding anything). Hard to fail with this recipe.

This is a great recipe, I sieved the cornflour with the sugar before adding to the eggs and it didn't seem lumpy. When I was stirring it the second time in the saucepan, it was really watery and then rapidly thickened. I sieved the mixture twice, it tastes great, used with strawberries and a sweet shortcrust pastry! Thanks!

I did this for the first time ever and it came out pretty well. I used light coconut milk (lactose intolerant) and egg substitute. Yeah I had my doubts. I think next time I will make sure to have everything right next to the stove so I will not miss a beat of stirring and whisking because it wasn't as smooth as I think it should have been, but all in all it tasted great. After cooling in the fridge for about 3 hours I put it into a graham cracker pie crust and topped with fresh blueberries and strawberries. Yum

Thanks for posting this recipe, and thanks to everyone who commented-big help. I found this to be a very easy, quick and delicious pastry cream! I wanted something different than vanilla ice cream to put on top of apple empanadas. I made this quickly subbing vanilla with 1/2 a vanilla bean (seeds only), folded in whipped cream - guests loved it. This is definitely a keeper! Thank you!

I made this last night and it turned out excellent! I folded in whipped cream and used it for the filling of a pastry similar to the Napolean (or mille-feuille). It was easy, 100% lump free and delicious! My custard-obsessed husband couldn't get enough! I left it in the fridge overnight before folding in the whipped cream because I began preparing it quite late and was too sleepy to wait for it to cool! It was much firmer in the morning, more gelatinous even, but just needed a good whipping up and that brought back the velvety consistency. Excellent recipe, I'll be using it lots!

this was really great XD
Whenever i've had home made custard it's always had gross egg pieces in it but this one was great! I have a gas stove and I took the advice of another review and uses the double boiler methody thing XD it took a bit longer(an hour)but it tasted amazing and was completely smooth

I have never made pastry cream, but this recipe made it easy.  I was worried about it scorching... So I went very slow with a low flame.  It thickened in chunks but after a while it reached the same consistency, and a few tiny bubbles told me to take it off.  

Mine was lumpy despite all my mixing... So I gave it 30 seconds w my Immersion blender.  It's perfect!  

Thank you!

First time making home made custard. Omg, it was sooo good. I made it using 4-5 egg yolks, no whole egg. Great way to use up egg yolks after making macarons. Used this to fill custard puffs. Ate the leftovers as it is. =D

Absolutely perfect! I followed the directions and ingredients to a T and ended up with perfect custard that tastes fantastic! I did not boil the milk actually I let it get hot to the point where I thought if it got hotter it would burn. Then when I cooked the whole mixture again it only took a minute for it to come together and turn into a custard. I will use this recipe every time!

I really enjoyed this pastry cream.  Like a couple of the others, I find it a little sweet and will use slightly less sugar next time.  I will use less in the milk, but leave the same amount that I mix in the eggs.

To the woman who thought this tasted like vanilla pudding, I REALLY want to know what pudding you are buying because I want it!  I've never had pudding this good.

It is thick, but I've worked in a bakery and it is no thicker than the pastry cream we used there.

I did not use a double boiler and had no issue with scorching or getting it to boil.  I did stir constantly.  I also had no issue with lumps, I think the key to that is getting the sugar, cornstarch, egg mixture very smooth.

Thank you for this!  Perfect for my Boston Cream Pie!

I've been searching for a bavarian-type cream for years! I'm so glad I found this recipe to use for fruit tarts! I used a double boiler (a pot of water with a big bowl over it) because I wanted to be sure not to curdle the egg. I usually do even if I temper it) Plus I used only egg yolks (so that would equal 4 egg yolks total) Added vanilla and almond at the end. Beautiful! I put it in the fridge and tasted it the next day. It was very thick and a perfect combination of flavors! If anything I'd scalle it back an egg yolk to thin it slightly. Keeping this forever!

I prepared this recipe exactly as written and it turned out amazing!  I used the custard/pudding as a bavarian cream ingredient in my breakfast crepes.  I placed about 1/2 cup of the pastry cream along the middle, dropped fresh blueberries, raspberries and cut strawberries on top, folded it into a burrito shape, sprinkled with fresh squeezed lemon and dusted with powdered sugar! Awesome!!
I did not use a double boiler, I stirred the ingredients very thoroughly before putting back into saucepan for second boil, not perfectly creamy (I had some slight lumps)but honestly, no one cared, it tasted so good!!
Was worried about difficulty, it was not difficult at all.  You have to try this!!

Awesome Recipe!  I was asked to make a Fruit Tart for clients from Italiy and this reminded them of home.  No issues in making the recipe.  One note, make sure to stir immediately once everything is combined and you are boiling a second time.  It doesn't take long for this pastry cream to come together at all.

Vestalia- I used to work as a baker and used a very thick pastry cream recipe much like this one. Heres a trick of the trade so you wont tear the cake, if you beat the pastry cream before using it it will soften and be much much easier to spread onto things like cakes and tarts.

great pastry cream recipe. For all of you who are getting lumps, there are a couple of way to prevent lumps. Have a good wisk and constantly wisk it while its on the heat. If it still comes out lumpy for whatever reason, put it through a strainer.

This recipe should be called "Custard." It tastes just like custard. This is my first time making custard. I've been looking for a custard recipe since I started baking. I've tried every recipe that was labeled with some type of "cream," and none of them turn out to be custard! This was my last hope...And it turned out terrrriffffiicc!!! It tastes EXACTLY like the custard you'd often find in doughnuts, cakes, pastries, etc. Also, this recipe is great, because it is almost impossible to make a mistake.

I'll have to keep trying at this sort of thing. I used soy milk and kept everything else the same. Texture seemed fine, no lumps, though I really like to make "pretty" food, and this did not look pretty to me at all. Not too creamy either. It's probably just how I did it, I'm sure I'll be able to make this turn out the way I imagine it with time and practice.

This was easy and very good.  No lumps at all.  I'd hoped it would be more like custard, but it wasn't.  More like a very mellow, yummy creamy pudding.

This is good warm, but I haven't waited to try it cold, yet.  I am using it as a filling for a cake.  The taste was good, but if I was to do it again, I would do it in a double boiler, because even though I heated it slowly, I was getting lumps in the custard toward the end.  I was going to strain it, but then just used my immersion blender.  Next time, though, I will use a double boiler.  It was pretty easy, so hopefully it sets up well and will be useable as a filling!  :)

Delicious and simple to make. I used the pastry cream as a filling for Boston cream pie. It's very versatile. I will definitely be making it again.

Quick, easy, great consistency.  Used a bit of almond flavor along w/the vanilla.  Came out smooth..just keep stirring and quickly.  Doesn't take long to thicken up!  If you do end up getting lumps...just push through a seive.

This is a great cake filling recipe, as long as you are adding some other ingredient.  I mixed peanut butter cups with this and it was fantastic.  The cake and icing recipe I used were really strong so I wanted a filling that was light to mix with the pb cups...awesome however I would not use it on its own as a filling.  After I started making the recipe, I realized I was out of cornstarch.  Surprisingly, bread flour worked great!

Made my first and quite possibly last Wedding Cake using this cream.  (my last because it was SO much work and extremely stressful!)  This cream is perfect, and so easy to make!

i used this recipe for a variant on nigella lawson's victorian sponge cake filling/frosting (how to be a domestic goddess cookbook). i usually ice the cake with a whipped diluted cream cheese frosting but forgot to pick up the whipping cream. this worked so well that i will use this every time.

MMMmmmm. this was amazing. Thank you!
I didn't change a thing, the sweetness was just right. I used it as a filling fir my strawberry shortcake. It was awesome. It's in my "its a keeper" recipe book for the best pastry cream recipe ever.
Thanx again!

This cream turned out great--very tasty. However, I found that it tastes even better  after a few hours in the fridge. I used this as a filling for cream puffs; it was a hit! Just be sure to stir stir stir while thickening.

I made this for my family as a pudding and they loved it. I added 1/2tsp strawberry extract (artificial). I also made it again with evaporated canned milk and it made it a little creamier. Love this (I plan to use it to fill a cake)

Creamy & Yummy! Quite EZ to make and very tasty indeed. I did everything as per recipe but it's actually way too sweet for my taste bud and I have to add  1cup of cream cheese to reduce the sweetness. (just beat the cream cheese until light & creamy then add the pastry cream mixture and refrigerate) The result is fantastic.. Thank you for sharing!

This tastes exactly like the pastry cream used by the local cake shop.  I had to strain it but I blame it on my inexperience than the recipe.  I'll definitely make this again!

So yummy!!  I made this recipe and used it in a banana cream pie, everyone raved about it!!  Great flavor and not too much work!! Will definately use this again!

Update 1/17- I continue to make this recipe for all kinds of desserts- trifles, cakes, cream pies, etc.  One thing to know is that the recipe makes a very very small amount.  I doubled it and made a few individual trifles and didn't have enough.  I'd recommend multiplying the recipe by 3 or 4x if you want a good amount.

I reduced the second addition of sugar from 1/3 c. to 1/4 c. hoping to make this recipe slightly less sweet, but it was still disgustingly sweet.  Not a bad recipe, but I think next time I will reduce the first addition of sugar to 1/8 c. and the second addition of sugar to 1/8 c. or so.

Very pleased with how this turned out.  I used a little less vanilla because the brand I had was pretty poor quality and tends to overwhelm whatever I put it in, but it worked perfectly in the eclairs I made.  One thing I noticed is that it tasted even better after sitting overnight (not just until chilled, but a good 10 hours or so).  This will replace my former recipe of vanilla pudding.  Thank you for the recipe!

realy easy to make for first timers in baking. But i thought that it didn't taste as sweet as i thought. I put it with a simple white cake, with fluffy white frosting so I guess it complimented the custard. A big keeper.

Absolutely divine pastry cream. I was rather fearful of making this, but it turned out to be easy. Made this to fill my cream puff shells from this site. If I can do this, everyone else would find it simple too. Thank you for sharing.
