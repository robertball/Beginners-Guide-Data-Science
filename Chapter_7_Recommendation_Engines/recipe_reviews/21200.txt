Very yummy- would be good on a crisp autumn or winter evening. I made the soup with only roasted acorn squash and it was very good; I'm sure it would be even better with butternut squash. This recipe is very flexible: I used chicken broth instead of vegetable stock; I didn't have any tart apples, so I eliminated them from the recipe; and I used white wine instead of sherry. I also didn't have curry powder and added a different aromatic Indian spice called garam masala. Don't be afraid to add a lot of cayenne, or to double the recipe (make sure you have a big pot though). The overall dish is not too spicy or Indian flavored; rather, it is warm and creamy with very little fat. The wine or sherry really add flavor. It's an easy recipe if you have a food processor to puree everything. Make a salad while the squash roasts (perhaps with some figs, nuts and crumbled cheese) and cut up a hearty loaf of bread. When you serve the squash soup, you could even add a dollop of some cheese. I sprinkled on parmesan, but a creamier cheese like goat or cream cheese would compliment the texture of the soup.

Verona’s recipe is delightful. You’ll get excellent results if you just do everything per her notes. It’s a beautiful golden yellow colored dish, with good tummy warming flavor. First note: As written you get a bunch o’ soup, almost a gallon in my case, so, if you build the full recipe keep this in mind. Might be a very good idea to change the serving size to smaller level before you print it all up. Verona’s very specific in her squash types. Personally, I find that as long as the squash types are all yellow, you’ll come out fine. Big note: Please, anytime you cook squash, do it in the oven, just as Verona suggests. If you boil squash you not only pull all the water-soluble vitamins out of it, you pull the sugar. You’ll be amazed to find that if you cook squash properly, it’s so sweet you NEVER add sugar, syrup or whatever. You see “add sugar” constantly in squash recipes, and honestly, it’s ridiculous. Try roasting it just once, and you’ll almost certainly agree. Oh, great “guy recipe” here, dudes. It’s not only virtually bullet proof but it has a Manly Mess Rating of at least 7 out of 10.

I peeled and sliced a butternut squash in half and roasted it along side a bulb of garlic, one onion quartered and 1 red pepper sliced up.  I brushed the veggies with a bit of olive oil. When everything was done I pureed them together with my hand mixer (braun multi-practic) and added chicken stock.  It tasted really good at that point with all of the roasted vegetables but I also added a 1 tablespoon of mild curry paste and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and let it simmer for 10-15 minutes.  I served it with a small dollop of sour cream.  It was delicioius!

I can't believe I'm just now getting around to rating and reviewing this soup. From the first time I made it, it has been my favorite. At the end of cooking, I add a pint of heavy whipping cream to give it a more creamy consistency. It is lovely. When I just made this I just used acorn and speg. squash. I also add several carrots that have been cooked till soft. You could actually add sweet potato or pumpkin to this as well. It would all work well with the flavors. Just work with what you have or what you can find. I think leeks in lieu of onions would also be very nice. I do up the curry and add a bit more cayenne and garlic. Just keep playing until you find your perfect flavor for your family. We tend to like things with a bit more kick and flavorful bite. 

This is great with baguette and a nice salad. Try it with the pear and roqfort cheese salad from this site (can't remember the proper name of that recipe, but it is wholly wonderful with this soup).

Lastly, I much prefer this recipe room temperature, rather than heated. It is just my preference. It is also nice topped with cilantro.

I received many praises for this recipe from my boyfriend and his friends, who before tasting, weren't sure they even liked squash. A few changes I made: 

1. Left out the spaghetti squash and used the suggested amount of acorn and butternut. 

2. Substituted Gala apples for Green. 

3. Substituted Sherry with a white wine. 

Don't leave out the apples, they really make the flavor. Great recipe! I will try it again, making subtle variations for variety.

Loved this!  I used 2 acorn squashes, since that is what I had instead of the spaghetti or butternut, and I upped the curry to 2 tablespoons.  Also garnished with a couple of tablespoons of snipped cilantro per bowl. Presentation was great, and the flavor combination was unusual and wonderful. Lovely!

Worth the time.  Fun to roast squash and the aroma can't be beat.  Not everyone would like this soup but I enjoyed it very much, as I love curry, etc.

I thought this was a very delicious soup!  I roasted butternut, acorn and spaghetti squash to make this.  The recipe makes a pretty large pot of soup, so be prepared for leftovers.  It has a delicious nutty, mildly spicy, cider flavor to it.  My husband and I really enjoyed it.  Next time I will just make sure to puree the squash a little more so there are no lumps or strings from the spaghetti squash.  I will also probably use 1/2 cup of sherry instead of 2/3 cup.  Very good!

Really tasty recipe.  I gave it four stars because I would have liked it to be a little smoother, but that might be from something I used instead of the recipe.  I used gala apples, butternut squash, acorn squash and a frozen winter squash puree I bought at whole foods.  Five stars on the taste!

This soup is simply wonderful!!! I did substitute a few things though, but not because it needed just out of necessity. They substitutions were as follows: only used 2 types of squash as that was all I had and used roasted sweet potato as well, used turkey stock instead of vegetable, used garam masala insead of curry, added some nutmeg, used sweet crispy apples (ambrosia). YUM!

This soup didn't seem thick enough to me. I used 5 lbs of butternut squash (2 large squash), 6 apples, 4 pears and 9 cups of chicken broth and it was still not what I had hoped for. The flavor was okay - definitely used fresh ginger for a more full bodied taste - the ground ginger just doesn't cut it.

Wonderful! I made this according to recipe, with minor changes based on what I had on hand. I used homemade chicken stock instead of vegetable stock and dried ginger instead of fresh. I only had 2 cups of chicken stock, which I think accounted for the thickness of my batch. It's perfect for chilly nights!

My sister & I are just starting up a catering business, and I have made this on two occasions.  Both times it rec'd the most compliments of all the dishes we prepared.  As other readers comment the recipe is very flexible, so adjust according to your taste - I prefer lots & lots of ginger, sherry, and curry...yum!!

I simplified this recipe and used a 5.5 lb butternut squash, 1 red pepper and 1 large purple onion. I cut the above vegetables in half and removed the seeds from the squash and pepper. After coating with olive oil, I roasted in an oven at 400F for about 45 minutes. After cooling, I removed the skin from the squash and cut it into smaller sizes that could fit into a blender. I added about 5 cups of vegetable broth to the vegetable chunks so blending went very fast. I added a teaspoon of curry powder and a pinch of white pepper as spices and simmered this for about 15 minutes on the stove. I gave this to my wife, who had a mild summer cold and it seemed to alleviate her symptoms. If you're on a low sodium diet, consider making the vegetable broth from scratch (it isn't that hard) or use low sodium vegetable broth. Regardless, this is a very simple recipe to prepare. I will definitely make this again.

Yum!  I chose this recipe to test drive my first ever farm share, and after reading all the reviews for extra ideas.  I used a honey nut squash and a delicata squash, my first time ever for these, substituted a leek for an onion (also first time), olive oil for butter (on principle), added a potato and yellow and red carrots, used local green apples, and instead of ready made curry powder, added lots of cumin, some turmeric, fenugreek, allspice, and chili powder.  Also as a matter of course, I add more garlic and fresh ginger than recipes call for.  White wine instead of sherry -- although I think sherry has merits of its own and want to try that next time, and used a quart of broth.  Would like to experiment with goat cheese or yogurt as garnish on subsequent tries.  Thanks to Verona and the folks that aren't afraid to experiment, this seems to have unleashed a creative cook from me instead of someone who has to follow word for word, measure for measure as i did the first 50-some years...

I adapted this based on what I had at home & it came out VERY good.  I used one delicata squash, cut in half & cooked (face down) with some water on the bottom of the pan about 40 min. I also used 2 sweet potatoes--peeled, cut into 1" squares, and cooked in the microwave with some water until soft, about 10 minutes each. I used one apple & one pear. I used only 4 cups vegetable broth--I got the fifth cup of liquid from the stuff with the sweet potatoes.  Lastly, I used white wine rather than sherry. If you like sweet & spicy soups, you'll like this a lot. One more thing: the prep time is more than 10 minutes, more like 25.

This is absolutely GREAT- I can't give this recipe enough praise. I used only spaghetti squash. It wasn't tender at 45 minutes so I flipped it over and broiled for another 5 minutes until it started to caramelize on top.  It still wasn't done so I had to finish it in the microwave- another 5 minutes. [I cook a lot of spaghetti squash and have found the easiest way to cook them is leave them whole, pierce a few times with a knife and bake at 350 for and 1 hour. When it's cool enough to handle, cut it in half and scoop out the flesh.] I only had marsala wine and it worked well with this dish. I also added 1/2 tsp turmeric. Can't wait to make this again!

really delicious! I get a bin of local produce each week, and was able to pretty much use all the contents in this soup: carrots, sweet (and a few red) potatoes, onion, apples, squashes and roasted japalanos (left in the seeds for an extra kick) and roasted garlic  - for those who don't think its thick enough, just dont add as much broth - will definitely make again!

I used chicken stock and garnished each bowl with a sprinkle of cayenne for presentation.  Everyone loved it.  My husband who doesn't like veggies loved the soup.  I've made it twice already and even froze some.  It's a keeper.

This soup is great! Whenever I make it, people want the recipe. Just a few changes, use only butternut, use 3 cans of chicken broth, and before serving I pour about 1 cup of half and half into the batch. Sometimes I serve this with sour cream on the side with fresh cilantro. Just a few ideas. So yummy!!! Thank you for this recipe!

I was looking for a vegan soup recipe for fall and on basis of stars, picked this one.  Followed it to a t except using EVO for butter.  Smelled divine, but found no depth to flavor.  Guess I was missing the dairy that I chose to leave out for my lactase-deficient friends.

I added a bit more spice (black pepper and curry powder) at the end, served with a dollop of heavy cream in each bowl and everybody loved it! Best response I've had from a dish in a long, long time.

next time use real garlic.  I used the canned minced garlic and it was not good. Also, next time try chicken broth instead of veg broth. I used pumpkin instead of butternut because that is what I had. I also used white wine instead of sherry.  Turned out okay, but defenitly not 5 stars. I hope to try this again with the butternut squash and other suggestions.

It's ok. I had to add a bunch of different spices to get it to taste more rounded. I'll save it in case I happen to have these ingredients on hand again at the same time, but I don't plan to make it again otherwise.

This soup was amazing! I did substitute white wine for the sherry because I didn't have sherry. The flavors all come through without anything overpowering, but it is so much more complex in flavor than other squash soups. Our whole family loved it!

I thought this soup was great and so did my meal co-op group. Great way to use up some squash in the fall and I made it and froze it and it is a great thaw out meal in the freezer with some biscuits! I made it with madeira and some cumin and six pepper blend since I was out of curry and I thought it was great! I am making a huge bunch of it for the next couple of days to freeze up and last me until next squash season!

A great tasting soup perfect for the winter. I used the acorn and butternut squash I had on hand together with a sweet potato I also cut in half and roasted. Topped off with a dollop of sour cream and this was a great meal.

My husband and I loved this.  I used buttercup (not butternut) squash only, used homemade applesauce that I had lying around instead of cooking and pureeing apples with sherry (this speeded up the process), and added buttermilk, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ground black pepper.  Roasting the squash makes all the difference!!

This is my first attempt at squash soup.  I read through all the recipes and this one sounded like it would have the taste I was craving.  I was not disappointed!  Roasting the  3 kinds of squash, the sherry, apples, ginger and curry, all gave this recipe a complex flavor, with nothing overpowering. I had a 4-cup box of broth, so I used half and half for the other cup of liquid. I don't like to mess with a recipe on the first try, but next time I make it I won't change anything anyway. Thanks, Verona, for a great recipe.

Excellent taste. I forgot to buy green apples and used fugi instead, but it still had a great taste. I don't usually like curry powder, but the combination of flavors is very complementary. My coworkers commented on how good my lunch smelled.

This soup is absolutely delicious and as one poster said "very flexible".  I followed the recipe with all the required ingredients and added more sherry as was also suggested.  I also added two hot chili peppers that I chopped finely and sauteed with the onions, etc.  I was generous with the other spices, too (left out cayenne pepper).  It is delicious with a kick!

It was so good.  Using all three kinds of squash is key.  I used Cullinary broth with curry flavor. It gave it an "indian" flair.  Really good but I cut back the curry to about 1/2. Yum.  My family thought is was a little too spicy.

This soup was awesome.  I roasted a butternut and 2  types of acorn squash, sauteed onion with garlic, added a good heaping Tbsp of red thai curry paste and cooked that for a minute, poured in a can of coconut milk and added a medium sized yam to the pot.  I forgot to bake it with the squash.  Topped up with water to cover peeled and chopped squashes, added 2Tbsp chicken Better Than Bouillon paste, a splash of Kirsch as I didn't have any Sherry or wine in the house and some black pepper and a pinch of red pepper flakes.  Added 2 chopped apples (Gala & Ambrosia)and cooked until they were soft. Puréed soup in batches.  Served soup with banana slices in soup bowl and a dollop of reduced fat sour cream on top.  Yummy! A bit of an Asian twist on this curry soup.

Loved this!  Used all butternut (adjusted amount to account for all three types of squash) and chicken broth as that was what I had on hand but otherwise followed this recipe to the letter.  High marks from me, my husband and our 3-year-old son as well.  A crowd pleaser for sure!

Excellent! I used spaghetti squash and zucchini (that's what I had here). Instead of blending separately, I used my immersion blender. Really, really easy - and really, really good!

I shared this recipe with my housemate because we wanted to make a soup out of about 2 cups pureed pumpkin and 3.5 cups cooked spaghetti squash we had left over from a dinner party.  Using that as the base, she made a half recipe of this and it turned out great, I really love the apple in it.  Maybe a little more curry and/or cumin would kick it up a bit more.

Wow!! I also had to use what I had on hand. I used a butternut squash, done as per directions. Apples off my tree. Roasted garlic, ground ginger. chicken broth, and a red onion round out the substitutions. The soup really turned out excellent. It really hit the spot.

Thank you for the recipe.
I could not use butter, but used sunflower oil instead. The rest i did as written. 
I used less then 4 cups of broth.. So as i was blending i added as i felt needed to puree.  (Had 1 small butternut squash, 1 small acorn squash.. one more more i don't know the name, but also small)
It's delicious.

I had to modify recipe to eliminate butter, onions and garlic.  I added P.C Chipotle Oil to the three squashes as I roasted them. I used chicken broth and simmered the green apples, a carrot, and the spices including the sherry  - was generous with Sherry ;-) 
Spices: ginger paste, nutmeg, salt, pepper, cayenne pepper and curry.  I added the squash and simmered for about and hour.   Needed to add more broth to make more liquid.  
Served with chunk goats cheese in as garnish - OMG it was incredible!!! Nice kick I think from Chipotle Oiland cayenne pepper and I didn't miss garlic at all!!!

I loved it but I was the only one. My daughter can't take ANY spice so I had to forgo the cayenne and only used a dash of medium curry powder. We also had a few extra left over roasted Korean sweet potatoes from the corner store so I peeled and threw those in too. I don't have vegetable broth so I used the left over broth from the Hainanese Chicken.

This was very good, but I had to make a few adjustments. I only had spaghetti squash, so I sauteed carrots & red peppers, then threw in the onions & garlic. I then used 1/2 cup white wine & 2 chopped up apples, they weren't the tart ones. For spices I used curry, ground ginger, 7 spice, cayenne & some dried parsley. Mixed this and the squash after it roasted all together with only 4 cups of of chicken stock instead as I did not have any vegetable stock. I pureed all together in my food processor, a few cups at a time, then put back in a pot on the stove. I made fresh bread with this. So delicious.  This was yummy & spicy!

Delicious....It's fall and I am roasting vegetables again especially squash.  The only change I made was to use all buttercup squash and a bit more curry powder.  I also added a touch of cream after I pureed the soup for a velvety texture.  It's a keeper.

This soup is amazing. Easy to make, great comfort food, and healthy too. I have been making this soup for about 3 years now, and I always look forward to the time of year when acorn, spaghetti, and butternut squashes come into season.

Delicious. I roasted 2 squash & one zucchini together with a small carrot, the onion and a head of garlic. Next time I will do the onion and garlic as in the recipe. In step 4 , I mixed everything together and cooked for 5-10 minutes before I did the purée. Would definately do this again.

This actually tasted better before we added the curry mixture.

This is my absolute favorite fall recipe!!!  I have been making this exact recipe for a couple years now.  I do make 2 small changes through... 1) I use more types of squash and make larger batches, and 2) I use chicken or turkey broth.

Squash soup of any kind is one of my favorite fall soups. I liked this recipe a lot... though I had to substitute some things... I only used accord squash; II didn't have sherry, so I used red wine; I didn't have fresh ginger so I used ginger powder.. things like that. But, it still turned out delicious. When I roasted the squash, btw, I sprayed olive oil on it and sprinkled a little coarse salt as well. And, of course, I used a couple of more garlic cloves  than the recipe asked for:) All good.

This was incredible. I used a bunch of different squashes from my CSA and 1/2 tsp. hot curry powder and 1/2 tsp. garam masala. Also added 1/2 cup heavy cream right before serving. Will definitely make again.

This was very good and it's a good thing because I was working with a 15.4# butternut squash (only).  I increased all the ingredients x5 except kept the apples at 2.  Nice autumn recipe!

WOW this soup is amazing! I followed the recipe exactly, except that i ran out of veg broth and had to use 1 cup chicken broth. I was able to puree everything in my vita-mix in 2 batches, quick and easy. 45 minutes was the perfect time for the squash to roast for me. the tops were nice and caramelized and the flesh spooned right out. There is a wonderful balance of sweet and savory in this soup. Don't leave out the Cayenne, i used about 1/8 tsp and it's not spicy at all just gives a little extra oomph to the curry. I'm going to take the advice of other reviewers and freeze some and add goat cheese when serving. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for a great recipe!

AMAZING. I am eating my second bowl right now, with rosemary potato bread. Perfect blend of spice from cayenne, ginger, and garlic combination. Can be made vegan easily by substituting oil for butter. I used sweet apples instead of tart because that's what I had on hand, will try green next time :) COMPLIMENTS TO THE CREATOR!!!

Really yummy.  I had some leftover roasted squash (butternut and acorn) and turnip in the fridge, and this was a great way to use it up.  I'm not sure I used the exact same ratios as the recipe calls for, but it's just soup, so I'm not sure it matters.  :)  Love the curry flavor, and the sherry.  And the little bit of cayenne.  I added a dollop of greek yogurt, and ate it with a nice hunk of bread.  Really tasty....highly recommended.

Very tasty, especially with some goat cheese sprinkled on top. I would use fewer apples next time because they made it a little too sweet for my taste.

I choose this recipe for my very first experience cooking with squash.  A sweet soup, not spicy. I used an ice cream scoop to take out the innards, that was simple. wondering how necessary pureeing broth was, but it was nice to 'cleanout' blender, a tip mentioned in another review here.  I subbed vermouth for sherry, a roasted yam for the spagetti squash.  When i taste it it feels like something is missing, very good...it just needs something...
