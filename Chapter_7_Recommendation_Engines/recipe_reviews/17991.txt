I didn't give it 5 stars 'cause I made changes based on others' suggestions that I felt improved the recipe.  I halved the peppers (lengthwise), sauted onions separately along with 2 minced garlic pieces, cooked the rice separately, used 1 can of DICED tomatoes* (why would you ever buy a can of tomatoes and THEN dice them?), and mixed the ingredients together after browning the beef**, allowing them to warm slightly in the skillet before stuffing into the peppers.  You can use the extra juice from the can of tomatoes to keep the rice from burning.  I also added quite a bit of basil, oregano, and Italian seasoning, as well as extra Worcestershire sauce.  Putting just a little cheese in the bottom of each pepper helped as well.  Lastly, I only used one can of tomato soup.  Even cut in half, 25 min was needed to get them nice & hot.  Next time, I'll try adding some pepper as well.
* Using a can of diced tomatoes with jalepeno peppers adds just the right amount of kick to these!  **You can also use 1/2 beef & 1/2 3-7% lean ground turkey to reduce fat content...tastes the same!

great recipe. I cut the amount of rice in half. Only thing I would change is at the end. Fill in the peppers halfway with the beef mixture. Add a bit of tomato sauce and fill up the rest with beef mixture and top with tomato sauce again. The problem with only topping off the tomato sauce at the end was that it did not "seep" down as I expected it. So the top only had the tomato sauce and the bottom did not. Without the tomato sauce, the beef was kind of bland.

Wonderful! My whole family enjoyed these.  I'll definitely make this again.  I used ground turkey instead of beef, and a can of petite diced tomatoes w/ liquid instead of whole toms.  Used Arborio rice as that's what I had in the pantry.  Added minced garlic to the meat mixture. I substituted 1/2 C. of beef broth instead of plain water. Used 1 can of tomato soup & 1 sm. can of tomato sauce w/ a TBS or two of Spaghetti Sauce Seasoning.  Excellent, healthy, and much better than the stuffed peppers I had as a child.  I think that par-boiling the peppers before stuffing them was key to the texture and flavor.

I have made these several times and they have been perfect everytime with some little adjustments.  I double the worcestershire sauce, add garlic with the onions, put the cheese on top of the stuffed peppers, and use tomato paste instead of soup with about a tablespoon of lemon juice.  Fabulous comfort food and very healthy!  Note: I have also used both ground chicken and turkey and also had great results.

These were the best stuffed peppers I have ever had. I only made some minor changes. I used 5 peppers instead of 6, and there was just barely enough filling. I used onion powder instead of onion, tomato sauce instead of tomato soup and beef broth instead of water for the rice. I also added another half cup of cheese, but I don't think a little more would hurt. They taste even better the second day.

Yum yum!  I've never made stuffed peppers before.  These were great!  I used ground turkey instead of beef b/c we're trying to eat healthier.  Used Uncle Ben's converted Rice, in my opinion it is the best rice in a box.  Used a large can of diced tomatoes, undrained.  Did not even use tomato soup, I don't think you need to.  After stuffing my peppers with the mixture, I just placed them right side up in a greased 9x13.  Biggest tip - boil your peppers for a good 5 minutes in the beginning, before stuffing them, and make sure they are fully submerged beneath the water.  If not, you will likely end up with pretty raw, crunchy peppers even after baking, unless you like to eat them that way.  One of my peppers was like this, it was the one that never got submerged when boiling. The main thing I love about this recipe -  you get your meat, starch, and green veggie all in one shot, and it is delicious and healthy!  Thank you.

I don't like green peppers but hubby loves them so I had to give this a try. He raved about this one! I did add a tablespoon of minced garlic to the meat mixture and put grated sharp cheddar cheese on the tops of the peppers during the last five minutes of baking. I'll be making this one again for sure.

This is a decent but very basic recipe.  Here are my thoughts.  First of all, don't cut the top off the pepper, it wastes too much pepper, cut it in half lengthwise.  The beef and rice stuffing is rather bland.  Easily liven it up by doubling (or more) the Worcestershire.  Fresh garlic adds to it as well.  Also, as others have already noted, adding some dried basil and/or oregano to the stuffing works well too.  And why in the world would you buy a can of whole tomatoes and then chop them?  Just use a can of diced tomatoes!  Don't use soup as the topping.  Use your favorite pasta sauce.  But if you do use the tomato soup, don't add water, it will just dilute what little flavor there is.  Simply pour the soup into a bowl, heat it a bit in the microwave and stir.  Viola, there's the gravy consistency the recipe calls for and no water needed.  After stuffing the pepper, ladle on the pasta sauce and then using a 2nd cup of cheese top each pepper.  You can then top the cheese with a sprinkle of dried oregano or Italian seasoning.  Happy eating!

I thought these were good but I have had better. Per previous reviews, I too added a bay leaf, a beef bullion cube and a tsp of oregano when cooking the rice. I also used sharp cheddar cheese.  Although there is rice in the peppers, we served over additional white rice so we could spoon the sauce over all.  Although we liked the meal, I feel it needs a little more "umph" to top it off.  It has great potential and I will probally make again only I'll play around with it to find the right blend to fully satisfy our tastebuds.

The sausage was a nice change from the usual ground beef or turkey. I didn't par cook the peppers and top of stove cook time was much less than an hour. Otherwise the recipe was a breeze. I didn't see anyone else mention this in the reviews, but 3 cups of rice would have been ridiculously way too much. I didn't even use two full cups of uncooked rice and it was plenty for the six peppers. I also didn't use instant rice, so maybe that's what made the difference.

This was wonderful! I couldn't remember how my mom made them, but this recipe turned out just like hers! I used tomato sauce instead of tomato soup (I didn't have any on hand), and I used a cup of corn instead of the cheese...it tasted just like home! Thanks Suzanne!

Regarding some of the reviews, why bother rating the recipe if your going to make a total change to the person posting the recipe. Either you like it or you don't.  I dislike when people do that.  Everyone puts their own spin on things. If your going to do that, then I suggest putting your OWN recipe up on the site and not criticize or change someone elses.

This is really close to my granmothers recipe but a whole lot more work! I don't pre-cook anything! Follow the instructions for prepping the peppers, combine  the stuffing ingredients and lightly stuff the peppers, place in a dutch oven filled with soup/water combination, cover and simmer until peppers are soft and stuffing is cooked through.  A lot less work and you're not lighting the oven! I usually make some extra meatballs out of the stuffing mix for those of us who don't like peppers.  Served with mashed potatoes and the gravy from the peppers alongside cucumber salad and sweetcorn you've got a great meal!

I also added more seasoning.  Be sure to slit a few holes in the bottom of the pepper so the fat runs out and doesn't lay in the bottom of the pepper.

This recipe is pretty much the way I cook my stuffed peppers.  But instead of putting the green peppers in boiling water, I found it was much easier to clean the green peppers, half them and put cut side down staggered on a glass plate and then microwaving them for 3 - 4 minutes on high.  Then fill and bake!  They turn out perfectly!

I gave this recipe 5 stars because it is a great base recipe that can be customized pretty easily. I followed the advice of other reviewers and made the following changes. I sauteed some minced garlic with the ground beef and onion. I also had some bell pepper left over that I needed to use, so I chopped that up and sauteed that with the mixture as well. I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles (undrained) in place of the whole peeled tomatoes and doubled the Worcestershire. I used beef broth in place of the 1/2 cup of water and some Italian seasoning and some cayenne pepper for extra seasoning. For the cheese, I had a Cheddar Jack blend and made sure to sprinkle some on top during the last 5 minutes of baking. It was very tasty! The rice wasn't quite done after simmering in the beef mixture for 15 minutes, so next time I will cook the rice separately and add it at the end. Next time I'm also going to try wild rice for a little extra flavor.

My boyfriend and I just LOVE this stuffed bell pepper recipe... we did follow a few of the suggestions made by other reviewers and I think it adds up to the perfect dish:
*Slice the peppers length wise and remove the seeds, and after boiling, sprinkle a little cheese inside each half
*Double, or even triple the worcestershire
*Use a can of diced tomatoes with the seasoning already added (we chose garlic and basil)
*Cook the rice in beef or chicken broth in a separate pan, this helps ensure that the rice is tender and flavorful.. then add it to the beef and simmer for 5-10 mins so it all blends together
*Add garlic to the beef and onions while cooking
*Dont add water to the tomato soup, and make sure you sprinkle cheese on top of the peppers before baking! :) Delish!

OH my goodness.  Everyone should ALWAYS cook rice before adding it to beef stuffings! Cabbage rolls, cook the rice first, stuffed peppers, cook the rice first.  Always look at your ingredients first.  If there is a ingredient that takes longer to cook than the main ing. cook it first, cool it before adding it to the main ing. so you dont start the cooking process before you pop it in the oven.  Rate 4 stars

Super easy and so tasty!  I made it for two, but don't trust the measurements when you change the servings.  I made it with 2 green peppers, split in halves.  Sauteed onions & celery and added some garlic powder.  Used 1 pound of ground beef, 1 cup of rice and 1 can of rotel chopped tomatoes. I added 1 cup of water and a dash of worcestershire sauce.  Mix in the cheese then stuff the green peppers.  I heaped the mixture on to each bell pepper where it was overflowing but still in the pepper.  Covered with tomato soup and water mixture, cheese and panko breadcrumbs for 30 mins.  Oh sooooo good!  It makes a lot of "stuffing" but its perfect!

I have read a few of the reviews and noticed that everyone was baking the stuffed peppers. When I was younger my family cooked the stuffed peppers, standing up in tomatoe sauce (about half way up the pepper) in a large covered pot - just saying, its an alternative to par boiling them and they come out tender and delicious.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because I made changes. 1. I use tomatoe sauce not soup, I add spices to it. 2. I used flavored diced tomatoes as well. 3. Instead of stuffing the peppers then pouring everything on top. I layer it. Cheese, meat, sauce. Until I get to the top. That way it's not dry. And of course I put a lot of cheese on top. My family and our friends LOVE them!

My wife and I have been making them this way for years, but when the kids were smaller they didn't like the green peppers and would leave them on the plates. We decided that was a waste so we chopped them into small pieces and put them in the sauce pan with the rest of the fixings. They never knew and ate every bit of it and asked for seconds..To this day when we have a family get together they will ask us to make this or our pizza sandwiches which is another story for another day!!!

Try using red peppers!  They add a sweetness that is delicious.   Substituting turkey in these is great.  Lose some fat, but the taste is still great.

After 3-4 times preparing this recipe, I always use this one as a base, taking quite a few liberties, due to time constraints and family preferences. I parboil the peppers for 10 minutes. After slicing the tops off the peppers, I chop the remnants and sautee them along with my onions. I then brown 93/7 hamburger meat with our family's favorite spices (I also add considerably more than 1 tsp of worchestershire too!). I throw in a mixture of 1/2 cheddar and 1/2 mozzarella (or Italian blend or whatever else I have on hand) and mix that right into the warm meat mixture. I also cheat and use the 90-second Uncle Ben's Wild Rice pouch and mix that right into the hamburger/cheese mixture as well. I like a bit more structure and flavor to my sauce, so I use the Tomato Cream Sauce for Pasta, found on this site too. I then add a couple ladles of the sauce to the hamburger and blend well. It makes the hamburger/rice mixture just the perfect consistency to spoon into the peppers.  Then, I pour the remaining sauce over the assembled peppers, add more cheese to the pepper tops and bake for 20 minutes (parboiling the peppers a bit longer will shorten your baking time). Easy peasy...not to mention wonderfully delicious! This is a great recipe to add your flair to since you can sub out different colored peppers, use ground turkey instead of hamburger meat, play around with sauces, etc. Thanks for the submission....I'll use this recipe as my base over and over again.

I also use tomato paste rather than tomatoes, also tomato soup is too sweet so I use tomato juice if needed. We don't like green peppers so I use red, orange or yellow, they're sweeter and not so "bitey". After stuffing the peppers, my mom always just put them in the skillet, topped them with more cheese, the tomato juice and cooked them covered till heated through.  No baking required. She also added basil, parsley and garlic to the beef mixture. She made these for over 65 years, and her mother before her so she had time to perfect the recipe.

Delicious! 

I cut recipe in half, used ground turkey and much seasoning. Minced garlic and two huge yellow peppers. Sprinkled shredded Mexican cheese mix. A hit with my husband. 

Thanks!

I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 only because the tips from other reviewers seemed to improve the recipe drastically. Bottom line: The peppers were excellent!  From others' suggestions, I added two cloves of garlic (chopped); added lots of Italian seasoning, plus more basil and oregano; used diced, canned tomatoes flavored with basil and oregano; doubled the Worchestershire; substituted spaghetti sauce for tomato soup; doubled the rice and cooked it ahead of time; used some red peppers as well as green ones; and used at least 1.5 cups of grated cheddar. The 60-minute time frame is conservative, especially if you make it the way I did. Cooking the rice alone took 20 minutes; I had to cook two batches of peppers; browning the beef took about 15 minutes; and the peppers cooked in the oven at least 35 minutes.  All in all, a great basic recipe, easily adapted to what you have on hand and what your family prefers. I'll definitely make these again.

I made my stuffed peppers like this when I first started cooking but now that I've gotten back to eating healthier, I've lightened it up a bit. We don't like green bell peppers so I use red, orange or yellow. I now use ground turkey, fire-roasted tomatoes, brown rice that I've cooked before hand and I omit the water. I also use organic tomato sauce and throw in a mess of minced fresh garlic. This totally bends well to what I have on hand and if I want to make it stretch with half the meat, I sub in shredded or chopped veggies (we favor zucchini, carrots, spinach or broccoli) and sometimes I'll spice it up with a teaspoon or two of homemade italian seasoning or taco seasoning. Whatever I grab first. This is always a filling meal that my family always inhales. If you've got the time and patience, this is also a good recipe to double and freeze one container for another time.

I try out new recipes from online sites almost every week. Though I have tried probably hundreds of recipes,  I have only written a couple of reviews because though most recipes are ok, none are sooo good or sooo bad to warrant a review.  But this stuffed pepper recipe is an exception.  It is fabulous.  I thought I had a good stuffed pepper recipe but this one is much better.   If your family likes stuffed peppers, give it a try, you won't be disappointed.

I never grew up on stuffed peppers, so I like to try a variety of recipes since I don't know what "right" tastes like. I think I may have finally figured it out tonight. I kept the amounts the same, just swapped out some smoked provola and scamorza for the cheddar, since I like to use as much local ingredients as possible. For anyone who can get their hands on real Italian cheese, a 50/50 blend of smoked provola and scamorza is absolutely amazing in these peppers. I was hesitant on using a can of tomato soup as a gravy, but it really did add that extra touch that I feel stuffed peppers need. I'll still try new recipes out, but this is certainly our families default from here on out.

This is a great recipe, but I did make some changes.  I like brown rice instead of white, so I just cooked it seperate and added it to the meat and tomato mixture.  (Don't add the water if you are adding already cooked rice.)  I doubled all the spices (onion, pepper, etc. and added garlic.)  Then, I mix the grated cheese in with the meat mixture before stuffing the peppers.  My whole family loves it.

I didn't read other reviews before making this.  A few comments on the recipe:  1.  There is no human way rice could ever go from uncooked to tender in 15 minutes.  Cook it ahead.  2.  I printed a shopping list w/o reading the recipe, and it doesn't make sense to buy whole tomatoes only to chop them.  I'd use pre-diced.  So.  Aside from the rice being crunchy (after adding 10 minutes of simmer time) and there not being enough filling for the sixth pepper, the overall flavor of these was good.  I felt it needed more rice and maybe some other ingredients to bring it to a five star level.  Thanks though.

I modified this recipe a bit based on what was cheaper and what I had on hand... 

First I used 4 green peppers and lean ground turkey meat. I cooked the onion first, then I cooked the turkey with it, seasoned with s&p and a little oregano. 

I had a packet of that 90 second rice, long grain brown from good old uncle ben, so I added that. I never added worcestershire sauce, and I substituted the tomato soup for two 8 oz cans of plain old tomato sauce. I mixed everything together (minus about 1/3 c tomato sauce) in a bowl and added about 3 tbsp of good quality parm cheese. I spooned the rest of the tomato sauce into the bottoms of the peppers, then filled them to the top with the mixture. I covered the baking pan tightly with foil and baked on 350 for 45 minutes. With 10 minutes left I uncovered them and threw a ton of cheddar cheese on top. I also find it tastes amazing with cholula hot sauce.

I like this recipe.  I use poblano peppers instead of bell peppers because I like the poblano taste over bell peppers.  If you take out the white membrane and seeds, you take out the heat.

wow, i'd give this 6 stars if i could.  i made these because my boyfriend likes stuffed peppers, but we both loved them!!  i made a few modifications.  instead of the tomato soup and whole peeled tomatoes, i just added 2 tablespoons of garlic, 3 teaspoons of italian seasoning, two 8oz cans of tomato sauce, and one 14.5oz can of diced tomatoes (with garlic, basil, and oregano) into the simmering meat mixture.  i also used lean ground beef and a parmesan/mozerella cheese mix vs. the cheddar.  its really good if you put the extra stuffing mix in the baking dish around the peppers. in the last 10 minutes of cooking, i topped each pepper with mozerella and parmesan cheeses and broiled until browned.  so yummy!!

I didn't like stuffed peppers as a child, but I sure do now!  I loved this recipe!!!  The only thing that I did differently was add a small can of drained sweet corn (frozen would work also).  I really like the tomato sauce that the peppers cook in, and have not found many recipes like this one (i.e. peppers topped with tomato sauce).  These peppers freeze well, so it's worth your while to make a double batch.  I was stumped about what to serve with them, though (seems as if something is missing...).  The only thing I could think of was peach crisp. Everything esle seemed redundant (i.e. potoatoes with "rice" stuffed peppers, another veggie with a veggie, etc.).  Yum! Yum!

We don't care for smushy peppers, so not wanting to take a chance on boiling for 5 minutes, I microwaved them for about 45 seconds.  Then, with the baking time, they came out just right for us.

This is the first time I have ever made stuffed Green Peppers.  My whole family, including my son's 11 year old friend & my 13 year old daughter, loved these!!  I did use others ideas.  I did 3/4 cup rice & water & I added all seasonings you would put in spaghetti sauce, like Italian, Parsley, Basil, garlic salt, Oregano & of course 3 fresh garlic cloves.  I also used only 1 can of the soup, as I do not like too much tomato flavor.  I also put the meat mixture in 1/2 way, then the soup, then more meat & more soup & did not top it with more cheese.  It didn't need more & I do count calories.  This was a really nice, filling dish!!

I read some of the other reviews and here's what I did ....  I added garlic and onion powder, a little bit of oregano, 1/2 tsp more of the Worcestershire sauce, and a small squirt of Red Hot sauce .... I put a little bit of cheese in the bottom of the peppers before I filled them .... I filled the peppers half full and put a little of the tomato soup mix in .... I did NOT mix ANY of the cheese in with the mixture .... I finished filling the peppers, put in more tomato soup, and THEN I topped it all with the cheese .... when I used the tomato soup, I added about 1/2 can of water, OH .... and I also used a can of diced tomatoes like other reviewers said .... AND I had about 1 cup of leftover corn (frozen not canned) and added that .... they came out fantastic .... do NOT be afraid to season because they would have been incredibly bland had I not put seasoning in ...

I have made this recipe twice.  And changed the combination somewhat.  I increased the rice to 2/3 cup along with the water.  Reduced the soup to 1 can.  Added oregano, garlic & beef bouillion.  And increased the simmer time & baking time when using uncooked rice.  Next time I will use cooked rice.

Sauteed my onion and fresh minced garlic in extra virgin olive oil.  Added, ground turkey meat, basil, oregano, and cilantro.  I used red bell peppers rather than green as the red has a slightly sweeter taste to me.  Placed some shredded white extra sharp cheddar cheese in the bottom of the peppers, filled half the pepper with the meat mixture, then a spoon full of condensed tomato soup, then finished filling the peppers and topped with another spoon full of tomato soup.  Baked at 375 degrees F for 45 minutes.  Placed some more shredded extra sharp cheddar cheese on top of the peppers for the last five minutes of baking.  Whoooo, Buuuuddy!  It was delicious!  Served with steamed broccoli and cauliflower with a side of black olives.  It garnered me another Stamp of Approval (SOA) award from Mi Gato Loco.

Delicious...I have had stuffed peppers before and they have just been ok, but these are great.  I made a few slight changes.  Just added a bit more worchestershire sauce, garlic seasoning salt and used a 3 cheese nacho blend cheese, also added some parmesean.  As another reviewer suggested I put some tomato soup half way down the pepper.  I used red, green and yellow peppers for some colour.  They are very hearty and filling and full of flavour.  Try it!

I gave this recipe 4 stars instead of 5 because it calls for un-cooked rice. Doesn't say instant rice, just rice. When I made these I followed the recipie exactly and the rice was no where near done. When I make these again I will use instant rice or pre-cook the rice. Not very good when your crunching on un-cooked rice

This is essentially the recipe mom made when i was a kid!  She mixed the soup into the beef/rice before stuffing the peppers and there was some hot sauce or chili flakes mixed in as well, but a classic recipe that has endured!

LOve this recipe but I as always read reviews. I made changes to mine and my husbands liking. I have made this recipe twice, the first time I used half pound hamburger and half pound sausage. instead of water I used beef broth. I used mozzrella chees since it melts better and I used Rotell. I looked at alot of photos that others had shared and I was alittle grossed out that the pepper and filling was floating in Tomato soup (I used Tomato sauce). I only used about a 1/4 cup of tomato sauce to line the bottom of the pan and a few little drips of sauce in each pepper and added mozzerella cheese on top. Very wonderful recipe but eveb better with the changes I made. The second time I made it. it was requested and I did not have Hamburger so I used only sausage and it had lots more flavor.

I have always loved stuffed bell peppers, and when I was given a large box of produce I jumped at the chance to make them (much to the distain of my poor hubby, lol). I did make my own changes (I did not read the other's reviews beforehand, but noticed a lot of similarities). First off, I never have canned tomato soup on hand. So instead I used 2 8oz cans of tomato sauce. I poured it into a bowl and added a generous amount of garlic powder, salt, pepper, onion powder, basil, and Italian seasoning. I mixed it well and it tasted delicious as my "tomato soup". Then, instead of the canned chopped tomatoes (I had none on hand), I added 2 8oz canned to the browning ground beef. So in my pot was browning ground beef and onions, salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, rice, and maybe 3 tablespoons of worcestershire sauce. I did not have any chedder cheese, so I shredded a block of mozzarella cheese instead-which turned out great! After I baked everything in the oven, it was DELICIOUS! My husband was even shocked that his childhood dinner nightmare was so tasty. I say that this recipe is well worth the 5 stars. :) I always add extra seasonings to everything.

I made these last night for dinner and they were excellent.  I did make some minor changes, I used 3 big bell peppers and cut them length wise and stuffed each half.  I only used one can of tomato soup and a can of diced tomatos and seasoned the meat with Garlic Salt, black pepper, onion and minced garlic,  the worchestire and a dash of cayanne pepper.  I used the same powders seasonings in the tomato soup on the top.  I also used minute rice, I topped the peppers with sharp cheddar cheese (added the last 5 minutes).  They turned out excellent, my husband and father loved them!!  This would be a great stuffing for cabage rolls also :)

These turned out really well. I added a bit of finely diced celery to the beef/onion sautee, used more worcestershire sauce and added some garlic powder. The mixture seemed a little dry so I added a can of tomato sauce to it. I was able to stuff five peppers... not enough mixture for six. Very moist and flavorful even without the tomato soup. Will make again. Thanks, Suzanne!

this was very good and very easy to make.  the only thing that i will change is the texture of the meat stuffing.  i am used to adding egg and breadcrumbs with rice.  the only thing really holding together the stuffing was the cheese added.  i will use this recipe again, but i will make the stuffing the traditional way.

I suppose the recipe by itself isn't 4 stars, but its a good base to customize to your families taste. I added a lot of different seasonings. I precooked the rice in chicken broth in my rice cooker. If you keep the rice slightly on the dry side, it will still absorb more moisture when baking w/o getting soggy. I sauteed the meat by itself. While it was draining I sauteed the onion (used double what was called for) with some minced garlic and then added the meat back in. I used a whole can of diced tomotoes(and juice) and half a 15 oz can tomato sauce. The rest of the seasonings I added a little at a time until it tasted right: garlic seasoned salt, garlic, white pepper, black pepper, 1 cube beef bullion, cumin, oregano, thyme, worchestshire sauce, louisiana hot sauce, lots of mild cheddar, I think that's all. I just kept adding until I like it. I washed and salted the peppers, but did not par boil them. I prefer them to be less done and have more structure. They were topped with sliced mild cheddar. I used half the meat mixture and froze the rest. I will update when I use the next half, but I expect it will be just fine, not much different than freezing meatloaf mix which I do all the time.

Not bad. But if you follow these directions the rice WILL NOT be cooked. Either precook the rice or increase the water to 1 cup and cook rice for 25 min.

This was my first time trying stuffed bell peppers ever and they were so delicious. I can't imagine that there could be a better recipe to use. So yummy! We've added this to our dinner rotation. We use ground turkey. We also use a can of diced tomatoes instead of whole peeled tomatoes. And we only use about one can of tomato soup, not diluted. For the tomato soup, we fill the peppers about halfway with the meat mixtre, then add 1-2 spoonfulls of tomato soup in each pepper, then fill the rest of the way with the meat mixture. Top with sauce, then more shredded cheddar cheese. We also only make 4 peppers. This recipe fills 4 peppers up to the top with just the right amount of mixture.

I changed the recipe somewhat, in place of onions I added half a pack of instant onion soup mix.  Instead of 2 cans of tomato soup I used 1 can soup and 1 cup ketchup for the sauce.   I also used a can of diced tomatoes with peppers.
This was really good and the kids liked it.   Also, easy to prepare... will make this again.

This recipe was a nice base but turned out fantastic with a few changes. I used Rotel in place of the whole tomatoes and substituted the tomato soup with a can of tomato sauce. I cooked the rice in the rice cooker and then added it to the meat and sauce mix. I used beef broth in place of the water which added a lot of flavor! I also decided to use mozzerella cheese instead of cheddar since that's what my mom used to always use when I was growing up! They were so good and were not bland as others have mentioned. It is probably the changes I made. Boyfriend loved them...will definitely be making again!

The filling is delicious. The second time I made them I used a large bottle of tomato juice with 1/3 cup brown sugar, instead of the tomato soup. This was a very tasty twist to stuffed peppers.

YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS~!!!

ADD 1 pkg. ortega taco season(smoky chipotle flavor) to ground beef after browned.

CHIPOTLE FLAVOR TACO SEASON NOT REGULAR. the chipotle flavor is much different from regular taco season.

instead of 2 cans tomato soup, use 1 can tomato and one can campbells southwest style pepper jack.

AWESOME FLAVOR!!

Delicious!  Sometimes I mix the tomato soup in with the meat, etc., then stuff the peppers and skip the baking part to save time.  I've also substituted kidney beans for the meat for a nice, hearty vegetarian meal.  And when we're feeling a little spicy, I use a can of diced tomatoes and green chilies instead of regular tomatoes.

I've made a similar recipe for years, this was very good.  The only change I made was to cook the green peppers in the microwave with a little water for about 6 minutes in a covered dish-the same dish I used to bake them, saves dishes and is easier.  I didn't have tomato soup, so used Hunt's tomato sauce instead-turned out great.  Thanks

This is a great recipe!  However, I changed the following based on previous reviews:  used 2 cans rotel original drained instead of whole peeled tomatoes, used 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce, 1 1/2 cups cooked rice, 2 cups fat free cheedar cheese and 1/2 cup fat free mozarella for topping, and added fresh garlic and cumin to the ground beef.  I also used 96/4 lean ground beef.  Made this dish very healty and tasty. If going by Weight Watchers this comes to only 6 points per pepper!

I found this recipe to be extremely bland. I have had stuffed peppers before and have always enjoyed them since they were extremely flavorful. The finished product reminded me of lean college days eating Chef Boy R Dee!!!  This was a waste of time, energy, and ingredients.

It was a bit bland. Next time I will double the worchestershire sauce and add garlic, as others have suggested. Also, I often assemble stuffed peppers ahead of time and freeze them until needed. I simply place the filled peppers on a cookie sheet in the freezer until they're completely solid, then wrap them individually and seal them in a freezer bag. To bake, I remove the needed peppers, unwrap and thaw them on a paper towel, then transfer them to a baking dish and bake for 25-30 minutes.

I tried this recipe because I'm always into trying something new. First off, I used 2 large green peppers and the recommended meat and rice measurements worked just fine. I opted to use ground turkey since I don't eat red meat and used my normal seasoning during the browning stage. I also chose not to salt the inside of the peppers since they were previously boiled in salted water. All in all the peppers came out fine. One change I'll make next time though is to cook the rice a separate pot to ensure it is cooked thoroughly. While eating I noticed some grains of rice semi hard.

Par-boiling the peppers really makes this recipe shine!  No more too crunchy pepper with overcooked filling!  I use more seasoning than this recipe calls for - I like to add a bunch of Italian seasoning to the beef mixture.  I also prefer using pre-cooked frozen rice rather than uncooked rice whenever I can find it.  Then you can shorten the time the mixture simmers before adding it to the peppers.  I also like to mix my favorite spaghetti sauce into the beef/rice mixture in advance rather than pouring a can of bland (and super salty!) tomato sauce over the top.

Very good!  I made a couple of changes like other users did.  I used turkey instead of beef, and diced tomatoes instead of whole peeled.  I added more worcestershire than called for, added italian seasoning,red pepper flakes, garlic salt and a half a packet of good seasons italian dressing.  I also cooked the rice and sautéed the onion (and garlic) and then combined it (I used brown minute rice-so easy).  On the large peppers I layered sauce (tomato soup), meat, sauce, meat and then cheese and sauce.  It definitely made a difference!  The tomato soup adds a little sweetness.

Nice recipe, but did anyone ever use 1/2  low fat content  ground beef and 1/2  ground pork? I use this [half and half mixture] for all my recipes, i.e. hamburgers, meatloaf, stuffed cabbage. Just a hint my grandmother gave me 50 years ago. I like this recipe with all the extras added....garlic, etc.

The whole family loved it, even my pickiest boy. I used diced tomatoes with  green chiles instead of whole, and a large can of tomato sauce instead of soup. I added garlic and cumin to the tomato sauce. I followed others advice and used beef broth instead of water and added extra worcestershire and garlic. I could have just eaten the filling on its own! Great texture and lots of flavor.

Made these last night with 2 yellow,2 red,2 orange and 2 green peppers.  Doubled the recipes for 8 large peppers, worked out fine. Did not use tomatoe soup instead using tomatoe sauce. Everyone loved them. Will be making more and frezzing then for a busy day. Thanks for the recipe :)

My family loved this dish. However, I do want to add that make sure you don't boil the peppers for more than 4 min. They become to flimsy and tear. But, overall GREAT!

My family really enjoyed these.  Instead of removing the tops, I cut them in half lengthwise and had two peppers to stuff.

YUMMY!  I did a few things diffrent.  Cooked rice first..added corn and kidney beans ...a few spices chili powder cumin (chili like)...but the thing that made it extra special for me and my family was sour cream mixed in at the same time as the cheese....also the last five minutes I took the cover off and added some more cheese on top!!!!!!!!!!

Great Recipe!! Thank You, these were the best stuffed peppers I ever had! Although I did change a few things, I added 1/2 cup of more cheese which next time I think I might had a full cup more, I used diced tomatoes in Italian Seasoning, and 1 can of tomatoe soup and 1 of sauce, and also added just a dash extra of wostechire sauce. Yum Yum Yum, thanks again :)

This recipe was a great starting point, but the second time I made them I definitely "kicked it up a notch."    I added 3 cloves of garlic, doubled the Worcestershire sauce, added a tablespoon of tomato paste, and added some cumin and cayenne.  I also substituted light cheddar for the cheddar.

If you soak the rice in a half cup of hot water while the meat mixture is cooking, it helps to soften the rice.  The first time I made them, the rice was still a little crunchy; second time (when I soaked the rice), it was perfect.

I also chose not to pre-cook the peppers, as we prefer them crunchy.

This recipe was wonderful when fixed up a bit.  My husband loved it.  I did take others advice by adding more spices.  I added minced garlic, onion powder, seasoned salt, oregano and one beef boullion cube.  It was aesome and full of flavor.  I added extra farmhouse cheddar cheese to top off the meat and tomato soup.  At the end I also added some parmesan to top it off.  Thanks a lot for the recipe.

It's cool to eat a meal in a pepper and it's surprising how filling those little rascals are.  I like dem stuffed bell peppers, mmm...hhmm!  My main concern while preparing this meal was to watch over the rice carefully.  While cooking the rice mixture, the water kept evaporating.  If you don't keep adding water, the rice may burn to the pan.  Also, you may want to cook the rice a bit longer than 15 minutes to get the rice more tender.  My wife was impressed with my cooking abilities.  This recipe made me look like a champ!

I gave this recipe 5 stars even though I made some changes because the recipe would be good without changes. I usually make enough to freeze for future meals so the recipe was doubled. I didn't blanch the peppers because I don't like them mushy, and freezing tends to soften them anyway. I didn't salt the inside of the peppers as we don't need extra salt. I used basmati brown rice and cooked it separately in beef broth seasoned with garlic powder, onion powder, and cumin. I used canned diced tomatoes. It didn't make sense to get whole ones to chop. I also added 2 tsp. Italian seasoning and minced garlic to the beef mixture. The stuffed peppers were loved by my family, and they freeze very well. Each was wrapped in plastic wrap to prevent freezer burn, and then put into large baggies.

This recipe was pretty good. I followed it as written. For flavor, I'd give it 5 stars,(definitely make sure to salt and pepper the beef to your liking while browning it because that makes a big difference for the overall outcome) but 4 overall because the rice was still hard. And I even cooked it over an hour to see if that would help, but it didn't! So, personally, these are the changes I'd make next time; use 1 cup cooked rice, Drain the can of diced tomatoes, and mix in the soup topping a bit throughout the beef mixture, as it did not seep through it. Then it will be perfect!

I cooked a pot of brown rice in water on top of the stove.  When it was fully cooked I added it to this recipe.  Also, I didn't use tomato soup.  I used a 29 oz can of tomato sauce.  I really liked the addition of Worcestershire sauce.  I never would have thought of it.  Thanks Suzanne.

Used ground turkey, diced tomatoes w/chiles (definitely!) and added about 5 oz. spaghetti sauce (saved the rest for another dinner - worth it; trust me), followed the rest of recipe as is.  Delicious!  Everyone loved!  The best green peppers ever.

These are delicious!  I follow the recipe exactly, with the exception I sprinkle cheese on top of the peppers.  Our family likes extra cheese!  Other reviews said "this is a basic pepper recipe", and while to them that might be true, I feel that I didn't need to add anything extra to spice it up!

I have been making stuffed peppes for years but was never quite satisfied with the results.  I am now!  These were delish.  I did add a small amount of beef soup base to the water when cooking the hamburg/rice mixture.  I think the cheese make it very moist.  Thanks!

This is a wonderful recipe. I did add crushed garlic to the onions and ground beef and increased the amount of Worcestershire sauce to 1 TBLS. I also use just one can of tomato soup. After making this recipe three times, I find it turns out just a little bit different each time; most likely it's the size of the green peppers. Sometimes I have more stuffing than peppers. I just freeze it for another meal. A very delicious meal...thanks for the recipe!!

This was my first time making stuffed peppers. They came out pretty good! My boyfriend loved them, he said they were amazing. Personally I thought it was very good but a little bland. I would definitely add more worcestershire sauce and a lot more cheese next time. I eyeballed the measurements of everything so I can't really say exactly how much of each ingredient I used. But two pointers: don't hold back on the cheese or the tomato soup. Next time I'm going to layer the cheese and tomato soup a few times with the beef & onion mixure inside the pepper. I'll also probably add some extra spices to the beef. But I will definitely make these again! With my own tweaks. :)

The only thing I would change is to leave out the tomato soup on top. It didn't add anything and was basically just soup on top.

I made these the other night and it turned out great! I made a few slight changes, but it was still amazing. We dont like too much green pepper, so we used red peppers. I would suggest, like others, to use double spices. especially the worcestershire sauce. I accidently used too much cheese, but we love cheese so it was ok, used shredded mozzerella. This was a great recipe and I will definately be using it again.

These were very tasty. Due to my own error (did not have a lid for the pot), the rice did not fully cook so it came out crunchy- but otherwise the flavors were good together. I might omit both the rice and the tomato-soup sauce next time as there was enough tomato flavor in the filling for the peppers. Family loved it, even the picky eaters!

I made this recipe for the first time a few years ago. Last week, I was craving stuffed peppers so pulled this one out. I had forgotten what a hit this was with the family. Absolutely delicious...I'll have to make it more frequently. The gravy made from tomato soup is probably our favorite part of the dish. Yum!

So, 30 minute prep time + 30 minute cook time was NOT true.  It was more like an hour prep time. 

That said, it was really good. I did take some ideas from the other reviews. I used tomato sauce and diced tomatoes, and added the sauce with meat, rice and tomatoes. I also used mozzarella cheese (mostly because I just really wanted it.) Next time though, I'm going to get the rice made BEFORE I start cooking the meat. Waiting on the rice to get fluffy was what took it so long. 

Overall, very good with just a few adjustments. :)

These were really good.  I added one can of tomato soup to the beef mixture, then 1/2 a can when peppers were 1/2 full, then the other 1/2 on the top, and added extra cheese to top.  Otherwise followed to a T, and they were quite yummy!

A good starting point. I found it pretty bland as is. I used ground turkey, added more onions (~1 cup), more W sauce (1 T), no water, leftover cooked white rice and tomato sauce instead of tomato soup. I also sprinkled onion powder and garlic powder to taste. I cut the peppers in half lenghtwise, put a bit of the sauce in the bottom, added the turkey mixture and more sauce on top before adding the cheese. Because I used already cooked rice, I didn't have to simmer for long.

I absolutely loved these! This was the first time I ever tried to cook stuffed peppers. The main thing I didn't do was pre-boil the peppers. With using the soup as a topping, I had also made a little extra and poured it into the bottom of the pan before putting the peppers in it, and that softened up the peppers. I also added cheese before and after putting the tomato sauce on top of the meat and rice mixture; this way it had a little extra cheese and was nice to pull apart. I didn't have a onion, so I used minced onion and it worked fine. This is definitely something we will be having over and over again!

I give this 5 stars because of my modifications. I used 1/2 ground beef, 1/2 mild italian sausage. I cooked the rice (1 cup) separately. i added some minced garlic while cooking the meat & onions. when the meat was done i drained the excess fat then stirred in a can of diced tomatoes (the kind with basil & oregano in it) and the cooked rice... no water. i added a little extra basil, oregano, and italian seasoning. i heated that up and mixed in shredded italian cheese blend and stuffed the peppers. in the last 5 minutes of baking i sprinkled a little extra cheese on top of the peppers... awesome!

I am not a big fan of green peppers but this dish has definitely moved them up on my list, it's so delicious! I pretty much doubled the recipe but will be freezing half for later. Instead of the whole peeled tomatoes I added a can of tomato sauce (it's what I had) and only used 1 can of diluted tomato soup poured over top. I also didn't mix the cheese in with the meat and only sprinkled it on after I took it out of the oven. I'll definitely make this again and again!

WOW, this was awesome.  One of the best things I've made.  I listened to a couple of suggestions and added 1 fresh minced clove of garlic and diced tomatoes.  I added a couple things for a twist, I added around 8 ounces of ricotta cheese leftover from manicotti.  I used mozzarella instead of cheddar.  I also added parmesean cheese on top.  I sprinkled cayenne pepper once it was on my plate.  Yummo.  Thanks for this recipe.

I have never like stuffed peppers before, but these were really good.  The only change I made was adding garlic powder and a few dashes of hot pepper sauce to the meat and rice mixture.  I did not have 2 cans of tomato soup, so I used 1 can soup and 1 can (8 oz) tomato sauce mixed with a little brown sugar, water and a dash or worchestershire sauce.  Will be making these again for sure.

I like to use browned sausage instead of beef and also use red rice and beans....adds a lot of great flavor and fiber.

Made this recipe the other night, and, I have to admit, I'm glad that I instinctively made changes before I even begun..   First of all, boiling the peppers seemed a bit unnecessary to me- I didn't want my peppers mushy, so I didn't do that. (Great decision, by the way- the peppers came out just the right combination of cooked while retaining that firm texture and crunch that only fresh peppers have!) Also, changed what I put in; along with the proportions (though, to be fair, it depends on the size of your peppers, right?)  Instead of the condensed tomato soup, the water, and the whole tomatoes, I added a big jar of extra chunky tomato sauce, since I was pressed for time, mixing it in with the rice right after it was done cooking, and keeping it on low. I also added a bit of cayenne pepper, kept the Worcestershire.  Filled the peppers with the premixed beef & rice (made sure it was hot first) and slid into the oven- DID not add any cheese until the last minutes, when I slapped a slice of provolone over each pepper & cranked the oven up to 400 degrees; when the cheese was melted to the desired consistency, the peppers were done!  A tip: if you are like a few members in my family, and you really like these with a strong tomato taste, a lower sodium, easier solution than condensed soup would be tomato paste--because the worst you have to do is add a little water and boil it off if you feel you've added too much, and it really gives you the most flavor for the least effort.

We made this recipe exactly as posted. We really enjoyed these stuffed peppers. I liked them much better than a meatloaf type mixture. Thanks for sharing the recipe, it's a keeper!

I love to cook and thought I would try this recipe since I have made stuffed green peppers for some time.  I thought it was a little unusual to sautee the meat and onions in a skillet (haven't heard of that), but I did and included tomato sauce instead of diced or stewed tomatos, even added shredded cheese and rice in the skillet.  Heated it on high for about 20 minutes until I knew it was cooked through.  Stuffing the peppers seemed easier and I used tomato soup on top (non-diluted).  I cooked them for about 45 minutes in the oven at 350 and they REALLY came out better than previous recipes I've tried.  They were not greasy at all and the consistancy of the meat inside was right on.  I really enjoyed them and encourage you to try it too.

This recipe is DELICIOUS! I think it is almost perfect.  I add a little garlic to the meat as it browns, and use canned diced tomatoes (oregano, basil and garlic seasoned) That gives these a great flavor!  I only had one can of tomato soup, so I had to sub some tomato sauce mixed with water, and it still turned out delicious! Even better on day 2! Oh yes, and I use BROWN RICE!!! That also adds nice flavoring!

Good stuffed peppers.  The tomato soup is what makes the difference!  Istead of slicing off the tops, I sliced 4 peppers in half so I'd get 8 of them.  More stuffing, less pepper is how my kids like them.  I place the halved peppers in a 9 x 13 pan with about an inch of water in the bottom in the microwave for about 10 minutes ore more till they are tender.  Drain the water, fill the peppers and bake.  I tweaked the filling a bit.  Omitted the chopped tomatoes and added 2 tsp. of chili powder, some minced garlic and 1 tsp. garlic powder.  I topped with additional shredded cheese 5 minutes before pulling out of oven.

This was the third time I've made this recipe. There's none like it. It's absolutely delicious.I didn't use the Worcestershire sauce and only used 1 can of tomato soup(because that's all I had) I also baked it at 325 degrees for 1 hour. It tasted much better cooking it longer

Sigh...better than my Grandma's. Sorry, Grandma. This is the boeuf borguignon of stuffed pepper recipes...simple, nourishing and truly delicious. 

This recipe takes the same basic ingredients and adds these flourishes I am not used to (and was absolutely delighted by): pepper cooking method (they came out with that delicious well-cooked vegetable taste, that wasn't overcooked or too limp...it still had body and rich flavor and structure), sweet tomato soup (played so well with the other ingredients) and cheese in the stuffing mixture (gave the filling the consitution, body and flavor I always knew was missing from other recipes I'd tried, my mother's and grandmothers).

All in all a FANTASTIC recipe that, in my opinion, PERFECTS "comfort food" stuffed peppers. Not fancy, not anything but simple, good food, done perfectly.

This is my regular recipe for stuffed peppers.  I use italian-style diced or stewed tomatoes, add garlic, and I always cook the rice seperately while the meat is browning.  They're both ready at about the same time and I just mix it all together in the end.  I top each filled pepper with tomato or pasta sauce, not soup. This is a great recipe that's very tweakable and always works.  Thanks!

This recipe was great but I have a suggestion.  Once I cut the tops off the peppers and cleaned them out, I placed them, cut side down, in my steamer and steamed them rather than boiling them.  That way I didn't have to wait so long for the water to boil and they didn't get waterlogged.  I took them off the burner but didn't take off the lid until I was ready to stuff them.  They almost burned my fingers as I stuffed them but it was worth the trouble as I put them in the oven really almost ready to serve.  
  I should have put the seasonings in that have been mentioned.  My whole family loved them.  It was a real surprise.  I didn't expect the peppers to be popular.

These are the first stuffed peppers I have ever made and they were a hit. I really like the tomato soup vs. tomato sauce. I added a bit more seasoning to the meat mixture, just a preference in our house. I have made these a few times now and once used a frozen meatloaf mix I had as the meat base. It worked great, even with the addition of the bread crumbs already in the meatloaf mix!!

I was intrigued by the large number of very positive reviews for this receipe and just had to try it for myself.  I found it to be everything that I had hoped for and more!!  I also added ground Italian hot sausage for a slightly zesty appeal.  There is no doubt my family will asking for this tasty dish quite often in the future.

PS:  The leftovers really are great!  Thanks Suzanne!!

I made the recipe exactly as written. I thought they were OK, but, all in all, just average. It's a good start, but way too bland. If I use this recipe again, I'll add lots of garlic, basil, jalapeño, or something, to kick it up a notch. I liked the suggestion about using spaghetti sauce.  It might be fun to use pasta instead of rice, too.

Best stuffed peppers I have ever made.  Used the basic recipe but made some changes.  Microwaved the peppers covered with a tiny bit of water for five minutes instead of boiling them.  Had "meatloaf" mixture (pork and beef) on hand and used this.  After draining the meat I added an envelope of onion soup mixture for seasoning.  Used pureed tomatoes from the garden. Used Prego spaghetti sauce for topping.  Delicious.

This was absolutely delicious. I made a few changes though. I used canned diced tomatoes instead of whole chopped ones.  I used seasoned tomato/pasta sauce instead of tomato soup. I added a bunch of powdered garlic because my family loves garlic and puts in it everything. Lastly, I put a little bit of the shredded cheese and tomato sauce in the bottom on the peppers before I stuffed them with the meat/rice mixture so that there was cheese and sauce throughout the whole pepper.

I really enjoyed these peppers. I changed things around. I used a mixture of different colors of bell peppers. I cut them in half instead. I used some suggestions from other users such as use pasta sauce instead of tomato soup, use double Worcestershire sauce, add dried basil and oregano. I added 2 cloves of minced fresh garlic and sauted it with the onion until translucent then added the ground meat and cooked until brown. Also, the first time I made this I used a mixture of ground beef, ground pork, and ground veal ( it was on hand in the fridge) and it tasted phenomenal. I cooked the rice 20 to 25 minutes as 15 min the rice was still crunchy.
I used 1 1/2 to 2 cups of cheese. 1 cup was added as per the directions and the other 1/2 to 1 cup sprinkled on top after peppers were stuffed.

Really good recipe- haven't had stuffed peppers in years and these were great.  Two concerns with the recipe prompted me to make changes- cooking the rice first, and upping the spices/flavouring.  I added more worcestershire, basil, oregano, and minced garlic- lots of each.  I also used pizza sauce in with tomato sauce and tomato paste for the topping part (and didn't add water- definitely not needed).   I thought they were great- probably didn't even need the cheese on top.  Husband thought they were too saucy, but I liked it.  Would still be good even without the tomato sauce on top.  Thanks for this- I've never had a stuffed pepper with so much tomato/sauce actually- quite liked it!

My boyfriend claims that this is his favorite meal EVER.  I served the meal with more rice and spooned the extra sauce over the rice.  I would make only a few changes (some of which have already been suggested by other reviewers).  (1) I cooked the rice before I put it into the meat mixture.  (2) Instead of putting all the meat in and then covering it with sauce, I treated the recipe more like a lasagna.  I put cheese on the bottom of the pepper, then a little meat, then tomato sauce, then more meat, then more tomato sauce, and finished it all off with the leftover cheese.

I love this recipe!  I've always used ground turkey in place of ground beef to make it healthier.  I've also cut down a lot on the cheese and tomato soup as well for the same reason.  I also followed other advice in layering some soup/cheese at the bottom, middle and top.  l I also like to use red peppers and spice (oregano, basil and italian seasoning).  I was skeptical about the soup at first but given this recipes ratings I thought I would try and it and I'm so glad I did!

These peppers are great!  A few tweaks (cut peppers in half lengthwise, added panko on top before adding the soup, and I did use turkey meat instead, you really only need one can of soup, the other I used in the bowls).  
My hubby loved this European recipe as one he grew up with in Germany :)  and my daughter wants this made at every special occasion too now HA!
Serving suggestion:  I thought it would have had a little better presentation in a shallow bowl with the soup filled underneath the peppers.  When you cut into the pepper, the meat also mixed with the extra soup.  Yum!  They turned out delicious!

I changed most everything in this recipe, but the idea is still the same. I only cooked for 2, so 2 green peppers is all I made. 1/2 lb of ground beef, 1 cup of spaghetti sauce, 1 cup of instant white rice. After the beef was done cooking, I added everything else, and let the rice cook. I also added 1/2 a stick of cream cheese which gave it a lot of flavor! Seasoned myself with italian seasoning, garlic powder (instead of using a clove of garlic, and Worcestershire. Great go to recipe though!

These were delish. I used brown rice as that is what we keep on hand. Brown rice does take a bit longer to cook so I did precook the rice in the same large pan for approx 15 mins until the liquid ( 1 cup h20-1/2 cup rice) was absorbed than I put the onions and the ground turkey ( another change) in the same pan to cook. Added the tomatoes and other ingrediants,stuffed the peppers and placed the whole pan in the oven. I am always figuring how to use less pots and pans. All the ingrediants including the peppers were cooked perfectly and the taste called for seconds.

Great dish and really easy to make.  I totally agree with the comment to add 1 can of diced tomatoes instead of dicing your own!  I would also add to sprinkle the cheese on top of the tomato sauce...otherwise how can you see it bubbling?  Great dish!  With certainly make again.

Tasted really good! I used half of a 28 out can of diced tomatoes and used the juice from that with one can of tomato soup (instead of two). I also added oregano and garlic which was good. I used the recipe for 6 peppers even though I only had 4 peppers (but they were large) and I barely had enough of the rice/beef mixture. Also, while cooking the rice, make sure to stir it and add extra moisture if needed, I almost burned it on medium heat (5/10). I think I'll try adding beef broth next time. I also forgot to add the cheese until I had already stuffed the peppers... oops. I mixed it in but I think it would have helped the cheese melt better if I had added it to the rice and beef before I had stuffed the peppers. Boiling the peppers before was definitely a great idea and I added cheese in the bottom of the peepers which was a great touch. Overall, we really liked it and will definitely do it again!

Great recipe! So easy and so delicious. I like stuffed peppers to be a little spicier, but that's all in the seasoning and is a quick fix. Will definitely make this again. Delicious!

This was good. I didn't really do anything differently except to use marinara sauce instead of tomato soup, and used the tomato chunks from the sauce in the filling instead of opening a can of tomatoes (I only made about 1/3 of the recipe). The cheese kind of got lost in the filling but it was pretty good, even though I'm not a huge fan of green peppers, especially cooked. I'm not sure I'd make these again... I might, but it would need to be on a weekend, as it took awhile and left a lot of dirty dishes. I enjoyed trying it though, thanks for the recipe!

I have used this recipe for Stuffed Peppers many times.  My family loves this version and I love the fact that the filling is fully cooked and in the pepper before hand.  For all the younger cooks out there, stuffed peppers were originally made using raw ground meat and cooked in the oven until fully done.  I've made three changes, I use onion cheese and I use a 28oz can of diced tomatoes, using one half in the filling and the other half in the sauce.  I also mince several garlic cloves and add to the mixture while cooking.   Aside from that I love the recipe as is.

I've made this a couple times now, and they have turned out awesome each time. They've won over non-pepper fans, including me I'm totally planning on waiting for a bag of peppers to be on the clearance rack, prepping these, freezing them, and taking them out one at a time, topping with soup and baking, for quick dinners. Yum!

LOVE!  Will make again - one change.  Add garlic salt and fresh ground pepper to taste to the tomato soup gravy.  Small step = big flavorful difference.

This was great!  Many have suggested adding Basil, garlic, etc...And I am sure that is good too, but I found this recipe to be "foundational" to great stuffed peppers!  Sometimes less is more, yet, I am tempted to add bacon or sasauge next time.  AND there will be a next time :)  Thanks again.

This was delicious! I never knew how other people get the pepper so soft and edible. Usually my version had a crunchy pepper and it would just go into the trash. But I followed this recipe exactly....It was fabulous! The filling was delicious! I was short on cheese, so bummer for me. But next time I will probably add just a bit more. (I love cheese with a passion.) I will definitely use this recipe next time!

I spiced it up a bit by using a can of tomato and green chiles, plus some chili powder and cumin. This is also a good one to prepare the night before-- then when ready to bake, add the tomato soup.

really good. i boiled my bell peppers for about 20 minutes. make sure you salt the inside of the bell peppers and add some sort of seasoning to the rice mixture or it will turn out really bland. thats what happened the first time i made this. also i added about a cup and a half of cheese instead of just the cup and didnt add water to my soup at all. turns out awesome with the changed!

These peppers were good, but very similar to other recipes I have tried.  Found the cheese to not stand out and just added more calories.

This was a good recipe, however, I also made some changes. I used 2 pounds of ground turkey instead of 1 pound of ground beef, I also seasoned the meat as it was cooking as I prefer the seasonings to be cooked into the meat, not added after it is cooked. I also used a can of diced tomatoes instead of whole, 1cup of rice and 1 cup of water instead of half a cup of each and used two 15 ounce (I think) cans of tomato sauce instead of tomato soup and water. I also added one 4 ounce can of sliced mushrooms to the mix. I also filled the peppers half way and tomato sauce then finished filling them and then topped off with more sauce. I forgot to mix the cheese into the filling so I just sprinkled it on top. I had extra filling so I just spread it in the pan around the peppers and also topped it with cheese and sauce. I found an ice cream scoop works well for filling the peppers. Very good, my dad very rarely has seconds and he ate two of them.

Loved the recipe as is, but, for the times that you're in a hurry, canned/jarred spaghetti sauce subbed for the tomatoes & soup is delicious also--my grandkids like it better that way!

Really easy, nice and tasty. Added brown rice and no tomato soup. Make sure you add enough salt.

Excellent recipe, and very easy to make.
I sliced my bell peppers in half, because that's the way I remember my grandmother's, and doubled the cheese, because my family loves cheese.
Cooking the rice with the can of diced tomatoes gives a slightly spanish rice flavor and adding a little fresh oregano and basil suited my family's taste also.
Thanks for the great recipe

Really very good.  I used only 1 can of tomato soup, 1/2 in the meat and 1/2 over the top.  I added several cups of fresh spinach and 2 cloves of garlic.  Don't skip the Worcestershire Sauce.  It really adds a neat flavor.  I added the peppers to ice water after they blanched to seal the green color bright and to stop the cooking so they wouldn't become mushy.  I highly recommend doing this.

Good base.  I made as stated first and my rating is based on the recipe as stated. I made changes which would bump this up to four stars, but I'm not sure if I can remember all of the changes.  Basically, it needs more flavor - Italian spices and perhaps cumin, garlic, etc. Also, I used mozzarella cheese and served with mashed potatoes.

These are excellent stuffed peppers! I like that the green peppers and meat are pre-cooked. The peppers are tender without falling apart. To save time I just use a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes. I also use lean ground beef, and they work well with regular or reduced fat cheddar. When done I top with a little bit of cheese and broil on low for 2 minutes. Thanks, Suzanne.

This is just a little different than I've made stuffed peppers in the past but this recipe is so delicious!! The only thing different was adding the worcestershire sauce and the tomato soup, both of which added so much flavor!! I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of chopping whole tomatoes, I cooked the rice by itself and then added it to everything else. And I added a little more cheese on the top of the peppers after I poured the tomato soup.  So so yummy! I will use this recipe from now on when making stuffed peppers! Thank you!!

This recipe was absolutely delicious. The pepper was tender, the stuffing was fantastic and full of flavor. I did do some modifications to the original recipe to tweak the taste: doubled the Worcestershire sauce | added 1 tsp of basil and oregano to meat mixture | added two cloves of minced garlic to meat mixture. When layering the peppers, I went with (starting from the bottom) Cheese, Beef, Sauce, Beef, Cheese, Sauce. This made for an absolutely hearty dish that I will certainly make again.

Usually the first time that I make a recipe I follow it as closely as possible. These were an exception which I decided to change to a mexican style dish. I seasoned the meat with a taco seasoning packet, used enchilada sauce instead of tomato soup and used diced mexican style tomatoes. I also followed other’s suggestions and put some of the sauce half way in the pepper, which helped to keep things moist. I then topped the peppers with more cheese and baked uncovered for 30 mins. The only change I will make next time is to use 1 cup of pre-cooked rice or use instant instead of long grain to speed things along. Great meal that I will use often, Thanks Suzanne

Very good. Better then any stuffed peppers I've made before. I made very slight changes. I added a tblsp hot sauce to meat mixture and some onion flakes, celery salt and a little italian seasoning to the tomato soup. I was afraid the soup on it's own would be to blah. Plus... I find 1 can of soup is plenty.  If I served over rice , 2 would still be a lot

The recipe called for 2 cans of soup.  I only used one, and it definitly did not need more than one.   I would also suggest adding more rice, I thought it could have been ricier.   Overall, I really enjoyed it, but my husband thought it was bland (he's crazy) and my kids 2, 5, & 8 didn't like it either.  But I did!

This is an easy-to-follow recipe that takes no time at all to make. A great way to add green peppers to the dinner mix, especially when you have a garden.  Experiment with this one - practically any meat or sseasons or even instant rice will work. They freeze very well, too, so make a big pot and you'll have quick, individual meals ready to go.

This is a good start, but I did it different and everyone is begging for the recipe now.  I used RED and ORANGE bell peppers. They are sweeter.  Instead of white rice, I used Rice Roni Spanish rice. I cooked the rice, and sat it aside. Since the rice calls for a can of tomatoes you don't have to worry about adding them later. Then I saute the onion, and some garlic and set aside. Then cook the meat, drain, add rice (as much or little as you like), add onion and garlic, and then I add a can of whole sweet corn.  I put cheese at the bottom of the peppers, stuff them, then put cheese on the top of them. I then add the tomato soup!   ENJOY!

this is one of the only dishes I've made that my husband hasn't made suggestions of what would make it better.  That's pretty amazing--he loved these.  The only ingredient change I made was using ground turkey instead of beef.  I served it with a small side of shell pasta, drizzled some of the extra sauce on top with a dash of Parmesan cheese.

This was really good but I made a few changes to it. I made this for 2 rather than the 6 the serving yields..... I don't understand why you are to boil the peppers for 5 minutes when they get fairly soft in the oven anyway so I didn't do this step. I cooked my onions and garlic in a dollop of real butter then added the ground beef cooked that through and added half a can of chopped tomatoes. I put a little more Worcestershire sauce, pepper, a good sprinkle of ground mustard, a pinch of thyme and a little paprika. Then instead of adding water....I think this makes any dish loose flavor...I added two tsp of tomato paste and stirred then turned off the heat and put half the cheese into the meat mixture and topped with the remaining cheese. I skipped the tomato soup altogether as I always add a little veg stock into the bottom of my pan  (just enough to cover the bottom) then put the peppers in so it has some moisture while cooking. The tomato paste gave it a great tomato flavor without being overpowering. These turned out delicious, they were moist enough but not overly "wet" and I got rave reviews on them. Oh before I forget I also cut the cook time down to 20 minutes at 180C/325F

This was really great! I didn't use the tomato soup to pour over the peppers, I instead mixed it with the meat and rice. I used soy sauce instead of W sauce and only used the cheese to melt on top. Before I added the cheese I topped them off with a little salsa. I would've given this recipe 5 stars, but felt it was missing a little something, but I'm not sure what. But definitely do not pass this recipe up. It is delicious in any case.

You use whole tomatoes because their flavor is much better than diced tomatoes. I always use whole tomatoes and chop them.  No brainer. These were very good.  I think everyone should adjust seasonings to your taste since everyone is different, but overall it was a delicious recipe.

This was delicious. I used red instead of green peppers. I thought that after 30 minutes, it was too squishy, but the pepper turned out to be quite sturdy and the meat stuck nicely to the sides and wasn't messy to eat. My rice did not cook fully, so next time I may precook the rice and add less water.  Overall a very delicious meal

This has been my go-to stuffed pepper recipe for about a year now. I always make the rice seperate though..the few times I tried making the rice with the other mixture, it never made the rice correctly, they were crunchy and took forever to cook. Making it seperately had helped a lot. I also use red peppers, as I like the taste better than green.

I have made these twice now and both times, everyone loved them.  THE ONLY change I made was to use 1 1/2 cans of tomato soup, tho one can would've been plenty, as they were quite juicy and there was quite a bit of sauce in the pan.  The are excellent re-heated, too!

My husband said these were the best stuffed peppers he'd every had.  The peppers were very good and not at all bitter like I've had in the past.  Very good!

Really good.....I've been making these for years and don't need to change to something exotic.  The only thing new was the tomato soup which I substituted for my normal tomoto sauce topping. When adding the canned tomatoes, I use either Rotel or Mexican-style diced tomatoes.  I also added about 2 tablespoons of the tomato soup to the hamburger mixture.  I don't like to change a recipe right out of the gate except maybe minor adjustments based on my personal taste or what I have on hand.

I have never made stuffed peppers before and this recipe turned out really good. I did goof and add an extra 1/2 cup of rice because the first 1/2 cup didn't look like enough to me but I was wrong. You only need 1/2 cup rice total as the recipe calls for. I also added lots more cheese to the top because cheese is my favorite ingredient.

Weight Watchers friendly!  I used 1 cup brown rice, 1 1/2 cups of water, 10 oz of 90/10 hamburger and Healthy Recipe Tomato soup and it ended up being about 4 points for each pepper.  Very filling and tasted GREAT!  Can't wait to have the leftovers!

I've made this twice now since I have had more peppers coming out of the garden then I know what to do with.  The meat filling is so good my husband said I can just make the middle and pour it over more white rice with sauce and he would love it! The only change I made was to add regular tomato sauce over the peppers instead of the tomato soup.

A family hit. I made some changes. Fresh chopped tomatoes instead of canned,2 cloves of garlic, minced, basmati rice added to the cooked meat mixture with 1 cup water and cooked til tender. I did not have cheddar so i used what I had which was a provolone/mozz/parm blend. I also used tomato paste mixed with water for the topping. Super yummy!

A good basic recipe definitely needs more flavor. I added 2 cloves fresh garlic and still was lacking a kick. Hubby liked it a lot. Maybe I will make for him and my son!

Very good recipe. I added garlic powder, italian seasoning, and mrs. dash origional seasoning to the meat to give it a little more flavor. If you have very large bell peppers like I did you may want to add more meat than the recipe says. Also use instant rice or pre cook the rice because mine didn't come out right according to the directions.

Absolutely delicious. I made a few little changes to make it a bit healthier (used brown rice with mushrooms instead of white rice and fat-free cheddar cheese instead of regular). I also added some chili powder to give it a bit more flavour—it turned out wonderful. This one is definitely a keeper.  Thanks for the recipe, it was great!

Great recipe, i made a few changes... I sauted the onions with 1 clove minced garlic and then added it to the meat after browning a bit added basil, oregeno and extra worchester sauce, i also cooked the rice seperate too. I took a couple of reviewers advice and filled the pepper up halfway with the meat mix, added some tomato soup, then more meat and topped it off with the remaining soup mixture. They turned out amazing, thank you!

This had way to much prep work due to pre cooking of ingredrients. 1st attempt I stuck by recipe instructions and the flavor wasn't there.  Second attempt I wanted flavor and smell I remember from childhood.  I decided not to pre cook the ingredients but add raw stuffing mixture to stuff peppers.  My end results on my second attempt at stuffed peppers was homemade comfort food flavor perfection. The green peppers do not have to be boiled prior to baking. The rice, onion and ground beef do not need to be cooked prior to stuffing the pepper.I increased oven temp to 375 and baking time to 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 hours. I used 3 medium green peppers and halved (6 servings), removed stem and seeds.I combined 1 pound raw ground burger (like you do when making meatloaf), 1/3 cup uncooked long grain rice such as basmati rice, 1/3 cup finely chopped raw onion, 1/4 teaspoon both oregano and basil, 1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce, dash of salt and pepper, and 1/2 can of a 15 oz can of tomato sauce. I mixed above ingredients and stuffed the half peppers.  I put peppers in a 9x13 baking dish then took the remaining 1/2 can of 15oz tomato sauce plus 1 full 15oz can of tomato sauce and combined in a bowl and used one of the cans to dilute the sauce with 1 full can of water then poured diluted sauce over peppers.  I covered peppers loosely with foil and basted the peppers every 20 minutes.  What a difference in flavor!

It was a good entry and made a good meal with a green salad on the side.
I made few changes though.
Using the same big saucepan, I first, sauted chopped onions and garlic until soft, put them in a bowl. In the same saucepan I browned the ground beef, drained the fat, added salt and pepper, some italian seasoning and one can of diced tomatoes and green chilies (rotel) drained. I let the ground beef few more minutes on the strove for flavors to come together than transfered it in the bowl with the onion. Again in the same saucepan I cooked the rice in some water and the juice from Rotel. I mixed the rice with the ground beef and added the cheese. I stuffed the blanched peppers with the mix and put them in a ovenproof dish. I used only 1 can of tomato soup dilueted with 1/2 cup of water.

very good! I will add only one can of tomatoe soup though, it was a little too soupy. I always add bacon slices on top. When it is close to ready, I turn on the broiler and crisp the bacon. awsome, thanks!

These turned out delicious, but I did make some changes based on some of the reviews I read and my own preferences.

We did 2 red/2 green/2 yellow peppers for variety.  I added 1 tsp garlic, 1 tsp oregano, 1 tsp thyme, and 1 tsp basil to the meat for some added flavor.  I also didn't waste the tops of the peppers and chopped any extra bits of pepper off them (not stems of course)and tossed into meat mixture.  Finally, I also added 2+ Tbs. of tomato paste and 2 handfuls of chopped fresh spinach to the mixture, as well as omitted the cheese (didn't want the extra fat).  Just sprinkled a very light dusting of parm on top.  Very quick, easy, and delicious for a weeknight meal.

Great recipe altho I did change & add some things.  For the green peppers, after cleaning them, I microwaved, cut side down, 4 minutes on high with a little water on the bottom of the glass dish.  I browned 1 pound pork chorizio (sp?) (it's what I had in the freezer), then added 2 onions, 1 cup uncooked rice, 1 cup water, 2 teaspoons worcestshire cooked for almost 15 minutes.  Removed from heat & added 2 cups shredded mexican cheese & instead of tomato soup I used a 26-1/2 oz can of spagetti sauce (half in the meat mixture & half on top after stuffing peppers).  Baked covered 25-30 minutes.  Will definetely make again.

This recipe was very delicious. I used ground turkey instead of beef.I added some montreal steak seasoning to the meat mixture. I also used colby-jack instead of cheddar cheese. Be careful with the worchesteshire as it can overpower the dish. The tomato soup is an excellent addition to this recipe...it wouldn't be the same without it. My 4-year old didn't care for the peppers but loved the meat mixture.
Thanks for the great recipe!

The only reason I gave this 4 * is because I changed and added a couple of things. This is a good recipe for those who have never made stuffed peppers before. It's quick and easy.  I mixed Sausage and Hamburger together to give the mixture some taste. I added chopped onion, seasoning salt,Italian Seasoning into the meat mixture. Do not cook the meat before adding it into the Peppers. It will be cooked well in the oven. This will prevent you from losing a lot of needed flavor that you lose when cooking the meat first.   Also, make sure that you use the Tomato Soup. It does give it the needed flavoring. Thanks for sharing Joe

Very tasty! I only made a few changes based on reviews and personal preference. I added garlic and diced mushrooms with the onions and meat, then used a can of diced tomatoes instead of whole, and added some rinsed kidney beans I had left over in the fridge. I also used Uncle Ben's 10 min. brown rice, Colby Jack cheese, and tomato sauce instead of soup (all I had). Very flexible recipe! Served with pan fried diced potatoes and black beans.

This is fantastic!  These are the best stuffed peppers I have ever had.  The only alteration I made to the recipe was to add a little bit of horseradish to the filling to give it a little kick.  This is a must try recipe

Other recipes I've made have been too bland but this one is really good.  I added corn to this.  Also, if you like things a bit spicier add some chili powder and instead of the whole peeled tomatoes- use Rotel tomatoes with chillies.  The tomato soup on top was perfect as well. =)

We LOVED this.  I made a couple of changes - I used ground turkey instead of beef, and at the suggestion of some, I put in some canned corn, and also used tomato sauce instead of the soup.  I added some oregano to the recipe as well.  This is a great recipe and very easy!

This recipe is just OK but "tweakable." Tomato soup is weird. Next time I'll use tomato sauce. I added 4 cloves fresh crushed garlic and one hot Italian sausage to help give some flavor.

I wasn't going to rate this because I always wonder why some people give bad ratings to dishes that so many others give a 5 star rating to, but while talking to a friend she said I really should rate and explain why we didn't like it.  My hubby told me he doesn't like stuffed bell peppers of any kind.  I thought when I read this recipe it sounded so good and with the cheese would make a great change for us.  When we ate it I was disappointed because I felt it should have tasted more cheesy and for me, it had a huge tomato flavor.  Don't get me wrong we enjoy tomatoes here, I was just expecting more of a cheesy flavor.

This recipe was great- replaced an old family favorite!! I love the use of tomato soup- adds more I think. I did not use canned tomatoes, just added a bit of the tomato soup and water mix. Also, no onion- picky eaters! I just loved them, so I took a picture to share- check it out under the pictures!

Would have rated 3.5 stars if 1/2 stars were an option. Like most reviews stated, this recipe needs some spices for added flavor but wanted to give submitted recipe a try without changing anything. I will try this one again but will definately modify to try and enhance this recipe. Among the many reviews there were several excellent suggestions including garlic, more worchestershire sauce, using italian sausage as well as the ground beef, more rice & water,

This is a pretty good recipe.  The tomato soup wasn't bad, but as my sister put it, it made it taste like hamburger helper.  Next time I think I'll pour a good tomato sauce or even a can of peeled chopped tomatoes.  That will give it more of a fresh taste.  Also, I've noticed that people are saying that it's kind of bland and needs more spices - well since this mixture is cooked before it is stuffed into the pepper, you need to taste it first and adjust the spices accordingly.  Never go by a recipe exactly since different people have different tastes.  If it needs more spices, add them!

This was one of the first recipes I kept off of allrecipes a few years ago.  
Instead of using the can of tomatos, I sub 1 can tomato paste and 1 can of tomato sauce. Instead of 2 cans of tomato soup, I use only one, otherwise it will be soupy. And the only other modification is that I blanche the peppers in half the time (2.5 minutes), or they will become bitter.

Had this for dinner tonight.  My husband rated it a 4, and my son rated it a 5 without the peppers, but an overall 4.  Reading the reviews, I was hopeful that my ultra-finicky 3 year old would try it, but she refused.  I changed the recipe slightly and really liked the changes.  I added some oregano and garlic salt for flavor to the meat mixture.  I also cut the peppers in half and stuffed them.  I think there was too much water, as I didn't drain the canned tomatoes, and I ended up having to drain some liquid before I stuffed the peppers.  The only real change I made was that I didn't have any tomato soup, so I used a small can of tomato sauce and added about 1/4 cup of brown sugar to it, I then poured this over each pepper.  It added a wonderful flavor, as the sauce sunk down into the meat mixture and baked.  Very yummy!

I gave 4 stars based on the potential of this recipe.  I didn't care for it this time, but next time I will change a few things.  I will double the amount of rice, omit the tomato soup all together and add more spices - these were a little bland.  Next time they'll be perfect!

The family loves this one!  Even my picky eater ate an uncommonly large portion!  I made these as one of my once-a-month-cooking recipes.  I made them, and then froze them to serve later.  

I used a can of tomato sauce with a teaspoon of garlic powder in place of the tomato soup.  I also added some fresh garlic and a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce.  Next time I with use a little bit more rice.

This made a quick easy meal but was not as good as the recipe I usually use.  It was very bland to me.  We added lots of salt and powdered garlic at the table in order to eat it.  Wish I added some spices to the stuffing.

This recipe was SOOOO good.  I did use 1/2 sausage and 1/2 ground beef, a bay leaf when cooking the rice and a beef bouillion cube as well, as suggested by other reviews.  I also had to add 1/4 cup more water, and simmer for an extra 6 minutes.  My boyfriend and I cannot WAIT to eat this for lunch tomorrow, and make this again.

I'm lactose intolerant and made the recipe without cheese.  The green pepper was tender, the rice was cooked to perfection but it wasn't as flavourful as I expected.  I added more salt and "voila" the taste came alive!  I also added bay leaf and oregano to the meat mixture when cooking.  My husband ate it hours after I cooked it (I also had a nibble) and I found it tasted even better than it did when I first cooked it.  Enjoy!

I think this recipe was great! It had a great taste and was pretty easy.  I reduced it to 4 servings. Next time I will use more beef tho, I barely had enough to fill 4 small peppers, and I will try putting cheese in the bottom of the pepper before filling it. My Peppers sat over night so I think the tomato soup was able to seep down into them, but next time I think I will try filling them with a little beef then soup then beef then soup.

I made these stuffed peppers for my family. I followed advise from other reviewers: cutting the peppers in half lengthwise, adding a can of diced tomatoes (I used tomato with diced jalapenos), adding garlic to the meat, and I doubled the worcestershire sauce. I cooked a box of beef flavored rice before adding it to the meat (I didn't have to season with salt and pepper). I added tomato soup inside the peppers before filling with meat. Also, I used yellow, orange, and green peppers; all were tasty and varied in flavor. My family really liked the recipe, only was missing texture. I think next time I will top the peppers with Parmesan cheese, for added crunch.

This is a good starter recipe but it lacked enough flavor in my opinion. 

I know it sounds terrible but I originally wanted to make these because I fell in love with Stouffer's version and wanted a homemade comparable. I still like the flavor of the Stouffer's ones more after making this without any changes (pretty bad, I know).

Next time I will probably try these things:
- Boil peppers a little longer to make a tad softer.
- Use tomato sauce instead of tomato soup
- More water needed to cook rice, or use 1/2 the tomato sauce instead of or w/ water to add flavor
- Use diced tomatoes instead of whole
- Add Italian Seasoning to taste (about 1/2 tsp)
- Add Garlic Powder to taste (about 1/2 tsp)
- Add Seasoned Salt to taste (about 1/2 tsp)
- Add more Worcestershire sauce
- Add Soy sauce (same amnt as Worcestershire)
- More cheese maybe or Italian blend kind?
~ Play w/ flavors more to get it perfect.

But like I said it's a good start.

Served with Golden Sweet Cornbread recipe muffins and a simple tossed salad (1 romaine head, 1/2 red onion, 1 tomato, 1/4 shredded carrot, and shredded cheddar).

I thought these turned out really good but I would suggest cooking the rice first because when I made these the first time and followed the directions it was still too crunchy. Also I used ground turkey instead of ground beef. Other than that, I think this is a great recipe that is healthy and full of flavor.

My family loves this recipe, including my daughter who doesn't usually like bell peppers. I subbed ground beef with lean turkey, I subbed white salt with seasoned salt, sautéed 2 cloves of fresh garlic along with the onions and turkey, added Italian seasoning to the meat mixture and doubled the Worcestershire sauce. After stuffing each pepper, I topped with pasta sauce (roasted garlic Preggo) instead of tomato soup. I then used any additional cup of cheese to top each stuffed pepper, then finished each off with Italian seasoning. It was great. I served with Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread, another grey recipe from allrecipes.com. Such a wonderful meal. My daughter says it is the only thing better than In N Out Burgers' animal style fries. Haha

After reading reviews, I adjusted, I halved 4 red bell peppers ( I don't like green bell peppers), I cooked the rice separately in chicken broth ( would've used beef broth but forgot to buy any), used about 1 1/2-2 cups of rice.  I tripled the Worcestershire sauce, used 2 cans drained diced tomatoes with oregano and basil seasoning.  Added Italian seasoning.  Topped with tomato sauce instead of soup, and mixed more Italian seasoning with it.  Topped with cheese during last 5min of baking.  Was delicious, and will make again.

I have been making this recipe for years. It is very moist and great tasting with the cheese added. I usually add more onions, and worcestershire sauce. Very good dish. I think I will follow one suggestion to microwave the peppers, instead of putting them in boiling water. This will save time.
4-3-19... fill the peppers half way with meat mixture, then add some soup mixture, then top off the pepper with more meat mixture.  They come out so much more moist this way ,instead of just putting the soup just on top.

I thought it was more than a wonderful base recipe.  We all take recipes & tweak to our own taste buds, so that is what I did.  I increased the onion to one half, added a stalk of celery, two garlic cloves chopped & as others suggested extra Worcestershire  sauce.  I used one cup "cooked" rice, Rotel diced fired roasted tomatoes with chilis, cayenne pepper, a little italian seasong (dont know why, just cause i use it allot) seasoning salt, lemon pepper, 1/2 can of Mexican corn. In the end, i just added the tomato soup to the entire mixture.  All was done taste testing along the way of course.  This lovely mixture was generously stuffed into brightly colored yellow and orange par boiled peppers.   Then before putting in the oven, topping with yummy ooey gooey cheese & crunchy panko  crumbs.   Mmmmmmm,  the elation of my taste buds say "its a keeper"!  Because I used more hamburger than recommended & other additions that increased the quantity, I had some left over stuffing.  I labeled this & put into the freezer for some day when I need a short cut meal.

This had such a better flavor than the recipe I grew up hating. We liked it and I will make it again. I cooked the rice separate because that is something I never liked about my mom's; crunchy rice. I do not like green bell pepper so I used red. I also used roasted red pepper soup because I don't but condensed soup. I also added cilantro but it didn't add that much to the flavor as I thought it would. Thank you for making this something I would be interested in eating again.

Love these peppers. They are made different than what i grew up on. My mom used to stuff them with the raw meat and then cook them. Almost like a cabbag roll. These are so much better. I took the most helpful review and tweeked my recipe a little. I used a little sauce instead of tomatoe soup and kicked up the spices too!! I used diced tomatoes also.

Delicious!  My first whack at Stuffed Peppers and they turned out fantastic!  I did add a bit of tomato and cheese inside the peppers.  I think this recipe would taste great with chicken instead of ground beef, and a tablespoon of fajita seasoning. =)  Almost like a fajita stuffed pepper!

Tweaked a little upon other reviewers suggestions...used already diced seasoned tomatoes, added fresh garlic to meat and onion mixture and used beef broth instead of water... Very Good but not the best I have had...

I don't like bell peppers, but my hubby has been asking me to make these for years so I did it for him.  Although I didn't like the peppers, I loved the filling!  I didn't measure the cheese (cause really, who does that?!?!  lol) and next time I will try it with red/orange/or yellow peppers instead.

I think this recipe was absolutely wonderful! My family devoured these stuffed peppers in no time. I am giving this recipe five stars because full credit goes to the person who posted the recipe with a few minor adjustments that I made. The few things I changed were: As I was frying the beef mixture and onion, I added minced garlic. I used already diced fire roasted tomato's by hunts instead of using whole tomato's and having to chop them, I used beef broth to add to the flavor instead of using water, I used Ragu Garden Combination instead of tomato sauce(again, adding to flavor). Also, half way through stuffing the peppers, I put a little of the Ragu Garden combination in the middle with a smidget of cheese. As for the seasonings like the salt and pepper, I did season to my taste, adding one basil leaf or you can sub using a dash of crushed basil. This recipe was full of flavor by the time I finished adding my touches and this recipe will definitely be a keeper for me and my family. Thank you!

I used this recipe and the reviews i read as a base and added/made changes to my liking. after the changes, the stuffed peppers tasted AMAZING! I cut the recipe in half, here are my changes - I used brown rice (which i precooked separately in chicken broth for more flavor) ground turkey instead of beef, and  half a can diced tomatoes with Italian seasoning. i omitted the W sauce cause i didnt have any. I cooked the beef with the onions and garlic, then i seasoned the mixture with a dash of garlic powder,dried basil,seasoning salt,pepper. I then added the tomatoes and also a tablespoon of ketchup (from another review). i opened the tomato soup and mixed it with some milk to make a more creamy sauce and also added some seasoning to that (dried parsley,garlic powder,dried minced onions)and put a few heaping spoonfuls of the "sauce" into the beef. then i added the cooked rice and added a small bunch of fresh chopped cilantro (this REALLY added to the dish!!!) I then added italian cheese instead of cheddar, layered half a slice of pepper jack cheese on the bottom of the green peppers and then added the mixture. topped off with more sauce and cheese and a sprinkle of bread crumbs. THIS DISH BLEW OUR MIND! we LOVED IT! and it was so filling and delicious.. will be making again. i know i made lots of changes, but thank you so much for the base recipe!

I had a pound of ground beef and a little left over rice – researching Allrecipes ‘ground beef and rice’ this stuffed pepper was one of the recipes coming up. Also on hand was left over Ragu spaghetti sauce. I pretty much used the Ragu instead of opening up another can of anything tomato. Also – so I cooked a little more rice in water and made 1/3 of the liquid Ragu with Italian spice (read a pile of reviews, did rice separately) cooked ground beef, drained fat, then cooked onions and garlic (another review suggestion) added maybe two tablespoons of Worchester and put all ingredients together - less the cheese. Tasting it – I can see why another reviewer used catsup – about 2 tablespoons did the job. Added cheese to what I’d be using tonight and put some cheese in the bottom of to be stuffed green pepper – another reviewer suggestion (I love this sight for great reviewers!) anyway – this turned out pretty good. I have enough ‘stuffing’ to do this again. I only added cheese to what I used today.

It was quite yummy!  However, I think filling the peppers halfway with the beef mixture adding a bit of the tomato sauce first and then filling up the rest with beef mixture and topping with tomato sauce again is the way to make this better.  I would also do less beef more rice next time.

I cooked the rice separately.  And cooked the ground beef with onions.  While the beef & onions were draining, I microwaved the peppers for 3 minutes.  I cut them in half prior.  Then I mixed the rice, beef mixture, already diced tomatoes (Rotel brand - HOT - one can), & Worcestershire sauce (used 2 tsp) and 1/4 cup pasta sauce.  I poured pasta sauce in the bottom of the baking dish, then added the peppers with cheese before I added the stuffing, then topped with remaining cheese.  I baked at 350 until the cheese was bubbling.  My husband loved it!  I will definitely make again.  I may use a different cheese or combination of cheeses next time.

This was excellent. I took the advice of reviewers and added the soup halfway through and then topped off the peppers with it as well. I added minced garlic to the meat mix and used italian seasoned canned tomatoes and used an italian cheese mix to the top instead of cheddar. It was REALLY good! Instead of water in the mix, I actually used the juices from the can of seasoned tomatoes.

This recipe was a great starting point for me.  I switched it up a little...I used ground turkey instead of beef...I used diced tomatoes instead of whole peeled tomatoes...I used more than a teaspoon Worcestershire sauce (not sure how much just poured some in)...I used mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar cheese (personal preference)...used Classico tomato and basil sauce instead of tomato soup

Also, while browning my meat, I used a little seasoning salt, pepper, garlic powder, and accent…

I stirred some of the mozzarella cheese in as well as sprinkled some on top before baking...
I also parboiled the peppers for about 10-15 minutes instead of 5 minutes...

All-in-all this was a great recipe and the peppers were delicious...my fiancé said that this is something that I can cook for him every week!!

I love these stuff peppers!  I use really big peppers so it needs a little more meat.  I add 1pd. Italian sausage along with the ground beef.  I also mix half of the tomato soup with the meat before I put the meat mixture into the green peppers.

Followed this recipe exactly. So good. I guess I put a little extra cheddar cheese on them in the final 5 minutes. My mom used to top her stuffed green peppers with ketchup and I wasn't sure the tomato soup would be as good, but I really liked it.

I've never eaten stuffed peppers before but this dish looked so good I wanted to try it and I'd have to say it was very good. My husband really liked it too. I made it with ground turkey and brown rice to make a bit more healthy. I will definitely be making this again!

Good recipe, but we didn't care for the use of tomato soup, rather go with a jarred tomato sauce or make my own. I use an assortment of colored peppers..overall, worth making, good homecooked affordable meal. thanks for sharing

I wanted to try something new. I've never been a fan of stuffed peppers. This recipe has changed my mind 100%. I modified a few things but that's it. My husband raved about them. They taste just as good the next day as leftovers!!!

I follow the recipe but I add it cayenne and instead of the can of whole tomatoes I use "salsa del Pato" to make it spicy, I used fresh tomatoes also.  My husband like them a lot, thank you.

Easy recipe and very tasty!  I usually make these with red peppers rather than green.  They are a little sweeter.

This is the best stuffed pepper recipe I've found! I just used a can of diced tomatoes instead of chopping whole ones.

A good solid recipe.  I felt it could be a great recipe with a few tweaks to the meat filling.  I found it to be a touch on the bland side.  I added some garlic powder and some oregano and that improved the flavor a great deal.  I would also recommend some more shredded cheddar.  One cup virtually disappeared into the meat mixture.  Another cup or so would have given it a nice cheesy consistency.  All in all, however, a good strong recipe and I will be working with it again in the future.

This was good!  I used crushed tomatoes and also mixed most of the sauce in with the meat mixture because many people said that the juices didn't sink down to the bottom.  I used the tomato soup to spoon on top.  My husband likes it saucy!

I followed this recipe pretty close except I used brown rice instead of white. I think it would have been better with tomato sauce or spaghetti sauce beings all I could taste was tomato soup. Not a big fan but my hubby loved it. Will make again with a few changes. Thanks for a decent recipe.

Yum!!!  My family and I really enjoyed these.  I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of chopping a can of whole tomatoes. For stuffing I used 3 green peppers and 3 red peppers.

The first time I made this, I stuck to the recipe exactly, and the family loved it. The second time, I increased the rice (and water) to 3/4 cup, took the meat down to 1/2 pound, and added a small, finely diced, zucchini (so my family wouldn't notice). And? Everyone still loved it!! Got to hide in extra veggies and fiber when I can :D

I liked the idea of adding garlic to this recipe, but it needed a little more for me, so I lightly sprinkled red pepper flakes (about 1/4 tsp.) and the flavor was enhanced.  I will make this again.

absolutely LOVED this! taking the advice of others, I too added a bit of the tomato soup to the bottom of the green pepper, stuffed halfway with the meat mixture, added more sauce, then finished stuffing with meat. DELICIOUS! The whole family gobbled it up! Will definitely use this recipe again and again!

Excellent recipe!!  Very yummy.  My husband likes a thicker sauce so I don't add any water to the tomato soup.  I also like to top the peppers with a little bit of cheese.  This has become a family favorite.  Thanks for sharing!!

Only 4 stars because I ended up adding 3 cups of water to cook the rice.  The 1/2 cup listed was not nearly enough. (I used brown rice, maybe this was why?)

Other than that it was delicious. I used turkey sausage instead of ground beef. And you should probably use medium sized peppers and not the ginormous peppers I used or you won't have enough filling :-/

This is a good starting point for a stuffed green peppers recipe.  I used tomato sauce instead of tomato soup (that does not sound appetizing), turkey sausage instead of beef, and mozarella cheese instead of cheddar.  The boyfriend and I loved them : )

these were my first attempt at stuffed peppers. I modified the recipe a bit- used 2 regular tomatoes diced up, brown rice (cooked separately and added into cooked meat & onions), fresh minced garlic, and one can tomato soup added to meat & rice mixture without adding any water. cooked for 20 min. and they were perfect! gave it 4 stars only because it did not have a ton of 'wow' flavor which I think if made with sausage it may have. Overall- I would make these again!

Very good!  Replaced the tomatoes with Rotel tomatoes with mild chilis and added powdered garlic, powdered onion, and season salt and put cheese on top not in meat.  Also used a family size tomato soup and put two very large heaping spoons full in meat mixture and the rest on top.  Very good and I will put it in the regular rotation exactly as I made it, I wouldn't change a thing.

I LOVED this recipe. I changed some stuff - used half ground turkey and half sausage. I season the sauce with Fresh basil, oregano and thyme and garlic. I also cooked my rice separatly with chicken broth, and added later. I served it with sautéed spinach, and some dinner rolls. I also used whole grain rice, and I would bet my savings that no one could tell the difference!! Also, used tomato sauce instead of tomato soup, that I seasoned as well!

These are the best stuffed peppers.  I have used green, red and yellow!!!  I use one can of tomato soup and one small can of tomato sauce and spice it up a little.  Also use stewed tomatoes and chop them up a little. Use brown minute rice that I cook in the microwave.  Awesome!!! Thank you!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It was easy to make and my husband loved it.  I didn't have a can of tomato soup in the house, so I substituted about 3/4 of a jar of Spaghetti Sauce.  It really added good flavor to the peppers and the meat mixture.

Best stuffed peppers I have ever had! I had the same difficulty with the rice. I probably added another cup+ of water and simmered about 35 minutes before the rice was even close to tender. This could be my high altitude combined with my general ineptitude when it comes to rice.

Definitely be generous with salt and pepper. I added crushed garlic and red pepper flake as well.

I made a few changes: turkey (85/15) instead of beef, cut the peppers lengthwise, used only 3 (large) peppers, used a whole onion and 5 cloves of minced garlic, didn't drain turkey/onion mixture, used diced tomatoes with oregano and basil, added basil, rosemary, and sage that I had on hand from the garden, and baked uncovered.

The final product was very good.  I was full from one half pepper.  I will definitely make this again.

I make this recipe all the time. My husband LOVES it, but with one major modification. I use red peppers. They are sweeter, more easily digested and we don't burp them all evening. Try it with the red peppers instead of green. I think it's prettier, too.

This recipe, as written, is great!  We didn't change anything.  It's really moist and the tomato soup makes the flavors "pop" in your mouth.  Thank you Suzanne.

We loved this recipe. I made a few changes since my husband doesn't like any type of tomatos on stuffed peppers and because I used brown rice and didn't want them to be dry. I eliminated the soup and added garlic. The cheese was the best! They were wonderful, moist and delicious!

I REALLY enjoyed these! The only reason I gave this four stars was because instead of using whole canned tomatoes, I bought diced tomatoes with chiles, so it added a lot of yummy spice! Excellent recipe, I will definitely make again!

These are delicious and easy to make.  I've made them several times, and I just omit the cheese from the mix and instead sprinkle parmesean on top.  Thank you for the recipe.

Made these last night and was pleasantly surprised with my end product.  I thought they were easy to make and flavorful.  I used 1 1/2 lbs of lean ground beef and it was just enough for 6 peppers.  For more flavor I would use ground chuck or a 85% lean ground meat.  I also used a can of already crushed tomatoes and it worked well, bascically to cut back on the time.  Of course I added extra cheddar cheese which topped them of perfectly.  This was my first attempt at stuffed peppers and am satisfied with the flavor, ease of preparing them and relatively inexpensive to make.  Completely satisfied.  Enjoy!!

I made this last night and thought it was pretty good. Only problem was after filling 4 1/2 of the peppers, i ran out of the filling. Will just double it next time when i buy bigger peppers. Served with garlic mashed potatoes :) thanks!

OMG! improv is great. Started with the basics  here but instead of beef and rice, I substituted a brand name "dirty rice" mix.  While the rice mix was cooking, I rubbed olive oil on 4 large green peppers and placed them in a 350 oven (20 min). Used 1 can diced tomatoes (salt free) and 1 can tomato soup which smoothed out the sauce. When the dirty rice was ready, filled 4 peppers to the brim, poured on sauce and returned to oven for 35 mins. @ 350. Served with mashed red potatoes with garlic. Magnificent and no additional spice needed. The olive oil rub left some crispy to the peppers.  Great!

These were okay. I do like the cheese that is added into the recipe but with this being my first time making them I would never used the tomato soup again....Tooo sweet!
Next time I will try it with tomato sauce and more spices....

Instead of whole tomatoes,I used 2 cans of rotel. for the sauce I also used 3 cans of tomato soup...but we like our peppers in a bed of juice. I listened to another reviewer and sprinkled the bottome with shredded cheese. I have made this with mild cheddar and again with sharp...either one is great.

These were delicious! The only change I made was to use 1 can of condensed soup instead of 2 and to use leftover (cooked) rice. I just stirred it in and skipped the simmering.

The stuffing is actually tasty on its own. If you're extra lazy, you can saute or grill the bell pepper separately and throw it into the rice mixture instead of stuffing the peppers.

Loved these! Great flavor. Per other reviews, I cooked everything separately (ground beef, rice, onions). Added teaspoon or two of garlic while cooking onions. Brought everything back together in one pan and added 2 teaspoons worcestershire, basil, oregano, italian seasoning, and tomatoes. Will make again!

Yum!!! I skipped the worcestershire sauce and added some of a morroccan spice blend I had (it`s the only thing I could find) and I used red peppers instead of green. Also for the sauce on top, I added 2 tablespoons of white vinegar and 2 tablespoons of soya sauce (I`ve been using this mix in a beef stir-fry and trust me, it`s a lot better than it sounds, worth trying!!!)
Was really really good!!! Thanks!!!!

I just made Stuffed Green Peppers I, and really enjoyed them.  I made one change.  I happened to have a boxed container of Red Pepper Soup, and decided to add that instead of tomato soup.
It really added to the flavor!

Very yummy. Pretty healthy too! I used brown rice. The boiling of the peppers before is a must. Makes them very tender. I added a can of mexican corn to the mixture. I also used 1 can of tomato soup and 1 can of enchilada sauce for the gravy.

I used brown rice, added garlic, oregano, and basil, cause there were not spices in the recipe.  I used spaghetti sauce cause I didn't have any tomato soup.  Disappointed in the lack of flavor, even with the added spices.  I'll keep looking for another recipe.

This recipe really doesn't have any herbs and spices to it.  Therefore, I have added lots of garlic, italian seasoning, a can of chopped olives and used a can of pizza sauce in place of one of the cans of tomato soup.  I would also suggest that if you like cream cheese and parmesan cheese that you put some of this into the mix as well.

i am extremely disappointed that the rice never fully cooked even after cooking the peppers in the oven for 45 minutes!  What a waste!  I vegetarianized the recipe. I used soy crumbles instead of ground meat. I also used lots of garlic, basil and oregano. I also boiled the peppers for 5 minutes prior to stuffing. I punctured holes in the bottoms of the peppers so it wasn't too soupy like a previous review said. i also added soy cheese instead of regular cheese. I added 1/4 cup of red wine to the "meat" and onions while they cooked.   i think if i had used frozen precooked rice, this recipe would have been fantastic.

I added an envelope of beefy onion soup mix and cooked them in the slow cooker. Hubby loved this recipe so it's a definite keeper!

Cooked rice first & used a can of tomato paste instead of tomatoes. Also added garlic powder, chili powder and onion powder to the beef. Was amazing!

Best Stuffed Peppers ever!!!!  This is the only recipe I will use from now on.  I have experimented with other recipes, but this was the best, by far!  Love the use of tomato soup...it adds so much to this recipe.  A must try, enjoy!

These were wonderful even though I didn't boil my peppers first.  I just cut them in half and stuffed them.  The meat mixture was very tasty.  I'll be making these again....yum!

This was my first attempt at stuffed peppers, I thought it was a good base recipe but disliked some aspects of it. After reading some reviews I decided to add some garlic in while browning the meat, also a bit of sage, and a bay leaf. I used diced tomatoes insteaded of whole because I find the look a bit more refined; also used beef broth instead of water. The rice could have cooked for a bit longer than 15 minutes , I used long grain rice and although it was cooked it stil had a bit of crunch to it . After cooking I added the cheese to the mixture, half filled the pepper and added some of the diluted tomato soup the filled the rest, topped with more tomatoe soup and a bit of parmesan cheese. I feel the tomato soup made it taste cheap, next time I will make my own tomato sauce; thats one of the main things I didnt like about it.

I'm not really sure what the big deal is about this recipe.  I wasn't blown away, and cooked as is - its rather bland.  It definitely needs seasoning, and I ended up using fire roasted diced tomatoes, which gave it a kick.  I'll probably try to combine this with other recipes to perfect.  Thank you.

Yummy! Great base recipe, but I made several changes: Did not parboil the peppers, and they were plenty done for me after 30 min. in the oven. Used 1/2 lb beef, 1/2 lb turkey. Drained a can of diced tomatoes, and added a small can of tomato sauce to the meat mixture, instead of using the soup in the layering process.  Cooked brown rice separately but added it to the meat mixture and let it cook on the stove for a bit. Topped the peppers with cheese, instead of mixing it in.

SOOO GOOD...only if you add a lot more flavor.  i added 6 garlic cloves along with the onion and beef.  then added 1t. basil, 1t. oregano, 1t. thyme and doubles the worcestershire.  then to make it super easy, i added the tomato soup with diced tomatoes and cookeduntil gravy-esk.  i browned the peppers on the BBQ for 10 mins instead of boiling (adds tons more flav), assembled everything, then popped in the broiler till cheese was bubbly.  this way you dont have to cook for another 35 mins.  faster and easier!

I used sausage and a giant can of crushed tomatoes and divided it between the filling and the sauce that's poured on top. I did not have cheddar so used mozzarella. It was still awesomely delicious.  Sprinkled some Parm cheese after it was done baking and broiled it to golden brown. Sooo good!

Awesome! We loved it. I cut the recipe in half for the two of us and used only 2 peppers instead of 3. I cut the peppers long-wise (making 4 halves) as to make leftovers easier to take to work. I doubled the water for simmering. I also added another 1/4 cup of cheese to the beef mixture and then very generously topped each pepper with additional cheese.  (93)

My husband and I loved these!  Followed the recipe exactly as written as I always do the first time.  The only change I'll make next time is to reduce the tomato soup by 1 can, and I'll add a bit of extra cheese to the tops of the peppers just for presentation.  These are really great!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made it for when my husband got home and he ate it while I was outside and he text me to tell me they were delicious!!  I however made them with ground turkey and I also used turkey sausages which i cook on the bbq and chopped into little pieces.  I also chopped red peppers and mushrooms.  Then I used one can of garlic and herb tomatos and one small can of spicey tomatos and then I used one can of tomato soup and one can of cheese soup and mixed them together for the sauce.  With all the moisture from the tomatoes they weren't dry at all in the middle.  Very Very Very good.  I want to make them again very soon!!  One of my favorite meals so far!

Pretty good, but it took me longer on the prep time, and when you're trying to cook for a family and work, this is something to consider....plus lots of pots and pans to clean up. I added some chopped garlic and a pinch of cayenne to give it a bit more flavour, and I think that's the trick!

Yummy! I used ground turkey instead of beef, brown basmati rice, a can of diced tomatoes, i also added in chopped peppers with the onion. I did not mix in all that cheese either. I layered with a small bit of sauce on the bottom then filled half with the filling then a bit of cheese and sauce then fill to the top with filling and add more sauce and cheese to the top. It was so tasty and less fat and calories because I cut the cheese in half. I also used yellow and red peppers instead of green.

awesome, my wife loved them, did some things different, i did not add onions(she hates them) but used onion powder, then did everything else the same, but i used red peppers(a sweet flavor) and i cooked them in the crockpot for 8 hrs, put peppers in the pot and then added a can of tomatoe sauce and a can of stewed tomatoes so they would not dry out and they were great. 5 stars!

Made these tonight.  Read the recipe wrong and accidently mixed the soup in with the meat mixture before spooning into peppers.  Added 2 cups of left-over colby-jack...Fabulous!

Delicious! These are my favorite stuffed peppers ever. I disagree with the recommendation by some other posters to cut the rice in half, though. I cut it in half and wish I hadn't.

I love these stuffed peppers.  I had never tried stuffed peppers before this recipe now I have made these 2x.  My kids and husband love them and they were a hit at a dinner party.  I made a couple changes...I used Organic Marinara Sauce to top the peppers instead of tomato soup...YUM that is good.  I added fresh garlic to the onions and sautéed with the beef.  I added Italian Seasoning and a little extra Worcestershire as previously recommended and also added some cayenne for a little kick.

LOVED this recipe! I would like to use more tomato sauce next time though.  I also used all ground turkey instead of beef.  So good!! And great warmed up later.

Like others, I will rate this 4 instead of 5 because of the changes I made.  VERY TASTY WITH THESE CHANGES: Taco seasoning with burger and onion;  Tomatoes with italian spices (save 1/2cup for sauce);  Add- 1cup uncooked br. rice, cooked separately.  Over top, i used leftover spaghetti sauce, 1 can tom soup, rest of tomatoes, and Mrs. Dash red pepper blend.  This stuffed 5 yellow peppers, cut in half.

This was an excellent version. Like a lot of the other reviewers, I mixed the tomato soup in with the meat mixture instead of pouring it over the top. It was moist and had a lot of flavor. Will make again.

It was okay. Not a lot of flavor in the meat. I suggest using 4 or 5 diced garlic cloves with the onions.

This is absolutely divine! I grew up with stuffed bell peppers and never thought I would be able to top my mom's recipe...but I now stand corrected! This blew her recipe out of the water! My husband loves this recipes, and it is the only way I can get him to eat bell peppers! Thank you!

Love this recipe, but it does need extra seasoning. I liked that it wasn't too much rice and I used ground chicken to cut down on calories. I added some seasoning to the meat mixture and the soup, I think it could've used more. But, it was great, easy comfort food.

I made a vegetarian version of this and used fake steak strips.  It came out fine, but I would certainly use more rice, more cheese, and less "meat" next time.  Otherwise they were quite tasty!

Changed a few things including making it with a half pound of italian sausage and a half pound of hamburger.  Really made a taste difference.

I mixed the tomato sauce in with the beef mixture and spooned it all into the peppers all together instead of pouring it on separtely. It turned out great and was pretty easy.

Awesome! Even the kids that swear that don't like stuffed green peppers ate this and loved it! Of course, they still didn't eat the pepper! Also, a tip I learned from my mother is to use drained canned sauerkraut and use it to go underneath each pepper so it will not burn on the bottom of your baking dish. Honestly, the kraut with the stuffed green pepper tasted really good! Yummy, I will definitely make this again! P.S. Precook the rice!

I made a few adjustments because I think if I made it the way the recipe called, it might be a bit bland.  I followed the recipe exactly but I also added some garlic powder, cumin and fajita seasoning mix.  It came out very tasty!!!!

My teenage boys LOVED these! I have 3 eating machines in my house and was needing to find a meal to use up some fresh green peppers I had that was filling. WOW! This was certainly it! I made 8 peppers and just about doubled the recipe. At first, when they saw a green pepper on their plates for dinner, they thought it was a joke...BUT My boys cleaned their plates and had more later after baseball! I did add cheese to the bottom of the peppers before adding rice etc... Will certainly add this to my "must make meals". Next time I will try in a crock pot while I'm at work.  Thanks for the recipe! Yummy!

This recipe was really good. I used other reviewers suggestions and used canned chopped tomatoes and beef broth instead of water.  The beef broth really rounded out the flavor.  I also filled peppers up halfway then sprinkled cheese and some of the soup inside and then filled them the rest of the way.  This insured they were moist through and through.

The flavor of the meat mixture was great. I did boil my peppers but I would of liked them to a little softer. I will boil them longer next time perhaps. Otherwise very good.

I am cooking this recipe right now, and I think it should be mentioned that instant rice may be needed, as the rice I put in there (gourmet rice) is still hard.  And I have already cooked it for  over an hour.

This was a great recipe!  My husband could not stop commenting on how great they were!  What I did differently:
4 lg green peppers; I used a lb of ground beef that was prepackaged for meatloaf from the meat counter; 1 cup of boil in a bag rice; 3/4 cup water; can of diced tomatoes seasoned instead of whole tomatoes; and used a jar of spaghetti sauce in place of the soup.  
We put some cheddar cheese in the bottom of each pepper before putting in the meat mixture. Thanks so much for this great recipe!

It has a lot of potential, but wasn't as flavorful as I was expecting.  I made it vegetarian by using Morningstar Farms "beef" crumbles.  I also added 4 oz of fresh sliced mushrooms when I was cooking the "beef".  I replaced the rice with quinoa and the water with veg broth.  I made some tomato basil soup last week, so I used that instead of canned soup.  Next time I will add more seasonings to the "beef" like crushed red pepper, minced garlic, and probably some oregano and thyme.  Overall, a very good starter recipe that I'll customize.

This get 5 stars with modifications, but the mods are necessary. 

I used basmati rice, and seasoned with lots of basil, oregano, italian seasoning, and pepper. Otherwise, I followed directions to a tee.

This was good, but bland.  Next time I make it I will chop up the tops of the peppers to put in the meat mixture.  I will also use italian sausage and a lot more spices, double the amount of cheese, and completely eliminate the tomato soup - instead I will put chopped tomatoes on top.

Turned out wonderful!  I used fresh from the garden green peppers.  I followed the basic recipe, but did make minor changes.  I did not boil the peppers ahead. I did cooked the rice ahead so I did not add water.  I also used fresh diced tomatoes, also from the garden, in place of canned tomatoes.  At the end substituted pasta sauce in place of tomato soup.  Since I didn't boil the peppers ahead, I did bake longer in the oven. I will make this again. Great basic recipe

I visited my parents' tonight and helped my dad make this. We all liked it! I microwaved the peppers until tender instead of boiling. Cooked the rice and beef seperate. Baked the peppers for 20 minutes and served with salad! (only needed 1 can of tomato soup). Also topped with mozzerella cheese.

*Made this AGAIN for dinner guest tonight. Everybody liked it!*

I would suggest using instant rice, I found that regular rice added about 45 minutes to the recipe.

I pretty much followed the recipe, only difference is I added ground turkey and ground beef, since I had both. I also used leftover rice which was already cooked and added a bit more cheese than the recipe called for. It turned out soooo good! It filled 6 large green peppers perfectly! I didnt add salt as the worscheshire sauce was salty enough. I will make this over and over again, my husband loved it!

I have tried  several different stuffed pepper recipes and I have to say this one is YUMMY, the only changes i made was to add some basil, rosemary,italian seasonings, garlic, and instead of the tomatoe soup I used the stewed tomatoes I can....Super Good! This recipe after some tweaking is now added to my recipe box!

Very easy and good recipe, only few changes that made it easier, only used 2 green peppers therefore4 halves, browned ground beef with clove of garlic and some onion power  and a dash of italian seasoning, when browned added 1 small can almer italian accents tomatoes (i pureed them before adding). Seasoned with season salt,  pepper and the worshershire sauce, used the same frying pan, put my peppers in and stuffed them then put sharp cheese on, the extra stuffing I left around the peppers, cooked like this,  turned out great.

I love this recipe! I have made it often, my family enjoys it. I made a few slight adjustments: I added about a tsp. of cumin and some (about 4-5 slices) crispy crumbled bacon to the meat mixture. I also cooked the rice 1/2 way on it's own before adding it. Lastly, I added fresh grated Parmesan cheese to the top before baking. Super yummy!!

These were honestly the BEST stuffed peppers I have ever had.  There really isn't much else to say!  I LOVE them.  I did use 2% reduced fat cheddar, Healthy Request tomato soup, and extra lean (96%) ground beef. YUM!!

This recipe is very good.  I followed directions the first time.  The second time I made these changes:  used lean ground beef, added some minced garlic, oregano, basil, parsley, used tomato sauce b/c I was out of soup, used whole onion.  I definitely recommend adding green tabasco as you eat, it compliments it well!

Great recipe. I altered a little by using lean beef, and added "herbs de provence" spice to the beef mixture along with extra garlic during the browning stage. 
I think the cheddar cheese really gave it a creamy taste. I used one can tomato soup on top mixed with a ladle of the boiling water from green peppers. My 17 month old daughter loved it....me too!

this recipes was very tasty, but i did tweak it just a bit. I used seasoned salt,not regular, and insyead of tomato soup, i used pureed and italian seasoned tomatoes. I would par-boil the peppers an extra 10-15 minutes, or bake it another 1/2 hour, since I think they were still a bit too crisp for what I like.

This was delicious. I didn't precook my peppers, I just baked this until the peppers were tender (about 15 minutes longer). I left out the canned tomatoes and added some of the tomato soup instead. I used about 2/3 can of water per can of soup. I partially cooked the rice since I was preparing some for another recipe anyway. This made just enough for 6 peppers but they were small/med sized. If they had been large, the filling would have been a little skimpy. This is just how my mom used to make stuffed peppers and the results were just what I was hoping for. Thanks Suzanne for posting this!

Yum!  Made as directed, adding a bit of stuffing to the pepper, a spoonful of sauce and then more stuffing.  They were very moist.  Had extra stuffing and just dropped it into the baking dish and covered w/ sauce.  Will try red or yellow peppers next time.  Using uncooked rice made the prep very simple.  Easy & delicious recipe - thanks!

This recipe is great. I made a few changes - I used yellow peppers instead of green. I found it was easier to cook the rice separately and then add it to the beef mixture after it was fully cooked. I used extra Worcestershire sauce and added minced garlic to the beef mixture. Excellent stuff!

Best recipe! I have made this 2 times and will make it a lot more. I add a little garlic and the tops of the green peppers with the onion to the ground beef. I only use 1 can of soup and stir half a can into the meat mix before stuffing the peppers. PERFECT! My 3 kids love it and they usually won't touch peppers. Thank you!!

I've made this one several times and love it. Don't overdo the cheese, it doesn't taste right.Also be careful not to overcook the peppers or else they will just fall apart and you can't stuff them with the rice/beef mixture. I serve with cottage cheese and maybe a slice of bread. Really easy to make and very good.

I love this recipe. It is very similar to the one in my Betty Crocker cookbook (now held together with rubber bands!) that I have made for years. I chop up the tops of the green peppers to add to the meat mixture but other than that, I follow it to the 'T'. Sometimes I double it and use the leftovers for soup by cutting up the peppers and adding another can or two of tomato soup and water. I also add a dash or two of Franks Hot Sauce to spice it up a bit. Very easy, quick and delicious.

I have been looking for a great stuffed pepper recipe and this one is it.  The only things I did differently were putting the canned tomatoes in the food processor to make it a smoother sauce and using store bought bottled tomato sauce in place of tomato soup.     This was delicious.

Fantastic recipe!  Quick and easy preparation.  Its also a fun recipe to alter.  I added Mexican chilli powder, and garlic, 1 can of corn, heaps of fresh cracked black pepper, and a mix of mozarrela and chedder cheese.  Like other reviewers, rather then use tomato soup I used my favorite spagetti sauce.  The end result was awesome, thanks for the recipe!

I'm going by my husbands opinion on these since I don't like stuffed peppers.  In his words, these were GREAT!  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used tomato sauce instead of the soup.  I did sample the filling before it went into the peppers and I thought it was quite flavorful.

The best stuffed peppers I have ever had!  My 3 year old and picky husband (who doesn't like peppers) even liked and ate them.  I cut the recipe in half and it worked perfectly.

So fabulous!  I tweaked the recipe to personal preference by adding minced garlic, chopped crimini mushrooms, a teaspoon of beef bouillon, and extra worchestershire sauce.  I omitted the cheese, halved the ground beef, and only used one can of tomato soup.  I cooked sweet glutinous rice in the mixture for 25 minutes.  This makes enough filling to stuff four large peppers cut in half.

Mmmmm...good comfort food!  I followed the recipe, but added extra spices based on other reviews-garlic, chiplote tabsaco, tomatoes with green chiles, extra sharp cheddar- and it was delicious!  Also, while I was waiting for the rice to cook (took me about 15 mins. longer than the recipe states), I added some additional water and added some chicken bouillon granules to it to keep the flavor intense with the extra water).  I loved the filling, but it was actually tastier when eaten with the peppers!!!!!  Who knew the peppers were good too??!?!?!?  (As a kid, I only ate the filling and I thought I didn't like green peppers, but I do in this recipe!)  Thanks so much for this recipe!!

We printed this out 12/27/01.  We made it tonight 03/06/2006 for the first time.  Boy have we missed out.  It does take a little time to prepare but the wait is worth it.

Substitutions: red, yellow and orange peppers; Red Gold petite diced tomatoes with sweet onions (no chopped onions); brown instant rice.

Very good! I use instant rice and a can of diced tomatoes with green chilis. Also, I don't boil the peppers ~ I don't like them so mushy and not boiling them keeps a lot of their flavor in. I use ground venison in this recipe a lot. Love these!

I thought it was very tasty, but I would have liked a little more flavor in the beef, some spice maybe. Next time I will red chili flakes to the meat while it's cooking.

The best stuffed peppers I have ever had! The consistency of the peppers was perfect, not too soft, not too hard. I used a tomato lentil couscous filling and everbody loved it.

Yummmmy!  Make sure to lay your green peppers on a flat surface before you buy them to see if they tip, because you don't want them to fall over while baking.

First off, I do not like bell peppers, but I LOVE this dish. I don't eat the peppers but the stuffing inside is the best. The only thing I change is: I use more Worcestershire sauce (probably 1 1/2 - 2 tablespoons) and season the meat with garlic powder, garlic salt and cumin while it's simmering, I add sliced mushrooms, use stewed tomatoes, and cheddar & Garlic Mozzerella (made by sargento's and is oh so yummy!). Thank you so much for the excellent recipe!!

Just o.k. for us... not bad, but not great either. Definitely needs more spices and more cooking time as others have suggested.

My husband had never had stuffed peppers and loved this recipe. I took the advice of others and added extra garlic powder and worcestershire sauce. In the future I will half the recipe as it doesn't taste as good the next day.

This was wonderful. I baked the empty peppers while I made my meat filling until I added the rice, then I took them out to cool. I also took the suggestion of adding a lot of garlic powder and I increased to 1/3 cup of Worcestershire since my husband will drink the stuff from the bottle. I also used about 2 cups of cheese and only 1 can of tomato soup. It turned out wonderful. This will become a regular dish at our house. Thank you!!

The 1st time I made this recipe I followed it to a T, the 2nd time I made I changed a few things and it was AWESOME....

I used 2 lbs ground meat 1 large white onion
1 can (28 oz) crushed tomatoes 1 cup water 1 cup rice LOTS of garlic powder, salt, pepper and a few shakes of ground red pepper.  I also used a bag of shredded mexican cheese.  It was THE BOMB.  I had extra stuffing, which I planned since my yongest kids do not like the peppers and I baked it in the oven next to the pepper just took it out 15 minutes early.

I hope you like my variation!

I made this recipe last night and found it has potential.  As one other review said it is tweakable and that's a big plus.  Some complaints were that there wasn't enough filling for the, I guess, too large peppers. There was something strange about the tomato soup for topping.  Next time I'll use tomato sauce.  Less cheese and more rice.  Other than that I thought it was very good and my wife loved it.  I will definitely use it again.

mmmm tasty! my boyfriend loved this one. He would rate a 5 and I would rate a 4 ONLy because I don't like bell peppers that much. the inside was awesome though. I used extra lean turkey meat, low fat cheese (colby and jack) i think next time i'll use cheddar. I also added chicken flavoring powder, oregano, parsley and garlic salt. I upped the rice and water and cooked for 10 minutes longer.  I also used half red bell peppers and green peppers. For the soup I used skim milk to add a creamier consistency. It was very tasty! thanks :)

Very good stuffed bell peppers.  I have made this dish several times with some adjustments made.  I use tomato sauce instead of water, I add a can of corn and I put a few dashes of taco sauce in the mix to add a zing to it.  The taco sauce does not make it spicy, but it adds more flavor.  Also, you need to spice it up a bit with onion and garlic powder otherwise there will not be much flavor.  The way I make it turns out perfect.  My husband and daughter beg for this dish at least once or twice a week.  Delicious!!!!

These were really good! It took longer than 15 minutes for my rice to get tender though (it was still very crunchy after 15 minutes -- I'm glad I checked!). I thought the cheese was a nice addition! The only thing I did different from what the recipe states is I used tomato sauce instead of the tomato soup. Everybody liked these! A very good recipe... Thanks!

Excellent!  My husband loved it.  Made a few changes, though...did things the "hard" way.  Used twice as much onion, diced fresh tomatoes (1 3/4 cups), and precooked Jasmine rice (2 cups).  I cut my peppers in half lengthwise before stuffing, covered with sauce (2 cans + 2/3 c water) and, finally, sprinkled a little extra cheddar cheese on top before baking. Yum - thanks so much for the wonderful recipe!

Very, very good.  I even persuaded my four year old to eat some (which is quite a feat!)  These were super easy to put together too.  I only used 1 can of tomato soup because I only had 4 peppers and it worked out great!  Quick and easy, you could even prepare these the day before and then just bake them off for a weeknight dinner.

This recipe is FABULOUS! My kids were a little leary about trying it because they said the meat mixture looked like "dog food", but one bite and they were singing a different tune. I did use feta cheese instead of the chedder because my kids like it better and it was still GREAT!!!

Mmmmm . . . yummy!  I've made this a couple times.  I use just one can of soup, and I tinker with the spices a little as previous reviewers have commented.  Everyone seems to love these.  MY DAD (who usually shrugs and says, "it's not bad," ate two and a half in one sitting and said how good they were!  Even my 15-month old says, "mmmmmm" while eating these!  :-)  

Thanks for a great recipe!

These stuffed peppers are really tasty.  I'm not the biggest fan of green peppers so I usually use red or yellow peppers instead (however they are a little more expensive).  I also normally leave out the tomato soup (I never seem to have any around) and the recipe still comes out very well.

I thought this was pretty good.  I substituted ground turkey for the ground beef- not bad, but I have a feeling it would be better with beef.  My husband enjoyed them.

I've tried several recipes but have never found one this good for stuffed green peppers.  The pepper is not tough and the tomato soup gives it just the right flavor combination.  Other guests have raved about it.  Even meets my mother's expectations.

Added a little BBQ sauce to the soup and ground beef.  Also topped each with mashed potatoes for that "individual shepard's pie" effect.  Great fun!

Excellent recipe!!!  We used ground turkey (with a beef bouilion cube) instead of ground beef and seasoned diced tomatoes instead of plain, and we loved it.  We will definitely make this one again.  I am now looking forward to the summer when I'll plenty of green peppers in the garden!

Abslolutely delish!!!  I only had 2 very large peppers, for my husband and myself, so I still made the whole recipe for the stuffing and froze what I didn't use for the next time.  Wonderful flavor.  I did use tomato sauce instead of the soup and it still was excellant.  This is a keeper!  Thank you for sharing.

I made this recipe the other night. I did leave out the cheese though. I put a bay leaf in during the cooking of the filling. I have been looking a long time to find the perfect suffed bell pepper. My search is over! Thank you Suzanne.

Very easy recipe that is delicious.  This is my go to recipe since I made it.  My husband and I prefer to use red peppers, or I will use a variety of colors for presentation.  It’s always very good and a great comfort meal.

I agree with “Rouver” in that I would add some more Worcestershire Sauce, some Italian herbs & fresh garlic to fill out the flavor profile. I also concur that it’s silly to buy a can of whole tomatoes and THEN dice them (unnecessary work) when the grocery already has diced tomatoes for this very purpose.I will make again with less or no tomato soup as unnecessary for my needs and taste. Campbell’s Tomato Soup is too iconic and recognizable (as in 1950’s) a flavor for me.

I am not a fan of stuffed peppers but these are very good. I like using red, yellow or orange peppers in place of the green. I also add some of the cheese to the bottom of the peppers before I fill them.

I stuffed myself silly with these peppers! I followed someone’s tip to fill the peppers halfway with the ground beef and rice mixture, then I added the tomato soup and filled the top of the peppers with more beef and rice. Delicious for me and my kids loved it too.

My peppers were huge so I doubled the recipe.  It was great.  I did take some leftover spaghetti sauce and put it in the bottom of the baking dish.  I boiled the peppers for 5 minutes and then put them in a storage bag to steam.  They came out soft and perfect.  Just a few ingredients and a great meal.

Love this recipe, but I made a few changes. I used red peppers instead of green... much sweeter taste. I used Goya yellow rice and cooked it separately from the beef mixture. After mixing everything together I used a small can of tomato paste with enough water to make sauce. Instead of using the tomato soup on top of the peppers I mixed it in with the beef mixture (one can). I also substituted a medium can of diced tomatoes for the whole. Omitted the cheese. Huge hit at my house that I make a couple times a month.

Delish recipe - reminds me of Mom's.  One change - we always roast the pepper a little (not boil).  Adds a great flavor and helps start the peppers cooking.  One tidbit based on another reviewer's note on why would you use whole tomatoes and dice them - the best tomatoes are packed whole.  The inferior tomatoes are used for diced and crushed.

Awesome recipe (with suggestions from the other reviewers)!!! I used ground turkey and added Ragu's chunky tomato, onion, and garlic with the tomato sauce/diced tomatoes for a little extra flair. Worked out perfectly! Definitely a keeper! Served with roasted brusselsprouts and garlic bread.

I did everything like the recipe said but I added minced garlic, garlic powder, mushrooms and Italian seasoning. It tasted blank otherwise. I also used only one can of the soup since I dont like my peppers watered down but more crunchy. I didn't have cheddar cheese so I improvised with Romano cheese instead. The stuffing tasted delicious. I actually have grown to hate peppers so I didnt try that part but my husband who use to hate peppers loved it!

We really liked this. I used a combination of red and yellow peppers because that's what I had.  My filling filled 3 peppers to the brim and I only threw out a few tbsp of filling but the peppers were the big ones from Costco. I used 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 spicy Italian sausage (again, that's what I had).  I also used tomato sauce instead of tomato soup.  I had to cook the rice for 5 min longer, so 20 min. I saved a bit of the cheese and after the 25 min in the oven, I topped the peppers with cheese and broiled the cheese on the peppers until it bubbled.  While the peppers were baking, I made pasta.   I took the peppers out of the sauce after broiling and mixed the pasta in the sauce.  my 1 year old liked this too.

We used elk meat instead of ground beef so a little leaner and more flavorful I suppose? Everything else we kept the same only used 3 large peppers & only needed one can of tomato soup and I chopped up the tops of the peppers and added back to the browning meat and onions. Overall a huge success. My husband is now a fan of peppers where as before he said they were just blaaah. Eat your heart out, Stouffers :-)

I wish I had read the reviews prior to making these.  I did find the mix to be rather bland the way the recipe is. I aso found the rice wasn't cooked all the way after it simmered in the mix. The peppers were boiled whole with the tops cut off for 8+ minutes,  but they still came out crunchy even after the baking. 
Next time I will use the suggestions given as this seems to be a base recipe that DEFINITELY neesds tweaking.

This was a great recipe! I added garlic, oregano, basil, thyme, cumin, cayenne, and pepper to the beef/onion mixture. And used beef broth instead of water. I only used 1/4 cup of rice instead of a half. I think that lowering the rice made it more "juicy" and flavorful- not dry. I put cheese on the bottom of the bell peppers, then added beef mixture and topped with cheese.  Poured some roasted pepper tomato soup on top. Then served with a spinach strawberry honey balsamic salad. It was amazing!

Loved this recipe.  My husband gave it an "A".  Only made some minor changes.  I used ground venison.  Left out the Worcestershire, used Italian flavored diced tomatoes instead of whole, added a tablespoon of tomato sauce after putting half of the filling and then another tablespoon on top when filled as someone else had suggested.  I used an 8 oz. can of sauce and added the small amount left to the one can of soup with some water (there was plenty of liquid).  I served with mashed potatoes and put the sauce over them.  I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was absolutely delicious.  I used 2 lbs of beef, and increased the rice and water just slightly.  It was fantastic. My family loved it.  I reheated 1/2 of a pepper for lunch today, and since I had so much of the filling left, I ate some with Tostitos, and it was absolutely delicious.

I enjoyed this dish but made several changes based on the reviews. I added fresh garlic and Italian seasoning to add more flavor to the meat mixture. I also cut the peppers lengthwise instead of cutting the tops off since that seems wasteful. Since we're trying to be healthy I used brown rice (success boil in the bag bout of the bag added to beef mixture) and ground turkey. I used onion powder instead of onions because my hubby doesn't care for onion too much but I like the flavor. I didn't use tomato soup, too much sodium (hubby has high blood pressure) and used tomato paste diluted with water and seasoned with Mrs. Dash, pepper and onion powder. I added Rotel with diced chilies and a can of diced tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes chopped up. (I'm efficient not lazy) ?? I also layered the ingredients in the peppers as another reviewer suggested in the following order, sauce, meat mixture, cheese. Turned out great and I will make it again. The next time I plan to add sausage for more zip!

I have made these about 4 times now and each time I don't change a thing.  They are delicious.  They are even better the next day so make extra.  My entire family loves them.  As far as people changing 4-5 ingredients and then rating why not try the actual recipe and then rate it and tweak it they way you like.  Honestly if you stick exactly to this recipe you won't be disappointed. Thanks for sharing.

Good overall. I split the peppers in half lengthwise--easier to get the ribs and seeds out. I used a can of diced tomatoes, incl. the liquid. I doubled the Worcestershire sauce and added some Italian seasoning--might have been a bit bland without it. For the sauce, I used a 32-oz. carton of Imagine tomato soup. I didn't cover the dish in the oven, but I think it turned out better that way--some of the liquid in the soup evaporated, making it thicker.

This recipe turned out great! I added 2 garlic cloves, 1 jalepeno diced, and crushed red pepper.. It emphasized the beef with a bit of a kick and better flavor! It's a keeper for sure!

So moist and flavourful!  I put a little tomato soup in the bottom of each pepper with a sprinkling of cheese, then stuffed the pepper.  I topped mine with some more tomato soup and seasoned bread crumbs. Soooooo good!

best stuffed peppers I have ever had.  My wife had never made stuffed peppers before she made these, and they were delicious.  She made some minor changes, added a little more spices, especially garlic.  She is now addicted.

I'm only giving this recipe 4 stars because of the headache it caused from using the uncooked rice as directed. To save yourself the hassle of having hard, undercooked rice, COOK THE RICE AHEAD of time then add it to the mixture!  Aside from the rice fiasco the recipe IS good.  I followed others recommendations of  sautéing a Tablespoon or more of minced garlic with the meat, using diced tomatoes,  doubling the Worcheser sauce, using beef broth instead of the 1/2 cup of water and adding some Italian seasoning. I also chopped up a whole bag of baby spinach and added it with the mixture for extra flavor, texture, color and nutrients. This is a good base recipe but I think it would come out rather bland if you don't add your own extra seasonings to it.

Outstanding!  Added 2 t. Worcestershire and 1/2 cup beef bouillon to meat mixture.   Also added 1/4 t. each of oregano and basil. I also cooked my rice before adding to HB mixture.  Heated tomato soup with 1/2 cup water and added approx. 1/2 soup to HB mixture before filling. Partially cooked peppers in microwave before filling.  Topped with remaining soup.  Cooked covered for 45 minutes.  Removed and sprinkled with cheese.  Will definitely make again!  Cskitchen

I don't cook the peppers as long as the recipe calls for.  You can also use red, yellow or orange peppers which my family likes as they don't talk back near as much,  I also added a bay leaf to my tomato mixture, which used tomato sauce instead of soup!  Also a dash of garlic and even a hint of sage.  I have made these using ground pork too and it's very tasty.  I'm going to try half beef and half pork the next time

I love this recipe just the way it is. This is the only way I make my peppers now. Sometimes I use red and yellow peppers. The only thing different is I put more cheese in mine cause I love cheese.

I followed this pretty closely, and they turned out great. They will be in the use-up-summer-garden menu from now on. Only changes: fresh garden tomatoes instead of canned, used fewer peppers because my garden peppers are huge this year so I cut them in half lengthwise to have more filling-to-pepper ratio, and only used one can tomato soup to top (I think two would have been overkill).

Lovely recipe, thanks!  I tweaked it a bit … not keen on green peppers so I used orange and yellow instead and I didn't boil the peppers (totally skipped the first step) since they will be baked and prefer a crisp texture when plated.  I also 'kicked it up a notch' because of the comments re: flavour.  I added a dash of Frank's Hot Sauce after frying the beef and onions, 1 clove of diced garlic and taco & cajun seasoning on top of the cheese.  I added a can of 'fire roasted' diced tomatoes and used cheese in the mixture, as noted in the recipe, but I also added more old cheddar cheese on top of the tomato sauce.  I used 4 peppers and approx. 3/4 cup hamburger, 1/2 onion and 1/2 cup uncooked rice which cooked nicely while simmering in the pan.  I baked then broiled the stuffed peppers.  We really enjoyed this dish!

Easy to make. Delicious. Few substitutes. Chicken instead of beef. Couscous instead of rice. Salsa instead of tomato soup.  Shredded parmesan instead of cheddar. Also, up the worchestershire (sp?). I used the whole sliced top as a base to keep the peppers from toppling over.

Great.  Followed suggestions and used chopped tomatoes with garlic and basil; added basil, oregano and italian season.  Made the tomato sauce with 1 can of soup and 1/2 can of water and just poured into the mixture before putting in peppers.  Will make again!

I have made stuffed peppers for years, but this is the best!  I did add a little garlic.  I don't care for tomato soup so I use 1 small can of tomato sauce.  I thought it needed a little more cheese.  I also had meat loaf mix in the freezer so used that rather than just hamburger meat, don't know if that made a big difference..  How great it was that they changed the ingredients for just 2 peppers.

I liked these, but I'm not sure I'll make it again. I agree with the previous reviewers that the dish lacked a little something. If I do try this recipe again I will definitely add a little hot sauce or something to add some more complexity to the dish.

Definately a hit in my household. I did take some shortcuts to ensure speed. I cooked the rice separately and then just incorporated into the cooked seasoned meat when it was done. Also, instead of a tomato soup, I just used a medium can of tomato sauce - I find that it doesn't have as much seasonings so you better control of your flavors. The best part is that kids love the insides. So when one requested just the inside and not the pepper, I just put some to the side and it makes a good meal all on it's own.

Loved this.  I changed it up just a bit for flavor preferences. I used a 14.5 oz can of tomato sauce instead of the soup, and I added Italian seasoning to it.  I used diced organic tomatoes instead of the whole peeled tomatoes, and I included the liquid.  I used less cheese only because I don't recall my mom using cheese in her peppers when I was a kid and I didn't know how it would taste.  I think the cheese doesn't add a whole lot of flavor but it helps everything stick together.  I added two cloves of minced garlic to the beef and onions for more flavor. It was quite good and made great lunch leftovers!

I didn't like the tomato soup on top. Next time I'll use pasta sauce from a jar instead. I'll make extra rice on the side too because there wasn't enough rice in the mix itself.

Really needs more spice. Maybe put tomatoes with green chilies instead of tomato soup... Really, the tomato soup ruins it.

This was delicious! I halved the recipe and used turkey instead of beef and reduced fat cheddar cheese instead of regular cheddar for a slightly healthier version and it turned out great.

Tried this recipe tonight for me and the girlfriend. I changed a little bit on it and turned out awesome. Used 4 large peppers instead of 6, a cup and a half of rice instead of half a cup, used a half a can of tomato sauce instead of tomatoes and tomato soup, I also topped the peppers off with cheese before putting them in the oven. Delicious and girlfriend definitely wants me to make them again!

This recipe was so good and easy to make.  I added 3 cloves of garlic, fresh basil, corn, cilantro, lime juice, and vegetarian crumbles instead of ground beef.  I also used a can of crushed tomatoes with lime and chile peppers.  I used traditional spaghetti sauce instead of tomato soup. I also used steam in a bag brown rice, sautéed the onion, garlic, finely chopped carrots, and mixed all together with the crumbles for the stuffing. I layered cheese, then the stuffed ingredients, then sauce, in the peppers, then topped with Parmesan cheese. So good, with a kick of spice!

This was (unbelievably) my first time making stuffed peppers.   I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  The peppers were perfectly cooked and seasoned.   The filling was absolutely delicious - my husband and teenagers loved it.   THE ONLY THING we did NOT like was the tomato soup gravy!  It really took the meal down a whole notch.  The peppers were swimming in tomato soup.   I think next time I would make my own tomato puree to put on top, with more seasoning.

We love this recipe and make it at least once a month. The only changes I make now is to use the rice cooker for the rice because I'm notorious for under cooking the rice, which is no fault of the recipe. Other than that I made it just as written. The other change is that I use three large green peppers instead of six since there are only three of us. Makes an entire meal!

I modified this recipe to my family's liking, but since it's so similar, I gave it a five star review. First, I cut the tops off five green peppers, and cleaned them out. I cooked up a 1/2 cup instant rice. In another pan,heated a can of tomato soup with water. Next, I took 1 1b hamburg meat, diced onion, not measuring, just adding enough to my liking. I also added black pepper, and garlic powder. Next, I added the rice, and mixed together. Then I stuffed all the peppers, put them in a casserole dish, and poured the tomato soup over them. I bake at 350 degrees, for 1 hour. I just put them together, and they are in the oven for tonight's supper. We'll have it with rye bread and a salad. This is a family favorite, one I learned from my Mother.

I have made this three times in the last month.  I even made the last batch with Morning Star Farms Beef Crumbles for my vegetarian wife.  It is awesome either way.  I do use a homemade barbque sauce instead of the tomato soup.  I think it makes it pop.  I also use two table spoons of Worcester Sauce.

This was really tasty and easy for stuffed peppers. I browned the onion with the hamburger meat and added garlic. I used a cup of beef broth instead of 1/2 cup of water and doubled the Worcestershire. I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned tomatoes; tomato sauce instead of tomato soup and used mozzarella since I was out of cheddar. I will certainly be making this again, with my changes.

Where have you been all my life? This was killer amazing. I used red peppers instead of green because they just taste better. Obviously you need to season the filling to taste... I used garlic salt, pepper, more Worcester sauce and more cheese. I added alittle diced peppers. I cut the peppers lengthwise instead of chopping of the top. Then you get more, smaller portions. I only needed one can of tomato soup, but it was a perfect complement! Perfect winter comfort food!

I was surprised on how good this was. I did change a couple things. Less peppers as i was certain 6 would not fill up as big as mine were. I used ground pork that was super lean instead of beef.  I cut up the top of the pepper and sauteed it with the onions. I also had 2 cups of cheese so mixed one cup in with the meat and one cup on top. You don't need two cans of soup either its way overkill. Great taste, will make again!

Great base, but ADD SOME SPICE! Italian, oregano, fresh basil and a dash of cumin topped it off. (I don't really measure spices. :) I skipped the tomato soup and topped with cheese.

This is a pretty good recipe, but it is very bland as written; it tasted like a meatloaf wrapped in cellulose. It's more like a recipe foundation for tweaking. The soup added a sweetness that I found distasteful, so I'll probably use a pasta sauce next time. Look at the other reviews for suggestions on seasoning. Oh, and don't go with large peppers; mine were about 5" after I cut the tops off, and the filling barely got all 6 half-full.

Great! Made a couple changes as suggested. Sliced peppers in half, added oregano, thyme, basil, garlic, black pepper & whole onion to beef while cooking.  Used 3/4 c instant brown rice, 3/4 cup water. Prefer peppers cooked 5 min so they are softer/soggy. Kids seem to prefer them that way as well.  Will make again.

Tried this today.  Used both red and green peppers.  Each was good.  I felt my peppers were too soft, so next time I will only cook them from 3 to 4 minutes.

I agree with some of the recommended changes.  My family and friends also prefer the red, orange or yellow peppers over the green peppers.  I find frying the onions first works better for me in most recipes.  I placed the peppers in the microwave to soften them, but boiling them also works well.  I used 500 g beef and 250 g pork, also spicy tomatoe  sauce rather than tomatoe soup.  I used a bag of shredded white cheeses and added them to the bottom of each half pepper first than added a bit more on the top of each pepper.  This recipe is a keeper for me.

I changed it a bit  - I used yellow, red, and orange  peppers .  I browned the meat first, then I browned the onions, and cooked the rice before adding to the ground beef.  I added some Cumin, garlic, and onion powder.  The guys loved it so I guess it turned out great!

The only change I made was to substitute tomato sauce mixed with a tad of V8 for the recommended tomato soup. We've had this several times now and it's delicious!

I don't know if I just had the biggest peppers ever or the ones this recipe was made with were small or a combination of both, but I came up extremely short with the ground beef blend: I had to cut off the top half of all my peppers and they still weren't full! Kind of disappointing, but I'll adjust next time. That being said, the recipe itself was pretty delicious, along with the adjustments others had made (garlic, beef bouillon, and precooking the rice). I also added a bit more Worcestershire sauce, because I can never get enough of it!

I did it a little different for down here in Sao Paulo Brasil.  Basic above plus added (for quantity as above) 2 long thin red hot peppers without seeds and very finely chopped and chopped up the bell pepper tops (without stem of course) and cooked it in the meat along with a cup of spicy round peppers (do not have in states).  At the very end after added cheese, I added a little more than a cup of sliced mushrooms. Rest was exactly the same, and I loved this recipe also.

I've made this recipe a few times and we love it. I usually use ground turkey instead of ground beef. I also add a little more seasoning to the meat & rice mixture, like garlic and italian seasonings, and I also double the worcestershire sauce because we like it. I also use tomato sauce in place of the tomato soup and put a spoonful inside the peppers before filling them, so the sauce is throughout the filling when you eat it. Tonight when I made them, I had the meat already cooking when I realized I was out of rice, so I used orzo instead and doubled the amount of water, then still let it simmer 15 or until the orzo was tender. It still turned out great!

Instead of 1 lb ground beef, I use 1/5 lb lean ground beef and 1/5 lb hot Italian sausage. This gives it an additional level of flavor combinations. I do not use tomato soup and instead just use 1 can of whole peeled tomatoes and chop them on a cutting board and use the juice from the tomatoes as the "sauce" to cook down the rice.

Not bad when you you feel like stuffed Peppers. Its a good solid recipe although I never find much of a variation in taste when it comes to stuffed pepper recipes.  When you want stuffed peppers tis one will do it.

This is a great recipe! The only thing I did different from the recipe is that I precooked my rice a little bit in the microwave then added it to the skillet of hamburger, onions, and tomatoes to ensure that the rice would be tender.  I love that the recipe says to boil the peppers first.  This makes them nice and tender when they come out of the oven.  Great tasting, easy to make, and my family loves it!

I adjusted this primarily because I did not have the exact ingrediants on hand. 1)  I did not boil the peppers before hand, and thus, they baked to the green pepper version of "al dente," which is fine, because I dislike the mushy quality of most stuffed peppers. 2} Filling: browned a pound of ground turkey, then added two fresh tomatoes, salt, peper, smoked paprika to taste, and 1/4 cup of rhubarb ketchup (the recipe is on all recipes, look 'er up!) and enough water to let the tomatoes cook down into a sauce, cooked it off. Used pree-cooked rice, added after the sauce was finished.Topped with colby cheese. 3} Substituted about 2.5 cups of spaghetti sauce andf thinned with a little more water to gravy consistency for baking. Because I changed the recipe so much, I only gave this one a 4-star rating as I didn't find out what the actual recipe was like. However, as a guide for getting good stuffed peppers with what you have on hand, this recipe was perfect. I never made stuffed peppers before and these came out great, thanks to the guidance in this recipe.

This is a great recipe.  I've had to make a few adjustments to easily scale it to 2 people: 2 peppers, 1 can tomato soup, 200g ground meat, 1 small chopped red onion, 2tbsp rice, 2 tbsp water, 1/4 cup cheese, and a few squirts worchester sauce.  Salt and pepper to taste.  Followed all the directions as-is, except I just add the whole can of tomato soup to the meat/rice, and don't worry about pouring it over the top.

This was the 1st time I've tried to make stuffed peppers. Prep time was a little longer than I would have liked, But the peppers came out really good! I am a vegetarian, so I used the fake "ground crumbles" and no Worchestershire sauce, but the filling was still very tasty! Only thing I would have liked was a little more heat/spice. It seemed to need something else. I will make these again for sure, only play around a bit and find something to add a little kick.

I saved this recipe because of the base ingredients! It really makes for a delicious stuffed green pepper. 

However, I cook the rice separately, then mix it with the tomatoes, meat and spice. This is because of past experiences where the rice just does not get cooked enough otherwise...

I rinse off the ground beef after cooking and before mixing to get rid of excess fat! (You can make 80% lean into 90%+ lean this way.) 

I use about 3/4 of the cheese in the mix, and add the rest on top at the end of cooking. 

Yum yum yum yum!!

Very good, except I don't like cheddar cheese melted over my food in most cases.  I substituted moistened TVP instead of the rice, and it came out fine.  I will make this again.

Absolutely delicious!  I added a diced green pepper to my mixture at the same time as the onion and used diced tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes.

Oh My - these were so good.  My husband says this is a "keeper" recipe.
My changes were:  used ground turkey instead of beef, added garlic cloves - minced, used roasted diced tomatoes; precooked the rice, added at end and omitted the water to compensate.  I also, tripled the Worsteshire.  Added cheese to bottom of pepper and covered peppers with more cheese for the last 5 minutes of cooking time.  
Will definitely make these again!

I used a pound of Chipotle pork sausage instead of beef and a creamy "ready to eat" gourmet tomato soup instead of conensed.  I also added way more cheese.  REALLY good and very easy!

Really Good recipe!! I had a little hickup though. I would not recommend cooking the rice with the meat. I read other reviews saying this, but figured i would be a rebel and try it out. Fail! I also used brown rice, so this problably contributed to the length of time it took to get  tender, but next time i will play it safe and cook the rice (white or brown) separately. I had to cook the meat/rice combo for about 30/35 min, adding more water mix w/tomato soup a couple times. Even then, my rice was not completely cooked, but i went ahead and  stuffed my peppers and stuck 'em in the oven.

Despite adding garlic, oregano, basil, mushrooms and celery salt the stuffing didn't have much flavor.  Next time I will add even more garlic and some more spices.  In addition, I added milk to the tomato soup to give it a more creamier sauce which was very delicious.

Yum! I've tried several stuffed pepper recipes and this is the keeper. I cut the peppers in half to make them easier to stuff and balance in the baking pan, and I added a little cheese on top but otherwise I followed the recipe. Next time I think I'd only use one can of tomato soup but I wouldn't change anything else. I'll hang on to this one!

I never liked my mothers peppers with tomato paste...so I stuff peppers-( green and red ) with  browned ground beef, salt, pepper and garlic,  add sauted mushrooms-chopped ( and one whole mushroom poked down into top of pepper) add  par-boiled rice, add a little cream of mushroom soup to hamburger mix and stuff peppers -(which have been boiled,
 drained and rinsed with cold water to stop cooking,  Lightly stuff peppers with meat mixture,  poke a chunk  of swiss cheese into middle and add a  mushroom and a slice  of swiss cheese to top of pepper).  tastes real good.  oh, and pour the rest of soup over peppers and bake in a dutch oven with lid. Note: always boil pepper first-drain,rinse with cold water, and partially cooked rice (instant rice gets too mushy)

I used venison with this. turned out good but needed more seasoning. 

i cut mine lengthwise, used diced tomatoes, chicken broth instead of water, more cheese and only one can of tomato soup, doubled the worch, added italian seasonings and garlic. next time i would add more salt and seasnings, but it was good.

This is the best stuffed pepper recipe I've ever tried.  Before stuffing the peppers, I mixed about 3/4 cup of tomato sauce in with the beef mixture and used the rest to top.   I also add more ingredients to the beef mix to make 1.5 or sometimes double ingredients depending on the pepper size, as the original recipe didn't quite fill the peppers I use.   Wonderful recipe - thanks for sharing!

LOVED... LOVED... LOVED THIS! I have never made stuffed peppers that tasted so well. However instead of stuffing the peppers I cut it up and sauteed them and made a casserole. I also used garlic tomatoes gave it a nice flavor.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe.  I really don't alter it much at all.  I use brown rice instead of white and will use half ground round and half ground turkey. It tastes so good!  Also, I like to add a can of corn for some sweetness!! And, of course you can never have enough shredded cheese!!  Definitely an A+ recipe!

Yummy!  Made these in a cinch.  Didn't have any cheese, but they were still tasty.  If I had the time I would have roasted the peppers first for a deeper flavor vs boiling.

My husband and I thought these were really good and would definitely make them again. I followed the recipe, except I only made four peppers and used a little more cheese. Very yummy.

Made it exactly like recipe and it was good. I do like boiling the peppers first, that's a great idea. Next time I think I will add more seasoning to the meat.. Maybe some onion soup mix, too.

I followed this recipe exactly (using ground venison).  I took it to a group dinner and everyone there raved.  They really were delicious and reminded me of my grandmother's recipe (she also used tomato soup).

These are ok.  I have made them twice.  The first time I follwed the recipe exactly and my husband loved them with the exception of the worcestershire sauce(He doens't like that stuff).  He prefered the inside because it was a little drier.  The next time I only used one can of soup and mixed some of it in with the meat.  I also added some seasoning because I thought the first time was a little bland.  So it definitely would be if I left out the Worcestershire sauce.  Everyone liked it....my kids loved it much more the second time....as did I.  My husband liked the taste better, but still prefered it drier like the first time.  So I guess it is all a matter of opinion.  Oh, you do only need one can of soup...2 is definitely too much.  If you don't mind the peeling, buy diced tomatoes.  I add a lot more cheese, because everybody loves more cheese.

LOVE this recipe.  It's really one of my favorite meals ever.  I've made it twice now, both times using a meat substitute like Tempeh or Veggie Crumble, and it has turned out amazingly!  It's full of flavor and a stand alone meal that's easy to put together.  Also, I serve it with a dollop of sour cream on top.  Highly recommend as a vegetarian option!

Very good basic recipe but I changed it a little to suit our family's likes. I used pork sausage and ground beef, doubled the Worcestershire sauce, used a can of crushed tomatoes, added garlic, used tomato sauce instead of soup, added corn and doubled the rice and water.

This did not work out well for me.  The rice didn't get tender and the mixture itself was too moist.  I added tomato sauce and Italian seasoning to the tomato soup, which helped but could have used some more tweaking.

Delicious! :) I use tomato sauce in place of the soup and I only use one 10.75 oz can and then one of the smaller cans because I had a lot left over in the pan the first time I made it.
Everyone loves this recipe!

1st time making stuffed green pepper. Had too many peppers from my garden. I am making them and freezing for a ready dinner one night.  For the filling I added garlic and 2 beef boulion cubes. It tastes wonderful! They won't sit in the freezer very long!  Thanks

Excellent recipe. I will def be making these again. I didn't alter the recipe much. I like my peppers a little on the sweet side so I threw a tbsp or so of sugar into the boiling water with my peppers. I used ground turkey 97% lean (to make it a little more diet friendly).  I also didn't follow the boiling time of the peppers.  Everyone's peppers aren't going to be created equal. Pepper thickness will vary and therefore the time it takes to get them slightly tender will also vary. I cooked the peppers until they were able to be pierced fairly easily with a fork. Keep in mind when testing your peppers that they will be also cooking in the oven for 35 minutes so don't overcook them when boiling. Other than the above, no changes were made and the end result was DELICIOUS! The only reason my family of three (myself included) had one pepper leftover was because we were STUFFED.  : )  But I had that leftover pepper for lunch today and it was still amazing.

i made the following changes with outstanding success:  used a 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes and used half in the meat mixture and the remaining half mixed in with the soups; instead of water, i substituted half can undiluted of campbell's beef consummee and eliminated the worcesshire sauce.  The remaining half i poured into the soup, diced tomato mixture.  Also used instant brown rice.  The best stuffed peppers i have ever, ever had!!!

Needed a little more seasoning, but this was pretty good.  I made it with ground turkey, instead of beef, but otherwise kept to the recipe.

This was so good.  My rice took a little longer to cook than the recommended 15 minutes....and I let my peppers boils longer (because I like them that way)...The addition of cheese really topped the whole recipe off!  Thanks so much for sharing!  PS 1 lb of ground beef didn't seem enough for my 6 red peppers but it was, indeed, plenty!

Very good. Even my 2 and 3 year old ate it. Took some other suggestions and it came out great. Doubled the worcestershire sauce, added minced garlic to the beef, and layer the peppers with cheese, beef mix and soup twice. Yum! Oh and you can be liberal with the salt and pepper.

These were delicious and my husband raved about them however, I did make a few changes with the recommendation of other reviews.  I used tomato sauce instead of soup and while stuffing the peppers, I layered in a little extra tomato sauce and topped it off with cheese.  Yummy!  My kids weren't too thrilled with the pepper part but loved the insides!  I served it with corn and steamed red potatoes.

Double the rice, onion and worcestershire sauce.
Add garlic, black pepper, basil and oregano.
Halve the condensed tomato soup; mix part into stuffing mixture, pour remainder on top.

I might also recommend reducing the total amount of stuffing or doing an extra 2-3 peppers (especially if adding extra rice), as peppers were, in my opinion, overstuffed (even with stock recipe).

A favorite but I had ground turkey and add peas. Substituted brown rice for white rice just for the heck of it.

loved it, but I had a lot of extra stuffing left over. I cut the peppers in half and filled since we have littles at the house that couldn't eat a whole pepper, could this be the reason for extra? But since the kids loved the stuffing inside, the next night I used it over noodles for them.

this was a good simple recipe I had never made green peppers before and this was a good starting point.  Instead of rice I use a half of cauliflower, that I had placed in the food process with the onion and the tops of the green peppers. I added this, mixture to the ground meat and brown together. Also added a can of corn drained, to the remaining ingredients then placed in crock pot on high for 4 hours.  very good

I've been making Stuffed Green Peppers for a long time but wanted to try this recipe because it had so many reviews. I don't believe that this is one of those recipes you can really mess up so I used the ingredients as suggested (with a few minor changes) and cooked the peppers in a crockpot. This is the way I've always cooked them and they always turn out great. (The peppers however are probably much softer than by baking them a shorter period of time) I put all the ingredients (raw) in a bowl and mixed together. I did add garlic, more worcestershire and corn. I limited the salt because the cheese adds plenty. I drained the tomato juice in with the tomato soup instead of using water then mixed the tomatoes in with meat mixture. I also used ground sirloin so that the peppers would not fill up with grease on top as I did not cook meat before stuffing peppers. It's done about 4-5 hours. Quite honestly I've never prepared peppers in the oven before but maybe next time I will try it just to compare.

We loved this! Did alter a little. Instead of boiling peppers, I cut length wise and cleaned and then microwaved on high for 4 mins. I added garlic to meat and onions. I also used a rice pilaf mix packet that had seasoning in it. Very good. Will definitely make again!

My husband and I did not like these at all.  The filling was incredibly bland, and tasted way too much like condensed tomato soup. Neither of us finished our plates.  I will not be making these again.

Recipe has great potential, but few things I had to adjust. First, boiling the peppers for 5-10 minutes was not enough to soften them so they only needed to bake for 25-30 minutes. I would recommend boiling them for at least 15-20 minutes. When i did bake them, I heated the oven to 375 and cooked for a good 45 minutes until they were tender. Other than that recipe was great!

I love this recipe and so does my husband.  I thought I didn't like stuffed peppers till now!  We will get craving it and my husband will bring home a bag of green pepper as a hint.  I didn't change a thing, except to double the recipe.  I forgot the worcestershire once and there was a tiny bit of something missing in the taste.  So don't forget that!

For a Low Carb version of this recipe, I omitted the rice and added shredded cabbage. I used 1 cup of shredded cabbage for each cup of cooked rice omitted. Simply saute shredded cabbage into the meat mixture before filling peppers. Makes this enjoyable for people who are on no carb/low carb diets. Cabbage has approx. 5 grams of carbs per 1 cup, shredded. Enjoy!

Loved it!!! Only thing I did differently......cooked the rice in a rice cooker, then add all the ingredients and cooked on low flame till the everything was warmed through. And since my kids are picky eaters, two of them do not like bell peppers, I put some of the mixture to the side and just served it up to them in a bowl! They loved it!!

Very Yummy!  I added everything together in the pan so it was all warm when I stuffed the peppers.  I still cooked them in the oven for 25 minutes or so to continue cooking the peppers.  My boyfriend loved them! 

Oh and I also used the Uncle Ben's rice that you pop in the microwave for 90 seconds and it is done...worked great!!!

This recipe is great...my husband loved them!  I added some cayenne pepper, used Jasmin rice and beef broth instead of water.  I aslo sprinkled greated parmesan cheese with the cheddar and then topped with the sauce.  This is the recipe that I will keep using!

My husband and I enjoyed these; I made ones for the kids (4, 1) out of the peppers in ramekins, which they also enjoyed. I took the advice of other reviewers; added some additional garlic and Italian seasoning to the hamburger while cooking, and for the stuffing process, I sprinkled some cheese in the bottom of the peppers, followed by layers of hamburger, gravy, hamburger, gravy, then topped it off with cheese. I used both red and green peppers; we enjoyed both equally. The only thing I didn't love; peppers are $1.99 each at the store right now, making this a pricey dish.

This recipe is a winner!  I sauteed the onions first, then added the meat.  I used diced tomatoes (not drained) and beef broth instead of water.  I added extra cheese on top for the last 5 minutes of baking time.  The peppers were a little crispier than I would have liked, but hubby thought they were great.

This was delicious--after a few minor adjustments. I doubled the Worchestershire sauce as advised, used tomato sauce instead of water when simmering the ingredients together, and added half a can of corn and half a can of kidney beans. This added a little more flavor, color, and protein. I also put a little bit of cheddar cheese in the bottom of the peppers. I think the tomato sauce made the biggest difference though. Yum!

Excellent recipe with a few tweaks.  I boiled the peppers for 10 minutes so they would be more tender as suggested by other reviewers.  Also added fresh garlic and cooked the rice prior to adding to the meat mixture. I used ground beef, pork and veal mix instead of just plain ground beef and used shredded mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar cheese.  My family loved these and cleaned their plates, including my 13 yr old daughter who doesn't really like meat.

Love it.  It's as easy as stuffed anything gets, not a picky recipe (if I don't measure it still always turns out), and tastey. I sometimes use ground turkey or chicken and might add more rice and less tomato soup -- brought it to lunch to eat with coworkers twice and it's always a hit.

Really good. Had to add a little seasoning and salt because it was a little bland as the recipe calls. But otherwise pretty darn good.

Delicious!  I changed a few things up to make it a little healthier, like some fat free cheese and ground sirloin.  Also, I would boil the peppers longer if you prefer less crunch.  Mine were fine, but I'd probably prefer them a little softer.  I'm guessing as leftovers, they will soften up a bit that way as well.

this was great! I added Mushrooms and Parmesan cheese to the meat mixture. I used a can of tomato sauce instead of the tomatoes and soup. I used tex mex cheese instead of the cheddar. In my house with 3 children under the age of 12, this got 4/5! not so bad!!!

I used this recipe as directed and some of the others advice like layer cheese and meat which gave meat more flavor and used can diced habanero tomatos and tomato paste on top not soup . I also cooked rice seperate. My husband loved it. He also ate it for breakfast and said ," its delicious ,but needs more habanero." It was spicy to me! love it 5 star

These were delicious!  Perfect for leftovers too!  I mixed the tomato soup in with the beef/rice mixture so there was not a "sauce" to mess with.

I think this receipe is wonderful.  I customized it by adding garlic, onions, & fresh baby spinach to the meat.  Cut the can of tomatoes in half but add all the liquid.  one whole can is too much tomato for me.  I used the adobo fire roasted diced tomatoes.  I used wild mushroom & herb couscous instead of rice and it was fabulous!  I'm so proud of myself...  My grocer premixes a turkey loaf and that is what I'm going to use next time with parmesan couscous.

I took some of the advice I saw in the comments and added some of the tomato "gravy" inbetween layers of the filling.  I also added about 1/2 a can of corn in the mix as well.  Added some extra cheese on top (can never have enough cheese in my opinion).

This recipe is a good base. However, to make it work, I had to modify it cosiderably. I cut the bell peppers lengthwise. Used only one can of tomato soup. Cooked the rice seperately as well as the meat. Added some minced garlic, cumin, chili powder, and oregano; and omitted the worsteshire sauce and 1/2 cup water (I just added a full soup can's worth instead). I mixed the soup into the stuffing, instead of pouring it over the peppers. It came out wonderful.

I made some modifications as well. Instead of waiting to pour tomato sauce over the peppers, I actually mixed it with the beef and rice and let it on low heat for 3-5 min. I felt that in that way the beef would soak in sauce much better. I also used some spinach and minced garlic in the mix and replaced Cheddar with crumbled feta.

THE best stuffed pepper recipe I've ever tried! The tomato soup gives it a fabulous flavor....It's just ...Perfect!:) Thanks for sharing. PS...I would definitely make more of the stuffing than the recipe calls for...There was hardly enough meat for the six peppers.

I made this recipe earlier this week and my husband loved it - me too.  When cutting the tops off the peppers I thought about what to do with them, half I blanched and froze for future use, the others I chopped up and saute with the onions.  Instead of tomato soup, I used garden cocktail as the sauce, yummy.

This is the most tasty stuffed pepper recipe I've ever eaten!  It's just fabulous!  Not too tomatoey like some that I've made.  Of course, you have to add your favorite seansonings to bring out the flavors.  I used garlic, Lawry's Season Salt and ground black pepper.  I give this TEN stars, folks!

4 stars because this appears bland as written. A quick & neat idea: If you have leftovers from a mexican meal, i.e. spanish rice, fresh salsa, etc. use it up mixed w/grn beef & some crumbled Queso cheese and a spoon of sour cream mixed together before stuffing. I had fresh cilantro I needed to use up as well in this. I like the par cooking of green peppers 1st so they are a bit softer and more mellow. Try red peppers which are a bit sweeter and no need to precook those. Since I was only making two peppers I put them in a pyrex meatloaf type dish where I added 1/2 C chicken stock with 2 tblsp ketchup to the bottom. I baked mine covered w/foil for 30 minutes and then topped with shredded cheese and baked uncovered until cheese melted. More of a Mexican flavor but great way to use up some leftover ingredients from a different meal and can be quickly thrown together.

This is a great recipe following others advice to simplify process and season up to our taste this is a 5 star plus recipe.  Changes made: (1) preheat oven and bake peppers while preparing next steps if you like soft bell peppers.  I precooked the halves 25-30 minutes and they were soft for my picky husband.  (2)  Browned ground veal (what I had) with onion and 3 garlic cloves while rice cooked on stove.  (3)  combined meat, rice, tomatoes, worcestershire in bowl.  Added generous shakes of "greek seasoning" and oregano (our taste) and crumbled feat to the mix before stuffing prebaked peppers.  Poured 1 can ready-prepared Tomato-Basil soup over peppers and baked at 350 for 30 minutes.  5+ stars with these changes for us.

Tried this last night, everyone loved it. Followed the recipe pretty closely, except used a different style of cheese, and my bf requested I make a couple with poblano peppers instead of bell. Both types were great. Very good! Will definitely make again.

This was the first time I made stuffed peppers.  It was easy and very yummy.  I can't wait to make it again.  I took advice of others and layered the ingredients.  I used sharp cheddar and used campbells tomatoe soup and tomatoe bisque to make it creamy.  YUMMM!

I doubled the rice (to 1 whole cup), used tomato sauce instead of tomato soup, and 1 small can tomatoes and green chilies (Rotel) instead of whole tomatoes due to personal preference. Then instead of baking I layered the stuffed peppers in my crockpot, poured the tomato sauce over them, and cooked on high for about an hour. The green chilies gave it a kick, and the crockpot meant I didn't have to heat up my house with the oven. I served with sour cream to tone it down for my husband, who doesn't like as much spice as I do.

I would only make this if you absolutely love the taste of green peppers!  I substituted the meat for a can of black beans to make it vegetarian.  I thought it was good, but I'm not the biggest fan of green peppers.  Maybe next time I would use a spicy pepper.

This is super easy. A bit time consuming, but yummy! Remember to cut the peppers in 1/2 before you boil them. Use a little more cheese-maybe 1 1/2-2C. And only one can of tomato soup.

As written, ok. A bit bland with condensed soup. I noticed a lot of people using itallian seasoning, so the second time around I skipped the soup and just used spaghetti sauce, stirred in after the rice simmered so I don't have to worry about it being dry in the middle. I also like to use ground turkey. I stir cheese into the mix and put some on top with cooked bacon topping off the cheese. Good stuff

Yummy, I made them using veggie crumbles instead of meat and they came out great. Cooked them in my convection oven on "Speed Cook". I also used yellow and red peppers along with the green to add color.

These are the best stuffed peppers I've ever had.  Personally I'm not much of a meat and canned soup person, but based on the reviews I decided to try it.  The only difference was I added about a tablespoon of basil, oregano and cumin and 1 teaspoon of garlic powder.  The sauce was a tiny bit bland without these.  I was skeptical about the campbell's soup, but the tomato soup tastes excellent on these.  I can't tell that the topping is canned soup!  Will make again, but next time with veggie ground beef.
Update:  These turned out fantastic in the slow cooker.  Once the peppers were stuffed, I sprinkled the leftover meat mixture and extra tomato soup gravy.  I cooked in on low for 6 hours.  It turned out fantastic, and the peppers were beautifully roasted.  I just stuffed the peppers raw, so it eliminated pre-boiling them!

Very good base recipe, but I made a few modifications. I cooked the rice in a separate pot while browning the beef, and added it to the mix once it was done. I used herbed diced tomatoes, and I added the cheese to the tops of the peppers instead of mixing it in with the filling.  My husband, who doesn't usually like green peppers, told me it was really good, and then licked his plate.  The peppers were firm but not undercooked and the filling was flavourful.

Very good but I would prefer tomato sauce in them over the tomato soup. You could definitely taste the soup very strongly. However, this is a great recipe to use and tweak to your own tastes!

Delicious!  I doubled the filling because I had HUGE bell peppers and it worked out great.  I topped with a little more cheese and it was so yummy.  I followed the recipe except for using diced tomatoes.

This doesn't deserve 5 stars as written, but did with my changes based on other reviews. I used 1 Tbsp. worcestershire sauce, and heavily sprinkled Italian seasoning, oregano, and basil on top. Only one can of tomato soup. Also uncoverd and added more shredded cheese for last 10 minutes of bake time. Cooked additional rice to serve with it. Delicious!

Everyone loved these stuffed green peppers...even children who do not normally like green peppers. I used brown rice that I cooked about 75% and then didn't add extra water to the recipe.  Next time I would put shredded cheese on top of the peppers before I bake.  Overall, really good and a great way to use up all of the peppers from the garden.

This was about as good as it gets.  I made some tweaks, though. -2 tsp of minced garlic added with beef/onion to brown -Beef broth used in place of water (I went easy on the added salt because of this) -Arborio (risotto) rice.  A bit thicker than regular white rice, so it took an extra 5 minutes to cook. -Increased Worcestershire to 1 tbps -Added fresh basil and oregano at the same time as Arborio/rice -Sliced peppers length wise, as recommended here -Used Harry's Organic Creamy Tomato Basil Soup in place of condensed cream of tomato soup. (can be bought at Costco) -Kept 1/8 a cup of cheddar for topping right before placing in the oven -Set broiler on high for the last 3-4 minutes to lightly brown.  This recipe will become a staple for us in the future.  Thanks a lot for giving me the building blocks to start with.

These were great!  I used smaller peppers from my garden and was able to fill 12 with the filling after packing it in a bit.  Modifications: added a couple cloves of garlic with the onions, put a little cheese at the bottom of each pepper as well as on top, and only used 1 can of soup for the sauce.  I wrapped these up, including a little sauce on top of each, and froze them after cooking (and cooling!) to have on hand for dinners after my baby was born.  Delish!!

I used the exact amount of rice suggested in this recipe and checked the "doneness" of the rice after the recommended cooking time and the rice was still not cooked--I let it simmer for twice as long and the rice was still hard.  The recipe calls for uncooked rice.The meat mixture and taste was great but my rice was "crunchy" even after cooking on the stovetop AND the oven...

I had an abundance of peppers and tomatoes from my garden & needed to find something to do with them. So I thought of stuffed peppers which I have not had since my grandmother made them 25 years ago. I'm not really a big fan of peppers or tomatoes but gave this a whirl. So Glad I did. OMG. So Good. I did listen to others comments and was sure to boil peppers first. I cooked the rice first in beef broth and set aside. I added 4 big cloves of garlic, paprika, ground pepper and fresh oregano and basil from my garden. Cooked that together with beef. I also put cheddar cheese in the bottom of each pepper. I used my own tomatoes which were boiled, skinned and de-seeded. I also topped them off with mozzerella cheese, only because I ran out of cheddar. I doubled the Worcestershire and only used one can of tomato soup. I also poured some of the sauce in the pepper, then filled them half way, added more sauce. Then I finished topping them, more sauce and cheese on top. My partner saw me putting in tomatoes and had a fit because he hates them. I told him to get out of the kitchen. Well he came back for seconds as did I. Two people that don't care for peppers or tomatoes loved them. So Good. Next time I will add more garlic, salt, pepper and fresh herbs for a bit more flavor.

This was excellent and also a fairly healthy meal. My only change was by mistake but next time making might actually do the same way. I added what i thought was a can of diced tomatoes but ended up being crushed tomatoes. This made the beef/rice mixture a little more soupy (which we liked) and also didn't have the problem with the tomato soup not seeping down to the bottom of the pepper like one reviewer complained because it already had plenty moisture. Because of this i only needed to add one can of tomato soup on top the peppers. I served it over rice. Next time the only thing i may do different is add some garlic like others did.  All in all very good comfort food.

This recipe was amazing! I tried it tonight, and my very picky 12 year old gobbled it up!  I then sat right down and became a Supporting Member of this site! I stuck quite closely to the recipe, but cooked the rice ahead as many suggested and lined the bottom of the peppers with cheese as well. DELICIOUS!  I will definitely try making ahead and freezing as some have suggested.  Sounds like a great idea for a hurried school nite.  Thanks to all!!

I have tried many different stuffed pepper recipes and I found I like this one the best!  I had never cooked the meat first, but when I used this recipe and did exactly as it said, the peppers weren't "mushy" when they were done.  I usually follow the recipe as written, but if I have it, I sometimes add some ground pork or even hot sausage to the hamburg.  I had always used spaghetti sauce and was leary of plain old tomato soup, but it works well.  When peppers are plentiful, I like to make a roaster full and freeze them.  They are wonderful for a day when there is no time to prepare a meal!  Thanks Suzanne!

This is definitely a keeper!  I would've given it 5 stars, but I didn't make it exactly.  I followed the advice of others and used 1 can of tomato soup, which I thought was plenty. 2 cans would've made it much "soupy".  I think the next time I'll cook the peppers 4 minutes, they were ok at 5, but I in my opinion, I think 4 minutes plus the baking time would make them more for my DH and my taste. Thanks for a great recipe!!!

These were SO good!! I made a few substitutions that I was quite happy with.  I used half ground beef/half Italian sausage.  I also added a few diced cloves of garlic as well as diced jalapenos for a touch of heat.  I left out the cheese...it just didn't seem entirely necessary and they turned out amazing.  I can't wait to make these again. I cut the recipe in half, but still used the same amount of rice which I precooked.  PRECOOK THE RICE!!

Excellent.  This is my favorite stuffed pepper recipe.  I used another reviewers suggestion to use goat cheese instead of cheddar - as I don't care for fatty cheddar.  Kids and hubby all liked it.  Hubby actually wanted seconds.  :-)

I received this recipe via email yesterday and made the stuffed peppers last night.  I only made one change and that was to add quinoa instead of rice.  You have to double up the quinoa since it does not take up as much space.  I also cut the bottom of my peppers to make the stand up easier and for the juices to drain.  I felt like 2 cans of tomato soup was too much - I would only use one next time.  This would also make a great stuffing for cabbage rolls.  Great recipe!

This was delicious!  We substituted goat cheese for the cheese, which was fabulous!  Also, the next time I would put some of the tomato soup mixture inside the pepper instead of simply pouring it on top.

Very good! It took my rice more like 25 minutes to cook. Based on previous reviews I got diced tomatoes with garlic and onion and still added the chopped onion as specified. I also doubled the worchestershire, which I should not have done. My family really liked this!

Very good-a little soupy with the tomato soup poured over. I think if I make them again I'll stick with green bell peppers (we used all the other colors) and add the rotel like I've seen suggested here for a little punch.

Great stuffed pepper recipe!  My husband's favorite!  I add more Worcestershire sauce for added taste.  As another person shared, I layered the meat mixture in the pepper and topped with a spoonful of the tomato soup mixture, then topped with more meat.  Makes them very juicy!  Yummy!

I made this recipe tonight.  I gave the recipe 4 stars, but only because I made the following changes to the recipe.  I sautéed the onion, and beef with 1tbsp minced garlic.  I put in ½-cup water, one can tomato soup, 1tbsp beef bouillon, 1-cup rice, 1tbsp Worchester, 1tbsp of pre mixed Italian seasoning and 1 tbsp of basil.  For the diced tomatoes, I used Italian seasoned diced tomatoes.  I then let simmer for about 20 minutes stirring to avoid sticking.    My husband does not like cheese, so I divided the stuffing.  Some I did w/out the cheese, and a couple I did with.  Both tasted very good, and my husband said, “It’s a keeper”.  That is good for me!    Happy cooking!

Huge hit, even my dad who wont eat bell peppers (because they give him heartburn) ate all of his! I did make a lot of changes so I could use up some ingredients we had at home, but it was still delish. I used a large can of whole tomatoes & all of the juice (about double of what the recipe calls for) and substituted raw chicken sausage without the casings (defrosted it and few days ago & needed to use it) for the ground beef. Also, instead of the cheddar I diced up and stirred in three deli slices of provolone, next time I think I might add one more slice.  We will definitely make this again!

I made some changes, I used ground beef and sausage, I also used the creamy tomato soup in the sauce as well as the gravy on top ( Which it needed lots of) I added onion and garlic cooked seperately and rice also cooked alone and tasted the mix before placed inside the peppers. I made adjustments at this point, ( more salt pepper, a touch of red pepper flakes) If the mix tastes good go ahead. This is when I added the Creamy tomato soup. Both to the mix and on top of  the peppers. The important part to this recipe is to only boil the peppers 5 minutes or else it will break apart if overcooked. Also once the cheese is on , undo the foil for     10 minutes prior to eating it. Otherwise this recipe was awesome.

A- This is a great recipe but like others, I had to tweak it to perfection. For one- I didn't use tomato soup. If you use a can of diced tomatoes- the juices in it, along with the chicken broth (which I used as a substitute for water), gave it enough broth. I did use some spaghetti sauce on top of the rice/beef mixture and then topped it off with cheddar cheese (grated). Also, when making the beef/rice mixture, I added oregano, a dash of red chili flakes and quite a bit of salt/pepper to flavour as if you do not, it is very bland and has almost a 'gamey' taste to it. Enjoy and this is one to keep in your recipe box!

I added taco seasoning to the meat and used diced tomatoes with chiles as was recommended by other cooks. The other thing I tried was adding cilantro to the mixture along with pepper jack cheese to give it a more mexican flair. Very good!!

These were delicious.  The only thing I did differently was use red/orange/yellow bells (bf hates green...nut).  I also used pre-diced tomatoes, instead of chopping up whole canned ones.   I was unsure about the tomato soup, but it works.  It didn't seem like soup at all with everything else going on.  Great recipe.  Also, try using canned diced tomatoes w/green chiles for a little extra kick.  Both ways are delish!

I made this recipe for my family because I couldn't find my original recipe.  Well, I'll never need my old recipe again! I only had four peppers so I put the extra stuffing in a separate bowl. My family not only ate their stuffed peppers, but ate the extra stuffing as well. I did not use the canned tomato soup at all and it came out great! I will definitely be making this again!

instead of tomato soup, which has that distinct flavor, I added the juice from the can of tomatoes and it was delicious, I made sure it stayed moist while in the oven to make sure the rice cooked!

I cut the peppers in half lengthwise and filled each half.  I added more Worchestershire sauce than called for, three garlic cloves, and also added one small hot pepper chopped up.  I also put a slice of mozzarella cheese on top of each half and put back into the oven for five minutes to melt the cheese.  Be sure to boil the peppers in hot water for five minutes before you put the stuffing in or they will be to crunchy.  They are even better the next day!!!

These were a big hit!  I absolutely loved the flavor and they were a snap to pull together.  I made 3 minor changes - I added some garlic to the beef and onion, I used a can of crushed tomatoes (I like the texture better than diced tomatoes) and I used a bit of brown sugar in the canned soup topping.  This recipe is deffinately a keeper!

Great recipe - I followed it to a T with the exception of the tomato soup step - I spooned in about 1 tbsp of concentrate from the can into the bottom of each blanched pepper, topped it with 1/2 filling, spooned about another tbsp tomato soup concentrate, filled each pepper to the top with filling, another tbsp soup then the cheese. I didnt want to water down the flavour of the soup, and it was a hit! They freeze amazingly well...and I have tried the filling with both ground beef, turkey, sausage, or a combo of the three. Good stuff!!!

A great recipe that you can easily play with. I used tomato sauce instead of tomato soup because I put feta cheese in the mix and thought the tomato soup would be too sweet. Came out great!

When I looked at this recipe, it looked just like the one my mom used to make when I was a kid. I followed the directions (except used V8 rather than soup--I think the soup is too sweet tasting), but it was just okay--maybe my mom's secret touch was missing? Would make this one again as I haven't found a better one, but if anyone has my mom's secret touch...could you send it to me?

An absolute hit! my family loved these peppers! I added breakfast sausage to the hamburger and instead of the whole tomatoes I used two cans of rotel w/green chiles. Also I added cooked rice and deleted the water. Delicious! My husband told me to make sure this was added to our dinner rotation!

Delish!  Only a few changes which didn't affect the flavor: 1. Instead of adding rice to the stuffing mixture, I left it out.  2. Added diced bell pepper to the beef mixture, then served it over the rice.  Granted, the stuffed pepper is a more elegant show, but my family really enjoyed this.  THAT credit goes to Ms. Suzanne for sharing this yummy recipe!!

I really liked this recipe; although I made a few tweaks. First off, I used green/red peppers because I think they give off a better flavor. Also, I used chicken broth for everything that called for water (since I used ground turkey). I also added a good bit of paprika, minced garlic and garlic powder to the mix while I was cooking it.  I used a whole can of broth instead of 1/2 a cup, because the rice took longer to tenderize and it kept getting dryer than I prefer. There is nothing worse than a dry stuffed pepper! They came out really great! I was cooking for a friend of mine, and she said they were the best stuffed peppers she ever had!

Loved it! I never made these before and I followed some suggestions from other users - like layering the mixture, cheese and sauce throughout the pepper and it turned out great!! I also substituted tomato sauce for soup bc I was out and it worked fine!

This is what I would call a 'man meal'; I think meat and potato lovers will enjoy more than anyone.  (Hubby loved it, much like he does meatloaf.  I won't make either again til he asks for them.)  I give 4 stars b/c it is super easy to make and it did make for a different meal.  (I take one star away b/c I just didn't care for it - it tasted like lazy, unfinished spaghetti to me. As in, I was too lazy to cut up the peppers, I forgot the mushrooms, and I didn't have the rest of the ingredients to properly finish the spaghetti.  However, my DH raved over it... and happily finished off the leftovers the next night.)

Loved this recipe - I exchanged the ground beef for gound chicken and I cooked the rice a little longer then it called for and still found it didn't cook soft enouh.  I would definitely boil the bellpeppers longer next time cause the family complained they were still a little hard.  I also added red peppers to stuff and yellow which was a nice display.  The tomatoe soup was just the right added touch.  Great recipe - family is already requesting i find mini bell peppers to stuff and serve during the holidays.

I had several different colored peppers left from my garden  that needed cooking, so I ended up with some pieces instead of whole peppers. I slivered them and layered them with the rice mixture and cheese. Topped it with tomato soup, (I mixed in a little hot pepper sauce and Oregano for a little kick.) and cheese and baked as directed. Came out luscious. I live alone, so I froze what I didn't eat in individual servings. I'll get to enjoy this several times without the work!

Very good and easy.  I made it even easier by using leftover mexican flavored rice from the previous nights dinner.  I added a little garlic to the onions and cooked them separately from the ground beef then let it all simmer together for 15 min.  I cooked the peppers for 30+ min but i dont think that was enough time.  All the cheese didnt melt. I think covered and cooked at 350 it should be in the oven 45 min to get everthing nice and bubbly.

I think the canned tomato soup was too overwhelming, and not very good. It made it taste cheap, like...canned soup! I think I'll use regular tomato sauce next time, and not soup.

These peppers turned out great!  I would give it 5 starts, except I made some changes.  I didn't boil the peppers beforehand;  I just increased the time in the oven.  Used 1/2 cup of onions.  Cooked my rice in a rice cooker, mixed it with everything else and let it simmer for about 10 minutes to let the flavors mix.  I added cumin, red pepper flakes, salt, pepper, italian seasoning and extra Worcestershire sauce to the mixture.  Also used a can of diced tomatos with green chiles in them for an extra kick.  I followed other reviewers' advice and put sauce and cheese in the bottom of each pepper, added some of the mixture and then did another layer of sauce and cheese and then finished stuffing the pepper and topped with more cheese.  I used tomato sauce instead of tomato soup (don't care for the soup flavor).  Coated the bottom of the pan with a layer of tomato sauce to keep the bottoms of the peppers from burning.  Served over white rice.  Delicious; will definitely be making again!!

This is a great stuffed pepper recipe. I have made it several times. I made a couple of changes only to suit our taste but it is wonderful as is. I added a small can of kraut (drained) and about 4 ginger snap cookies in the sauce. You must try them this way! Fantastic!

It was great, but the rice took a long time to cook.  I think next time I will cook the rice a little before adding to the meat mixture.  I also was wanting more gravy, so I will add more tomato soup next time.

I made these last night for my family; my picky children (ages 2, 3, and 7) loved it!  I used onion powder instead of real onion and replaced the tomatoes with tomato paste because we don't care for the texture of tomatoes in a dish.  This is a real keeper!

Excellent. I added garlic and a little crushed red pepper to the meat mixture and instead of tomato soup I used tomato sauce.  I also cut the peppers in half lengthwise instead of cutting the tops off. Came out great. I will definitely make this again.

I prefer to use a raw meat mixture similar to meatloaf - it takes on more of the pepper flavor.  I did not care for the precooked meat.

This was a good recipe but I found the stuffing to be not enough. I even used only three peppers, they were very large but still next time I'll double the stuffing. I also used only one can of cream of mushroom soup instead of tomato soup and vegetable juice instead of tomatoes because my husband hates tomatoes. Never the less this turned out really well but I did use other reviewers tips like putting cheese and soup in the bottom of the peppers and slicing the peppers lengthwise, that is why I'm only giving 4 stars.

My family loved these peppers.  The best part was that my son who will not eat rice ate these.  He didn't even realize the rice was in them.  I made these just as written except I added garlic and I also put more cheese on top.  Fabulous!!  Thank you!

My husband loved these - said they are the best stuffed peppers he has ever had! I substituted a can of diced tomatoes with chipotle peppers for the regular tomatoes....it added some zip, but it was not overwhelming. I didn't have any shredded cheese, but the dish was just as good without it. I definitely will be making this many, many times!

These were delicious! The only change I made was to dice up the tops of the green peppers and saute them with the beef and onions. Great recipe.

I did not like this recipe at all...so bland.   I even added garlic powder to the meat mixture and followed everything else exactly.  Maybe it needs sauce added to the meat mixture?  Very very bland....will not be making again.

Great healthy dish!  Following other reviews- I added a bit ore worstershire.  I also put a bit of cheese on the bottom of each pepper along with the salt.  Put half meat mixture in and some tomato sauce on top then added the rest of the meat with the remaining sauce and topped with the cheese.  I also added some tomato paste to the tomato soup since I had a can opened already.  I cooked the rice, onions and garlic seperately and added to ground turkey at the end.

Thanks for the recipe! I love bell pepper, but I just do not know how to incorporate it into many dishes. This recipe is so perfect. I followed the basic structure of the recipe with some adjustments based on reviews. I used ground chicken and added some paprika, cayenne, garlic powder, poultry seasoning, Italian seasoning, and doubled Worcestershire. I didn't have tomato soup, so I used tomato sauce diluted with chicken stock. I also topped the stuffed peppers with Monterey pepper jack cheese. It turned out great but I see how it could have been better cooked in tomato soup. I like how this recipe has infinite potential to cook with bell peppers. Thanks.

This was delicious! I did make a few changes based on other reviews. I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of the whole tomatoes. I didn't bother boiling the peppers ahead of time. I also cooked the rice separately and then added it to the skillet at the end to warm it up and mix the flavors. I doubled the Worcestershire sauce and cheese amounts. I cut the peppers in half length-wise, laid them in a baking dish and stuffed them that way. I used tomato sauce rather than the soup and layered the sauce and beef/rice mixture when stuffing the peppers. I poured extra sauce and cheese over the peppers then baked for 40 minutes.

Took advice of other member and after stuffing 1/2 the pepper added some of the soup and then finished stuffing. Hubby & I both loved this recipe and will be cooking it again. It was wonderful and was even good left over & reheated!
I have to add a star to this. It seems out of all the recipes I have rated this one is on our meal rotation. Easy to make and tastes great. Try adding a few crushed red pepper flakes to the mixture!

I made some minor changes, and we loved it! First of all I was trying to use up some of the abundant peppers and tomatoes from my garden, so I didn't used canned tomatoes...just peeled some fresh and it tasted wonderful!  I also used ground turkey (97% fat free) and browned it with the onions and a couple cloves of garlic.  I cooked my rice prior to mixing it with the meat so that it wouldn't be crunchy - I grew up with crunchy stuffed peppers and never want to have that again!  Since everything was precooked prior to baking in the oven...I only found it necessary to use one can of condensed tomato soup and about 1/2 can of water. They were wonderful and my husband would like me to make these weekly!!!

Very filling, and tasty. Made a few changes: Instead of chopping whole tomatoes, bought a 14.5-oz. can of diced tomatoes with chilies (gave it an extra kick). Added some Italian seasoning, garlic powder and oregano in addition to the other spices to the meat/onion mixture. Also used a 6 oz. can of tomato sauce instead of tomato soup and water. Will definitely make again.

OMG, these were awesome.  I did change the recipe alittle bit, due to what I had.  I used ground Venison, 3 tom. diced, 8 oz tom. sauce, 1 C brown rice and 1 C beef broth.  Everthing else I left the same. Fiancee said this is in the top 5 best dinners.

These were SOOO GOOD!!! The only change I made was that I used pre-chopped canned tomatoe because I think it was kinda pointless to buy canned tomatoe & then chop it when they already sell diced tomatoe. My nana makes these but somewhat diffrently & I loved them. These were soogood & easy & much healthier than the ones I grew up on!! Thanks for the great recipe I will be making these from now on :)

These turned out fairly well in our house.  We have a large family and lots of peppers in our garden so I doubled the recipe and altered it a little according to other suggestions.  Since our peppers weren't real big I made them according to the recipe and cut them in half and laid them in a 9x13 pan.  I put the meat mixture on top (which I added 1/2 t. garlic powder, and 1 t. beef boullion).  Topped it with the soup and cheese. I have never made stuffed peppers before and was unsure of what to serve with it.  We opted for garlic cheese toast.  Good meal!  Thanks for the recipe.

Just like my daddy used to make.  I used brown rice instead of white but it the amount of water wasn't enough to soften it up prior to stuffing the peppers.  I stuffed the peppers with it anyway hoping the tomato soup would help it soften more, but it didn't.  Oh well.  Still had wonderful flavor.  Next time I will just cook up my rice in a rice cooker first and then mix everything up and then stuff the peppers. :-)

This was really good. The recipe didn't say whether to drain the tomatoes or not, so I measured the liquid from the can and used it in place of the water. It worked fine. Next time I will cut the peppers lengthwise since it makes them easier to eat. I would totally recommend this recipe. It was easy, quick, and delicious.

I love this and so does my family.  The only things I changed:  1.  I don't add the tomato soup (I don't really like the taste of it)- sometimes I just add more tomato.  2. I do a layer of cheese on the bottom, in the middle and on top inside of the pepper.

This was very good.  My husband loved it.  I used tomato sauce instead of tomato soup, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I doubt the sauce made much difference.  I will make this again.  OK.  I made this again.  I used spicy tomato sauce this time and it was a great addition.  These are good no matter what, but sometimes a bit of spice is good to throw into the routine.  :)

Great recipe.  I made a few changes due to lack of items on hand.  Instead of cheddar cheese I used pepper jack.  I also used diced tomatoes with onion and garlic.  Instead of tomato soup, I used V8 juice, which gave them a little more flavor and a little kick.  They were delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

These turned out perfect and my husband and son loved them.  I added just a little more instant brown rice (as the recipe did not specify what type to use) to stretch the 1 lb. of ground turkey I used. This is a keeper!

Made with both turkey and ground beef (in two separate peppers) and it was good.  I didn't parboil the peppers beforehand and they still turned out pretty tender.  My family has always served these in a bowl of tomato soup, and that worked well with this recipe.  Reminded me of my Slovak grandma's stuffed peppers!

Excellent!  Boyfriend loved these, we prefer a bit sweeter tomato topping, so I added a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar and it came out wonderful.

Delish. Used chicken cut up in small peaces instead. And followed the "home made" sauce route, per another user.

I followed others reviews and used:
-chopped tomatoes and green chilis
-added 2 cloves of garlic in with the beef mixture
-cut the tomato soup down to one can
-added cheese into the bottom of the peppers and the top
-seasoned the mixture with italian seasoning, oregano, and basil
They turned out good but they weren't show stoppers.

This is SUCH an easy and delicious recipe!  I was nervous to try stuffed peppers because I'm not a huge pepper fan, but even my husband loved this!  The only thing I changed was used Italian Seasoned Diced Tomatoes (instead of whole) and Mozzarella Cheese (instead of Cheddar). THIS IS FABULOUS!!!

I only gave it four stars because I modified the recipe a bit I guess. I modify a lot of the recipes to our liking and add things that I think we would like. I used some of the other recommendations. I cooked the rice separately with chicken broth and onions. I sauteed onions, garlic, and minced mushrooms and added them to the cooked beef. I also used spicy spaghetti sauce in place of the tomato soup and mixed that into the beef mixture and also put some on top of the peppers. I loved the cheese mixed throughout the peppers. I cut my peppers in half lengthwise. I had never done that before and I really liked the way they came out. I also used half green and half red peppers. The reds are really delicious! The next time I make these I am going to boil them for a little longer maybe because they were still a bit crunchy.

This recipe is a lot like the one my mom always made. I liked it a lot. The only things I would change though, would be to add about a half cup more of rice and water, and a lot more Worcestershire sauce. I would also add about a half cup more of cheese.

Excellent! I kind of approximated the amounts of ingredients I put in, since I had an unknown amount of ground beef and turkey to put in, but it turned out great! I dont' really like vegetables, but the baking really made the flavor of the meat mix with the vegetables, so that everything tastes great! I added a bit of extra cheese, but I don't think I'd have noticed if it wasn't there. I also didn't cover the peppers when they were baking (I don't know how I would do that), so the meat on top was a bit crispy, but nothing to complain about :)

I've tried many stuffed green pepper recipes, but this is the best!
I'm a bit calorie/fat conscious and you an easily cut the calories (but not taste) by about 150 calories per green pepper by doing the following:
1) use 90% lean meat
2) use 98% fat free tomato soup (and use only 1 can)
3) use fat free cheddar cheese

ate for lunch and dinner with my partner at the firehouse and it even got better as the day went on. I did add 3 cloves of garlic minced to the meat and onions for added flavor. DELICIOUS!

We loved this recipe! While trying to figure out what to make with the green peppers, tomatoes and onions from our garden I found this. I had never made stuffed green peppers before and this recipe is easy. It is definately a keeper at our house.

So good! It was exactly what I was looking for. I didn't have tomato soup so I used tomato sauce. Added garlic and a lot more cheese.  Keeper!

I only used three medium-size peppers and cut them lengthwise. I packed and overstuffed them and they were great!

This was wonderful!!! I made a few changes that really came out well. First, instead of ground beef we used ground turkey. I browned the turkey with onion and 4 diced garlic cloves. Once browned I added the W. Sauce, rice, diced tomatoes and we used beef broth instead of water. We also seasoned with S&P. The only other change was that instead of dilutting the tomatos with water we used beef broth again. This was so wonderful! Thanks!

My husband loved this recipe. Neither of us had really had stuffed peppers before, so this was the perfect simple recipe. This will stay in our recipe box from now on and we'll play with the ingredients more in the future.

I love this recipe.  I use it all the time.  I do tweak ingredients a little bit to fit our tastes.  You definately have to precook the peppers or they take forever in the oven.  I added minced fresh garlic, 1 small can of mushrooms and garlic salt.  After the beef was brown, I just added all the remaining ingredients, except the cheese, to cook together.  I used tomato sauce instead of soup and used less water.  The rice cooks just fine in the tomato soup.  I add a layer of the mixture to the bottom of the baking pan to hold the peppers in place, add the stuffed peppers and sprinkle any remaining mixture in between the peppers.  I sprinkle the whole thing with cheese.  Great recipe and very easy.

Great!  I made some modifications after realizing I didn't have the right ingredients, but I'm sure the recipe would have been just as good as written.  I used ground turkey instead of beef, added minced garlic, omitted the onion, added canned mushrooms, and used a bit of marinara instead of tomato sauce in the meat mixture.  They were delicious!  And this coming from a person who hated stuffed peppers growing up!

With our leftover brown rice (so I omitted the water) and minus the tomato soup, I'm giving it 5 stars.  We _love_ stuffed peppers and these were great.  Maybe this recipe would get 6 stars with the tomatoey topping, who knows.  I didn't have the soup on hand.  The boys (and dad) all added their favorite hot sauce, so maybe it wasn't spiced enough for them.  Or else, they just like putting hot sauce on stuff to impress me, who cares.  I'll keep this one and make it a lot.

I have made this twice. My only complaint with the first time is the lack of seasoning in the ground beef mixture. The second time I made it, I used brown rice, Rotel chopped tomatoes w/pepper mix, seasoning salt and garlic powder. It made it 100% tastier. I also used red peppers.

I thought these were good.  As written they would be very bland.  I added garlic, cumin, italian seasoning and chili powder to the meat mixture, along with 1 tablespoon of lemon juice.  I also added some of the tomato soup to the meat mixture when it was done browning.

This turned out great. This was my first attempt at stuffed peppers and we loved it! I cut the recipe in half for just my husband and me. I used italian style tomatoes and I also added minced garlic and chili pepper to the meat. I added extra cheese on top because what doesn't taste better with extra cheese? Thanks for the recipe

This is very similar to how my mother makes it, and it is so good!  The second time I made it, however, I was missing a few indgredients and substituted canned green beans for the tomatos and A-1 sauce for the Worchestershire. Don't laugh, it was still really good, and my husband loved it.  I will make this one again and again, but I'll have all the right ingredients on hand.

I thought this was great. Only changes I made were to use rice o roni with vermicilli because as I went to the pantry for my rice I was out and saw the box. Worked very well. Also only had diced tomatoes with garlic and herbs and used what cheese I had in fridge. My husband even ate this and liked it. I used green, yellow and red peppers, Aldi specials.

This recipe was a huge hit with the extended family.  I did not want to use ground beef and could not find Andouille Sausage at my local grocery store but the butcher recommended Chorizo Sausage(spicy sausage)as an excellent second, excellent recommendation!  I also used long grain wild rice and canned, seasoned tomatos.  My 30+ sister has been begging me to make this for her again soon!

I have made stuffed green peppers before but I really enjoyed this recipe and added some minced garlic and Adobo.  I like that fact that you par boil the peppers for five minutes.  I also used roasted garlic diced tomatoes and one cup rice instead of the half cup.  Easy and quick recipe that you can adjust to your taste and what you have on hand.  Great taste and texture.

I have made these twice.  They were delicious both times.  The red/yellow peppers were a great idea.  My husband can eat the red peppers but not the green.  Even my finicky son-in-law loved them.  The only thing I changed was to put the cheese on the top about 15 min. before taking them out of the oven.

great recipe.  I used a can of Manwich sauce over the peppers then added a touch of cheese at the end...Yummy!!  

Much more flavor than just tomato soup or sauce

Really good recipe.  Used can of diced tomatoes instead of whole.  And put minced garlic in when browning meat.  Those were only changes.

These were good but I made a few changes.  I used a whole med sized onion. Used diced tomatoes instead of whole and added about a quarter cup of mild salsa because some reviewers thought they were bland.  Also just used plain canned (hunts) tomato sauce on top as we don't buy condensed tomato soup so obviously we didn't have any on hand.  Topped with cheddar they came out very flavorful - not bland at all!  The salsa gave then a little bit of tang which was nice.  Thanks for the recipe will use again with some of these changes.  I might even break down a buy some soup to try on top.  I'm sure it would be good

My mother used to make these for me, and I used this recipe for my husband. it was very good. I omitted the tomato soup, but added some spicy canned tomatoes. I've also done this with lean ground turkey breast and brown rice, with very good results.

These peppers were amazing! I forgot to mix the cheese in with the stuffing before I stuffed the peppers so I just sprinkled the tops with cheese and I had some leftover stuffing anyway so I mixed cheese into that and just spread out the stuffing around the peppers too which helped keep them upright. My husband, 2year old son and I really enjoyed this dish! I didn't have any onions left so used garlic instead. I will definitely be making this dish again!

I have been making these green peppers for over a year and no matter who I make them for (ie family, friends, extended family) they ALWAYS get rave reviews!  They are so simple to make however make a great presentation.  Every once in a while I like to add a slice of provolone cheese on the top just prior to serving.  Thanks for the great recipe.

These are great!  I had never made stuffed peppers before and I think I definitely picked the right recipe to start with.  I made a couple small alterations:  I sliced extra-large peppers long-wise instead of cutting the tops off smaller ones, I used provolone cheese instead of chedder, I used crushed tomatoes instead of whole, and I added a few dashes of hot sauce to the filling.  This is an excellent, healthy meal!  Thank you!

One of my family's favorites! Even my 13 month old and 8 year old love this one. AND, they get several food groups in one meal, that is important to me. I dont add the tomato soup, I just subst. tomato paste instead of the whole tomatos. Delicious!

I have been making this recipe for about 6 years and I absolutely love it.  I've served it to many family members who rave every time.  I now use ground chicken and brown rice and use diced tomatoes instead of whole ones.  I also really never put in the worceshire sauce, I always forget but it doesn't make too much of a difference so I just leave it out.  I add garlic and always add salt, pepper and garlic powder to the tomato soup to give it some extra flavor.  Great served with mashed potatoes.

I was disappointed with this recipe. All we could really taste was tomato, there was no other flavor. My husband described this recipe as "Throwing random ingrediants into a green pepper and calling it dinner". It was not worth the effort. Will not be making this again.

This is a very good recipe that is easy--I will add it to my list of 'regulars'.  However, there is still something missing and I can't figure out what!  It's just a tad on the bland side for my taste (hence 4 stars and not 5).  The second time I made the recipe I added garlic, extra onion and double the worces. sauce, but it was still lacking something. Even so, this is a good meal and I will keep making it and tinkering with it until I get it to my liking.

Absolutely the best stuffed peppers I've ever had.  Only things I did differently were added a dash of red hot pepper flakes for spice, substituted diced tomatoes with herbs, and spaghetti sauce in place of tomato soup.  Great dish!

This was so delicious. I read the reviews first so I could get some pointers of course. I added a can of Mexicorn, Original Rotel, cooked instant rice ahead of time then mixed it in at the end. I added plenty of cumin and cheddar and mozerella cheese. I also decided to use Prego sauce instead of the soup. My husband said they tasted better than his mother's which is saying alot! The kids love them, my parents love them so I rated this 5 stars. It's well deserved. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

Fabulous recipe...
I did use one pouch of Liptons Dirty rice, and two pouches of Liptons Spanish rice. ( I cooked them before adding )
I topped it with Campbells Zesty tomato soup, and of course I added more cheese.
Delicious!!

This is a really good recipe! My husband (who can be quite a picky eater)  wants me to make this again next week. The only problem I had was trying to make sure the rice was fully cooked. Had to add more water halfway through simmering the rice and beef mixture because it was drying out and the rice was still not cooked. Otherwise everything else was fairly simple.

Great recipe.  I read the reviews and added some changes.  I seasoned the cheicken and cooked the chicken wtih fresh parsley, fresh garlic and green onions.  I used yellow rice and chopped spinach (frozen.  Instead of tomato soup I used Chuncy Garden spaghetti sauce.  I topped it off with Feta Cheese and Sharp cheddar.

This is a great recipe. I don't usually get too excited about stuffed green peppers but my boyfriend and I loved these. The tomato soup was the key, i think. I did add canned corn also. Didn't change a thing otherwise. YUMMY!

I liked these although my man did not. A different twist on stuffed peppers but defintely not what your mom used to make. Needs more rice and should call for some sauce. The soup makes it runny. It was okay, just missing something.

I used more cheese, and instead of tomato soup used Prego spaghetti sauce. This was absolutely fabulous, I would definitely make it again. Next time I might add some more rice, and other veggies, like maybe mushrooms.

Great recipe, especially for gardeners! I always freeze my bell peppers so the parboiling is not necessary and I find it easier to stuff them when they are cut in half. I also cut out salting the peppers and have not found that it affects the flavor at all. Delicious!!

This was an excellent recipe for peppers fresh from the garden. I omitted the cheese to save a few calories and it was still wonderful with just sliced tomato on top.

I really like these I just can't follow a recipe to save my life so I switched it around a bit.  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef to start out with to save on fat.  I used one can of diced peeled tomatoes with roasted garlic.  I added garlic, fresh basil, fresh parsely, oregano, garlic, cumin, cayenne pepper and 4 tbls of worcestershire sauce, and added a can of corn.  I used minute rice as well and had no problems.  I also switched it to the kraft cheddar melt cheese and used 1/2 cup onion.  I used healthy choice tomato soup to make it a bit healthier.  A huge hit and will make again only with some black beans in it as well next time.

A great start for the new stuffed pepper cook. It turned out great, but for more flavor, the 2nd time I made them, I used spaghetti sauce insted of the soup. I also added some season salt. Will make again

My hubby said that of all my attempts at cooking (!), this was the best outcome. What do you mean "attempts"?!?I'm not a bad chef, but sometimes meals don't quite turn out. But this recipe is a real winner! He said this is his favorite meal now. It took longer than I usually like to spend on a meal, and it was VERY filling, so this will go on our "special treats" menu. I made it just like the recipe said to with the following modifications: I used low fat options where available, and added garlic like someone else suggested. Delish!

I was looking for a basic stuffed bell pepper recipe yesterday...and I found this one.  I made some alterations (okay, a lot of alterations) and it turned out great!!  

Here's what I did:  

- chorizo sausage (not ground beef)
- minced celery (1)
- minced carrot (1)
- minced garlic (4 cloves)
- 1.5 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce
- fresh herbs (parsley, basil)
- shredded Jack, mozzarella and chedder cheese.  

I also substituted the green peppers for yellow and red peppers (adds a nice sweetness!)

The peppers had so much flavor--I swear if you try the recipes with my alterations, you'll love 'em!

Yummy!  The only thing i did different was instead of the soup, i used a jar of chunky garden spaghetti sauce.  I put a stuffed pepper in the middle of a pretty plate then garnish around it with some more of the filling-  this was a great romantic dinner with my hubby.  thanks for sharing!

My family enjoyed this meal very much.  My husband told me that if his mother was here right now , she would hate me because my stuffed peppers taste better than hers.  Ha!  I took other peoples advice and added seasoning to the meat while browning- garlic powder, adobo, and pepper.  I doubled the amount of rice too.  I think next time I may melt some cheese on top of the stuffed peppers because it's my perogative and I can do what I wanna do.

This is the classic recipe!  Please try it with tomato soup even though it sounds a little odd! It provides and smooth and creamy consistency that b that blends perfectly with the other flavors (acidic tomato sauce cannot provide this!)  Of course adding freshly minced garlic, onion, oregano and paprika were a must for me!

Da lish!  Changed it a bit to add taste.  I used some diced tomatoes and some salsa in place of whole tomatoes. Added garlic.  I bought from Safeway deli, homemade tomatoe w/basil bisque. I used minute rice instead of regular to cut down time simmering from 15 min to about 5 minutes (made this on a weeknight).
Next time, think I will use half ground beef half italian sausage.
It was yummy, a keeper for sure.

My husband & I really enjoyed this recipe and it was simple to make.  My only suggestion would be to perhaps cut the big green peppers in 1/2 and stuff the halves, as all that green pepper got overwhelming.  Makes great as leftovers too!

I really thought this was a good pepper recipe.. the only thing i didn't like about it was first of the all the price of green peppers is outrageous.  For 6 peppers, I paid almost $14.  I followed the recipe exactly except adding some garlic in when i sauteed the beef.  The peppers were a bit crunchy for my taste, but everyone else devoured them.

Great recipe!  As a stay at home mom with very little time to spend in the kitchen, I just sliced open the cooked peppers and layed them flat in the dish to save time on stuffing.  Everyone ate it for two days and we can't wait to make it again.

Having a bumper crop of green peppers this season, I decided to find a recipe for stuffed green peppers. I used 8 small green peppers, 1 quart of home canned tomatoes, seasoned the ground beef with grill mates seasoning for a little kick along with browning it with the onion, added 1 cup Fat Free Cheddar Cheese.  I also added 1/4 cup reg. parmesan cheese. I only used 1 can of tomato soup with a little water for the gravy part, was just enough.  It took alot longer than 15 minutes to cook the rice, so I cooked it until it was tender, about 25 minutes.  Baked in 350 degree oven for 45 minutes, done to perfection! Using FF cheese cut the calories down, and for WeightWatchers, it ended up being 4 points per pepper. I will be making these AGAIN! Thanks for the great recipe!!

Really really good.  At first I didn't think I would like the tomato soup over them, but it really added an excellent flavor.

I made this with approx 1-1/4 lb of lean ground beef and 1/2 lb of pork sausage.  Used green onions in place of regular onions.  Also used 1 cup of rice and more water as others had done.  Had to cook for 45 minutes to ensure rice was cooked through.  In the sauce I used 1 can of tomato sauce, and one of paste, and almost 2 cups of water.  Did use the tomato soup on top.  My family really liked it.  It was pretty tasty!  For me, next time I will make it without the cheese.

This was very good and very different.  I usually make stuffed peppers Italian style, but I liked this one.  I added a little extra onion and 2 cloves crushed garlic and some oregano.  I upped the rice to 1 cup and the water to 2 cups (otherwise the mixture kept drying out).  I also added in the juice from the tomatoes.  It took my rice mixture almost 30 minutes to become tender.  And since you are only baking the peppers for 30 minutes, you really need to make sure the rice is DONE.  My husband really liked these as well.  Thanks.

So good! Ive made this many times! I have found tho, it only makes 4-5 peppers worth. Maybe I just have larger green peppers. I also just use a can of diced tomatoes. And I either use Zesty Tomato Soup or add seasoning to it.

YUMMY!  I love this recipe! My husband hates bell peppers, so i omit them and make them in small corning ware bowls.  I also add extra rice, 1/2 c. does not seem like enough rice for me.

these were not bad, but not what I was expecting.  They were very soupy and the cheese made them somewhat creamy-  Kind of an odd combination, but it worked and my husband and I thought they were OK.  I think I will try a different recipe next time.

Wow!  This is a keeper.  Very tasty recipe, just be sure you don't overcook the peppers.  I would also add more tomato sauce (possibly double) over the stuffed peppers.  It added a nice, substantial tang to the end product.

This was a wonderful meal.  I used red peppers - less acidity for dh, and so much better.  I skipped the worcestershire sauce,tomato soup, and water.  Instead, when it says to add the tomatoes, add Pastene Kitchen Ready (ground, peeled tomatoes - the whole can) with a little italian seasonings.  It makes a mini marinara that you can pour over the peppers.  Delicious.

I was a little nervous about venturing out on something so different - but to tell you the truth, these were a breeze to make and really delicious.   I only could find 4 decent medium sized peppers so I halved them and stuffed them beyond all get out, giving me 8 fat peppers.  I only used 1 can of soup, which was more than enough.  I also mixed in 1/2 a small can of Redpack "Hot n Spicy" tomato sauce which added the perfect amount of heat!  I will DEFINTELY make these again without a doubt!!!

A definite hit if you have guests coming over. It was easy to prepare and can be done ahead of time- just pop them in the oven to heat up the filling.

This was a delicious recipe.  My husband never like his moms, and said he wasn't going to eat mine.  But when he saw what I was putting into it, he actually said he wanted to try it.  He liked it!  The only reason why I gave this a four star rating was because I didn't have enough of the beef mixture to fill 6 peppers.  I only had enough for 4.  Otherwise, this is a keeper!

YUMMMMMM!!! I made this for picky Korean in-laws, and it was a huge hit; even though they aren't big on cheese, they loved it!
Only recommendation is to add more than 1/2C water; I found it took a while for the rice to become tender, it soaks up the water fast and everything tends to scorch. This is truly delicious! Definitely worth trying, and will make it again!

I thought the recipe was really good.  My family however didn't like the tomato soup.  They thought that tomato sauce would be better.  Also, they thought the meat mixture was too mushy.  I will make it again with a few changes.

I really like this recipe and have made it twice already. I do however add a bay leaf, oregano and worc sauce like some other reviewers have suggested and I think that makes it taste better. I cant wait to try another reviewers idea of topping them with mashed potatoes. What a great idea.

This was a great recipe. I assumed this recipe meant 6 pepper halves so I used three peppers and halved them and it worked out perfect. I also added 1/2 tsp dried basil and it was terrific. Next time I will try dill or oregano. I omitted the tomato soup as my husband gets such awful heartburn from it. It was still wonderful. Also, I think next time I will top with more cheese and in the last couple minutes of baking.

I made this last night using ground turkey and they were very good - I added lotsa red pepper flakes, Thyme and toasted pine nuts to the filling.  I tried to use 2% milk cheddar - next time I'll use the real stuff and just top them with it. Definitley use two cans of soup - made for a great sauce. I mixed in some green tabasco too - YUM!

The original recipe is great, but I varied it and used Turkey Store ground Italian flavor meat, and also red, yellow and orange peppers instead of green.  This was also a hit as was the original version.

This was wonderful!  I had to use more water and cook it for almost 40 minutes to get the rice tender. I added garlic and a bay leaf as others suggested.  Thanks for sharing!  I'll be making this again.

I expected a lot more from this recipe when I read the great reviews, but this dish is nothing to write home about. It was certainly filling, but rather tasteless.  I won't bother to make this one again.

This came out really well.  My girlfriend now thinks that I can cook!  I used red wine to thin out the tomato sauce.  I also sprinkled some grated mozarella cheese over the stuffed peppers.

My husband didn't think he liked stuffed peppers but loved these. The only thing there are a lot of grams of fat in them. But great!!

Great recipe! I didn't use the soup to spread over the top, instead I used the juice from the canned tomatoes. It was wonderful. The whole family enjoyed them.

This was a great recipe, though it could have had a little more flavor to it - I think next time I might try some more Worcestshire sauce and no cheese.  Very easy to fix!

This recipe reminds me of the frozen stuffed peppers made by Stouffer's.  The tomato soup makes a wonderful sauce with just a hint of sweetness.  Very, very good.

I followed this recipe step by step but the peppers were way too tough for my taste. The filling was good and my family all liked it. I only used one can of tomato soup and it was plenty. Next time I would make these in the instant pot or slow cooker because I like my peppers to be very very tender.

Easy ingredients and directions. They tasted even better the 3rd day !  Made all six as directions suggested. But used bread pans and put 3 green peppers in each.  It’s just my husband and myself, so breaking them up was perfect. They stored well in frig with plastic wrap .

I tried this recipe as I wanted to try something different from my traditional peppers with barley and lots of sauce inside the meat mixture. It was ok.  Bland and a bit too dry for me but my son liked it.

I changed out tomato soup for a jar of organic spaghetti sauce (no sugar added,) added "fire-roasted" diced tomatoes, and used GF Soy Sauce instead of Worcestershire sauce (which is 40 - 60% wheat), also did not put cheese in sauce, but layered cheese in the pepper with the sauce, and sprinkled cheese on top before putting the "lid" on peppers. Very tasty indded!

Good and easy!   
I've made this recipe 2 times because my husband LOVES it!  It is  a quick and easy meal and freezes well.  The recipe says it makes six peppers but keep in mind what size peppers you are using.   The first time I made it  I got four.  The 2nd time I got 5.  To get six you need to have peppers on the smaller side.  I did make one change out of laziness.  Instead of the tomato soup, I just put ketsup on top and it was very good.  This is a KEEPER!

Yummy recipe!  I used both red and green peppers and I also diced up the tops of the peppers and added that to the meat mixture. My son put a pice of provolone cheese on his at the end. We all liked them!  Will make again- might put some corn in next time too.

Delicious! I made mine with ground turkey, 
gluten free rice, and a mixture of shredded 
mild cheddar and mozzarella. It was fantastic! I will definitely be adding this to our favorite receipts.

Wonderful recipe!  So “down home”.  I made one change - I didn’t have tomato soup, so I used a can of tomato sauce mixed with a small can of Rotel tomatoes.  Delicious.  We ate leftovers for two days, they were so good.

Thanks for the base line recipe...I followed the amount of beef and onion and Worcestershire but I used a can of fire roasted garlic diced tomatoes and added it to the meat and rice mixture.  A little salt n pepper.  I skipped the cheese and I loaded up halved peppers got 10 instead of 5.  And poured tomato sauce all over them. I made sure I had enough sauce for my mashed potatoes.  It was soooo good!

Loved the tip to boil the peppers before. I used Italian sausage instead and added red pepper flakes. I would only use one can of tomato soup next time. I added garlic to the onions and meat. I also broiled cheddar cheese on top of the peppers for the last five minutes of baking.

I changed the tomato soup to a tomato sauce. This tasted just like my Mom's stuffed peppers. I will definitely make this again.

Close version yet I use couscous instead of rice .I add a Tuscan spice I personally created because I like it spicy.  And I bake first the bell peppers In olive oil then slam the ingredients together...and don't forget the cheese. Plenty of mozzarella to create an awesome treat!

I am on a small French island so didn’t have tomato soup or cheddar cheese.  Easy recipe with additions of chopped garlic, chopped fresh parsley and a few red pepper flakes to the sauce.  I substituted another cheese which was fine. And for the topping I made a few circles of siracha sauce.  We like spice and the peppers were tasty.

Used natures seasoning rather than salt and pepper. Also added a little sugar to the whole peeled tomatoes after I chopped them I'm before adding it 2 the rice and beef mixture to bring down the acidity due to my GERDS disease.

I hate to do such a low rating, But I found this recipe (to my family’s taste) very bland. The stuffing was mushy. I was following the instructions ,since this was the first time I was making this, but I kept thinking to myself,”I don’t know about this?!” 
I am going to use this as a blue print and maybe do half hamburger and half sausage. Season to your taste cook, drain. Sauté onions , garlic with other veggies and herbs of your choice . Cook rice separately! NO cheddar cheese! Mix all this together and add like 1/2 cup of fresh mozzarella or Parmesan. Top with a mixture of Italian bread crumbs mixed with a little Parmesan in the peppers.  No mush. I think the problem was just too much cheddar cheese mixed in ruined the whole recipe. I am so sorry to the chef. But no.

I make this but use tomato sauce not soup.  If you use chunky tomato sauce you can eliminate the chopped tomatoes.

It was very good.  I followed the recipe. Except I added garlic with the beef and onions and some italian seasoning.  And realized that I didn't have cheddar cheese so I used Mozzarella which was very good.   It turned out great.

I have made stuffed peppers for years using basically the same recipe.  I use green, yellow, orange and red bell peppers for variety, a brown and wild rice blend and instead of regular old plain old diced tomatoes use diced tomatoes with green chilies to jazz it up some.

The only adjustment I was that I added some garlic powder to the meat mixture; the tomato soup really took it over the moon..It was really good and I will definitely will be making this again.

I have made this recipe 4 or 5 times. I tweaked the recipe by using only 2 peppers, and switched out the ground beef to ground turkey and only used on can of tomato soup.
Great Stuff!

Very good, I will be using this recipe often! I used 1 can of tomato soup instead of 2, as I didn't think more than 1 was needed. I did add spices; generous amount of salt, pepper, oregano, and basil. This was a great way to use up green peppers from my garden.

These were amazing. I followed the most helpful reviewer's comments by adding  basil, oregano, and garlic. I also sliced the green peppers lengthwise and put a small pinch of cheese in the bottom of each pepper. Turned out great.

Very good, but not great.  It needed more flavor, because it was pretty bland.  I did use Lawry's Seasoned Salt on mine and that made it taste MUCH better.

Great recipe, made as written, no substitutions, just cut it back for two servings.  Might make some tweaks next time, but this was my first attempt at stuffed peppers.  I was really happy with the result.

I made this for my picky husband last week and now he's asking for it again. I sliced my peppers in half and than stuffed.  Much easier. and instead of fresh tomatoes I used a can of rotel with chilies. It was very good!

I didn't do the tomato soup, and I used the Knorr Rice Sides Spanish rice instead of regular rice, which comes quicker and added a lot of flavor, but everything else was spot on. Looks DELICIOUS!!!! Tastes even better! Definitely something super easy with ingredients I already had on hand. I will certainly be making this again.

Great Recipe!  I used tomato sauce instead of soup but think I will use the soup next time. I cooked rice separately before adding to mixture, added more cheese and added corn.  I don’t like green pepper so, I used the orange bell pepper.  Really good recipe and easy!

I’ve tried a few versions. This is the one that I like because of the tomato soup, it changes the flavor from just tomato sauce, like every other recipe out there that I’ve tried. 
Soooooo here’s my modifications. I added oregano and basil and mix one can of soup with one can of water then mix that in with the rice/meat mix. Stuff it into pepper top with cheese and bake. 
I tried this time not salting the peppers directly and family all commented on it wasn’t the same. 
So while I thought it was too much salt, the peppers need it (IMO) 
This really did hit the mark of what I wanted from a stuffed green pepper, and it’s good for throwing in leftover veg from the fridge too. To make it a bit more healthy :)

I made this for my husband and mother and they both enjoyed it. I did add some bacon to the ground beef mix, as well as some Italian seasoning, and added some extra cheese to the top for the last few minutes of baking. I think if I make it again, I’ll try slicing the peppers in half before stuffing and baking them, since they cut them in half to eat them anyway. But it was a pretty simple recipe, and a little faster to cook  than some of the others I’d seen.

Very Good.  I used 4 peppers.  I cut them in half, so I had 8 halves.  I didn't make the sauce and I didn't put the cheese on the top.  Followed the recipe other than that.  I did add the cheese in the stuffing mix.  I put in a greased 9x13 pan, covered and cooked.

Good - but meat needs more flavor. Will add fresh garlic to meat and cayenne pepper.  Also did not use tomato soup - when I made it this way it tasted too much like tomato soup and was too watery.  I use fire roasted diced tomatoes for all tomatoes.

I followed the recipe exactly how it is written. I didn’t read all suggestions from reviews before I made it. I agree it can use a little more spice but we enjoyed it very much even as it is. 

It was easy and quick to make too. I like that

I honestly thought this just tasted terrible. The premade ones sold in a box at the grocery store legitimately taste better... I have no idea what this recipe is missing or why I thought it was so bad, but it was, really disappointing because I do enjoy eating stuffed peppers!

Delicious!  Per other reviews I cut the peppers in half, sprinkled a little cheese in the peppers before filling them, added basil, oregano and Italian seasoning, used bouillon instead of water to thin the tomato soup.  I think the cheddar cheese added to the meat mix at the end is what really brings this recipe together and makes the meat filling so delicious.  Also I used Uncle Ben's microwave packet of rice (super easy microwave 90 seconds) so it was fully cooked before I added it to the meat mixture.

Made these as directed for the most part. I used a whole small onion because, why not? And I only used one can of soup. I took someone’s suggestion and put a scoop of filling in each pepper followed by a spoonful of the soup. Then I filled the peppers up the rest of the way and topped with the remaining soup. I also added more cheese on the top after the stated cooking time and then popped them back in the oven uncovered just long enough for the cheese to melt. They were fabulous. Even my picky daughter loved the filling, although she wouldn’t eat the cooked pepper. This is a new family favorite!

I have made this recipe many times... I use the exact ingredients, but I cut the peppers into bite size pieces and mix them and the tomato soup and a cup of cheese with everything else and then put another cup of cheese on the top.

way to bland- It needs more spice but It was still good.  I added some crushed red pepper flakes to give it more of a spice. I like spicy foods though!

Awesome base recipe. I did modify though - I first sautéed the onions and minced garlic, then added rice and cooked for a couple of minutes. Mixed in one can of diced, fire-roasted tomatoes and then covered that with chicken stock. I also added way more Worcestershire sauce, like a tablespoon or two. I let it come to a boil, then simmered for 15 minutes until rice was tender. I browned the meat (turkey instead of beef) and added the rice combination. I sliced the peppers lengthwise before stuffing, and cooked them on the pellet grill for 15 minutes, with just cheese, no tomato soup. DELICIOUS!! Can't wait to make it again!

This was really easy and delish.  I didn’t change the recipe and my family of four crushed them.  Tonight is the second time making this recipe in a week and a half.....per request of my 15 year old!  Said he would rather have these than McDonald’s.  Mickey D’s is something we usually grab after the entire house is exhausted from school and work!  Thanks for a keeper recipe!

I used red, orange and green peppers.  Cutting them down the middle was good idea. No soup used.  I added an 8 oz. can ot tomato sauce to the meat mixture. after stuffing, I put a scoop of picante sauce on top and baked as directed.  YUM

Very tasty recipe!!! I made almost as is with a few small changes.  Use 1/2 cup onion and 3 cloves fresh garlic.  Also added oregano, basil,  and italian seasoning to the beef and rice simmer.  I put a small sprinkle of cheese on the bottom of the pepper before stuffing and also a small sprinkle on top.  Very pleased, would make again!

I loved this recipe!  I did follow a few suggestions.  I used canned diced tomatoes with green chilies.  That helped give the filling a little flavor.  I also added red pepper flakes, basil, oregano, and Italian seasons to the filling.  Without the spices I think it would have been pretty blah.  I also only used 1 can of tomato soup for the gravy instead of 2.  Delicious and I will be making this again!

I’m giving this 4 stars only because I modified the recipe.  To the meat, I added  taco seasoning, freash diced tomatoes,  and  crushed garlic along with the onion. I also changed out the tomato soup for enchilada sauce.  I cut the peppers in half and substituted chopped cauliflower instead of rice for half of them.  (The family didn’t even realize it.). This turned out to be a great meal.  Served with a green salad and a quesadilla.

I had a nagging feeling that I should have cooked the rice first, but I decided to follow the directions. Alas, when I sat down to take a bite, the rice was still hard. I had to add some water to the bottom of the dish with the peppers, cover it, and steam it for another 15 minutes for the rice to soften sufficiently. So my advice is to cook the rice first, and then mix it in with the rest of the filling. I used a ground meat substitute from Trader Joe's to make this vegetarian, and it worked just fine. :)

I followed the recipe exactly other than not using green peppers as I didn't have any. They were delicious! And my toddlers just gulped them down..definitely adding these to the favourites file.

This dish was delicious.  I will definitely be making it again.  The chicken was very moist and flavorful.  I used white cheddar cheese.  The only change I will make next time is less of the soup mixture and more breadcrumb topping.

These are very similar to the ones my mom made me as a kid. However, I highly recommend adding garlic to the beef mixture, along with onion powder, garlic powder and some Italian seasoning. Also, I would pre-cook the rice before adding it in. For those that used tomato sauce, that's great, but a totally different recipe. This is for people who use tomato soup instead. It irritates me when people say they made this but they actually made a totally different recipe instead.

First time I made it following the directions exactly ... delicious! Five stars. Family loved it. Second time, I made some adjustments that took it over the top. First I sauted the onion and a couple cloves of garlic in butter. I pre-cooked the rice. Then I added it all to cooked Italian Sausage and added a cup of pasta sauce to the filling (along with all the other ingredients). I also cut the bell peppers long ways and microwaved them upside down with a little water in the baking dish prior to filling them (way easier than using a separate pot and boiling water). The family RAVED.

Love this recipe, I use it as a base for making stuffed peppers with what I have in the fridge. I’ve also switched it up for my lower carb lifestyle and added more veggies and omitted the rice altogether. Thank you for sharing!

I think this is a great foundation recipe to get cooking times and ingredient ratios from. I do modify it for my own taste. My family likes a little bite in the green peppers, so I don't boil them.  I only use 3-4 peppers for the recipe, and I cut them in half to fill them. I use chunky spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce, and saute onions and garlic into the beef before I mix the filling together. I also sometimes add a can of diced tomatoes, a Serrano pepper, or seasoning into the rice for extra flavor.

My mom use to make these when i was a kid, was too scared to try them and i do not know her recipe and she is no longer with us to help me.  but these were not as great as I would have hoped them to be.  they were eatable, my daughter just ate the filing with chips like a dip.  i followed the recipe to a tee and to me it tasted like sloppy joe mix.  going to try one or 2 other recipes before i give up on them tho.

I was never a big fan of stuffed peppers. I basically made them for my boyfriend who is a fan and I was pleasantly surprised how good they were! Next time I will make them with ground turkey. The only change I made was I used a can of tomato soup and a can of tomato sauce because I only had one can of tomato soup on hand. Will definitely make again in the near future!!! Thank You Suzanne for a yummy recipe!!!

My father was an amazing cook so I had little hope that it would be anything like I remember his tasting. I was wrong. These were delicious. and as close to my daddy's recipe that I have found. I did take some of the other suggestions. I used tomato sauce for one of the cans of soup, omitted the water, added Italian seasoning and oregano, and increased the Worcestershire sauce to 2 teaspoons.

I made this for my husband and he has been asking me to make it again and again.

This is the same recipe i have been using for YEARS! Many reviewers change the recipe so it is unrecognizable. As an inventive cook,  I like to change up recipes using what I have on hand or what I am in the mood for. I won't bore you with all my various changes I make, but, I WILL share a timesaving tip. I cut the peppers lengthwise. Once I have assembled the stuffing, I place the uncooked peppers cut side down on top of the stuffing in a large skillet and cover. The peppers cook perfectly while the stuffing cooking. Assemble the peppers with stuffing in a baking pan and finish them up in the oven.  Np parboiling, no microwave and one less dish to wash! Yum!

I would not make these again. I just thought they were so-so.  They are relatively easy to make, but they lack the pizzazz of the Chef John recipe you have for stuffed green peppers (which are more work, by the way).    I took the advice of another cook of adding the beef boullion to the rice and beef mixture, as well as spooning some of the tomato soup sauce into the pepper as opposed to just over it, but it still tasted just OK.

The filling for these stuffed peppers was delicious. The only complaint I have is that the peppers themselves need to be boiled longer than recommended so that they aren't so raw and crunchy.

This turned out great! I did not change much. I used half the beef because I only had 3 peppers, but last minute decided to make the full recipe for the filling because my peppers were humongous. In the end that was wise, it made the perfect amount. I added about 2tbsp of tomato paste to the soup and did not add water, and followed another user’s suggestion to spoon in some soup halfway after filling the peppers. I saved a bit of cheese for the top but did not increase the overall amount of cheese. This was a yummy and simple recipe and even my picky children gobbled it up.

Made it exactly per the instructions and it came out delicious. Will definitely make it again.
I take that back somewhat.
I had 1.3 lbs of meat and only  4 peppers so I had some extra mixture but really only enough for one more. The peppers where large.

Yes, I made a couple of changes.  This recipe is very close to the one which I've been using since I first got married.  I add a small can of (drained) corn, but I don't add in the 2 cans of tomato soup (in order to eliminate the sodium, and the extra calories).  When the peppers are almost done, I slide them out of the oven, and top each pepper with a generous squirt of ketchup, and then top them w/cheese....and back into the oven they go for a couple of more minute, until the cheese is nicely melted.

Instead of adding water, I added milk  to give it a creamier taste. Half and  half or whipping cream gives the sauce much more flavor.  Half-and-half or whipping cream can also be used with a small pinch of sugar for added flavor.  I also substituted red peppers for the green because the green peppers give the dish too strong a flavor.  The red peppers half a much milder taste and with the cream/milk made the dish a winner.

Had been hesitating in making this cause I wasn't sure how receptive my family would be. I got a "Hmmpf...this is good. This is REALLY good".   That's HUGE from the hubby.  Son took the leftovers back to school.  I LOVED that it was made with tomato soup.  Will make again with son's suggestion to also add to the recipe Taco Seasoning.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

Wow, this dish has been around since my childhood and I'm 76.
During WWII we did't always have a lot of choices and this dish was a family favorite for leftovers, rarely did my mother ever fix this from exactly the ingredients given here, sometimes it was rice, sometimes leftover spaghetti but she always used ground beef which even during that time was better than the ground beef available today.  She always used red or yellow peppers because that's what she had in her garden.  She always topped her peppers with Parmesan cheese, we didn't use cheese as much as we do today, at least not in the same ways we do now.  She topped her peppers with a can of tomato sauce.
She used garlic and herbs according to her taste, it always changed according to availability because it was always out of the garden or what was at the store.

This recipe allows a lot of opportunity to individualize as many reviewer‘s have said. One reviewer said they cut the peppers in half lengthwise. I went one step further and cut them in quarters length wise and put them at the bottom of a casserole dish with the filling on top. This way the serving size is more individualized than just one pepper per person. The children eat less and the grown-up men and teenage boys eat lots more.

I love this and I made it a number of times.  My personal changes were to change up half of the beef for ground sausage and to use tomato sauce for half of the topping sauce.  Tomato soup is so sweet it was overwhelming.  I also like to add a little seasoning to the sauce - cayenne, onion powder, garlic power, regular pepper, but that's my personal preference.  If you like it traditional style, stick with the soup!  Still will make again, especially when we have fresh peppers in the garden!

My mother always added a can of corn to the mixture. When tomatoes and corn are in season I use fresh. Dice tomatoes over a bowl to keep the juices but remove seeds.  Usually one or two ears of sweet corn will yield enough to equal a 10 oz can of corn. I prefer the tomato soup over sauce as others suggest. I also top them off with buttered bread cubes to  give it a crunch. Just make some bread cubes from whatever bread you have on hand make as much as you like. I tend to use 4 slices per 6 whole"topped" peppers . If you are slicing your peppers in half you may need to double this according to your desires. 

After cubing bread, place a stick of butter in a frying pan and once melted toss in cubes and fry until toasted and golden. Then place on top of peppers evenly before pacing in oven.

Very good! I halved the peppers, as I always do when making stuffed peppers. Also, I used red peppers b/c I had a bunch on hand to use up. I really liked the addition of the cheddar cheese on top. I used more onion than called for and also added in some garlic. This was a simple dish that can be seasoned according to how you like. I would make these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I read the recipe, then started looking around for what I had on hand.  I ended up going full throttle Italian on these, including using mozzarella cheese and a half jar of good spaghetti sauce.  Garlic, onion, and lots of Italian seasonings later, these were the best stuffed peppers I've ever made.  My husband loved them enough to be glad to eat leftovers that warmed up well in the microwave the next day.  That was last week and he started asking for them again, today!

I followed  the recipe exactly as it was the same as an old favorite that I had lost except for the addition of the tomato soup which I tried.  Although we enjoyed the addition of the soup, it is also good without it.  Just a good recipe.

These were awesome!  I cut my peppers lengthwise and would definitely do that again.  Used only 1 can of tomato soup and it was enough.  Will definitely make this again.

This recipe gets a whopping five stars . . . better the next day after the flavors have melded together . . . I put one one the peppers in a bowl a day after making them and poured some of the tomato soup over it. microwaved for about forty seconds and oh my goodness was that ever delish

The only change that I have made to this recipe were: Using ground turkey and added 4 links of Hot Italian sausage.  Instead of using Tomato soup, I have use spaghetti sauce. Plus, I have using a 1/2 cup of Monterey Jack Cheese in the meat mixture and use the Sharp Cheddar cheese as topping

I would have only rated it 4 stars if after the first night, but this is even better as leftovers! Maybe the extra days incorporate the flavors more? Who knows, but I had it for leftovers on 2 different days and loved it!

Great recipe! I also cut them lengthwise and added italian seasonings and cayenne pepper. Didn't have any condensed soup, so I just poured tomato sauce over the peppers, then sprinkled additional cheese on top. Nice to have a good recipe without bread or pasta in our dinner rotation! Thanks!

These stuffed peppers were great and I like them topped with cheddar cheese.  I bought the largest peppers I could find and enjoyed myself.  I will definitely cook these peppers again.

I made this recipe exactly as it is written and my family loved it. However, my grandmother used to make it with half ground beef and half sausage. It was  delicious! My family loved it, but I think my grandmothers had more flavor. Either way, it's bound to be a family favorite. Thank you for sharing!

Not bad, but the suggestion to pair a rice dish with mashed potatoes is straight from the Carbohydrate Crazy House!

This was a tasty meal that I want to make again. I followed some suggestions from other reviewers as well. I only used one green pepper which I split in half and microwaved cut side down for 3 minutes. That eliminated the boiling, and I would cut that time down to 2  1/2 minutes. I cooked the rice first before adding it to the meat mixture. I also added minced garlic to the ground beef.  Since the rice was cooked, I only simmered the meat mixture and rice for about 5 minutes, adding a little bouillon instead of water before putting it in the peppers. I  covered them with shredded cheese.  I didn't have tomato soup so I used picante sauce. I made extra rice and meat mixture, which I put in with the peppers in the oven for 30 minutes at 350.  Next time I would add more cheese and sauce.

I made a couple changes based on tastes in my houshold. added mushrooms and half can of tomatoes to the meat and halved the rice with bread crumbs (made 9 with 3lbs of meat).. Made hole in middle of meat after in pepers with fat straw so tomato juice could enter meat. bated every 20 mins lightly with fresh tomato juice.

Made as directed with exception of substitute red peppers for green.  The stuffing turned out on the soft side - but the still tasting good.

I have never made stuffed peppers before and these were delicious! In the future, I may leave off the tomato soup as I really didn't care for it (though usually I love tomato soup).  I may try to cut the peppers in half length wise next time, to get two servings per pepper.

Very good recipe! I am not a fan of tomatoes so I used rotel and some tomato soup rather than whole tomatoes. I also added brown sugar to the soup I added on top.  Must have worked well as my family is miserable from eating so much!

How this recipe got good reviews I can't figure out. I made this strictly by the instructions and I swear it was the worst recipe I have ever tried. The only deviation I did was using only 1 can of soup rather than 2. But really, If you're into crunchy rice and tomato soupy sauce, then this recipe is for you! Awful!

Made this with ground elk since thats what I had on hand. The only thing I did different was to layer cheese in the bottom of the pepper, then I filled the pepper halfway with the ground elk, layered more cheese and soup tomato soup, then filled the pepper to the top, then more cheese and soup. Turned out great!!

Wonderful recipe!  I did however make a couple changes. Instead of the soup, I mixed a 28oz can tomato sauce with 1/4 cup white vinegar, and poured that over the peppers in the pan. Oh and I cooked the rice before hand. It was delicious!

Found a good recipe my whole family LOVED!  The only thing I changed (because my teen son doesn't like them) was to leave out the tomatoes.  Instead, I added a little bit of the tomato SOUP to the ground beef mixture.  So glad I tried this recipe!

I made this as written and there are some issues. First, it was bland. Second, tomato soup alone is not quite right-needs tomato sauce/seasonings. Third, regular rice will NOT get done by simmering 15 min then baking. Ours was crunchy & I made exactly as written, using long grain regular rice.  Made exactly as submitted here, I give it a 2.

This is a very good stuffed pepper recipe.  I added a little red pepper flakes as I do with a lot of recipes.  It is pretty healthy and easy to make also.

Great simple recipe, reheats very well.  The only change I made was to add a teaspoon of ground nutmeg. The nutmeg really adds to savory dishes if used sparingly.

Easy recipe. I used Italian sausage instead of hamburger and decreased the amount of tomato. I didn't precook the green peppers because we like our peppers crispy. Great flavor.

Outstanding!! I added a little cheese in the bottom of the peppers to give the beef mixture a little "bed" to bake in. Then I did 1/2 beef mixture, then tomato sauce, then another 1/2 beef mixture and then topped it off with tomato sauce.  Delicious!! Just how my Mom use to make them.

I did not cook the meat or rice beforehand.  Mixture had no flavor so I will definitely add seasonings next time.  Came out good but will be better with seasonings.  Will make again.

I modified the times a bit. I spent less time on the stove and less time in the oven, and I also didn't pre-soak the peppers. I grew up with fresh, crunchy peppers and stuck with what I knew. Otherwise a very excellent recipe.

I used a can of petite diced tomatoes instead of the whole tomatoes. Also I only used one can of tomato soup. The last time I didn't have soup and used about a cup of prego left over from another recipe. Very good. My regular stuffed pepper recipe the hamburger is not cooked first. This is a nice change.

This was excellent! It's definitely a keeper. As suggested by others, I used beef broth instead of water and added garlic when browning the beef and onions. Other than that, i followed the recipe.

The filling in this recipe lends itself to all kinds of variations.  This is a good basic recipe.  I cut the recipe in half, as I only had 3 peppers.  I'm glad the peppers were blanched, and the ingredients precooked, as that made the baking time necessary only to warm all of the peppers  to the right temperature to sit down and eat to a hot, but not too hot, supper.  I did not salt the peppers after blanching, as there is a low salt diet family member.  We salt the food on our plates instead.  I added 1 C freshly cooked rice (cuts down on prep time), and a pint of home canned whole tomatoes.  Because the tomatoes were home canned, I did not need to add the 1/2 c of water, and I added the juice from the canned tomatoes to the bottom of the dish under the peppers.

It took me a lot longer than the advertised time to make this recipe. I'm glad I started on it early in the afternoon. I didn't like the tomato soup poured over the top--and I don't know why the recipe calls for 2 cans of condensed soup, when one can is probably more than enough. I will make this recipe again, but will try spaghetti sauce instead of tomato soup.

Just made a couple of changes: I used only one can of condensed tomato soup (and it was still way more than it needed) and skipped the step of boiling the peppers first.

Next time I'll try making it with crumbled spicy sausage, or add a couple of other seasonings that folks on here recommend, but it was a great main dish. Served it with a bag of sweet kale chopped salad and a hard cider.

This was a wonderful recipe, so delicious. I added two cups of chopped cabbage. That made a huge difference. I also added more cheese...one cup is not nearly enough.

Skipped tomatoes and tomato soup and water.  Mainly because I had a bunch of tomato juice I needed to use so I just added it to the meat and rice while it was cooking. Also used garlic salt. Super easy and delicious!

Made these tonight and LOVED them! The tomato soup addition was awesome! The only tweak I did was add oregano, basil and I used beef broth as opposed to water in the soup as well as the mix. Tender peppers and great creamy flavor with the soup addition!

Excellent!  Comfort food at it's finest.  The kitchen smelled wonderful as it baked.  I didn't change a thing and followed the recipe precisely.  Only out of curiosity, I might skip boiling the green peppers next time since I suspect doing this will allow the meat/rice/cheese mixture to absorb even more of the green pepper flavor, which could make it even yummier?  I only use the green pepper as a shell and don't eat it (love the taste but not the texture)...so a firmer green pepper doesn't make any difference to me.

This was excellent.  I haven't had a stuffed pepper in since I was little and I didn't care for them much then, but the husband wanted to try them again so I gave it a shot.  We followed the recipe as stated except for a few additions.  I added garlic to the meat mixture, used beef broth instead of water, and added a squirt of liquid smoke.  I also only used 1 can of tomato soup.  Loved the flavor, they tasted fabulous.  Will definitely make them again.

This was great!  the only changes that I made were to use Chicken stock instead of water and the 4 cheese Mexican blend instead of cheddar.  Next time I'd not use the store brand tomato soup as it was too sweet.  Very good though!

Because i adjusted few things I could not star it higher then 3, I used this as a base recipe and changed things accordingly to our family liking etc.  I used the tops of the peppers (cut off the stems) as a "hat" :) for the peppers, I cooked rice in a separate dish as I wanted to have extra rice for us to have on the side, and it speeded up the overall cooking of the peppers too ...i added garlic and sauteed with onion when meat was almost done, and added a taco seasoning for more taste ...i did not add worchester sauce or the tomato soup- i only used the can of cut tomatos- I only made 4 peppers and the rest of the mixed meat/rice /tomatos I put on the bottom on my dish where i put the peppers- and did all on the top stove .... finished with some mozzarella pieces ( photos posted)

This was actually much better then I thought it would be. I was worried it might be bland, but not at all! In think adding the cheese to the mixture was the trick, d'lish! Thanks for a great recipe!

Great recipe! Made a few changes to save time and to add a little extra flavor. I used cooked Ready Rice chicken flavor rice and omitted the water. Only heated through so not to dry out the meat and rice mixture. Also used diced tomatoes instead of cutting up whole. I only had to use one can of tomato soup and I seasoned it with salt, pepper, garlic and a little bit of Italian seasoning. After pouring on the soup I put extra cheese on Top of each pepper. Super yummy!!

If you have time to cook or slow cooker, I recommend a different approach. It is rather flavorless, plus I agree with some other reviewers for prep. Why I didn't like this recipe:  not much taste, meat mixture like crumbles, save oven time, but not prep. In short, my old recipe calls for uncooked meat, par boiled rice, a little bacon, egg, tomatoes, onion, some chopped green pepper. I usually cook onion, green pepper, then add to rest with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Obviously cooking time extended to cook raw peppers and raw meat. Sauce I use paste or sauce with added garlic powder, salt, pepper, sugar, basil and water if I used paste. Always serve with mashed potatoes and make sure to make extra sauce for them!

This dish was very  bland with only pepper and onion for taste. The little Worcestershire sauce does nothing. Next time I'll try pepper flakes , add mushrooms to the mix or maybe try spaghetti sauce instead of tomato soup.

Simply wonderful.  I've substituted spicy Italian pork for beef as someone suggested, and diced tomatoes.  I then layer the ingredients in the peppers (also suggested), and the whole family is happy with the outcome.  I think I'll try cornbread as a side sometime.  Suggestions for sides welcome!

Read all reviews before you make this. This recipe alone is NOT 5 stars. Mist reviewers have changed many things about the recipe & still give it 5 stars. I made it exactly as described & it was a disaster. Rice was not cooked and the stuffing for peppers was soupy & more like chili than anything else. It's just not worth all the hassle when I could make something had I know will turn out well. Will not be trying again.

Very good and easy stuffed peppers recipe. The tomato soup makes the red sauce a little acidic so I used half tomato soup and half ketchup.

very good. I added a clove of garlic to my recipe. I might actually add like a quarter cup more rice next time so I can really fill up my peppers.

I'm giving this recipe a 4 because I changed some stuff to what I had available in my pantry. I par boiled the peppers before stuffing them, I also added crushed tomatoes bc thats what I had on hand, added some bell peppers to the stuffing mixture and used leftover white rice I had from the night before.  Also I put some cheese on top too before putting them in the oven, served these with a side salad it was a hit even my 18 month old ate some and really enjoyed it. Will definitely make again this time with all the ingredients needed. Thanks. :-)

Delicious!  Here's how I made them: browned the beef with the onion and maybe  1 1/2 teaspoon of jarred minced garlic.  I used a can of diced tomatoes with Italian seasonings, and used the entire can without draining.  I also substituted chicken broth for the water.  I also used lightly less rice.  For the peppers, I used 1 1/2 green (used a leftover half green), 1 red, 1 orange and 1 yellow.  When I constructed the peppers, I sprinkled salt at the bottom, put shredded cheese, then meat mixture, then spooned tomato sauce, then added more meat mixture and finally topped with more cheese.  Baked for 25 minutes and they were perfect!!  They were slightly over filled, so another half pepper would have been perfect (i.e., need to use 5 altogether).

These were great! The only reason I rated 4 stars instead of 5 is because I used shrimp instead of the beef, since that is what I had on hand. I chopped shrimp in 3-4 pieces, sauteed in the pan with onion & added minced garlic. I used a can of diced tomatoes with liquid and added left over Spanish rice --so I left out the water. My son loved this and licked his plate clean. Will be making this again. Thanks for sharing!

Based on reading, and knowing my own personal tastes, I also added some Italian seasoning and garlic.  I think next time I'd opt for a mozzarella cheese rather than cheddar, too.  I've never eaten stuffed peppers, so I have no basis for comparison.  My husband said he liked it, but I have a feeling it was more thanks to the effort I put in.  They were good, and I'd try making them again, but I'd continue to experiment with the seasoning.  I definitely think boiling the peppers for a few minutes first is key.

Second time I made these, and they were just as good as the first time!  I've been searching for literally years for this recipe which was on a (I believe) Contadina tomato sauce can, long lost.  I used chunky marinara sauce and INSTANT rice (to prevent the crunchy rice syndrome) and did add a hair's worth of minced garlic & used sharp Cheddar cheese - - other than that, nothing was changed.  Great stuff, Maynard!!

Thisrecipe is just like my mom made for us growing up.  I had to reduce the recipe by half since there's only two of us.  I did not reduce the liquid ingredients and it came out perfectly.

As it states, this is an easy to make stuffed green pepper recipe. I give it 5 stars for that. If you want to read lower rated reviews keep in mind they're altering this recipe. As it is, it is a very delicious recipe. Yes you can add different things. I use my home-canned spaghetti sauce. This is a basic recipe and you can go many directions with it. Enjoy!

This was a good recipe. I substituted ground turkey for the hamburger because we are watching our fat intake. I also used a green pepper, a red, an orange and a yellow instead of all green and I did not par-boil them first. I sliced them long-ways in half, poured the soup base on the bottom of the dish, put the peppers in, salt & peppered them, stuffed and baked. I think next time I won't add the tomato soup base, we didn't like the taste with that, but the peppers and meat mixture was great! Thanks!

This was a great recipe to serve my family. Even my four year old loved it. After dinner, I thought this recipe would be even better with cooked pieces of bacon in it. The flavor profile would take this recipe to an all new level!

I made this recipe just as written.  It was yumm-o.  I would decrease the salt, however, as it was a tad salty for my taste.  But that's something easily controllable!

This was pretty good!
I chopped up some bratwurst in my food processor and added it to the ground beef. In lieu of the the chopped tomatoes and tomato soup, I used cans of tomato sauce. I also followed other reviewers and added beef bullion.

Like another review, I also but the cheese on top (cuz I screwed up- but in a good way!) and happened to mix craft parm into the beef mixture because that's how my mom did it. My father always loved my moms stuffed peppers and my nana used to always make her American chopped suey w/ tomato soup so this was a perfect blend of both my matriarchs.

I made with ground turkey, and wild rice, added garlic, and used tomato sauce instead of soup. These were great, will make again, make sure you season the insides of the peppers before stuffing.

I was pleasantly surprised when my children gobbled up their stuffed peppers. The only changes I made were I used multiple colored bell peppers, I used marinara sauce instead of soup because that was all I had and I added some minced garlic. Will for sure be making this again for my kids.

Everyone loves when I make this recipe.  I make it at home probably twice a month and my family loves it. When you have to help out another family who is sick or grieving this is a great thing to bring because it is easy, fast, travels well and everyone loves it. My secret is that I use red, yellow and orange peppers instead of green because they are less bitter.  This is tried and true and a keeper made exactly according to recipe except for colored peppers.

I made it with quinoa instead. Used 1/2 cup of chopped onion and 1 cup quinoa. Adds chopped tomatoes and mushrooms. Turned out wonderful!

Yummy. I used cooked rice and omitted the extra water. Also used diced tomatoes with jalapeño as another reviewer suggested. Thank you for the great recipe.

I also cooked raw rice separately to make sure they were fully cooked. I hate crunchy rice.   It is very important to Par-Boil a full 5 minutes if you stuff the whole pepper.  I did not like the idea of Tomato Soup so I used about a cup or more of canned crushed tomatoes in bottom of dish and it was a great sauce to add to peppers after cooking.  Yes, add some sauteed onion and minced garlic!  These are great and can be refrigerated and heated in micro later.  I make 6, eat 2 and devour the others later.  Have not tried freezing but will.

Very yummy food, anyone can fake this one.
I used 1 can nacho cheese soup instead of tomato, jasmine rice & a little hot sauce, the dog & I love it. I made it in a deep cast iron skillet & moved to oven with 2 peppers in the middle with mozzarella cheese sprinkled on top.

I crushed up one beef cube and cooked with the meat and onions , added 2 minced garlic cloves and a little more pepper. Also used red peppers instead of green peppers.  Turned out excellent!! Very filling and delicious, made garlic mashed potatoes for a side, goes well with the tomato soup gravy!!! Great!

I thought this was great, and the cheddar cheese adds terrific flavor and it smells wonderful while it's cooking. The only thing I changed really was using a can of already diced tomatoes instead of the whole tomatoes. This threw the liquid to rice ratio off a little and the peppers were a bit soupy. So I would say to adjust this just add a bit more rice or try to drain off a little bit of the liquid if you use pre-diced tomatoes. I've already made this twice! Love this recipe!

This recipe was wonderful I did make a few changes I doubled up my hamburger meat and I also use turkey burger instead of beef hamburger also I added one cup of rice instead of a half a cup of rice and I also used two cans of diced tomatoes also I didn't use the tomato soup at the end I also added more cheese on the top of the bell peppers and they came out wonderful. And I used twelve bell peppers instead of six I have a big family. the recipe was awesome and I would definitely make again

I made this recipe for dinner last night. I did not have any condensed tomato soup, but did have an extra can of diced tomatoes. I boiled a can of diced tomatoes with 1 oz. diced onion, 0.5 oz. carrots, 0.5 oz. of celery, water and a clove of garlic, plus italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Once all vegetables were tender, I blended this smooth. I used half a pound of breakfast sausage (because I needed to get rid of it) and a half pound of ground beef. I did boil the peppers as directed, then salted them inside lightly and added about a tablespoon of cheese after boiling. Meat and onions plus salt and pepper were cooked together and drained. Then, I added the salt and pepper, diced tomatoes, half the soup, rice, meat/onions, Worcestershire, 1 Tbsp Italian seasoning, a spoon of minced garlic, a little extra oregano and basil, and water to the pan and simmered until rice was tender. Spooned this immediately into peppers. Topped them with the rest of the soup and cheese. Baked them at 350F for 25 minutes and they were PERFECT! Will definitely make again.

I've made this dish quite a few times and it's very good and easy to make.  I've tried changing up the cheeses because it doesn't designate a cheese to use but all have been good.  The only other change I made was adding 1 TBSP instead of TSP of Worchestshire sauce.   My husband loves this meal.

Love the recipe only whenever I make my stuffed peppers I don't cook the ground beef ahead of time. Nor do I boil the peppers. I cook the rice and mix it in with the ground beef and all other seasonings and bake for 1 hour covered and 15 minutes uncovered. The peppers are done and so is the ground beef...yummy....

This was alright.  I added a lot of ingredients because it was bland.  I doubled the Worcestershire sauce, used a can of spicy crushed tomato instead of water. I added fresh mushrooms chopped, one whole yellow onion chopped. I also sauteed the beef with seasoning salt and pepper.  Added crumbles of feta to the beef.  All the other ingredients stayed the same.  Turned out so tasty and not bland like most stuffed pepper recipes.

So good! 4 out of 5 stars because it involved a lot of pans. We added more cheddar on top when serving. Leftovers were maybe even better! For leftovers we sprinkled red pepper flakes on it and loved it! I love that it's low carb, which is why I tried it to begin with.

This is a keeper!  So delicious.  I actually make it without pre-boiling the peppers, and it still turns out great.  I also add a bit of garlic powder to the meat mixture, and sprinkle some garlic powder and seasoning salt on top of the sauce before baking.  I have tried this recipe with ground pork and ground turkey (as well as the ground beef) and it turns out deliciously either way.

I screwed up and only had half the green peppers I needed for the dish! So I boiled like in the recipe then cut them up and mixed them in ! Followed up with the tomato soup on the top and baked! Spanish rice?! Yes it was delicious!

I've tried this recipe a few times, both the original and with recommended changes. The tomato taste was just too overwhelming. While I like them, they still haven't wowed me.

Modified  recipe by using  1 cup rice , 1 cup water, 28 oz petite diced tomatoes,  Dale  steak sauce, chicken bouilleon,1 whole onion, pizza  seasoning, cut up bell pepper  lids and added to meat mixture, used 8 bell peppers. In place of what the recipe called for everything else I just went by the recipe .For the last step  used water, dales (1 TEASPOON ) AND 1/2 can of diced tomatoes. (I didn't  have any tomato  soup. Smells divine....cooking in oven now.

I love these peppers. In fact, this is the only way that cooked green peppers will even make it on to my plate. I have made them several times and have tried some of the variations that other reviewers have shared. But, they are little changes, like adding some sauce mid-way through stuffing the peppers, or cutting the peppers lengthwise instead of  topping them, or baking them a little longer for temperature. 

I prefer them upright, as in the recipe. I'm very picky at the pepper bin at the grocery store and am sure to select only fruits with four even lobes so that they won't fall over in the cooking dish.  And I do add some sauce halfway through stuffing.

But, ingredients-wise, I wouldn't change a thing. The tomato soup is genius. They are just the right amount of sweet and savory. I would eat these a lot more often if I didn't think my husband would get bored.

A good basic recipe, but after I tasted it, it was a bit too bland for my taste. I added a few more teaspoons of Worcestershire and my favorite sausage seasonings: sage, oregano, basil and cumin, plus a dash of celery salt and cayenne. I sliced the peppers length-wise and also topped the stuffed peppers with extra cheese. MUCH better.

My husband and I loved this. I added garlic with the onions and rather than just spooning the tomato soup over the tops I also mixed it in. I also pulled the peppers out with about 5 mins left on the clock and added cheese over the top. I will make these again.

It has a good base, but looked like it needed to be tweeked a bit. I used 1/2 lb. burger, 1/2 lb. sausage. Also used flavored, long grain & wild rice, and topped it with Panko bread crumbs. Tried to submit a photo, but website is flawed.

I followed this recipe almost exactly except for using hot Rotel instead of regular diced tomatoes.  It tasted great with a nice burn.  Next time I'm going to use some of the suggestions in the comments to add more flavor.

I used all the same ingredients, I just boiled my green peppers a few minutes longer and added a little more of the worcestershire sauce and it was my first time. They turned out GREAT & TASTY!
P.s. My 7yrs old stepson even ate one.

I added a little cumin and chili powder to the beef. I also used instant brown rice and added it in at the final stage of the browning of the beef, omitting the water. Great recipe.

I loved it& so did my husband. He's from the south and never had anything like that before and had never even heard of it before. I added a bit more rice and I used a quart jar of tomatoes I'd canned from last year. I also put more onion than called for and used minced garlic and more Italian seasonings. The only other change was i used ground venison. It was excellent! My sister loved it also.

I've made these a few times! I love this recipe! I followed this recipe but added a can of corn, one 4oz can of diced green chilis (hot), and used petite diced tomatoes instead of whole. I add one can of water to the condensed tomato soup. Simmered the mixture for 20 minutes. Baked them for 30 minutes! Perfect!

I make this twice a month and I have found that you need to cook the rice longer than the suggested time or it is crunchy and dry, I add a couple more TBs of Worcestershire sauce, I only make 4 peppers cause I only cook for 2 people, sometimes I use spaghetti sauce in place of the tomato sauce and whole tomatoes, also i put a layer of sauce in the bottom and top to make it more moist and add extra cheese for perfection. :]

I made this and the taste of everything was pretty good. The only complaint I have is that it seemed like to much tomato soup and it made it somewhat soupy.

I made this for my husband and I and it is amazing!  Very delicious and provided a lot of leftovers, one stuffed green pepper filled us each up.  I followed the recipe exactly, no changes necessary!  Thank you for this recipe, I will be making it again and again!

I loved this but I did make some changes. I added all of the ingredients to the meat and rice and let it simmer. I did leave out the extra can of tomato sauce. It makes plenty and you don't need to waste a second can. I added minced garlic, Italian spices, Hot sauce, and extra Worcestershire sauce. I made mine with brown rice so it took quite a bit extra time to let the rice soften; but I put all the juice in from the chopped tomatoes. This turned out AMAZING

I doubled the receipe and used 1 lb. of italian sausage and 1 lb. of 93% lean ground beef.  I also used red peppers instead of green.  I stuffed a dozen peppers and will freeze half of them for another night.

Never had these before and it was delicious!  My boyfriend loved them too and raved over them!  I did the simple changes as mentioned, i.e., added two cloves of garlic to the hamburger and onion when browning; used beef broth instead of water, used canned tomatoes with chilis to add more flavor; and extra Worchestershire sauce.  One more thing...I used Prego Heart Smart spaghetti sauce instead of soup.  I filled the peppers half way, added some sauce and finished filling them and topped them with sauce and cheese.

I've made this recipe regularly over the last 3 years. I  have tried many suggestions listed from reviewers and some of my own experiments to see if I could improve on an already wonderful base recipe.  I think I've found the best combination to make a very savory dish.  I added 2 tsp of minced garlic to the meat and onion during cooking.  I increased the Worcestershire Sauce to 3 tsp.  I doubled the rice and cooked it separately adding 1 tsp Oregano, 1 bay leaf, and 1 beef bouillon cube.  The original recipe seemed to be short on stuffing, so the added rice really bulked it up.  Instead of tomato soup (which is good also), I tried both Spaghetti sauce and tomato sauce with added Oregano and garlic, and both were fantastic.  I like putting a little sauce inside the pepper before adding the stuffing to meld that flavors through the mixture.  I like to serve it with cornbread, the sweet and savory go so well together.

Delicious, but we made two slight changes. I used diced tomatoes and added half a can of the tomato soup to the ground beef and rice while it cooked.

I wanted this to be good but it just wasn't. The meat was very bland (even though I added garlic and Italian Seasoning) and the tomato soup topping totally overwhelmed the peppers.

I'm giving this recipe four stars because I thought it was really good. I followed the instructions to a T but, realized that it needed a little help. I prefer more rice than it called for so, I made a second half cup of rice on the side and added it to the filling once everything was ready to go. Also, the uncooked rice wasn't tender after simmering for 15 minutes. I added a bit more water and simmered it for another 5 minutes. The flavor was great! I wouldn't add anything as far as spices or flavors go. Thanks for the share! I'll definitely make this again.

This is a great recipe and my family loved it! However the rice was a bit chewy, so next time I will cook the rice first or use minute rice. (I even cooked it longer than the recipe called for) I also used ground turkey instead of ground beef, and no one even noticed! This was simple and delicious!!

I really enjoyed these peppers! I did make some modifications. I listened to other reviewers by buying diced tomatoes and using the sauce in the meat. I also had to cook the meat with the rice about 30 minutes because the rice was still hard. I put extra cheese because my husband thought one cup wasn't enough. I would say to add fresh minced garlic, about 3-4 cloves to add some seasoning to it. All in all a great dish!!

I loved this recipe but I modified it a tad bit. I forgot to get tomato soup so I made my own tomato sauce I used two Roma tomatoes diced and a quarter of a onion and a block of caldo de pollo seasoning a garlic clove salt a little water blended all together then when I was adding it to the peppers I put cheese first then my tomato sauce some beef mixture half way more sauce and cheese beef mixture to the top then added the rest of my tomato sauce and topped it with cheese. Yummy!

These were really good - used 3 tsp of Worcestershire,  beef broth instead of water in the rice and cooked it separately. My husband thought it needed tweaking - more spices and he said it was a little too "heavy." I felt like it was really good comfort food and *slightly* healthier than mac and cheese. Will definitely try again. Thanks for a great basis!

The family loved it! I used diced tomatoes with chiles and that spices it up a bit. I also used Beef broth instead of water. The only change I would make for next time is that I would boil the peppers for less time, maybe 3 minutes instead of 5. Yum!

These really were a hit. I have 4 boys who  never tried them before.  There were no left overs.  I didn't have worcerstershire so i used zip sauce,  4 tbls. but i also used 3 lbs of meat and 8 peppers.  I used cooked rice too I used the soup and tomatoes and 1/2 can beef broth. cooked with peppers.  Thickened it at end with cornstarch, poured over peppers. WOW!  they were great, thanks foe sharing.

Very good! I always look at the first three reviews. All are helpful. My husband and 12 year old daughter loved this; my 9 year old son liked the stuffing, but not the pepper. My husband had made stuffed peppers before, but said these were way better! Enjoy!!!

Great recipe! I added a pinch of basil and garlic to the mixture. I added dried onion and a beef boullion cube to the gravy. And I did not boil the green peppers...never have...turned out fine by me.

Sliced peppers in half top to bottom, which gives two halves that can be used. For filling: added a bay leaf, a few fennel seeds, and replaced salt with a cube of Knorr-Swiss beef bouillon. Also melted additional cheese on top before serving. Family loves it!

Made according to directions. I liked but didn't love. Will not make again. Needed to add more cheese and salt. Maybe more Worcestershire sauce would have helped. Maybe I'm just not stuffed pepper kind of girl.

Very good, however....one can of soup is ample and next time will fill 1/2 the pepper with meat filling, pour some soup over so it will soak all the way through then finish filling pepper otherwise will just sit on the top.  Used turkey instead.  Will definitely make again.  Thank you.

These peppers reminded me of my mother's stuffed peppers from when I was a child. They are delicious! I actually added more onion to mine because I love onion and it was a hit with the whole family. Worth a try :)

We love stuffed peppers every couple of months. This is a great recipe and I  only changed a few things as to what I had on hand. Chopped the pepper tops fine and put them in beef with chopped onion and 2 cloves chopped garlic. Wish I had done what another reviewer said about always cooking rice first; I knew that but it turned out okay since I had extra sauce and cooked a bit longer. I had no tomato soup on hand( I know unbelievable) so used chunky pasta sauce plus one small can of tomato sauce. Results were great. Loved the cheese, who wouldn't? Thanks

Very yummy! Just what I was looking for. I didn't stray far from the original recipe, except for adding 2 minces garlic cloves when browning the meat and onions, and using stewed tomatoes (chopped) instead of the whole tomatoes in the meat mixture (definitely recommend this). I topped the peppers with more cheese before baking them. I think the author of the recipe meant for this, as baking "until cheese is melty and bubbly" was mentioned.

I substituted a can of black beans for the meat to make it vegetarian, added vegetarian chicken broth powder to water for rice (cooked rice separately), sauteed minced garlic with the onion, added basil, oregano, dash of cayenne. Used 1 can of diced tomatoes with juice. Skipped the soup & Worcestershire. My husband loved it!

Love this recipe!! It is a big one in our house. Only gave it 4 stars because had to make some changes after reading some reviews. I cut the tops off the peppers and boil them for 3-4 minutes, after that I put some seasoning and cheese at the bottom of the peppers. While browning the meat I add a lot of basil, oregano,  italian seasoning and galic salt. After I drain the meat (which you don't really have to do cause it isn't that greasy depending on the percentage you use) I will add more seasoning while it simmers. I buy the canned diced tomatoes with basil,garlic and oregano already in them. After simmering, ill sometimes add a few dashes of Frank's red hot to spice it up a bit. I add the cheese while it is still warm so its gooey and melted. Only one can of soup is really needed, and sometimes I water it down and other times I don't.  Not a huge fan of tomato soup so I really only use half the can when its watered down. 
This really is a awesome recipe, just can come out a bit bland and needs a little hit :)

Very easy to do and tastes great. I used sodium free tomato soup and canned tomato's, which I think took away from the savoury flavour, but overall very good and hearty.

After reading the reviews I decided to spice the peppers up. Instead of diced tomatoe I used Ro-tel 
medium tomatoes. They come in 10 oz cans so used 2 cans and measured out the 14.50 oz needed and used the rest in the tomato soup . My husband loved it.  Gale

Just finished devouring these.  I altered it a little.  I minced a clove or garlic and added it along with some garlic powder, oregano, and basil to the meat mixture.  I also added a small can of tomato paste, oregano, and basil to the soup mixture.  I used red and yellow bell peppers and sprinkled extra cheddar on top of them for the last stage of cooking (maybe last 5 minutes or so).   Stuffing was a little wet, but man was it tasty.

I cut the peppers in half and added shredded cheese for the top at the last five minutes. Everybody loved, wish they had more kick to it soo I added hot sauce. I used microwave rice, that only takes 70 seconds to heat and then I mix everything together, so fast and easy. Thanks for sharing!!!!

Good suggestions for changes.  My changes were to mince up the tops of the peppers and add to ground beef to brown.  Also, add uncooked rice to ground beef when browning , it will make it very flavorful and tender.

Ok, let me start by saying that I only made 3 peppers knowing that I would be the only one in my house that would eat these. I have offered to make them for my husband before and he would always tell me that he doesn't like them. So I tried asked him again and he said no..I don't like them. So I made this recipe exactly as instructed and ran out for a bit and came home to find two out of the three peppers gone! My husband looked at me and said that he owes me an apology because they were one of the best things he ever ate! Needless to say, I will have to make this recipe again. Thanks for such a great recipe!

Omg. These are great. My garden gave me lots of huge peppers and last week I made stuffed peppers. I tried to make them like my mom use to make but  over the years forgotten how so I muddled through. They weren't bad but wow these are exactly what I remember as a child. I made 6 huge ones and froze 4 for next times. !!

Because my boys are always bringing friends home to eat, I've had to stretch a recipe quite often.  Just add a can of corn to your filling, and a little extra Worcestershire sauce.  I've found over the years that when it is hot and I don't want to turn the oven on, I cut my peppers in half length wise, place them cut side down in a microwaveable casserole, with just a tiny bit of water.  Microwave for about 2 minutes, covered, turn them over, fill with mixture, top with sauce and cheese, and cook in microwave for about 10 minutes.  Quick and delicious.

I liked the idea of  peppers stuffed with"loose" meat rather than a meatloaf type filliing and so will give these a try soon.  So, my ratinig is based on the concept, not experience.  I plan to make the following changes:  red peppers instead of green, diced tomatoes, addition of garlic, addition of red pepper flakes, topping with Old Fashioned Tomato Rice Soup and 1/2 cup of cream, (which is what I have used for "meatloaf" stuffed pepper.  The sweetness of this soup combined with the cream is the perfect sauce to accompany the baked peppers.

Followed recipe exactly except added a bit of garlic. Overall I was worried it'll be bland and just not as good as our old family recipe.... My kids LOVED it! It's hard to get my 7 y.o. To eat anything and between him and his friend they ate 3!!! He asks me to make at least once a week.

This recipe is SOOOOO good. I made a couple of changes. I do not like green peppers, so I used yellow for a sweeter flavor. I forgot to buy more Worcestershire at the store and didn't want to go back, so I used A1 steak sauce instead. Did I mention that these are SOOOOO good?

I love this recipe! My husband is trying to eat healthier. So I tried it with quinoa instead of rice and I left out the cheese. I also added some garlic. Because everyone loves garlic. If you are not on a diet keep the cheese in.

These came out really great! I assembled them at night and just popped them in the oven to bake after work the next day. I had to improvise on the rice step since I used brown rice. I just doubled the water and let it cook covered for an extra 15 minutes. Also, I think next time I'll use a regular tomato sauce instead of the tomato soup. Just a taste preference. But this was a solid recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I had frozen rice onhand so I threw that in with the browning ground beef...  I needed fewer servings so only used 1 can of tomato soup.  I filled peppers halfway, sprinkled parmesean cheese then added more stuffing then topped with cheddar cheese.  My husband liked it, but next time I'll slice the peppers in half vs stuffing a standing pepper.

Kids even ate this one! Used 4 peppers, turkey instead of beef, v8 juice (low sodium) instead of soup, quinoa instead of rice(have to cook before adding to pan) and halved the cheese....very tastey.

After reading the reviews I made adjustments here and there.  Definitely used minute rice product as I have always experienced under cooked rice.  Added seasonings to our liking.  This turned out great.  Family loved it.

Delicious! I usually cook for just me, so I cut down the recipe to only make 2 peppers. I added more rice and used one red and one orange pepper instead of green. The tomato soup on top flavors it lovely! Great recipe.

We really enjoyed this dish! It was very easy, just boil and brown meat, and then add everything together, pretty foolproof! I also used beef broth instead of water, and I did use Minute rice, which I think would solve others' problem of the rice not being done, because mine was perfect. The peppers were done perfectly, still firm and not soggy, even after baking. Great recipe!

I don't like green bell peppers...so I always use red/yellow/orange variety. It really adds the perfect sweetness to stuffed peppers. We are eating healthy, so we used ground turkey instead of ground beef and quinoa instead of rice.  I also added a couple links of Sweet Italian Turkey Sausage for flavor because I usually gook with Italian sausage rather than ground beef when I'm not eating healthy.  ;-)  Also...I doubled the Worcestershire and added garlic and Italian seasoning to the meat mixture.  I always put balsamic into my tomato sauce before I poured it over the peppers.  I made this in the slow-cooker and therefore did not cook the meat or peppers before hand.  Perhaps I should just create a new recipe...stay tuned...

Love this recipe.  Simple and easy to make.  Only substitution I make is that I use a good spagetti sauce instead of tomato soup.  Not a fan of the bland soup on top, but with this change it tastes amazing (to me)

I used Morningstar Veggie Crumbles to make it vegetarian.  Also used brown rice and a can of diced tomatoes. Came out amazing.  This was such a simple meal with things I had on hand.  Definitely the best stuffed peppers I have ever had and made!

I also changed the recipe a tad.  It is a great starting base recipe.  My changes included using red peppers, barley instead of rice (just felt like it) I used fresh frozen tomatoes from the garden. I also browned up some garlic (also from the garden) in olive oil then cooked the onions some. I also added an italian seasoning. Haven't eaten the cooked pepper yet - they are still baking. But the left over stuffing is Great!

I love the recipe; however and because I dont like soupy consistence,I would suggest to avoid the water or at least use as little as possible. The rest its great...you can play with some more onions or maybe red pepper flakes to add a little spicy touch.

This is the only way I make stuffed peppers and they are great.  Be careful not to overcook your peppers or they will be incredibly mushy after baking.

this recipe is a place to START from, its not complete on its own.   i felt it needed much more rice (only saw after baking the suggest others made about cooking rice separately;  i will pursue that next time)  and its lacking in ANY seasonings!  i suggest keeping some cheese for the top of the stuffing

Great recipe. I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and I also used crushed tomatoes which is easier than cutting it up. To make it a little healthier I also used reduced fat cheddar cheese. The kids also like it and that's a defiantly plus because they are not fans of veggies.

I really enjoy making these.  The only thing different I do is I only boil peppers in water for 2-3 minutes and then I add 1 can of tomato soup into the meat & rice mixture. Recipe is a go to for quick and easy dinner.

Really good recipe..made a few adjustments.  Used tomato sauce instead of tomato soup and cooked the tom sauce with the meat and rice filling.  Also added fresh garlic, dried basil, oregano, and parsley, chopped mushrooms and fresh tomatoes instead of canned to filling.  Cooked for 15 minutes in microwave instead of baking.

I followed the common suggestions as well such as adding extra worchestershire and layering the soup mixture half way up. I used a box of Spanish Rice a Roni and added the spice packet to the soup mixture with another dash of worchestershire and added a sprinkle of cheese on top. Couldn't have been better.

DELICIOUS!!!! My German-Dutch soul is so happy with this recipe. I only changed three things to this recipe. I added a Tbsp of Burgandy cooking wine (a staple to most of my red meat and tomato base dishes) & a liberal (to taste) sprinkling of garlic powder to my rice/meat mixture. I also used a pre-mixed 1# meatloaf mixture as a sub for ground beef. My rice was a half cup of brown rice and an add'l handful of Arborio rice halfway through the rice cook time. My frugal heart couldn't bear to throw out the entire tops of the green peppers, so I carefully sliced the usable pepper on the "lids" dicing them and adding them into the stuffing when I added the arborio rice. This will be a permanent addition to our favorite meals in this household. Thank you for sharing your recipe with us all :)

Love this dish. Used parboiled rice this time as the rice didn't fully cook the last 2 times I tried it. Worked much better, and am using ground chicken this time to cut down on fat & calories :) PS - not a fan of green peppers so I use red - they're a bit sweeter and add nice colour too.

These were great! The only thing I'd say is to boil/cook the rice before it is added to the meat mixture. Unless I missed something, it seems above to add uncooked rice to mixture and once tender then move to next step. I did that and the end result was the rice was not cooked. Other than that, it was delicious and I will cook the rice alone next time first! Thank you for great recipe! & used 2 cans of tomatoes/green chiles instead of the others.I am terrible with rice so I cook my rice in a rice cooker and add it to the pot to simmer covered for a few mins. So I omit the water and just cook my rice in rice cooker.

I followed Rouver's and Ink's changes, used a whole small onion, and used Sharp Cheddar and Mozzarella instead of all Cheddar cheese. I added 1 t dried Basil and 1t of dried Italian Seasoning. Parboiling the peppers mkes this a fork-tender recipe!
I was only able to get 5 peppers into my baking dish, but we got two meals out of this recipe, and still have leftovers.

I gave this four stars because I did what many others did and added basil, oregano, and garlic. I also used half the tomato soup. Next time I will also omit the cheese to make it a bit healthier. I'll also try it with some seasoned tomato sauce next time instead of the tomato soup. Overall a good recipe one can season to their tastes very easily. Definitely a keeper.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly as written, but close enough to give this 5 stars.  I added fresh garlic, precooked the rice and mixed in the shredded cheese before I stuffed the tomatoes.  Also like other reviewers suggested, I used diced tomatoes with jalapeño. My husband loved it, and so did I!

I am giving this recipe five stars when made with some adjustments and additions. First, I used over one pound of beef and only five peppers and had the perfect amount of filling. I added garlic as it was glaringly missing. I also put in some spices to the beef to kick it up (red pepper flakes, cumin). When I added in the cheese at the end I also threw in some sour cream to make the mix slightly creamier. After I poured the tomato sauce on top of the filled peppers I put more cheese on top and broiled the dish after baking to get a nice browned topping. They came out spicy and delicious! Peppers were cooked perfectly.

They were wonderful!   The onion and Worcestershire sauce I did double. I didn't have any tomato soup but found a can of Progresso Recipe Starters "Fire Roasted Tomato" Cooking sauce so I used it, this worked well.  At the end I added just a small amount of cheese to the top.  I did love it but it was missing something.  After I ate my first one, later when eating the second, I added some garlic powder after opening it up.  This did it.  I will make again but I'll add some garlic next time.

Good recipe. I changed a few of the ingredients as wel...added more cheese and Worcestershire sauce. I also didn't use the condensed tomatoe soup but added a little ketchup in the meat mix. I also cooked the rice before hand and added a little more seasoning (Season all, garlic and onion powder) to the meat.

Awesome! I boil my peppers for 5 minutes before I stuff them. Makes them more tender.

Iv had stuffed bell peppers before, these had a different flavor to em', but in a good way. I had a few additions though: a few cloves of minced garlic (depending on how much you like the garlic kick), a dash or two of oregano, 1/3 tsp of cayenne and topped each of the bell peppers with bread crumbs and freshly grated parmesan cheese.....pretty good recipe!

Followed the recipe except for three suggestions: (1) fill peppers halfway, add tomato soup, then continue to fill the pepper, (2) increase Worcestershire sauce, (3) use 5 peppers instead of 6.  I love that everything for the filling is done in one pan and the rice cooked beautifully.  I cooked the stuffed peppers in a stoneware Bundt pan - they stand nicely packed together.

This was a HUGE hit with my family.  I do not like to cook for the most part, but this was so easy I loved it. I used sharp cheddar cheese though - only because it was all I had.  Still D E L I C I O U S.  Will be making this one again.

I rarely find a recipe I dislike on allrecipes so this is unfortunate.  The stuffing was way too salty, the rice was hard, it took twice the prep time listed and the peppers definitely have to be medium or smaller for you to get that many servings from this stuffing.  What else can I say?  I followed the recipe meticulously and was very disappointed.  :(

I used a Zateran's rice mix to spice it up.  I used Italian sausage instead of g. beef. I added sliced mushrooms.  One tip was to slice the peppers lengthwise in half keeping the tops.  I loved it because they were easier to bake in a dish.  I also used the tip of tripling the Worcestershire sauce. We Loved it!!!

This is similar to my recipe however I use chicken gumbo soup instead of the rice. Stewed tomatoes and Velveeta cheese. After the pepper is filled half way I use a few cubed pieces of cheese and then added additional filling. We like the tops a little browned so I add a few more cubes of cheese and place under the broiler to melt. Yummy..

This recipe is awesome. I have had stuffed peppers before, but this one has a much better flavor and is quick. My husband loved it and he is the pickiest person I know! I used yellow peppers and jalapenos to spice it up. Thanks!

By mistake I added the tomato soup into the beef mixture with the tomato's.  This helped keep the beef mixture moist and it added wonderful flavor to the mixture.  I left a little to drizzle over the bell peppers for added flavor. Then towards the last five minutes I top the peppers with the cheese and allow it to melt. Overall the bell peppers are delicious.

I used this recipe because my mom said it was her favorite. I found it very bland and dry so I added 1 cup of tomato sauce and about 1 cup of salsa to meat mixture. That helped a lot. I then used the left over tomato sauce to the top because I didn't want to waste it. I also added chili powder. Without these changes it would have had no  flavor. I will go back to my recipe using raw peppers and not cooking the mixture, it's much faster and easier.

This recipe was delicious! I would make one change next time however. I will cook the rice by itself to make sure it is completely done. I used brown uncooked rice but next time I will use brown minute rice and add it into the mixture. I also used (4) 10.75 oz if tomato soup to make sure there was plenty of just to spoon on top. I will definitely make again with the minute rice adjustment!

I liked it but did make a few changes.  First, instead of Cheddar cheese I used Mezzarolla cheese; instead of can of whole peeled tomatoes I used a can of diced tomatoes and instead of tomatoe soup I used a jar of Prego traditional sauce.  My husband was sick with a cold and he cleaned his plate of stuffed pepper, baked potato and ear of corn.  With these changes, I give this recipe 5 stars.  Delicious!

Made this for the boyfriend and it has become one of our favorite things to eat.  Keep in mind, I never was a fan of bell peppers until this recipe.  Some tips: I prefer using red, yellow, and orange bell peppers; they give a sweeter taste.  Also, when browning the meat, I added some Italian seasoning, tripled the Worcestershire sauce, and added minced garlic. (or else the meat will be bland.) Cook the rice beforehand. With the tomato soup, skip adding water; it'll make it too runny.  Fill in the peppers halfway with the beef mixture. Add a bit of tomato sauce and fill up the rest with beef mixture and top with tomato sauce again. This will allow the soup to seep to the bottom and give more flavor. Using diced canned tomatoes saves time on chopping.

I love stuffed peppers and this has to be one of my favourite recipes. DELISH! I prefer red peppers so  used them as well.  I also always blanch my green peppers to avoid an after taste. I also bought diced tomatoes (skip the chopping the tomatoes step). Thanks for sharing!

Just used this recipe as my first try at cooking stuffed peppers and it was amazing! Did make some adjustments according to other users reviews - tripled the Worcestershire sauce, added oregano, a few pinches of cayenne for a little kick, minced garlic and used Uncle Ben's boil in a bag rice (which I think is always good!) also used 1.35lbs of ground beef with about 1&1/2 cups of the rice, and purchased pre-diced tomatoes. Paired the dish with corn, garlic bread and a caprese salad - delicious!!! My boyfriend was raving and even better - we have leftovers for tomorrow! This is a must make and will repeat!

We loved it!  I made a few changes mainly trimming it down for only two people but I also added some pork sausage to the beef and some Tobasco to the mixture while it was simmering.  I think next time I would add something spicier to the mix like jalapenos.  It went great with some roasted potatoes to soak up the extra juices!

These turned out good but I made few changes. Cut the peppers in half so they were easier to stuff. Also added fried some hot pork sausage with hamburger and used microwaveable pouch of Uncle Bens whole grain rice to save time.  It turned out really good!!

I have tried it and loved it. I didn't re-cook the peppers and have started using the yellow, red, orange bell peppers. I switched barley for the rice and like the added flavor and firmness of the barley.  I did use pre-cooked barley.

I give this recipe 4 stars since, like many others, I found that the rice does not cook sufficiently in 15 minutes. So I doubled the amount of water and Worcestershire and cooked about 20-25 minutes making sure the rice was done.  Also, after stuffing,  I cooked it about 40 minutes; 25 covered then 15 uncovered. All in all, I love this recipe; it tastes great!  Oh yeah, I also half my peppers in order to have leftovers...even better left over and reheated.

These were the best stuffed peppers I've ever had!  Per previous reviews, I cooked the rice separately adding a beef bouillon cube, added a tsp of Italian seasoning to the hamburger mixture, and used only one can of tomato soup.

Let me start by saying that I am a pretty terrible cook. I made this dish for a party and got rave reviews! Even overheard some asking others during the party if they've tried them yet. Simple to make - I highly recommend!

It was really good..but it could be a bit sweeter ( I have only had them at a local restaraunt before these and they are a bit sweeter. I too added extra Worchesershire sauce. I will make it again, but with the adjustment of just 1 can tomato soup and the diced tomatoes. I feel like it may taste good with marinara over it- so I will try that next time. :-] Thanks for the recipe!

I wish I could give this 5 stars, but it just wasn't a hit.  I did add diced peices from the tops I cut off into the stuffing.  It was good, but we ended up scooping out the filling and just eating that and the soup.

This recipe is FANTASTIC!!! I very much plan on making this again soon! It did, however, take me longer for the rice to get tender and it took a bit in the oven. I also put the oven on broil, put the tray onto the highest rack and let it crisp up for a minute.

I love this recipe, i usally make taco suffed peppers, but i have to say these were alot better. I did make a few changes, only added 1 can of tomato soup with equal parts water, add garlic powder, oregano, basil, italian seasoning, little extra worcestershire sauce, jalepenos and black beans. And instead of using can tomatos i used fresh tomatoes from the garden about 4, I blended 3 and diced the other. I also used jasmine rice. served with tortilla chips or homemade tortilla chip which ever u perfer.

Made these last night....FANTASTIC! I only used 1 can of condensed tomato soup, and i only used half of that(and added NO water) because I left a little room inside the peppers and poured it in there and put the cheese on top of that. Also, if you have a broiler, I broiled the tops for about 1 minute to make them crispy and cheesy...was delicious!

Delicious!  I was using very small bell peppers from my garden, so I used 14 instead of 6, and the stuffing amount worked out perfectly.  I also used chopped roma tomatoes from my garden in place of canned, and I used Campbell's "Harvest Orange" condensed tomato soup.  That gave it beautiful color and a great flavor.  This took me quite a bit longer than estimated in the recipe- a little over 2 hours until dinner was ready, but that wasn't too surprising given the extra prep of smaller peppers, the fresh tomatoes, and the fact that I'm just not a very fast cook.  When I have the time, the result was well worth the effort!

I will give this 5 stars because in my opinion it is a PERFECT base-recipe.  I've made it exactly as described by the original poster and tried several of the suggestions by those who rated it.  

I've found I can use this with all main ingredients and experiment with a variety of changes and/or additions...and it never fails to please everyone.

This turned out amazing! We followed the way on how to cook everything except the rice. We pre-cooked the rice because we where afraid that the rice wouldn't cook fully. We didn't add the cheese. But everything else we did the same and it was so tasty!! The Worcestershire sauce is a must! Thanks! Next time my mom is thinking of adding some garlic.

This is a lot of work to make, but definitely worth it! I made it with ground turkey instead of beef and added some extra chopped green pepper to the filling when browning the meat and onion.

This recipe was outstanding. My husband and I both loved it. Absolutely delicious and will certainly make it again and again I made a few alterations like adding tomatoes with chilies and adding 2 cloves of garlic, oregano and paprika. Even without these, this is a very flavorful dish. Yum.

I used regular stewed tomatoes (which I put in the food processor first) instead of the tomato soup.  It added a little bit of sweetness. Love stewed tomatoes!  I also used a mix of green peppers and banana peppers out of the garden.  Excellent recipe! :)

Loved it!  I increased the amount of diced tomatoes and used the chile flavored ones.  I precooked rice and added a half a jalepeno for some kick.  To make it a little healthier I used brown rice, lean beef, and low fat cheese.  It was delicious!

I love this recipe. Never made stuff bellpeppers before. I like fresh so instead of the can of tomatoes I used fresh tomatoes and also made my own tomato soup which was easy and quick. I also left out the cheese, just forgot it.

Delicious...Thank you Suzanne. My son requests these once per week. We use a couple each red, orange, and yellow peppers, and add a small can of diced jalepenos to the beef before browning for a little kick. A lot of the heat is lost when you drain the fat from the beef, but there is still a little kick left...Not too hot for my 11 year old.

These are the most delicious stuffed bell peppers I have ever had.  I took the advise of some of the other reviewers and used a pasta sauce in place of the soup; canned diced tomatoes with green chilies; pre-cooked brown rice in beef broth; added more Worcestershire sauce, onion, 4 cloves fresh garlic minced, and used 1-1/2 lbs. gr. beef (that's what I had); used jack cheese (that's what I had); greased the baking dish with shortening and didn't add liquid.  I also cut the peppers (red, yellow, orange and green) lengthwise, seeded them, and put 3 halves staggered on a microwave safe plate, then microwaved them for 4 minutes before stuffing.  I put a small slice of cheese inside the peppers before stuffing them and drizzled ketchup on top then put another slice of cheese on top before baking.  Everyone loved them.  Thank you Suzanne and thanks to the other reviews for their suggestions too!  This will be my go-to pepper recipe.  This filling stuffed 9 whole peppers.

PERFECT!!  This was so yummy.  The only change I made is that I added Italian Seasoning to the meat.  I also used 2 VERY large peppers instead of 6 ... so it made 4 cups and it was the perfect amount of meat in each pepper.  I also used diced tomatoes in the can ... less work than chopping them myself!

Very good recipe, made just a couple of changes: added 2 cloves of garlic while cooking the beef/onions.
As per a couple of reviews, I too used beef broth with the rice and also used some for thinning the soup.
Now the package of beef that I had was 1 1/2 lbs, so I increased the other ingredients proportionally, filled the 6 peppers and had just enough left over to stuff 2 hot banana peppers.
Great recipe, will surely be making these again.
Thanks Suzanne!

These are really good, but I normally use antelope meat, as it is low in fat, then add it to Spanish rice,  It is a fast recipe. 

Thanks for a new recipe.

Super yummy! I followed some suggestions from other reviews, extra Worcestershire, and I added garlic, also I put half the stuffing in peppers and put tomato soup in then the rest of the mixture on top. My husband suggested adding a breadcrumb topping which might be good as well. I will defiantly make this again. Even my kids liked it!

This is a good basic recipe.  I made it with ground turkey and added one can of Rotel tomatoes for a kick.  I also added one TBSP of Worcestershire sauce and cooked my rice.  It was really good.  Thanks Suzanne.

I tried this recipe for the 1st time and it came out perfect. Instead of using rice I used red beans and rice to give it some extra flavor, also I used Ragu sauce instead of the regular tomato sauce. I am ddefinitely going to do this again!

This was my first attempt at making green peppers.   I chose this recipe from this site due to the high reviews and it sounded like something I would like.   And it was!!!  The only changes I made were to decrease the rice to 1/3 cup and decrease the amount of cheese. (I don't like things too cheesy)   Will definitely make again.

Awsome!!! First time I have ever ate stuffed peppers and am going to add this to the monthly meals. The only things I did different was instead of just green peppers, I did also red and yellow. I did add garlic powder and everglades seasoning to the beef as it was cooking to add flavor to the bite of the beef mix. Other than that its GREAT!!!!!

This dish is awesome! I however cooked my rice then added it to the uncooked meat mixture. I then baked in the oven until meat was cooked. I did use tomato soup but added sour cream to it. When done I added a slice of mozzarella cheese on top. Yummmm!

This recipe was positively YUMMY and these were the best stuffed peppers I've ever made, and perhaps ever eaten.

I made only a minor substitution, using a can of diced tomatoes with chilies, to save on dicing time and give the recipe a little spicy kick.

Rarely have I used a recipe as directly (without lots of changes) as this one -- this one is pretty much perfect!

My husband and I have made this recipe twice and it's delicious!  However, we did make some large modifications including the following substitutions: red bell peppers for green peppers (I know, the recipe has "green pepper" in the title but the red are much tastier!), chicken chorizo for ground beef (about 1/4 pound per person), pre-seasoned diced canned tomatoes for the whole tomatoes, fresh tomato soup/bisque instead of the condensed tomato soup (no need to water down, and as another reviewer suggested, spoon it in between the filling layers).  We found that brown rice won't cook in the 15 minutes allotted, so during take 2 we cooked the brown rice separately in chicken broth for about 35 minutes (10 minutes less than suggested on the instructions), then added it when called for.  Because the rice was already at a softened state, we just simmered the mix for a few minutes to get the flavors to blend.  We added a bit more cheese than called for, mixing about half of it to the filling just before spooning it into the pepper.  The remaining cheese was placed on the top.  Finally, we added a minced jalepeno.  There were a lot of changes, but the end result was PERFECT!

Really enjoyed this recipe but changed a few of the ingredients and it added a little 'umph' that some reviews said it was needing. I used a tube of Jimmy Dean sausage instead of the ground beef. It gave it a little extra flavor. Once the sausage was browned I set it aside to drain and cooked the onions alone. After the onions were translucent I added the sausage back and continued to follow the directions. I used 14 oz. of fresh chopped tomatoes as well (instead of the canned). When the rice/sausage mixture was ready I put it in a mixing bowl and added 1/3 cup of canned rice, one half cup of shredded cheddar cheese, 5 dashes of Tobasco sauce and about 1/4 cup of freshly chopped cilantro.  I nixed the can of condensed tomato soup at the end I didn't think the mixture needed it. I baked it at 350 for 25 minutes and it was amazing! My husband and I will definitely eat it that way again! (note: boiling the peppers first is a MUST!)

I followed a few of the suggestions of the other reviewers and added 2 chopped chipotle peppers, oregano and a tsp. low-sodium taco seasoning to the tomato mixture. I also pre-cooked the rice in beef broth, added garlic to the sauteing onions and added corn, peas and carrots for some extra veggies. I mixed in sharp-cheddar and topped with a slice of monterey jack cheese. Hubby says he'd eat them again and he's a meat and potatoes kind of guy. I gave it a 4 as I think it would have been a bit bland without the other additions. Thanks for the recipe!

these were excellent! BUT there wasnt enough stuffing mixture to fill all of my green peppers. My peppers were quite large so maybe that was the problem.

I made recipe as directed except I only blanched the green peppers for 3 minutes.  I added Tabasco sauce and some red pepper flakes to the meat/rice mixture. Made a nice zing. Baked as directed without adding the tomato soup topping. Froze them in packages of 2. When ready to use, take out or freezer and place in microwave safe baking dish and cover with tomato sauce and heat through as directed.

Great recipe. I did some changes after reading some of the reviews. I cut the peppers lengthwise, I added green onions instead of the white onion, I added oregano, basil, cayenne pepper and I used tomato paste instead of the soup. I only used 3 bell peppers too. I also did not add the rice because I am limiting my carb intake.

Like others I added bay leaf, beef bouillon, oregano.  I also use my canned venison instead of ground beef.  I had no tomato soup.  Added ketchup in the mix.  Kids loved it.

Will defenitely make again.  This is a keeper!
Few changes- used diced tomatoes, added mushrooms, and garlic to the mixture. Used canned tomato sauce instead of soup. 
Last 5 minutes, I uncovered them, and added cheese on top. Delicious!
Next time will try to use Italian sausage instead. Might have more flavor and spice!

THis was very tasty, but I did change up a few things.  I used Rotel diced tomatoes and green chiles and I added about 1 1/2 tsp of horseradish to the mixture.  Yummy!  Even the door to door salesman loved them!

A good recipe but i added  a few things and replaced the tomato soup with a 50/50 mixture of salsa and pasta sauce.
I replaced the plain white rice with  rice-a-roni mexican rice mix,added diced mexican style  tomatoes,1 clove garlic  chopped fine,a small can of mexicorn(drained). All of this went into the rice it'self and then was stuffed into the peppers and  baked and right before peppers were due out of the oven I poured the remaining salsa pata sauce over the tips of cooked peppers and topped it of with some additional cheese(shredded cheddar)  baked for 3 mins more and then enjoyed them.

We loved these peppers. Quinoa as a sub for rice was a nice choice. I added additional seasonings, and used red bell peppers - very sweet and tasty! My husband asked that we add these to our regular rotation.

Although this recipe is great I love to add flavour and spice into everything. I swapped ground beef for spicy italian sausage and added Cajun spices, chili paste, pepper, cayenne pepper, as well as some diced celery and carrots. Used red+orange peppers (was in the fridge) and used diced tomatos + aribiatta tomato sauce for an extra kick. definetly do over! :)

I only gave this three stars because I made a whole whack of changes to it. I used ground pork instead of beef, added garlic to the beef mixture, used quinoa instead of rice, and jarred marinara sauce instead of the tomato soup. I also wound up using a lot more of everything except the pepper because I accidentally bought a 29 oz can of diced tomatoes. I had never made stuffed peppers before, but these turned out fabulous.

I made this for my family's dinner tonight, and while it definitely took a full hour to prepare and then cook, it was worth while.  I highly recommend this recipe.

These are really easy and are really good! I use red bell peppers because I like them better. I also use ground turkey and add two cloves are garlic too. Easy, healthy meal!

This was the first time I've made stuffed green peppers.  I used jasmine rice because that's what I had in my pantry and I used two cans of tomatoes instead one, and this turned out fabulous.  My husband even enjoyed it and stuffed green peppers isn't at the top of his list of favorite foods to eat.

I thought this recipe was really good.  I used chorizo instead of beef and jasmine rice.  I used yellow and green peppers.  I made these for my husband as I don't even like peppers, but once I cooked them I couldn't resist and I sure enjoyed them!

This is a great "base" recipe. I definitely recommend adding spices to your taste though. We added tons of italian seasoning, garlic, spicy spaghetti seasoning, and diced the pepper tops and added. We also cooked the rice first. The end results were so delicious! (and great leftover too!)

Good recipe, before i stuffed the peppers i gave the meat a taste and to me it was bland. I added a packet of taco seasoning and it was exactly what it needed, topped with mexican cheese and it was amazing!

The only change I make to this recipe is to cut up the tops and saute with the meat and onions. Also, sometimes I make with red, orange, or yellow bell peppers for color. This is the best stuffed peppers recipe I have found!

My teenage son actually asks for this! I took the advice of others and used a can of diced tomatoes, sauteed garlic with the meat, added extra spices, and cooked the rice first. When I tried with uncooked rice it needed an extra 30 minutes before the rice was fully cooked. Makes the house smell great and heats up well as leftovers, too!

Great recipe! I did make some changes. First, I cooked the meat with oregano and garlic powder, no salt. Then, I used picante sauce in place of the chopped tomatoes. I also used yellow spanish rice which I cooked seperately. I mixed the picante sauce beef and yellow rice. Then, layered each pepper halve with cheese, beef mix, picante sauce, topped with cheese. I mixed some V8 juice and picante sauce (in place of the tomato soup) to pour over the dish. We ate it all over yellow rice. This will be a recipe I use when we have company! Looks good and tastes good! Thanks

Yum! I had never made or tried a stuffed pepper until i made this recipe.  It was exactly what i was hoping it would taste like.  Instead of mixing the cheese in the meat we made layers putting a little bit of cheese and tomato soup which i think made the meat taste better.  When my mother tried the recipe, the rice was still hard.  Make sure the rice is fully cooked before putting it in the oven!

This is a great basic stuffed peppers recipe.  I took one of the reviewers suggestions and added a couple cloves of garlic to it.  My family LOVED this!  I actually had a request from them to just make the stuffing for it, it was so good.  I personally used a variety of peppers (2 red, 2 yellow, 2 orange and 2 green).  I made a little extra of the stuffing to make it for 8 people.  Thank you for a great recipe!

This was good, added my own cheese on to too about 5 minutes before it was done cooking.  However, I bought 6 green bell peppers as directed and it only filled four of them, which is why I give this recipe only 4 stars.

This recipe is great. I made it for my family and my mom told me it was the best she'd ever had. I did layer the soup and the stuffing but besides that, it was amazing (and I don't even like green peppers). Thanks :)

It's a great "base" recipe. I added seasoning (garlic salt, lawrys season salt, and chicicken boullion) to my meat and white rice. I also cooked them separately first, then combined everything before stuffing the peppers as other reviewers suggested.  Since the seasoning I used already had salt, I eliminated addding any extra, just used the pepper.  I got lazy any decided not to boil the peppers before, but I suggest that you DON'T skip this part.

I made a few changes.  I added garlic powder, parsley, and italian seasoning.  I did not have Worcestershire sauce so I used a teaspoon of soy sauce and about a tablespoon of A1 steak sauce.  I also added a few drops of hot sauce.  I used 2 cans of tomato sauce instead of the tomato soup (didnt have soup on hand).  My husband and son loved it. Will be making again.  :0)  Thanks

These were so good. I followed someone else's suggestion and put some of the tomato soup in between the rice/beef mixture. I also used ground turkey which was still so good. And I didn't mix the tomato soup with water, it was just fine the way it was. And each one is so filling. I also only used 5 bell peppers instead of 6 and I thought there was just enough filling. I topped it with cheese before I topped it with tomato soup. So good.

I made a few changes and my husband loves it!  I added chili powder, red pepper flakes, and feta cheese.  Plus used ground round mixed with lean ground beef to help cut down a bit of fat/calories.

not really flavorful...  i added a good amount of spices and worcestershire sauce and still, it came out sorta bland...  the tomato gravy helped with flavor, but that's about it.

This turned out to be a winner that I served at a recent dinner.  I took the liberty of substituting ground turkey for beef.  I also used a very sharp cheddar, which added just the right amount of spiciness.  Everyone commented how great it tasted but didn’t know why it tasted differently from other stuffed pepper recipes.  It was the cheese of course but no one realized it was an ingredient, and it really distinguished this dish.

Cut the amount of rice in half! I had way too much filling left over. Also I put some tomato sauce in the bottom with cheese, filled the pepper halfway with rice, added more tomato sauce and cheese, then filled to top with rice and topped with sauce and cheese! Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was very good. I always try the recipe as is first before making any changes to it. This one I might change slightly to give it a little more flavor but I like spice and I am sure that many people like it as is!

I really enjoyed this recipe, even though I am not a huge fun of green peppers. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and filled the pepper halfway with the meat mixture and then covered the mixture with tomato soup, then added more meat and again covered with the soup. I believe this really helped the mixture remain moist and added more flavor. Also, I added a lot of italian seasoning to the tomato soup and free pressed garlic to the meat mixture. The only problem that I had was that the peppers fell apart after boiling. We had to hold them together with aluminum foil when putting them in to bake.

This is a very tasty recipe. Full of flavor. Everyone enjoyed this very much. Third time using this recipe. The only change I made was doubling the worcestershire sauce. Excellent!

This was a delish recipe! Even my husband who is not a fan of green peppers liked it.  I added more Worcestershire sauce than the recipe calls for, and also some shallots and garlic salt for more flavor. Will make again for sure!

I added a hispanic flair to mine and instead of worcestershire sauce i added pace ticante salsa. They had a little more zing than my girlfriend was used to but she loved them any way even her roomate that doesn't like stuffed peppers admitted that she liked them. I also removed the tomato soup since salsa is tomato based.

Great recipe.  Added garlic and dried oregono to the ground beef as well as a pinch of cayanne for some kick.  The tomatos were diced (just easier) and I added basil to it.  I cooked rice seperately in the rice cooker (since it always turns out perfect that way).  I boiled the bell peppers for a bit longer and I'm glad I did.  They were perfect for eating with a fork.  Overall this is a great recipe to start but would suggest you play with it and make it your own.  My boyfriend LOVED this one!

I have never had stuffed peppers before let alone make them....  These stuffed peppers were so very easy to make even for a novice.  My dad loves stuffed peppers and said they were one of the best that he has had.  The only changes I made was just a little more rice, and I added a little italian seasoning to the can of diced tomatoes and a little garlic.  Other than that everything else was the same.  I will continue to make this dish.  Super easy, didn't take long, farely healthy and exceptionally Yummy!

I loved this recipe. I made it almost just like the recipe called for except instead of tomato soup, I used tomato sauce.  I also added some minced garlic. I will make this again and again, I'm sure.  I've been looking for a long time for an easy but good recipe for peppers.  Thanks for bringing my search to an end!

I used green, yellow, and orange peppers.  I liked the yellow and orange better and think next time I will eliminate the green altogether and try red, yellow, and orange.

Nice change of pace when using the suggestions of the celery, garlic & paprikia.  Also substituted the diced tomatoes and cooked rice.  Like others, one can of the tomato soup was more than enough.  Also used ground turkey and red, yellow & orange peppers rather than green.  Very tasty!!!

Really good!  But it is hard for me to follow a recipe without giving my little twist on it.  I read alot of the reviews and tried my own.  I cut the peppers in half, boiled for a couple minutes, and set them aside to drain and sprinkled salt and pepper on them.  I browned and seasoned my ground meat, added garlic and onions, parsley, basil, oregano, hunt's seasoned diced tomatoes, worcestershire, and some ketsup.  Then added my rice, but added a little more then the recipe called for and added a little more water too.  (You can use the water you boiled your peppers in to give a little more flavor).  Dropped a little beef base in with it to soak up in the rice.  Brought to a boil.  Covered and cooked for 15 min.  DO NOT take the lid off during this time!  When done, push of fire and set aside still with lid on.  Then instead of only putting only chedder, I mostly put sliced cheese with a little chedder.  Stuffed peppers.  Warmed 1 can tomatoe soup and a V8 and seasoned sauce.  Put extra rice and meat mixture between peppers in dish. Topped with sauce and grated cheese and cooked.  EXCELLENT!

I found these to be very good stuffed peppers. What I don't understand is how some cooks rate a recipe but obviously didn't read it very well. This recipe makes no mention of sausage or instant rice, much less three cups. The recipe calls for ground beef and 1/2 cup of uncooked rice.

YUMMY!!  I followed some other review's suggestions. 1) I used ground turkey, and seasoned with Italian seasoning, while browning.  2) I used a can of diced tomatoes. 3)  I added cheese (just a enough to cover the bottom) to bottom of peppers. 4) Filled half of pepper with beef mixture and then added a spoonful of the tomato soup( which I spiked with a dask of balsamic vinegar, 1Tbsp Italian dressing and 2 Tbsp, water~I spotted most of these measurements) then the beef mixture and topped of with the tomato soup.  Very moist!  Will make this again and again.  Thanks to all, for your input, makes a real difference..:)

I added basil and italian seasonings and a tablespoon of minced garlic. The rice needed closer to 20 min. rather than the 15. I topped with cheese before pouring the tomato soup on top as well. It as wonderful!

The peppers should be boiled a little longer than 5 minutes. They were a little tough. But other than that my fiance devoured them! And we will cook them again.

This is a great recipe.  I used red bell peppers instead and it turned out great.  Followed the recipe as is except that I forgot to salt the insides of the peppers before I put the beef mixture.  They were still delicious.

These stuffed green peppers were a hit with my husband.. I did tweak the recipe a little.  I cooked the onions separately with a clove of garlic.  I also cooked the rice.  While I was cooking the hamburger, I mixed the other ingredients together.  I added ketchup and Texas Pete to the tomato soup.. The result was delicious..

Easily adaptable. Didn't use the soup. Just poured a little spaghetti sauce on each one and topped off with cheddar cheese. In the meat mixture I added a cup of shedden jalapeno/jack cheese and some garlic and when I sliced off the tops of the peppers I cut the core out of the tops and went ahead and chopped up that part of the pepper and cooked it with the onion--no sense in wasting it.

We realy enjoyed this recipe.  I did make a few changes to make it more healthy.  I used lean ground beef.  I also did not cook the meat with cheee.  I placed the peppers in a muffin pan to baked with Jalsberg cheese at the end.

I made some changes, but still found these a bit bland and crumbly.  Didn't add cheese to mixture - just topped the peppers. Added Italian style tomatoes instead of plain. Only used one can tomato soup and some tomato paste.   Next time I think I'd make something more like a meatloaf mixture to stuff the peppers with (raw) and cook longer. Everything just kind of spilled out and they were messy to eat.

Pretty good. One pound ground beef was enough filling for four green peppers cut lengthwise. And I added several spices, as other reviewers suggested, like oregano, basil, italian seasoning and garlic.  Good the next day, too.

tHis is one of the best stuffed peppers I have ever had!!!  Freezes beautifully and reheats well!!!  The cheese in the mixture instead of on top makes all the difference in the world!  Use a good quality of tomato soup!!!

Delicious! I did add extra worchestershire sauce and cooked rice separate in the water I boiled the peppers in to give it some extra flavor. I used mozzarella cheese instead also, it just seemed more fitting. I've pretty much eaten all of them so far :) I also season my turkey meat a certain way and just seasoned it that way rather than just salt and pepper, it added a lot of my own flavor. Mmm, very good!

I couldn't give it 5 stars because I used ground hot sausage (it's all I had).  But it was amazing!!!!  Not sure if it would have been as good with regular ground beef.

I'm not a huge fan of bell peppers, but this recipe got such great reviews that I thought I'd give it a try.  Not only was it quick & easy, but it was delicious!  I pretty much followed the recipe as written although I did add garlic to the meat and substituted tomato sauce for the whole peeled tomatoes.  I also didn't use the tomato soup - the mixture was plenty moist without it.  I served this dish with sweet whole kernal corn and warm bread & butter.  When a dinner can be thrown together in 10 minutes and get such rave reviews from the family - it's definately a keeper!

This dish is simple to make, you can't wreck this one. It needs a bit more spice. I added salsa instead of water, garlic powder, chili powder, in addition to salt and pepper. It's worth making.

This dish came out great. The only changes I made was to use seasoned salt instead of regular, a full cup of water instead of half ( the rice was still a little hard with only 1/2 a cup) and I put a little garlic powder on the meat. My husband and daughter loved it! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was excellent.  I modified the recipe a little by substituting diced tomatoes and added diced celery and garlic as well as hot paprika when I browned the meat.  I also seasoned the tomato soup with Mrs Dash and worcestershire sauce and simmered that on low while I prepared the rest.

These didn't get the reaction I was expecting.  My hubby said the stuffing was really kind of bland.  I don't eat meat so I'm reporting back what my critcs tell me.  Filling but bland was the verdict.

Great recipe.  My whole family loved this meal.  I did mix one of the tomato soup cans with the meat mixture before I stuffed the peppers.  I poured the other can over the peppers as directed.  This was a delicious meal that I will make again very soon.

Recipe was delicious, but I also cut peppers in half length wise, and used barley instead of rice.  I often use barley in place of rice, a little more fiber. 4 stars

Excellent and easy recipe.  I already had leftover rice so I omitted the 1/2 C of water.   I've also made this with ingredients that I had on hand...swiss cheese instead of cheddar, soy sauce instead of worchestershire...and the peppers always turn out fabulously.

First time I've ever made stuffed peppers. I used red and green - we liked the red the best. I used br. rice -  extra worchestershire and a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies. Instead of tomato soup I used tomato paste and diluted it a bit with water and added it to the left over filling and poured it over and around the peppers. Also mixed cheese into the beef mixture and topped them with cheese towards the end of baking time.  They were wonderful and plan to use this recipe again!! Thanks

I used arborio rice (like they use in risotto) and tomato sauce and it was crazy delicious!

Used red peppers, diced tomatoes, soy sauce and tomato sauce. Added beef bouillon and garlic. Could use a little more spice or salt. Can omit cheese.

Awesome flavors!  And fairly simple.  This is our 2nd year using this recipe and we were so excited when we got a bunch of fresh green peppers through our CSA.  I will make it again next week if we get more!  I would agree that the rice is slightly crunchy but this year I used brown rice. Not enough to keep this from being an awesome dish. Probably wouldn't hurt to use a LITTLE bit more water, chicken, beef, or vegetable stock and some of the other commenters variations sound yummy too.

Me and my husband loved these! I only made a couple of changes, intsead of cooking the rice mixture in water, i used beef stock and I think I used almost a cup because the rice wasn't cooking all the way, did add garlic, oregano and about half a packet of spaghetti seasoning. The tomato soup gives it a different flavor than what I'm used to in stuffed peppers, a little sweeter, but it was still good. This reciepe is going in my box to make again. The husband barely breathed while eating them!

This was my very first experience with stuffed bell peppers & I must say Yum! I used left over rice and omitted the water. Plus I used some tips from others adding oregano and garlic. I think I will leave out the rice next time to make this a great low carb dish.

Something was off about the flavor. I tried it again and cooked the rice in chicken broth which enhanced the flavor of the dish.

Great recipe! I tweeked to taste by pre-cooking rice and adding less than called for, used 1 1/2 cans of soup and thinned it with v-8 juice, added beef stock instead of water, cut peppers in half and steamed for longer than 5  minutes - about 8. also I took the advice of another cook here and spooned some of the soup into the shells before filling. This is a great crowd pleasing recipe. It is one of my favorites now. Thank you.

This looked good, but didn't think Ketsup would work for me.  I made my own sauce.  Then added cooked basmati rice, about 3 cups.  Stuffed peppers that I had steamed 20 min. and cut in half, topped with some cheese and baked until heated through.  Everybody loved it!  I hope if you try this, you do too.  I just hope I remembered everythng as I put this together on my own, no recipe.

I made this for dinner and it was awesome.  However, I did make a few minor adjustments.  I added 2 1/2 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce, I also used instant brown rice (only had to simmer about 10 min). Then I just added the undiluted tomato soup to the beef mixture, it was saucy, but not runny.  I baked for 20 min, and it turned out delicious!!

used 4 peppers, had filling left over...but added mushrooms, 2 tablespoons of meaty Prego sauce, one small onion, some garlic and a little ketchup. I used a whole can of ROTEL...instead of tomatoes...gave it the zing i was looking for, and used tomato sauce instead of soup. I did spoon half the filling in the peppers, then added the sauce, filling the rest and topping it off with the rest of the sauce and some freshly grated Mozzarella. Next time i think i might try it with the soup instead...but overall a good taste.  I enjoyed it very much!!

This was really tasty!  I followed the recipe pretty much exactly, except I used only 4 peppers.  I added some Greek seasoning to both the meat mixture and the inside of the peppers and with the extra sauce I spread it out around the peppers in the baking dish.  Everything turned out great and I will definitely be making this dish again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this twice and it's a little dry but with some modification this base recipe is otherwise a nice change of pace.  Using red or yellow peppers seemed is a better bet if you don't like the slight tartness of a green bell pepper.

This is the only stuffed pepper recipe I've ever liked.  My son and husband like it as well and we don't even use cheese, since my son doesn't like cheese.  Thank you so much for sharing this Suzanne.  I have a very hard time finding recipes all 3 of us will enjoy. The only thing I changed was I used pre-cooked brown rice, so I didn't add water when I added the  rice and I did not add cheese.  This will be one of my well-loved recipes from now on!

I gave this recipe only 3 stars because I didn't care for the cheddar cheese flavor in with the tomatoes and rice.  I think it would have been better with some grated Parmesan.  I will probably try this recipe again but change the cheese.

This recipe was good, but to make it great it needs some tweaking; it was kind of bland. I used ground turkey in place of the beef, and used tomato sauce instead of tomato soup. I only bake four peppers and used all of the rice/meat mixture. Next time I will double the mixture and use Rotel and Mexican rice to see if that gives it more flavor.

Delicious!!! Sliced peppers in 1/2 (long side) and boiled submerged for recommended time. Sauteed beef with onions. Used diced tomatoes and added cracked black pepper a little bit of salt, parsley and Italian Seasoning. During last 10 minutes of baking sprinkled with freshly grated parmisian cheese

I changed mine up a bit.  Instead of white rice I used Spanish rice to give it some extra flavor.  Instead of tomato soup I used 1 can of tomato sauce and 1/2 jar of salsa.  Plus I added 1 can of southwestern style corn.  It turned out really good.

This was fabulous! I made it with ground turkey. Next time I will fill half the pepper with the rice mixture, pour in some tomato soup, put in rest of rice mixture then add top it off with more soup.

This was okay, kind of bland for us. I could tell no one was excited about this meal, including myself. Very filling though and reheated well for lunch the next two days.

Like the previous reviewers stated, be sure and pour in some sauce halfway through stuffing the peppers.   The mix looked a little weak in terms of flavor, so I added taco seasoning in the burger and onion mix to add a little pizazz.     This makes for awesome leftovers, so much better that I thought it was better reheated than the first time!

I made the recipe exactly as given.  It was very good.  I froze the leftover stuffed peppers in individual containers for lunches.  The next time I make it, I will add a little touch of corn and black beans.

I loved this recipe and for my first time making it, I think i did a great job. My roommates were raving about how it reminded them of how there mom used to make it. I am going to try a different version the 2nd time around and add Bison meat.

Good times - This was very tasty it made me want to dance in kitchen. I followed the directions exactly about 15 minutes before time - I topped the bell pepper with provolone cheese, sprinkled it with some seasoned bread crumbs and a little paprika ran it back in the oven. Delicious even better the second day. Indeed will make this again.

This is a great recipe to start, but I made some changes.  I used feta instead o f cheddar.  To the meat, I added garlic, parlsey, oregano and onions and used ground turkey.  Sprinkling a little bit sugar on the stuffed green pepper before placing the cap on helps with the tartness.  I stuffed tomatos as well and it was delicious!

These are so good!  I use boca crumbles instead of ground beef to make them EXTREMELY diet friendly.  I also kick it up with some spices, Italian seasoning, garlic and onion powder.  Thanks for the easy and delicious recipe!

I have made this for the first time in my life. I was awesome!,obviously i changed a couple of things, added garlic cloves, jalapenos, oregano, adobo, green salsa, recaito base to the meat but on the whole, the recipe is very strong, easy to add your style and very tasty.

This was the first time I have ever had stuffed green peppers and yes they were very good!! Some changes I would make would be using either yellow or red peppers, and adding some red cayenne pepper to the rice mixture to add some zing. Definitely will make this again.

This was fine but probably not good enough to make again.  I don't have any complaints, but it just wasn't better than any other stuffed green peppers recipe.

I will usually take others advice and change the recipe based on their reviews, but I just didn't feel like jotting anymore info down at the time, so I made the recipe as is. I thought these were okay, but I don't really like peppers, but my husband thought they were great and requested them for a repeat meal. We both thought that they could use more seasoning and as for our kids, they didn't touch the stuff, but then they like R. noodles :0

I haven't eaten Stuffed Peppers in years! Mainly because I really don't care for them, but my daughter loves Bell Pepper, so I made them for her! What a hit...even I loved them.  Went straight by the recipe...wouldn't change a thing.

Since I have a picky eater in the household, I chose to use turkey in place of the ground beef, and cooked this just as the recipe advised, without further changes, I have to say this was very, very good, and easy to fix.  It was even better the next day.    My advice though, I don't like my peppers to crunchy, so next time, I will boil it longer.  Thanks for sharing Suzanne.

OK-I strayed from this recipe and created my own , I guess. I don't like when people do it, but here it goes.  Reading other recipes, I decided to halve the peppers and roast them at 350 for 20 minutes. In the meantime, I cheated, pressed for time used a bag of microwave Uncle Bens jasmine rice (90 seconds)and sauteed garlic & onion in Olive oil. Then added the rice, some browned ground beef, some tomatoe sauce I had, chopped jalepenos, chopped cherry peppers and the like. Filled the pepper shells added cheese and put it in the oven for 5 more minutes. Nice firm peppers but fork cut perfect! Baking them first assures they will not get too soft as ingredients are already cooked.

I'm giving it a 4 because I changed it so much, but the basic steps are the same. First, no tomato soup. It has too much sodium, and two cans of diced tomatoes with all the juice will make the peppers plenty fresh and juicy. I also chopped up the tops of the peppers and added them in with the onions. I melted a big handful of cheese into the tomato, meat (I used veggie meat- delicious!) mixture and topped them with cheese. As for spices, I used lots of garlic, Italian seasoning, and even some soy sauce. Let me tell you, they were freaking wonderful!

Excellent recipe. I used a can of fire roasted tomatoes ( all I had ) and a can of tomatoesauce to pour over the top. Then seasoned them with a little Italian seasoning and garlic powder and onion powder. Best stufed peppers I ever made.

Very good. I will make them again and add a bay leaf and garlic. Maybe some chopped mushrooms too.

My husband loves his peppers crunchy, and this is the first recipe we were given that he LOVES.  I've used turkey once and ground beef the other three times I have made this.  I tend to use a tad more rice, and I have used fresh and canned tomatoes.  I add the tops of the peppers to the mix also.  My hubs and our almost 2 year old love this recipe.  I don't eat them, but I have used some of the mix for meatloaf for myself.  Love it, and will continue to make this for my family!

I love this recipe, although I confess to tweaking it a bit. I do follow it, but add more Worcestershire sauce and a cup of rice. I also use diced tomatoes and add about a quarter to half a cup of ketchup. Sometimes I add some Sriracha for heat as well. This turns out so well though. I love it!

Pretty good.  I cooked the beef with a TBSP of chopped garlic and the onions, then added 1/2 tsp of Basil, 2 tsp of Oregano, and 1 tsp Italian Seasoning.  I also doubled the Wors. sauce, though it tasted like it could use more.  I only used one can of tomato sauce and mixed it in the rice mixture while it was cooking.  The peppers do need some sauce on top though or the beef will get crispy and overdone.  Delicious.

I only made 2 peppers but wanted leftovers of the meat (and I also used ground turkey). I did add a little more Worcestershire sauce and I used a fresh tomato instead of a can. Excellent recipe but needs some more spices.

The recipe was really good but I used salsa in mine.  This takes care of the tomatoes and onions and also adds a little extra spice and flavor.  They turned out really well and I also added the extra cheese on top.

These were excellent. The only changes I made were to saute the onions separately from the beef with olive oil and one crushed garlic clove. I also followed the suggestion of another reviewer poured some of the tomato soup in the middle of the peppers as well as on the top. I also topped my peppers with shredded cheddar cheese. I will definately be making these again!

I made this for dinner tonight. My husband refuses to eat green peppers but he enjoyed this. I changed a few things to work for me. Were rice people so I used 2 cups of rice and 2 cups of water, which meant it had to cook a little longer. I used 1 TBS of Worcestershire....were flavor people. I also just put the cheese on top.

I used ground chicken and a chicken flavoured rice to make these. Also I only used 4 large peppers and there was not a scoop of mix left.  They tasted GREAT.. My b/f loved them and they were awsome the next day too ... Also I'd suggest putting some of the soup/sauce the pepper, maybe fill half way, add sauce, fill rest of the way...Or just cut the pepper in half (vertically) and pour sauce over each half....YUMM.

This was fantastic, and a great dinner for a cold night!  I adjusted slightly to add 1 cup of rice instead of 1/2, to stretch the recipe just a bit.  I added a little more cheese than the recipe called for, and I didn't have two cans of tomato soup, so I used the one can I had and a can of tomato sauce.  It worked out great.  Loved the recipe!

Great recipe. I used orange peppers instead of green.     I cooked the rice with one vegetable boullion ahead of time.  I used turkey chop meat and the diced tomatoes with green chilies.  I added garlic powder oregano and basil to meat mixture.  I didnt use tomato soup instead some marinara sauce mixed with some water and the rest of the liquid from the diced tomatoes

very good! I used marinara sauce instead of tomato soup, since I wanted some flavor. I would probably try to add some minced garlic or cayenne pepper for myself, as it was just a little bland. My roommates aren't a fan of different spices and things so they LOVED them :)

This was a really good recipe. I changed it only a tiny bit by using garlic powder when I cooked the hamburger and used tomato sauce instead of the soup. Next time I think I will use less rice and will use instant rice because what I had on hand was just regular rice and it was not as tender as it should have been.

This was yummy. My husband and I thought it was really tasty, but I changed it a bit based on others recommendations. Instead of tomato soup, I used tomato sauce. I used Rotel diced tomatoes and green peppers and it gave it a nice zing. I also added minced garlic, italian seasoning, and a beef bouillon cube to the beef/rice mizture.  Gave it much more flavor.

This was a very good recipe!   I had some of the stuffing mixture for the peppers left over. So, I stuffed my peppers and put the remaining mixture  around the peppers in the bottom of my baking dish. toped with the tomato soup. My husband and I loved the stuffed peppers. My two kids who are 5 and 2 loved the mixture that I placed around the peppers in the baking dish! It was wonderful to find something everyone wanted to eat :)

The tomato soup sounded a little out there for my taste, but it cooked down and was really good.  I had 2 giant green peppers so I cut them in half lengthwise and filled them with the meat/rice mixture.  I kept everything to the recipe other than the amount of peppers.  It turned out great and I'll be making these again.

I'm used to stuffed peppers that you stuff with raw meat and bake.  These were kind of like having chili in a pepper cup.

These are amazing!! I took some advice from other reviewers and stuffed with half of the mixture, added tomato soup, then added the other half. I also topped with cheese 5 minutes before it was done baking. I used italian sausage for the meat, but hamburger would have been just as tasty! I will make this again and again!

I changed it a tad.  I used onions AND garlic with my beef.  I also used a chunky tomato sauce in place of tomato soup.  To make it healthier than ground chuck, I used 96% lean ground beef and brown rice in place of white rice.

Absolutely our favorite stuffed pepper recipe.  Also great with zucchini instead of green peppers (slice one side off, lengthwise and scoop out the center with a spoon).  I used 1 can of tomato soup instead of 2, added some oregano and basil, and added a bit more cheese on top.  Bon appetit!

This was delicious! I did make a few changes based on other reviews. I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of the whole tomatoes.  I didn't bother boiling the peppers ahead of time.  I also cooked the rice separately and then added it to the skillet at the end to warm it up and mix the flavors.  I doubled the Worcestershire sauce and cheese amounts. I cut the peppers in half length-wise, laid them in a baking dish and stuffed them that way.  I used tomato sauce rather than the soup and layered the sauce and beef/rice mixture when stuffing the peppers.  I poured extra sauce and cheese over the peppers then baked for 40 minutes.

Thank you so much for posting this recipe!  I can't believe I made something so wonderful.  I added a chopped jalapeno (seeded), garlic, and Italian Seasoning.  I will definitely make this dish again.

The original recipe while good was a little bland so I added the following to kick it up a notch: chili powder, tabasco, ital. seasonings, and ketchup.  What a difference!!

My family and I love the recipes. I double the recipe and substitute (1/3)couscous instead of rice.  Couscous is a lot better for you than rice.  I also get tomato sauce with garlic. and Stir in the tomato sauce in the mixture and then add on top. We aren't tomato lovers but the stired in tomato give a great balance.

OH SO GOOD!   I found this recipe over a year ago when searching for a stuffed green pepper recipe. My family requests this for dinner often. I serve this with a side of buttered corn niblets and Texas toast. I usually make a little extra so I can have leftover filling. It is great for a quick lunch the next day  when spooned over tortilla chips. YUM!

This was very good.  I was stressing at first about the amount of rice and how much juice was in the beef saute pan, but it all worked out great after baking them.  We didn't use the cheese.  I even ate one and I hate green peppers.  Thanks for the recipe, Suzanne!  It's a keeper!

5 stars with mods. I made 3 cups of brown rice. I added 1 cup of the cooked rice to my meat mixture. I served the cooked peppers over my extra rice with the extra juice from the pan. Loved this! The cheese didn't do anything for me. I may not add it next time. I will add minced garlic next time.

Excellent basic stuffed peppers. I did omit the cheese. I would also boil the peppers for 4 minutes instead of 5 since I like a firmer bell pepper.

Ill start off by saying My bf doesnt eat bell peppers so he just ate the filling...I got two thumbs up. I made for family and friends, mostly people that have never had a stuffed pepper and everyone liked it.  I did slice peppers in half lenghtwise to make more and doubled the recipe.  I used twice the rice called for and used minute brown rice. I also mixed ground turkey with the ground beef and added half a pack of Italian dressing mix.

I made a few changes, hence the 4 stars. I didn't use tomato soup. I used tomato sauce(canned) with fresh herbs from my herb bed, greek oregano and sweet basil(1/4 cup each chopped), salt, black pepper, garlic powder and sugar. Browned the ground beef, drained, sauted onions, added chopped canned tomatos, one cup water, 1/2 cup cup long grain rice(long cooking), ground beef and simmer for 20-25 minutes, till rice is tender. Steamed peppers for 5 minutes(I don't think think this was necesary since I cooked stuffed peppers for 40 minutes at 350F). Stuffed peppers,split longways, poured sauce around and over, sprinkeled peppers with shredded colby/jack and baked for 40 minutes. Delicious.

This is very easy to make and has turned out well for me every time I have made it. This was great especially when I was just getting started with cooking. I substituted lean ground turkey for the ground beef and was just as good.

Very good and easy. The stuffing mixture could have used a little more flavor.  I would add a little garlic to the mixture and a little sauce too.

Very good. I substituted brown rice and let it simmer for a bit longer. Only used one can of tomato soup and it was still a bit too wet.  We actually liked these as leftovers better! (because the filling stuck together better.)

This was my first attempt at stuffed peppers and they were excellent. I used 93% lean HB and added an extra 1/2 pound of ground turkey breast, which was just enough meat for very full peppers. I found that one can of tomato soup was enough. Very good dish; hubby loved them too! (Served with green salad and fresh sweet corn.)

Kid Friendly! The only change I made was to use Uncle Ben's wild rice with the seasoning packet, which gave the beef a delicious flavor, and a dash of kosher salt. I also added some cheese at the bottom of the pepper, because we love cheese. These were a hit, even with the 2 and 4 yr old, who got to help make them and ate them up!

WE LOVED THEM, BUT I DID SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT.FIRST I USED MOZZARELLA FANCY SHREDDED CHEESE INTEAD OF REGULAR CHEESE AND THEN, INSTEAD OF THE TOMATO SAUCE I USED A LARGE CAN OF TRADITIONAL STYLE PASTA SAUCE. I USED ABOUT A HALF CAN OF WATER TO MAKE THE GRAVY LIKE TEXTURE. THEN AFTER THE MEAT AND RICE AND SPICES WERE COOKED I PUT ABOUT 1 CUP OF THE SAUCE AND CHEESE INTO THE MEAT MIXTURE. THEN LOADED UP THE PEPPERS AND TOPPED THEM WITH EXTRA MOZZARELLA CHEESE.I ALSO TOOK OUT THE STEM PART OF THE TOPS OF THE PEPPERS AND PLACED THEM BACK ON TOP THEN IN THE OVEN IT WENT. THEY WERE GREAT.I DID NOT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THEM BEING BLAND AT ALL.EXCELLENT RECIPE WILL MAKE AGAIN.

I had never made stuffed peppers before and I'm glad I did. They turned out really good. However, I only gave the recipe 4 stars because I cannot imagine that it would be good with out the addition of spices (I used 1 teaspoon cumin, 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder). The only other change I made was using cubbed cheddar instead of shredded and using soy burger instead of beef/turkey. My husband loved these, which shocked me because he tends to be pretty picky and these aren't exactly the normal comfort foods he usually enjoys. The leftovers the next day were absolutely amazing; the flavors were so much better!

These were pretty good!  I just added half a can of undiluted soup to the mix, then poured the rest over the top as stated.  It wasn't dry at all this way, as some others said!  I did not use a second can of soup at all.  Overall, these were very good, but not something I'll make super often -- I ended up cutting my pepper into bite size pieces and eating it like a casserole to make it less overwhelmingly "pepper-y." :)  But it is, after all, stuffed PEPPERS!  :)

Decent but not great.   I followed the recipe exactly and I found them to be a bit bland.  I think I will keep lokking for a better pepper recipe.

Could use just a *little* more flavor, but overall these turned out really good.

They were okay...a little lacking in flavor. I think some spices would have helped. I added alot of salt to mine as I was eating it to help add some flavor.

This recipe needs spices and cooked rice. I followed directions but the rice was hard when dinner was served. Will not try this one again.

we really liked these. and they were pretty easy to make. i used frozen ground beef that i had already browned up and leftover cooked rice so i did not cook the filling for the full amount of time since the rice was already tender. also, halved the peppers length-wise. i might play around with the tomato soup sauce some more in the future to give it less of a tomato soup taste. thanks for the recipe!

These were good but not the best that I have ever had. But I must add that I made it was Jennie O's xtra lean turkey meat and that may be the reason. I only used one can of tomato soup which I felt was plenty. I will definitely make it again.

The sauce was perfect until I added the tomato soup.  It then was too sweet and overpowered the other flavors.

So delicious! I added a little more rice and left the tomato soup out all together as it had plenty of liquid. I would also reccomend looking for peppers that are on the smaller size as this is quite a filling meal. Great recipes, i will make this again for sure!

I made this for dinner tonight. After cutting the tops off of red and yellow peppers, I diced the extra pepper sections and added to the stuffing with Italian seasoning, minced shallots and garlic. I used a white/wild rice combo, and the water from the boiled peppers. *Regarding rice cook time, just follow the time noted on the rice.* I only used 1/2 a can of diced tomatoes (I don't like lots of mater chunks), and didn't have the tomato soup, so I didn't add it (I'm glad it wasn't a liquidy dish either). These tasted good, and could easily be spruced up for an Italian or Mexican dish. I served with spinach salad. Will be making again!

This was a great recipe! The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because my rice wasn't all the way done. Everything put together was FANTASTIC. Everyone loved it!

I made a few changes, cut the peppers lengthwise, used brown rice and simmered for 30 min.  I added oregano, garlic, lemon juice and extra worcestershire sauce... they were SO GOOD!!!

This recipe is awesome, but I did a few tweeks to the recipe. I decided to use ground turkey and instead of using instant rice, I cooked brown rice and added it to the turkey mix. I also added about a tablspoon of chili powder and a teaspoon of paprika to give it some kick! and I also omitted the canned tomato soup gravy at the end.

Easy and delicious!  Used 2 HUGE green peppers, 1 lb of extra lean ground beef and 2 cups of cooked brown rice.  Added some seasoning salt to the beef, and chopped up the tops of the peppers and added them to the beef/onion mixture. One can of tomato soup and one can of water mixed, added what wouldn't fit in the peppers to the sauce in the pan.  Perfect.

These came out a little bland. Add spices to like to the filling, hard cheeses, oregano, basil and lots of garlic.

I will be keeping this recipe!  I made it with Turkey sausage rather than humburger meat and used fresh garlic rather than powder.  I zapped the green peppers in the microwave to cut down on baking time.  Other than those changes, I followed the recipe.  It's really good with ketchup too!

I followed the other tips and cut each pepper in half before stuffing.  I used wild rice instead of white rice. It was so good my boys asked me to add it to their favorites!

Really liked this recipe!  Very flavorful, the only thing I did different was add garlic powder and omitted the cheese.  Next time I will double stuffing amount and double the sauce, I like stuffed peppers swimming in sauce.  The kids were so-so with it but I think it was because of it being inside a green pepper.

This recipe is very good! This was my first time making stuffed peppers, and everyone loved them.  My husband kept talking about how good they were. I did make a few changes...I used ground turkey, cooked the rice before mixing with the meat, added extra spices (garlic, garlic salt, pepper, italian seasoning) and extra worcestershire sauce. I used four pretty big green peppers, and cut them in half before filling them.  The amount of filling was perfect for the peppers.  I will definitely be making this recipe over and over again.

I gave this 5 stars because my daughter liked it. She is a picky eater. It was very easy to make. I did not have any canned tomatoes so I used a small can of tomato sauce instead. It was perfect...not runny at all. I put the tomato soup on the top without diluting it with water. I put the grated cheese on top instead of mixing it in the hamburger mix. I will be making this again. I plan to use red bell peppers next time only because I like red bell peppers.

Very good recipe.  Even my fiance who is sure his stuff peppers are the best in the world said they were better.  I added 1 clove of garlic, a tsp of oregano and that was it.  Everything else was the same.  Thanks!

I've made this several times over the past few years and it's always fantastic!  I do use the diced can tomatoes, but other than that don't change a thing.  It's also good with red peppers.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is going into my regular rotation. The only changes is made were: I added 2 cloves of minced garlic to the beef mixture, and I subbed 1 can of tomato sauce for the tomato soup.

I think the quick boiling of the peppers made a huge difference.  Great tip!

Needed some changes.  I punched up the flavor with a serrano pepper and a clove of garlic. I had some Ragu I used in place of one of the cans of soup. Because of other reviews, I also parboiled the rice too.  My family loved it and fought over who was going to take the leftovers to work the next day.

Great recipe! We made just a few changes based on other reviews. With the beef and onions we also added italian seasonings and canned diced tomatoes. The rice we used was just Uncle Ben's spanish style rice that you pop in the microwave so we did that before adding it to the mixture. We topped each pepper with pasta sauce, put a little cheese on top and they came out perfect!!

I added green chilis, oregano, bay leaf and mozzarella cheese. I used 4 peppers and the mix for 6 servings filled them perfect. I also added the tomato soup mixture after filling half way and then topped it off with the soup and more cheese. Very good.

We make these often. Everyone always comments on how great they are.  We usually buy preflavored cous cous.  It works well.

I gave this four stars but I used many of the suggestions to make this a better dish.  I added 2 tablespoons of italian spices; an 8oz. can of tomatoe sauce; some cinnamon and a tablespoon of sugar; mozzarella cheese on the bottom of peppers, and did not dilute the soup topping.  It turned out great with the changes.  I also would not cook this covered. My teenage sons really liked this!

This was really good! I did change the tomato soup to sauce and might use pasta sauce next time.  Even my young kids liked it!  I also thought it was silly to cut the tomatoes and had planned on using diced next time.  The garlic sounds like a good idea too.  But this was a good recipe and we enjoyed it and will definitely use it again!

Very tasty but I made some changes.... I added garlic just a little bit and instead of tomato soup I used spaghetti sauce. I also toped the stuffed bell peppers with mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar. What I would do differently is cut the bell peppers in half and fill them up that way and cook the rice separately. Oh and I used DICED stewed tomatoes, one review had mentioned that its silly to buy stewed tomatoes and the chop them up.... I agree fully!

these came out excellent. you know its good when everyone gets off the couch for seconds.

i made a few small changes to spice it up. i added a can of green chili peppers to the beef/rice mixture. the tomato soup sauce, i added chili powder, cayenne pepper, a little louisiana hot sauce (sounds like alot of spice but its not at all just dont add tons!) some basil and oregano. this gave it a nice zippy flavor.

I'm giving it a 4 because of all the changes i made. I sauted the beef and onion with 2 cloves of minced garlic, and i also seasoned it with italian seasoning, oregano, ground cumin, salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper. Next time i am going to add 2 cups of cheese instead of 2 because i love things cheesy, other than the changes i made it was DELICOUS!! Thanks!

This was awesome!!  It also is a pretty good basic recipe that you could convert easily.  My suggestions:  I use Ground Turkey (more lean), garlic powder and seasoned salt in the turkey, 2 tsp Worcestershire and I chop up the tops of the green peppers and add them to the mixture.  I use tomato sauce instead of tomato soup and I put Monterey jack and Colby cheese for the inside and mozzarella on the top in the last few minutes before broiling ( to get a nice brown cheesy top).  Yum!  Even my kids like this one!

In a hurry to get these made, I neglected to read the instructions. I used the listed ingredients (plus a few from other reviews) and came up with this: I cooked 1/2 lb. each of ground turkey and crumbled turkey Italian sausage with onion and garlic (3 cloves) in skillet. I added a can of diced tomatoes, one beef bouillon cube and 1/2 c. brown rice. I added 1 tsp. of thyme, oregano, and basil to the mix with 2 tsp. of Worcestershire. I let it simmer for about 10 min. then added 1 c. of shredded cheddar to it. I blancHed the halved peppers for 3 minutes and stuffed. They went into the pan (I added about 1/2 c. water in the bottom) and I topped them with 1c. marinara sauce and some extra cheese and baked 30 min. at 375. WONDERFUL!!!!! I did it wrong but they came out all right!

This was great! My husband told me that he didn't like stuffed peppers (and isn't a leftover person) but after having this last night, he wants to finish the leftovers tonight! I also made a few changes... I cooked the rice for 5 minutes before adding it to the meat, and then added 1 cup of water, 2 beef bouillon cubes, 2 tsp of worcestershire instead of 1, a bay leaf, and finished it with 2 cups of cheddar cheese instead of 1. I also used half red peppers and half green peppers.

The taste of these peppers was great!  I used ground turkey instead of beef (just a personal preference for healthier eating.  I also used a can of diced tomatoes instead of dicing whole ones.  And I discovered that I only needed one can of tomato soup instead of two.

The family loved this stuffed pepper recipe! It was wonderful! I try to rate the recipes as is, meaning I don't alter them ~ the FIRST time. If I feel the need after trying as is, I will do so. BUT, in this case, I had to alter two things...substitutions because I had no choice! First, I used monteray cheese instead of cheddar (it was all I had on hand. Well, that and mozzerella!). Second, I had no tomato soup, so I used a can of crushed tomatoes and added a bit of water and s&p. Pour that over the top. But I wouldn't have changed a thing from the original recipe! This is a keeper, for sure!

This was my first try at stuffed peppers and this one is a keeper.  I used ground turkey, added two cloves of garlic, and some italian seasoning.  I forgot to buy the whole tomatoes, so I had to just use some pasta sauce.  Next time I'll try it as written with tomatoes.

Hmm..I would rate this somewhere between a 3 & 4. The meat needs more than just salt & pepper or it would be pretty bland. i added about a palm full of grill seasoning instead of salt pepper and also some minced garlic. The tomato soup was ok but i think i preper seasoned tomato sauce instead of the soup. Not sure if i would make this again.

My husband says this recipe is better than his Mom's!  Followed it to a tee, and it was delicious.  Froze half of the peppers uncooked, and tasted just as good once I baked them as the original.

Followed the recipe but added a little extra cheese on top at the end as someone had suggested, my husband and I both enjoyed a lot!! Nice for something a little different than the usual.  Will definetly make again, might spice it up a tad.

My family really enjoyed this stuffed pepper recipe. The best part about this one is the peppers are not mushy when the dish is ready to serve.

I have made this three times now because my hubby loves it.  I never cared for my mother's so I went to my favorite website and found this!  I add about 1-2 tablespoons worcestershire sauce and some hot sauce to the burger mix.  We really like it with sweet corn mixed in too.  I use the red, yellow and orange peppers from Costco for a lighter pepper flavor.

Bland.  Tastes like a green pepper and plain ole' spaghetti sauce.  I've never had stuffed peppers before so I think I'll try one more time but take the suggestions of other reviewers.

Had not had stuffed green peppers for a long time, but my wife and I really enjoyed this recipe. The only thing I will change next time is to spice up the tomatoe soup.

This was an ok recipe.  I was not too thrilled with the tomato soup.  I am just used to ragu I guess. Also you need to boil the peppers longer, it says to boil for 5 min.  I did 6 and they were still a bit hard.  Next time I may just follow this recipe and use ragu instead.

I used a Spanish Rice mixture and added it to the ground beef (I did not cook the ground beef first) then topped it all with tomato soup then the last 5 minutes I added cheddar cheese to the peppers they were very good. Hubby just loved them!

This is a good recipe, but I changed it a bit. I also used beef broth instead if water in the beef mixture. I also added to the stuffing a can corn, some chilli pepper, and a lot of red pepper flakes. I love my food really spicey, this was a great recipe to have fun with. Thanks

Wonderful recipe! My only suggestion is to either buy seasoned tomato soup or season it before you add it on the peppers.

This was very tasty! I made a few minor changes: I used ground turkey rather then beef, I boiled the peppers a bit longer because i like them softer, I used the basil seasoned diced canned tomatoes, added garlic/italian seasoning & a bit of red pepper spices, instead of using the full 2 cans of soup as topping i mixed half of one can in meat mix, upped the rice to 3/4 cup instant rice and added about 1/2 cup of corn. Now that i type it out it seems like a lot more changes but it really wasn't. All in all it was a very enjoyable easy meal.

This recipe was very good although I did increase the amount of diced tomato (basil, garlic & oregano)by one cup, as well as using a whole onion and added 2 teaspoons of minced garlic and used beef base instead of water and increased the amount of rice by 1/3 cup to offset the extra liquid found in the added diced tomatoes.  Everybody loved it- will make again.

These are tasty,filling and easy. I added some chopped jalapenos and balanced it out with finely chopped red delicious apples. Good stuff. Next time I'm gonna try it with some ground venison or bison.

These were almost perfect. I didnt like the additional tomato soup...it made it too tangy for my liking. Other than that, they were excellent!

Great recipe - I modified - I used 1 lb ground chicken and 1/3 lb of ground sausage to lighten it but ensure it still had flavor.  I also used italian diced tomatoes and added garlic, a little ginger, and additional spices to ensure that there was plenty of flavor since I substituted the ground chicken.

This was good.  My husband loved it.  I did some changes.  I only hsd one can of tomato soup.  So I use a big can of crushed tomato most of it in the sauce and the rest in the soup.  I added garlic and italian seasoning some red pepper.  I think I will pre cook rice some and cut peppers in half next time.  I had 5 large peppers and they were not full.  I also used Turkey.  Next time I will put Greek seasoning in lamb and maybe some feta or white cheese.  WIthout the seasoning tho and the extra stuff I don't think I would have liked this much.

fabulous! i used red peppers instead of green (because i like them better) which gave it a sweeter taste.  used part of the cheddar cheese to top the peppers before baking and also used corn in the stuffing which was great!
very good recipe :)

This was my first try at stuffed peppers and it was a big hit with my husband. I did not cook the peppers before stuffing and I used red, yellow and orange peppers-which were mild and delecious.

Good basic recipe.  I had 8 large peppers, so I doubled the filling and soup/sauce.  I used cans of roasted diced tomatoes and garlic, and still wished I had added some more garlic - but that's probably just my personal taste. I also added cheese on top for the last 10 minutes in the oven.

I made this for my boyfriend who was craving the stuffed peppers his mom used to make.  They turned out great!  I did add some italian seasoning to the filling, but otherwise followed the recipe.

I found the ratio of peppers to meat mixture to be way off.  I had enough meat to fill only 4 green peppers.  I made several changes and these turned out good.  Like others suggested I used 1 can petite diced tomatoes.  I used 3/4 cup cooked rice and I did not use water.  I used 1/2 cup beef broth.  I used approx. 2 tbls. of a homemade spaghetti sauce seasoning I have to season the meat also.  To fill the peppers I cut them long-ways to make "boats" to more even out the ratio of pepper to filling as some others suggested.  That worked very well!  I added extra cheese on top. Although the recipe was good, I decided I am just not a big cooked green pepper fan.  I will keep this recipe for the meat mixture.  As I made it it was fantastic on its own!  Now just have to find a use for it!!

Wonderful.. Tastes just like how mom used to make it. Needs just a little more spices added to it. Great recipe... Plus they look great to serve to guest.

I'm not a big fan of green peppers, but im giving it five stars anyway cuz I know that if I did like them I know I would be all about this recipe! My husband loved it! I used saffron yellow rice to add more flavor, and I cooked the rice in a different pot while I was cooking the hamburger and onions in another to save time.

Absolutely fabulous!  I added a bit of garlic with the ground beef, used petite diced tomatoes, Jasmine rice and didn't have any Worchester...so left it out.  My husband called me at work to tell me how good they were.  I don't care for peppers, but I ate these ones - unbelievably delicious!

The flavor was right on for me...my daughter did not care for it so much, though.

I never knew stuffed green peppers required so much work.

I had instant rice on hand so I modified the recipe.  After cooking the peppers in water, I browned the meat, onion, and I used stewed tomatoes.  Since I omitted most of the salt in the recipe, I increased the worcestshire sauce to 2T.  Using instant rice allowed me to simmer the tomatoes covered for only five minutes.  (I didn't have to bake it in the oven.) Then, I added the cheese.  Very tasty.

This recipe was so good that even the kids wanted seconds!  I made a few changes...I forget to add the worstechire sauce... I added chopped zucchini... and I cooked the rice seperately and then added it to the ground turkey mixture... I used fresh tomatoes from the garden instead of canned.  I only needed one can of tomato soup.  This was so yummy we will be making it again and again. THANK YOU!!!

An excellent dish, that my family realy enjoyed. The tomato soup gave the peppers a sweetness we liked. We had left overs, reheated the meal on the third day. I did not think it is possible, but the dish was even better than on the first day. Thank you for sharing this recipe. It will be a favorite around here.

Very good!  The peppers came out so nice and tender and flavorful.  Followed the recipe except for using fresh garden tomatoes instead of canned, slicing the pepper on the vertical and sprinkling extra cheddar on top before baking.  Next time I am going to add more rice and possibly some garlic and corn.

Easy, awesome, gone. When you walked into the house, your mouth started to water. These are amazingly good.... I only changed one thing, and that is I added some tomato soup after I filled up the peppers part way. Will make again and again.

Great recipe. I cut peppers in half then fill with the meat/rice mixture. I sprinkle additional cheese on the top for the last few minutes of baking.

These were excellent.  I did not cook peppers in boiling water.  I filled them raw and they came out of the oven a little crunchy - really good.  I did add some italian seasoning to the beef mixture.  I also added 1/2 can tomato bisque soup to the beef mixture.  I used the other 1 1/2 cans to make the gravy that went over the peppers.  Instead of water I mixed the tomato soup with some milk.  Before filling green peppers I put 1/2 slice swiss cheese in bottom.  After baking 25-30 minutes I put a slice on top and baked til melted.   Another success for my husband.

Best recipe I've found.  I usually use Rotel to make it a bit spicier and Uncle Ben's Rice for the stuffing.

This was great.  My family said it was "slamming".  I added sazon, adobo, chopped garlic and Mrs. Dash Herb blend.  For the sauce I added can of Rotel Tomatoes w/diced green chilies. Try it this way.  I'm sure you'll really enjoy it.

I really wasn't a fan of this recipe at all. I thought it was bland and I made alterations too. The original recipe would have been too bland. My substitutions: I used ground turkey instead of beef, added 1 tsp of garlic powder, one small can of green chilis, substituted tomato soup for spicy ranchero tomato soup by campbells, substituted pepper jack cheese for cheddar and added about 8 drops of hot sauce. I precooked the rice to avoid undercooking. Also, I used only 5 bell peppers because I would have run out of filling with six.

I don't think I'll make this recipe again. I just wasn't impressed.

mmmmmm, these stuffed peppers are delicious! the only changes i made was to saute about a teaspoon of minced garlic in with the onion & sprinkle a little extra cheddar cheese over top. instant brown rice worked well here too. note: the bell peppers at my store were huge so i only bought 3 of them, added 3 minutes to the parboiling time & 10 minutes to the baking time. thanks for this very yummy recipe suzanne!

My husband and kids turned up their noses when I said we were having stuffed peppers for dinner.  After dinner five out of six said that they would like to have these again.  Personally, I loved them.

Great recipe!  I followed the recipe, using whole green peppers that I had frozen.  Preboiling the peppers made them nice and soft.  I used long grain white rice, and I cooked the meat/rice mixture for about 20-25 minutes.  The rice was soft. The only thing I may change is that I may add a little garlic the next time.  Otherwise, my husband and I thought they were very good.

This was my first time making stuffed peppers. They came out great. We are not huge salt fans, however next time I would use a little more. I adding Cheddar cheese on top of each pepper for presentation. yummy!

I never got to eat one - I got a bad cold the night I made them and by the time i was well enough, my husband had eaten them all (for lunch, etc) He gave it 4 stars and said it would be GREAT as comfort food in the winter. Cant wait to try them!! ;)

My husband would have probably given it a five. I added jalapeno peppers and three cloves of garlic, and used red and green bell peppers to stuff them. I used a can of italian chunky tomatoes, and used a cube of beef buillon. I used spicy red pepper pasta sauce instead of tomato soup.

Boyfriend and I loved the recipe. Changed some things as other reviews suggested. Added one Tbls. Chili Powder, one Tbls. Onion Powder, and some fresh mushrooms in the filling . I cooked rice before adding to filling because have had problems with rice not being completely done in past stuffed pepper recipes.

This was my first time cooking and tasting stuffed peppers.  I halved the recipe to 3 peppers.  I enjoyed the taste, and they did not require a lot of work.  However, my mom, who is a huge fan of stuffed peppers, felt they were too bland and missing the traditional spice of this dish (which is true based on how they tasted.)

These were much better than the recipe I have been using.  I would not change any proportions (rice or sauce).  Here are a few tips for saving time.  I used a can of diced tomatoes and frozen chopped onions. I also used 4 big red peppers, cut then in half length-wise, put them in my baking dish with about 1/2 cup water, covered with foil and steamed them in the oven for about 10-15 minutes while I was making the filling.  Saves a dish, and more intense flavor.  I might add some red pepper flakes next time.

Not bad1  I liked it, but it was a tad bland (we used to have these with pork breakfast sausage in them instead of ground beef when I was younger), but nothing a little salt and pepper did not fix!  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef.  I htink that next time I will try adding seasoned salt to see if that boosts the flavor, or possibly mixing the ground turkey with italian sausage.  It was a good starting opint for me and so I will definitely keep this one and keep tweaking it until I get it to where I think it is perfect!

Very good stuffed peppers!  I used red bell peppers since I like them better, and I used extra sharp cheddar cheese.  I really liked the flavor the cheese gave it.  I will make these again.  Thanks!

I used two 10oz cans of tomato sauce instead of the whole peeled tomatoes, skipped the rice, and used an entire onion... it came out wonderful!

Wonderful recipe.  I was trying to find one that my mom used when I was a child and this is it. She used her own homemade tomato soup but Campbell's works too.  I loved them and so did my family.

This is a great recipe. I, too, added some extra spices to the ground beef mixture, including chopped garlic, to suit our tastes. I also added extra cheese on top (appealing presentation, too). Husband loved this recipe.  Will definitely make this again! Thanks!

WOW!!  Went veggie with this one and substituted the ground beef for sauted mushrooms. Served as a side dish with pork roast.  The peppers were not overpowering, you tasted every ingredient.  What a terrific recipe!

These were so easy!  The second time I made them I used 1/2 lb hamburger and 1/2 lb sausage, and only used one can of tomato soup.  They must have been good, because my kids even ate them!

This was pretty good.  I'm not a huge fan of bell peppers in particular, but overall I'd give it two thumbs up.  I didn't have a can of whole peeled tomatoes so I used a can of stewed tomatoes.  I also added some shredded cheese to the top just about 5 minutes before pulling them out of the oven.  The hubby said "very good, but less tomato sauce next time" (little did he know it was tomato soup!), but he's not a big fan of anything tomato.  Regardless, I'll probably use just one can of tomato soup next time.

My husband told me to throw out any other stuffed pepper recipe I had!  The only changes were that I cut the peppers in half lengthwise (easier to stuff!) and just use one can of soup.

This recipe was very good! I added minced garlic to the meat and onions while they were cooking and substituted 8 Tablespoons of Parmesan cheese for the 1 cup of cheddar (to cut down on some of the fat content). I also used spaghetti sauce instead of the canned tomato soup.  It turned out very good. I will definitly make this again.

Delicious!  My husband and I enjoyed it very much.  Of course, the kids won't give it a fair shake, same as I wouldn't have eaten this as a kid.  Have some extra ground beef on hand to make them hamburgers.  I left out the salt as there is plenty in many of the ingredients already.

I added thyme and italian seasoning to the mixture.  I also used cooked rice and just added once the meat was cooked.  I use marinara sauce on top of the peppers and this was excellent

Very easy to make.  My Husband made these one night and it went rather quickly.  After eating the mentioned that next time he would add less Worcestshire sauce.  I looked at the recipe and he had added 1/2 cup instead of 1 teaspoon!!! Ha ha!!  Next time if we make these in advance I will encourage him to put the cheese on right before we reheat them so it melts nicely.

If you want to add some additional flavor, use Spanish Rice instead of white rice.  Also I add mushrooms, a dash of garlic and green diced chilis for added flavor.

This was great!!!  I had never made stuffed peppers before and this was exactly what I was looking for.  The meat mixture has a really savory taste and was delicious - The only thing I did differently was to chop up the tops of the peppers and add them to the beef while browning, I also added a little extra cheese (yum!!).  I did add the tomato soup but didn't think it really added much to the flavor, but didn't take away from it either - which is why only four stars, but otherwise, a quick and delicious recipe!

This recipe was simple and fast! I cooked fresh tomatoes with some EVOO (to equal canned amount) with the onion and beef.  I also added one beef boullion cube to the simmering mixture, and a pinch of saffron for color.  Very delicious!

I thought this recipe was very good.  My only problem was that the green peppers i got were huge!  I decided I'd follow someone's suggestion on steaming them, they were nice and soft, but my peppers fell apart!  I think it was partially my fault though cus i cooked a few of them too long.  I used minute rice instead of regular rice, and I also added cheese to the bottom. Once I took it out of the oven, one of my peppers had completely fallen apart, but it still tasted great with a side of mashed potatos. :)

Pretty great!  They were even great a couple of days later when reheated.  Only small problem was that the rice was not quite soft in some of the peppers, still good though.

Just delicious! I used my homegrown bell peppers and tomatoes (with added tomato juice) in place of the canned tomatoes. I think 35 minutes at 350 wasn't enough time. I'll add 10 minutes when I make this again.

Yum! My favorite stuffed pepper recipe so far. I added some garlic with the onions and increased the rice and water to 3/4c.  I had wondered about the tomato soup on top, but it was the perfect balance. A keeper!

I was out of ground beef, so I used chopped cooked chicken instead!  My husband and kids really liked it (I hate green peppers).  I also chopped up the tops of the peppers and added it to the mixture.  I will definitely make this again, but on a day I won't be home for supper :)
Great recipe--easy to make!

This was a wonderful recipe.  However, the rice required more like 25 minutes to get tender, and I needed to add about 1/2 cup more liquid. (I used tomato sauce).  Next time,I'll probably double the amount of rice,(I didn't think there was enough), and use instant.  Also, I used  diced tomatoes (undrained).  Even the kids, who don't usually like green peppers, enjoyed it!

These were good, but I simmered the filling about 10-15 minutes longer than directed because the rice wasn't cooking, so I just decided to bake them thinking the rice would soften and it didn't.  I might try again, maybe.

These peppers were great! My husband who says he hates stuffed peppers ate three and our one year old cleaned his entire bowl (we didn't give him the pepper but just the filling) two times! I think the cheese made it much better then the recipe I tried once before.

I will be using this again as soon as there are more peppers in the garden.

My family truly enjoyed this recipe-so did I! I followed the advice of other reviewers and added additional rice and water, but it still took well over 15mins for the rice to cook. We served it over the additional rice from the recipe and corn on the cob (for the kids!).

This was an easy recipe.  I've never made stuffed peppers before.  Hubby really liked it but I thought the amount of tomato soup was a bit much, next time I'll cut that down to just one can.  Otherwise it was very good, will make this dish again!  =)

Great recipe ! They really hit the spot. I enjoy cooking special meals for one of my girlfreind's and her children. The kids loved it. Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe Suzanne.
NOTE : I have made Stuffed Green Peppers on about 3 occasions now and each time my rice never gets completely tender.

Really good! I might also add garlic next time. Very tasty! Can't wait for leftovers. I did make mine with ground sirloin. I'll try it next with turkey. Yum Yum.
p.s. I was so excited I forgot to put cheese in the mixture...On top of the peppers was great too!

What a hit in my home!  My daughter is very picky and loved it!  I did mine with half ground sausage and half ground beef.

Never tried a stuffed green pepper with cheese!  This was very good!  Tastes good with corn on the side!

This was the first time that I have made stuffed peppers and they were wonderful!  My mother-in-law raved about them and my two year old loved them as well!
