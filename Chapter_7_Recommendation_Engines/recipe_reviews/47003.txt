I was searching for ideas for my Husband's surprise "OVER THE HILLbilly" party when I stumbled upon this. The reviews were good so I didn't even give it a test taste. Made almost 5 gallons and put it in a new gas can for easy pouring. Everyone LOVED it. I probably doubled the Barcardi just to use up the bottle and it was still tasty-not too strong. Only a little bit left and the Birthday Boy has dibs on that this weekend! Thanks for the fun!

This booze recipe was potent...I know why they call it Hillbilly "Punch"...I got to get a bit smart with the wife after a few and she hauled off and punched me!  Overall a good buzzer.

Tastes great, BUT stop after about 3 drinks if you want to remember the rest of the night!  Very sweet and not a strong liquor taste, so it is great for someone that does not like a strong alcohol tast.

This is SO SO GOOD!  We "auditioned" many different alcoholic beverages to serve as a signature drink for our wedding - this won and people raved about it!!!

Was a huge hit at bbq/grillout. Would not sip this normally, b/c it's really sweet. For an outdoor occassion it was great and went well with the foods too. I made a huge pitcher and put lime and orange slices in it - the pitcher was empty within 1 hour!!!!!!!!!!

I don't know if it's the mason jar or what, but I love this!  It makes me think of summer and bluegrass festivals.  This is not my style of drink, at all, but I'm really enjoying it.  I feel like this is a drink that could make most anyone happy (and if not, just keep drinking them...you'll get there ;) ).  THANKS for the recipe, Suz G!

Changed the recipe for what I had on hand -  1 oz. Mt. Gay Rum 1 oz. Peach Schnapps 1 oz. amaretto 1 1/2 cups blueberry juice cocktail 1 cup lemon lime soda  ***** Refreshing on a HOT summer day!  Might mix with tonic water or even club soda to reduce the sweetness a bit.

Wonderful!  I made this for a July 4th BBQ, and even my friends who don't drink tried it and loved it.  My "redneck" boyfriend loves it and is happy to have a special Hillbilly drink. Thank you for this recipe!

This was very good. I changed the serving amount to 15, as I was making it for a BBQ, and made in a large pitcher.

Very good! I'd give it 4.5 stars if that were an option. I made a lower calorie version using lite cranberry juice and Sprite Zero.  It was good as-is on the first day, better on the second day.  And better still with the addition of an equal share of coconut rum.  Yum!  Will be taking this to a 4th of July cookout this weekend  =)

Been our new favorite, "Sip by the pool" drink for over a year now. We switched Peach Vodka for the Peach Schnapps to cut some calories off and tone down the sweetness, and it tastes the same!

We used sprite zero and didn't think it was too sweet, but it is a sweet drink. It is a perfect evening beverage for a hot day!

Awesome! I had to sub Bacardi Razz for the rum & peach schnapps as they didn't have any peach liquor or liquer here. I used a bit less juice and pop, and threw in frozen raspberries, strawberries and cherries. Was a big hit and we'll definately make it again! Thanks!!

Exactly what I was looking for! Sweet, summery, fruity. Maybe a tiny bit too sweet for some people, but you can sub diet soda or some plain cranberry juice. I made it probably fifteen minutes ago, so I can't attest to the alcohol effects, but except for a faint peach flavor of the cheap schnapps I used, there is no alcohol flavor. Yum!

UGH...this is way too sweet.  Not a bad flavor though.
