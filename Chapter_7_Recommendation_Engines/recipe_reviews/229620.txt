Why the separate skillets for the onions and garlic? Cook them together for the most flavor  - just don't put the garlic in until the potatoes are getting close to done.  The onions get a little browned and crunchy and make this dish beyond yummy.

In love with this recipe and have been making it for years! Along with the garlic and onions, had some chives in my garden so I added that too. Thanks for sharing!

That's a lot of butter. I cut the butter in half and cook the onions and garlic in with the potatoes. And there's no need to use two pans

Very good.  Make sure to salt after it's done cooking.  I seasoned with garlic powder, onion powder, paprika and when done cooking I topped with a little parmesan.

Been doing basically this forever.  Learnt from my Mom who had a tight budget and little time.  If boiling potatoes the first night, she cooked extra. Next night cubed  and fried them with onion, garlic and Thyme.  As they were already cooked, they needed less butter.  We fried them till potatoes were golden, then added bread crumbs to soak up extra butter.  Cooked till we scraped the pan . Optional sprinkle of paprika or cayenne for colour.  Great.

These would have been great except too garlicky and took away from the fried potato tatste. I did microwave the cubed potaoes first and the texture was perfect. Just wish I left out the garlic!

These are good. But better are using potatoes that have already been cooked (baked). 
When I bake potatoes I make extra so that I can fry them. The taste is way better.

Added the garlic last like 2 chefs mentioned....that is best so it doesn't burn. Added Garlic Powder, Parmesan, Salt & Pepper.

We make these whenever we go camping.  The first night we cook a whole bag of salt potatoes (small potatoes cooked in salt water that a are a Syracuse specialty) and eat half of them with dinner.  The next morning, we dice them up and cook them this way but use some oil and cut the butter.  They come out crispy and not too greasy.  We are not garlic people and think salt and pepper are enough.

Easy and absolutely delicious. I loved them more than those I get from restaurants. My children gobbled these up without a drop of ketchup(that's typically a must have with their potatoes). They may be fattening but it was well worth it!

Turned out perfect! I did not add garlic or the onions . I did sprinkle a little  Paprika on for color. My family loved them and from now on this is how I am going to fry my potatoes , No such thing as too much butter.

try cutting the potato in 3 pieces and boil for about 10 minutes then cut up the potato it cooks faster in less butter.

Rather than cook the garlic and onions separate as recommended I put everything together so the flavors could meld. Everyone loved them...especially my husband!

These were awesome!  I didn't add the garlic since I served them with a garlicky dish and didn't want to overwhelm anyone.  I just added the onion with the potatoes right from the beginning.

It was good. I added red pepper to give it some colour as well as some dried parsley. Unfortunately, I found the potatoes way too greasy! Next time I make it, I will definitely cut the butter by half!

I love this recipe, but I don't use a separate skillet, and this time I switched out butter for coconut oil!  Since I didn't have an onion, I substituted it with onion powder. I also add a little salt, oregano, and parsley flakes. So delicious!
