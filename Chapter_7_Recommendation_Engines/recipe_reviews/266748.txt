As written these did not work for me and ended up in the trash. Sorry. I had high hopes but they never would crisp up. I even let them go another 10 minutes before flipping and they were so soggy that all of the breading mushed and fell off.  The one side that retained most all of the breading never crisped up either and the majority of them still had the powdery flour surface. I've made plenty of zucchini chips in the oven so I'm not really sure what the problem is other than no egg. I loved the addition of cornmeal so I might try these again. I'm not vegan and will be using an egg if I do. I also think that it would benefit to slice the zucchini and let it drain a bit before spraying it with the non-stick.

I’m not vegan but this is a very good recipe. I made as the recipe directs. It didn’t specify on the thickness of the rounds. I found the thinner the rounds the better. They cooked up crispy and were absolutely delicious!
