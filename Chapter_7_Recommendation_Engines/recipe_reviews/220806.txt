I was so excited when I found this recipe, I ran right out and bought the ingredients to make it.  I wish I could say I was thrilled with the result, but I wasn't.  The cupcakes were extremely dense and heavy.  And they were not sweet like regular cupcakes.  I had never used sucanat before and I recommend anyone who likes sweet cupcakes to use a standard sugar.  The curd and frosting were fine, but overall no one in my family liked them very much.

I wasn't really sure about these because of the mixed reviews.  I made them once using an all purpose GF baking mix and they were ok.  But I could tell they had potential.  So I made them again with the baking mix it specifies in the recipe (see notes)- with coconut flour, arrowroot, etc and that made all the difference!!  They were absolutely amazing!  I am guessing the negative reviews used a different flour blend and then I could see the results being unpredictable.  Seriously- make these cupcakes- they are delicious- but use the flour blend they recommend.

Made these for a friend who was diagnosed with Celiac's disease.  Had to taste test to make sure they were decent and was actually very pleased!  These were very tasty considering they are gluten free.  The frosting was very lovely and lemony!

This was my first attempt at making anything gluten-free and they were a huge hit at a party! I used fat-free ricotta cheese and 1/3 less fat cream cheese. It was so moist we had to eat them with forks!

These cupcakes turned out very dense and heavy and with a gross after taste (licorice).  The cupcakes ended up in the trash; however, the frosting was wonderful!  3 stars because the frosting was great.

Mine came out very dense and heavy, taste is pretty good. I think if I made them again I would play around with the recipe a bit

These were so delicious.  I cut the frosting recipe in half and put on less and I thought they were fine that way.  Thanks for sharing
