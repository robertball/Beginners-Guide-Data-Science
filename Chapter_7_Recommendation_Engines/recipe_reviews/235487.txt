Yum! I was looking for something quick and different and came upon this. We love eggs, and this was a great way to make them into a tasty dinner. I made 5: 2 for me and 3 for my husband. Added a little mozzarella on top and served with crusty bread. Will definitely make it again!

Very good recipe! We love making pasta meatless, & I love how this can add protein to the meal easily, & cheaply! We are making this again.

We have an excess egg problem lol, so I went looking for different meals to try. This was a really tasty and different light lunch! Easy to make as well, followed the recipe exactly. I will make it again.

I reduced the quantity to make it for 2.  My husband was very skeptical, but we both liked it.  I served it with rice which went well with it.

I let the eggs simmer in the sauce for 8 minutes instead of 10 for a  better texture.  It's quick and easy, and always gets rave reviews!

This is  an amazing recipe! I was a bit septic about the combination of eggs and tomato sauce.  My meat & potatoes  husband and mother-in-law  loved it.  It will be added  to the dinner  rotation.  I served it over spaghetti  squash that I drizzled  a little  olive oil over it and added some basil and oregano.
