I absolutely love this soup. It turned out perfect. To the person who posted about the soup being gritty, it's because the potatoes were over cooked. The only time that ever happens is if the potatoes to cooked for to long. They still need to be slightly firm. Another review about the sour cream seperating. If your flour, butter and milk becomes to hot and then you add cold sour cream to it you can curdle it and that can cause seperation. Food for thought. :) Delicious soup.

We loved this soup.  I noticed too that it wasn't as thick as I like potato soup so I added a little cornstach/water mixture and that helped. I did not have onions on hand but I did have green onions so I added those to the potatoes and had them boil with the potatoes( I boiled the potatoes instead of microwaving them), because I do not like crunchy onions in my soup. But it really did taste like a baked potato.  I topped it with crumbled bacon and extra cheese.  We will be making this allot for those cold winter nights. It is a great comfort food!

This didn't work out for me at all-I followed the recipe to a T and the consistency of the soup was gritty.

What a disappointment!  I usually always read the reviews before investing time and money into a recipe.  I also do not change any ingredients and then rate the recipe.  If you change ingredients, you have made a totally different recipe and it is not fair to rate!  Anyhow, I followed the recipe per directions with the exception of boiling potatoes instead of microwaving.  Everything seemed great until I added the sour cream.  The sour cream separated from the soup and was a big mess!  Neither my husband nor I could get through it.  Threw the whole pan out.  I wouldn't suggest this recipe to anyone - big waste of time!!

This recipe was great!  I improvised a little and here were my changes:
After adding the milk to the butter/flour cooked mixture (or roux), I added the seasoning packet from Uncle Ben's Long Grain & Wild Rice (the Original Recipe). It has 23 Herbs and Seasoning and made quite a tasty addtion to the flavor of this soup!  I added 1 cup of cheddar cheese instead of 1/2 cup too.  Other than those additions, I kept the recipe the same.  It was sooooooooooooo good!  Then I served it with real bacon bits and cheddar cheese on the side for those who wanted to add them.  It was a hit and I will make this again for sure.  Next time I want to add some cut up and cooked baby carrots to add more color and vitamins.

The recipe does have a few flaws.  But if fixed this soup is a 5 star soup.  I made it for my family and it was a big hit.  First of all I prefer to boil the cubed potatoes vs microwaving them.  They can cook while you do step 2.  Second, after melting the butter, saute the onions until they are translucent and very soft.  This will take the crunch factor out and add lots of flavor to the party.  Third, when you whisk in the flour, continue whisking and cooking for a few minutes or until it is a blonde color.  You're making a roux and it won't properly thicken the soup unless cook the flour.  Once finished I served with an extra small dollop of sour cream, cheese, scallions and real bacon bits.  Not great on the waist, I know, but oh so good.

Baked potato soup is a favorite at our house.  It is always the first soup I make of the year.  I try to use left over baked potatoes to save some time.  I also like to mash some of the potatoes and leave some chunked to get a better consistency.

This was a pretty good potato soup and I will add it to my collection.  I boiled the potatoes instead of microwaving and next time I think I will add the onions in with them.  They were a little crunchy.  Also, I don't recommend boiling milk.  It curdles a little and it has to be stirred constantly or it burns.  I would say this soup took more like 45 mins. to prepare.

Oh my gosh! This is the best-tasting (reminiscent of the Loaded Potato Soup at O'Charley's) and easiest potato soup recipe I've ever made! I took it one step further and added broccoli and bacon bits to he soup while it was cooking. My husband and my three children (all picky eaters) love it!

This is just plain WONDERFUL!  I doubled the recipe which makes a lot, so I gave some to family and they loved it too.  I put in more onions and put them in the milk while it was cooking; I added a package of instant garlic & herb mashed potatoes which thickened it more, I put in some garlic powder and I added a lot more cheese cause it makes a killer cheesey potato soup.  You can't just fix this and leave it on the stove, you have to stick with it, but it's worth it.  It has endless possibilities for those of you who are creative.  Best of all, I learned to fix potates without getting them too soft by microwaving them, now I can make potato salad!  Thank you Claire, this one is a real jewel!

This recipe is good, but I rarely cook anything without putting my own twist on it.  In this case I felt the base was a little bit bland so I added some garlic to taste and I added about 2 cups of sharp cheddar cheese instead of the half cup called for.  To avoid the separation issue with the sour cream I added it before the milk reached boiling and ended up with a smooth creamy base that did not curdle or separate.  Then I added the onions and let them cook a little longer than called for.  Finally I added the potatoes and the 2 cups of cheese.  Topped with a little pile of bacon crumbles, more cheddar and some green onion tops.  Turned out to be excellent!

Everyone absolutely loved this recipe.  I agree with the previous post about the sour cream separating though.  I think next time, I'll just put spoonfuls of sour cream in each serving.

My entire family loved this recipe. I would recommend letting the soup cool slightly before adding the cheese or it will burn to the bottom. Also, I gave my family chopped green onion, cheese, and bacon bits as possible toppers for the soup.

This was a great soup!  My husband, who doesn't eat potato soup, absolutely loved it!  The sour cream and cheese were the big difference in an otherwise bland soup.  I did use a lot more cheese, however: for the normal recipe I increased it to 2 cups and also added 1 tsp of dill weed.  I made double the recipe and it disappeared in two days.  Thanks!

I did make some changes based on preference, but this was fantastic!  After adding the milk, I added 2 chopped garlic cloves and 2 veg bouillon cubes.  And I substituted dried chives for the onion.  Very, very good, and very versatile.  Thanks!

Oh yeah!  This is what I was looking for, as my entire family is just sick & tired of beef (due to the fact that we eaten it everyday for the past week) this was a nice change.  I think that next time I will add bacon as well.  I found that by using the fine or fancy shredded cheese elimanates the "grittyness" (well it did for me anyway).  YUM, thanks Claire!!

This was so delicious! I'm a college student and I made it for 15 or so of my closest guy friends and they loved it! Instead of using regular baking potatoes(peeled) I used red roasting potatoes that i put in the oven at 400degrees with a little bit of olive oil and some different seasonings. If you leave the skin on and cut them up in to not too small pieces the soup is soooo hardy! Serve with plenty of bacon and cheese! Oh and pick up a french baget from the bakery...its probably the BEST potato soup I've ever had!

With not much time left before lunch, this recipe caught my eye.  Microwaving the potatoes worked ok for me in a pinch.  I stirred frequently and tossed them in a little butter to keep them from sticking together so much.  I also sprinkled them with salt, pepper, & garlic powder for flavor.  I used 1/2 milk & 1/2 chicken broth and added bacon and extra cheese.  I liked the texture.  Reviewers wanting more of a mashed potato texture might try mashing some of the potatoes before adding to the soup base.

Some curious reviews.  Your basic potato soup is very bland so I look for something that has some difference.  For this one, I think the sour cream and cheese are what did it, and I agree that no more than salt & pepper are needed.  (Though the white pepper idea sounded good.)  It wasn't "great" but it was pretty good & not just the normal bland.  I didn't use the onions but everything else was as is.  I did boil the potatoes, cause I think microwaved turn out badly.  I simmered it longer than it said.  This is one of those times I can't help but address some comments.  Yes, it makes a lot - it does say 12 servings.  (Although if you want a good bowlful like for lunch, it's more like 8-10 servings.)  Don't know about the grittiness unless that's caused by nuking the potatoes.  You also have to take things like "add gradually" literally, which can make a big difference.  EDIT:  Just made this again & would have given it a 3, but I generally don't knock a score down unless I can come to a concensus.  But this time I have to agree w/the review that said it tasted like warmed milk & potatoes.  Just seemed to have zero flavor no matter what I added to it.

I have been making this soup for a couple of years. I just decided to write a review and to see what others were saying. This soup is the best.  I always make it a day ahead so the flavors blend together.  I add chopped green onion to the soup and serve it with green onion and bacon bits.
Whenever there is a family get together I am asked to bring this soup.

This was a great soup and really easy. I used 8 oz. of Velveeta as a subsitute for the cheese and WOW. I thought this was a big batch to freeze but we ended up eating the whole pot in two days.

This turned out great for my family!! My husband, who I found out later didn't like these types of soups, actually went back for seconds, so I consider that a win! Things I did differently: 1) I boiled the potatoes in salt water instead of microwaving them. 2) I added the onion to the butter in the beginning to soften them and help release liquid and flavor for adding the flour. 3) I had the milk/butter/flour mixture simmer on low while stirring a little longer to reach my desired consistency. The extra time also helps some of the "raw flour taste" cook out better and prevents milk curdling. 4) GARLIC! The original recipe is good enough, but there is always room for garlic in our book. I added a few teaspoons of minced garlic when I added the onion. 5) I DID NOT add the sour cream nor the cheese until the soup was served up and ready to head to the table. That way, my husband and son could add each ingredient to their tastes. 6) I also added some fresh chopped green onions and crumbled bacon to the top. Again to each person's taste at the end. Since my cooking changes involved a little more time, this brought the cooking time to about 45 minutes to an hour, but the results were WELL WORTH the effort. Anytime I can get my husband to love something he previously hated it is worth all the effort. Lol

This recipe is excellent! I did as others, and boiled potatoes first...also added onion to butter and sauteed before adding flour to rue. Otherwise..all measurements as stated. Turned out nice and creamy..not runny at all like others had problems with. YUMMY!

This soup is SO yummy! It is defidently one to tweak though. When whisking in the flour to the butter, you should mix the flour with some milk first so that you don't end up with flour chunks in the soup. I doubled the cheddar, added 16 oz. of bacon that I cooked minutes before hand, and used a cup and a half of onion instead of the measley 1/4 cup of onion suggested. Also, I added the potatoes and onions in with the milk so that they would cook completely. So worth it! It is so fast and easy to make, and (even with all of my additions!) cost  around $2 for each meal for each person in my family of five. And that's including the $4 worth of Italian bread we bought to eat with it! :)

Vey bland soup. I made this recipe just as it is, and it totally lacked flavor. Plus, it wanted to burn, I had to stir the stuff constantly. I liked the chowdery consistency, so it has potential, but it takes a lot of dressing up. Also, I recommend boiling the potatoes, they don't microwave well.

As previously suggested, I cut the recipe in half, but used twice the amount of potatoes.  I used leftover baked potatoes from the night before and placed the potatoes and the onion in a crockpot and then add the milk mixture over top and let it cook on low for about 1 1/2 hours.  I wasn't really watching as I made it mid-morning and it was for lunch.  I needed to add more milk as it cooked to prevent it from scorching and I used a potato masher to mash some of the chunks.  Toward the end of cooking time I added in the sour cream and the cheddar cheese.  Soup was served at the table with salt and pepper and more sour cream and cheese, but no one used anything other than the salt and pepper.  It was good, but I want to play around with the seasoning a bit.  Perhaps some white pepper, salt, and garlic added during cooking time might round out this otherwise rich and tasty soup.

My teenage daughter (who doesn't cook!) made this tonight, and WOW!  It was awesome!  Thick, creamy, hearty, and smooth.  She added broccoli.  We needed to add a bit of salt, and perfection in a bowl!  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This soup recipe was excellent and relatively easy. Since I didn't have the bacon bits, I added 2 tablespoons of bacon grease and we were blown away by the added flavor. My hubby & kids loved it.

I love potato soup, so I decided to attempt to make this.  Whew!  It was very creamy and thick and it was absolutely FULL of potatoes.  Definitely not a dish for someone trying to lose weight!  8-)  I maybe would have done things a little differently in that:  1.  this recipe makes a LOT - and I *mean* a LOT - of soup.  Cut the recipe to 4 servings and it still made way too much.  Also, I ended up having to simmer it a heck of a lot longer than 20 minutes for my preferred consistency - but otherwise, not bad.  Add PLENTY of cheddar cheese!  Next time I'll try bacon or ham to make it a bit zestier.  Thanks for the recipe!

It's a keeper! A wonderful thick and chunky soup! However, to prevent the soup from curdling, I did allow the mixture to cool off the burner for a little while before adding the cold sour cream and cheese. I think this also helped the soup to thicken up. Also, don't over-microwave your potato cubes, just cook until soft, but still hold their form. I also added a full cup of shredded cheese instead of 1/2 cup. Garnish with bacon bits, more shredded cheese and chives on top before serving and it looks great.

Delicious... for people who are finding it gritty: you are not making the roux correctly.

You must begin with low heat and the mixture must be stirred constantly to avoid scorching the flour. Start by melting the butter over low heat. When the foaming begins to subside, add the flour and stir constantly, watching the color of the mixture. It should become a light, nutty brown color. This may take five minutes or so. Do not go by the clock, but rather by the color. If the process is stopped too soon, while still white, it will taste like raw flour and be gritty. If it gets too brown, the flour has scorched and it will taste burnt. It's a science, really! :-)

Very good soup but, I had to make some alterations in order to say that.  I hate when people alter, then rate because rating should be based on the original recipe but, there was no way I was going to eat it as it was prior.  I took the advice of another poster and boiled the potatoes first then drained very well.  I also sauteed the onions to add more flavor to the soup and so they wouldn't have that "crunch" factor.  Even after all of that, the soup was very watery and unflavored.  I boiled it to thicken but it didn't work out as well as it should have.  Didn't want to burn it so I let it simmer, cool down a bit and then added chicken bullion, garlic powder, onion powder and pepper.  After adding the seasonings, it was delish.  I will def make again and will try the original again because it very well just be a bad day on my part.  Garnished with additional sour cream, shredded cheese, real bacon bits and scallions.

I thought this was pretty good.  I only used 6 cups of milk instead of 8 b/c I like my soup thicker.  I also added some Italian seasoning, garlic powder, and a bay leaf.  I did not add sour cream or cheese until I was serving the soup and also threw some hot sauce on it.  Instead of microwaving the potatoes, I boiled them with the onion.  Once tweaked, it was a good rainy day/cold weather soup.

I really liked this soup. I also boiled the potatoes instead of microwaving. Left them just a bit firmer than if I were mashing them. In hindsight, I would have let the sour cream come to room temp, though. I added slowly but it still was difficult to incorporate and get smooth. Didn't affect the taste but sometimes you live and learn. I would love a little more spice or even some cooked carrot shavings or tiny broccoli florets for options next time. But the recipe is great as is too.

This soup is delicious! I boil the potatoes instead of placing in microwave and after the soup is done, place in the crockpot on warm so the teenagers in our house can enjoy all afternoon and into the night.

I used this recipe for my first try at potato soup.  It was super easy to make and tasted incredible!!  The only thing I did different was add 2 cups of cheese instead of the 1/2 cup called for in the recipe, but I always add more cheese to everything.  We had four crock pots of soup going the day I served this and this one was almost empty at the end of the day.

I can't believe I've overlooked writing a review on this delicious soup, as I've been making it for years. I'm not a big fan of microwaving the potatoes, as they become sticky, however it works in a pinch. Fortunately, I haven't had the separation issue with the sour cream, however, I generally add only 8 oz as well as an entire block of cream cheese. I like the creaminess it adds, not to mention that it blends well too. Like others, I definitely spruce up this soup with spices to taste. I throw bacon bits right in the soup (along with a generous serving for garnishment), and extra cheese. I forgot to add that I always make sure to finely dice the onions. This soup is easy, yummy, and filling. As a working mom, I can't ask for much more. Served with a slice of garlic bread, this satisfies on a cold night.

Made this dish for the second time tonight! It was overall, EXCELLENT! I half the recipe since there are only two of us. It renders enough for second helpings, and 2 to 3 helpings for the next day too! I always toss in bacon bits into the soup itself, add a little more sour cream (yummy!) and cheddar cheese... I top it off with sour cream, cheese, green onions, and bacon bits! Perfection in a bowl! :)

My son said it was the best soup he'd ever had. I changed the recipe up a little. I nixed the onion and replaced with green onion. I doubled the recipe and in the finally prep with the sour cream I added 2 cups of cheddar cheese. Like other in this forum, I also boiled the potatoes first (but left firm). If you add pepper, I would suggest white pepper. Real bacon bits are a must, just get the one's from the salad section in your local store. My photo is the close-up of soup in the yellow bowl.

This soup is very bland and too sweet.  This is the first potato soup recipe I have ever tried that used only milk.  I like the flavor chicken broth brings to a potato soup.  Definately not worth the calories.

A very good start to potato soup.  I first tried it with just salt and pepper and it was much too bland.  Onion powder, garlic powder, and minced garlic were added and it was perfect.

This recipe is great as is, but sometimes I use canned diced potatoes or boiled potatoes. Microwaved potatoes tend to lose their shape and make the soup sort of grainy (IMHO). I'm not quite sure some reviewers have had problems with this soup. I would think most would understand that you need to add the sour cream after the soup has cooled slightly; don't add while soup is simmering or it could cause separation.

I didn't like this one. I was looking for a more mashed potato then chunky one.

Unfortunately, this was bland. I scaled the recipe back and followed recipe exactlyt, and then tasted it.  My first problem was my potatoes stuck together in a big clump after cooking (next time I will add a small amount of water).  Secondly, it was way too thick.  I had to add alot of extra milk to get it to a soup consistency.  I then added extra sour cream, and instead of more cheddar cheese, I added a jarred cheese dip to try and add flavor. Maybe this will taste better as a leftover.

I made the recipe exactly as given. Very quick & easy. The taste is good, but the soup overall is just OK. I don't really care for anything cooked in the microwave so I think boiling or even baking the potatoes until cooked would work better. Turned out a bit thicker than I care for and had to keep a close eye as it wanted to burn on the bottom of the pan. This makes a LOT of soup so if you're making for a small family I would definitely cut in half.

This recipe was a big hit for the 10 ladies I served it to yesterday. I do want to say the prep time is inaccurate, it is more like 30-45 min.

Really bland. It needed a LOT of bacon and sour cream to doctor it up. It just wasn't that great, in my opinion, and the potatoes definitely need to be boiled until they are soft.

This recipe is great. Skip the microwaving the potatoes and go boil them instead. I added broccoli and doubled the cheese, it is really thick and creamy.

Really good, but suggest not as much sour cream as it called for.  We don't use the sour cream at all & you don't miss it a bit!  Also, I put cheese on top rather than in it & bacon too.  My husband & I loved it & it was ready in no time at all!  VERY easy & yummy too!

Tastes just like Bennigan's restaurant loaded baked potato soup! We don't have one where I live so now I can make my own. I halfed the recipe. We still had leftovers for lunch the next day. Even better then!  The 2nd time I made it, I cut back the flour to 2 Tbsp (in halved recipe) so it would be less thick.  I also sauteed my onions in the bacon grease and added both to the pot with the milk. Serve topped with extra cheddar, scallions and chopped bacon and it doesn't get any better than this!

This was and INCREDIBLE soup!  My entire family LOVED it!  I made it it my biggest pot but couldn't put the entire amount of milk so I used 1 less cup of milk and added it to the leftovers.  I also added some bacon!  It did take longer than 7-10 minutes to microwave the potatoes though, but I almost think it would be better to boil them.  I think that's what I'll do next time!  MAKE THIS YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!

I thought this soup was excellent and my husband even loved it.  I did find I had to cook the potatoes a little longer, this would depend on your microwave oven.  I also used 8oz of brick cheese that I shredded and pureed 4 cups of the soup to thicken.  I would definitely make this again.  :)

Tried this the first time per the recipe, even though I had some reservations about it (which turned out to be justified), and it was only okay. The second time I made it, I revised it and it was a hit. To begin with, don't substitute margarine or oil for butter. Butter and milk mix well together, but margarine/oil doesn't. DO NOT boil/microwave the potatoes. A loaded potato at a steakhouse is never going to be microwaved. EVER! Double the cheddar, and stir it in BEFORE you stir in the potatoes and onion. Save the sour cream for absolute last. Stir that in and only heat through, don't boil. It's not going to curdle if the soup is really hot. Has it ever curdled in your piping hot baked potato? Of course not! It's just that if it's cooked for a length of time, it will be strange. Add crumbled cooked bacon and some extra cheese on top when serving, along with some chopped chives. That adds a tremendous flavor to it. Finally, when we have baked potatoes earlier in the week for dinner, I simply make extra potatoes (I buy them by the bag and invariably there are a bunch of small ones, those are my soup potatoes), wrap them up and put them in the refrigerator until soup day. A cold baked potatoes is super easy to cube and the flavor is still fresh once it's heated in the soup. Just throw them in cold and heat the soup as directed. Trust me, this is the way to go. Happy Eating!

To thicken your potato soup you can add mashed potatoes or instant flakes and instead of all that milk I use chicken broth and a can of evaporated milk, kids love it.

I used this recipe twice. 
First time I followed it thoroughly even though I knew there was a flaw - or a wrong phrasing mistake inducing. It was indeed blend and gritty. The flaw was temperature should be immediately lower when milk reaches boiling point and you NEVER boil cream (it curds).
Second time, I doubled the onions, added garlic, skipped the milk and used cornstach instead. I added the cream at the very last moment and carefully avoided boiling just before and after that. It was excellent.

Just find a different recipe. Neh. This is how I would describe this recipe. I guess I was expecting everything to be mixed together (bacon, cheese, scallions, etc.) I don't know if it was my fault, but I was expecting creamy. I got lumpy, starchy . :( I would recommend not wasting your time and effort. I mean, if you want to try it, go ahead. My experience wasn't good, and I won't be using this recipe again.

This soup recipe is awful. Not pleasing to the eye or palate. I almost dumped the entire pot in the trash. I decided to wait and search online tomorrow for other recipes and hopefully discover the missing ingredients that can save this poor sad soup...if you can even call it soup! Slop may be a better word.

My family loved this soup. It is so cold out today it hit the spot. However, did it a little bit different than the recipe. I boiled the potatoes, and added in green onions and yellow onion. I just barely covered the potatoes with water. I only had 2 cups of milk to add to the flour and butter. But it worked. While the potatoes were boiling and almost done I mashed them a little bit. I drained just a little bit of the water then added them to the rue. Instead of using Cheddar cheese I used Velveeta Cheese (1 cup). Then added 3 large spoonfuls of the sour cream . Came out delicious.

This is DELICIOUS! I had baked some extra potatoes a few days ago with the intention of making baked potato soup. I followed this recipe EXCEPT instead of cooking the potatoes in the microwave, I just halved the baked potatoes I already had, scooped out the potato and roughly chopped it up, and tossed it into the soup with the onions. Superb!! One other thing I did was to stir in some crumbled bacon before serving. My boys, ranging in age from 2 to 15, all thought it was great. I highly recommend this recipe!!!

I really enjoyed this soup! I do not feed many people so I halved the recipe. I changed it up a little and added 1/2 cup of cooked broccoli and a bag of cubed ham and some green onions for taste. I added the onions in with the milk so they would cook a little more. I also boiled the potatoes. VERY good!!

This soup is amazing!!!  Hearty and flavorful.  I would recommend adding more time to cook at the later stages of preparation, but overall, this is an easy recipe, and a tasty soup for those cold winter days!

This soup was so quick and easy. It was a hit in my family. Yes, it was a little thick, but overall it was a wonderful recipe. I added some more cheese, green onions, and real bacon bits and it was awesome!

This recipe turned out great! My husband and I loved it. I made a few changes to it though. I used 6 cups milk and 2 cups half and half because I ran out of milk. I also fried up a 1/2 lb of bacon before cooking the rest of the recipe. After mixing the butter, flour, and milk and bringing to a boil, I added the bacon drippings. I also added some garlic salt. Finally, we chopped the cooked bacon and some green onions and used them as toppings for the soup. It turned out fantastic! I'll be making this again with the small changes mentioned.

The base for the soup was good, however, the potatoes were not done enough for me in the microwave, finished them in a pot of boiling water, coarsely mashed them and then added.  Very hearty soup.  Will make again.

This is a really great recipe.  I don't suggested cooking the potatoes in the microwave though.  They don't turn out as soft.  I used powdered milk and it turned out just as good.

I often choose recipes based upon the review,this was one of those recipes and for the first time I was very disappointed!!  The potatos turned a blackish color and even after cooking significantly longer then the recipe stated the potatos were still crunchy and to top the whole thing off the soup is rather bland in the end anyway.  I love soup but will not be making this one again.

This was average.  The potatoes definitely needed more cooking and the flavour was bland.  I probably wouldn't make this again.

I tried this soup and microwaved the potatoes for about 3 extra minutes. The potatoes also got softer after adding to the soup mixture. I added garlic salt for some flavor but didn't realize what a WONDERFUL recipe this would be. It was well worth the time to satnd in front of the stove cooking. Very quick to make as long as everything is chopped and ready before starting withthe boiling Thanks again.. I will be making this time and time again!!!!!!!!!

You have to cook your potatoes longer than said in recipe. We really like the base recipe except for the not done potatoes.

Great soup... i've made it many times and tried it different ways. I use only half the amount of potatoes otherwise I've found there wasn't enough soup! You don't need to use all the sour cream, also it's much tastier if you use half-and-half instead of milk. Yum... my favorite so far.

So good and filling!!  I boiled the potatoes as normal, though, because I found the potatoes to be too tough when cooked in the microwave and it takes the same amount of time on the stove.  I cut the sour cream in half b/c it's not our favorite ingredient, and I added double the cheese it calls for.  With winter coming it's sure to become a staple around our house!!

This was a very good starter recipe!  I added 2 chicken buillon cubes, red pepper and dill to taste, also we like the soup a little creamier(?spelling) so I used a hand mixer and mashed the potatos before adding the sour cream and cheese, we topped with bacon and green onions. I made extra hoping to freeze 1/2 and use later but we ate the whole thing!

This soupe is awesome!  My mom made potato soup with a very thin base of mashed potatoes so I wasn't sure if I would like this made with flour instead.  I have to say that this is even better than moms!  I used 2 large baking potatoes instead of the 12 called for.  It made 10 servings.  Also topped with a little cheese and crumbled bacon.  Loved it!!!  (It did take a little longer to thicken up than the recipe suggested, but oh so good!)

My daughter and I enjoyed this soup (my husband and son won't try it) so we had alot leftover.  The problem was when we tried to reheat it all we had was a big pot of starch. So we had to dump it all.  I will make again but only a very small portion.

Oh WOW! What a great recipe! Having read some of the other posts I got the idea to use half butter and half bacon grease. It was fabulous. I scaled the recipe to four serving and was sorry I did. Now I have to share! One thing I should bring up is this, make sure your potatoes are nice and done before adding them in. I got in too big a hurry and had to wait for them to finish cooking in the pot. Try this recipe.

This recipe made way too much unless, you're preparing it for a number of people. Needed lots of doctoring with added seasoning. Also required more cooking time for good consistency.Removed about 3 cups and put pureed in blender. This gave it a wonderful, thick and creamy texture. All in all the family liked it. Will make again, by cutting recipe in half.- Susan B. Kingwood, TX

Great soup, but since you're microwaving the potatoes you have to be sure they get all the way softened. Stirring them is a good idea. This makes a lot of soup. My husband and I had leftovers for a week.

This recipe is delicious and very easy.  I have made it twice and I will continue to  make it very often.  My husband said it was the best potato soup he ever had.  The only thing I did differently is to mash the potato's with a hand masher, a little, right before I served it.

This soup is good pureed and served with a dolop of sour cream and chedder cheese.  Also while cooking I added a bit of bacon bits and chives to give it more of a loaded baked potatoe taste.  It is wonderful.

Absolutely fantastic and I haven’t even added the bacon yet. And bacon makes everything better! I did not have sour cream so did not use it; though it is quite rich and creamy without it. Very yummy and filling!

best. soup. ever.

i used 7 potatoes, replaced the butter w/margarine, threw in a few slices of american cheese and a half cup of cheddar and asadero, and used 10 oz of sour cream

microwaving the potatoes was pretty difficult and they werent completely done so i ended up throwing them into the pot while the milk/rue mix did its boiling thing and it cooked them to perfection. 

it took a little longer than the recipe stated but thats probs my own fault, it was really good and made so much soup omg.

Wonderful version of potato soup! I boiled the potato and onions and added garlic to my butter and about twice the amount of cheese. I let my soup cool about 5 min before I added the sour cream too.

I made it and it was delicious. I didn’t think cooking the potatoes in the microwave would work but they were perfect. It thickened up nicely...just follow directions. I used crumbled bacon, green onion and cheese for toppings.

I made it gluten free and lower fat by leaving out the butter,  flour and sour cream and substituting two cups of the milk with vegetable bouillon.  Since I wasn't making a roux to thicken it, I withheld one cup of milk (cold) and mixed it with half a cup of cornstarch and added it to the soup once it was very hot.  I also found that it needed much more, maybe twice as much, cheese as the recipe called for.    My kids loved it!

Very good and easy. . .I added diced ham and bacon with finely chopped red and green bell peppers, onion, garlic, parsley and italian seasoning! One of those soups you can make you own with the base of milk. flour and chicken or vegetable broth.

Great recipe! It was a hit with the family! The only thing I did different was substitute one cup of milk with heavy whipping cream. Also I cooked it in my Faberware 6 qt electric pressure cooker. I will definitely make this soup for years to come! Thanks!

Disappointment and inaccurate.
The potatoes required an additional 10 minutes in the microwave and  15 in the soup.
The sour cream took over the flavor and texture.
It took another half cup of butter and more salt than anyone should be comfortable with to salvage the taste.
Definitely using a different recipe next time.

It came out really tasty. We ended up using 4 cups of milk and 4 cups of chicken broth instead of 8 cups of milk and mixed in bacon and green onions, added A LOT more cheese (everything's better with cheese) and added corn starch to make it thicker.

My kids love this soup. We like a little texture in our soup, so I fry some of the skin-on potatoes(diced) in some of the bacon grease. I also add a little bit of chicken broth and both onion and garlic powder for extra flavor. This soup turns out so creamy and rich!

This soup was delicious! It's thick, creamy and hearty. I pretty much followed the recipe to a tee. I microwaved the potatoes for 12 min, they weren't totally soft so I let them cook about 15 minutes more in the thickened milk mixture-I feel like this helped the soup thicken even more, which I prefer. I whipped the sour cream and left the grated cheese at room temp to avoid the separation I read in some of the other reviews. I also increased the cheddar cheese to 1 cup.

Great! Even my son who doesn't like potatoes enjoyed it! I did tweak it a little to adjust it to my personal tastes, which is why I only gave 4 stars, but it is still good if you make it exactly as the instructions suggest.

I really Liked this soup! Although, I am one for veggies. I made a Marque, of 1 whole onion, 3 celery stalks, 2 garlic cloves and 1&1/2 cut up carrots. I then let them simmer in some veggie broth to soften and I boiled my potatoes as I made the rest. I also added salt, pepper, garlic powder, and dried parsley to my roux and let it cook for awhile to get a pretty gold like color, that way I knew it thickened and didnt taste so flour like. WHen I strained my potatoes, I also strained the veggies that I added. I cooked with a handful extra cheese and I added some onion powder and more salt and pepper to the sauce. Also, I did not use bacon bits, but cooked cut up ham steak. It  was really good. Everyone at my home loved it!! Amazing!!! I will make this again for sure! I may even add some broccoli to it. Lol

Definitely make sure potatoes are cooked enough...trying to soften them once all is together is impossible without adding extra of everything else to compensate for the longer cooking time. I also added already cooked bacon while simmering and some garlic salt for extra flavor. All in all, GREAT soup!

Love this as a base recipe. When in a pinch I will use a bag of frozen diced hash browns and just simmer a few extra minutes.  I also add the onions to the butter first to make sure they are nice & soft.  Not enough cheese for me either so I add more & I've substituted Colby & it's relish. Last I add bacon bits in instead of just as a garnish.

My family loved this! So creamy and cheesy. To make the soup a little richer, i used 4 cups of heavy cream and 4 cups of milk. Also instead of cheddar, i used Melt and Dip (generic Velveeta). The bacon is awesome on top of this. Kinda like the icing on the cake. Def a go to recipe for those cold winter days.

Ok this soup is off the hook!!!!!! I've made it twice, the first time I boiled my potatoes, this time I tried microwaving them. I recommend boiling, because the microwave didn't cook them evenly. I threw them in to boil for a few minutes and they were fine after that. We add bacon and more cheese, and you must always have cornbread with your soup:)

This recipe was perfect, I added tri-color peppers to it and after cubing the potatoes baked them for 20 minutes with butter before adding to the milk and onion mixture I also added bacon, family loved over crusty bread

I did not like the taste of this soup as made per the recipe, so I had to fix it. Lots of salt, some onion powder, some bacon bits, more cheese, lots of black pepper. Then, it was good.

Great basic recipe that I added to since I am lactose and gluten intolerant. I used a 13.5 oz can of lite coconut milk with a cup of water. I also browned up some mild Italian sausage and cooked it with the onion, I used more onion and more cheese, with a little garlic. Corn starch as a thickener instead of flour. Very good! This recipe is wonderful in that yams/sweet potatoes/ squash could be added along with  spices to make it a curry type soup. Mmmm.

This soup turned out perfectly.  I also boiled my diced potatoes.  It needed a little more "zip" so I added a little tabasco sauce.

My whole family really liked this soup.  I thought it was great but needed something extra maybe some broccoli but that would of been a whole different soup.  It was easy to make though and filling with just one bowl for a family of 5 we will have some leftovers for tomorrow. :)

I have made loaded baked potato soup before. I read the reviews and decided to give this recipe a try. It was so bland and was runny.  There wasnt enough pepper that I could have added.  I don't know how others manged to get this recipe to work.

Now I have eaten my moms potato soup for many years. But sadly I never learned how to make it before she passed. Yesterday was my dads bday and that's what he wanted. I found this recipe and it seemed easy. I boiled my potatoes instead and not so much milk. I also didn't put the cheese in it because my dad want it in his. I thought this was a big batch..only have a small bowl left. I am very impressed and will make it more! Might make it again today because I was sick and didn't get to enjoy it like I should of.

We liked the soup very well as a cream of potato soup before adding the sour cream and cheese. Once the sour cream was added, it overpowered the whole thing and it just tasted like warm sour cream. In the future, we will be omitting the sour cream and doubling the cheese or using a sharper cheddar for a more pronounced flavor.

This soup was DELICIOUS! It was definitely the closest thing to oCharleys potato soup! I did change a few things. I made the roux with chicken stock instead of milk, and I probably added twice as much shredded cheese than the recipe calls for. My family loves it! Lol. Garlic salt adds a wonderful flavor to it too!  I served it with hawaiian dinner rolls. Mm mm my belly is happy! You've got to try this!

This soup was very good!  We doubled the cheese just because you can not have too much cheese!  I also used regular baking potatoes instead of red potatoes.  Enjoy!

Anybody having a problem with this recipe needs to review how to make a rue.  This is absolutely spot on and I wouldn't change a thing, oh so tasty.  Only addition I made was three cloves of garlic but I put garlic on ice cream so thats a give in.

It had really good flavor (I added onion powder instead of the actual onions but kept everything else the same) BUT it was very gritty. Any suggestions for that??? I want to keep making it but I would prefer to have a smooth soup and not a gritty one.

Comfort food at its best.  I halved the recipe but used twice as many spuds as called for (only because they were about to go bad on me), added some chopped broccoli and used granulated onion in place of the real deal.  Thought this was so much better than it would be - thick and delicious.  The sour cream really adds something to this....and as unbelievable as it is, salt and pepper are the only necessary spices.  Topped with shredded cheddar and real bits of bacon and let me say that I can't wait to make this one again.  Also, I used all fat free or low fat products and it did not compromise the flavor at all. Thanks!

I tried many recipes at this website. This recipe is the not the best. It almost tasted good when I added cooked sausage to the Loaded Potato Soup I. If you don`t want to waste your time, don`t cook this recipe.

We had leftover baked potatoes, so I was looking for something that I could do with them that was easy and inexpensive and this was perfect.  I left out the onion, but we ate it for days!  I totally recommend it.

What a yummyyy soup this is. I was not able to add the onions due to an allergy in the family. I did add 1 1/2 cups of frozen chopped brocoli and about a 1/4 cup more cheese. I also used turkey bacon instead and did need to add more salt. Very yummy...Thanks for a great recipe.

Yum- What a hearty bowl of soup!  My hungry brother came over and was stuffed after one helping. I added celery and some extra onion, and it turned out fab.  I think parsley would be a great garnish.

EVERYONE LOVED THIS!!!  The potatoes didnt get quite done in the microwave so it took a little longer that I had anticipated but It was well worth it.  I also added Bacos.  It gave it a wonderful taste.

My husband and I really disliked this potato soup.  First, it was too thick.  But the biggest dislike was it was way too bland.  We added bacon bits, and more salt and pepper, and it didn't help a bit.  This recipe needs major doctoring with seasonings.  I will not be fixing this recipe again.

Very easy flavorful recipe.  I've shared this with my sister and she thinks it's a great recipe too.  I've seen more complicated recipes for this type of soup with many more ingredients but this tasted great.  Thank you, Claire.

This is a great comfort soup for winter!  You can use green onions instead of regular onions.  Make sure to use a wisk for the best results when blending.  A very comforting meal!!

I browned the onions first and this gave it a great taste.
