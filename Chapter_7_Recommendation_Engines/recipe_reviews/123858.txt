I had such high hopes for this recipe. I love the way sweet and salty and savory mix all together, but this recipe just didn't work for me. The texture of the "sauce" was off. The tastes didn't blend, it just tasted like corn chips in extra sweet peanut butter. Sorry...

This is AWESOME!! I don't understand, if done correctly, why anyone wouldn't love this. My family would have me making this easy and delicious recipe at least once a week. The peanut butter mixture would be wonderful to dress up a caramel apple.

I LOVE this. Don't really have a sweet tooth, so the combination of flavors is great. I always crunch up the chips a bit before blending with the sauce, then drop onto a baking sheet, rather than pouring sauce over entire chips. I find this gives more even coverage; there aren't lots of big chips without the sauce. Yum!

I recently had these at a party.  Loved them!  The combo of sweet and salty was delicious.  I wouldn't change the recipe a bit!

Since I love sweet and salty mixed, I had to try it (even though I almost didn't because of the other review).  The recipe states to let it cool and then "break" apart so I thought it would be a more crispy texture but the peanut butter mixture stays soft but not sticky.  It is still good tasting but not the texture I prefer.  I thought it would be more like a rice krispie cookie when it set up.  Good but not great!

I love Kookie cookies! They are the perfect salty-sweet snack. The only problem I've found with them is that you may single-handedly eat an entire bag of corn chips in an afternoon.

We love these!  Love the sweet/salty/crunch/chewy.  I took them to a Halloween party just after moving into our neighborhood, and was risking my reputation.  They were the hit of the party.  When planning our party this year, these were first on the list of "must haves".

We make these a lot but we call them Fritos dessert. Never use reduced fat peanut butter - the sauce gets too hard. Add a little extra peanut butter to get more flavor. For a little extra treat, sprinkle milk chocolate chips over the warm topping. Best eaten when still warm.

Fast and easy dessert.  Kids loved it too!  We threw some m&m's on it too.
