Great, bold flavor! I omitted the jalapeno (I'm pregnant and can't tolerate super spicy right now) and subbed a few shakes of red pepper flakes, and I used fresh ginger because I don't have ground, and baby bok choy because it's what I had from the CSA. I used half the dressing, and that was plenty. I think the dressing really makes this salad--it's tangy and mustardy, but not overpowering. This would also be great with cabbage instead of bok choy. A definite keeper!

Sensational dressing!  I adore spicy food and this hit the spot.  Spicy-hot, tangy and slightly sweet;  perfect side dish, but it would be fantastic on a hamburger, burrito, soft tacos, wraps, noodle soup and more.  I used cabbage and serrano peppers.  Will definitely make again to share!  Thanks JWM!

I have a ton of bok choy from the local farm, we can't eat mayo so we were missing out on Cole slaw... this is good. Only used four jalapenos tho. There is way too much dressing so I strained it after I realized it.

Sorry, I didn't much care for this recipe, but I must admit that I didn't add as many peppers as stated (I admit it - I didn't add any cherry peppers, and only 1 jalapeno).  As written, it was just way too spicy for me, but I love bok choy, so I decided to try the recipe anyway, thinking it would still be good.  It turned out extremely vinegary and bitter.  I'm sure it is great as written though.

This is really good! I used four jalapenos and that was too much heat for me, so will use three next time. I am also going to marinate some steak in the dressing and then stir fry it. I think this recipe will make a great marinade!

I really liked this recipe.  However, I used twice as much bok choy and none of the cherry peppers or cucumbers.  It may be a little too tangy for my taste, but a great dressing, none-the-less.

The recipe is fine - just not my cup of tea. Or saucer of salad, I guess. I thought the mustard taste was overwhelming in the dressing. Maybe I'm just sensitive to mustard, but I was noticing a few comments said slightly sweet and I didn't get that. Just mustardy. I liked the veggie combo. I gave this three stars instead of two because I think it has great potential - I just need to tweak the dressing a little to suit my tastes. Husband loved it, teen son thought it was okay. I hope to try it again and alter the dressing. Thanks!

This is a fantastic tasting, zingy salad! 
I cut 1 star for it being too hot for the average person and for the "shredding of cucumbers". P.I.T.A.!
First time I made this, I followed recipe exactly, but with just two minor adjustments based on previous reviews: 
1)I only had 20 minutes for it to sit/marinade before serving time.
2)I poured out about a third of the "vinaigrette" before serving-other reviews said it was too soggy (and made better for leftovers, too!).
Five Jalapeno's is very tasty-hot, and we loved it, but is not for anyone that can't tolerate hot/spicy. I suggest reduce the Jalapeno's to 2 or 4, depending on the company you're serving.
The ginger at the end is a nice unique flavor with this salad. Don't forget it.

Best easy recipe for Bok Choy yet!

Very nice heat, sweet and sour balance. Added just a touch more of the agave. Will be perfect as a side to grilled fish or on a shredded pork sandwich. Yum!!!!!!!!

I only needed 4 servings so I used less than suggested in the recipe (1 carrot, 1/4 cup acv). I substituted brown sugar for the agave syrup and a regular tomato, omitted the soy sauce and whisked in a little Miracle Whip. I didnÂ´t have the brown grain mustard, so I used store bought yellow mustard and added a little lime juice and a dash of hot pepper sauce to amp up the spicy flavor.
