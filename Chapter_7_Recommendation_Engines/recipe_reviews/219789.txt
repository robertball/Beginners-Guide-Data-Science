This was quite easy to make and turned out pretty good.  I almost went 4 stars since I will not say this is something to rave about but, then again, it is not a main-course type soup.  Compared to my expectation  it was quite good.  Salt & pepper to taste when eating was needed but otherwise I followed the recipe almost to the word.  I used some green onions instead of regular and replaced the pumpkin pie spice with cinnamon, nutmeg, clover and ginger (which is just a recipe for pumpkin pie spice).  My 5 star rating is also because I wanted a way to work some other vegetables into my diet and this soup allows me to add pumpkin without making a desert dish.   Regarding step 2:  My soup seemed to be fully pureed without this step.  I did, however, have a stick blender so used it quickly right in the pot to further refine the consistency.  It seems like you could skip this step if you finely dice the onions and the pumpkin is already well pureed.

Smooth and creamy!  I left out the butter(used vegetable spray) and the bouillon cubes.  The flavor is carried by the hot spices!

This recipe took me to a warm, yummy, happy place, and I really enjoyed it. It was slightly missing a depth of flavor that I've found in other pumpkin soups, which is why I took off a star. Still, it was creamy, satisfying, and incredibly simple. I may tinker with the favors in the future, but this will probably hold its place as my go-to pumpkin soup recipe for a long time.

I modified the recipe by using College Inn Thai Coconut Curry Stock.  I used 3 cups because I thought 2 was too thick.  I used lemon juice and lemon zest.  I used less onion and garlic (1 small onion and 1 clove garlic) and minced them very fine, didn't puree, and added a little salt & pepper and a pat of butter to add to the creaminess.  It was fast, easy, and excellent!  I'll definitely make it again!

I didn't have any boullion so I added more cinnamon, clove and nutmeg (in lieu of pumpkin spice) to add depth.  For a side soup it's good.  I used a large onion, finely chopped and pureed it with an emmersion blender when I added the water for a creamier texture.  I used more water than called for to thin the soup out.  As suggested, once I added salt and pepper I like it!  Made about 3/4ths of a gallon.  I'll be taking it with my lunch to work.  I think the addition of a chicken or vegetable broth would have added lots of depth however I do like it.  The spicy kick works for me!  Oh I added a bit less of the chili powder for my taste.  

Thanks for sharing.  I had some coconut milk and needed to do something with the frozen pureed pumpkin I'd made from my Halloween pumpkins.  Utilized both at the same time!

Great Soup! Subs I made were earth balance butter (instead of regular), only one bouillon cube (cut back on salt) and juice of whole lemon instead of orange juice.  Came out pretty good!

I really enjoyed this! I did not puree it since I'm lazy and didn't want to wash additional dishes (haha). I followed the recipe almost exactly except I added salt and red pepper flakes for extra spice. Otherwise this was fabulous!

My husband and I liked it overall. Although, I did make it with some changes.  I used lite coconut milk, because that was what I had on hand, 2 generous tsps of red curry powder instead of chili powder, cinnamon/nutmeg/cloves added to taste, lime juice instead of orange juice.  It was lacking somewhat, so I added some brown sugar to taste (maybe 1/4 cup or so) and that made it taste a lot better.  Not as healthy, but that slightly sweet and spicy really made it come together.

Very easy to pull together. I had fresh pumpkin to use up donâ€™t know if that made any difference in the final product but seems missing a flavor. All in all good soup.

I really liked this soup, it had nice flavors, I think I will add even more ginger next time because I love ginger. I did change one thing however , instead of chili powder I used 1/2t curry powder, and it was lovely. I have children so not to make it too spicy.  I would make this again as I am always baking with pumpkin and have leftovers from those big cans that needs to be used. Oh ya I was short about 1c. of pumpkin puree and it was still delish! Thanks!

I used the old jack o lantern rather than canned pumpkin. Spices were great. Just the right amount of heat.

Found it interesting, but not great. Much better with a little brown sugar added. I might try curry instead of chili powder.  Husband didn't care for it but he's accustomed to squash soup which is a little sweeter  and has fresh ginger, nutmeg, and cinnamon.

I made this recipe with butternut squash I cooked in the oven instead of pumpkin purÃ©e.I also made it with vegetable stock.I didn't have orange juice so I didn't add it and it was still delicious!The blend of spices was a great mix for the squash.I definitely am going to make this again.

I was disappointed in this bland soup, but after doubling spices & coconut milk, it was quite good.  Use non fat coconut milk to prevent small curds

A lovely soup for fall, so simple and comforting. I recommend adding the coconut a little at a time and taste as you go, you may find that a full can of the stuff is just too much. If you don't have pumpkin pie spice use a mix of cinnamon, nutmeg, ground ginger, and ground cloves. This is a great option for when you want pumpkin but you don't want it for dessert.

I just made this and it is easy and delish.  I did not have orange juice but did have some true orange so used the equivalent and I thought it was a little bitter so at the end I added 2 TBS of brownulated sugar.  Will make this again!

I really wanted to like this recipe. It was easy enough, but the end product was vary, very bland. Since I hated to waste what was really a beautiful and well-textured soup, I started throwing the spice cabinet at it. It finally took curry powder to really make this soup sing. If you're going for looks, this recipe is hard to beat, but if you want flavor, try something else.

A bit of an acquired taste maybe.  I found the ginger and pumpkin pie spice overpowered the pumpkin.  My husband also tried it and didn't care for it.  Maybe more suited as a small bowl if accompanying a thai meal, but certainly not as a meal itself.
