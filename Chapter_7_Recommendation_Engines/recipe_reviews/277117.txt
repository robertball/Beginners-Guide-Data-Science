This was great.  I doubled the recipe. I riced a fresh head of broccoli by putting it through the cheese grater blade of my cuisinart.  I added a boullion cube for a bit more flavor other than that it was made as written.  I did simmer the soup for about 10 minutes as I needed the fresh broccoli to soften. And I didn’t have xantham gum so I served it as is which made it a thin soup but the cream and butter and cheese make it VERY satisfying.
