They look like a gooey mess, but they are so delicious that people asked me for the recipe. This is easily doubled and baked in a 9x13 pan.

I have made this twice. Because it was so mediocre the first time, I thought I had made a mistake.  To me it was nothing like a candy bar.  It was kind of dry and not gooey.  Great idea as far as ingredients, but I don't think it is a winner!

If this turned out dry, it was over-baked.  It is good, several compliments.  Watch the broiler!!! One minute goes fast!

These taste okay, but not very caramelly. The dough for the crust was very wet; could not be "pressed" into the pan. I felt they needed something, so I sprinkled chocolate chips on top and returned it to the warm oven to melt. Once melted, spread the chocolate around with the back of a spoon. As a whole these turned out more like a cookie bar than a candy bar.

These were so good plus pecans can be subbed for cashews.  They keep in fridge for a couple weeks if wrapped.

Recipe was vague. Didn't talk about the melting the butter in the ingredients. 
Said spread the butter mixture over the base but didn't say whether to cool it first. 

Then it said to cut the squares while warm...not a good idea.

Oh my goodness! This is so perfect! Of all that I baked this one is the best and easy to make. I did some changes though, I used caramel candies instead of brown sugar for the toppings, I used walnut instead of cashew and add some vanill. Oh so yummy! Try it

I think it needs another liquid like vanilla extract. I can smell and taste the egg too much, and i don't think that's right. It tastes good though. But could be better.
