We almost always make this pizza when we go camping and we do it in our outside kitchen at home over the fire as well.  Everyone should try it as the flavor is wonderful and authentic to some popular pizza pubs that actually fire their pizzas rather than bake them conventionally.

I make pizza on our charcoal grill at home, but I never thought to try it over the fire! What a nice change from all our usual camping meals!!! I made bar-b-que chicken the night before and used the leftovers to make bar-b-que chicken pizza with bbq sauce, pinneapple chicken and mozzarella. Simple and delicious! Thank you for sharing!

Went over to the kids house where they have an open fire pit and gave this a try. I didn't have a pizza stone so I used a comal (cast iron flat griddle) and the smoky goodness turned out perfect. The grand kids had fun with these.

I don't have a pizza stone... so used a comal (cast iron flat griddle).  Added chopped onions, diced green bell peppers, one large garlic clove, minced.  Sprinkled Italian seasoning over the top before cooking & crushed red pepper to taste.
