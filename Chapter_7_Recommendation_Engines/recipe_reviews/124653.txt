Excellent soup.  Rather disconcertingly, the color changed to a light tan, instead of staying green.  I used skim milk powder, reconstituted (to re make it lower calorie), and omitted the bacon.

I made this recipe as written trying to use up a box of barley and some broccoli.  It was good, but was missing flavor.  I read another recipe and decided to saute a large onion and garlic.  I then added this to the soup - it made a HUGE difference in the taste.  The texture of this soup is very nice, mine was thick like a chowder.  I added fresh grated American cheese rather than American slices as the recipe calls for.  I will make this again, adding the garlic and onions in the beginning.  I added the bacon right before serving so that it wouldn't get soft.  My star rating was based on the recipe before adding the garlic and onions.
