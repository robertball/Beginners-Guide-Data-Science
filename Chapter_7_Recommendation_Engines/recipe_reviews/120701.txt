These were made as written with the exception of using 50/50 whole wheat and all purpose flours and canola oil for the butter. I used a different streusel topping as well. The first step is contradictory. If you combine the first 7 ingredients as instructed and then beat, you will not obtain a smooth result. The cream cheese and sugar need to be creamed together first, then the eggs added and so on. Having said that, though the mixture was lumpy, it did not seem to negatively affect the finished product, it just made for small lumps of cream cheese throughout the muffin which were not neccessarily unpleasant. Do add a teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter as it would geatly improve the overall flavor. The muffins were tender and flavorful though as I say, cinnamon would be an improvement. This recipe becomes a 5 star with my adjustments and is one I will likely make often.

I agree with the other reviewers who thought the muffins needed some spice.  We added lots of cinnamon, some ginger and fresh nutmeg.  We also added raisins and the muffins were quite tasty when warm from the oven.  I also took the earlier advice and cut back the baking powder to 1 tsp.  The yield was about 18 muffins from one batch.

This is a decent basic recipe.  It leaves much to be desired though in flavor.  I made the recipe to a tee, actually it makes more then 12, more like 16 large muffins.  I suggest using self rising omitting the baking powder which is overwhelming in the taste, not a good thing.  Also I believe it needs more sugar, and maybe a little cinnamon, or something else.  It's just to blah, not terrible, which is why I gave it a 3, but definatly not great.  Pouch BC muffin mixes are a 5 in flavor comparison.

These were delicious! We used whole wheat flour and raisin bran instead of the bran flakes. Turned out great!

These are amazing muffins!  It has been three days since I made them, and they are still chewy and soo tasky!  For cinnamon lovers: try putting a teaspoon of cinnamon in the dry ingredients.  Mmm!!

These turned out really well. I ended up using oatmeal instead of corn flakes and followed suggestions of using extra cinnamon in the batter as well.

It was seeing CC's photo of these, that made me just have to try them!  The muffins are delicious, so light and moist and a gorgeous flavor.  BUT I did make a few changes.    Firstly I creamed together the butter, sugar and cream cheese before adding the eggs then the rest of the wet ingredients followed by the dry ingredients (ALSO ADDED 1 TEASPOON OF CINNAMON TO THE BATTER).  I did make my own topping using 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 tablespoon butter, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, 2 tablespoons AP Flour.  Totally gorgeous, with the changes. I know I will be using this recipe often.

Loved these muffins.  After reading some of the reviews, I opted to put the ingredients together differently than the recipe directed.  I creamed the butter and cream cheese together with the sugar and then added the rest of the ingredients.  The result was a smooth batter studded with apples.  They turned out very moist and were a huge hit with the parents at the swim meet over the weekend.

These muffins were SO moist and delicious! However, like most of the other reviewers, I cut the baking powder back to 1 tsp. and added a pinch of ginger, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg. They were absolutely MARVELOUS! Even my cranky non-morning person fiance commented on how yummy they were when I made them for breakfast.

I modified quite a bit based on what I had in the kitchen, but it turned out very good.  I used sweet apples, not tart.  After peeling the apples, I put the peels and the milk together in a mini food processor and gave it a whirl.  I used half white and half whole wheat flour, and I threw in a teaspoon of mixed sweet spice.  I topped with a mixture of sugar and the same sweet spice.  My teenagers loved them!

Was short on vanilla but next time would add the cinnamon/sugar mixture directly to the batter.

SO GOOD!  I did take the advice of other reviews and add spice.  I added 1tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg.  Could probably even do with a little more.  Maybe pumpkin pie spice?  They are light and fluffy and still moist the next day.  They're a hit!  Will definitely make these again ... maybe tomorrow :)
