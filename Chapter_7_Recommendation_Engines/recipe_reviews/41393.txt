This makes the yummiest, really moist and tender (as in falling off the bone, literally; if you need your turkey to be pretty, keep a sharp eye out) Thanksgiving bird.  Definitely make gravy from the herb-y, flavorful drippings - it completely kicks you-know-what, too.  Can't say enough good things about this one.  I used softened butter, which is tasty and easier to handle, and put most of the mixture under the skin.  My roaster doesn't have a lid, so I tightly covered with foil; it worked just fine.  In other words, you can't go wrong! **Added later: well, I've made this several more times in different ways - In the oven with a turkey bag, in a countertop roaster, all olive oil instead of butter, sprinkling generously with paprika after pouring on the herbs (to enhance browning - but don't baste or the "fake tan" will wash off!)... turns out great every time. Made Thanksgiving lunch this year ('07) for 50+ people at work, including this turkey, and it was rave reviews all around! ** Added '08: I've made this about six times now, so I've decided that this is the magic combo: use olive oil as written; use most of the mixture under the skin with just enough outside for pretty; don't use an oven bag; after the herbs are poured on, add a generous coating of Paprika and skip the basting (don't need it anyway!). Cooked again for work - well before noon at least 10 people had walked up to me with shiny fingers and half-full mouths, saying "that turkey is so GOOOD!". 'Nuf said.

I've used this recipe for two years now - it is fabulous!  The only things I changed were cooking it in a turkey bag and preparing the spices a little differently.  I mix them in a softened whole stick of butter, smear it all in a small plastic bag, roll it up, then refrigerate (a la Sandra Lee).  Once firm, I slice it and put the pats under the skin and in the cavity of the bird.  My turkeys were always, always dry before I found this recipe; now they get rave reviews.  It's a keeper!

Okay, listen good and hard. This turkey recipe is the *BEST* turkey recipe on the planet. EVERYONE loved it including the kids! Just as others mentioned, you do need to take the solution and put under the skin of the turkey between the skin and the meat - right on top of the meat and the outside of the skin as well. I also doubled the solution as to have more rub for my large turkey. P.S. I added about 3 tbs of butter and mixed into the mixture to give an additional buttery flavor. If you think I'm wrong about this -- let me tell you what a 10 year old told me after eating my turkey *LEFTOVERS* -- "This turkey is better than my momma's... her's is dry."  Isn't that sweet?

This is the juciest turkey recipe you will ever try, I promise.  And the flavor is out of this world. 

Thank you whoever invented it! It will be my turkey recipe for every Thanksgiving and Christmas from now until eternity!

This was so easy, no basting!  And it was very moist.  However, the skin did not brown under the tin foil, so next time, I wil take the tin foil off about an hour before it is done.

Loved this!  Silly me, I thought I needed to double the recipe because I was using a bigger turkey big mistake!  In the end I wasted a lot of olive oil and spices.  My advice is to use the measurements as directed no matter what the size of your turkey is.

My first time making turkey and everyone at the dinner party was amazed.  Things like "the moistest turkey ever" "delicious" "oh my god, are you sure you made this yourself?"...  I had a 12lb turkey, lightly stuffed w/ italian sausage stuffing, coated in the herb ingredients.. cooked breast side up for 2 hours (covered), then breast down (uncovered) for another 2 hours.  Oh - I used 1/2c olive oil, 1/4c melted butter.  I didn't even baste it once!  Crispy, browned, juicy.  I can't say enough good things!!!  Update:  cooked it again for a "Trial Run" dinner.. fantastic.  Followed exactly as I did it last time - just be careful flipping the bird, its hot and if your hands slip, you lose some of the golden skin.  Happy Thanksgiving!

My first turkey and it came out wonderfully.  Used 1/2 oil and butter, and used a can of chicken stock with garlic (14 oz) instead of the water.  Injected the turkey with the garlic chicken stock as well, and added a whole onion and a whole garlic bulb to the cavity.  For my 13 lb turkey, cooked at 325 with a foil tent for 2.5 hours, then removed the foil and upped to 350 for 1.25 hours.  PERFECTION!  My family raved.

This was my first turkey and it was so easy.  The meat was moist and tender.  The meat was falling off the bone. I have never had moist white meat at anyone else's house, so this recipe must be good.  I did a 14 pound turkey stuffed with cranberry, sausage, and apple stuffing from this site.  It took only 3 1/2 hours to cook.  The only thing I changed was instead of olive oil, I melted 1/2 cup of unsalted butter and added all the spices.  I used a brush to apply everything as stated.  I poured 2 cups of chicken stock into the bottom of the roasting pan.  I left the turkey UNCOVERED and basted it every 1/2 hour which gave it a rich brown color. This recipe is a definite keeper.  No more dry meat!

Wow! What a great turkey we had at my house today for Thanksgiving. This turkey (10lbs) was just perfect!! Nice and moist and flavorful. I cooked it for 21/2 hours. I covered it during cooking with foil,then removed it for the last 45 minutes for browning. I also put two bay leaves under the skin. This is a keeper for sure.

Made this for our own Thanksgiving dinner...and it was amazing.  I did have to roast it a little bit longer than the recipe called for (but I think that it was because of my oven, not the recipe).  It was so moist and the seasonings were just perfect.  I will definately be making this one again.  Thanks for the post.

Never have I made such an easy, mouthwatering turkey!  Smelled awesome while it was baking.  I followed other reviewer's suggestions, and used canned chicken broth in the bottom of the roaster.  Stuffed cavity with onions quartered, garlic cloves, and 2 fresh limes I had to use up.  Made the best gravy, as well as browned but not dried out skin!  A definite keeper!

Having never made a turkey before this past thanksgiving, I took it upon myself to find the best recipe and seasonings I could find. Everyone was SO impressed with my turkey! I cooked mine upside down (to keep the breast from drying out) and it was amazing. Thanks to you, my family thinks I'm a pro! :)

This turkey came out moist, savory, juicy and tender. The meat was falling off the bone! I added lots of minced garlic, fresh sliced lemons, Hawaiian sea salt, fresh ground black pepper and fresh herbs (sage, rosemary, marjarom, basil, etc.) to real butter and olive oil and rubbed it all over the turkey and under the skin, cavity, etc. I also cut one lemon in half and squeezed it all over the turkey and placed the lemons inside the cavity along with half onions, more garlic and basil. I basted it every 30 minutes for 4 1/2 hours and took off the foil the last 30 minutes of the cooking process to make a nice brown color. I used a gravy/fat separator for the juice in the pan and added one package of turkey gravy mixture. I would definitely used this recipe again. It was easy, delicious and so satisfying! I served this with," Bread and Celery Stuffing," also from this website.

This was my first turkey ever and it turned out great. (I will say as a vegetarian, it tested my stomach when I was cleaning it!) As suggested by many, I made a few changes. I used two cups of chicken broth and one cup of water instead of just water. I cut back on the garlic powder by about half a tablespoon and added a tablespoon of fresh garlic. I did not have sage, so I omitted the salt and added poultry seasoning. I pulled up the skin on the breasts and placed about half of the seasoning/oil mix under there. I put the rest of the mix on the outside of the turkey. I cut up an apple and a small onion, rubbed them on the bowl that had the seasoning mix in it to scrap up the last of the spices and placed them in the cavity of the bird. They add flavor and moisture while cooking. I cooked it breast down covered for most of the time (so the juices from the dark meat ran into the breast) then uncovered it and flipped it over for the last 45mins-hour of cooking (basting every 10 mins) to let it brown nicely. I made a 20lb turkey, so I multipled the recipe by 1.5. It took about 5 and half hours for it to cook to 175 (I then took it out and covered it till it reached 180). It was litterally falling off the bones when we cut it up the next day. My husband, who is not a huge turkey fan loved it. He also thought the "easy turkey gravy" from this site was my best gravy ever!! Thanks for the amazing recipe!!!!

We love roasted turkey in this family.  I have been using the same method for all my turkeys for years, however, and we decided to try something new this past Thanksgiving.  I found this recipe and decided to give it a try.  I followed the directions to the letter...no deviation whatsoever (except that I did like most others recommended and put the herb mix under the skin as well as over it).  Having always been a cheesecloth over the breast and baste religiously gal, I was skeptical.  It had so many lovely reviews, though, I took the risk.

I cannot even begin to tell you how ridiculously awesome this turkey was.  I have never in my life had a turkey with so much flavor and this much moisture...and that's really saying something.  We eat a lot of turkey in this family.

I will never go back to my old recipe.  This method is less work, less mess, and a superior turkey in both flavor and texture.  You simply MUST give this a try.

This was such a huge hit! The turkey was so moist you could cut it with a plastic for - just be sure to baste it every 30 minutes. And if you uncover it for the last half hour to 45 minutes, it browns beautifully. Also, instead of two cups of water I did 1.5 cups of chicken broth and 1/2 cup of water.

This was soooo delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly except I left out the water since I used an oven bag.  My turkey was 14 lbs. and was done in 3 1/2 hours.  It browned beautifully in the bag so I didn't even need to baste it, and it was so moist.  I boiled the neck and giblets in water with a few carrots on the stove while the turkey was roasting and then used the reduced broth as an addition to the turkey drippings (put thru a gravy separator) to make gravy.  This was the best turkey I have ever made.  Thanks so much, I am stuffed!  :)

This was fantastic!  I had a 21 lb turkey so I doubled the recipe, half butter like some suggested, poultry seasoning instead of sage because I had it, made sure to get it all under the skin, and used chicken stock instead of water in the bottom of my pan.  I used a different baking structions since my bird was quite larger and baked it in the oven at 350 until the skin started to turn a golden brown, covered it with a foil tent, and then took it off the last hour of baking to get the skin nice and crispy, about 5.5 hours total.  It turned out great and the wonderful gravy from the drippings was a bonus!  My guest said it tasted like rotisserie style and loved it!  They even asked to take some left overs with them!

Very flavorful! I combined the oil and herbs the night before. Also I used my hands to rub the herb mix under the skin and on top of the skin. I also used some bay leaves and garlic. I filled the cavity with lemons, whole garlic cloves, celery, onion and carrots. Instead of water, I used white wine in a roasting bag w/ a little bit of flour. The flavor and color was AMAZING! I've been using the leftovers in casseroles and it is quite tasty. Very easy for my 1st turkey! I got RAVE reviews! I'll make every turkey like this one!

I made this turkey recipe for my first Thanksgiving dinner...it turned out fabulous!  Everyone including 3 really finickey kids loved it.  I did make some changes.  I halved the oil and added the rest as butter. I put a pack of fresh carrots and celery on the bottom of the pan with about a quater inch of water to keep the turkey moist.  Also, I put two apples cut in half and one spanish onion halved in the cavity for moistness.  Roast uncovered at 500 degrees for 20 minutes for color; cover and reduce heat to 325 to roast till the end.  The juices were marvelous.  I purchased gravy which was used only on the mashed potatoes.  Everyone loved the carrots and celery from the bottom of the pan which I included as a side dish and they prefered the pan juices on the turkey.  I fear Thanksgiving dinner at my house no more!!!

Very, VERY moist turkey!!!!  It was my first turkey attempt and my husband could not believe how moist it was!  And the flavor was amazing!  I used chicken broth instead of water in the roasting pan, added garlic cloves in the cavity, added 3 tbls of butter into the oil mixture and kept out the sage (because I didn't have any on hand).  I rubbed the mixture on the skin.  Next time I will try under the skin to see the difference.  10 lb turkey cooked in 3 hrs.  I started it off covered with foil then uncovered for the last hour.  I didn't bast the turkey once and it was great.  It's a keeper!

I couldn't believe how good this was!  Used an oven bag, mixed half butter and half olive oil with spices and spread under the skin and over the outside, and poured chicken broth into the bag instead of water.  I had to cook it early so when it was done, we sliced it and put it in an electric skillet on low with the juices.  I've never been a turkey fan, but I'll definitely make this again!!!

This was the best turkey I've ever served, and I've served many.  Believe me, getting under the skin of a turkey at 8:00 a.m. on a holiday morning after his bath was not my idea of fun, but I did it - for the first time.  I couldn't believe how tough the skin is as I stretched it "out of my way" with a handful of herbs, spices and butter, but it never tore. I always thought the sides were this meal's crowning glory and turkey was just, well, turkey, but this turkey turned out way too well to throw into a soup.  It was the most flavorful, juciest Tom I ever served, and I will never do it differently again.  Many thanks.

I used this recipe to cook my first Thanksgiving turkey ever.  It was easy and my boyfriend loved it!  Helpful hint: When using the juices to make gravy, add salt and gravy master, since there isn't much salt in the recipe.

Take out at 165-170 degrees and let stand.  It will continue to cook and not be dry - especially the breast meat.  Check to make sure it is cooked through.

I was told by some very discriminating eaters that this was the best turkey they had ever had - and it was my very first!  I had a 23lb bird and this did the trick. Some ingredients were increased to account for the size of the turkey. Inserting the mixture below the skin was the key!  Thanks Lisa for such a great recipe.

This will be my 3rd Christmas (plus 1 Thanksgiving) that I have used this recipe and gotten rave reviews!  I used others suggestions, adding pats od margarine under the skin and injecting oil mixture under skin and into the breast.  Yummy!!  You do not need to baste this turkey, Just put it in and forget about it until it's done!  I used this on a 20 lb turkey and still not dry!!

Yep, all the reviewers are correct - this is THE BEST turkey recipe ever! So glad I chose this recipe for our thanksgiving this year. Was a bit worried about all the herbs that covered the turkey, but didn't matter in the end! The meat literally fell off the bone before it was done! And the white meat which we don't usually like because it is dry - so moist - just like the dark meat. And the gravy - no seasoning at all required!!! Just add some cornstarch and it was done! I did brine my turkey overnight which may have added to the yumminess (was my first time doing that). I also added a sliced apple to the inside cavity to add more moisture. I injected some of olive oil/herb mixture under the skin. I also used a reynolds turkey bag. This will be our turkey recipe from now on!

WARNING: Do not make this turkey unless you intend to be the "official" turkey maker for all events for the rest of your life.  Once others have eaten this turkey, they will not accept anything else.  A huge success!!

Moist, and tasty!  A Thanksgiving Feast to REMEMBER!! I substituted 1/2 cup melted butter for 1/2 cup of the olive oil.  I put quartered onions in the cavity of the bird.  Because I used a stoneware roaster, I also decreased the amount of water called for.  THIS WAS A HIT.  My mother always did the turkey, and I had never done one before.  She passed away right after Valentine's day this year.  My family tasted the turkey, and told me "You mother would be proud!  THis is great!"  Thanks for such a wonderful recipe!

Great.  So moist but I added a whole quarter of butter slices (from the freezer) under the skin too.  Man, this tastes so good!

I have to say I'm slightly disappointed.  After reading the reviews I was expecting tons of compliments--but no one said anything.  I followed the directions (but used a turkey cooking bag) and it came out dry.  I kept checking the pop-up thermometer in the turkey and thought I took it out shortly after it popped...but still dry.  I used 2 cups chicken broth in the bottom of the pan instead of water and used 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 melted butter instead of all olive oil.  I'm going to keep this recipe though since the reviews were so great.  Next time I'm going to check the turkey with my own thermomter when I think it should be done.  I think it was something I did.  I'll try again.

Perfect!  I had a really small butterball that I wanted to do in my slow cooker.  I don't care about brown skin, as I don't eat it anyway and was only serving for my husband and me.  The only things I did different was first soaking in a brine with a lime and o.j., kosher salt and water for about 2 hours.  I used a smaller portion of EVO and made more of a paste that I tucked under the skin and some into the cavity.  Put it on low and forgot about it.  The aroma is wonderful and the broth is superb!  I've made tons of turkeys but this is the best tasting flavor thus far.  This recipe would be a no-fail for a first time cook.  I bet this would be wonderful done in the oven with a beautiful skin.  This is how I will do mine from now on.

Took this to a buffet tonight and even though it finished roasting an hour after everyone had finished, it vanished!  It's a definite keeper. 

PS  We'd run out of rubbed sage so used poultry seasoning as advised by others, and used a roasting bag, so didn't add extra fluid.  Had I wanted to make gravy, there were plenty of drippings.

Used this recipe for our Thanksgiving turkey this year and it was the best turkey I've made to date.  Absolutely delicious and tender.  I took the advice of others and used half softened butter and olive oil.  Lifted the breast skin and spread some of the mixture underneath as well as over the entire outside of the turkey.  Used chicken broth instead of water in the roasting pan and addded additional broth throughout the cooking time for basting.  I will use this recipe for all my holiday turkeys.  Thanks Lisa!

There are so many recipes that have alot more ratings than this one...But this one is the BEST.  I tried this last year and it was fantastic!  I then tried a different one this year that had 200+ ratings thinking it would be better...it wasn't!  Will continue to make this recipe for years to come.

I forgot to cover the turkey, And it cooked too quickly on the outside. The meat underneath however, was the most flavorful, and moistest that I've ever tasted! I gave it 5 stars because I know if I had followed the instructions it would have turned out perfectly!

Roasted a 9lb turkey for 3 hours at the given temp (325F). Used butter instead of oil and substituted oregano since I had no sage, used seasoning salt instead of salt and pepper. Brushed with butter and uncovered the turkey for the last hour. Golden brown, crispy skin and moist inside!

Made a beautiful turkey!  Put mixture on night before I cooked turkey.  Used an 18 lb turkey, and it was done in 4 hours- covered witih foil for the 3rd hour only (thought it might be browning too quick).  Loved how easy this was- no injecting, basting, stuffing, or fussing... put turkey on a v-rack in a roasting pan, which worked well.

The herb baste is perfect. I also added lemon, orange and onion wedges inside the turkey to add more moisture and flavor (we don't make the stuffing inside the turkey). Best Thanksgiving turkey I have ever had!

This is the one I will use from this day forward! AWESOME. 

Had a 12.8 lb bird. Used a roasting bag this year and it made the turkey so juicy and moist! I substituted the water in the mixture with chicken broth. 

I also pulled the skin up & applied some butter with the mixture under the skin. Also inside the turkey (before adding my stuffing) and some on top of the skin. 

Rest of mixture went into the roasting bag with a lemon and some extra chicken broth for steam effect. Next year in the roasting bag I might add a garlic clove or an apple. 

For the last 45 minutes I took turkey out of the bag so the top could brown. Everyone raved. see my pic. yum!

This was incredibly easy and very flavorful.  I only made an 8 lb. turkey breast instead of a whole turkey, and it still worked out great.  Nice and brown on the outside, plenty moist on the inside, and lots of drippings for a yummy gravy.  I used poultry seasoning instead of sage simply because that was what I already had on hand, and I used chicken stock instead of water.  Delicious and the house smelled wondeful.  I will definitely be making this again.

After using the 24 hour citrus brine on this site, I used these spices mixed with butter and applied under the skin. 17 lb turkey cooked in 3 hours, I removed the foil and let it brown for 15 minutes. My FIL-who doesn't eat turkey-can't stop raving about this years Thanksgiving turkey...Super recipe!!!

Easy and tasty! I prepared as is and had enough to baste a 22 pound Turkey. First time using this recipe so just to play it safe I injected the breast meat with butter. Our Turkey was delicious not too dry not too moist and flavorful. Thanks for sharing :-)

My turkey was still bland, but it was probably because it was my first turkey and I soaked it in cold water for a long time to thaw it.

This was the first turkey i've ever attempted. I read the reviews and decided on this recipe. I'm so glad I did. The turkey was delicious and absolutely one of the best turkeys i've ever had if not the best! My husband was very impressed with it and said he can honestly say that this was the best turkey he's ever tasted. The turkey was very tender and seasoned perfectly. It really did just fall off the bone after attempting to carve. It was juicy and perfect. I used my hands to rub the turkey down instead of brushing it. I also rubbed all under the skin as much as possible and then drizzled extra olive oil all over the top before baking.(I seasoned the night before and then just added water and put in the oven the next morning) I actually cooked mine @275 degrees for about 5 hrs. I also had to turn the broil on for a few minutes at the end to achieve a nice brown skinned turkey. Will definitely use this recipe over and over again. Can't wait to roast a chicken with the same recipe.

My very first Thanksgiving and I was so stressed until I found your recipe!  It was simple and came out GREAT!!  Took others' advice and used half butter and half olive oil, rubbing the mixture under the skin, too.  My family raved about it...thanks!

Very good flavor.  Next time I will reduce the water to 1 cup.  There was so much water, that when I went to make my gravy, the juices were so clear that my gravy was too light.  other than that, I got compliments on this recipe.

I used this recipe on my turkey breast as never bake a whole turkey--we prefer the white meat. I basted the breast with the herbs and then placed it on a rack--I used a cookie rack and placed it in a jelly roll pan. (it's a good idea to spray the rack and the jelly roll pan so that the broth and tasty dark bits release easily). I then added chicken stock to the pan--2 cans (do not dilute). This does a great job of keeping the turkey moist and also adds to the flavor of the gravy. When the turkey breast was done, I combined 1 C of water with 1/2 c of all-purpose flour and whirled it in a blender. I strained the broth from the jelly roll pan into a skillet and then added some more canned chicken broth to the mixture. I do this by taste. You don't want to add too much and dilute the meat flavor of the mixture. Then I added a little poultry seasoning and brought it to a simmer. As it simmers add the flour mixture a little at a time to get the right consistency (you may not have to use all of it). After you get the proper thickness you want, then add a pinch of bakikng soda. I have been doing this for years--it actually adds flavor to the gravy and seems to disolve the grease on top.

The turkey was delicious, looked great, and smelled wonderful while baking. I will do this again. I used only 1/2 of the recipe for the 12 lb breast.

My husband AND kids raved about how tender and tasty this turkey was. I put 2 pats of butter under the skin of each breast and added several cloves of garlic a small quartered onion to the cavity before I roasted it. I will definatley be making this every year!

I have been making this turkey for years and I will never try another recipe.  It has never turned out dry and the drippings make spectacular gravy!  I double the recipe for a larger turkey as well.

I used melted butter instead of EVOO and chicken broth instead of water. I also added onion powder. Because I do not have a roasting pan with a lid, I used a roasting pan and foil. This made for a moist bird and a flavorful gravy. We would use this again but I don't think we would use basil again and maybe use poultry seasoning instead of plain sage. THAT IS NOT A REFLECTION ON THE RECIPE, just personal preference. As is, this would be excellent for roast chicken, IMO.

I have used this recipe 2 years in a row. Like one reviewer said, it is FALL OFF THE BONE tender. This year I kept it under cover for an additonal hour because it took FOREVER to brown last year, and it literally fell off the bone. I don't really care because the turkey gets carved before my guests arrive, and I'd rather have a moist bird than a pretty one. Also, I'm not a fan of olive oil, so this year I used butter. I also stuffed my bird with celery, onion, and apple. Depending on how my family feels about it this year, this may be my go to Turkey recipe for life.

This was the first turkey that I ever made. I made for a Christmas dinner. Everyone loved it it was so moist and tasty. While trying to carve it it was difficult to not want to stop eating. I used a rotisserie instead of an oven it was perfect. The skin crisped up sealing in the juices and was done a little quicker than in the oven. I will definitely be making this again.

I'm 37 and made my first Thanksgiving turkey ever today.  I always dreaded the day that I would be asked to host Thanksgiving because I feared making a dry, dull turkey that everyone ate out of sheer politeness.  Well, I made this today and I feel like a turkey-cooking pro!  Moist, flavorful, and DELICIOUS -- that is what this turkey was.  I will make it again and again.  THANK YOU!

This was the best turkey I have ever had.  Luckily, I had a person to help me spoon the mixture between the skin and the meat.  He held the turkey on it's end and I did the spooning.  Separating the skin from the meat was an easy job (started it with the fingers, and finished it by carefully shoving a spatula as far back as possible.

I followed the recipe accept for: no sage (none on hand), didn't cover the turkey at all, and I basted the turkey every 30 minutes throughout cooking. This was my VERY FIRST turkey I had made in my life...for my parents and inlaws on christmas, and it was amazing, I got compliments all around! Very juicy and the herbs gave it just enough something extra. THANKS SO MUCH for helping me make a wonderful christmas meal!!

Made this for Christmas and everyone loved it.  I substituted 1 can chicken broth for the water and put pats of butter under the skin.  Cooked at 325 for 2 1/2 hours and then at 350 for 1 1/2 hours.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I cooked this turkey for Thanksgiving...but it was not a well liked recipe by any of our guests (good thing I made extra stuffing and mash potatoes).  Our family  isn't "crazy" about garlic and it was way too over powering for our tastes.  It also left the turkey rather greasy instead of just moist and ended up throwing away the bottom part of the turkey instead of de-boning it after dinner.  It was worth a try, but I won't be using it again.

This turkey wasn't anything great. I followed the recipe exactly, except for adding some butter. Not sure what i did wrong, but it came out dry.

This was my first attempt at a turkey and everyone loved it! The only problem I faced was the cooking time, but that was due to the crappy oven we have in our apartment. Easy and tastes great!

Wow... that's all I have to say.  I've never had to cook a whole anything in my life, so was nervous about the Turkey. I'm living in the Netherlands, and didn't have access to a lot of the things I needed (ie. a roasting pan) so I made a LOT of improvisations.  I didn't have a brush, so just used my hands to spread the oil mixture on the outside and inside of the skin (messy, but it worked!).  I used a 4 Kilo (about 8.5 lb) Turkey and used all of the oil mixture.  I set in a pan, on top of cookie cutters and rolled up balls of foil, and poured chicken broth instead of water on the bottom of the pan.  I covered loosely with foil and baked in a gas oven for 3 hours 15 min, then removed the foil for another 10 min.  I stuffed the turkey with "Ibby's Pumpkin Mushroom Stuffing"  from this site before putting it in the oven, and everything came out PERFECT! The turkey was moist and wonderfully seasoned.  I will keep this recipe forever!

My husband just loved this!! He said this was the BEST turkey he has ever eaten. I loosened up the skin & put the olive oil mixture between the skin & the breast. I brushed melted butter on top of the turkey & then rubbed in salt & pepper. I roasted it covered for 3 hrs & then took the foil off & put it in the oven for another 30 min to crisp up the skin. Came out perfect!!

This really is a great recipe. My husband and kids raved how good the turkey tasted when I made it for them this past summer. I am excited about making it for Thanksgiving this year so that the ENTIRE family will have tasty meat.

Was a bit leary about using basil on a turkey but it turned out fine. Added butter, poultry seasoning and more sage.

I cut the olive oil to 1/3 cup and added 1/3 cup butter to the mix, loosened the skin and rubbed the mix under the skin. I also baked the turkey upside down to help the breast meat stay moist.  It tasted really good, but it was almost greasy.  The drippings did make nice gravy, but again that was oilier than normal, as well.  If I decide to use this again, I will reduce the oil and butter even more.

This was so delicious.  I used the same amount of flavorings for my 14 pound bird and it worked fine.  I did and some finely chopped roasted garlic under and on top of the skin.  I also stuffed the bird with a lemon sliced in half, an onion, some fresh rosemary and some roasted garlic cloves.  I cooked it breast down and the meat was very juicy.

This turkey was so tender and juicy and looked very professional as well!  I roasted my 14.5 lb turkey for about 4 hours.  I stuffed some garlic, celery, and a small apple in the carcass just for fun.

awesome!!!! The turkey turned out moist and tender. I roasted the turkey breast side down and that really helped!!! Also the dripings make a really good gravy because of the seasonings.

Using the olive oil is not the best thing to do I believe. It falls off the turkey into the bottom of the pan and tends to burn. ALso I found that the temp given in the recipe was too low. I had to turn my turkey up to 375.

This was a great recipe.  I made some changes and placed chunks of butter under the skin along with some on the seasoning.  It was so moist and tender.  The cooking time seemed off but that could have just been my oven.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was so easy and so good! This was my first year to do Thanksgiving and this recipe made the turkey a breeze. Per another review I made a batch of the herb mixture the night before and injected between the skin and the turkey and also put some on the outside of the turkey. Instead of water I used chicken broth when I cooked it. The turkey came out moist, juicy, and great!

I used this recipe for the first turkey I ever made and it turned out delicious!!  I stuffed the inside of the turkey with 1/2 an onion, about 5 cloves of garlic, and some fresh basil and sage as well and it was even more flavorful.  And it turned out exceptionally juicy as well.  I will use this recipe each time I make a turkey from now on!!!

This was the first recipe I tried after my husband and I moved to North America from Europe and I haven't given any other a shot! He had been invited to a few Thanksgiving parties and said he hated turkey because it was so dry, but agreed to give it one more shot.

For almost ten years now I've been using this recipe at least twice a year and the only change I made to it was to loosen the skin, rub most of the oil and herb mix onto the meat, and skip the basting.

So easy, so delicious and definitely worth saving!

LIKE OMG. I cannot believe how good this turned out. This was my first time cooking a turkey, and I was really anxious about it, but it turned out incredibly juicy and flavorful. I liked the taste of this turkey more than ANY other turkey I've ever had. I'm keeping this and passing it on. Dear recipe submitter, you are a heroine.

Every year for Thanksgiving I make at least 3 very large turkeys (25 lbs+) and this is always the recipe I turn to. With this I know I can just set it and forget it, and it comes out so moist and flavorful every time.

I've been making the recipe for a few years and I love it. It is delicious and people will rave about it. When we eat by ourselves, my boyfriend says "I can't believe people aren't here to eat this delicious turkey!" 
I make it as the recipe states but like my skin more brown then this comes out. I put the oven to 375 for the last half an hour and remove the lid/foil.

This was the first Thanksgiving that i was in charge of the turkey....and it was at my house for the first time ever too!  I was super nervous and didn't even have anything to cook a turkey in!  I was sure that this would be a disaster and that we would have to go out to eat but THIS IS THE EASIEST RECIPE EVER!  This recipe make the turkey moist and delicious an all with almost no effort!  I didn't have to baste and the cooking time was almost exact to what the recipe said.  The herbs made my place smell delicious and the turkey turned out perfect.  We will definitely be using this recipe again!  Better yet it was SUPER EASY!

I used this recipe last year for Thanksgiving. It was my first turkey ever. It was juicy and falling off the bone. I definitely will be making it again this year. Also, I followed the recipe exactly, no substitutions were made.

I've always opted out of making the turkey because of all the basting that had to be done.  This recipe takes it out of the process, and to my and my husband's amazement, produced a turkey more juicy and tender than the ones we used to baste.  It was falling off the bone delicious.  The skin was not crispy, and I know some people like that, but we don't eat it anyway. 
This is the way we're going to make it for Thanksgiving this year, most certainly!

very very good! i didn't have basil so i substituted 2 tsp thyme and 1 tsp oregano in place of it. i also placed this turkey in an oven bag and marinated it over night in the mixture. this was the first turkey that i had where the flavor went through out all the meat and not just on the surface!

This was an easy and simple turkey recipe.  Everone loved it.  I did it in a roaster to save oven space and it came out perfect.  the skin was nice and crunchy and the flavor was perfect.  The only extra I did was inject the breast with melted butter befor cooking because I am deathly afraid dry white meat.  PERFECT TURKEY.

Awesome, enough said follow the recipe do not add butter. But do add paprika all over the ouside. It gives the turkey a great golden brown look. Just posted my pic has the 2 pieces of tinfoil covering other dishes in the background.

This really was easy, and totally delicious. I made it in a turkey bag and it came out golden without ever having to baste it.  I got a tip from a church lady to put the turkey into the bag after it's cleaned, and before doing anything else because it keeps it from getting messy. I'm so glad I knew this because I don't think I could have gotten it into the bag once it was stuffed and the seasonings were on it. It also smelled AMAZING about halfway through cooking.  I had a 12 pound turkey and it took 3.5 hours.

Because Hubby doesn't eat skin, I put some of the olive oil/herb mixture between the skin and meat.  It was SO moist and flavorful!!!!   I did remove the cover with 1 hour left to assist browning.  Everybody raved about how excellent this came out!

This make a great turkey, but awful gravy. The olive oil is too much to try to salvage any of the drippings for homemade gravy.

This was my 1st-ever turkey & it turned out really great!!! The white meat was a tiny bit dry, but that was completely my fault - got preoccupied with some finicky sweet potatoes and left it in the oven sans foil for longer than I'd intended. I did follow other reviews by removing the foil (don't have a lid) for the last 30-45 minutes of cooking, using chicken broth instead of water, stuffing with onions/minced garlic, and sprinkling generously with paprika for extra color. This will be my base turkey recipe for years to come!!! Only thing I'd do differently next time would be not leaving it in too long, and using less oil & more herbs in the rub mix. Yum!!!

All I can say is, "WOW"! I used a stick of softened butter & added all of the herbs to it the night before (another member suggested this and it was great!) then put it in the fridge to harden for the next morning. I also added herbs to olive oil and let them sit overnight. I used the pats of butter for in between the skin and meat and used the olive oil mixture for the skin. I cooked the 20-lb turkey in a roaster and it was fantastic! I couldn't believe how moist it was and neither could my family! Thanks so much for a great recipe!

No dry turkey breast here!  At least not if you loosen the skin and baste the oil/herb mixture under it.  (Just slide your hand between the skin and the meat as much as you can.  Then stick the baster tip under the skin in several areas to release that tasty oil/herb mixture.)  Best turkey we've ever tasted.  My husband couldn't stop eating it!

Made this recipe to a "T". Smelled great roasting, looked pretty when done, but disapointed in the taste of the turkey. Will try again but with much less olive oil though. Might have had an off day for cooking. :-)))))

So easy and so delicious!  I used a rack and had to add more water... I also saved what was left over from the oil/spices and basted it again before it was done.  Perfect!

Wow, what a moist and delicious bird! My family likes more traditional turkey, so I scaled back on the herbs just a bit (about half) and I actually just softened the butter so it was kinda paste like. I carefully seperated the skin from the breast and spread the butter mixture underneath. I used what was left over on top of the bird. It came out beautifully browned and so full of moist flavor. Went great with traditional mashed potatoes.

Due to a change in plans, I got to let this marinate 24 hours prior to cooking.  Great recipe.  Flavorful, moist and tender.  Be sure to get the rub under the skin.  This got rave reviews from a die-hard: turkey-is-best-cooked-in-the-weber (grill) relative!

Took another review's advice and gently worked the skin away from the turkey and put all the seasoning underneath the skin - the turkey was much more flavorful and moist... I think at Christmas I am going to try baking the turkey upside down and turning it over the last half hour to brown the top.  Very nice recipe and had lots of compliments from the guests!

I don't actually eat meat...but I had to do Thanksgiving turkey because I'm the chef in the house. It was received with rave reviews and a few "this is better than my mom's" comments. I didn't try it, but I think it is a good recipe for meat eaters!

With this turkey I received a comment that it was "the best turkey she had ever had."  It is very moist.  I took the tip to roast the turkey breast side down.  I didn't put any of the oil mixture under the skin- that is more work.  It had just enough flavor.  It was nice to not have to baste it.  I took the cover off during the last hour of the baking to brown.

I really liked this recipe. I was looking for a simple recipe for my first ever turkey. The only things I did differently was instead of water I used chicken stock, instead of sage I used poultry seasoning , and I put pats of butter under the skin. Turned out fantastic and will definitely use this recipe again in the future.

It was my first Thanksgiving, first turkey, first time cooking for all my boyfriends family, and it turned out AMAZING and picture perfect.  Tasted great!  I had a 20 lb turkey, I made the spice mix ahead of time, did about 1 1/2 times the spices, added some butter and put it in the fridge overnight, and in the morning spread it under the skin.  I filled the cavity with celery, onion, carrot, and a green apple.  Someone said it was the best turkey they ever tasted because of the spices.  And it made the BEST gravy!  Thank you so much for this recipe.

I've used a nesco or roaster to make my turkeys for the past three years, and every year I always forget that it takes much LESS time to cook my bird then in the oven! I think the first year I used my roaster I turned up the heat to brown the top but in subsequent years I just made sure that the bird wasn't overcooked and dry.  We're not into presentation as much...we just like the food to be done when we want to eat!!  I would highly recommend this be cooked in a nesco if you have issues with oven space, or just want to try something new.  The temperature given in the recipe is spot on, at least from the standpoint of using a nesco. The time it took to cook my turkey was less, about 2-3/4 hours so I had to lower the temp and keep basting until it was time to carve.  All in all, I would definitely use this recipe again.

This was my very first Thanksgiving turkey and wow, it was a knockout.  I followed the recipe to the letter, making sure to get the oil spice mixture under the skin as well.  I cooked the turkey with my own stuffing until the breast came to an internal temp of 161.  I then took it out of the oven and tented it with foil on the counter for 20 min and it got up to the reccomended 180 degrees.  Moist and flavorful throughout the bird.  The leftovers the next day were moist and you could still tast the spices, even the white meat was stil moist. My mother, who has been cooking the family turkey for 50 years, could not belive how moist the turkey came out.  My husband and I agreed it was better than hers.  Thanks for an easy, flavorful and moist bird.  Why try anything else, this one is a perfect 10!

This is my 2nd Christmas using this turkey recipe and it turned out great each time. Very simple and tasty. I also used the easy turkey gravy recipe to go along with this.

mmmmm, we really liked the taste of the herb blend & how it kept our turkey moist. no changes needed aside from scaling the recipe back to 4 servings as i was only baking half of a fresh turkey breast (nearly 3 lbs. ~ 1 3/4 hr.) for the two of us. i didn't have a roasting pan either so i put the meat on a rack in a deep medium size pan & tented it with tightly edged aluminum foil. not long after our thanksgiving feast i caught my boyfriend picking the rest of the meat from the bones! there's a subtle compliment for you, lisa. thanks!

Very nice. I brined for 14 or so hours first, using the brine recipe from this site, then cooked as indicated in this recipe. I also rubbed butter under the skin and stuffed w/ onions, celery, an apple and an orange, and some garlic.

Just a nice and yummy turkey.

I've made this two Thanksgivings in a row, and this is my third. I always come back for the recipe. As I can't follow a recipe exactly, I usually add a couple of carrots, a quartered onion and a few stalks of celery to the cavity, and I always use the "high heat method": 400 F until thickest part of thigh reads 170. Delicious!

I made first turkey this Thanksgiving and was so pleased with how this turned out that we made it again for Christmas and they were both perfect.  I hate dry turkey.  This turned out nicely moist and the herbs were not too strong.  I'll continue to use this.

I made this in a oven roaster, and on second thought, should have removed the skin before cooking. Otherwise I would have given this turkey recipe with a WONDERFUL blend of herbs in olive oil, five stars.

Really simple recipe that turned out great!  I took it a step further, however, by loosening the skin of the turkey and placed an herb mixture with butter under the skin (thyme, sage and rosemary mixed with room temp butter).  I also placed onion, lemon, bell peppers and oranges in the cavity of the bird.  The aroma was delicious and teh actual bird was even better!!

Oh my gosh I'd give this more stars if possible.  My family raved that this was the best turkey I've ever made.  It smelled so good we could hardly wait to eat it.  I followed the recipe exactly then put my 20 lb. turkey into a cooking bag and it was done perfectly and so moist after 3 1/2 hours.  Oh the gravy!  It didn't need any extra seasonings added.  This is the best recipe and I will be using it many more times!

I thought this recipe was OK. I prefer to do my turkey on the rotissery. I just thought I would try something different. Wasn't really pleased. Smelled good while cooking though. Family really didn't have much to say.

I love turkey----but----turkey is turkey, and I was cautious to think that this recipe would be better then how I usually make my turkey.  Well, it was better!  Not a lot better, but enough to notice it was more flavorful. I would cut the water back some though and/or use some chicken broth.

This recipe is outstanding.  It is the first time that everyone commented how great the turkey tasted. It was so moist.  Once I loosened the skin, I used a turkey baster to get the liquid under the skin.  It was alot quicker than using a brush. I did change one thing.  I added 1 cup of white wine and 1/2 cut of water to the bottom.  But overall, this is an excellent recipe - try it.

Wow!  I am so impressed at how this turkey came out!  The most juicy turkey I have ever had.  I didn't have any garlic powder, so I minced some fresh garlic instead.  I brushed the mix under the skin with a couple of butter pats as was suggested.  I used a little too much of the olive oil mix, and my gravy was a little oily, but it was still excellent!  Thank you Lisa

I've been having Thanksgiving for the last 8 years and this by far was the best turkey yet.  I will be using only this recipe from now on.  Very juicy and tender, and everyone asked for the recipe. I also used some butter as was recommended by others and put the mixture under the skin of the turkey. Excellent!!

WOW!!! I'm not a turkey fan but my husband and mother-in-law are. I don't care for  turkey because to me its always dry, and tasteless. came across this when It was requested for Easter dinner, I took some others reviewer ideas but kept the main ingredients. had a 11 1/2 lbs turkey, cut up unsalted butter and put under skin, I also had infused roasted garlic olive oil made locally in Buffalo so used half and reg  store bought olive oil...  made the rub  and painted it on ,  in and around the skin... made a easy stuffing from this sites (do ahead suffing) and oh my word, the aroma from this turkey made my house smell wonderful, once was done and cut up I couldn't keep any on the plate fast enough, during dinner  no one talked, all you heard was clink of sliver ware, was the juiciest turkey ever and now will be a staple recipes that will be passed down. thank you for sharing..

My first turkey ever and it turned out amazing!!! I have a 50/50 success rate when I cook so I'm not spectacular when it comes to cooking but this recipe is fantastic!! Followed it to a T and I'm still receiving rave reviews of my bird 2 months after Thanksgiving.

It was okay, but we simply didn't like it much. It was too oily. Honestly, I don't have much to complain about with this recipe, but I don't have much to rave about, either.

Delicious!! I did flip my bird over breast down half way through, I also used garlic infused chicken broth instead of water. And I always put butter on the turkey.  There was barely two cups of turky leftover!

This recipe makes a tasty bird. But.....not a beautiful centerpiece.  I love how flavorfull the addition of the herbs  are and what I love most was the absence of butter.  The olive oil browned the bird beautifully even uncovered ( I never needed to remove the lid to brown the turkey). I used garlic salt instead of powder and omitted the regular salt. I also rubbed the oil/seasoning under the skin.  My complaints are;  there was soooo much liquid that the wings were fully submerged and therefore never browed. It was if they were boiled.  And.....the turkey just completely fell apart when trying to move it to a platter.   I guess I really would only would care about this if I needed a very pretty "company" turkey centerpiece.   Overall, great tasting,  super easy recipe. I recommend cutting the liquid by at least half though.

Turkey had a nice flavor, it was soft and juicy. Literally falling off the bone.
I did double the ingredients only because we like flavorful meat. I did use a turkey bag and opened it to give bird color.
Very good, everyone enjoyed it. will definitely use this recipe again.

Best turkey I ever made! The combinations of herbs really makes it delicious. I soaked it in a herb-rich brine the night before to make it even juicier.

Made turkey for the first time EVER and my entire family absolutely loved it. This was an amazing very easy recipe to do. I had a 13 pound turkey and I made a few changes: I used chicken stock on the bottom of the pan and cut up some potatoes to roast. In the cavity I put in some potatoes and onions and it was delicious.  When it was being carved everyone said how the meat was falling off the bones which was a sign of the Turkey being cooked perfectly. I was so nervous but am so happy I did it. Thank you so much for sharing this amazing recipe! I have now made a family tradition.

Excellent. Excellent. Excellent!!!

I always try these recipes as written the first time I make it. I can't think of a thing I would change. The turkey was brown, tender, juicy and had wonderful flavor. This will be my go to recipe for Thanksgiving.

I first tried this recipe for my first turkey several years ago.  It came out perfect the first and every time since and I see no reason to mess with it or try another.  If this is your first or 20th turkey I highly recommend this recipe!

Delicious! This was my first time cooking a turkey, and it turned out perfect!! Thank you Lisa! Few extra steps in my preperation were to include a whole onion, some carrots and celery inside of the turkey along with the butter compound. Additionally, I roasted the turkey breast side down in a roaster. I can't imagine any recipe being better, let alone actually trying another one!! Thanks so much!

We've used this recipe for two years now and my family loves it.  Although the recipe calls for a covered roasting pan, we've had to use one without a cover and the turkey still comes out incredibly juicy.  The taste is incredible.

This recipe calls for 3 to 3 1/2 hours.  I cooked it for 4 and it was still bloody.  It took close to 7 1/2 hours for it to completely be done.  It was very, very dry.  We pretty much had the choice between bloody or the driest we've ever had.  I really wanted it to be good, but it just wasn't.

we didn't pick up our turkey until the day before thanksgiving and the afternoon of my husband asked me how to cook it, i've never cooked a turkey before so how would i know. of course i came on here to see what i could find hoping it wouldn't wind up bland and dry. our options were limited by what we had on hand which is why this was picked for our dinner and it turned out great!  we didn't have the right pan, so covered with foil and we left out the sage (on purpose) and we still ended up with a tasty and juicy turkey and are looking forward to left overs :-) best part of the meal :-)

I have made this turkey for the last two years for thanksgiving and I always get rave reviews.  I usually make sure to baste under the skin as well as ontop and instead of stuffing, I drizzle some of the mixture inside the cavity and the rest goes in the pan with the broth.  After that, I remove the foil about 45 minutes or so before its done for browning and it just falls off the bone and for the last two years there have been no left overs.  Perhaps this year there won't be any left overs either.

Why do people rave about the recipes then tell us all the changes they made? That makes no sense to me. Make it the way the recipe states then rate it.. than make your changes. I made it just like it says.. Turned out very tender and juicy. I will use this recipe again.

Thanksgiving is hands down my favorite holiday! I don't know if it is because it is the first of the holiday season and almost like the welcoming of winter to me but I love it! So even though it is the end of summer there is nothing stopping me from stocking up on new recipes. I work with Better Recipes and I always find myself storing away Thanksgiving Recipes.  Every I find one I smile and think of enormous family trying it. This recipes looks so easy and based on the other reviews it sounds like a hit! I can't wait until November to try this one out!

I cut into the skin and push the rub into the bird.  Drippings make a great gravy.

We loved this! The turkey turned out great... and the gravy was superb! I used this same recipe to roast a chicken and it was just as good. Great job!

This turkey was delicious! I read the reviews and followed a couple of different suggestions. I added butter to the recipe. I cut 6 pats of butter from a stick and soaked them in the olive oil mixture and then shoved them under the turkey skin. Not suggested but something I did was put apple slices in the cavity for aromatics. I used paprika to fake tan the turkey. The last 15 mins or so I rubbed the turkey with butter, sprinkled it with paprika and left it uncovered. It came out wonderfully moist and tender. In the end I used the juice with some pepper and flour to make gravy!

This turned out really well. Instead of putting it in pan with a lid I left it uncovered & basted it once every hour & it turned out VERY juicy. Big hit!

This recipe was mine and my husbands first attempt at cooking a turkey by ourselves and let me say that it is beyond delicious! We double the recipe for the seasoning but used half butter and half oil when doubled.  We also stuffed a head of garlic, lemon, and onion inside the cavity for more flavor as well as put the rub in between the skin and the meat of the turkey. We then cooked it covered with foil for the first 2 1/2 hours then uncovered it the last 1 1/4 hour.  Let's just say that this will be used as our Christmas turkey and we are in charge of it now.  This is HIGHLY recommended!

I doubled the recipe and injected half of it into the breast before putting the turkey into the oven.  It was delicious.

After reading all the great reviews on this recipe... I just had to try it... One word... WONDERFUL... I simply love it and it will be the only recipe I use for holidays... I followed the recipe as written except i took a reviewer's suggestion and sprinkled a generous amount of paprika on the top... Delicious and moist... This is a must try... Oh yes I also used 1 cup of broth and just 1 cup of water and I used the mix under the skin as well as on top...

Tried this recipe this year and it turned out great.  I did use homemade turkey broth instead of water, and as others suggested, lifted the breast skin to spread the oil/herb mixture. I did prepare the turkey the night before which allowed the meat to get marinated with the oil mixture. The next morning I rebasted the turkey and discovered that it was much easier to baste, now that the oil/herb mixture was refrigerated. The night before, the mixture just seemed to slide down. However, when it was cold, it really spread so much easier and stuck to the skin better. My suggestion is to make the oil/herb mixture the day before. I also suggest adding paprika to the mix and increasing the quantity of herbs.

I actually got a round of applause after making this turkey.  Followed the recipe exactly, the only thing I did differently was first rub the turkey down with half a stick of melted butter (both over and under the skin).  Everyone kept commenting on how juicy it was.  This is my new Thanksgiving turkey recipe!

The aroma of this turkey filled the house within five minutes of putting it in the oven.  Seriously.  It smelled great and tasted fantastic.  It was also really easy to make.  I will definately use this recipe again.

This was so good.  I was a little worried about seasoning it with garlic and basil - I didn't want an Italian thanksgiving!  But it tastes mostly like the sage (but better), which was just what I wanted.  My husband was in charge of testing for doneness, and I think we may have overcooked it a bit because the breasts were a little dry, but the rest was amazingly juicy.  We uncovered it for the last 30 min to brown.  It came out a beautiful golden brown.  I also think that I would put a little more water in the bottom next time to create more Pan drippings as the gravy made from them was so good.  I will definitely be using this again.

YUM! I used the olive oil and herbs on a chicken.  After roasting for about 2.5 hours, the chicken was the most tender, moist, and delicious chicken we have ever had. SO good! Will be using this many times!

Great turkey.  I gave it four stars because if you don't let it marinade over night it won't absorb moisture/flavor very much!

I have made this Turkey twice now and both times it has been delicious! I had to cook it without the water in the bottom since I only had a 9x13 pan to cook it in, therefore no rack. So, to try and seal in the juices I cooked it uncovered until lightly browned and then covered with tinfoil... then also took the tinfoil off for the last 45 min of cooking to brown it up some more. I think next time I might try as the other reviewers suggested and rub some of the herb mix under the skin to give it more flavor! But, over all a wonderful recipe!

All I can say is OMG!!! My two non-turkey eaters, both ate this and said it was the best turkey they'd had. They don't eat turkey because its to dry. I followed the directions to a T. I put the majority of the herbs and oil under the skin. I covered it with foil and then made another half batch and basted it with  it the last half hour.  It was awesome, it was extremely moist and had a great flavor.  The leftovers today are just as good.  Thank you for a great recipe

I mixed this recipe with the "Michangander Way" recipe and it turned out perfectly. It was my first try at Thanksgiving dinner, and it went very well. So, what I did was follow this recipe, plus I cut up a stick of butter and put it in various places under the skin of the bird, concentrating on the breast. It was very moist, and really good.

If a 20something grad student who can't tell a knife from a fork in the kitchen can make a Turkey with restaurant-quality taste, ANYONE can! I baked a small 10lb Turkey using this recipie and it turned out absolutely delicious. The skin was crunchy, well-seasoned, but not greasy, and the meat was absolutely unforgetable. Thanks for making my 1st cooking experience a total success!

Didn't rave over this one.  I had no sage and my Turkey didn't cook all the way through even after 4+ hours (13 lb Turkey).  Perhaps my oven runs a bit low.  Made an excellent gravy though.  Perhaps if I had a Turkey bag or a lid for my roaster the results would have been better.  Using foil didn't work super well this year.

for a 12 pound turkey at 325 it would take a lot longer than 3 1/2 hours to cook. I always cook my turkeys at 325. They tend to be alittle less dry. The turkey is basted with the olive oil and herbs not smothered in it. The olive oil should not pour off of the turkey if it is you are putting on too much of the oil and herb mixture. Think about painting a room. You put on enough paint to coat the walls not so much the paint pools on the floor under the walls. Doing this the turkey juices should be flavored with the herbs not oily.

Could it have been any easier???  Followed the directions but just added a bit of melted butter...oh my, soooooooo good!  Last year I did the whole brine concoction deal...waste of time.  This was 100x's easier and 100x's better tasting.

I just used this recipe for my first turkey ever and it was delicious. Everyone raved and said it was the best turkey they've ever had. I brined our 18 lb turkey for 30 hours using the "Out of this World Turkey Brine" recipe on this site, and then followed this recipe. I put the bird in breast-side down until the last 45 minutes of cooking, too. 
It was delicious. Moist, flavorful, perfect. I will definitely use this recipe again next Thanksgiving.

This is the best turkey I have EVER tasted!!  I don't like turkey very much and usually only eat ham during the holidays.  I tried this recipe because I wanted to make my very first Thanksgiving dinner and I was stunned at how delicious this turkey was.  It is so moist and flavorful!

This is an excellent marinade for a turkey.  I used this recipe exactly as printed.  I did use my hand to spread the marinade up under the turkey skin so it would cover the breast meat.  I put this herb/oil mixture on the bird the evening before I am going to bake it.  The breast meat is so flavorful and tender every time!  My family is always impressed with my turkey.  This means a great deal to me as I stopped cooking the turkey the same way my family cooked it for four generations!  I have started a new tradition with this recipe (the last four years). Thanks so much!

This was absolutely delicious! I made this for my first ever Thanksgiving Turkey...for family and friends in Australia who had never celebrated Thanksgiving before. They were all very impressed and said it was the best Turkey they'd ever had. The turkey was golden, crispy and moist, and The juices make the base for a beautiful gravy. One tip my Mom gave me - I cooked the turkey upside down- all the fat from the dark meat runs down to baste the other meat. It was great!  Another tip I got from Jaime Oliver- I rubbed the buttery mixture not only on the skin, but under the skin as well. I didn't use stuffing, but popped a half an apple and half an onion in the cavity for flavor. It was devine!! I will definately use this recipe as a starting point for my next Thanksgiving Downunder!

I use this recipe to cook my first ever 14.5 lbs turkey last Thanksgiving and it turned out soo beautiful.. The yummiest turkey ever. It took a bit longer for me to cook the turkey (almost 6 hours) but it was definitely worth it. As one of the reviews before mentioned, you should open the lid/foil and have it uncovered for the last 45 mins or so to brown the outside. I think I will baste it more often when I leave it uncovered to make it more moist. Thank you for sharing this recipe.. My friends actually thought I've had experience roasting a turkey before..

Nice flavor, I really spent a lot of time rubbing it into the breast under the skin and then I rubbed it on top of the skin and although everyone raved about it I still felt the breast was too dry. I passed on putting the butter under the skin, thinking it might have been too much. The dark meat was perfect, juicy and tender. The gravy  was DEVINE, so flavorful and rich!! I just took the drippings added 2 cups of water and mixed 2tbsp cornstarch with warm water into it. Nice recipe, will use again but will probably add the butter next time!

Wonderful recipe. This was my first attempt at making a turkey and it came out great. I made a few modifications. I added thyme and rosemary to the herbs. I also cut large chunks of onion and bell pepper and placed them in the pan and cavity of the turkey.  Covered with foil and baked on 250-300 for about 12 hours.  Everyone loved it. It was so moist and tender it was falling off the bone.

This was pretty good, I will say.  The olive oil made the difference here, the meat was very juicy and tender (especially on the leg joints, it just fell off the bone).  I didn't pour the oil mixture on, but used my hands and rubbed it in all over the bird, making sure to pay attention to the breast meat in particular.  Slight alteration - I used minced garlic and garlic salt instead of regular salt and garlic powder - I don't think it made too much of a difference.  Great tasting meat.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was OK for the Turkey I made this year.  But it was GREAT for some game hens I made last week.  Try it on other more flavorfull birds.

I rubbed my turkey with Country Crock Churn spread instead of with oil and I added a can of Roasted Garlic Chicken broth.  My turkey was so juicey and tender (it falling off of the bones), you couldn't tell the white meat from the dark!

This was an amazing tasting turkey and smelled great. My only critique is that the drippings were way too greasy because of the extra oil that was included in the rub. I made a 24 lb turkey and doubled the rub which meant double oil...don't think I would do that again. Had to skim lots of oil off before the gravy woudl really come together. That is the only reason I took it down one star. I also did not have a cover so made a really good foil tent and kept it on until the last thirty minutes. Super moist!

I followed directions, except adjusting for a 19lb Turkey. It came out very moist and had good flavor. I gave it 4 stars because my mother likes to eat the skin but didn't like the herbs that were on it. No one else had any complaints and ate like piglets. I will use the recipe again. Thanks for submitting.

Perfect recipe. I actually had an 18lb turkey and cooked it for only 3 hours and it was very very moist. The herbs that the recipe calls for soaked in wonderfully and wasn't overwhelming. Recipe def a keeper for future thanksgiving dinners!

I'm sure I don't even need to rate this recipe it already has such good reviews.. but I *HAD* to say it:

I used this recipe for my first ever time making turkey and this is the BEST I have ever tasted!!

I only did two things different...1. used a Reynold's oven bag instead of a tent. 2. ran out of olive oil and used half butter half olive oil mixture. 
 
It was DELICIOUS!!

I made this recipe for last year's T'giving and it was super. I made it again this year because it was super. I roast my turkey in an oven bag, and also put some of the spread on the inside cavities. Everyone raved about it last year, and this year too. Another keeper.

I made this turkey last year.  It was my first time making the Thanksgiving turkey.  It got absolutely rave reviews from everyone.  I've been elected to make it again this year.  Yay!  That means I don't have to make anything else!
**This is my fourth year making this recipe.  It is perfect!  I get so many compliments.

WOW, that's all I can say... WOW!  Very juicy, flavorful, and I didn't have one bite leftover!!  I cooked in in my extra big slow cooker to save oven space (which cooks the turkey in half the time) and it was so moist and tender, it fell apart!
Thanks!

This was a hit!  I made it for Thanksgiving and plan on making it again for Christmas.  I had many compliments stating it was the best turkey they ever had and not to tell their moms they said that.  Unfortunately, I didn't get much of it since it was gone so quick.  No leftovers this Thanksgiving!

Turkey came out great.  I didn't change anything.  We had the turkey the first night and with the leftovers had turkey burritos the next night, and turkey noodle lemon soup the following night.  One day I'll post my turkey noodle lemon soup recipe! YUM!

This recipe was fantastic! I used it last year for my first Thanksgiving dinner.  It was easy and turned out great!  I think my mom was a little jealous that my first turkey was just as good as hers (if not better)!

Awesome. I infused the oil with the seasonings the night before and the turkey was wonderfully aromatic while roasting. The turkey came out moist and tender. An added benefit comes from making the gravy with the drippings, which I think was the best I've ever tasted.

The turkey was moist, but it took much longer than the 3 1/2 hours at 325 degrees.  Over 5 hours and it still wasn't done.  Maybe it's my oven?  Doesn't seem like many people had a problem with the temp.

I used this recipie last year and I LOVED it! I had recently gotten married and moved far away from my family to be with my husband so I really had no one to help me make my first Thanksgiving Dinner, and I had never cooked before. This was a wonderful recipe! It was so easy and the outcome was perfect, I would reccomend this recipe to anyone!

This was easy to put together, and the flavor was fantastic.  My bird was smaller, so I cut the oil to 1/2 cup.  I also put cut up lemons and limes in the cavity.  I was really happy with the taste (although for some reason mine took FOREVER to come to temp).

It baked my first turkey this thanksgiving using this recipe. My husband said I make better turkey than my Mother-in-Law (truly a great compliment), AND asked me to make another one a few weeks later!  This is a great, easy way to make savory turkey with an aromatic herb taste. Leftovers make fantasitc sandwiches! I don't think the drippings would make good gravy, so buy gravy packets to compensate if you like gravy. Make sure that the olive oil covers the turkey breast very thoroughly. My first turkey turned out better than my second because I used too thin of a marinade on the second. Make sure the turkey is adequately slippery all over!

This turkey was very good - but from all the rave reviews I thought it would be something extra special.  It was tasty and moist ... and tasted like my turkeys always do.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This dish was wonderful!  I came to my mother in law's last week for the holiday season and made this turkey for a fun weekend dinner - the first turkey I'd made by myself.  She loved it so much she asked me to cook it again for the big family Christmas dinner instead of the roast she's been saving!  Now how is that for praise?  :)

The pan drippings make a fantastic base for gravy to make a meal with all the fixings, also.

I have never cooked a turkey before (mainly because I always thought that others' were too dry), but I got a turkey on sale and decided to try it.  I didn't have sage, but I added some thyme and rosemary.  I put some butter pats under the skin and cut up an apple and an onion and put half inside the cavity and half under the roasting rack.  The turkey was so tender that the meat pracically fell off!!  This was an awesome recipe!! I'm sure that it would be just as good if I didn't add the extra things.  I will definately be cooking a turkey again.

I have been cooking turkeys for many years but this was the best I have ever cooked.  I have always used just a tent of foil over the bird. I made this recipe just as it is and it is wonderful.  It was juicy not dry and it did get brown beautifully.  Every body loved it.  Thank you thank you.

We thought this was very good.  I put the herb mixture between the skin in the meat the night before.  The meat definitely had a nice flavor and it was moist - but I also did not cook the stuffing in the bird because the longer cooking time tends to dry the meat. The drippings made great gravy.

I have used this recipe every Thanksgiving for at least 7 years now and it comes out fabulous every time!  Doesn't matter what brand of turkey you get - so keep it inexpensive.   Make sure to use the covered roasting pan and you'll have the perfect turkey!

I used 2 Tbsp poultry seasoning instead of the other spices and added 1 tbsp of Kosher Salt. Tented my Turkey for first half with foil then removed to get that perfect skin. Trust me, this recipe is amazing.

I made 3 changes. First I opted to use melted butter instead of oil. Second, instead of sage, I used poultry seasoning. The third and final change was chicken broth in place of the water. I will use this again if and when I have a turkey. Best turkey ever.

Excellent. Never made a turkey before until now and it came out so juicy. I used a thawed turkey about 10 pounds and cut an hour out of the cooking time and it was perfect. Very moist for turkey and flavorful!

This was my first time making a turkey and was super nervous making it.  All the reviews gave me confidence so i gave it a try.  This is a must try recipe!  My family loved it even my father who makes comments on everything said it was good. I followed the recipe for my 18lb turkey with double the seasoning and instead of water, I used chicken broth.  I also took off the foil 45 mins towards the end for the browning color.  This recipe os a keeper!

My very first turkey EVER! I thought it turned out pretty good. I followed the directions except I put the spices in softened butter because I wasn't sure how to get the oil under the skin. Do you use a basting syringe or just your hands?? Also it was a 23 lb. turkey because we have a lot of people.

Thank goodness my sister was there to help. She showed me all of the things to pull out and then I began trying to get under the skin and was having the hardest time. Finally, she said, "Are you going to cook it upside down?" LOL! No wonder I couldn't get under the skin! We flipped it over and she showed me how easy it was. So I rubbed the spiced butter all under it then rubbed it all over it too. Cooked it at 325 for 4 and 1/2 hours under foil. Took the foil off as someone suggested the last hour to brown it. I think that's where I went wrong. Should've kept it under the whole time. The breast was wonderfully moist and I was complimented on the seasoning. But the dark meat was pink. (This actually worked out good when microwaving it later - it didn't dry out.) Anyway, thanks for the recipe!

I used these exact proportions for a 22lb bird and it was perfect.  I stress over my Thanksgiving turkey every year.  I chose this recipe because it was Dairy free so it was safe for our allergies. This was my best bird ever. The meat was super moist and delicious.  I’m keeping this one and following it every year!!

This recipe has been my go-to for Thanksgiving for several years. It never fails. Hands down this recipe delivers the most delicious, moist, flavorful turkey you could ask for. I adjusted to accomodate a 22 lb bird. It was perfect.

Easy is right! Knew I would be cooking solo this year so I was looking for something that tastes impressive without a lot of work and this was so flavorful and effortless. Used a pre-brined bird and made exactly as written. Basting often is key.

This was my first time ever cooking the Thanksgiving turkey and it turned out great!! It was quick and easy prep work and took approximately 3 hours from start to finish for our 15lb turkey.  It was super juicy and falling off the bone!! The changes I made were roasting the turkey in a Reynolds bag, and using a melted stick of butter instead of oil to mix and spread the seasonings. I also placed a stick of butter inside the turkey, because why not. Super happy with how it turned out and our family loved it!!

Will have to tweak the recipe to my personal tastes, but it was good. Except for I do not use salt so I had nothing to replace it, but I am sure I can find something to sub for salt!

Made exactly as recipe stated. Did NOT put in a bag; just roaster with an aluminum foil tent. An 11-1/2 pound turkey was done about 45 minutes earlier than anticipated but stayed hot under the tent until remaining items ready. Legs and arms simply fell off the turkey when picked up to carve it! Adding a bit of paprika really did give the turkey a "fake tan" and looked beautiful. Herb seasonings placed under the skin was excellent. Turkey was very moist, even when sitting for nearly an hour before eating!

Moist, easy & tasty - best Roasted Turkey I have ever had, turned out perfectly. Turns out my turkey was about 20 pounds - marinade was plenty for the large bird.  Covered with foil for the first 3 hours then uncovered for the last hour to brown. BTW for any other first timers - be sure to check the backside of the bird for the packet of giblets :-(

So YUMMMY,
The best turkey I have  ever made. So juicy and  such good favor.  I did add real butter and  poultry seasonings to mixture and cut  back on basil. Cooked in a bag with chicken stock.. Wonderful, moist and  so easy for a perfect bird. Going to use this on my roasted  chicken as  well.

I have never made a turkey before in my life. Last night I cooked one for the first time for thanksgiving using this recipe and i without a doubt think this is the best turkey i have ever had in my life. It came out beautiful amd moist!! I couldnt find sage in the stores anywhere so i substituted rosemary and thyme. But just wow it was so good and beautiful.

Honestly love all those flavors together but instead of baking it I set it in my charcoal grill with hickory BBQ wood chips and cooked it that way!!! Let me tell you that all those flavors put together and having the wood chips smell to it AMAZING!! Absolutely loved this recipe and it was so simple

I made this very delicious turkey and it was a big hit. I followed directions with all the spice ingredients ( was a bit concerned about the amount of garlic powder) but it was so flavorful. I did substitute chicken broth for the water in my roasting pan and did baste every half hour as suggested and for the last 30 minutes , I took off the lid of my roasting pan to brown up the turkey .
Will definitely make this turkey recipe from now on.

This turned out amazing! It was my first turkey I've ever cooked. It turned out a bit dry but because my turkey was a bit bigger than my roaster so the lid didn't close fully but flavour wise it was delicious!! I did cook it breast side down as I read on a blog and it wasn't extremely dry as others I've tried before.

Wow.  A moist, deliciously flavourful, crispy-skin turkey recipe fit for a King.  Delicious.  I did place the oil under the skin and on the skin.  I did not however baste the turkey at all.  Instead I kept it tightly wrapped with foil then let it sit for 30 minutes before carving.  This is a keeper!

This was probably the worst of the 3 turkeys that I have now made in my life so far. The only thing I changed was using chicken broth instead of water for the pan, which I don't think I've even ever read about doing in all of the recipes that I've searched through. It didn't help though. The turkey tasted fine, but only like plain turkey, no flavor. After reading through some other reviews I might agree that using olive oil instead of melted butter is not the way to go as well.

made  in rice pan w grapeseed oil, skipped the brushing nonsense, used powdered herbs & lots of whole garlic  cloves stuffed into cavity w seeded lemon wedges & large celery stalks plus dill, thyme, small red potatoes quartered & a whole sweet onion in water based bottom. basted & turned over throughout cooking process. covered w loose alum foil. turned out super tasty, pretty & juicy as the devils playground.  a winner for my young kids, annoying spouse & friends alike plus loads of leftovers for kids lunches.
keep it simple & use whats on hand. did have to cook a bit longer, maybe 20 mins

I made this today for Christmas. It turned out very well and was very simple. Everyone enjoyed the flavor and the turkey was very moist.

I did add some items to the base recipe. I used everything listed, but added the following: diced half of granny smith, wedged half of yellow onion, two chunked up celery stalks, and a peeled orange separated. About a third of this I stuffed in the cavity and the rest was on top of the turkey. Also, I used a roaster instead of the oven. I find the roaster cooks the turkey faster and keeps it moister.

This turned out great for me. Used butter and the herb mixture under the skin and the olive oil and herb mixture to pour over the bird. Very juicy and flavorful. Better than any turkey I've made so far by far. Will make it again for sure.

This turkey is so good. Very moist and tender and flavorful.  Recreated just as written and it was a hit.  Made it a second time with a couple of additions. Added a full onion and garlic bulb coated with olive oil and basil and filled the cavity with those and lots of butter.  After the butter/basil mixture was placed under the skin, i put tooth picks in the skin around the point to keep the meat covered so it didn't burn.   After an hour in the oven,  I injected the breasts with a little more butter and chicken broth.... OMGosh so juicy!!   I wound up with four turkey's this year and I am so happy I found this recipe and now I have the birds to use it on.  Fantastic left overs for sandwiches as well.

I made a 24 lb turkey for Thanksgiving and the baste was enough for the whole bird. I was told that it was "the best turkey had in a long time."

Never doing this another way again. It fell off the bone. No onion chopping, no celery chopping, no stuffing, nothing. My previous "biggest fear," every year, just turned into the easiest meal I've ever cooked! Only change was that I omitted the water entirely. Betty Crocker said that it can "steam burn" your turkey, which naturally has enough water and juices to cook just fine. To be honest, I forgot to add the water! I looked it up afterward.  It. Was. Incredible!!!

Simple recipe, easy to follow resulting in the best turkey I've made to date.  I'll use this recipe going forward.  I mixed herbs with butter and put between the skin and meat as well as all over the skin.  Really good.

Even the pickiest of eaters loved this. I did use the low sodium chicken broth and added lemon and onion in the inside. We ate leftovers the next day and it was still so moist. Better than the Turkeys we got ordered for the holidays.

I made this with a large turkey I brined. I put whole apples and a peeled orange inside after rubbing the mix inside. I also added fresh pesto & garlic to the mix. HOW CAN ONE LOOSE, right! Turkey was roasted a bit too long & falling off the bones..... totally NOT dry!!!!! I'm saving this recipe as turkey is a favorite healthy & loved food for us.

Used this recipe for our first turkey and I love how easy it is,  but it just didn't do it for me. . I uncovered our turkey for the last hour to make it brown a little and that worked. . However the flavor isn't that amazing and our turkey came out a tad bit dry..

Made this with a twenty pound turkey without doubling the recipe. Forgot to adjust the time and had all the sides done within the 3 1/2 hour window. Lol turkey was moist and full of flavor. Bought the turkey last year and been freezing it since we were all sick with flu in 2014. Will definitely use again!

This was the very first time I've made a turkey and was extremely nervous and viewed a ton of recipes before choosing one.  I thought this one looked pretty simple.  I used a 23 lb turkey and followed the recipe exactly, except I used chicken broth in place of water.  I also followed the suggestion of someone else and sprinkled some paprika on top, to give it a nicer color.  This was honestly one of the best turkeys I've ever eaten.  Everyone raved about it at Thanksgiving.  Will definitely use again!

For a guy who rarely cooks, and a first time turkey maker, this was easy, pretty, moist and tasty! Used ingredients as written but put most under the skin. After all the herby mixture was applied both under the skin and out, used paprika as a "fake tan" as suggested in one of the reviews and that gave it a pretty look at the end.  Baked for 3.5 hrs covered with tin foil and uncovered for the last 10 and it came out good.

This is the best turkey recipe! So easy to make and my entire family kept commenting on how great it was and so moist! Thank you so much for this recipe, it was my 3 rd turkey i have ever made and my 2nd thanksgiving.  Because we had to eat at noon, i had to put the turkey in my 6:30am i cleaned and put the glaze on the night before and let it sit in the fridge overnight.  I added two pats of butter under the skin and two cups of water in the pan, added one onion quartered in the cavity with a few garlic cloves. I had a cover and about 1 hour before done i took the cover off go get the golden brown glow. Wonderful! My dad and mom who normally make the thanksgiving dinner was so impressed.  Thank you!!!!

This recipe is the perfect one for beginners and long time cooks.  I used it on my first turkey years ago and it was amazing.  After reading a few reviews, I began substituting chicken broth for the water with great results.

I have made the same turkey for Thanksgiving, and sometimes Christmas for the last 6 years. It is my most favorite recipe because the flavor comes out perfect and the turkey is moist! My mom is not a big fan of herbs so it might come off as overpowering for those who are not the biggest herb fans.  Other than that, we cannot complain about this easy and awesome recipe! Can't wait to cook it again next month! :)

I have made this recipe a few times and it's perfect. The meat is so tender it just falls off the bone! Makes carving easy! The taste is wonderful and the gravy you can make with the drippings is great too!

Thanksgiving 2013 was the first time I ever attempted to cook a turkey. I used this recipe, and the turkey came out great. There were no issues with the turkey being dry or under seasoned. This recipe took the fear out of the task. 
The directions don't mention this, but I would suggest that you start off cooking the turkey breast down first. I turned the turkey over during the last 30 minutes of cooking to brown. 
My family generally doesn't eat turkey for the holiday, but this recipe made it a family favorite.

Tried this one out for Thanksgiving this year. I actually let the mix sit overnight on the turkey and applied a refresher before baking it. Everyone loved it. The turkey came out juicy and with a great flavor. My dad was asking for it days later.

I have never been good at making turkey and my family isn't really a big fan of turkey usually.  This is hands down THE BEST turkey you will ever have.  And sooooooo easy.  I kept catching my husband going back in and snacking on it all day!  Definitely the only way I will cook turkey from now on!

I had never cooked a turkey in the oven before.  We usually smoke our turkey. Last Thanksgiving (2012), I found this recipe.  My fiance liked it so much that he insists that I cook the turkey all the time.  Super easy, wonderfully moist and it looks beautiful every time.

Used this recipe for our first turkey ever and I must say-- it was the best turkey I ever had. I mixed in three tbsp of butter per a previous reviewer and placed most of the mixture under the skin, the meat was so delicious and moist! We didn't use a turkey bag, as the recipe doesn't call for one, and I don't think one is needed. will definitely use this turkey again for other holidays.

I made this recipe for the first time this year and it was a huge hit. I'm not much on turkey but I can't stop eating what few leftovers I have. It was so moist and juicy and flavorful! It will definitely be my go to recipe from now on.

This is a great recipe that I use every Thanksgiving since discovering it in 2010.  I use a 21lb pre-brined turkey and modify the recipe to accomodate it.  Per other reviews, I also substitute unsalted butter for the olive oil and mix with double the recipe's seasoning mixture. The butter and seasoning mixture is rubbed between the skin and meat, so skin comes out slightly crispy (I love the skin!).  I cook at 400 degrees for about 30 min, then reduce to 335 degrees for the rest of the time.  Basting frequently and protecting the breasts with foil are very important.  I cannot stand turkey any other time of the year, but I love this one!!

Made a great turkey!
Was my first and I was very nervous about it, so I followed the recipe to the T (I did put the spices under the skin). I added some paprika on top of the "bird" for the color and turned my oven for 400F for a couple of minutes to "brown" it a bit.
It was very tasty. :)
Edit: this is now my "Go TO " recipe for Turkey. I made is for about 5 times. People tell me that it is the best turkey they ever had, and I am not American, so I kinda didn't expect much from my turkey. As an idea, to make it super moist, add lemon, carrots and onion inside of the turkey. When turkey is ready, discard the veggies. You won't regret it!

This was FANTASTIC. The turkey was incredibly tender, and ended up using stuffing as well which soaked up juices and really added to the overall dish. Thanks for this!!

This recipe is phenominal!  We had a turkey leftover from Thanksgiving, so we made it yesterday using this recipe and served it to guests.  Hubby told me to save the recipe and I am now on turkey duty for thanksgiving.  Everyone complimented it, and I got told, "This turkey is dangerous!"  So, so good.

It was good, but it seemed awfully involved and truly...the turkey ended up tasting like, well, turkey. It didn't seem a lot different than what I grew up on, but it did smell wonderful and the skin browned beautifully.

Turkey turned out perfect.  The taste was very good.  I thought it would be herb overwhelming but it wasn't at all.  Of course one thing I really know how to do is cook poultry so it stays moist.

I've never cooked a turkey before, but once I found this recipe I was willing to give it a try. My family loved it! With such a simple recipe one can begin to experiement with the different herb/spice combinations. I now recommend this recipe to anyone who wants to cook a turkey for the first time or just want a flavourful turkey.

I use this recipe with a brined turkey (soaked in salted water or use the recipe here with apple juice and garlic).  It was so juicy my husband said it didn't need gravy.

This turkey was perfect and moist. Baked upside down for the first 2 1/2 hours to let the juices run into the meat then turned over and removed the foil for the last hour to brown. Will definitely be making my next turkey like this.

This was my first turkey. I followed the recipe except I used 1/2 cup of olive oil and 1/4 cup of butter and used rosemary as well. IT came out moist and delicious!!!

I added more seasoning such as seasoning salt and rosemarry, butter, flour and it came out great. I did alot of touch and go with this recipe to make it my own, I don't remember everything I used. Good recipe for the basics, but requires your own flair.

Out of all the turkeys i made for thanksgiving....this is by far the moistest one. I have never had a turkey as juicy as this. I thought the flavor was excellent. I did use chicken stock on the bottom instead of water and i still put it in a turkey bag. The only thing that sucked was that the top portion of the turkey skin looked burnt....i dont know why but overall...the best turkey recipe so far!!!!

This was my first time doing a turkey and I was a lil nervous about me having the great idea of hosting Thanksgiving at my house. Everyone LOVED it, my friend was carving it and the bone she was holding came out!ha...which was a GREAT sign:). My hubby who is a vegetarian said to me "man, it looks and smells so good I might have some"! and he did and he loved it:) Anyway followed other ppls tip about the broth instead of water, put the mix under the skin also...I will use this again, they already volunteered me for next years turkey.

This is an awesome recipe.  This was my first year cooking the turkey and my mother-in-law, who always cooks the turkey every year raved up and down about the turkey.  She told me that it was the moistest turkey and it had the best flavor she's ever tried!  Everyone gave it 5 stars even my pickiest child loved it!  I baked the turkey with onions in the cavity instead of stuffing mix.  My turkey was 24-1/2 lbs so I doubled the recipe. Love this recipe thanks for sharing it!

We were running low on Olive Oil and had to use butter instead. We also put the mixture under the skin and on top and it turned out great! Wonderful flavor!

This was my first Thanksgiving to host and I was a bit nervous about the turkey getting too dry.  But this recipe plus a few other tips from other people made it easy.  I used butter instead of olive oil, and stuffed the inside of the turkey with onions, celery, and carrots.  It turned out moist and juicy!

Very tasty, came out moist and juicy and the house smelled SO good. I increased the measurements some for a 22 lb turkey and basted with more the last hour. I will be keeping this recipe for many more future Thanksgivings!

I REALLY like this! I did use a turkey bag to cook it is. It was a little dry, but that was my fault, I cooked it a bit longer than I needed to. The taste was perfect, I loved it! This was the first Thanksgiving I have cooked for and the first turkey, this is definitely going to be a family tradition!

Great flavor! Place the herb mixture under the skin. Addition of water is not necessary if brined overnight.

This was a great recipe for making a turkey for the first time. (Well 1st time for a full 21 lb. turkey, I have made a turkey breast before). Changes: Used celery salt in place of sage and since that had salt in it I didn't use any additional salt.  Used 1/4 cup softened butter and 1/2 cup olive oil. Cut a few slits in the skin and injected the olive oil/melted butter mixture using a baster.  I also used a bag to make it even moister. Using the bag also gave me lots of drippings for gravy and stock.  It was all terrific!  I got great reviews from our three sons and my hubby, who called my mom to tell her how good it was.  Thanks for a great and easy recipe.

This was my very first Turkey. I can not stress enough how easy it was for an inexperienced cook. I followed the recipe exactly and some of the reviews others had posted and it was perfect. I impressed both my mother and mother in law on Christmas Eve and that’s hard to do. I would recommend this one to every one.

I used this recipe to cook my first turkey and everything turned out perfectly!
I didn't have Basil available, so I used Summer Savory spice instead.
The turkey tasted amazing and was SOOOO moist!!
I will definitely use this recipe again and again!
Thanks!

1st turkey ever, and it came out perfect.  Very simple procedure for lots of flavor and a perfect turkey.  I doubled the spices but not the oil.  Also used a turkey bag.  It came out golden and moist.  AMAZING!!!

My best turkey yet!!! This turned out AWESOME! I had a 21 1/2 pound turkey, stuffed it, and used chicked broth in place of water in the pan. After about 7 hours of cooking, I took it out, let it rest an hour before starting to pick it apart. I barely needed a knife!! The meat just fell off the bones! And the carcass was totally falling apart as I was picking the meat off too. Move the turkey to a cutting board before cutting it?? Yeah right! Aside from the size of it and being too hot to just pick up with my hands, there's no way it would've moved intact! Soooooo good! Just made it last night, so I still need to make the gravy out of the drippings, but I don't expect that to disappoint either. Too bad I didn't have a houseful of people to impress with this one!

This was my first year ever cooking a turkey.  This recipe was great & my family & friends enjoyed it.  Next time, I may use a turkey bag to cook the turkey.

This is a wonderful turkey recipe and it was the first one I ever made.  Everyone loved it!  I made some changes and used a lot of butter in addition to the olive oil, and I used fresh herbs and fresh garlic.  I put the mixture under the skin and over the skin and basted often.  It was great!  We had to cut it ahead of time, but reheated it in the original juices and this really made it fabulous.  The flavors sunk in even more!

The best Thanksgiving turkey I've had in years.  it was so moist and flavorful.  We put some of the herb mixture under the skin.  We cooked it breast side up covered for half the time and breast side down uncovered for half the time.  Make sure you use a meat thermometer and it will not be overdone!

Used this recipe yesterday and got raves from the family and friends.  Prepared two 20 lb turkeys and they both came out perfect.  Delicious.  Glad I tried something different this year.

Everyone loved this recipe! My brother came for leftovers the next day and still raved about it. I didnt do the recipe as directed - we injected it with a buttery herb marinade and instead of doing the olive oil, i used a stick of butter under the breast and on the skin. It turned out wonderfully. It was enjoyed so much, we're now going to do this for our thanksgiving dinner to share with the rest of the family and guests!

Awesome! I used the recipe for Thanksgiving 07' & Xmas 07' and both times it came out wonderful! By the way, it was my first time EVER cooking a whole turkey. Very user-friendly recipe! Great tasting. Will use for all turkey holidays!

This is a decent turkey recipe. I roasted a 16 pound bird and it was done in a roasting pan after two hours, believe it or not. The store bought temperature sensor popped out when the my meat thermometer indicated 170 degrees. I let the turkey sit for 45 minutes, the longest I've ever let one sit and it was juicy and flavorful. Thanks for a very good recipe.

Very easy and tasty!  Made this in the electric roaster.  I didn't put any water in the bottom.  Brushed mixture (1/4 cup melted butter and 1/2 cup olive oil and spices) over the bird, and under whatever skin I could get up (man, that's tricky).   Poured the remainder inside the bird.  Cooked breast down, as normal.  Turned out juicier than normal, but the white meat was still a bit drier than I'd like it to be.

This turned out great and was very easy.  I cooked it upside down for more moisture in the breast. Covered with foil.  Then flipped over and took off the foil for the last 1/2 hour.  Not so pretty, but tasted great.

**Update, I used on chicken breast (with the bones and skin) and it is fantastic on that too~***I took the advice of other reviews and turned up the heat and took the top off for the last 30 minutes or so.  This turned out delicious and the juices made good gravy...yum, easy! To avoid DRY turkey~USE A THERMOMETER!  The reason some people have a dry turkey is because it is OVER COOKED~USE a THERMOMETER AND 160 DEGREES IS FINE. also, i placed the turkey on a rack inside the roasting pan so it wasnt swimming in the juices.

I've used this recipe for both oven baked and BBQ rotisserie turkey.  It is absolutely wonderful.  Making it again, now, for our family Christmas dinner!  Always gets rave reviews from everyone who tries it.  I start with a Citrus Brine (found on this site) and then stuff the turkey with lemon, orange and onion wedges plus a few cloves of garlic.  Perfection!  The only question is:  why don't I make turkey more often?

Followed this recipe pretty closely. I used butter in place of olive oil and chicken stock in place of water. Also added quartered onion and rough chopped celery and carrot to cavity and bottom of roaster. Had to double it as I had a 26 lb bird. Was easy and tasted great too!

The turkey took much longer than three and a half hours to cook.  I planned to cook the turkey with about an hour extra if needed, and that still wasn't enough.  Very dissapointing for Christmas dinner to cut into a raw turkey.  The parts that were done were very moist but like some other reviews said you couldn't taste the seasoning you put on unless you ate the skin.

So my turkey was dry dry dry, but my sister-in-law used this recipe twice with moist turkey results. So I'm convinced my turkey was just dehyrated before his head got chopped off. It smelled incredible in the oven.

Awesome recipe. It was my first Thanksgiving and well, the turkey came out perfectly. I followed the suggestion of adding a couple tablespoons of butter and also made double of the mix to keep the turkey nice and moist. Finally, I basted the turkey every half-hour (I don't know if this was necessary but I absolutely did not want a dry turkey). The only thing I will do differently next year is to put some of the "dressing" under the skin of the turkey. Oh, the stuffing in the turkey turned out great too- excellent flavor. Best turkey I ever had (better then my mom's and my grandparents). And, it was the first turkey my husband has ever liked...

This did not turn out well for me.  I had a 10 lb. turkey and followed the recipe exactly, except I uncovered the turkey for a about 3/4 to one hour to try and brown the skin.  The gravy was delicious -- but the turkey was not so good.

Thank-you so much for my very first turkey rub, it was delicious and made my bird look so good. I always stuck with my mothers plain roasted turkey but decided this year to try a rub and I will always use this now----forever! I did make it up a few days ahead and let it mingle flavors, it was very good.

Unbelievable!  I made this this past weekend.  I added butter for some of the oil as another reviewer had suggested and it turned out fabulous!  Even after we ran out of gravy everyone said "its so moist you don't need gravy".

This was my first time to prepare a turkey, so I was nervous.  Encouraged by the number of high reviews, this became my chosen recipe.  And a winner it was!  It was wonderfully fragrant and tender.  We LOVED it! I'll definitely be using it again!

This was only my second time making a turkey; my family has always used just butter, salt and pepper.  I used a Reynold's cooking bag, so didn't use the water.  But this turned out wonderful.  The drippings made an amazingly tasty gravy. **11/08 update: Used this again on a brined (Out of This World Turkey Brine on this site) bone-in turkey breast.  Used the cooking bag again, just removing it for browning during the last 45 minutes.  Wonderful!!  Perfect, moist, flavorful turkey.

Wonderful!  The meat was moist and flavorful.  It was quick and easy to prepare.  My 4 year old asked for thirds.  It was the first time I didn't want to eat my turkey with gravy or cranberry sauce.  I'll be using this recipe again.  Thanks for the post!

Pretty good, but not as good as I had hoped. The skin didn't get crisp in very many places the way I liked. Also, I brined the turkey before putting the oil/herb mixture on it. It was just enough and smelled very good. Just not quite there.

I used 1 cup olive oil, 1 stick of butter and doubled everything else.  It was more than I needed for a 23 pound turkey.  The turkey was really moist.

I was stuck cooking thanksgiving dinner this year and I gave it a try. Usually EASY meant losing a little taste, but that was not the case. The turkey was moist and great taste.  I highly recommend this recipe it you would like to make a statement next thanksgiving.

This recipe was excellent!  My husband and I loved it! We ended up substituting butter for the olive oil and rubbed it under the breast skin as well as all over the rest of the turkey.  The breast meat came out so moist and tender and the rest of the turkey was great too.  This rub made this the most delicious turkey we have ever made

Everyone LOVED the turkey. It was so tender and juicy. The flavors even seeped all the way into the meat found closets to the bones. Absolutely Awesome! We all really enjoyed our Thanksgiving due to this great recipe!

This one is a keeper! It looked so professionally made! :D

The only thing different I did was I put quite a bit of butter underneath the skin of the turkey. Then I put the herb mixture on over the turkey. I was a little bit worried about it coming out greasy but surprisingly it didn't at all. The turkey was nice and juicy and I didn't even use an oven bag, I normally have a problem with making the turkey too dry. Some reviewers mentioned that it wasn't flavorful enough but with the gravy I made from the turkey juices it came out great! Thank you so much Lisa for sharing this!

Ok maybe I missed something, but I don't think that this turned out as well as it was described. We all love garlic flavored items, and I thought that this would be really great, but it was alittle bland to me. I'll try it again, but next time I'll be adding a few of my own ingredients to give it alittle zing.

Excellent!!  My husband proclaimed it the best turkey he has ever eaten.  The only change I made was to use herbs de provence instead of basil/sage, since that's what i had on hand.  Thanks for the great, easy recipe.

My first turkey roast. The white meat was very delicious. Everyone loved the turkey. Said it was their best ever. TI used a roasting pan with a stand for the bird. The bottom did not cook (roast) fully enough. The next time I am going to consider turning the turkey over at the half-way point so that the bottom (or vic-versa) has a chance to roast, too.

Very Good. I only gave it 4 stars mostly because of me as I am a beginner at the whole cooking experience but got wonderful reviews from my 3 boys ranging in age from 18 to 9 and my fiance who said he was a litlle nervous about me using a recipe off this site. I have to add it was very simple and I will definately try it again.

I made this turkey for Thanksgiving, and it was wonderful!  I was able to adjust the recipe accordingly (I used a 16.5 lb turkey), and I brushed the outside with a bit of butter as well as the herbs.  It looked wonderful!  Yum!

I have never in my life made a whole bird or any sort, so needless to say I was quite scared to try this task. But the recipe turned out perfectly and the turkey was wonderful! I used a free-range turkey (hormone free!!!) and it was quite moist.

This was my first year to EVER make a turkey.  It turned out really well.  So well that my husband said he liked it more than the one is mom makes--and he was telling the truth!  Great flavor and the juices made excellent stock for gravy.

I used this recipe again this year for our Thanksgiving turkey.  It's really wonderful, but the only thing that gets flavorful is the skin, unless you inject the turkey.  I doubled the recipe sine we had a 24 lb bird and it turned out great!  I had a lot of rub left over, so I filled the cavity with it and added 2 sliced up lemons.  I also put 2 cans of chicken broth in the pan then covered with foil and baked for 6 hrs at 350 for the first 4 hours, then 325 for the last two, removing the foil with one hour remaining to get the bird a nice brown color.  This recipe is great if you tweak it a bit.  It sure makes your house smell great too!  I only gave ot 4 stars becayse I wanted the meat to have more flavor, but the skin was the only thing that the rub really flavored in this recipe.

This recipe made my first Thanksgiving dinner a breeze. I was so worried about the turkey not turning out. I got many good compliments. I used half olive oil and half margerine, cooked it in a Reynolds bag upside down at 350 degrees for 3hours and 15 minutes. Will use this recipe again.

I'd never made a turkey before-- I had always been intimidated.  I cut the olive oil to 1/2 cup and kneaded in some softened butter after rubbing the outside of the bird.  I put the buttery rub under the skin.  It smelled SO good.  Everyone was impressed.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was awesome!  I've done 3 other turkeys before (only for myself and boyfriend) but this year I did it for my mom's family and it turned out great!  I did half water and half chicken broth in roasting pan.  I added an apple,onion, and carrot cut in half in the turkey to add flavor (also more in the bottom of pan).  I will ALWAYS use this recipe from now on!

This is the second time I've used this recipe and it was delicious!  I found that if you loosen the skin and rub the mix inbetween the skin and flesh as well a couple clumps of butter, the meat retains the flavor better and is more juicy.

This recipe is a keeper.  Easy and tasty.  I made it as is, except I put a few pats of butter  under the skin of the breast.  Will make again.

After years of trying new recipes for roasted turkey I think I've found a keeper! The turkey was very moist and flavorful and I was able to make a wonderful gravy with the drippings. Thanks Lisa for a great recipe!

Rather than ham for Easter I thought I'd make a turkey breast. I used this recipe scaled down to serve 4. It was sooooo good. My husband asked my to never use anything else to make a turkey.

Chef's have nothing on this recipe!  My family went crazy when I served this gorgeous bird!  My Mother-in-Law even liked it!  This will be the only way I roast my turkeys from now on!  Thank you for this delight!
