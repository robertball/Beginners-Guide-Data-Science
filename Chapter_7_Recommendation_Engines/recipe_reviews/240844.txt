I absolutely love this recipe.
My fiance pointed it out to me earlier this year, and we just now got around to trying it. We did a smaller batch, as more of a tester/treat.

We followed the directions up until the end, where we used a light brushing of oil to coat the dish - rather than butter or parchment paper. We also let ours chill for three hours, to ensure a proper set. The end results were very pleasing, and I can happily say that we will be redoing this recipe many times over. Next time, we may even switch it up entirely!

Personal Summary: 
Level of Difficulty: Easy
Price range: $5 - $10
Time frame: 30 minutes - 1 hour

I made this for my extended family and it was very well received.  I thought the flavor was similar to cookies and cream ice cream.  Our only complaint is that these were dense and more difficult to cut into squares than we thought it would be.

Do not use wax paper! Other than that, this recipe is great. I lost a lot of mixture when I tried to press with wax paper. A spatula or clean hands work just fine!

These are soooo yummy and addicting!! Be sure to have a high marshmallow to cookie ratio, so that they stay soft and gooey. I make these each year for the holidays and leave some for all my coworkers on their desk. I use a label that says "Lump of Coal" and they always say at first they're upset that someone is calling them naughty- and then they try these. And rush over to my desk for the recipe and to find out if I brought in extra!

Very good.  Very easy.  I wanted to use up some chocolate sandwich cookies (NOT Oreos) and used the ingredient search and up popped this recipe.  I didn't have mini marshmallows but the regular size worked just as well. I sprayed the pan and had no problem getting them out.  I cut them before they were completely cold and had no problem there either.  I didn't expect much from this recipe but I was very pleasantly surprised with the results

Made it for a couple of years for my elementary class.  1. Take the cream out of the Oreos.  Cuts the sugar. 2. I add a little bit of vanilla.    3.  Agree, heavy on marshmallow mixture, cookies will soak it up and it ends up like a rock.  Scoop into mini muffin tin/with paper liner.  Right size for such a sweet treat.  4.  Sprinkle with silver sugar to add a nice effect.

I did not press into a pan and cut into squares.  I took spoons full and pressed it by hand into pieces of natural looking coal and placed in mini baggies with a tag that said, "Santa knows you've been naughty", and passed them out at my husband's job.  They loved them.

I used the quantities in the recipe. I rolled the cookies in a zip lock bag and crushed them. Put the filling on a paper plate to the side first lol. Poured the filling in then the cookies and used buttered hands to make little imperfect balls. Perfect!!!

I followed the directions it turned out great. To press in pan I used spray butter on my hands and had no issues. We had a gag gift exchange at our family Christmas and this is what I took.

These are a huge hit every year. Everyone looks forward to getting coal in their stocking . I do recommend making them into bit sized portions, as it can be a bit rich.

I made this once without changes with excellent results.  I want to make this again but this time forming the mixture into lumps or balls to resemble real lumps of coal.  Has anyone done this?  Does the mixture set too quickly to do this?

Update: I put a piece in the microwave for 15 seconds.  OMG...tasty.  I may try this when forming the mixture into lumps.

These are really good. I only gave them 4 stars because they are really just jazzed up Oreos. But they are delicious.
