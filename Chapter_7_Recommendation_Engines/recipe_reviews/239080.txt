We enjoyed cauliflower prepared this way.  The chopped egg reminds me of how vegetables are served in Scandinavian countries.  It took far more than 10 minutes for my cauliflower to get tender, closer to 20 but the rest of the recipe worked perfectly.  Thanks for sharing!

The sauce would be even more delicious if it was a little thicker and coated the cauliflower....will add a bit of rue to it next time.
