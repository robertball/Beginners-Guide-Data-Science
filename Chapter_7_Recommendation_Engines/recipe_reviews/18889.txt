Really good.  I didn't have any Vidalia onions, so just used a regular white onion.  Still very good.  I also added chopped garlic rather than garlic salt and added a little extra salt.  I will make again for sure.  the vinegar adds a really nice slightly sweet touch to the dish.

Delicious!  I cut the oil to 1 1/2 T.  I added to the balsamic vinegar; an additional 1/2 T.
Simple to prepare.  Will make again.

This is a really nice, easy-to-put-together recipe. I used fingerling potatoes instead of the red potatoes called for, and just pricked them instead of slicing. I also used a tablespoon of fresh rosemary instead of the dried, because I had it on hand and I like to use fresh herbs whenever possible. I'm not a big fan of balsamic vinegar, so I used regular white vinegar instead. I'm not so sure I liked the taste of the vinegar in here...I would probably skip it next time I make this. But of course, that's a personal preference, since I don't like the taste of balsamic vinegar. I also found that it took longer to bake than the 40 minutes specified in the recipe. Other than that, this is a great recipe, and I will probably make it again. Thanks for sharing1

Sorry. There was just something about these potatoes that we didn't enjoy.  "Too much of this and not enough of that" kinda thing. I'm still looking for the perfect herb potatoes that will accompany my grilled salmon recipe and this just didn't fit the bill. Thanks anyways Donna.

I like this.  Be sure to cut the potatoes small enough.  I didn't, and it took forever to cook through.  Next time I will cut them smaller.  I also put in 1/2 lb of mushrooms I had on hand.  Really good.  Maybe a little more salt....

I didn't have any carrots onhand, so I made this without.  A pretty good side dish.

I was disappointed with this recipe.  It was pretty bland.  The OVEN ROASTED POTATOES by Janet are worlds better.

These were really good!  I liked the carrots better than the potatoes though. They tasted kind of sweet.  Left out the onions this time. I'll make these again, maybe I will try and use just carrots next time and see what it tastes like.

The sauce wasn't my favorite.  I probably won't make it again.

Great!  Made this without the carrots. My 4 year old thought it was yummy.  Might try oregano instead of rosemary next time.  Tasted like my husband's homefries but they require constant watching.

This is, hands down, my favorite potato side dish - ever. Be sure to get a good quality balsamic vinegar, because the sweetness absorbs right into the carrots and onions, and adds extra flavor to the potatoes. It's also excellent reheated, so be sure to save any leftovers if you're so lucky to have them.

Pretty good although my roommate didn't really care for them. I took the oven route and only used 1/2tsp rosemary and 1/2tsp oregano. Because I was cooking them at 350 with my chicken, they took an hour to cook, which was okay with me.  However, I liked them better when I mixed them in with "Sesame Broccoli" I made, also found on this site. Even though they were enjoyed, there are other potato recipes I prefer over this so I'm not sure if I'll make again or not.  Thanks just the same Donna.
