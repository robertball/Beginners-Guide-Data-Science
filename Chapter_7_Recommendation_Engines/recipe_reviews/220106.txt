I am the author of this recipe.  Sheesh I submitted it years ago....anyhow.  I've fixed it so it works and added a pic as to how it should look.  As for the cheese, use HALF.  (4oz cream cheese, 1/3 cup sugar).  Just sprinkle the pecans on each.  I didn't even use all the topping I had about 1-2 T of it leftover.  I also baked mine for 30 min.  I let them cool in the pan for 10 min before removing.  I hope this helps.  Sorry about the incorrect amounts!

I followed the recipe exactly. They were so awful! Could not get them out of the pan, they ran over into the bottom of my oven, another mess I had to clean up.  They required way too many bowls the untensils.

These didn't work out for me at all.  Way to much cheese, the strawberry jam and even the nuts on top all sank to the bottom. Fell apart when i tried to take them out of pan after cooling.

BI followed the new recipe with only 4pz cream cheese and it still made a big mess in the bottom of the oven. Tasted great though.

These muffins were delicious! I made the recipe as written and they came out perfect. I had enough batter and cream cheese mix to make a dozen. The recipe is a bit complicated but worth it if you know what you're doing. I will be making these again, they were a big hit in my house!

Nothing like the picture. Crumb top melts to goo. There were too many steps for it to be worrh it.

These muffins were so yummy!  I did exactly as the recipe called and the jelly and cheese fell to the bottom of the muffin and the top part crumbled so it was a big mess. (But a delcious mess!)  Will try the authors suggestion to reduce the cheese next time!
