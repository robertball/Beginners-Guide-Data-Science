Hello everyone, I am the submitter of this recipe. I just wanted to make a little note, depending on how fresh your plums are is what determines the amount of sugar you need. As they ripen more they tend to lose some of their sweetness, therefore needing more sugar. I live in a small part of Alaska & we tend to get fruit that is near the end of its shelf life. For fresh plums I would suggest adding only 6- 6 1/2 cups of sugar. Thanks & enjoy!

****PLEASE READ: I have made this twice now and both times it did not set.  I think my mistake was not getting it get to a rolling boil and keeping it there long enough.  Like candy this step is vital for it to turn out!  I also upped the boxes of pectin to 2.   ~ I decreased my sugar by about a cup and added a squeeze of lemon in the mix.  I also like  to add 2 cinnamon sticks while it simmers for a bit of spice,.    The hardest work for me was de-pitting the tiny Japanese plums from our trees but my son helps.   We absolutley love love love this jelly (thinner than a jam)  The flavor is spicy-sweet & tart, at least with my plums and added ingredients.  My son tells me not to give so much away so we can have more! lol.. This is now going to be a tradition to make every summer. :)

Good starter recipe. By adding an extra 1/2 cup of plums to recipe and cutting 1/2 cup of sugar you can increase the recipe to 12 half pint jars without losing any of the sweetness. I also used 2.35 ounces of pectin instead of the recommended 1.75 ounce. This thickened up the jam more. Also, to decrease foaming add 1 tablespoon of Lemon juice concentrate along with the butter. The Lemon Juice also helps remove air. Thank you for the inspiration DelightfulDines.

From reading this recipe, I think the reason people are having set problems is because, according to the folks at the Sure-Jel number, powdered pectin has to go in BEFORE the sugar,  or you will get a set fail.

THIS IS A GREAT JAM. IT IS EASY TO MAKE AND TASTE GREAT. I PUT THE PLUMS IN MY FOOD PROCESSOR AND CHOPPED THEM, THEN BOILED AND ADDED 2 BOX'S OF PECTIN.

Loved it! First attempt at canning. Easy and delicious! Changed two things. Went with less sugar. 6 cups was plenty for us. Also, after cooking the plums we put them thru a strainer and removed the skins. We call it....jamelly!!!  Yum!

Loved it, Came out well... I reduced the sugar to 6 cups. I didn't have issues with it setting; but I made sure to get it at the jelling point of 220.

This is lovely Jam....However I wish I had follwed the advice of other reviewers and cut back on the sugar. It is very sweet. I did use two boxes of pectin and didn't have any problem with setting.Thanks for the recipe!

Small batch - I made just 2 jars-worth... and instead of pectin i used cornstarch.. about a tablespoon per jar. I also added the pinch of lemon and a teaspoon of lemon zest. looks and tastes good. a little cloudier, but the color is still good.

Excellent recipe!  I, too, had extremely sour plums (though perfectly ripe).... end of shelf-life, presumably.  I ran a cup short of plums, so I added enough chopped apple to make the full 4.5 cups. Also added a smidgen more water to the pot, and a tsp. of cinnamon for good measure.  Lovely colour, and jelled well.  Would definitely make this recipe again, with plums only, when they come on sale again.

Great directions and delicious. I used the food processor to chop the plums and they were quite liquid so I didn't add any water. My plums must have been really good, because I cut the sugar down to 3 cups and it was perfect.

I made this a few days ago.  I read a bunch of the reviews and adjusted the sugar accordingly.   I used 10 cups of plums, 5 1/2 cups of sugar 3.25 oz of pectin, a splash of lemon juice, 1/2 tsp of butter, and about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. The jam came out perfect!!!  This was my first attempt making jam.  I plan on another batch this week!  Excellent recipe.

This recipe was a GREAT hit!!  I made 48 half pint jars.  I did increase my plums to 9 cups and decreased the sugar to 6 cups. I added my sugar, butter, and pectin, let it come to a rolling boil (with 220 degree temp) for a few min.  Set up wonderful.  My family and friends LOVED it.  Thank you!!

Yummy, Yummy, Yummy.  I recommend 1 1/2 packages pectin for more of a jam thickness.  The recipe made almost 6 jars....not 8.

I used fresh Late Italian Prune plums. Used the 6.5 cups of sugar recommended. The flavor is intense, tart and sweet and the set is perfect. Thank you.

This is close to a recipe that I use. I use equal parts plum to sugar. I use a tablespoon lemon, but no butter. After cooking, before the pectin and sugar, I run it through my Vitamix. The skins are so small you can't tell they are there! But they add mega flavor.

worked really well for me, I used 6.5 cups of sugar and my own sterilizing/canning method. I used 3.5 cups of  almost ripe plum and 1 cup of blackberries, tastes great! I didn't add any water but mashed my fruits as I always do and pulled out some of the peels. Made 8 jars.

This has become my 'go to' recipe for plum jam!  I increase the amount of plums by about a cup and decrease the sugar to 6 cups, but it has always turned out beautifully and is my family's favorite jam.

OK, if you light your jam runny. For thicker consistency, reverse the timing of Pectin and sugar. Pectin should go in first. I made it both ways and the Pectin first method was much better. I used 7 cups of sugar for 5 cups of plums. Pretty sweet, probably could have used 1/2 cup less.

Love this recipe! Thanks for sharing!
We tend an apple and plum orchard in NW Idaho and have yellow plums....so that's what we used! Those plus 6 cups of sugar and a dash of pure almond extract! DELICIOUS!

Didn't set for me.  Also, I cut back the sugar to 6 cups (possibly why it didn't set correctly) but it is WAY too sweet.  I don't know if it's because I used half purple plums, half yellow plums?  If I ever make plum jam again though, I'll look for the low sugar/no sugar pectin instead.

Also had trouble with it not setting.  Read the reviews and last two batches added the pectin before the sugar, one with the fruit at the start, the other after the 5 min. boil.  Both set up fine!

I altered the quantities a bit to try and use a full 12- 8oz jar package.  6 3/4 cups of chopped italian prunes. Whole bag of sugar, about 9 cups according to package.  3 packages of Sur-Jell pectin. Cinnamon was nice as other people have mentioned!
Turned out 10.5 jars worth. Expected, since I used a little less sugar than the recipe called for. Still very sweet!

I have never changed a jam recipe until I read these reviews.  I used both Italian and Santa Rosa plums combined 
to make 5-1/2 cups chopped, mixed with 1-1/2 packages Sure Jell.  I added 1/2 cup water, tsp butter and tbsp lemon juice and cooked to rolling boil, then added  6 cups sugar. I have a laser temp gun and tried to boil till hit 220 degrees as reviews suggested, but gave up after it hit 200 degrees.  Was fairly thin, but after water bath and cooling it set perfectly.  Hubby loves it. Had bisquits with the jam this morning.

I have followed this recipe twice, just to see if it was something I did. ....... it isn't.  This is more like a plum sauce, than a jam. Too much water.

I used yellow plums.  It turned out so pretty!  The taste is great.  I wish it turned out a little thicker.  I LOVE it on toast with butter.

Great base recipe. I added 1 tsp ginger and 1 tsp ground cloves for a little spice. I also cut the sugar and will cut further at my next try. Set up well as long as you bring it back to a full boil after adding pectin for 1 full minute.

Perfect as is, in my opinion.  I read some reviews about using less sugar so I did that on my first batch.  It was too tart!  The second batch I followed recipe exactly and absolutely love it.  Thank you for a great recipe!

So I made this last night and given the fact that this was my first attempt at canning, I basically followed to the letter. I did only use 6 cups of sugar. Seemed sweet enough. But I added my pectin first and then sugar as some of the reviews mentioned trouble with setting. I did, against my better judgement, use only the 1 box of pectin as it states and my jam is almost more of a syrup than a set jam. So I would definitely tweak this to use more pectin.  The consensus seems to be 2 boxes. So I'm trying it again with 2 boxes and will have to figure out a use for my 8 jars of syrup. ;) I did add a smidge of cinnamon and it really was delicious!!!

Very easy recipe to make although mine was more of a jelly than a jam.  I didn't let it sit at the rolling boil for long enough I think, but it came out tasting great!  Will definitely make this again!

First time canning. It was a bit more complicated to make. I used less sugar. I made sure the temp of the hot liquid jam was 220. Only 2/3 of my jars sealed. But all in all tasted great!

I cut this recipe in half and used less than half of the sugar.  I also doubled the pectin.  Not only did it not set but it was way too sweet.

I cut back on the sugar by 2 cups because 7 cups seemed a bit much. It still turned out a bit sweet.
My husband doesn’t think so. He loved it. Will use this recipe again

I let the plums sit in the sugar for about 4 hours til they were nice and juicy.  placed in pot (without adding any water)  with lemon juice and boiled a few minutes and then crushed the fruit.  Then added the pectin and boiled vigorously for 1 minute.  turned out great.

Tastes great, but I agree with the reviewer that said you must add the pectin first and then the sugar. It’s been awhile since I’ve made this recipe and I even made a note of it then and it didn’t register this time until I was done. The submitter needs to change the directions because you will be disappointed every time if the order is not followed properly.

I used the tips  and used 6 1/2 cups of  sugar and also put the  sure jell powder pectin in before  the sugar. It turned out great. I made two batches and one I just mashed the plums after cooking in water and the other I chopped plums in processor before cooking. They both turned out good.

I am glad I read a lot of the comments by others! I made this for the first time and my jam turned out perfectly. I took the advice of others and reduced the sugar to 6 cups. I used 2 packages of fruit pectin rather than one and I made sure when I boiled my jam it got to 220 degrees. I added one box of pectin before the sugar and the second after the sugar. I also followed the instructions on the box for boiling. I boiled my jam for a full 3 minutes, rather than one minute and then boiling it again once in the jars. My jam set up perfectly and tastes perfect! I think I had a little more than 4 cups of plums and my jam made 9 1/2 pint jars with a little extra.

First time making plum jam. I started with four pounds of plums. Forgot to check the directions and did not chop the plums. Tried to cut back on the sugar. Didn't work for me. I could not get my jam to set, I let it sit covered overnight.  Still not set so I added the sugar called for in the recipe. Still it did not set although I had set it high, adding another package of pectin and making sure I let it reach 220 made a HUGE difference!!! Thank goodness as we love the flavor and will try it again by "following the directions" ;D and adding an additional package of pectin. Thanks for the recipe.

This was a big hit with my family.  I processed the fruit and most of the peels in my Vitamix before heating.  I added 1 whole cinnamon stick during the initial 5 minutes of heat and then removed it.  I added 1 1/2 packs of pectin before 5 3/4 cups of sugar.  It turned out fabulous.  It's a great combination of sweet and tart.

I used a mixture of yellow & blue plums; 3 lbs each.  I'm in Canada so my box of Certo crystals is 56 g which is 2 ounces a bit more than the 1.75 ounce specified. It's not specified in the recipe but based on the method given the pectin you should be using is just plain ordinary crystals not sure jell, perhaps the writer can clarify? I followed this recipe exactly except that in the second boiling after I had added the plain ordinary pectin crystals, I boiled the jam until it reached 221°. That took about four minutes. My set is perfect. In my jam the sugar quantity specified was perfect. My only complaint is I don't care for the blue plum skin floating around in the jam, next time I'll strain the liquid before I add the pectin. I think this is a fairly easy recipe that gave me a lovely tasty jam, thank you.

This jam tastes wonderful it didn't set up as well as I would have liked next time I'll add another pack of pectin and I took the semi cooked plums and ran it threw a food mill to take out the skins as I don't like skins in my jam. I will totally make this again

Top notch!  I make a lot of jam -I had thought I was done for at least a while, and my aunt dropped off a big box of plums!  So plum jam was made, and it is delicious.  Thanks, I will make this again. One note!  I did follow the advice on the powdered pectin package (Bernardin) and added the pectin before the sugar.  In case that is helpful.  It set beautifully.

I made two batches. However I made one following the posted recipe adding extra pectin and cinnamon sticks. The second batch I substituted the sugar with honey. 7 cups of honey and cinnamon sticks. Both were excellent.

This recipe didn't set. The suggestions to add the pectin prior to sugar is not what SureJell specifies. I followed the  SureJell recipe to boil the pectin separately and then add it to the plum and sugar mix. This worked great. Also I tested a tablespoon of jam by putting it in the refrigerator before canning to make sure I didn't can another batch of plum sauce.  Next time I'll follow the SureJell recipe.

Delicious! But I followed the suggestion of another person (and on the pectin Sure-Jell recipe) and mixed the pectin in before I dissolved the sugar.

I ran out of sugar so I did 2 Cups of sugar,  5 T of honey and 1.18 oz of pectin and it turned out great! (I didn't use the butter) I had to boil it for about 4-5 mins instead of 1 minute after I added the pectin as it was still runny at first. It thickened up very nicely as it set. I also ran the mixture through a food mill to get rid of the skins before putting it in the jars. 

A slight tang but still a hint of sweetness. My husband and kids love it! (I quadrupled the recipe using the measurements I listed above  and it made 20 - 8oz jars.)

Amazing! Turned out fantastic! Per the other reviews I put in the pectin before the sugar and only used 6 cups of sugar. So good.

Followed recipe accordingly, turned out delicious. I yielded 11 jelly jars, but probably had a few more plums then what recipe called for. I had no problems with jam setting, just a reminder, jams are a thinner consistancy than jellies, so it will not be a thick end result.

Definitely making this again. I forgot how much I love plum jam! It was my first time to make plum jam and it turned out GREAT!!! I put the pectin in before the sugar AND 7 1/2 cups of sugar seemed like way too much for me so I added 4 cups instead and it was perfectly sweet enough for me! As for the pectin, I used 6 tablespoons of the Ball brand classic  powdered pectin and a tbsp of lemon juice. UPDATE! I want to mention that I used 3 lbs of plums, which turned out to be 8 cups, instead of the 4 and a half cups this recipe calls for for the simple fact that I got 2 different recipes mixed up and didn't realize it until last night when a friend of mine and I made some for her. Regaurdless....it turned out great both times!

I think the recipe calls for too much sugar.  I quadrupled the recipe and only added 12 cups.  And at that it's almost too sweet.  It's good though.  Nice texture.

This was my first ever attempt at jam and it turned out amazing!  Our new home has 2 mature plum trees and I hated to see them go to waste as we couldn't eat them fast enough.

Wow, this is delicious jam. I made several double batches with some Italian plumbs picked from a neighbor's tree. I used two boxes of pectin per recipe and only 3 cups of sugar per recipe. We like our jam tart & our plumbs must've been sweet coming right off the tree. I added a squeeze of fresh lemon to reduce foaming. I also made a batch of syrup by following the recipe exactly the same but using only 1 box of pectin per recipe.  Thank you!

tried this recipe and it set okay b/c I had the mixture at a rolling boil longer than the original recipe calls for, as some reviews advised. but then the flavour fell flat. I am going to try it again and see if I can find that fine line....

As a beginner in canning this was the most easiest recipe to follow. It also turned out absolutely fantastic! I have to admit I added extra pectin to make set for me. First batch made syrup but will not be wasted in this household!

Overall I liked this recipe, the method was a good one.  I tried this yesterday with wild plums.  My plums weren't that sweet but before adding the sugar I researched other recipes and did back off on the sugar.  I added 1/2 teas allspice and the recipe turned out well, although slightly loose.  I'm doing another batch tonight and putting in about 1 cup sugar per 1 cup fruit.  Will add 2 packages pectin instead of one.

So good!  This is the first time I've made and canned plum jam.  I made this exactly as the recipe is written except I used pint jars.  It turned out perfect!
