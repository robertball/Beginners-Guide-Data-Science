WOW!!! This has become a favorite of family and friends.  The BEST salmon recipe ever! The combination of spices is incredible.  And, please, do serve it on the greens with the vinaigrette.....it makes the meal!

Great recipe that takes little time to prepare.  I have used it for guests twice now, and even the pickiest eaters love it.

The spice on this was great!  I cooked this on my George Foreman for about 4 minutes and it turned out really well.

I made the salmon (minus the greens and vinaigrette) and my family proclaimed "this is one of the best dinners you've ever made".  There was not a smidge of salmon leftover...every morsel was eaten.

This salmon recipe is quite delicious.  I have served this dish at two BBQ's and everyone has absolutely loved it.  The combination of spices in the rub provide a nice kick to the salmon without overpowering the taste of the salmon.

The rub is very good.  I'd skip the spice mix and most of the tomato-veg juice in the salad dressing.  Just the oil and balsamic vinegar work just fine. The rub is a great salmon recipe whether on the greens or not.

The rub on salmon and chicken was very good. The dressing,however was kinda a bust. Tasted like V8 juice and needed allot of help if you asked me.

I helped a friend make this dish.  At first I was very skeptical.  The dressing along was not all that great, but then you put it all together and it was fantastic.  Instead of using the grill, my friend broiled the fillets for about 6-8 minutes.

Everyone I have made this for has raved about it.  The rub is so flavorful it makes the whole salad.  It is also good on chicken. I like to use Spicy V8 to add a little zip.

I have used this several times. I used the BBQ mixture on the salmon and cook in the oven. Everyone loves it and it is SUPER easy! Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this for a dinner party for 8 and everybody really raved about it.    The rub was very flavorful and really soaked into the fish.  The salad is a beautiful way to present the fish.  I did not spoon any remaining vinnaigrette over the salmon at the end, because the salmon tasted very good to me without it.

Just used this for the dressing portion, though I changed the spices a bit. Very good!

Delicious recipe! I added corn, tomatoes, cucumber and avocado to the spring greens which added a nice, fresh flavor. I used an organic spicy veggie cocktail from Whole Foods which may have made the difference from some previous reviewers, the vinaigrette was a delicious touch to the recipe, definitely wouldn't omit it. Great recipe! Thanks!

The salmon was great.  I loved the dry spice mix and will definitely use it again for salmon.  The dressing, on the other hand, was a little strange, but as other reviewers have noted, it DID work well with the salmon.  I added some thawed frozen corn and a few thinly sliced carrots to the salad mix and topped it with toasted pumpkin seeds.  It was good.  (TIP:  I had a LOT of dressing leftover,  and was not sure what to do with it, because it really did not taste very good as salad dressing without the salmon.  Today, I decided to use it to marinate some boneless, skinless chicken breasts which we grilled for supper.  The dressing did not impart much flavor, but the chicken was VERY moist and juicy.)

The combo of spices is now my go to rub for everything. I did use a little more vinegar and only 1 C. of the tomato juice, is the dressing good for just a salad, not really, but great when you top the fish with it and it's all put together. I topped it all with some sliced red onion and feta too. Yum! A keeper, Thanks!
