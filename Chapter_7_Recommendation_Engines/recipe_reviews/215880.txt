So easy and so delicious! Plus it's a great way to beat the summer heat on nights when it's just too hot to grill. I would definitely brown the sausage first to avoid a bunch of grease in the crock pot. I also sauteed a green and red pepper along with a vidalia onion in a bit of olive oil and a bit of garlic just until tender crisp. I had some "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" frozen in a small container so I thawed that and added it vs. using Classico Sauce. I cooked it for 6 hours on low and added the veggies the last hour so they didn't get mushy. When it was done I served it on crusty Italian rolls topped with shredded Parmesan and Romano cheeses - YUM!

Easy work night meal.  I take the casings off of the sausage, use a frozen mix of yellow, red & green peppers, sliced onion and marinara sauce (whatever is on sale).  I let it cook all day. Can serve on sub rolls or over top of rice/noodles.

This was great, my family enjoyed them. I warmed the hoagie rolls before serving and topped with Mozzerlla cheese, in which I put into the oven to melt the cheese. I will definently sever this again

Sounds good! Could also do on stove, shorter cooking time.
