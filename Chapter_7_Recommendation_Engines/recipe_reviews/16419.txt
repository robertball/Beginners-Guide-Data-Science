Though the taste combination of this sauce is delicious and punguent, it turned out far too watery to be a dipping sauce or to use for spreading on crackers!  Adding enough mustard to make it thicker, like the recipe suggests, would have made the mustard flavor far too strong.  As a marinade, it would be perfect the way it is.  To make it thick enough to be a dipping sauce, I added about 1/2 tsp of cornstarch and heated it on the burner for a few minutes while stirring.  That did the trick and made it just the right consistency.

After reading this recipe I didn't follow it. Instead, I used: 2 tbsp dijon mustard 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar 3 tbsp miracle whip 1 tsp brown sugar  It turned out lovely and was perfect with cocktail weiners.

This provides an excellent base for a versatile sauce. I omitted the sugar and salt, threw in a tablespoon or so of butter, and came out with a great tangy sauce to drizzle over anything--veggies, meat, bread, whatever. I actually used to liven up an otherwise straightforward spinach-stuffed crepes dish.

Made this as a sauce to go with pork tenderloin.  The sauce was terrible. It hurt my throat to taste it.  I tried to save it, added corn starch to thicken, added chicken broth to soften the blow - but I was not successful.

Left out the sugar and added fresh rosemary and oregano.  It is truely a great dipping sauce. I think next time I will emulsify a little olive oil to help thicken it up. Using it as a marinade on pork ribs as we speak. Reminds me of pork pinchitos we bought from vendors on the street in Spain!

Pretty good as a french fry dipping sauce. Even better as a steak marinade. Most recently, used as a marinade for pork chops that my husband did out on the grill. It was a flavor match that was WONDERFUL. My husband, who normally doesn't like pork, ate almost every bite and suggested that I make pork like that every time. I would highly suggest this as a marinade for steak and other meats...would not use it as a dipping sauce or on crackers though.

Used for dipping red peppers, loved the sweetness of the peppers with the dip! Think I will try as a salad dressing as well. It was great! Thanks!

I liked the flavor of this dip but doubt that those who don't love vinegar would agree because the flavor was quite strong.  I added some heaping spoonsful of mayo but even then I found it WAY too thin to use as a spread and it's not a very appealing visual presentation. I also added honey to take away some of the sharpness. Perhaps using this as a honey-mustard salad dressing would be a better idea.

Use this as a marinade! I omitted the sugar (I have the opposite of a sweet tooth), added a Tb of butter, and used it to soak some boneless pork ribs. It was delicious.

I agree with others this would be a GREAT marinade, but I found it too strong a flavor for dipping veggies. I used it for artichokes (wanting a healthier alternative to butter) but it was way too strong.

This has fabulous flavor! It is a little thin for a spread - but works for dipping veggies or as a salad dressing. This is great - Thanks!

This sounded interesting, and as I like "different" flavored dips was excited to make this.  However, the 1/4 cup of balsamic is maybe 5 times too much.   This is way too watery and the flavors do not work well together.

I tried this recipe because it looked low fat. I didn't add the water because I didn't want it too watery, but it made the balsamic a bit too strong, so I added 1T of olive oil because I'm not a huge fan of mayo, and it softened the flavor quite nicely.
