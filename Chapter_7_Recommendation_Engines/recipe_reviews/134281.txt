This stew was so good; however I think that if it was served with rice it would taste even better. If you don't like spicy food, then you may want to cut back on the red pepper flakes.

What a treat.. Im a new cook but knew enough to use Chicken Broth instead of water. I also added Cayenne Pepper along with the Flakes and used Polish Kielbasa instead of the sausage in the recipe. This is an amazing dish full of flavor (dont know how other reviewers didnt get the kick.. maybe it was my Cayenne pepper addition) For me it was spicy and the vegetables were nice and firm and not soggy. Cant wait for the leftovers!

This was pretty good stew.  I used 1.5 onions instead of 3.   I only had ground chorizo, so I cooked it first and added with the chicken.  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs which seemed to get lost. Notes for next time - double the chorizo and chicken and more carrots.  Serve with crusty bread to absorb the juice.  Yummy!

I have made this dish 5 times and i love it. I tweaked it a bit like most people do but tried to stay true to the recipe. I put in more carrots & potatos, i also add 1 sweet potato, I use 5-6 cloves of garlic and double the amount of red pepper flakes and paprika. I also use chicken breast instead of thighs and i dont put it in the oven (dosent thicken much). With those changes this is a fall/winter FAVORITE!!

Loved this recipe!  It is different from anything that I usually make.  I am always trying to find new recipes to try.  I could not find spanish chorizo at my supermarket so I bought a spicy Andouille sausage, it worked out great!

Apart from using Andouille sausage (I wasn't paying attention when I took the package out of the freezer), I pretty much made this as written. It turned out way better than I expected! Husband picked out the potato, but he isn't a spud fan anyway. I wasn't too sure about the carrot, but it worked really well. I served it with some buttermilk biscuits to soak up the sauce. Good stuff. Thanks!

This was a nice, hearty stew.  I used chicken broth instead of water and added a little chili powder and cumin for an extra kick.

It was an ok dish, but it was missing the essence of what would make it worthy to be called SPANISH stewed chicken.  The flavors were not there.  It was not worth the work.  Next time I will save myself the time and just make baked chicken.

The flavours were nice. I used water as per the recipe and not broth or stock as some reviewers have suggested, and the flavours were vibrant and fresh. I did not find it as labor-intensive as one reviewer, perhaps because I didn't bother removing the casing from the chorizo and I left everything in the same (oven-proof) pan, so there was no need to take out the chicken or dirty another dish. I'm giving only 3 stars because although it was good, it wasn't mind-blowing, and frankly, we just found it kind of a pain to eat. You really need a fork, knife, and spoon to manage it. Oh--it would be helpful if the recipe stated whether or not to drain the chickpeas (garbanzos). I sort of drained them, but left some liquid in.

This recipe was really good except the gravy was thin. After reading the reviews, I too altered the recipe using 1 onion instead of 3, chicken broth instead of water and for extra zip, I used Rotelle instead of plum tomoatoes. I also served this dish with white rice, yummy!!!

We had this over rice.  It was very flavorful and one of the top dishes I've made from this site.  Unfortunately, it wasn't as spicy as I expected.  Actually, it wasn't spicy at all.. ( i love spicy)  I even added extra red pepper..  I will try again and adjust the spices.

I really liked the base idea of this recipe but I definitely made some modifications I knew would bring the flavor out big time. First off I used only 2 onions, one red and one white and I chopped them finer than 1 inch cubes (that may just be personal preference though, I don't like big chunks of onion). I also included black beans along with the chickpeas because they are my favorite! I drained both cans as well before adding. I also added a quarter teaspoon of cumin along with the other seasonings. After bringing everything to a boil and letting simmer, I removed the chicken thighs and finished them in the oven but left the soup in the pot. I made a small roux with butter and wheat flour and added that to the soup with the chorizo. When the chicken was done I removed it from the bone and shredded it down to re add to the soup. I let it simmer for another 8-10 minutes and then served. It was fantastic !! A little too spicy initially for my girlfriend but she still came back for seconds!

This was delicious, but I added my own twist. I only used 1 1/2 onions, added an extra carrot, left out the chorizo, and used chicken breast cut up into chunks. I browned the chicken before putting it in the stew. The key difference was that I added 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar, 1 tsp white wine vinegar, 1/4 cup red wine, and let it simmer for a little over an hour. Some of the reviewers said it was flavorless, but mine was anything but with these additions. Will definitely cook again!

Rating three as written although this recipe has a lot of potential but some real problems re lack of instructions especially whether or not to drain the tomatoes and beans; also would chunks of carrots cook completely by simmering for twenty-five minutes? I knew in advance that I would alter to cut fat just for my own dietary requirements.  Here are the ingredients I changed: 1 medium/large red onion (thot using three onions for four servings was a bit excessive...personal preference); 2 cups petite carrots; 2 15 oz cans whole tomatoes, broken, juice reserved; 1 can garbanzo, drained and rinsed; 4 chicken thighs, skin removed; Hillshire Farms Turkey Pepper Jack Smoked Sausage; Cajun seasoning (sub for red pepperflakes); no potato (served over rice). Add water to the reserved tomato juice to make two cups and sub for water.  Here is the method: saute onions and carrots with spices.  Add garlic.  Add tomatoes, beans, tomato juice. Add chicken on top; cook until chicken is done. Remove chicken; add sausage; debone chicken; add chicken back to pan. What I would do differently next time:  definitely season the chicken and brown the chicken in the pan with the onions and carrots.  The chicken had no flavor even cooking in the tomato/vegetable mixture. May also try not using the tomato juice and using two cups chicken broth.  Despite all the changes, I liked this combination of ingredients and flavors and will use this recipe again.

This stew is absolutely amazing! Served over white rice, with a glass of red wine you'd think your at a 5 star restaurant - when really your in the comfort of your own home! First off, I added way more garlic than suggested (clearly I'm Garlic's biggest fan). Secondly, depending on your serving amount I would substitute a cup of water for a cup of chicken broth. OR you can also use the entire suggested amount of water and add a Bouillon cube of chicken broth(which ever rocks your boat). And if you like spicy food DO add the red pepper flakes in ADDITION to a dab of Cayenne Pepper. I promise, you will have yourself, family, and friends yearning for more.

I have to admit, I had doubts that carrots, red onions and chickpeas would work together.  I used only 1.5 red onions because they were big, and used broth instead of water (I ended up adding a little more than 2 cups).   I left out the chicken and used about 10 ounces of sausage.  Fantastic.  We thought the chickpeas were a little hard, but we're looking forward to the leftovers to see if they soften overnight.

Either I did something wrong or this recipe had very little flavor.  The flavor is not there and even though I cooked it longer than it said, both on the stove and in the oven, it never thickened.  It remained like a broth.  There is nothing in it to thicken it.  I would not make this again.

Next time will use chicken broth instead of water

I made this for dinner and it was lovely!  Very good and easy to make. I cut the red pepper in half, used audollie sausage, increased the carrots and potatoes and topped with fresh chopped parsley and sliced almonds. I so served over brown rice.   My family LOVED it!  Don' t omit the smoked paprika. It really adds exactly what you need and increases the complexity. Make sure to used smoked and not regular paprika. Cheers!

this was very good.  had everything on hand, but used leftover turkey meat instead of chicken.  therefore the cooking method was slighly different.  also, i used chicken broth instead of water.  spicy!  and we like it like that!  thanks for the post BettyBoothroyd!
