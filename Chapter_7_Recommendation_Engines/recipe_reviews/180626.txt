The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly. It was OK, but too bland for my palate. I made it again tonight. Doubled the wine, tripled the parsley, 10 cloves of garlic, 1 T of oregano. Now we're talking. As written, I'm sorry, but I'd grade it no higher than a 3. Making it more assertive - a 5. So I compromise with a 4 rating here, for it is truly a good combination of flavors; simply not enough of them for me.

I have been making this dish since it got published.  I couldn't bring myself to add one cup of oil so I used only enough to brown the chicken. I also sub tiny boiler onions for the shallot as they are easier to find and cheaper here. Today I decided to make it in my Crockpot. I wasn't disappointed, if anything it was better. I didn't use the broth because of the excess liquid issue and it intensified the flavors. Excellent recipe either way. Thank-you Gracey for a wonderful dish that I have made and will make again and again.

I used less than 1/4 c olive oil, and increased the chicken broth to 2 cups.  My 4 kids and husband all gave 2 thumbs up--a rarity in our house.  Yum!!!!!

I usually always follow the recipe verbatim the first time I prepare it. I agree though it needs more oomph (or in this case, more OPA!). Whoever mentioned doubling the wine, 1 TBS of oregano and ten cloves of garlic is on the right track.

This dish was awesome. Chicken was tender, the shallots melted in your mouth, the flavors were warm and inviting. Easy to make, I used 5 chicken breasts in this dish and served with white rice, poured the yummy broth from this over the rice. I got RAVE reviews from my whole family even from the pickiest child. Thanks soo much Gracey for this recipe will make this again.

If you added mushrooms you'd practically have a coq au vin. A bit of sugar brought out the sweetness of the tomatoes. I threw in green beans, carrots, and potatoes, all of which absorbed the excellent flavours and the potatoes thickened the sauce a bit. Fabulous with pain de campagne to dip in the sauce and clean your plate with. Made three days worth - mmmmmmmmm!!!

This was SO delicious! This is such a keeper. I think I will make a few modifications next time - a little less olive oil and shallots. I think throwing in a potato might help thicken the consistency a bit, too. I peeled most of the skin off my chicken; the olive oil and chicken grease can be a bit much. Otherwise, this is a fabulous recipe.

Made this last night. It was really quite good! I used 6 large shallots and blanched/peeled them as instructed. They "slide" right out of their outer-layers this way, so that was a great tip. I used a pkg of bone-in/skin-on thighs and drumsticks since my family loves dark meat in a stew. I used a bit more tomato sauce (chunky style with herbs), and I used 3 heaping Tbsp of minced garlic and a lot more Oregano than what it called for, b/c we like more flavorful dishes as well. Used lots of chopped fresh parsley, too. Also added a container of fresh white mushrooms, halved. The results were good! Meat totally fell off the bone, and the flavors were great. My husband didn't care for it, but that's because I put it over Batsmati rice, which was sticky and mushy. I think over egg noodles would be better next time. Thanks for sharing!

This was really delicious.  My 11 yr old was especially taken by it, and by the way it smells while cooking.  I did have to make a couple of changes, due to what I had.  I didn't have shallots, so I used very thickly sliced up onion, and didn't blanch them first.  I also didn't use near the oil called for, but I did use more than I normally would-prob. close to 1/4 cup.  I didn't have any parsley, but I added a bunch of fresh marjoram and a little fresh oregano.  At the end, I thickened it up with a little cornstarch slurry.  Served it with rice and salad.  I love this recipe, albeit a little changed up.

Good, but not great...it smelled so good while simmering that I was anticipating a very flavorful meat...but the meat was on the dry side, with not much flavor! I will make it again, as I like the flavor of the broth, but next time I will pierce the raw chicken with a fork to get the flavor in, and I'll cook it at a lower temperature for longer.

This is great! Made exactly as stated, except I reduced the oil. Love the broth over rice. Next I'll try it with chicken breasts to make it easier.

AWESOME dish!  I read the reviews before making it and cut way down on the olive oil.  I also added more chicken stock and red wine and simmered for about 2 hours.  DELICIOUS!!!!!!

I had such high hopes but the end result was greasy and tasteless.  I thought that 1 cup of olive oil was a bit much but went against my better judgment and used it anyway.  I even thought that I should probably have drained the pain after the chicken fried but didn't do that either.  I stuck to the recipe to a "T" and unfortunately it was disappointing.  ~ TIPS ~  a) cut down on the oil/butter or b) drain the grease after frying.

I followed the recipe but took others' advice and added more spice -- lots of garlic, oregano, basil. It still was kind of bland -- last minute I quartered mushrooms and sauteed, then added, as well as chunks of green and red peppers. The chicken was very tender as a simmered it for hours, but just not that flavorful.

Delicious! I substituted white wine for red and used 2 leeks because I couldn't find shallots at the local store. I also added some red potatoes for volume and doubled the spices (I like bolder flavor). Will definitely make again!

This was wonderful!  Very tender and tasty.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I reduced the olive oil to 1/3 C.  My four children and husband all enjoyed it.  I appreciated the advice on dealing with shallots...to blanche them first and then remove the skins (although they get very slippery).

I made this for my family and served it with white rice. Everyone loved it. I cut the olive oil in half and used a little more chicken broth.  The next time I will bone the chicken legs and thighs at my wife's behest.  She also had me remove all the skin from the final product, which is healthy, but the skin is really tasty.

This is an incredibly versatile, delicious and easy to make dish - easily modified for your palate or wonderful (and more neutral-tasting) as written.  I add more garlic and a dash of spice.  My picky husband loves it!

This sounds like it would be great but it really is bland.  I doubled the wine and sliced the shallots and threw it all into the crockpot with a little broth.  I also added another can of tomato sauce.  I kept adding more ingredients (oregano, basil, onion powder) as it cooked because it was SO BLAND.  However, after adding the extras and a good dose of seasoned salt, it turned out really good.

Tried it for the first time today. It’s cooking as I type. Easy to follow recipe. I made a few changes as I added two strings of fresh Rosemary, more Oregano than called for, a little bit of dried Mint. It smells wonderful and it’s full of flavour. As my husband is Greek and we just returned from a 2 week trip to Crete, I can tell you that Stifado is supposed to be oily. Extra virgin Olive oil is a staple in Greek cooking. And whatever you do, do NOT use canned anything as Greek cuisine prides itself on freshness. Yiayia (grandma) would smack you upside your head if you dared to substitute for anything less. Kali orexi!,,

Overall a really good dish!  Like was suggested I doubled the wine and garlic for extra taste and did not use anywhere near that much butter and oil. 

I also added more tomato sauce and broth to make extra sauce to which I added cut up potatoes and frozen string beans to give more substance to the dish. The vegetables picked up the flavor from the sauce which made them extra delicious. I used chicken breast instead of the whole chicken which was good...not as moist as the dark meat would have been but I had chicken breast in the freezer and it still tasted good.

Followed the recipe but wasn't that great. Never tried this dish before but I'm sure it was supposed to taste better. Likely user error but not sure where I went wrong.

Made a handful of times now and always turns out great.  I don't have to change much since I keep most of the ingredients on hand.  Once our meat rabbits start kindling I look forward to trying it with rabbit.

Hated for the meal to come to an end.  Really good.  Did as some suggested -- less olive oil, more wine, oregano to taste and had to use a can of tomatoes rather than tomato sauce because I assumed there was some in the cupboard.  Served over rice.  My husband really enjoyed it also.

A good base recipe, however I made some additions per the suggestions of other reviewers. Used 6 boneless/skinless breasts, cut in half, as that's what I had on hand (also, I seasoned the chicken with salt/pepper). Used a bit less oil, probably 1/2 cup, 4 teaspoons oregano, doubled the wine, used half prepared pasta sauce, half diced tomatoes in juice (I doubled it and added cornstarch to thicken, but it was really saucy). Added probably 8 or so garlic cloves, didn't have shallots so I used a combo of yellow/purple onions, slivered. I also added about a teaspoon of basil, and probably about a teaspoon salt, maybe 1/2 teaspoon pepper. I served this over white rice cooked with a bit of olive oil and salt. All in all, I guess it strayed from the Greek ideal, but it got rave reviews, even from picky teenagers!

I made this last night and loved it granted I did not follow the recipe exactly.  I tend to go a little overboard with the spices that said I will def. use this again.

Excellent recipe that my family keeps requesting.  I use boneless half breasts and cut each into three or four large chunks. And then the oil... first time I made it, I used the full cup and it was an oily, gloppy mess. I used 1/4 cup the next time. Then 2 tablespoons after that.  Last night, I used just a drizzle on the bottom of the pan and it was perfect.  You do not need all that oil for this recipe. Flavors are amazing once you get that oil out of the way, very light and fresh. I saw no need to boost the flavors with any extra ingredients. The braising of the chicken leaves it very moist. I serve with white or brown rice and toasted pitas to soak up all the broth. My tween loves it and he is way picky. Thank you for this great recipe!

This was a very good dish.  I too used 1/3 cup oil as some suggested and Chicken breast. It was very yummy over rice and a side of Thyme Green Beans also form this web site!  Great meal
