This was extremely smooth and tasty.  Will definitely make it again!  I left out the rum since we don't drink but left everything else the same.

Great recipe.  I added only half the amount of eggs and less cream than the recipe called for and it was still delicious.  If the eggs curdle, place the mixture in a bowl on top of a large bowl of ice water and beat rapidly with an electric mixture and this should save your eggnog!

Whoa nelly! I used a double boiler for heating the milk. Instead of whisking the milk mixture into the eggs and then back into the double boiler, I just tempered the eggs with about 1/2 cup of the milk mixture, then whisked that into the double boiler. And I used one cinnamon stick instead of ground cinnamon and a little allspice. It was pretty strong last night. I can't wait to see how it ripens. So next time I will definitely cut down on the rum. Oh! And I did have a milk curdling problem in spite of using a double boiler and constantly stirring, so I just poured the milk mix into the blender and kept it running while I added the rum and cream.  Update!  I tried pumpkin pie spice this time around and did use less rum...perfect!!

So the negative reviews almost scared me away, but after I read "If you don't like this recipe, you don't like eggnog." I decided to give it a shot and they were RIGHT! I followed suggestions of using only 1 cup of sugar. It's definately sweet enough with only 1 cup. However, I did not add rum. I used 1 tsp of rum extract. Everything else I followed TO THE LETTER. Be very very careful not to burn the milk. When returning the mixture to saucepan, I was worried. Alot of people said the mixture coagulated. After 3 minutes went by (as suggested, on medium heat) the mixture was foaming but not "thickening". I wondered, how thick is thick? As soon as I saw a pudding-like 'chunk' on my spoon I immediately removed the pan from heat and kept stirring. As it cooled, it thickened significantly.. it ended up like pumpkin pie filling before you cook it.  Hope this helps someone!

I am sooo so sorry but I nor my family that I had over for Christmas dinner liked this eggnog.  It was too strong in the liquor taste.  We couldn't drink it at all and believe me, we are not a family of angels that don't drink.  I went exactly by the recipe and even managed to not scorch the milk.  I enjoyed making it but threw all of it out this morning.  Is there an actual "light rum" like there is light beer?  I used the clear colored rum that I would considered light and hope that wasn't what messed it up.  If I ever get the nerve to make it again, I will use less rum.  Please let me know what I did wrong.

great recipe!  1st time i've made eggnog.  i wanted to make sure i got it right and looked at a lot of different recipes, tips and techniques.  alton brown, from good eats suggest to first beat the egg yolks by themselves until they are lighter in color.  he says this helps to keep the egg yolks from curdling later.  i followed this tip and no lumps or curdling at all.  he's sort of a scientific guy so he had a whole explanation for it.  YUM!

good but we didn't cook the egg yolk mixture in the sauce pan.  and we also beat the egg whites until stiff peaks formed and then stired that into the eggnog to make it thicker and creamery.

Yep, amazingly good stuff!!
I used half & half cream and a 1/4 less sugar. I seperated about 1/2 of it without the rum(for my nephew & me) and 1/2'd the rum. 
A keeper to be sure ;-)
I made this again this year and it is soooo good. I only use 1/2 or less of the rum so it's not so overwhelming

This eggnog recipe is great. I made this last year and I'm already getting requests for it again this year. Only change I made is I add a famous chocolatiers White Chocolate Liquor to it and it makes it amazing.

Thanks for the recipe!

Gave this one out as Xmas gift to neighbours who have all returned the containers asking for refills.  A real winner, think it is safer using the double boiler method for last stage to prevent curdling

Recipe is excellent espeically if you are making something with egg white and need something to do with the yolks.  Next time I would not use the rum at all and let anyone add it if they wish.  I only used 3/4 cup and it was too much.  Really good otherwise.

This is the best eggnog recipe of all time.   I leave out the rum because I make it as a dessert.  Many of the negative reviews are referencing the rum.  I think the ratio is wrong in the recipe for that ingredient, so definitely scale back some if you don't want it to knock out your party lol  I also cut back on the sugar (by about 1/4 cup).  Store bought eggnog is really sweet.  I like sweet, but not sicky sweet.  I don't use the double boiler method because it doesn't really prevent the problems that people have.  So basically that's it, don't use too much sugar or rum.  If you don't have light cream, sub half heavy whipping cream with half whole milk (tastes the same).   Need small saucepan, strainer (for cloves), whisk, and mixing bowl to make this recipe.  Hope that helps.

I was generally satisfied with this recipe. I didn't have any cloves so I just left that out. I used only half of the alcohol and people still thought that was plenty. The only thing that bothered me was that before cooling I poured the wonderfully fragrant mixture into a thermos to bring to Xmas dinner. By the time I got there the next day it had separated into a foamy layer on top and liquid on bottom. A quick stir with a big spoon corrected it and it tasted great. I suppose that is a small price to pay for homemade eggnog without the non-separating chemicals you get with the grocery store brand.

OH MY GOD... absolute perfection! I used half-and-half because I couldn't find light cream in any store. I don't know how it was *supposed* to taste, but I can't imagine it tasting any better than this! I also followed a friend's advice and prepared it the night before, which gave the ingredients a chance to set. She was absolutely right! The next day, the eggnog tasted a lot richer and creamier than the night I prepared it. I served it at my holiday party and the guests were ecstatic about it! Not only that, but the leftovers stayed in my refrigerator for a good two weeks after the party (the recipe made two pitchers-full!) and it was still just as delicious as the day of the party. This recipe is DEFINITELY staying with me.

Nataliesmom is my sister and I tried her eggnog for the first time this Christmas.  It was the best homemade eggnog I have ever tasted and better than store bought eggnog too.  I will be making it myself in the future.  I give it five stars - and not just because she's my sis.

Ohhohoh! So good! I did a half batch using whole milk (no cream) and omitting the rum (we have a four-year-old!). Because we used milk, it was much thinner than it would be with cream, but it was still really good. I used two cinnamon sticks for the half-batch in place of the ground cinnamon but next time I would only use one as my husband said it was a bit strong (he's allergic but not terribly so). I had no problem at all with curdling eggs: I heated the milk mixture in step one, then I whisked the yolks and sugar together as per step two. I slowly added ½ cup of hot milk to the yolk/sugar mixture, whisking constantly. When it was all well incorporated, I added another half-cup. And another. And another. After there was two cups of the hot milk mixture whisked in, I slowly whisked the egg-milk mixture into the saucepan, and then followed the rest of step two. No problems here! Since I omitted the rum, it was a little too sweet, so next time I'd cut back on the sugar if we're omitting the rum. Thanks for sharing, Natalie's mom! :)

Great recipe! I followed someone else's advice and reduced the amount of egg yolks. Being Indian, I used masala chai spices consisting of cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, one peppercorn, and cardamom(no tea) all crushed together and it gave it a very nice kick!

The only word I can think of to describe this eggnog is SUPERB!  It is very easy to make, and it is 
deliciously smooth and creamy. I will definitely make
it again.

Really good. I'm not a big fan, but my super picky husband, who loves eggnog, loved it. He's very excited that now I'll be able to make this year round since it's only available in stores during the holidays. It really is better the next day because the day you make it, if you drink it, it's kind of gritty but it mellows out by the following day. Just make sure you mix the container each time you take a glass because the spices go to the bottom after a while.

This eggnog is DELICIOUS, a real winner. I made a batch to try out before the actual holiday event and I can't stop "taste-testing"! I used a darker rum just out of preference and grated a little fresh nutmeg over each serving. Will definitely make this over and over.

eggcellent!   I have made this sooo many times since Christmas.  My husband can't get enough!  Good thing I like egg white omelets.  Two things that I do differently......leave out the rum (then I use Captain Morgan for those who want alcohol, for this recipe its better than unspiced!) also I use brown sugar in place of 1/2 cup of the white sugar, it adds a fuller flavor to the nog.

I DON'T like eggnog!  BUT....I LOVE this stuff!  Just tried it over the Thankgiving holidays at my brother's house and fell in love!  It is so delicious, I can't imagine not having it every year for the rest of my holiday seasons!  My brother used rum in his batch.  It kept really well in the frig.  We "sampled" it for several days.  The only thing I would change is to make a bigger batch so we could enjoy larger cups without drinking it all up in one day!  Thanks for sharing Nataliesmom!

I just wanted to add a few comments since some of you have had trouble with the egg yolks cooking.  The milk should just barely  come to a boil, not a full rolling boil.  Make sure you pour the milk into the yolk/sugar mixture and not vice versa.  Also, it has to be done very slowly.  Start off pouring in about half a cup and whisking as you do it.  Then add a little more milk, increasing the amount each time until about half the milk is mixed in.  By that point, you can pretty much just pour the rest in and whisk.  I've never had my eggs get cooked by the milk and this is always how I do it.  Hope that helps!  And remember to add rum TO TASTE.  My family are drinkers so the amount called for in the recipe is the amount we like.  You might want to start off with less and add more later after the flavors have time to blend.

Be very careful when you're bringing the milk mixture to a boil in the beginning - it only need to  JUST boil, or it might curdle!!  Also, we whisked the egg yolks and the sugar in the kitchenaid mixer until they were fluffy, and then VERY VERY SLOWLY (at least for the first couple of cups) added the hot milk mixture to the fluffy egg yolk mixture with the mixer still going on medium speed - that way the egg mixture gets tempered and doesn't turn into scrambled egg!

When everything was all mixed we put it back on the stove and cooked it (stirring constantly) until it reached 160F, which is when eggs are deemed "safe". You have the option (in some recipes) to whip the egg whites up separately and then fold them into the eggnog at the very end (I'm not sure whether you'd add them to the hot eggnog or whether you'd let it cool first...) but we didn't do that.

I usually don't take the time to give a write-up, but in this case I thought maybe so. I really looked at a lot of recipes because I was looking for a good one.  I can tell you this is it.  Very easy to make, and it came out so nice.  I cut the rum down to a cup and a half from the 2 1/2 it calls for so it wasn't overpowering.  Don't get the idea that this will taste anything (thank goodness) like the eggnog you buy in a carton.  This is so much better.  It's exactly what I was looking for!  Thanks for sharing the recipe Nataliesmom.

This is fantastic egg nog! We served it new years eve and it was gone in the first hour.  I served rum and brandy on the side for our guests to spike themselves instead of mixing it in.

I don't drink eggnog, so I don't have first hand experience, but I made this for my dad for Christmas.  He loved it, couldn't get enough!

Oh my, oh my!!  I do believe this tastes better than anything you could get from a store, it's so easy, AND there's no raw egg!  Could life get any better?  This stuff is amazingly good.

Excellent! This will definitely become a holiday tradition!  You can use up to half the rum and still have the flavor of it without getting toasted.  But depending on how hectic your holidays are, you might want to add the whole amount... and then some!  I suggest adding the rum to taste.

Delicious! Very thick, very smooth, perfect taste. Everyone at work enjoyed it and was shocked to learn that it was home made.  Told by all that it's better tasting than the stuff bought in the store.  Made it exactly as the recipe called for.  Tempered the eggs with a cup or so of the hot milk so they wouldn't curdle.  Used Cruzan Vanilla Rum only because it was in the cabinet.  Will use the Captain next time. Doubled recipe and took half out for those who don't enjoy the rum.  Flavored with rum extract.  Both, with and without rum was excellent.  Follow the recipe, get excellent results.

Amazingly Wonderful Eggnog! My husband, who hates store-bought eggnog, loves this, as do both my kids! I thought the ground cinnamon made it too "gritty", so I used 2 whole cinnamon sticks that I strained out with the cloves. Definitely use the double boiler so the milk & egg mixture doesn't curdle- you'll get a nice creamy consistency.

This eggnog is so good it is ridiculous!  I don't even like eggnog and I loved it. My husband had four mugs of it, plus my husband also made a milkshake. I also gave some out to neighbors as a Christmas gift. 
I couldn't find whole cloves so I just used a generous pinch of ground cloves and it worked just fine.

I agree - oh my!  This is excellent.  It's in my refrigerator right now waiting to be served tomorrow night at a gathering of my co-workers.  I hope it makes it!  My husband is hanging around the kitchen asking for tastes.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was my first time making eggnog and I was thoroughly impressed. It's gorgeous! Way better than any you can buy at the shops! My sister and I managed to polish it all off in one sitting. I have made it since and i divided the batch in two. One was made with light rum, the other with dark rum. Both went down a storm! Family members have their favourites, some preferring the dark rum but everyone agrees, it's fabulous!

This was a great recipe. It wasn't as difficult as I thought it would be. After it sat overnight the nutmeg became very strong so I may cut down on that nextime. Other than that it was very good. Thank you.

This is a fabulously simple and great tasting recipe.  I left out the rum as this time I made it more for "around the house" consumption rather than a party, but the flavor and consistancy was great.  Also, you can play with the seasonings until it is as you want it.  I think that this eggnog is a bit heavier on the cinnamon taste than store bought stuff, but I liked the warmth of the cinnamon.  I really like nutmeg & cloves so I increased those a bit.  All in all, this is one for the recipe box:)

This is the first time I've ever made eggnog, but I left out the rum. I had a little curdling as well but I blended it and it came out perfectly! My dad said "It has the perfect name, it is amazingly good eggnog!" I'll definitely be making this more often...much better than the store bought one.

My son is always asking why I didn't buy eggnog (in the middle of summer) so I can't tell you how happy I am to have found this recipe!  My cloves were a little old so I decided to use pumpkin pie spice in place of the cinnamon & cloves.  I used 11 yolks (one got away from me), 1 1/4 c sugar (will use 1 c next time) and fat free half n' half in place of the light cream (next time I'll try all whole milk).  I cooked the whole mixture over low-med heat for about 10-15 minutes & I didn't have any problems with the eggs.  I wanted to be extra sure they were safe for my kids to consume.  It's chilling in the fridge right now & I can't wait to let my kids try it because it's already delicious!  Now time to make an ANGEL FOOD CAKE with all the egg whites!  Thank you for a great recipe we can enjoy all year!

Delicious!  I see why this would be a must make every year.  I used half and half instead of full cream and it turned out light and delightful.  My husband raved about it and I know he will beg me to make this easy recipe every year too!

This was fantastic.  It did take longer to prepare than the suggested 20 minutes, but it was well worth it.  I did a half recipe, and like many of the other reviewers, I used less than the recommended amount of rum but still found it potent.  I consulted with my mom before trying this recipe, and she told me that the key to not curdling the eggs when mixing in the hot milk is to do it a teaspoon at a time.  That way, the eggs warm slowly and don't cook in the mixing bowl.  After you get about half of the mixture in, you can start pouring more in at a time.  I did it that way and I had no problems.

Yummmmm.  Great consistency and spiced well.  I will reduce the sugar next time as it was a little sweet for my taste.  I left out the rum so the kids could drink it though I added a jigger of Morgan's Spicy Rum to my glass. Ohhhhhh my gosh.  This is a keeper. Thanks!

This egg nog has a nice taste but because the eggs were cooked, has a lumpy texture. I prefer the store bought egg nog...or perhaps this recipe without the cooking.

This is very good.  This has been my 4th year in a row that I've made it.  This year I cut the sugar down to 1 cup and next year in 2012, I intend to cut the sugar amount to 3/4 cup.  Also, since the beginning I've used 1/2 & 1/2 in place of the cream and I use our local "Cruzan" dark rum.   Lastly, I double the recipe for gift giving.

I will never be able to drink store bought after making this. It is so delicious!  I cut the rum in half and I thought it made for the perfect amount of rum.  Any more would have been too strong for me!!  Next time I will make sure I have some whipped cream to put on top!  It lasted in my fridge for several days and we all were really able to enjoy it to the last drop!!

This recipe was absolutley AMAZING!  I had never attempted to make egg nog, but was thinking of how great this would be to put in a basket of goodies for friends and family for Christmas.  I am so impressed!  It was time consuming waiting for the milk to boil, but it was an all-in-all easy recipe.  I am not a drinker, so I substituted 1 tsp of rum extract for the rum...delicious.  My only alteration when I make it again (tomorrow) is that I will cut the sugar back to 1 cup.  I used 1+1/4 cup today, and it was just a tad too sweet.  I think I would prefer it to be a bit spicier as well.  (Of course, I just made it about 3 hours ago, so the taste is likely to change once all of the flavors have time to marry overnight.)  THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing this fabulous recipe!

the only change I make to this is to omit the rum so it's kid friendly.  My family loves this!  The flavor is smooth and just the right texture.  You will never buy eggnog again after making this recipe!

Very tasty recipe & I'm an eggnog fan. My local store didn't carry "light cream" so I used 2 cups 1/2&1/2 with 2 cups heavy cream and that worked very well. Also used fresh ground ginger ( I use a coffee grinder dedicated to spices ). WARNING: this recipe is NOT for dieters!

Absolutely delicious!  I am still very much a novice in the kitchen, but I managed to make this without any problems and it tastes fabulous. (We omitted the rum and used low-fat half and half in place of the light cream.)

I had some store bought eggnog 12/23/04 and debated about even making this recipe, I did not like the taste of eggnog at all.
I decided to make the recipe due to my husbands family being big eggnog fans.  Everyone, including me, was impressed with this eggnog, it was delicious.  It tastes very rich and sweet, almost like icecream. Thanks so much for this wonderful eggnog recipe.

I completely disagree with the previous reviwer. This eggnog is not bland in any sense of the word. If it turned out that way then she/he did something wrong when making it.  This is a very tasty recipe and thank you for the cooked eggs.  It's very hard to find a good eggnog without raw eggs and this isn't just good, it's fantastic!  My only suggestion to others is to go light on the rum, refrigerate and taste before adding more.  Some people like rum more than others and you can't really tell how the flavors will blend until it cools.

I was actually looking for a recipe that I could easily make into a non-alcoholic version, so why did I pick the one with 2 1/2 cups of rum? I liked the other proportions! I made this as directed but after cooling the tempered egg mixture I didn't add the rum. I added 2 1/2 more cups of milk (to get the volume right) along with the cream and about 1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons of rum flavoring. It was delicious and my kids guzzled it like water! I had to make 3 batches of this the week of Christmas...it was a hit.

OH MY GOD!!! It was so good. I left out the alcohol and let each person add it to their drink individually if they wanted it. I didn't have any problem with my milk curdling. I didn't bother tempering the eggs, they did cook up a little so maybe a I should have. I ran it all through the blender, so it was fine. Sooo rich though. Could only do a few sips at a time, or had to cut with milk. Will make for many more holidays to come.

I'm sorry, but I can't give this 5 stars. The mixture was far to thick, and didn't even taste like eggnog. Alton Brown has a recipe that I'll stick to......

Not only did this make wonderful eggnog it made delicious ice cream too.  Just out of curiosity I put the leftover eggnog in my ice cream freezer and it turned out great.  I did leave out the rum and add a small amount of rum extract instead.

Wow, this recipe was very hard to master, but the results were worth it 100%.

I took andyandjenny's advice on how to best prepare this eggnog, and since I'm a teetoaller, adding the rum wasnt an issue, but boy! was it spicy! I doubled the cloves and cinnamon, and halved the milk and eggs, so it came out VERY creamy and VERY spicy. Well done nataliesmom!

Excellent taste.  I used only 6 egg yolks instead of 12, 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream and a teaspoon of rum extract instead of the rum. Serves only 8 or so, but it is less caloric and less costly to make.  Still very tasty!!

This is Awesome.  I made it at least 3 times over the holidays.  I also left the alcohol (we used brandy) on the side and let people put whatever they wanted in, as not everyone likes or can drink alcohol.  My 6 year old loved it.  Even with the brandy, it was extremely smooth and was the tastiest we've ever had, and we've tried quite a few.  We used to drink the Pennsylvania Dutch from the liquor store with all the alcohol in it and thought that we wouldn't be able to match that taste, but this was much better.  Much less expensive too, depending on the alcohol.  Once I only had heavy cream and used that and it was just as good.  You just have to watch the milk carefully, because once it boiled over, but I rescued it and it was still great.  The only thing is trying to figure out what to do with all the egg whites.

This is one of three cooked eggnog recipes I found in AllRecipes, but the only one I tried.  It truly is amazingly good, and it's even better if left another day in the fridge for the flavors to mingle.  I've already made several six-serving batches this holiday (this fit into my cooking & serving pieces better than one giant 12-serving batch).  As Natalie's Mom points out, it's *critical* not to let the egg-and-milk mixture boil--a moment's inattention, and I'd ruined the batch when the whole thing curdled!  Therefore, I strongly recommend using a double boiler for steps 1 and 2.  It is delicious with either rum or whiskey.  Thanks, Natalie's Mom!

We made two batches of this...one alcoholic and one without alcohol.  We decreased the amount of alcohol in half and found it was still a little too strong for us.  But that is just our preference, and I actually prefer non alcoholic eggnog.  The non alcoholic batch was AMAZING!  We even used skim milk to make ours, so it wasn't super thick, but the was so amazing.  Way better than any of the best store bought kind.  This will be a keeper and will be what we make for years to come!

This was probably one of the most ambitious recipes I've tried and the results are well worth the effort!  To temper the eggs, pour about a half cup of the milk mixture into the eggs at a time and continuously whisk.  I had no problem at all with curdling eggs.  I also only used 2 cups of cream and replaced the balance with milk.  The consistency was perfect - not too thin and not too thick.  An excellent recipe!

FABULOUS!!! My first time making eggnog and it was a huge hit with everyone! And very yummy as well! I used only a cup of rum, like some reviews had suggested(even after adding 1 cup it was very strong to me) and a few people put in more to their taste, but i have to say most liked it as it was. I also used heavy cream, which gave it a nice thick texture. I didn't have problems with curdling either, our eggs were at room temperature so maybe that helped along with having my boyfriend help and pour the milk super slowly a little at a time while i whisked away in the egg bowl (b/c after reading reviews i was worried about that as well, but it worked fine for us). Overall, FANTASTIC RECIPE.!!! Will definitley be making this again!!!

This is the best eggnog! Really easy to make, just be careful not to scald the milk.  I made 2 batches, 1 with rum and 1 without.  Both were really good but I liked the rum one best.  I served this at a party and it was gone right away and I had many requests for the recipe.  I'll be making this every year. Thanks for the yummy eggnog!

This was a great recipe. I used 3 different types of sugars and Paul Masson Brandy instead of rum.  Paul Masson is really smooth; therefore, making the eggnog smooth to taste. I probably used more than the recipe called for but you have to taste test as you go as with any recipe so that you cater to your own tastebuds. 

I saw that another review mentioned using a light colored rum and the eggnog did not come out well. I recommend only using a dark colored liquor for eggnog. I was skeptical about adding leaving the liquor in over night but it worked out find and mixed well. I whipped the leftover egg whites with sugar for some fluff to add to each glass of eggnog. Made this twice so far and all my family and friends loved it.

Super yummy!! I followed recipe exactly except halfed the nutmeg and substituted milk for rum for the kids. Awesome! be sure to let it set for a day or two to blend.  I will never use another recipe, it's that good!

I made this twice over the holidays. It got rave reviews. I personally found it too sweet but everyone else liked it as is so I will continue to make this recipe exactly as written.

I hate store bought egg nog....always have and always will. I was hesitant to make some, but my husband loves egg nog and I thought I would make some for him as a nice treat. OMG!! This stuff is AMAZING! I made it exactly as described, with the exception of tempering the eggs in a portion of the hot milk first. So easy to make. I let it sit for 24 hours before serving, and wowsers...great stuff! We had company for dinner, and they couldn't get enough of it. I now get asked to make it all the time. Calorie content may be higher, but so worth it over the holidays!

Fabulous!  This got many rave reviews at our faculty Christmas party last night.  I left out the rum entirely and didn't have whole cloves, so I followed a previous reviewer's advice and substituted 1/2 tsp ground cloves.  I had no curdling problems at all - just whisked in the hot mixture 1/2 cup at a time.  I will definitely make this again!

Excellent. Perfect, as written. If some reviewers wanted thicker eggnogg, then perhaps this wasn't  for the recipe for them in the first place -- but instead of slamming it, they should just find one that suits their tastes (whether common or not). Same goes for the level of rum. Just because recipes are not to your PERSONAL taste, it doesn't mean it's a bad recipe -- but it may mean that you're just not a talented or experienced enough cook to read a recipe and judge what modifications might need to be made. All in all, I just wish people would quit slamming recipes as a whole because it doesn't suit "them." Heck, I doubt I would want to be "them" anyway......

This eggnog is great! I live in China... not exactly the land of eggnog. My husband loved this recipe. We can only get full cream here so I substitute whole milk for 1/2 of the cream. We also leave the rum out and sprinkle a little nutmeg on every cup we serve. It's delicious!

Oh. My. Goodness.  This is heavenly!  I know that the holidays are busy, and the last thing I need is another item on my "to do" list, but...  I think I'm going to have to make this eggnog a Christmas tradition!  All three kids agree that it's better than storebought.  Even my non-eggnog-drinker enjoyed it.  This is a "must try" recipe.  I goofed and added whole eggs rather than yolks.  The eggs curdled, but a quick whirl in the blender took care of that little problem.  I subbed a split vanilla bean for the 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract in the first step.  I couldn't find light cream, but half and half seemed to work fine.  I didn't add rum because of the kids, but guests could add rum according to their tastes at serving.  Unfortunately, this eggnog won't be around long enough for guests to enjoy!  Merry Christmas!

This recipe is really, really good!!  Yummmmmmmm!!!  I, like another reviewer, slightly curdled my milk/egg yolk mixture while cooking (and I was sooo careful), but I too used my blender to "smooth" it out, and it worked great!!  Thank goodness for blenders or I have wasted 16 egg yolks!!  (I made a gallon of the egg nog for our card party tonight).  I also froze the egg whites for future meringues.  

I cut down on the rum too, and used spiced rum.  Wow, this is a great recipe and it will certainly be a hit tonight!!

I made a double batch without the alcohol for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  I had no problems with texture or consistency. After cooling I added 4 cups of light cream and ten cups of milk.  I'll make this again for Christmas, it really was delicous.

Ill never by from a store again.
Option - cut the rum in one half - the flavor is still there, but the alcohol effect is lessened.

Made this for Christmas Eve and everyone LOVED it!!  My first crack at egg nog and I would make this one again.  The two things I did different is not cook the mixture until thick, just hot and used dark rum instead.

Five wonderful stars.  Ok heres my dish.  I love this as does my boyfriend and were taking it to his moms house tomorrow.  I didnt use light i used heavy cream i read a previous review that said if you like it thick go for that and i do so i used that.  There was no way i was going to use whole cloves and drain a little to much for me so i used regular cloves.  Wonderful.  I do not measure anything smaller than a tablespoon so none of my spices were measured leaving it WONDERFUL!!  But this was my second time using it due to boyfriend help the previous night we over cooked the egg and milk stuff combined and it became HUGE CHUNKS.  So do not over heat.  Oh and due to making it a second time i didnt have enough egg yolks and also lost two while yolking them away from there whites so i only used 8 yolks.

I made eggnog using this recipe and accidentally only used 10 eggs instead of 12 and I intentionally omitted the rum so that it would be family friendly. It was plenty "eggy" and I would recommend using only the 10 eggs. It was really yummy and I will be making it again next year!

I have gotten myslef into something, haven't I?   It is VERY good!!!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

When doing this recipe pour the rum last and check to make sure it is up to your likes.  I made it with the original amount of rum and it came out super strong, but it still a great recipe!

Everyone LOVED this recipe.  My friends kept saying that the egg nog was much better than store-bought because it was not as heavy.  They said this version was so light (and I made it with half-and-half instead of light cream too!) that they could drink a lot of it!  I don't know if that's such a good thing....given the rum.  Anyway, I will definitely make this a holiday tradition--it was very easy to do.

Not that hard to make and it is very good.  I'm not sure what people who said it didn't taste like eggnog and those who called it too sweet were drinking.  Some people said it was too think and some said it was too thick.  Some complained about the rum and even the vanilla.

Here is the real deal:
Sweetness:  It isn't too sweet.  It is roughly in the same range as store bought eggnog.  It could certainly be adjusted, but I thought it was just right.

Thickness:  It is a little thinner than store bought eggnog once you put the rum in it.  If you put rum in the store bought kind, it gets thinner - duh.  If you want it to be as thick as non alcoholic, cut back on the rum, use heavy cream, or add a few more egg yolks to thicken it up.

Alcohol: If you don't like rum, you won't like it with the amount of rum called for in it.  I made it with Barbancourt which is a Haitian rum made in the French style. If people sat around and drank a couple good sized glasses of this, some of them would probably feel pretty good.  Half or even a quarter of the rum would be fine for people who weren't trying to get a buzz but wanted the real flavor.

Spices: It seemed pretty accurate.  I might throw a few extra cloves in it to start and maybe mull a stick of cinnamon in the milk with the cloves next time.  Nothing was overpowering.  No real issues.

Overall, it was what I wanted to make.  Eggnog isn't my favorite drink, but I enjoyed it very much.

I have made this eggnog every year for 6 years. It is perfect, the only thing you need to watch for is the rum. Go easy and add it little by little until it tastes where you feel is right. (Or let guests add it to their own glass) Also, helpful hit, make it at least a day before and if possible put it in a clean gallon size milk jug. When ready to serve, take it and shake it up vigorously. Yum!!!

This is delicious!! I used whipping cream and added the remaining vanilla and nutmeg plus an extra tbsp of sugar to it and beat it for several minutes before adding it to the egg mixture. I also used only 2 cups rum instead of 2 1/2. Glad I did or it would have been way too strong. I loved all the spices! Next time I may add cinnamon sticks and more cloves when heating the milk for added spiciness :-) Overall it was great!

Made it just like the recipe called for. We had it Christmas eve and morning and it was great! I was even asked for the recipe from a friend who rarely drinks egg nog!

Very tasty,but never really got it to thicken correctly.  It didn't effect the taste though.  Will try again next year!

Too sweet if you don't use any alcohol (which recipe says is optional). Might be too much sugar with all that rum too, haven't tried it. I strongly suggest starting with only 3/4c sugar; you can stir in more at the end if not sweet enough.

I give this recipe five stars because seriously this is true eggnog.  But here's a WARNING, while making this a little angel came by and stopped me from pouring the 2 and a half cups of rum into the mix. Instead  i added 1 cup and for me it was just right couldn't imagine adding more.  Next week when i make this again, i'm going to  make a batch especially for the kids and definitely no rum at all will be added.  Its still that good without it!

I think people are judging this recipe by the strong liquor taste but everyone has their own preference of how strong their alcoholic drinks should be in my opinion  just omit the alcohol while cooking and allow the people drinking it to add the alcohol themselves. I added about 1/2 tsp more of all of the spices and a little more sugar than the recipe calls for. This was the best egg nog I have ever had. I've been drinking egg nog since I was a young girl but it was always purchased from the grocery store.

First time trying to make eggnog at home - this is great!  Will use spiced rum, bourbon or brandy next time (rum was ok but the others are a little more mellow).  Captain Morgan's private stock would be phenomenal in this!  Only used a pinch of ground cloves (wanted a subtle hint).  Reduced liquor by 1/5.  Might double the vanilla at the end next time.  Great, GREAT recipe - now an eggnog convert :D  Try with gingerbread - YUM!    Edit:  made a 2nd batch with dark rum and extra vanilla - not good.  I think light rum works best b/c it doesn't overpower the subtle flavors.  The extra vanilla made it taste like the extract :/

YUM-MY! And it hasn't even sat overnight yet!!! We made as directed except instead of rum (which I don't believe should be in eggnog, anyway) we added 1 cup of cognac. It's so amazing - and much easier to make than I expected!! :-) (I'm living in the UK which is the only reason I'm actually making it - normally I'd just buy a mediocre carton at the grocery store.  Now I don't think I can ever do that again!!

Fantastic!! I followed many of the other reviews and definatly cut the sugar back to alittle less than a cup. Also only half of the rum is needed. We're drinkers and the whole amount this recipe calls would have been a bit too intoxicating. This was my first attempt at eggnog. Just awesome!!

Now this is real eggnog!  You won't find that artificial, gross, or syrupy tasting mess that is typical of store-bought eggnog here.  This eggnog is creamy, decadent, and natural.  In order to save myself and guests from an instant spike in cholesterol, I only used six yolks and replaced the cream with half and half.  I've made this recipe as-written too, and it *is* truly amazing, but with all the holiday goodies, I decided to cut back on the fats in this drink a bit.  It doesn't alter the flavor, but obviously it won't be as creamy.  Definitely don't skip on straining the custard, because you will have some "cooked egg pieces" in there otherwise.  In order to get the custard creamy enough, some of the egg does cook even while you're stirring on the lowest heat setting.  I cut the sugar back to 3/4 cup (with 1/4 cup of it being brown sugar because I ran out of white sugar) and it was perfect if you don't like too-sweet drinks. I think the amount of alcohol was good, but I like to taste the rum when it's drowned in lots of milk or cream. :)  If you want it to be more subtle, then yes, I recommend cutting down on the amount of rum at least one cup.

Very nice - not like the store-bought eggnog I grew up on, but very good. I took a batch to a work potluck and the older generation just raved about it. The younger ones could take it or leave it. I liked it very much though.

Truly Amazing! LOVE this recipe! I leave out the rum and people can add in own if want. Instead of 4 cups cream, I sometimes do 2 cups cream, 2 cups milk just to make it a little less rich. And I like to whip up the cream a bit ... adds a little extra richness and texture I think.  Everyone who's tried this raves about it and is asking for it come Christmas time! Also excellent in your morning coffee :) And definitely better the next day(s).

I have made this a few times now and it is the best eggnog that I have ever had. I do cute the rum down to only 1 cup and leave the bottle out next to the eggnog incase people want to add a little more.  I use half and half instead of light cream because I usually can't find light cream.  I also usually have problems with a few lumps or a little curdling.  If this happens simple put it in the blender or use an emersion blender.

I normally do not like eggnog.  The thought of the eggs just grosses me out.  But I tried to make this in hopes that me controlling how it is made would make me like it.  Boy I am so glad I found this!!!  This is amazing!  And I don't even like eggnog!!!  I made this exactly like the recipe said.  It took a lot longer than 5 minutes to get the milk to a boil and obviously higher than low heat.  I just made sure I continued to stir it so the milk didn't burn.  But that was the only thing I had to do differently.  This came out so creamy and flavorful!  I will be making this year after year and will probably need to make double-batches.  Thanks so much for sharing!

My first attempt trying to make anything like this. It took a little time, but was well worth the effort. Next time, I will omit the rum so the kids can try it and others can adjust the potency of their drinks.

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. Thanks for sharing! To any of you who may make the same mistake I did (I let the egg mixture get a little too hot and I almost had scrambled eggnog) there is a way to still save it! I'm sure it would have been better if I hadn't over cooked but here's what I did, I put the egg and milk mixture through a food processor so that it was smooth instead of clumpy, then I let it cool, and mixed in the cream, vanilla, etc.   SO IF YOU MAKE THAT MISTAKE DON'T JUST THROW IT OUT!!!!  When it was all said and done and cool, it was delicious. Perhaps the texture was not quite as nice, but it was still good.

I love this recipe! However, I did ever-so-slightly cut down on the sugar & the vanilla and love love love it this way. Oh - and I make mine without rum - tastes great if you're wondering how it will turn out without the alcohol. Thanks for the super recipe!

Absolutely Amazing! I made 4 batches of this, and tried it with and without Rum ...both ways it is splendid just as the recipe calls. If you don't love THIS recipe, you don't love Eggnog, it's as simple as that. Trust it as written and go with or without, either way this will be a HUGE success at your party.

I didn't "cook" the eggs because I only use organic free-range eggs from a family I know. (You have a 1 in 30,000 change of getting sick from eating regular raw eggs... the changes are even smaller using organic free range). Very good.

Creamy!!!  We loved it.  I make Eggnog every year, even though its not a traditional Xmas drink here in Australia.  This was the best one I've tried so far and I'll be sticking with this recipe from now on.  Thanks for sharing it.

OUTSTANDING!  The first time I made it, I made a half-batch (just in case), but that was totally unneccessary!  The first person who tried it actually asked how much I was selling it for - he thought it was that good!

I forgot to buy the light cream (oops!) but substituted the equivalent in 2% milk, and it still tasted great and was still about the right consistency.

Chose not to add the alcohol, either, but added 2 tsp. rum extract/flavoring and that seemed to work well, too!  Overall, a fantastic recipe... will be making this a lot, I can tell!

This is wonderful and I don't even like eggnog that much!  I think my sister in law would have drank the whole thing if we had let her!  We did serve the rum on the side for those  who wanted and those that didn't.  This will become a holiday tradition around our house.

'Tis (almost) the season, and this is a REALLY good nog recipe! Think I made about 30 batches for various holiday parties last year, and even though it's only October I already have people asking me if I'm making the eggnog again this year. I usually make 2 batches...One exactly as posted and one with a bit less rum for the lightweights in the crowd. Both turn out really good. Thanks for sharing!

I can't believe my first attempt at eggnog was this delicious! It was a hit at my Christmas party. It definitely needed the amount called for the rum...if not more. It's a definite keeper!

My whole family loved it.  We didn't add the rum and I used half and half for the whole thing.  We'll definately make it next year!

This eggnog was wonderful.  Thick, Creamy with awesome flavor.  I omitted the rum and it was very good.  I used a hand mixer instead of a wisk tho.  I also used a slotted spoon to take out the cloves.  Yes it does take longer than the quick recipes but it is well worth the time.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe NATALEESMOM!

This is amazing. I've made this twice and, I have to say when the recipe says "DO NOT BOIL", do not boil! The first batch didn't boil, was cooked very slowly and came out delightfully. The second batch, well I walked away, and it boiled. Though it was still very good, the mixture curdled (gotta love those blenders!) and just generally didn't taste as good. This is a *definite* keeper. Thanks!

I made this recipe for my family's christmas eve party. I had to double it because we had so many people. I added 2 cups of rum for the doubled recipe and it worked out really well. I'd imagine that it'd be really strong if I followed the recipe exactly. This was a huge hit with my family. It tasted like rice pudding in a glass and definitely much better than the store bought stuff that we usually get.  The eggnog was done before dessert was even served. I will absolutely be making this again!

I made this for an open house I had. I am not really that fond of eggnog nor is my husband,but we were having a very large Christmas party and I thought it might be a nice touch for those that like it at this time of year. Tip: eggs separate easily if they are room temp when you do it. I doubled the recipe but cut back on 2 yolks. I used a combination of cream, 1/2 & 1/2 and Organic whole milk. Organic milk tastes VERY creamy all by itself. My kids don't like it because I bought the "cream" milk again. I have to by skim just to get them to drink it. So I was trying to cut the calories a little using the whole milk. I used cinnamon sticks like someone suggested and the whole cloves. I threw in extra cloves because it just didn't look like it would do anything. I wouldn't do that again. I know how to temper the hot milk with the cold eggs but in the end I ended up with somethin. Not exactly curdled, but lumpy. I strained it which was difficult because of the foam and mini curdles and the cinnamon sticked fell apart into many pieces. I put it in a blender and it all the curdles completely disappeared. It was delicious. I didn't add the rum to the batch we just added it as needed per glass. My kids iked it and my husband put what was left in his coffee the next morning. It was not thick like a smoothy but thick like heavy cream. I don't drink it in the past so I didn't know any different. I would make it again next year.

Wow - this was fantastic.  I a right now making my third batch.  The first time I cooked it for a little over three minutes.  My husband thought it was too thin, but I loved it.  So the next time I cooked for about twelve minutes.  Now I think its too thick, but my husband says its perfect.  Now I'm trying for a happy medium.  By the way, I used 2% milk, fat free half & half and splenda and I leave the rum for each person to add to their own glass.  This is way better than store-bought!

We loved this! I used Silk soy milk and soy half and half because my friend can't drink milk. I also used Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum instead of the light rum and only put in 1 1/2 cups but then we added a little more rum when we drank it. No one guessed it was made with soy instead of milk and everyone loved it.

This recipe turned out amazing.  We drank some the first night we made it but in the morning after it sat is was even more amazing!  We did make some changes as suggested by others as follows for the 12 serving recipe:  We used 8 egg yolks instead of 12, we used 2 large cinnamon sticks instead of ground and didn't discard them until we put the entire batch into the fridge overnight, we used used 1 tsp rum extract (probably will try 2 tsp next time. My husband just added rum to his individual cup and that was good too. We  cut down the sugar to about 1 1/4 cups.  We didn't use a double-boiler as some did as we have a high-quality non-stick pot which did not burn or scald the milk.  We are going to make a double batch for Christmas.

Just delicious! To suit our family, I made it sugar-free (substituting Splenda) and lactose-free (using "Lactaid" whole milk). Still used the cream, which is low in lactose. It is so great to be able to have eggnog again -- and this is much better than store-bought. I left out the rum, thinking people can add their own to suit their tastes. I accidentally overcooked the eggs a bit and they began to separate, but an immersion blender smoothed it back out. I am so pleased with the way this turned out & I'm sure it will become a family tradition.

Very nice recipe.  I made it without the rum.  I don't think I cooked it long enough, it was still milky rather than creamy; however everyone loved the flavor.  On the first day the cinnamon wasn't overpowering, but several days later it seemed more prominent.  Next time I will use cinnamon sticks for comparison.  I intend to keep this as an annual Christmas tradition.

I just joined allrecipes just so I could review this recipe and one other I tried.  This eggnog is so good!  I served it at a party last night and I should've made two batches because it was gone so fast! This tastes nothing like eggnog you buy at the grocery.  Smooth and creamy with a great blend of spices.    Definitely serve this at your holiday parties!

This is a very good eggnog recipe. A little too much cinnamon, I would cut back on that a bit. Was a success at the family Christmas party.

I have never tried eggnog before, but my boyfriend likes it. He always just buys some from the store then spikes it at home. I figured if he liked store bought then homemade HAD to be better. I am SO GLAD I chose this recipe! The boyfriend LOVED it, and I like it as well. The only changes I made from the original is that I strained it 4 times instead of 1, and I used 2 cups of Crown Royal instead of rum. It is VERY rich and so creamy. I will be making another batch for my New Years Eve party.

I thought this was a good drink, but not good eggnog. It didn't really have much of that good old fashioned eggnog flavor.  Pretty decent holiday drink, but more cinnamon or spice drink than eggnog.

I've never liked eggnog but my husband insisted on making this.  Wow, I never realized eggnog could actually taste GOOD. It was fantastic!  Just like the author says, this is nothing like store bought stuff.  We only put in 1 cup of rum and it was plenty for us.  I'd suggest starting with a little and letting it chill.  Taste and see if you like it.  You can always add more later.  It takes awhile for the rum flavor to blend in completely.  But man is this eggnog good!

Well, I know I'm going against the tide here, but I just didn't think this recipe was that great.  I found it quite bland and blah acutally.  I tried adding more cinnamon & nutmeg, but it was still lacking something - I don't know what though.

This is excellent eggnog! I made a batch to try before serving it to our Christmas guests and will definitely be adding it to my menu.  This is nothing like store bought eggnog - far superior!  Smooth creamy texture, rich flavor, all around delicious and even better the next day.

Thank you for this recipe! I will never buy eggnog again! I don't like rum, so I omitted it completely. My husband likes it less sweet, so we cut the sugar in half. Super easy to make-LOVE!

Made 2 servings.  Used half and half in place of the cream and rum.  You could reduce the sugar by 1/4.  Hubby says its the best eggnog he ever tasted.  I made it easily within 15 min. by placing the saucepan of thickened ingredients in a large bowl of ice water and then whisking it until it cooled down.

I really like this recipe. Since "light rum" was specified and I am not really sure what "light rum" is I went with Captain Morgan spice rum which is most delicious in this eggnog. I do use only 1 cup as I would rather under pour and allow guests to add more as opposed to over pouring and ruining my eggnog. Very good thanks for sharing!!

I made a small test batch to try as I have wasted alot of ingredients in the past on awful eggnog recipes. Nothing went to waste on this one as it was AWESOME!!!! I made it exactly as directed except I used agave instead of sugar and I skipped the rum because I don't drink alcohol. It tasted great but was a little too sweet and too 'clove'ey...lol..So...next time I will cut the sugar and cut the cloves to suit my families taste. This recipe with alterations is a keeper for us...thanks for the recipe.

We live in England and can't get eggnog-- we love this!  I do leave out the rum and that leaves ] a bit more thick. Also, I am able to make eggnog latte or add it to my coffee.

I have made this recipe the last two Christmases. We love it! It has become tradition for our Christmas Eve. After the kids are in bed, we enjoy this eggnog, while waiting for "santa".

I had been lookin or a good homemade eggnog recipe for years. Tried a few with little success.
Found this one and WOW its great, and easy as well. I am lactose challenged so regular eggnog does not sit well with me, so I substituted the milk with Lactaide and it worked great, everyone loved it.

This was AMAZING!!  I halved the recipe since it was for only 4 of us and ended up regretting it.  I did also end up using only about half a cup of rum, and it was perfect (and I'm someone who likes a strong drink).

It's also imperative that you make this in advance in order to refrigerate it overnight.  I nearly threw it out when I tasted it before putting it in the fridge, but the next night it was wonderful.

Amazingly good. I scaled it down for4 people. I used 1 1/2 cups of milk, and 1 packet (1 cup) of cream and two eggs. Followed the process. Really good. I was craving for it for days after..

My sister and I have made this for years and loved it, but always hated how you had cinnamon dregs at the bottom. This year I decided to try using two cinnamon sticks instead - and it was brilliant! A much more even flavor throughout, and no dregs. USE CINNAMON STICKS!

ps. As a side note, I also occasionally make this lactose free since my husband can't drink the regular stuff. Just replace the milk and the light cream with whole milk Lactaid. (You'll want to use only whole to maintain the thickness.) It turns out fabulously.

I've made this twice now. Both times I used all half and half instead of milk and half and half. Absolutely fabulous. The only reason I use the cream instead of milk is our family likes our nog very thick. This is hands down the best nog we've ever had. You will never buy store bought again.

She's right.  I'll never buy store bought eggnog again!!  This recipe tastes exactly like the most expensive brands of eggnog.  I left out the rum so my kids can partake, and we just add it in to taste.  This recipe is pitch perfect--don't change a thing!

Tastes nothing like store bought eggnog, and that's a good thing.  I don't really care for eggnog from the store, but I am having a Christmas dessert party, and decided to give this a try.  It is amazing.  I did not add the rum, instead leaving it for people to add themselves.  This is perfect for holiday parties, and it was very simple to make.

Excellent! I have made 4 gallons (yes gallons!) this year for different events and it came out great! This recipe is very forgiving. You can adjust the sweetness as you need to. I also omitted the alcohol as we are serving to kids :) If you have a high power blender (like a Vitamix) you can put it in there (if it gets a little clumpy) and blend it together. I do it every time, I don't strain it, I just put it in my Vitamix to whip it all together and it comes out smooth and great!

Another thing I do is to substitute the milk for some heavy cream or half and half or if you want a lighter nog then use skim milk. I have used this recipe for the last three years and will always use it! I quit buying eggnog!

My family loved it! Thank you. We don't drink alcohol, so we omitted it and added a touch of rum flavoring. It was wonderfully thick and tasty without it! We couldn't guzzle it down, so we enjoyed it more that way. Everyone that tried it loved it. It tasted fresh compared to the commercial stuff. Making eggnog has become a new tradition for us. It was pretty simple to make too!

This eggnog is just the best! I'm from Belgium and eggnog is not known in our country but it is too good not to have it available. And now we can make our own, it's even better.

Fantastic recipe when it's done right.  Make sure not to get make the milk mixture too hot after you've added the eggs, otherwise it'll get a little... chunky.  And use clean dishes whenever possible.

Not a favorite in our house...made it per the recipe.  If I try it again I will omit the cinnamon, cut the vanilla by at least half, and some of the clove.  Was just to "spicy".  Liked the consistency though.  I did omit the rum, why ruin rum with eggnog?

ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! Followed the directions exactly as written until I got to the end. Instead of the 4 c light cream I used 2 c heavy whipping cream and 2 c half and half. Followed some other advice here and did NOT add the rum. My 16 yr old son who has hated egnog all of his life LOVES this! We will be making this again and again. Excellent way to use up some of the fresh eggs the hens have been laying.

i havent had egg nog before and i was excited to try this recipe, esp. since the eggs are cooked.  excellent excellent excellent!  tasted kinda like pumpkin pie.  i used half and half instead of light cream and people added the bourbon to their taste.  my kids licked this up.  may be good with amaretto too.  i did use a hand blender stick with this to make it smooth - highly suggest doing this.  great egg nog for nondrinkers and drinkers alike.  thank you - i am adding this to the yearly christmas tradition.

I substituted 1/2 t. ground cloves for the 5 whole cloves.  Straining is still a good idea if you want to get rid of possible clumps.  I added all the vanilla and nutmeg after cooking and before cooling.  I was worried about the vanilla cooking out and wanted the nutmeg the most time to meld with the other flavors.  I omited the alcohol this time and used half & half for the light cream.  I cooked a little longer than 3 min just to be safe (still not boiled).

Amazingly good it is! I've used this recipe for the last 2 years! Since I live in Germany it's hard to find eggnog. My family and I love it! I leave out the rum and use less sugar. It really is very, very delicious!

My grandmothers recipe is almost impossible to beat but it is old school and uses raw eggs (which as long as you wash the shell, I’m ok with). I really like this -- only changes I will make is using ground cloves (1 teaspoon) and Amaretto instead of rum.. sweeter, softer, easier flavor to handle with still a nice kick.

very good ,if you like eggnog (I don't, but everyone at my party did.) i used fat free half and half instead of the cream to lighten it up and lessen the calorie count a bit, and the taste was still great. spiced rum goes very well in it.

thank you sooooo much for perfecting this recipe all those years AND even more so for sharing it with us.  Living in the Netherlands I wanted to share this specific flavor with my family and this recipe appealed to me for it seemed (and is!) easy to make.  I just finished making half of the recipe as a trial without rum simly cause I dont like the taste of alcohol and dont allow my kids to drink yet.  When christmas is here I'll have a bottle of rum on the table so people can spike it to there own taste!  Thanks again Nataliesmom!!

I've made this eggnog every Christmas for the last 3 years, & it's excellent!  Serve it to those who say they don't like eggnog & see what happens.

This took forever to make, but was incredible! I had to make a few substitutions, but nothing that should really change the flavor. I can't find light cream, so I used 2 cups of heavy cream and 2 cups of 1/2 & 1/2. I thought I had whole cloves, but in the middle of measuring ingredients (at 10 pm), found out I only had ground. So I Googled how much to use and I think we ended up with about 1/2 tsp of ground cloves (we errored on the side of caution). I left out the vanilla (which was a total accident brought on by being too tired), and served the alcohol on the side because there were children drinking it. All in all, it would be worth making again, but only for a special gathering/get together. It was too much work to make just for the heck of it!

Great Recipe. I like things sweet so I added almost a whole can of condense milk. Delicious. I will experiment with the alcohols though. This combination of liquors had me feeling super relaxed like I just wanted to get in bed and end my night. I will have to find out which liquor had me feeling that way and reduce that liquor while adding back more of another.

I normally do not like store bought eggnog, so I thought I'd try it homemade. It was creamy and delicious. We don't drink, so just omitted the rum and kept everything else the same. I wonder if I could replace the light cream with whole milk for a lower fat version - I may give that a try.  I made 6 servings yesterday and let it ripen overnight. I opened up the fridge this morning to just 1 serving.  My husband got into it beforehand - I guess he really liked it too!

this eggnog is awesome. my husband LOVES eggnog and after trying this recipe (things i did differently--left out the rum, cloves, and nutmeg because i didn't have any; replaced the nutmeg with ground ginger--diviiiiine) and him gulping it ALL down and asking for more, i was out of white sugar. so, i tried an eggnog recipe using brown sugar from a paula deen cookbook...yours is better by far. i will definitely be using this recipe to make my eggnog from now on. the only thing i will change is to cut back on the sugar and vanilla  some, because although it does taste good i couldn't drink very much due to the sweetness, and the vanilla taste is overpowering. and i couldn't imagine drinking something so sweet with liquor in it. but anyways a fabulous recipe, do yourself a favor and TRY THIS!

This eggnog is truly amazingly good! =) It's a little less sweet than what you can buy, but this has a fuller flavor, which I like better.  Because we have children in the house, I omitted the rum, but it's available and adults can add it if they choose.  This one goes into my "best recipes " collection!

This was my first try at homemade eggnog and was a total success!  I made one change though, neither me or my husband is fond of rum so we used Southern Comfort instead.  It really is amazingly good.  Will make again and again. I served it with homemade whipped cream and nutmeg on top.

GREAT! Even better then I thought it would be and not difficult at all...BUT the "cook for 3 minutes or until thick" took a LOT longer then 3 minutes. My husband says his arm is about to fall off! Well worth it though. I will make this every Christmas Eve now! Thanks for the post!

Fabulous recipe! I didn't change any of the ingredients, however I did change some of the prep steps. I put the milk mixture on the stove for 5 minutes on low, 2 minutes on the next setting and 2 more minutes on level 3 (electric stove). While that was warming I mixed the egg yolks and sugar. I went back to the milk mixture and strained out the cloves (not a huge fan of them). I added the egg yolk mixture directly into the pot the milk mixture was in and whisked it together. Since the milk mixture wasn't too warm nothing curdled or chunked up when I mixed the two together. I stirred constantly for about 25-35 min while the mixture was thickening. After it thickened, removed it from the stove (left it in the pot to cool) and whisked it every 5 min to avoid clumping (and it helps the mixture to cool faster). Added rest of ingredients, minus rum. Will add that as requested. Tasted eggnog prior to refrigerating and it is delicious! Thank you Nataliesmom! Happy Holidays!

Read as many of the reviews of this as you have time for..two things that readers said actually worked for this recipe are true: 1) if your milk curdles put the mixture in the blender - it curdled, I blended, voila! eggnog is back in business! and 2) use a double-boiler for the milk mixture to begin with. It won't scald if at all and you can control how quickly it will get to boil. I've got an hour before adding the last of the ingredients. I'm using half and half and heavy cream. Will let you know how it turns out!

I made this last year for Christmas dinner with the whole family. I left out the rum so the little ones could enjoy it to. This was sooooo good. Everyone loved it! I will definately be making this each year for Christmas dinner. The recipe was perfect and I did not need to make any changes! Thanks so much for sharing!

AWESOME! i want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for this recipe. my mother is dying from cancer and loves eggnog. you can't buy it after the holidays, so i needed a recipe and this one is wonderful. the 1st time i made it i used half & half (left out the alcohol)but next time i will use a heavier cream for the fat content as she needs to gain weight. i even love it and i don't even like eggnog. if you like eggnog this is the recipe for you. i plan to make this for holidays this year.

I was nervous about how this would turn out.  I followed instructions to the T with the exception of using less rum.  I used 1 1/2 cups of Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum and the taste turned out above my expectations.  The only thing I would say went a little wrong was that I was nervous that I would make it boil so I think I took it off the stove before it was at maximum thickness so it is a little runnier than I had hoped for but that was probably my mistake and not the recipes.  Overall...it is great...will see how it goes over on Christmas day!

Thank you for this wonderful recipe! I followed the instructions precisely and it's fabulous! At my holiday party I set up a fully stocked bar in addition to the eggnog and only two people out of 25 drank anything other than the nog. I got tons of kudos for it, too!

This made a wonderful eggnog! So thick and creamy! I used Splenda instead of sugar and i used 2 C of half and half and 2 C of cream to lighten it up slightly. It was quite heavy on the rum, so I think I might actually make it without next time and if people want to add rum to it, they can. I will make it again, for sure! I love that it turned out even without sugar- I have yet to find sugar-free eggnog in the stores. Fantastic! Thank you!

We loved this eggnog! It was well worth the work. We are big drinkers in my family and even we thought it was kind of strong. So next time I'll cut back on the rum:)Thanks for the great recipe, I'll never buy the stuff you find at the grocery store again.

This was the BEST egg nog I've ever had!!! It was soooo easy to make. I halved it for my test run and I wish I hadn't of! My bestfriend and I spent the day "sampling" the 'nog! I was expecting it to be difficult to make but it really was a snap. Nice and thick, absolutely beautiful. We tried some over ice and it was gorgeous. I am an Aussie and we don't have egg nog here but I am moving to the USA soon and atleast I've got one traditional christmas thing to make under my belt! Thanks Natalies Mom!!! Merry Christmas!

This is head and shoulders above anything you could buy in a store!  I hate store-bought eggnog, makes me gag.  But I loved this recipe!!

Made this for Boxing day and everyone loved it. I used less rum and let people top their drinks up if they wanted, which a couple did. Next time I will use cinnamon sticks as I sieved this eggnog through muslin and it still had too much cinnamon floating around before finally settling at the bottom of everyones glass! excellent taste.

This was suberb. I made a hugh batch for Christmas and then split it, making one batch non-alcoholic and the other batch with Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum. Many, many compliments. Thanks.

Wonderful egg nog and easy to make! Even family members who don't usually like eggnog enjoyed this recipe. Next time I will probably use a tad less rum but great overall!

This was good but NOT great, in light of the effort and ingredients. It was a bit too rich for my tastebuds. My daughter, who begs for eggnog during the holidays, didn't like it. Of course, she was raised on store bought.

I'm not an eggnog drinker and I loved it.  My son loves eggnog and he said it's the best he's had.  I pretty much made it as directed except I didn't have any cloves, and used allspice berries instead.  I also just used more milk instead of cream to make it a little more healthy (ha ha!)My son drank it like that and I just added rum to my glass as needed.  If you are going to make it without rum, drop the sugar back a bit.  I found it plenty sweet if you weren't adding that in.  As written, it's fabulous!

Good, but it doesn't taste anything like store bought. I'm not sure if that's a good thing. In all fairness, I took the suggestion not to use the full 12 egg yolks and stopped at 10 and I found that it just wasn't quite eggy enough. I also think that it could use more spice, but my spices are probably not the freshest. Important to note: The rum is important. Without it, was a bit bland. I think if I had rum extract or flavouring, to make a non-alcholic version, it would be better. Once the rum was added it was quite tasty. (Also used cup for cup Splenda in place of sugar.)

I couldn't imagine I'd get so many compliments! Many people (including myself) said they don't usually like egg nog, but this is fantastic. I used 1% milk, and substitued more milk for the rum so the ladies who are expecting could enjoy. It took longer than the quoted time, but it was well worth it.

Yikes @ the rum!!  And I'm a rum drinker and thought it was too strong!  Aside from that the recipe is good, more involved than my mom's old recipe (which by the way DID use raw eggs and nobody ever got sick), she just threw everything in the blender.  It was the best!

Excellent taste and a creamy consistency. I really like the fact that it's cooked too. I used spiced rum and fat free half and half. Fantastic.

The flavor was good but the consistancy was too thin.  For those of us who are used to the creamy store-bought variety of eggnog, I definitely recommend using heavy cream instead of light.  It's worth making again with the alteration...thanks for there recipe.

I made it exactly as the recipe stated, didn't change a thing and I thought it was the worst eggnog I've ever tasted sorry! I was so happy I found this recipe since I am in the UK from canada and can't seem to find it in any of the shops. I was dissapointed, I gave it three stars because one out of four of us liked it. Thank you for the recipe anyway.

I would definitely make this again.  The only thing I would change is to cut back on the amount of cinnamon.  Also, I didn't have whole cloves, so I added a pinch of ground cloves and it turned out fine.  I don't have a double-broiler, so I was overly cautious while boiling the milk and then cooking it with the egg mixture.  It never did reach a boil, but I was afraid to cook it too long so I stopped after five minutes.  Seemed to work out fine anyway.  Thanks for the recipe!

The name says it all.  Not too difficult to make if you're the type who would much rather do things from scratch.  Two things that I particularly like about this recipe:  1) the eggs are cooked and 2) it can be made a day ahead.  I made it on Christmas Eve morning and we enjoyed it on Christmas day.  I even had some leftover the following day and it was wonderful.

I, too, will never buy store-bought eggnog again!  This was sooooo good!  I made it on Dec. 23 so it would be ready for Christmas Eve.  I omitted the rum and kept it on the side for the adults to add.  The entire family LOVED it....even our 12-year-old son who can be so picky.  I now have a new family tradition!  Thanks!!

Shockingly good!!! I myself was scared to taste it. I didn't have any cloves so I substituted ground cloves (looked up the ratio). Once I sampled it, everyone started trying it. Before I knew it, all of it was GONE!!!

I like my raw egg recipe better. I wanted to try this because I like the idea of making it in advance. Oddly, to me it tasted a very much like store bought except not as sweet. My guests liked it ok although there were leftovers, and with my traditional recipe, I usually have to make another batch.

Best nog Ive ever had , but I made a few mods, though 

Excluded the cloves 

Went with half the Liquor that was called for , except in stead of just rum I went with Rum and Bourbon

This unseated the eggnog I used to make with Vanilla Ice cream, (Aka Noggen Dasz) as everyones favorite nog

AMAZINGLY good is right!  I don't even drink eggnog and it was delicious!  Made it for a Christmas party and was so much better then I thought it would be.  Did take note about how strong it was..so I did 2 cups of rum instead of 2.5cups.  Added candy canes to be use with the drink and it was perfect as a stirring stick and tastes yummie with the drink.

For me and my family this recipe is a must every Christmas.
I use a good bourbon instead of the rum, but I guess that is up to your personal taste. 
I usually fix it up the day before Christmas Eve and if you boil the egg mixture and keep the eggnog cold you can still drink it the 2nd day of Christmas. It will get even better.

One batch is not enough! I made this eggnog for Thanksgiving and it was gone within 1/2 hour. Will triple recipe for Christmas. Only change I made was I used Sailor Jerry spiced rum instead of light rum. Delicious!!

I followed this recipe almost exactly.  The major change I made was the alcohol.  I used brandy, instead of rum, since it has a sweet, smooth, warm flavor.  I also cut the amount down by 1 cup - and I'm glad I did, or even the brandy would have been overwhelming!  Very yummy!

After reading the reviews, I decided to temper the eggs with the hot milk. I also used 3 cups of half and half with 1 cup filtered water. I also added a few cardamom pods along with the spices. Next time I'll add some star anise, too.  Served it non-alcoholic with a choice of Myer's dark rum, Sailor Jerry spiced rum, or brandy. Everyone loved it!

It was the best I've ever had and an easy recipe for my first time making eggnog. I'll definitely make it again. Thank you for the recipe, this made my holidays!

WOW!! This turned out incredibly tasty.  My stove sucks so the milk never boiled, even after 2 hours, so I tempered the eggs with the very hot milk and then cooked the eggnog on the stove top, again it never really thickened. My only change was adding a dash of cardamon.  I served it Christmas Eve and everyone agreed it was incredible! I may never buy eggnog again!

I have always hated egg nog. I like this. I whipped the egg whites to peaks and added to the egg nog and used heavy cream because that is how my grandmother made it.  I did not add the rum and replaced the cloves with all-spice.  I used a thermometer when cooking the milk-yolks  mix so the temp would not get above 165 F.

I made this eggnog for my Christmas party this past weekend. It was easy to make and the hit of the party! 

I served the alcohol on the side as this allows everyone, including the children, to try it and guests can add as much or little as they would like.

Absolutely delicious!!  Give it a day to age and the rum won't overwhelm, honest!  I use Captain Morgans and use only whole milk to cut down on the calories and fat and it is still absolutely incredible.  We are pretty much non-drinkers here but this is sweet (but not cloyingly sweet), smooth and absolutely yummy!!  We discovered this recipe last year and it will be an integral part of our Christmas season from now on.

Great recipe!!! I so love store bought eggnog, but am cutting back on fat.........So, I used this recipe & put in 2% milk & fat free half & half. It was still good. Not as good as the real recipe, but I'll sure be happy with it.

This egg nog is very good.  I prefer more spices and less sugar. I also did not put any run.  But we all enjoyed it very much.  It is very important that the milk boil before you begin to add it to the egg mixture.

This was GREAT with a few changes. I left out the rum just because I didn't have any on hand and used ground cloves instead. I also substituted evaporated milk in place of the light cream. Everyone loved it!

I don't drink eggnog but my kids love it.  I'm giving this a 3 star mainly because they like store eggnog better but they're kids.  Didn't want to rate down for their opinion.  :-)

This recipe is near perfect. I have made it for 3+ years in a row around Thanksgiving and Christmastime and it is always a revelation. I make it pretty much exactly according to the recipe (one of the few recipes I don't have to cut down the sugar), EXCEPT I add just 3/4 c. rum rather than 2 1/2 c. I think it's important to add a little rum because it adds to the complexity of flavor. So awesome - will be making again and again for years to come, God willing.

I will admit this is a very good recipe however I would advise using less rum. I'm sorry but it totally overpowers the taste of the eggnog. Although my husbands begs to differ.

FANTASTIC!!! Absolutely fantastic!  Got rave reviews from EVERYONE who tasted it...even people who thought they didn't like eggnog!  Left out the rum to keep it "family-friendly" and let people add it if they wanted to.  Didn't need it, though. I will make this EVERY year without a doubt!!! Thank you for sharing, Natalie's mom!!!

I don't even know where to begin. This eggnog is amazingly simple and tasty. We will no longer be purchasing eggnog. My whole family loves this. I did use less sugar (just one cup) and it's still yummy. Thanks!

Made this for the first time this Thanksgiving. Like the flavor, but the vanilla is too overpowering, almost like I'm drinking a vanilla milkshake (I left out the rum). Next time I will cut back on the vanilla and increase the other spices to see what that does.  Also had some curdling issues but resolved them by mixing on high speed while on ice water (thanks to one of the reviewers here for the tip!). Will try au bain marie next time.  All in all a good recipe, but needs some adjustment to suit my taste.

This is great! Used our own fresh eggs, 2% milk and no rum. Best egg nog I have ever tasted. Did not have cloves, so subbed pumpkin pie spice. Threw it all in the blender. Great in coffee, too.

Very good eggnog.  I left out the liquor so that we could add our own as desired.  After experimenting, I found Appleton (Jamaican) dark rum to be delicious with this eggnog.

Made this again in 2014 and added the liquor in when I made it, yum! Adjusted recipe to yield 10 servings with the following additional adjustments: cut sugar to 1 Cup and used 11 Ounces of dark rum. Could not find light cream, so substituted half & half and heavy cream(2 C heavy and 1 C H&H). Let sit overnight and it was fantastic Christmas morning. I would recommend 9-10 ounces of rum if you want a little less liquor taste, and no more than 11 ounces for a 10 serving batch. I will use 11 ounces again as everyone thought it was perfect.

WOW---I made this on Christmas Eve (1/2 a batch) for my DH and myself---this is just awesome.  I normally buy my eggnog but find that every year it becomes more and more expensive; this is a great alternative and tastes so much better.  I followed the recipe exactly for a serving of 6 but only used a 1/2 cup of rum which I feel was more than enough for us.  I didn't make enough for everyone this year--and I refused to share---so I'm hoping that next year I can surprise everyone with this superb eggnog!  Tahnk you for sharing.....this will be my go to recipe for eggnog from now on.....yummy!

This is a very rich, creamy egg nog. The recipe was easy to follow. I used fresh vanilla seeds rather than vanilla extract, which worked fine, and put in more nutmeg than the recipe called for to get a nice spicey flavour. The rum, however, is a little overpowering! I'd suggest using about 3/4 or 1/2 of the stated amount if you don't want your socks blown off!

Great taste, but not thick at all. I left out the rum and let people add their own so I can't speak to whether o not 2 1/2 cups was too much or not. Also, I kept the egg whites and beat them until meringue-like and then folded it in to increase thickness. You could do the same with the cream if you don't want to add raw egg whites.

I used one vanilla bean instead of extract, only 8 eggs, and heavy whipping cream because I couldn't fine light, added 1/2 cup more sugar and didn't use any alcohol. This is the best eggnog me and the family have ever tried!

This came out quite delicious!  I used skim milk and cream and it still came out a little creamy and thick for our taste.  The flavor is wonderful though!  Next time I'll use half and half instead of cream and I'll probably end up mixing in a little more skim milk to thin out this batch a little.  That's just personal preference, though.  This recipe is well worth the effort for the great taste!  I've made plenty of puddings and custards, so I didn't have any trouble adding hot milk to eggs and then back again (no scrambled egg bits).  I also left out the cloves since my son is allergic to them and didn't add any run because we don't drink (the rum might help to dilute the egg nog a bit without using half and half or more milk though).

I thought this was delicious and others did as well. It tasted like gingerbread. Mu husband thought it was too runny and cinnamon-y. It definitely took longer to prepare than 20 minutes... I did double the recipe, but I don't think that should have doubled the prep time!

Excellent, though I found that I needed only half the amount of rum.  It sure packs a punch, with the full amount, I'd be on the floor!  LOL!  Ran out of cream and used condensed milk instead..delish!

It really IS amazing eggnog. It tastes just like my favourite store-bought kind, if not better. No one in my family drinks alcohol, so to get the flavour I substituted 2 tsp rum extract instead of actual rum. Also, I used half a vanilla bean split lengthwise when I first made the milk-and-egg mixture to get that beautiful speckle I'm so used to. I did add 2 tsp of extract when I mixed in the cream though. Thank you for an amazing recipe! I hope this helps anyone that wants the rum flavour but doesn't want the alcohol.

I've made this twice, and all I can say is WOW!  I never liked store bought eggnog, but I made this for my husband, and to test out for a Christmas party I will be hosting in a few weeks.  I've drank most of it myself.  The only thing I plan on changing is the rum, I tried 2 cups the second time, and it was still a little boozy for me, and most of the guests.  So I'll be aiming for about 1 1/2 cups on the next attempt.  It's worth the effort, and it's almost no effort at all!

I wasn't sure what light cream was, so we used regular whipping cream.  It was way to thick and I had to thin it with more milk.  Next time I will use half and half.  I also halved the Rum.  Otherwise, yummy!

The name says it all.  AMAZINGLY GOOD!  I made this for our family Christmas party and everybody loved it.  To make the eggnog kid-friendly I used 2 tsp. of rum flavoring and omitted the rum.  This still gave it the great rum flavor, but without the alcohol.  My mom said that it was way better than store bought eggnog and I would have to say that she is definitely right!

This was my first attempt at homemade eggnog and it was awesome.  Like another reviewer, I saved half the egg whites, beat them until stiff peaks formed and then stirred that into the mixture.  I skipped the rum completely and used ground cloves instead of whole cloves.  It was a hit and I look forward to my next batch.

This is the best Egg Nog recipe I have found yet.  The best prep method too, most other ones I've tried mixed the milk and egg to start which made it twice as hard to not heat it too quickly.  It was a little sweet for my taste so I might drop a third of the sugar next time.  Going by the recipe  this is some great stuff.

This was a lot of work.  I haven't actually had eggnog for about two years because I live in South Africa.  I have to say that it does taste very good.  I didn't add any rum because I don't like the taste of rum but it's still good.  Very rich though so I drink about 2/3 eggnog and 1/3 milk.  It doesn't taste exactly like I remember eggnog tasting but it's still delicious.

This turned out really well.  I like the flavor and texture.  Next time i make it i will use vitamin D milk instead of skim milk.  I think that would help to make it a little thicker.  I will definately make this again.

This was delicious.  I used 10% cream instead of heavy cream, and used a combination of cinnamon and cinnamon sticks.  A big hit, and added all the rum, although I was skeptical, and it was perfect.  Will make it every year.

Left ou the rum, so it was more sweet than most eggnog. I found a few drops of rum extract gave it a nice flavor though. I only had heavy whipping cream, so I only added two cups of that and replaced the rest with regular milk and it was still sooo thick and creamy! Added a dash more of nutmeg, also replaced the whole cloves with a tablespoon of ground cloves. The key is not to cook this too fast or too long. I ended up finding some traces of curdled bits so I whisked it virgorously and then ran it through a seive. Wonderful, festive recipe!

This truly was wonderful.  I love the way the egg is cooked so you don't have to worry about Salmonella.  I actually cut the batch in half just before I added the rum so as my kids could enjoy it too.  I then cut the rum in half.  All worked out well.

This eggnog is great, I made this twice.  Once without alcohol and once with.  We felt that with had too much alcohol so we put in the other batch of eggnog and it was perfect.  I would recommend cutting the alcohol to one cup.

Awesome recipe!  I had no problems with curdling, I think you need to go extra slow pouring the hot milk into the egg mixture.  I would also recommend dark rum - I only had 350mls and having tasted it wouldn't recommend adding any more, it was just perfect.  I've spent the past three Christmases in England and have sorely missed egg nog.  This recipe was such a success and made my Christmas day!

This turned out great! It took way longer than 5 minutes to get to boil in the first step - I was afraid to turn it up too much though. MAKE sure you stir constantly during the 2nd step and take it off before any boiling is detected.  Everyone at the Christmas party loved it!  Don't think about your arteries or thighs though!

This recipe was easier than expected after reading the reviews.  A few minor changes I made:
I used ground nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon and cardamom instead of the whole cloves (I was out of them) in the milk.
I used 1 1/2 cups of Southern Comfort (42 proof, not 80) and 1 cup of light rum.

I still strained the custard through a seive, both before and after cooling.  Made it really smooth as there were some very small pieces of membrane in the custard.

My husband is a huge fan of any egg nog and making this for him was part of his Christmas gift.  I think it will be a tradition from now on!  Thanks "Nataliesmom"!
Happy Holidays!

Excellent Nog! Store bought nog is too syrupy and sweet for my taste.  I decreased the sugar by 1/4 cup and only used 1 cup of rum.  The milk did not come to a boil in my doubleboiler so after 30 minutes of stirring I warmed and added the yolks.  After refrigerating overnight I noticed a slight grainy texture, likely the eggs curdled a little, so I took another reviewer's suggestion and ran the whole batch through the blender - it came out very smooth.  I used 2 cinnamon sticks rather than ground, will probably use 3 next time.  Overall I was very pleased and my co-workers have already asked if I could bring more next week.

Made twice.  First time was a little thick because I cooked it for about 20  minutes. When making again I was sure to not cook it longer than 15 minutes.  Took the advice and used half & half rather than hvy cream.  Was a hit among everyone at our party. Enjoy!

This recipe ... wow!  Rich, flavourful.  And I like the fact the eggs are cooked (I was pregnant at the time I originally found this, and personally required cooked eggs)! I've made it numerous times since over the years, and have changed nothing (besides not adding the rum. I keep the rum on the side for those that want it).
I was originally hoping for something simular to the store bought stuff.  IF that's what you're looking for, this is not it! It's better!  And while it has a different enough taste to be unique, you still recognize it as egg nog (however, if you use all milk, and no cream, it is closer to store bought).
For the dairy intolerant, I can attest regular Silk Soy milk (sub for milk and cream) does very well as a substitute (haven't tried other brands). Tastes like normal Egg Nog when finished (important for those in the house that couldn't drink dairy).
My husband hates egg nog (store bought).  He calls it "Chicken Milk".  But he likes this one - in small dosages, but still, he likes it.
I really liked this.  Definitly a keeper.  I can't wait to serve it to my guests for Christmas!  :)  Thank you!

Perfect!  Yum!!!  It ran out so fast that I have to make it again for everyone! I have tried other recipes only to be frustrated and buy it again at the store.  This one is better than the store eggnog in texture and flavor.  Thanks for the trial & error to come up with this great recipe!  This time I am going to try part of it using splenda and see how it turns out.

Wonderful! my husband is an egg nog fanatic & absolutely loved this recipe!  We omitted the rum and it was still fabulous!  We haven't found it in France & being able to make egg nog that is even better than the store bought kind simply made our first christmas overseas!  thanks!

I have made this eggnog several times and I highly recommend cutting the sugar. ~2/3rd of a cup. 
A lot of people are complaining about having the milk curdle (gross). Milk curdles because of a drop in PH, do not add the rum until after the cream and do not skimp on the fat, 3.25% milk and minimum 15% cream.
Enjoy!

This was my first time making eggnog so I decided to halve the recipe just incase I didn't like it. I also only added 1/2 cup of rum as most of the negative reviews were about the rum being too much. 

The rum taste was just enough for me personally although my husband added more to his. We really enjoyed it and will definitely be making it again!

I liked that it wasn't as rich as store-bought eggnog. I found it a bit sweet for my taste, but I prefer my desserts less sweet anyway. I heated it too much and it curdled, but i put it in the blender for a few seconds (while still hot) and it became smooth again. I left out the rum because not everyone in our house drinks and we still enjoyed it.

Let me start by saying, I've NEVER liked eggnog. But last year for Xmas I wanted to make something different with some booze in it. Found this recipe and, OH. MY. GOD. This was so good. Made a batch with the rum (used 3 cups because, party!) And a batch without rum for the lames. Both were really, really delicious! Making it again this year for Turkey day and Xmas! It's that good. It's super rich so you'll probably use this as a holiday meal replacement. But that's OK. It's worth it.
Would like to add, I'm not the best chef. Not even close. And even I didn't screw this up. Not as scary with the milk/scorch/egg stuff as it sounds.

I've made this several times over the past three years now.  Delicious and always gets rave reviews from others.  I have tailored my version slightly to meet our preferences: primarily this is much too sweet for us, as written, and so I only use 1/2 cup sugar instead of 1 1/2 cups!  The other changes I make are to use 2 cups milk and 2 cups heavy cream, instead of 4 cups light cream (just because it's what I have on hand usually), and omit the rum entirely.

Another note: accidentally curdle the eggs?  Just run it through the blender and proceed.  Works great!  Ask me how I know...

Been making this eggnog for about 10 years and everyone who drinks it, LOVES it. I use heavy whipping cream and half and half so it isn’t too heavy/thick. I also add Sailor Jerry’s Spiced rum 1/4 cup at a time until I get the desired taste. Make sure when heating up the milk, you keep stirring. It needs to be on med low NOT the lowest heat setting or else you will be waiting A LONG time for it to heat up. I use 6 cloves. That’s it! MAKE THIS and you will be so glad you did.

Good recipe!  Be careful when pouring milk mixture into the egg mixture or else you will end up with sweet scrambled eggs. Pour slow and be sure to have a large enough pan.

This eggnog is perfect as written! I have made it twice already, and on the second try, I halved the eggs, and sugar, and used skim milk in place of the cream for a lighter version. It was also divine. Equally thick, but not as rich. I used Jack Daniel's whisky, topped it with a bit of whipped cream, and was the perfect amount of tipsy! Thanks for uploading this lovely recipe! :)

This stuff is good!  I'm not a big eggnog drinker but wowza this was amazing.  I made it for my husband who LOVES eggnog around Christmas time.  He was so excited for me to make it. Well he already finished it off! He said this was the best eggnog he's ever had! I discouraged the store bought junk and made it using organic ingredients and cage free organic eggs as well. Boy oh boy is there a difference.  I halved the recipe to 6 servings since it was just for him and it filled a large mason jar perfectly to the top. I couldn't find light cream so I used 1 cup whole milk and 1 cup heavy cream and it came out delicious.  As another reviewer said,  when cooking it just keep on medium heat and stir constantly,  it won't burn. It does need to be like a pumpkin pie batter, it took mine about 10mins to get there.  Don't worry about the bubbles,  if they keep forming then turn down the heat a tad bit. After I let it sit in the fridge it was so perfect,  it was rich and smoothe tasting.  Oh and don't be stingy on the vanilla extract! My husband is already asking me to make more! Oh as soon as he tried it he immediately called his mother bragging about it haha! I knew I must've done something right then!

Us south africans are not big on eggnog. But I always wanted to try it. So I made this recipe the first time about 2 years ago. And every year the family, friends, every one I know asks for it again and again. And one batch is not enough for every gathering. I'm already at 3 batches for every gathering. Everyone loves it!

My 16 year old son wanted eggnog at 9:00pm one night. I jokingly said "go make some". He found this recipe online. He used 1 teaspoon of ground clove instead of whole and only had 2 cups of light cream. He also left out the rum. He's never cooked before and even tempered the eggs correctly. It was delicious but too thick for him and he didn't want to drink it. I didn't want it to go to waste so we made ice cream out of it. Best eggnog ice cream I have ever had.

Nothing to complain about, I really liked this eggnog. My eggs did not curdle. It's because my eggs were at room temp before I added the hot milk mixture, or because I added the hot milk mixture veeerrry slowly for the first 2 cups. I used a small amount of dark rum  to enrich the flavour.

Indeed amazing.
Easy to make. I adjusted some ingredients. Only 300 ml of quality white rum was more than enough to have everybody enjoy it. And I added a little more cinnamon, which brought out that wonderful wintery feel!
Made it for the first time this last christmas and had people order it by the bottle!!

By far the best eggnog me or any of a couple dozen family members and friends have ever tried. Left out the rum and then added the prepared eggnog and the person's booze of choice, shook in a cocktail shaker over ice and...voila! A decent amount of work but well worth it. Bravo! Fantastic recipe and will become a tradition in my house. Thank you for sharing!

I was intimidated by the ingredients required for the recipe.  It turned out great, though!  One tip: when the recipe instructs you to stir every three minutes constantly, do so.  If not, the eggs actually cook and become fluffy.  Serving with cinnamon sticks made this drink look great!

A Christmas miracle according to my family. I left the rum on the side and it was wonderful both with and without the rum.

Excellent recipe, although very cream heavy for drinking on its own (for me).  If you make it the way it is written above with or without the rum, try adding to coffee.....AMAZING!  I redid the recipe using skim milk for the initial boiled portion and substituted whole milk for the light cream, and it was much easier to drink.  This is a perfect blend of the various spices.  Kudos!!!

I've always been back and forth on whether or not I like eggnog or not. I like the idea of it, but sometimes it's just not my thing. I made this because my son loooooves eggnog and I've been getting him I to cooking as a science. Oh. Em. Gee. It is so good. the only thing I changed was the light cream. I have no idea what that is. After googling it and getting a ton of results about the fats left in the dairy product, I just decided to go with 2 cups half and half and 2 cups heavy cream and hoped that would somehow equal light cream-ish. Definitely making this again, in the next 3 days, to give out as christmas goodies.

This recipe is the closest thing I can get to the real (read: store-bought) thing in the UK (though I leave out the rum and sub with more milk). Even my British friends are fans.

Fantastic! My favourite is to make it without the booze and add a little Bailey's to your glass when you serve it.

I did not care for this recipe.  I added half the sugar and it was still syrupy and way to over sweetened.

I researched recipes and chose this one because I liked the cooking process she uses and her great ratings. I did tweak it myself. I omitted the cloves and used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon. I only used 1 cup of sugar. When cooking the 2 mixtures together I used a double broiler. 1st batch used light cream, 2nd batch used half and half. Both very good. 1 3/4 cups of Captain Morgan Original Spiced Rum. No extra vanilla or nutmeg. I thought it was flavorful enough. Yummy!

I have made this recipe several times now, and it has definitely been a hit!  The only thing I do differently is omit the rum.  Next time I may cut back on the vanilla extract a bit as well, as the vanilla flavor is a bit heavy (but still so yummy).  I'm so happy to have found this recipe.  Another reason I'm fond of it is that it is a cooked recipe, as raw eggs are something I'm not comfortable consuming.  Enjoy!

I read the reviews and lessened the sugar as well as whipped the egg yolks until they were lighter in color.  I also tempered the eggs and sugar instead of adding all at once and had no lumps at all.  My daughter and I loved this.  It was so easy and so much better than store bought.

Ostrich--Rating the recipe as excellent IF you don't use all the rum that is called for--seriously, it's WAY too much.  My family is stationed in Africa and we quadrupled this recipe (for a large party) and used 1 ostrich egg!!  Ostrich meat is completely lean because all the cholesterol goes into the egg.  The nog was a bit strong and we will definitely add more milk/cream the next time!!

This recipe had great flavor and was pretty easy to follow, but I love really thick eggnog and it lacked a little bit in that department. On average though, one of the better recipes I've tried.

I followed this to a "T" and it was awful.  It was too thin and for the amount of ingredients (not cheap by the way!) I should have just stuck with the Betty Cocker Cookbook version.

This eggnog turned out excellent. I think using the full 2 1/2 cups of rum is a bit much, it was too strong for my liking, but was sure delicious nonetheless. Very easy to make too, would definitely make it again next Christmas!

Way too much cinnamon.  I had to strain it twice as much of the cinnamon formed clumps.  It tastes very much like the commercially available eggnog - nothing very special.  The recipe does make a very thick and yellow eggnog, if that is to your taste.  We prefer a creamier, less yolk-coloured variety.

Amazing eggnog!  I've made it several times now.  Once I decided not to do the extra work of cooking it and it was not nearly as thick or creamy tasting so now I always cook it according to the recipe directions.  

I add everything exactly as stated except for the rum. I put 2 shots of rum into a clean 750ML rum bottle and then fill the rest of the bottle with the eggnog so I have one bottle for the adults and the remaining eggnog goes in a pitcher for the kids.

This eggnog truly is amazing!  I use Captain Morgan spiced rum.  I also make a smaller batch with no alcohol in it.  I make it every year for Christmas Eve and I've already been getting requests.

SO. Just finished making it- here's my twist. I used 2% milk and 10% cream. Instead of liquid vanilla I used 2 vanilla beans, instead of ground cinnamon I used 2 cinnamon sticks and instead of nutmeg I used freshly ground mace. 

No double boiler required- my eggs were tempered properly so there was no curdling. To be honest, the straining was kind of a wasted step, all that I ended up straining off were the bubbles! 

Delicious, smooth, awesome. It's been left liquor free at the moment as everyone in my family prefers something a little different, and everyone likes it at different strengths.

Wow! This is a really great recipe! I didn't want the eggs to curdle and get lumpy so I added the milk mixture into the eggs, one ladle-full at a time until about 2/3 of the milk was whisked into the eggs. Then I added the tempered egg mixture into the pan and cooked for 3 minutes. No lumps and the texture is fantastic. I didn't add alcohol because my 1 1/2 year old granddaughter LOVES eggnog (if I want some liquor in mine, I can add it later). I'll be making this recipe often.

I just had to try to make homemade eggnog.... this recipe turned out great.... I followed the recipe exactly.... definately being cautious about over cooking the egg..... turned out wonderful... I divided in half and cut the alcohol back by about a 1/4 cup for half which would be a 1/2 cup for the recipe.... next time I think I will just make a whole batch non alcoholic and then if people want they can spike their own very good though...

Was wonderful & everyone loved this eggnog.  Used half heavy cream & half 2% milk. Did have to cook longer than called for to make thick enough.  Will definitely make again!

I have made this a few times, and every time it is great. People have asked for the recipe for this, rather than the other dishes I brought.
A couple of pieces that I would point out:
- I use double the amount of cloves, and 
- Add Allspice to the milk
* You really need to bring it to a boil VERY slowly.
- It was too sweet when I used the allotted amount of sugar, so I literally use half.
- I would also suggest to use fresher eggs, and rinse the shells before cracking them.

Enjoy the recipe, it is very tasty!

I found this recipe to have a Great result. The only changes i made were to substitute cinnamon sticks for ground and a whiskey called Spicebox (which is all natural and has all the background flavors of the eggnog in it already) for the rum....I highly reccomend it. end result was less of the alcohol after taste more flavor

Seriously the best eggnog. I don't usually enjoy eggnog but I cannot get enough of this stuff! 
Plus I'm lactose intolerant so it has to be worth it for me to drink it. 

My only suggestions would be to double the recipe and add a bit less sugar. I usually do about 1-1.25 cups of sugar. 

My husband also thought there was too much cinnamon, but that might have been because the teaspoon wasn't levelled.

I just finished preparing the mixture. Before refrigerating, I poured a small glass for my husband (who hates Eggnog) to try.  I figured that if he hated it, I could play with the recipe a little. His response? "Wow. That's surprisingly good." Haha. So, this one is a win. The only thing that I changed was that I added the rum to taste. I think I ended up pouring about a cup and a half (rather than two and a half). I am not a huge fan of rum, though. And, who knows, I might taste the mixture after being refrigerated, and add a little more rum. Definitely try this recipe. It will surprise you. :)

It was pretty complicated for somebody like me, who doesn´t have so much experience but loves to try new things. It turned out nice, but it didn´t blow me away and isn´t any better than a good bought one, in my opinion.

This was AWESOME. I had to made another batch because the first one was emptied within minutes. I made it per the ingredients minus the rum (had a lot of non drinkers) and it came out great.

Great recipe, and also very easy to lighten up and/or halve!  My hubby requested lighter egg nog, so I made half of this recipe using skim milk in place of the milk and cream, and cooking all of the milk with the spice.  We didn't much rum to it, so the resulting texture was still very good -- not too thin.  Goes great with cookies and pumpkin roll!

Good recipe- easy to follow. Used almond milk and it seemed fine. Tasted great- liked that it wasn't super thick like some I've had. Biggest issue was the smell... very eggy. But other than that, very good!

Just made this eggnog right now, so it's not completely chilled yet, but already tastes absolutely amazing! Only I added 1 1/2 cup of rum instead of 2 1/2 and 2 cups heavy cream/2 cups half&half instead of 4 cups light cream. Great recipe, definitely saving!

The recipe was very good! I made 2 batches so the children can enjoy, but switched the rum to Bailey's and added a pinch of salt. It seemed to be missing that little bit of bite. Thanks for sharing!

I follow the recipe exactly except for a change in the alcohol.  I replace the rum with a mix similar to Martha Stewarts (but cut in half):  1 1/2 cups good bourbon like Makers Mark, 1 cup quality Cognac, and 1/2 cup Dark Rum.  Refrigerate overnight.  My neighbors and relatives beg for it every Christmas.

I have made this for several years now! Every time I do make it, someone ends up asking for the recipe! I love, love, love the idea that it doesn't have raw eggs in it. I do only one thing different and that is I omit the rum, as there are young children who love this too. By doing this, it doesn't change the flavor...it's still fab! Thanks for the GREATEST eggnog recipe ever :)

wow this is an old school style egg nog that my dad used to make, albeit with raw eggs.  but that is a lot of rum, dang. if i were to measure out the alcohol for such a dish, id say half a shot's worth of alcohol per serving. a shot is a bit strong, and it seems like with 2/5 cups of rum, thats more than a shot, no?  i like the nog to have a noticeable alcohol flavor, but to stop at that. "hmm, that has a bit of alcohol" should be the taste. like if you drink too much, you will get surprised drunk.   real nog!

I made this recipe last night.  My first time ever trying to make home made egg nog.  I am a good cook, but I struggled a little with this recipe.  The taste is awesome, but it didn't get thick.  I'm not sure what part of the recipe I did incorrectly.   How long are you supposed to cook the eggs and how thick should they before removing from heat. . . Anyway, it was delicious and I'm giving it 5 stars for that.

The flavor is great, but came out chunky?  I have tiny little chunk the size of pin heads.  Maybe I'm a pinhead and just cooked it wrong.

This was the first time I made eggnog and I found the recipe to be simple and delicious. I followed the suggestions of other reviews and added less vanilla and 1 cup less rum and the eggnog turned out beautifully balanced. Everyone at my Christmas party loved this eggnog, and I will definitely make it again.

YUM!!! Everyone I've served this too loves it! I couldn't for the life of me find light cream, so I used 1 can of evaporated milk and 2.5 cups of whipping cream. I omitted the rum when I made it, so we could have some for the non-drinkers, and we spiked half of it later with a generous helping of Captain Morgan's. I also used Tahitian vanilla in place of regular vanilla (Williams-Sonoma) and it turned out fabulous!

OMG!  I will never buy eggnog in the store again!  I omitted the rum so that my kids can have this as well.  I did take the advice to cut the vanilla to 1 tsp at the end (though I love vanilla and make my own).  It did take a while to thicken, but I used VERY LOW heat for the milk and then gradually brought the entire mix up to temp to thicken.  No problems with curdling.  I used a slotted spoon to scoop out my 5 cloves rather than straining the entire pot. Thanks so much for sharing this fantastic recipe!

I just made this eggnog recently and I was utterly disappointed. It had the perfect consistency but all I could taste was vanilla. It overpowers all of the other spices and it just doesn't taste good at all to me.

I've never liked eggnog. Hate might be more accurate. But my family loves it so I made it for them. Pretty sure I drank most of it. I had to make a double match this week to make up for it. The only thing I changed was that I left the rum out. We're not drinkers.

What an amazing recipe! I cut the sugar by half, and omitted the rum (I'm not sure my kids would enjoy it!), and this is by far the best egg nog I've ever made. To me, it tasted a bit like a pumpkin pie in a glass, with the whipped cream included. I don't know that I'll be inclined to share!!

This is awesome!  I used 1% milk and then half & half for the cream and I did not add any rum so I added in its place 1 cup of heavy whipping cream and 1 1/2 cups of 1% milk.  To me this was the perfect consistency.  I had no problems with curdling or scorching.  I think its because I was making dinner at the same time so I kept the milk on low heat for a long time, stiring occasionally, bringing it to temp slowly.  I also added about a cup of the milk slowly to the yolks while stirring.  Then I added the yolk mixture slowly to the rest of the milk while whisking rapidly.  It took me longer than 3 minutes on medium heat to thicken the mixture, and even then it didn't get really thick.  It seemed to thicken more as it cooled.  I plan to make an angel food cake with the 12 egg whites I have left over.

Used milk instead of cream to make it a bit less heavy and whiskey because I didn't have any rum. Tastes great! Will absolutely make this again.

Wonderful recipe. Mine took 9 min. to get thick, kept putting my timer on 3 min intervals. I used 1 1/2 cups of rum., figured we can always add if we wanted to. Taste's great at room temp. Can't wait to try it tomorrow for Christmas. Thanks for a great recipe. :)

Nataliesmom, thanks for this wonderful recipe! I followed it exactly as written and had no problem at all. I added the hot milk one ladle at a time, and no curdling. I live in Mexico, and there is no store-bought eggnog to be had. This is so delicious, I wouldn't buy it from the store even if I could. Oh, I did add an extra teaspoon of nutmeg. Yummy!

Best eggnog my husband and I have EVER had!  I used the recipe for 6 servings.  Cut the sugar down to 1/2 C instead of 3/4 C.  Didn't add the rum so people could add to personal taste.  Next time I will cut the sugar to 1/3 C.  It was so easy and so good!

Excellent!  I don't really drink eggnog, so I don't have much to compare it to.  However, when I gave it to my boyfriend, his first reaction was, "It's different... it doesn't really taste like normal eggnog."  But it grew on him, and he drank the whole amount in a week, and requested that I make more of the same today!

Wow!  I made this recipe for my cookie exchange party over the weekend and it was the first thing to go. I was surprised at how easy this recipe was to make and everyone said it was MUCH better than any store-bought eggnog they had ever had.  I agree.

This was nice and creamy, but I expected it to have more flavor.  It was a very bland eggnog.  I think I will add less cream next time and bump up the spices.

Loved it.  I was paranoid about cooking my egg yolks and wound up ladling in small amounts of milk with my right hand while keeping the hand mixer going with my left.  I ended up with a big pile of foam that didn't get appreciably thicker over the heat.  I'm not sure if that was what it was supposed to look like, but it worked great.  The amount of Bacardi Gold rum (after it had mellowed overnight, at least) was perfect for my party guests, who were a bunch of heavy-drinking twenty- and thirtysomethings, but there's a definite kick that others might want to tone down.

I followed this recipe almost exactly, but left out the cloves because I don't particularly like their flavor. Also, as I am pregnant, I used 1tbs of artificial rum flavor extract instead of actual rum. I made a half batch, and it chilled overnight before I got a chance to taste it, but it is absolutely fantastic, excellent texture! I'll definitely be making more for the annual Christmas party my parents host!

Eggnog is one of the scarce few things I have always been intimidated by.  I made this wed night before thanksgiving.  When I woke up the next morning, the guys had drank it all.  (before 7am) I had to rush to get another batch made for guests.  (we kinda drank that one too) Suffice it to say, both ease of preperation and flavor, this is a keeper.  I kept out the rum as our parents don't drink, you didn't miss it.

Extremely good eggnog. I am not normally a huge fan of the stuff, but I have family who loves it. The brand that is their favorite isn't available where I live, and the ones that were at the store left much to be desired. Desperate, I decided to try making it and cross my fingers. Wow. Delicious. Add rum - not too strong - and you are in holiday heaven. My hubby and I ended up finishing the entire first batch off ourselves! Next time the only change I'll make is to double the batch from the start AND make a rum and non-rum version. Thank you!!!

WOW!  My husband loves eggnog and he actually gave this recipe a "wow, that's good".  Even someone here who doesn't really like eggnog enjoyed this very much.  So much better than store bought!  One thing to be aware of:  After the 6 hours in the fridge if your eggnog has a "texture", like grainy, leaving it in the fridge hours more somehow takes care of the problem.  It will be smooth and delicious.

I didn't think I liked Eggnog until we made this for Christmas. Very good. Definitely let it sit overnight so all the flavors blend together. We also used less rum than was called for. We plan on making an extra large batch for Christmas next year so the whole family can enjoy!

Im giving this 3 stars because I feel like it was good, but it wasnt Amazing. I felt it had a good flavor, but the consistency wasnt what I had expected. I like my eggnog thick. It does have a great spectrum of spicey after tastes which I did enjoy. I would reccommend making a half batch the first time you make it just to make sure you enjoy it before going through an entire dozen eggs. Do try, cause it is tasty.

I am NOT an eggnog person by any means.  I made this recipe to help a friend prepare for a party, and as soon as I took the first sip--I loved it.  Every person who drank some has converted to being an eggnog lover.  I did not include the cloves in the recipe, simply because I felt that it was a strong flavor for my taste.  Still rocked!  I also used Bacardi Rum--the original.  I almost wonder if a Vanilla rum would work, too.  I loved this recipe!

This egg nog is amazing! I used 750ml of white rum which is slightly more than the recipe called for but it didn't come out tasting too strong. We also inadvertently used skim milk as that is what we drink and had in the fridge, but it turned out great still! Probably not as creamy as the original but very refreshing and light tasting!

This is to die for!!  Made it without any rum, and added more milk and cream to make it a little less rich. . .so we could have more in one serving.  Tastes like a spice milkshake, but rich and goes down smooth.

So yummy! I omitted the rum. After I tempered the eggs with about 1c. of the hot milk I stirred it back in and kept stirring the 3 minutes, then strained right away. No problem with curdling, cooked just below medium heat.

I only used 1 cup of rum; 2.5 is WAY too much.  I also added the rum AFTER setting some aside for the kids and it still tastes great without the rum.  I only had dark rum on hand and it tastes fantastic!  I used low-fat half & half instead of the cream, substitued skim milk & used "Eggland's Best" brand eggs (they have 25% less fat than regular eggs) and again, this recipe is incredible and pretty much guilt-free!

This is the best recipe for eggnog I have found. I will no longer be looking for other recipes... I used this last year and added rum flavoring instead of the light rum because I was pregnant... but this year I will add the real stuff... yum.. yum... I am already looking forward to it.

I made this once to see how it would turn out. It turned out great! Only thing that I didn't follow  was that I used half and half instead of the light cream... Mine did curdle, like others suggested, I put it in the blender and it turned out great...  Update**  I made this again for my Christmas party, still using the half and half... I found that after mixing the egg mixture and then adding it to the milk mixture in the pot, and then warming it up until it was "cooked", it didn't curdle.. no blender to worry about... AWESOME RECIPE!!!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit.  I doubled it except the eggs.  The result was great.  The kids hated eggnog before because they thought it was too thick.  Also I used Heavy Cream instead of Light Cream, I think that helped since I only used 12 eggs instead of 24.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

My husband's comment was that this eggnog was just like store-bought!  It's not exactly what I was hoping to hear, but he adores store-bought eggnog, so it was a compliment.  He told me to give the recipe five stars, and he's quite stingy with his ratings.  I thought this actually tasted better than store-bought eggnog.  I don't drink, so I left out the rum, but that made it taste like it was missing something, so the second time I made it I added a tablespoon of rum extract.  That made it perfect.

I made this eggnog for a Christmas party a few years ago, and it was amazing! Ever since, I've always had request to bring a batch. The only change I would make is the amount of rum used... I'd recommend making it a virgin drink, and spiking individual drinks to taste.

This is "Amazingly Good!"  I added a bit more milk at the end when I added the rum.  I also whipped fresh whipped cream and sprinkled some nutmeg on top.  A definite party pleaser!

Great recipe! We compared it side-by-side with the store bought kind and hands down this recipe is better! I only used 2 cups of rum and found it a bit strong still so next time I will start small and add to taste. I didn't have any curdling issues with combining the mixtures slowly. It was much easier than I thought it would be.

I don't give many five star reviews but this deserves it. The BEST eggnog ever! I've made it with rum and rum extract (when we had non-drinkers over) and both were great. I also used this to make eggnog cheesecake and that was delicious as well. Yum!

This was a hit at our house.  Thick and rich - I'd encourage people to try it with rum in it - added 'to your taste'.  It makes it more adult.  Could modify by adding more milk for thinner nog.  I had to cook it a bit longer than three minutes with the eggs in it to get it to thicken up, but it did nicely.  The family was very happy with it.

I have to admit I was disappointed with this recipe given all the high ratings. It did not taste like eggnog to me, more like a liquid version of rice pudding. It was good, but just not like eggnog. That said, the recipe was easy to follow I had no problems whatsoever. The rest of my family does not drink so I omitted the rum. Maybe that is what made the difference. I might try again we'll see...

another recipe that i wanted to give 5 stars but it didn't quite rise to that level. i made a 1/2 batch (not enough eggs in the house on christmas day!), but it made a quart, which is how i would buy it anyway. it was sort of thin-my fault i'm sure (i didn't want my eggs to scramble)- but that wasn't really a problem. it was awfully sweet though, and even though i only added about 1/3 of the required vanilla, that was the strongest flavor--before adding the rum, that is!! i've wanted to make eggnog for years, and this was a good start. i'll just have to play with the recipe a bit.

Spicy and oh SO yummy!  Better than store bought. Don't change a thing.  Anyone who says it was not as thick as it should have been must not have cooked it enough.  I did it in a big metal bowl over a pan of boiling water, for about 10-15 minutes, stirring constantly. It thickened slightly, but became very thick as it set over night.  I didn't put alcohol in it.  I'm sure that would have thinned it more, but mine was VERY thick.  I thinned it with a bit of 1/2 & 1/2.  Delish!!

This was a great...it did not get as thick as I would have liked but that was probably my fault...I found that cutting it half and half with fresh brewed coffee is a wonderful idea and it tastes delightful.

This nog is "da' bomb". I omitted the cloves for no better reason as I was feeling broke with the holidays and all. Those little things are pricey. I suppose I would have had more money if I had not replaced the rum with Hennesy VS Cognac. I would not recommend going all out for the XO, as such great alcohol ought to be sipped by itself.

Anyway, the nog was a big hit. My buddy got storebought stuff and it went untouched while we scrambled to get ingredients for another batch of the real thing.

Highly recommended.

Never made eggnog before in my life. I searched for the best (and easiest) cooked egg nog recipe with alcohol and this one was the winner! Super easy to make and delicious! I added 1 1/2 c. rum to start and then added a 1/2 c. more for a total of 2 cups instead of the 2 1/2 cups called for in the recipe. Didn't want to get Grandma too giddy. lol My tips would be to catch it right when it begins to boil, keep stirring and don't scrap any browning that might happen on the bottom of the pot. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe. I will be making it every year. Julie

Fantastic recipe!  It was wonderful before and after adding the rum.  I will make sure to double the recipe next time.  I put in half the rum called for and think it would be too strong with with the entire amount noted in the original recipe.
  This recipe makes a half gallon.

I followed the recipe(that I halved) and it turned out great with such fresh flavor, the only problem was it tasted a bit too rummy.. I solved this problem by serving it mixed with chocolate milk and making it into a chocolate eggnog drink.  I would suggest adding rum to taste, or even experimenting with a spiced rum.

Like others before me I unintentionally cooked the egg mixture too long.  Our blender isn't working so I whipped the egg mixture with the whipping attachment on my food processor.  It worked well. The graininess of the mixture disappeared.  I used 2 cups of rum instead of the 2 & 1/2  cups that the recipe calls for.  It was too much for me.  I should have put in one cup and then tasted it first and then added more.
I added a cup and a half of cream to thin down the rum taste and added a little extra cinnamon and nutmeg. Next time I will only use one or 1 and a half cups of rum.  It still tastes quite good.  I will definitely try this recipe again.

I made my second batch yesterday and it turned out much better! I think using half and half cream really did it for me; my friends loved it. I left out the rum, and put about a cup of sugar. It was perfect, thanks Natalie's Mom :-)

I've never been the domestic type; my first venture ever into the world of home-cooking was this year's Thanksgiving (crazy, huh?).  But it turned out great with help from all the recipes on this site.

Anyway, I must say I was nervous about the pasteurizing process, but this recipe turned out to be, well, truly amazing, even in the hands of a novice cook!  I had to used freshly grated nutmeg instead of ground (four stores in our neighborhood were completely sold out, hehe), and I left out the rum.  Simply delicious, with just the texture I was looking for.  I'll continue to make this for the Holidays from now on, God willing.

This is, in fact, the best eggnog ever created.  I made it without the rum and it's absolutely perfect!  Even my husband, who hates store bought eggnog, really likes this.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've never made egg nog from scratch before, nor had I ever had a homemade version, so I couldn't say how this ranks in that category.  I CAN say that this was better than my favorite brand of store-bought.  It had a richer flavor, I can control the sweetness (I don't like it quite as sugary), and best of all, it tasted fresh.  I'm saying this just from my test-version where I made one serving for myself.  I'm going to try to make this for Thanksgiving so that my whole family can give it a shot.  Hope I'll have time; if not, I'm sure I'll have many other opportunities this year.  Yummy!

So good.  I made this multiple times during the last holiday season.  People who say they don't like egg nog (probably have only had the store bought kind) love this egg nog.  And the fact that the eggs are cooked makes me feel better serving it to others.

incredible! Really good. My son said he wished it had been thicker, but I disagree.  I think he is just used to the artifical thickeners in the store bought stuff.  I may not have let it thicken enough during cooking, but it was perfect as far as I was concerned.  I will never buy eggnog again!

I quit drinking egg nog 25 years ago when I found out my Dad made my beloved beverage with RAW  eggs! I haven't had it since I was 10! This tastes exactly as I remember with the bonus of COOKED eggs. I made a batch without rum for the kids, just add 2 tbsp rum extract for the correct flavor. YUM! Thanks so much for this recipe!!

Oh Wow!  This is fantastic, best eggnog recipe I have ever made.  It was time consuming, but worth it. It took forever to get it to boil.  I finally turned it up just a bit.  It came out smooth.  I added less rum, I would start with less and add to taste.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

Ouch.  I hate to be a spoilsport, particularly with so many positive reviews and so close to Christmas, but here it is:  I thought this recipe was just okay.  I decreased the rum by 1/2 because as written, it seemed like too much.  Though I generally think it's unfair to review an altered recipe, in this case, I'm glad I lowered the booze.  It had a slight edge as it was, even cutting it in half--but was still okay.  To boot, it takes some real time to put things together.  Shoot me, but I must not lie.  I like the store bought stuff better.

This recipe was great!  It was my first Christmas to host and this eggnog was a definite hit.  I used less than 2 1/2 cups of rum and it was still great!  Thanks!

Love this recipe! I started adding amaretto to my glass of eggnog during the holidays! I miss It so much that I have to have this all year round lol! The only thing I used different was heavy cream instead of light cream! Still taste great and not too thick. Not as sweet as the store bought, which I like too!

So rich and full of lovely spice! Made many many times. Instead of rum just a splash of rumchata is nice. Makes an excellent party gift or Christmas gift poured into a gallon mason jar and festooned with a bow. Will win over diehard eggnog skeptics.

It is definitely delicious!! I did use whole milk, and the second batch I added 1 cup of brandy in addition to the rum, which I used spiced rum... I made the first batch for Christmas gifts. They called me to tell me how good it was after they gave it a taste!

I absolutely loved it. I’m away from home and this tastes very similar to the egg nog from home. I didn’t add any rum because I have a toddler. I recommend this recipe.

I love this recipe. I make it every holiday season. The only thing that I do differently is that I whip the egg whites and fold them into the eggnog. Great recipe.

Simply amazing. We didn’t add the liquor until after (by the cup) as some people drink and some don’t. It was sooooo tasty and actually better than store bought.

Truly an Amazingly Good Eggnog. We cut the sugar in half, decrease egg yolks to 6-8, use milk and half and half, and it always turns out great. Has become a Christmas tradition in our family and once ready, it goes fast! We don’t add the alcohol until serving, and then prefer honey whiskey or brandy in lieu of rum. Be sure to slowly temper the hot milk mixture into the eggs, stirring constantly, or you will end up with a

Taste great but It should be thicker. I messed up so maybe that's why, I didn't let it cool long enough, (maybe 10min, on the counter and not in the fridge) before adding the remainder ingredients, unless it's runny for another reason.

This is fantastic.  Use Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum to hide the alcohol taste.  I added 3 whole cups and barely got a tingle. I wanted to add more but also didnt want to inadvertantly get Grandma drunk. I also used half and half instead of "light cream" cause I didnt see such a thing at the store.   I will definitely make this again. Everyone loved it!

I halved the recipe and made a few substitutions so I didn’t have to go to the store...I used 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves instead of whole cloves (I did still strain as instructed, don’t skip this step because it catches any curdled milk...it wasn’t much but I like a smooth texture), a 1/3 teaspoon of cinnamon instead of 1/2 (since allspice contains cinnamon), half and half instead of light cream, and 1/4 teaspoon Allspice instead of nutmeg. I used Captain Morgan spiced rum and lastly, peaked the egg whites with 1 tbspn of sugar and folded it into the nog after chilling for a few minutes because I like it frothy!
OMG...YUMMY!! ??
I made this for a friend but ended up drinking an entire glass after my initial taste test. I’m delivering it tomorrow!! 
Please note...it is rather spikey but oh so good!! I don’t plan to operate heavy equipment after drinking it...??

I make this every Christmas.  I mostly follow the directions, except I couldn't find light cream so I used half and half.   And when I make the adult version, I use 3/4 cup each of dark rum, brandy, and kahluah.  It is very delicious whether it's virgin, or not.  Especially if you make it a day or 2 in advance and let it sit in the fridge and marinate.   My husband, who is ridiculously picky with foods and beverages cuz he thinks he's a chef, absolutely loves this and won't even drink store bought eggnog anymore.

This would be great with or without alcohol. Definitely only use half of what’s called for though. I like my booziness, but that 2.5c would be overwhelming.

This eggnog is deliciously creamy. I beat up the egg whites for extra foam which worked out great. I also added fresh ground nutmeg which gives it a scent so reminiscent of the holidays. It was a little sweet, and next time I would use less sugar. I didn't add the rum and maybe that would have cut down on the sweetness. Overall, a great recipe.

I didn't follow the time suggestions for cooking the milk and egg mix.  Instead, I slowly cooked the milk to 160°F (not boiling), then slowly added it to my egg mix with my stand mixer running on medium.  Once all in, I put the mix back into my pan and cooked it to 160-165°F while whisking the mix.  I found no issues with any burning milk or curdling eggs in the two batches I made AND I have the peace of mind that it will be safe for consumption.  So far, so good!  I made this tonight (Christmas Eve) for tomorrow (Christmas).  I made a spiked batch and a virgin batch.  We sampled each over ice before putting them to bed for rest.  Let me say... the flavor is amazing and the aroma is out-of-this-world.  My husband who does not like rum and doesn't really like eggnog said it was good!   I could taste the rum a little too much, but when I added some whipped cream as a topper it cut through the sharp alcohol taste and was dangerously delicious (had hubby sample it after figuring that out).  I funneled my mixes into some empty milk jugs and tucked them in.  I can't wait to see how the final product turns out.  Barring a complete collapse overnight, I am giving this 5 stars!

omg SO Good! no curdling.. I used half and half and milk as I didn't have light cream . I doubled the recipe and added a bit less sugar as had been suggested but it would have been fine as written. I added enough rum to make it last a bit longer than the 4-5 days.

I've made it and it's great, however, it is overly sweet for my taste.
I have even used less sugar than what the recipe called for, but it was still too sweet.
But other than that, it is fluffy and great, kind of like a milkshake but with much more air in it, and it was my first time that I've ever had eggnog, overall, I enjoyed it and I think I will make it again, but with a few changes, since it is winter, I think I will try to serve it hot, not sure how that would go, we'll see.

This recipe is devine! I used Jamieson Irish whiskey instead of rum  but I'm sure it's good with either of those. At the end of recipe I replaced 1tsp of vanilla with pure almond extract 
which added an extra special flavor. It's so good, like a dessert! A big hit at the party!

The base recipe is solid, this produces a thick creamy eggnog. I found the spices off: the cinnamon overpowers and the nutmeg underwhelmed. Try steeping several cinnamon sticks, a few cloves and a crushed nutmeg in the hot milk for an hour before proceeding, the flavor deepens, becoming more balanced. Reduce the sugar to 1 cup. I prefer mine with bourbon.

I made at least ten batches of this last year to serve to friends and neighbors  that dropped by and everyone loved it.  Each batch was a bit different depending on what was still in stock at the grocer, heavy cream in some, half & half in others,  milk to fill in the gaps and amazingly it adapted well each time.  Some got rum, some took bourbon but all seemed happy to have it!

I loved this! And so did my family, especially my sister who is very picky with her eggnog lol. I didn't have enough rum extract to substitute for the real rum so it didn't have as much flavor, but OMG add the rum! It makes all the difference. I will definitely be making this again! Thank you!!

Awesome  sauce recipe. Definitely worth it. Just make sure to add little by little the rum (too much of it for my taste).

Holy moly!!!  This is soooooo good!!!  I almost left out the cloves, but I wanted to try the true recipe. YUM!!!  It’s perfect!  I did substitute one cup of whiskey for one cup of rum. I’m saving this recipe forever!

Followed the recipe except without the rum.  Used Rum flavoring.  I felt the flavor was okay but not good enough to justify the amount of work to make it instead of just buying a well known brand at the store.

I made this today. Everything went perfectly until the last step, and then I noticed the egg was starting to curdle. I  followed someone else's tip and pulled it off the stove-top, put over a bowl of ice and stirred with a whisk like crazy. It saved it! I left out the rum so people can add it to their own liking. It tastes divine! Rich and flavorful, smooth and delicious. Thank you for the great recipe!!

This recipe worked really well. I was low on rum, so only added 1 1/2 cups and accidentally grabbed heavy cream instead of light. It all ended up working perfectly because you had to mix it with a bit of milk to thin it out (stretched it out) and the amount of rum meant you got a hint, but it wasn’t too strong. Making it again tonight!

Love this recipe! I’ve used it the last couple years, and it produces consistently great eggnog. I often cut the recipe in half for smaller gatherings and have been using a 50/50 combination of cognac and dark rum for a smoother flavor than rum alone.

I used evaporated (Carnation) milk instead of regular milk and added ground ginger as well. Best eggnog I’ve ever had in my life!!! Something magical happens when you refrigerate it overnight. It doesn’t taste the same but it’s so amazing!

It was delicious and not too difficult to make.  I appreciated having the video, especially for the warning to not put all of the hot milk mixture in with the eggs but to add it slowly.

Thanks so much!!!  It was a big hit at Christmas dinner.

Honestly this is one recipe perfect as stated. One caveat - if you aren’t experienced enough to bring milk to a a boil in a pan (I’m not) use a double boiler method to prevent burning. This is creamy and only gets better on day 2 thru ... kidding it doesn’t last past day 2 even when I hide it overnight when I first make it.

. It did not turn out exactly like I had expected it to. Also, I didn't have any whole cloves. Next time I think I'll try it with brandy.

This was simple to follow and turned out great! If you aren't a big alcohol drinker I would definitely go easier on the alcohol. Maybe 75% of what the recipe calls for. I loved it. However, instead of using light rum, I used Kraken Spiced Rum. It tasted great with it.

This was my first time having OR making eggnog as the drink never appealed to me before, but my first experience based on this recipe.... it was DELICIOUS!!! And I somehow *know* the storebought brands will pale in comparison because storebought things are always overdone, but this just tastes homemade and soo so tasty!!!! I used vanilla paste and a cinnamon stick in the first half of the recipe. I also tempered the egg-sugar w/ 1/2 c of the milk mixture before adding to pot. I also accidentally boiled the milk mixture while in the pot, and the eggs started to curdle so I followed another reviewer’s advice and mixed it w/ my hand mixer while placing the pot over a bowl of ice water, it WORKED! For the 2nd half of the recipe I did not add rum, and used 1/2 c half and half and 1/2 c almond milk in place of the light cream because that’s what I had. I also used pumpkin pie spice instead of nutmeg.... MMMMMMMM!! Sooooo good!! I will try my next cup with a little bit of irish cream liquor and see how that pans out, but so far, I will be making this again and again!!! Thank you for the recipe!!

Delicious but we used dark rum and even a bit of spiced rum to kick it up.   Probably because we found it a tad sweet. I would like to try next time cutting sugar a bit.  Make sure your spices are fresh. Mine didn’t taste as fragrant as I’d hoped so will buy fresh next time I make it.  Also might make half batch if there isn’t a huge number drinking it.

This eggnog is delicious.  I will definite be making this throughout the holiday seasons to come.  Sooo much better than the store bought stuff.  I definitely recommend u try this at least once, you'll be hooked - and so will ur family.I did cook the egg mixture too long and it curdled, but a few minutes in my stand mixer and it was smooth again.  I didn't add the rum since alcohol doesn't mix with my meds, but it was still wonderful.  Meant to add rum flavoring but there were too many people watching me with their cups in hand.  Popular with everyone.

This tasted great even only halfway done. The flavors are perfect, however it is cloyingly sweet. I would probably cut the sugar down by a quarter or a third next time.

Full disclosure, I haven't added the rum yet. I'm going to be using some of this in another recipe, so the rum will be added to individual glasses.

I don't like eggnog but hubby does; I thought maybe I'd like it better homemade. I made this for Thanksgiving and have since made it 4 more times bc hubby & my mom can't get enough, even I enjoy a few sips! 
I don't add rum since each person likes their own amount and also when there's only 4-8 people I halve the recipe (using 3 cloves since they're so tiny)

Most of my family don't like eggnog.  I made this for Christmas and even the non-eggnoggers liked it.  The consistency wasn't as thick as store bought and the flavor was way better.  I left the rum out since some folks prefer bourbon, or even whiskey, this way everybody could spike it to their liking.  This will definitely become part of our Christmas tradition.

I actually didn't make it, though it sounds delicious and will be using this as I search for the best recipe. Can anybody explain why vanilla on the ingredient list twice? Is that a typo? It's also unusual to see vanilla added to a saucepan to be brought up to temperature, only before adding  4 times as much later. I searched other recipes for eggnog and can't seem to get to the bottom of this!

I live in Norway and I must say that it delivers what it says! However - it is a lot. I recommemd to divide the recipe into half if it`s just you and the spouse.  Or just gift half of it to your mother outlaw. Which is my secret trick for an amazing Christmas. ????

It’s awesome!  Soooo careful but the hot liquid curdled.  After 15 seconds in the RX Bullet (half at a time) it was perfect.  Didn’t change a thing in recipie.

I followed the recipe, except I withheld the rum so the kids could drink it. Without the rum, this is far too sweet, so if you plan on making it without rum, you could half the sugar for sure.

The recipe worked great!  I whipped the egg yolks before adding the sugar like another review said, and I didn't have any problem with curdling (don't know if that was related, but it was an easy extra step.)  I used whole milk, and coffee rich (non-dairy coffee creamer) instead of light cream (I couldn't find any), but it still is delicious.  I had someone have the mixer on low while I slowly added the boiled milk to the egg yolk and sugar mixture.  The sugar is a little much, and tastes even sweeter after sitting in the fridge all night.  I also left out the rum.  I halved the recipe, but it made enough for my sister to and her kids to have (it's still not a healthy drink, but there was enough for everyone to have some...in healthy moderation levels).  I'd make it again with less sugar, and possibly with some rum extract to see how that tastes.

I don't know how people could screw this up.  It's a wonderful and easy recipe.  Temper the eggs with a little of the milk mixture before pouring into the hot milk, and you won't have scrambled eggnog.  Half and half IS light cream, by the way.  I started out with no rum and gradually added it to taste.  Some like it boozier than others.  Fantastic eggnog recipe and is way better than my mother's old recipe.

This was delicious! I changed the alcohol: 1/2 c of Captain Morgan original rum and 1/2 c of Evan Williams Kentucky bourbon. I didn't want a strong alcohol taste. This was perfect and easier than I thought it would be to make!

Tasted very good but too sweet and too alcoholic tasting. Next time I will add only 1 cup of sugar and only add a shot of rum for flavour. Any extra rum will be added on an individual cup basis.  Other than that, it’s worth making again!

I like it. A lot. My kids gave the original unadulterated recipe, sans rum, two thumbs up with wide eyes of appreciation.

As with all recipes, there are personal preferences. Mine were to reduce the sugar by a 1/4c and I tossed in a few  cracked cardamom pods to the milk mixture.  I also used 1c of black rum and 1.5c of cognac instead of light rum.

excellent, with a couple tweaks, I reduced the rum to 1.5 cups of spiced rum.  2.5 cups is way overpowering! and reduced the sugar a tad to 1.25 cups as well. I also put the cloves in a tea ball to contain them and takes out the step of having to strain the eggnog.  oh an it takes WAY longer than 5 min to get the milk to boil on low heat.

It is snowing outside, so that got me into the holiday spirit to make something yummy. While I was making this, it smelled wonderful. I made it exactly as stated in the recipe, (except for 2 cups of cream and all that booze) when I got to the egg yolk mixed with the hot milk, I was not scared, as I make pudding all the time.  When I transferred it back into the pot to simmer, everything looked great till I tried to strain it. It seemed the yolks decided to cook.. Well that did not stop me! I got out my handheld mixer and started to whip it up. After a couple minutes, tried straining it again. Perfect! Let it cool and I only had enough cream for 2 cups, so used whole milk for another 2 cups. Also, that much rum? I guess people need to be drunk to enjoy their day. I only put about 1/2 a cup maybe in there.. I just poured some in and tasted it and thought, yea that is just fine.  Left over egg whites, no problem.. made banana cream pie with Italian Meringue. Still more egg whites, no problem.. made noodles for chicken noodle soup tonight.. Nothing wasted.

Very good recipe!!! I noticed that others commented that theirs came out  chunky and I realized you need 2 people when you put the hot milk with the eggs. One stirs and the other pours very slowly or the eggs get cooked and clump.

I made this recipe the other night.  2.5 Cups of Rum is way too much for the recipe as-is.  If you're going to include the rum, I'd reduce the amount to 1 - 1.5 C.  

That being said, this has a really nice flavor. I made a change.  I used Silk Vanilla almond milk instead of milk due to dairy sensitivities in my household.

Tastes similar to the eggnog bought from the store.

we have been making this recipe for probably 5 years, and it's now a family tradition with my kids, nephews and their families!  This year we will be getting together twice during this holiday season to make it (because it never lasts that long)  

We leave out the rum, and add it to your glass if you want it (this way, everyone can have some, even the kids)

Wonderful recipe! Family favorite now. Just left the cloves out as I'm not a big fan. Light cream is not common in my country, used half and half and evaporated milk instead.

My first homemade eggnog! I did everything exactly except for the following:
- I made x2 all ingredients for a total of 1 gallon!
- I actually ground all the cloves and didn't strain it.

DELICIOUS!! However,  I think next time I will use slightly less sugar (3 cups total in mine to make twice as much - will do 2 3/4 next time)

This was amazing! Tastes like a cream liqueur.
I used 6 whole eggs instead of 12 egg yolks, replaced 1 of the cups of cup of cream with a cup of of milk.
Only used 2 cups of Rum, but next time I will use 2.5, maybe it will keep me from drinking it so fast!

I've made this recipe about a dozen times now. This is a great base recipe for eggnog. Has the right balance of egg, dairy and sugar which makes for the ideal creaminess and sweetness. I wouldn't change a thing for those three parts, but I made two changes to this recipe for personal taste. First I upped the spice content (doubled the cloves, extra teaspoon-ish of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg), cause I like to really taste the holiday spices. Second - and this is the kicker - instead of rum, I use 3/4 - 1 cup of grain alcohol. 190 proof. Basically the same alcohol volume but it tastes less boozy and highlights all the other components instead of overpowering them. Cheers!

This was a really great recipe. I did not use the rum, but imagine the taste would have been heightened with the addition. The flavors mended really well and the cooked eggs made for a frothier taste and texture. Thank you for this recipe. I will be making this all year long.

Since I first came across this recipe, I have made it for the last 5 years!!! It's the only recipe I'll use and I don't even think about buying eggnog at the store. This recipe is the absolute best, hands down!
For family gatherings, I leave out the rum so the young ones can have eggnog - I just bring rum with me so that those old enough can add it if they want.

Outstanding eggnog recipe! My only change was to reduce the alcohol content by half. I will be making this every holiday season from now on.

If your eggnog tastes like it is too strong, you should let it sit for longer! This is EXTREMELY important. I made this the night before christmas eve and I decided to reduce the amount of alcohol by a half cup. My boyfriend and I both thought it tasted way too strong.  But by Christmas eve, about 14 hours later, it tasted like it could have actually used the half cup of rum I initially omitted! 

If you have any hesitations about using this recipe, LET THEM GO because this is the best eggnog I have ever tasted, store bought or homemade.

I swapped out the milk and cream for unsweetened almond milk (my husband has a ton of food allergies, including dairy, and has been missing eggnog for almost a decade), and it. was. AMAZING! Two of my three kids HATE eggnog, and they still loved this (sans alcohol, obviously).

I don't just love eggnog but as my husband does I made this for him... and I actually like this stuff (might help my frame of mind about it as the eggs are cooked).
We don't drink so I added a teaspoon of rum extract and 1/4 cup less sugar as some suggested. 

When I heated the egg and milk mixture I decided to temp it every little bit. It STARTED BUBBLING AT 150 DEGREES. I shut the burner off and got out my big bowl to mix everything in and (the mixture was in a thick bottomed pot) by the time I poured out the mixture it HAD CURDLED. So you can just heat the mixture to 150° but then immediately pour it into a different container. Oh and btw I just used my hand blender to smooth it out. It was very smooth and oh so delicious.

This was so good.  I didn't add rum to the batch but had it available to those who wanted to add it.  I made Angel Food Cake III with the egg whites.  Both the nog and the cake were delicious.

This was my first time making eggnog. This recipe was easy and fuss free. I added 2 1/2 cups of bourbon, it smells much more strong than it tastes. Everyone was a fan, even those who had never tried eggnog before. I added a dash of allspice to give it a little extra holiday flavor.

Very good! I whipped the eggs in my kitchen aid so there was no way they’d curdle.  I used 1 cup of sugar and half and half instead of light cream.  Only problem is it will be gone within 30 minutes of setting it out, it doesn’t quite make enough for my eggnog loving family.

I liked it and am hopefully going to bring it over to my family's Christmas ( and holiday since some aren't christian) gathering. Just a couple things, I'm not sure if I messed up the recipe somewhere, but there seem to be small flakes of something in it. Besides that, only complaint I have is that the amount of alcohol is too strong, so I'm assuming that this recipe was meant for people who have no problem with strong drinks. Therefore, I had to cut the amount of alcohol in half in order to make it bearable to my (and also my family's) palate. Still, a great recipe overall.

Microwaved milk combo for 5 minutes (or until very warm) before bringing to boil to help reduce stove top time. Did not end up coming to a boil within 30 minutes otherwise. If eggs curdled, we blended the mixture.  4 cups light cream = 437.5 ml thickened cream + 562.5 evaporated milk. Reduced sugar to 200 g (1 cup).

Lovely! Would like it to be thicker, though. Might be best to just use more milk and less thickened cream next time, cut out the evaporated milk. EDIT: Thickened a lot over the next few days. No need for it to be thicker.

I dropped the sugar down to a cup and I also substituted light cream for half and half since i didn't see light cream anywhere.

I was so worried about curdling that I heated the milk by just one notch at a time and only went to medium for it to boil. It took forever, but I didn't have any curdling!!

I also beat the eggs by themselves because someone said that would prevent them from cooking when the hot milk was added. 

I used a hand mixer and slowly scooped the hot milk out and added it bit by bit with the hand mixer beating the whole time! It made it so foamy! When I had finished adding all the milk I went to pout it all back into the pot to find it was all FOAM!!! I was really worried I had messed it up, but I followed the directions of continuously stirring it while it was on medium. It was still just pure foam. I left it alone for 40 minutes and VOILA! It turned back into liquid enough for me to strain the cloves out. It was perfectly smooth and not a lump to be found!

I followed the rest of the directions besides adding the alcohol and BOY WAS IT AMAZING!!! After removing a cup for my husband who doesn't drink, I added one cup of Caption Morgan's spiced rum. It went very well with the nog! I wanted to see what it was like with the entire 2 1/2 cups, but I was too worried about messing it up. One cup gives it more flavor then kick. It was very tasty!!

Very disappointed in this recipe. Think the cinnamon is overkill and ruins the flavor. Made it without the alcohol and thought we would add it to our individual glasses. Made it last night and and tried it this morning. Considering throwing it out.

First, I didn't add rum and I used heavy cream, as that is what I had on hand and I've never seen light cream anywhere. I also only did a half recipe. It was good, very creamy. If you don't like it creamy than use half and half or do heavy cream and milk. It doesn't specify what milk to use so I used whole cows milk. I whisked very slowly all the hot milk into the egg mixture than put it back in the pan. I also cooked it at a lower temperature because my first try it boiled and curdled at medium temperture. I've cooked egg yolks like that before so it wasn't for lack of experience. Also, you really must stir constantly. I stirred for much more than 3 minutes, just until when I would pull the spoon out of the mixture that it coated the spoon. Set aside to cool and added the cream, vanilla, and nutmeg about 15 minutes later. I don't know why you have to wait an entire hour. Tasted it and it was like drinking warm spiced and thin vanilla pudding. Let it chill in the fridge for 2 hours and tasted it, it was good eggnog. I will be making this again with no rum, cooking the second time at a lower temperature and not waiting an hour to mix the last of the ingredients in. It is pretty sweet so I may try like others suggested to cut the sugar back some, but not absolutely necessary.

For those who do not like the rum or alcohol in eggnog...you really just like spiced custard, not eggnog.  But for those who like rum, bourbon and or brandy- you have to add these to your own taste. Make the basic mix up, then add half the suggested amount, keep topping it and tasting until its at the point you like. Some recipes call for 50/50 rum and brandy, but i like the brandy to be about a quarter the amount of rum. Its just a subjective taste thing. This basic recipe is great, but spices and alcohol are always added to your own taste

I would give this five stars, but it's way too sweet! I would decrease to probably 1 cup.  I was making it virgin, because i'm pregnant, so I think that the sweetness would mellow once the rum is added. But for drinking straight, it's too much! I would also add more of the spices to give it more of a punch. Really do wait until the end to add the nutmeg, though! It turned my mixture a bit dark, weirdly.

I hate when people review based on the changes they make. I made this to the letter and really, it’s so rummy, sweeeeet, and not as “creamy” as most other recipes that whip the egg whites. I only tried this because I wanted to try one with more spices — which is NOT traditional nog. Okay, but I’ll go back to my creamier recipe.

Tasted really really good and was Super easy to make although this was my first time. Only thing I changed was, I added less light cream (3 cups). As I was adding the cream I kept tasting it. At ~2 cups it tasted amazing! After the 3rd cup I felt it became too milky so I stopped then. But it was a Super yummy recipe. Oh also I added a lot more rum ;)

I got tired of buying REAL eggnog for $7.99 at the store so thought I'd try making it. Followed the recipe exactly  and it was AMAZING! I did leave out the rum. Used the 12 egg whites and made an Angel Food Cake - yum!

When we moved to a country that does not sell Eggnog in the grocery store, I had to resort to making my own to keep the Christmas tradition going. 
This recipe has become a family favourite.  I make it every year without fail.  We have an annual Eggnog party just before Christmas for all of our family and friends. 
I follow the recipe to a tee - no variation, and it is ideal!

It IS Amazingly Good Eggnog! I read all the reviews about the liquor being slightly too strong, decided to ignore them, and had to concede that maybe next time I'll add a little less. Maybe it's because I also used brandy (that's what I had in the house) but it is an amazing recipe and I'm definitely doing this again!

I made this just last night. I followed the recipe and instructions very closely-except for the rum. I did make a mistake though and my eggs got a bit lumpy and now the eggnog is a bit lumpy but the taste is awesome! 
*I did add extra cinnamon and leave out the rum because this was mainly for kids. 
You really have to let the eggnog cool overnight because that is when the flavor goes from ehhh to amazing. I'll be making again soon

I just made this a second time - perfection! But NO RUM. And this time I whisked in the hot milk to the eggs much slower because my eggs curdled the first time. (Then to that lumpy mixture we added the full amount of rum... Literally the second worst thing I have ever tasted, after fermented soybeans.) I kept the old batch and put it in my food processor to try to smooth things out, and mixed a bit of that with the new non-alcoholic batch, but still too strong!! Unless you're a huge fan of rum and don't want to taste the spices at all, start with a splash and work up from there.

The end result was good but not as quick as what the video shows. would recommend looking up basic tips of making eggnog if you are trying to make eggnog for the first time. Doing everything as thorough and slowly as you can will give you a result worth the time and effort. HAS ANYONE TRIED USING HEAVY CREAM WITH THIS RECIPE FOR A THICKER EGG NOG?

I'm making this for our holiday party at work. I use ground cloves so you don't have to remove anything and next time I make it I'm going to try to make it a bit thicker somehow. Haven't decided how yet. I've yet to make it using the rum though.

Instead of light cream I used 2 cups heavy cream + 2 cups half & half. For the rum, Captain Morgan's spiced. I used all 12 yolks and didn't have any problems with milk curdling or eggs cooking. I gave it 2 days in the fridge before serving and it's delish! I will be making this many, many times. Thanks for the hit recipe!

This was good ... not spectacular .  But My kids liked it . Next time I'll add less cinnamon . I whipped the eggs and sugar until light in color,  didn't have one problem with the eggs curdling. I also really liked the consistency . It was just like store bought consistency .

good stuff. made a half batch as a test and it is gone already.  :)  we did not strain it for the cloves because we thought we would just find them on our own and we did, no trouble, but i wonder if it would have also strained out a little bit and made it a bit smoother. it was good stuff. loved the flavor.   we did not change anything from the standard recipe except that we cut it in half and no alcohol.  yum. and for the left over egg whites we made angel food cake cupcakes.

This is THE best eggnog. I did not add the rum. It tastes fantastic all on its own. If I  want rum, I will add one oz to a full glass of eggnog and top it with more nutmeg.

I've made this eggnog every year since first trying it in 2012. I made it exactly per the recipe the first year, but my sister and I agreed that one less clove would taste better, as it was slightly too clovey (if that's even a word). I've put in 4 cloves ever since and she, my mom, and I think it's scrumptious (we're the only ones who like eggnog). SO MUCH better than store bought. It's very light and smooth. If it tastes like there is too much rum, just put less in; it will taste fine. I usually make at least a third of it non-alcoholic for my niece and it still tastes great.

Turned out awesome. I reduced the recipe to 4 servings because it was only for a couple people, and I used Malibu coconut rum instead of light rum. Absolutely delicious, and a very easy recipe. Would highly recommend.

Definitely cut the sugar! I would have given this a much lower rating if I had not read about cutting the sugar. Even doing a cup of sugar for the whole recipe is pretty sweet, but other wise it is tasty. I did not use the alcohol. Didn't have rum and did not want to use bourbon. Will make again

My personal first home made egg nog experience ..  I loved it and experienced egg nog drinkers thought it was amazingly good.  I did use half and half in place of the light cream and I thought it was perfect .    It is rich, creamy and smooth, not overly sweet or over seasoned.. which has turned me off of  commercially made egg nogs  in the past.  I used Bacardi white rum, may try some other rums in this in the future.  This recipe is aptly named " Amazingly good " .  This will definitely be a holiday tradition at our house from now on.

I've never been too crazy about eggnog, but my husband loves it. I often throw out the yolks when I make omelets, so this seemed like a win-win.  Perhaps not as good as store-bought, but my husband still liked it. I've made it without rum, we aren't big drinkers. I used Stevia in place of sugar one time, could hardly tell the difference. I also added a little more of the spices- I like eggnog spice-y. Great recipe.

I've made this for about the last 3-4 years now. It's a hit. People just love it. I follow the recipe to the T, except for the rum. I use about half, just to get the flavor in there with just a hint of "sting".  ;-)  We also like to top off with just a splash of brandy when it's served in the glass.  Well done, it will be our go-to eggnog recipe for years to come.

I followed this recipe exactly right up until we hit the booze. (6 Months pregnant :D) I left it out and letting partner spike his own with the rum instead so that I can share it too and still be responsible ;). 
This turned out absolutely beautifully. Absolutely stunning this will be a recipe bought out year after year for sure.

After reading some of the other reviews I decided to also make my Eggnog in a double boiler.  I have never really used a double boiler but after 30 min of waiting for my milk to boil i decided to just pour the milk in a regular pot and it boiled with in the minute.  Separating 12 eggs is a pain especially when you start losing a few!  Once pouring the sugar and egg mixture into milk mixture it started to thicken with in 3 minutes.  I usually always follow the directions and try to use the same ingredients, but this time I wanted to make a virgin eggnog for my son, he loves eggnog and one with rum for the adults so had to separate into 2.

To keep things flowing I used my egg beaters to beat the yolks. Then I added the sugar. Beat on low then with a ladle I poured the milk mixture into the bowl down the sides of the bowl into the mixture to prevent any cooking of the eggs. Yes you may get some frothing but its all good. Added the remaining ingredients mixing. Then I  used my large canning jars and poured mixture into this. I also used some Christian brothers egg nogg brandy, half cup to 3 of my containers. Shook and in the fridge for the holidays. I am drinking some now. Yes, this is much better then store bought. Now what to do with the whites.

I'm not a fan of eggnog, and I LOVED this. I had to make this for only 3 servings rather than 12, but I am so happy I made this.

Made this to be used in another recipe, but it tastes so good I decided to save some for myself! I had 6 yolks left over from making meringues, so I used those and 3 whole eggs instead of the full dozen yolks. I also used half the cream because I didn't have enough on hand, and I'm glad I did - it was just the right amount of richness. Had I used the full amount of rum, though, it may have needed that extra cream. I followed other reviewers' advice and cut back on the sugar by 1/4 (though I also think the full amount would be appropriate for that much alcohol). Added extra cinnamon and vanilla to taste and served warm with peppermint meringues on the side. Perfect!

Very tasty but thin. I followed the recipe to a T and it came out the consistency of milk. I am used to thick egg nog from the store. Any ideas of why this happened or is it always thin with the recipe?

Very good eggnog.   I did cut the sugar by %25 and next time will cut the cinnamon a little bit, too.  This is a great eggnog for the holidays.

I only had eggnog once before making this recipe and it was store bought and 'yuck'. This recipe turned out very nice on my first attempt and has been designated a 'keeper' in our household. 
My version had only a cup + half of rum which turned out to be about right when compared to the volume of other ingredients combined as otherwise it would have been very (too) potent indeed!

I'll make this again! It was perfect--just enough spice and rum, and a light egg flavour. Like the one I loved best--made by my mom and g'mom many years ago.
At last, an eggnog recipe that matches my memories.
I did whip the egg whites and add them at serving time--I'm not sure I'll do that again, the frothiness wasn't exactly right.

I just left out the rum and found it tasted like cinnamon toast crunch, did anyone else have that issue? I will probably half the cinnamon if not more. Will make again for sure

First time ever making eggnog and this recipe was so easy to follow and it came out so delicious. I even added a cup more milk and made my own light cream. I love clove so I kept those in and it taste AMAZINGLY GOOD!! Kids loved it too (no rum or alcohol of course).

Great with and without the rum. Don’t cook it over heat too long once you mix the hot milk and egg/sugar mixture together. The eggs will cook very quickly if you heat it too long and you be left with scrambled eggs in milk. Not quite as good that way.

I have made this several times over the past two years. Now, I have never really liked eggnog and made it originally for a Thanksgiving party. The host was a big fan of eggnog but her husband, like me , does not traditionally care for it either.  I substituted half of the rum with fireball whiskey and the result was unreal! The two non eggnog drinkers finished the majority of the first batch and a made another the next night.  I still don't like regular eggnog but this recipe is truly amazing!

Delicious! Only changes I made were using heavy cream and whole milk because I didn't have light cream and I only used 1 cup of Captain Morgan spiced rum per batch.  Turned out amazing.  I will probably make this every year now.

Made it with fresh Goats Milk and fresh eggs.   I used 8 cups of raw fresh Goats Milk instead of the milk and cream called for.

Will definitely make again.

I've been making this eggnog for the holidays for the past 5 years, and it's always appreciated. 
I like the fact that the eggs are cooked.
I follow the recipe pretty much to the letter, the only changes are slightly less sugar, and will adapt the amount of rum depending on the audience, but the recipe it's totally versatile and one can easy adjust the quantity of alcohol depending on your personal taste.

This is an INCREDIBLE recipe! It was my first time making eggnog, and the only thing I did differently is I left out the rum. I am not normally a fan of eggnog, but I made this for my husband who is crazy about it. I will definitely make this again, and maybe try it with 1 cup of sugar instead of 1.5 cups, as others have suggested.

Smooth, tasty and delicious.  I do double the spices (but we like things spicy). I also leave out the rum and let people add it to their liking.  I make it every Christmas, no matter where I am.

My family thought this was delicious! We didn't add any rum (just 1 tsp of rum extract) and we didn't have light cream so we used heavy cream and milk. Would have preferred it a little thicker (maybe light cream would have done that) Our mixture curdled a little at the end so we sent it through a blender one more time and it was perfectly smooth!

I loved this recipe it was very delicious but i did make a few changes. Instead of using 4 cups of light cream i used 4 cups of heavy cream and added  5 cups of milk instead of 4...the cloves gave it amazing flavor along with the vanilla and nutmeg.. I will definitely make this again and the next time try it with some rum. i know it'd be great! I give this 5 stars

I would make it again but I have a question.  After I whipped the egg yolks and added the milk mixture everything was fine.  However once I placed it in a saucepan to simmer the eggs got cooked.  Any tips to avoid that or what did I do wrong?

I made this for Christmas the past two years, and both times it turned out great. 

Xmas 2014 I was living in Japan and finding egg nog in the grocery store was impossible. This recipe helped me get in the Christmas spirit so far away from home. It's a great recipe and only improves when left in the fridge for a couple of days.

I have been making this eggnog for several years now.  It is my go-to for eggnog.  I leave the rum out since I serve to children but it is perfect every time.  Thank you for sharing!

Only have it at 3 stars right now because I just made it. It was really easy to make, didn't add the rum since kids will be drinking this also but it's going to be one of our New Year's Eve drinks. I'll let you know how it goes! Made a batch and a half to get to a gallon and followed one reviewer on whipping the egg whites and adding it in. Looks and smells delicious

When I attempted to mix the eggs back into the other ingredients over the stove, the eggs cooked and became solid even though the temperature was set appropriately.

Awesome eggnog recipe. However, I did not add the rum as I felt the amount was too much and I was serving this to kids. I did add brandy to my glass. It was delish!

I've made this a couple times now and I followed the recipe exactly, this is soo much better than storebought! I usually add rum to it when I drink it so I can have some during breakfast without getting liquored :)
Although i substituted 1/4tsp of ground cloves for the whole ones

I can attest to it being "amazingly good".  I'm on my fifth batch tonight, (fifth batch over the last week) as I have to have it for Christmas.  One batch I overcooked and had to throw out.  All the rest were delicious.

I left out the rum so the kids could enjoy it.

I make this every year. It is the best eggnog ever. None of my family will drink store-bought eggnog any more! I've had friends and relatives offer to pay me to make gallons of this for their holiday gatherings. I especially love that the eggs are cooked. If you like yours creamier, you can use heavy cream and add more rum. Delicious!

Very good! I cooked it too long the first time, second time was perfect and tasted great. 
I prefer the "Eggnog I" recipe on this website a little more though.

I made this, used approx. 1 cup of rum and we loved it. I also used homemade vanilla from brandy & beans and fresh large brown eggs. I add this because the yolks are quite a bit larger than store bought. The only trouble I had was in making my husband wait after he had sip tasted it. I will keep this recipe and use it again. I would love to hear from anyone using alternative sweeteners.

Just made some, really good just minutes after.  Going to let the rest age and see how it is then.....I changed the technique a little - it seemed tedious to add the eggs as directed.  Instead,  added eggs to the milk along with the sugar and kept whisking while it heated - like making pudding.  Removed from heat as soon as it started bubbling and kept whisking with the pan in a dish of ice water, it was cool in about 5 minutes..  Came out perfect.  May try  letting the mixture thicken a little next time before removing from heat.  Also whipped the whites to stiff peaks and folded in.  Left the sugar alone, it was jusr right.....I normally decrease the amounts when trying a recipe for the first time, so for this, only made enough for  2.  I will definitely be making more for when the family gets in on  xmas eve.  If you have an aversion to eating raw eggs, this recipe is a great alternative.   Definitely a keeper.

I have tried practically every eggnog out there. I honestly can say I HATE eggnog BESIDES this recipe! It takes quite awhile to make and you have to add into account that it must sit over night (or at least 6 hrs) but it is worth it. I have been making this every Christmas for the past few years and now it has become a staple in our Christmas drinks. I know if I dont make it; its going to be a long, long year for me! lol I hope you enjoy this as much as we do

We found this recipe on this site 4 years ago and have made it every Christmas since. Our families are big eggnog lovers and since we found this recipe it has become my husband and I's job to make it every year!   It is a new tradition and we always make several batches. Two batches for all of the kids and Two batches for all of the grown ups.  It is sooooo good!!!!!

I used half & half instead of milk and light cream just because that's what I had on-hand. Substituted a mixture of brandy, bourbon and rum (2cups) for a little flavor enhancement. This recipe is AWESOME! Thanks for sharing it.

Loved the recipe, no problem with the amount of rum! I used spiced brown rum, I love that flavour better. And fresh vanilla bean pods. 
Ok I also added a star anice pod...

Great recipe!  I make it every year but I swap out light cream for heavy cream, which allows me to use 50% more rum. I add as much allspice as cloves.  Also, a third of the sugar I use is brown sugar.  I make my own rum for it now, but previously I used Sailor Jerry's, which turned out perfect.

I have been making this eggnog for the last five years. I follow the recipe, but leave out the rum so kids can enjoy, and adults can add alcohol to their personal preference. I have people asking when I'm making it every year. "Best eggnog ever!" My family and friends now refuse to drink any other eggnog. I use the egg whites for meringue cookies. Try it, you won't be disappointed.

I did make a few changes... I whipped the egg whites to soft peaks and stirred them into the thickened, slightly cooled egg yolks and cream, and left out the rum so folks could add a shot of what they wanted.  I  am a Bourbon guy, so substituted it for the Rum. This is now my go to egg nog recipe. Thanks!

It was good, but not worth the effort for me. We get same quality from the store with so much less effort and cost. I curdled the first batch, then success on the second try. I will not make again, unless I move to Belgium where eggnog does not exist.

As I write, it is cooling on the counter.   I used half and half and no rum.  I don't like alcohol in my eggnog.  My hubby will probably add some to his tomorrow when it is cool.  It DOES taste delicious!

I made this exactly as directed (four times so far) and it is always so amazingly good!  I do share with friends and family that come over during the holidays, but I have to admit, it is a wee bit grudgingly, since I know it will go fast.

To make and serve in about two hours: 
Pour the warm mixture into a pitcher before adding the cream and rum, and sit the pitcher in a sink of ice water.  Once my pot cooled, I put the mixture back in the pot and the pot back in the ice-bath.  (Metal conducts better, but I didn't want to waste the ice on warm metal).  My pot was larger than the pitcher, so I added the final ingredients then, and was ready to go!

Less sugar: I used one cup of sugar instead of 1 1/2 per batch, as suggested by others, and it was just right.

Non-alcohol version: I would use less cream, because it comes out very thick without the alcohol.

Our family agrees--this is the best egg nog we've ever had! The amount of rum is perfect. Wouldn't change a thing. Thank you!  I didn't have light cream, so I used half and half and heavy cream equally. Great holiday treat!!! Can't wait until next year!

delicious! a little on the sweet side for my personal taste, but still good :) also i added only a 1/4 of the rum initially (i used a dark rum, not light) as it would be too strong for some of my family, and more can always be added as its served ;)

I made this recipe last Christmas with & without the rum (because of all the pregnant mommies & little ones) for Christmas morning at my boyfriend's families house an they absolutely loved it! Even the little kids too. My boyfriend's little girl helps me make it.  It's going to be our Christmas eve tradition from now on.

Made it with only 2tbsp brown sugar and 1/4 cup maple syrup, much less cream (maybe 1 cup? eyeballed it), and only a drop or two of Rum extract instead of alcohol... but very tasty!! :) My husband and I LOVE home-made eggnog and using this recipe as our guide did not disappoint!

I love this eggnog. I have cooked this too long before but went ahead and put it in glasses anyway. After it sat for awhile the solids separated from the liquid. So I ended up with a delicious custard on the top and eggnog beneath it.. an awesome mistake.

THANK YOU SO MUCH for creating and posting this recipe! We have been in the UK for 11 years and have missed eggnog each year. I'd never tried anything but the store bought stuff back home and have always found Christmas here to be missing that treat! A friend recommended this recipe and I was pleased to see that it called for cooked yolks. We tried it, without the alcohol (and so reduced the sugar to 1c), and LOVED it! Even my husband, who is not a fan of eggnog, thought it was great. I am so pleased that we can have eggnog again at Christmas!
Also, many people have commented on 'light cream' - it's the same as half and half, or here in England, single cream :)

This recipe is absolutely awesome.  I didn't add rum or spices and it is better than my favourite store bought eggnog. I did have to strain it through a fine sieve as there were a few tiny lumps in it.  I think that may have been caused by my heating element which may have been slightly hotter than what recipe called for.  WHEN COOLING, KEEP LID OFF POT OR IT WILL COOK FURTHER AND CAUSE LUMPS.  I had to throw out small test batch that I made because I tried to cool it with lid on.  I think you have to keep whisking it periodically when cooling too.  Maybe a couple of strainings through extra fine sieve would have worked even better.  It's worth the time and effort.  LOVE LOVE LOVE IT !!!

this is the best eggnog ever.  Some of my family claimed to not like eggnog, but I made them take a sip...then they would fill up their cup.  cut the egg yolks to 8.  Used half and half instead of cream and no rum since children were here.  It was DELICIOUS!!!

Loved this! My mom and dad said they didn't like eggnog, but tried this and were blown away! They said it tasted like liquid pumpkin pie! Thank you for the great recipe! We'll never buy eggnog from the store again!

gave this 4 stars but it was a close run for 5.  I read as many negative reviews as possible before reading to see what people were experiencing.  I truly believe if you use quality ingredients you will get a quality result.  I used local organic whole milk, local organic heavy cream, and Buliett Bourbon (90proof).  I only used 2 cups instead of 2 1/2.  The flavor of the bourbon enhances this drink so much.  And i would never put a clear liquor in this drink.  If i were to use rum i would you Barbados Spiced Rum.  This is a quality dark rum that is very smooth and not too sweet.  That would work well.  Also i had to double the nutmeg, i grated it fresh, maybe thats why it required more.  Anyways this is awesome and i like it so much i decided to make an extra batch to bring to the inlaws for xmas because i think they will all like it so much and want to be sure i get enough.

Yuuum.  As it was my first attempt at making homemade eggnog, I was quite pleased.  Like others, I cut the rum down to about half, one cup was plenty strong for us.  Very rich and smooth!

I normally hate when people rate something 5 stars and then talk about how they changed the recipe - but hey, this is such a good base recipe I had to give credit where credit was due.

I have used this recipe for years but with two big important changes. I omit the alcohol and I double the spices. This way, people can add in the alcohol cup by cup and it is honestly SUCH a good eggnog without the alcohol in the base recipe (with the rum I find it way too strong and not too tasty). It will give you a very thick eggnog but you can use half and half or light cream or add milk to thin it out once it's finished and cooled. 

GREAT recipe otherwise.

Love this recipe! Made it for many international friends while living abroad…they had never tried eggnog before and loved it! I think it works best with a spiced rum (I like Sailor Jerry's), rather than just plain light rum…delicious Christmas in a cup :)

We are Canadians living in Antananarivo, Madagascar, where egg nog is both unavailable in stores, and totally unheard of.  This was our first Christmas here - the tropical setting and lack of North American festivities made it somewhat difficult for us.  We went online to find an egg nog recipe, as we were responsible for bringing something "Canadian" to a party we were attending, and yours was one of the first that popped up!  Not only was the recipe easy to make, it was a total hit with all of the people at the party, whose nationalities ranged from Malagasy, French, South African, Belgian, Dutch, Spanish and Canadian!  Many of the guests were asking me for the recipe, and told me it was one of the best drinks they have ever tasted!  Thanks so much for posting this, and enjoy a happy and healthy New Year!

My husband and I decided to make home made eggnog and this is the recipe we chose. We cut the rum in half and also set 2 cups aside for the 10 yr old!  It is a great recipe, we all agreed on 5 stars

I was a little disappointed with this recipe. The reviews made me very confident in the accurate eggnog taste this recipe would have. I just didn't like it a whole lot. It was a good drink but i didn't think it tasted like eggnog. My family had different views and actually loved the eggnog recipe. My recommendation would be that yes, try the recipe but keep an extra can of eggnog just in case.

After our store ran out of eggnog, I made this using 2% milk and heavy cream. If I can find it next time, I will use light cream for health reasons, but this was very rich, creamy and delicious! I also agree to reduce the sugar to 1 cup. Left out the rum and we used Jack Daniels instead. Perfect!

This was sensational! Having never had eggnog before I wasn't sure what to expect but we all devoured it in no time. We made a non-alcoholic version for the kids and then added a shot each of Baileys Irish cream whiskey to our own cups and it was divine. Next time I am at home for Christmas (in Australia) I'll make it into ice cream so we can still enjoy these amazing flavours.

The first time I made this recipe I curdled the milk and cooked the egg yolks into chunks. We make rice pudding out of it so it wasn't a waste, but I had to hurry and make another batch for Thanksgiving. I left out a cup of rum because I felt it was a lot, and it was still too strong for my taste. This time (the third time) I did not add the rum, and I like it so much better! The only other change I have made it to add more spices, otherwise it tastes a little too much like milk and sugar to me. Me and my family love how sweet it is (it's not terribly sweet, although many people are happy to cut out some of the sugar with good results), and we don't mind the amount of egg yolks, so this recipe really turns out perfect without the rum and more spices!

Just made this today for Christmas Eve... fantastic! We made one batch as recipe stated (but added Captain Morgans Spiced Rum per glass) and made the second batch with unsweetened soy milk for the Lactose sensitive family members. Both were perfectly thick and creamy! I think next time I'll cut the sugar down by at least 1/2 cup, as it was quite sweet. But otherwise, it was perfect... and all the first-time drinkers loved it too!

This was great, made it as is, but upped the recipe to 18 servings. Several people at my party had never tried eggnog before and they all loved it. I will definitely be making this again next year!

Absolutely wonderful! I did cut back on the amount of rum and egg yolks. Instead of 12 I did 8 egg yolks and I used 2 cups of rum. That was enough for my taste. But I absolutely loved it. Everybody that drank it loved it!!
I didn't give it 5 stars because I did cut back on the ingredient amount listed. But overall a wonderful recipe with my changes!!

The best eggnog I've ever had! I followed the recipe except the rum but other then that it was eye brow raising good. I especially like the combination of spices. My family likes their eggnog really fluffy and this pleased all!

Used only 1 Cup sugar, and half the light cream (added extra milk to make up the volume) and it was still nice and thick, creamy and delicious. Wonderful recipe. Will definitely make this again.

Somebody brought this to a potluck and it was incredible, so I decided to make it myself. I used Malibu rum and heavy cream instead of light cream. It was a huge, huge hit and I'm so excited about making it for New Years Eve that I might just make a double batch. It's a lot of work but so totally worth it!

We used 2% for the milk and half & half for the light cream.  We left out the rum and just had folks add brandy when they poured a glass.  The brandy added just the right kick to it.  This one's going to be an annual favorite!

I've started making this a few years ago for Christmas at my in-laws, and every year since then the eggnog has been a big hit! My husband and I usually never drink eggnog (he's occasionally had the store bought version), but he says he will never drink store bought again. I follow the directions, and it turns out great every time. It has become a yearly tradition. Thanks for such an "amazingly" delicious recipe! :)

My first attempt at eggnog! I must have done something wrong though. There are small chunks in the end product.. I think I may have cooked the mixture too much.

However, after sifting it, its pretty good!

I followed the recipe to the letter. I didn't put the rum in until after I'd split the egg nog into two bowls so the kids and Grandpa (who doesn't drink) could have some as well. I didn't listen to the recipe regarding how much rum to put in, I just added it a little at a time until it tasted right to me. Everybody loves it. Excellent recipe!

This eggnog wakes up a Christmas taste memory of what my aunt made when I was a child. It is a 5-star "base" to a wonderful egg-nog recipe that should be tweaked to your own taste preferences.  

Wanting to keep it non-alcoholic, I replaced the rum with a pint of heavy whipping cream, adding 1 cup directly to the nog and whipping the second cup (add sugar a couple of teaspoons of sugar while whipping) to dollop on top.  

To accommodate the add'l richness, I added 5 *more* whole cloves and several shakes more of cinnamon - should have left the cloves at the original 5, but the flavor did mellow as the nog "aged" overnight - won't do it again.  I also cut the sugar back by 1/2 cup.  

Just as a note - if you're not concerned with raw eggs consumption, my aunt would beat the egg whites to a soft peak and add them into the eggnog before serving.  Add a couple of tbls of sugar while beating.

This eggnog is AMAZING!  I served it at our Christmas party last night and got rave reviews.  I should have made more because we quickly ran out.  

 I didn't have light cream so I used half and half with a touch of heavy cream.  Will make this again and again and again.  Thank you for sharing!

This eggnog is only OK.  I have been making eggnog from the "Joy of Cooking " cookbook for many years.  Of course this is better than store bought with all the store bought emulsifiers and preservatives.  But this eggnog lacks the real egg flavor of egg nogs I have made in previous years.  I think cooking the eggs changes or mutes the egg flavor.  I added additional raw yokes but still couldn't get it to taste as good the Joy of Cooking recipes.  but still, it is good.

Delicious! I doubled the recipe, using one quart of heavy cream and one quart of half and half, instead of the light cream. We don't drink alcohol, so I left the rum out. But I did add rum extract for flavor at the end. I used a whole bottle of extract (1 ounce). But I think next time I'll just use half a bottle. I had a little trouble with the eggs starting to clump up, but I quickly used my stick blender--problem solved. I did not need to strain it. I think this will be a new annual recipe.

12 servings = 1500ml = nicely funneled into two 750ml wine bottles. Additionally, the recipe tastes great but I had trouble getting the mixture to thicken at any stage. Almost all other eggnog recipes I found included whisking the egg whites with sugar until fluffy. I would suggest adding at least 6-10 egg whites to this recipe. Still separate the eggs but split the sugar between whisking the egg whites and the yokes. 

I was able to save the completed (runny) egg nog by chilling it overnight and then adding it to 8 whisked egg whites/sugar.

My husband and I both love this recipe!

I'm a wimp when it comes to boiling milk, but other than that, it's actually not too hard. I also agree with the previous comment about tempering the eggs with a little of the milk mixture instead of whisking the whole thing in -- saves a little time.

Advice for the lazy: Instead of straining for smoothness, I just put a stick blender in it at the very end. (I made sure to fish out the cloves first!) It came out smooth and lovely.

After reading the other reviews, I decided to leave the rum out of the recipe then mix it in to taste when the eggnog was served.  I used just a small amount of rum in mine and thought it tasted amazing.  I'm going to make this all year.

Awesome!! I used 1/2 and half for the cream, 2 cups of rum and only cooled it for an hour in the frig. (served over ice cubes). everyone raved about it so much so that if I had a larger container to put it in I would have doubled it! Thank you so much Nataliesmom!

We made this for our traditional Christmas and it was absolutely the greatest!!!   However, we used a sugar substitute for low carb, and it still turned out wonderful.  We will be adding this one to our other holiday recipes.  Thank you!!

This was so amazing. My entire family loved this eggnog. I did only add about half of the rum than is suggested, only because I was scared that the recommended amount would be just a little too strong. Seriously amazing eggnog, though, I was barely able to let it chill overnight because my family tried to drink it all!

Ok, DON"T BELIEVE THE TITLE. I just made it according to the prescribed directions. I have found this too sweet and not impressed by its overall quality. The egggnog is not bad, but it's not great either. I haven't thrown it away but I will go back to the other recipe i used last year called, Eggnog Blend, by Sal. This recipe is easier and definately better tasting and quality.

I'm not a big eggnog person but my hubby is, he has quite the eggnog addiction one could say.  Well he tried this and truly was 'amazed' at how yummy it was. No substitutions or changes needed in this recipe.  Follow it to a 'T', you can't go wrong!

WOW... the flavor is amazing but BOY O BOY is it strong.  Like the other reviews, I would suggests cutting back on the rum.  Just because its a little overwhelming... and I am not a light weight.  Other than that its perfect.

Followed everything except the rum. And it was delicious. A definite keeper, especially for those who can't stand raw eggs.

This is my first review,  because normally the recipes turn out wonderful. But for some reason, this egg nog did not smell... taste.. or even look like egg nog. My egg nog did not boil, and it still curdled. I followed the recipe to a "T" and it still came out horrible. I felt like there wasn't even a small taste to it that tasted anything like egg nog. If you are going for the "real" egg nog taste... this recipe is not the one for you.

I made this last year and it was a HUGE hit.  Even the kids drank it, and they never drink store bought egg nog.  I think this year I will have to triple the recipe.  I make it without rum and let adults add their own to taste.

This stuff is SOOO GOOD!  I have never had homemade eggnog before *because I didn't think I would like it due to the fact that I can't stand store bought* but it was extremely good with some spiced captain morgans rum.  My husband who loves most eggnog, absolutely LOVED it.  He started drinking it on Christmas morning, and by dinner it was gone!  I had 2 small cups, and hubby had the rest.

This has become a tradition! Last year, I also poured it into Frappucino bottles and gave it as part of a gift :) 
We do not include rum, though.

I made a batch of for a small Christmas party thinking that, since eggnog is so rich, people would only want a small glass each.  Instead, I ran out in the first 30 minutes.  Everyone agreed that it was delicious.  I never drink store-bought egg nog because eggs sort of gross me out, but I thought this stuff was unbelievable.  (I would like to note that separating 12 eggs was disgusting.)  Also, if I would have put in the prescribed amount of alcohol, it would be way too strong (and I'm no prohibitionist).  I put in a small amount and let people add additional rum if they wanted.

So good! We were in the England and realized that they do not have egg nog here, so we decided to make it for the first time using this recipe.  We ended up making it twice.  It is really rich and tastes delicious.  We didn't add the rum to the recipe.  That way we could add it to the individual glasses depending on what each person wanted.  Good with and without the rum!  Will make again, even in Canada.

This Egg Nog is awesome!  I took it to a Christmas Eve party and there was none left over.  I should have doubled the recipe.  Its not super thick like store bought and had delicous flavor. Thank you!

I never liked eggnog as a kid so I never drank it. So when I made this eggnog for my husband (that always like the stuff)I wasnt sure what it was supposed to taste like because I dont remember the flavor of the store bought stuff my mom used to get. After one sip from my husband he said "this is what I always thought good eggnog should taste like!" Enough said. Good stuff.

Made this yesterday with a few alterations.  My husband chose for us to use 1 cup Jack Daniels and 1 cup Bacardi light Rum.  I also whipped the egg whites till frothy and folded them into the finished eggnog.  Not sure I like the clove flavor...we may leave that out next time.  I tempered the egg yolks before adding to the hot milk mixture.  We had no problems with curdling.

Awesome Eggnog ! I have made 4 batches this Christmas season. Everyone liked it. I wouldn't change a thing. However, I did have a few requests for less Rum. But, I think it is perfect !

I made the mistake of making this eggnog.....and sharing it. I guess that was two mistakes lol. Now they either want the recipe or want me to make more of it. I've made it with heavy cream, and with coconut rum, both options work out very well. I've also left some without rum, that works well also. I honestly don't see how you can mess up this recipe. At first I thought I did, because the milk kind of scalds on the bottom of the pan, if it's not a heavy pan, but it works out fine. Again, i think this is a fool proof recipe! Even non eggnog drinkers love it

This was delicious but a bit too much after a large Chinese meal on New Year's Eve. Living in the UK, we can't get eggnog but this reminded me exactly of what I used to get in the shops back home (and reminded my boyfriend of an eggnog milkshake he had 20 years ago). I used whole milk and double cream (Christmas does come only once a year) and it came out perfectly thick. I also followed another reviewers suggestion and added the hot milk mixture to the yolk mixture a spoonful at a time so as not to "cook" the yolks. Perfect!

Really great eggnog, i liked the fact that the base is cooked. I made it according to the recipe and after letting it chill for 24 hours, we felt it needed a bit more of a kick so I did add 1 cup of brandy and 1 cup of VO(canadian whiskey). Big hit I will be my annual eggnog recipe.

My family had been avoiding eggnog for quite a while but this one changed their mind. Really nice...only change was used whole egg instead of just the yolks and halved the cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon.

Gets rave reviews from all eggnog lovers, and even converts some who think they are opposed to the beverage. Just be careful not to cook too long, or you'll end up with scrambled eggs floating in milk.

It DOES get better with age!  Used only 1.5 cups rum.  I put it in a glass pitcher with a lid so I can shake it up before pouring.  I went and bought more ingredients so we can make a second batch when we go to visit family later this week.

I don't drink eggnog but I made this for friends and family for xmas eve.  Everyone loves it!  It was very easy to make.  To keep the eggs from coagulating, I chilled the egg and sugar mixture in the freezer for a bit.  I then added the warm liquid with a ladle.  Worked great. Thank you.

Amazing eggnog. I didn't add the rum that the recipe called for, and my grocery store was out of light cream, so I used heavy whipping cream. It was still wonderful. Unfortunately, this means that I will have to make this for my husband many many times a year. :)

This past Christmas is the third time I have made this eggnog.  It is divine.  I cut the recipe in half and leave out the rum so that it can be added to individual servings.  This keeps quite a long time in the fridge since the eggs are cooked.  Yesterday I used the remainder to make French toast - it was delicious!!

Ok, I have never left a review but this stuff was so good, I had to write. Made both a "leaded" and "unleaded" version for our Christmas Bunko group and both got rave reviews! The only change I made was to reduce the rum to 1 1/2 cups for the "leaded" version and it seems to be just the right amount.  Will be making this again for Christmas Eve dinner.  Thanks so much for the recipe...it is a keeper!

FANTASTIC! i made this for a party and it was a huge hit! I used skim milk and half-and-half, and I tempered the eggs with the hot milk mixture a little at a time. I didn't add any rum to the actual mixture, I just had brandy & rum available if people wanted to add it to their beverage. Multiple people told me they don't like store bought egg nog but loved this!

I used skim milk and then homogenized instead of the milk/cream and it was still fantastic! I didn't use Rum because it's for my kids but the rest of the recipe I followed exactly. Sooooooo good, I will be making this all the time instead of buying it now.

This eggnog was delicious, with two caveats - the first time I made it, I was "tasting" it quite a bit before adding the rum, which actually ended up making it undrinkable. I ended up dumping it out and making it again the next day sans rum - YUM! Also, on its own it comes a little too thin for my tastes so I add a tablespoon or two of cornstarch to make it a little thicker.

If this recipe called for 1/2 the booze I would have ranked it a 5.  After reading several reviews I cut back the alcohol by 1/2, other than that I made this just like the recipe stated.

I tasted this soon after making it and it was good.  By 24 hours it was better, and by 48 hours it was really good.  So make this at least one day ahead, two if possible.

If you like a strong alcohol taste, go ahead and make it full strength.  If you like a lighter alcohol taste, cut it in half.

Next time I will try some spiced rum.

I made this for a party I was having and some people liked it and some didn't.  I had a lot left over at the end of the night. I didn't really like the flavor much; not very "egg-nog-y."  I tried another recipe later and I liked it much more.

This was my first time ever making eggnog. I was upset last night when I made it and I didn't read the recipe properly. I mixed the cream with the milk in the beginning of the recipe. Oh well. I decided to continue on and took it to work with me the next day. Despite my mishap everyone loved it. My co-workers were asking me for the recipe. I have to say it was still good and I will make this again, only when I'm in a good mood. ;)

This is absolutely delicious!!! I did not have a problem with the eggs curdling, I just followed the directions to the "T" and it turned out wonderfully!! The only thing I didn't like is that it didn't make that much. Also it was pretty thick so I added whole milk to mine to thin it out and by doing that I got more eggnog out of the recipe. So many great perks!! Will make again for christmas but this time I will definatly double the recipe!!

I cant tell you enough how GREAT this recipe was, I have been wanting to make homemade eggnog for several years now, but concerned of the time involved and wasted ingredients if it turned out poorly, but I made this 2 nights ago just a small batch drank it plain and with my coffee "Eggnog Latte" and it is so good i'm making it again today to sure with family tomorrow, Thanks for the awesome recipe!

My son loves eggnog (or 'eggnock' as he says it!) and I love eggnog lattes so this is our go-to recipe since we can't buy eggnog off-season.  I have made this recipe at least 3 times (sans rum, obviously!).  Not the healthiest drink around... but definitely a good one if you like eggnog and can pace yourself.

You will never buy store bought again!!!!
It is somewhat labor intensive, but well worth the effort. My co-workers start hounding me in October with their requests. I make it by the gallon during the holidays. Don't try multi-tasking while making this eggnog. The eggs can overcook in an instant (Trust me!)You will be starting over from scratch.

I made this for Christmas and it was fantastic! The only thing I would do differently is make it the night before - it really is best when chilled overnight. It's now a Christmas recipe keeper!

Very nice and thick eggnog.  Not something to drink everyday, but a nice splurge!  I had a bit of trouble with it curdling on me (my fault - I let it get too hot), but a quick spin in the blender fixed it right up.  Thanks!

I hate eggnog, but this was pretty good! I took it to a family Christmas dinner and everyone was raving about it. My MIL wouldn't let me bring the leftovers home! Hubby bought a carton from the store the next day and couldn't even drink it because it wasn't as good as the homemade.

This was my first time making eggnog and this recipe was perfect. Everyone enjoyed it and the rum can easily be added as needed. We used 2 cups instead of 2 and 1/2 but really you can be very flexible because the rest of the ingredients work together very well. Make sure it is well-chilled and this is a perfect Holiday treat with dessert!

This was my first attempt at home made egg nog and the results were fabulous!  Before I added the rum, I set aside 1 quart of the mixture for a virgin eggnog as we were having lots of children for Christmas.  To the remaining mixture I added 1 cup of rum and it was absolutely strong enough.  Any more would have overpowered the fabulous flavor of the eggnog.  This one is spectacular, give it a try.

Always good stuff.  I have found that a nice spiced rum works perfectly with the spices.  I use Captain Morgan but I am sure anything would work.

Very yummy!  I had a slight problem with my eggs curdeling the milk, so I took the suggestion of placing it in the blender and it worked like a charm.  Also, we used 1 cup of Spiced Rum and it was perfect - I think the 2 cups the recipe calls for would be overkill.

This was delicious!  I gave it a 4 because it seemed like a lot of work for a small amount of product.  I didn't add the rum so that kept the quantity low.  Everyone had about a half a cup and though they went on and on about how good it was, no one (me included) wanted anymore because it was so rich and filling.

I gave this 4 stars because this eggnog was above average but not perfect. It wasn't really that difficult to make either. It was much thinner than I expected, but I have grown up drinking the store bought stuff.

Those years of experimentation really paid off. I'd never made homemade eggnog before because most recipes I found use raw eggs, so when I found this one I thought I'd give it a try. It was worth the effort. The only change I made was to use half & half instead of light cream, only because I bought the half & half by accident. The one thing I will do different in the future will be to decrease the sugar to 1 cup. It was just a little too sweet for me.

My Dad and I had an eggnog cook-off. It was both of our first times making eggnog. I used this recipe and Dad used Alton Brown's (food network). Mine won hands-down! I love this recipe and will definitely be making it again soon! Thanks!

This was great and SIMPLE!  Even those with little or no cooking skills could make this.  I only had 2 cups of white rum so topped it off with spiced rum and it was wonderful.  I have made the same cooked eggnog recipe since the early 70's and it is great but laborious---this is such a cinch that I will make it more often.

This recipe is amazing. I didn't mess up the cooking so was brilliant. Was a little sweet so may use a third less sugar next time (I'm making it again tonight) but all in all was amazing.
I used a couple of splashes of Captain Morgans Dark Rum.
Superb!

Update!
Did it again this year after OH requested it - perfect again. I only used 1 cup of sugar which I think works great! I love this recipe and it is definately going in my recipe book at home!

I've got to say....I'm benefiting from your years in search of the perfect eggnog!  I made a batch tonight for sipping on Christmas Eve and it has the perfect amount of sugar, seasoning and creaminess!  The only thing I changed was the amount of rum that I put in: I used 1 c Appleton rum and 1/2 c Captain Morgan's spiced.  Perfection :)

Instead of rum, as I distaste the substance, I used a very pale ale. (Blue Moon if you must know.) and heavy cream for the light, using the ale to thin as needed.  I didn't do the clove thing as I dislike cloves.

I give it an A+

This was the first recipe I tried from allrecipes and the first time I made my own eggnog and all I can say is WOW!  I made it exactly as written but reduced the rum by 1/2 a cup and it was perfect.  I served it at a Christmas party last night and it was gone within the first hour and people were asking if I had any more.  I will be making this every year for sure!

This was the first egggnog I have ever made so I don't really have anything to compare it to.  It tasted very good and was easy to make.  After I drank a glass of it I was so full I was unable to eat or drink anything else for a couple hours.
