Excellent! Use low-sodium broth, though.  It is very salty.  I boiled the chicken for 10 minutes and then cut into bite-sized pieces.  The chicken finished cooking in the oven.  I also used the Pepperidge Farm stuffing and I used the whole bag. (14 oz or so.  There is no seasoning mix with the bagged variety.  I added the TINIEST bit of poultry seasoning to mine and stirred well.)  Be sure to use extra broth.  (I used the whole can.)  As others have stated--it IS necessary to cover for most of the baking time.  I uncovered for the last 15 minutes.  Just as good with less cheese.  I also used reduced-fat soups and couldn't tell the difference.

Forgot to add the cheese the last time I made it until I had already put the stuffing on top of everything!  I ended up putting the shredded cheese over the cubed stuffing and I put the cover on the casserole lightly and cooked as usual.
We liked the result even better than the usual way which was cheese under the bread crumbs so we'll be doing it this way from
now on.  My husband absolutely loves this recipe with sliced mushrooms and chopped broccoli.  I also add carrots and sometimes celery for more texture and color.

I thought this was good. I used 2 cans cream of chicken soup and didn't boil my chicken. I used reduced sodium broth and 1/2 of a 14oz bag Pepperidge Farms herb stuffing( no seasoning bag comes with this).I still thought it was way to salty. I'm not an expert,but it seems to me that the saltiness was coming from the herb seasoning. Next time I will use plain stuffing and if you use herb seasoning packet,try using only half of it.Maybe this would help in cutting back on the saltiness of this. I made with some frozen chopped spinach and put some sauce on top and it was wonderful. I bet it would be good on potatoes too.I will make again with these changes and hope it helps because it really is a tasty dish.Thanks Stephanie!

This was really tasty.  I made a couple changes:  I used thin chicken and didn't boil it first.  Not necessary.  I cut up a head of broccoli, blanched it quickly, and put it in a layer over the chicken.  I used Pepperidge Farm stuffing moistened with the rest of the can of chicken broth.  Also used Cheddar Cheese.  Very tasty!!!!

This was very good!  My husband is not into casserole dishes that much and he had seconds! One word of caution though... I am a salt lover but even this was too salty for me.  Next time I will use low sodium soups. Also, I cooked the chicken with a little bit of oil instead of boiling.  I used a cup of milk to mix the soups and one cup of broth to mix the stuffing.  This goes great with a side of asparagus or broccoli.

My mother-in-law made this dish first, and it was extremely salty.  I altered the recipe by using unseasoned chicken (cooked in plain water) and by using water in place of the chicken broth, and used cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella.  This cut way down on the salty taste.  Next time I will either cover the baking dish, or perhaps layer the soups over the top of the stuffing to keep it moist.  We all enjoyed this very much!

Great recipe! I added another box of stuffing and added about 2 cups of water to the 1/2 cup chicken broth because I didn't think there would be enough liquid to absorb into the stuffing. I went about a 1/2 cup too much but it still turned out fine. Great taste and pretty quick and easy too! Much better recipe than what is on the back of the StoveTop box. Thanks!

This recipe was so easy and tasted great! I baked covered for 30 minutes then uncovered for 20 minutes and it came out perfect. I will use more stuffing next time. Definitely a keeper.

With most of my family being under the weather with winter viruses this was a nice and easy . I did add cheddar cheese like other reviews had mentioned and did cover with foil for the first  half of the cooking time. I added a little more liquid to keep the stuffing more moist.I also served gourmet sweetpotaos and a salad of baby greens.thanks for the delicious recipe. ps. cube or cut chicken into smaller pieces,it will be easier to serve.

This is a fast, easy & very tasty one! 5-stars!! Glad I read prior reviews. I used what I had handy; low sodium crm of chicken & low sodium cream of chicken & mushroom soups & low sodium chicken broth. Also I used a 12 oz can of chicken Stovetop Stuffing (which is salty enough by itself). Didn't boil chickn 1st. Baked covered at 375 for first 25 minutes and uncovered for last 20 minutes to crisp up top of stuffing. GREAT FLAVOR. My husband and I finished the entire casserole within 48 hours. Great leftovers!!! Thanks Stephanie for the great recipe!! This will become one of our regulars!

This chicken is excellent. I used 2 cans of cream of chicken as I didn't have any cream of celery. I also didn't have enough mozz cheese and I will definately add more next time. The stuffing was a great topping and my husband loved it. I will definately be making this again!

This recipe was quite good.  Both my husband & my oldest son loved it (my son is a VERY picky eater).  I just didn't see any need to boil the chicken prior to cooking in the oven & it came out just fine.  I also did not cook in strips; instead, I cut up the chicken into cube sized pieces.  It wasn't as salty as the other reviewers suggested since I used a low sodium chicken broth.  However, next time I think that I will also use a low sodium cream of chicken & low sodium cream of mushroom (I used cream of mushroom soup instead of the cream of celery soup).  I will definitely make this again!!  Thanks Stephanie!!!

My husband gave this recipe a 2 thumbs up!  I thought the stuffing got a little too crunchy, though (and I even covered it with foil for the last 1/2 of the cooking time).  Next time I will add more liguid to the stuffing and possibly cover with foil for the entire cooking time.  Also, note that when you convert this to full page, etc., for printing it changes the amount of chicken from 2 lbs. to 5 oz.

This recipe was a huge hit with me and my boyfriend.  Alot of people said it was quite salty, we quite enjoyed that part of it.  We did not find it too salty at all.  We will definately be making this one over and over again.

Yum!  We put carrots, mushrooms, and broccoli in it to make it healthier and a whole meal.  We had leftovers too, which somehow were even better!  We put the stuffing mix as the top layer (as prescribed) but it got a little burnt, so you might want to put in lower in the casserole or keep an eye on it.  Try this!

This is a great recipe! Both my fiance and myself loved it! I recommend using more than one package/box of stuffing, and maybe one more can of soup to make it a little more moist.

Very yummy and easy!  However, I don't understand why it says to boil the chicken first and then cook it for 45 min. until no longer pink.  Why no longer pink, if it's already cooked?  I just put in raw chicken strips and it turned out perfect.

This was great!  I did tweak it a bit.  I didn't precook the chicken but did cut it into the strips.  Instead of two cans of soup, I only used one can of cream of mushroom soup, and a generous glop (I'd guess 1/2 cup) of sour cream, plus low-sodium broth, minced garlic, and black pepper.  I added frozen broccoli spears above the sauce layer, shredded cheddar on top of the broccoli (didn't have any mozzarella on hand), and then topped with the stuffing and rest of the can of broth.  I covered it for about the first 40 minutes (I just use a cookie sheet upside down over the pan) and uncovered for the last 20.  Let it sit a bit before serving the sauce will thicken up.  My picky 5-year-old cleaned his plate and my 7-year-old had seconds.

This was pretty good.  I didn't precook the chicken, just used half breast as they were, added some broccoli over the chicken, poured the sauce over all, continued with the recipe and baked 375F for 45 minutes.

Simple and easy- just the way you like it on a hot summer's evening.  I halved the recipe and used one whole box of Pepperidge Farm Stuffing- and it wasn't enough! (We love stuffing.) So one box to double the recipe would definitely not be enough.  Overall, it is very, good.

I agree with the other reviewers that the sodium could be cut down on this one.And maybe add more cheese or a mixture of cheeses. I used pepperidge farm stuffing and had more than enough. I may mix it with a little more broth next time to make it more moist. This is definitly a great comfort food recipe!!

My two teenage boys didn't care for it. I thought it was allright, but my husband absolutely loved it. He said I can make it anytime. He pretty much gobbled up the whole pan. I used two boxes of stuffing mix, and boy is this recipe easy to make.
A nice fast meal. Maybe my kids will give it a second chance.

I layered sliced vegetables (zucchini, carrots and green pepper) over the layer of chicken, then prepared as recommended.  It was delicious--no need for side dishes--it's a whole meal in one!

I wasn't really sure about cooking the chicken with the stuffing, but when it was done, it looked and tasted absolutely delicious.  It was a quick and easy meal too..Thanks!!

I used cheddar instead of mozzarella and cream of mushroom instead of cream of celery just because I know my family's preferences.  It was really good and has been added to our menu.

I changed this some based on what I had on hand. I used 2 medium sized chicken breasts and one can of soup and one box stuffing. To make it creamier and to make up for some of the soup I was lacking I used 1/4 cup reduced fat sour cream and 1/4 cup evaporated milk. I also used the broth from the chicken when I boiled it. ( I added s&p and garlic to it while it boiled.) I omitted the cheese because I didnt have it. This is an amazing casserole. I dont think my changes made a huge difference in the overall outcome. Everyone ate it and my husband insisted I save him the leftovers. very cheap to make I figured I had about 4.00 in the entire thing and it served 3 adults with about 2 servings left over. Great with pan fried bacon green beans and crescent rolls. This will DEFINITELY make it into my rotation. I think this would be excellent with frozen peas stirred in right before baking. Thanks.

This was ok. I think it would have tasted better with cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of celery soup.

SIX STARS!  I made a few minor changes and it still came out great!  I simmered diced carrots, celery, onions and mushrooms along with herbs & seasonings in water with the chicken pieces for about 10 minutes, transferred the meat & veggies to the baking pan and used the leftover liquid (instead of chicken broth) to slightly moisten the stuffing.  Layered the stuffing onto meat/veg. Note: half the stuffing cubes were seasoned, the other half wasn't, so there were no complaints about it being too salty.  I didn't have quite enough cheese, but I mixed it in with the soup mixture & poured that over the meat & bread.  Baked it covered for 25 mins, then uncovered for another 20.  Yummy!  This is an awesome base recipe.  I'll experiment with other vegetables, like broccoli, mixed or asparagus.  THANKS!!

This recipe is sooooooooooooooooooo good. I made if for a family gathering and everyone loved it! I lost the copy of my recipe to my mother-in-law. I would add some veggies to it next time but it was really good already. Also, add more stuffing to the top. Yummy.

Wow!!  This was so easy and quick to make and it tastes DELICIOUS!!  I will definitley make this over and over again!  I used the cheddar cheese instead of mozzerella. I also cooked uncovered for 20 mins, covered with foil and then cooked for an additional 30 mins.  It came out perfectly!  I love this recipe!!

I was kind of sceptical about this recipe once I placed it in the oven, but OMG it was delicious! My hubby and kids aren't big on stuffing..but everyone gobbled this up! For my large family I'll need to double the recipe and may try the pre-cooked carving board chicken breast. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Another one from AllRecipes that my kids loved.  Next time I make this I will just add the stuffing in with the rest of the ingredients instead of just sprinkling it on top.  This makes very yummy leftovers (if your lucky enough to have any!).  Great recipe!

This was good. Used cream of mushroom instead of cream of celery. Next time I will try chedder cheese like some of the others. Watch the stuffing, need to cover at least 1/2 way through cooking time.

I really loved this dish! My mom was visiting, and is now insisting I make this when she comes down over the Holidays! The only thing I did differently was to saute the chicken, which I had cut into cubes, in a small amount of olive oil just till no longer pink. Plus, I used a little more chicken broth than called for, but was otherwise true to the recipe. Excellent!

This was so good and comforting!  I made only 1/2 the recipe with 2 chicken breasts cut in bite size pieces.  I also added a head of broccoli, which I steamed for five minutes and then cut into small pieces.  I used one can of cream of chicken soup with herbs and about only a 1/2 C of cheese.  Tasty!

My husband loved this casserole.  I did cut the chicken breasts up into 1" pieces and seasoned them with Mrs. Dash in the bottom of the pan, and I used chicken broth flavored with Garlic.  I also added a layer of frozen green beans and corn on top of the soup mixture before adding the cheese and mixed my stuffing with a 1/2 cup chicken broth and 1/2 cup of water.  I will be making this again definitely, but I will use 2 boxes of stuffing next time.

I just really enjoy this dish and so does my family.  i've been making this for years.  I make the stuffing before hand using chicken stock instead of the water.  I also add 2 boxes of the stuffing instead of one.  I also use thin chicken breasts so this cuts down on the cooking time (usually 35 or so minutes) and therefore the stuffing doesn't dry out.  I also use Monterey jack or Colby jack cheese

As written a four, with changes make it a five. We don't care for casseroles that contain cream of whatever but this one was pleasantly surprising and I would want to make it again. Instead of the can of cream of celery, I used cream of mushroom and added celery seed to the mixture. I also added fresh ground black pepper and diced onion. I didn't boil the chicken. Also added more water to soften up the cornbread stuffing. Had to bake a bit longer in order for the chicken to cook. And yes, it is salty. I would definitely use low-sodium next time.

My family loved this meal! It is simple to make and very tasty. No leftovers whatsoever. My daughter is already begging me to make the "yummy stuffing dinner" again. And if my 4 yr old can scarf it down then I know that it is good.
The only suggestion that I have is low sodium soups and stuffing if at all possible. It was rather salty and I do suggest that you use lower sodium products.
But all in all it was great. Off to make it again!

This was very good - my husband had seconds.  I followed other reviewers advice and used 2 cans of cream of chicken.  I also added some water to the stuffing/broth mixture because I thought it would be too dry, and it was.  Next time I'll use twice the amount of liquid it calls for.  I didn't boil the chicken first, I just put it in the pan.  I baked for 45 minutes at 350, and it came out beautifully.

I would make this one again but it reminded me of chicken helper.  It has a good flavor and the family ate it but maybe I will save this one for a quick meal night.

This is now my 6 year olds favorite dish.  She has never cared for stuffing but just loves it in this dish.  (I think it is because the stuffing isn't soggy).

Very great.  I would double the stuffing though and add more broth to soften it up a bit.  There is a lot of sauce and very little stuffing otherwise.

This dish is real good "home cooking"!  I very much enjoyed it.  I do have a couple of suggestions that might make it better:
Use cheddar instead of mozzerella; and I added sauteed veggies (carrots, onions and peas).  Thanks for a good one.

This was good but I thought it turned out a little runny. I think I might add less chicken broth to the soups next time I make it and also bake in a layer of vegetables between the chicken and the soup mixture. Very tasty though and my kids loved it!

This recipe wasn't my favorite. I'm always a fan of chicken casseroles I can mix together and throw in the oven, but this one was a little bland and I didn't like the cheese. It was definitely edible, just not something I'll make again.

Whole family loved this!  I didn't cook the chicken first just to make it easier - I cut it into bite size pieces and put it in the baking dish. I also put frozen broccoli on top of the chicken and then the soups and cheese.  I baked it for a while to make sure the chicken cooked then added the stuffing and baked it longer.  Really good and made great leftovers for lunch the next day!  Oh, I only used a pound of chicken but used two boxes of stuffing.  Don't think one would have been enough for us.

I thought this was really good, but it wasn't a big hit with the kids (I think how it looked played a big part in that).  I did not cook the chicken first like some other reviewers suggested and it came out great.  I would double the stuffing amount next time- it just barely covered the top using the amount in the recipe.

Made as is, though I covered the dish partway through to keep the stuffing from getting too crunchy, especially since it seemed like there just wasn't enough liquid for it.  This was pretty good.  Coincidentally I've run across a lot of chicken w/stuffing recipes lately and this was one of the better ones I've had, despite the stuffing being a bit  on the crunchy side.

This turned out very yummy! Although I did do what others suggested and used low sodium items. I also used the whole bag of Pepperidge Farms stuffing plus and extra can of chicken broth to moisten. I didn't have any motz. cheese so I used mild cheddar. I added foil like someone suggeseted except for the last 10 min. Next time I will add chopped broccoli.. and maybe add diced tomatoes on top after done cooking or during the last 5 min. for more color and flavor. Very easy and very good!! Made with stuff I had on hand.

This was so easy and so wonderful!  Since we like dark and white chicken meat, I boiled a whole chicken, cooked it, and then separated the meat from the bone.  I also added a can of peas and carrots to the recipe.  I also covered with foil, removing it for last five minutes of baking, and the stuffing on top was perfect!  It's like a one-pot Thanksgiving dinner!

I liked this! As some others suggested, I used low sodium cream of celery and cream of chicken soup. Also, you definitely don't have to boil the strips of chicken first. This is an easy-to-prepare, tasty dinner.

What makes this dish good is that it's different. I found it very salty and I think it's from the cream of soup and I only used 1 can of cream of chicken too.  I recommend using half cream of chicken, half skim milk. To make it more of a balanced meal, I would add mixed vegetables.

Next time I will definitely add more liquid to the stuffing and cover with tin foil as this time it turned out dry with the stuffing crunchy. Even so, the girls like it. Husband couldn't get past the stuffing in general.

the chicken was very bland, next time ill probably marinate it in some of the herbs to add more flavor, other than that it was fine.

Easy to make, easy to serve and easy to eat.  I used microwave bacon and sauteed onions, red & green peppers with garlic and used italian blend cheese.  I also added some italian seasoning to the sauteed vegetables and salt and pepper.  I had seasoned stuffing cubes, not chicken, but I added a 1/2 tsp of chicken boullion powder to the stuffing. I added a touch of seasoned salt and pepper to the eggs.  It was very good and you can do almost anything with it depending on your mood.

Ended up being a little too spicy for our taste but next time I will just use Cream of Chicken soup and leave out the Cream of Celery soup.  That may help.  Also, the stuffing mix has quite a bit of seasonings in it anyway. Easy to make.

The saltyness is not from the stuffing, it is from the cheese,  I leave cheese out, it is just as good. I sprinkle some dried thyme & sage in stuffing & toss the crumbs around. The dried Herbs give it the "homemade" stuffing taste like Thanksgiving

This was good, but still a little dry on top after baking it covered for 30 min. and uncovered for 15.  Next time I would add 1 full cup of chicken broth with the stuffing mix as other reviewers suggested.

Good comfort food. Added 1 chopped eggplant in lieu of extra chick (made recipie for 10), added 2 cans drained french green beans. Still a bit bland. Try more seasoning...garlic, pepper?

Ok...this was delicious. Loved that there was no butter. I used low fat shredded cheddar cheese (could use low fat/sodium soups).  Makes for a really good mid-week, winter dinner.

This is pretty good.  Wish I would have added more spices or something to give it more flavor.  Used low sodium soup.  Used 2 boxes of stuffing and cheddar cheese.  Boiled chicken about 20 minutes, baked for 45.

This was delicious! I only used 1 pound of chicken but I kept the rest of the ingredients to their original measurements. I sprinkled the chicken with poultry seasoning and garlic pepper, then I diced it up, and added a can of mushrooms, and some sliced onion. I used cream of mushroom instead of cream of celery. I also added an extra half cup of cheese. I baked, covered at 375, then uncovered for the last 15 minutes or so. My son gobbled it up, and I had two helpings, but hubby wasn't impressed. This dish rated 5 stars for me and my son, but it was about a 3 for him. Thus, four stars as a compromise.

All righty folks, this is one good meal! I, of course, changed it a tad. The main change;  I made up some instant mashed potatoes (you could use leftovers if you had them), and put them as the bottom layer. I made two boxes of stove top stuffing according to the package directions (using water, not broth) so I think this helped it not be salty. I also had to use a can of campbells chicken gumbo because I only had 1 can of cream of anything in the house. I used a mixture of cheeses I had in the fridge, and I used about 3-4 cups. Great quick, filling meal. You should really try it with the mashed potatoes!

Very tasty. Good comfort food. I added some chopped broccoli for some nutrition - and could barely taste it (a plus for us). I agree that it's a bit salty, so next time I think I'll use healthy choice chicken & celery cream soups. the stuffing mix will make up for the salt.

Pretty good! I diced the chicken and reduced the cooking time. Also, I used half the amount of chicken but kept the same measurements of everything else. It was enough to feed my family of 3 twice!

I am sorry, we just didn't like this recipe.  Very salty and the cheese in the middle just melted into the soup and made a gloppy sauce.

I made this recipe almost exactly as written.  I did add some frozen vegetables to the cream soup mixture.  The end product was a little watery - I think it was from the frozen vegs.  I will definitely use this as a base recipe next time with a few other changes.

This is a very good recipe and very easy!!  This is what I did differently.  I shredded the boiled chicken.  I added two ingredients to the chicken at the bottom of the cooking pan.  I added one small box of frozen peas and half of a small yellow onion, chopped. 
Also, I used two boxes of stuffing instead of one.
It came out wonderful.  The peas are a very good addition.  It tastes just like a chicken pot pie.  Yummy!!

This recipe is a great go-to recipe since the ingredients are ones that are usually on-hand.  My family prefers this with diced or shredded chicken rather than larger strips.  I'm not typically a fan of stuffing, but I like the flavor that the stuffing seasonings give the casserole.  It is one recipe that I never have to coax my 1 & 3 yr-olds to eat.

This was a good receipe.  I read everyone's input of changing some ingrediants.  I added a little water and had it covered the whole time and added some carrats and brocolli.  It did come out a little watery, so I guess either I should uncover for half the time or put no water.  I was a little afraid not to broil the chicken before placing it in the oven, but the chicken cooked well by just placing the raw chicken in the oven.  This was good and my husband and I enjoyed it.

5 stars for easy with ingredients I had on hand.  I baked the chicken 30 minutes, then added the rest of the ingredients and baked 45 more.  Used Stove Top stuffing (no seasoning packet) and about a cup and a half of broth, but we enjoyed it and will make again.

This was really good. I used COlby Jack cheese, I also used sotve top stuffing and used extra broth for the stuffing so it wouldn't be crunchyand baked it for about 30 min. It was n't salty like the others said. It was perfect. Yum Yum Yum. Thanks for a great recipe.

Made this exactly as  written and it was good comfort food.  My 2 year old found it suitably 'beige' (her current food group!) and actually ate some!  Easy and tasty for the family.  Thanks for the submission.

I made this for dinner one night, and it turned out perfect!  It had the perfect amount of moisture and texture to it, and great flavor.  Would definitely make again.

My family really enjoyed this. I used montery jack cheese and put it on top of the stuffing. I covered while baking and the stuffing turned out perfect. I do agree with the other reviews this was a bit salty and I love salt. Next time I will use low sodium ingredients.

My husband and I thought this was very good, but a bit salty.  Next time I will use reduced-sodium broth and soups.

I used 2 low sodium chicken soups and regular stuffing mix and it was the perfect amount of saltiness. The stuffing was more crunchy than I expected, so if you want the usual squishy stuffing, add water or something extra to the stuffing before cooking.

I made this after work one night and for a while, it became one of my meals to make once a week.  It's easy and taste really good.

Good recipe, although its pretty much the same as the one on the back of the Pepperidge Farm stuffing mix.  But it was still good and made great leftovers!  Would make this one again.

I was excited to try this one out...I don't think I should of used the cream of celery soup, next time I will use 2 cans of the cream of chicken.  I also probably should of seasoned the chicken with Old Bay or something.  My neighbor just LOVED it as did the kids.

This was very good and my husband enjoyed it, but the cheese is a bit much. I will be making it again, but I will leave out the cheese because it was just too rich.

An ok recipe to start with but it seems  incomplete and I added a pkg of frozen baby peas. I've made it a few times a will continue to try and improve on it as it is easy to make but just a
little bland. I'm also wondering if I really needed to boil the chicken first.

My kids and husband loved this.  I forgot to put the cheese in, and it was still good!  Great 'comfort' food.
