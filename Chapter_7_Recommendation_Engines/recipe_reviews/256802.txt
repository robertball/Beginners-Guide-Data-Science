I liked this a lot more than I thought I would. I've made regular Cincinnati chili before with a from-scratch blend of spices & it was over-whelming, but honestly with the "mild" packet & the required dose of cinnamon this was just fine. I put a 1/4 tsp in at a time & stirred & tasted til I got the whole teaspoon in - wasn't willing to risk making it inedible. My 4yo ate her helping and 3 helpings of leftovers for lunches the next few days - WITHOUT dippers, she just ate it like normal chili, it was that good. I did use turkey instead of beef. Thanks for sharing!
