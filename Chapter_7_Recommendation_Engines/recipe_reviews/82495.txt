I had made banana fries before I found this posting, and I want to add that for people who must monitor their blood glucose, green bananas have resistant starch which is less likely to elevate bg. I have type 2 diabetes, and I have eaten as many as three bananas prepared this way - all within 2 or 3 hours' time, and never suffered a spike in blood glucose. They are delicious and healthy!

Yum, Amazing! With a little ketchup, you couldn't tell the difference! Be sure to use small green bananas, and cut them really thin!!

Thanks so much for sharing! I made these for my family because they LOVE french fries and I am trying to get them to eat better. My partner has not had fries in over a month and so she felt there was no difference in taste other than a mild sweetness. And I do mean mild. 
Best advice, make sure your oil is heated well and also that you place fries in the oil one at a time to avoid sticking. We salted and peppered and they were great and low fat/low cal.

Quite curious, it is also prepared as a side dish in the northern part of Colombia (cities that run along the Atlantic Coast).   The tricky part, peeling the unripe (green bananas). Might recommend you do it under running hot/warm water. Watch out for your clothes, the slime will stain them for good.  Cut the tips off, use your knife to cut through the outer skin, use the knife's tip to slowly remove it.   Cut the fries and place in a container that has water and salt, this will prevent them from taking a brown color. When ready to place in the hot oil take out and pat dry.  Unripe bananas are also great to use in soups or simply boiled and served hot, mashed with farmers cheese and some butter. Salt to taste.

This is an excellent french fries substitute. I am not a banana person I don't like the flavor at all. These taste like french fries if you get the small green bananas. I know some people can't have potatoes ie arthritis or just dieting. It's worth it. They may seem a little more dense but add a dash of salt and they'll be gone really fast.

I love love love these! Everyone I serve them to cannot believe they aren't potatoes! The riper the better! All I do is thinly slice the bananas, spray a pan with pam then spray some pam on top of the bananas and sprinkle some salt on them, pop them in the oven for 10 mins, then flip to the other side for 10 mins, and all done! Delicious and a super healthy and low calorie alternative to french fries. Thanks so much Victoria!

Yummy! We loved these fries - especially the kids. I fried them in peanut oil and sprinkled with salt. Then, served them with Ranch dressing for dipping. Very different and a nice change of pace from potato fries.

so simple and delish!  there's still a hint of banana taste, but coupled with a little salt it creates an interesting and irresistible combination (kind of reminds me of fried plantains...)

Mmmm. This is really good. The bananas I used were probably not green enough, but still turned out well. Didn't even serve with any sauce (ketchup/ranch), plenty good on own.

This is fantastic.  My Niece and Nephew who are the worlds pickist eaters couldn't stop eating them.  They had the flavor of MILD banana and the texture of a sweet potato.  Very Yummy.  We buy green bananas on purpose to make a batch of these now.

Very good! I used Safflower oil and they were great... I didn't have any problems with them sticking together or anything- I think it has to do with how many you put in the oil at a time. I'll definitely make these again!!

I thought these were really good.  I could tell that they weren't potatoes because they had a very slightly sweet taste even though they did not taste like bananas.  I really wanted to try them, so I didn't wait until I found completely green bananas.  I just used almost completely green bananas.  I usually dip fries in ranch, but I didn't want to do that with these.  I had planned on trying BBQ sauce but realized after making them that I didn't have any.  So, I mixed some peanut butter, soy sauce, and red hot together (which  ended up tasting a bit like the flavor of pad thai but spicier).  It tasted great with the slightly sweet flavor of the fries.

Well firstly mine looked nothing like the colour of fries in the picture and they were not what I expected. They were a little sweet, which was expected but disappointing. Totally not recommend for people with any high expectations .

I have very picky roommates, so when they asked me what I was cooking, I just said, "Fries!" They tried them and LOVED them. They were gobbled up in seconds. No advice to improve the recipe, it's perfect!

I really liked these as a substitute for traditional fries, though I must admit I couldn't find the small green bananas at the grocery store so I opted to use dark green plantains instead. There was no sweetness at all, and with a dip you won't notice that they aren't made from potatoes.

I am surprised; I was skeptical of these because I HATE green bananas. But they were delicious! I really couldn't tell them from regular fries, except that the texture of these was nicer than potato fries. I will be making these on a regular basis-thanks!

This recipe was so intriguing; I just had to try them out. It's funny, the whole time they're frying, you're anticipating a good, crispy french fry. Then you taste it, and are surprised by the mild banana taste. My coworkers are dieting and they haven't had french fries in over two months, but I bet they would appreciate this recipe. I'll be passing this one onto my health-conscious friends, thanks!

Ok, so I am taking these out of the deep fryer as my step-daughter and grandkids arrive, and she ate one and said they were really good, and I said, "that is good, I have never made them before" and she said, "You have never made home fries before?"  And I said, "not with bananas"  And she said, "you are kidding me, bananas?!"  She loved them and the grandkids couldn't get enough of them.  Some ate with ketchup, some without.  Will be making again and again.  Thank you for sharing

I was a little nervous about this one but i love trying new things. I have to say it was shockingly good. You really can hardly taste the difference from potato fries except for a slight sweetness. Sooooo good, I'll make these again!!

I'm going to make this for my little one for sure...they taste like potatoe fries (maybe it should be credited Kenya Fries like the French got credit for potatoe fries) I let em sit in the oil for a bit too long but they still taste great. The salt is optional for the those watching their salt intake like me (ms. pregnant)taste great with or without

I love green banana fries, it's a staple food where I live ( Guanaja, Bay Islands, Honduras) and most of the Caribbean.
Try cutting them into round nuggets or cutting them on a slant rather than like regular frenchfries. Experiment with the amount of slices you put in the oil at a time... It makes a difference.
This is good stuff

These fries weren't bad... but the description is a little deceiving.  They still taste like bananas, don’t be fooled.  Your kids won’t think you went to McDonald’s!

I'm not exactly sure I made these correctly.  I bought what I thought were green bananas, and they aren't ripe to eat right now, but they peeled okay so maybe they are too ripe for this recipe?  I don't know, so if they didn't turn out right, it's my fault.  They weren't bad, they just sort of tasted like . . .well, fried bananas.  Which I guess I should have expected.  I really liked them with a lot of salt, so that was good.  Bf was not very impressed with these, but they looked a lot like fried plantains to me, and he is not a fan of those at all.  If I get really green bananas, I'll try these again.  thanks for the recipe.

Really good!  We used canola oil.  Great alone or with ketchup or ranch.  Definitely worth trying!

These were awesome! After I cut the bananas, I put them in a covered bowl in the fridge for a couple hours. Right before I was about to deep fry them, our power went out! So, although worried they would get bad, I waited until the next day to try these. They turned out great! The only problem I had was with them sticking together. They were mushy, but it didn't matter. We just salted them and dipped them in ketchup, but used a fork to eat them. They taste just like french fries, but with a small hint of banana for an aftertaste. I will definitely make again!

I wasn't able to find any bananas at the grocery store that were green, so I just settled for partially green. I used 3 bananas instead of 5 and 2 cups of olive oil instead of 1 quart. This is one of the tastiest, healthiest recipes I've came upon that I actually am eager to keep making! Thanks so much!

Very good. They're a lot like fried plantains. I did have a problem with them sticking so I did them single layer at a time. They turned out well and my son loved them. I probably wont make them again simply because plantains are easier and faster with the same taste.

Really good.  Tastes a lot like fried plantains, but with fewer calories.  One of these days I'm going to make both the fried bananas and the tostones (fried green plaintains) and try then side by side so I can know for sure what the taste differences are.

Important: Ripe bananas contain lectins (which interfere with your Energy, digestion & overall health). Potatoes are also lectin-rich. So you want the least ripe bananas possible. I've used them in place of potatoes in every way: stews,  mashed, sliced & baked til crispy with (tossed in olive or other healthful oil first). I've had to experiment some as my husband is pretty picky. I added garlic to the mashed bananas. For myself, I added sour cream & green onions. Some attempts have failed terribly. But the ones that don't, are so good! And so good for you! If this recipe doesn't work, play with it a little with other reviewers ideas or other recipes. It's worth it to get lectins out of your diet.

My husband & I love these, and he is a picky eater. I got the greenest bananas I could find & they did not taste like bananas at all when fried. I will make these again!!! Thanks for sharing.

OMG.. this DOES taste like potato fries.. with a MILD sweetness.. when salted it's almost nonexistent.. for all those who either had way too light or burnt fries.. i can only imagine their deep fryer thermostat is not accurate.. we fried ours for 7 minutes and they were perfect.. maybe their cut was too thin/thick or maybe they didn't use truly green bananas.. ours were super hard to peel and left a very dark sap/tar on our hands once cut/peeled.. salting immediately out of the fryer is mandatory.. either way.. when done exactly as written this is beyond a 5* recipe.. ty so much for sharing

I am quite surprised!  I had bananas that would not ripen and was considering taking them back to the store and then came a cross this recipe.  The only trouble I had was peeling the banana....even with a knife it was rather difficult. I only fried one banana but it was absolutely delicious!  VERY much like regular french fries!  Thank you for this idea!

taste just like a platano. I fried them for 2 minutes and then baked them for 15 while cooking something else. Loved 'em.

WOW!! Yummy, yummy, yum, YUM!! These were so good, I couldn't stop eating them. They were so flavorful. We ate them with just salt. I admit, I was skeptical...bananas instead of potatoes?? But they were really good, an awesome break from regular fries. And just as easy. Thanks so much for sharing, Victoria, I'll make these again and again!

There were definitely yummy. I loved the flavor, but they were too greasy and I prefer my fries to be crispier. I fried them in a deep skillet of oil and waited until they were a dark golden brown, but they were still flimsy which made it more difficult to sop up the oil. Also, they stuck together a bit.

I was really excited to make this recipe and a little disappointed based on the other reviews. I could definitely tell these weren't regular fries. Salt and ketchup helped, but then again it also masked the flavor. These are interesting to make, but not exactly yummy.

I actually bought green bananas, not just regular unripe bananas.  They turned out perfectly and didn't have a sweet taste at all.  I fooled my grandchildren.  Next time I will test in the air fryer.  A good choice for healthy fries.  Especially for my plant based diet and the fact that they are starch resistant.

Very tasty! I only fried 2 green bananas in coconut oil in a skillet on the stove top. I used salt, pepper and ketchup on one. The other I sprinkled with cinnamon, sugar and maple syrup. Both were delicious. I could have eaten lots more! I will make this again.

These were surprisingly good. Normally, I hate warm bananas, but these didn't really have the same flavour. Different, tasty, and an interesting side dish. Would make again.

I love bananas and I love fries, so I thought I would give this a try. I did not care for these at all.  I used 2 large bananas, I put them in the deep fryer at 375 and walked off.  When I came back at 4 1/2 minutes they were very burned.  I then did 2 large ones at 350 for 2 minutes.  They came out nicely browned.  I tried dipping in ketchup and ranch, I couldn't eat many.  They left a horrible aftertaste that I could not get out of my mouth.  My husband was able to eat a few that were smothered in ketchup, but he did not like them either.  We will stick to potatoes.

GREAT for kids...they taste like normal fries to them and they're much healthier. But I have made them almost a dozen times and they still taste sweet.
