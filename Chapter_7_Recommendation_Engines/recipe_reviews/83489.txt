The jury is still out on this one... I did NOT make the gingerbread, I needed a lemon sauce for a lemon cake. So, while I was intrigued by the use of slaw dressing, I'm not convinced the formulation department at Marzetti's has put their best foot forward here. As is, the recipe is TOO runny, and nothing but slaw should ever use a WHOLE CUP of this dressing. I ended up using nearly 2.5 cups of confect. sugar just so my cake didn't taste like slaw. I'll probably try it again, but with 1/3 C of the dressing, 1.5 C of sugar. If it doesn't work then, I'm off to find another recipe...

This sauce tasted like super sweet slaw dressing.  I was not happy at all that I wasted all of that stuff preparing this recipie.
