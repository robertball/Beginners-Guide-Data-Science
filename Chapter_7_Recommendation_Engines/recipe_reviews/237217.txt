The salad is on the bland side, but simply adding salt and pepper helps tremendously! I'd recommend adding salt and pepper to the asparagus, along with the garlic powder and olive oil. I did like that this really didn't need a dressing and was tossed around in the bowl used for the asparagus. I also recommend only 15 mins on the asparagus, but that is personal preference. Once everything was tossed together, I did add a light drizzle of oil and some additional salt and pepper to taste. Delicious!

I added salt & pepper. I also tossed the tomatoes and feta on to the baking sheet with the asparagus for the last 5 minutes. Yum and so simple.

Attempting to keep asparagus crispy, I pan fried the asparagus in bacon dripping for 7-8 minutes.

This was a great foundation for this salad. I made some changes. To the olive oil and garlic powder toss before roasting. I added lemon juice, salt, pepper, and crushed red peppers. Also after roasting I ises the drippings and and added more olive oil, lemon juice, garlic powder, salt and pepper as well as crushed red pepper to make a vinaigrette to pour over the salad. It was delicious! I'm trying for a more solidly based plant diet and this was a wonderful foundation salad for me combining my favorite ingredients. Will definitely make this again!

Delicious--I love anything with feta. I added salt and pepper as many of the reviews suggested, but the salad was just too dry for me. I ended up putting a little balsamic dressing on mine. Loved that it was so yummy and so easy!

I made this for Easter lunch. It was a hit. Only changes: used garlic salt as most said salt would be needed, roasted in oil young green beans, tomatoes, as well as asparagus and sauteed mushrooms in olive oil so less drizzle needed over lettuce. Scrumptious!

I make this all the time.  To give it some more taste though, I always add feta "juice" to the salad.  Gives it some saltiness so you don't need to add salt.  And it mixes nicely with the olive oil. I frequently add lightly microwaved mushrooms as well.  I don't use fresh onion though because I don't like it.

This salad was delicious.  Very easy.  I roasted the asparagus the day before I needed it, which did not effect the salad at all.  Used Roma tomatoes instead of cherry tomatoes.  I did prepared a light lemony vinaigerette and drizzled on just before serving.

We really enjoyed this salad. The asparagus got a little crisp in some places, so added a little crunch and savory flavor. I did add salt and pepper to both the asparagus and the lettuce, and a little more oil to the lettuce as well. May cut down on the amount of feta cheese next time only because the husband isn't a huge fan. Otherwise, great salad!

Great timing as it is asparagus season here in TX.  Love how easy this is and no dressing required.  Like the other reviewers, I found that it needed salt and pepper but otherwise it was quite yummy.

As is, this recipe needed seasoning. While feta cheese is salty, it still needed salt and pepper.
