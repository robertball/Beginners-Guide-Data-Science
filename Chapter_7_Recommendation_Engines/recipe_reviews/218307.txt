Beautiful cake!  Everyone commented that they loved the blue compared to the currently hyped-up red velvet.  The only thing I would change is to lessen the amount of sugar in the cake mix.  Way too sweet for me!  But I will definitely make this again.  Thank you for sharing!

Impressive looking cake - the only changes I made was to switch out the blueberry for raspberry extract, eliminate the walnuts, and I make it low carb.
