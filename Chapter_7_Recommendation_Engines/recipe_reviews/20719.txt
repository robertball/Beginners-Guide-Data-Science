I used this as a dip for homemade chicken nuggets. I made a half batch of this and to make it a little lighter, I used equal amounts reduced fat mayonnaise, reduced fat sour cream and nonfat green yogurt. The kids thought this was a great. Next time, I think I'll increase the chili sauce and cayenne pepper for a half batch but that's purely personal taste.

We're trying to enjoy the limited Stone Crab Claw season in SW Florida as much as we can, and this recipe almost seems like it was deliberately designed for them!  Normally we enjoy our crab claws with the classic Honey Mustard Sauce. This was a very nice departure which is not nearly as sweet.  Simple to prepare as well as being simply flavored, with not a whole bunch of "stuff" in it.  (Cayenne doesn't work for Hubs, so I gave it just a little shot of Tabasco sauce instead)

So easy!  This makes a great dipping sauce for artichokes, shrimp, raw vegetables.  It comes together is seconds.  Hubby really liked it & used it as a salad dressing too.

I used this as a dipping sauce for shrimp at a fondue.  It is a delicious dip!   It is also excellent with potato chips and would probably be perfect with sweet potato fries or regular french fries.

I thought this tasted okay. I like that it wasn't too sweet like similar sauces that have ketchup. I did think the mayonaise taste was a little strong though. I did use lite mayo and reduced fat sour cream. Maybe, the full fast version is best for something like this. I didn't need much, so I used the calculate button to make 4 servings and I still got a good 1/2 cup. I did end up adding a little more chili sauce to taste, after mixing. I can see this tasting good on a seafood sandwich for some reason.

The quantity of ingredients makes a large batch of Chili sauce (more than 32 ounces). We halved the recipe. Used Maggi Mild Sweet Chili Sauce since already on hand. This is the Asian version rather than American tomato-based sauce. Either would work fine. A very versatile sauce and compliments many dishes. We served this as an optional finishing sauce for Perfect Fried Green Tomatoes.

Family favorite for zucchini chips. Such an easy yummy recipe. We usually do half for our family and then add siracha and franks and a little onion herb seasoning.
