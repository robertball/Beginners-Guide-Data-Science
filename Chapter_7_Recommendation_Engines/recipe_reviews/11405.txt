I was served a very crisp flavorful, flat cookie they said was an almond cookie at a resturant so I came home and decided to find a recipe for them.  I found this and felt that this was the cookie I had.  However, the reviews were not good so I looked elsewhere for the recipe and found it listed many places.The ingredients were the same but,all the other sites said to bake it for 5 minutes not 15 so I decided to try it.  I am sure this is the cookie I had at the resturant so I made them and baked them for 5 minutes.  The flavor was the same but mine were not crispy so I will try them again (make only half the recipe)and probably bake them for 7 minutes.  I would suggest anyone making them to be sure and use parchment paper on your cookie sheet as I think it would be a mess to clean up without the parchment paper.

I think that there is something missing from the list of ingredients,or something else because 5 minutes in the over and these just become a burnt sugary mess.
