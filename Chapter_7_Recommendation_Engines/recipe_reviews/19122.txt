Personally, I love this dish but have made a couple of changes.  Instead of american cheese I use 1 bag of shredded cheddar cheese.  I also put sour cream on top when I serve it.

You could a lot with this recipe. However because are mixing two ingredients that are hot you do not need to bake it for 30 minutes, 10 min at best. You could use just about any meat in this rice dish.

Very good. I made half as much, used mexican cheese, and wrapped it up in a burrito with sour cream.

I've made this dish a couple times and it always winds up too dry for my tastes.

I did make some changes as well as halving the portion. We used packaged cheese and broccoli rice mix instead of the Spanish variety. Substituted mozzarella for the American cheese. I chose to season my chicken with onion, garlic and chili powders.  Layered in a glass baking dish as follows: rice, mixed frozen vegetables, chicken/green onion mixture, cheese and olives. Perhaps using regular onion and fresh-minced garlic would also add more depth of flavour to this dish. Wouldn't make again as there many leftovers that no one wanted to eat...

Pretty good stuff that doesn't require many ingredients.  I made my own spanish rice, (with brown rice, garlic, chicken broth, and salsa) and then proceeded from there.  I will use this recipe again for last minute dinner, especially since I would normally have these ingredients on hand.

My family loved this! I served it with corn tortillas and a green salad...Will be making this again. Wondering how it got its name, though...

This recipe hit the spot for my craving for Mexican food. It was easy to prepare (I cooked the rice according to the package directions). I served it with tortilla chips and sour cream and it was enjoyed by everyone.

I personally thought it tasted OK, but the friends I served it to loved it. It was easy to make, and I had all those ingredients in my kitchen cabinets.

This is indeed an easy dish, especially if you use leftover rotisserie chicken, as I did.  For my family, I would like to jazz it up a bit, next time, maybe with some Rotel, and some chili powder.  It's a bit bland, for us, but it would be easy to adapt to family preferences.   I don't usually have American cheese on hand, so I used cheddar.
