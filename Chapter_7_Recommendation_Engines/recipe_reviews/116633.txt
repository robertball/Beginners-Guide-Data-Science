This soup was amazing.  I seasoned the squash before putting it in the oven rubbing it with some pepper, thyme, and lavender salt.  Then I added a can of light coconut milk to make it a little creamier.  I didn't do the sour cream toppping, but this was one of the best squash soups that I have made even without it.

Loved this simple soup. I sped the process up by doing the squash in the microwave instead of the oven and cut the oil in half. Don't think we missed a thing. And I added the squash pulp to the broth and used my immersion blender. Very easy but be sure to remove the bay leaf before you do. Served with just a dollop of fat free sour cream. This recipe is destined to be a fall favorite.

this is such a great soup! i made it with an indian flat bread and it was a perfect meal! i cooked up the squash with salt, pepper and olive oil and left out the cream sauce because im a vegan. i would like to try this again with a coconut cream sauce but it was great by itself!

My husband and I made this soup for the first time about a month or so ago.  Since that time I have made it 4 times with various different vegetable combinations.  One with just plain butternut squash, one with squash and carrots and another with squash and sweet potato.  All these combinations were fantastic!  Would definitely recommend this to anyone.

Delicious. Don't overdo the spices like  I did, thinking I like alot of spice.. it detracts from the nice squash flavour.

I only cooked it for 20 minutes (where did 20 hours come from?) and it was great!  Like most soups it improved by spending the night in the refrigerator.

This recipe was wonderful.  I love butternut squash and I had a few I needed to use up. This soup was a great way to use up all the squash I had.  I did add a little more cayenne pepper than needed because of the abundance of squash I had and it was delicious!

Fabulous! We all had second helpings. Changes I made...more garlic, I used hot New Mexico Chili Pepper instead of cayenne because that's what I had, 3 cups of chicken broth and a 14oz can of coconut milk, instead of 5 cups of broth. I also added 3 little packettes of pickeled ginger (like you get with take out sushi). When I blended it all, I added the sour cream and 1/8 cup of chopped parsley and omitted the whipping cream topping. It was thick, creamy, and spicey, but the taste of the roasted squash came through beautifully. A real keeper.

Simple & tasty. I used fat-free sour cream & omitted the whipping cream, so I'm sure the real version is even better. 

I also mixed the sour cream topping into the whole batch. Probably not as classy as the garnish, but just as good.

This soup was a huge hit this fall!  I was craving it constantly and everyone I served it to loved it too.  When I first read the recipe, it seemed like a lot of steps, but I just baked the squash the night before, then assembled the soup the night we wanted to eat it.  Delicious!

Delicious. I was going to skip the cream sauce, but so glad I didn't.  The soup has a good amount of kick.  I was surprised my 4 year old and 2 year old didn't complain about the spiciness.

Very tasty.  Used less broth than called for and it was still rather thin, so I'd definitely use 8 cups instead of 10.  Used hot curry powder and no cayenne, since we were out.

I loved this soup.  Made a few changes.  Since I don't like curry, I left it out and added some nutmeg and cinnamon to taste.  This freezes beautifully in containers that I take for lunch to work.  Definitely a keeper.

This recipe was great!  I grew some butternut squash in my garden this summer for the first time and so I was inspired to look for some interesting recipes.  This one is a keeper!  I followed the recipe fairly close but I did use 1/2 tsp. garlic powder as I was out of fresh garlic and I doubled the hot pepper since I like food extra spicy.  I also didn't use the whipping cream for the topping, I just mixed the sour cream and cilantro.  Yum!

This is my favorite squash soup recipe so far. I didn't have enough broth (used vegetable broth) so I added a can of coconut milk, which turned out well. I think it would be great without it, though, maybe even better. Overall, my liquid was still a little low but I forgot to accordingly reduce the salt so it ended up a bit salty. I also added a little garam masala and black pepper to the spices - yum! Before roasting the squash, I brushed it with olive oil and sprinkled on salt, pepper, and a little curry powder. Because I had already made it creamy, I didn't make the topping.

I have made this for 2 or 3 parties and it has always gone over very well. I use the coconut milk for 2 cups of the broth and olive oil instead of veg oil. I omit the salt and use cilantro for the topping with sour cream and whipping cream.

I just made this for tonight, but it is so good, I can't stop getting it out of the fridge and getting a spoonful!   The only thing I did different is put a little olive oil on the squash before baking. I was worried that it would dry out, although I didn't know for sure. It came out great, though. The only change I may make in the future is a little less red pepper, since my family and I are wimps when it comes to spicy. It's worth the little burn.  Awesome, easy, and a great way to use seasonal ingredients!

This recipe is delicious!  I substituted pre-cut cubes of squash, which I baked in foil for 30 minutes and then uncovered and baked for another 20 minutes. I thought it might not be seasoned enough with the amounts listed in the recipe, but I followed the exact amounts of spices anyway and it was perfect.  This will make a great first course on Thanksgiving, and will be a new favorite the rest of the winter.

Good, but not great.  I appreciate the fact that this low-fat, but I really prefer a creamier squash soup with more traditional seasonings like nutmeg.  I really thought the curry overpowered the squash.  Probably won't make again.

This recipe was so good! It was my first time making the soup, and it was so easy!

I like my food spicy so I added an extra tsp of curry powder, 1/4 tsp of chili powder, and dried coconut powder instead of adding coconut milk. 

A dollop of sour cream and I couldn't believe how creamy and rich it was!

Wow, this was really yummy and flavorful.  I think I may have added a bit more squash (I made this for ten servings) and next time, I might try yellow curry instead of the red I had on hand.  I also added roasted pine nuts as a topping, which worked very well.  This soup is very yummy and comforting in winter!

Excellent flavor.  I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth to make it a vegetarian meal and organic vegetables.  Very healthy and delicious.

Just delicious. Used no cayenne or topping. Cooked leftover already cut squash from Costco in the microwave. Used homemade chicken broth. I loved it my 1 1/2 year olds loved it. I have made it twice and will make it again and again!

Instead of all chicken broth, I used some chicken broth and a can of coconut milk. It was incredibly flavorful and gave just the right amount of creaminess.

My boyfriend and I made this soup and it was excellent! It was a little runny without the sour cream added. We decided to thicken it up a little with carrots and it tasted great. We definitely will be repeating this one.

I'm not usually fond of curry but I was having company so I decided to try this soup.  Everyone loved it and I even thought it was good.  I will definitely make it again.

What a sensational fall recipe!  I used all the ingredients, in the amounts listed, and I was NOT disappointed!  However, I DID skip the cream topping because I didn't have the ingredients, but I definitely did not miss it!  The immersion blender helped to hasten the process and lessen the cleanup.  Thanks Evelyn!  We LOVE it!

Just made this soup and its YUMMY. I actually just used my puree wand and it worked out great. I did not have to transfer it to a blender or food processor. I also made my own chicken stock. Roasted the squash with olive oil salt pepper and garlic.Instead of curry powder I used a paste only because its all I had and it seems fine. Super easy and great comfort food.

A great spin on butternut squash soup.  A bit more cayenne wouldn't hurt if you like spice.  The cilantro sour cream was a perfect pairing.  With the warmth from the curry, this was a great winter soup.

Excellent! Don't worry about time: The cooking time is only 1 hour and 20 minutes, not 21 hours like it says in the recipe. To reduce the calories, I skipped the cream sauce and simply added cilantro while the soup simmered. I have also spiced it up even more by adding a couple of minced habaneros to the mix.

Enjoyed the soup, but will add more broth next time as it was too thick.  Has quite a strong flavour, so works better as a first course rather than main course.

This is delicious!  The only adjustment I made was that I used 4 cups of beef broth instead of 5.  I only had 4 cups on hand and wanted a thick soup anyhow.  I didn't make the topping in the recipe, just put a tiny dollop of lite sour cream on top to keep it healthy.  This is just as good as the versions using cream cheese.  I can't wait to taste it tomorrow, since many reviews say it gets even better.

Very nice. It does thicken, don't worry. I'm saving the 2nd half until tomorrow because curry's always better the next day, or the day after that. Next time I'll try the coconut milk others have suggested. This would make a nice sauce too, over chicken and white rice.

I've made this several times and everyone I have made it for loves it. I leave out the extra salt because chicken broth has enough salt already and I used light sour cream and half-n-half for the topping. Still wonderful even with the healthy modifications. It is excellent without the topping as well and could be modified quite easily to be vegan without sacrificing taste.
Pro-tip: Roast the squash the night before and let it sit in the fridge overnight. This way you don't burn your fingers trying to peel a hot squash!

very good  soup. The things i did differently were: i make a knife slit in the squash and then microwave  until they feel  soft from the outside. This makes them easy to get out of the skin without all the mess.  Also,  i used a box (4 cups instead of 5) of chicken broth.  I was careful in sauteing the onions/garlic so they didn't brown so that the soup retained its light color. Thanks for this recipe, just right with seasonings
