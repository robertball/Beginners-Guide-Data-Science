Maybe it's because I'm from Texas but these are weird. I didn't care for the combination of bacon, rosemary, and lemon. Next time will leave lemon out of the picture. The good news is I am now a huge fan of theseed meaty cranberry  beans.

Super tasty!  I didn't have bacon, so I used ham, so no fat.  I also put in some spicy peppers to add heat and green color/texture, instead of the pepper and chili paste.  Even better after sitting a couple days!

This was freakin' delish!  Thank you Chef John (can't wait to try your neck sauce, btw).  Only things I added were some swiss chard that needed to be used up (added at the end when I took the lid off to finish cooking the beans), and a fistful of green beans from the garden (added with the cranberry beans)- so good, and my husband ate it all up- no leftovers.  Thanks again- I was looking for a recipe to use the fresh cranberry beans and this did not fail- yum!

I used dried cranberry & pintos as my son mistakenly mixed them together in our bean jar. I doubled the beans but halved the spices over acid reflux. It smells heavenly on this chilly summer day.

I have made these many, many times and my whole family (kids included) love them!  I omit the rosemary, but that's it.

Overall, I really enjoyed this dish.  The lemon was a little strong, so next time I might dial the lemon back a bit.  I also added some chard to amp the nutritional value, and liked it as well.  Definitely a repeat for my family.

This was delicious!!  I let it cook down a bit so that the sauce was thick and delicious... don't skimp on the fresh lemon juice and zest or the herbs... everyone completely cleaned their bowls!

This "Bacon and Cranberry Bean Ragout" was excellent: very savory!  This recipe is one I should certainly make again.  I used water instead of chicken broth and cooked my dried beans in a pressure cooker ahead of time.  I also quadrupled the recipe, which the two of us gobbled up in 24 hours. Thank you Chef John for sharing your recipe.

This was very, very tasty and satisfying!! We found fresh cranberry beans at our farmer's market and found this recipe. The fresh beans were a bit pricey at $7 for about a cup and a half of shelled beans, but we didn't mind the $ when we tasted them. Will definitely try this recipe with dry beans and see if it's as good as from fresh. We used dried rustico Italian seasoning and added fresh basil and we loved the lemon zest and juice, but didn't over-do on it.  Also used lots of bacon.  This will be a new staple for our meals.$
