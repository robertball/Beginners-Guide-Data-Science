This was delicious!  You don't need to pre-soak your peas. I just through everything in the crockpot and cooked on high for about 5 hours. I added about 1/4 cup of Quinoa to thicken it up a bit, but it didn't need it. I'm going to make this my staple split pea soup.

Quite good. I used my pressure cooker (for 10 minutes but next time I might go with 8 minutes) and I only soaked the peas for 30 minutes. The result was a smooth, creamy and rustic soup that hits the spot on a cool day. Went very well with a cheese sandwich! Thank you spinn710 for your recipe.

First time I made split pea soup.  I had ham on a ham hock leftover and put that in it instead of diced ham.   I am an average cook and my husband looked at me seriously, straight in the eye and said it was the BEST split pea soup he had ever had.  Guess I will be making this some more!

I expected typical split pea soup for as simple as this recipe is, but OMG it was perfection!    I followed verbatim and added the left over ham bone.   AMAZING!!!!     This is a keeper!

Second time making this recipe. Used my pressure cooker as one reviewer suggested. Also had some left over spiral sliced ham that I diced up and threw in. 9 min on 12psi and it was DYNOMITE!! Hands down the easiest pea soup to make.

Lots of garlic, no brown sugar, 1/3 c. quinoa. Other ingredients as suggested in recipe. Don't add salt until you've tasted how much the ham has salted the soup.

I used basic recipe, but, added 1 cup chopped celery and used my Power Pressure Cooker XL, pressed the soup/lentil setting, adjusted time from 10 to 20 minutes.  Turned out perfect.

Turned out great!!!!   I wouldn't cut the ham into 1" chunks though.  I would do them in half that size next time.

Excellent.  In future I will cut back on the ham by half but that's a matter of personal choice.  Maybe use a hambone so there is taste but not all that meat in the soup.  Used about 1 tblsp of flour to thicken it up a bit.

But all things considered this hits 110% with me!

Cooked th is in the crock pot.  Didn't soak the peas.  Two adults really enjoyed this delicious thick soup.   The two kids did not, yet I had peanut butter and carrots ready for them.

I added half a cup of chopped carrots.  I ran out of water twice, even with the lid on the second time.  It simmered like it says to so I don’t know why it was such an issue, and I did soak the peas. The flavor was pretty good, much easier than other recipes I’ve tried.

OMG!!!!!  It was soooooo good!  I gave a container to my husband's buddy at work.  He sent me a text telling me how awesome it was and said he'd buy it from me next time I made it!  I said absolutely not.  I have a pot cooking on the stove @ 5:00 a.m. for his lunch!  
Serving suggestion.....Serve it with a dollop of sour cream.

I didnt add the brown sugar because we never have it on hand.  I put in 2 TBS of white sugar just to see if it would work.  It did, but next time I think I'll leave the sugar out all together.  Peas are sweet enough as they are.  But overall its a great recipe.
