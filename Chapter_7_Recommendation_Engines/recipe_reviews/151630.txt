My husband and I shop at Costco and we buy the frozen tortellini and frozen vegetable medley. To make this recipe I simply made the tortellini, steamed the veggies in the microwave for a few min and poured sauce over them both and tada! The whole proccess takes 10 min! Great tasting quick dinner! A staple in our home.

This was ok, not my favorite but still tasty. Very easy to throw together on a busy weeknight. The only mixed veggies I had were a mexican blend with corn carrots and broccoli.

Extremely simple to throw together, and moderately tasty - nothing spectacular, but a great hearty meal when time is of the essence.

I love this! It's so easy and tastes great. I used it as a side dish and served it with crispy oven baked chicken and garlic bread. It was perfect together and will make this again. I added a little red wine and a few spices to the sauce while simmering (pepper, crushed red pepper flakes, Essence, pinch sugar). Tossed it with fresh shredded Parmesan and minced fresh parsley. Looked very pretty on the plate.

I loved it!  Reminded me of lasagna taste.  Very simple and a great way to get your daily vegetables.
