I grew up with this gravy as well. I and my mom and my mom's family came from the mountains of good 'ol KY. This recipe is the old original mountain milk gravy my mom was taught to make by her mom. My mom was a coal miners daughter living 2 coal camps down from Loretta Lynn.As a child I was always taught to keep the grease that came off the bacon back because we always used it for cooking.  Green beans,biscuits,cornbread,greens,fried cabbage,ect....I don't cook with it as much now learning just how unhealthy it is for my family and myself,but now and then I do go with those yummy home cooked meals from way back. This is awesome and you will love it.

This is a basic gravy recipe to which you can add to. I gave it a 3  because if you cook it the way it is recommended, it will come out way too thin. The thing you have to keep track of is your heat. Your roux will never thicken on low, and if you don't increase your heat when you add the milk you will never get it to simmer, much less thicken. The act of bubbling is what makes it thicken. you will never be able to make this in 36 minutes on low heat. Increase your heat to medium, season to taste, and it works just fine.

Great gravy, but this recipe has errors so I couldn't give it a 5. First, it calls for twice the milk needed and would be very runny made as stated. 2 cups is plenty, 2-1/2 if you like it thinner. Also, I have never cooked a roux longer than 3-5 minutes. The reviewer who complained of burnt bacon taste should try greatly reducing roux cooking time, and stir constantly. As a general rule for nice, thick sauces made with a roux (fried flour) you should use a ratio of 2 tbsp. fat to 2 tbsp. flour per 1 cup of liquid. Stir constantly and have patience!

This is the same recipe my mom taught me to make, best gravy for biscuits for sure. Great with some "runny" eggs, don't forget fried potatoes and grits if you really want to go over the top. This gravy is for my once a month breakfast splurge or for the days I will be duing hard work and will burn it all off.  The gravy will look very runny, I was taught to turn off the burner when it bubbles and by the time you have everything else out on the table the gravy will be thickened- it must cool a bit.

This is the way I was taught to make it from a Southern grandmother.  We always use whole milk but when she was poor she cut it with water but it is much richer with whole.   I have even added a tablespoon of butter or a some dry coffee creamer. This is GREAT served over fresh summer tomatoes!  
Tips: This recipe is very forgiving so you can adjust.  Main thing is equal ratio of bacon fat to flour maybe more fat.  There has to be enough fat to fry the flour first without it drying or clumping. Frying the flour is what makes it taste so good. A heavy cast iron skillet also helps and fry on low and constantly stir. Have all ingredients ready before you start, it moves fast. When you go to add your milk, take it from the heat, this will help you blend it before it tries to thicken and will prevent clumps. For the one who said 4 cups is too much milk,  it is not. Just simmer a minute and it will thicken right up.If its just a single person you can add less it thickens faster. The longer it simmers with the milk the more flavor and 4 cups allows it to simmer.  This is usually served a bit on the thicker side but some people like it more thin like traditional gravy,again on low heat and ALWAYS STIRRING.   I don't add Salt until the end, some bacon is very salty and you don't need more salt. You can easily add salt as you eat it and pepper too.   Everyone doesn't like the pepper. Hope this helps someone.  Enjoy.

I made it this morning and it didn't need nearly the liquid that the recipe calls for.  I wish I had trusted my instincts instead of continuing to add the milk. It tasted great and I'll use this recipe again.  Next time, I'll try about 2 cups of milk.

Same recipe I've used all my life.  Crumble the bacon and add it back to the gravy.  Really Good.

This is thoroughly delicious. Loved it. I do agree with the reviewer who said the ratio of flour:fat:liquid is off, it is. Takes too long to cook it down thick enough. But it does eventually thicken beautifully and makes a plentiful serving, so I wouldn't say it's "wrong" exactly. It's just slower. If it tastes burnt you probably used burnt bacon grease, it's not likely that the roux cooking time had anything to do with it - roux for gumbo cooks for nearly an hour before you add liquid, and while it can burn, 15 minutes is the correct amount of time to turn the roux a caramel brown. I followed this recipe to the letter and had a superior product - you can, too.

Yes good ole southern gravy been making this as long as can remember , but it does only require 2 cups of milk unless you have a large pan of drippings and more flour needed for the extra milk.

My family is from West Virginia, my momma made this gravy every Sunday. We chop up the bacon, cut up our eggs and biscuits and mix it all together. Best breakfast ever,was just dreaming about it last night so I had to Google it. I haven't made it but one time myself and wasn't sure I could make it again but I can now! Mom never wrote down how to make it like a lot of the wonderful things she made and I now miss. She has Alzheimer's now an I am sorry I didn't ask her how to make her recipes. I am slowly finding them and learning how. Pay more attention to your commas so you can pass these great recipes down!

This is very good. I took everyone's suggestion and used less milk - wrong! I started with a cup, then I added another half and I added a little more. Maybe they didn't cook the roux long enough.

This is my recipe. The amounts are wrong here. It will come out to thin. If you want it to serve 6 .  It should be 2 cups of milk..
1/2 cup of bacon renderings....  1/2 cup flour ...then it will work with the 4 cups of milk. They were supposed to edit it 2 tears ago!! Uggg

This is how my momma always made gravy and taught me. The only difference is 1.) We don't measure - just guess and 2.) We don't cook the flour for 15 minutes, just a minute or two. You can use sausage grease as well and crumble cooked sausage in it for a nice sausage gravy too. Super easy and delicious.

I grew up making this with my grandmothers and great aunts in the mountains of Tennessee. I asked my grandmother for an official recipe so I could make this for my Yankee husband. She gave me no clear measurements and I was making it way too thick. Found this today and it's a WINNER! I only added 2 cups of milk as another reviewer suggested (matter of preference), and it's absolutely perfect! Good, authentic, country recipes are hard to find these days! Thanks!

I've been making this for years. My differences are instead of making a roux I put  flour , salt, pepper and milk into a mason jar and shake well and pour into the hot drippings. I also add crumbled crisp fried bacon to really give the gravy a bacon kick. Instead of serving over biscuits I serve this great gravy over cornbread...BOY HOWDY!!!!!!

this was delicious and brought me back to the good stuff I ate in Kentucky where I grew up.  I used two cups of milk and it was very thick.  I would suggest just adding a little at a time to get the desired consistency.  thank you for the recipe!

Love bacon gravy way better than sausage gravy. If your looking to try a little different take, try using one cup pet milk and one cup milk. Either way, you can't get any better than biscuits and gravy! This was a great recipe, one my mom made all the time.

I followed exactly except using half butter and half bacon grease as we were having  mashed potatoes and prime rib roast and did not want too strong bacon flavor (if it had been for biscuits, I would have used all bacon grease) and this was just right.  To those that said four cups of milk is too much, it is not -- just be patient and cook, stirring most of the time and it will thicken to the point that you want - stop cooking and keep it thinner or keep cooking and it will thicken! It just takes a little time and patience.

Just made this for my family for Christmas morning. We have  had bacon, eggs biscuits and gravy for Christmas breakfast for the past 40+ years, so this is a "tough audience". Our usual gravy maker is no longer with us, so I was a bit nervous about meeting the "high bar" expected. This recipe met rave reviews: smooth, creamy and tasty. The only changes I made was I doubled the recipe (which made it take longer to cook) and added  extra black pepper because that's how my family likes it. 
I've saved it and will be using this recipe from now on.

I changed nothing, except to say that bacon drippings depend on whether they come from homemade, a good butcher, or store bought.
     This recipe is absolutely the best recipe that I have tried.
Don't need to add to this.... because.... the best of all I have tried.
Thank you for a truly amazing recipe...... I want to surprise the relatives for our Thanksgiving potluck supper this year ..... .one of them is an award winning butcher, so let's see!!

Its one of the best I have ever made, the only thing I would say is you can use a little less milk by 1/2 a cup or something.. Clear the time out you need and sit and stir it

Very disappointed in this gravy. 

I have never made any kind of gravy before and thought I would give this a shot being that I love bacon gravy made by my Nana, but I wanted to attempt to make some myself. It took way longer than 15 minutes to brown on low, then when I added the milk, all I got was a big pot of soupy milk. It never even got close to thick with me standing there on low stirring it constantly for 45 minutes. I am kicking myself for not reading the reviews first that the milk amount is too much. I might attempt it again when I have more bacon, and reduce the milk and see if that works.

I can make gravy with about anything, but never tried Kentucky bacon gravy until now. Turned out pretty good because as I was adding/stirring milk, it looked to be done after 2 cups milk.  Hubby wasted no time inhaling it. Absolutely adding this to my Sunday  morning lineup!!

Too much milk. I am born and raised from Tennessee, grew up making biscuits at a pie safe with my grandma. As another reviewer said, 2 cups is sufficient for 1/4 cup drippings/flour. I substitute almond milk because of lactose issues and honestly i like how the gravy turns out even better. It gives it a sweet smoky flavor, really brings out the maple of maple bacon.

I added more salt and pepper seemed like it was to bland in original amounts. But, I used fresh cracked pepper so as it cooked it did get a little hotter. So next time I'll wait until it is completely done before I add more pepper. But, I  Liked the flavor.

I’ve made this recipe several times only increasing the quantity and adding chopped, cooked bacon. To me this is the real deal, definitive  biscuit gravy recipe. When you get that craving for home style biscuits and gravy  and there are no restaurants around, this is what you want. Mahalo!

This recipe is "as old as the hills." My Deep South grandma taught me to make it when I was a child. It's easy to adjust the recipe for a little or a lot.  Simmer it before adding that last cup of milk.  
A variation: Use butter for the roux.  Add a chopped onion, a smidge of sugar  and a quart of home grown tomatoes to make a lip-smacking tomato gravy.  Adjust the milk to compensate for the tomato juice. 
Oh, dang! I think I'll have to have link sausage, biscuits, and make this for supper tonight!!

THIS is what real gravy tastes like!  I’m from Tennessee and my grandma made it almost every morning with her little can of saved bacon grease. I have no clue who ruined gravy by putting sausage in it.......... it’s a shame that  people think sausage gravy is “real country gravy”.  Thank you for sharing as it is wonderful memories of my grandma teaching me to make it this way

this was serviceable, but everyone agreed my usual sausage gravy was much better. Still a good quick fix for the morning since I had forgotten to buy sausage and had bacon on hand!

Almost gave this a fourth star. The gravy itself was creamy and smooth, but way too bland for me. After preparing it according to instructions, I needed to add some red pepper flakes and Worcestershire sauce to give it some taste. I didn't have any trouble getting it to thicken.  Decent base recipe.

It looks just like the photo. Agree with previous reviews in that it calls for too much milk, however, it really does thicken with patience...like 15-20 minutes of it.  I also stopped adding milk at 3.5 cups.  I will experiment with other recipes before I make this one again.

I love this bacon gravy and have been making it for years!  I don't care for sausage gravy at all.  After I make the bacon drippings gravy, I take about 5-6 slices of cooked bacon and crumble it and stir them into the gravy.  Oh yum, great on country butter milk biscuits.  I wish you can get this in the Michigan restaurants..
Thank you for sharing this great recipe..

I also grew up on this gravy.   My grandmother taught me to make it.  She didn't use a recipe though.  We called it West Virginia gravy :)  I still make it for my grandchildren and they ask for it whenever they come to visit.

Fantastic recipe, will definitely make it again. As stated in other comments, you don't need all 4 cups of milk. I used just a little over 2 cups and allowed it to thicken on medium-low heat for about 5 minutes, whisking slowly and frequently. Needed a good bit more black pepper for my taste and I chopped the cooked bacon and added it back in for some texture.

I have never worked with bacon drippings before, and maybe it's just that I'm not used to that flavor, but I thought the gravy smelled awful while it was cooking, and I thought it just tasted like burnt bacon (I did not burn the bacon these drippings were from). After I seasoned it generously with salt and pepper and mixed in some crumbled bacon, it was better.
Together with the biscuits it was good, but I'm still not sure if I like it or not.
The kids absolutely loved it, so I'll probably give it another try and see if it grows on me.
I just really found the burnt bacon taste to be overwhelming.
