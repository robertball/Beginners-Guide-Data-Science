I only needed about 3 tbsp. of liquid. I used a combination of soy milk and water. I think they would have been too watery if I added the whole amount of milk the recipe calls for. They came out really yummy! I used fresh chard that I blanched. To make preparation easier, I chopped the onion and steamed chard together in my food processor. Make sure to get them nice and brown, they are so good when crispy. I am planning to try them with lemon squeezed on top. YUM!

This was really good. Lighter than air nada great way to let kids to eat spinach! I used fresh spinach and cumin instead of nutmeg.

Delicious light and fluffy texture.  I would just change the amount of onion.

Absolutely delicious - light and full of spinach! I used half coconut oil and vegetable oil, this made them really light. I wanted to make Indian spinach pakora / pakoda, but did not have chickpea flour, so I was excited to try this recipe, using some curry powder instead of nutmeg, plus some chilli flakes - it was amazing!
