i made the following substitutions, so these are very healthy: a combo of 1 c. blended oats & 1 c. whole wheat flour, applesauce instead of oil, reduced the honey to 1/2 c., milk instead of yogurt.  also for the topping, cut all the ingredients in half, as i had way too much!  this made 18 muffins and they cooked about 19 minutes.  beautiful, sweet, and healthy!

Sweet mama potato! Healthy, with spice quantities are just low enough not to overwhelm the naturally mild and pleasant flavor of the sweet potato. This is the critical point. Five stars, if not for the slightly high sweetness (and I'm a sugarholic). ALL kids will devour them.  Busy/cheap people, try these variations: Quarter sweet potato and nuke for 8 minutes (check: skin pulls off easily when done, but tears when overdone) Trade honey for brown sugar. Don't feel bad skimping on either. These muffins are plenty sweet. Use 1/2 Cup skim milk instead of yogurt If cloves or ginger aren't handy, try allspice. Mash the potato with the oil, it makes it easier.

Very moist and delicious. I used a full cup of orange juice concentrate instead of honey for a citrus twist and it was perfectly sweet enough - very good for breakfast. I've also baked this batter in a 8x8 glass pan for about 25 min. Yum!

I was so tempted to add some all purpose white flour...I thought for sure 100% whole wheat flour would be to heavy and earthy.  I was wrong.  This turned out wonderfully and you can feel pretty good about their healthy ingredients.  I took other's advice and cut down on the sweetener - I used 1/2 cup of Agave syrup and it turned out perfectly sweet.  I also substituted milk for the vanilla yogurt and I put a touch of melted light butter into my topping with a bit of water to hold it all together.  I let the batter sit for about 45 minutes before I baked them.  These are delicious and I'll be making them often.

YUM!  Had a lonely sweet potato sitting around and wasn't sure what I was going to do with it, so I thought I'd try these muffins.  They are so good!  I used applesauce instead of the oil per other suggestions & used only 1/2 cup of honey.  Other than that, kept everything else the same for the muffin ingredients.  The taste is perfect!  Not too sweet, but sweet enough.  The oat topping is a nice touch!  I halved the topping & it was just the right amount for 18 muffins.  Thank you so much for this recipe!  Will definitely be making these again.  :)

Love these! I baked per recipe except that I took the advise of others and used only 1/2 cup of Agave instead of 1 cup of honey.  I did use 1 cup of reg whole wheat flour and 1 cup of white whole flour.  I also halved the amount of topping and it was plenty.  My sweet potato was pretty large and these came out so moist and not too heavy, maybe due to the white whole wheat flour.  Will make often!  Thanks for this lovely recipe!

I had a can of sweet potatoes I was itching to use up and found this recipe.  I had no idea how much to use so I used 3/4 of the 15 oz can.  It seemed to be just right.    I used 1/4 cup Agave sweetener plus a few more squirts after checking the batter.  I have a huge sweet tooth and I could stand to have these sweeter but then again they are still tasty.  I didn't want to bust out the blender so I just did the sugar and oats and cinnamon for the topping added a little melted butter to make them stick.   I can't wait to have an extra sweet potato laying around.  I am making these again!

Simple, moist & all four of my daughters like them! I used applesauce instead of oil, a whole, unrefined sugar instead of sugar, and used only 1/2 cup honey and they were great.   There was a lot of topping left, so either heap it on or throw it in the freezer for the next time you make muffins.

These are delicious.. sooo moist!  I used whole wheat pastry flour, which I prefer over regular.  I used plain yogurt instead of vanilla.  Next time I will cut the topping to about 1/3 the amount, and go easy on the honey, as they were a little sweet for my taste.

These were quite tasty and healthy. I reduced the honey to 3/4 cup and they were still sweet enough. I will make them again, only next time I will add more spices as they needed just a tad more zing, and the topping made much  more than I actually needed, so I'll halve that.

These were so adaptable!  I used left over sweet potato casserole.  I had about 2-3 cups that was topped with a pecan brown sugar topping not marshmellows.  I also did like other readers and added brown sugar instead of honey.  Did not have enough yogurt so added milk to thin since the brown sugar didn't add moisture.  Filled my muffin cups to the top and instead of struesel topping, sprinkled with demera sugar and flax seeds.  My 5 kids loved it even though they knew they were made with the sweet potatoes from Thanksgiving that they are not fond of.  Will definitely keep this one.  Yummy!  PS.  Had to cook about 25 minutes but the muffins where huge and beautiful!

These are pretty nice muffins. Pretty light even though they are made with whole wheat flour. I upped the spices in the muffins and halved the topping (still too much, but a great compliment to these).  I think the yogurt is important in this recipe because the leavener used is baking soda which requires an acid to react to (all baking powder really is is baking soda with an acid added to make up for the absence of one in a recipe. Baking soda is also 4 times as powerful as baking powder, so if switching to a non acid dairy, one needs to also switch to baking powder and quadruple the amount). The size of sweet potatoes vary...mine was a bit small, so I would have prefered a bit more in my muffin (a measurement would have been helpful here instead of just "one sweet potato"). I got 14 nicely sized muffins out of this recipe, which took longer than the 15 minutes to bake.

These were delicious. I would give them five stars, except I thought that a cup of honey is overkill (I cut it down to 1/2 cup), the timing was off (I had to bake for about 30 minutes), and they would have been WAY to liquidy if I had put in the yogurt. With those changes, these are perfect.

I found a little bit more than a cup of organic sweet potato mash that I froze around December in my freezer that I needed to use. This competely fit the bill for what I needed. I scaled this recipe down to 12 servings. I used all the sweet potato I had, I used whole wheat WHITE flour and because the recipe called for more honey than I had, I used just under a half cup of honey and added a quarter cup of homemade organic applesauce. I did not have the full ingredients for the topping so I just skipped it. I was worried about the dough being a little too wet when finished folding the dry ingredients into the wet but the muffins came out moist and cooked up just perfectly. I didn't end up getting 12 muffins. I actually got 12 regular-sized muffins and 9 mini-muffins. The muffins turned out so beautiful looking and I'm quite happy with the end product. It was easily bendable to what I had on hand and it reduced down to my needs (the few extra mini-muffins were just an added bonus) The smell of them baking is almost like.....fresh gingerbread. I think these might be a little too sweet for me though my family thought they were very good. Next time, I'd like to add some fresh raisins, I think. GREAT way for me to use up something out of my deep freeze and it provides a healthy, cheap breakfast for my family. Win/win!

Excellent! Made some changes, instead of honey, I used 1/4 real maple syrup, 1/4 agave, 1/4 cup brown sugar. Used milk instead of yogurt and a really big sweet potato that I had boiled instead of baked. Used 1 cup unbleached flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour. Then topped with the mixture with no nuts. They came out really great!

this was a delicious way to use a leftover baked sweet potato (later found to use about 1 cup mashed sweet potato)!  I swapped the honey for sugar plus a little milk and all I had was plain yogurt but it didn't seem to matter.  the batter seemed a little thick to me but I still got moist and flavorful muffins... I thought the spices were perfect.  I did cut the topping back to 1/3c of everything, and that was plenty.  made 12 large muffins, or 24 mini muffins (perfect recipe for kiddos).  I even added in wheat germ and flaxmeal in place of some flour.  so tasty, and I don't think these muffins could have gotten any healthier!!

Great recipe, I am so pleased! Followed advice of one reviewer and microwaved the sweet potato to cut down on prep time, used brown sugar instead of honey (and only 1/2 cup), omitted cloves and threw in a 1/2 cup of sunflower seeds (for protein) and 1/2 cup chocolate chips (more kid-friendly in my house) and they were just great! Kids said they could not even taste the sweet potato! Will make this again, next time in a double batch as they disappeared fast (and were in fact intended for freezing for use in school lunches....) Thanks!

Oh yummy!! A perfect breakfast muffin! Edits: 1/2 cup honey, 1/2 cup milk instead of yogurt; cut the topping in half sans almonds and STILL it was a lot (I'll hold leftover topping for next batch). Be generous with the topping though as the surface expands during baking. My yield was six large and six medium muffins. They baked about 19 minutes. Dense but soft and perfectly sweet.

Fabulous recipe!  They were INCREDIBLY moist and flavorful.  My only complaint is that it calls for 1 sweet potato, but they come in many different sizes- a volume measurement would have been nice.  I will certainly be making these again!

These are really tasty and have a nice texture. I left off the topping and used only 1/2 c. sweetener. If you bake the sweet potato until it's really sweet and mushy no need for all that honey.

Way too sweet as written.  I use 1/2 cup of honey instead of 1 cup.  I also use plain yogurt, and they're still plenty sweet.  I never bother with the topping.

Amazing! I added some chopped prunes and used flax instead of eggs (1TB flax + 3TB water = 1 egg). The topping was delicious but the recipe makes wayyyy to much. I was generous with it and still have enough topping for a second batch. I saved the leftover topping in my pantry, because I will be making this recipe again! Also, I used a stoneware cupcake pan and needed to bake for 25 min. Thanks for a great recipe

These were good. I would have liked a recipe that specified the amount of sweet potato to use, I found myself wondering if mine was too big or too small, or if the amount even made a difference. I cut down the amount of honey to 1/2 cup, and found that the muffins were too bland for my liking. Next time I'll use 3/4 cup. My guests enjoyed them, though!

These muffins are great!  I substituted applesauce for oil and only used 1 of the 2 egg yolks and they turned out perfect.  I made them into mini muffins so I can have a few and not a lot of guilt. **Revised rating to 4 stars from 5 because I think there's too much honey in the muffins.  They are very sticky to eat and don't keep well.  First time around though, they are great.

Yum, this recipe made delicious muffins that I can feel good about eating!  Only problem, how do you keep the muffins from sticking to the paper muffin cups???  I only had 1/3 cup of honey so I used that plus 3 Tbsp of Agave Nectar and they are plenty sweet.  Also, my sweet potato was massive so I used about 2/3 of it.  Thank you for the wonderful, healthy recipe!

I listened to everyone's suggestions of halving the topping, and I still had some left over! For the batter, I substituted vegetable oil with extra virgin olive oil. and instead of 2 cups wheat flour, I did 1 3/4. The other 1/4 I used oats. I also substituted honey with 1/2 brown sugar and the yogurt with 1/2 skim milk. Baking this in a 9x5 loaf took ~50 minutes. It's perfectly moist and nutty.

4 for the healthiness. 3 1/2 for the taste. this is by by no means gross or even average tasting, but its nothing special. you should definitely try this once b/c the sweet potato is such a unique ingredient. i made half with the topping and half w/out and w/ topping definitely tastes better. like others i used half flour and half oatmeal, one half cup brown sugar instead of 1 cup of honey, milk instead of yogurt. definitely halve or even third the topping b/c theres a lot of leftovers. if you are using brown sugar instead of honey definitely add the brown sugar to the dry ingredients instead of simply inserting where the recipe calls for honey. MIX and INCORPORATE the sweet potato well to insure that there arent random clumps of sweet potato in your muffins...not that that happened to me... ;]

Fantastic, just as written.  A good way to use leftover sweet potatoes (or I've substitued leftover butternut squash) from the holiday meal.  Next time I'll try the suggestion using the orange juice.

These are very good.  The only changes I made was I left out the nuts on top and I didn't have enough honey, so I substitued 1/2 white sugar for 1/2 of the honey.

These were absolutely phenomenal! I reduced the honey to 3/4 c and used applesauce in place of the oil. Healthy, hearty, and awesome.

We made these Sunday morning and served them with cinnamon honey butter from this site.  Very good.  I didn't have any ginger so left that out and used applesauce instead of the oil.  Had to increase the cooking time to 19min like others and cut the topping in half.  Great way to use up an extra sweet potato I had laying around.

These are absolutely delicious!  Moist and fluffy, not heavy at all.  I used 3/4 C brown sugar in place of honey, since I didn't have enough honey & other reviewers noted the sweetness.  I also used 1 C. of soy milk in place of the yogurt, and subbed applesauce for half the oil, and didn't notice anything unusual - they turned out delicious.  Particularly tasty warmed and eaten with a little natural applesauce (reminds me of ginger bread with applesauce, which is a favorite sort of "old-fashioned" treat).  These would really be good without the topping, too, if you didn't have oats and nuts, but it was a nice addition.  I will use this recipe again - thank you!

Trying to start a Food Revolution in our home, and eat healthier.  These muffins satisfy my sweet tooth, while ensuring that my kids are getting a healthy snack/breakfast.  The only change I made was cut back the honey to about 1/2 cup and made only half the topping (and still had some left over).  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly, and they turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very, very good! I am not a sweets fan and was worried these would be more like candy, but I was worried for nothing. Like others, I used 1/2 c Agave instead of honey, but otherwise I stayed true to the recipe.

VERY GOOD MUFFINS!  Very tasty and moist. My kids liked them too.  This recipe is a definite keeper!
I don't like bland food so I did not level off the spices when measuring in the measuring spoons. I think that was the way to go.

Excellent.  Followed other reviews and substituted unsweetened applesauce for oil and 1/2 c brown sugar for honey.  I did not make the topping because I was making mini muffins and just couldn't visualize fitting the topping on the tiny muffins.  They were great even without the topping but next time I will make the topping.  Made these again and used the topping even on the mini muffins.  These are great to sneak a vegetable into the grandchildren.  We found that the extra topping is really good on oatmeal.

Very good muffins, got a 4 out of 5 because not enough sweet potato flavor, would use more than just one large sweet potato in future.

So delicious!!! I doubled these, following the recipe except reduced the honey to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup of molasses. Perfectly sweet and so tender. I've finally made muffins like I've always wanted to make! Thanks so much for this recipe!

These are awesome muffins! They were a new recipe for a friend's lunch visit, and she requested the recipe.  Very moist and fluffy.  After going to the cupboard, I realized I only had 1/3 c. honey, so I substituted the remaining 2/3 c. w/ maple syrup.  It was delicious!  Will definitely make again.

This is one excellent muffin that freezes well!  I used organic white whole wheat flour and only 3/4 cup of honey.  I upped the spices a bit and instead of brown sugar for the topping I used coconut sugar.   I dare anyone to detect that this is a 100% whole grain muffin when made with www flour!

These were very good when they first came out of the oven. However, within a few hours all the sweet potato turned a bright, moldy green! The muffin looked like it was full of gooey boogars....really, really weird, I don't know why it would do that. I used apple sauce instead of oil, maybe that's it.  Anyway, normally I'm not a picky eater put the appearance really put us off and the rest of them never got eaten, grew greener everyday, and were eventually tossed.

These were fantastic! I cooked my sweet potato in the microwave. Used my homemade vanilla extract & pumpkin pie spice. Added a little under 1/4 cup of wheat germ. Used 1/4 c honey, 1/4 c agave & 1/4 sugar free pancake syrup. I was surprised how moist they are with so little oil. I did use Activa fiber yogurt. I didn't have any almonds, so for the topping I mixed up my homemade brown sugar splenda blend with oat bran & crushed walnuts. Super good muffin, thanks!

Well I made this recipe with the modified changes. They were tasty. But a little dry. The smell was nice while they were cooking. I think the dryness came from maybe me overcooking them alittle. But I will tyr again.

These are wonderful!! I made suggested changes from other reviews, also......ie. 1/2 the amount of honey, 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce (to cut down on the amount of oil).  The topping makes enough for a double batch of muffins.  For those of you who raise sweet potatoes in your garden and they are bigger than a typical sweet potato from the store.......I used about 1 cup of sweet potato and it was great (add a little bit more if the batter looks too dry.  ENJOY!!

Yummy and healthy! I replaced 1 cup of flour with 1 cup ground up oatmeal. I took the advice of other reviewers and used 3/4 cup honey. Used apple sauce instead of oil. I also let it sit for about 30 minutes after all ingredients were mixed together. I did not make the topping. I also used a fairly large sweet potato (6-7 inches). Makes a great breakfast muffin with a glass of milk or juice to top it off.

Only two people in my family like sweet potatoes, but all four of us really liked these muffins. I reduced the honey to 3/4 cup and used 1/2 cup of 2% milk instead of yogurt. Oh, I also cheated for the sake of ease and used canned yams. I will cut the topping by 1/2 next time. There was too much left over. Thanks for the recipe.

4 9 14 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/148555/whole-wheat-sweet-potato-muffins/ ... Wow, so many glowing reviews. 'Think I'd like it if an amount were there instead of "One sweet potato."  Those babies can range.  Mine worked out to be a cup & a half.  I halved the honey that everyone suggested, which I subbed with brown sugar.  (Hey, I didn't have any! :D)  I didn't add the cloves because I thought the ginger would provide enough "bite," which it really didn't.  This is a very mellow muffin!  :)  Mine made twelve beautiful - I mean, beautiful - round topped muffins.  Gorgeous.  With all the complaints too much sugar, I used 2T brown sugar & 1T plain breadcrumbs for the topping.  Lemme tell ya, I think with the oat-brownsugar-almond-cinnamon topping, you'd want less sugar in it.  Without it, you're probably fine as it's stated.  They wanted to stick to the wrappers even after cooling, but not a lot.  Moist quickbread texture, but muffin look.  Mine were done in 25 minutes.  These don't taste as healthy as they are - so the kids might eat them.  Ha! ;D  Boy child, 16, three down in less than three hours.  Success! ...  2/2018: HI NANNY!  :D

ABSOLUTELY LIFE CHANGING!  I am a novice baker and undertook this endeavor a bit carelessly.  My niece and I did this more as a bonding and educational activity with no real dreams of grandeur...and then we tasted the finished product...and eyes wide...breath indrawn...fingers pressing against the plate to get every stray crumb...we realized this was no ordinary recipe and not your average muffins.  They were gone in minutes once word caught about how delectable they were.  Only changes I made was brown sugar instead of honey, added 1/4 teaspoon of allspice and added 4 tablespoons of butter to the streusel topping.  We decided to name them... drum roll please... Yummy Yammies! :)  Enjoy!

Good recipe. I used 1/4 C yogurt and 1/4 C almond milk. My batter was still pretty thick so I added another 1/8 C of milk. Kids loved em!

Sweet Potato makes it Fiber-licious! Definitely cut back to half cup honey and I used applesauce in place of oil. Way too much topping so I will leave that out. I like a muffin I can pick up and walk around with or eat at work so no topping for me but will add to batter chopped nuts. Otherwise, a healthy muffin with lots of fiber!

I loved this recipe!  I cut back on the sugar a little as suggested by others (1/3 cup agave and 1/3 cup brown sugar).  I also increased the spices just a touch.  The topping was way too much as others have stated, but I saved the extra and have since used it on my morning oatmeal and in mashed sweet potatoes for dinner.  Loved both addtitional uses.  I might actually keep this on hand to do that more often.

I might have given it 4 stars if I had followed the recipe exact, but i became weary of the sweetness after reading reviews.  In my opinion, 2/3 to 3/4 of a cup of honey would be enough, but half a cup was not, for sweetness.  They could have been a tad sweeter, might try brown sugar instead of honey next time. Now that being said, this is still the best way to incorporate sweet potato into a picky eaters diet.  I thought they came out moist, not too heavy and just delicious.  If I had put more honey I mightve eaten all of them in one sitting! I substituted oil for unsweetened applesauce, yogurt for milk, 1 cup of honey to a half, cloves and ginger for allspice. Might switch to the yogurt as well next time.  Only reason I didn't use it was because I didn't have it.  And one more thing: I would probably put them directly into the muffin pan- I can barely get half the muffin out of paper cups!

These are very savory. I don't like overly sweet so did not use all the honey, but wish I had. I'm not sure if that would have just made them sweeter or hushed some of the spice but I don't think it would make them too sweet. I would probably reduce the seasoning a little next time. I'm not sure if it's the ginger but there is a little of a lingering bite to them. I was short on time so instead of processing the topping I just sprinkled on sliced almonds, natural sugar, and crushed oats but I will definitely make the topping next time. I didn't have vegetable oil so I used 3Tbl melted butter and 2Tbl ground flax. The batter was very thick and they turned out just a tad dry but that could be the honey and perhaps not enough sweet potato??? I'll use a bigger one next time. I only got 11 big "regular" muffins and though they were still gooey at 12 min, they did bake in less than 15 min at 375.(My muffins seem to over-brown in my new pan so I reduced the temp) I think these would be yummy with some apple butter or apple cider.

Yum!  These smelled sooo good when they were cooking, I couldn't wait to try one.  And they did not disappoint.  I scaled this for 12 muffins and had to make some substitutions.  I had only a couple tablespoons honey, so I used pure Louisiana cane syrup, and I substituted a third of the ww flour witih ground pecans.  I didn't have vanilla yogurt and used buttermilk.  And I added allspice and cardamom and eliminated the cloves.  I also used avocado oil for the vegetable oil and used some apple butter in place of some of the oil and buttermilk (not quite enough buttermilk).  Because these were a last-minute decision to make to use up a leftover baked sweet potato, I skipped the topping and sprinkled with demara sugar instead.  I'll have to try as written sometime, but I'll definitely be making these again soon as I did this time!  They are so light and tender, and I can really taste the sweet potato and cane syrup.  Please take the time to bake the sweet potato, and bake until it's very soft and the skin is browned on the bottom and pulled away from the potato;  you will be glad you did!  Canned doesn't compare.

Healthy and tasty! I only had about 1/2 w/w flour left so I used a/p and ground flaxseed to make up the rest. I also used less honey following the reviewers' suggestions. Instead of almonds, I used pecan for the topping and also added some to the batter (toasted before putting them in). Because I wanted to get rid of all the leftover I ended up using more sweet potato than called for, so I had to cook longer (at least 20 min), but still delicious (albeit a little sticky). Will make them again in fall! (It's summer here. :))

Just baked these. My husband and I both liked them
alot. Makes a great snack item. Used whole wheat flour, used a can of sweet potato, used brown sugar
instead of honey. I didn't have enough honey.
I'll definitely make these again. I am always looking for healthy recipes for snack items.

You could´t tell they are whole wheat, and less made from sweet potatoes.  I added applesauce instead of oil, 1/2 cup honey instead of 1 cup and lowered by half the topping ingredients.  Used just 1 medium sweet potato.  Great recipe that will do over and over again !

This has become a GO-TO recipe for me!  I use my own homemade granola as a topping but I liked this topping as well.  Fantastic to take as a gift or to a bakesale/potluck as a fresh yummy option that replaces old tired rolls.

Awesome recipe - I subbed 1c brown sugar and appx 2 tbsp water for the honey; yams for sweet potatoes; and did 1/2 cardamom 1/2 cinnamon instead of just cinnamon. The crumble recipe made way too much topping, though.

These are amazing and so moist... no one would ever guess they are super healthy, too.  Even my 6 year old said they would be 'awesome' in her snack or lunch.  Definitely a keeper recipe.  For the topping, I just used oat flour and mixed with the other ingredients (I chopped slivered almonds) and that saved dirtying the food processor.

Wowza....just made these for my preschoolers class as a "first day of autumn" snack (the grocery stores are out of pumpkin puree) and man are they good!  Wish I had double-batched them cuz I only had one extra and it is G.O.N.E!  I did sub-out brown sugar for honey and used white flour but 1/2'd the oil for ground flax and they still taste pretty hearty/healthy.

I used 1/2 cup of honey and substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil. It wasn't quite sweet enough for my tatse, but I have a mighty sugar tooth. These were really healthy and a great grab and go breakfast idea.

Had all the ingredients on hand, so I thought I'd give it a whirl. The sweet potato I used, yielded 1 3/4 cups and I ran out of honey, so I had to use a 1/4 cup agave nectar...so much for having all the ingredients. They turned out so well! I think next time I will use half honey & half agave nectar (as I am not a huge honey fan). Molasses and maple syrup would also probably work in place of honey...giving it a true autumn taste. I also just purchased a new spice blend from Wildtree that has all the spices in it, so I am excited to try that as well. Oh the possiblities! Thank you zanyzaynab for sharing your recipe!

Wonderful!  Changes were to use egg beaters and Fat free mayo in place of the oil.  Also omitted the cloves - personal preference.

Delightful! I added chopped dates, subbed applesauce for 1/2 the butter, milk for the yogurt and maple syrup for the honey. I also skipped the topping and just sprinkled slivered almonds on top! Tasty, healthy, and filling -- just what I was looking for!

I was very excited to try these while I was baking them.  The first ones we had, when they were still warm, were excellent.  But as they sat they got very gummy and we ended up throwing away what wasn't eaten the first day.  Also, mine did not rise very well, but that could have been my mistake in measuring.

I just made these today and my girls (5 & 3) we begging for more.  I followed some suggestions, used 1 cup Whole wheat flour 1 Cup quick oats, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup honey, substituted the oil for 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce and also substituted the yogurt for 1/2 cup low fat milk.  I skipped the topping all together.  These will become a lowfat snack/breakfast staple in our house.  Cooked for about 18 min.

These were pretty good.  I followed the recipe pretty closely, but replaced the oil with applesauce.  I also boiled the sweeet potatoes and mashed them instead of baking them.  Good healthy snack.

Very good. I used 1 cup of sweet potato, 1 cup of whole wheat flour, 1 cup of quick oats,(in place of the 2c whole wheat flour) 4 oz of applesauce (in place of the oil) and 1/2 cup of honey and the rest of the ingreds listed. For the topping I used a little less brown sugar and added a little agave nectar. Had to bake mine for 18 minutes. Made 16 sweet, spicy muffins

My picky 4 year old actually ate these up. He loved them! I am thrilled with this recipe. It is so tasty. I used canned yams the first time I made it and it turned out great. I used milk instead of yougurt also..2 thumbs up!

I am hooked on these muffins!  I did make some adjustments to lower the calories, and they turned out super moist and delicious, maybe too dense for some people's tastes.  Here's what I did: applesauce instead of oil, Splenda instead of honey, 4 egg whites instead of 2 whole eggs, 1c whole wheat flour and 1c blended rolled oats instead of 2c wheat flour.  Also, I cut the topping in half as many reviewers have and there was plenty.  Since I live in Hawaii, I used Molokai sweet potatoes, which are a deep purple color - this made the muffins look positively psychedelic!

I just tried it, and it was good. I listened to other people and used only 3/4 c. honey and I think they are definitely sweet. I wish I had listened to everyone though about the topping, I had way too much leftover. I didn't even get close to using half. I was very generous with the topping and had a few more muffins than what the recipe said. Very filling, so it will be great for snacks throughout the week.

These were pretty good. I listened to the other reviews and reduced the "sugar", but I will stick to the recipe next time. UPDATE: Have made these several times now. My mom suggested adding raisins and they turned out even better!

I followed others recommendations and did less than half the recommended amount of honey.  I don't think my sweet potato was big enough, so I added banana and extra yogurt.   Batter was pretty thick.  Baked 20 minutes and they were perfect.

I like these muffins & found them very moist & tasty even without the topping.
I cut the recipe to just 6 servings, and used a whole med. sweet potato and 1 whole egg, 1/4 t. cinnamon (might try more next time) . plus 1/4 t. allspice instead of the other spices. 3 T. maple syrup & 1 t. liq. stevia instead of honey. Used coconut oil instead of veg. oil. I might also add some diced cooked apple next time.

Good recipe.  Hard to know if you have the right proportions because of the variety of sizes of sweet potatoes.  If you leave about 1/4 empty at the top of each muffin opening you can get a lot more topping in there--I expected to have a lot left because of previous reviews but I used it all

I loved these muffins for breakfast! I peeled, sliced, and boiled my sweet potato instead of baking it. Much faster. Instead of using a full cup honey, I used a half cup and added 1/4 cup brown sugar. I used 1/2 cup 1% milk instead of the yogurt. I also only used half of the topping recipe which was perfect. They baked for about 17 minutes.

WOW!!! I've made a lot of muffins, but these jumped to the top of the delicious list after the first bite. 

I used walnuts in place of almonds and olive oil in place of vegetable oil. Wonderful!

I added some chopped pineapple. And, to reduce the sugar for a diabetic and cut fat,  I substituted applesauce for the oil, cut the amount of honey in half and used just a small amount of Splenda brown sugar in the topping.   As others have mentioned, the amount of topping ends up about 3 times what you need.

One of the great things about Allrecipes is reading the reviews!  These muffins are very good, and moist.  I took note of the reviews suggesting cutting back on the sweetener, and used 1/2 cup brown sugar in the muffin instead of the cup of honey.  No yogurt on hand, so I used 2/3-3/4 cup almond milk, with about 1/4-1/2 tsp. cider vinegar.  I used an additional 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, and thought of subbing applesauce for oil, but it was only 1/4 cup oil, so I stuck with the recipe.  Prepare just half the topping, and that is plenty for 12 muffins.  A neat tip I tried today that I recently read is to start the muffins out at 425 degrees for 5 minutes, then turn the oven down to 350 for the rest of the baking (do not remove the muffins from the oven when decreasing the temp).  I baked for an additional 15-16 minutes for my oven.  The muffins rose beautifully with a nicely rounded top.  Usually I bake muffins at about 385 degrees regardless of recipe instructions, and they are always good, but don't get rounded tops.  Today's method did, so I learned something new!

I thought this was a good recipe, I did use 1/3 of the honey listed to reduce the sugar. Another modification is a blended the sweet potato, a banana and the yogurt in the blender then added it to the rest of the wet ingredients. Nice way to sneak in a fruit to the recipe and add natural sugar.

I had only plain Greek yogurt instead of vanilla. With that said, these muffins were still adequately sweet and super moist. I used approximately 2 cups of baked sweet potato; I will make these again. Thank you for the successful and tasty recipe!

These are so good! I made a couple of the substitutions suggested in the comments: 1/2 cup agave nectar instead of 1 cup honey, and natural applesauce instead of vegetable oil. These cut down the calorie count a lot and the muffins are still great. They're sweet but not too sweet. They're very moist, and they kept well for a few days in the fridge, unlike a lot of homemade muffins. This recipe only made 12 muffins for me, and I had a ton of the topping left over. No other complaints. I found myself wondering what it would taste like with walnuts or pecans inside... maybe I'll try that the next time I make them!

These were actually pretty good, but i read other reviews and made the following changes.  Used 1 C. each of flour &  quick cook oats, reduced the honey to 1/2 C. , increased the spices a little, omitted the topping-didn't have almonds or enough oats to make it.   I used approx. 1 & 1/2 C of Yams.  The muffins came out just right & really tasty.  I used Presidents Choice Vanilla greek yoghurt.    Made 12 muffins, they needed to be baked for approx. 20-23mins.  My oven is a convection, so i had to check them at the 18min mark.  Would definitely make these again.  Thanks.

These are awesome. They stay moist and delicious even when you freeze them! I'm lazy, so I skipped the topping and just sprinkled coarse (turbinado) sugar on top for a sweet crust before baking. The honey is completely unnecessary - save the calories and cut it in half or leave it off completely!

I've learned that the easiest way to cook a potato/squash is to microwave it before using. I did this for the recipe and saved myself 40 minutes (let's not discuss the possibilities of toxins from microwaving). Also, I took out half of the honey, substituted applesauce for most of the canola oil (left 2 T of oil) and they came out great. Required more than 15 minutes of cooking time for me but once done, tasted just like any old fatty muffin, but better. :) When served with whipped cream cheese, it's' amazing. The only thing I might do next time is leave big chunks of sweet potato instead of mashing it altogether.

This is a great base recipe!   I would give it 5 stars but I made a few additions that I think make this recipe so good!  I used Plain non fat greek yogurt, 1/2 cup of honey, flax meal (I just dumped some in and found it did not effect the end result even with leaving the flour as is), I used whole wheat pastry flour, applesauce instead of oil, pumpkin seeds instead of almonds for the topping because that is what I had on hand.  I had to bake these about 21 minutes but they were so yummy!  I got 24 mini muffins.  The topping is great for 2 batches.  One of the better healthy muffins I have made.  Great texture.  My toddler loves them and so do I.  I worked out the calories to be about 103 calories for a mini muffin.  Enjoy!

Yummy! I only rated 4 as written because the honey and topping can be greatly reduced. But with those reductions, an excellent, moist muffin that sneaks in veggies!

Very good healthy muffin. Used white whole wheat flour, subed allspice for the spices, plain greek yogurt, and 1/2ed the honey. Turned out very moist so I kept them in the fridge. Does not taste at all like sweet potatoes for anyone who thinks it sounds like a weird ingriedient for muffins

These were so good! Used vanilla greek yogurt instead of regular yogurt, and 3/4 cup of honey instead of 1. Next time will substitute applesauce for oil. All in all a wonderful recipe!

Very good!  The topping mix made way too much, so I cut the amounts in half the next time around, and that was perfect.

Very tasty, moist, and sweet but not overly sweet. I used cooked and mashed squash and shredded raw carrots because I did not have a sweet potato on hand and it was delish!

I cut the honey in half, used unsweetened applesauce in place of oil, and halved the topping and they were still REALLY sweet to me.  I froze some of ours and reheat them for snacks.  They still come out moist and taste as though they were just made.  Next time I might lower the ratio of brown sugar on the topping...or even try mixing nuts/oats into the batter and leave the topping off completely.  Great recipe!

After baking an 8oz sweet potato I ended up with 1 cup mashed.  We don't like wheat flour so I just used white and reduced honey to 3/4, subbed applesauce for oil and plain nonfat yogurt for vanilla and skipped the topping all together.  These completely wow'd my boyfriend and basically vanished when I brought them to work

These muffins are amazing!  I read some of the reviews before starting (always a good idea), so I cut the sugar in half as well.  Seriously, a whole cup of honey!  that stuff is expensive.  So I used just half a cup of white suger.  Also, I tripled the yogurt, and used plain unsweetened no-fat.  The cooking time was double what is recommended, not sure if my oven is dying, or that these are just too moist and thick.  They are delicious, all the same, and this recipe is definitely a keeper.

I loved these!  I made last night!  So soft and very tasty!  I enjoyed every morsel!  I have no complaints at all!  I tweaked recipe of course because I am a tweaker!  I used sugar instead of honey but only 1/2 cup. Buttermilk instead of yogurt.

These are great.  I subbed applesauce for vegetable oil and milk for yogurt and cut the honey down to 3/4 cup.  I made half the topping recipe (which was still plenty), omitting the almonds.  Mine baked for 18 minutes.

This was fantastic! I used 3/4 c. of honey and then made up the difference with 1/4 c. maple syrup.  I think they would have been fine without the maple syrup.  They were plenty sweet.  I also used leftover mashed sweet potatoes (about 1 cup) that had already been seasoned with cinnamon and nutmeg and mixed with a bit of milk and earth balance spread.  The topping did have trouble sticking on, but I would still do it again.  The more the muffins "mature" the more the topping stays put!  Great recipe!  My three year-old loved it!

These turned out good - moist and an interesting flavor! Changes, as recommended: applesauce instead of veg oil, only 1/2 c of honey, milk instead of yogurt. For the topping, I didn't have enough oatmeal or brown sugar, so I just used almonds and cinnamon. Next time I'll use brown sugar instead of honey - and more of it - maybe what the recipe says. :)

these were yummy! i added some dried cranberries to the mix and used less honey and added orange juice like other reviewers suggested. they were still sweet with the brown sugar! however i had some beefs with this recipe - the sweet potato baking time was not enough, it was easy enough to peel but did not mash well it was still hard and i ended up with chunks of potato in the muffins. also i only had one muffin dish which made 12 so i ended up using a lot more mix per muffin but they took so long to cook and were still underdone. maybe that was my fault i suppose. they were still super good though i will make them again!

These taste really great.  I steamed my sweet potatoes for 16 minutes before mashing.   I didn't have the cloves or ginger, just added extra cinnamon & nutmeg and they were great.  Kids loved them!

These are sooooo good and healthy to boot! I used apple sauce instead of oil, 1/2 cup agave nectar w/1/2 cup honey and used walnuts instead of almonds. I will definitely make these again. Great use of a sweet potato!

Good healthy alternative when you have a sweet tooth.  The only small issue I had is the topping.  It fell off very easily and was hard to eat.

Theese were quite good-my hubbie loves that they are healthy.  I subbed brown sugar for the honey, and cut it back to 1/2 cup (wow, who has a whole cup of honey to use in just one batch of muffins?!) I also subbed applesauce for oil and used fat free yogurt. They needed just a little something more, so next time I may add a little more of the spices.

Very good!  I agree with a previous reveiwer that the topping is like "sawdust."  However, the rest of the muffin is great!  I might just use brown sugar and cinnamon for the topping next time.

The recipe is very good! However, I had to leave them in the oven 10 minutes extra and with the quantities above, I only made 12.   But the recipe is very good. Very tasty and flavorful!

This was pretty good for a "healthy" recipe. I love sweet potatoes so I thought I'd give it a try. My only complaint is the whole wheat flour made them very dense and thick. I did substitute some of the flour for oats, but next time I think I'll do more - probably half oats, half whole wheat flour. They were good.

If I could give TEN stars I would!!  If your reading this, you've got to make this!  I had no yogurt, used 1/2 cup hole milk and had to use allspice and canned sweet patatos (one can is plenty). I also used part oats for the flour because I love oats . . I LOVE IT, its sooooo moist!! Thank you so much for posting this!! :)  I will be making it forever.

Very good - I used half whole wheat and half oat flour, and I reduced the honey to abut 3/4 cup. and I think they could have used the extra 1/4 cup as the only real sweet part was the topping.  I ended up with 12 muffins, and had a lot of topping mixture leftover, so next time I'll use half quantities for that.  You could even omit the topping and you'd still have a nice muffin!  Very tasty and I will make again!

Delicious and easy to make. I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup honey. I also used 1/2 cup milk instead of yogurt. We didn't think they were too sweet but we had them for dessert not breakfast.

Very very good!!  I did use applesauce instead of oil, Splenda instead of honey, skim milk instead of yogurt, and canned yams instead of a whole sweet potato.  I didn't use the topping.  Instead I topped it with 1 tablespoon of fat free cool whip (only 15 calories!).  Very nutritious breakfast to start out our day!!  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent muffin recipe! Only change I made was to use plain yogurt in place of vanilla because that is what I had. The kids love them and they're healthy! You probably could reduce sugar content by 1/4 of cup if you are going to use the topping to make it even healthier.

These muffins were quite good.  Perhaps the potato I used was a bit small because I didn't get a lot of sweet potato flavour from these, but they were very moist and a good breakfast muffin.  One small change - I added raisins (I like raisins).
