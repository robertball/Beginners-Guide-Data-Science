These brownies were good,  but not what i was expecting or hoping it to be. THe batter and brownies were extremely cakey, not what i really like in a brownie. However, when you are making these, be sure to beat your egg whites only when they are needed at the exact time, because i did mine beforehand and by the time a needed them, they had sunk into a liquid that could not be re-beat. I ended up using more than ten eggs! 
If you like cakey brownies, though, these would be the brownies for you.

thought these were very good. more like a cake brownie, be sure to whip your egg white nice and stiff.
