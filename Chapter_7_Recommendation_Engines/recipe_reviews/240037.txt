Very good flavor! I love the addition of the cinnamon. Definitely don't leave it out! I used unsweetened almond/coconut milk blend because I didn't have soy milk. I split the mixture between 4 bowls. This gets REALLY thick. I ended up having to add an extra 2-3tbsp milk to each bowl. Next time I will use about half the amount of chia seed. You really don't need that much chia for it to thicken the pudding. I also ended up adding a bit more honey than stated (personal preference).  I topped it with a few raspberries. I was able to eat this after 20mins or so. It didn't need an hour to set. Makes a great breakfast or nighttime snack. Thank you completenovice!

Made this for quick breakfasts.  On the advice of the other reviewer, I reduced the chia seed by half and that was more than plenty.  Also, I agree that the mixture doesn't need to set for more than 20-30 minutes.  I omitted the hemp seeds.  I portioned out into 4 bowls and topped with slivered almonds, chocolate chips, and sweetened coconut.  This was my first time working with chia seeds, really interesting and delicious.

This is a good and hearty breakfast!  I used agave nectar instead of honey.  I liked it with a little more sweetener and a bit more cinnamon and loaded up with frozen mixed berries.

This is quite tasty but way too thick as the other reviewers mentioned. I used the proportions written but used coconut milk instead of soy. It was seriously thick and had to add about a quarter cup of extra liquid to get it to a pudding consistency, which I added after the one-hour rest period.  It keeps in the fridge well making it an excellent candidate for a party dessert that won’t bust your buckle or budget. Thank you for the recipe.
