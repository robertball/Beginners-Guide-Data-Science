I give it 5 stars because it is easy AND delicious!
I used a little lime and lemon juice. I topped it w/fresh raspberries and dipped some raspberries in white chocolate for decoration. I used the leftover white chocolate for drizzle over the top.
I did read the other revies and used 12 ounces of cream cheese so it wasn't too sweet. I also noticed one person mentioned it didn't set. There is a trick. You have to whip it really well. Also, really cool things happen when you add lemon/lime juice to sweetened condensed milk. It helps it gel up and set.

Easy, double the cream cheese and have it at room temperature.  This cuts down on the over powering sugar.  I topped with blackberries.  Family winner.  Easy on the cook too.

Very simple recipe!  I used 16 oz. of cream cheese instead of 8 oz. and topped with fresh blueberries instead of pie filling.  Wonderful dessert!

This recipe is so very easy.  The thing that took me the longest was waiting for the cream cheese to soften and allowing my homemade frozen pie filling defrost.   After that, this recipe took 10 minutes, top, to put together.  Obviously, it still had to chill but I don't mind recipes where you make it then let it sit--it helps me with my time management to make things ahead anyway.  I followed some reviewer's suggestions to double the cream cheese, which worked well enough.  Until I went to fill my pie crust.  16 oz is a LOT, and I couldn't put it all in the pie crust--as it was, I ended up using most of it but skimping on the pie filling since I'd already put the cream cheese in.  I was using a store bought pie crust, but be prepared for leftover cream cheese mixture if you double it and have a small pie pan.  It didn't faze me for long, though:  I made little cheesecake trifles with the rest of the mixture, some of the pie filling, blueberries, and topped with a cherry.  It was very pretty and very good.  I had absolutely no issues with this setting--it was definitely firm after less than 2 hours.  I did make sure to mix the cream cheese and condensed milk very well, then mixed very well again after adding the lemon juice.  This made bf very happy--he loves cheesecake.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the essential in-a-hurry-pie recipe.  The cherry topping can be substituted with whatever you have on hand.  Foolproof, every time.

good recipe very easy but just one package of 8oz cream cheese did not work.  Instead i had to start all over again and use a total of 2 1/2 8oz packages of cream cheese.  The end result was satisfying.

Ensure that the cream cheese is very soft otherwise you will end up with small chunks in pie.

5 stars for ease and no baking needed during this heatwave!  I don't know why some people had the issues they had with this pie.  I followed the recipe to the letter except used apple pie topping b/c that's what I had.  I didn't think the filling was too sweet, and it set up nicely in fridge.  It is a bit rich so you don't need a lot.  The key is to use the electric beaters to cream the cream cheese and sweetened condensed milk until light and fluffy.

This was the easiest and fastest dessert I have ever made. It tastes great too. I did use the 2 packs of cream cheese with everything else remaining the same. I got the whole bowl into the crust and will use pie filling as a side or addition after plating. Not all family members like pie filling but most like plain cheesecake. Yummy. Made me lick the spoon!

This is quite good. Was a bit skeptical---a no-bake pie with said ingredients, and not having a fruit topping. I am pleasantly surprised! I used 16ozs. of cream cheese based on reviews. As I was mixing, I found the flavor a bit too cheesy, so I added about half a cup of confectioner's sugar. Next time, I'll use less cream cheese, but still more than the recommended 8ozs. I also added a dash of vanilla. This pie is so delicious, so dangerous---I just had a piece after my eggs and bacon breakfast. It's simple to make---even foolproof; I won't need to refer to the recipe every time I go to make it. Again, I didn't top with fruit, but it is still superb. I can only imagine how it would taste with strawberries. Yum. I think I found the pie of my dreams---literally; I never imagined a pie like this.

After reading reviews, I did use 2 pkgs. of cream cheese.  I also added 1 cup of fresh blueberries to the mixture and topped it with 1 cup of fresh blueberries.  This was very good, quick and easy to prepare.

This was good, but not great. It was much sweeter than I had expected and I added an extra 8 ounces of cream cheese like suggested. I would not eat it without a fruit topping, my husband agreed and he usually avoids fruit toppings. It is sweet enough that we just crushed up some raspberries and didn't add any extra sugar to them. So a good dessert for quick and easy, but probably won't make again any time soon.

The recipe and reviewers' comments gave me some good ideas for a quick and easy desert with ingredients on hand.  Five stars with modifications.  
Instead of a graham cracker crust, I crumbled 8 reduced fat oreos and spread across the bottom of a pie pan. For the filling, I used one package of Neufchatel cheese, half a can of sweetened condensed milk (based on reviewers' comments), 1/3 cup lemon juice, and ~1/4 cup or less powdered sugar (to thicken and sweeten in place of some sweetened condensed milk). For the topping: ~2cups frozen berries, corn starch and water, 1 tbsp lemon juice, 1 tbsp honey; bring to a boil then let cool before placing on top of chilled pie.  Really tasty, all thumbs up in our house.  
After having it as described above, I suspect that an entire can of sweetened condensed milk would be overpowering with just 1pkg cream cheese, as noted by some other reviewers.

Could never find this recipe anywhere until now...  My mother had it, but we never knew where she got it from and that was YEARS ago.  I would request this every year for my birthday!  She would always make a 9x13 casserole dish size of this! LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOVE IT!  (Notes:  Let cream cheese come to room temperature...  I use 1/4 cup of lemon juice and then you just let the beaters beat the stuffings out of the mixture...)  Did I already say that I LOVE THIS!  ;)

Easy and quick. I don't think a pie pan works very well for this, so I make it in an 8x8.  I melt 3 TBSP of butter in my 8x8 and then add 1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs and 3 TBSP of sugar for the crust.  Turns out perfectly every time and lets those OCD people get over not having perfect pie slices.  It is definitely more like a 9x13 layered dessert than a pie, but--oh boy!--is it delicious!

Could this be any easier?!  Love it!  I did double the cream cheese, as suggested, but wouldn't have minded it sweeter, either.

Ive been making this pie for years! Its never failed to please my 'sweet tooth'. Instead of cherries, etc, I dribble chocolate syrup on the top with/without chocolate chips. Hmm, hmm, good!

I used fat free condensed milk.  Wasn't sure if it would set.  It turned out perfect.  I used half the amount of topping though.  Blueberry pie filling.

This was great. Everyone loves it. It is sweet so you don't need much. I used canned cherry pie filling for one, and blueberry filling for another. Very easy and fast. SO use a mixer for the cream cheese and milk.

I was so happy to find this because I had lost my mother's recipe and this is it! I made it with 12 oz of cream cheese, but next time I will make it exactly as the recipe calls for it.  I will make it with Strawberries next time, as well...just to change it up.  So delicious! (needs more than 2 hours to chill, though). Thank you for posting this!!!!!

Super easy and so good! I don’t understand why some people added another brick of cream cheese. I followed the recipe and there was plenty of filling and I didn’t find it too sweet at all. I whipped it for about 5 minutes with my stand mixer and it set great and was super fluffy.  I didn’t have pie filling so just cooked some frozen mixed berries with cornstarch and sugar for the topping. Will definitely make again!

For a fall treat, leave out the lemon juice and add a can (15 oz) pumpkin (not the pumpkin pie mix but just the pumpkin), 1 tsp vanilla and 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice.  It’s very similar to a pumpkin cheesecake but MUCH easier!

This pie is almost like the one that a coworker brings from a local berry restaurant... I increased the cream cheese mixture (8 oz cream cheese and double the others) thinking that I wanted more cream-to-berry than what some of the pictures showed.  LOL, good thing I bought two deep dish graham crusts because I had enough to fill both about 2/3 plus another little bit that I ate with fresh berries :) 

The berry mixture was amazing, I used raspberries and the flavor was so good... it completely captured the "fresh off the plant" berry taste that I was after.  I had a hard time waiting for it to cool before putting it over the cream, but man it was worth it.  Would definitely make it again!  Thanks for the recipe!

Easy standby. Just be sure to mix cream cheese in with an electric blender and not by hand do the cream cheese gets fully mixed in.

This was super easy to make. I used a store bought graham cracker crust.  I added both vanilla and almond extract to the mixture and used 1/4 lemon juice instead of 1/3 cup. I also used 2- 8 oz cream cheese packets to decrease the sweetness along with the can of condensed milk.
I didn't want or need any fruit topping because I was afraid of the sugar content with me being a diabetic.  This method cut down on the sweetness and the extra cream cheese made it look thicker and it settled beautifully!! I drizzled caramel on top to give it a color contrast and look professional! :)

Great recipe and super easy to make. 
TIP**  just make sure you mix the cream cheese and condensed milk extra well, then again after adding the lemon juice. It will make the filling look and taste flawless.  

Thank you for sharing the recipe

Maybe my all time favorite dessert; I've been making this since I was a teenager. I seldom use the pie filling, though a good corn-syrup- free homemade version takes it over the top. Usually I just add a squeeze of lime or lemon and serve with fresh fruit or by itself. It's important to use a sugar-free graham cracker crust made with real butter.

This pie did not set up for me even though I followed the directions carefully. Noted other people had the same problem so I beat it for 
eight minutes and for three more after adding the lemon. Tasted good though, we ate it like pudding.

One of the best no-bake pies out there, easy, and so delish. Was hoping for more left overs, oh well, just make another one because its so easy. Per other comments, for best results, really beat the mixture for best results. Thank you for a most fantastic recipe!

Great cream cheese pie. I was surprise with it way it turned out after adding sweet condense milk to it. Usually I would prepare my cream cheese pie using white powder sugar in place of sweet condense milk, but, n=enjoy both methods. What I would recommend is adding 2 blocks of cream cheese, instead of 1 block, wherein mixture is not stiff enough with only 1 block.

I also used 2 packages of cream cheese. I didn't have sweetened condensed milk, so I used whipping cream and added about a cup of sugar. I couldn't wait for two hours, but after cutting it in only an hour later, it had already settled.

this had good flavor, but didn't set well, I put homemade raspberry jam and white chocolate shavings on top. I stuck it in freezer to help but then becomes too hard.

I did what was suggested and doubled the cream cheese, and found myself using a little more than double to get the right consistency. I had way too much filling for just one pie, so I made two. I used a little less lemon juice. This pie was very tasty.

Awesome!  I have been making this for years, and it is my family's favorite.  I have to make it at every holiday, potluck and just because days.

Delicious recipe!  My hubby said this tasted like the ones his family used to make when he was younger, which he loved!  Definitely a keeper!

How much is "1 cream cheese?"  Is it 1 lb. or 1 package?
What size?  Maybe I missed that.  Should be very good.
Thank you.
