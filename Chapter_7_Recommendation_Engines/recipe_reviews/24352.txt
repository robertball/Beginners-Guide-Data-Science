There is so much wrong with the directions and measurements.   1. it yields 12 regular muffins, not 6.  I suspect it might actually be a recipe for jumbo muffins and she forgot to mention that.  2. two apples made up more than 50% of the batter and was definitely too much so 1 apple is plenty.  3. She states to fill the cups to the top, however if you do, this is what you will end up with: 4 hours of scouring your oven and kitchen floor from all the overflow butter and sugar that leaked out of the oven.  Just follow the cardinal rule of muffins/cupcakes: never fill more than 2/3 full and you'll be fine.   4. Do NOT use 1/2 Cup butter for the "sprinkle" topping or you will end up with grainy pasty goo that will never (on planet Earth) sprinkle.  I suggest cutting back to 1/4 cup to keep the mixture on the dry side, allowing you to sprinkle it as she suggests.  I appreciated the taste she was going for.  Trust me, follow these 4 EASY corrections to this recipe and they will come out right!

Great muffins!  I substitute whole wheat flour for 1/2 cup of white, and I use about half brown sugar and half white.  I also use applesauce for half of the oil, and that works well.  I like Granny Smith apples in these muffins because they hold their shape and flavor nicely (I cut them into big chunks because I like the apples to be noticeable!).  I find that extra cinnamon doesn't dry these out because the apples are so moist.  And for the topping, I use 1/4 cup of softened butter instead of 1/2, and this seems to be plenty.  I wouldn't fill the muffin cups more than 3/4 because the muffins do rise, and the topping can be messy in the oven.    Overall, this is a great recipe--wonderful flavor, texture, sweetness, moistness, etc.  :)

The finished product tasted wonderful, but you really need to fill muffin tins with batter only two thirds full at most, and make only one third the amount of butter crumb mixture.  We spent the balance of our post muffin morning cleaning the horrible burned on mess in the bottom of our oven from too full muffin cups.  Filling the tin less would probably yield a full dozen normal sized muffins.  With this correction they should be excellent!

I liked this recipe, its simple and easy. I found that if you change some of the ingredients, like instead of 1.5 cups of sugar, I just used one; Instead of 2/3 cups of oil and milk i used 1/3 of both, added an extra egg and some hot water to replace the milk and oil, the mixture turns out more fluffy and light. Nice simple recipe tho :)

WARNING!  Do not fill the cups to the top as the recipe says!  You will have a big mess in your oven if you do.  Also, there was a lot of butter in the topping.  Next time I will make sure that I half the butter like others have suggested.

After having read previous reviews for this recipe, I modified it the first time out by adding more milk and doubling the cinnamon.  I also found that it yields an average of ten, rather than six and the topping was enough for two batches.  Overall, these were a hit with my family, with the changes I made, and they clamored for more once the first batch was gone.  As muffin recipes go, I thought these were pretty good.

This recipe was great!  It was very easy and quick, except for peeling and chopping the apples, but i guess there's no way around that!  I used 2 tsp. of cinnamon instead of one and also instead of 1/3 c. oil, i used 1/8 c. vegetable oil and 1/4 c. applesauce.  I got 12 muffins out of this.  They are delicious- a great way to get rid of some apples!

I did not read the reviews first. I wish I did because I ended up with a mess in the oven. Do not fill to rim like it says to. They were great though. I will be making them again.

I rate it a 5 off the way the recipe exists - and I had the recipe altered to make 12 muffins.  The batter filled 12 cups perfectly, but then grew out instead of up at all, which resulted in a very messy oven and lots of smoke.  For the topping, I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar which was really good.  The taste of the muffin was good, but a touch too sweet and a little flat.  Perhaps this could be fixed with just a dash of salt.

Delicious!  I liked that they were dense b/c it makes a filling breakfast muffin.  Was able to make 9 muffins.  Only thing odd was that the topping didn't mix well for me...In order to cube the butter, I took it straight from the fridge.  Maybe I did something wrong.  I ended up wasting a lot of the crumb topping b/c it looked like too much for the few muffins the batter made.

I've been wanting to do more baking with my daughters and we decided that we'd get up extra early (5:30) before school this morning to try this recipe.  They really turned out great! Three out of four of us loved them with the exception of my 8 year old (she just *liked* them). I think she expected something much sweeter almost like a cupcake, but if I wanted cupcakes for breakfast, I would have used a cupcake recipe - these were just the right amount of sweet for breakfast, especially for children...Perfect!

------------

Here are some tips and changes that I made to this  recipe:

I used apple sauce in place of the oil but I think next time I'll use half applesauce and half butter  or maybe even all butter just to see what I like best. I'm also going to try a small dollop of apple jam in the middle of each muffin, too, for an added touch.

As for the topping, I used an entirely different topping altogher and it was great - crumbly just as it should be.  Here it is for any of you who may want to try it... 
Crumbly Topping:
1/4 c light brown sugar, 
1/4 c all purpose flour, 
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon,
pinch of salt, 
3 tablespoons of oats, 
2 tablespoons of butter

Crumble in 2 tablespoons of butter into dry ingredients and sprinkle on muffins before baking.

Tip: As others have state, *definitely* only fill the cups halfway.  I did and the muffin tops were just picture perfect.

I put the muffins in for exactly 20 minutes and they came out just right.

Logic told me the quantities seemed off, but I disregardede my own instinct and went ahead anyway.  BIG MISTAKE.  If, I ever attempt these again, I shall follow the other user's hints and suggestions.

I love these muffins! They are amazing. While they were cooling I had to keep slapping my husbby's hand bc he kept trying to sneak one. I am glad I read other people's reviews. I cut back a bit on the apple, added some more cinnamon and cut back on the topping mix. I doubled this recipe so it was suppose to make 12 but made almost 3 doz.    I followed someone's suggestion of only doing 1/3 cup of oil and a 1/3 cup of milk and then added an extra egg and about 1/2 cup(ish) of hot water...resulting in nice and fluffy muffins.   I cooked them for about 23 min and they were perfect - 25 min was a bit too much. I also only filled the holes up about 2/3rds of the way so they wouldn't spill over.

After adopting some others' modifications, this recipe was great.  I used applesauce instead of oil, added 2 tsp. vanilla, omitted the topping and baked for 18 minutes.  My picky kids gobbled them up.  Plus, they aren't too sweet for breakfast.  Easy too!

I really wished I had read the reviews before making this recipe. It was definitely too much butter, left a mess in my oven and yielded 12 regular size muffins. Despite that, they were delicious! I will however use 3 apples next time, my kids love fruit!

I made substitutions to this to make it gluten free, dairy free. I use my own gluten free flour blend (sorghum, rice, buckwheat, and xanthan gum), use gluten free baking powder (you can also make your own) and I used rice milk, though you could use almond for an extra boost. I also used 3 apples, McIntosh, and added a 1/2 tsp more of cinnamon. This was sweet enough and didn't need the topping.
Next up is to try some variations to reduce the sugar content. I've made this recipe non gluten free before and it was good, but the gluten free flour blend I use is safe for the many people I know avoiding gluten and a bigger hit with my family. This made 12 regular sized muffins.

The previous reviews are correct, and if you take heed, this is an excellent recipe!  1.  Don't fill muffin tins to top.  2/3 full as usual.  2.)  Cut butter back to 1/4 c. for topping.  Though it seems like two apples makes the apple:batter ratio inappropriate, it really was spot on!  Very flavorful and moist!  Just adjust as above.  Thanks for the delicious breakfast!

Pretty good muffin! Made a few changes based on personal preference. Used 1/2c Whole Wheat Flour for some of the AP, Used 1/4c Brown Sugar for some of the white, and unsweetened applesauce for the oil.  Only needed 1 big apple as well.  I skipped the topping, because I like to freeze and reheat these for my preschooler's breakfast.  Made 12 regular sized muffins filled 2/3 full. Came out perfect (and tasty!) after 20 mins.  Will make these again!

Everyone is right about the stiffness of the original recipe and the excess of apples. This is what I did: 1 1/4 cups flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/3 cup white sugar, 1/2 t. salt, 2 t. baking powder, 1 1/2 t. cinnamon, 1/3 c. "Sarah's Applesauce", 1 egg, 1/2 cup milk, 1 apple- peeled, cored, and chopped. I also filled 12 muffins cups 2/3 of the way full. I chose not to use the topping, to save calories, and everyone loved them! And, if you bake them for about 16 to 17 minutes, they will be much more moist.

This recipe was quick and easy! I read the reviews and decided to just go with the original recipe. Muffins turned out perfect! I left the apples in approx. 3/4" chunks....gave the muffins a great texture! Oh, and I added a little vanilla! YUM! Thanks!

These muffins have the basis for excellent taste. 1 apple is plenty, double the cinnamon, and use only 1/4 cup butter for the topping, or else you will have a gooey mess. I also halfed the sugar into white/brown portions.

the first muffin recipe that i've been sucessful with, very moist and great texture. I got 11 regular sized muffins only filling by 2/3, but they didn't rise much over the cup edges, which i think muffins should. I added a little extra milk and cinnamon as per the other reviews and used a topping from another recipe (with less butter) i also added about 1/3 cup chopped walnuts, used one apple peeled & chopped and shredded the other with skin.

I used whole wheat white flour, cut the sugar back to a scant 1/3 cup and I used homemade applesauce in place for half the oil called for. For the topping, I used brown sugar and I halved the topping amount for just a touch of crumb topping. These turned out really good--even with my small healthier adjustments. Cutting the sugar and topping in half gave it just the right amount of sweetness without it being overkill. My kids especially liked these. Next time, I might try using apple pie spice in place of the cinnamon and I'd add a teaspoon of vanilla extract.

I made the entire recipe as instructed except for one thing, I halved butter in the struesel.  Another reviewer was right, it is far too much.  It was tasty but don't go to heavy on the topping, it's overpowering at times.

The recipe I will be revamping the next time.  I wish I would have looked at the reviews.  DO NOT fill to the top.  The edges over flowed like others and had a mess. I feel that this baker must have posted these messed up instructions on purpose.  And the butter mixture is to much as well.  
We could  not enjoy these as is, due to the muffins were still gooey and the tops were fried.

Perfect treat on a chilly morning. I made a few changes - applesauce in place of oil, 1 apple only, 1 tbl of cinnamon in the batter, 1/4 c. brown sugar, 1/2 c. white sugar. And I only used 1/4c of butter for the crumb topping. Made 12 regular sized muffins.   Everyone loved them, and they whip up fast, with ingredients I always have on hand in the winter months.

I give this 5 stars with the changes previously mentioned and a couple of my own. I did 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 white flours, and the same ratio with brown and white sugar. I used applesauce instead of egg and soy milk instead of cow's. I also added some finely chopped pecans to the topping and just a bit of allspice in the batter.

I love these muffins!  I made "Sarah's Applesauce" and used half of that and half the oil.  When I make these I can't help but make them the way you would with other recipe (mixing the flour, salt, baking powder, and cinnamon in one bowl and the egg, sugar, applesauce/oil and milk in another) just so everything doesn't get so over mixed that it makes the muffins too dense.  I took other suggestions: double the cinnamon and use 1/4 cup of butter for the topping.  For the topping also I use 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup white and double the cinnamon for this as well.

The measurements in this recipe are completely wrong. If you follow this recipe, you will end up with hard as a rock muffins, a huge mess in your oven and a bunch of wasted time and ingredients.

This recipe doesn't work! I wish people would rate the recipe as written!!! With the proper adjustments, it was 5 stars. If you make the batter as written, it is super dry! I substituted 1 & 1/2 cups of sara's homemade applesauce (from this site) for the chopped apples (this caused me to end up with 16 muffins.) Without this, this would have not have been moist at all. Also, reduce the sugar if you use sweetened applesauce and I'd reduce the flour to 1 cup and add only 3/4 cup of applesauce to make 12 regular sized muffins. I also had to adjust the temperature to 375 degrees so the muffins wouldn't burn before they could cook through. I also only cooked them for 18 minutes, then let them rest in the pan for 5 minutes to let residual cooking do the rest. The crumb mixture is also incorrect; I used 2 TBsp of butter, 1 TBsp of flour, 2 TBsp rolled oats, 1 TBsp sugar and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. This makes plenty of crumb mixture for 12 muffins.  And ABSOLUTELY only fill the muffin tins 2/3 of the way, not completely full! The recipe as written is a disaster, but I gave it 2 stars based on the ease to manipulate it into something yummy!

These were delicious! I used a little more milk. These were moist and had a wonderful apple cinnamon flavor. Didn't do the struesal topping because we ran out of time so we just left them plain, but I can just imagine how much better they would have been had I used it. This will be a keeper in my recipe box.

My 3 year old daughter requested Apple Muffins, so I tried this recipe. She loved it!!! I loved the chunks of apple. As with most reviewers, I didn't fill to the top of the cups, only 3/4. That was perfect. Also, the batter seemed dry so I squeezed the juice of one orange into it. Added some vanilla. Used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar. And I didn't bother with the topping. The next day I didn't have enough apples, so I used canned peaches. That was nice too.

When I converted itfrom 6 to 12 muffins it had the wrong information in the directions. 3 cups of flour in ingredients but 1 1/2 cups of flour in the directions. I didn't catch it in time.

Good stuff!  Like the other reviewers said, don't fill the muffin pan up to the top or you'll get a mess.  I just stuck a large baking pan under the muffin pan and didn't worry about it.  I added about 1/4th cup of whole grain cereal crushed up. I think this would be ok made in a cake pan too with a powdered sugar glaze drizzled over it. Thanks Mindy!

I thought these were fantastic! I didn't change a thing; I was just careful not to fill the muffin tins to the top, so they wouldn't overflow and cause a mess - as per earlier reviews. Oh, I doubled the cinnamon too. 

The topping was great, and I got several requests for the recipe. Thanks Mindy! :)

This recipe is so popular at my husband's monthly brunches at work that he asks me to make it every time.  He says everyone loves these muffins because they are ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.  
I'm not entirely happy about that because there is actually nothing particularily easy about this recipe.  I have no idea why they have the name easy.  Easier than what?  How could it be harder?  
Having made them several times I have learned how they can be made with less effort using a food processor.  After I mix the dry ingrediants I put the topping ingredients in the bowl of the food processor and pulse to get crumbs.  Then I use the food processor to chop the apples up.  I have an apple corer from pampered chef (not that Apple Corer Peeler Slicer which would really help).  Then I just cut the peel off of each section of apple.  Pulsing the apple slices makes nice little pieces of apple.  I also add a little lemon juice to the apples.    I also put cream instead of milk since I want the muffins to be delicious and they're for other people.  ;)

Very good recipe. I made these for my son's preschool class for Johnny Appleseed Day. I used mini-muffin tins instead of regular size and baked for about 12 minutes. I cut back on the amount of chopped apple and sprinkled only brown sugar on top since these had to make it to school intact. I also added a dash of nutmeg because I love the taste with cinnamon and apples. They were even better the day after. Thanks for the great recipe.

Moist and wonderful muffins for my roommates this morning! 

 I made the original recipe size (6) but got 12 good sized muffins.  I agree with other reviewers that they were a bit dense; adding some extra baking powder would be a good idea.  I also used 2T of skim milk instead of 1/4c of the 1/2c of butter.  I always put cloves and nutmeg in with cinnamon--amazing results.  This one's a keeper.

These were fabulous!!! Easy to make and so delicious. I was accused of trying to pass off Costco muffins as my own!! However, if doubling the recipe, it is not necessary to double the sprinkle topping.

This recipe was a very good one but a single batch made not six muffins but twelve and a double made 36. I made these for christmas and my family loved them. When you are making them the muffin batter looks super thick but it's okay it is supposed to look like that.

I've made these several times now and find the original recipe is a bit blah for my taste, but it' a great base to start with if you are not afraid of experimenting in the kitchen.

I double the recipe to make a 12"x8" pan of squares instead of muffins. For a double batch I make the following adjustments:

All whole wheat flour,
1 cup loosely measured brown sugar,
1 tbsp baking powder,
4 tsp cinnamon,
1 tsp nutmeg,
2 flax eggs,
soy milk in place of regular,
Unless my apples are rather large, I add an extra one (so 5 instead 4 in a double batch). I also shred some and chop the rest.

Keeping them on the healthier side, I omit the topping altogether.

This was a tasty dessert, but the recipe has a few things that need to change. I personally increased the milk by 1/4 cup, the recipe yields about 10 muffins, and 1 1/2 apples should be enough...even one! The butter needs to be cut down to about 1/4 or 1/3 a cup, because I had tried it another time with the 1/2 cup and I ended up with goo! Best of luck!! This is definetly a favorite, super simple too!(:

I found this while searching for a muffin recipe to use the fruit. This is exactly what I was looking for, but it took me remixing the batter to realize it should say 1-1/3 cups milk instead of just 1/3 milk. If you only use 1/3, you end up making more of a dough than a batter. The only other changes I made were substituting regular milk for almond milk and I used canola oil instead of vegetable.

We loved this! Followed the recipe using the suggestions from the top reviewer. We ended up doubling the batch and not exactly measuring the apples (who does that anyway? Two apples can equal 1 cup, 1/2 a cup, etc), just adding how many we liked. Next time we'll add even more and probably in bigger chunks! 

I did find that we had waaaay more topping that we needed.

The 2 stars are for flavour only. If a beginning cook tried this recipe as is I can't imagine it working out.  I left the topping off, as it's not nec for flavour and adds a heap of calories and a mess if you actually filled the muffin tins. My main complaint is the texture; mine turned out to be a crumbly mess,altho they weren't dry.  Made eating them without a plate impossible. But like I said the flavour was great.  Will try a different recipe before giving this one a go again.

I found that with only 1/3 cup of milk what I got was just a crumbly mixture...then when I added more milk I got a mixture that resembled paste!!!! What a waste of food!

This recipe was pretty good. I didn't use the topping to make it a bit healthier. I had to double the recipe because (as it says) it only makes 12. Be sure to let it cool thoroughly before pulling it out of the pan because it's a bit crumbly. Be sure to bake it long enough as well.

Very light and fluffy.  I used a chopper to get the apple pieces very small so it wasn't so chunky.  Everyone loved these at my breakfast potluck

I just made these for the second time in a few days. They're wonderful, tasty and moist! I may add another apple to make it even more moist and "appley". Thank you for such an easy, tasty recipe.

I followed this recipe exact with the exception of filling 12 muffin cups instead of six. The tops bubbled over and made a mess in the oven and smoked us out. Muffins were thick and just had a bad flavor.

This is more of a cake type than a bread type muffin.  I used the recipe with and without the topping. I used Fuji and Braeburn apples, and they were both good.  This is my husbands favorite muffin. I gave it 4 stars because the topping is really messy to clean up after it over flowed the pan. This recipe made 12 standard muffins. This is now my standard apple muffin recipe.

Yum! These muffins were moist and delicious. Even my mother, who usually doesn't care for muffins, enjoyed them!  I didn't make the topping because I thought it would be too sweet for breakfast, and they were good enough without it. Following some of the reviews, I added about two more tablespoons of milk, doubled the cinnamon. I used one large apple instead of two, and cut into big chunks.  I also filled the cups 3/4 way, and with the alterations, the recipe made 12 muffins.

I'm a little taken back by all the reviews on this recipe.  I read the last few entries and was somewhat concerned about making them.  I doubled the recipe, hoping to make 24; but I ended up with 33.  But only because people posted not to fill the muffin tins.  The recipe is GREAT, batter is a bit thick, but a spoonful makes a great muffin! I will make them again!  The comments for me were totally

I've baked this several times and have done what others have said (and followed my own logical sense) and used regular muffin tins and only filled them a bit over halfway. I also add a bit of chopped chocolate when I'm feeling fancy or have some leftover from another baking project.  I think you could easily reduce the amount of sugar in this - the apple and cinnamon flavours nicely and it shouldn't be too sweet. Oh, and I never make the topping. I think they're fine without.

These were very good! I shredded the apples and added 2 tbsp. of lemon juice to them before I added the apples to the batter. For the topping, I only used brown sugar, light earth balance margarine and old fashion oats. I baked at 375 instead of 400 for about 20 minutes.

Wow! Everything about these muffins is good! They look good, smell good, and taste great! I mixed the muffin batter as the recipe said, but for the topping I just estimated the amount of butter and used softened butter. It didn't mix perfectly, but they turned out fantastic! They are very moist....just make sure you load up on the topping. It really finishes them off!

Fantastic recipe! To cut down on fat, I didn't add the topping, and they still came out delicious. After reading reviews, I doubled the cinnamon, halfed the oil, and added a quarter cup of apple sauce. I also used three apples coarsely chopped because I love apples. Great addition to my recipe box!

DELICIOUS!!! I changed the recipe a bit: all brown sugar, and 3 small apples. The batter was thick, so I thinned it out a little with more milk. The batter made 12 regular sized muffins. Very tasty.

Delicious muffins although I altered the recipe quite a bit! I used only 1 apple, and ended up not needing the whole thing. I omitted the topping for a mixture of cinnamon and sugar (1/4 cup of sugar and 1 tsp. of cinnamon.) I doubled the amount of cinnamon. Instead of 1 1/2 cups of white flour, I used 1/2 whole wheat, and I used both white and brown sugar. The batter was dry, so I added some more milk, making the total about a 1/2 cup. The final product filled 9 muffin cups to the top. It was light and fluffy, and the apples added a nice crunch. Great recipe!

These muffins are fantastic, but I have to say, next time I will cut way down on the topping of leave it off all together, it ruined the taste of the muffin for me.  I have a sweet tooth, but these were a little much.  **Update, made these again with just a little cinnamon & sugar on top instead of the topping called for as someone else did per their review and they came out way better in my opinion.

These muffins are delicious.  The recipe says it only makes 6 but I easily got a dozen muffins by filling tins only half-way.  The strudel is too buttery.  The first time I made it it dripped all over.  The second time I used the strudel topping for Orange Cinnamon Muffins and they turned out much better.  Without topping would still taste pretty good too

These are great and truly easy.  My daughter has an allergy to eggs.  So, I substituted 1/2 tsp more baking powder, 1 tbsp more milk, 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar for the egg.  I also substituted 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and only used one large apple.

Good, but like others have said you should fill the cups half full or you will have a smokey mess.  Also the topping was a bit too buttery.  I would stick to a cinnomon sugar topping next time.

Wonderful muffins. Went apple picking and wanted to use up some of the apples.  These were great.  I added a little oatmeal like one person suggested.  I doubled recipe and got 24 regular size muffins.  I did not do the topping but was going to dip them in cinnamon sugar instead.  Never did get around to that part because they really didn't need it.  I will be making these often and maybe add some raisens next time just for fun. Ü

This is such a scrumptious muffin recipe, with real apples!! I made 12 muffins, that were still quite large, and instead of crumbling the topping over, I accidently used spreadable butter (lighter in fat content!), and this worked out just as good! Definantely make this one again and again!!

smell delicious especially while cooking... the topping mixed but not as good as hoped.. but I took the butter straight out of the fridge... so I had some topping left over. The apple should be cut in small bits... I chopped them but they we're still big. I made 8 muffin "bars" filling them about 1/2 way....  Good recipe.. does need some adjustments though..

This was the best muffin ever!  I only used 1 med - lg apple and it made 14 big muffins.  I added just a little extra milk and about 1/4 extra baking powder.  I will definately keep making these muffins! It was so easy, I'd never made homemade muffins before and these were a hit!

Don't fill up the cups all the way (no more than half).  Use about half a cup of milk instead of a third (batter is really thick otherwise).  If you double the recipe, don't double the apples.  Cooking time seems short...
They look and smell amazing!  We'll see how they taste in about 10 minutes.

Wonderful recipe.  It was so easy, and I could find all the ingredients in the house.  My parents loved them and said they were some of the best muffins they have ever tasted.  I am planning to make them again and again.  This recipe will definitely be put in a safe place.  Way to go, Mindy!

I also made some changes to this recipe, but it was sooo good! I doubled the cinnamon, substituted 1/3 of the white sugar for brown sugar and added milk until the batter was less sticky. They were the best muffins! I also tried them with chocolate chips instead of apples and they were "incredible"!

The muffins were delicious, but there were some problems. I followed the other reviewers suggestions and only filled the muffins 2/3 of the pan, but I overlooked the butter crumb part. Don't make as much of that and you'll be fine. Also, the muffins were a bit too dry. I suggest adding more milk.

I followed the recipe to a T . The only difference was I ended up with 12 regular muffins and only filled the muffin pan with 1/2 full cups instead of full ones. My daughter and I approve of these easy fun to make muffins. Also made the whole house smell AMAZING!!

Make only half the topping
Fill muffin cup 3/4 , not to the top.

Great flavor, easy to make, just follow the two warnings above or you will have a mess in your oven

These are yummy! I subbed applesauce for the oil, used 2.5 apples and added some carrots. Also cut sugar to 1/2 cup (plenty sweet!), and subbed oats for 1/2 the flour. Per other reviews, cut the butter in streusel by 1/2, and cut sugar a bit.  made 12 regular sized muffins and there is more batter-for another day:-)

Yum!These muffins are good. I used 1c flour and 1/2 c oatmeal with 1/2 c brown sugar. I also used half sour cream and half oil for the 1/3 c. It made a full dozen of regular sized muffins. Will definitely make again since they are easy and pretty healthy.

I followed the recipe but burnt it... Not a baker so I will try to use shorter time or lower temp next time. But I tried the center parts that's not burnt, it is delicious! So I'm going to give it another try next time

The best.  I made 7 extra large muffins, added blueberries, cooked for 30 minutes.  I did NOT peel the apples.

I also failed to read the reviews prior to diving right into this recipe.  I often do read the reviews, but not this time.  My experience making muffins told me that this was not six muffins, but I stuffed the batter into a six muffin pan.  I didn't see the direction of filling to the rim, but to get all the batter in, they certainly were full.  They were delicious but did not come out of the pan in one piece.  I may have been rushing though and trying to get them out before they had cooled.  Sure, there will be leftover topping, but just pop any leftover topping into a sandwich bag and into the freezer for a crumble or crisp.  And, I'm not sure why one would peel the apple.  They are really nice with the peel left on. All in all, a nice muffin but lesson learned--trust your gut!

I wish I had read the reviews first giving suggestions for these muffins. Next time I make these, I wouldn't fill the tins all the way to the top, like the directions stated. And I would cut down on my butter amount like one review suggested because everything melted over and started smoking. Now I have a mess in my overn!! That being said, the muffins themselves were actually really tasty!

I followed the recipe as directed the first time and got the same results that others were getting so I changed it up a little also, I used half and half instead of milk and added a little more, then used brown sugar instead of white, and added about 1/3 cup apple sauce.  I think next time I will try butter instead of oil.

This recipe turned out great! I only used 1 apple and it was plenty, it also made 16 cupcakes for me.  I also didn't do the topping.  I will make these again.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

I LOVE this recipe, and frequently make it as a "controlled portion" dessert, for at work.  It also makes a great morning breakfast treat.  When Cranberries are in season, I reduce the apples to 2/3 and use 1/3 Cranberries for variety.  I love them both ways!

I gave this 4 stars because I adjusted the recipe according to a review I read.  I cut the butter in half, filled the cups 2/3 and topped off with cinnamon mixture, and only used one apple, diced.  Oh, and I substituted half of the white sugar with brown sugar.  With those small adjustments, I think they're the best muffins I've ever made!  The husband has a huge sweet tooth and he loved them.  This is a really good recipe to start from.  I'm not a huge baker, which is why I was looking for something simple, and this was awesome.  I will definitely make these again.

I have yet to actually taste the muffins.  As far as being easy, it is pretty simple, i would just say to do as some of the reviews say to do and half the butter, and don't fill the muffin tins, even at 3/4 of the way full they still leaked over the top, on my muffin pan and my oven, also after baking i found that some of them sunk, about 1/2 i don't know if that was just something i did or just the extra butter. Good Luck.

Wow, I wanted 18 muffins for a large family crowd, so I tripled the recipe. OOPS! Big Mistake...I must never forget to read the comments again. Muffins #19 through 36 PLUS a large loaf are in the oven now. IDK- 3 hours later... However, they are beautiful and delicious!  Just follow the comments.  Fill each cup halfway.  The recipe makes twice as much as it says. Add oats too!

Great recipe. But it does need a few modifications. First, never with muffins or cupcakes fill the cups all the way full. Fill 2/3 of the cup because the batter will rise. Second, with this recipe add some more milk, the batter is a little dry as is. Or, add some additional apple juice instead of milk. It gives the muffins more favor.

Excellent! Ended up doubling the recipe & got 24 muffins. I did not fill to the top as directions say. Let your chopped apples sit in the batter mixture as it will give a little more consistency rather than thick & sticky. If doubling I used 4 & there was plenty of apples in all the muffins, was not overkill.  I thought the ingredients were just enough however if you would like more cinnamon add a 1/2 to 1 tsp more. I baked mine for 25-28 minutes in a liner, had no mess, not burnt & they were cooked all the way through. If doubling the butter mixture there will be plenty left over, next time I would use 1 1/2 of what the recipe calls for.  Very delicious, will be making again as my kids loved them!

I am a newbie when it comes to baking and muffin making. In fact, this is the second muffin recipe that I tried (and I followed 90% of the recipe) and it was a success!

I was a bit worry at first after reading the various reviews that document spilling disaster in the oven due to filling the muffin cups fully. But... I had no spilling problem at all despite the fact that I DID fill the batter into the tins exactly to the top of the muffin cup (I used regular muffin tins & I made 12 muffins with the recipe). I also used paper cup liners. In fact, upon being baked, it makes the muffin nice & cute with their 'swollen' tops. I agreed that the topping mixture was too much, so I did a lot of cutback; in fact, I omitted the butter altogether (maybe this is the culprit of the spilling disasters that many people had). The only drawback that I found in this muffin recipe is : still TOO SWEET, despite the fact that I reduced the white sugar. So here are the only modification that I did:

Muffin batter:
White sugar reduced:  3/4 cup to 1/2 cup ---> still too sweet
Milk increased: 1/3 cup to 1/2 cup --> to make the batter less dry
Granny Smith apples: 2 apples to 1 1/4 apples
Also added  2 tsp of vanilla and 1/8 tsp of turmeric to give color.
Everything else remained the same.

Toppings:
White flour reduced: 1/3 cup to 1 tbsp
White sugar: omitted and replaced with 1 tbsp + 1 tsp  chopped block brown sugar
Butter: omitted
Added chopped walnut: 1 tbsp
Ground cinnamon: remained the same.

Delicious. I used a regular sized muffin pan for 6, however, filled them to the top and still had left over batter. Not a problem. I had challenges removing them from the form though even after greasing them well. I will make this again though. Next time I will keep the apple pieces a little larger so as to distinguish them in the muffin.

I doubled the recipe and made 15 large muffins. However, I had to add another cup (at least) of milk as the batter was not wet enough. The amount of ingredients for topping was way too much. The resulting muffin was somewhat bland - perhaps using brown sugar and maybe applesauce in the recipe would help.

This was simple and delicious!  I would have given it a full 5, but I will use a little more cinnamon next time.  I topped them with cinnamon cream cheese and sprinkles for the 4th of July.

These were delicious! I made some changes per other reviews: used 2 eggs, added some hot water to thin it out, and used only 1/4 cup butter for the topping. I'm always looking for more ways to get oatmeal into our diet so I subbed 1/2 cup of quick cooking oats for the 1/2 c flour. Oh yeah and I also subbed brown sugar instead of white (it goes better with the oats!). My DH told me to make sure I kept this recipe :)

Tasted great but do not fill cups more than 2/3 full because of overflow. I got luck and noticed early on and put a cookie sheet on the rack below to catch the mess.

Needs adjusting. I used 1 1/2 chopped apples and ended up with enough batter for 8 muffins. So I halfed the recipe and added it together with my extra so I had enough better for a dozen total.
 Also the topping recipe is way too big. It is enough for 18 muffins.
 I filled my muffins to the top since I used whole wheat flour and that can weigh the muffin down.

I followed all the dirrections and measurements exactly. When I first looked at the batter of these muffins I was annoyed because there was more apple that batter, but it was too late to change it so I baked it anyway. I'm so glad I did!!! These muffins are amazing, exactly as the recipe is written. I really want to make this in a cake pan as a coffee cake.

I made these muffins exactly as written & they are fabulous!!  I'm not sure why others have a problem with them.  I doubled the recipe because I wanted a dozen; it made 18.  Not doing to ding the recipe for that!  I did have a bit of topping leftover as well, no big deal.  The muffin topping did spread a bit but when you use a nice non-stick muffin pan, no worries.

I love this recipe. I did change sugar to 1/2 brown and white. When I did the top I melted butter instead of cubing it and it turned out fantastic! I also shredded the apples to allow a bit more moisture through batter. I found the batter to be too thick before.

Yummy! I used a 1/3 cup of apple sauce just to add a bit more to the batter (makes them more moist) I never fill the liners to any muffin or cup cake if they say to as 99% of the time they will over flow! For topping  I did my own use 2 apple and spice oat meal packets not even 1/4 cup of brown sugar and about 5 tsp of soft butter (NOT MELTED) use spoon to mis and make crumble. Take a little brown sugar and sprinkle on top of muffin (just a little) then add crumble bake half the time on middle rack then move to top rack for the rest of the! Spilt open and use either a little jam or even great with cream cheese! Love them!!

These muffins are great. It does make 6 JUMBO muffins. I was lazy when I made this, and used 1/2 a cup of chunky apple sauce instead of cutting up the apples. The cake part came out great! I also cut the amount of butter for the crumb topping, the second time I made. I used 1/3 cup of the Land o Lakes cinnamon butter instead of 1/2 cup of regular butter, and the topping was perfect. 
This is a great, easy recipe to make with your kids too. I will be doubling the recipe for a brunch that we are hosting for work.

As far as I am concerned this doesn't even deserve 1 star!  The quantity is all wrong..I figured that out and filled 12 standard size muffin cups, using paper liners. So far, so good.  While the muffins were baking in the oven, I noticed a burning smell coming from my kitchen.  When I pulled them out of the oven, the 'goo' had spread all over the baking pan.  I let them cool for a bit, then tried to remove the muffins from the tin.  They came out in pieces...no way to serve these as a 'muffin'. I know my husband will LOL when he comes home from work and sees my mess.  I am usually a pretty good cook/baker . . . this recipe was a terrible waste of my time and ingredients. It makes me wonder if allrecipes.com has and uses a test kitchen to verify the quality of recipes.  I guess allrecipes leaves it up to folks like me who are willing to experiment.  I won't trust and make that mistake again!

A nice, simple recipe to make.  I added a couple more apples, 1/2 t nutmeg and 1/2 t allspice.  And then cut the butter in half for the topping.  I have made it several times this fall with our abundant supple of apples.  Thank you!

The only changes I made to this recipe was for the interest of my waistline: rather than 1/2c butter, I just used 1/3c. Mixing it with the sugar mix will not allow you to 'sprinkle' it on top, so just spread it. Makes a nice brown sugar crust that's absolutely delicious. 

This recipe makes 12 regular sized muffins, as many have already noted. I used 3 small apples (it looked like a heaping 2 1/2 cups) and I really liked the apple-batter ratio. It does seem like a lot of apple, but once you get baking and the dough fluffs up, the amount of apples really aren't too much. On another note, I also only filled the cups 2/3 and they filled out just fine. 25 minutes in the oven were perfect.

My entire family basically sat in front of the oven while these were baking; they made the house smell amazing. We 3 people polished off the lot in less than 24 hours. I call this recipe a success! I will definitely make these again.

READ THIS FIRST: This recipe is all wrong-I woke up and my daughter had started making them so I had no choice but to finish them. I would never make them again. The batter makes way more than 6 muffins-and 1/2 cup butter for the topping is way too much. The muffins and the topping ran over the pan, made a huge mess in the oven and started the fire alarm!

Great starter recipe! I used whole wheat flour, replaced all the oil with applesauce, and added a dash of nutmeg to the batter. 1/2 cup of butter for the topping is WAY too much: I ended up throwing away about half of what I made because it wouldn't fit in the pan. I used three medium sized apples and it made 12 regular muffins. There was a mess all over my muffin pans to clean, but It wasn't horrible. The most important part is the muffins were excelent; slight sugary crunch on top and moist in the middle. Everyone raved about them!

I changed the recipe a little. used 1/2 c. dark brown sugar, 1/2 c. steel-cut oats and 1 cup unbleached flour to equal 1 1/2 cup flour. also, used Oriental cinnamon and it really makes a wonderful difference in the flavor. for the topping, no butter, 1/2 c. dark brown sugar and oriental cinnamon.  My muffins turned out good and the flavor was great.

I added oats to my muffins.  I think this would be much better (4 stars) without the topping.  Maybe mine turned out wrong, but it just was a hard top that didn't taste like much. :S

This was suprisingly great.  Homemade muffins tend to turn out dry or bland when I make them, but this recipe was not only really simple, but they were loved by everyone at brunch.  Light, moist, and tasty.  I did not have the butter for the struesel top so I just sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top while they were cooking.  Turned out great.

I disagree with the other reviewers who stated that 1/2 cup butter is too much. I followed their advice and used 1/4 cup, and it wasn't nearly enough. I ended up sprinkling more cubed butter on top the muffins five minutes before they were supposed to be done. Perhaps these reviewers were using stick margarine, but I used stick butter and 1/4 cup was NOT enough.

I did use just one average-sized red delicious apple, and a regular 12-cup muffin pan. The muffins tasted fine. I might make them again.

I love this recipe! Just some tips though, the topping tends to smoke so I don't add it until they are almost done cooking and DO NOT FILL THE MUFFIN CUPS! They puff up a lot and with the topping they bubble over the sides if they are too full.  I also only used 1 apple which I thought was perfect but its to taste. Great recipe!

Great recipe!  I found the batter to be really thick, and thought I had done something wrong, but they turned out wonderful,- dense and filling, and had just the right amount of sweetness.  The only thing I changed was to not use the crumble topping.  This will be my new go to recipe for muffins, - thanks!

I'm giving this 4 stars just because I changed the recipe so much, but the flavor is a definite 5 star! First thing is that I made it Gluten Free- instead of all purpose flour I used an equal amount of Bob's Red Mill GF baking flour, and 3/4 tsp Xanthan Gum. I also used 2tsp of Cinn instead of 1, and only 1 apple which was plenty. I used 1/8c oil, and 1/4 applesauce, and (as if that wasn't enough to change) I sprinkled a little cinn/sugar on top rather than the topping to make it healthier. I filled each muffin cup with ~1/4c of batter and they rose to the top of the pan (made 12 muffins). The flavor of these was wonderful and they were relatively light/fluffy!! With not using the topping and cutting down on the oil they are healthier too :) Will definitely make again!

Very tasty!  I increased the serving sizes to 8 and this recipe made 12 regular-sized muffins.  I decreased the sugar to 3/4C and these were still too sweet for my tastes.  Used 1/2 whole wheat flour with good results.  Used granny smith apples which kept their shape.  I left the topping off and these were still great without.

Martha White used to make packets of apple cinnamon muffins, but now we can't find them anywhere, so I tried this recipe. It was easy and the topping, while good, isn't necessary. Just sprinkle a little cinnamon sugar on top before they go in the oven!

These were easy and they smell great I think there is too much butter. They made a mess in my oven and the bottoms were greasy. (I used papre liners and the bottoms were soaked!)

Not bad!   The instructions are a little vague, i.e. what type of apples?  I used gala apples, and diced them into really small pieces.  I followed the recipe as stated, but found the batter too thick, so I eye-balled some more milk and oil until it looked like a normal muffin batter thickness.  They do taste great though!  I'd definitely try this recipe again, perhaps adding some quick oats to the topping so it doesn't just melt into the muffin.

Made a dozen following this recipe but it was waaaay too dry so I'm only giving it 3 stars.   The second time I added another 1/3 cup milk, 2 tablespoons of butter and a teaspoon of vanilla extract and it was delicious.

These muffins are GREAT! The recipe is certainly easy, and goes together very quicky. I used fuji apples because thats what was on top of the bushel.  I omitted the topping because I just wanted a simple muffin recipe. At the advise of other reviewers, I used 12 muffin cups (sprayed with cooking spray). My house smells amazing and the muffins are delicious. Thanks for an easy recipe!

This recipe is awful. Worst one I've ever used on any online recipe source. Nothing about it is correct. the muffin yielding "6"- wrong. Not enough liquid, not enough sugar, Too many apples- I used one and it still ended up being mostly apples inside the muffins. THey fell apart.

these are good.  One thing I noticed that you need to cut the apples into really small pieces. This also makes a good coffee cake.

My family loved these! I doubled the recipe and got 3 dozen out of them! WOW!  I made my apple chunks big and when you hit one in a bite it was melt in your mouth delicious. I had absolutely no problems with over flowing but of course I didn't completely fill the cups either, filled them about 2/3-3/4 way full.  With the topping the cups were full however. I also used silicone muffin "tins" and only had to bake them for only about 17 minutes at 400.  I took the advice of others and severely cut the butter in the topping (I think perhaps this is what makes the big mess), for a double batch I only used 6 tablespoons butter (which amounts to about 1/4 plus 1/8 of a cup).  I also used half brown and half white sugar for both the topping and for the muffins.  I took someones suggestion and used half unsweetened applesauce and half oil to cut down on the fat factor a little. They did turn out a little flat but that is ok, we like heavier muffins here and these were delicious!  Excellent way to use excess apples!  Yum!!!

I'm picking up cooking as a hobby, so I decided to try and improvise things for the first time. I used whole wheat flower instead of the all-purpose. I also used one gala and one granny smith apple because I wanted to see if the tart/sweet combination would work, which it did. I saw the reviews that there wasn't enough cinnamon so I decided to use a tablespoon, because I love cinnamon. Overall, the taste was pretty good. I feel like there was a little too much apple in the recipe and it overwhelmed the mixture. Because of that the muffins had a problem staying together when they came out of the oven, but I expect that to fix itself when they cool down. I made a topping with sugar, wheat germ, cinnamon, and a little bit of vegetable oil. Overall, I feel like this was a great recipe. I'll probably try and do a better job dicing the apples next time. It's given me more confidence to improvise on future recipes though.

I loved this recipe I used 12 regular baking cups and only filled 2/3 full. I also cut the amount of butter in the crumble in half and only used 1 apple. Even my 2 year old loved them!

These came out very good. I omitted the topping ( I know this was probably the best part!). I felted like with the topping it was too unhealthy and I was having these for breakfast. I also replaced the oil with applesauce. I only needed one medium size granny smith apple, and it was plenty for these muffins. I filled them to the top, so they came out big. I ended up with 14 muffins. Be careful, these are addictive!

These were delish!  They made 12 muffins for me, filled pretty full.  The 2 apples were a lot, I didn't add them all in or it wouldn't have worked so my advice would be to add the apples slowly and see how they fill the batter.  This probably depends on the size of the apples.  I also used  1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup melted butter because I ran out of oil.  I didn't do the topping being short on time I just sprinkled them with cinnamon sugar.  Will definitely make again, with a note on my recipe to use about 1 1/2 c chopped apples.

I've been making this recipe nearly every weekend! The only changes I make is to use a 9"x13" baking dish instead of making muffins, one good sized apple is plenty, and add a tad more milk to the batter so it's not quite so thick.  We fight for the last piece every time!

these are perfect! i am a novice baker with a family full of special dietary needs, so i used a sugar substitute instead of sugar. i also use only 1 apple instead of two, but besides those changes, they are absolutely delicious! i like how the muffin itself turns out subtly sweet, yet the apples and cinnamon really kick it up a notch. for the "crumble" on top, i replaced butter with margarine and made more of a spread...which made wwwwaaaaayyyy more than i could ever use on the five jumbo muffins i made. very good overall!

Delicious muffins!  I made changes based on previous reviews.  Granny Smith apples were a slightly tart contrast to the super sweet sugary sweetness of the muffins and worked out superbly.  I peeled and sliced mine, then send them through the food processor for a thick apple sauce consistency.  I used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar for the muffins, instead of 3/4 cup of white sugar.  I also added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla flavor to the topping.  On the advice of others, I only filled the muffins 2/3 full and had no issues.  I also placed my muffin cups in a 9X9X2" baking pan, rather than a muffin pan.  (Mainly because I can't seem to find it ANYWHERE!)  But this did help catch any drippings from the muffin tops.  The muffins just came out shaped like squares instead of pretty little rounds.  But still taste the same :-)  From this recipe, I made 18 medium-sized muffins.

The measurements weren't quite right and the top sprinkle turned out more like a dough than a sprinkle.  And I ended up with way more than 6 muffins. But, otherwise they were pretty good.

Similarly to other reviewers, I found that filling 2/3 of the muffin cups with batter rather than to the top is sufficient. Also, my batch made 10 muffins rather than 6. When I made them, I completely forgot about making the crumb topping, but the muffins still came out delicious and my family loved them!

i had made an apple pie and had about an apple or two remaining that was already mixed in with cinnamon and sugar so i looked for something to do with the left over apple pie filling and found this recipe.  the muffins were really good, just need to use common sense when filling them. i did not add the topping as we really do not care for any toppings, but the muffins still came out great and were delicious!

I made this recipe for my two toddlers for breakfast, so we skipped the crumb topping. Also, we cannot do dairy here, so I subbed apple juice for the milk. I also added 1/2 cup ground flax seed meal. I filled the cups 2/3's full, and the recipe made 12 muffins. They were very small, but delicious and fluffy.

I agree, the topping is not needed for these moist, sweet muffins.  Very nice flavor.  I believe the regular recipe would make 12 regular sized muffins.  I doubled it to make more for a class snack.

I decreased the sugar to less than 1/4 cup, increased the milk to 1/2 cup, and used 1/2 cup applesauce in place of the oil. I also used all whole wheat flour, and 1 1/2 chopped apples. I think next time I'd either chop the apples MUCH smaller (like pea-sized) or cut it back to 1 apple; two apples would be too much in any form, in my opinion. It made 11 "regular" sized muffins and they baked in 15 minutes. They turned out really dense, maybe because I used whole wheat flour. The flavor is great. I'll make them again.

These were a bit too sweet, I would only use 1/2 cup sugar next time.  I used 2 parts white flour and 1 part wheat flour.  I don't know if that had anything to do with why my batter was so dry, but I had to double the amount of milk I used.  I had two big apples, but only used one, trusting the top reviewer's suggestion.  Big mistake.  Though my apple was big and looked like a lot in the batter, it shrinked and I had almost no apples in my muffins, so next time I'll put two in, as the recipe states.  I used a pinch of cinnamon instead of the stated amount, and added a pinch of cloves as well as nutmeg.  The reason I give this recipe 5 stars is that it is very forgiving and there is room for pretty much any modification you want to make.  It's a great base.  I'll definitely be using it again.

Yummy!  I made the changes suggested by others, though - more milk, split the sugar so it was half white, half brown sugar, substituted applesauce for oil, and doubled the cinnamon.  They were a little dry, but I think I needed to put in more apple.  Overall very good, though!

my muffins turned out amazing!  i did make some alterations based on the reviews, such as cutting the ingredients for the topping in half, and making twelve standard muffins rather than 6 jumbo ones.  i also veganized it, replacing milk with vanilla soy milk, butter with earth balance margarine, and the egg with half a banana.  the banana helps the muffins rise, and gives them a cake-like texture.  i have made them twice this way, and both times, my roommates have raved over them.  they are crunchy on the outside, but soft and moist inside, which i love!  thanks for a great recipe!  i can fool all my friends into thinking i am an amazing baker this way =)

An excellent base recipe to start with.  I read several reviews and ended up making two versions.  Version 1 had 1/2 c brown sugar, 1/4 c white sugar, 2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp nutmeg, 1 average-sized granny smith apple and a couple extra splashes of milk (didn't measure exactly).  I skipped the crumble topping and used cinnamon/sugar instead.    Second version added 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp cinnamon (for 2 total).  Still needed small splash of milk.  Between the two batches, I thought the second was better.  White sugar makes them more fluffy and the vanilla adds much needed flavor.  I'm keeping these changes and saving this to my recipe box!  I was able to make one pan of mini-loaves (9) and filling 2/3 made them turn out the perfect size.

I agree with everyone else that this makes 12 muffins.  I also had to add more milk than the recipe called for, and instead of the crumble topping, I used 4 crushed up crunchy cinnamon granola bars.  They turned out great with these few minor adjustments.

This was pretty good.  Every one was right about the portion sizes, it is all out of wack.  I did not like doing the cubed butter and struggled with this, which made the topping more challenging to put on.  The muffins look pretty good, and taste pretty good too, but definitely not the best.

I have no idea how this recipe got so many positive reviews.  Besides the errors in measurement (the recipe makes 12 muffins, not 6, there's far too much butter in the crumble topping, and you should NEVER EVER fill muffin cups all the way up), there's the fact that they came out heavy and largely tasteless.  I even added extra spices -- some nutmeg and allspice, in addition to the cinnamon .And even though I halved the amount of butter in the topping, I still wound up with a buttery mess on the bottom of the muffin cups.  Fortunately it confined itself to the pan

I didn't know how this recipe would turn out but it came out so good that even my mother that is undergoing chemotherapy ate two. I did do some modifications; I doubled the amount of milk and shredded one apple to distribute moisture. For the crumb topping I mixed 1tbs of melted butter with 2tbs of oats and sugar  and 1tbs of flour and some cinnamon. It was great! The reviews really helped!

This recipe is excellent. I did tweak this recipe after reading other reviews previous to making it and that did help. I did just fill the muffin pan 2/3 full and I did use just 1/4 of butter for the topping however I did add some of my own stuff to the recipe. I added a little more milk for consistency to the batter and instead of adding batter to the topping I added a little of milk...enough just to make a good crumble for the top. The muffins came out wonderful. Great recipe. I'm so glad that I found it.

I read through the reviews before making these muffins. I'm glad that I did.

For my batch, I used only brown sugar and granny smith apples. I have to agree with one reviewer that the taste is rather flat. I wonder if the flavor could be better if I added more cinnamon to the batter.

The topping came out excellent though. The muffins came out a dark golden brown and had great texture on the top.

Good recipe, but required major modifications. This recipe makes 12 muffins easily. If you don't want burned stuff on the bottom of the oven, don't fill the muffin cups all the way. I didn't make the topping because I had so much batter already for the muffins. I think next time I'd make a little less or even make two batches of 12 so I could use the crumb topping. Also, unless your apples are small, 1 apple is plenty.

These were grease bombs.  I halved the measurements on the topping and they still left about a tablespoon of butter in each cup after removing the muffin.  The muffin papers were soaked!  Also, they didn't come out of their papers very easliy.  Probably because all the butter cooked out of them.  Not worth the 600 calories, sorry.

This recipe does indeed yield 12 medium-sized muffins if you don't overfill the tins.

I used half whole wheat flour and also mixed in some flax meal for an extra nutritional punch.

To save myself the grief (and potential mess) of the butter-based crumble topping, I just sprinkled their tops with a 1:1 cinnamon sugar mixture and this added interest and texture without the hassle.

I doubled this and it made 12 muffins plus 12 mini muffins, all filled to the top.  We all loved them!  Great for when we have lots of apples around in the fall.

Delicious recipe!  I found it works better baked in a square pan like a coffee cake because it can be a bit crumbly (which I like).

I made these by the recipe and they were very good.   I did have alot more topping than I needed and next time I'd add either walnuts or oatmealto the topping. Also, I think next time I'll add a pinch of cloves to these muffins.  Thanks for this great recipe!!

This recipe is fabulous!  The muffins are moist, light but not too fluffy, perfect sweetness and great flavour.  I think these muffins are making my regular muffin rotation for sure.  That said, I did make a few small changes.  First, I was totally out of eggs, so I just subbed an extra 2 tbs. of milk and 1 tsp. of baking powder.  I only had cinnamon sugar on hand so I mixed 2 full tbs. of it and 1 tbs. vanilla in with the apples.  Instead of 3/4 cup of white sugar I used just under 1/2 brown and 1/4 white and skipped the topping.  My batter was fairly thick and filled up 12 large muffin cups.  They baked up beautifully in 25 mins. and my kitchen smells great!

This recipe was really easy to follow and the muffins were absolutely delish. I used 1/3 cup applesauce instead of oil, and for the topping I used 1/2 cup sugar instead of 3/4 cup. Thanks for a great recipe. I will be making again!

I followed this recipe with only two minor changes...I didn't have enough oil (only 1/4 cup), so I melted some butter and added it the measuring cup until it reached 1/3 cup. And, I used 1/2 cup regular sugar with 1/4 cup brown sugar. I did not make the streusel topping; the muffins were great with out!

These are the BEST muffins I've ever made. They are so moist. They taste like a mixture between apple pie and apple cake.

*I happened to have a fruit basket from Christmas that wasn't getting eaten fast enough. So, I used the golden delicious apples from it.

This muffin recipe is a winner in my book. They taste out of this world!! I actually grated the apples instead of chopping them up. And I added rolled oats to the streusel topping instead of flour.  To those who said there was too much butter in the topping, I dont think you are mixing it up quite enough. You have to cut the butter in really good.  I plan on making these again soon, but using whole wheat flour and 1/2 applesauce instead of oil like other reviewers stated.  Great recipe!

These were really easy to whip up this morning! I replaced all the oil with applesauce, filled the muffins cups only half way and didn't use the topping (tho next time I will atleast sprinkle with cinnamon sugar before baking). I only used one small granny smith apple-if I had used two, it would have been more apples than batter. I was scared at first because the batter was really thick, but these turned out nice and fluffy and rose really well! Will make many times over, Im sure :)

I think I altered this recipe so much it's not quite the same anymore.  I did so based on the calorie content.  I used brown sugar (1/2 cup), whole wheat pastry flour mixed with the white, and applesauce instead of the oil.  I did not add the topping as I intend to use this less sweet version for breakfasts in the morning with cream cheese spread in the middle.  The lower-cal version is still good, but I bet the original version is wonderful!

This muffin is very easy to make and it's very delicious!!  I listen to other user's advise, and reduced the amount of butter used.  I also reduced the amount of vegetable oil and sugar (I always reduce the amount of sugar used from any receipe) my friends love it!!

This recipe was great. I substituted applesauce for the oil to cut some of the fat and it was wonderful.

Great easy quick recipe. I substituted a 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour for the white flour. I also just sprinkled the top with cinnamon sugar as other reviewers suggested. Yum!

Very good. I was concerned about the thickness of the batter but they came out fine. I did fill to top, but omitted the topping. Haven't made them with the topping, but I don't think they need it. Great without and less calories too.

This was a very easy recipe to prepare.  I made it after dinner, and my family was eating this as dessert an hour later.  We have dairy allergies in my family, so I substituted milk with soy milk.  I had half a banana laying around, so I added half a banana to the recipe.  It turned out great!

this is the best basic muffin recipe ever! it's so easy, and it works every time, and it tastes sooooooo good and everybody raves about them and makes me feel so special! :D :D

it's really versatile, i've tried it with apples+walnuts, pears+almonds, carrots+raisins, blueberries and today i used bananas+choc chippies. sometimes i add (1 cup) oats and reduce the sugar for the kids.

as they say in singapore, diedie, must try! :)

Yummy! I made these this morning for my son's preschool class.  As others suggested I added some additional cinnamon, in addition I added a few dashes of nutmeg.  I also, used half brown sugar/half regular sugar.  I did not find the batter to be to thick, I mixed up the batter then let it sit while I made the topping, and it came out about the same consistancy as regular batter.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe, I'll be making again for Thanksgiving morning.

Very good, I also made 12 instead of 6, used 1/2 cup of sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar and added one more teaspoon of cinnamon as suggested by other reviews. Mixture was very thick, but once I added the apples it was perfect. Baked for 25min.

What are we suppose to do with all that butter? - Seriously people that is alot of butter!  But it taste sweet and good.  Also I found it turn out best if you put the  some of the butter topping in the middle.

These muffins were great.  I used buttermilk instead for milk.  Also, I used brown sugar in the topping - I made mini muffins - baked at 375 for 15 minutes.  Yum.

These muffins were very aromatic and moist and delicious. I added 1/2 more teaspoon cinnamon, reduced the oil to 1/4 cup, and increased the milk to 1/2 cup. I would recommend finely cubing one of the apples, and shreading the other. I used a different crumb topping. Also, this makes 12 muffins, not 6. This recipe is a keeper.

These were fantastic. They are delicately spiced and very moist and tender. They also filled my house with the most beautiful aroma. 

I was a little worried that there was too much apple. I used 2 medium to large sized apples - one grated and the other chopped. Because of the apple - I made 11 yummy muffins instead of 6. But the end result was very good - most of the apple disappeared and there were plenty of nice soft chunks of apple left. 

I used the crumble topping from 'Banana crumb muffins' - there's far less of it and I've used that successfully before. 

Definitely try these!

These are easy and good.  2 apples seemed like way too much (maybe my apples were large?), but when they cooked into the muffin I liked that there was a lot of texture to them.  Another indicator that there was too much apple was the fact that the batter made 11 muffins instead of 6!!  I added more cinnamon too - 1 tsp. just didn't seem like enough for the batter.  My kids love the buttery topping.

I personally thought that the muffins were bland, I even put in extra cinnamon b/c I love cinnamon so much. May I'm just spolied by the Boxed muffins but I just wasn't impressed w/ this receipe at all. Also the crumb topping.. Unless I just don't get it all the butter clumped together so it wasn't like a crumb topping at all. I had to break apart the butter in little balls to put it on the muffin mix. But I do have to say my Son LOVED the muffins and even warmed some up in the microwave this morning for breakfast so they won't goto waste but I probably won't make this receipe again.

I tried this with the suggestion of filling 12 muffin tins only 2/3 full and it worked out wonderfully. I also only made 1/3 of the topping mixture. Very tasty muffins!

Really easy nice moist and soft texture will make again. One suggestion add more apples or use a more sour or sweat apple with a table spoon of lemon juice to make the apple flavor pop more.

Perfect muffins!!! This recipe does make 12 regular size muffins. The only thing I'd reccomend is to cut the topping in half or even a quarter. I doubled the muffin recipe because I saw it only made 6, but I only made a single batch of topping and I have over half left. Excellent recipe though. Super soft, fluffy, and moist muffins!

Hey, this recipe was a-okay! Four stars because I did not follow the recipe as-is. I made sure to read through everyone's suggestions prior to making the recipe and I'm glad I did. I planned on 12 muffins, filled the cups 2/3 to 3/4 instead of all the way, and I actually just scrapped the strudel topping altogether. Just more sugar I don't need, you know? But I did sprinkle a teeny tiny amount of brown sugar on top of each instead (about a tablespoon total split over all 12 muffins). The dough was pretty dry and crumbly so I added a half cup of spiced apple whiskey which made the dough super smooth and creamy. You could probably do the same with spiced rum, or even just hot water or milk. I should have listened to folks who said to only use one apple, but I had small ones so I thought I would stick with two. Definitely could have done one, even at its small size. Ah well, they were dope. There's no butter in this recipe so they're gonna come out dry, but you can always spread a little butter on 'em when they're warm.

Pretty good muffins, I had enough for about 18 regular muffins. I think 25 minutes is too long, check them at 20, a few of mine were dry and kinda burnt on the bottom.

I made 12 regular sized muffins and baked for 20 minutes. The batter seemed dry, but the moisture from the two apples added to it while they baked and it was perfect. One star deducted because the topping really only needs 1/4 cup or less of butter, no way you could use a half and not end up with a slimy mess. I only used half of the topping and am saving the rest for another batch of muffins!

Excellent recipe. I live by a small apple orchard and have lots of Jonathan apples right now and just made this recipe last week. It was a hit and I’ll be making it again. I stuck with the recipe but could easily see adding maybe some raisins or walnuts to it. The recipe is great as is and doesn’t really need any adjustments.

I made this recipe and it turned out simply delicious. The muffins were moist , just the right amount of sweetness and cinnamon. It’s absolutely imperative that you use vegetable oil, and follow the recipe exactly. Make sure you add the topping before you bake them. I was very happy with the way they turned out. None were left, which made me even happier.

I used 4 small apples but I grated them instead of slicing them. Then I added confectioners sugar on top.

This recipe makes for a very plain tasting batch of cinnamon muffins (I had even added extra cinnamon, a dash of all spice and substituted half the white sugar with brown). Additionally, I would not recommend putting the topping on prior to cooking the muffins. It melts the top and causes them not to rise. I’m definitely going to use this as my base recipe and change things up for a more flavorful, enjoyable treat.

Not 100% sure if it was my “help” (5&1 yr olds) or the recipe itself. It was ok, nothing spectacular. I made mini muffins because my kids eat like Cookie Monster.

I found the topping kind of different. Could not sprinkle as it was a paste. I find the muffin a bit dry. I baked them for 20 minutes and they were done.

Really good muffins.
I used pink lady apples ~3, and some ground cloves since that was what I had on hand. I'll add a little milk next time since pink lady apples are kinda dry. I did read the reviews before I made them so I baked them at 350 for 20 minutes. 15 minutes would probably have been fine too. I'll be making these again.

Definitely a quick, easy muffin. I added vanilla, because vanilla is good with everything! I also used some applesauce in place of the oil.  I made a few different batches (all mini) plain, with butterscotch chips, with vanilla chips and with praline pecans. I think the winner is pecans, and the runner up is butterscotch.

These muffins were tasty, but the recipe was a bit off. Dont fill the cups up all the way, it makes 12 muffins, not six,  and you dont nedd very much topping
 Other than that, I would make this again.

Yummy!
I subbed unsweetened applesauce for the oil and cut the butter down to 1/4 cup. This makes 12-14 smallish muffins. I filled to the top and had some minor spillage, so keep the batter at 2/3 full.

Substituted brown coconut sugar for white sugar, and used gluten free flour & coconut milk, (making the muffins gf + vegan) and this is still a mean recipe! 25 minutes was perfect, they came out nice & moist. I omitted the butter glaze, and I cut the apple slices into chunks--so I used only one apple, and there are plenty of apple chunks per muffin still. I will be making another batch very soon, because this recipe IS very easy--as stated. Thank you!

Very tasty muffins.  I did substitute applesauce for the oil, and buttermilk for regular milk. I  used only one Granny Apple and chopped it very small.  I made the mistake of over-mixing the dry and wet ingredients so the top was a little tough.  I will be more diligent next time.  Definitely will make again because they were so delicious, especially with a hot cup of coffee.

Great recipe!  Thanks!  Used a golden delicious and a Macintosh apple.  There was so much apple and so little batter, I expected a thin, barely held together cake.  It rose up perfectly.  Good ratio of cake to fruit.  The only changes I made were to put the apple pieces into the dry ingredients.  This helps avoid the fruit falling to the bottom.  I also baked it in a greased deep dish porcelain pan.  Reduce the temp to 350 and increase the time.  I bake in a large toaster oven; so can't give you a time estimate.  Thinking of non-apple options such as shredded carrots or maybe summer squash.  Tasted great!

I should have read the other reviews first!  I'm guessing this recipe was for 6 jumbo muffins. We made 9 regular sized muffins, but they really overflowed the muffin tin. It was a mess, but the muffins were really delicious! I think less butter in the crumble topping would work better- I will go with 1/3  cup next time, as I will be making these again!

I tried this with almond flour and my muffins overflowed to say the least.  I also think I used very large apples which added more moisture and did not use the gum product that should be used with non gluten flour.  I used non gluten all purpose flour Bob's Red Mill to make a cake and had no problem without the gum product.  I am still learning and am open to insight others may have.  Jeanie
PS I did not want to rate but prompt insisted before submitting.  I scooped the contents of the muffins out and tasted and it was delicious so not a fair rating star wise.

The recipe works really nicely! However, it does not yield 6 muffins - I ended up making 10 in total. 

I do recommend filling up to the top (it will not topple over). For a healthier alternative and to not use so much butter, I quartered the recipe for the cinnamon, sugar, flour, and butter topping. It added a nice crisp on the top without being too heavy. 

I cooked the muffins at 400 for 22 minutes and they were perfect!

As others have said, I did have to make a few minor adjustments. As written you'll wind up with a thick dough not suitable for muffins. I used 2/3 cup of milk which yielded a thick, creamy batter. I also added some extra cinnamon and about 1/2 tsp of vanilla for more flavor. Finally, 1 medium size apple is plenty. Unless your apples are very small, 2 will be way too many.

For the topping, you only need 1/4 cup of butter. I honestly didn't measure the other ingredients here but pretty sure the flour was nowhere near what the recipe calls for and I used brown sugar instead of white.

With these tweaks, I was very happy with the results.

The recipe will make 12 regular-sized muffins or 6 jumbo muffins.

it's very well made with the crunchy topping and edges.
I added a splash of vanilla, and nutmeg to spice it up more.

Baking time and temp completely off.  Very brown on the outside and completely raw (liquid) inside.  Use only if you are an experienced baker that can do substitutes and alterations to get it working

Please read the reviews and modify this recipe accordingly! This recipe makes muffins heavier than a lot of cookies I've had. They left a residue of oil/butter in the bottom of my muffin tins (that had liners). There is just too much butter and oil in this recipe. They taste good but I'm pretty sure they shouldn't be classified as muffins. What a waste of butter. Recipe says it makes six: it actually makes 12. Will burn. Will make a mess. From the sounds of these other reviewers, I was lucky.

Read the reviews! ... I sure should have. everything  about the amount of batter and topping is true - ONLY FILL THE MUFFIN CUPS 2/3 OF THE WAY! THIS MAKES 12 NORMAL SIZED MUFFINS!

If you follow the directions given in the recipe, you end up with a burnt mess.

Well not to brag but I am pretty good when it comes to successful baking.  So I think I'm a very good judge of how well a recipe works and tastes.  These muffins are ok, nothing fabulous here, a muffin.  Firstly the batter was so thick I was worried so please don't let that worry you, it will bake fine, mine did.  They rose just fine too, so they look very nice.  When it comes to a very tasty muffin these are lacking.  I won't make this recipe again, but if I did I would definitely add more  spice to kick them up a notch.  Overall I'm a wee bit disappointed.

There are lots of five star reviews for this recipes that make changes. I give the original recipe three stars: the taste is good but there were puddles of oil left after I pulled out each muffin from the pan (and I used liners!). I think in the future I would use less oil, as many other users have done, and replace with applesauce. Overall the flavor was good, though. Much like other posters, I found I got far more than 6 muffins out of this recipe. In fact, I got 16!

I am sorry, but these were awful..even my apple loving 8yr old turned them down..I have  30 yrs baking experience, which means I should have known better..I KNEW the baking powder amounts seemed unusually high..but I read the reviews and didn't find anyone taking issue with it.just with the filling the muffin pans too full.so I just decided to try the recipe anyway..big mistake..they came out too salty.. I don't know why I didn't just stick with my tried and true recipe. Idk..guess looking for something new..well, this isn't it..I am sorry.

With unexpected guests for breakfast I was desperate for a really good, quick muffin recipe with items I had on hand. This was perfect, easy and delicious.  I made 12 beautiful muffins. I only used one apple, as suggested, filled paper 2/3 c. full and added 1/2 t. extra of cinnamon to both the batter and the topping. The rest of the recipe I kept same amounts as listed and would not change a thing.I will definitely keep this recipe handy.

Why is this recipe rated so highly? I followed the directions exactly. I ended up with 9 muffins instead of 6. There was more than enough topping for the 9 I had. Within 10 minutes of being in the oven my kitchen was filled with smoke and I had batter all over the bottom of my oven.  Never achieved the nice, perfect muffins pictured. Instead I had a gooey mess that was barely edible, and a family that was still hungry

These are great muffins! I read the other reviews before I made these and added 2/3 c. of batter per muffin cup. Instead of chopping the apples, I grated them so it would be quicker (cause I don't like to waste a lot of time :P). Overall, my 8 year old brother kept coming in the kitchen while I was making these, saying "muffins aren't good for you! They're gross and too sweet!", but after they were done, he gobbled most of them up. I doubled all the ingredients and got about 15 muffins. Tanks for da recipe :D

Love these muffins! Very moist and remind me of old fashioned coffee cake. Diced the apples and halved the crumble topping. If you fill standard muffin tins to the top, it will make about ten muffins.

The taste was really good and it is a super easy recipe but I had to add more milk  and an egg. Otherwise the batter was too thick. I did also add some cinnamon and nutmeg. But the texture was really good and like I said, they are super easy to make.

Very good! I substituted 2/3 cup plain yogurt for 2/3 of the oil. I also reduced the apple to 1 and that was perfect for my taste. I tried to stretch it to a dozen, next time I’ll make 9. Yum!! I ate 3 right out of the oven!

Followed directions exactly - horrible mess!! Recipe is all wrong in so many ways. Way to many apples than needed. The topping was a gooey mess. Was actually a 12 muffin recipe, not 6. Muffins cools to a flat wired consistency.

Overall this is a good muffin. However, it calls for WAY too much butter in the topping. I only used 3/4 of the amount - and the muffin tins were a pool of melted butter. Thankfully I used cups in the tins, so the muffins are not greasy.  The muffins themselves were light and airy - very tasty!

There are two separate recipes in one. I got the toppling ingredients mixed up with the actual muffin process. Word to he wise don’t make this under duress of children and noise. Also I substituted white for brown sugar and made a ton of difference. I also ground my own flesh cinnamon sticks.

These are delicious. Rating would be 5 stars but recipe is wrong.  They make over 12 and if you aren’t careful they will make a big mess if you fill them too full and then add the topping. I suggest filling half way and then adding the topping. My kids devoured them.

Very quick and easy. Added 1 extra apple and 1/3 cup more milk. Instead of the topping, used 1 tsp of sugar with a bit of cinnamon sprinkled on top (wanted to make them healthier for the kiddies).

I made the recipe 3 times this past week with the following changes:  1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce in place of 1/3 cup oil; increased the  cinnamon in the batter to 2  teaspoons . Also reduced the butter in the topping  to 1/4 cup as  others had suggested . Finally I made 12 muffins by filling the muffin tins 1/2 - 2/3 full.  Everyone loved them! They were moist, had an excellent  Apple - Cinnamon taste.  I will definitely use this recipe again

Recipe said to fill muffin pan to the top and then add topping.  we we're glad we put it on a baking sheet. It overflowed a lot and we used 8 muffin cups.  I think it will make 10 to 12 muffins. They were moist and delicious.  My granddaughter and I added it to our favorites.  Can't wait to gobble up an other one.

Wish I had read the reviews before I jumped into this. Still waiting for them to finish cooking but had to open the house and turn on all my fans because of the smoke. DO NOT use 1/2 of butter in the topping.

Well it tasted yummy, although it did not come out right at all. There is something off with these directions. My muffins did not rise like they should of and that crumble topping recipe was off. I wish I had listened to the comments. These came out more like an apple upside down cake. Going to try and find another recipe that comes out right.

I doubled the recipe and used one apple which ended up being plenty of Apple .  However when they baked they overflowed and made a HUGE mess . So if I were to try the recipe again , i would only half fill the cups and sprinkle only a tiny bit of the crumble top on top . I'd also add another egg to help hold them together better . They were very crumbly .

These came out really well!!! I loved them and can't wait to make them again. 

I agree that this recipe yields 12 medium sized muffins but I figured it out  while preparing the batter so it was all good for me. Also I skipped the last part and replaced it by sprinkling only sugar and cinnamon as I didn't want a buttery topping on the muffins.

I added walnuts to it as extra and they added the kick to them! Good job!

As written, this recipe is a mess. Not enough liquid, I had to add around 1/3 C more milk to make it somewhat batter-like. Unless the author was making jumbo sized muffins, this makes way more than 6. It made 12 standard-sized muffins for me. Never ever fill muffin tins more than 2/3 full unless you want a  mess to clean up from the overflow after baking. 1/2 C butter in the crumb topping is way too much. About 1/4 cup is much more appropriate if you'd like to sprinkle it and not have a greasy mess after it bakes. So as written, I'd give this recipe 2 stars at the most. However, the taste is really delicious and this is a 4 or 5 star recipe with the changes I've highlighted.

I made these for mothers day and they were AMAZING!! Everybody loved them and asked me to make them again!
I tripled the recipe because I needed enough to feed seven  people and instead of making 18 like I thought is would it made 32!!!! A double bonus, it made so many!!!  I was thrilled. I use 4 apples and that was plenty of apple chunks for 32 muffins, 4 apples is the perfect amount for 32 muffins or tripling the recipe!  I used granny smith apples and since the actual muffins are so sweet  the tartness of the apples really compliment each other. More muffins for less ingredients. I also omit the crumble on top and nobody cared, the muffins didn't need the crumble! they were so delicious without. I also filled the muffin cups 3/4ths of the way full and they were the perfect size. I totally recommend the recipe especially for a big family!(Like mine). Thanks so much for the awesome recipe!!! I loved it!

Delicious!  At first I was worried there were too many apples and the muffins may not hold together, but they did.  The flavor is so apple-y and cinnamon-y, really good and moist.  Will make these again.

Turned out great!   I followed the advice of others.  I used one large honey crisp apple, and I cut the butter in half.  I also used brown sugar instead of white for the topping.  By the way, it makes way too much topping - I only used about half.  And of course I only filled the muffin cups  3/4 full.  Made a perfect amount for 12 muffins.

The directions are totally wrong. I threw caution to the wind and tossed it all in! I'm not even sure what quantities I had in the end. Heaps of sugar, baking powder,  and butter with a seemingly small amount of flour. Will it explode? This is a possibility. It's  looking puffy and melty so something should be yummy!

I made these today and they came out tasting so good! They were moist and very tasty. This makes 12 not 6; when I filled the muffin cups to the top, it made 11. I had a problem with the topping of butter, sugar, flour, and cinnamon.  One half of butter is too much and it left a mess and was hard to clean afterwards. Maybe use only 1/4 cup of butter instead. I also substituted applesauce instead of oil because I don't like using vegetable oil. Looking forward to making them again with new changes!

So good - even my oat-hating children gobble them up!  Sweet enough to eat for dessert (which we did!)  Added 1/4 c. extra brown sugar, as suggested by many reviewers, but don't think  they really needed it.  Also put the extra 2T flour in the topping.  Excellent recipe!

These muffins are very tasty.  The whole family loved them!  I doubled the recipe as printed and I was able to get 11 jumbo muffins.  I baked them at 400 on convection for 22 minutes.  I will probably make a different crumb top next time as this is just a sticky mess if you overfill the muffin tins.  Otherwise I was very happy with how they turned out!

Great taste but... Only used one Apple, not sure how you could squeeze two in to this recipe unless they were very small. Even with only one Apple it was way too much batter for 6 standard size muffin cups, ended up making 9 for us. Additionally, the amount of strudel was ridiculous even for 9 muffins. Not sure what size muffin pan the author had but each one would have to hold between 3/4 to 1 cup of batter each and be at least 3" in diameter to use this much strudel. Still, they were very tasty.

Lesson learned today, don't forget to read the reviews prior to starting any recipe!  Once I realized it was way too much batter for six muffins, I did refer to the reviews.  Probably saved me a mess and even a failed result.

I immediately took batter out of each cup.  But since I'm living in a temporary situation, I didn't have another muffin tin.  I grabbed a small round dish and a a paper cup fit fine, next is used a small 5" round casserole dish for the remainder of the batter.  And yes a stick of butter was way too much.  I added more flour to make a basic crumb topping for all my muffins and had to throw some away.  I'm sorry I didn't add more cinnamon as others suggested.  All in all they came out pretty good.  I'll make again with what I know now and also incorporate some of the changes made by others.

I ended up doubling the recipe, thinking it was for six regular sized muffins. I ended up with 24 regular sized muffins. There were too many apples even though I actually didn't put in the full doubled amount. I left out about one and a half of the chopped apples. The crumble was actually a paste that ended up soaking the muffins in butter. Filling them to the top ended up with muffins spread all over the muffin tins and some dripping down into my oven. I will make this again, but I won't double it this time and I'll follow the suggestions given in some of the other comments for the crumble topping and not filling it all the way to the top.

Cut the sugar by about a quarter cup.  Cut the topping ingredients by half.  Added a splash of milk as the batter was too thick (my apples were probably too large).  I used one giant Granny Smith and one small honey crisp.  Easy and delicious!!

Poorly portioned recipe. Too much topping too many apples. I wasn't going to change everything. I want to know it's right and tastes good as is.

This turned out amazing! But next time I will make as a loaf as it was very messy and burnt easily. Could just be my pans though lol. Enjoy they are delicious!

Will definitely make again. Did change lil. Added 1 tsp of all spice, 1 tsp nutmeg. used only 1/4 white sugar the other half brown, used 1/2 cup of milk, added chopped walnuts and used butter instead of veg oil.  I sauted the apples in butter and brown sugar before adding to mixture.  I also added 4 chopped up dates and used 2&1/2 apples.

We had two old delicious apples that weren't very crisp so I searched for a "light cinnamon apple muffin".  I wouldn't call this light but I would call it delicious.  Happy I read former reviews as I filled 12 muffin cups and had topping and batter to spare.  We usually put a little butter on our muffins but no need here- the buttery sugar topping was plenty.  I forced myself to only eat one at dinner but look forward to the leftovers.  Served with sausage yellow split pea soup and chopped salad.

This is a very delicious recipe. I baked these as mini muffins, and they turned out WONDERFUL. I added more cinnamon, and a splash of vanilla extract. The batter needed a touch more milk (probably 2 or 3 tablespoons). I baked it without the crumb topping and they were still just as good. The apples were dispersed evenly throughout the batter, which is essential! Lightly dust them with cinnamon on top, and these make for the perfect fall treat.

I followed the previous suggestions and only filled 2/3rds, which is usual for muffins. I also only used 1/4c of butter for topping. Another difference in my muffins was adding 1/4 t each of allspice and ginger the flavor is spicier/warmer. I kept the apple pieces bigger too. Perfect for a cold autumn day!

Thanks for the recipe!

Very yummy-especially warm right out of oven! I substituted 1/2 cup whole grain flour and cut the topping amount in half.  It  made 14 muffins (filled about halfway).  Will be keeping this one for the future!

Best Apple Muffins I've Ever Had! My 15 year old daughter made these, and I was concerned they might not work out right because she is still learning what works in cooking and baking. She's gotten a lot better at cooking, but some recipes don't work well for her because they require intuitive cooking skills like adding more flour than called for, etc.  Well, her results were PERFECT. I think this must be a good recipe for that reason alone.  The texture was perfect- not to dense or too light. The taste was sweet and flavorful, and I love the sugary topping on these! They looked and tasted like they came from a bakery. I can hardly wait for her to make them again!

I made some small changes to this recipe and my husband said these were his favorite muffins I've made him! The smell while baking these is heavenly. Here's what I did: I added a little more salt in the batter and 1/8 t salt in the topping mixture. I used 1 1/2 apples instead of two. Instead of all cinnamon, I replaced half of it with Apple Pie Spice. I added 1 t vanilla extract. As per other reviews, I only filled the cups to 2/3 full and it made 12 muffins. Lastly, it wasn't really working to mix the butter cubes in with a fork, so I just used my hand and it was much easier. These muffins only needed 18 minutes in the oven.

I luckily was reading the reviews after throwing in oven and the tray was a bubbling mess of butter. I managed to drain it and clean it up a bit so hoping they turn out edible still. I also noticed the mixture was way too dry so added more milk...not 100% on this one...watching it closely to try and save it... :(. Update - they aren't really presentable. They taste fine though they look like a wreck

They taste good but the recipe is a disaster! It made 12 instead of 6 and the butter crumb topping made too much (I should have used 1/2 of it) and melted everywhere and ran onto the bottom of the oven!

Lovely! At first the batter seemed quite dry and thick, but after mixing the apple (which I shredded coarsely) into the batter for a few minutes, it moistened right up and looked like a proper muffin batter. I swapped one apple for shredded carrot, used a mix of white and brown sugar and didn't bother with the topping. This made 24 tasty mini muffins (cooked for 12 minutes instead of 25) that will be frozen and taken out as needed for school snacks.

My kids and I loved it. I followed the advice of others and put less apples in it, used apple sauce too and half of the butter for the crumble topping. I also doubled the batch for leftover batter for the next day and I change the baking powder to be instead of 4 tsp baking powder, I do 2 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp cream of tartar, and 1 tsp. baking soda. I do this in other recipes and it keeps the batter light. Delicious

My family loved these muffins. I substituted the topping with a sprinkling of sugar. The recipe didn't specify a type of apple, so I used the 3 small golden delicious that were slowly dieing in my fruit basket. My onlyrics recommendation is to NOT store these muffins in a Zipplock. They become overly moist.

Its very easy recipe and quick to make.  
I added 1 big apple instead of two.  Made 12 muffins.
For the crumble, I added less butter than in the recipe.  

Makes lovely muffins.

Great recipe!!!! I loved it and so did my family!! Though I had enough to make 11 muffins not 6. It was sticky though, I had greased the pan beforehand but I still ruined one or two trying to get them out. Please could you find a solution for this? If the muffins weren't so hard to get out this would be a five star recipe. Overall it tasted very good! I would definitely recommend it to everybody!

I followed the recipe fairly closely. The actual batter was fine. I added 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce. The muffin was moist, sweet, dense. Very good. The topping was not quite right. It was too much and it burned on the edges and was oddly chewy. While fine, I would not make that topping again. The recipe makes 12 normal sized muffins.

I wish I read the reviews first before making these. Sigh. It was a huge mess in my oven and overflowed all over. Two apples were too many. Too much butter in the topping.The taste is there and they are good, but look terrible.

Love this recipe, I've made it a few times. The only changes I've made are adding more cinnamon, a dash of ground cloves and nutmeg. I also substituted 1/3 cup of brown sugar for the same amount of white.

Also, I swapped out ½ cup APF for Oat flour. I like to do this in certain recipies because it keeps from being overly soft or fluffy. Makes them a bit hardier. Filled it 2/3. I didn't even realize the recipie suggested doing so until I read the reviews.

Didn't have vegetable oil  and opted for coconut oil. Will definately be doing that again!

Tasty results but a poorly edited recipe. This recipe makes 6 JUMBO muffins or 12 standard size muffins. They were pretty chunky and didn't rise much. If you prefer a smoother muffin, chop your apples very fine or use apple sauce. I find the butter/sugar/flour crumble toppings to be pretty wasteful, so I skipped that. Instead, after baking I dipped the muffins in melted butter, then in a bit of sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. If I make it again, I'll chop my apples much smaller.

Yummy!! I made these exactly as directed, using one Granny Smith apple and one Honey Crisp apple (it's just what I happened to have on hand). The batter was thick (more like a sticky dough). After reading reviews about the mess, I used a large muffin tin, regular sized muffin liners, and filled the liner using a 1/3 cup measuring cup as my scoop. I did place the muffin tin on a large cookie sheet to prevent too much spillover. Now, the top of the muffin tin was a mess, but it never spilled over. I suppose if I would change anything, it would be the topping. Either reduce the butter by half, as others have suggested, or only place a small bit of the mixture on the top of the muffin. The butter is what caused the run over and mess. It did yield 12 muffins, not 6.

Very nice muffins! But they should really warn you not to smother the batter completely with the topping. Only put a little bit of the topping on the middle of the batter - not completely covering the batter to the edge otherwise you'll get a mess all over your muffin tray as it bakes and potentially all over the bottom of the oven!

I enjoyed this recipe with a few changes...I mixed it all and added the flour after all the other ingredients except apples then added the apples. I only used 1 apple per batch but I would say 2 apples is about right if you want the apple in every bite. I also added a tsp of vanilla and I used brown sugar in the topping instead of granulated sugar. I used cold butter, as soft butter ends up being too smooth and not crumbly enough for sprinkling. Cut in the butter with a pastry cutter if you have one, it works great!! If you use the suggested amount of butter for the topping I definitely think it is delicious but make sure you put a pan under your muffin pan (on the next rack) because IT WILL run over the sides (had to clean my oven after my first batch) otherwise you can just use half the butter and it will be fine. Make sure your muffin cups are only filled about halfway with the batter then no more than 2/3rds full after topping, again that's another mistake I made :) it was delicious, My husband and 4 kids loved them and they continuously asked if they could have more...hope this review helps!! Recipe will actually make closer to 12 muffins

My thoughts:
 *there was twice the amt of strusel as needed..
*Might add 1/4 tsp more cinnamon to muffins(personal taste) 
*Batter is very thick, as it should be.
Lots of great flavor, very moist..reheated in micro great!

I love these! Crunchy top and very gooey inside, they're spectacular! It does yield extra, it made 18 muffins for me. I measured everything exactly, except for i didnt have any vegetable oil so i substituted butter instead. Also, instead of using whole apples, i opted for 12oz chopped, or 10 packs of apple slices from Mcdonalds.. . i work there so i sometimes get to take home the expired product! They already come cored and peeled! These are great! Tast amazing! Also tried putting chocolate chips before the crumbly topping on tne unbaked muffin. That was good too.

We used whole wheat pastry flour and a Pink Lady apple. As other reviewers suggested, we substituted brown sugar for some of the white sugar. Instead of the topping in the recipe, we used mixed brown and white sugar with cinnamon. We did a half batch, using a whole egg and reducing the milk by 2T. We made mini muffins and baked for 10 minutes. When we were spooning it into the muffin cups, we thought there was too much apple to the amount of batter, but they baked up great!

Wished I read the reviews first.  Probably would not have taken the time to make these muffins.  They did not turn out well.  Used two medium apples.  There was more apple than muffin when baked.  I thought with 2 teaspoons of baking powder they would rise more than they did. In fact they really didn't raise at all.  Too much butter for the topping.  It made the muffins messy. Then scrubbing out the baked on butter/sugar mess left in the tins.

They are baking as I'm writing. They are  a bit messy. I'm baking in my convection oven,which makes the mess very small. The topping mixture didn't crumble,but was tasty. I followed the recipe exactly. They are beautiful.. ..... My family and I just ate them. They are very dense! Wow,very tasty. I will be making them again. You have to tweek the recipe to suit your own desire,but overall they were delicious.

I used half a cup more of milk, and less butter for the crumble. Followed the reviews and didn't fill the cups full, so no mess. Also, I used self-raising flour, which I think helped in it rising. Nice taste, not too sweet but very apple-y! I also got 12 muffins out of it, not 6.

Delicious muffins.  I used 3/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar instead of all white.  I also used  1 extra apple since mine were small.  I also did not make the streusel topping, and they are still good.

These were good but I agree with the other reviewers about the proportions.  I made six muffins as indicated and put as much topping on each as possible.  I had a lot of topping left over.  The muffins overflowed and made a mess of my oven and my kitchen was filled with smoke when they were done.  This definitely would make 12 muffins easily and my oven would not have ended up a huge mess.  I would definitely make these again though, only make 12 instead of six.

me and my sister got bored and decided to try these out. making it was really easy. however, when it came to using so much butter I was kind of hesitant but went along with the recipe anyway. I also shouldn't have filled the cups to the top, they looked a mess coming out the oven. the tops of the muffin were huge and the insides didn't look like they baked very well. I haven't tasted them yet, im a little scared. LOL

This is the best recipe for apple muffins I've ever used! I've made it several times and I've always received great praise! They taste even better if you slice one in half and add butter on the inside. I greatly recommend this recipe for anyone who wants an awesome breakfast!

I loved this recipe! It was my favorite of all the muffins I made! I changed some things that will definitely make a change. There were many mistakes but luckily I caught them before I started and they were great! 1: Instead of 1/2 cup butter use 1/4 cup butter. It prevents it from being goop. 2: Use a pastry cutter for the topping, it makes it more crumbly. 3: Do NOT fill the batter all the way to the top of the cups, if you do, it equals mess. No one has time for that. There were many mistakes but you wouldn't be human if you didn't make mistakes, right? Anyways bakers make mistakes just like I do all the time. Over all, these were the best muffins I ever made!

Wonderful recipe! I made these In a large muffin pan, and it only made 5 muffins (even at 3/4 full) .  We like a lot of the crumbly topping, so I  use the measurements the recipe called for, a reviewer said to cut back on the butter, but I did not. I will double the recipe for next time and possibly freeze half...we will see, but this is a great recipe!!

I made these muffins, and they tasted great! This recipe has a few problems though. First, this makes 12 standard sized muffins, not 6.  Also, use 1/4 cup of butter for the topping.   I will definitely make these again!

These muffins were great. I only used one apple and filled the cups just over half full. I ended up with 8 large muffins. I definitely did not use all of the topping for one batch, there is way too much, but it can be used for another batch. The batter did seem thick as I was filling the cups, but it turned out ok. These muffins looked so cute in my red plaid muffin cups!!

Great recipe! The final product was delicious! The only problem was that you will get double the amount of muffins then the recipe says you will get. when I made this recipe I added apple juice and only used 1/2 the amount of chopped apples. Also I followed the recommendations and only filled the cups 2/3 of the way to the rim which was perfect. This recipe was fairly easy however it did take much longer to prepare than 20 minutes. Despite this it was worth it! the muffins came out great!

I liked the recipe over all, but the muffin were a bit too moist. I used melted butter instead of oil. I also found I have a lot of topping left over(which I plan to use on apple crisp). I found with a fork it was hard to get the butter incorporated in the crumb topping, it also didn't work well with a pastry cutter. Two knives worked best.

They were so good!! I made mine in a mini muffin tin, filled full, but because there were so many apples (I used 2 1/2 because mine were smaller) there were a lot of spaces for the batter to expand. I did only bake for 15 minutes, because they were minis.Only thing I think I'd do different is maybe less butter in the topping to make it "sprinkle" better. They were VERY moist and a hit with my entire family. Now if I was making big muffins I'd be leary to fill them full, but I have a tiny mess where butter from the topping dripped.

Writing this review as I eat a muffin! Made these today with suggested modifications from other reviews.
This is what I did...
1. the recipe for 6 does yield 12 muffins if you fill the cups till 2/3 full.
2. One big apple is enough.
3. 2 tsp cinnamon
4. 2/3 cups of milk instead of 1/3

My husband will most likely finish them all tonight. I'll be making these again! :)

USE 1 CUP MILK. Or else you will end up with batter that is more like cookie dough than muffin batter. Also, it makes 12 muffins.

Well I followed the recipe to the t, minus filling 6 muffin cups, I made 12. I must say so far...FABULOUS!  I did notice the butter was going to overflow so I just popped a cookie sheet on the rack below the muffin pan and BAM! Disaster avoided! My husband LOVES them! So I must say aside from everyone else's issues, I had none and this recipe is fantastic!

I wish I had read the reviews first.  This recipe does NOT yield 6 muffins, it yields 12 that if filled to the top as instructed causes the topping to bubble over fill your house with smoke and leave you scrubbing your oven for hours!! Sure the finished muffins are yummy but use caution an scale back the ingredients first.

Just baked them! Just ate one! 
Very good.... Huge muffins with the crunchy tops that I love. Hoping the family enjoys these as well! I did make a few adjustments to the recipe as well. Mainly for allergy concerns so I knocked out the egg added two bananas and apple sauce instead. Also, used a tad more milk. Id make again. Not regularly as they are definitely not that good for you Im sure!

To my dismay I didn't have any muffin tins ~ do I used a bundt cake pan.  The only thing I changed was the recommendation to cut the amount of butter in half.  I clearly had plenty of room in my pan and cooked the muffin "cake" for 30 - 40 minutes.  YUMMY!  Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

These are great! The crumble topping you add at the end makes a little more than you need. But they are very easy to make and taste great.

I tried this for the first time today, but in a 9 x 9 pan. It is very tasty! I didn't alter the recipe at all. I did reduce the temp to 375. It took a while for it to cook completely in the center with all the butter, but when it was done, it had a nice, thick, TASTY streusel, which I LOVE. I will definitely make this again!

After a few changes to the recipe due to the multiple reviews on how much to fill the muffin cups and the amount of butter to use (I ended up only 1/4) the muffins looked great and tasted even better! 

Warning: the batter tastes really good, don't eat it all before baking. ;)

Try a little bit more cinnamon for more taste, and if you add a little bit more milk to make it less clumpy.

Was delicious.  However I made one small change.  I added one extra apple (Mine were small) and did NOT fill to the top.  never do that.  I got 14 average sized muffins out of it.  I cut back on the toppings tho.  I just used a little sprinkle of nutmeg, cinnamon and brown sugar on the top of each and they turned out great.  To make again I would cut back on the 3/4 c of sugar the recipe calls for.  1/2 c or even less would be sufficient.

Wow1 These were superb!  I found nothing wrong with the directions......as the recipe says, it made 6 muffins.  My family just loved them.  I would agree with other reviewers that the topping could be enough for double the recipe.  Will definitely be baking these again.

These turned out pretty good!  I would have given it 5 stars, except I had to make some modifications.  As suggested by others, I only used 1 apple. I substituted the egg with 1 TBS ground flax mixed with 3 TBS water and the vegetable oil and butter with coconut oil.  I also halved the oil for the crumb topping (1/4 cup coconut oil instead of 1/2 cup of butter).  I only filled the muffin cups 2/3 of the way full as suggested by others and it made a dozen, not 6.  They came out great!  Moist and delicious.  Can't wait to take them to work tomorrow!

I agree with the other posts that the measurements are a bit off but they were still very tasty.  I ended up with 8 good sized muffins.  Thanks to those if you who warned that the topping would spill over- I put a cookie sheet under my muffin pan to catch it and luckily don't have to clean up a messy oven!;)

Do not use small size muffin pan. This is for 6 large not 12 small. And way too much butter in crumble. I should have known.

Following the recipe as well as suggested changes led to a delicious, most, tasty muffin that I'll definitely save the recipe for. I did however change the milk from 1/3 cup to 1/2. The batter was just a little too thick for my taste.

I alter every recipe to be healthier. These muffins turned out amazing! Use apple sauce instead of oil, add a tsp of vanilla for added flavour and use all wholewheat flour. To die for!

A healthier zest to a good recipe....I added 3 apples, used only 1/3 cup brown sugar instead of 3/4 cup white sugar, added 2 Tbsp orange juice, removed some of the oil and substituted with 1/3 c apple sauce and used 1/2 whole wheat flour & 1/2 white flour. I didn't add the topping since they were good without it. Great muffins - light, fluffy and yummy!

These turned out much better then expected. I read some of the reviews and they were a great help. As in one review it was said not to fill the cups completely before putting on the topping. You should listen to that one, I could see that a big mess was averted.

These are absolutely delicious.  Note:  588 calories each!  I would recommend cutting way back on the butter used in the topping--maybe only use 1/4 cup.  Also, apples vary greatly in size.  I picked one ginourmous apple off our tree and it was too much.  Cut the apples in fairly small chunks.  I wish I didn't know how good and easy these were...588 calories, 588 calories...

Recipe was great, I did not make the topping because my husband and I are trying to eat healthier, and it didn't seem necessary, was delicious on its own. I used oats in the mix, and that seemed to hold it together enough so that I could fill the tins all the way. I sprinkled some oats on top, and it was awesome!

As written, this recipes amounts for the ingredients are all off.  I was making this as written when I realized this will not turn out. I had to add more liquid so I added a little more milk, a little more oil and some sour cream until I felt I had the right consistency of a batter.  Also, I felt 2 apples were too much so I only put in 1 and 1/2 apples.  I didn't have enough batter to fill it to the top so 2/3rds full plus adding the streusel topping works.  For the streusel topping, I only used 1/4 cup of butter.  I wasn't sure how these would turn out but with the modifications, they turned out pretty good.  Great flavor. Only 2 stars because of the measurements of the ingredients were of. This recipe makes 6 jumbo muffins. I should have read the reviews first as other reviewers also said the ingredient measurements were incorrect.

Did not enjoy this recipie. Should have read the reviews before I made them. My muffin cups were over flowing in the oven causing it to smoke and go on fire!!!! They ask for way to much butter for the topping! Will never make this recipie again

I loved this. I was looking for something quick and easy and this definitely is. They are also very good. I agree the measurements are off. I actually doubled the recipe because it said only made 6 muffins. I ended up with 24. It didn't really matter because we will most certainly be eating them all.

What an awesome recipe!  After reading the reviews I followed the suggestions of using half brown and half white sugar and doubling the cinnamon. Replaced oil with equal amount of applesauce and cut the amount of butter in the topping. I also added about 1/3 cup of carrot/apple pulp (I juice) to try to sneak something healthy in my kids diet.  It made 12 regular muffins AND 12 mini muffins, and everyone LOVED them!  This will be a new breakfast staple in this house.

This made a LOT more than six muffins! Just a heads up. I added more milk and cinnamon. Also, to the crumble, I added graham Crackers because it wasn't coming out that nice. Otherwise, good muffins. I got about 11 muffins out of this, would've gotten more if I had filled the muffin cups less.

Delicious!  I added 1/2 tsp extra cinnamon to the batter.  I only made 1/3 crumb topping for the tops of the muffins.  Do not fill cups all the way.  Only 2/3 full.

We added the sprinkle to the top ( it was barely a sprinkle with all the butter) and it overflowed and started bubbling. DO NOT whatsoever fill the sprinkle to the top or else it will leave your pan a mess. They all stuck together in one piece. The flavor was pretty nice, though.Try the measurements people recommend and do not do the original recipe. Thanks for reading!

I just tried this recipe, and took some of the suggestions made by other reviewers.  I used 12 muffin cups (which, if I'm being honest, I didn't even notice the recipe said for 6), and reduced the butter in the crumb recipe.
I'm so glad I reduced the butter, because each of the cups has a fair amount of grease (be it butter or oil) in the base of it after I've taken the muffins out to cool.  Now, I did use paper muffin cups instead of greasing, so maybe it's something there.  Just wondering if anyone else had that problem?  
I also added 1tsp of vanilla out of habit.  The recipe probably didn't need it with all of the sugar.

I like the recipe. I used 1 cup all purpose flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour. I used only one apple and used apple sauce to replace the vegetable oil. For the topping I only mixed cinnamon and sugar and sprinkled it on top. The muffins are healthier that way.

I've made the recipe here with the most common corrections in the previous comments, i.e. 2/3 cup milk, only 1 apple, and half the butter for the crumble topping.

For those interested in a healthier but still good alternative: measure 1 1/2 cups oats to match, process them into a powder, and use to replace the flour. Also, cut the sugar in half, and omit the crumble topping.

Just quadrupled this recipe and used the suggestions of one reviewer to use half applesauce/half oil and half brown sugar/white sugar and half butter for topping.  I used macintosh apples and left them in pretty big chunks.  Didn't know if it would affect the muffins.  It didn't!  I baked them 18 minutes and they were absolutely mouthwatering!  I used regular size muffin tins, so it made 12 muffins instead of 6 for one batch.  They always freeze well, so I put a bunch in the freezer for when my sons come home from college for Christmas :)

These were good but not all that I had hoped. They turned out heavy and not very good looking. They tasted better than they looked. I was able to make about 18 muffins so not sure why the serving size on the original recipe was so off.

1. The liquid to dry ratio is way too low and ends up in a play-dough-like mixture. I had to add extra milk to thin it out so I could fold in the apples. 
2. Unless you have a cast iron fork, there's no way to mix the topping by hand. I recommend pulsing in the food processor. The topping recipe also makes a lot and I found myself binning a good portion of it. What a waste.

All said, the muffins came okay. I didn't have any problem with them over-topping the cups (maybe because I thinned out the batter). Sorry, but I can't rate this one my usual 4 or 5 stars...

Make these all the time. I even make them easier by leaving out the streusel topping and just giving them a sprinkle of brown granulated sugar before they go into the oven.

We started with this recipe and made our own changes and we love it!  We added 3 tbls of apple sauce and 1/6 cup of oil, changed the cinnamon in the mix to 1 1/2 tsp, and added 1 tsp of pure vanilla extract.  In the topping, we cut the butter down to 1/4 cup and we split the sugar between white sugar and light brown sugar.  We added some chocolate chips because we love chocolate (on some at least)!  The muffins were great out of the oven and for a couple of days later.

I tried this recipe and unlike all the all other reviewers I found it worked without making any changes.  It created a thick mixture and not runny andI think that's why it didn't matter that I filled it to the top.  I also cut my apple into fairly large chunks.  I think the reviews suggesting the author of the recipe deliberately gave the wrong instructions are unkind because as I said, I followed the instructions to the letter and they turned out fine.

DO NOT FILL TO THE RIM. Wow. I just learned a valuable lesson- read the reviews on the recipe.

This is by far the best muffin recipe I've ever made! I filled mine to the top without a problem. Making lovely jumbo muffins. It looks like it will be too much apple but it was perfect! Only thing is it made twice as much topping than I needed. That's ok, I can take out some calories by throwing out the leftovers :D

Read the reviews!!  I'm so glad I did.  This makes 12 muffins, not 6.  Grease your muffin tin well and fill only 2/3 full.  I still had a touch of overflow, but it cleaned up easily on my non-stick pan.  If you make 6 muffins with this mix you're going to have a disastrous mess.

Following suggestions, I added some extra milk to the batter and reduced the amount of chopped apple.  I didn't add the extra cinnamon, but think it would be a good idea, as the finished product was just a bit bland.

I didn't really love the butter topping.  The ratios seem off to me.  It spread out and got thin and crunchy, which was okay but not super delicious..  I'd look for a different topping recipe.

Overall, the family was pleased and the apple taste was satisfying, but I'd probably look for a different recipe next time rather than spend the time modifying this one to make it as tasty as it should be.

They're tasty, however I wish I had read the reviews because I filled them to the top. No mess in my oven though thank God. It was hard to get them out of the pan, but that could've been my fault for trying to do it after five minutes. They're very good though. Oh, and the six servings actually made nine muffins for me, which means I must have filled the tin less than others.

So I read the reviews before making this recipe but most of the complaints about the batter turned out to be true. 

The batter was really thick so I added only 1 and 1/3 of peeled and cut apples along with 1/4 cup of warm water. Because I am in a high altitude environment, Colorado, I added 1 tbs. of flour as well. 

This recipe yields WAY more then 6 muffins but who is complaining when they taste so great? Thank you for this recipe even though I had to make some minor adjustments!

I found these muffins to be very good in texture and in taste. I did make a few changes though. For the muffin itself I substituted the apples with 1/2 cup of apple sauce. I also added about three table spoons of brown sugar but I don't know if this changed the overall taste. For the topping I used only 1/3 cup of butter and it turned out great. Dividing the batter into 10 muffin cups and cooking for 22 minutes worked perfectly for me. I have used this recipe many times and plan to continue making these muffins.

This recipe was great! The only thing I did differently was double the recipe so I could make a dozen muffins and double the cinnamon/apples which was delicious! The recipe didn't specify the size of apple and I had small ones so I think I used like three and a half small Fuji apples. The muffins puffed up so large they are just delicious! I took them fresh out of the oven cut one in half put some butter on it and shared it with my mate. DELICIOUS! Definitely adding this recipe to my recipe box. :)

This recipe is very tasty!  I changed things a bit, going on the suggestions that I had read, and they turned out great!  I substituted apple sauce for oil (adding just 1 tablespoon of oil in addition), and I used spelt flour and xanthan gum instead of wheat flour.  They are really yummy and would suggest them to anyone.

I wish I had read the reviews...the muffins are very delicious however, it makes 6 giant muffins.  I could tell by the batter it was more than 6 regular muffins so I used giant muffin papers.  Since I used the giant muffin papers it changed the cook time to more like 30-35 minutes.  Not sure if this is suppose to happen but when I took the muffins out of the muffin pan there is a pool of butter on the bottom, so 1/2 cup of butter is probably a little extreme for the topping.  Will make again but will have to make some adjustments.

This is a great recipe. I have taken these muffins to brunches. My husband likes them so much he requested them often and eventually learned to make them himself. The teenagers also love them. Tasty and easy. I have substituted half wheat flour and almond milk. Still tasty.

These muffins are delicious and easy to make, but the recipe only makes enough for 9 muffins, not 12, so next time I will double the recipe.  Also, the muffins fall apart very easily and the topping did not fully cook through. I suggest using paper liners in your muffin tins to make the muffins easier to remove. Not sure what to do about the topping.

Only makes 6 muffins so be careful.  I subbed out applesauce for the apples and held back a little on the milk.  I also added more cinnamon.  They are a little dense, but very good.

This is a great simple recipe.  I made them as written the first time to rave reviews.  The second time, I added some mini semi-sweet chocolate chips, and my husband literally danced across the kitchen floor!  The only change:  the recipe fits 12 muffins better than 16.

It's very easy to make, and I like the taste. Just have one problem with it: after taking the muffins out from the baking pan, I found a lot of oil left in the pan cups. Don't know why it happened.

Not sure what the last rater did wrong, but my children LOVED this recipe.  I did follow a few of the suggestions, like more cinnamon, but mostly followed the recipe and it turned out GREAT!  Muffin mix does tend to be thicker, so looked just as it should.

Yum! I added just a little more milk (about 1/2 of the 1/3 cup). I also only used sugar/brown sugar/cinnamon for the topping. Awesome muffins. I'll be making these again and again.

As the recipe is made it's a gooey hard mess.  I had to add 2/3 cup milk and a bit more to make it loose enough to stir.    I then added 1/2 cup walnuts and raisins which made the muffins incredible!

I made this exactly by the recipe. The muffin was tasty, but the topping didn't crumble. It boiled over so it was a good thing I put a cookie sheet under my muffin pan. I used a jumbo muffin pan so I only had six muffins. I was worried that the batter was too thick but it came out fine. Overall it came out good, next time I will use less butter for the topping.

This recipe was very good, we all enjoyed them. The only thing that I changed, after reading reviews, was I only used 1 apple instead of two and I thought that was plenty. I don't see how two apples would even fit into the batter because there were a lot of apples with just using one. Anyway, liked these a lot and will be making these again for quick breakfasts. Thanks, Mindy!

The reviews have this recipe all over the map.  Because it said 6 servings, I doubled the recipe as it stands AND filled 12-muffin pan full.  For the topping though I reduced the butter to half & melted it.  I filled the muffin cups 1/2 way with batter, added the cinnamon mixture and then filled them to the top.   I had no mess to speak of and very nice large muffins with cinnamon-sugar inside.   I used a Demarle regular muffin pan on a silpat and baking sheet, so the even cooking could have made the difference in no overflow.

Great recipe to show off your cooking skills with!  It's easy (other than that pesky butter part), it's relatively quick, and my boyfriend begs for it every time there are apples in the house.  In fact, I might go make some now!

this recipe, as written, did not work for me.  Way too many apples and the batter was very thick.  I had to add a lot of milk so I could mix the batter.  The finished product did not taste very good either - the chunks of apples were kind of weird.  Still edible, ate it so it wouldn't be wasted - but I won't be making it again.

this recipe is amazing. I'm always looking for a great cake to make and just keep around for coffee or for the kids.  This is perfect!  EXCEPT I poured the batter into a loaf pan so it became an Apple Cinnamon Loaf!  Delicious.  Everyone LOVE, LOVE, LOVED IT!  The apple sort of float down to the bottom so yoou have this delicious moist-ness ....great recipe!

Since I live overseas, I am very grateful for recipes in English online.  I usually don't rate recipes but I did not care for this one.  It should say 2 small apples.  My dough was almost only apples.  And a half cup of butter is WAY too much.  I ended up with huge clumps of dough that were impossible to sprinkle.  They smelled great but tasted BAD.  Very disappointing.

Very strange recipe. Batter was too thick so I added some extra milk. The topping was more like batter so I mixed in some quick oats. Don't fill muffin cups to top, 2/3 as normal. I think this recipe works better as a bread using less sugar.

Really great recipe. I followed a review I read and only used 1 apple and also added 1 tsp of allspice and they came out PERFECT! Though it was a lot of batter left after filling the muffin pan for 6, I just used the remaining batter and made a bread out of it.

I made these looking for something a little healthier than cupcakes, but still fun for Valentine's Day week.  I used the Wilton mini heart cake pan, which makes 6 small hearts.  The recipe made 9 of them, but I think it would have been 6 in a regular muffin tin... those who are getting 12 are probably using a cupcake tin.  I filled it all the way to the top and they came out perfect; they don't rise like cupcakes would.  I didn't use the topping; instead, I made a cream cheese icing and added a tablespoon of apple juice instead of milk to thin it.  I frosted the muffins and sprinkled them with pink and red sugars.  They looked and tasted great, and it as EASY.  I'll definitely save this one to use again!

Great recipe! I also did not fill the muffin cups all the way, and reduced the amount of sugar in the topping. I found that there was a little too much butter in the topping so I reduced that also and added some quick oats. A also had some left over apples that I sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon and honey and then added the apples to the tops of the unbaked muffins along with the topping. Yum!

This a delicious, simple and easy recipe. Like others have mentioned this recipe will make 12 regular sized muffins and highly recommend filling the cups 2/3 or less so that the topping doesn't spill over and make a mess of your oven. Also, instead of half a cup butter, use half a stick of butter. Also, I used evaporated milk simply because I was out of regular milk. Worked great and added a rich flavor.

Great recipe! Makes a wonderful thick batter and delicious hearty muffins. I did make the topping, although I agree with some of the other commenters that the muffins would probably be just as good without.

The flavor of this recipe was amazing! It was so light, fluffy, and moist. TIP: use muffin liners! I only gave it 4 stars because I had to change the measurements and doctor the recipe a little. IDK if it is bc I live in such a dry and high altitude climate, but I had to use 2/3 Cup oil and 2/3 Cup milk and added 2 Tbs of flour. I also used brown sugar instead of white sugar, doubled the cinnamon (because I like alot). I also only used 2 Tbs of butter in the topping.

A pretty good recipe but it does need some tweaking.  I did cut down on the sugar because apples are natually sweet.  They didn't need 3/4 of a cup especially if you plan on using the topping(I did not).  I also added a splash more milk and I was a litle disappointed that the recipe isn't clear about how much apple is needed....2 apples is vague.  I also doubled the cinnamon, added a pinch of nutmeg and allspice for a spicier muffin.  Overall, pretty good, but use your own tastes to modify the recipe.

I made these tonight and was disappointed that most of my topping fell off the muffins even after waiting for them to cool.  The muffins tasted okay, but would have been better with the topping.  Sadly, it was all over the counter instead of ON the muffins.

Great muffin recipe, although I got 18 muffins instead of twelve out of a double batch. Also the topping recipe sounded wacked to me so I used the one from the Apple Streusel Muffin recipe from this site instead. But they were delicious! I could barely stop eating them and all my friends loved them too.

These came out delicious and my house smelling wonderful.  I doubled the recipe and made 3 dozen "normal" sized muffins.  I cut the butter amount in half for the crumble topping and just melted the butter before mixing with the other topping ingredients instead of cutting it in.

This recipe is identical (except for the use of apples and cinnamon)to one called To Die For Blueberry Muffins. It needs to be made in the 6 cup JUMBO type of pan. No Mess!! Also, I have never sprinkled the topping on because the muffins are sweet enough on their own and cake like. Perfect with coffee or tea!! I am going to try this recipe with 1 apple and 1 cup of blueberries. I know it will be great!

Very tasty!  I substituted Sucanat for the white sugar, and creamed butter for the oil.  I also skipped the topping -- they're still awesome.  I disagree with others who said there was too much apple.  I think it's just right!

Easy recipe and tastes very good.  I really like cinnamon so I doubled that and used buttermilk and only 1 apple chopped very fine b/c I dont like alot of apple chunks.  Of course, I didnt fill cups to the top either. I'll use this recipe again.

Took less than 1 hr in the kitchen to complete 6 jumbo muffins with nice topping. Great texture. My hubby was impressed with it. Look like those muffins sold in Starbucks. Minor changes:  1) 1/2 cup sugar instead of 3/4 cup  2) used 50g margarine instead of butter for the topping 3) added 1/3 cup milk initially...find the dough too dry..added abt 3 tablespn more   :)

These muffins were a hit!  I made some changes to the topping like mentioned in some of the other reviews.  However, I think the next time I make them I will just omitt the topping all together.  They also freeze well.

These were pretty good and easy to make.  I omitted the topping, didn't want any extra calories.  i also added a cup of oats to make it even healthier... but then the mix got bulky, so i added more milk until it became moist again. I also added 2 tsp cinnamon instead of 1.  I added a tsp of vanilla esccence to the wet ingredients. I also halfed the sugar amount between white and brown sugar.  This recipe yielded me 15 medium sized cupcakes.

I added buttermilk and lots of extra cinnamon.  I also cinnamon and sugar'd the sides of the muffin tins, a lot of extra work, but very worth it.  I also pan fried the apples a little to make them a little soft so they wouldn't be so crunch. These muffins were delicious and a huge hit with my dad, my 2 year olds and my dad.

Recipe yields 12 muffins, plus some if you have large apples. It will look like the apples are half the batter, but that's fine, because it works great as long as you add a little bit more milk! Fill muffin cups 2/3 full. If you want a true crumble, use one fourth the butter and half the rest of the crumble recipe. If you want a glaze-like, slight crumble, just half the crumble recipe, and it is quite good! I ran out of cinnamon part-way through, and so I know apple pie spice works great too! Don't be shy to add more cinnamon/spice to taste, because it worked great for me! Loved the modified recipe!

I made these into bars, which worked out well.  I recommend using a pastry cutter to make the crumb.  There is far too much butter in the crumb topping.  1/4 cup would have been much better.  I probably won't make this again.

These were very yummy. I made the batter, refrigerated it and baked the muffins in the morning. They turned out beautifully. I opted for cinnamon sugar rather than the topping to save time. It made a sweet, crunchy top without the extra fat. I also added more milk as the batter was dry. I found the recipe easily made 12 muffins rather than 6, which is what the recipe says. A definite "do-over"!

This recipe was very good, but I was worried about the apples being a little crunchy so I fried them in butter, cinnamon and sugar before putting them in the batter. I also substituted applesauce for the oil and left off the topping all together. They were a little dense due to the applesauce, but they tasted oh so good.

I haven't tried these yet, I just popped them in the oven... I wanted to add that when you make the topping, I think it would be better to use oats instead of flour bc the flour and butter mixture made it into a paste that you have to spread onto the uncooked muffins which is difficult.  I followed the advice of one reviewer and cut the butter down to 1/4 cup and still I had a paste.  If I had used oats I would have been able to sprinkle it.  Will update after I eat them, lol.  ** ok that was a bad idea.  The butter melted and a sugary caramel was formed and leaked all over my oven.**

These were pretty good.  I followed the modifications made by "canuwrite", and they turned out great!  One apple was definately enough, and the crumble mix for on top was yummy with less butter.It made 9 regular sized muffins for me.  I think next time I make them I will add more cinnamon and use apple sauce instead of oil for less fat.  Thanks for the good basic recipe, you really can tweak it to what you like.  They are yum! *****UPDATE****  Made these again last night, but substituted half of the oil with unsweetened applesauce.  This reduces the amount of fat in the muffins, and they seemed to be more moist and fluffy.  Delicious!!

They were easy to make, my 8 year old helped and did most of the work.  The tops really did spread a lot, I put a cookie sheet under the muffin tin to catch the overflow--thank goodness.  I only used one apple finely chopped and we all thought they turned out fine.

The basic muffin recipe was fine, although I doubled the cinnamon and it made 12 muffins.  I like a crunchy crumb topping so I mixed 3/4 c. flour, 2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 c. sugar, added 1/4 cup butter (melted) and divided evenly among the muffins.  No more buttery pan!  This recipe is the same as the "To Die for Bluberry Muffins" from this site.

This recipe had a good base but the instructions were not the best. I used only one apple which seemed like it was enough. The recipe must have been for Jumbo muffins because this filled 2 muffin pans. liked it for the most part though. Thanks

I agree with most other reviews - the measurements for this recipe were off; but otherwise, this is a great basic recipe with some changes: I found when I mixed in the milk, egg and oil that the batter was rather dry, so I doubled the milk and that did the trick; I also added nutmeg to the batter to add extra flavour. I did use two apples, even though other reviewers said that was too much, and I found it to be the right amount - although I used relatively small apples. The biggest change I made was to the topping, which I changed to taste more like an apple crumble topping. I mixed about 1 tbsp. of melted butter, 1 tbsp. flour, 2 tbsp. rolled oats, 2 tbsp. brown sugar and 1 tsp. ground cinnamon until it resembled coarse meal. I sprinkled this mixture on top of the muffins, and it turned out really well. Lastly, the recipe yields exactly 12 regular-sized muffins, and I found they only needed 18 minutes in the oven at 400 F. All around a great recipe I will use again.

I really enjoyed this recipe. However, i did alter it by using only 1 apple instead of 2, adding 2 eggs instead of 1, adding cranberries and walnuts, using brown sugar instead of white, and adding 1/2 cup of water in addition to the rest of the ingredients. I also read the other reviews written for this recipe and filled the pan 2/3 instead of filling it to the top. I am very satisfied with the outcome and will use this recipe again. Yum!!

These muffins were wonderful. I did change around a few things. Once I made the batter and I started to add the apples I realized there was more apples than batter. I decided to reduce to using about 1 1/2 apples instead of the two. I also only used half of the topping that's all you need. I  was also able to make 12 muffins and filled the batter half way. These muffins do seem to take longer to make than the estimated time. All in all they were great I just made them today and my boyfriend already had 4!!

These are great. I halfed the recipe so I only had 6 muffins. I didn't put the topping on because I'm going to roll the tops in butter & then dip in the brown sugar, sugar & cinnamon mixture I made. After reading all the reviews I didn't want a mess in my oven & I usually roll other muffins in melted butter & sugar after they are done baking anyway so I thought I'd try it the same way, just using brown sugar, sugar & cinnamon. I didn't add the flour since I wasn't baking the topping in the oven. The muffins rose beautifully & even though I filled the tins almost to the top, there was no mess! I suggest trying adding the topping after they are cooked & cooled to avoid a mess in your oven!

I made four jumbo muffins and four regular size muffins.  I haven't tasted them as I cannot have all the sugar, but my son says they're great.  I had leftover topping.  Next time I will cut back on the apple, and on the butter in the topping like everyone else said.  The jumbo muffins did not over flow, even filling them to the top.  The smaller ones did, but they just ran into the rest of the cups in the pan.
UPDATE:  When I first made these, I left them in a foil muffin pan and popped them in the freezer, intending on giving them as a gift.  Today when I tried to get them out of the muffin tin, I found the butter had flowed down UNDER the paper cup and they were stuck in the tin.  Once they thawed there was butter everywhere.  And now I am quickly making something else as a gift!

I followed the other posters suggestions about using less butter for the crumb topping, using less apple, and filling two third full. They turned out great. The topping really makes the muffing, in my opinion. Also, I added raisins to mine and the tastes really go together. I could imagine these with some chopped walnuts in them for a great dessert muffin. This recipe is definitely worth a try if you like apple and cinnamon.

This was very good. I did adjust the recipe as other reviewers suggested. I used one and a half apples. I did not make the sprinkle topping, I just sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on top. Also, next time I would do 375 degrees instead of 400, because the tops were a little over cooked for my taste.

I read through the reviews that others had written about this recipe and tweaked a few things, and they turned out great! i used part wheat flour and part white, filled the muffin tins up about 3/4 full, and used less better in the topping. I did cut up two whole apples but ended up only using 2/3 of them. They were a little too sweet for my taste, so when I make them again I will cut down the amount of sugar. Very tasty though!

Great recipe. 
Got 12 regular sized muffins. 
I might try it with whole wheat next time, since the apples add so much moisture. Really good!

Pretty good and easy. I would like the muffin itself to be a little more dense to stand up to the streusel, but otherwise, a really good muffin. With a piece of cheddar, it's a perfect snack. Thanks!

This was really good!  I only had 1 apple, but I figured it would be tasty anyway.  I started making it, only to see I didn't have cinnamon, so I used allspice instead.  Not exactly the same flavor, but still good.  I only filled the muffins halfway, and they still spilled over.  Used less butter than called for with the topping, which turned out tasty.  LOVE the topping!  Very crunchy and yummy.  I will be making this again very soon.

I did not care for these muffins. I thought the topping was too greasy.

I got 12 perfect muffins and will make these again, however, I will make changes to the topping.  There was too much butter and I ended up throwing over half of it out.

These were excellent muffins.  One tip though, DO NOT FILL TO THE TOP!!!!
Mine just came out of the oven and they were overflowing and extremely messy!! Second batch was filled 3/4 full and it came out much better.  Both batches were delicious though!! I totally recommend these!

Absolutely Delicious!!!!! I doubled the cinnamon and used 1/4 cup apple sauce and 1/8 oil like other reviews suggested. The topping makes way to much, so make sure you dont use it all. Too much butter on top makes them soggy when they are dont cooking.

These muffins turned out really good!  The only problem that i had was that the topping called for WAY too much butter!  I didn't even use a half cup and it was way too much.  But other than that they turned out great.  I will definatly be making them again!

I used half light brown sugar and half white which turned out very well! i also kept the pieces of apple pretty big because i love the big pieces in there so you can really taste them. Also i used half oil and half apple sauce which was really good.  i liked the topping but there is a lot left over. i thought i would just put extra on the tops but it made the muffins greasy on the bottom...so just put a little of the topping on!! maybe i will use less butter with the topping next time. Other than that they were really yummy! I don't know why the recipe says it makes only six muffins..i got 12 out of this one!

This is an excellent recipe!!! I love it! It's really easy to make (except for the peeling and chopping of the apples part. lol) and also the ingredients are easy to find and readily available in most kitchens.
I followed the recipe exactly but without the streusel toppings and the muffins came out perfect! My whole house was filled with the yummy fragrance and the muffins came out moist, tender and fluffy. Next time i would try reducing the sugar by one tablespoon as the apples were quite sweet. 
Enough said, this is the PERFECT apple cinnamon muffin recipe. Easy and delicious! 

TIP: Melted butter can be used instead of veg oil to make the muffins more fragrant.

Awesome recipe - my boyfriend said they were the best muffins he'd ever tasted. Only changes I made were using 2 teaspoons of cinnamon instead of one and adding a splash of vanilla to the batter. I also found the batter to be kind of dry so I added a bit more milk. I got six big muffins out of this with some batter left over. 
Very moist and delicious...definitely a favourite.

Very tasty muffins, and easy to make. As suggested by other reviewers of this recipe, I used half the amount of vegetable oil and half applesauce. The only con for me was that the muffins didn't rise well and stayed rather flat, although I used enough baking powder.

Veryyy good. Took a little longer than expected from the 'easy' title (because of the apple slicing and making the topping), but totally worth it. It actually took about 30 minutes in my oven. I completely reccomend this recipe, it's great!

These muffins are delicious.  I also substituted 1/2 cup whole wheat flour for the white -- a little more fiber without taking away from the flavor. I would agree with others who said not to fill the muffin cups more than half way.  I filled mine about 2/3 and the topping spilled out all over my oven.  But they were still delicious!

These muffins were great! I used brown sugar instead of white, 7-grain flour instead of all-purpose and margarine and they still tasted delicious. I did however get 18 muffins when I used the measurements for 12.

These are Great! I doubled the recipe using three small apples (granny smith, which I chopped in the food processor) and I think they had a good apple taste. I took them in to work and got a lot of compliments. I used half brown sugar, half white sugar and applesauce instead of oil. They were a little on the spongy side, but really not bad at all. I also ommited the topping and sprinkled some cinnamon and sugar on top just before baking. the outside was crisp and the inside was moist. I will definitely make these again!

Mindy, 
  This was such a good recipe. It filled the house with such wonderful aromas. The taste was out of this world. I did have to make some alterations though. Only because I didnt have enough apples. I used one apple and one ripe pear. As the pear was small I added a little carrot shavings to it. It was a masterpiece. Thank you.

I thought this recipe was excellent.  I used a deep dish stoneware baker, as I had to throw out my rusted muffin pan.  I only increased milk to a little more than 1/3 the amount and it was sooo good.  I dont really like apple cinnamon muffins/bread, but this was outstanding!

My muffins turned out great but I had to add more oil and milk because the batter was too thick.  I also had to add more flour to the topping to make it crumbly.  The yield was twice what it said, but all in all they turned out moist and delicious.

I used this recipe to make mini-muffins for my preschoolers class.  It was yummy and each batch took about 15-18 minutes.  I didn't peel the apples either - it still tasted good.

These were very good muffins with an excellent moistness and texture within.  The only tweaks that I made were to add a little lemon extract and lemon zest to help mask possibly tasting the baking powder, which is a flavor that I am personally very sensitive to.

These muffins are very moist & very tasty.  I will definitely be making them again.  I would also recommend only filling the cups 2/3 full.  I did not have a problem with run off, but the muffin tops all stuck together and had to be cut apart to remove them from the pan.

It has the same taste of my grandma's apple pie. I think butter quantity in crumb should be slightly lowered. Overall, delicious and faboulous crumb!
