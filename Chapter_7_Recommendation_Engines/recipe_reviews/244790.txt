This is quite a bit of work but worth it in the end. One suggestion I have is to dice your bacon. As written it flavors the gravy great but  it  is kind of like a bay leaf that gets discarded in the end. If diced you would still get the flavor and also have pieces of it throughout your finished gravy.

I received a Dutch oven for Christmas and my husband suggested trying this recipe. He normally likes spicy and I'm wimp but I like a lot of flavor. This recipe is wonderful in the flavor department and the chicken was wounderfully moist! Thank you for sharing this recipe. I did add about 1/2 cup more oj and beer. The gravy was delish!

The flavor was fantastic and the chicken was incredible juicy! I used half the chicken and browned it in my cast iron Dutch oven...removed the chicken then added the chopped bacon and onions...etc...then put everything in the pot for baking...saving myself a dirty skillet. I added chopped mushrooms, baby carrots and tiny potatoes. No need to thicken the gravy because I wanted to keep it more a stew. Great hardy meal! Thank you, I will make again!

This was a big hit with my family. I kept on the stove on low and did more of a braise than put in oven. Chicken was tender and very flavorful!

Excellent recipe! This is exactly the kind of gravy I was looking for.  I knew it had to be good if you even know what coq au vin is. I had to change just a couple things. I didn’t have a Dutch oven or any bacon and I had already cooked, de-boned and cut up several leg quarters. I intended to add a can of plain Ro*Tel, but mistakenly used a variety with lime juice and cilantro. I also used more onion and added celery. Cooked it all slowly on the stove top in a big deep pan, and served it over rice. Thanks for sharing it. I’ll definitely be cooking this one again!
