Excellent... My only suggestion is to use heavy cream and a bit more butter. This is excellent paired with coconut rice.

I made the crab meat/sherry variation as the submitter suggested in her recipe description. I simmered the sherry with the stock rather than adding at the end - did not want the "raw" liquor taste.  I think this would have been infinitely better without the curry.  Very dominant and distracting.  Also - too much butter to saute vegetables results in little "grease nodules" floating on the top of the soup. Not pretty.

This was a very good and pretty easy-to-make recipe. It also had an "elegant" feel to it.
I'd never bought chicken stock before, but I managed to find some at my store. I bought some medium-size (51-60 count) shrimp, since the recipe didn't specify a size, and I thought they might be too big for this recipe, but I thought they worked nicely. Also, I wasn't sure if I should have left the tails on (some shrimp recipes do, some don't, and I don't know what the "rules" are), so I took the tails off.
However, I thought the brandy overpowered the other flavors quite a bit. Maybe a higher-quality brandy than what I had on hand would've tasted better, or maybe I should just have reduced the quantity.
In the end, though, this was the first recipe I've added to my recipe box in quite a while. I just may try it again, this time with crab/lobster (and sherry), as the recipe description suggests. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was amazing!!! I didn't have green onions or brandy and I used fat free half and half.  My friend the gourmet cook was here and she raved about it all weekend.  It is quick and easy and definitely a keeper.  Thanks for the recipe.

Oooh, this was good! I roughly chopped up the shrimps for the bisque but garnished it with a huge tiger prawn (tiger shrimp? Not sure of the difference). I diced the onion a little chunkier than the celery, and used a small splash of Marsala wine instead of brandy. The green onion sprinkles were pretty, but next time I think I'll use fresh chives. This was super delicious. Thanks so much!

Sorry to say, but I did NOT like the brandy in this one.  Way too overpowering.  I would make it again, but probably completely omit the brandy.  (And, yes! I am a drinker!)

This was a very good recipe.  I didn't use the brandy and instead used cooking sherry before the flour.  I used heavy whipping cream instead of the light cream.  I also added a pinch of garam masala and garlic salt in the end to each serving because it needed a little something.  Next time I will use only half the celery and substitute the green onions with fresh cilantro to give it a more authentic taste.  Also, I think I will use a little more tomato paste.  All very minor tweaks that made this good recipe great!

Interesting flavor combination. A little salty for my tastes. But overall a great soup alternative from the standards.

Very good recipe....the only change I made was that I used heavy cream as opposed to light cream.  I think I wouldve given this five stars if the shrimp I bought tasted better....it tasted kind of fishy, but all in all, I'd definitely recommend this recipe...can't blame the recipe creator when I'm buying the Kroger brand of shrimp :)

This was a simple and amazing soup.  My entire family loved it.  I didn't have any brandy but put a few tablespoons of bourbon in at the end of cooking.  I also added a sprinkle of cayenne to kick up the heat.  It was FABULOUS!  I have made it again and it is a permanent addition to the recipe box.

A little bland, adding a little more paprika next time. Also, used Greek yogurt instead of the cream and 1 cup less chicken broth and it was thicker. It was very good though.

It's on our favorites list! Like some other reviewers I left out the brandy, 'cause I don't have any!  I cut the shrimp in the soup into spoon-sized portions.  I also used half and half instead of light cream, and omitted the green onions since my hubby doesn't like them.  The whole family including the picky 9 year old liked this one.  Thanks!

I had to make a few substitutions due to a few food intolerance issues (dairy and gluten). I used olive oil in place of the butter, cornstarch for the flour and coconut milk for the cream. As so many have said that the brandy is overpowering, I also used cooking sherry. I didn't really like to flavors on this, perhaps because I couldn't really make a proper roux without butter and flour. Unfortunately, I will not be making this again.

Yummy! I left out the brandy since I didn't have it. Used a hand blender to coarsly chop the shrimp. Didn't have the light cream so used light coconut milk. Has really good flavor still. I added some brown rice to the bowl too. Will make again since its so easy and tasty.

Good recipe. This was a tasty soup and liked by all 4 adults trying it. I omitted the brandy and green onions b/c I didn't have any. I liked the curry in it.  It is not as good as I've had at most restaurants though. I prefer a thicker and creamier bisque. I will definitely make this again using vegetable or fish stock and adding heavy cream instead. I will also try it with the brandy and green onions.

This is a fabulous starter recipe.  I wanted more of a Thai flavor, so I used coconut milk in place of the cream, and added chopped cashews, cilantro, and a some fresh minced ginger.

***** I'd give this recipe 10 stars if I could!  It was absolutely fantastic.  I can honestly say that this was better than anything I have gotten in a fine restaurant.  The curry is mild, so don't let that ingredient scare you away.  And you truly do need the brandy to give it that special 'oomph.  I topped my bowls with chopped chives fresh from my herb garden.  I highly recommend this bisque!

This was so delicious! I will definitely make this again. The only thing I substituted was the curry for cayenne pepper. I didn't have any curry, but next time will try with curry. For a creamy and delicious bisque...TRY THIS!!!

This turned out really good!! I chopped the shrimp to ensure a piece in every spoonfull! It got 5 stars at our house! (I also sneaked in a hint of cayenne pepper for a little kick). I skipped the brandy.

The ONLY change i made to this recipe - added 2 ounces of cooking sherry instead of brandy. (I don't understand how a person can rate a recipe after they changed the entire thing...and then only give it one star!) This bisque is AMAZING! Thanks for a great recipe!

A terrific soup -- fairly quick and easy to prep, almost impossible to go wrong.  And very tasty.  I often tinker with recipes but followed this to the letter -- didn't have any cognac handy, and didn't miss it. Another reviewer used coconut milk and I'm sure that would be a nice touch.  Suggest using small shrimp, or rough-chop larger shrimp into bite-size pieces. I'm gonna try this with lobster, too.  This is a great "starter," but we had it as a main course with a side salad and hot fresh bread.  This one goes in our "favorites" file, eager to try it on company.

I'm giving this recipe a 5 star rating because it is truly fantastic for how simple it is. I chopped the veggies very small and added roughly chopped portabella mushrooms. I kept everything else the same except did not add brandy. Next time I will try it with coconut milk instead of the cream. Overall, it's superb!

We loved this! It is rich and delicious. I used whipping cream and cream sherry and let it simmer for about 30 minutes. I also cut up the shrimp so you get a little with most bites.

I made this for my boyfriend because he loves dishes with curry. I switched the chick stock to vegetable stock, since I am a vegetarian. I also omitted the brandy and put more paprika to make it extra spicy. He liked it a lot, and keeps asking me to make it again.

Delicious!  Instead of cooking with chicken stock, I boiled the raw shrimp in 3 1/2 cups of water with 2 chicken bouillon cubes.  After the shrimp was cooked, I added that stock to the paste mixture.  Turned out awesome!  I also omitted the brandy.

YUM! We were trying to recreate a soup we had at a Kauai restaurant a couple of years ago. This came pretty dang close! I used heavy cream and frozen shrimp, and it was delicious. Just for grins next time I might play around with different curries, and try a seafood stock instead of chicken stock. This could be a meal in itself, it was so filling.

Not a bad recipe, but "chicken stock" wouldn't be my preference.  HOWEVER - this is perfect for the home armature, but I would learn how to make homemade stocks.  Get fresh unpealed shrimp, cook and strain water into another pot.  Use that water and cook veggies in it.  Then proceed with recipe.  No chicken.

My sister and I made this for dinner one night and we were so blown away by the taste, amazing! Besides adding the shrimp we also added crab meat and chives which made it a delicious seafood soup. I will definitely make this again!

This wasn't quite 3*s nor was it 4*s but I gave it four because maybe my substitutions affected the outcome. I cut the recipe in half & I'm out of celery so I subbed a tsp of celery seed for flavor. I'm also out of broth so I made some w/ chicken base & I'm out of tomato paste so I subbed tomato sauce. If I were to make it again, I would decrease the curry & paprika some. I added the brandy when I added the stock so that it could simmer some & I used fat-free half & half. Was trying to make it healthier but it needs heavy cream to add richness to the broth. I almost pureed this but in the end decided not to. I didn't have any green onions so I used garlic chives as a garnish. Thsi was allright but I'm not sure I'll make it again...it just didn't wow us.  Thansk for letting me try it  Jayda!

This was excellent!!! I increased the curry powder, shrimp and added cayenne pepper for a kick. Also used coconut milk instead of cream. There was not a drop leftover this was such a hit! Also omitted the booze and drank my wine on the side instead. Enjoy!!

My hubby and I thought this recipe was okay. I made a few additions/substitutions on it. Omitted the celery and brandy. I added: bean sprouts, diced red bell pepper, cooked chicken (cut in small chunks) and some coconut milk. I also added more curry powder and paprika. I also used heavy cream. I used baby shrimp, instead of cutting up the bigger shrimps, which was a time saver. I thought this was good, but still wasn't quite what I would like it to be. We have a local Thai place and I couldn't help compare this recipe to theirs. I wished this was a bit more spicy. We put it over jasmine rice and there was plenty of juice.

I would use less curry powder next time, that was a little overwhelming.  I did use fat free half and half, and couldn't tell.  I also omitted the brandy.

This was a good soup, and I'm sure it would have been good as it is stated, but it gave me a basis to go by.  I used a little frozen tomato instead of the paste, milk instead of light cream and cooked my shrimp in a separate pan with a little bit of garlic and paprika and then deglazed the pan with a splash of apricot brandy and a little white wine instead of the brandy it calls for in the recipe.  I had to thicken the soup a little more because of my changes, but it was very good.  My 20 month old even scraped her bowl clean.  I would just be careful with the salt and add it at the end once you've tasted it first.

I wasn't quite satisfied with the end result, but when I added 4 tablespoons of Chalula (hot sauce) the taste was much improved.  I didn't use the brandy, by the way.

We really liked this at our house.  I left out the brady because we don't drink and used coconut milk in place of the cream for our dairy allergic child.  He's 18 months and loved it.  We had to stop feeding it to him for fear of what might happen later with the spice and all.  I served it with coconut rice and it was a hit. Thanks!

The way I made it should actually be rated 3 stars, I left out the flour because I'm doing low carb. It seemed to be missing something else, though. If I make it again, I would puree some of it and maybe add some cream cheese and/or sour cream to give it a little 'tang'.  Or maybe a little bit of coconut milk.  I did enjoy the brandy, though.

Fabulous! I was out of light cream so I substituted with heavy cream. Otherwise, I followed the directions completely. I may try a tad more curry next time--not because this is at all bland but because I LOVE spicy foods. This one is definitely a keeper!

I've made this several times for different people and it's always a hit!!  This last time, I skipped the cream and added some cornflour mixed with cold water, potatoes, and mushrooms...this made a very thick base so I had it as a main curry dish.  It was excellent!  Thanks so much fot the recipe!!

If you like curry, you should love this recipe - it was great!  Before adding the shrimp, I blended it.  I used 1C heavy cream and chopped the shrimp up fine before adding.  Next time I will increase butter to 4Tbl to help absorb the flour mix.  This will become one of my favorites and very easy to make.

Delicious but not quite as thick as we like.  Next time I think I'll back off the chicken stock.  It's definitely worth making again, though, and the flavor was spot on!!

I added a few extra touches to it, such as thyme, bay leaf and Tony Chachere's. I also made a dark roux, which bumped up the flavor a notch. I substituted a cup of heavy whipping cream for the half-n-half, that smoothed out the spicy tingle.

Very easy to make and tasty. I added more Sherry and 1 more clove of garlic. Also, recommend  sauté ing the shrimp in butter and garlic before adding to soup to make them more flavorful.

I used heavy cream as another user suggested. I also added the brandy earlier in the process as I wanted to cook off the alcohol (feeding a pregnant lady). I added 1/4 teaspoon of a ‘ghost curry powder’ that gave it a little more kick. All in all, great recipe.

It was excellent. Everyone loved it. Substituted the Brandy with sherry and cooked it into the bisque.

Excellent!! The entire family loved it!! Used homemade shrimp stock instead of chicken stock, coconut milk rather than cream and sherry rather than brandy. Definite keeper! Very rich restaurant quality bisque.

If I could rate this recipe higher I would. It was absolutely restaurant quality!

Only two substitutions - heavy cream rather than light, and rum instead of brandy, only because we didn't have brandy on hand.

For the person who complained about globules of fat floating, you can fix that by putting in the flour as the recipe instructs, mixing the flour with the butter until the butter is absorbed (I won't call it a roux, as that requires a much longer period to cook), then continuing on with the recipe, adding in the other ingredients as called for.

This is definitely on our rotation - simple, elegant, and delicious.

Great recipe! I omitted the brandy/sherry (because I didn't have any and many people said to omit it), used heavy whipping cream, and added imitation crab and octopus pieces. I also served with rice and  broccoli :D

My wife makes this and I have to say everyone loves it. instead of using crab meat she uses crayfish along with shrimp and it turns out wonderful. 
Everyone keeps asking when she is making it again.

We substituted the  Curry with Old Bay seasoning and used Sherry instead of the  Brandy.  We also doubled the amount of shrimp and served it with rice. And, we took the advice of others who posted and we used heavy cream.  It was outstanding!!!!!  we will definitely make this again.

Great recipe! Wish I would have made a bigger pot! Added heavy cream and milk mixture because I didn't have light cream. Also added more curry powder because I love curry! Will definitely make this again but will double the recipe!
