Robust, diverse flavor with a nice tangy finish. I've made it twice already in two days and will make it again soon!
Havarti cheese works as well with some basil sprinkled on top.

I prepared ahead of time to take to deer camp.  Cooked them in foil.  Probably should have opened the foil to allow the bacon to crisp up a bit, but had limited space.  Had great flavor and the presentation was beautiful.

Didn't turn out -- bacon didnt get crisp quick enough -- i overdid the asparagus, cheese, and tomatoes. I had doubled the recipe, so maybe that's part of what went wrong... but it really didn't turn
