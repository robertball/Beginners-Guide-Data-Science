Four stars - five for the ease of preparation but lowered the rating b/c of the lack of specification of barbeque sauce.  I used a hickory brown sugar barbecue sauce and it was too sweet.  This could be a personal problem and not the fault of the recipe but it would be of benefit to know what brand/flavour b/c not all barbeque sauces taste alike.

Target makes a "Raspberry Chipotle Grilling Sauce" by Archer Farms that is fantastic to use on salmon.  I brushed some minced garlic, salt and pepper on the salmon.  Used 1/2 cup of the grilling sauce and baked according to recipe directions.  YUMMY!

SO yummy!  The flavor is to die for.  We're having it again tomorrow!  Add a little garlic and cayenne for some extra savory in the sweet!

This salmon recipe was tasty & special looking. I used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ Sauce & Trappist Preserves Red Seedless Raspberry Jam. I also added two drops of liquid smoke & a sprinkle each of onion powder, salt, pepper. It smelled good while baking, and the glaze was pretty & only tasted slightly sweet, nice & fresh actually. Couldn't have been easier to prepare, & it was ready to be plated alongside lentils & sautéed spinach, didn't need fresh lemon or any further condiments. YUM! Try this! 
Next time I'd like to try a variation, perhaps apricot preserves/jam with a hickory BBQ sauce, etc.

So good and so easy!  My family loved it.  They thought it was so much more fancy than it really was.  I only baked it for 15 minutes though so 35 would've been overkill.

My FIL gave me a slab of salmon and homemade apricot preserves (I know we should all have such problems), but my question was how should I prepare the salmon? And being a new mom, I wanted something fairly simple. This fit the bill perfectly...three ingredients I couldn't ask for more. I used Wildtree Peachy Keen BBQ sauce and my apricot preserves to smother the salmon and it was a hit. The only additional thing I did was to season the salmon with salt and pepper before placing the BBQ mixture on top, just wanted to balance the sweet and savory. Thank you cookntaste for posting this recipe!

I was looking for a last minute way to prepare my salmon filets and found this recipe. It was great! And so quick to make. I used strawberry Polaner All Fruit jelly instead of raspberry, since that's what I had on hand and it turned out very yummy. I'd like to try the raspberry next time. The sauce made enough for 4 salmon filets. My 2 yr old gobbled this up!

Awesome recipe.  A few things: 1. You don't need to cook it for 40 min for a salmon fillet. 2. Add ginger and some soy sauce to give it the necessary zing.

Tonight was the second night I've made this. Loved it both times. I did alter it a bit by rubbing thyme on both sides (it was skinless) I then let it marinate a few hours in the BBQ sauce (didn't have the raspberry jam) and since there was no skin, I put some onions under the salmon when I cooked it. Left it in for 30 mins and it was perfect. Hubby and I will oth add this to our food menus!

We did this on our gas grill, just quickly add some grill marks to the flesh side and then put in a foil lined pan over indirect heat at 400°. Was very simple and tasty enough for a quick last minute way too cook salmon, but only took 25 minutes till flaking and done. A little minced garlic takes it up a notch.

A big FIVE from hubs.  He absolutely loved it.  I used seedless blackberry jam because I had it and Jack Daniels Original BBQ sauce.  20 minutes at 400 was perfect in my oven.  I think you could make this with any jam or preserves you like.  In fact the photo looks like the photographer used apricot or peach jam.

This was a great change to cooking salmon. My daughter and son-in-law loved it. The salmon came out looking so pretty I hated to put it on a plate to eat it. Definitely makes the recipe box for a return performance. Thanks for sharing

Great title!! I LOVE the taste of salmon, you do not need too much to make it taste FAB, this sauce is all that is required! I only had orange marmalade so that's what I used, along with a few tablespoons of Sriracha sauce. Excellent 10 stars, I served it with cottage fries. Thank you Cookntaste

This is actually quite good. I opted to use a regular bbq sauce (as no specific type was asked for) and used a reduced-calorie/reduced-sugar strawberry-rhubarb jam in place of the seedless raspberry. Had the fiance make this, and he used all the glaze mixture instead of putting on some then more halfway through but it worked out fine. Served this with "Rice with Herbes de Provence" and "Spinach Saute" from AR.

This was good, but I wasn't blown away. I did us a rather heavy BBQ sauce, which may have overpowered the jam too much.  It's worth trying again with a lighter sauce.

This was delicious! I'm not much of a fish lover, but I ate all my fish before my pasta or broccoli! Great way to get kids to eat fish. I didn't have any raspberry jam so I used strawberry rhubarb. I will try raspberry  the next time. Thanks for the quick and easy recipe!

This is a nice simple recipe that deserves to be tweaked for personal taste. Given all the different BBQ sauces available, it would be interesting to know what different cooks used. I used "Sweet Baby Ray's" original BBQ sauce and Smucker's seedless red raspberry jam. It was good, but a little too sweet for my palate. Next time, I'll definitely add some heat by using a dash of cayenne, some ground ginger, or a hot sauce.  It might be great substituting the BBQ sauce altogether, with an Asian Kung Pao sauce. Also, (as some have suggested), a 40 minute bake time is too long. Mine was done, (flaked), in about half that.

I would rate this higher because the sauce is great, but 400 degrees for 35-40 minutes is too much. That amount of time might work at 350. Mine came out dry and overcooked with the time and temp combination.

This turned out great.  I only baked it for 20 minutes, after reading other reviews, and it was definitely long enough.

Really can't get any easier! Cooking time is definitely off. I only cooked mine for 25 minutes.  It was amazing! Added garlic powder and cayenne pepper to the salmon before putting the sauce on the top!

for diabetics go easy on the sweetness , it threw me a curve ball and was right sleepy afterwards but will make it again using fresh preserves made from fresh berries and stevia sweetener, just the right amt for the bbq taste,  I think a link a little minced onion  and/or garlic buds would be good too. not a fan of soba, use egg noodles or other thin pasta, or even a good quality rice like basmati

We had a cherry barbeque sauce and some cherry/blueberry preserves for the salmon (it's cherry season!).   Added one crushed clove of garlic and the salmon was perfect.

Loved the bbq jam mix never would've thought of it. I used original bulls eye and it turned out great. I had trout instead though so cook time was around 10 minutes.

I made this recipe as written, but it wasn't well-liked in my family. I used Sweet Baby Ray's original barbeque sauce, and Simply Fruit raspberry jam, and overall it was much too sweet. Perhaps with different brands of bbq sauce and jam it would be better. I don't think I'll make it again.

I am definitely making it again.  As a matter of fact, I'm making it tonight.  I am surrounded by fussy eaters and they were rather suspicious at first, but they asked when I would be making it again and could I add more sauce.  I don't know who thought this up, but thank you whoever you are!

Very easy to make and tasty. My children and husband enjoyed this dish. It was different from any salmon we've every tasted, but delicious. I did not cook the salmon for the amount of time listed here though.

I used a honey barbecue sauce and a seeded raspberry jam,  I doubled the sauce than was called for  and and let the fish marinade in it, and added a bit of water so the fish was nearly completely covered in a pan of sauce , than with the sauce I had left over I added a pot of fresh raspberries and lightly mashed. I used the sauce for the pan to cover the fish twice and five mins before it was coined added the mashed raspberries sauce, it was excellent served with a berry nut goat cheese vinaigrette salad on a bed of instant lemon rice.

Family enjoed it. My BBQ sauce was a chipotle variety, so I used a little more jam than BBQ sauce, but that was just personal preference. Cooking time WILL vary depending on the thickness of your salmon. Watch carefully and do not overcook. Delicious, thank you!

This salmon dish was pretty easy to prepare.  Following the directions,I had just the right amount of sauce to coat the fish. It had a very good taste. I would make it again. A tossed green salad with the fish was just the right call for this meal. Baking time depends on the size of your fillets.

This was a great way to have salmon.  I used my cast iron pan in the oven, added garlic and cayenne as suggested-baked at 375 for 25 minutes. We will have this again.

Easy and really tasty. Used Fresh n Easy Chipotle BBQ sauce (which has some kick to it) and black raspberry seedless jam. Cooked at 350 for about 25 minutes, but I had thin filets. This recipe is not necessarily for someone who wants to taste the salmon flavor, but it has a surprisingly good flavor of its own.

Absolutely amazed me that just adding two ingredients completely changed the taste of a whole meal; And they were only added to the salmon! I used a sweet and spicy kind of BBQ sauce with the jam. Worked wonderfully. Wife didn't seem to enjoy it nearly as much as I did but she agreed that it was very good. Was served with white rice and corn.

Not good at all. 400 degrees is a little to much and 35-40 minutes is way too long! Didn't taste good at all, was over done. The only good thing about this recipe is that it was easy to make.

this is so easy and comes out GREAT.  I put it under the broiler the last few minutes to give it a grilled taste.  Thank you for this recipe!!!

Very unique take on salmon, although I did not cook it for 40 minutes (20 was just fine.) My husband and I enjoyed the flavor and I would definitely make it again.

I made this for dinner tonight.  It was AWESOME!!  I had strawberry rhubarb jam and Carolina barbeque sauce (vinegar based), so that's what I used.  It was absolutely to die for!  It only took about 20 miniutes to bake.  This is my new favorite salmon recipe!!

I believe that when it comes to Salmon simple is better.
This recipe was simple and the Salmon was moist and delicious.
