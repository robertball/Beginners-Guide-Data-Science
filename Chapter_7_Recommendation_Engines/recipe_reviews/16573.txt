I like the flavor of the coating!  I do have one suggestion.  I tried applying the coating the way the recipe calls for (just dip in egg then coating), and also the way I learned in culinary school (dip in flour, then egg, then coating).  The latter method was much better the chicken was crispier and much juicier.  I will probably make again - thanks!

This is better than the fried chicken from this site's Hall of Fame fried chicken recipe.  The crust was thick; it stuck too the chicken and browned beautifully.  I added extra spices like recommended by other reviewers: 1T seasoned salt (probably any salted spice would work that had paprika and spices), 1T of garlic powder and several variety of crackers (I didn't have any saltines).  Taste the coating, if it is pungent then it probably won't fade.  I used 2 eggs and probably 10 skinless boneless breasts.  I pounded the breasts in a plastic ziplock bag with a little water so they cooked more quickly.  I think one of the KEYS is to keep the oil hot like the recipe states, then turn it down.  Every time I added new cold pieces of chicken I would turn the flame up to high, get the oil rolling then turn it down to 3.  Also cook the chicken to a dark brown, not light golden brown.  Fried chicken is not a quick and easy thing to do so I would recommend doubling this recipe because this chicken is great the next day cold.  I always double the size of my recipes, so if you too want some good recipes that are for a large family look to my other reviews.

Yum! In case you are wondering, a regular box of saltine crackers has approximately 36 crackers in a sleeve. I put all 36 crackers from the sleeve into my food processor and ground them fine. I added this, the flakes, flour, 1 T of seasoning salt, 1 tsp of pepper, 1 tsp of parsley, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp paprika. I pounded the chicken breasts between two pieces of wax paper on my cutting board, dredged the chicken in 2 beaten eggs and then coated them with the cracker mixture. I placed them in a 13x9 glass dish and baked for 45 minutes. I then melted one stick of butter and poured over the chicken breasts and baked for an additional 5 minutes. We like our chicken extra done. This had a great taste and texture without the bad for you frying! Thank you. Note: This chicken tastes delicious leftover cold the next day!!

Fabulous! I can't stand it when people complain about "lacking flavor" with recipes such as this; common sense would tell me that not everyone's idea of "flavor" is the same and if it's "lacking flavor" then do something about it... salt, pepper, hot sauce, etc. I don't think it's right to give something a low rating just because it isn't EXACTLY how one person expects it to be... sorry, I just HAD to finally say something! LOL. I used all the ingredients called for and as per one user's suggestion about NOT turning frequently, I took their advice and let the chicken cook for a full 5 or 6 minutes before turning over. I then flipped the chicken and cooked for another 5 or 6 minutes and then continued to flip the chicken over for another 3 minutes on each side. The end result was juicy and evenly coated chicken that turned out to be the best tasting chicken I've ever had. My entire family is now in love with the taste and I definitely look forward to making time and time again! Aside from the great taste, I thoroughly enjoyed the mess-free factor of using the ziploc bag to do all the coating and the crackers of course were so much easier to deal with than just a basic flour coating. I think at some point in the future I will perhaps try adding a bit of a ranch powder packet in with the rest of the coating mix. This is definitely a 5 star recipe that I highly recommend trying! **Note, I used thinly sliced chicken tender type slices**

Great recipe. I like my chicken thin- so the secret of pounding the chicken breast is to take a plastic bag-(gallon sized is good )& sprinkle the inside with a little water. Then place the chicken breast inside & close the seal & then you can use a mallet to pound it down with no mess. Works like a charm!

Whoa, there Nellie!  This is GREAT!!!!  Had CFC from the local Chili's and looked for a recipe on this website and honestly...it's just as good.  You do need to add a little more seasoning to the flour/crax mixture though.  I added another couple of tblspoons of potato flakes, tripled the seasoning salt, added garlic powder and a tad bit of poultry seasoning.  Have made this twice in three nights (per boyfriend's request!).  First time, really pounded down the chicken - cooked very quickly and was really good.  Didn't pound chicken quite so thin second time and it was more juicy, although definitely need to turn it over several times while cooking.  Play around with the spices....don't leave the potato flakes, crackers or flour out...it makes a very tasty, crunchy crust!  Will add to my "favorites!"

I don't think this chicken could be any better. Another reviewer compared this to Chili's chicken fried chicken -- no way-- this is better! I made it for a dinner party tonight and was so proud of it. Everyone raved about the chicken, and one person left with the recipe.
I pounded the chicken thin the night before and seasoned it with seasoned salt before soaking it in buttermilk overnight (makes it really juicy).
I didn't think the breading was enough so I added another half sleeve of crackers, more potato flakes, lots more seasoned salt, garlic powder, and pepper. Good thing I did-- I had just enough.
Great served with garlic smashed potatoes and green beans.

This recipe is amazing!!!  I made it last night for dinner and my husband said "ummmm----" with just about every bite.  I used cracker meal sold in the store near the shake and bake.  It is a box full of crushed crackers, so that helped me save on prep time.  I had two zip lock bags, one with flour and seasoning and one with the mixture of cracker meal, potatoe flakes and seasoning.  I just kind of eye-balled it, but I used enough flour and cracker/potatoe mixture to completely coat the chicken.  The chicken breast I used were thick, so I sliced them down the middle to butterfly them and beat them like some people recommended until they were thin.  (The only thing I could think to beat it with was the back of a cookie scooper, since I don't own a meat mallet.) I was surprised that the chicken coating stayed in tack.  The secret is the order that you use to bread the chicken as stated by a few members.  1. Cover in flour 2. Cover in egg 3. Cover in cracker meal/potatoe flakes.  It was absolutely delicious.  Thank you very much for sharing!

Excellent.  I used skinless on the bone chicken.  I had already made the coating when I realized I did not have eggs to coat the chicken so I used RANCH.  The chicken turned out wonderful.  The coating stuck so well you would have thought the chicken had skin. Very tender meat. I will make again and again, my kids and husband loved this...said it was their favorite.  We are health freaks so I liked that this used very little oil.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I enjoyed this and used the other suggestions from various postings of adding seasonings (garlic powder, seasoned salt, parsley, a dash of red peppers, more ground pepper, etc.)  I thought that it was pretty easy and found that if I heated up the oil really good, first and then turned it down (as it states in the recipe) that really worked out well.  The only thing I would change in the recipe is that I think it says to "continuously turn the chicken."  I let the chicken cook/fry on one side (I was using an old skillet) for a really long time (about 20 min. on one side) which gave the breaded part time to actually fry right to the chicken and didn't fall off as easily as if I were continuously turning it.  It got VERY crispy too.

The only problem was we don't have a deep fryer but a really old medium sized skillet, so it took a really long time to finish the actual frying (probably over an hour.)  Our fault, not the recipe's.

I would definitely make this again, though.

Thanks!

People, don't do skinless, boneless. That is another way to say 'tasteless and dry'. Use cut up pieces, with bone and skin. Season it lightly first with salt and pepper. Then do this: 

In bowl, put 2 cups flour and add 1tsp salt, 1tsp garlic powder, 1tsp pepper. 

In another bowl, beat 3 eggs, 1/3 cup milk and 1/3 cup water. 

In a third bowl, put 2-3 cups panko or seasoned/unseasoned bread crumbs.

In large deep skillet, heat 1 cup oil till hot. 
Dip chicken in flour, then egg, then crumbs. Let sit for 3-5 minutes.

Add to skillet - don't crowd. Careful, not too hot-keep heat medium high. Season crumb coating lightly with pepper, garlic powder and little bit of paprika. Cook 5 minutes - till golden, turn over and cook another 5 minutes. Now the trick. Remove all chicken (not fully cooked) - to cookie sheet. Put in oven set at 350. Bake for 30 minutes. Remove and let sit for few minutes. This process gives the good fried taste, but doesnt cook it too long so it doesnt burn or dry out - it stays very moist. Bon apetite!!

I am not really rating the recipe, but just adding a suugestion as to pounding chicken breasts or anything else you want to pound out thinner. Save the inner liner from whatever cereal you might eat and use those to pound stuff thin in. They are much tougher than plastic wrap, waxed paper or just about anything else you might use.

I added some extra seasonings, a little extra seasoning salt, garlic powder and paprika. My 8 year old who is only 50 pounds and is a REALLY small eater ate 2  whole chicken breasts and my 2 1/2 yr old ate 1 whole one. Rarely do I see them dig into dinner with such gusto. This will go in the recipe book for future generations for sure!  For all who said their meat was tough... pound your chicken breasts out first. As a general rule of thumb always expect them to be tough unless you pound them, you have to break down the membranes that make them tough. And if you batter is falling off in cooking its because you did not dredge your meat in flour before dipping in the egg. If you want any batter to stick to anything ever insert that step into every recipe you batter. If it burns, your cooking it with your oil at to high of a temp, it takes just as much practice to fry chicken as it did at 16 learning to parallel park, if its brown and still not cooked just toss it in the oven at 300-325 to finish, a low heat will keep it moist and allow it to cook through which is probably safer and easier if your using bone in anyways, I petrified of serving raw chicken so I almost always throw whatever chicken I'm making the oven at 300 for a little while and have NEVER over cooked since the heat is low.

Here's a hint for everyone who likes their chicken super crispy. I used 20 saltine crackers and added one cup of Panko breadcrumbs to it. I added 1 teaspoon of the following spices to the recipe: garlic powder, onion powder, paprika. I also increased the black pepper to 1 teaspoon and added 2 teaspoons of seasoning salt instead of one. I also added 3 tablespoons of potato flakes instead of 2. Added all of this to a zip lock bag. it covered about 3 pounds of chicken tenderloins which is what I used. NOW HERE'S A GREAT TIP. once I ran the chicken through the egg and added it to the breading I really pressed the  breading hard onto the chicken. When you pull the chicken out of the bag you want it coated very well. Now here's the tip. Place all of the coated chicken in the refrigerator for 3-4 hours (preferably overnight). This allows the breading to adhere to the chicken so when you cook it the breading stays on the chicken and not in the pan. When you are ready to cook take the chicken out of the fridge about 1 hour before cooking. I deep fried my tenders (oil was at 350 degrees) and they took about 6-8 minutes a batch. Don't over crowd the fryer. I put in like 6-8 pieces per batch depending on size of the loin. i cooked them to a nice deep golden brown. I cooked about 30 tenderloins and the amount of breading left in the deep fryer was less than a teaspoon. Refrigerating the chicken really made a difference. Hope this helps. Great recipe!!

Fried chicken is an artform, and I have not been blessed in this department! So I spared my family and baked this instead. I placed 2 metal cooling racks in the bottom of a shallow roasting pan so the bottoms of the chicken wouldn't get soggy. Baked at 375 for about an hour, uncovered.  Was moist and crunchy, and had lots of flavor.

I made this last night for my family and we all loved it.  My son went back for seconds. I would have but was too full. I did make one small change. I only added one small step to the breading process which is to have another bowl with 1/2 c. flour seasoned with a little season salt. I dredged the chicken in the flour really well and then shook off and excess, then the egg and last the cracker crumbs. I learned from watching Food Network that the flour helps the egg  stick to the chicken which in turn helps the breading stick to the chicken. It works. I served the chicken with mashed potatoes and country cream gravy over both and green beans and biscuits. What a great country meal!!  This was soooo good and a definite keeper! Thank for the recipe!

Changed this up just a little, added cajun seasoning and garlic powder (as suggested in other reviews).  Then baked in the oven for about 40minutes, 5 minutes before baking complete drizzled melted butter over.  Beautiful

This chicken is fabulous. Such a tasty breading! For extra oomph I added a little curry and cumin to the breading mixture.

Call it beginners luck with this recipe, but mine turned out picture perfect and tasted great the first go round.  The only tweaking I did was to add 1 t. garlic powder and ground red pepper (to add a little kick).  It was a little salty for our taste so I think I would leave out the seasoned salt next time and just go with some kind of salt free seasoning such as Mrs. Dash.  I also used the zip loc bag suggestion and dredging it in a light coating of flour before dipping it in the egg.  Thanks Cassjw for a great recipe and others for your helpful suggestions!

WOW! This was the best chicken recipe I have ever tried. My husband and kids loved it. I remember saying there is no way we are gonna use up a box of crackers!! Boy was I wrong. It was requested so often that I didn't have to worry about wasted crackers! I agree with others in that more seasoning is needed so I added seasoned salt and garlic powder to the chicken before breading - never-the-less, this is an EXCELLENT recipe! I will recommend to ALL of my friends and co-workers!

I gave this five stars even though I didn't like it the way it was written.  When I used saltines and potato flakes, the coating came out soggy and I over fried it as other have suggested.  I DID however, do it again using cheese cracker crumbs  and Panko crumbs and it was amazing!  Almost as good as my everything chicken when I use Panko, garlic powder, sesame seeds, French fried onions and Italian seasoning!

Very easy. Very good. Next time I will add more spices so it has a little more flavour. I cooked in frying pan until golden brown then baked in the oven for about 10 minutes until chicken was ready. It is simple to adapt to how spicey you like

Nice crunchy crust which I love, but it
definitely needs more spices. To make the coating stick even better, first dip breasts in flour and shake off excess.  Then dip in egg and cracker crumb mixture and press it in.  Flattening the breasts or cutting in smaller strips is a good idea and saves on frying time.

I did as another reviewer suggested and dipped the chicken in flour, then egg, then the bread crumb mixture, and then fried it in a skillet with oil until brown. It turned out perfect (and I've never made fried chicken before)! I'll make this again for sure!

Yum-O! I will never buy frozen chicken strips again! I only had Ritz crackers on hand, and they gave such a smooth crunchiness to it, it's hard to explain. Experiement with seasoning, it's all a matter of preference. I used salt, pepper, garlic powder, and Lowry's. Dredge in flour first; it helps the egg cling to the meat.

I use this to make homemade chicken tenders for the kids.  I love how crispy they turn out, I don't fry them, I just bake them in a 350 degree over for 20-25 minutes.

First off, use 2 pounds of chicken for the same amount off coating, or halve the coating and use 1 pound chicken. I also dipped in flour, then egg, then coating. For my first batch I fileted the chicken in half, and for my second batch I kept it whole.The second batch was much better. It was more tender and crispier. For cooking I only turned once. For flavor I used roasted garlic potato flakes (plus you can use the rest as a side dish). Overall, it was very tasty.

We loved this chicken! I did add garlic powder and paprika though. Also, a little extra seasoning salt. Not bland at all for our tastes. :) Thanks for sharing!

I have a wonderful recipe for "Party Mashed Potatos" that uses a box of instant potatos, so I would be glad to share it if anyone is interested.  They would go wonderfully with this chicken and are very easy to make.  These potatos and chicken and noodles are always requested by friends and family when a get together is called for!  Since you have to buy the potatos for the chicken and use so little, these potatos would be a great addition!

Cracker crumbs work great, and I add onion powder, paprika, & garlic powder as well.  Dipping chicken (I use thighs & breasts) in flour before egg helps keep coating on.  I use more oil (1/2 cup) so it's almost deep-fried;  once each side is somewhat browned, I turn the heat down to medium/low and add 1/2 stick butter to the oil for the last 5 min per side.  100% healthy?  heck no, but how often do you eat it?  :-)

My son is a picky eater.  He really liked this one.  Must do:  Dredge in flour, then egg, then Saltines,potato flakes, spices mixture. Spices added: garlic, paprica, parsley, pepper, and seasoning salt such as Chachere's -- 1TBSP each  When pan fried with ~ 1/2 cup of oil the breading stayed on and the chicken turned out perfect.

I would give this 10 stars if I could!  I didn't have saltines so used 1-1/2 C bread crumbs, 3 T flour, 3 T potato flakes, 1 t salt, 1 t seasoning salt, 1/8 t garlic powder; and 3 eggs.  With a meat mallet, flattened the chicken breasts to about the same thickness and cut into strips.  Took the suggestion of another reviewer and first dipped the strips into the breading mixture, then into the eggs, then again into the breading.  I refrigerated them for a couple hours (this is what I do when I make chicken-fried steak, too) and then fried in olive oil.  By far the best chicken strips I have ever had!  Kids and hubby loved it, too!

I have been making this recipe my entire life. I learned it from my Mother and Grandmother. We all make it with and without the potato flakes. We also use it on pork chops, the ones that have bones come out tastingthe best but the boneless are yummy too. It's also very good with lemon or lime juice dripped on it immediately after cooking and DELICIOUS with italian dressing. 

One thing I have learned that is pertinent is that to get a good, thick breadingthat does not fall off at all, go flour, egg wash then crumbs and repeat egg and crumbs if you want, or not. The important thing is refrigerating the breaded meat for atleast a half an hour.

It's a good basic recipe but with so many reviewers having to modify the recipe and with the recipe calling for frequent turning I don't see how this recipe deserves a 4 or 5 star rating.  The frequent turning is a good way to make the crust fall off.  Leave it alone and turn it ONCE!  I had to laugh at the review that said they baked it instead and proclaimed it healthier than deep fried chicken.   Then they drenched it in a whole stick (1/2 cup) of butter!  LOL!  Brilliant! ;~}

I'm not big on fried foods but this was very good! I would even skip the gravey and just use the above for fried chicken. My family really enjoyed it. I used 2 chicken breast and fileted them and we have left overs. There are three of us and my husband eats for two so it makes a good sized portion! Thank you!

I absolutely love this recipe. The breading on the chicken is wonderful and every time I've make this it comes out perfect. This only thing I don't add are the potato flakes (because I never have any) and I really don't think it hurts the flavor at all.

Ok, so I thought people were over exaggerating when they said this chicken was tasty but they weren't. In addition to 1tsp season salt I added 1 tbsp of poultry seansoning, 1 tsp of garlic powder, and 1tsp of sea salt. I aslo took the advice of Carla (most helpful rating).

This recipe was fun. My son and I cooked this chicken together.  I wish we could have gotten the chicken breast pieces flattened out a little more.  This would be great for chicken tenders.  My honey loved this too and he is a tough one to please.  I agree with cooking it until the outside is nice and dark.  It also needed to sit untouched for a few minutes for the crust to set after coming out of the oil.  If not careful the crust falls off. Will use this recipe again.

Made this for my family and was very pleased with the results.  My daughter said its the best chicken she's ever had.  And my husband loves it too.  The only difference I made was instead of all-purpose flour, I used corn flour.  I also didn't mix the flour in the crumb batter but dipped the chicken in the flour first, then the egg, then the potato/cracker crumbs.  I also marinated the chicken before I made it with some lemon, basil, salt, pepper and paprika.  I will definitely be using this recipe from now on.

This recipe is the best!  It is very flavorful and has a great crunchy taste without being
greasy.  I used Ritz crackers instead of Saltines, and used 
extra light olive oil instead of just 1 tbsp.

My husband and i forgot to even talk while eating this meal! The recipe is perfect, I used a whole sleeve of saltines and ground them up to a fine crumb, added the flour, potato flakes seasoned salt and pepper as stated. I pounded out the chicken pieces dusted them with the crumb mix, dipped them in egg and then coated them in the same crumb mix. This is the only way to get a great crispy coating that sticks! I ended up frying them on each side about 4/5 minutes, drained them on paper towels and finished the fried chicken pieces up in the oven (350 for about 20 mins). Better than the restaurants!

I was afraid of the instant potatoes, as I can't stand them, but they are there just for texture.  I tweaked this recipe quite a bit, adding 1 tsp each of parsley, seasoned salt, garlic powder and about 1/2 tsp of paprika.  I dipped each piece in flour, then egg mixture, then crumb mixture.  BAKED in oven at 350 for almost an hour, turning once. It's a personal thing, I can't stand the mess of frying, and don't make enough fried foods to warrant buying a deep fryer.  Came out really tasty and moist!  Will make again, using fewer crackers.

This is one of the best recipes I've tried on this site.  I did pound the chicken which made for a shorter cooking time and also helped make for a better ratio of crispy "skin" to juicy meat.  I also did not have potato flakes on hand so I used panko which worked perfectly.  I will definitely be making this again!

I have made this recipe often and love it! The coating works well for chicken fried pork (cutlets), and chicken fried beef. I add onion & garlic powder generously;sometimes I add a few T of Panko for even more crunch. I also season meat before breading.I try to always have the cracker crumb mixture ready to go (just us amt needed, store the remainder in lockable baggy and/or canister).  This is terrific, season to your taste.

This is a good recipe but I made a few alterations for those who are dieting. :-) I used milk instead of eggs for dipping liquid. I used soya flour and instant potato flakes and skipped the salt because many food products come with salt already. Instead of oil, I used butter and baked the chicken rather than fry it. This came out very good and much less calories and cholesterol numbers.

I didn't have potato flakes so I substituted corn starch. Also double dipping the chicken ( flour, egg, flour) is a must.

Really easy, quick and tasty recipe.  I had this, mashed potatoes and corn on the table in a little over an hour.  Next time, I won't cook the thinner pieces as long as they burned and dried out slightly.  My own fault.  I took others' advice and dredged in flour, then egg, then the cracker mixture, then into the hot oil.  The flavor/seasoning was great (I also added a bit of garlic salt).  Thanks!

Very tasty for just cracker crumbs & dry potato flakes, will use this from now on for fried chicken. May even try it on fish.

This was good. I did change it (what I had on hand), I used ritz crackers, no flakes added garlic and onion powder and paprika. I also floured, then egg, then crumbs. I was a little disappointed no gravy recipe,but will make again.

Fabulous recipe!  I modified it a little by using Poppy Seed crackers and adding a little garlic powder. I also covered the chicken after it was crispy and it was so tender.  Thanks from my whole family for a great chicken recipe!

Really great recipe. My husband really loved it. The only thing I might change is serving it with a gravy or a sauce. It needed somthing to add a little more flavor.

Dredge the chicken pieces in flour before adding to the egg mixture. It keeps the chicken moist inside and helps hold the coating on! This is one of my eight year old son's favorite recipes dipped in a little bbq sauce on the side! :)

This recipe was wonderful we didnt have saltine crackers so we used ritz  it worked perfectly. We used chicken tenders for the kids.  Be sure not to overcook about 10-12min on each side.  For those who like more seasoning i suggest a little sprinkle of salt and pepper on the chicken itself before coating.  Thanks again

Very good!  The trick is to pound the chicken (just so they are all the same thickness) so the cooking time is even.  Also, don't get too heavy-handed with the salt in the seasonings...I forgot they were call "Saltines" for a reason.  Seriously yummy chicken.

I made chicken strips using the breading in this receipe and it was so good, my husband says he will never order chicken strips anywhere ever again. The breading was crunchy but not greasy, and the chicken was juicy. I even made an account on this website just so I could save this recipe!

i made this last night! i was hesitant at first because it seemed to be browning faster than i had expected and not cooking properly on the inside. but when i tasted it, it had came out great! moist tender chicken and a crunchy coating! i followed another review and did a mixture of the flour and other seasonings and coated the pounded chicken first with that then egg then the crackers. very yummy!

I wish I could give this 10 stars! Wow! Soooo good! Best fried chicken I"ve ever made and I"ve made lots! I made this for game night that my husband and I have with another couple every week and it was gone in minutes and everyone wanted seconds. I followed some recommendations by doubling the potato flakes (which are instant mashed potatoes), doubling the amount of seasoned salt (I used Lawry's) and adding a TBSP of garlic powder. Sooooo good! Will make over and over and over.

Yum!  I followed this recipe exactly, except for dipping in flour mix, egg, then flour mix again as suggested by another reviewer.  Cooked according to directions and it was crispy on the outside, juicy and tender on the inside, with great flavor.  I used a cast iron skillet and drained the grease after removing the chicken and most of the "crispies", heated skillet on high, stirred in some flour, then added milk, salt & pepper, and reduced heat to make a yummy white gravy.  I'll use this recipe again & again!

This was great! Earlier in the afternoon when I told my boyfriend what we were having for dinner he said that he did not want chicken for dinner. Well, needless to say that is what we had for dinner and halfway through the meal he said "I retract any statement I made earlier about not wanting chicken for dinner. I don't want this chicken to ever end." I made the recipe for only two large boneless chicken breast halves and used *15 saltine crackers *3 tsp. flour & potato flakes * 1.5 tsp. garlic powder and Lawry's seasoned salt *3/8 tsp. black pepper *one medium egg...I pounded the chicken in a ziplock freezer bag with a little water...patted it dry and dredged in flour FIRST...dipped in egg...then into the saltine mixture. I let it sit in the fridge for about 30 minutes before placing in the oil...I put the oil in the pan until it was Very hot and then removed it from the heat to cool slightly before adding the chicken...when the chicken was added I placed it back on the burner set to medium heat and browned one side for 5 minutes and flipped them over for another five minutes so both sides were very crispy...reduced the heat slightly and cooked for an additional 10 minutes turning occasionally. In total I cooked the (pounded/flattened) chicken breasts about 20 minutes and even the thickest park came out perfectly white and extra juicy. THIS RECIPE IS A DEFINITE KEEPER!

Love this recipe. I didn't want to take the time smashing up the saltines & was going to use bread crumbs but, at the last minute, I gave in and glad that I did. The saltines are key to the crunchy goodness of this chicken. I marinated the chicken for a few hours in buttermilk (1 cup of milk with 1 tablespoon of lemon juice). I didn't fry  but baked at 375 for about 50 minutes. You would never be able to tell that it was baked and not fried, it was that good!!! Thank you for this recipe!

WOW...!!  A defintie "KEEPER", made it last night during a snowy night in the Northeast.  A perfect meal, french fries with brown gravy and melted Mozzarella cheese & homemade crem corn.  I doubled the coating mixture, used 3 eggs and added additonal spices, garlic powder, paprika, cayanne pepper, 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese & parsley.  Also, use 1/3 cup oil and don't continously turn, brown one side completely then turn, coating mixture stays on much better.  Using the left overs today in a salad, can't wait to make this again...!

This was wonderful.  My kids (ages 7 and 10) even loved it.  I made the minor adjustments recommended: *added garlic powder, pinch of cayenne, poultry seasoning, all to coating mixture *dredged in some flour, then egg, then coating mixture *needed more egg than recipe called for.  Smelled wonderful also.

Yum!! I followed the recipe EXACTLY except I used chicken tenders. Do NOT omit the potato flakes. I added a little more than suggested and it added SO MUCH flavor!! Here is the method I used to make the recipe a little easier. I crushed the crackers in a gallon sized ziploc freezer bag with a rolling pin. I then poured the crumbs into a flat round Tupperware container, along with the rest of the dry ingredients. Closed the lid and shook it all up. Then I used the same bag to pound my chicken tenders with a meat mallet. Then it was dip, coat, fry :) This worked like a charm and there were less dishes to wash and less to clean. I fried them in canola oil. TY Cassie!!

It turned out well... we did wing it with ritz buttery crackers instead of saltines. I also pound the chicken breasts a bit and it helps them turn out even more tender (I think).

I used this recipe with skinless, boneless chicken breasts to make chicken 
sandwhiches on kaiser buns with lettuce and tomato.  I have to say that it was
the best thing I've ever tried for the first time!  YUMMM!!

This was "almost" as good as my Grandma's fried chicken. :) I never got a chance to ask my Grandma how she seasoned her chicken so I am really glad to have found this recipe. The flavor is fantastic. I actually used skinless, boneless thighs and they were amazing. The only other change I made is that I coated the chicken the way my grandma used to--dipping it in flour first, then egg, then the coating. Coating it this way is the only way I've ever been able to keep the coating from sliding off the chicken every time I go to turn it. Then I fried it in a deep pot on medium heat (I use a pot instead of a skillet so the grease doesn't splatter on the counter). It turned out beautifully! Super golden and crispy on the outside and really juicy and tender on the inside. One other tip, once my chicken is perfectly golden brown I like to place it in a paper towel-lined colander set on top of a baking sheet (to collect drips) and keep it in a 250 degree oven while I make my gravy and finish up the rest of my side dishes. This not only keeps the chicken from getting cold but it ensures that the chicken is cooked through so I don't have to overcook it in the skillet and risk burning the skin.

UPDATE 2/9/12: Tried this again. This time leaving out the potato flakes, and adding 2 T parmesan, 1 extra tsp seasoned salt, 1 tsp smoked paprika, 2 tsp garlic powder, and 1/2 tsp cayenne. Even better than the first time. (I forgot the initial flour dredge and that was a mistake. It makes a big difference with this extra crunchy coating.) 
This is very good especially with some of the excellent comments from others. The chicken breasts need to be pounded down a bit so that they cook quicker and don't burn in the hot oil. I also followed the flour->egg->cracker crumb suggestion. I added garlic powder, paprika, and dried parsley. Next time, I may substitute parmesan for the potato flakes which didn't seem to add anything, and I'll probably amp up the spices as well. Still, this is a GREAT concept that's waaay better than the traditional seasoned flour or bread crumb coating. A keeper.

We really liked this chicken.  I give it 4 stars, BF gives it 5.  I took the suggestion of others and increased the seasoned salt to 1T, but I found that in combination with the saltines, it ended up being too salty for my tastes (not reflected in my rating since it was my own alteration).  Will try 1 1/2 tsp next time.  The only addition I made was a little garlic powder and I did dredge the breasts in flour before dipping in the egg.  I always cut chicken breasts in half so prolonged cooking isn't needed, which can result in burned coating or the meat becoming too dry.  Very tasty, will definitely make again.

I have never been able to accomplish fried chicken that was both juicy and crispy... until now! I used Ritz crackers in place of the saltines and fried chicken thighs in place of chicken breast halves, but my husband and our boys couldn't put the chicken down after the first bite.

I made this twice ... first time I dredged in flour before egg, and didn't alter breading ingredients. Second time I did not dredge in flour but did double the seasoned salt and pepper in the coating. Much better the second time!

Great recipe! I made it once following the recipe to a T, and it was a bit bland, and the crust was a little soggy, with the breasts being too dry. The second time, as others have suggested, I also added garlic powder, paprika, onion powder and cayenne pepper to the cracker crumb mixture. I also dredged the chicken in the flour, then the egg, then the cracker mixture, wrather than the way you had it posted. It layered it a little thicker that way and helped to keep it crisp. Bonless skinless chicken breast is naturally pretty dry, so this time I used regualr chicken cutlets with skin and bone, and they came out very juicy! Fabulous recipe! I will continue to play with it, but I will definitely be making it again! Thanks!

This recipe is fantastic.  I did have to leave out the pepper because of a food allergy, but i think this recipe could be used in a variety of cuisines, and could easily be altered by adding different seasonings or dipping sauces.  This has become a staple in our house.

This was so good. I hate thick flour batter on chicken and this was so much better. Thick, crispy and yummy. I cut my chicken into strips and dredged the chicken in flour before the egg. I didn't have potatoe flakes, but it still tasted great.

Excellent! I also dredged in flour first before the egg, the coating stuck wonderfully and it tasted delicious!  Served with gravy (just a packet kind) and yellow squash casserole, and hubby commented several times how good it all was!  Thanks!

Totally delicious,non greasy and moist chicken. The only changes I made were to use boneless chicken thighs and I used the dredge in flour first, then egg wash, then coating. I've made this recipe before and we used leftovers cold in sandwiches for a picnic and they were really good.

What an amazing recipe !! I didn't have saltines or potato flakes so I used Ritz crackers and chopped them fine using my processor, also realized I didn't have eggs once I had everything laid out so I used another users suggestion for ranch dressing, turned out AMAZING!!! I would have never thought to use Ranch in place of eggs but I was pleasantly surprised by the results. In the cracker mix I used half a packet of dry Ranch mix, seasoned salt and garlic powder, I like to go pretty heavy on the seasonings and this recipe is very forgiving, you can use any seasonings to suite your tastes. I did 5 min on each side and then an additional 3 minutes on each side until done. Very very VERY good, I will be making again and again, THANK YOU !!!

This recipe is delicious. I used chicken thighs, instead of breasts. I fried the chicken until they were golden brown, than baked it for about 45 mins in the oven. The first time I made this, I fried it over the stove. But I decided to fry for a bit then bake it...it tasted much better. I also added paprika and table salt (since i didn't have season salt on hand) in the flour mix. I dipped the chicken: Flour mixture, egg, crackers (as one reviewer suggested)

Very good! Even my super-picky 10-year old brother said "you should make this chicken every week!"  Not one of my favorite meals to recollect, due to me over-salting my mashed-potatoes :( but the chicken was a hit and was actually rather easy to make (I followed the recipe exactly). Thanks!

This was the best fried chicken I ever made.  Next time I wont flip it as much, the batter began to fall off.  I think just one flip half way through will do the trick.  Other than that this is perfect and will be a regular in my house.

Oh wow this was the best and easiest chicken fried chicken ever. The breading was light and not heavy and crispy. When you pound the chicken thin it takes no time to cook.

My family loves this recipe. I've probably made it 20 times.  I did the the other review said to dip in flour then egg and it does make a different but not a huge one.  It seems like the breading is thicker and stays on the chicken better.  We tried using French's Dried Onions instead of crackers and it was way to greasy.  I follow the recipe as is. I normally put the oil in the pan and turn it on high then when I see that it's really hot I turn it on medium and let it cool down for about 3 minutes and place the chicken in it.

I have never been able to successfully fry chicken, that is, until I made this recipe! It was so good! I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts.

I really did change this up quite a lot, but I'm sure it would've been very good as written.  I used bone-in chicken parts, made the coating with extra seasonings (garlic powder, parsley, paprika and more Lawry's), and did the 3 step technique so many other reviewers recommended (flour, egg, cracker mixture).  Then, arteries be damned, I did the rest of as a traditional fried chicken since they were bone-in pieces - about a cup of Crisco, browned it on both sides, then cooked covered for about a half hour on med-low heat.  Removed the cover and back up to higher heat to crisp up at the end.  Very good!

What a wonderful recipe...crisp, great-textured crust!  Like other reviewers I highly recommend lightly flouring the chicken before dipping in the egg and crumb mixture.  The coating then adheres perfectly creating a crisp exterior and a juicy, greaseless interior.  I used wingettes and fried them in 375 degree oil that came halfway up the sides for 20 minutes or so turning frequently.  Make sure to season the chicken itself to your personal taste before you flour it.  Don't rely solely on seasoning the flour or the finished dish will be bland.  A nice dipping sauce is a blend of apricot preserves mixed with a teaspoon of Dijon mustard and a dash of Chinese five spice powder.  Thanks CASSJW for sharing this recipe.

Great chicken, my husband loved it and said to keep this recipe.  Fried the chicken on each side for 5-6 minutes on each side and then baked for 20 minutes in a 300 degree oven to make sure it was cooked clear through.  Will make again.  GREAT!

THE BEST FRIED CHICKEN EVER!!! This stuff is awesome, i'm not a big chicken guy but this won me over forever. I only had one egg so I used some ranch with it for the wet dredge as per another reviewer (thanks) and I pretty much winged it on the measurements because I didn't need that much (it is very filling) it was incredible, the coating stuck like glue and kept the Chix nice and juicy, love it, will def. mke again and again!!! Thanks so much for sharing it!

Very Yummy!!! I did a few things differant...first, i didn't have any potato flakes, so I just added a few more crackers. Also added some garlic salt, paprika, and parsley (a few dashes of each). I covered the ckicken in flower, then egg (needed 2 eggs), then the cracker mixture. I really didn't want the heaviness of frying in oil, so I put them in a 13x9 pan, and baked at 375 degrees for 45 minutes, then melted a stick of butter, and spooned melted butter onto each piece, then baked for an addition 5 minutes. Awesome, Hubby even called leftovers for the next day!! This is definately a keeper.

Great taste!!  We liked it a lot!  I used chicken thighs instead of breast. Note:If you turn the chicken frequently while frying, the crumbs WILL fall off.  I cooked my chicken on medium to low and covered it and cooked it for about 20 minutes only turning ONCE.  It was moist, the crumb mixture stayed  put and we ate it all up!

THE BEST CHICKEN EVER!!! I followed the recipe except - I used cutlets instead of breasts halves. I also used Keebler's Club Crackers instead of Saltines. I also added a teaspoon of adobo seasoning to the recipe. The chicken was very CRISPY on the outside and JUICY on the inside.  I served it with sweet potato casserole. This recipe is a keeper and I will make it again and again.
Thanks for the recipe Cassie. UPDATE: The 2nd time making this great chicken - I also added a 1/8 teaspoon of groung nutmeg it was even better. Trust me try it with the nutmeg you will love it.

AWESOME!!!  I have made it 3 or 4 times and it's so good and crunchy.  I add lots of spices to mine.  Garlic salt, onion powder, paprika, cayenne pepper.  I only turn the chicken once during cooking, it hepls to keep the breading on.  I also pound the chiken flat, it's very tender and doesn't take long to cook.

I really liked the texture and color of this chicken and will definitely be keeping the recipe.  The only thing is that I found it could use more seasoning...I added a full tablespoon of seasoned salt and I still don't think that was enough. So next time I'll probably add more salt and maybe some other spices or herbs.

A prior review said to make extra because the leftovers are great, and they were right!  My husband rarely eats leftovers, and he couldn't stop talking about how good it was as a sandwich with Swiss cheese on a kaiser roll.

This recipe is definitely a keeper. I agree with "lonnarific" that some reviewers complaints are not fair. If the recipe had been called KFC Original, I would have been dissappointed because it was too crispy and didn't have 11 herbs and spices. Prepared as directed, however, this recipe lives up to its name and, as another reviewer said, rivals restaurant style Chicken Fried Chicken. I did as others suggested (and as I'm accustomed to when breading foods) and dredged the chicken in a little seasoned flour first, then dipped it in the egg wash and then in the cracker crumb breading. I can see how the skinless, boneless chicken breasts that are called for would work best, and the thin sliced ones that I used browned nicely and were moist and tender. I also made "country gravy" and mashed potatoes since that is what I'm used to having with Chicken Fried Chicken. I will definitely be making this again!

Yum! I wanted to make crispy chicken tacos and needed a good fried chicken recipe. I doubled all the spices and added garlic powder. I also put the chicken tenders in flour, then egg, then the crumb mixture. Only a few minutes per side and I had perfect fried chicken tenders for my tacos!

3 stars for being easy-i made as directed but used a food processor to make the crackers into crumbs. I think with some additional seasoning this could be a 5-star recipe.

This chicken was great. I suggest that youincrease the seasoning and season every layer..I washed and seasoned the chicken..then i dredged in seasoned flour..then egg wash..then cracker/flour mix. I couldnt find dried potato flakes so I left that out. Made this with waffles..kids and husband loved it. By the way, I would suggest buying thiny sliced chicken breasts and still pounding them down to make them thinner. I will put this recipe in the keepers file.

It appears that most of the recipes use chicken breasts.  That is ok but, dark meat is much more flavorable and moister.  Folks, you need to get off the "scare wagon" about poultry dark meat.  Many of the poultry recipes on this site would be 6 stars if leg and thiegh meat were used.  For the amount of product used there would be minimal difference.

Good, nice crust. I did add more seasonings as we like food that has some spice. i did flour it before putting in the egg and cracker mix. I had made 4 breasts and barely had enough cracker mix to cover it (and i used the full sleeve of saltines), you may need more. You will definetely need more oil. there is no way that 1/4c of oil will fry up that much chicken. thats what i put in the pan when i first started the first batch.

This recipe is a great base to go off of for a quick and easy fried chicken/baked chicken recipe. What I did was that I used sesame crackers, flour, garlic salt, garlic powder, black peppers, chili powder, paprika, and New Orleans seasoning. I mix all dry ingredients together in a bowl and set aside. In another bowl I used egg beater. In another bowl I combined flour, New Orleans seasoning, chili powder, and paprika. I used chicken thighs since I prefer dark meat. (1) dip chicken in egg, then in flour, then in egg again, then in crumbs. (2) Spray pan lined with foil (3) Place chicken on pan and spray with EVOO (4) Bake at 350 degrees for about 30-40 minutes (turn the chicken over 5-10 minutes before it is done to make both sides brown evenly). Recipe turns out really well. I used this in a chicken sandwich with a spread that I mixed together (mayo and honey). Side with a salad.

I love this recipe! I have made it dozens of times so far. The only thing I change is my oil, I use extra virgin coconut oil. Coconut oil has a ton of health benefits and it makes the chicken taste amazing!

Just made this and it was the best I have had in a long time!  Did do the flour and then the egg and then the crackers and potatoes flakes last.  Turned out really good!

Nice and easy for a first timer.  Chicken stays very moist, but takes quite a while to cook through.

I made this tonite because we were having our traditional Sunday dinner with some family over, and I wanted to try something different besides my egg wash and bread crumb chicken cutlets. I must say that these were delicious! I followed someone elses suggestion of dredging through flour first before egg wash and saltine coating, and I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and I was very pleased with the results. My children love this as well! I will definetly be using this again.

I put a little over 30 crackers in the food processor with 1tsp of garlic powder, 2 tbs of flour, 1/2 tsp of black pepper, and 1 tsp of season salt.  I also dredged the chicken in flour then in egg and then teh saltine mixture.  This was ok but it needed more seasoning.  I'm not sure I would make this again.

Yum! The coating on this chicken is great as is. I wouldn't change a thing about it. I did pound the thicker part of the chicken breast so it was an even thickness throughout. It cooked quickly & evenly. Served with old fashioned peppered gravy, the whole family really liked it. I have made it twice so far, and will be making it often.

My husband has been begging for some homemade fried chicken, but I've never been really good at it until now!  I flattened the chicken breasts by pounding them with a mallet inside a plastic freezer bag and turned out these huge impressive portions.  Maybe the breasts were overly large to start with, so maybe I could have used a bit more egg wash and mixture, but it still worked fine.  I also followed recommendations and added a little extra seasoning salt and some garlic powder to the crumb mixture and dredged the chicken in flour first, then egg wash, then crumb mixture.  It was all a little messy, but the results were well worth it when my husband smiled!  Thanks!!

This was really quick and easy and tasted so good.  I pounded the chicken as others suggested and added some garlic powder to the crumb mixture.  I also first dipped in flour, then egg, then crumbs.  The chicken is crunchy on the outside, and so juicy inside.  I made as a quick family meal, but would serve this to company.  Thanks for the great recipe, will definitely make again!

I floured first as one reviewer suggested. The breading got crispy and stayed put. The kids liked it because they said it tasted "salty." It was a little too salty in my opinion, but pretty good.

I added a little extra spices custom to our taste.  The only thing I would HIGHLY recommend it to double batter the chicken. (egg wash, shake in mix, egg wash again, shake in mix again)

wow, this is some good fried chicken!  I could never get the coating right when doing it before and this coating was great!  I did what others suggested.  pounded the chicken flat with a frying pan.  then first coated it in a flour/spice mixture;  then dipped it in the eggs;  then coated it again with the cracker/flakes/flour/spice mixture.  turned out great-- i was so proud of myself!

Crispy and delicious.  I allowed to cool on a wire cooling rack (with yesterdays newspaper underneath to catch the dripping oil) while finishing the other pieces of chicken.  This helped keep the chicken crispy.  Thank you for a new chicken recipe.

Absolutely delicious. I also pounded out the chicken so it would cook more quickly, and cooked the chicken until the outside was a darker brown. This dish was a nice treat.

I've never fried anything like this in my life.  Man, was this good!  And, for some reason it didn't taste greasy at all.  I did everything as written, except I dredged in flour first, then the rest as written.  I will make this again for sure.  DH (fussy eater) liked it.   Thank you for a very nice recipe.

This was my first time frying chicken and it turned out great!  I did use cajun seasoning and some extra salt pepper garlic to spice it up a bit. I used the thin sliced boneless chicken breasts - no pounding - and I only cooked about 5 mins per side.  They were soooooo tasty and juicy!

Nothing special and very little taste. My kids ended up removing the cracker coating from the chicken and ate the chicken plain instead.

I was a little skeptical with the recipe.  I usually just use mckormick seasoning and some bread crumbs but i tried and i really liked it.  Even my 3 and 5 year old ate it and they never eat anything.  I used 12 drumbsticks instead.  Definitely will make again. Thanks for this one!

UPDATE: now when I make this I make sure to salt and pepper the chicken before putting into the egg.  Also I add several splashes of Tobasco to the egg with a splash of water.  I cook in a 9inch skillet with a large lid over it.  Still comes out the same but the taste is better.  Again, Thanks for this one!

This was a very delicious recipe. The only thing I added was Adobo because I add that to all of my fried chicken mixes.  I loved the saltine cracker idea. I think this might be the best fried chicken recipe I have had. I can't wait to try it with other meats!!!! Thank you for posting it :)

This was my 1st attempt at fried chicken and it turned out perfectly.  The recipe is so easy and yummy.  I added and little bit of thyme to the breading and omitted the flour.  Instead I dipped the chicken in flour then egg then the breading. It was not greasy at all!   So easy and a crowd pleaser!

9/10 i changed alot. had no potato flakes and saltines but wanted fried chicken. i dipped breasts in flour (s&p), egg wash with teriyaki marinade, then crushed crumbs of sunchips, cornmeal, bread crumbs, and panko.   mostly sunchips though.  2 little bags for 4 pieces of ckn.  we all liked it alot, definitey make again.  good with orzo, tomatoes, feta and fresh basil.

Fabulous. Great recipe, combined with most helpful reviews.  My fast food loving 11yo now prefers to the commercial variety & its healthier. Met my health conscious wife's high standards too. Did the plates of flour, then egg, then cracker/potato/seasoning mix after son had fun smashing the bag of crackers.   Agree with not turning too much (say at least 5 mins each side to start with), and cooking until very dark brown. Great coating, juicy chicken. Yum.  Another winner!

This chicken smelled so good when it was cooking.  It was a little bland but like CASSJW said you can spice it up the way you want.  The meat was very juicy....I will do this one again.

Very good and crispy!  I dipped in flour, then egg and then cracker mixture.  I've made it twice so far using thighs.  I also added garlic and hot sauce for extra flavor.

I enjoyed it the most in my family, but a few tips to the wise:     Cook in a non-stick pan, rather than stainless steel. Stuck horribly, so that all the cracker mix fell off.     Add salt (plus a little pepper) to pre-cut chicken breasts before adding to the cracker mix, or better yet, soak in a cup of salt water solution so it gets into the inside.       Add a little Garlic Salt plus some minced dried onions. I added something called KY Kernel Mix instead of regular flour.       Recommend Following advice to bake after frying for at least 7 minutes to dry out the oil. With the leftovers it feels heavy, though you don't notice it as much after cooking it the night you do it.

Very good - made the plain old chicken breast seem really special.  I made it like everyone said with extra seasoning but I only 'fried' it for about 8 minutes, it was getting very dark so I took them out and put them on a draining rack in a large pan and put it in the oven on 320 for about 15 min. to make sure it was done  but still crispy - it was perfect.  Made mashed potatoes and gravy (that went over the breast too) and fresh green beans - super dinner - thanks for the recipe.

This couldn't be easier! I followed the recipe exactly until the frying part. Instead I baked at 275 for 25 minutes, and my chicken was super crispy and juicy. Even the picky kids love it! This one is a keeper for sure!

This was the best fried chicken I've ever made! I did take the advice of previous posters and added seasonings of my liking to the flour mix and I also first dipped in the flour, then the egg wash and then crackers. I also fried in a cast iron skillet (which I think is a necessity) and I couldn't have been happier with the end result. This will now be THE fried chicken recipe I use every time!  Thank you!

The flavor and texture of the coating was really good, but the chicken turned out dry.  I think next time I'll use chicken tenders instead of chicken breast.

We tried this recipe last night, but with a few minor changes. We put 1 tsp season salt, 1/2 tsp pepper, and 1/2 tsp onion salt in a shallow bowl with two Tbs flour. For crackers we used Ritz. We coated the chicken strips with the seasoned flour, dipped them in the beatten egg, then coated them with crushed cracker crumbs mixed with potato flakes. We doubled everything to coat chicken strips cut from three breasts. Strips fry faster than whole pieces, so watch them carefully. It turned out so yummy...we'll defiitely make this again!

This chicken was very good, and was so easy.  My family loved it, especially our kids, 2 and 11 years old.  I did not have potato flakes so I substituted with potato chips and no seasoned salt so I substituted with sea salt.  I also increased to 3 tablespoons flour, and added 1 tablespoon Paprika, and crushed snack crackers to the coating mixture.

This is the best fried chicken I have EVER made.   I used a cut-up, whole chicken, and Ritz crackers. I added a teaspoon each of garlic powder, onion powder and paprika. I followed other users suggestions of coating with flour before dipping in egg.  This is the recipe I'll use from now on.

This HAS to be 5 stars as far as I'm concerned, like another commenter stated tho,"if you want a little spice, then add it, but don't take away star ratings because "you" like it with or without more"...After all,a recipe is just one person's taste, YOU get to tweak them the way YOU will like it. And your  recipe is VERY good CASSJW, and you deserve to know that it is!! So yes, I rated it 5 stars, because it IS a good recipe, and like she said, It's fun to do with kids also ; )

This was really good. I tried it a couple of different ways. Flour, egg & seasoned bread crumbs, flour & egg but the best was mixing the flour and bread crumbs and then dipping in egg and re-coating in crumb mixture. It was really good and the chicken was soooo moist. I seasoned the flour/breadcrumb mixture with garlic powder and seasoning salt. A big hit with the family. Thanks for the recipe.

This...is...so...good!!  I mean it's THAT good. You can use boneless chicken thighs or breast. I suggest you cut them thin to cut down on cooking time. Brown well, the crust will stick better if you make it crispy and keep the oil hot.  You can use different types of crackers, I've used townhouse, ritz and club all came out great. The only change I made was to cut out the seasoned salt (as the crackers have enough salt) and add some paprika. I have a large family so I always double the amount of breading and use 1 1/2 times the amount of chicken.

This is my very favorite fried chicken - and so easy to do!  I usually cut chicken breasts into strips, cooks faster that way.  The trick to getting breading to stick is to coat the chicken with flour before you put it in the egg beat, then proceed as usual.  Great recipe!

My mom made this recipe, she rated this a 5 and I trust her opinion because I think my mom is the best cook in the world!! But then again we all think our own mom is the best......she used pre-marinated chicken breast a garlic flavor and followed the recipe, she said she will make it again.

I guess I will go against popular opinion but I just didn't understand the raves about this recipe. Bland is what my family said.  Seasonings need to be tweeked but unfortunately I don't know how to do that.  Pro's about the recipe: The cracker crust with potato flakes really adhered to the chicken and kept the chicken very moist.  I guess I'll keep searching for the perfect fried chicken recipe. This may be a start if someone can help with changes they made with the spices. Thanks for the recipe it was a nice dinner just not what I was looking for.

When I saw the recipe called for dry potato flakes as part of the crust, I thought "wha-a-a??",  Didn't sound particularly appealing.  But it had many good reviews so I tried it anyway, and even was generous with the amount of potato flakes.  This dish is wonderful...one of the best fried chicken recipes ever...and there are a million of them out there!  Now I cook this all the time....thanks!!!

Excellent. Tweak the spices,garlic, thyme, poultry seasoning, etc. and be sure to dip the chicken in flour first before the egg. I also lightly season the flour first. Fry until golden, a few minutes each side, then place in 350 degree oven for about 15 minutes. Lovely.

My hubby and I loved it.  I just don't think you need as much oil (I used EVOO).  Also, used some parmesan cheese, garlic powder and red cayenne pepper.  Didn't have potato flakes.  I will make again.  Served w/ Honey Mustard Dressing from this site which is awesome by the way!

Very good recipe, easy to make.  Instead of seasoned salt, I added dried basil, parmesan cheese, and some Kosher salt.  Additionally, I didn't shake the breasts in a bag, rather I pressed them onto the crumb mixture on a plate... more even coating of crumbs onto breasts.  Also, I only browned them in an oven proof non stick pan and then finished the breasts in a 350 degree oven.  The breasts won't dry out that way.  Will make this again.

THANK YOU!!! Unlike most of the recipes I've tried, the chicken was actually crispy, the coating stayed on AND the flavor was great. Amazing and EASY! I wish I could give it 10 stars. I use 2 tbsp of season-all w/ pepper.

I made this today as part of a southern style lunch I prepared for my boyfriend on his lunch break. He raved about it all day! If you have a cast iron skillet, it is great, and to ensure better flavor and cooking, pound the chicken flat between wax paper, add garlic powder, onion powder and paprika to the seasoning.  Also, double coat the chicken and use more saltine crackers and adjust ingred. accordingly, esp. adding more pepper and seasoned salt. You will need about 3 eggs for the wash. It reheats well too! It makes a good southern meal along with coleslaw, cornbread,  fruit salad, creamed corn casserole and sweet tea.

This was very good.  I took others' recommendations and added some onion powder, garlic powder, and a little cajun seasoning to the dry mix.  Be sure to allow the egg to drain off well before dredging or the coating won't stick well.

This was really good and very easy.  Only problem I had was instead of using chicken breast, I used chicken thighs and while frying the pieces, it browned too fast before it was even close to being done, so what I did was baked the chicken in the oven at 350 degrees (covered with an aluminum foil to keep it from browning) for 30 minutes and it came out fine.

Excellent.  coating adhered well and stayed crispy.  I added cajun seasoning to my chicken before breading.  My husband, who is eternally snobby towards food, had me fix this chicken twice in one week (very rare indeed).

WOW! I couldn't believe how incredibly fast, easy, and delious this turned out to be. I scaled the recipe down to 3, and followed it exactly. 
The chicken was sooooo good. I never thought about using cracker crumbs for coating chicken. I wonder what role the potatoe flakes play? I almost left them out, but, I really wanted to follow the recipe exactly, so, I put them in. This took about 20 minutes to prepare...start to finish. We will definitely make this again. I am sending it to all of my friends and family. Thanks so much for this recipe!

Delicious.  I'm a "new" cook so I needed something easy and "un-ruinable" and this was perfect.  Of course I ruined it a little (cooked it too long) but the batter part was absolutely scrumptious.  I took other reviewers advice and used garlic powder and paprika and also added a little extra oil.  I recommend this recipe to anyone who is new to cooking.  My husband was shocked I made something so yummy.

A+ recipe!  My husband declared it was the best chicken I've ever made.  My toddler liked it, probably would have loved it if he didn't have chicken at daycare today, too.  I used Ritz crackers and omitted the seasoned salt, opting for plain kosher.  I also used more oil as someone suggested.  My husband loves chicken fried chicken with cream gravy so I made some and served it on the side with some mashed potatoes.  YUMMY!  I've been looking for a good fried chicken recipe and found a great one instead.  Thanks!

This was my first time making fried chicken and it was incredible! Juicy on the inside and crunchy on the outside---cooked to perfection. Changes I made: added paprika, garlic salt, onion powder, seasoning salt to the bread crumb mixture. Also, used oyster crackers instead of saltines. Tons of flavor!

Uh.......... THIS RECIPE IS FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!   I just used it for the first time last night.  Made two batches - one for the kids (identical to the recipe) and one for me (added a few ingredients).  

For the kids, it was PERFECT, seriously, the best fried chicken I've made in a frying pan in my kitchen to date.  They LOVED it!  

The only reason I made a batch for me is because I wanted to spice it up a little....  So I put some garlic Tabasco sauce in the egg mixture and some Cajun dry seasoning in the flour/cracker mixture, and it made for some tasty, yet spicy, fried chicken!  

Oh, I also fried up some bacon before, and used the remaining bacon grease along w/ oil to fry up the chicken.

The chicken came out golden, crispy, juicy and literally perfect.  The best thing - didn't have to use a deep fryer!  Just used a pan w/ higher sides!  Nice!

I will admit prep-time was a little longer, because of the two batches.....  but it was well worth it!

If you like restaurant style chicken fingers, then use this recipe to make your chicken, just be sure to crumble the crackers the best you can, don't short yourself on that or you will get big chunks of crackers in your breading....

GREAT recipe, can't say enough good things about it!

I made this for dinner tonight. I used the exact measurements for the ingredients, however, I would use more spices next time. I used 2 medium  and 1 large sized boneless/skinless breast (pounded to 1" thick, quartered. That being said, the recipe was very, very good. My husband, who doesn't particularly care for my "normal" fried chicken, ate two pieces tonight. Both my teenage daughters LOVED it! I was excited to learn through the other reviewers to flour first, egg bath next, cracker mixture last. I also followed the advice to fry on medium heat for 4 minutes each side (only flipped once)then 20 minutes in a 350 degree oven! It was perfectly done, juicy, crispy! Very very good! I will definitely make it again. Thanks for the recipe CASSJW!

the chicken was a disaster, but i'm only a beginner. first of all, you need more vegetable oil. frying chicken should not be done in a skillet but in something big, and whatever you use fill up half of it with the vegetable oil. then, heat up the oil, put it at 7, that's where it should stay too. as for the batter, my boyfriend schooled me on frying chicken, after my failed attempt he came to the rescue. he got a nice medium sized mixing bowl and whipped 2 eggs, about a cup of milk, and i wanna say 2 cups of seasoned flour (all-purpose works too). he dipped the chicken in the batter and made sure it was all battered up. then he made sure the oil was done by sprinkling the batter in the oil, unless the batter starts to fry when it hits the oil, the oil is still not hot enough. then he put in the chicken one by one, he put maybe two or three at a time, but not more than that. and key is to constantly turn the chicken. now, a little advice on making sure it's cooked all the way through, cut a long slice inside the chicken so the oil will get inside the chicken, this helps also with checking whether it still needs more cooking or whether it's done. we like our chicken to be cooked all the way through, the bone could be a little bit pink and i mean like barely even pink but that's about it. he always tells me, chicken is done if it floats to the top. we added chicken as we pulled out, and like i said, his chicken came out a beautiful dark brown color, i was so mad...

This was fantastic! Next time, I'll season the chicken before I dredge it in seasoned flour, then dip it in the eggs, and finally the cracker-crumb mixturre. I browned them about 6 minutes on each side; then baked them at 350 for about 18 minutes! Wonderful method - so crispy! I may even try the cracker-crumb mixture on boneless pork chops! Definitely a keeper!

I did not have potato flakes, but figuring it was the starch that it brought to the party, I used a little corn starch instead.  I also floured the chicken before the egg dip.  This was the best breading I have made.  It stick to the meat very well and came out good and crispy.

This was delicious! I soaked my chicken breast in buttermilk first, as I always do. Rinsed it after an hour, patted dry, dipped in flour, egg and then the saltine mixture. We were going to have a fish fry so we also deep fried the chicken! OMG, this was the best I have ever eaten....... Will use this recipe from now on....Moist, crispy and delicious! Thanks for sharing this recipe CASSJW....

WOW, this recipe is AMAZING. I customised it a little based on other reviews and also what I had in my pantry. 

I didn't have potato flakes, so I did without it. 

I didn't have saltines, but I had cracked pepper flavoured water crackers, so I used those instead.

I had a whole chicken (about 3.3 pounds) that I cut up into pieces, rubbed with 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon white pepper and 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper and left to season for a few hours.

I took another reviewer's comment and breaded the chicken in this order = flour, egg, coating. Shallow fried the chicken pieces in a saucepan on 2-3 minutes each side to get a golden brown crust and then arranged them in a baking pan and left them baking in the oven at 185 degrees celsius for about 15 minutes. 

I'm not a big fan of deep frying hence I went the shallow fry + bake option. The results were AMAZING!

Yum. I followed another reviewers advice, and dredged the chicken in flour before using the egg and coating. I baked it in the oven, and added a cup of butter toward the end.

I made this last week and it got great raves from the entire family, with my husband that is something. I asked my daughter what she wanted for dinner tonight and she said this chicken. I followed the recipe exact except I put chicken in flour before I dipped in egg. It was fantastic, I love that I can make it with boneless, skinless, chicken breast becuase that is what we eat. The chicken came out crunchy with a great coating, and nice and juicy on the inside. This has definately become a staple in our home, and I love how easy it is to make. Thank you

It was good, but I may try omitting the saltine crackers next time (I prefer flour-battered fried foods). It needs more seasoning, but is easy to throw together and cooks up relatively quick.

I made this for my picky eaters this last week.  For a little extra flavor I added 1/2 of a dry ranch packet to the dry mixture, I also added just a sprinkle of red pepper flakes. DELISH...this is definely a keeper in our house, got rave review.

Followed recipe exactly. Chicken stayed moist. And because it's breasts, they fried up quickly. Toward the end the crumb mixture wasn't sticking so I double diped in egg. Will make it again for an upcoming picnic but will season chicken first and add parmesan to the crumb mixture.

Great recipe...very similar to my own old stand-by. One easy addition for variety is 1/4 cup parmesan cheese added to the coating.  

Pork chops taste just as delicious prepared this way.

I'm not that good at frying chicken like this.  It took longer than I expected.  Tasted okay, but probably won't make again.

Made this last night and my son tells me it's one of the first 5 star recipes that really is 5 stars!  It was really tasty, reminded me a bit like KFC without the high price!  Making them into chicken nuggets was a suggestions made by the whole family, might try to do it that way next time.

This was great!! I did, however, have to replace the potato flakes with panko bread crumbs because that's all I had on hand. My husband loved it! Best eaten fresh. I tried doing different things with the leftovers to make them as crisp, but didn't compare to the day of when it's fresh!

We made this for my mom on Mother's Day.  It taste really good, but the mess  is worth mentioning.  You won't be able to reuse your oil a lot of the topping falls off.  I was hoping for a lighter brown  crust and this one is on the heavy side and did not get as brown as I thought.  The tase was really good though!

Excellent!! As recommended I floured the chicken prior to the egg dredge. It makes a large difference. I also used 1T of season salt and 1T of garlic powered as other reviewer recommended.

A huge hit with the boyfriend's extended family - they snatched up all the leftovers before everyone was even finished eating!  Didn't have potato flakes, so I just threw in some parmesan-seasoned breadcrumbs instead.  Cooked in deepfryer for 11-12 minutes and it turned out perfect!

Absolutely delicious! I did do just a couple things different... I did make sure to dredge the chicken in flour before dipping in egg and also added garlic power and I didn't have potato flakes so I used Italian bread crumbs! Was a pleaser and will make again!

Tip #1 - saltines in big ziplock bag and use rolling pin to crush to very fine powder very easily.

Tip #2 - Base recipe is a little bland, but still very good. Great for cooking for people with different tastes, and individuals spice it up to personal preference.

Tip #3 - Pan frying was not very fun with my larger pieces, may have been easier, and more consistent, to deep fry this.

I wasn't blown away by this recipe but it could be because I used thighs instead of breast.  If you are also using breasts forget about the crackers because it burns before it has a chance to cook all the way through.  Just do flour salt , pepper and garlic salt in a bowl and submerge the thigh in it.  Don't even have to dip in egg first.  I gave it a four stars because I didn't follow the recipe so it may have been my fault.

Awesome. I did not have seasoned salt, so I just used regular salt. Also added some garlic powder and onion powder to the mixture for seasoning. I followed other user's advice and first dredged chicken in flour, then egg, then the mixture. I made a gravy using another recipe from this site and it was fantastic. Thanks!

Great recipe! We took the advice of other reviewers and increased the seasoned salt to a tablespoon. Next time we make this we're going to use smaller pieces of chicken (so it doesn't take as long to cook as we were practically drooling waiting) and pack the coating on even more because it was the best part! My boyfriend commented that he normally peels the skin/coating off of the chicken to be healthy, but this time he found himself eating every last crumb.

Wow, so simple and so delicious!  This has become a staple in my family for 3 years now.  I pound the chicken to an even thickness for more even cooking.  A winner every time I fix this!

Oh yum!  This was delicious!   My family loved it.
Added garlic and onion powder, but other than that, followed recipe.  Chicken was moist and the crust was crispy- just the way fried chicken should be.

This is an awesome recipe..the whole family liked it and even ate the leftovers the next day! I added some garlic powder as others suggested and bumped up the seasoning salt a bit (I actually found it to be too salty but everyone else really liked it). I also browned them in the pan and then finished them off in the oven on a rack on a baking sheet. Thanks for a great recipe.

Everyone loved it!  Next time will try and bake in the oven since really don't like dealing with pan frying. Did as others and coated with seasoned flour first then egg wash and finally with cracker coating.  Also, let it rest for about and hour before frying which helped the coating really stick.

I loved this dish!  I'm not a huge chicken fan unless it's the unhealthy deep fried kind.  :0( My husband loves chicken so I tried this as a sort of compromise and it was delicious.  Unlike other "fried" chicken recipes I've tried, this coating was perfect.  I've had issues before with it either falling off or not completely coating when I use boneless, skinless breasts.  Served it with mashed potatoes, a vegetable and gravy.  GREAT!

Made this recipe exactly as instructed--wow. I grew up eating southern fried chicken, so I know what I am talking about when I say this recipe was one of the best for fried chicken I have tasted ... and the fam agrees. The crunch of the breading was perfect. I have a deep fryer, making it easier to keep the oil at a constant temp--hot oil is a must; keep in mind if you are skillet-frying, and don't overload the skillet. This meal is excellent with mashed potatoes and a green veggie. Thanks, CASSJW.

This was VERY good.  I will definitly be making this again and again.  I made two changes to the original recipe based off of suggestions given by other reviewers.  I coated the chicken with flour before dipping in the egg and added extra spices to the cracker mix such as garlic and onion powder.  Excellent recipe!

We used several chicken pieces. Dry ingredients made of supplies on hand (Panko-ritz wheat crackers and Pepperidge Farms Stuffing mix. We added Creole seasoning (1 tsp)and garlic powder. To egg wash we added 1 tsp dry ranch dressing mix. Cooked in skillet as directed for about 10 minutes then 45 minutes in oven at 310 degrees. The end result was fabulous! Especially as this was first try for fried chicken in our house. Very crispy.
All gone

DELICIOUS!  I used 1 T seasoned salt, 1 t black pepper, and as the previous reviewer recommended, dipped the chicken in additional flour first, then egg, then coating.  So, so good.

This was great!  I add a lot more spice like the other cooks had suggested and then some.  Otherwise I made it as stated.  Made a simple roux for a white chicken gravy with lots of pepper and ladled the gravy on top.

This is good, quick, and easy, but bland.  Reading other reviews, I had added lots of spices, but it still wasn't enough.  Next time, I'll try to figure out how to up the flavorings a LOT.

I make this recipes atleast once a week.  Our family LOVES it.  I have also shared it with family & friends on Facebook.  I love garlic so I add a decent amount to the crackers before breading the chicken.

This was awesome!!  As a mom of three small boys, it's very difficult to find things that they'll eat and cooking something that everyone likes is almost impossible.  This recipe was a big hit with everyone - even the little one that doesn't like chicken!!  My 6 year old asked if I could make this every week.  It also got the thumbs up from my husband.  Thank you so much for a great recipe!

This was pretty good. The chicken tasted good, has a nice crispy coating, and was easy to make. I used up almost all 30 crushed crackers on 2 chix breasts though. I would suggest using more.  One concern I had with this meal was the 1/4 cup of olive oil that soaked right in to the chix breading. I had to add more as I cooked and the pan was dry when i served up these for dinner. Meaning, about 1/3 cup of olive oil for 2 chix breasts. High calorie. Otherwise, this meal tasted good.

I will not be using this recipe again. It was alright, but not worth the trouble. The flavor was nothing exceptional, and the texture was strange. It wasn't crispy-crumbly like you'd expect. Flour, egg, flour coating, seasoned with salt, pepper, and paprika (and maybe a dash of garlic powder) is much better. Thanks anyway, but my whole family agreed that it was not a keeper.

This recipe was interesting.  I followed one reviewer and dipped in flour, egg, then mixture. The breading stayed on GREAT, and there was a nice crunch to the chicken. HOWEVER, I think adding some garlic powder and a BIT more season salt, like another 1/2 tsp. would make this recipe perfect. The more bites you take, the more you like it, but it was just lacking something.

Although this recipe tasted good, I'm rating lower because the breading didn't stick.  I should have followed one of the reviewers suggestions of flouring the chicken prior to the egg.  Also, I recommend using thin chicken breast pieces.  Mine were pretty thick on some parts so the cooking took another 10 minutes.  It was not easy to periodlically flip them as the breading kept falling off.

This was good. My kids loved the crispy. I didn't have any saltines, but I did have 1/2 a bag of oyster crackers. I crushed them up and used them. Tasted great!! We eat a lot of chicken. This is a nice and easy change.

This was such a great recipe! I've never fried anything before today and followed the directions from another reviewer, putting plain flour on, the dip in eggs, then into the cracker batter. The finished product was amazing. I added a little McCormack's Chicken Seasoning and it was so yummy. I'm super excited to have this recipe in my new list of "standby's" and finally taught myself how to chicken fry something. Thanks for the suggestions from the other reviewers, it really helped :)

Very good. My husband did no so much care for this he dose not crunchy breading. So next time I will crush up the crackers more and try that.I did mix buttermilk in with my egg just because that is the way I always do it. I did add garlic powder as other had said but next time I will leave that out.

Wow, this was super easy to make and it made my family happy! They said it tasted like KFC chicken, especially with the mashed potatoes I made for a side. I will definitely continue to make this recipe! I did dredge the chicken through flour before using the egg and the breading stuck wonderfully! That is the only change that I made. Thank you for the recipe!

This is grrrreeeaaattt fried chicken!!! Before battering, I put the chicken 2 at a time in a ziplock bag and pound them flat with a rolling pin. I also used a TBS of seasoning salt instead. I cooked the chicken as instructed in one of the reviews and left them on one side then flipped once. I have made it twice and both times I served it with corn and mashed potatoes and white pepper gravy to top the potatoes and chicken.....can you say delicious?!!!! Definately reccomend!

I made this last Saturday night and it came out wonderful - crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  I added a little garlic powder to the coating mix since we love garlic, and also dredged the chicken in flour before the egg wash and crumbs.  Tasty!

Great Recipe. I did change it up a bit. We pounded the chicken before seasoning to make it thinner and so it would cook more evenly. I also put the chicken in flour first then egg then the mixture. This helps it stay on better :) Turn out amazing! I made this with green beans and twice baked mashed potatoes. Yum!!

I really liked this recipe i did change it up a bit like everyone else. I added into the crumbs some garlic, parsley and chives. I did as well put it in the crumbs first then into the crumbs then back into the eggs and it made the batter on the chicken thicker. The chicken breasts i used we kinda big and it took an hour to cook them so use a meat tenderizer if you have large chicken breasts. It turned out really really good and tasty! My husband loved it ... two thumbs up!

Wow, I couldn't believe how crispy and tasty this fried chicken turned out.  I didn't have seasoned salt, so I added salt, italian seasoning, and black pepper for taste.  I also followed another reviewers suggestion of dipping it into flour, then egg, then coating.  This helped the coating stay on nicer.  I made it my first time for my entire family and friends, they all loved it.

This was a hit with my family. I pretty much followed the recipe exactly ('eye' measurements) and don't think I would change a thing. My husband says its better than Cracker Barrel's CFC--his FAVE on their menu!

I thought this to be a bit bland and not crispy enough. They were greasy as opposed to crispy, but may be better with a deep fryer.

This tasted really great!  I followed other user's instructions and dipped the chicken in flour, then the egg.  These fried up wonderfully and they tasted great.  This will definitely be my go-to recipe for fried chicken from now on!

Really, really yummy. Will add some garlic powder next time or make with more flavorful crackers. I used the flour/egg combo first followed by the cracker mixture.

I added a little milk and worstershire sauce to the eggs. I also sprinkled a little seasoning salt and cayenne pepper to the bare chicken before the dredges (I dredged & breaded the chicken twice). I also deep fried them at a very high heat in a dutch oven. Very quick and easy. Very good.

i tried this recipe with legs instead of breasts (looked good in the picture). had to cook a little longer. i tossed in flour before egg, as others suggested and it worked well. very tasty (added own seasoning). definitely use again!

Great recipe!!! My husband loves it and so do I! I did as the previous reviews mentions about more seasoning, not continously turning it, and doubling the recipe. I did substitute panko bread crumbs instead of the crackers and its AWESOME!!! I even left on the skin when I cooked with drumsticks

This was very good, I baked instead of frying as per other reviews, couldn't believe that it stayed so crunchy.  Not the very best that I've had, but really good.  May try frying it next time...

First, I have to say, the name of this recipe is perfect!  exactly what kids would call it. I ran into a problem not having any potato flakes, and knew the flavor was necessary, so I threw in a handful of potato chips.  I know, sounds awful, but it really worked!  Also added a bit of parmesan cheese. Honestly this recipe is a keeper!  Chicken fried chicken!  love it!

This recipe sounds really yummy but Geeze Louise, with all this pounding it's giving me a headache and I haven't even started yet!  Why not just buy the thin sliced boneless, skinless chicken breast then cook as directed!  I'm always looking for the easier route!!

Wow, surprisingly good taste, texture and juicy- despite the simple ingredients.  It didn't need any gravy or dipping sauce.  I did make a few alterations though- used salt, garlic powder and chili powder in place of seasoned salt.  Made it with a whole chicken, dredged in flour first and used the method mentioned by a reviewer to bake on 350 for 45 mins and add a stick of melted butter and cook 5 more minutes.  The baking method is such a time-saver.  I can't wait to make this again!

I had family over tonight and I decided to try this out on them. I did one thing differently. I personally enjoy marinades, I put my chicken legs in a large zip bag and dumped a bottle of "KC Masterpiece" Zesty Lemon Pepper in there. They marinaded overnight in the fridge. The meat itself was really yummy but this breading recipe is what made it. My family loved it! My sister in law even had me write out a copy of this to take home :D   Thanks for sharing!!

This recipe is FANTASTIC.  I use boneless skinless chicken breast strips.  On my stove I can't bring the oil heat up as much as the recipe calls for or the coating burns, so I just set my heat a little lower.  I use a little more oil than it calls for as well. All 4 of my kids and my husband and I ALL love this recipe!  And the kids love crunching up the crackers for me! This is really the tastiest coating we have ever tried!

I followed the recipe exactly except for I used club crackers instead of saltines because that's what I had and I followed another reviewer's suggestion of dredging in flour before the egg (which is way better than straight to the egg. I did one without dredging first and all the crust fell off that one right away, but not the others). I don't like when people give something a bad review if they changed the recipe, but I don't think my change really made any difference on this one. It must be just me but every time I try to cook chicken on the stove it ends up burning. I had the heat turned down to almost nothing and it still burned before it got anywhere near cooked on the inside. I ended up taking it off the stove and putting it in the oven to finish cooking because I was afraid I was going to burn my house down. I'm surprised my smoke detectors didn't go off. I'll try this again but next time I'm going to bake it instead of cooking on the stove. Also, don't use whole chicken breasts unless you pound them flat because they just end up burning before they get cooked in the middle. I'll update my review when I try it again baked in the oven. I don't think it will hold a candle to the Deviled Chicken recipe on this site though. That recipe is awesome. sorry chicken fried chicken.

This is an amazing recipe! My whole family loved it and it was fairly easy to prepare. I'm 14 years old and this was my first meal i ever made for my family and no one helped me. We only had chicken thighs, so i had to alter the recipe a little bit. The thighs had to cook for 25 minutes instead of 15-20 minutes, but they were soo juicy and tender. I also used oyster crackers instead of saltines and we didnt have potatoe flakes so i left that it. I added a few more spices and it turned out great. It took me a little over an hour to cook 7 chicken thighs. It was a very rewardinr recipe and is now my special. When ever there's chicken in the house, my family wants me to make it!

I decided to make this for my husband who very much enjoys comfort food.  Let me tell you, this is comfort food at its best.  I liked the crunchy coating but I suggest not to add any more salt than what the recipe calls for.  I added a tsp of garlic salt to the recipe, thinking it was going to lack a lot of flavor due to what other reviewers had said, but it ended up being a bit too salty for me.

Holy wow this was good! I'm a total novice when it comes to frying chicken, and it doesn't usually turn out very well. This definitely changed all that. I followed the recipe pretty much exactly, except that I forgot to add the potato flakes. This was so moist and delicious I was amazed! I want to make it again tomorrow, lol! I had absolutely no problems with the breading falling off, or it being bland, it totally wasn't. I followed the tips to not flip it constantly, I gave it a good 5 minutes on each side before flipping again, and it was perfect. I will absolutely make chicken this way again!

Absolutely amazing! I had never made fried chicken before and was really worried about how it would turn out. My boyfriend and I agreed that it was the best fried chicken we had EVER had! I did mix in a lot of extra flour, and when cooking if a piece of batter fell off I would just put flour on top of it and it stayed on. This is the best recipe ever. I have already given it to my mom and a few friends and my boyfriend already wants me to make it again (I only made it the day before yesterday!). Oh, I also added a little garlic powder, onion flakes, paprika, ect. for extra flavor. UPDATE: I now make this recipe all the time. The key is to keep the oil really hot and only cook a few pieces at a time and the breading stays on. ENJOY!

Oh my gosh, this is now my favorite fried chicken recipe!  I didn't have any potato flakes, so omitted them. Also took another reviewers advice to put more spices in.  I added 1T garlic powder, 1T seasoned salt, and 1T paprika in addition to the recommended pepper.  AWESOME!  One thing that may make it easier for others that I normally do when breading anything-I use the plastic containers (disposable but reusable too)with lids that you get at the grocery stores.  It's easier to coat anything because it's easier to get the food in and out of with less mess and you can shake off the excess as well.  This recipe is so crispy and tasty!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

So so so good! I made this for 3 of my friends for the Pats/Cowboys game yesterday and they loved it! I was a little nervous since two of them are Southerners but they agreed it was some of the moistest and crunchiest chicken they'd ever had. I made some modifications such as adding garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, cayane pepper and chili powder to the mix. I also used 2 eggs and fried the chicken in a mix of vegetable, canola and chili oil. Thanks for the recommendation to cut the breasts in half and tenderize them. This recipe yielded 6 thick strips of chicken that didn't survive through half time!  Go Pats!

we've been looking for the 'perfect' coating for chicken and just couldn't seem to find the one. We've made this one our own and love it! We make some seasoned flour, (use plenty of black pepper and a touch of cayenne and a little garlic salt) dip the chicken in that first then in the egg and then in the cracker mixture. This way the coating stays on really well. And we like good and brown. Our favorite is skinless boneless chicken thighs. It's good the next day too if you are lucky enough to have any left over. Another tip: if you have extra cracker mixture left over you don't have to throw it away - throw it in the freezer, good in there for a coAs my son says, mom this chicken is 'da bomb'.

This was a treat for us since we normally don't eat fried chicken.  I cut up the breasts and it cooked quite fast and perfect - crispy on the outside.  Please measure the seasoning salt - I got a little carried away.  Would make again when craving comfort food or my neice and nephew were here.

Very tasty and easy.  I cut the chicken breasts in half, lenthwise to allow for a shorter cooking time and more chicken pieces.  Used extra virgin olive oil...Will make it again.

Yum! This was my first time making fried chicken and this recipe couldn't have been easier to follow. My only additions were to season the chicken with salt, pepper, onion powder & garlic powder... plus i added a little cayenne to the flour mixture and a dash of hot sauce to the egg. It turned out absolutely delicious. Thanks for a great dinner!

My husband loved this recipe.  Although I did use a few suggestions from the reviews and added one teaspoon of ground red pepper and two teaspoons of garlic powder.  I also used Town House crakers instead of saltines.  Definately a keeper.

I am somewhat of a chicken fried _______ (fill in the blank) connoisseur, and this is simply one of the easiest and most wonderful tasting recipes I have seen.  Great stuff.  We slightly modify the recipe by pounding the chicken a little flatter, which allows a bit more coverage of the breading and also tenderizes the meat.

This was fantastic. I did as others suggested by adding more seasoning. I added garlic salt, paprika and more seasoning salt. It was sooo good. My husband kept on saying mmm as he ate. This one is a keeper on the rotation list!

This recipe can be baked in the oven (370 degrees-ish for 30 min or till juices run clear) or fried in oil. Both are delicious. I also like to mix things up by using seasoned ritz crackers. Flavorful and buttery! mmmmmmmm!

Outstanding! Not exactly low-calorie but worth it. I love chicken fried steak but now I love this even better. I pounded chicken breasts thin- they cook up considerably faster and look nice this way. Very tender. Like other reviewer, I dipped in egg then pressed them into crumb mixture on plate to get lots of coating. I added a little extra seasoning salt, paprika and a little garlic powder. Served with country gravy, mashed red potatoes and steamed broccoli. Super duper yummy and a big hit with family. Kids dipped it in ranch dressing.

Very good recipe!  I put in 3 tbsp of potato flakes instead of 2 and added garlic powder, red pepper flakes, and paprika.  My husband and five year old both loved it.  This is also very easy to make.

Fantastic YUMMY Chicken!!!!!   Wonderful flavor, crisp on the outside and so tender on the in!  Didn’t need a knife because the fork cut right through!  (I did butterfly each breast)  This dinner was one for the record books according to my family and I think I will have to agree with them! :) Accompanying this wonderful Chicken recipe was the Garlic Mashed Potatoes Secret Recipe (posted by austad) and some steamed Broccoli with cheese sauce.  Wow, what an awesome meal – each did more than compliment one another - they went so beautifully together!  EVERYONE here on Allrecipes.com, you have gotta try these two recipes – you won’t be sorry!!  Thanks for sharing!!!!

This recipe was soooo delicious!!!  I added some parmesean cheese, paprika, and some other spices.  I dipped the chicken in the egg, then the breading, then egg, then the breading again.  I served it with mashed potatoes, gravy and peas.  I dreamt about it all night and had the left overs for breakfast!  Thanks for the great recipe!!

Great chicken - nice and tender.  I added some onion powder and cajun seasoning.  I cut the chicken breasts into strips before coating.  Then I fried for a few minutes on each side and finished cooking by baking for 15 minutes at 350 degrees.  Great with various dipping sauces - BBQ, ranch, or honey mustard.

This recipe is easiest and fits best in the pan if you cut up the chicken into bites or strips, but you have to double the coating since there is more surface area on the chicken pieces.  This is the ONLY WAY I do fried chicken anymore.  The best honey mustard recipe to go with this is 1 and a half cup mayo, 1/2 cup honey, and a 1/4 cup yellow mustard blended with a mixer.  It makes a ton of honey mustard, but it stores well in the fridge for other uses.

I found this recipe yesterday, I made it last night, and I now have a new chicken recipe added to my family cookbook. This chicken was wonderful! Such a great flavor. I did let the breaded chicken sit in the fridge for about an hour before frying it (to let it dough up for the cracker coating to stick). I will make this again and again. Thanx

This recipe rocks! It's much healthier than traditional fried chicken, and it tastes just as good! I added seasoned salt, garlic powder, a little paprika, and a bit of dry onion soup to the cracker mix. I had no problems with the topping sticking to the meat.  It's good to have the chicken as dry as possible before dredging it in the egg.  Also, when you originally lay the chicken in the pan, leave it on each side for several minutes, maybe 5 or so before turning it. This helps keep the cracker mixture from slipping off the chicken.  Lastly, I beat the chicken with the bottom of a beer bottle to flatten it. Hey, whatever works!:-) But it was DELICIOUS! I'll never fry chicken any other way!

This was ok...probably will make again, with a little bit of tweaking. The coating did not stay on as well as I hoped, and I did add a few spices, such as garlic powder, onion salt, and paprika.

Great taste, appearance and texture!  Like others, I spiced the chicken.  I made a nice gravy with the chunks from the bottom of the pan to go with peppery mashed potatoes that I served with this, plus creole corn.  This recipe is awesome!  Will try with crushed Cheese-It's sometime...

This worked out well for us.  The only thing that I did differently was to buy thin-cut chicken breasts by Foster Farms and cut each slice crosswise in 1" strips to make chicken nuggets.  It saved time for me not to pound the chicken flat (which I hate to do, so messy!) and saved cooking time as well because of the thin strips.  Thank you Cassie for a great recipe that my daughter, husband and I liked equally!

Just wanted to say thanks for a great recipe. I have already used it twice this week. The kids really like it. I used it for fried chicken and then cut the chicken up and made chicken strips. I did drudge the chicken first in four then thur the egg. I also added little seasoning salt, garlic salt and some Mrs. Dash for more flavor. The coating comes out great!! I will keep this recipe and use it everytime we make fried chicen.

A quick and easy chicken meal.  I served it with corn and mashed potatoes.
Chicken is tender and delicious.  Although, the breading didn't stick very well.  I'd 
add italian bread crumbs next time.

We love this recipe.  Only thing I have started doing is instead of dipping in egg, I use ranch dressing to add another layer of flavor. So delicious, it is my husbands favorite.

This recipe is fantastic!!! My family gobbled it up. The only change that I made was that I didn't have regular seasoning salt so I used Mediterranean. I followed the previous recommendations about flattening the breasts and soaking them in milk. I flatted mine and put them into a milk bath for an hour. Loved it!

I just made this for dinner tonight! This was so easy to make. The most time consuming part is slicing the onion / removing fat from the chicken. Use the best quality balsamic you can find. Next time, I'll use a better quality balsamic (the dish was a tad tangy, but I like tart, so it wasn't an issue for me), mix the balsamic, tomatoes & spices together before adding to the skillet (the spices tend to clump together otherwise) and add fresh minced garlic to the skillet as the breasts simmer. This dish goes particularly well with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans, although, I think I'll try it with seasoned rice (i.e. chicken flavor) & steamed asparagus or broccoli next time to change things up a bit.

This makes fantastic fried chicken. Everyone that has tried this chicken loves it. It can be time consuming to make, but it is so worth it. I have found that adding a bit of garlic salt instead of plain salt enhances the flavor a bit. I have also nixed the potato flakes (I find them unnecessary) I would also dip the chicken into the coating rather than putting it in a bag a shaking it, since the hardest part of getting this recipe down at first is learning to make the breading stay stuck. I have found that dipping the chicken in the flour before the egg (then the cracker crumbs and then another coat of pure flour) it really makes a difference. I do two coats of this.

This recipe saved the day for me when my wife was out of town and the rest of the family asked me what was for Sunday dinner. Chicken fried chicken was the reply--they never heard of such a thing. This recipe is a new favorite request.

Great way to use up some pantry items. I did add a few spices such as garlic powder and seas. salt  as suggested. The whole family enjoyed. I also baked with a touch of olive oil on pan. Great sliced over a salad.

Meh.  That's really the only word I can think of to describe this.  I cooked it exactly as written and it came out really good-lookin'.  :)  Taste is all a matter of opinion, but I found it to be bland and it didn't really live up to the rave reviews.  Really didn't think it was worth all of the effort.  Don't think I'll make it again.  Sorry.

Excellent coating for boneless pork loin cuts, too!
No lime juice handy?   Lemon juice is good.
Used 2 eggs, and Carla's "chef's school" tip of 9-17-06 on preparation.  Had enough to use for the 
 chicken that I had ready for two people, 
as well as enough left to coat two portions of boneless pork loin that I then refrigerated for two days until ready to use (so that I didnt have the same type of meal two days in a row.)

I used Ritz crackers instead of the saltines. and Old Bay seasoning for the poultry seasoning. This time it came out a bit salty. Next time I'll add no salt and see how it goes. All in all a great recipe!

The only thing I added was more seasoning (Mrs. Dash).  I had to use more oil than specified because it wasn't enough to fry the chicken.  I also had pounded out the chicken breasts beforehand to cook more evenly (and because I don't like thick chicken breasts).  I liked the coating a lot, in both taste and appearance.  Note: It would be nice if the author would include a link to the gravy recipe he/she uses.

Added a little garlic powder and parsley flakes. I split and pounded the breast because I prefer a cutlet to a thick piece of chicken. Also dusted with flour before dredging in the eggwash. Simply delicious. This is my recipe for life. Thanks CASSJW

This recipe is super easy and very delish! My family ate every bite. If my extremely picky 8 yearold eats it all it will be in our usual rotation. The only thing I did different is coat the chicken in flour before coating in egg and crackers.  It kept the chicken extra juicy :)

A very very good recipe, my first time making fried chicken at home.  I agree in that it needs a little more seasoning, and I would add more salt as I'm a salt-aholic. PLEASE be careful when you're frying, I put a bit too much oil in the pan and it splattered up onto my hand, and I'm still healing 2 wounds more than a week and a half later.  Regardless, I'll be making this recipe again now that I have some experience with it.

This recipe was very good. It was quick to make and the chicken was so tender with a nice lite coating. So much better than the frozen chicken with the thick batter like coating from the store. I only had 3 chicken breasts and just did a half a recipe no problem. I followed the recipe exactly except only did a light sprinkle of pepper as I don't care for it. If you have large chicken breasts I suggest doing a butterfly type cut on them to thin them out some so they cook evenly and the cracker coating doesn't get burnt before the center is done. I also really liked that this was not cooked in a stick of butter like many similar recipes. I thought this tasted best just made, so I would make what will be eaten that evening. This was a tasty dinner tonight, ty.

Awesome, I used 2 boneless skinless breasts into small chunks/fingers and after coating dropped in hot oil for approx 3 minutes at which time they were golden brown, I then finished them off in a 350 oven for 5 minutes and they were cooked perfectly.
I didn't have any saltine crackers so I had to substitute some crushed white cheddar crackers, because of the substitution in crackers I didn't bother with any spice and the spice level was perfect for us.
Next time I will add some buttermilk and a tsp or so of hot sauce to the egg dip for some added zip.  Thanks for posting this great recipe idea!
Forgot to mention that 2 average chicken breasts made 14 good sized chicken fingers.

Turn the heat down a minute or two before adding the coated chicken. I didn't do that and overbrowned the first piece of chicken.

Chicken was juicy. Whole family enjoyed it. Simple with very good flavor. Made a milk gravy to serve over it.  Complete hit and have made it more than once with the same postive family comments.

This is seriously good. I fry them up in olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I also don't use potato flakes, so I am not sure how much of a difference that makes. I first flour coat the chicken, then dip in egg, and then coat with cracker/seasoning mix. The only down side it is a little messy and a little long to prep and cook.

This was so good!  I did as other reviewers suggested and added a little more season salt and pepper.  I also added some Cajun seasoning.  I soaked my chicken breasts in buttermilk for 2 hours, then dipped in flour, then the egg wash, then the cracker mixture.  Great flavor - the family loved it!  Thanks for sharing!!!

This is not fried chicken but friend chicken breasts.  While tasty it improves with the use of an egg wash then flour then crackers.  It is much better with dark meat that has flavor and moisture.

I like the combination of cracker crumbs, potato flakes and seasonings. I've tried the stove-top method but frying is not where I do my best, so next time I will try the baking method. Tasty!

I would rate this 10 stars if I could.  We fried up a family pack of chicken legs and I made this as written.  The coating stays on the chicken and it is so easy to prepare.  Hubby and I couldn't wait to try it before our guests arrived.  This tastes better than our favorite chicken restaurant and is a lot cheaper too!  The aroma of the chicken frying is just incredible.  Definitely a winner!  Dipped the legs into "Bruce's hot barbecue sauce" from this site, over the top GREAT!

Very easy, very tastey.  I can't believe it tastes like traditional fried chicken. Did not change a thing, however I may have accidentally as I don't know what seasoned salt is so I used a little Old Bay seasoning.  For literal people like me potato flakes are instant mashed potatoes.  I went up and down the isles for potato flakes.  Thanks!!

This was delicious- I baked most of it and it was still very good but frying it was AMAZING! This was my first time making chicken fried chicken and it turned out great- I did do the flour, egg, then mixture like many said to do.

Everyone in my family LOVED this!  I used grass fed/free range chicken cutlets - so juicy!  I also mixed saltines with ritz-type crackers (12-grain crackers from Trader Joe's) and it gave a really nice nutty flavor to the chicken!  Will make this many times again!

Overall, this was a very simple recipe to prepare and used ingredients I always have at home, which is a definite plus!  The hubby was also very happy with this meal, which is an even bigger plus as he is pretty picky, even about fried foods.  As suggested by other reviewers, I pounded out the chicken breasts and soaked them in buttermilk for 20 minutes before breading (therefore didn't use the egg).  Also added in garlic powder to the breading.  They came out uber-tender and juicy!  However, I only used three larger chicken breasts and the amount of breading was just enough for the three - if I'd used six it would have not been near enough.  This recipe is going in the books!  Thanks!

This was a great recipe!  I'm not sure if Panko flakes are the same as potato flakes, but I used Panko flakes and had to pound each chicken breast with a meat mallot since they were so thick.  This is definately a dish I'll make again.  Tastes wonderful when served with McCormick's white gravy mix and mashed potatoes

Delicious!! Everyone loved it! I did make a couple of changes though. I had the time so I marinated the chicken in buttermilk, 2 cloves of garlic and 2 bay leaves. Left them in the fridge for 24hrs. In the crumb mixture i did follow the other reviewers advice and add more salt and pepper. I also added some dried onion flakes, a pinch of cayenne papper and dried thyme. I fried the chicken in olive oil instead of vegetable since its alittle healthier. The chicken was super moist and extra crunchy! This is definetely a favorite! Will be making it often!

This is a really good recipe but instead of using saltines, I used Ritz crackers.  Gave it a more buttery flavor even though there was nothing wrong with the other flavor.  YUMMY!

The best fried chicken I've ever made!  I used chicken thighs instead and add some garlic powder.  I made for my family and my friends and her kids.  Everyone loved it@  My husband even thought I bought them from some store.  I may wanna try to bake them the next time.

Was really good... I followed some of the suggestions and added more potato flakes, and more seasoning salt.  I think it ended up being like a tbs and a half.  then added a bit of the garlic pepper as suggested... was fabulous!  My family will definately be making this again!

This was yummy!  I love the baggie idea for tossing the chicken in the cracker mix- it made cleanup a breeze and my kids did like to crush up the crackers.  When I make this again- which I will!! I would have added more spices to the chicken, it was a bit bland.  Other than that, very, very good!  Thanks :)

Very good.  I too thought it was a bit bland for my taste.  Will expirement with some different seasonings.  Definitely get thin sliced chicken breasts.  It makes it WAY easier.  Beautiful coating.  Kids loved!  BTW - Served with Suzy's Mashed Red Potatoes from this site and green beans.  A great combo.

Yummy & very easy to make! Made it without potato flakes. (Didn't have any.) I also used smaller chicken tenders instead of chicken breast because that's what I had in the fridge. The whole family loved it! Served with mashed potatoes & veggies for dinner, then used the left-overs to make little chicken sandwiches on hawaiian roles for lunch the next day. Getting my kids to eat leftovers is a beatiful thing! I'll make this one again and again.

This is a really great base recipe! You need to add the seasonings to your liking or it will be bland. I added onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. I have to say this does not taste like traditional chicken fried chicken, I think for that effect you pretty much have to have a batter and use a deep fryer. But we still enjoyed this very much with white country gravy on top! Delicious! Also, the coating actually stayed on the chicken very well while cooking. Make sure your oil is hot before putting the chicken in the skillet or the coating will start to get mushy and fall off. After chicken has been in the skillet on high heat for about minute or so turn the heat down. Would recommened this recipe, especially if you put the country gravy on top! We used a McCormick packet of country gravy mix. YUM!! Will make this again!

I was surprised at how good these really were.  Something about the crackers makes a really flaky and delicious coating.  Pounding flat and hot oil are a must.  Good by itself, but white gravy totally takes it over the top.  Didn't take long to make either.  Highly recommend!

Loved this recipe!  Will be used again!  So simple and easy, with things you always have on hand.  I followed the advice of others and dredged in flour first.  Fried in my cast iron skillet.  Turned out perfectly... mmmmm!

Excellent! Excellent! Excellent!  Like the other reviewer I dipped the chicken in the crumbs first, then the egg and then back in the crumbs.  It really helps the breading to stick.

My family loved it and I will make it again.  However, I think that it needs a bit more seasoning. It was a bit bland for my taste.  I also will pound out the chicken breast.

This is a very good fried chicken recipe.  I did pound out the (large) chicken breasts we had to even them out and dusted with flour before the egg, and added some hot sauce to the egg.  Lacking saltines, we used "round, buttery crackers" (aka, Ritz) and added a little poultry seasoning and garlic powder to the breading.  Nice flavor and crunch.

I've made this a few times now without any changes to the recipe.  I'm impressed how delicious this lower calorie version of fried chicken is.  And it's so simple to make.  The chicken comes out very moist and flavorful, and the coating is crisp and tasty.  Definitely worth a try if you're watching your calories and you love fried chicken.

This is the best and easiest home fried chicken I have ever had.  It's not to heavy or greasy but still very crunchy.  I have to make this for my family all the time because they love it so much!  We love things spicy so I do add some spices to the cracker mixture but otherwise this recipe is perfect!

Best fried chicken ever! I added some garlic and onion powder and also some Worcestershire pepper to the cracker mix and added some Tonys creole seasoning in the egg and this was excellent! Thanks for a keeper! Will be making this again!

My family really enjoyed this chicken. I did add garlic powder and used bnls chicken legs instead of the breasts, purely financial reason,legs are way cheaper then boobs. It baked up nice and crispy. Thank you Cassjw.

So I made this last night for my family of 6, and it was a hit according to everyone, which doesn't happen that often.  I added a tablespoon of cajun seasoning to it, but I thin it would have been good even without it.  It was great served with home made mashed potatoes and sauteed corn!  Wonderful!

delicious!   Just a few additions.  I followed some of the other suggestions from other smart cooks.  I used two beaten eggs to dip into the crumb mixture made up of:  1 sleeve of saltine crackers, 2 T flour, 2T potato flakes, 1 T black pepper, 1 T seasoned salt, 1 t parsley flakes, 1 t garlic powder, 1 t paprika and 1T cajun seasoning.  I pounded my chicken breasts only semi-thin...perfection.  My husband thought it was so delicious he ate 3 pieces, so there were no leftovers to try cold tomorrow.   Will definitely make this again.  Would like to try it with all different chicken pieces.

I'm giving it four stars because it was very good but not the best I've had. I coated with flour before the egg wash and the chicken came out very moist and tender for me, and the coating was very good. To be fair it's the first time I've made fried chicken and it could be that I am inexperienced enough that it would have come out better for a more experienced cook.

It's very good made this way. I added french fried onions along with the other ingredients the recipe called for. The onions gave it a crunch that we enjoyed. My husband really enjoyed it, so it's a keeper

I didn't have saltines or potato flakes, so I searched the pantry for a substitute. The only thing I had to work with was some tortilla chips, and they worked out perfectly! Next time, I'll try the tortilla chips with the lime flavoring.

So, I defrost some chicken legs and couldn't decide what to cook and came upon this recipe. Needless to say, based on the picture I assumed that it was a recipe for fried chicken legs. After careful reading I realized my mistake and it was too late. I followed the recipes and added some parsley,garlic powder and minced onions...end results...Finger licking good!. Thanks :)

Crunchy. Golden. Tasty. Sealed in the juices. I have not been successful in creating fried chicken but my husband said this was very good. This is also a great base for adding spices and other seasonings (which I will do next time) for breading and frying other cuts of meat.

I am young single mother who is just starting out on my own and just starting to do the whole baking and cooking thing!!!! this was such an easy and delicious recipe!!! what i did different was instead of using plain dried potato chips i tried butter and herb flavour!!! since some of my family dont like onions or spices this gave it the extra flavour it needed!!!!

BEST. RECIPE. EVER.   I add some Goya Adobo and Sazon and some Italian Seasoning to the cracker mix. I also do a flour -> egg -> cracker mix to make it crunchier and tastier. I make this once a week. KFC wishes their chicken was as good as this.

Easy and good. I did the flour dredge first, and doubled the seasoning.  I kept the oil at 350 with a thermometer to monitor it.  Will make this again!

Used multi-grain crackers.. onion salt, seasoned salt.  Ziploc bag with flour, dish of egg/tsp water mixture-then the crushed crackers/potato flakes/etc.  Fried up in a fry pan.  IT WAS SOOOO GOOD!  Used drumsticks-cost effective!  LOL. My son-who HATES chicken with bones on it ATE THREE DRUMSTICKS!  Kudos to ur recipe!  I'm sure that any type of cracker u have on hand will add to the flavours! YUM YUM YUM

This was very easy and turned out perfect.  Like others I floured before I egged, and used some of my own spices in the saltine mixture.  My husband is not a big chicken fan but he said he would eat it again.

This was fantastic!  Dredged in flour before the egg and batter and added spices to personal preference.  I love what the cracker and potato breading tastes like.  Great texture!  I'm saving this one.

seriously better than KFC or others! although I did add more seasoning because I always do, but it was delicious and will be kept in my recipe box to make again. I did what other reviewers said, heat up the oil in between chickens. I used Crisco to fry mine.

Very nice recipe! I dredged the chicken in a flour/seasoning salt mixture before the egg and the saltines. Also opted to use garlic mashed potatoes mix which gives a little extra flavor to the crust. Used chicken tenders and fried for 2 minutes on each side and they turned out excellent!

I LOVE this recipe!  I only made ONE mistake but it was MY mistake & didn't have to do with the recipe itself. In the picture I uploaded, you can tell I over-cooked the chicken.  I made the mistake of not COVERING the chicken so it took longer for it to cook on the inside but as you can see, the "breading" & color of it is a great, golden brown & the taste it wonderful.  I deff. will use this again & again! TY!

This was very good - one thing to note - you can leave out the potato flakes and it is still a great recipe!  I don't keep those in the house..so I didn't put them in.

Very good, served it with Stove Top and green bean casserole, and the whole family enjoyed it. The batter was very cheap to make, too!

Pretty good, I would have to say! I used boneless breast cut in half. My oldest son thought I had made jumbo chicken nuggets, which I guess that was about what they were. I gave him the bottle of BBQ sauce and he was in heaven. Thanks for the recipe!

WOW! This was amazing. This recipe is easy and it will not disappoint you. I've been trying recipe after recipe to find a home made chicken tenders recipe that I like. I love tenders dipped in honey, but when I go out to a restaurant for them the sodium levels are so high somebody like me who is watching their sodium intake due to blood pressure runs into many problems. With this recipe I was able to control the sodium by using low sodium saltines and a sodium free seasoning mixture and still spoil myself with some outstanding tenders. I can't get over how tasty and crispy these were. I'm wondering--- can anybody tell me how long would I deep fry the pieces if I choose to make bone in fried chicken with this breading? Thank you so much CASSJW for an outstanding recipe. I will make it often.

Made this tonight. I was really looking forward to this and as other reviewers had discussed I added spices because they said it was bland. Unfortunately it was still fairly bland and I didn't like the texture of the coating. Was kind of crispy but not what I am used to. My DH felt the same way and he has been trying to get me to use saltines on chicken for years. Probably will not make make this again.

Excellent recipe! I cut it down to 2 servings for 2 big chicken breasts I had and let them sit in buttermilk for several hours before cooking.  Next time I think I'll cut the breasts in half before coating.

I had to pound and cut two breasts due to difference in size and thickness.  As a result I didn't need to fry a piece as long, and (naturally) needed additional coating ingredients.  Standing over a stovetop, tending to a dish, is not a fave pastime of mine(!), but when we're  in the mood for fried food---this recipe will be at top of list ;^)  The saltines add a very nice texture and I think it helped to cut the 'deep fried taste' of fried food (in general).  Dredged in flour, dipped in egg, then potato flakes.  Flopped pieces around in bag of crushed saltines, then fried.  All coating remained intact.  It's very good fried chicken!

This was great!!! I made it last night and everyone loved it... I put the milk and egg together in a bowl. The I took the flour, garlic powder, pepper, salt, italian seasoning and mixed it together in a bowl. Then the crackers and potato flakes in a zip lock bag. crushed the crackers up untill really fine. Took the boneless chicken first i dipped it in the flour secondly i put it in the milk and eggs thirdly I put the chicken in the zip lock bag and shook it up untill both sides is covered well. finally I turned the deep fryer on 350 degrees made sure the oil was hot and dropped it in there for 15 minutes until it was cooked all the way through It was the first thing gone!

OUTSTANDING.  Forget the cornflakes or dried bread crumbs. CRACKERS made this chicken so crispy and golden. I did use olive oil to pan fry and added cayenne pepper to the dry mix. ONE OF THE BEST uncomplicated FRIED CHICKEN RECIPES OUT THERE.

This recipe was excellent!! Saltines and potato flakes really give the chicken a good texture.  I did pound the chicken to 1/4 inch thickness so that it would cook faster without burning the outside.

I wish that I could give this a 4.5.  I'm giving it a 5, though...just because this is the first recipe for fried chicken that I've ever tried and it was very good.  I made this twice this week.  The second time, I skipped the flour and doubled the potato flakes instead.  I also used garlic salt and crushed black pepper.  I used canola oil rather than vegetable oil...trying to make this healthier.  I also made some smaller strips for my 4 year old...he loved them.  Very very easy recipe.  Thank you!  :)

Amazing!  We made it with a honey mustard sauce from this site. I cut up the thighs and made chicken fingers.  Update - This is the new recipe my husband says NOT to lose. I use 4 chicken breasts cut up which fills a chicken fryer sized pan 2x. I add 1 tsp salt, pepper, and garlic powder to the flour.  I forgot the potato flakes last time and it was still good.  I use 2 eggs and add hot sauce until they turn orange ( ala a paula deen recipe ) and I did just one shake of red pepper flakes.  This does not make it spicy, it just gives it some flavor.  My breasts are always frozen and cut and cooked when they are partially frozen, they are always really juicy.

I just made tried this recipe for my dinner tonight.  It was a definite hit, they totally loved it.  Added a few little extras for my own taste, but would highly recommend it to anyone.  A little more pepper and paprika and some Mrs. Dash - garlic and herb.  I did 6 minutes on the first side, then flipped and did another 6 on the second side...flipped and did each side again, for a total of 12 minutes on each side.  I made sure my oil was hot enough before putting them in.  It browned perfectly, nice crunch - fabulous flavor.  Will definitely make this again, that is for sure!  Even made some for leftovers as per other reviews...  Thanks so much!

I used the modifications another reviewer suggested (pounded the chicken breasts, dredged them in beaten eggs, coated them with the cracker mixture and baked for 45 minutes)  and it turned out great! Some time we plan to fry it but the breading is delicious and it made for a great baked dish. I'm not a big chicken fan and even I loved it. 

(I had to up this to 5 stars. My husband LOVES it. He asks for the "baked fried chicken" all the time.)

Yum! Recipes like this are meant for the cook to add their own spices/flavors.  I added cajun seasoning and served with white gravy, ranch dressing, and bar b que sauce.  The crunch of the chicken was great and the cajun seasoning adds a little kick.  But the best part is mixing up the dipping sauces to vary the flavor.

I am lucky I found this page again!  I used it long ago and I lost this recipes while trying different fried chicken recipes.  I think the true secret of this were the potatoes flakes, and I will be using that aspect of the recipe for a lot of different friend chicken  recipes since it adds texture and taste.


Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! The coating really did stay on and was extra crunchy. I should have ground the saltines up into much smaller pieces.  The little crumbs were taken up with the first few pieces.  I've learned my lesson and will definitely try it again.

I would have given this recipe 4 stars because it definitely needs more spices for flavor.  However, it is pretty quick to make and the leftovers are great.  I topped the chicken with shredded parmesan and broiled  it for about 5 minutes.  I placed the chicken on some spaghetti and topped with spaghetti sauce for the fastest and tastiest chicken paremesan I have ever had!  I will definitely make this again and just make sure I load on the spices.

My daughters gave this a 5 star rating.  My husband gave it a 3.5 stars, but that translates to 4.5 becuase he's not gonna give anything a 5 star unless HE does the cooking!  I say 5 stars.  I used Ritz crackers and my favorite seasoning blend.  I even omitted the egg and dredged first in milk.  I used boneless thighs and boneless breast pieces and they all turned out wonderfully.  I will definitely be making my fried chicken this way from now on!  Thanks for a keeper!

Ok, this is my first time reviewing a recipe here, and I just have to say this was EXCELLENT!  Well, following other users reviews I added more spices, not enough but that's my fault.  Other than not having enough flavor for my taste, the breading was crispy, and the chicken was tender.  The first breaded chicken recipe I've made off this site that didn't fall off while it was cooking!

I made this recipe with a small variety of seasonings i like to use, otherwise did as directed...with the exception of finishing in the oven.  I made this recipe with chicken legs and thighs, so i felt with the bones in it needed more cooking time, as my outside coating was perfect and I knew the inside wasn't even close.  Everyone liked it, all my boys 7, 16, 17, and 42!!!  Thank you for such a simple recipe.  Next time, I'll try the ritz or club crackers...I don't think you could screw up this recipe.

This was so good and so easy!  I used 4 breasts, pounded thin and seasoned.  THe coating was amazing, I use Ritz instead of Saltines (store brand works great for this), put in a little bit of Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb seasoning and this is amazing!

Simple and tasty.  I added quite a bit of spices to the cracker mix (garlic powder, cayenne, poultry seasoning).  I pan fried the chicken until golden brown and finished it in the oven.  It turned out juicy & yummy and I would make again.

Wow! Family loved it; rivaled KFC. Added garlic & onion powders, Japanese Panko bread crumbs, & a dash of Chipolte pepper for some added zing. Fried 5 minutes each side & then put in 225 oven while making the rest of the chicken. Used tenders & made enough for leftovers...was great cold in lunches with ranch dressing dip.

Loved this recipe.  Ultimate comfort food!  We had another couple over for supper that night and they also gave it rave reviews.  Made it exactly as the recipe stated, except that I fried it in bacon grease...mmmm mmmm good!  Also served corn on the cob, large garden salad, and cream gravy/mashed potatoes.  Such a feel good meal.  Thanks for sharing.

I cut my chicken breasts into tenders and added extra spices to the flour mixture (chicken seasoning, paprika, extra pepper, a smidge of cayenne).  It turned out fantastic!  Dipped in honey mustard, these tasted a lot like chicken tenders you would get at a restaurant except for these are not deep fried.  I will make these often.

Very tasty and easy to make.  I did slice my chicken breasts in half so that it would not take as long to cook.  I will add a few more spices to perk it up a little bit next time.  But all in all, this is a really good recipe!  Thanks for sharing:)

I thought this was a great recipe.  I made it as written and it turned out great.  I did end up using a tad more oil because I had a large frying pan.  I also made a Country Gravy to go with it.

This was amazing.  The only did 2 things different.  I used Panko crumbs (Japanese bread crumbs), with the crackers, and for about half the chicken pieces, I added a good handful of coconut!!  Yum Yum Yum.  My whole family devoured it.  I made it again (without the coconut) and used it for a chicken Parmesan.  Totally Awesome!!

I didn't have chicken breasts in hand so I fried chicken wings, and it turned out soooo good!! I have to say better then KFC, now that speaks for it self. Here's a little trick, first I seasoned the wings with salt pepper and garlic powder. Also I doubled the seasoned salt and pepper. This was so good that even my picky eating husband loved it too! 'Thanks for the recipe. =)

I cut up the chicken breasts and made popcorn chicken so that I could dip it in different sauces, such as ranch and bbq sauce.  My wife and I both loved it! We did think it could have been a bit more flavorful with a few more added spices.  Next time I'll add more flower and cajun seasoning and try to make it crunchier!  Will continue to make! Great idea!!

This is how my family has always made skinless boneless poultry!  I couldn't get enough as a kid-it's GREAT chilled.  Now that i'm older I use a ton of spices, including garlic and paprika, in the breading mix.  I suggest using 1, or even 2, of your favorite crackers for the crumbs and add an equal amount of potato flakes.  Also- if you're not a fan of pounding, it's easier to just butterfly the pieces.

This breading recipe is awesome.  It made my chicken so flavorful, plus tender on the inside and perfectly crunchy on the outside.  I cut my chicken into smaller strips, and they tasted just like  chicken fingers from our favorite restaurant.  I served them with leftover hot mustard packets from McDonald's-DELICIOUS.

I made this as baked chicken strips. It was a little underwhelming for my tastes, but the kids loved it! I served it with dips of honey and ketchup. I baked it for 25 minutes at 400 (olive oil covering bottom of pan). Then, I poured melted butter all over and baked about 20 minutes more. Will make again.

This was a great base for a chicken recipe. I dipped my chicken in a mixure of 1 egg and 1/2 cup of whole milk before coating w/cracker and flour mixture. I then let my checken rest for 1 minute before placing in the oil. All in all this recipe is a keeper.

With 2 young girls and a finicky husband, trying new recipes is always a challenge.  Needless to say, this recipe "rocks"!  There were no leftovers and I made a pound and a half of chicken! Definately a keeper.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!

This recipe was great. These were the changes I made:  I added garlic powder & garlic salt to the cracker mixture and I did not add the potato flakes (i forgot). I seasoned the chicken with garlic powder & oregano. The chicken was great and very crunchy. I also made some chicken gravy that was excellent. Thanks for the recipe!

We added a heaping spoon of ranch dressing mix to the cracker mixture and it had a great flavor. Our favorite restaurant serves this dish with pepper gravy on the chicken which I will definitely add the next time I make it. I'm normally not a huge fan of plain fried chicken so I felt it needed something more.

The chicken was so crisy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  I added a little garlic to the recipe for flavor.  My family thought it was the best chicken tenders they'd had in a while.

The left overs make great sandwiches!

I'm new to the cooking thing and tried this recipe - I coarsely chopped the saltines but next time I will crush them completely.  I noticed that the finely chopped saltines stayed on the chicken where as the coarse fell off.  My store did not have boneless chicken so I had to use with bone - it took forever to cook.  Definitely go with boneless!

Tried this recipe for supper this evening, and loved it!!  I used the chicken to make chicken burgers with mayonnaise and lettuce.  They tasted almost as good as KFC!!  I didn't have any potatoe flakes, but I did have potatoe flour (similar to corn starch)and I used this in place of the flour and omitted the potatoe flakes. I also added some onion powder for a little more flavour. The cracker coating fries up really nicely.  This is a great recipe for when you feel like having something "comforting" with lots of fat and calories.  A great weekend meal!!

My husband loves this recipe! I couldn't belive it b/c he's so picky when it comes to fried chicken. It comes out real crisp and tasty. He likes spicy food so I think next time I will add a dash of chilli powder to the batter. I will make this again I am sure.

Kept the chicken very juicy & tender.  I didn't have to use any extra oil.  Serve immediately - the breading will start to fall off the longer it sits.

The whole family liked this one.  Granted, my son is not a very picky eater (he'll try anything once) but that has no bearing on this recipie.  My wife and my son both went back for seconds - so that should say it all right there.  Try this one... you'll like it!

Nice crispy coating. Definitely needs some added seasoning. Make sure the crackers are crushed up very finely.

I think this recipe is great! I read the reviews first and of course tweaked it a little. I used one whole package of saltine crackers, some salt, some pepper, some cayenne, some garlic salt (I don't measure). Instead of potato flakes (unavailable) I used maybe about a cup to a cup and a half of Frosted Flakes, and crushed-pulsed everything in a food processor then put it in a gallon ziplock. I also pounded out the chicken in a gallon zip lock and used two eggs instead of one. Good luck and enjoy!

It was probably my technique, but this was a total failure.  The coating burnt and fell off the chicken, then the chicken itself didn't cook. I was careful about the temperature and followed the recipe exactly.  Guess I need to try again.

I did this recipe last night and it turned out really good. My wife who is a picky eater snubbed her nose at the thought of it but when it was all said and done she was asking for seconds. I changed up some things though and used my own spices I normally would use for chicken great recipe though.

This was my first time to actually fry chicken and I'm almost 50!  Hubby said "wow, this is good"!  I did take other user suggestions and dipped the chicken in flour first.  Thank you CASSJW for a great recipe!  I have to check out your other recipes for more gems!!

Wonderful recipe.  I use extra thin sliced chicken breasts so it's quick.  I add 1 tsp garlic powder and 1 tsp paprika to the cracker mix and then I dredge in flour first, then egg, then cracker mix.  This is my picky son's favorite chicken recipe.  My husband and I love it too.

Excellent fried chicken. So delicious! I made this a while ago and I remember the breading sticking better. This time it kind of fell off in spots. Perhaps I took the advice of other reviews last time and did the flour, then egg, then breading mix. I'll probably try that next time. Also I think I used too big of pieces, they were leg and thigh combo pieces. Next time I'll just do legs and thighs separately.

This is a staple at our house! My husband took left overs to work and got many compliments from his fellow co-worker! I also make country fried gravy (the white gravy) to go on top. McCormick's is the best if you don't have time for homemade. But this is easy to make and the batter sticks to the chicken like glue! No bald spots!

I've never had such a crunchy coating on my chicken.  I used chicken breasts pounded thin so they would cook through quickly and I dredged them in flour before the egg and crackers as suggested by another reviewer. Mine weren't dry or bland, so I'm not sure why others had that problem.  I will never use another fried chicken coating recipe,  this one's the best!

This is the best fried chicken recipe I have tried so far...and I have tried many.  The crackers are crispy and the chicken is juicy!  I was wondering how this would taste if I tried those butter crackers?  I think I will try next time.  Thank you for the recipe!  :D

We now make this once a week.  Everyone loves it.  If I buy the thick breasts, I split them down the middle (butterfly like) I flour first (which I season, use your imagination) then dip in egg (I need 2 eggs) I used crushed club crackers the first 3 times I made this (which was soooo good!) but this last time I used chicken in a biscuit crackers and this put it over the top!  I used a med hi heat and just cooked until they were golden brown, they were perfect (let sit for a few min on paper towels before eating)

I wish I could give this 10 stars !!!!!  This coating is out of this world good !!!!!!  I used unsalted topped saltines (we are salt sensative) put the entire sleeve of crackers in my mini food processor and crushed then I addd the rest of the ingrediants in the large ziplock bag exactly as written.  I had bought boneless skinless chicken cutlets because they were on sale and I am glad I used the thinner pieces of chicken.   I decided to dredge the chicken in flour, then in the egg and then in the cracker crust.  Heated up the oil in my deep fryer to 375 and fried for about 8 minutes until golden brown.  This fried chicken was wonderful !!!!!!  Thank You for sharing.

My husband wanted some good fried chicken that was a little spicy.  I followed other users' suggestions of adding garlic powder, onion powder, and extra seasoning salt.  I also added some red pepper flakes for spice.  It was great!

So, this was my first time frying chicken, and I'll admit that I was not prepared for it. This is a very harrowing thing to do for the first time (and without tongs, no less)! I managed not to set the kitchen on fire, and produced some very tasty-looking fried chicken at the end.

However, the reason I am giving it two stars is because, made exactly the way the recipe is written, this tastes exactly like crackers on top of chicken. It needs a lot more flavor and seasoning, as several other reviewers stated, and I was disappointed in the outcome. I will have to play around with this more after I get up the nerve again, but the take-home lesson here is to come armed with additional ingredients, because these alone will not do it.

Absolutely FANTASTIC!  I did not use the seasonings called for in the recipe...instead, I used Excalibur Steak rub...and OH MY GOSH it was out of this world!!!  I took the advice of a lot of the reviewers and dredged in flour first, then egg, then the crackers.    My entire family loved this, even the picky 7 year old :)  Will be making this again, for sure!

I followed the advice of some reviewers to add additional 1 tsp of garlic powder, 1 tsp of seasoning for fear of the bland taste.

However, to our personal preference, both me and hubby found that chicken turned out to be rather bland in fact, albeit all the rave reviews it has received so far... 

But the saltine cracker + potato flake coating does produce an exceptionally crispy chicken, I must admit. 

Would not do it again:(

After reading the reviews I improvised by using panko bread crumbs, parsley, salt, pepper and Cajun spices.  Used only one egg for dipping the chicken pieces (took the skin off some but not all just for comparison).  I dipped the chicken pieces in egg and the seasoned bread crumbs, letting them air dry 1/2 hr.  Then sprayed a shallow pan w/ Pam and baked @ 350 as directed.  The chicken was crispy and plenty moist.with more than enough grease considering the small amount of oil used..My family loved it!!! Next time I will bake in the Foreman grill.

I didn't have potato flakes so that might have affected the final crust. Overall, it was very juicy, but the flavor was lacking.

This recipe was SO good!!!  I used 3 chicken breast, cut into strips and needed 2 eggs instead of just one.  I also didn't have any potato flakes, but it still turned out fantastic!  Absolutely delicious!  Thank you for sharing!

Someone HELP me! I consider myself a pretty good cook but I have never had any luck frying chicken. This recipe looked really good so I gave it a try. Dredged it in flour, then egg, then cracker crumb mixture. Oil was hot. When I first turned the chicken over, I was thrilled at the beautiful crust. When I turned it again, my beautiful crust came off. Am I turning it too much, oil not hot enough or too hot? Someone help!! The chicken was very good, though.

Great recipe!! I have never been successful with fried chicken, but this came out perfect! The chicken was so juicy & the outside was mice & crunchy. I did add about a tsp each of paprika & garlic powder, and a little more potato flakes to the bag. I pounded out the chicken breast so they'd be even thickness, then cut into chunks. I then coated with flour first as another reviewer suggested, then dredged in the egg, then tossed in the zip lock baggie. Make sure your oil is very hot before putting the chicken in. Awesome recipe!!!

This recipe is sooo good! Great as is! We have also switched the potato flakes for corn meal and it was equally delish! I cooked it on med high heat for 8 min per side, turning only once, then finish off in the oven for 15min at 350 degrees. It was still so juicy andcrispy!!

I didn't really change this recipe, I omitted the salt because I use salted saltines! I coat all the chicken and throw it in my deep frier for 8 minutes and voila!

These aren't the best microwaved the next day but they're delicious when they first come out!

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe. I ran out of the saltine cracker mix though so I would add a few more in for good measure.

Yumba tasty chicken.!! Thank you for posting this recipe. ( I also put the chicken in the flour first, followed by the beaten egg, then the crushed cracker mix. )   Thanks again.!!

I never review a recipe the first time making it, but this was the best chicken that i have EVER ate! I added garlic powder, seasoning salt, and cayenne pepper to the cracker/flour mixture and Holy cow it was AWESOME!

Literally the best fried chicken I've ever had. And it makes me proud that I am the person who made it! Exactly how the recipe calls is best -but I have made it without the potato flakes and it turns out fine. Also, the reccomendation to dip the chicken in egg, then flour, then mixture is hands down the best way to make this!!

So good! Ok, I was inspired by this recipe and here's mine:
- some garlic pita chips
- some regular pita chips
- some cornflakes
- flour and potato flakes as called for here
- seasoning is paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, very fresh ground black pepper, salt

1. Slice chicken thin
2. Beat your meat
3. Season meat (left over seasoning goes into greasing)
4. Cornstarch meat
5. Egg meat
6. Bread meat
7. Fry meat
8. Eat meat

Was so simply to make. I used chicken breast and slices them into strips worked great, The color was awesome the perfect golden brown color. would make again but may take some suggestions from others and add some additional seasonings.

I must admit - I was a little wary of the saltine crackers in the recipe but I was pleasantly surprised. My family LOVED it! It could not have been easier to prepare. My family was fighting for seconds!

Excellent!!  One of the few main dishes I've made that EVERYONE in my family of picky eaters will eat.  Yippee!! I'm sure the recipe is wonderful as written, however, I added a stick of butter to the oil for frying (my mom's "secret ingredient :-) ).  I dredged the pieces through flour, then egg and then shook it in the cracker mixture.  Very, very good recipe!!

I can't believe I didn't review this one already. This recipe has become a family favorite and we have made this countless times! This by far is the yummiest chicken fried chicken I have ever had. Just thinking about it makes me want to go make it again! I've used the cracker crumb mixture for other meats as well and it always has a really great crunch to it. Highly recommend this one, I'd give it more stars if I could!

This meal was good, but nothing special.  It was similar to Shake n Bake, but with less flavor.  Good for a family dinner, but not something I'm going to pass on through generations.

My family and I loved this.  The chicken turned out very tender.  I forgot to buy the seasoning salt, so I added some garlic powder instead.  And next time, I will pound the chicken to make it thinner...just personal preference.  I have a hard time getting my 5 year old to eat much meat, but she loved this one.

What a great coating for fried chicken! I'll be using this again. I didn't make it exactly as written but close enough. I did follow the one review about dredging in flour, then in the egg, and then into the crackers. Did the frying in an electric skillet at 350* and cooked until the internal temperature got to 180*. The chicken was very moist but not one bit rare. Thanks for the recipe!

Used club crackers (all I had) and substituted Old Bay for the seasoned salt but otherwise made exactly as directed. This was really fantastic. Absolutely loved the flavor with combined ingredients. It browned up beautifully, too. Thanks for sharing, CASSJW.

I thought this was very good!  My husband really liked it and my picky 8 year old son really liked it a lot.  He couldn't get enough of it.  I couldn't find potato flakes, but I used panko bread crumbs like others did.  Will definitely be making again!

I would rate this a 5, but changed it.  Sure it is wonderful as written, but added extra ingredients.  This is what I did - as other suggested I used an egg, but also added two tablespoons of Ranch dressing.  I also added two finely chopped jalapenos.  Instead of the saltines I used Keebler Buttery Garlic crackers.  It was very moist and we loved it.  I am thinking about adding chopped pecans to it the next time without the jalapenos.  Just all kind of things you can do with this wonderful recipe. Thanks CASSJW for a fantastic recipe.

Well it was easy and my family liked it alright, but to me, it just didn't have a lot of flavor.  The chicken was nice and juicy, but I just would have preferred more flavor.  Thanks though.

I have never written a review but this recipe deserves it.  I made chicken strips/nuggets.  Crispy and moist.  Absolutely looove it.  Skeptical about crackers and potato flakes but it is the bomb.  Deep fried mine and my kids are begging for more but there is no more because they ate them all.  Thanks so much for the fabulous recipe.  Def a keeper.

Oh wow! Very delicious!! The crust is so crunchy. The chicken is moist and full of flavor. Only thing that I added was a 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder.

This was a good recipe. The breading was delicious! I couldn't believe that something so simple was soooo good! The only thing was that some of the breading fell off when it was baking. Other than that, wonderful!

I love this recipe!!!!  I ran out of crackers, so made breadcrumbs from toasted bread, seasoned it as recipe calls for.  I also used thin chicken breast, because that's what I had on hand.

excellent recipe. I read some of the other reviews and added their advice about coating chicken in flour before dipping it in the egg and then the cracker mixture. It worked very nice, and my chicken was amazing. this one is a keeper!

I took the advice of others and added some garlic granuels to the coating mixture.  There were 4 of us eating so I fixed 5 chicken breasts.  After you pound them out with a little water in the plastic bag, they are REALLY big.  I baked them as suggested and they were the biggest hit of the week!  I had so much left over that my husband and I had supper the next night (it REALLY is good the next day) and sent some to friends for their supper.  This is a GREAT recipe and sooooo good!

Great - have to read the reviews and figure out how to make it a little crispier and maybe mix up the seasoning a bit, but definitely met our desire for fried chicken for dinner.  Easy and the kids helped to make it.

So crispy outside and soft, juicy in the inside. As someone suggested I dipped chicken in flour with salt and pepper, then in egg, then in crackers. Will make them again and will use more salt pepper, garlic powder and herbs.

This was ok. I ended up adding some Tony Chachere's cajun seasoning and that really added flavor. Without it, it was really bland.

Absolutely fabulous!!! Added a little garlic powder into the breading for more flavor. Entire family gobbled it up and told me to make it again! I served this with Sweet Restaurant Slaw and baked beans. Will definately add this to my menu!!!

Tried this tonight & the whole family loved it!  Only thing I did different was flour, egg(I used 2), then cracker mixture.  Added extra black pepper & garlic powder to the cracker mix.  I fried the chicken using 1/2 c. oil in a cast iron skillet.  The chicken was crispy on the outside and tender & juicy inside.   Even with using boneless, skinless chicken, the coating held onto the chicken beautifully.  I'll definitely make this again!

WOW!  Simply an outstanding recipe!  I used boneless thighs and added a little paprika and this was awesome!  I breaded more than I fried and froze them to make later, should be an awesome quick dinner.

The most picky eater I know of LOVES this recipe. As I'm not a great cook by any means, that speaks volume to me about how wonderful and SIMPLE this recipe is! The only change I made was adding a dash of paprika to the bag. Adding seasoning salt might also be a good tactic. If you have big pieces of chicken, you should try using a mixing bowl to coat your pieces. Much

My kids loved this, and it was so much faster than making fried chicken for my large family.  I did as suggested by some people and dipped in flour first, and I also added a bit of poultry seasoning to the cracker mixture.  I made a veloute sauce with the drippings to serve with it.  This was excellent.

This fricking awesome I use either boneless thighs or boneless breast and they are so moist.  Another idea is take away the crackers and use chicken strips if possible cook in a deep fryer.

Scrumptious! I read this recipe off the top of my head last night after scamming the recipe yesterday. I did flour then egg then saltine mixture and I added lots of pepper,garlic salt,season all and even a tinge of parmesean & romano and topped it with some white pepper gravy...this will def be a staple from now on.

Pretty good for a week night meal. I used boneless skinless breasts, that was the only ingredient change and I started them out in the skillet but then transferred to the oven at 350 for about 20 minutes (like another reviewer- I am also afraid of undercooking chicken). Will make again, maybe with a little more seasoning salt or pepper next time. I think this coating would make excellent chicken fingers.

This recipe is great and super easy! The saltines were an interesting yet delicious way of making it so tasty.  Ate alongside some garlic mashed potatoes & a green salad. Perfect meal! Definitely will keep this one in mind for future crowd pleasers.  One thing I might add next time: a little parmesan to the mix.

I've used this recipe about 6 times and absolutely love it.  I do take the chicken breasts and pound them to thin them out.  I really enjoy not having  all the leftover oil that one has with deep-frying.

I'm still looking for a fried chicken recipe to beat my own, but this one was very good! As I usually do, I seasoned the egg and chicken pieces with additional salt and pepper. I used Ritz honey-butter crackers instead of plain saltines, and they added a nice taste. All in all, a great recipe! Thanks, cassjw!

Maybe I did something wrong.  My daughter tried it and loved.  I tried but would just as soon have Shake and Bake.  Don't get me wrong, it was good chicken, but there are easier ways to make good baked chicken.

Great basic recipe! Easy to adapt to any taste bud too! I omitted the potato flakes and did the double dip thing. First flour, then egg/milk then the crackers with salt, pepper and garlic. Very tasty!

I made the recipe as written, except dipped the chicken in flour first as other reviewers suggested, and cut the breasts into strips instead of frying the breast whole.  Absolutely *awesome*!  So flavorful!  My daughter and her friends ate almost the whole batch and left one strip for me.  Definitely a recipe I will make again ... and again!

Awesome recipe!  The flavor is great, and the crust is never soggy.  I also pound my chicken to "even" out the thickness, and as another reviewer suggested, I also coat with flour before dipping in egg and then crumbs.  After dredging, I let the chicken sit in the fridge for about 20-30 minutes to "set" the coating.  I think this makes a big difference.  I usually add a few drops of Louisiana Hot Sauce to the egg mixture just to give the flavor a little boost.  But, it is wonderful just the way the recipe stated also.  Try this for your Chicken Fried Steak and Chicken Fingers as well.  Very good!!

I was a little nervous about coating the chicken with saltines, but I fiegured with so many positive reveiws I had to try this recipe. Well, I was pretty darn impressed.  It was delicious. I used unsalted crakers and just seasoned using Lawry's seasoning salt and onion powder. Great chicken.  Will make again.

Loved this fried chicken recipe! Adjusted the recipe for 3 and it worked great for 2 chicken breasts. Used Lawry's seasoned salt and threw in a dash of garlic powder. Breading was not only nice and crispy, it stuck well to the chicken! Bravo!

This is a fantastic recipe and very easy to make. My family is too  picky but they loved it. My husband said it was the best chicken he had ever had! He said it even tasted better than his Aunt that was known for her fried chicken. It's even great heated back up.

Good, but the time suggested for cooking was too short.  Chicken was still pink and needed to cook for another 5 minutes making dinner a bit late.

We loved this recipe!  I didn't have crackers, so I used 1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs with the rest of the ingredients.  I did follow other reviewers and breaded the chicken with flour, then egg, then the crumb mixture.

Fabulous.  I have to confess that I have never fried chicken before, but the reviews were so good that I gave it a shot.  Turned out perfectly.  We had recently been to a pricey restaurant known for it's fried chicken.  THIS was better -- way better.  I turned up the seasonings a little for personal taste.  The crackers don't add as much salt to the recipe as you might think, so maybe add a bit of salt.  I soaked my chicken breasts in salt water for an hour or two before frying.  An instant family favorite.

MMMM So good!  Added some additional spices to the cracker, flour mixture and dipped chicken breasts in flour, then egg, then the crackers.  Fried up nice and golden and crispy, it was just perfect!  Just have to turn down to about medium low after the chicken browns on both sides so it doesn't burn while it continues to cook through.  Served with mashed potatoes, corn and biscuts.  We loved this!

Really really good!  I ran out of seasoned salt so I used garlic salt instead.  My boyfriend came over for dinner and didn't let me forget to send some home with him!

Yum!Yum! My three sons LOVED crushing the crackers---they can destroy somethingand not get into trouble!:)
I made two batches,one as recommmended and another spicy for my husband and me.
I added cajun spices, hot chili powder and pepper flakes to give the flour a kick. I did dip in flour, then egg, then breading flour mixture and it came out crunchy and juicy---most excellent!
Paired with cole slaw and pinto beans, this is comfort food! Great recipe!

This is a great recipe although I ended up using more oil.  You can also throw these in the oven and bake them.  Just flip them about half way through.

I also added 4 T of butter halfway through the fry time to give it more flavor since I am from the South!

I cooked bone in chicken pieces in the electric skillet on 375 for 45 minutes.

This chicken was awesome!

Tasted better than a restaurant favorite! I didn't have the potato flakes but it still turned out perfect. Dip the chicken twice in each to get a coating that stays nicely.

By far, this was the best chicken fried chicken recipe to make with boneless, skinless chicken breasts!  I didn't have the potato flakes, but the recipe turned out great anyway.  I did add some garlic powder and some parsley flakes (for color).  When the chicken looked done, I finished it in a 350 degree oven, just to make sure that it was completely cooked through.  I would NOT use thick chicken breasts...pound them out if you have fresh, thick ones.  My kids liked this, especially when dipped in gravy.
A big thumbs up from this (usually NON) chicken lover!

This was delicious! I actually followed the recipe almost exactly, which is unusual for me. I did use boneless skinless chicken, as it's what I had. I also dredged the chicken in flour before the egg bath. Left the seasoning pretty much the same, except bumped up the pepper a bit. Wonderful chicken and even great cold the next day!

The best fried chicken I have ever made!!!!I would say close to the best I've ever had,and I'm very picky about fried chicken.I did change just a few things, I added a little ranch dressing and water to the egg...Then into the breading I added onion and garlic powder, and some paprika...I also cheated and used my fry daddy...I am not that great with pan frying....But THANK YOU....SUPER YUMMY!

Easy recipe to follow, the salitine mixture adhered perfectly this recipe is the first fried chicken that I have tried that has turned out so good.  One thing I would reccommend is add quite a bit more spices to the mixture to give it more flavor.

I have used this recipe over and over again. Only changes I make is to use a package of Ritz crackers and make sure and turn chicken every 3 minutes for 15-20 minutes. Keeps the coating on and cooks to perfection.

Such an easy way to make fried chicken! I added some panko to the flour mixture for some extra crunch and also some texas pete to the egg beat! It was fast, easy and delicious! I served it with the rosemary red potatoes from this site! A staple recipe, thank you!

This recipe was very tasty even with some modifications.  I did not have any potato flakes on hand, so I omitted them.  After coating the chicken with the egg and cracker mixture, I placed the pieces in a baking dish.  I then cut up a stick of unsalted butter into small pats and added them to the tops of the chicken.  I baked the dish for 45 minutes and presto, we had a delicious meal!  This recipe was a hit with my husband and little boys, all of whom are very picky.  I am looking forward to trying this recipe with the potato flakes as well.

That's the key to cooking fried chicken, hot, hot when you first put it in, don't turn too frequently. Takes a while and practice so don't give up. Took me a few years to master the chicken frying. Now (I think because I was taught Southern cooking) I'm the best at it.

Wonderful!  We had this for dinner tonight and my husband said that I should open a restaurant! So easy!  I added Spike All Natural seasoning instead of seasoning salt (I ran out!) and marinated the chicken in a vidalia onion salad dressing for a little while before frying. I cut up the chicken into strips/chunks, skipped dipping them in the egg since they were already goopy from the salad dressing and fried them in the deep fryer for about 4-5 minutes at 360 degrees. WOW!  It was so easy and I didn't want to mess with the pan frying. Thanks for a great recipe!!

First off this is an excellent base recipe that does need a bit of spices!  It was so great that I burned one and it still tasted great :) What I did was added 35 or so Honey Ritz Crackers, then added 1/2 a teaspoon of salt, 1 tblspoon pepper, 1 tblspoon garlic, 1 tblspoon basil, 2 tblspoons parmesan, a handful of total corn flakes, 2 tblspoons of flour and blended it in a high power mixer. The result smelled great and after using 2 egg yolks and thinly cut chicken I cooked them on low fire for 5 minutes on each side using the suggestion of switching to high immediately between placing new strips of chicken. The crust is crunchy and delicious and the inside is oh so yummy. The only downside is that I had to use a lot of oil, but still the result is heavenly.

The only complaint I had was the lack of seasoning, for my taste it requires alot more seasoning. I liked the texture of the breading and the ease and availability of the ingredients. Would definitely make again but add alot more seasoning but overall a very good recipe.

This is great I used Captain Crunch cereal instead of crackers and cornstarch instead of potato flakes it tasted really great with honey as a dipping sauce.

I made this recipe for my boyfriend and brother and it is definitely "man approved". I especially loved how well the coating stuck to the chicken. I didn't have any country gravy on hand so I served it with chicken gravy and it turned out awesome! Pair with mashed potatoes and biscuits and it is comfort food at its best...no leftovers with this one!

This is one of the best fried chicken recipes I've ever tried. I did add some extra seasonings to the chicken (salt, pepper, basil, garlic powder)but other than that I followed the recipe to a T and the results were great- moist but crispy. Yum!

YUM! YUM !YUM! This was so delicious!!! i used the advice of one of the reviews in allowing my oil to heat back up in between pieces of chicken, it came out perfect. I served mine with "Unbelievable Rolls" from this website. I also used PANKO instead of bread crumbs. I just prefer the texture. it was a huge hit with my family!!

WOW !! I was a fried chicken failure until this. Simple and excellent. Next time I would definitely add more black pepper. I put the chicken in the fridge for about 20 minutes after breading so that it would stick and they came out beautiful. I wish I had taken pictures. A definite Do-Over

Excellent! Just like my grandma's recipe! I added a tad more salt and lot of fresh pepper. Make sure the pan is hot to get a good crust.

Fabulous!  I added a packet of Hidden Valley Ranch dry seasoning mix to the crackers, flour & potato flake mix & skipped the salt and pepper.  This turned out so yummy, my boyfriend loved it and I will be making this again for sure.  I can't wait to experiment with this next time.

I loved this recipe! I used some garlic salt instead of seasoned salt. And I used club crackers because I didn't have any saltines. That gave it a nice buttery taste. Chicken was moist and crust was crunchy. Cut up the cold leftovers the next day and put them on top of a salad. Yummy!

This was great, followed the recipe but used strips of boneless/skinless chicken breast. It was golden but not as crispy as I like so next time I will fry longer. Yummy flavor, excellent texture and very juicy and tender. My kids loved it, too.

We loved the light crispiness of this chicken. I will definitely try this again, just trying to figure out the right way to spice it up a little. I used thin chicken cutlets which were cooked perfectly by the time it was nicely browned.  Tender and juicy.

I gave this a 4 because I had to add to it to make it a 5.  I did as directed and then put the chicken in my le cruset pot, covered it with cream of mushroom soup (with a layer of it underneath so it wouldn't burn), put foil loosely over it, baked for an hour at 450 and then served over rice.  Pretty darned good like that and more like my Dad's favorite version of chicken fried steak.

This was my second attempt ever at making fried chicken.  My first was chicken tenders.  I was terrified of chicken fried chicken, and it turned out great!  I think I had my heat too high to start off with, so it cooked faster than I thought it would, but it was very tasty none the less!   I did do one thing different, I put in half as much flour and added corn meal.  And I added a tablespoon of Adobo seasoning.  Great recipe!  Thanks!

This recipe was pretty good, my husband, who is pretty hard to please said "this is some killer chicken" and my son devoured it.  So i guess i would have to say its a winner in this house, good job! By the way, i used ritz crackers instead and it gives it way better taste!

This came out so good.  I left out the potato flakes (since I have no clue what they are) and added some garlic powder to the coating mix.  Excellent.

Tried this recipe (because I am a picky eater and do not eat meat/poultry with bones) and LOVED it! Tried it on my husband, he thought it was great, so I decided I would try it at work and the guys went crazy over it. I now get special requests for the Chicken Fried Chicken. It has a nice crispy outside and tender inside. I highly recommend this recipe to anyone considering trying it.

the crust on this is very thick and crunchy--much easier than traditional with no loss of flavor!

fast and easy way to make chicken. Best to pound chicken to uniform thickness and to add additional spices as suggested.

I loved this recipe. It was my first time making chicken fried chicken and it was pretty easy. I would have given it a five with my minor changes. After reading other reviews, I added much more spices/flavor to the crumb/batter. I added cayene pepper, paprika, lemon pepper, lots of ground black pepper, garlic salt, and oregano. We love lots of flavor and hubby said it could have used even more spice/flavor to it.
I also used more oil than listed...just enough to really cover the bottom of my large pan.

Really loved this! Tasted good, but I did add seasonings based on other's opinions: 1 extra tbs potato flakess, 1/2 tsp paprika, 1/2 tsp cumin, 1 tbs parmesan cheese. The coating stayed on pretty well, and I used boneless chicken tenderloins to cut on cooking time. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Wow was this chicken fabulous - and so easy!! The chicken turned out super tender and the breading was great. I cut the chicken breasts into long strips and then breaded them. I added these chicken strips to a cob salad and it was fantastic - a nice healthy meal. The hubby was a huge fan! - Definitely a keeper.

This was quite good, although I had no potato flakes, so I had to omit them.  And I think I should have crushed the saltines into a finer crumb, because they didn't mix into the spice/flour mixture enough.  But the taste was marvelous; I served it with cream gravy from another recipe on this site.  Thanks for the post--I've always wanted to try making this dish.

YUMMY! This is one of my first times trying to fry anything, and I couldn't be more pleased with the outcome! I did, however, change a few things. As some of the other members suggested, I pounded the chicken before cooking it, and tinkered with the combination of seasonings. I cooked two small tester breasts to check the flavor of the crust, in the end, I added about 4 tablespoons of seasoned salt to get the flavor I wanted. All in all, this is a great recipe and I will definately add this to my list of dinner ideas! Thanks!

all the positives I read in others reviews are all true - 
they were just like chicken fingers - breading didnt fall off the chicken as it usually does with fried chicken - 
DEF need garlic powder/poultry seasoning on the chicken before breading it, 
dont continously flip the chicken while frying it, i flipped each piece only once, the breading stayed on better this way

GREAT recipe, tasted just like that greasy disgustlying DELICIOUS chicken you get at a diner.  the boys loved it. thanks :)

My husband loved this recipe and he usually doesn't like breading on food as it adds calories. He even wanted the crunchy breading that fell of the chicken during cooking! We had mashed potatoes and sprinkled the little breadings on top of the potatoes and they were yummy. I was in a hurry so I browned the chicken in a frying pan on the stove until juices ran clear. It was nice and crispy. I think I'd love it too, but I had a cold and couldn't taste much for about a week! Thanks for a keeper; I'm sure I'll make it again.

This is a very easy way to fry boneless chicken breasts.  Chicken stayed moist and tender....all you need is some milk gravy and homemade biscuits to go with it!

I give the recipe high ratings and the cook - "me" low ratings!  The first time I cooked it I used Chicken Breasts w/ rib bone as I was searching for the "true" fried chicken on Sunday! I put too much peanut oil in the skillet and wow it started to runneth over!  Lots of fun to clean.  After all the work we ate it and the mess was well worth it!  I'm going to make it again tonight believe it?? I soak the chicken in buttermilk and like others up the seasoned salt, adding garlic & onion powder. Great taste!  I've added it to my favorites!

This is a terrific recipe! I was surprised at how good this turned out. I have been looking for a good recipe to use for chicken and have finally found it! Thanks! This will definately be added to our rotation. One note to others trying it. It's better if your crackers are not crushed too finely. I know the recipe basically says the same but I crushed mine because I was worried how the texture and taste would come out. It's better to leave the crackers in very small chunks because they will give the chicken a crunch even after frying. Very good!

Quick and easy chicken!  I didn't have any saltines, so I used a multi-grain cracker (better nutrition anyway) and it turned out beautifully!

We thought this was ok.  Chicken came out dry and we didn't think it had much flavor.  I plan on trying it again, sometimes the meat you buy in the store isn't as fresh as you would like which I personally think hinders the flavor and moistness.

I have made this twice for parties.  First time I cut into bite size chunks for dipping.  The other time I pounded out the breasts and then made strips.  I drizzled hot wing sauce over half the strips for a hot wing taste.  I use Adobo as the seasoning rather than seasoning salt and everyone raves about the taste.

I've made this several times as written and just tonight got the inspiration to cook it in my panini grill.  Absolutely fabulous!  I was afraid the coating would all come off in the grill but it didn't.  Completely cut the calories by not frying in the oil and still had the wonderful flavor and very juicy.

Like others suggested, I added more seasoned salt to the recipe and it came out great.  My husband loved the flavor although he said it needed more of a "kick" (he likes his chicken spicy).  So next time I will add some cayenne pepper to it.

I was hesitant to try a fried chicken recipe calling for saltines/potato flakes but I sure am glad I tried it!  I did double batter the chicken and it was absolutely delicious!!!  I added additional dry spices as well.  YUM!  This will become a staple in our household thanks Cassie!

I'd never tried anything like this, but this was soo simple.  I used our fry-daddy, instead of pan-frying.  It turned our very light and crispy!

Made this dish tonight and my family loved it. The chicken was very moist. I used regular salt because I reqd the recipe wrong. But, during the frying I did sprinkle a little seasoned salt on it. Definitely will make again

We enjoyed this recipe a lot.  I omitted the seasoned salt and did not add any other spicy seasonings.  When I want "fast food" tasting chicken, I will buy it at a fast-food restaurant!

Great recipe!!Nextxt time I make it (which will be soon) I will double the dry ingredients. Had just enough batter for 6 large chicken breasts. Great taste, easy to make and my family loved it even my picky 9 year old. Can't wait to make it again!

Followed recipe to a T. . .crunchy on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside. This is my main fried chicken recipe. I have even added a ¼ cup of Zantarans breading to the breading for a little extra kick.
Very Good Fried Chicken recipe

Awesome, even my 17 month old ate it.  :)  I didn't turn frequently, 10 minutes on each side was perfect.  Mashed potatoes with country gravy and corn on the cob are great along with it!

I never have leftovers with this recipe. For a little healthier spin I use wholewheat crackers, though Fried Chicken isn't a low fat dish! But it tastes great.

For my first time frying chicken, this was pretty good.  I added extra cajun seasoning, extra black pepper, and garlic powder, and everyone said they liked it, but the hubby said it needed some more seasoning.  Oh, I ran out of the cracker mixture before I ran out of meat because I'd chopped up the six breasts to chicken tender size, so if you're going to do that as well I'd recommend upping it by half (i.e. 45 crackers, 3 tbsp flour, etc.).  The hubby also said it would be interesting to try Ritz crackers next time, so we'll probably do that.

2 words:  don't bother.  I bought Potato Flakes with a 3 Cheese topping as I thought that it might make this dish a little more interesting.  I topped each chicken breast with the cheese and seasoning packets and I also added some Red Pepper flakes to the dry mixture and it still didn't make this dish a keeper.  Oh, and I also baked the chicken instead of frying as I thought it would be less messy.  Needless to say even with my tweaking this chicken dish won't be being served at our house again :(

This recipe is so good. I've always been intimidated by fried chicken, but not anymore. My kids said this was the best chicken they've ever had and that's alot!! I did add some creole seasoning to the coating mix.  Made it zesty, although it didn't need any adjustments. We just like spicy.

Very good! Definitely needs to be spiced up. The nice thing is you can add spices of choice. I used garlic & onion powder, cajun, cayenne & paprika. Also used a little corn starch in place of the potato flakes. I opted to bake it (therefore probably not as crunchy) to make it healthier - but still excellent!

Deeeeeeeeelicious!  Followed the recipe exactly except I cut the ingredients by half and I used a deep fryer.  Because the deep fryer cooks so quickly, I had to hammer down the breast down to about 1.25 inches thick to make sure the inside gets cooked without the batter burning.  Now that I know how to make this at home, I don't need to go out to my favorite bar & grill place for country fried chicken anymore!

My family (husband and two boys) *loved* this dish.  My 7-year old loved the breading, and my husband said the breading reminded him of breading on chicken fried steak.  I thought it was a tad bit bland, but I will try adding more seasoned salt next time -- and there will be a next time.  This one is a keeper.
The only thing I did different from the recipe, was that I "fried" the chicken in the oil, until browned on each side, but then I moved to the oven and baked for 20 minutes or so at 350 degrees.  Yummy!  thanks for sharing!

Two Thumbs Up!!! It definetly deserves 5 stars!! At first I was a little hesitate but it is a new family favorite. My 14 month old daughter couldn't get enough and she's a real picky eater.
I love the fact that it was crisy, crunchy and the chicken was very moist.  I did take a few suggestions from the other reviewers such as adding adobo (growing up in NY it's a MUST have)and paprika. Thank you so much for sharing the recipe!!

This recipe is THE BEST and it was so easy to make!!!!!  I have a 5 year old who's VERY picky and she LOVED this recipe!!! She enjoyed helping me crush up the crackers and I added Betty Crocker's Sour Cream and Chives Mashed Potatoes Mix.  It turned out delicious!!!  Every one should try this recipe!!!

The chicken was good and cooked through, but it didn't have a lot of flavour. I might try this again with some sort of seasoning... not sure.

This is very good for fried chicken.  Be sure to flatten chicken first for a more tender chicken and don't overcook.

When I told my food loving husband that we were having chicken fried chicken for dinner, he wasn't enthused due to my past record with frying meat.  When he sat down at the dinner table he said, "Now this is what I would like to come home to a couple of nights a week!"  Yeah, Cassie!!! It's now a staple in my home!

pretty easy process for fried chicken. i dumped all the flour mixture ingredients into a ziploc bag, just so a i didn't have another dish to wash. i used chicken breast tenders, cooked for the same amount of time, and they still were pretty juicy and tender. i added in garlic powder and "tabasco" seasoning salt to spice it up. very crunchy crust. tastes just like fried chicken with crunchy skin but not as greasy (and without the skin, less calories)!! quick and simple recipe.

This was easy and excellent.  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and they were great.  I did double the egg mixture, and I should have doubled the cracker crumb mixture (we like a thick coating).  Nevertheless, it was delicious --crunchy on the outside and juicy and tender inside. I'll use this recipe again many times.

This is an amazing recipe! I have been looking for a chicken fried chicken recipe that gives a thick, crunchy coating and this recipe more than provides. I did stray from the recipe out of necessity, since I did not have potato flakes. Instead I added the equivalent in flour. I also added garlic powder to the recipe as well as the suggested season salt and the flavor turned out perfect.  This will now be my go-to recipe. Loved it.
I also made gravy using a couple tablespoons on the grease used to fry the chicken and some of the crunchy tid-bits that were left in the skillet after frying. It gave the gravy a really nice flavor and complimented the chicken really well.

I stuck with the idea of the recipe but took liberty of seasoning the chicken and not measuring ingredients. Still turned out phenomenal. Have made it at least 3 times and always excellent results. Did a flour dredge, then egg, then the saltine potato flake final dip

I thought this recipe was great! I cant eat eggs- so instead of dipping in eggs I lathered it in honey so the crumbs would stick. It was great and the subtle sweetness of the honey was great too! I recommend trying this

I made this last night and everybody loved it. I have a very picky 7 year old (and an almost as picky boyfriend) so finding recipes they like tends to be pretty hard. I added both the 1 t. garlic powder and 1 t. paprika from the other reviews and changed the half t. pepper to a full teaspoon and about 20 crackers instead of the 30. I used the tenders instead of breasts and did the flour, egg, and then the cracker mix. They both liked it so much they made me promise to make it again later this week. This one is definitely going in the recipe book.

Good flavor base in the coating, and I like the idea of using crushed crackers.  But for some reason, even though I heated the oil to 350 degrees as the recipe said, my coating burned before my chicken was done.  I tried it both on chicken breasts and on bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs, with the same result.  The breasts ended up dry and burnt inside and out.  The thighs took longer to cook, which meant more burning.  Not a recipe for a beginner at frying, like me.

Me and my family LOVE this recipe I'm fourteen, and my dad doesn't like most chicken, but tell you what, if I make this and he doesn't get any I'll get fussed at. not the only difference is I season mine a little more, and add: Basil, garlic powder, onion powder, "Hungarian" Paprika, and just a pinch of parsley. I also tried this with marinated Tilapia and that too was great. This recipe is Awesome!

I used this recipe for the first time I ever made fried chicken, and it was pretty good. I mean, the chicken certainly looked and tasted like fried chicken. However, in my opinion, the flavor was lacking a little. It was semi-bland and needed more salt (surprisingly). Next time I make this, I think I'll add 1/2 tsp garlic salt, and that should address both problems. Also, I fried mine in a skillet with canola oil and maybe that was why, but it took MUCH longer than 15-20 minutes to fry 6 pieces of chicken. I had 4 legs and 2 breasts. I did the legs two at a time, then the breasts one at a time and the total frying time was about an hour and 15 minutes.

This is amazing!!!  I dipped the chicken in flour prior to the egg in order to help the coating stick better. Crunchy on the outside and juicy and tender inside!

A very good basic recipe for breading chicken. I did spice it up some by adding garlic and onion powder. I did not have any potato flakes so I used some flour in place of it.  0(*@*)0

Perfect everytime! I always soak my chicken in buttermilk overnight (grandma's tip), and I did add more seasoned salt, plus a handful of cornflakes and French's Onions into my food processor to make the crust. Results were AMAZING! My boyfriend said it was better than his momma's!

Nice golden color and the right amount of juicy and crispy in chicken finger style strips without the coating getting too well done before the chicken cooks through. If you don't crumble the crackers super fine they seem to help soak up the grease better than other recipes I've tried so they don't leave as much grease behind on fingers.

I followed the recipe as directed with the exception that I coated the chicken in flour first, then dipped in egg, then put in a bag with the coating.  My husband and I LOVE this recipe and it is now one of our favorites.  Also, we use boneless chicken breasts (pounded flat) and they are not dry at all. Thank you for posting this!!

Kids loved it I sprinkled on a little chicken bullion for a little extra chicken flavor. We also used a deep fryer and it made quick work of the cooking just 3 minutes per slice.

Phenomenal!  Thanks so much for posting this and for the multiple hundreds of you who gave your tips!  Added a little more spices and dipped first in flour, then egg, and then in the crumb mixture; fried 5-6 minutes on each side, flipped, and then 5-6 more minutes; flipped again and fried 3 minutes; kept in warm oven.  Beloved son home from college tweeted to all his followers that his mom made a delicious meal!! Doesn't get any better than that!  Thank you so much CASSJW!

Really good and easy! I pounded out 4 chicken breasts into cutlets, and this was the perfect amount of breading.  No seasoned salt, so just added salt and pepper to the flour mix.  Had no veg. oil, so I cooked it in bacon grease - just a couple of tbsp. in a nonstick electric skillet. Chicken was really juicy! Thanks for the recipe, I'll be making this again!

Kids and adults loved it.  Will definitely save and make again and again.  Only change we made was with the coating, as we used Ritz crackers instead of Saltines, but worked just great.

Using the other reviews as a guide I changed this up a bit.  I used about 30 saltines, a huge handful of goldfish crackers, and some spices for the coating.  I didn't have an egg so I mixed about a cup of milk and 1-2 tablespoons of mayo as the egg dip.  I started the chicken by pounding it flatter, coated it in dry flour, then the mayo mixture and finally into the cracker/spice mixture.  
The chicken was moist and tender and the coating was delicious!  Next, I will try this modified recipe with steak.  Yum!

Excellent! I did not have potato flakes so I just skipped it and it turned out so delicious. Browned nicely and the crust was crispy with a juicy inside. I will be using this again!

We Love This Recipe!!!!!  I love that it is super easy!!!!!  We add seasonings to our taste and I add 1-2 Tbsp of Panko crumbs, to the mix.  Our Kids cannot believe that it is made with saltines! : )  We have also added Club crackers as well.  And we have followed previous suggestions to bake it.  Fried or baked, awesomeness!!!!!!!!!!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!  It's now a family favorite!!!!!!!

This was awesome! I made just a few changes. First, I used 1 lb chicken tenders instead of breasts and I omitted the potato flakes as I didn't have any. I also used 2 eggs, and I reduced the amount of pepper to 1/4 t because I didn't want my kids to tell me this was "too spicy". Then I dipped the chicken in egg, dredged in flour, dipped in buttermilk, then coated in the cracker mixture. This was just barely enough cracker crumbs to coat all of the chicken pieces, so I will adjust accordingly next time. Cooked in about 1/2 cup of canola oil (because my skillet was really big and deep) for about 3-4 minutes on each side, about 5 tenders at a time. It turned out so light and crispy and was cooked just perfectly on the inside. Fabulous, and my kids LOVED these and even asked for seconds, which is practically unheard of at my house. My daughter even asked me if I would make this more often, so this recipe is definitely a keeper!! Served it with country gravy, mashed potatoes and green beans...great comfort food! Husband and I decided I could have definitely used the full amount of pepper called for without the chicken being spicy, so I'll definitley do that next time to add just a bit more flavor. Thanks for sharing!!

Fantastic, quick, and easy!  I used Ritz Crackers instead of Saltines because that's all I had.  Since they're basically the same, I doubt the flavor changed much because of it.  I also added 1 tsp. of the Melting Pot's Garlic and Wine seasoning for a bit of an extra kick.  It was so easy to make - I've never fried chicken before, and this turned out fantastic!!

I don't ever have potato flakes in the house, so I used onion soup mix instead.  Worked great.  I just used whatever crackers I had in the house, which turned out to be some Toasted Sesame crackers.  It was really REALLY good.

This was really good. I have never been a fan of cracker crumbs, usually opting for breadcrumbs or flouring instead, but I was really impressed! I kind of made it my own... had no flake potato so used 3 tbs of flour instead of 2, generous amounts of garlic powder and seasoning salt and I was out of eggs so I used Ranch dressing with a little milk. My kids loved it! After frying in vegetable oil, I saved about 1/4 cup of the drippings and made "milk" gravy in my skillet.

I Read all the reviews before trying this, and I did adjust the recipe for servings of 9.  Increased the seasoned salt 1 T and potato flakes 1T, added about 1T of garlic powder, and used seasoned flour instead of regular.  Also I floured the chicken before the egg dredging.  The only thing I wished I had done was cut the breasts either in kinda large strips or the breasts in half or thirds.  But when thinking of this method please remember the breasts I use are approx 1 to 1.25 pounds each.  In a 12" skillet I can only fit 1 breast at a time.  I did flatten them a little just so they would cook through easier.  If you can find a good old fashioned meat market with fresh boneless breasts, they are much better than anything you can get.  I will definitely do this recipe again and again.

This was a very good starting point for pan-frying chicken.  I had never tried it before, mostly out of fear.  I followed the advice of almost everyone... First I marinated boneless skinless chicken brest for an hour in EVOO, salt, pepper, adobo, and minced garlic.  I made a breading of crushed club crackers, instant potato flakes, salt, pepper, papricka, onion powder, and garlic powder.  As someone suggested, after I pounded out the chicken, I dredged it in flour, then egg wash, and then my breading mixture.  I pan fried in veggie oil (it can withstand high temps. more so than OO.) to a light brown.  I served it with green bean casserole and a gravy I threw together by making a roux and adding chicken stock (I always keep on hand). Long story short, DEL-ISH!!!!!

This recipe is great!!! I tried it for the first time last year and am still using it! Its very simple and is incredibly easy to do. My fiance loved it and so did our friends, along with my brother too. I agree with others that have tried this recipe make more of the mixture because it just makes it easier! I also read about someone using the egg and it does help a lot.

Great recipe.  I rarely cook, but getting into it.  Pretty easy and tastes really good.  I used skinless boneless chicken breasts and still had a very crunchy coating.  I also used the others advice flouring before egg and it worked great.  Definately add extra spice.

Fantastic! I only made a couple of changes - I hate it when people don't follow the recipe and then complain; but this isn't one of those! I didn't have any potato flakes, so I substituted 2 extra tablespoons of flour.  I also added a tsp. of paprika, just because I like it. DIVINE!

Really tasty chicken--I made only 2 changes after reading many reviews. I used 1 T season salt and coated the chicken in flour, then egg, then the crumb mixture. It was especially delicious the next day, just eaten cold out of the fridge for lunch. Would be an ideal leftover to pack in a lunchbox.

Very delicious and easy!  My husband and I don't have kids, but we have two best friends that are bachelors and nearly qualify.  P and H took particular joy in smushing the crackers to smithereens.  We followed the recipe exactly and very much enjoyed the result.  I'll definitely make this again.

This was excellent chicken. Nice and crispy. I've tried a few other recipes on here and none of them turned out as good as this.  It has a nice mild flavor, so if you like your chicken a little bolder you might want to add some more spices. I'll probably try a little cayenne and garlic next time.

I thought this was excellent.  I dipped in flour first, then egg, then the cracker mix.  I added some panko crumbs in with the mix and lots of seasoning.  The chicken turned out nice and crispy with great flavor.  Served this with creamy milk gravy, mashed potatoes and roasted broccoli.  Good meal - thanks!

So good! However, most of the credit isn't towards the recipe, though I did incorporate everything it called for. I added a LOT too it though because the breading was too bland, which is what made it so good. This simple recipe leaves a lot open to the chef so you can add anything you want. I added a lot of garlic, paprika, and a bit of chili powder. Wonderful. I fried a bunch of wings, tips discarded, and they were fantastic. As others have mentioned, flour the chicken before dipping in the egg mixture. Also, I ran out of egg and didn't want to crack another one for the last couple of wings, so I dredged them in honey mustard and it was AWESOME!

I grew up watching my grandmother get up at 5am on sundays to make the perfect fried chicken. I have tried and failed many times trying to recreate hers. I found this chicken as close as anything I have ever tried.  It was so easy to follow, incredibly jucy and the crust stayed on perfectly, I used the flour-egg-mixture as suggested. Very Good, and no 5am wake up ! My grandmother would be so proud.

My boyfriend was a big fan. I didn't have any potato flakes, and I used multi-grain crackers instead of saltines, but the breading was still "sensational." He's requesting that I make it again later this week. It was a nice, simple recipe with ingredients I had in the pantry.

Delicious!! The only change I made was that I used Ritz crackers instead of saltines. I'm so happy; after I took my first bite I knew this would be perfect to serve to company.

This was very good!  My first attempt to make fried chicken and it was pretty easy.  The hardest part was the fact that I bought a whole chicken and had to cut and skin it.  I definately make this as my picky eaters even liked it!

With a little alteration this recipe is really good. For crackers use a mixture of Ritz and Cheez-it crackers. Some garlic, onion, and Cajun seasoning will help add flavor to the flower.

This crisped up great, but we were not crazy about the taste--too much saltine taste.  Think we'll continue on the search for The Recipe.  Thanks.

My husband loves this! He always asks for it. I don't add the potato flakes. I used other reviewer's suggestions and add 1 T seasoning salt and 1 T garlic powder. Good comment is to taste to make sure the coating is pungent! This recipe is fantastic though. And that's coming from a girl who hates fried chicken.

This chicken was to die for!  The crackers gave just the right crunch.  I did, however, have to add a little more flour than the recipe calls for.  Other than that...wonderful!

The combination of coating ingrediants really help retain the moisture in the chicken. Enjoyed it very much and used the leftovers today on my salad. Will make again with some additional seasonings. Thanks for the post!

Very light and crispy. I did add more spices to increase the flavor. And I followed other reviewers recommendation to dip the chicken in flour before dipping in the egg and flour mix.

This was an awesome recipe, and it was easy. I am still beginning to learn and I was able to follow this recipe very easily. I used Club crackers instead of Saltine, and I added a few extra spices at the advice of other reviewers. I also followed the recommendation of another reviewer & dredged the chicken through flour, then egg, and then the seasoning. The chicken was tender & juicy, and the coating was crispy and flavorful. We will definitely be making this one again!

Excellent flavor! I did up the season salt to 1 Tbsp. If you don't want it to get too crispy I suggest turning it about every four minutes...I did a little over five and one side of my chicken was burned...sigh.  Otherwise time and everything was excellent!!!!

I HAVE MADE "CHICKEN FRIED CHICKEN" ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS AS REQUESTED BY MY FAMILY.  IT IS A "MUST" TO TRY!  I DID ADD 1/2 CUP OF "COCONUT" TO THE CRACKER CRUMB MIXTURE WHICH ADDED A LITTLE SWEETNESS.  WE ALL THINK IT MADE THE RECIPE EVEN BETTER.  I ALSO CUT MY CHICKEN BREASTS INTO STRIPS WHICH MADE A PLATTER FULL.  I SERVED IT WITH A "HONEY,MUSTARD,MAYO" SAUCE FOUND ON THIS SITE.  DEFINITELY A KEEPER!!!!!!!!!!!

This was great. I doubled the recipe because I had more than 6 chicken breasts. It worked out perfectly and didn't have to use a lot of oil. I browned the chicken in the frying pan and finished them off in the oven. Drained them on a rack over a cookie sheet until the rest of the meal was ready. There was not a single piece left. Thank you, this one is a keeper!!

This is totally what you'd get at a restaurant. It was a lot easier to make than I thought even - I made it while tired and hungry, and didn't put much effort into it honestly, but it turned out great still. I'll definitely make this one again.

This chicken turned out really well....  the coating tasted great and was really crispy and the chicken was very tender.  The only thing I did different  was coat the chicken with flour first, then the egg, and then the coating.  It stayed on really good.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Best I have ever had! TENDER and Juicy! I used Club crackers because I didn't have Saltines. And I added some chili powder cause my family loves spicy! VERY good recipe!

Just not a winner to us. Our eight year old daughter liked it, but too bland and boring to the rest of us. Much better recipes out there.

Absolutely delicious. My husband is extremely picky and even he liked it! The batter is very light, but still crispy, and the chicken stays very moist! I don't think I cooked the pieces for 15-20 minutes like the recipe says, but I used smaller pieces of chicken.

This was so easy and tasted AMAZING.  I have never made fried chicken before so I was nervous, but it came out GREAT.  It took me a really long time to crush up the crackers, but other than that I had no problems.  I also took the advice of other reviewers and added a LOT more seasoned salt and some garlic powder, tasting as I went.  I also pounded the chicken with a little water first, then coated it in flour, then egg, then the cracker mixture. This is definitely going to become a regular meal at my house.

I received this recipe from my best friend and my family just loves it!! She suggested adding 1/2 a packet of dry ranch dressing to the cracker mixture instead of flour.  I also coated the pieces in flour first (or fry mix) before dipping in egg.  The chicken turned out perfect.  We loved the recipe so much that I used it for chicken fried steak, which is now a family favorite.  Tip:  Be careful to monitor the heat of the oil because the coating can burn easily if you are not careful. Thanks to CASSJW and my best friend for sharing this recipe!

This was so very good!  I love fried chicken, but his wasn't deep fried, so it didn't have the extra fat.  I have stainless steel cookware, and I was able to "fry" it with just oil spray, and about a couple of tablespoons of oil.  My husband took the leftovers before I had a chance to!  Will make this many times.  I want to make Chicken Nuggets with this recipe for my Grandkids.  Thanks!

A hit with the family and the guests. I found that I needed one and half times the coating for six chicken breasts. I also doubled the spices and used two eggs.

This chicken was soooooo...GREAT!! My seven year old finds something every meal that she doesn't like. Tonight was one of the only nights that she liked everything. I also ran the chicken through flour before the egg and cracker combo. It came out so flavorful and juicy. We loved it. Thanks for the recipe.

This is a crispy fried chicken and very tasty! I don't eat fried anything very often so have this with homemade mashed potatoes and corn once in a while. It is the same as Country Fried Steak, but with chicken instead...a little messy to make, but very tasty.

I used chicken legs with skin and chicken breasts with skin, baked on cookie sheet at 400 for about 1 hr, made lots and froze extras for quick meals later.  Tastes great, thank you!! Chicken with the skin is fabulous

Absolutely delicious. It was my first attempt at making fried chicken and it turned out great. The family loved it. I added a bit more spices, used "unsalted" saltine crackers and a bit more of the potato flakes called for in the recipe. I dipped in flour first, then egg, then the mixture. 
Definitely get the oil really hot then turn down to medium when you put the chicken in. 
I will definitely make again.

I had some buttermilk to use up, so I soaked chicken tenders in the buttermilk first, for about 20 minutes, then dipped them in the coating when ready to cook.  I was fairly liberal with seasoned salt in the coating.  My family LOVES this recipe!  I even made cream gravy in the skillet when done, browning a little flour with the browned bits of crust in the skillet with the little bit of oil left.  Used milk instead of cream, but it was good.

This recipe is a hit with my family! I used boneless, skinless chicken breast strips. I used the method of flour, egg, coating. I was light on the seasoning do to the saltine crackers. However next time I will season away!!

I used this recipe for steak fingers and they turned out great. Instead of chicken use thin boneless sirloin. The only thing I did different was add some steak seasoning to the cracker mixture. Served with Ranch dressing. It's a good all-purpose recipe.

This is a great recipe!!  I followed the reviewers' advice and dipped in flour, egg, coating order and it was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  I also added a bit of garlic powder and 3/4 tsp of cajun seasoning, it had great flavor!

This came out sooo good. I actually used chicken legs & it came out awesome. The only thing I did differently was, I added Garlic Mashed Potato Mix instead of regular, and I added some 4C Seasoned Bread Crumbs. Very good recipe =)

This is awesome!  I used just three breasts, but sliced into two thinner cutlets each.  It cut down the cooking time significantly, which helps out on busy nights.  I also used half vegetable oil and half extra virgin olive oil.  My son thought it was the best chicken he's ever had.

Delish!  I didn't have potato flakes, and I didn't quite have enough saltines, so I used half saltines half butter crackers.  I also used seasoned salt instead if reg. salt.  My family loved this meal.  Super quick and easy so I loved it too!

My kids and husband loved this! Very happy with this recipe. Instead of Saltine crackers I used Ritz. My husband took one bite and said ad this to our menu. (He is a VERY picky eater.) I also added a little mustard to the egg 1/2 a tea. maybe a little more. I bet even some hot sauce in the egg would make them a little spicey. I think I'll try that next.

Very good recipe.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and floured the chicken before I dipped it in the egg and cracker mixtures.  I also baked this chicken rather than fry it and it turned out great.  The skin was super crunchy and the meat was juicy.

So good, but a guilty pleasure. I accidentally left out the potato flakes and they were still great. I made A LOT extra and we ate the leftovers cold and also warmed in a salad with ranch dressing. Do yourself a favor and make extra because they are very versitile and taste great.

This recipe is absolutely delicious! My family couldn't get enough of it. I did make a few small adjustments. I followed a few other reviewers suggestions about dipping the chicken in flour, egg, then in the cracker mixture. I used more crackers and added a little more of the spices than suggested. I also included a little garlic powder to taste. This was not the least bit bland. I was amazed at how well the cracker mixture adhered to the chicken and stayed there even through frying.I have used other recipes that the cracker mixture fell off before it hit the pan or it didn't even stick at all. Not this one. This was perfect!

This is very good.  I never made fried chicken before and followed this recipe to the T.  The chicken was moist and tender.  The flavor was great.  I made a successful dinner for my family and parents!!

Great chicken! It was moist and easy to prepare. I cut up the chicken breast into 3" squares. It cooked up fast and it was easy to manage in the frying pan. This size also made it easy to serve. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Maybe a little more healthy?

I added a variety of crackers (saltines, Melba wheat and Wasa whole grain) as well as extra seasonings.  I baked the chicken and doused with butter the last 10 minutes of baking.  It still wasn't flavorful enough.  Next time I'll put on a ton of seasoned salt (I used cajun).  I would give it 3 1/2 stars if possible, but not quite 4.

Okay- No joke, Tonight was my first time to ever cook a whole meal on my own... my husband is the real cook of the family. I decided to cook this, all I can say is "PERFECT"! I took 3 chicken breast and cut them up into little pieces so they would end up cooking like little chicken nuggets, they came out wonderful. I love this recipe!

This is an awesome recipe, next time Im going to go along with another review and make the chicken thinner prior to cooking so it cooks quicker and more thoroughly. Also in the breading mix I used Ritz crackers and some crumbled chips (this time I used BBQ flavor) along with some McCormick chicken seasoning, and garlic pepper, and it tasted soooo good.

I just made this tonight and I was very impressed. I'm not one for cooking, infact I hate to cook because I always seem to mess it up. This chicken came out sooooo juicie! I took the advice of cooking it 5 to 6 minutes on each side and then another 3 on each side and it couldn't have came out more perfect. I didn't have any seasoning salt so I just used garlic powder and a few other seasonings which worked good, but I'm sure the seasoning salt would taste better. This is a keeper!

This was okay to me although my family seemed to like it. I went with some of the reviewers who said they baked it instead of frying because I realized that I did not have any oil. Again I thought it was okay but I really do think it would be better the way it should be made and that is fried instead of baked. I will try it again but next time I will follow directions and fry it.

Too good for words. My husband was skeptical whether this would turn out but it did and it was so easy. My whole family raved about it. I didn't have dry potato flakes so I used 2tbls. of flour and it was still amazing.

Hubbie said this was hands down the best fried chicken I had ever made.  Chicken was beautifully crisp on the outside, moist and juicy on the inside.  Didn't take long to fry either, and wasn't overly greasy.  Yummy..will be a regular item on the menu in our household.  Thank you!

This chicken is fantastic!!! Dry chicken by tapping with paper towles before placing in egg, and your coating will stay put perfectly. I added extra seasonings as my family likes heavily seasoned food and made country gravy. served with mashed potatoes and family voted meal the best I've ever made!!! Thank you for THE BEST CHICKEN EVER!!!!!!! YYYUUUUMMMMMYYYYYYYY!!!!!

This was great. Sometimes I use crushed up Town House butter flavored crackers. I also pop the chicken into the deep fryer. Thank you so much for this.

This recipe is simply the best. Like everyone else I did make 1 little change. I use maybe 3 tsp of seasoned salt instead although the first time I went strictly by the recipe and it tasted AWESOME. I make fried chicken tenders and my family LOVES them.

great recipe. I added the 1 TBSP of garlic powder & an extra tsp of seasoning salt plus some parsley. Otherwise followed exactly. Turned out great & the breading was nice & crunch. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is great!  I did make a couple modifications just to make it healthier. I pounded out the chicken, added a little lite sour cream to the egg wash and baked it for 45 min in a 350 oven. Extrememly delicious even without the oil.

The chicken was good, but next time I will bake it instead of frying it. It burns so easily and it took so long for the inside to cook. Maybe my chicken breasts were to thick. I give it 4 stars because my picky kids loved it!  I'm trying it again tonight with chicken cutlets. Thanks for sharing.

Very, very, very good. Usually I can't eat the food that I make but this is one exception. I followed the directions to a tee except I substituted bread crumbs for potato flakes because I was fresh out. I had 2.5 servings of this...my only suggestion is to add a little more seasoned salt than the recipe calls for. Best recipe I've cooked from here so far (out of 6).

Following the recommendations of reviewer Breeze (Feb 2006) for additional spices, it turned out wonderful.  Chicken was very moist and flavorful.  Simple to make.  The family ate it all which means cook it again.

Loved the recipe. This was the first thing that i made and it came out wonderfully. The texture was so incredible. The potato flakes give a little extra something. Next time i need to make sure that i marinade the chicken real good before i fry. It was a bit bland this time, my fault though. Probably add some cayenne pepper into the breading to make them a bit spicy. Overall fantastic. I know i'm going to be making this again.

This is the best chicken I have ever had! I would have given it more than 5 stars if I could. I added garlic powder to the cracker mixture, because we like it. I made a country gravy to go on it but nobody wanted to cover the taste of their chicken. My whole family said it's the only way they want me to make chicken now!

For the people who said this recipe was too bland, be creative! Add your favorite spices, this is a great base to add to.

This chicken is great!!!  I used 4 chicken breats.  I used seasoned salt, garlic powder and pepper.  I also used 2 eggs instead of 1.  I agree with others, the oil needs to be hot, then turned down a bit when cooking and turn after about 3 minutes.  The crust was dark brown and tasted delicious.  My son said, was the best chicken he had ever eaten and he's a picky eater.  Also hubby thought it was great too.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

This was very easy and delicious! I didn't have potato flakes, and added some Parmesean cheese instead.  I also broiled instead of baking it for just a few minutes on each side to make it even quicker. I used chicken tenders, and served it with spicy honey mustard.

I gave this a 3, but my husband gave it a 5, so we settled with a 4.  It was good, but I felt like it was a little bland.  The breading also didn't stick well. A lot came off when it was cooking. I'm from Kentucky and can fry some pretty good chicken, but I was in the mood for something different. I will try this again and add more seasoning and double dip when I'm breading it, but only b/c my husband and kids liked it.   Maybe I was just expecting more b/c of all the great reviews.

Very good recipe. Easy, tasty and didn't make a huge mess. I will make this again for sure. I used egg whites only and it was fine, except I dipped in egg, coated with mixture, dipped again and coated a second time, since the mixture didn't seem to want to stick very well the first time.

This has to be the best fried chicken I have ever tasted. When I came home from college during winter break I made it for my mom and she loved it. She liked the breading so much that she stopped making her fried chicken the way she used to and now makes it like this. I definitly recommend this recipe!

This chicken is great. I made it for my husband's birthday and everyone loved it. I think that the addition of potato flakes is genious. It helps the coating stick to the chicken. I also used Ritz crackers instead of saltines. I suggest using Ritz crackers because it gives the coating a rich buttery flavor. I served this with homemade honey mustard sauce.

MY 1O YEAR OLD MADE ME WRITE THIS REVIEW AND SHE IS  A VERY FUSSY EATER!!  I USED THE CHICKEN  BREAST TENDERS AND MORTONS  NATURE SEASONING INSTEAD OF THE SEASONED SALT.. IT CAME OUT MORE LIKE GOURMET CHICKEN TENDERS.  I ALSO ADDED A LITTLE BUTTER WITH THE OIL AND THE RESULTS WERE JUST WONDERFUL.. QUICK, SIMPLE WITH A DELIGHTFUL FLAVOR.. THANKS FOR THE GREAT RECIPE.

By far, the BEST fried chicken I have ever made.  The kids ate all of it, and I will be making this again!

The best fried chicken i have had in a long time. Browned nice and the breading stuck well to the chicken. Followed the recipe exactly except i did add a few extra spices. Family loved it, with no left overs. Will double the recipe next time.

I'm a Southern/country girl and I know fried chicken.  This is by far the best I've ever had.  My dad tasted this chicken and couldn't believe how good it tasted. When I told him it was a saltine cracker & potato flake crust, he couldn't believe it!  Definitely a way to man's heart!

Not bad ... but could use tweeking. Unlike most, I rate it as it was posted. I don't worry about what others post.  This was good, but could use just a little more flavor. I'd maybe add more pepper and an herb to the coating. Maybe rosemary or oregano.

I tried this recipe tonight. I did not add the seasoning salt but I did add a pinch of garlic/onion powder and some parsley flakes and it was AWESOME! GREAT RECIPE. It was like having chicken strips at a restaraunt. Thank You.

It was okay, not sure what "seasoned salt" means, so I used a little salt, Tony's, garlic powder, onion powder, & some italian seasoning.  Glad I put all that, because it wouldn't have had any flavor.  The crackers tasted good as a batter.  I also used breast tenderloins for easy finger food.  I may cook it again one day.

Excellent!  Will make it again!  Put garlic powder and paprika and minced onion also.  I think I will try boneless breasts though, since it took too long to fry legs.  I shoulda listened to myself, because I should have boiled the legs a little first.  Done that before, especially with wings, and it works out great!  Love the flavor of this recipe.

Very good...however, I did make a few changes/additions.  Per another reviewer's suggestion, I was able to find "Cracker Mix", which is essentially crackers that have already been finely ground.  I used 1 cup of this, increased potato flakes to 3 TBS, and added a few dashes of onion and garlic powder.  I used thin sliced boneless chicken breasts, sprinkled them with Weber Kick'n Chicken seasoning (don't put to much--it is spicy!), salt and pepper, then dredged in egg and shook in bag of dry mixture until coated.  I increased oil to 1/3 cup and cooked covered for approx. 20 minutes, turning only once as suggested by another reviewer.  Very good, but I'm not sure how good it would have been without the addition of the Kick'n Chicken!

Pounded the chicken breasts to about 1/3 inch.  Added parsley & extra seasoned salt to the breading.  The breasts cooked up perfectly tender, and tasted great.  Will be making again!

It was great! But the crust didn't stay on, it flaked off in the pan. Maybe next time I'll add more egg? Other than that, simply delicious! Juicy, moist crispy-yummy!

I cooked this chicken last night for dinner. The whole family liked it. I did not have any potato flakes, but the recipe turned out great. Next time, I am going to try Ritz crackers in place of saltines. Also, I used my cast iron skillet which I prefer when cooking chicken. This recipe is a keeper!

Awesome!  My husband said to use this for our chicken parm.  I used some cornflakes instead of potato and added about a teaspoon of Italian seasoning.  This works great with thin sliced chicken or tenders.  I'm making this one again and again!

My boyfriend & I made this the other night, and it was SO good, and very filling. We made it with mashed potatoes from scratch and gravy. We didn't go -exactly- by the recipe, for the seasoned salt we used season all, not sure if that would be considered the same thing as the salt, and we used seasoned pepper instead of regular black pepper. It came out great with the mashed potatoes on the side and gravy covering the whole plate. It came out just as good, if not better than something from Dennys or Marie Callendars Chicken fried Chicken :) Thanks, we will be making this again.

Easy and delicious! I used Club crackers instead of Saltines, so I had to add a little extra salt. I cut each breast half into two pieces, pounded them and fried them in a deep fryer for about 5 minutes. I'll be making this recipe again!

My kids loved this recipe served with BBQ and ranch dipping sauces. I cut the chicken breasts into strips for easy dipping. I cooked them 10 minutes per side and they were perfect - golden brown outside and juicy inside.

I have always been too intimidated to fry chicken...but months of cravings finally beat out my fears.  This recipe was super easy.  I made a couple of additions....3/4 tsp of cayenne pepper to the breading mixture, and after beating the egg I mixed in a dash of onion salt, garlic powder and a little more cayenne pepper.  Delicious!

The whole family LOVED it!!! I opted to use Ranch with louisiana hot sauce mixed into it instead of a egg. This will definitely become a family classic for our household.

This is surprisingly good!  I made little chicken bites for an Easter Egg hunt pot-luck where kids would be there.  They were a BIG hit!  Very delicious.

This recipe is simply delicious.  Instead of frying in a pan, I used a deep fryer.  My entire family enjoyed this fried chicken immensely.

My family really enjoyed this chicken.  I have fried my own chicken, but this is much easier and was enjoyed by everyone.  I made it with Ritz crackers and added some extra seasoning.  It is not often that I make something that everyone in the family enjoys.

Delicious recipe and the crust is perfect.  Usually, I use thinly sliced chicken cutlets which cook in only a few minutes rather than the 15-20 as stated, but this is the only change I make.  Everyone loves this recipe and as a bonus, it's super easy to make.  Thank you!

YUM YUM YUM!  I have made this with both saltines and Ritz crackers.  Both are great! I have made cutlets, chicken fingers and nuggets.  My kids actually like this better than frozen nuggets!  Great for dipping in BBQ sauce.  Thanks!

Good recipe.  Make sure you pound your chicken into a thin, flat piece.  I also added more seasoning. Will make again.

I was pleasantly surprised to find that this tasted very good. I followed the other reviewer's instructions on adding additional spices (it came out a little saltier than I like but that can be easily adjusted)and in the last 3 pieces, I finally remembered to pound the chicken. If you remember to pound the chicken to get it flat, the recipe is delicious. My hard to please son had two pieces!!

This is an easy and inexpensive recipe.  I used chicken tenderloins instead of chicken breasts which reduced the cooking time to about 5 minutes. Just for ease, I used 2 eggs instead of 1 egg.  Next time I'll double the dry ingredients too.  The kids thought these were the fanciest chicken fingers ever. I'll definitely make this recipe again.

This was GREAT!! I made it a couple of nights ago and the silence from my family let me know they liked it. :) The chicken was tender and juicy. I definitely will make this again. Perhaps I'll use the other suggestions to spicy it up a little bit.

Wow!!!  This was a terrific recipe!  I kind of winged it... adding some parm cheese, bread crumbs, and italian seasonings to the mixture but it came out perfectly.  I followed others directions of coating in flour, and the result was phenomenal.  The chicken was juicy and extra crispy...  I topped it with country gravy and made the rest of those mashed potatoes.

Another awesome recipe off of this site! I took the advice of others and added the garlic and cayenne pepper, wonderful touch! I did not, however, add the potato flakes because I couldn't locate them in the grocery store and the clerk wasn't able to help me either......but, it was still very good without it. Made some white gravy, mashed potatoes and corn on the cob. There were nooooooo left overs! Thanks for the recipe!

This was pretty good.  I added a little bit of garlic powder and poultry seasoning and will probably add more garlic next time.  It was good with white gravy and mashed potatoes.

My 13 year old son prepared this dish tonight and it was awesome!!! All 3 of us gave it 5 stars!!  I made gravy with a package of brown gravy mix, a package of turkey gravy mix, 2 cups of water and added it to the drippings.  Served that over white rice with a vegetable medley on the side and this was a great supper.  We will definitely be making this again!!!

When I saw this recipe I thought that maybe I could replace the chicken with round steak.  It turned out beautifully!  I followed the recipe as written and just used round steak instead.  WE LOVED IT!!  THANK YOU FOR THIS GREAT RECIPE!

Easy and delicious!  I put mine in the oven to finish cooking after they were browned so they didn't get too dark.  Served with mashed potatoes, country gravy and fresh peas... YUM!

Wow! Just the recipe I have been looking for! I made the crumbs fine instead of course and made a white sauce chicken gravy. Can't wait to make it again - Comes out perfect every time. I add sweet paprika, pepper and a dash of all purpose seasoning and a dash of seasoning salt. I leave out the flour from the crumb mixture, as suggested before, I dip the chicken in the flour first, then the egg (I mix a little buttermilk in with the egg) and then in the crumb mixture. My entire family LOVES THIS CHICKEN! Definitely a keeper! Thank you so much for sharing!! :0)

This was good and very easy.  I added about 1/2 tsp garlic powder to the breading mixture.  We liked this but found the breading a little "heavy".  Not sure what can be done about that.  Very flavorful though.

This was very good.  The cracker coating was nice and crunchy.  We made a honey mustard sauce to go along with it.  Next time, I think I will make a mushroom gravy like one other reviewer suggested.

This was really good and really easy. I'm normally not a big fan of pan-fried chicken, but this was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. My picky family said it was just how chicken is supposed to taste! I did salt it a little after it was done. Also, after I started making it, I realized I didn't have any potato flakes so I substituted Italian bread crumbs instead. Will definitely make this again, thank you for sharing this.

Wow, I've never fried anything before, and this was super easy!  I'm learning to cook for my soon-to-be husband, and he loved it.  I didn't have saltines on hand, so I crushed cornflakes and it turned out great.  I also cut the breasts into bite sized pieces (like popcorn chicken) so they fried up nice and quick!  Will definitely try all the spice suggestions.  Great Recipe!

Not too much to write here.  Kids loved it and compared to most recipes very easy.  I did use chicken tenderloins, "wheat" saltines which are a light brown, doubled the seasoned salt, added paprika and a good dash of cayenne per some other reviewers suggestions.

Loved it.  Very moist, flavorful chicken that the kids wil eat!

I used legs and thighs (that’s what I had on hand),  and as another reviewer suggested I battered and browned them first and then put them in the oven at 375 for half and hour.   I used a pan with a grate so they did not get mushy.  Turned out Great!

I've never cooked anything else besides instant noodles in the kitchen. This is the first recipe I'd tried, and my goodness, the end result is amazing! After trying out what some users said about adding more spices & pressing the meat onto the crumbs, then egg, then followed by crumbs again, the fillets turned out absolutely delicious.

I rate this 5 stars but only with the addition of more spice.  As is it would be too bland.  I used 2 tsp. seasoned salt plus 1 tsp. italian seasoning.  It would be good with many other seasonings according to personal taste.  It's a really nice, crunchy breading.  Easy and good.

I made this using chicken tenders so it cooked a little faster.  Wonderful recipe!!  I didn't have potato flakes, but I went ahead and tried it anyway.  My husband and I loved it.  I will definitely be making this on a regular basis.

this was a great starter recipe. I cut my chicken breasts into strips and added poultry seasoning to the saltines. The kids looooved it and asked to have it again the next night!

I had to play with this a tiny bit before I loved it.  I added quite a bit more seasoned salt and pepper and onion flakes.  I also made it several times before realizing that it would be better with chicken cutlets instead of the thicker breasts.  That seemed to make a huge difference.  The fourth time I made it I served it with a honey mustard dressing and it was T-RIFFIC! Thanks for a great recipe, the crunch is awesome!

This was really yummy and simple to prepare.  I've never had fried chicken turn out so well.  I followed other reviewer's suggestions and added some paprika & garlic powder to my cracker crumbs.  Didn't have saltine's, so I used Ritz crackers....just as good.  Really delicious.  Served with Mom's Country Gravy also from this sight.  Even my 1 year old loved it.  Will definitely add to our normal recipe rotation!

YUM-O!!! I made this last nite and it was SO yummy. I pressed the chicken down to get the crumbs like others did. Tasted even better the next day!  I used 1 tsp of paprika. I would make this again AND again.  Thanks for this recipe!

This recipe was pretty good overall but there is not enough spice in my opinion. Adding seasoned salt, a little pepper, and a pinch of onion powder really help with the flavor.  It has really good texture though and is isnt dry at all.

This recipe is excellent. I pounded them with a meat mallet and then cut them into stips (chicken fingers)added a little garlic powder and then I breaded them and put them in the frig until I cooked them for dinner. I served them with BBQ sauce and honey! YUM!

I just tried this receipe tonight and my finnicky sister and husband loved the chicken.  I read a few reviews before cooking and many people said it needed more seasoning.  They were right on.  Instead of 1 tsp. of season salt I used 2 tsps.  This receipe rocks!

First time I’ve ever made fried anything, and the crust stayed on. Cassie Wicks, God bless you :oD 

I pounded the chicken breasts until they were pretty thin, & well, mangled.  The first one, I used the - I’m sorry, I don’t know the technical term for it - the bumpy side of the food hammer thing, and it looked odd, like it had been gnawed by a wild animal, so the next one I just used the flat side.  I then sprinkled them with salt, pepper, garlic & onion powder, & set them in the fridge for an hour. 

Now, I had a problem with the amounts of things.  I always have a problem with this type of thing, so it may very well be just my own ignorance. Nevertheless, I used 2 eggs instead of one because the chicken was huge after it had been pounded. And I used an entire sleeve of saltines, again because of the size of the chicken, and Parmesan cheese - about half a cup - instead of potato flakes, about half a cup of flour, & a LOT more oil than was called for.  And this was for only two breasts. ( ! )

Anyway, the end result was really very pretty, and tasty.  NONE of the crust fell off while it was cooking, which has never EVER happened for me before, so I am so super tickled about that.  The crust is a bit bland on its own, but if you season your chicken, it is a delightful crust, & compliments the meat very nicely, in my opinion.  And my very particular husband liked it, so that settles it for me.  This is most assuredly something I will be using again.

I think next time I'll use thin sliced chicken since using thick breasts was a bit tough and bland.  The breading was flavorful but not as crispy as I thought it would be. I probably will try making this again because it definitely has potential!

This was okay but not enough flavor for me. I even added other seasonings, but not quite what I was wanting. If you are looking for something quick and easy that everyone will eat, then this is a good choice.

This recipe was great!  My husband really liked it.  I did use ritz crackers because I didn't have saltines; added some garlic powder and paprika.  I also dipped the chicken in flour before the egg mixture.  I will definitely make this again, but I will spice it up some more, a great base.  Thank you for sharing Cassie!

Very good!  My family loved it and begged me to make it again soon.  I did add paprika and garlic powder as one reviewer suggested - I also added garlic pepper because I didn;t have seasoned salt.  Lastly, I covered the chicken in the skillet and cooked on a medium low heat - it was so moist and delicious...enjoy!!!!

I thought this was darn good! My wife said it was better than KFC! I don't usually make the same recipe more than once, but I will make this one again.  I didn't use the potato flakes 'cause I didn't have any on hand but the chicken came out really great!

This is the BEST batter recipe EVER! The only thing that I changed is instead of regular dried potato flakes I used garlic flavored potato flakes...it was  yummy. THe batter stays on so well and it just has the best flavor. The only thing that I would recommend is using thiner breasts or strips. We used thicker breasts and you couldn't taste enough of the yummy breading. But that was my mistake! TOO GOOD! YUM, YUM, YUM!

Yum!  I added extra seasoning, at other's recommendation, good thing, I still could've added more!  The crust is wonderful and the chicken was juicey.  I did flour the chicken before the egg wash, seemed to help the coating stick.  I pan fried these in my iron skillet and, since my chicken breasts were so big and thick, I put them in the oven at 300F to finish cooking (if it needed it), plus I needed to cook the rest of the chicken.  I finished the meal and cleaned up the kitchen while these were in the oven (15 min. at most).  Mashed potatoes and sweet peas were my side items.  My dh piled his plate up and ate it all, said it hit the spot and rubbed it out!  I like that!

This was tasty, the chicken stayed very moist. The only thing I changed was I added a tbsp. of garlic powder to the crackers. I recommend flavoring the breasts before breading with whatever spices you enjoy.

Outstanding and incredibly easy!  Big hit with the family.  The only change was using Ritz crakers and additions of spices into the cracker mix (garlic powder, lots of black pepper, paprika, seasoned salt and shallot pepper) -- will definitely become a staple!

My boyfriend and I LOVED this dish!! I was a little skeptical while cooking it,but trust me, the flavor is awesome!!! Next time I'll be sure to crunch up the crackers better, because I had a small problem with the coating falling off the chicken. Thanks for this recipe!! I will use it frequently in the future

i dredge the chicken pieces in flour first, so the egg wash has something to stick to, then omit the flour from the breading mixture.  you can leave out the cracker crumbs and just use potato flakes if you're in a hurry.  this is a light and tasty breading and my whole family loves chicken done this way - we've always called it "fish fried chicken" or "chicken fish"

Very good...just like the restaurants. I used bone in thighs and legs and had some trouble gauging if the chicken was cooked through. Next time I will try the boneless/skinless.  Immediately after removing from oil, I placed on paper towels and quickly sprinkled salt over it - delish! Edit: I made this again tonight using chicken breasts and it was fantastic. I forgot to sprinkle with the salt - but it was still excellent.  My husband said he could eat chicken like this every night!

This went over great with my family!! My husband is very picky and he loved it. I left everything the same but added onion powder, more galic powder and adobo. I also made gravy with the drippings from the pan it came out great. Will use again!!

I loved it! My husband liked it better than regular cutlets with bread crumbs. They came out nice and crunchy! I seasoned the crackers with garlic powder, italian seasoning, and pepper. Next time I will add even more. Thanks for the great recipe!

Fantastic!  It was really easy to make, with just ingredients lying around the house. I'm only 15 and I cook a lot, and my whole family loved this one!  I used the seasoning salt, some garlic powder, cayenne, and just a LIL bit of chili flakes, which was probably the best part.  It added a good spicyness in the background.  Anyways, it came out perfect, and really quickly too.  I thought the inside of the chicken would be bland but it wasn't, it was really great!  Thanks, I'll make this again!

really good.  i added garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, cayenne, and some salt.  then i realized these are all the stinkin' ingredients in cajun seasoning!  derrr!  also, i just cooked it till it was done on one side, flipped it and did the same on the other and crushed the crackers till they were pretty fine.  also, i didn't have any potato flakes so i didn't use them. it still was great.

Even my preschoolers loved it.  I do recommend breading it and then putting the chicken back in the fridge for an hour.  I makes the breading (crackers) stick well.   I double breaded a few for my hubby and he just loved them!

This is a great recipe. First of all, I divided the recipe by 3 to feed myself and my fiance. We also left out the potato flakes and used a slightly higher amount of seasoning salt. Fiance LOVED this. I personally am somewhat scared of chicken and so it takes a pretty good recipe for me to eat ALL my chicken. Will definitely make again. Served with corn on the cob and salad.

This was delicious, I didn't have saltine crackers so, like someone had mentioned, used Ritz crackers instead. I kept everything else as the recipe called for and it was great. The chicken was very moist and the coating had a nice flavor...this ones a keeper.

OUTSTANDING! My family loved this - especially my daughter who is very picky.  My husband is not a big fan of chicken but enjoyed this as well.  I decided to use Betty Crocker's Sour Cream and Chive potato flakes as another user suggested.  I also added 1 tsp of garlic powder and a tad extra pepper.  I also used Ritz crackers as another user also suggested.  I decided to pound the chicken to tenderize it and allow for quicker cooking.  Would make this again hands down.

I thought this was a pretty good recipe.  I added my usual spices to the flour and cracker mixture (season all, garlic salt, etc.).  I added hotsauce to the egg mixture and I double coated the chicken.  It came out very crispy.  Although my family didn't rave about it, everyone thought it was a good change.  Will probably make again.

We found this one, and it is one of those recipes we keep in a safe place.  It is very easy to make, and you can't go wrong.  We added about 1 tbsp of powdered Ranch Dressing to the mix and it was wonderful!  We recommend this one to anyone!

I made this twice -- the first time with Mrs. Cubbison's herb stuffing from a box and the second time with ritz crackers.  Both were good but the herb flavored bread crumbs had more flavor.  I added extra spices: garlic powder, minced onion, herbes de provence (first try), finnes herbs (second time) and cayenne pepper.  I didn't measure the spices and hubby thought I went too heavy on the pepper.  The recipe as is would have been much too bland for us.  But what a great method and idea to have chicken fried chicken!

Very easy and very yummy!  The kids loved it. I used a food processor to crush the saltine crackers.  It coats much better this way.  I did not have any potatoe flakes on hand but it still came out crispy on the outside and tender in the inside.  Thank you for the great recipe.

This was delicious!  I served it for the first time when my mom and grandma were in town.  We all loved it, including my 4 yr old daughter whose favorite chicken is "chicken tenders".  I have to add though that like some of the others, I pounded the chicken flat.  I also added extra seasonings that my family likes, such as Morton's Nature seasonings, season salt and extra pepper.  This recipe is great because there is a lot of room for experimenting. You can add a dash of this and a dash of that and it turns out great!

I knew this must have been great when hubby actually mentioned it a couple of days after I made it and he doesn't even like white breast meat! I did pound it flat like others mentioned. This made it look more like a chicken fried steak pattie and hubby loves those. I thought it was delicious and very crisy too even leftover the next night. The white meat even stayed moist. I cooked it in my deep fryer machine. My only comment..it came out really dark brown on the verge of looking burned or over done when it wasn't. I like my fried chicken to look a little more golden. I often have leftover saltines so I'll probably make it again. Thanks Cassie.

Excellent fried chicken!  It tastes just like extra crispy KFC.  I agree with the other reviewers that you need to add more seasoning otherwise the chicken tastes a little bland.

EXCELLENT!!! Crispiest chicken I have ever had.  I agree with other reviewers, that it could use a little more seasoning, but overall, the best fried chicken I ever had.  I am a little curious though, how it could only have five fat grams, this must be an error??!!

This was so delicious and it is even more yummy the next day when it is cold.  This has now become my fried chicken recipe.  My daugher will even eats this like it is candy.  She usually never eats much fried chicken.  She is only 3 and all day long she will go in at the fridge and get some. I cut a big piece up for her in there.  My son who is 10 ate 4 pieces for dinner.  Haven't seen him eat that much in a long time.  So, this is definately a keeper at our house and I look forward to sharing the recipe with friends.  I think I will have a family get together and make this chicken.  I followed the recipe exact except I used more egg to dip the chicken in.  I think I used like 4 eggs.  I had some huge chicken breasts and was able to cut some into two-three pieces.  So, don't know since I had like 20 pieces of chicken if that is why I needed more egg.  The breaded ingredients were just enough for all the chicken I had.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  :o)

It was delicious. I’ll make again but use more oil. I didn’t have the amount called for. I soaked chicken in buttermilk for a couple of hours to keep it juicy. Also dipped in egg, flour, egg and cracker mixture. Very good!

I have used a similar recipe for years, the potato flakes are totally optional. I use flour, then egg wash, then crushed saltines. I let them sit in the fridge for about 30 mins so the breading locks in good and then I fry them. So good with a little Italian dressing drizzled on them ! This recipe is also great for mild tasting fish, such as Pacific Whiting, Swai, Cod, Pollack..

Made this and loved it!!  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and followed another's suggestion about baking it in the oven.  WOW!!  I also added 1/2 stick melted butter after 35 minutes and allowed the breasts to cook another 5 minutes.  Baked at 400 degrees.  Deliciousness and crispy!!  Will make again!!  Had a little left over and ate it for lunch today.  Very yummy cold too.

My fiancé is on a low fod  map diet so I used gluten-free flour blend and rice crispies ground up about 1 1/2 cups each,  Salt, pepper, Cayenne pepper, and a dash of thyme.  I used chicken tenderloin strips and dipped them in an egg wash of one egg and almond milk then tossed them in the coating.  I fried them in sunflower olive oil combination with just a little bit of bacon fat. THEY WERE GREAT.  The potato flakes I think made them wonderful! He is a picky eater and he loves them. THEY were VERY moist.  I served with salad and jasmine rice with butter. Thanks for this recipe, chef!! The oil is conquistador brand  olive oil combination, it’s a terrific oil and I bought it at a Mexican shopping center!

I added extra potato flakes. Did not marinate in buttermilk as I find that it has such a small effect that it is not worth the time.
I fried them breast in a much smaller amount of oil. The end product was delicious.

Excellent!!!! I pounded the chicken to an even thickness and gave each piece a shake of salt, pepper and garlic powder before i soaked them in buttermilk for a few hours. Other than that I followed the recipe and my family loved it!

WE ALL LOVED THIS!  Okay, so very few changes per our taste and cooking style and it was fantastic. 
Using cut-up boneless breast, wash then pat dry.
Next: We added salt & pepper to the flour, then drench chicken pieces in that first.
THEN dip in egg - flour first, then egg.
Next, you go to the cracker mix after the egg.  We also added salt, pepper, marjoram, and dill seasonings to the cracker mix and I think that helped because it was a hit.  Very flavorful and I was asked the same week to make it again.
Thank you, CASSJW, this is a keeper!
Update - made it again for some guests and everyone loved it!

I made as is, except I ended up making more of the cracker mixture part-way thru, and using two more eggs. I was running out, mainly because I used boneless skinless breasts, and cut them into chicken strips, so I had a lot more surface area to cover. This is a new favorite. I would double the cracker recipe and use three or four eggs when doing strips, and adding more salt or flavor to the mixture.  Note to self: oven setting between 4-5 to keep oil the correct temperature.  Cook the strips about 4-5 minutes per side, and they'll turn out mid- to dark brown and crispy. Thanks for sharing!!

Easiest fried chicken dinner I’ve ever made. I followed the recipe exactly. I may add chili pepper the next time to add a little spice.

I added some lemon pepper and a little onion salt to spice it up a bit. Both my kids loved it and that is saying something. This is a new family favorite, so tender, flavorful, and juicy!

I made this recipe with chicken tenderloins and nuggets cut from tenderloins. In addition to the recipe ingredients, I added 1 tsp each of garlic powder and parsley and 1/2 tsp of paprika. The coating was tasty and crispy, but there are no wild flavors here; if I didn't have to feed kids, I might prefer more spice. This was super easy to make using a food processor - the 12 year old felt pretty accomplished. The kids insisted that this recipe tastes like a Chik-Fil-A copycat; I wouldn't go that far. The kids loved it, but to be fair, they've never met a chicken nugget they didn't like. I will almost certainly make this again.

Turned out tender and moist. I cut the recipe in half and only had chicken breast tenders in the freezer. I also ended up baking them....long day at work, didn't want to clean up oil mess....so 400* for 20 minutes, turning after the first 10. The man was happy and commented on how pretty the chicken looked! All is well with the world when the chicken looks good! Thank you for sharing!

made this tonight and it was DELISH! I took the suggestion of other reviewers and added extra spices to the cracker/flower/potato flakes mixture. I also dredged the chicken in flour prior to dipping in the egg. We used boneless, skinless chicken thighs because we had them on hand. Next time will try with bone-in.

I made this on a whim, I had chicken breasts out and was at a loss what to do.  I followed this as close as my pantry allowed me to and it was fantastic!  I would have never thought about using fake potatoes in breading but I feel like it really thickened it up.  I did dredge in flour first, then egg, then the breading.  I browned them in my cast iron skillet, then finished in the oven.  325 for about 15 minutes... the flavor was awesome and the chicken was still moist.  Thank you!  This is a keeper and will be going in my recipe book!

Delicious! I’ve never made fried chicken so the only changes I made; I soaked the chicken in buttermilk for 2 hours before starting and since I didn’t want to buy potato flake for 2T, I just threw a handful of plain potato chips in with the saltines. Turned out fantastic!

I made this chicken for the first time the other night and it turned out amazing! I added a little extra spices to it, and went the traditional brown paper bag route when I was dredging the chicken. However, other than that, this recipe was A++. Tasted like the southern fried chicken that I grew up with. Totally will make again!

Loved this chicken. I dredged in flour first,  then egg, and last cracker mixture.  Pan fried in a little oil and came out really crispy.

Delicious! I made some changes: 
1. Always brine chicken beforehand at least 30 min.
2. Added buttermilk (I made my own with apple cider vinegar and milk) and hot sauce to egg  for better coating and flavor.
3. Hand coated the breading instead of shaking it. Much better coating though messier!
4. Added adobo seasoning and garlic powder to coating mix.
5. Baked chicken once heated to 160 degrees in oven for 5 minutes at 350 degrees to ensure doneness.
6. Used legs and thighs with bone and skin.

My family loved this chicken! My husband ate four pieces and it was juicy thanks to the brine!

Great Recipe!! I did follow a reviewers advice about dipping in Flour, Egg than coating . Turned out to be the best coating I have ever made. My whole family LOVED it.
Thank You to the Recipe sharer and the reviewer with the coating tip.

Excellent recipe for pounded out chicken breasts.  I made it twice now.  I did add a sprinkle of poultry seasoning, a little ginger, and some blackened seasoning.  Most excellent.   I can't wait to try it with the next tough steaks i buy and even center cut pork chops.    Thank yuo.

After reviewing several versions, got to the grocery and could not remember which ingredients sounded best, so I decided to try them all!  I thought my husband was going to cry after his first bite. Try dredging flattened chicken breasts in this order:
Beaten egg then  flour then  buttermilk then saltine crumbs.   A little more work but the best of all possible combinations.

I made this for football Sunday and all the guys loved it! I didn't have dryer potato flakes so I used 2 tablespoons of crushed plain potato chips instead! Gave it a nice crunch! Way better and much juicer than any of those big name chicken restaurants

Followed directions and turned out perfect (6 mins each side with thin cut chicken breasts). Will probably add a bit more pepper/other flavoring next time, but the chicken was cooked perfectly and crust was crispy, and not too difficult-more messy than anything.

this is a great recipe! Glad I found it. The chicken was really good and coating stayed on.  I dipped my chicken in flour first, then  the eggs  last the crumbs. I will use this recipe for chicken from now on. Thanks for posting it! I used skinless boneless chicken but made the white gravy to go with it.

Great base for fried chicken!  I used another reviewers suggestion and dredged in flour first then egg and then cracker coating. I did add some seasonings to the crackers...seasoned salt, garlic powder, a pinch of cayenne.  Tried to keep oil at 350, which seems to be the perfect temp for getting a good crunch without burning the coating. Used meat thermometer to watch my tenderized breast tenders so they didn't over cook. Definitely not a "hands off" dish, you have to stay with it the whole time, but worth it!

It's been several years since I regularly fried chicken, and I'd lost my confidence in my ability to do it well. This recipe turned out great, and I will turn to it again and again.

I made this for my husband tonight on chicken tenders instead of the chicken breast halves. It was easy to make, and he absolutely loved them! I'll definitely make it again!

Truly a 5-Star recipe.  This is the first time ever that I was able to make this kind of fried chicken and very pleased with it.  My husband and children loved it.    

Also, I read someone else's suggestion about dipping in flour first, then egg, then the crumb mixture.  I think that helped a lot.  Next time I will double up on the seasoning.  Still, a great and easy recipe.  

Thanks for sharing this!

I followed the recipe and directions exactly as described with 1 exception - I had to substitute the Saltines with Club crackers (no Saltines on hand). I don't normally fry food, but I was desperate for a quick and easy meal that used chicken breasts. I was so glad I gave this a try! It was very good- tender, crispy, flavorful.  I used a meat thermometer in the oil to make sure it stayed at the right temp and then stabbed it into the breasts at the end of cook time to make sure they were completely cooked. Whole family loved them! I will definitely be fitting this into our dinner rotation. Thanks!

It was good, but it was a little messy to make (or it could've just been me).  Not sure if I'd make this again.

The crackers make this so amazingly crispy. It needs to be seasoned better. I would recommend a buttermilk and tabasco soak and then adding some cayenne pepper and garlic powder to the crust.

My family LOVED this recipe!  I had not made fried chicken in over 20 years.  This recipe was awesome!  I did add a little cayenne pepper just to give it some kick.  Not much though, didn't want to over do it.  Chicken was beautiful, juicy on the inside and oh so delicious.

i would definitely dip it in flour first, then the egg and then breading. otherwise the breading falls off in the pan when you pan fry it! Great revipe though! definitely a keeper!

This was the best fried chicken we have ever had!! Was very quick and easy to make. I used ritz crackers instead of saltines as they have slightly more taste. I also used chicken tenders as that was the only chicken I had. My husband and kids said it was so crispy and yet soo juicy. Great for a weeknight meal. Will make many more times. Thank you very much for sharing!

Part of my success is due to the fact that I bought a fryer. I'm horrible at frying it just makes me cringe to dunk my food in a vat of oil, but some dishes don't taste right baked or otherwise. So this will be a once in a while thing but this recipe was wonderful with the right tools.
Oh I took a star off because I used thighs which were juicy and perfect. Breasts tend to be so dry the meatier it is ,and I hate the process of removing a bunch of fat off thighs but this baby was worth it.

OMG I cannot believe I have never made chicken breasts like this before.  So juicy, tender and delicious.  I only added onion and garlic power as others suggested.  Next time I will dredge in flour first, then egg and then the coating.  Loved it will be making this again.  Thanks for posting.  Forgot to add: so yummy the next day cold.....

We didn't have saltines, so I used Ritz. It turned out so good I mixed up a little more and used it for fried okra. It was salty, I'm guessing because of the RItz, but that's the way my husband likes it, so I wouldn't change a thing. As far as cook time, it was on the table at an edible temp (slightly cooled) by the 20 minute of cook time mark, so it cooked faster than expected, probably in 15 minutes (I did quarter my breasts). I cooked on just over medium heat with a good sizzle the entire time.

I like this recipe, mine came out very good, but it all depends on how and what spices and herbs are used. Also if one practice it will just get better. I did not get the crispy consistency I wanted the first time. I will cook it again and have a hard look at what I must do before I do it again, some consideration on how to go about it. The recipe is tops!

The coating was great. My husband and I both loved it but the problem was cooking the chicken all the way through w/o burning the outside.  I'll definitely make it again but will bake the chicken for 30 min before frying.

I made this as directed, except I soaked my chicken breasts in buttermilk for a few hours. Then I drained them and dusted them in flour before doing the egg wash and the cracker crumbs. I also added more spices as another reviewer suggested. The chicken turned out nicely, crunchy outside and juicy inside. However, I was disappointed in the flavor. Even with extra spices, it tasted too much like saltine crackers to me.

As is with any recipe, technic is important.  Personal taste is also key.  Like other comments, I added paprika but took out some of the salt. I didn't have all the saltines so I added Ritz. This give a depth of buttery richness we like but can add salty which we don't. So that's why I used less salt.  I used boneless breasts!!!! But I don't flattened them, I cut them in chunks.   I cooked them about 6 minutes per side and depending on how thick they are, that should be good.  They were so moist and juicy.  My whole picky family loved these so I will be making this recipe from now on. ps I completely agree that the coating must be quite dark not golden brown to get the full flavor and keep in the moistness

Made absolutely NO CHANGES!!! This is a favorite for me. I use more oil in my skillet to cook it faster and make sure my chicken breast is thin so it cooks evenly. Make it atleast once a month.

This recipe is great - my husband requests this dish more than any other.  Usually a dinner recipe but also made it with waffles for brunch!  I don't know what potato flakes are so have never used them.  Also realized that Lawry's seasoned salt has way more flavor than other brands.  When I ran out, I used a different brand and was disappointed with the recipe and couldn't figure out why at first.  You need Lawry's.

Wow!  I love this recipes!  I made my chicken with skinless legs and thighs since my husband would rather eat dark meat. I'm all about flavor so after looking at some of the suggestions for spices, I added 1 tsp each of garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, parsley flakes, seasoning salt and Cavender's Greek Seasoning.  I added about 1/2 tsp fresh ground black pepper. I use a tube of saltines and crush them coarsely with a rolling pin. I fry in a iron skillet at a medium heat for about 25 minutes.  My family loves it!

Fantastic! I put some buttermilk in the egg and let the chicken soak in it for 15 min. Ground up gluten free crackers (Mrs. Crimbles pesto & glutino table) in grinder. Used 16 crackers & halved ingredients. Coated 9 drum sticks. Fried 15 minutes total. Used 1/4tsp each garlic, onion powder and celery salt.

In a very budget-minded week I planned to make this dish, but found that I didn't have all the ingredients.  Instead of crackers, I crumbed a half-bag of pretzels, added 1 tsp of garlic powder, 1 tsp of salt, 1 tsp of pepper, 2 tbsp. flour, dipped in 2 eggs then the mix.  Then baked at 425 degrees until chicken was done.  Turned out delicious and with everything we already had in the kitchen!

We used some crutons instead of the crackers and it turned out delicious.  I also double dregged my chicken to give it a nice thick coating. My children, three and eleven loved the meal and are looking forward to sandwiches with the leftovers.

Delicious! This reminded me of my Texas roots when Grandma used to make fried chicken. It was crisp, moist and easy to make. I topped it with white gravy and mixed some of the fried batter that flaked off in the frying pan in the gravy. Very tasty.

Loved it!! Perfectly crispy, nice and juicy, great simple seasoning.  I doubled the salt and pepper cause I know our preferences. I also added a little water to the egg wash, and double coated the chicken. Quick and super simple to make. This will become a standard in our kitchen!

My family is very picky on how chicken is made. So when I found this recipe and suggested it for supper it was asked if I could make it into strips instead, so I tried it as strips. And we LOVED it. The next time I made it we added Parmesan to it as well for extra flavour and we loved it even more.

This was awesome! I threw these in the deep fryer (2 at a time, since we have a smaller sized one) and cooked for 10 minutes at 350. They were moist, and so crunchy. The flavor was excellent. I ended up having to use two eggs to dip them in when prepping. And as directed by another user, I dipped in regular flour first, then egg, then the coating. Will definitely be using the recipe again in the future!

Such a good recipe! I made it last night for me and my bf I ended up eating it all ( small pieces)before he got home lol . I added garlic with parsley powder and a little chilli powder. Used regular salt instead of season salt. Sooooo yummy! I also double dipped my chicken. Eggs, cracker,eggs then cracker.

I just made (and ate) this chicken and it is to die for!!!  I split the breasts in half so they were thinner (did not pound).  I dipped in AP flour, egg, then the crumb coating.  They fried up beautifully.  I didn't deep fry them but had just enough oil in the pan to come up along the sides.  They cooked very quickly since they were thin.  I'll definitely be making this again and again!

I started this recipe before I checked for saltines. I should have known better in a house full of teenage boys, there's never what you need when you need it!
I scrambled through the kitchen and decided to use the crumbs in the bottom of a couple of Doritos bags.
I tripled the recipe (loosely) and used approximately equal parts of potato flakes, flour & Doritos crumbs. 
I used the seasoned salt and black pepper and added some garlic powder (about equal to the seasoning salt)- because everything is better with garlic.
I also used cubed chicken breasts- not bone-in chicken.
And I did flour the chicken before the egg dip- I always have, and it always seems crispier that way.
 I assume they were great, because as the batches came out of the fryer, they were devoured. I never got to actually try them, but 4 out of 5 boys have asked when I'm making them again!
I look forward to the next batch!

I changed the amount of seasoned salt to 1 TABLEspoon and added a tablespoon of granulated garlic.  I also took a reviewer's suggestion to dip the chicken first in flour, then in egg and then in the breading.  It turned out delicious!  We will definitely be making it again.  I cut my breasts and thighs into thirds to make more manageable portion sizes.  We had a lot leftover so I reheated it the next day by bringing the pieces to room temperature and then baking at 357° Farenheit for 20 minutes, and it was every bit as good as the first time around.  Next time I will try freezing leftovers and reheating in the oven.  I think it could make for a great freezer meal!

After reading several reviews before trying it, we made sure to use lots of extra flavorings.  First, we bought potato flakes that had garlic seasoning already mixed in.  I added the flakes to the flour and put that into one bowl.  I put the finely crushed crackers, 1 T seasoned salt, 1 t. black pepper, 1 t. garlic powder, 1/2 t. paprika and 1/2 t. poultry seasoning all together into another bowl.  The 3rd bowl had the blended egg.  I dredged the chicken in the flour/flake mix, then the egg, then the cracker and topped with another coating of the flour/flake mix.  Also, my mom always left her chicken sit for about 10 minutes after coating it so that it would "adhere" a little better to the chicken.  Also, make sure your chicken isn't too crowded in the skillet, it needs room so you can flip it without removing the coating.  The pieces really shouldn't touch while they are frying.  My husband and I made this for his mom and dad and we all enjoyed the flavor and the crispiness.  We would make it again.  I hate altering a recipe so much as far as the spices but I can see where it might be rather bland without it.

Made this a couple weeks ago and my wife has been licking her lips ever since. Did do what another poster had said and put the chicken in flour first then the egg and then into the cracker mixture. Added some flavoured(sic) crackers as well.

Just made this. I followed the recipe adding a little more spices, I wish I would have added more..I used chicken thighs. I did do like another person, dipped chicken in flour then in cracker crum then back in flour. I fried it at 400 degrees in an electro skillet for 30 minutes.  I cooked them 15 minutes per side. They came out perfect. Will definetly make again.

My husband absolutely loved this fried chicken! He talked about how good it was for several days. Making it again tonight with thighs we got on a good deal. Excited to see how it turns out this time!

The flavor was great, added garlic powder, paprika, extra salt.  But as one other reviewer said I think I'll do the coating the old fashion way, as I lost a lot of the coating while frying.  I never had that problem with pork chops, fish etc.. But aside from the coating technique it was great!

I made this last night for dinner. It was my first time ever making fried chicken, and I think I did pretty darn well. I followed the advice of several reviews on here and added to the recipe. It was amazing (my husband raved), the only thing I will do next time is add more pepper and maybe more paprika and crushed red peppers. I did cut skinless, boneless chicken breasts into pieces to cook it faster. I also did dip them in flour,then egg, and then breading and it did stick really well while cooking.

I added seasoned salt, oregiono, crushed red peppers, and paprika.

The end result was amazing! I will definetly be making this again soon.

These were very good. I sliced the breasts horizontally and pounded them out to a uniform thickness.  Otherwise followed the recipe as written.Paired these with cream gravy and mashed potatoes and it was a knockout dish.

Great recipe. My hard to please kids thought it was the best chicken we ever had. I substituted Panko for the potato flakes and I followed some of the other reviewers ideas; cutting the pieces into tenders, using flour before the egg dash and i added garlic powder. Next time I will fool around with adding more spices. I used corn oil at a medium/low setting and put in six peices at a time turning every two minutes until they were dark brown. The crust is excellant and the chicken was tender, hot, and juicy. Winner!

Well let me tell you this recipe is AWESOME. I don't do fried anything often but this was good. I do recommend that you add more seasoning to your taste. I seasoned the meat and flour mix. Crackers/potatos just made it crispy and just has a different type of crust. Thank You

I liked the chicken but I think next time I will use breadcrumbs instead of crackers.  I would also like to use some more seasoning to give it a kick.  My family (including 3 very picky chihuahuas) really enjoyed it.

This was an awesome recipe. I also cut my chicken into tenders and did like one lady suggested and dregged the chicken in flour first, then the egg and the cracker mixture. Made a wonderful crispy and tasty coating and the chicken stayed moist. No leftovers.

I would give this probably a 4.5. It came out really good. I had flattened the breasts because I was making another recipe at the time. So I had flattened breasts on hand. I had to make more breading only because of the flat breasts. Came out great. Everyone loved it.

I added some Garlic spread but other than that I followed the recipe, my hubby said I out did my self. In the reviews I read no one said what went good with the Chicken so I just made roasted potatoes with Garlic they went very well together. I will add this chicken to my menu from now on, thanks :)

One of the only times I've made skinless fried chicken and did not pitch the recipe when I was done.   Very tasty.   I went way heavier on the seasoning amounts, but that's personal taste.   The whole family loved it.    Super easy to make too.   A keeper!

It's the best fried chicken I've ever made. The breading was crisp. I have always fought with fried chicken. But, this was super easy. The only thing that I added was hot sauce to the eggs. Kids went nuts over this. I will definitely make this again.

I just (mostly) saw my ol' country family recipe. best ever! 
-add lil buttermilk to egg (better adheshion)
-play with your own season mix, that's the magic!

I tried it today and it was good. I did have a whole chicken in parts. I covered each piece with flour as others have suggested. I then add it to the eggs(3) mixture. I tried the plastic bag method but added other spices since I did not have the seasoned salt. The only problem I did encountered was the frying time. I over cooked the last pieces and they burned, but that was my fault.

I thought this was a great basic recipe and with some adjustments it was awesome. I added about 1T dry ranch seasoning to the cracker mixture. I also cut my chicken into thin strips and seasoned them with a salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder mixture. Then I dredged in flower before egg and then the cracker mixture. Kids ate it up and I used drippings from drained skillet to make white gravy for the potatoes.

Good and easy recipe. I followed the previous suggestions and dredged the chicken in flour first. then dipped in egg and crackers. Fried it in coconut oil. turned out very delicious.

Amazing recipe. My family was raving for hours!!! soooooo easy and the flavor/ crispiness is perfect. I did modify the recipe a bit by doing an egg wash then dipped chicken in seasoned flour, another egg wash then in the cracker crumbs. This really helped keep the chicken moist. I also added famous dave's chicken seasoning to the cracker mix. We bought giant chicken breasts from walmart and fried them for about 30 minutes. Highly recommend this one!!!!

I really liked this. I do agree with some of the other reviewers that a little more kick could be added into the breading. Some more seasonings would not be amiss. I may add garlic powder and paprika in next time.

I wish I had cut the chicken breasts up, because they were too massive and didn't cook evenly in the oil. Also I didn't grind all the crackers up to a fine powder, and I left some tiny bits in which got a bit burned.  Maybe the mistakes were all my fault, but I was not really moved by this recipe. Kinda bland. One good point is that the outside was crunchy and the inside was juicy! Next time I'll try with some changes (cut up chicken, finer cracker powder, and more spices and seasonings!)

This makes the best fried chicken ever!  Since I live alone, I reduced the servings. Haven't figured out how to do 3/8 of an egg, so I just use a whole one. After years of study on saturated fat v. vegetable oil, I use lard to fry the chicken, and it's so much better than any vegetable oil or vegetable solid shortening, and, I guarantee you, safer eating!

I made this tonight for dinner. My dad was iffy about making batter/outside of the chicken with potato flakes. After I deep fried it golden brown. I let him try a piece and he loved it. I'll be using this in the future :)

I've prepared this recipe before and it's always a winner with my family.  I added a tsp of garlic powder with parsley, 1/2 tsp of Accent, an additional 1/2 tsp of season salt, and a tsp of paprika.  My chicken breast were huge so I sliced them in 1/2 lenghtwise and it cut down on the cooking time.  All the ingredients married very well together.  This recipe is mow a staple in my home.

Mostly tasteless and very plain.  It needs some kick like say from some Cayenne pepper and A LOT OF EXTRA SEASONING SALT or regular salt or something.  I have never sprinkled table salt on fried chicken befor this.  Otherwise, not bad.

Never having made fried chicken before, I've got to say this was an easy and delicious recipe.  Like others, I added more seasonings to my batter.  I added "Garlic Garlic" from Tastefully Simple, about 1 tsp of Paprika and an All-Purpose season blend.  It turned out wonderful.  I also used chicken breast strips instead of whole chicken breasts because they were on sale at my grocery store.  Will definitely be making this again.

Soo bad for you but very good recipe. I added garlic salt and milk to the eggs. I let them sit in the bag for a while so the coating set in. Next time I'll try to bake them and spritz them with olive oil for a more healthier version while still keeping that crunch

Pretty good fried chicken!  Husband liked it; he's taking a piece for lunch tomorrow.  Used chicken thighs and instead of seasoned salt, added some garlic salt and powder, onion powder, paprika and dried parsley.  Had to cook over 30 minutes, and still the larger thigh was not cooked all the way through.  Also, didn't have "dry potato flakes" (I'm Irish...so there's never any instant potatoes in this house!)  :O)

This had great texture but I'll double the seasonings when I make it again.  I cut the chicken into thinner cutlets since I didn't think the breading could take 15 to 20 minutes in the pan if the meat needed that much time to cook.

Very very good! I did use pork chops instead of chicken (as unfortunately my chicken had gone bad) But it was super good! I WILL be making again! Thanks!

This is a very tasty recipe.  I did add the suggested seasonings and dipped flour first, but still had a problem with the breading coming off.  I wouldn't compare it to fried chicken, but is definitely a keeper! Thanks!

Best I've ever made!  I did make one change, (I know, I hate when people rate a changed recipe).  I had made this previously as per recipe and it was 'good', but this time I added Panko bread crumbs also in place of half of the crackers.  WOW!  It took it over the top because it make it more crispy.

I usually don't rate a changed recipe, but I wanted to share it with you all to try.

Great recipe! I added a little bit more spices to taste, but overall this recipe is a smash.  I never would have thought to add saltine crackers but it was delicious.  Will try again, thanks.

My boyfriend loved this chicken. He said it tasted even better the second day. I on the other hand was not too fond of it. I followed the recipe to a T. I wasnt keen on the flavor of the coating...a little blah. My boyfriend thanks you though!

Wow!  One of the best meals I've ever made.  We loved this!  I did add another 1/2 tsp of pepper, 1 tsp parsley, 1 tsp garlic powder, and 1/2 tsp paprika as suggested by another reviewer.  Didn't find it bland at all.  I also made Mom's Country Gravy from this site to serve with it and it was seriously delicious!

I had fun making and serving this recipe. It was easy and turned out beautifully. I added garlic powder and red pepper to the cracker mix and also dredged the chicken in flour before the egg. I deep fried these (4 at a time) at 350 degrees for 15 minutes and they were perfectly done. Thanks for a new recipe!! This one is a keeper!

Needs to be spiced up a bit.  I followed the directions and then added my own blend of spices.  Garlic powder, paprika, a bit of poultry seasoning, and a bit of thyme.  It was easy and delicious.  The kids loved it.  Will definately make again.

This was good!  I used 'Ritz' type crackers instead of saltines (all I had), forgot to add the flour, added extra potato flakes and spices (garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, etc...) and it turned out great!

Not bad, although the mixture was too bland for me. Anyone can doctor it up and add their own twist/signature to it by adding their favorite spices. I sure will do so. All in all, great base recipe for fried chicken. Will make again.

Great!  Served with country gravy and mashed potatoes and it was a hit.  Doubled the dry ingredients because of the large size chicken breasts I had.

this is the first time ive ever made chicken fried chicken.  it was amazing and easy.  i did make the mistake of making the oil too hot and they were raw inside, but i just battered them again and cooked them more on a lower heat.  it made them a little crunchy, which was really good.  my husband loved them.  :)

We loved it.  I followed someone's review about flouring the chicken before the egg mixture.  I also added garlic powder, pepper and salt to the flour mixture. My kids ate it up and it was delicious the next day cold. I will make this again very soon.

Thumbs up for this recipe!    It's incredibly easy, don't have to buy the generic brands, use ingredients that was sitting in your pantry for many years (e.g. crackers), and it actually looks like fried chicken. If I may say so, it's even better than restaurants'.  It also gets more kudos with how easy it is to customize in the seasoning department.  If you want it salty but with a garlic taste, add more garlic to the flour-bread mixture.  If you don't, then take away.    It's very easy and, with just one trial, made it my ultimate default for fried chicken.  Thank you for this amazing recipe!

Very good! Used 3 giant boneless skinless breasts, and cut them into strips. I did flour the chicken, then dredged in egg and cracker mix.  Added about 1 tsp of creole mix in, since w elike things hot, but really wasnt even enough to taste the creole. Will make again, maybe add more creole next time too!

so good - boyfriend loved it!! I took other's suggestions and used a combination of crackers- half ritz, half vegetable and it turned out great.  I crushed the crackers in a food processor to cut time.  I also put some cajun seasoning and garlic powder in the crackers in addition to the salt and pepper.

Oh, so good! Per other reviewers' suggestions, I did dip in seasoned flour first, then egg with a little buttermilk, then the cracker coating with extra seasoning. And, just because my kids like it better, I cut my chicken into small chunks before I fried in peanut oil. Excellent! Will definitely make again!

Great recipe. I doubled the recipe since I was cooking more chicken and it was really good.  I did however forget to put in the seasoned salt..I put regular salt in before I realized my error. But was super good anyway. Way to go cassjw

So good! I tenderized the chicken first just with a fork and I served it with white country gravy. Delicious! Better than cracker barrel!!

This is the only fried chicken recipe I was ever able to make correctly and have the flavor I was looking for.  I do use the cutlets with this recipe but every time the chicken comes out wonderful.

I have tried fried chicken recipes before, but this is my favorite thus far. I made an error and forgot to let the chicken sit before frying it. The chicken was still very crispy and yummy!! I would however add more spices than just the salt and pepper for more flavor!!

My kids LOVED this! I am not that good at frying chicken, but this was basically easy.  I used some roasted vegetable flavored ritz crackers instead of saltines and followed the other suggestion to roll the chicken in flour before the egg. The flavor is great and the chicken is crispy outside and tender inside.

I used this to make Chicken strips, (with the tenderloin) I didn't have potato flakes, but had everything else.  I also used Peanut oil to cook them in. They turned out brown and crispy, and juicy on the inside!   They were great!

It was good,I did not add the potato flakes and I used chicken tenders. I also added granulated garlic and added ground up croutons along with some dried thyme. I served it with homemade french fries and onion rings which i also received a recipe of the all recipe site.

WOW these were top notch!!! The entire family absolutely loved them. I almost took the advice of one reviewer but I chose to follow the recipe the first time so I could give an accurate review. Then the 2nd time I may try to bake them. But I think the recipe is a great one, they had great flavor and were very crunchy.

Finally, a recipe all 3 of my kids love.  If I don't make this for dinner at least once a week, they start to riot!  The only change I made was to add an extra tsp. of seasoned salt per hubby's request.  Goes great with "Mom's Country Gravy" also from this site.

Used huge breasts that were on the bone, didn't cook all the way through, next time I will definitely stick to the boneless skinless.  Otherwise think they would have turned out great

This is excellent. I keep trying to find new chicken recipes because our house is so sick of chicken and this recipe is wonderful. It gives the chicken a nice flavor and isn't the same old same old.

Yummy! Used this recipe for chicken strips. I dipped in flour, then egg, then cracker mix.  Make sure to add extra seasoned salt and pepper.  I also added garlic salt and paprika. Had no problem with this coating sticking to the chicken.  Juicy and delicious.

Everyone seems to like them.  The second time I made them they were a little bit bigger sizes, and it took longer to cook, so the outside was a little too burnt.  And even then everyone liked them.  I suggest turning down the temperature to cook them if you are using larger chicken peices.

We all loved this!  Really had the taste and feel of restaurant/package chicken, but done at home!  We added spices to suit our taste, but other than that we followed the recipe to a T.

We have an annual New Years Eve fondue. Instead of mixing up a traditional wet tempura batter, we used this recipe and method of for both the meat and the veggies in the hot oil. We will never go back to the traditional wet tempura batter. This was incredible! Thanks for sharing!

I intended on following this recipe to a T, but as I was about to cook, my computer was too slow in getting the recipe up, but I remembered the basics, so I put it together anyway. I just put flour in a bowl, without measuring, I added crushed taco shells, because I didn't have saltines, and I added some seasoned salt, pepper, garlic powder, and basil,(I didn't measure any of these, just seasoned to taste). After frying in the oil until browned, I baked in the oven for a while longer to ensure the drumsticks were cooked through. This was a very good recipe, and the family really seemed to like it.

This was great - I didn't change a thing, except use Ritz crackers instead of saltines (didn't have any).

Good recipe, I used ritz crackers instead of saltines and it tasted fine. I also followed the advice of others and dredged it in flour before I dipped it in the egg coating.

Very good! The potato flakes make all the difference. I took the advice of someone else and added some mustard in my egg mixture. Also, I cut my breast into strips so I did need to use 2 eggs instead of 1. I also added a few more spices but mostly kept the recipe as is. 
My 3 year old and husband thought these were awesome! Thanks!

I decided to cook for my boyfriend for the first time ever (he's more of the chef) and went with this recipe. I went with someone's suggestion in adding the hot sauce, red pepper flakes, and more salt seasoning and it turned out fantastic! The first three I fried I dipped only once and it came out good, but the second time around I dipped the chicken twice (egg, mix, egg, mix) and the chicken turned out even better! My boyfriend gave it two thumbs up and said it had to be the best chicken he had in long time! This recipe is worth holding on to!

..This is an updated review since I have used this recipe numerous times since my first review. This remains to be hands down a favorite in our kitchen. The secret, in my opinion, is pounding the chicken! I let my oil get to 350 degrees before frying. I only fry 2 chicken breasts at a time and cook for 5 minutes on each side. This method hasn't failed me and has worked well for me. I hope this helps :)

I multiplied this recipe and fried up about 20 pieces of chicken and my family of 7 still wanted more.....And if everybody in my house agrees on a recipe, it is a miracle to behold......We'll make this one again for sure....

Best recipe ever, perfect breading!  I used reviews advice:
1.  flour pieces of boneless skinless chicken breast
2.  dip in egg/ hot sauce
3.  coat with cracker/potato flake/flour mixture
 Thank you for a wonderful recipe!!

This was delicious, and even my picky kids loved it!!
The only difficulty that I had was in keeping the crumb topping on while I turned them "frequently"..So the only change that I made was to have it cook for a bit longer at a lower temperature..then the topping stayed on a bit better..

I have been trying to find a good fried chicken recipe for a long, long, time.  This one is really excellent. I followed the recipe exactly and absolutely loved the results, crispy on the outside, juicy and flavorful on the inside.  I will  definitely be making this recipe again!  Thanks for sharing!

This was only so-so for me.  Although I'm 99% percent sure that's my fault :-)  Next time I will try either pounding the meat so it's thinner or cutting it up into smaller pieces; I may try baking instead of frying since my coating started to burn before the chicken cooked :-(

Very good recipe and easy to make.  Nice crispy coating on the outside.  My son enjoyed crushing the crackers into crumbs, so of course he thought they were awesome!  I did add a little onion powder to the mixture.  Will make again.

My husband loves fried chicken...just not usually mine!  I tend to dry the chicken out and it does not normally have a good flavor.  This recipe has changed his mind about my fried chicken! Wonderful!!  (I did add a bit more pepper because we like it.)

I used crushed cornflakes because I did not have any crackers on hand.  I used more seasoning than called for and I was just disappointed with the taste.  Maybe I'm just not a fried chicken person.

This was my first time frying chicken and it worked out pretty well. My family liked it but said it needed something...a kick. I needed to use 3 eggs, one was not enough. I think next time I'll try baking as I found the frying lengthy and tedious, also could not tell what the temp was at.

I figured this would be a little bland so I added some Seasoned salt. Other than that this was very good. I will be using this again. The hubby & kids loved it.

I made these last night for dinner and they were a huge hit!  I didn't have saltines so I just used buttered round crackers I had on hand.  I also cut the recipe in half to serve just two people and it was enough food, but there were no leftovers using the thinly sliced chicken breasts.  Next time I'll make extra because they'd make great leftovers for lunch.  I bought a box of potato flakes, used the called for amount for the recipe and used the rest of the opened package to make a side of mashed potatoes and also heated up some canned corn for a side.  It was a delicious, balanced meal!

I think this could have been cooked longer. I didn't pound my chicken before cooking it, so that could have been part of the problem. Mine was a little dry and not falling apart at all.  I did add a little extra seasoning, but it probably could have used even more.

Just like dinner at a restaurant. Crispy and delicious. I fried ine in a deep fryer for 6 mins at 325, it came out perfect. I substituted Ritz for the saltines and it was still great. Another thing I loved about this recipe is that you dont have a ton of dishes to wash when your done. It was very simple and fast.

Excellent fried chicken recipe, i didnt give it 5 stars only because they didnt fry up crunchy like i had hoped, the flavor was delicious though, very creative and easy. I used the left over oil to make a chicken gravy to put on top, it was sooo good!

Chicken was moist and delicious. I had to be careful not to overcook the thin chicken breasts because they fried up very quickly.  We will be having this again soon.

This recipe was simply amazing.  I like flavourful food and so I seasoned the chicken with spices that I like for 7 hours in the fridge.  I added 3 tablespoons of potatoe flakes and one tablespoon of flour.  I wanted a slightly different flavour.  I try and shy away from fried food so I followed the recommendation that another review wrote and baked it at 400 degree in baking tray for one hour so that I would get a crispy coat and it was great.  We had 10 pieces of chicken and the four of us devoured it.  The kids kept wanting more.  Goodbye KFC!!

I thought this was some of the best fried chicken I have ever made. The outside was crispy and the inside was juicy. I did double up on some of the spices and it really came out great. I also made a milk gravy to go with it and it was really delicious.

I've never fried chicken before, because i'm not a huge fan of fried chicken. This was AMAZING!! The reviews don't lie. It was so easy. The crunch from the saltines and potato flakes can't be matched. I followed the recipe, but i added seasoning salt and 1/2 envelope of powdered ranch seasoning, as some suggested. It was without a doubt the best fried chicken i have ever had, and the way i will make it forever. I'm craving more right now...

Great chicken recipe!  Enjoyed the change from ordinary.  Added some seasoning for a little more flavor, but would have been fine 'as is'. Loved the cracker mix.

Awesome, AND more important, EASY.  Used thick chicken breasts (about 7 oz each) and cooked 5 on 1 side, 5 on the other, then flipped for 5 more and was perfect.  Also used 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp black pepper rather than salt blend.  Fried in olive oil - delicious!  Thanks for sharing - will make again soon!

Very good basic recipe. I pounded the chicken first so that it would cook faster, and kept warm in the oven. Made some homemade white gravy and served with mashed potatoes. True comfort food.

This recipe is Fantastic. I had to make it again the next night. I didn't know what type of seasoned salt to use so I used Mrs. Dash.  The chicken was moist and the crust was nice and crunchy. Super easy recipe for a quick meal.
Just add some gravy and you are set.

Wonderful recipe. Next time I'll add a little more seasoned salt (may have been my error).. but they were delicious. I couldn't believe how beautifully brown they looked when done. My boyfriend absolutely loved this. Thank you sooo much for sharing this recipe.

This is absolutely one of my favorite recipes from this site.  The chicken was flavorful (seasoned chicken the night before and kept it in the refrigerator).  It takes good with rice and last night I served it with Spagetti and a ceasar salad.  YUM!

I used the ingredient modifications suggested by Tmom. Cooking was made simple by using my deep fryer. I let it cook until the chicken was a dark brown color and it came out moist and delicious!

Absolutely the BEST fried chicken I have ever tasted! I used butter and herb potato flakes instead of original ones. I also added some butter and hot sauce to my egg mixture. It was fantastic I will never make another kind of fried chicken! Thanks!

Followed the recipe as written except I used Roasted Vegetable Ritz crackers instead of Saltines. Although it is a very easy recipe and I found the breading to stay put better than the average breaded chicken recipe I thought this was just so-so.

This was wonderful! It was so easy to make. The only change I made was that I used club crackers instead of regular saltine crackers.  My husband and I both loved it!

AWESOME!!!  I've made this three times already and each time it has come out great!  Nice and crunchy and flavorful on the outside and moist and juicy inside.  Even my 8 year old picky son likes this dish. Thanks

Best fried chicken I ever made. I cut the half breast in half and pounded them a little thinner. Very good.

Perfect and very, very easy. I added flour and milk to the drippings to make gravy and it turned out great. Try this with different flavors of crackers!

The chicken stayed very moist, but other than that, this recipe was pretty unremarkable.  It was okay--kind of bland (even with some extra seasonings thrown on).  To it's credit, the breading actually stuck to the chicken, although I coated the chicken in flour before the egg and also cooked the chicken on each side for 5 minutes at a time.  

Probably wouldn't make it again, but it's a good starting point to tweak from.

This chicken was great! I didn't have any saltine crackers so I used garlic and herb Townhouse crackers instead.It turned out super. The whole family enjoyed it.

I made this last night and it was soooo delicious! I followed some others' advice- I added garlic and onion powder and used Lowry's seasoned salt. I dredged it through egg twice (before and after the cracker mix). It cooked up quick and easy and was very juicy! Made the instant potatoes to go with it, added a salad and it was a quick easy yummy dinner. Will have a biscuit/cornbread next time!

This was very good & juicy. The only thing I added was garlic (our family likes garlic) & I used an entire sleeve of crackers. Will add this to the rotation :) thanks for the recipe.

Very good. It is important to note I made the following changes though - I added garlic salt, onion powder, & fried chicken seasoning to cracker/flour mix. I mixed 1/c cup of milk w/ the egg mixture. I dipped the chicken in the milk egg mixture, then in the dry flour mixture, then in another bowl of just plain beaten eggs and then fried them. The chicken was moist and delicious. Definitely a winner in our household.

This came out delicious! I followed the directions but added a few Club Crackers that I had which gave the chicken a nice buttery taste.  This was so quick and yummy. I served with mashed potatoes and a salad.

This is a great recipe! I used 2 chicken breasts, sliced them in half to make 4 thin pieces and then cut them in to smaller strips. I double breaded them, using 2 eggs and the whole breading recipe. They turned out perfect and super crispy. I will be making this again!

I used drumsticks and found that the breding didn't quite stick so well.  I found this recipe to be a pleasant change for our traditional bread crumbs and I will use boneless/skinless breasts next time.  Very tasty and a definite addition to my recipe book!

Very yummy - full of flavor. I used thin chicken cutlets and it turned out great. Also used egg beaters in place of the egg, and took the suggestion of another reviewer of browning it in minimal oil, and then baking on a broiler pan (aluminum foil underneath to make clean up easy)til done.

The family all agrees... this one is a keeper.  We added just a little extra season salt and a little garlic powder. I also pounded the chicken a little.  Other than that, we stuck to the recipe.  My 4 year old daughter really enjoyed smashing crackers and shaking the chicken in the bag.  We served with mashed pots and pepper gravy.  Yummy!

I made this last night for the family and they loved it. My six year old daughter ate more than any of us. I used Ritz crackers and chicken tenders. So light! YUM.

This was an easy and wonderful chicken fried chicken recipe! The only thing I changed was adding 1 tbsp more potato flakes and 1/2 tbsp garlic powder to the cracker mix. This cooked up nice and brown and was very juicy! Thanks so much!

YUMMY!! This recipe is very good.  Is is probably the best coating that I have ever tried.  It browns very nicely and tastes really good.  I didn't change a thing.

Delicious and EASY!!! I have made this recipe exactly as-is and I have also made my own alterations - no matter what, it always tastes great. I think it's impossible to mess this one up. We serve it with a white gravy and garlic mashed potatoes with a green vegetable, and the whole family gobbles it down.

I think this is a good, easy recipe and tastes different than your typical fried chicken. I added more seasoned salt than called for because I like extra flavor. Be careful not to have your heat up too high or you'll burn the outside before the inside gets cooked. Family said it was good but didn't rave about it. I'd still cook it again.

I just didn't care for this method of preparing chicken.  Quite bland although the chicken was nice and moist.  No one in my family cared for it very much.

This was good.  Nothing amazing about it but I will probably make it again as it was very easy to make and it went over well.  Served it with some home made country gravy left over from last night.  Didn't cisp up as much as I would have liked and the seasoning salt taste seemed to over power, maybe a different spice or 2...?  But still, overall a good recipe.

I made this for Easter.  Everyone loved it.  I got the ultimate compliment from my daughter.  She said it was better that Mamaw's. The only thing I changed was that I used Club crackers.  I will use this many more times. Thanks.

Great fried chicken recipe. I too use a deep fryer, and I make one other change. The egg is only for making the coating stick, right? Well, I substitute something that has a little more taste to it. I like the Spicy ranch dressing, coating the chicken and letting it rest in the fridge for a couple of hours.

This dish came out very well, but I had to do a little of my own thing and added a little of my own ingredients such as Freshly chopped Italian parsley and freshly grated Parmesean cheese to the coating for some added flavor. Served it with Steamed rice and Sauted Asparagus with Hollandaise sauce. The family really enjoyed it..Thank you.

Really liked this one!  I used a fondue pot with a shallow fill of oil-  and used Tony's Creole seasoning - it turned out wonderful.  My husband loved it- I'll be making this one again!

This was very easy to make! My DH liked it, but said it was ok and maybe next time if I make it again I need to thin out the chicken!  He didn't realize it was chicken fried chicken.. he thought it was just a different type of breaded chicken.  Probably my fault!

This is really close to my own recipe!  The only thing different that I do is use chicken breasts and pound them so they fry faster.  I also don't add flour, and I dump in one pkg of Shake and Bake to the crumb mixture for flavor.  For kicks, I tried your recipe, and I have to say, I like yours better :) Ssshh, we won't tell my family!  I made it tonight and they all commented on how good it was.

I added more spices & did not have any potato  flakes. I added paprika, garlic & garlic salt, & montreal chicken seasoning. I also used chicken breast tenders instead of whole breasts. My family loved this, it disappeared and was asked to be put into the regular rotation. Tks for the recipe!

Used drumsticks instead of breasts and used McCormicks Grill Mates Salt Free Chicken Seasoning instead of seasoned salt. It was a HIT, not a single piece left over.

It was very yummy. I would agree, make sure you have a lot of spices to jazz it up. I followed some of the suggestions, but next time I would add more.  I think I went a little light being the first time. My boyfriend really liked it.  Fried the chicken and it was definately better the day I did it. Left overs not that great like eatting left over fried food.  Will try backing next time.

I rated this recipe 5 for taste.  However, I had to work out a few things before making it the second time.  I increased the crackers, flour, and potato flakes.  I add paprika and pepper, and I increased the season salt.  It was even better after my alterations!

This turned out very well. Instead of cracker crumbs, I used a mixture of Japanese panko and bread crumbs along with the instant potatoes and flour. Added additional seasonings like poultry seasoning, garlic and onion powders. Used this on drumsticks.

I had high hopes for this recipe, and I wasn't disappointed.  I added a little more potato flakes and seasoning though.  It came out crispy and flavorful.  It went great with alfredo noodles and yeast dinner rolls.

Wow, what a great and easy recipe for a busy weekday! The chicken stayed moist (which is sometimes hard for white meat) and the coating was so simple to throw together. My BF and I really enjoyed this one served with some mashed potatoes. It really does help to give it a little sprinkle of salt after you get them out of the skillet too. I will defintely make it again!

...I used 3 chicken breast cut into strips and made only half of the cracker crumbs.  I didn't have potato flakes so used dry potato soup mix and made some honey-mustard dipping sauce to go with...I liked the fact that the  chicken doesn't get lost in the breading...yummy lunch...thx Cassie.

My husband prefers legs and thighs, so I battered and browned them first and then put them in the oven at 375 for half and hour. For myself and my grandson, I then battered and browned the breasts after the half hour, added them to the oven and baked for an additional half hour at 350. We all loved it!

AHK. My family and I loved this!! We all agreed it was better then, say, KFC or any other chicken fast food restaurants. Of course, me being me, I HAD to make a few changes.

I replaced the potato flakes with grated parmesan cheese, added one more egg (I used four medium-sized chicken breasts), and used cajun seasoning and garlic powder. Also, I cut the breasts into smaller pieces, and thereafter pounded it with my meat mallet. A great stress reliever ^__^

I "deep-fried" it for approximately three to four minutes, two minutes per side, then proceeded to bake it in a 350 degrees F oven for another four or five odd minutes. Fifteen minutes is far too long. However, DO NOT REDUCE the heat to medium! Just stick with seven or eight.

All in all, I definitely recommend this.

This was very good and easy to make with kids.  Needs a little more seasoning though.  I added seasoning directly to the chicken before adding the coating.

Loved the texture of the crust. It came out quite crispy. However, I did find the taste a little bland. I would make this recipe again, but would add MUCH more in the way of spices.

My Sister, Lynda, found this recipe and emailed it on to me after she tried it.  We both love it the way it is, but you can just add different spices for different tastes.  Very good and easy!

I thought this recipe was excellent. I have to agree with some people that it could have used more "spice". I added just alittle cayenne pepper, onion powder, garlic powder. Overall very good.

This was good, but I didn't find it to be moist on the inside like others have said.  I will say that I did have to put it aside for awhile to go carroling and maybe that is why they dried out.  I will probably try again and eat right away next time, i used extra potatoe flakes and extra season salt as well and the coating was great.  Maybe I'll use the George Foreman next time to save on the fat of frying. Not hard to prepare though so all and all I give it 4 stars.  Thanks

I have never made fried chicken before so I thought I'd give this recipe a try since the reviews were so good.  It was SO easy to make, it took no time at all to get the chicken prepared.  If you are looking for a very tasty and easy meal this is it!!

Wonderful recipe!  Eveyone LOVED it!  I did not have seasoned salt, so I added Adobo seasoning and it turned out great!  And the coating really does stayed on the chicken while cooking!  Will use this recipe again and again!  Thank you!

This recipe deserves much more than just 5 stars!  I have made it a few times now, and every time I do, my family goes absolutely crazy for it.  I acutally have to re-print the recipe so I can make it for dinner.  My husband requested it for his birthday dinner instead of going out!  Thanks Cassie!!!

I'm always experimenting with frying chicken.  When I came across this, it took me off guard.  So, I cooked it, and my family just LOVED IT!!  My daughter had 3 servings, and my sons had 4.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  It's fabulous.

This recipe was delicious. I cut the chicken breast thin and then coated it with the egg and coating mixture. The chicken was very tender and the batter was crispy. It was the best chicken I have ever eaten. Will definately make this again.

Wow this was better than I expected.  I cut the chicken up into smaller pieces for dipping.  I served this with two dipping sauces.  One was sliced peperoncini mixed with mayo (low fat, let sit about 2 hours in the frig for the flavors to blend)-- the other was my post of Rachel's wasbi cocktail sauce (we use 1 tbs of wasb). Chicken nuggets with a twist.  A keeper-Thanks

Very good recipe!  The whole family loved it.  We topped the chicken with creamy gravy and it was delicous.

It was good.  It had a crispy outer but the flavor was just average fried chicken.  I would put more flavor in if i do it again.

Well this time I remembered to add the egg and it came out even better. I used chicken wings instead. My b/f couldn't stop eating them. They were really good and delicious!

This chicken was very crunchy and moist, but I did find it a little bland. I will add more spices next time.

Chicken tasted very good. I didn't add the potato flakes and used crushed up cornflakes instead plus used a lot more pepper-personal preference. They were nice and crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside.

Absolutely fantastic crunchy delicious crust, but it's really hard to tell when the chicken is done because the crust browns so fast. But great great recipe. Thank you!

I had low sodium crackers that I used which probably makes all the difference in the world because I found it to be bland. I added salt which seemed to make it better. Still just okay recipe.

I liked this recipe, but changed a few things.  I added more seasoned salt and pepper than what the recipe called for and I doubled the amount of oil used for frying.  My husband and I both found the chicken to be lacking in flavour - it really needed something.  I think I will make this again, but will serve it with peppercorn gravy or something.

Made this chicken for my boyfriend, it tasted excellent! and was so easy to cook and clean up. I used a big ziploc bag put the chicken in with the crumbs and let it sit in the fridge for 1/2 hour. I sauteed onions as I cooked the chicken on the stove too. I added onion soup base, and some extra spices. Came out excellent!! =)

So easy!  Delicious,crisp,light coating.  I made the honey mustard listed below and it was fabulous!  I cut the honey mustard recipe in half in case we didn't like it, but everyone loved it!  I will definitely make this again.

I followed others' advice and used more seasonings - onion powder, garlic salt and paprika. I didn't have any potato flakes, but I don't think it made a difference. It tasted ok, but it was a little greasy. I also found it rather messy to cook as bits of the breading kept popping out of the skillet. I think I'll stick with the 'Famous Butter Chicken' recipe from this site - crunchier breading, and easier and less messy to make.

This was a really good recipe, although I had to seasoned the flour with oregano, paprika, and a little bit of cayenne pepper.  And I also seasoned the chicken with chicken seasoning. Besides that the recipe is really good.

LOVED it!!  Used more crackers than the recipe calls for because I like them breaded heavy.  Will certainly replace my normal bread crumbs!

Possibly the best fried chicken i've ever had! I cubed the chicken instead, took a little longer to cook all the cubes but defineltly worth it! Every bite was covered with the cracker mix. I will definetly use this recipe again. Maybe in strips next time.

I gave this a 5-star because must say I was thoroughly impressed with this recipe. Growing up in NYC, I have had A LOT of fried chicken. I tried it with both strips and breasts and each time the result was fabulous. I DID add some ADOBO and paprika, but otherwise I stuck to the recipe. Thanks for a great recipe Cassie!

This chicken rocks!  My family rated it up there w/KFC, and went on and on about it.  I followed the recipe exactly and added the garlic powder someone else recommended.  I slow-cooked it a little lower than medium with the lid on the frypan and it was melt-in-your mouth tender & juicy.  Thanks for the great recipe Cassie!

I made this recipe last night and it was a hit.  I actually crushed the crackers in the blender because when they were larger they didn't seem to stick.  I also cooked legs and thighs.  I don't know why but I like my fried chicken with a bone.  It is a good recipe didn't change anything.  My first time making fried chicken and it turned out great. thanks.  Oh yes I didn't turn the chicken frequently.  I browned one side and then flipped it and cooked the other.

this was good.
i coated the chicken with flour before coating it with egg as well (someone mentioned it on here too) and i did add some garlic and onion powder to the coating and a little more pepper as well.  the crackers give it a really good crunch/taste that wouldn't be the same with just fine bread crumbs (i've done that before).

We really liked this.  I did roll the chicken in plain flour before dipping in the egg, also added a little garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne to the cracker mixture.

This was an easy one to make. Exilent for begginers and for the Pros. I didnt use the proper kind of crackers and it was still awsome! But I felt that the crackers "NEED" to be smooshed up alot so that they dont fall of the chicken as much.

Excellent! This was my first try at making fried chicken, and everyone loved it. I cut up the chicken into smaller strips which made it cook faster. I find it works best if you really crush up the crackers.

This was good, but not the best I have ever had.  The chicken was very moist and the outside was crispy with good flavor.  I did not add salt and pepper.  I used Season All and garlic powder and fat free saltines.

Awesome! I upped the spices by 1/2 and it was phenomenal. I ran out of eggs and used 3 Tbl. Unflavored gelatin, 3 Tbl. cold water and 3/4 C. hot water and some butter flavor. It did the trick. This is better than most restaurants!

Very good recipe and very simple. My only suggestion would be to add more seasonings b/c the taste might be on the bland side for some. Other than that it is very tasty. Definitely a recipe keeper!

OHHHHHH MAN! This was so goooood. I was loving this! My whole family ate all of it and I made 14 pieces!!! It made it through Sunday night and 1/2 of Monday before it was all gone! My husband loves fried chicken and this was my first try and it turned out great! The only thing I did different was I put 1 teaspoon garlic salt and 1/2 or so of regular salt. Was not bland at all!

Delicious!  Wow!  This was a very tasty and easy recipe to prepare.  The chicken came out very moist and the craker mix on the outside gave it the perfect touch.  I will definetly have to make this again. :)

YUM!!  AWESOME!!  Messy, but easy - even foolproof.  The results are scrumptious.  Crispy outside, tender and juicy inside.  I made chicken tenders and my kids, who are not great eaters, loved them!  Had to use panko crumbs instead of potato flakes because that's all I had on hand.  I love chicken tenders and this is the best recipe I've tried.  Will not be needing to experiment with any other recipes - this is the ONE!  Thanks, Cassie!

Turned out great!!!  I made chicken tender sizes and deep fat fried mine and the coating was just right...not overly bready or falling off.  Will definitely do again for friends and family.

Very good! I added a little more pepper than this recipe called for and also just some table salt. I also had to add a lot more oil than the recipe called for, but I had very large chicken breasts so that may have been why. Anyhow, overall, the flavor was wonderful! My husband and 2 year old son loved it!

This is really good! I added a few spices and the whole family liked it. I'm not a fan of chicken but my husband is. Anytime I can find a recipe that I enjoy...It's a plus for him.
My son made a sandwich out of it and said it was great. Thanks!

I made this recipe along with Restaurant-Style Buffalo Wings (Yum) But this one didn't turn out as good as I thought it would. The crusty coating didn't stick well and it was kind of bland. It was hardly touched at dinner. However for lunch the next day, the chicken ended up in slices & over a nice salad w/ranch dressing.  We all liked it better that way. :)

I had a little rough time flipping the chicken. The skin kept coming off. But overall this chicken was delicious! I put mine in the fridge so it would be cold. My husband heated his up again though. It was yummy! I dipped mine in creamy salad dressing!

I have made this three or four times so far.  Very easy to make and fry.  I follow the recipe closely, but sometimes I add a dash of garlic salt or cayenne pepper.  I serve this with mashed potatoes and country gravy.  My husband enjoys this and requests it often.

I was pleasantly shocked by how good this simple recipe was!  It almost makes chicken breasts taste like giant chicken McNuggets, sans the chicken meal texture of course.

This is a great fried chicken recipe. I used extra seasoning but next time I will use less salt. Only thing I would do different in preparation is to use a large size plastic zip loc bag. Great taste and very moist chicken. I would definitely make this again.

This is so good, it's just like the Chicken Fried Chicken you get in restraunts. I did use more oil than the recipe.

I took the advise of others and added onion powder for flavor and used a little more oil.  I really enjoyed this!  I will make this again soon.
