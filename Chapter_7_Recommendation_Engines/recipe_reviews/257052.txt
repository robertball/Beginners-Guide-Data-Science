This was fabulous! I was not able to find large cans of pineapple tidbits so I used 14 oz. cans of pineapple chunks and rough-blended them to get "tidbits".  This glaze made my cheaper store-brand ham the most moist and delicious ham I have ever made. Will use this glaze forever. Thank you!

Easy to make, with just the right sweetness. I baked a pre-sliced ham using this as the glaze, and it was delicious.
