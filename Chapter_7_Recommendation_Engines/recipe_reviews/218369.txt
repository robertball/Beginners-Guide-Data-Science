FYI, this recipe will taste great without the sun-dried tomatoes and capers. And you can omit or decrease the amount of cayenne pepper. The key is seasoning with the herbs, garlic and lemon. Hope you enjoy!

Yummy yummy! As iloveolilveoil advises this recipe is super good even without the capers and sun dried tomatoes if you don't have them on hand. I'm easily turned off by the fishy flavour of plain sardines from a can but I've really been trying to find a way to make myself like them. The lemon, garlic and spices balance the strong flavour out very well... it's hard to believe I'm eating sardines! I used canned sardines with jalapeno peppers so to compensate for the spiciness I omitted the red pepper flakes. I think I could eat this everyday its just so easy, healthy and refreshing!

Great taste and an easy recipe.  I would serve this at a party and bet people wouldn't know they were eating sardines.  I just added all ingredients together and ate the paste on wasa flat bread

I love this recipe.  I am a salty, briny seafood person - but even if you aren't, this recipe is so flavorful the fish is not at all overpowering.  I like to add half a dozen chopped kalamata olives, serve on a bed of baby spinach or arugala, and drizzle with a tiny bit of olive oil.  I eat this often year-round, but it's my favorite quick dinner to make in the summer when it's too hot to turn on my oven or use my stovetop!  YUM!

My father-in-law gave us a Costco mega-pack of sardines, and I've always been a little iffy on them (my husband loves them straight out of the can). This turned out delicious! I mixed the sardines, lemon juice and spices with a fork; stirred in the capers, tomatoes and a little more lemon juice and a couple of chopped kalamata olives. We just scooped it onto crackers for a quick lunch. I'll definitely be making this again!

This was good. But lets face it.. it's canned sardines! So it wasn't mouth watering mm mm good. Still, a quick healthful and budget friendly recipe. I used wild caught organic sardines so for some reason I think they're fishier than regular. I did not add capers, sun dried, or red pepper flakes though next time (there will be a next time) I'll try it. I mixed this into fresh made quinoa which was awesome cause I never know what to put in quinoa. Added fresh diced tomatoes, parm. cheese, and a side of sauteed asparagus. Worked out great. Thank you for sharing this!

This is going in my easy, healthy dinners for seniors who live alone file.
I love to cook but for just me, not so much.  I hear my friends say
they don' eat very well home alone - no incentive to dirty pots and pans
etc.  Used Sardines canned in water.  Added everything except the pepper
flakes, added some diced red onion, and topped it off with a splash of
my favorite olive oil. Ate it with Triscuits.   Such a tasty, simple way to get my
Omega 3's.  Will also serve as an appetizer.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made an allrecipes account just so I can give this 5 stars. Canned sardines never tasted so good! If it's cold out I suggest putting the tin can directly under the broiler for 5 minutes along with the chopped garlic then assembling on your plate as directed. Warmed me right up. Thanks for the recipe. I will be making this again for sure.

I love this! Just had it for lunch as a sandwich and it was delicious! I left out the capers as I didn't have any and it is some of the most delicious sardines from a can I have ever had!

OMG!!! I've never had sardines and my friends thought I was crazy!!!!  This is a tasty, colorful, and light possibility for lunch, as an appetizer, or as a guilt-free late dinner.  Even if you have never had sardines before, you should give this a try.  Delicious!

I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but this is delicious and the flavors work very well together! I loved the brininess of it. My sardines were boneless and skinless, and that worked perfectly here (1300 mg omega 3's per the can....wow!). I went very easy with the cayenne, and it worked fine (and I like spicy, too). This takes a can of sometimes boring sardines to a completely different level. It seems Sicilian or something that would be good as part of the Mediterranean diet. Thanks for this unusual and very good recipe!

I'm the only person in my house who wants to eat fish.  Decided to give this recipe a try for lunch.  Since I try to do lower sodium, I decided to skip the capers, and I did not add any salt.  The store I visited this morning didn't have sun dried tomatoes, so those were omitted, too.  Just gave a sprinkle of everything else to taste.  Served with Roland Garden Vegetable quinoa.  ~~~  I enjoyed this!  I hadn't ever had sardines.  A few of bites were a little fishier than I would have liked, so next time I will be sure to break up the pieces of fish more before adding the lemon juice and seasonings.  ~~~Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Delicious! I doubled this & made per recipe except for leaving out the thyme (don't have it & hate dried!) I ate 1/2 of it on Kashi heart healthy crackers, so this was a totally nutritious meal as well as tasty & filling. The Oscar's brisling sardines are excellent - not fishy & very tiny fish, so you don't have to deal with bones & scales. I loved getting the chewy pieces of tomato & crunch of capers and I will be making this at least weekly. Thanks for such a simple healthy recipe, iloveoliveoil!

This is a great fast way to get more sardines into your diet (they are packed with goodness and cost so much less than the salmon everyone seems bent on getting us to eat). I made this and served over mixed green with a dressing made from the olive oil the sardines were packed in and lemon juice. I also added a few pitted and coarsely chopped kalamata olives I had on hand. It was delicious! But of course, I bet it would be a five star amazing recipe with fresh Sardines.

This is a quick and easy low carb snack or meal. It's so simple and convenient. The seasonings and lemon complement the sardines very nicely, although I would probably go light on the thyme next time. A little definitely goes a long way with thyme! I added a whole lemon (and wouldn't hesitate to add more) and more crushed red pepper and cayenne because I like a little more spice. I also added paprika and omitted the capers and salt, instead adding about 1/4 cup of pesto.

Simple, but tastes “fancy”. I used jarred sun-dried tomatoes packed in olive oil and salt-packed capers, which I rinsed and dried. Served over a simple salad if mild iceberg with a splash of olive oil and balsamic

Love this! I make it as listed but I do zap it in the microwave for 30 seconds because I  like it a little warm. I use it as a quick bite when I'm cooking for one. It goes great with gluten free crackers and a glass of wine.

Made the recipe as written and it was delicious.  I enjoy sardines anyway, but I loved how the ingredients brightened up the flavor and took away much of the fishiness. I think this is something I could actually eat in the office without coworkers complaining. :) I spooned it onto crackers for an easy yummy lunch.

This is my new favorite way to eat sardines!
I love the difference flavor combination and the heat!
It's great on toasted sourdough bread with a fried egg!
I am now a sardines junkie!

This was surprisingly *really* good. I've been trying to eat more oily fish but they're not always my favorite, so I started out a little unsure ... but I actually ended up eating the whole thing at one sitting. Be aware that the lemon+caper flavors are very prominent in this (which I like). I ate it alongside hummus & baba ganouj, piled onto crackers. The zingy lemon was a nice counterpoint to the earthier dips, and I feel incredibly proud of how nutritious (and easy) my supper was.

I followed the recipe as written, and I really liked the results. I have been trying to eat more sardines because I know they're good for me, but they can be very intimidating at first. I felt like this recipe did a good job of hiding the fishiness with a lot of other really nice bold flavors. I do think mine would benefit from maybe a little more oil or lemon juice. Mine was a touch dry. On the whole though, I really enjoyed it, and I would totally make it again.

Loved it. So easy. Put on a bed of baby spinach for a salad. Used sardines packed in water rather than oil.

I quickly made this as written with no changes when I was home for lunch. Wow! This is full of flavor. The sweetness of the sundried tomatoes balances out the fish and lemon. I'll be making this again soon. Too bad my wife doesn't like sardines.  More for me ;-)

OMG, never thought sardines were that tasty until now.  Didn't have capers or thyme and still tasted great.  Used sardines in tomato sauce as that's all I had on hand.  Someone else's recommendation to serve with quinoa was a great idea.

Delicious, and very quick and easy to prepare.  Great as an appetizer or  as a light main course, possibly with a salad and crunchy bread or whole grain crackers.

Great way to eat healthy sardines when you aren't fond of them. Lining up the sardines on a bed of greens makes a nice presentation and this quick easy lunch has almost no dirty dishes.  Great for those living alone.  Husband even liked it.  Definitely a keeper of a recipe and I will make it frequently.

I had no idea I liked sardines! This was so great - super easy and yummy. I didn't have the sun dried tomatoes so I just left them out and it was still great.

I love this recipe!  It is a quick and satisfying lunch. I travels well to work. As I am avoiding grains, I put it on a bed of garbanzo beans. Delicious.  Thanks for this recipe.

This was very tasty. I didn't have capers or sun dried tomatoes. I ate it with fresh grape tomatoes and club crackers

The herbs are great. So well balanced and fresh. I did exactly as the recipe called and added one small piece of artisanal bread to help savor the dish. Will absolutely make again

I combined all of the ingredients in a glass bowl, smashed the sardines slightly, and smeared it on toast. Delish!

I made no changes except to add lime instead of lemon and no crushed pepper cause I'm a baby when it comes to spicy stuff. The cayenne was perfect for me. It really was amazing, I love sardines but having them dressed up like this was just mindblowingly great. And I didn't even have to cook!! Just eat this, I don't know if you'll be okay going back to normal sardines after this

This packs TONS of flavor and is Very acidic and salty. I added some fresh chopped tomatoes for freshness and a pinch of sugar to cut the acid. I also let it sit to meld the flavors together. The flavor packs quite a punch. I think this was just an overload of flavor in my mouth. I think it would be good if the flavor could be spread out somehow, but I have no ideas. This recipe was good to try but I will not make it again.
