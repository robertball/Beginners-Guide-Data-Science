Like alot of the other reviewers I rolled into balls instead of crescents. I used 1 teas almond extract instead of vanilla. Baked for about 20 min to make sure they were firm enough to hold together when rolling. I rolled in powdered sugar while still warm and then again when cooled so they look prettier. These are alot like wedding cookies. Very easy and oh so goooooood! Thanks Beth!

Was having problems with the dough falling apart, After reading the reviews I found I was not the only one. I decided to add 1/3 cup of sugar and also 1 tsp of Almond flavering as well as 1 tsp vanilla. Also baked for 20 mins. They turned out incredible..

The dough was very sticky and difficult to work with even after being in the refridgerator for a long time and the addition of more flower.  "Extemely fragile" is an understatment. Most of them crumbled when they were touched after they were completely cool.  The backed cookies were sour tasting - the powdered sugar dusting made them tolerable.

Very yummy, I let them cool completly also before rolling them in the sugar mixture.  I added almond extract as well as vanilla.  Next time I will add a little bit of sweetener to the cookies, even thought they taste great, they could use a little sugar.  Loved the recipe, thanks

I tried the recipe as it is written, and the person who wrote it forgot to mention in the first line to mix the sugar with everything else.  I only used the sugar on top when they were done.  I couldn't figure out why they didn't taste the same as my mother inlaws until I went back to the recipe.  So 2 batches tasted like flour and salt.

This recipes is one I will never make again...not only was it very difficult to form the cookies but once the cookie had baked it tasted like sawdust...If you particularly like that taste then this recipe is for you! If not don't waste your time!!!!!!

I have been baking this recipe since 2002, very delicate flavoured cookies. My family and friends love these every year and are a big favorite. I have also tried substituting Coco powder for the Cinnamon for a light chocolate flavour, very nice.    However, if you like something super sweet like Sugar Cookies or Choc Chip, the flavour might be too light for you.

Cookies went flat. They tasted good but looked like roadkill. Any reason why they would flatten out please fill me in!!

I tried this recipe today, had the same problem as some of the other home bakers. Roll dough cigar thick and about 2 inch length, form into crescents and you will have a much studier cookie.

I have no idea what went wrong I followed the recipe exactly & when I put them in the oven they just turned to flat pancakes, I read all the reviews and would like to know why this happened

Excellent recipe! I was a little nervous with the first batch when most of the cookies crumbled. For the next batches of cookies, I waited for them to completely cool, then I dipped them in sugar. This worked just fine! They taste great.

These cookies are easy to make, although, I did make them into balls, because of them being so fragile. I was slightly disappointed, I thought they should taste more "almondy", when I make them next time, I will also use almond flavoring in the batter. Over all, very light, and very flaky! They will be served as one of the goodies after Christmas Day dinner.

These cookies taste great. The cinnamon is a nice touch. However, they are very fragile. I found it much easier to form the dough into balls, rather than crescents. Not as traditional, but much, much easier to handle and roll in powdered sugar. Plus my guests found it easier to eat them in ball shapes, rather than the crescent--which often broke in two while guests were eating. Overall, a very good recipe.

Good recipe, but I got a little confused with the "pencil thick" instruction.  
A pencil isn't that thick, but you want the cookie thicker so it doesn't crumble.
Also, I found it easier to form the cookie on a flat surface rather than rolling it 
in your hand.  All in all, the end result was good.  The cookie tastes good and I 
enjoy the added touch of cinnamon!

A really delicious cookie! I got raves about them. I would have rated them 5* they are extremely fragile and very frustrating at times.

I found this  a very easy recipe, but they fell apart even with careful handling, which was frustrating to say the least. The way they turned out was really embarrassing since I am quite good at baking. The taste was ok, but not great.

I followed other reviewers suggestions and added a smidgeon of almond extract.  It was still flavorless and boring.   It got tossed in the bucket.
