This is my recipe that I learned years ago while catering. In the years that I have made it I have learned a few things, but I cant figure out how to modify the recipe on here.

1. I always mix the onion, broccoli, and raisins  with the dressing the day before I serve it. This allows the acid in the vinegar to "cook" the veggies to reduce the raw flavors and the raisins will soak up a little of the flavor of the dressing. I try to stir the salad a couple times throughout the sitting time to redistribute the dressing and make sure everything is well coated.

2. Right before serving mix in the bacon and cashews and stir well. This will keep the bacon and cashews crunchy and salty. 

3. There are may choices out there for salty/crunch instead of cashews, you can sub with peanuts, sunflower seeds, etc. 

4. I prefer raisins because they re-hydrate a little while they sit in the dressing, but you can choose any other sweet dried bits to add, such as cranberries. To me they add a different element, because they arent sweet, and they dont plump up like the raisins. 

I recommend trying different combos of add-ins, You could even add some diced cheddar cheese or shredded Parmesan. I've added shredded carrots (when my shopper bought a bag of pre-shredded broccoli/carrot mix thinking he was saving me time)

Delicious! I was nervous about adding the raisins, but I'm glad I did b/c it gave a nice texture to the salad, and a little extra 'pop' of sweetness. Hubby really enjoyed this too, but the little guy...not so much. I will be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Good base recipe.  To make it more like the kind you get at the deli, I used large golden raisins instead of regular, added sunflower seeds, a tsp of honey to the sauce, and used a red cabbage and shredded carrot mix, mainly to spread it out and make it go further. Delicious.

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. I added some dried cranberries to make it more festive looking. I will make this again.

I've made this twice now - everyone loves it. The flavours go very well together. I made it ahead of time and just mixed it all together when we needed it. It was even better the next day!

I made this just as directed to go with turkey dinner. It was fabulous! Cold and crisp, a great counterpoint to all the rich Thanksgiving sides.

One of my favorite salads. I didn't have red onion or sunflower seeds but subbed in almond and white onion with no problems. Such a surprising combination of favors.
