This is the second time I've made this, and it's been just consistently great. I did add fresh chopped garlic to the cheese/spinach mixture, as well as salt & pepper. I add fresh browned ground beef to the sauce to pour over the shells. I do think the recipe really requires about a jar and a half of sauce.  I also added asiago/parm/romano ground cheese blend on top for garnish & taste.  Easy and tasty!  The color of the spinach makes a nice presentation as well.

A good jumping off place.  I really upped the seasonings in the filling.  Added lots of garlic, crushed red pepper, s & p, some chopped parsley, Italian seasoning and a pinch of nutmeg.  Used a homemade marinara I had in the freezer, that I added some sauted red peppers and sliced zucchini.  Great way to get your veggies!

This is so easy to make! I always make a double batch and freeze the prepared shells in ziploc bags. You can pull out just a few at a time for a quick lunch or have enough for diinner for a crowd.

I made this last night but based on other's comments added 1 lb beef to the sauce, and also 2 cloves fresh garlic/salt/pepper to the cheese/spinach mixture.  It turned out great and everyone loved it!  A keeper for sure.

I just love these! Very easy to make. Also good to make if you have vegetarians coming over. Even the kids liked them. =D I make more filling because what it calls for doesn't seem to make enough for one 12oz box of pasta shells. I also Keep the Shells gently siring because they can stick to the bottom of the pot when cooking and that will cause them to brake.

Very good!  Per previous suggestions, I added a little seasoning: italian, salt, pepper, and three cloves garlic, minced.  I cut the mozz into half and added 15 oz ricotta cheese plus added 1 lb ground beef into the pasta sauce.

This was really good!  But me being me had to tinker with it.  I did 3 cups of mozzarella, and saved the last cup for on top.  I added 1 cup of parm to compensate, and also added about 1/2 cup to the top with the mozz.  I added granulated garlic, about 2 tsp of salt and 1 tsp of pepper to the filling, along with a 1/2 tsp each of basil and parsley.  It looked pretty dry so I ended up throwing an egg in there too.  :)  Thanks for a great recipe!

GREAT RECIPE!  I was able to fill 30 large shells.  I substituted fresh spinach for the frozen spinach.  Prior to baking I sprinkled it with onion powder and garlic powder.  It was a last minute decision as I was trying to follow the recipe exactly but really felt it needed seasoning.  It came out wonderful and I will make it again.  Parmesan cheese, salt and pepper were available to season individually.  Thank you Jena Coffey for sharing such a GREAT recipe!!

5 out of 6 people in my family absolutely loved this which is a HUGE feat!  My super super picky eater picked at it and only didn't like the ricotta, so next time I'll leave the ricotta out of a few for him.  I added ground beef & I made my own sauce (out of tomato sauce & paste) with garlic, onion powder & Italian seasoning.  It was absolutely fantastic, and I don't even like style Italian foods!  :D

My husband and I loved this recipe.  Since there's only 2 of us it lasted 4 meals, but it was so good we still weren't tired of it.    I would recommend using a good spaghetti sauce. We will definitely be making this again.

Great, with some changes. The filling tasted a bit bland as is, so I followed other reviewers' suggestions and added chopped garlic, italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and parmesan to it. Then sprinkled the whole thing with more mozzarella and shredded parmesan. Made a second batch to freeze.

This is a nice starting place.  I changed it a some.  I used 1/2 cup of mozz & 1/2 cup parm/romano blend (used some to top it).  I sauted onions, then 1 cup chopped mushroom, then chopped 2 cups of frozen California blend up into small pieces and sauted it.  Then added 5 minced garlic cloves to saute.  For the last minute in the frying pan I added 3 Tbsp chopped fresh basil, 2 Tbsp fresh parsley, 1 Tbsp fresh oregano.  I mixed cheeses & spinach with some salt & pepper, added sauted mix & did everything else as directed.  My husband, who doesn't love shells, couldn't stop eating them!  My mother asked for the recipe immediately!

This is a great recipe and when i make it i never have any leftovers! I flavor it some more with a dash of basil and parsley, minced garlic and cooked chicken or sausage.  Everyone always raves about them and they are requested by my family often!

This was a huge hit !  I used 1lb of ground turkey to my sauce, I had to spice it up with salt, pepper minced garlic a dash of sugar and parsley.  This recipe could have used 1 & 1/2 jars of sauce.  This was my 1st time making stuffed shells...1st.. timers go for it !  I will make this again the family loved it.

First time stuffed pasta shell maker. I thought this would be boring but it was very, very good.  Liked the consistency of the filling making this recipe exactly.  Prepared everything ahead of time: cooked the pasta aldente, put on paper towels in a tray, and put in frig; made the sauce (I did add a small amount of raw Italian sausage in bubbling sauce), let it cool, put in frig. Blended the eggs and cheeses ahead of time and put in frig.  An hour before dinner I assembed it all, and baked as directed.  It was fun and delicious.

Since it's only my husband and I at home, I halve the recipe.  I also don't measure very accurately (it's just a cheese and spinach mixture, you can't go wrong).  I add salt, garlic, and onion to the cheese mix and also spice up the spaghetti sauce the way we like.  This recipe is simple and easy to make your own!!

Sooo good and so easy to make. My company loved this dish. I added salt and pepper and minced garlic to the filling and added meat to the maranara sauce. Another thing I did different was halved the mozzarella cheese in the filling and put the remainder on top of the sauce. I also made this dish earlier in the day and covered it till I was ready to bake. Really marinated the flavors!

Wow awesome. My changes were that I used sage sausage by Jimmy Dean and cut up half a yellow pepper to cook with sausage. I used a 32 oz jar of MID'S (got a Kroger) Italian Sausage pasta sauce and this was to die for. I won't be cooking any baked pasta dish with red sayce again without using this recipe.

I thought this recipe was just okay. It needed something else to add a little more flavor. If I make it again I'll try less spinach and maybe some mushrooms or italian sausage in the filling.

Loved this recipe, I make it a lot and the left overs are just as good if not better the next day. I usually add a lot of spinach and green onion to the filling for the shells and I add diced stewed tomatoes soaked in garlic and herbs seasoning to the sauce.

I agree with others, great starting point. I sauted onions and mushrooms with italian suasage and ground beef added s&p and italian seasoning. once it was cooked I added cream cheese, left out the ricotta (dont care for it) then added mozzarella to the meat mixture and then filled the shells topped with a jar of itailan sausage and onion spagetti sauce and more mozzarella... not the healthiest but fantastic.  I also added a little extra spinach as well. Loved it!

I LOVE this recipe! It's easy to make and it's delicious. I actually used the cheeses and the spinach to make a lasagna type thing and it was just as good. Especially good with Newman's Own sauce: Sockarooni - gives it a meaty taste without any meat.

It was great!  I adapted the recipe and added ingrediants.  I added 1 tbsp of jar pesto, divided the recipe in 1/2.  I added 4 oz each of crab and ham and topped with alfredo.  I them in a seperate dish added 8 oz of ground beef and topped with marinara.  It was great!

This recipe was Ok but both my husband and I felt it was a bit bland.  The stuffing needed something.  I'm not sure what but it just didn't have any oompf!

Very easy.  I did add some ground beef, onion and fresh garlic to the sauce.  I also added salt and pepper to the cheese mixture and sprinkled the top with mozz. and parm. cheese.  I have small children and they love it, spinach and all!  I have made it several times and it is always a winner!

Very good.  I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and added extra garlic, Italian spices, and some parmesean cheese.  The recipe made much more than we could eat at once, so I froze half of the stuffed shells.

I gave my sister this recipe for Fathers Day and she added chicken and hamburger to this and it was great. It gave you a little extra flavoring and made a great meal!

This seemed to be lacking something to me, just not a whole lot of flavor. I dont think I will make this again.

I only gave it a 4 because I'm a meat eater.  I buy pizza sausage, cook it through until it's pale, crumble it up and add it to mixure about 3/4 - 1 pound. Place 1/2 in mixture for filling shells and sprinkle remainder over shell!!  Mumma Meee aaaaaaa

I thought this recipe was really good. I followed it exactly. Next time i think i might halve the recipe. It filled a 13 x 9 and another dish about half that size. I only had about 2 or 3 extra shells in the end. yumm, I'm defiantly going to make it again.

This recipe is DELICIOUS and easy to make!  My hubby and our 4 year old devoured it, and I had to make another batch!! LOL!  Thank goodness the box of shells is big enough to feed them and me! :)
