I used penne pasta.  The recipe contains a bit too much oil.  Next time I will use less olive oil in the salad dressing but add more pesto.

My husband loved this salad.  As other reviewers suggested, I added the salad dressing to taste.  I also added an extra can of artichokes.  This is a great recipe for a summer potluck.

This was great! Very light and fresh pasta salad. I gave it four stars since I didn't follow the recipe exactly. At the last minute I realized I didn't have an Italian dressing packet so I upped the pesto and added juice from one lemon instead.

Very yummy pasta salad.  I just put the dressing on to taste.  Glad I tried this recipe.  Usually I'm scared by any recipe with "surprise" in the name!

A good salad. Like others said, reduce the salad dressing as it really doesn't need a lot. I let it sit in the refrigerator for a few hours to marinate.

Pasta salads normally don't go over very well in our family, but I needed something special for a Memorial Day gathering of newly discovered relatives. It was my first time for this salad  and everyone loved it.  I used a little less oil but upped the pesto by a tbspn and added a few more tomatoes for color. It will be a staple for gatherings from now on.

Yummy dish! I made this without adding the salad dressing mix and substituted the black and green olives with kalamata olives because thatâ€™s what I had in hand. Fast easy dinner, thanks for the recipe!
