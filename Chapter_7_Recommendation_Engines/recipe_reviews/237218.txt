I needed a side for some steak and had defrosted noodles and asparagus.  Buttered noodles sounded bland and we never finish our asparagus.  I am not a huge fan of it.  I thought about making a pesto and looked it up; I found this recipe.  Well, I made a few minor changes because I was missing a few ingredients and even then...it turned out great.  The best part is that we actually ate the entire batch of asparagus I bought for once!

I thought the pesto was a little bland, would definitely add more garlic for flavor if I made it again.

I had a package of fresh asparagus that I had thrown in the freezer, not knowing that it gets all mushy when you thaw it out. I hate to throw food away, so I was looking for a recipe that I could use it in, but didn't want to make soup, because frankly, it's just too darn hot outside for soup. I came upon this recipe, which was perfect for my limp asparagus. I served this with shaved Pecorino-Romano cheese on top. A nice, fresh, flavorful summer pasta dish.
