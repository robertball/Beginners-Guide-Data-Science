I'm sorry to give a low score, but my husband said it was "for the sake of another family."  LOL  We all love edamame, so we were looking forward to this soup.  While I would consider giving the taste/flavor 4 stars, everything else was lacking.  It look a lot longer to make than I expected, and the recipe doesn't specify how long "until edamame and onions are soft" might be.  I guessed and simmered it for at least 20-30 minutes.  When I put the puree in the blender, it seemed smooth, but it was not a smooth consistency when we ate it.  The milk also seemed to be WAY too much.  Hard to tell since the measurement for the edamame quantity is based on shelled edamame, but you start the recipe by using it still in the shell.  So....bottom line.....simply boil the edamame and eat them straight with a little soy sauce.  It's much better and takes a fraction of the time.

Yum!  I made some changes based on what was in the kitchen - I put a 1 lb. bag of frozen makimame (already shelled edamame) in the microwave to cook per the instructions on the bag.  I chopped up some leftover onion, a clove of garlic, and a handful of celery in a mini chopper, then sauteed the mix. I added 4 c of culinary chicken stock (the rest of the package would be wasted if I didn't).  Boil, simmer, add hot edamame beans. Cook a bit then blend with the immersion blender.  Added about 4 T butter and maybe 3 c heavy cream, then about 1/2 c of chopped bacon and seasoned with Slap Ya Mama cajun seasoning.  Plan to garnish with grated cheese, chopped green onions and more bacon.

I love this recipe. It's very filling and easy to make and has a beautiful color. For a little kick you can add some red bell pepper to the puree, although it does alter the color a bit. :)

My best friend asked me to make Edamame Soup for her birthday so I gave this recipe a try and it turned out great though I used a whole small onion instead of just half.

It turned out to be too creamy and very bland.  Also, the textures grainy (fine grain).  I used a Vitamin and blended on high really well, so I don't think it was a lack of effort.

Very Tasty!  I had a bag of frozen shelled edamame in my freezer staring me in the face for the past 6 months. This was my first time making this recipe.   I made two changes: to use a 16 oz. bag which makes 7 cups; and the use of vegetable bouillon instead of chicken stock.  It was easy to make.  (and with a Cuisinart food processor--so very easy to get the smooth consistency I wanted!!)  To make it vegetarian, I used Knorr's Vegetarian Bouillon (two cubes making 4 cups of bouillon...which really imparts a lot of taste, without overpowering the dish, to anything you use it in)  A nice change from the usual soups, and my husband loved it!  Perfect with dark crusty bread on a winter day or light enough for your taste buds any time of the year.

This soup was okay but de-skinning all those beans was not worth the time.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe but kept the beans on simmer (they were frozen) the whole prep time plus cook time until they needed to go into the blender.  I added (to my liking, everyone is different) garlic salt and some (about 1/3 cup) Holland House SAKE Cooking Wine (it's new so check a few stores for it).  Absolutely delicious - thank you for the recipe!!! :)
