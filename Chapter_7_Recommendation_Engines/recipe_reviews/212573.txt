I reduced this to three servings for my husband and I and it turned out wonderfully.    We are not fans of cooked peppers, so I substituted a large handful of frozen corn for the pepper.  We also added liberal dashes of habanero sauce at the table, but that's just because we like things spicy.  The picante sauce adds a good amount of spice just by itself.    Leftovers reheated beautifully.  Definitely going in the regular rotation for cold months!

I made this on a really cold and snowy night and it totally hit the spot.  I added a 1/2 bag of frozen corn and "kicked" it up a notch w/ some cayenne and hot sauce(we LOVE spicy.)  Good soup, will definatly make again!

I made this recipe exactly as written and I wouldn't change a thing!  It had a lot of flavor and only took minutes to put together.

Great recipe!  I substituted frozen corn for the peppers and yellow onion for the green onion due to food aversions in my household.  Delicious, easy, and loved by all.

This is excellent and easy! I used half and half instead of milk, added red and green peppers and small can of corn drained. I used fresh boiled chicken in large chunks rather than canned... the Picante makes it! I like mine spicy so I added a bit more for extra kick! Great with crusty bread or warm tortillas or tortilla chips. Thanks!

Normally, I wouldn't try a recipe that has processed cheese anything in it, but this one intrigued me.   It was okay.  I had an issue with the color and to me it seemed like it should be a dip instead of a soup.   I didn't make a single change.   It tasted fine, just not overly excited.   I probably won't make this again unless I make it thicker and call it a dip.   Hubby did suggest that maybe a can of the cheddar soup and a can of the fiesta cheddar would make it a bit more exciting.

I didn't have cheddar cheese soup on hand but had mexican velveeta. I ended up using 1 cup of velveeta with 2 cans of cream of chicken soup. I also cubed and cooked my own chicken instead of using canned. Added 2 1/2 cups of whole milk instead of canned. Otherwise everything else I kept the same. This tasted great!
