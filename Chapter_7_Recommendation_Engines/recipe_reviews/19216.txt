I use this recipe again and again.  I found the brand of dry milk that is available to me gives a grainy texture so I run it through my food processor and then add in the rest of the ingredients.  I have to half the recipe when I do this for a 10 c. processor.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!  I love it.

Loved these. I  made these with instant oats. My toddler  loved them. I  have  a  hard time getting him to eat anything so  consequently  he  is  underweight. These  are  nutrient  dense and tasty. You could play  around with  adding chocolate too. Important  to note they  do need to be refridgerated  since  there  is dry milk in them.

At first, I was looking at the dough and thinking, "YUCK"!  But I rolled them up and put them in the fridge.  I used chocolate chips instead of raisins.  We took them on a hike, and they were a big hit.  The whole batch got eaten and they stayed good for several days.  I did process the bran cereal in a food processor until fine, which helped with texture.  I will definitely make these again, perhaps subbing some of the milk powder with protein powder.

A friend's mom made these when I was a kid, now my daughter LOVES them. I use bran buds. It's easier to roll than the shredded or stick shaped bran. I use a melon ball scoop to help portion out the balls. These also freeze nicely if you don't have a house full of mouths to gobble them up. Nice and sweet, you would never guess by the taste that these are good for you and have better nutritional value than traditional snack food. Perfect recipe "as is." Thank you for sharing Emily!

MY kids were leary of the raisins, but my husband and I loved these!  I used grape nuts instead of whole bran cereal.  Nice crunch.

I loved this recipe!  I used a powdered peanut butter (you can find it in health food stores) and that lowered the fat a ton! (Around a gram of fat a serving).  I also used agave nectar in place of the honey (it has a lower glycemic index).  Great recipe!! tThanks!

Great recipe, simple enough for a 13 year old to make (and I know) and a quick and healthy snack I cut the recipe in half, and since I had no honey, I used about 3/4 cup milk, and about 2 tablespoons sugar to make up for it. I also don't like raisins, and they still turned out great!

This recipe is amazing. It is the same one my grandma used to make us when I was little. We would always eat them like crazy. The recipe is simple. I have been using corn flakes instead of bran cereal and i also do chocolate chips instead of raisins. Everyone loves them and they dissapear instantly!

When I was younger, the daycare I went to made this once in a while and I devoured them every time they did! For some reason, I still remember these treats and searched the ingredient search to find this recipe! With the exception of the type of cereal used, this is what I remember! I crushed the bran flakes before mixing in the peanut butter and honey.

Awesome recipe!! Two of my boys are allergic to peanuts, so I substituted chunky almond butter. I kept all of the other ingredients exactly the same. They turned out to be perfect! My kids think they're candy and I love all the wholesome ingredients. Thanks!!

This is a good recipe, but I wasn't crazy about the strong taste of the dry milk.  I made it a 2nd time with about 1/2 less dry milk and it was much better.  The balls were a bit stickier, but putting them in the fridge for awhile helped.

I was looking for a delicious way to choke down some healthy bran cereal I had bought.  I'm a big fan of peanutbutter, so this was a hit with me.

perfect snack! my children love these! i had been using a similar recipe, but think that this one is better--it uses less honey making them less sweet and less gooey--and my children like it just as well.  with the idea of cereal i used a couple different ones in my cabinet and they all tasted good.  grape nuts with chocolate chips and great grains with pecans were especially good!

I followed the recipe exactly. Im not sure if I could have possibly done something wrong with this simple recipe but it didn't taste very good at all. It was very 'gritty' and overall not what I had hoped it would be. Sorry!

How cool these are! I've used varying amounts of wheat germ, oats, and / or oat bran, depending on what I've got on hand.  Very good.  My two year old daughter has a blast "helping" me make these.  They're great for take-along snacks, and the adults usually eat more than the kids!

My 5 & 2 year old loved these 'cookies' and ate them as after school snacks. Even my husband, who is not a huge raisin fan, devoured them.

These are the perfect snack for kids who don't have nut allergies. My mom made them as a kid, and I've been making them for several years. I have always used coconut instead of bran cereal, and rolled them in sesame seeds for some crunch. This time I did half coconut and half Fiber One cereal. I really liked the crunch, although I think next time I'll break the cereal down a little so it spreads through the dough better. I love adding that extra fiber to my son's favorite snack.   Also, I like to refrigerate the dough for 1/2 hour before I make the balls so it's not so sticky.

An absolute favorite!  These are just like the peanut butter balls from my childhood.  We are making these as Christmas candy and realized they are also delicious dipped in chocolate bark.

Really good taste, except for the bran cereal. I think it's better without it. I made this today without the raisins and it was really good, but the bran was hard and poked out. We just didn't like the bran taste in it. Next time, it will just be the peanut butter, milk, and honey. I also dipped in chocolate. Yummy. Thanks for the recipe.

Everyone loves these (kids and adults).   I use non dairy creamer instead of dried milk...makes them taste creamier.

i gave these five stars but i must say i altered the recipe quite a bit.  
I blended together all-bran and old fashioned oats and in a coffee grinder I ground flax seeds (made about two cups total with all the dry ingredients together). i did not have dry milk so this is why i added the other dry ingredients (and to make it more healthy).  
In a bowl, I mixed together all dry ing. until mixed well, then added a little over two cups of chunky peanut butter and a little less than 1/2 c. of honey.  I mixed well and used my hands, it was pretty sticky.
I then rolled this mixture into balls between my hands and coated them with sweetened coconut flakes.  
I put wax paper on a cookie tray and they are setting in the fridge, will taste them in the morning.
Orginially i was shooting for sugar free, gluten free but this recipe has both (the all-bran has wheat and the peanut butter was not sugar free and the coconut was sweetened).  next time I'll get natural pb and use unsweetened coconut flakes.

I've made these a few times now and they are excellent! The best thing about this recipe is that you can play around with it so much. My favorite is to use chunky peanut butter, switch out the bran cereal for oats, and omit the raisins. I add chia seeds, cinnamon, and coconut flakes and it turns out awesome. Last time I put a tablespoon of hot chocolate mix into half the dough, so that half were chocolatey without the dipping mess. I think these will be around very often now that i've discovered them!

Mama used old fashioned oats instead of cereal.  They came out a bit sweet for my taste, but I will adjust with more peanut butter and less honey in the future.

I liked these a lot.  Added in local honey, non-GMO soy protein powder (instead of the powdered milk), toasted oats.  I keep them in the freezer and grab one when I want a snack.  I also through a few in a small container and use them to give me a boost when I know I will be out shopping or on a trip for awhile.

Works great with pb alternatives too, for those with peanut allergies.  We used sunflower seed butter.
Also used a combination of bran flakes and graham crackers (just what I had on hand) and ran those and the powdered milk through the food processor so it wasn't so grainy.

This is a great recipe, and we love it right out of the freezer.  I have also used this recipe and substituted nutella for PB.  I usually do one cup of nutella and one cup PB.  My kids like the chocolate.  I also use a small scoop and press the mixture into the scoop (as sometimes they are a little crumbly to roll) and place on a cookie sheet.  They aren't round, but still look nice and uniform size.  Per some other recommendations I also blend the dry milk to give it a smoother texture.  
Thanks!!!

This treat is oddly addictive, and great for snacks. I changed the recipe a little... that is, cut out mostly everything. I kept the honey and peanut butter, and replaced the gran with quick oats. I'll probably fiddle with the measurements next time, and try adding in some chocolate chips. The recipe's unrecognizable now, but thanks for the template.

I made these with both (golden) raisins and chocolate chips, (combined), and they were really good!  I put the bran flakes through the food processor, as others suggested.  My only problem was the adhesion.  These crumble like nobody's business, so I had to follow my 1-year old around with a vacuum.  Although, I shouldn't really complain because my 1-year old was eating something healthy :-). Thumbs up for a healthy, yummy snack!  Thanks for the recipe.

I used to make these years ago then lost the recipe. Thanks for bringing it back. I'm a diabetic so I added 1/2 cup  brown sugar Splenda instead of honey and added unsweetened coconut, some raisins and a few chocolate chips. I didn't add the bran but next time I might try some graham cracker crumbs.  These are great as a snack if you love peanut butter. I used chunky pb. They are also great frozen.

Great little protein snack! I also added mini-chocholate chips and rolled oats. I love these for lunchboxes, hikes, or just a healthy snack.

If your using  instant dry milk and it's not powder, you must put it in a processor like another review has suggested.  also save time by using an ice cream scoop to make your balls.  If your using a Larger ice cream scoop you should end up with about 20 balls.  I would also highly recommend using quick cooking instant oatmeal in place of the bran.  This is going to be a great after school snack for my daughter when I am at work!!  Love it!!

I got to make the recipe, it lasted about a month in the freezer eating it little by little.  It was Extremely Delicious!  And I'm about to make it again but i don't have flax seed now so I'm adding a little of peanut butter instead this time and see how it turns! ;) Thank you for the recipe!

I made this using a jar of cashew butter that was too separated and stiff to stir.  I put it in the food processor, and blended it up, then added 1 cup bran flakes, the powdered milk, and the honey and mixed it in the food processor.  Then I added 1 1/2 cups crisp rice cereal (needed to be used up), and the raisins, and finished mixing by hand.  Other than tasting a little stale (that old cashew butter!) they are great.  A good way to get my sweet fix while I'm pregnant, while also getting some protein.  

By the way, before I cleaned up my food processor, I dumped in a second jar of separated cashew butter and mixed it, and poured it back in the jar.  I'm thinking, "Why don't I just make my own nut butter in this thing?"
