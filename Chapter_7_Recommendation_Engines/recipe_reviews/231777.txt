Fantastic! I used 1 cup of dark raisins and 1 cup of golden raisins (no currants). This was so quick and easy to put together and baked up beautifully (the house smelled amazing)! I do not have a 9 inch cast iron skillet, so I used a 9 inch cake pan...worked perfectly.  We couldn't even wait for it to cool completely before cutting into it...absolutely delicious! This will be my go-to Irish soda bread from now on~YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

This Irish Bread recipe will now be my go-to recipe! I have tried several others and none compare to this one! The only difference is I did not use the dried currants and I used golden raisins instead of regular ones. I would like to try it with caraway seeds next time. This bread stays together and is not crumby at all! This bread is a tad sweet and FABULOUS!!!

Very good bread recipe.  I made it without the fruit but next time I will try it with light & dark raisins.  It is very good toasted the next day.

I have never posted a review but had to this time. I always buy my soda bread but decided to make it at home. Followed the recipe to the letter. The best irish soda bread ever. Thanks for a great recipe.

Thank you for sharing your family recipe--it was absolutely delicious, and I loved the simplicity. I made it with what I had on hand, cranberries and walnuts. Spectacular!

I'll admit I'm not the greatest bread maker so I struggled a bit with incorporating the extra flour because this dough was really sticky to begin with. All in all this turned out well. It has a soft, sweet, dense inner consistency with a crusty outer layer. It does make a good size loaf so will feed a lot.
