This was very simple to make.  The first time I had it, it tasted more like brownies.    Made some modifications and the 2nd time around was EXCELLENT: used 7 oz of semi-sweet choco + 7 oz of milk chocolate chips; used 3/4 cup of whipping cream; used 1/4 cup of light brown sugar.  Also only baked for 25 min at 325°F and it baked more like a truffle than a brownie.

This is AMAZING! I was nervous about trying this recipe after reading the other reviews, but I'm so glad I tried it! The quality of the pie I think really depends on the quality of chocolate you use. I used Ghirardelli 60% bittersweet chocolate, but I recommend Lindt or Hershey's as well. An excellent recipe.

This pie was easier to make than I was expecting it to be. Great texture, very rich. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of the squares. I don't get it that people say it isn't sweet enough...you're using SEMI-sweet chocolate.

It was good, but not something I would make 'as-is' again. It was not terribly sweet, so if you want something that isn't too sweet, this would be for you. Very chocolatey. I would try at least half the squares as sweetened chocolate next time. With that tweek, I'd make it again!

One review used an oreo crust so I did that too.  I also used chocolate chips instead of squares, and baked for 30 mins.  Rich and yummy.  Will definitely be making this again.

I have made this a few times and we love it.  You don't need a large piece, a little goes along way.  Topped with real whipped cream lightly sweetened.  Can't ask for an easier dessert.

i used an oreo cookie crust but otherwise did nothing different.  you don't really need the whip cream.  i am a huge chocolate fan and this has got to be the very best chocolate pie i've ever had.

Not sure what happened, but my first attempt made something with more of a brownie-like texture instead of a pie texture. Plus, the chocolate did not come thru as well as I had hoped.

This tasted EXACTLY like a chocolate chip with the texture of a brownie. If you like dark chocolate, you'll probably love this, but I'm a milk chocolate fan and it was too much for me, even with whipped cream or ice cream. I'll probably end up giving it away.

This is a VERY rich dessert, so break out the glasses of milk. I followed the advice of a previous reviewer and the pie did turn our more truffle like than brownie like. You don't need the full 35 minutes. Mine was done in 25. This is a more bitter dessert, so next time I'll either add a mix of milk chocolate and semi sweet or add a raspberry topping or both.

Tried this one for Christmas.  Very rich! Almost too rich.  Guinea pig Hubby says "too much cocoa."  I ended up cutting the pie up into small squares like brownies, sprinkled powdered sugar on top, and took it to a party.  Most of it got eaten.  Probably won't make again.

Made for husband's birthday cake. Very easy recipe. We prefer less sweet taste and this had a dense, fudge texture like that of a rich, flourless cake. Using ingredients I had in house, I halved everything except the sweetener, using 4 oz. of unsweetened Baker's chocolate and 1/2 c pure maple syrup. Put the bowl and beaters in the freezer and add 2 TBS vanilla
to 1 pt real heavy whipping cream. Bake in 5 x 9 loaf pan. Serve on fancy elongated serving plate.

Perfect sweetness for us. I used semi-sweet (60%) chocolate chips, and I used half-and-half instead of the cream.

Just didn't care for this semi-sweet pie.   The chocolate was too strong.  We like a chocolate pie without the bite.  Otherwise, if you like that bold chocolate flavor, you will like this one.

This is perfect for a dark chocolate lover like me. I love chocolate, but can easily pass on milk chocolate so this hit the spot for me. It is quick, easy & delicious. If you're looking for milk chocolate or sweet keep on looking. But if you savor the flavor of chocolate, dark chocolate, this a keeper.

I wanted so, so badly to like this. I followed a few suggestions from other reviewers, namely using an Oreo pie crust and using a combination of milk chocolate and semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of the semi-sweet bakers chocolate. Even with the milk chocolate chips, it just was not sweet enough and had a very "heavy" texture. I probably will not make this one again.
