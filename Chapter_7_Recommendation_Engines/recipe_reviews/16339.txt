I really liked this recipe but my family isn't big cheddar fans so I used crumbled Bleu Cheese.  That was a real hit.  Another friend doesn't like cherries, so I used green grapes and for the juice ?? of course a splash of white wine !!  Serving my brothers and a few friends, I doubled everything.  They would have laughed at a single pear half.

This was a fast easy little salad to put together. I used grenadine syrup instead of cherry juice and a cinnamon candy for the top since I was out of maraschino cherries. I didn't care much for the mayo taste though so I'd skip it next time, but that's a personal thing, I really don't like mayo anyway. I used fresh pears instead of canned. This is a really pretty dish as well. Thanks.

Mom used to make a very similar recipe to this, so I used this recipe and made it her way. She used pineapple  juice and small chunks instead of cherries.  Yum!
