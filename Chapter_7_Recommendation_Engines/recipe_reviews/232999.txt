This is exactly how I make my croutons only I use garlic powder and add only a little salt (I don't like my food overly salty and we like to control our salt intake). I also add a little dried parsley and fresh ground pepper.

We love buttery croutons, so this recipe was just right up our alley!  The amount of butter could be scaled back just a little because there was still some left in the bowl when my bread cubes were plenty saturated.  Next time I think I would use half garlic powder and half garlic salt because these were just a little salty for us.  I had to remove the bowl of baked croutons from in front of my family for sampling or we would not have had any left for our salad!  Yum!

These are so incredibly easy and made a huge difference in my salad this evening.  I think I will begin to buy a loaf of french bread each week and make a batch of these croutons for soups and salads.  So economical and the possibilities are endless with different bread types, oils and seasonings.

Used loaf of french bread, added minced garlic to butter as it melted. Then coated bread crumbs in bowl w/ butter mixture. Did not add salt, as butter is salted, and we don't need the extra sodium.
After spreading on pan, sprinkled Parmesan /herb mix from Papa Murphys on it. Baked  300 and turned every few minutes until crispy.
Will never use store bought again.
My grandchildren loved these as snacks. Which is better than candy!

I made these buttery croutons and all I can say is that these were the best! I will NEVER buy store croutons again. Very, very, easy to make. Nice and Crunchy even the next day for soup. Make sure that leftover croutons goes into an air tight container, the croutons stay nice and fresh.
