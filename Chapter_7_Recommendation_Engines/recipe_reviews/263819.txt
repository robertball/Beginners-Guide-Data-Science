An awesome recipe, though I baked these rather than grilling.  I added black beans to the peppers and corn, and had a nice little meal all ready.  My family really enjoyed these, and have been asking for them again.  Particularly good if your busy family has to eat dinner at different times occasionally.

It was so good.  I added butter to to increase the liquids and finished I served the veggies over rice.
