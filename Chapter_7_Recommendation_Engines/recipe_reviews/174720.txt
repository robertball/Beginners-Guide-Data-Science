Good grief people!  You are supposed to rate the recipe on HOW IT TASTES not on how the picture looks or how many calories are in it or the ingredients you THINK should have been included. If you haven't eaten it please don't make the rest of scroll through useless reviews to find helpful ones!

Having just read multiple reviews of this dish I will start by saying that yes, there are a number of ways the fat content can be reduced. However, I will review the dish based on the provided recipe.
First of all, the top three things about this dish: the taste is quite flavorful, the presentation can be quite elegant, and there are several steps that can be done ahead. Those three things mean this dish lends itself very well to dinner party fare.
On preparation:  With respect to the chicken, you can do everything up to placing it in the oven in advance. I used quite a bit more oregano (probably 1 tbsp.) as I just wasn't getting enough flavor from the 1/8 tbsp. prescribed in the recipe. I also upped the pepper quite a bit. (Probably 1/2 - 3/4 tbsp.)
I used panko instead of traditional bread crumbs and it browned BEAUTIFULLY! 
When purchasing your chicken, look for larger breasts as they are easier to stuff and you can get a lot more of the yummy filling in them. And trust me, the filling is VERY yummy.
Because the breasts I purchased were smaller, I had leftover filling. I decided to add it to the mashed potatoes and it was delightful. I sauteed the onion and added three cloves of minced garlic. I mixed that with the leftover filling I had, the butter and sour cream and let it all sit until the potatoes were done, then mashed it into the onion/feta mixture.  
I served the chicken/mashed potatoes with fresh spinach and my whole family raved about the meal. (Kids included!!)

How bout cutting out 2/3 of the calories and getting great flavor out of this great recipe.  I used low fat sour cream, low salt bacon. Instead of breading the chicken and cooking in bacon fat, I pan seared in olive oil and baked until done...it was excellent and not heavy at all..nice and brown on all sides  yum

This was super yummy.  I only made the chicken part, because it felt like to heavy of a meal with the potatoes too.  I made a couple of small changes...I added parmeson cheese to the bread crumbs as well for the coating.  I also added minced garlic and shallots to the stuffing.  Rather then frying the chicken, I put 1/2 pat of butter on each breast and baked the chicken in the oven.  It took about 45 minutes to cook complete.  Make sure to spray the baking pan with non-stick spray!

Amazing! Did have to cook for nearly an hour. Added about 1/4 cup of white wine while baking. The best thing I've had in a long time!

It's always tempting to cook chicken longer, and I'm glad I didn't in this instance. Using 3, thick, bonelss, skinkless breasts, the cook time was perfect.  (Nothing worse than overdone, dry chicken.) Cooked the bacon to a crisp and crumbled them in with the feta mixture. I recommend a little more sour cream in the stuffing.  Well worth the prep - both were delicious. Thank you for the recipe, the next day at work every passerby saw my leftovers and wanted the recipe.

Sounds delicious so wanted to read reviews.  Why on earth would you even open a recipe called FETA and BACON with MASHED if you're counting calories? Read line 1 "Not for anyone watching their diet !!"  Do your thing and don't try to impose your views on those of us who want to enjoy a great meal at least once in awhile. There is a whole section of Allrecipes devoted to low calorie recipes.  Go there.

Wow!  This was absolutely scrumptious!  This was my first time stuffing chicken so I was a little worried about how it would turn out.  Well...as it turns out, I'm a pretty good chicken stuffer!  :)  Made exactly as recipe calls except I used real bacon bits instead of frying some fresh.  Because of this I had to brown the chicken in vegetable oil, so I didn't have the bacon taste throughout.   Next time I'm using real bacon. The stuffing was delicious and not nearly as hard to stuff in the chicken as I would have thought.  I did not make the potatoes only because my husband hates onions.  Very pleased with the look and taste of the end result...definitely making this again soon!

This was really good! I didn't have feta, so I used what I had; parm, swiss, and cheddar. I also added 1/4 cup chopped walnuts and a little garlic. Instead of breading the chicken, I just dipped it in milk and flour and browned the breasts in the bacon grease BEFORE I stuffed them.  Came out great!

As I often do, I offered this to my Level 2 Culinary Arts Class whose iterpretation of Feta was correct and used Cow's Milk Feta, however since most of the emphasis was on bacon and bacon fat (I loath the word grease) the subtle flavours of the chicken were masked. We also followed the rule and completed the accompanying onion mashed potatoes and fouind that here the bacon was also detected. I am always reluctant to have too many animals vying for attention so the combination of pig, poultry and dairy required some unorthodox handling and to those who may have added goat feta, the complexity of the compound is even more so. However, others who made it enjoyed it and the bottom line in cooking art is to enjoy the process and the result to be aimed for.

I haven't made this yet but am certainly going to make it in the next few days. I gave it 5 stars because I could taste it in my mind and it is right up my alley ingredient wise. I noticed that several people criticized the recipe without trying it because of the quantity of bacon, bacon fat and cream used. Well big deal, no one says you have to eat like this every day. Indulge yourself once in a while, it feels good. A famous Food Network Chef was asked why he used a certain ingredient instead of a "healthier" one. His response was "I will not sacrifice flavor nor texture for health." He went up several notches in my book. The bacon could be detected throughout the dish. Of course it could, that's why you use bacon in the dish in the first place.

I used much less bacon and feta and low fat sour cream to try and lighten this up a bit.  I also used only one egg for the breading and about half a cup of seasoned bread crumbs.  I made the accompanying onion mashed potatoes and thought they were a nice compliment to the chicken.  I could also only eat half my chicken so I saved the other half for lunch the next day.  As someone who is watching my weight, I still think that this is a good recipe and will definately make it again, like all good and rich food, it will just be in moderation :)

Wow, this recipe sounds amazing!  But 1500 calories for 1 meal?  I'd love to see a lower fat version, or possibly smaller portions?  But... my mouth was watering while I was reading the recipe.

I have made this and it is very good and easy to make. For those of you who rated it on calorie count and to many animals in the mix, I say, if it isn't something you would eat because of the calories or animals involved, then maybe you shouldn't be rating the recipe. I say rate it on flavor, taste and texture, all of which, in ths recipe, gets 5 stars!

5 stars for this recipe, this is fantastico!  

1 star for the previous reviewer who poo-poo'd this b/c it has too many calories?  Please... how about searching on a diff site, rather than poorly rating a fabulous dish because you "can't afford to eat so richly"?

Really, Really tasty.
I was concerned that there was not enough seasoning (salt) in the recipe, but with the bacon and all grease it came out very balanced.

This was really good.  I used panko instead of regular bread crumbs and I had to use a red onion up, so I used that in the potatoes.  I loved the potatoes the best.  The chicken was good, I flattened it and then rolled it up w/ the cheese stuff in the middle.  Thanks for a great and very rich meal.

Delicious!!!  And regarding another reviewer, if you want a low cal or less fat recipe, figure out how to do it yourself and add it!  This is fantastic as is!  When I want a low cal dish, I LOOK for one.

bloody amazing, my mother calls this dish restaurant quaility food.  I used  4 chicken breast but did not change the amount of the filling.  The potatoes by them selves needed salt but when paired with the chichen they were devine.  Next time I want to add the left over feta filling into the potatoes and this will eliminate the need for salt as well as tie it into the dish better.  I thought that the bacon was going to over power the chicken but gave a really nice flavour

This was a hit with my girlfriends.  And no, this is not an 'everyday' meal but one of those 'special' occasion meals that one fixes once in a while.  Hence, splurging a bit on calories is not the end of the world.  Totally agree that the bacon grease is a must for flavor purposes, in my opinion.  I'm not a bacon-lover but I didn't mind it in this recipe.  This can easily be served with a spring salad and some asparagus and nix the mashed potatoes, if calories are a concern, and you'll still be satisfied.

I followed the recipe exactly how it was written and it came out great!! My husband really loved it, and he's not a big fan of chicken.

Instead of Feta you could use Fontina, Havarti, Monterey Jack, Muenster or Pepper Jack, but they won't have as much flavor as Feta.  
I also agree with the lower fat version, low-fat sour cream, don't use the bacon grease or so much bacon.

Delicious recipe!! My husband claimed to be in a "trance" afterwards:) My only suggestion is to brown the chicken before stuffing, and for less time. I browned my first piece for the suggested 2 minutes on each side, and it ended up burning.

Loved it.  The only thing I did different was not cooking everything in bacon grease because we had bacon for breakfast so I used the left over bacon for the chicken.  Fried everything in garlic olive oil.  I also didn't have breadcrumbs so I used 1/4 cup flour and 1/2 cup of corn meal.  It turned out great, will do it again.

This recipe was easy to make and loved by the whole family. I did not make the mashed potatoes, instead I served with couscous and sauteed zucchini. I also did not bread the chicken, but that was a personal preference. I subbed blue cheese for the feta b/c that's what I had on hand. The cook time was just about right and the chicken came out flavorful, moist, and tender!

First I would like to make the disclaimer that I did make a few changes in this recipe due to personal taste. The chicken: I used panko breadcrumbs instead of regular (for more texture) and added about 1 teaspoon of Italian seasoning to them for flavor. My boyfriend and I decided to cut a bit of fat and skipped the frying of the chicken, instead baking it in the oven completely. I felt the mashed potatoes were a bit dry so I added 2-3 tablespoons of milk.
With these changes, I will DEFINITELY make this again. I think even made as-is the recipe would still be five star, though maybe only four for the potatoes.

Did a version of this that might be a little healthier...made the filling but added some green bell peppers to it and stuffed portobello mushrooms with the filling...baked at 425 degrees for twenty minutes.  Easy, a little healthier, and delicious!!!

This review is for the stuffed chicken only as I didn't make the onion mashed potatoes.  This chicken is wonderful.  You must like the taste of feta cheese to enjoy this as it is a little strong.  I changed the browning steps to this, which is why I only gave it 4-stars.  I browned in the skillet before I added the stuffing.  After browning, I then stuffed it and baked.  We enjoyed the blend of flavors in this.  The next time I make it, I will make the potatoes to go with it.  Thanks Danielle for sharing the recipe.

I made this last night! and it was wonderful...the only thing i changed, i made rissoto (the boxed kind but added wipping cream to make really creamy) instead of mashed potatoes w/ bacon, and the texture was great with the chicken and not too overpowering. i also used pre-cut bacon from the salad section (the real bacon, not bacos!), to cut down on the grease and time but this still added so much flavor. Also, i substituted the sour cream w/ the same amount of a sauteed mixture where i added alfredo sauce, wipping cream and freshly chopped garlic cloves...

This was a hit!! I used reduced fat Feta cheese, 1 tablespoon of oregano, and crackers mixed with garlic salt instead of breadcrumbs.  I baked it in a 9X13 pan for 45 minutes in the oven instead of frying the chicken.

This was a wonderful recipe and surprisingly my 3 kids loved it as well.  I had to change a few things though.  I only had 6oz (3/4 cup) of Fetta so I added some Mozerella (3-4 oz).  I also added an extra heaping teaspoon of sour cream.  For the bread crumbs I used chopped up Italian Seasoned Stuffing.  I also used a whole pound of bacon and cooked it crisp enough to crumble into 1/2 in pieces or less.  I didn't worry about cooking it soft because bacon always softens when I bake it.

I used turkey bacon and nonfat sour cream to cut down on fat in this dish and it was still very flavorfull. I also floured egged and breaded the chicken before I stuffed it. It was easier to handle that way. A new family favorite!

The results of this recipe are very tasty. However, the chef needs to reevaluate the cooking sequence. For example, the menu seems to imply putting the stuffing into the cavity prior to apllication of the egg, flour and crumbs. I switched the sequence on my third and fourth chicken breast putting the egg, flour and crumbs on first, then inserting the feta, bacon mixture. Additionally, I used cooking toothpicks to hold the flaps of chicken together. The meal was exceptional, especially the taters. My wife is German and was raised in North Dakota. She loved the potatoes and is my resident expert on the taste of potatoes. Try the meal, it is great. Just add sweet peas or something else to complete the meal.

I DO watch my calories but this is worth the splurge....and the prep time. I actually did all the prep early in the day and the baking later. Only change I made was that I didn't have quite enough Feta on hand so I combined it with some bleu....this is a fantastic dish, regardless of healthiness! It is a "treat" meal as far as we are concerned. ALSO....most average eaters can be happy with HALF a breast, thereby enjoying this great recipe AND cutting some of the fat.

Delicious! I added mushrooms to the stuffing mix and used fat free sour cream and cooked the chicken in a bit of olive oil rather than reusing the saturated bacon fat which I am not fond of. The chicken was tender and yummy! I also did not make the potatoes, but opted instead for some whole wheat pasta. Thanks for sharing!

The chicken was terrific, but I did not care for the potatoes at all. My potato-loving daughter didn't even like them. The chicken was so filling anyway, that serving potatoes of any sort was over-kill. The chicken breasts were huge after I stuffed them. I will keep this recipe, but even though we all enjoyed it, it still cannot compare to the wonderful taste of Carrabba's Chicken Bryan made with goat cheese. This recipe is easy to find on the web. It tastes better and is actually less messy to make than this one. The breasts in this recipe held up surprisingly well throughout the browning and cooking and the stuffing mixture also stayed in place nicely. With Chicken Bryan you simply place the goat cheese on top of each cutlet. Next time I will try to combine these two recipes by using the Bryan ingredients but stuffing the cutlets. I still would have given this recipe five stars if it weren't for those plain nasty potatoes.

I didn't make the potatoes, or bread the chicken, but this was still phenomenal! My husband said it was one of the best things he's ever eaten. We will definitely be having this again!

Yum, I only made a slight detour from the original recipe...pan fried the bacon, and used cornflake crumbs instead of bread crumbs.  The chicken was moist and flavourful.  I don't think I stuffed it enough, I had 5 breasts and was left over with some of the bacon/cheese mixture.  I used it in scrambled eggs the next day.  Will make again, but not too often just because of high caloric intake, but delicious!

Amazing. This is the best-tasting dish I have ever created, my family LOVED it. My boyfriend begs me to make this every couple of weeks! So juicy and flavorful, although I had enough stuffing to prepare 4 chicken breast halves instead of 3, and they were still jam-packed. I also used a whole pound of bacon instead of 3/4ths of a pound, but that just made it taste even better! This recipe is definitely a keeper and made its way into my recipe box!!!

I made this with turkey bacon and reduced fat feta cheese.  The recipe makes more filling than needed, but we ate the leftovers with crackers - delicious.  Chicken came out very juicy and the combination of the smoky bacon and tangy feta cheese was incredible.  Will definitely make this again!

This was delicious!  The flavors melded nicely...I simplified it by skipping the browning in bacon grease for time and health...but absolutly loved!  Thanks for sharing.

SOOOOO GOOOOOOD!!! and YES I agree with DivaMom!!!  I love how people CHANGE the recipe and then give it a "LOW" rating or in this case "CHANGE the CALORIE COUNT"...LOL  Maybe they should go to "WEIGHT WATCHERS SITE".  Anyway this is a GREAT recipe.  I did use much more sour cream than listed, used Italian Bread Crumbs (as this was all I had) and added a bit more spice but only because we love our food "wet, messy and spicy!"  I also doubled the recipe for my "Big Eatin Family"  EVERYONE from 6 yrs. old to 53 yrs. old LOVED IT, mash potatoes as well....A big hit and unfortunately, NOT enough left overs for ME!  THANK YOU FOR THIS RECIPE....YUM YUM  P.S. Next time I will adjust the amount of ingredients and add some fresh spinach.....YUM!

This was really great.  I used olive oil instead of the bacon fat (I used some leftover bacon I fried a few days ago so I did not have the grease) I took another reviewers suggestion and used panko bread crumbs and it was perfectly crunchy! My kids loved this as well as my husband.  I will make this again for sure!  Thanks for the recipe!

You have got to be kidding me! Evidently only certain reviews are published? 1/8 of a Tablespoon? how much is that? 1/8 of a teaspoon? In a recipe this flavorful, how can such small amounts of anything affect taste? Looks good though, and I intend to try it. Jeffro. Based on recipe, I give it 4 stars

This dish was amazing!  It was well worth the mess it left me with in the kitchen lol!  I have never tried feta as I cannot get past the smell, so I used shredded cheddar instead.  A major hit at my house!  It made me think of Sunday dinners at my Grammas house when I was a kid!  Thank you =)

WOW!!!  I'd never had feta cheese before and... WOW!  This was so good!  I had to triple the recipe to feed 9 people, next time I will triple the number of chicken breasts, and quadruple the amout of filling so that I can stuff them more full.  But really just with a modist amount of filling this was really reallly good!
Oh... and due to being short on time I couldn't make the taters :( but I really wanted to...

This Chicken is fantastic. I'm sure you could drizzle olive oil on it to save on some of the fat, but what fun would that be?
Also I used bone in breasts, we slit them in almost in half along the bone, fried them, and then stuffed them to bake. Turned out perfect.

This dish was amazing! I was so surprised at how fast the chicken cooked and how absolutely tender and moist it was. The potatoes were really yummy too and I didn't need to add anything to it! We had leftovers for days and it was FAB!!

Delicious! I used 1/2 cup of Feta because I was out, 1/4 cup of Monterrey jack cheese, and 1/4 cup of Parm, as a substitute.

This was really good! I liked the feta/bacon stuffing, but I think it needs to be eaten with the chicken, and not alone, or it is salt overload. I liked the potatoes as well, but i think next time I would sautee the onions in EVOO instead of the bacon grease to cut the fat content a wee bit. Thanks for sharing!

so this is my first hard recipe, 
i am so proud of myself for trying my best, i found trouble with the breadcrumbs part the didnt stick very well, and i didnt have all my measuring things so i did guess on the pepper and oregano part, but it dont hurt to guess sometimes lol live and learn,but i really enjoyed making this,everything came together well,but i did wrap each of my chicken breast with alumni foil individual, to help with holding the insides together and cooking faster, but i would make this again

This has such a great combination of flavors, and while it requires a bit more work than most of the stuff I cook these days, it looks impressive, and is well-received. I would say, however, that it is MUCH easier to cook if you forgo the butterflying method, and just pound the breasts flat, then roll them up with the filling in the middle. The feta/bacon mixture seems to meld together better, plus it has less of a tendency to fall out when the chicken cooks. Anyway, nice recipe. Thanks, danielle!

This recipe was out of this world! I held mine together for the frying process using toothpicks. It was not extremely difficult or time consuming.  The texture was great and the flavors went well together. With the mashed potatoes, it was the perfect combination of sweet and savory! Very pretty on the plate as well. Going to do this one again.

At first it seems like a lot of favors, maybe even too much but it's perfect!!! Only thing I changed was adding salt and pepper to the chicken prior to dipping it in the egg and flour. I also added garlic powder, salt, and pepper to the breadcrumbs, just a handful of each.

This recipe took a little longer to cook and to prepare. The most difficult part for me was the browning of the chicken breast in the bacon grease. Overall it was okay.

Recipe was great! I added a full tablespoon of oregano, half of basil, and half of parsley I thought it was under seasoned( but I'm typically told I over season). So you might want to try the original first. I also added sun dried tomatoes to the stuffing. For the coating I used panko w/ fresh Parmesan and some garlic powder. There was a bit of stuffing left over so I added it to the potatoes, along with some garlic and a little extra butter and sour cream. The over season nay sayer loved it as did I. This might just be my next Easter family dinner.

Danielle-you are an evil genius! Amazingly, this recipe called for everything I had laying around the house wrapped into one. Amazing. And it is delicious! I am not sure how I was supposed to cut up the chicken, (my problem, not the recipe's)so I ended up with the chicken being a little thicker than I think it is supposed to be. Other than that this dish is amazingly rich and delicious!!

This was the first time I've ever made stuffed chicken breasts, I suggest with this recipe you do as I did, and prep the day before by cooking the bacon and mixing it with the feta and other ingredients.  Cut up and saute the onions and the potatoes too.  Just add water and a couple table spoons of lemon juice to the potatoes to prevent them from turning brown and store them in a sealed bowl.  Also store the Feta mix and onions is seperate sealed bowls as well.  Be sure to drain the drippings from the bacon into a container while still liquified in the pan.

Prepping the chicken and frying it is enough work in itself on the day you plan on serving this dish.  I only served it for the four of us and feel as though prep time for a rookie can be almost up to an hour.  So just be prepared and leave yourself enough time.

Be sure to have extra breadcrumbs on hand depending on the size of the chicken breasts you may need more.  I also seasoned the chicken lightly with Garlic Salt, Old Bay Seasoning, and black pepper and dried oregano.

When the potatoes are done heat the sauted onions in the microwave for 30 seconds so the mixture softens and isn't cold when adding to the potatoes to mash them.

Very good!  I had my teenagers make this for our family.  Because they are new cooks, I had them just bake the chicken in a 9x13 covered with foil instead of the suggested way of cooking.  The last few minutes they uncovered and broiled the tops to add some color.  Because there was a bit of stuffing left over, I had them top each chicken with it and it browned nicely under the broiler.  So delicious, I could use this recipe for company!

I have not yet tried this recipe, but it looks and sounds delicious.  I will be giving it a try.  I have to say that people should rate and review this recipe.  If you have altered it to your liking that is great, but it is not the same recipe.  If you used reduced fat or less salt for your liking please post your own recipe.  It should say reduced fat and sodium Feta and Bacon stuffed chicken with onion mashed potatoes.  I usually don't post reviews, but I am a little tired of reading useless reviews on how people changed the recipe.  Most people that are health concious like myself will know how to make substitutions on there own.  Enough said,  I look foward to trying your recipe Danielle!

Definitely a nice comfort meal.  Loved the stuffing.  I added a tad of sundried tomatoes to the mix.  I will try some of the other versions in the future.  But great base recipe.  Thanks!

This is definitely worth the effort it takes to make it!!!  The flavors of the bacon, feta and chicken blend so wonderfully.  The chicken breasts I used were quite large so I cut them in half and it still worked well.  Love, love this and have sent it to several relatives for them to enjoy also!

Fantastic! However, it was my first time "stuffing" chicken and I don't think I put in enough mixture.  I think next time I will probably stuff it a little more.  My husband raved about this meal, and even asked me to cook it for the in-laws.

we felt the feta was too strong, would cut is by half. we used the recipe as given, it is high calorie, so it would be beneficial to reduce the filling, which too overwhelming. had no trouble leaking out.a

This recipe was absolutely delicious!!!! Our friends that were up from Connecticut kept raving about it. We added garlic to the potatoes, and basil with the feta, oregano, sour cream & pepper mixture. Your taste buds will thank you for the time & effort put in to making this recipe.

My husband and I both agree that this was not very good.  The chicken itself came out great but the stuffing was gross.  It tasted great before I baked it.  I had made extra bacon for my son to munch on while he waited for dinner, and we all ended up dipping it (the extra bacon in the stuffing).  That was good.  But after we baked it, something about the sour cream and the feta cheese just did not blend.  My kids (6 and 4)enjoyed it though.

Made this last night, had alot of the stuffing left over, perhaps my chicken breasts were smaller thna was recommended, but, i used some of the leftover stuffing in the potatoes and in addition i would recommend adding some milk to the potatoes as they were a bit thick for our taste. My husband requested that next time i add tomatoes to the stuffing mix (bacon, feta and tomatoes sounds good). Otherwise was very yummy, we all ate it up.

Wonderful!  Only needed half the bacon and didn't try the potatoes (picky children).  We all thought the chicken was awesome!  Thanks!

Wow! This was great! My husband is in training right now to go work as a contractor in Afganistan and, luckily, is able to come home on the weekends. I made this last night for him and he LOVED it! Will make again, but I thinkiam going to cut a small hole and "inject" the filling with a large zip lock bag so the filling stays in the breast better. I did onion powder and garlic powerful the filling, other than that made as directed.

This was a great recipe!   we didnt do the potatoes so I can only rate the chicken.   Think we will try putting fresh spinanch in next time.   Didnt give it a 5 star only because my 9 year old didnt like the feta...  so next time his will have chedder...

Great meal, I used Corn Flakes crumbs instead of Bread Crumbs (made for a almost perfect crust) and GF Flour, Turned out amazing.

Very good.  My husband and I had this for dinner last night.   He took leftovers to work for lunch.  Both meals he said "very good" and that's it.  We both liked it.  I made it exactly as per recipe.  Very good.

This was a very tasty dish. My PICKY 3 year old ate a chicken breast with no questions or complaints. Hubby and I loved it I had to make sure I made him a leftover plate of this one.  This one gets a thumbs up from me.

Might taste pretty good, however, could use a better picture! 90% of culinary field is plate presentation and eye appeal. This has very little of either.

This was absolutely AMAZING. Completely delicious, even my picky husband LOVED it. We had a hard time getting the chicken open enough to stuff (due to our own error) so next time we think we might do a chicken cordon bleu type thing and flatten the breasts out and then roll it around the stuffing. Thanks so much for the recipe!!

Best recipe I've found so far.  I use instant mashed potatoes and mix the extra filling in with those.  Also, ran out of sour cream and used cream cheese & a tbsp of milk--it turned out great & everyone loves it.

Even tho I changed up the breading process, (due to lack of eggs, ha!) I feel the filling is still the mainstay of this dish and it was fabulous! Tyler, my youngest daughter isn't the biggest cheese foodie, yet she gave this a five star rating. Again, it was only the breading that I changed out in that I used fresh bread crumbs to which I added tons of garlic, onion powder, black pepper and parm. I dipped the chicken into melted butter, coated with the crumbs, placed in a casserole dish  drizzled the remaining butter and baked. Wonderful dish Danielle and thank you so very much!

This was an incredible dish! The house smelled like a restaurant, looked like one too with this on the plate.  I used feta that already came with garlic and herbs and I only used half of an onion in the masked potatoes.  It may take a little time to prepare but so worth it.  This is a great dish for company you want to impress!

All 4 of my kids LOVED this! That rarely occurs... I made some changes (mostly by mistake) and it still turned out great. Very forgiving recipe for those of us who don't thoroughly read directions before starting:) I flattened the chicken breasts, then marinaded them in Italian dressing (I was making a different recipe but didn't have all the ingredients). Watch closely when you brown the stuffed breasts in the hot bacon grease, I burned a few but they still tasted great. I had extra filling so rather than make the onion potatoes, I cut the potatoes into thick slices, browned then, then tossed in the extra filling. At first it looked like a mistake, but it all browned nicely and the kids consumed them too. Thanks for a great recipe!

Thanks for the recipe! We loved it as is. The only thing I would do different is stuff my cutlets even more. BTW...because I'm lazy, I added onions, sour cream, etc., to instant potatoes and even those were fabulous! Thanks again.

Turned out well , although i tweaked a little for my tastes. I added minced pepperoni and made sure the Feta cheese was crumbled really well to begin with into the mix. I also made a light white wine garlic cream sauce to enhance the presentation.

I will definitely make this again. It was wonderful! I did substitute fresh oregano for the dried and would add a dab of cream cheese next time to add a little more moisture to the filling mix.

I haven't cooked this yet.  You can be sure it's one of the next things I cook, because it sounds so great and decadent. And filling.  I usually don't like or use chicken breast, so I may buy some thin-sliced breast, or pound it until it's paper thin.   To those naysayers out there, please keep your negative comments to yourself or go to the low-calorie section.  When I make it, (I can already taste it) I'm going to make it exactly as written (except I'll add more oregano as one reviewer suggested) and rate it for myself.

awesome receipe, the only thing I did different was the patotoes I sautéed them with onions and green beans and a little bit of bacon on the stove. I did add fresh garlic and fresh dried red pepper flakes to the stuffing for the chicken but everything else stayed the same.

Loved the flavor combinations. I never have luck with stuffed chicken, so I filleted, breaded, and seared the chicken first, then piled the filling on top of each piece, covered, and baked. I also added two minced cloves of fresh garlic and a cup of mozzarella cheese to the mix. Served it with brown rice and peas to make up for the extra calories. Everyone loved it!

Came out delicious. Chicken was moist and stuffing was really good. It was a lot of prep, but worth it. I will probably make this again, but it won't be on a regular rotation.

This was delicious and yummy. My family loved it.  I poured a little bit of leftover bacon grease over the top of the chicken when it was baking.i only had to bake for 25 minutes, my chicken breast were not super thick, the cheese was great tasting and bubbly. I would not change a thing.

I subtracted the bacon and served this with a romaine and orange(sprinkled with cinnamon) salad; using fresh squeezed orange juice as the salad dressing. It was delicious and much healthier.

Made it as the recipe states exactly.  Very good recipe that everyone enjoyed.  Be cautious of over-stuffing the chicken, however.  The stuffing is a bit rich.  Thanks for sharing!

This was a great dinner!!!! Yes, it has too much fat but i'm rating based on how good it was NOT on how much fat is in it. I don't like it when people give bad ratings because something has too much fat.

I made this recipe as written except for the oregano.  My husband said it was definately a keeper!  Very rich and not a diet food.  I would make this again and would do it exactly the same.  The potatoes were perfect with this dish.  I will make the potatoes with other dishes and might add some kind of cheese.

This dish taste like something i would order in an italian resturant.  It has to be the best stuffed chicken recipe i've come across. My only suggestion wouild be to substitute italian bread crumbs for dry ones.

Excellent flavor and very filling! I used the stuffing to stuff 6 chicken breast halves instead of 3, and there was plenty of stuffing. I used Progresso Italian style bread crumbs and tomato basil feta--this gave it a lot of flavor.  I had increased the oregano like someone suggested, but with the flavored bread crumbs and feta, it was a bit too strong.  Next time I'll use plain feta cheese and just up the oregano a bit.   I might try adding tomatoes or bell peppers too.

Made this recipe as directed for the chicken. It was totally delicious and loved by all members of my family. Definitely a keeper. I used the Simply Potatoes brand of mashed potatoes. I had a small amount of the bacon, feta cheese mix left over and added that along with the cooked onions (which I diced very small before cooking) to the cooked  potatoes. I did not add any more sour cream. Wow! is all I can say. Outstanding.

I haven't tried this yet, but I did save it and will try it later.  Can't see how anyone could say it dosn't look good.  I thought it looked real good!  You can't worry about every calorie because if you did you would go crazy.  Everything in moderation!!

This was absolutely wonderful! I didn't have sour cream for the chicken mixture so I used plain yogurt instead and it tasted fine. It was the first time that I "stuffed" chicken and it turned out very pretty!

I liked this recipe, but my husband thought there was way too much feta cheese in it, which overpowered everything else.  I might try this again, using 1/2 of the feta cheese.  It was easy to make though, and if you like feta, you'll love this recipe!

Loved the chicken...husband and kids had seconds.  Didn't chance a thing, though I did not make the potatoes.

This recipe was great! I only tried the part with the chicken, but my husband and I loved it. For my taste I might put a little less Feta in it, but my husband thought that no change was needed.

This is super super good and probably would have been better as written... But I changed it a bit to cut back on the fat! I used a bit less bacon, and fat free sour cream. I wet the chicken breast and coated it in italian bread crumbs. Then I stuffed the breasts and popped them into the oven. At the end of the cooking, I sprayed it with some olive oil to brown a bit. I served it with a cold corn, tomato, onion salad. It was a great balance to the heavy delicious chicken.

Amazing!  I used garlic and herb flavored feta for an extra kick in the chicken, and it turned out delicious.  There was a bit of the feta/bacon mixture left over from stuffing the chicken breasts, which I crumbled on top of some spinach leaves for a complementary salad.  Great recipe!

DELIZIOSO! we made this tonight for our family&got rave reviews! we modified it a little bit. we used turkey bacon, instead of regular bacon. and we didn't have sour cream, so we used plain yogurt instead. also, we stuffed the breasts after we seared it, out of fear of having stuffing come out of the chicken. in general..yum. enjoy.
