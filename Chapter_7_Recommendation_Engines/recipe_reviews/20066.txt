I absolutely LOVE this bread recipe.  I found it a year ago and never used another one since.  I personally like to take the bread out 5 minutes before and brush melted butter on the top and let it finish the lasr 5 minutes of cooking.  Thanks for this wonderful bread recipe!

This bread turned out wonderfully!  Not too fluffy, but a nice, soft, tasty bread.  I no longer buy my bread from the store, I use this instead!  I substituted margarine for the lard, and it's still great!  It doesn't get stale too quickly either!

This is absolutely terrific!  The bread came out light and fluffy and very tasty.  I did reduce the amount of salt - put in about 2 tsp instead of 1 Tbsp.  

I liked this way more than the 'popular' white bread on this same site.  This is what homemade bread should taste like.

UPDATE:  This is my go-to recipe for white bread.  I have lately started to add about 3/4 to 1 cup of dry milk powder to the recipe for a bit of extra flavor.  This bread is almost fool proof - I highly recommend this recipe!

I cut this recipe in half and let my bread machine to the work thru the 2nd rise. Then took it out and formed dinner rolls for tonight's dinner. Excellent recipe. Just bake dinner rolls for 20 minutes at 375 degrees!Thanks Danialle.

Good bread with a lot of substance.  It would be great to use this with homegrown tomatoes as it will hold up nicely.  I used my kitchen aid with the dough hook & it was a breeze to make, a keeper for me.  Thanks Danialle!

Success!  First try at baking bread went great.  Made a half batch (just halved all ingredients) to make just one loaf, and turned out perfectly.
NOTE: .25 ounce yeast = 2 1/4 tsp yeast
Thanks for sharing Danialle!

The only difference i did with the bread was to use Crisco shortening instead of the lard.  The bread was ok, but it was TOO SALTY.  One tablespoon of salt is just too much.  I might try it again using maybe 1-1/2 tsps of salt.  I will critique it again after i make it with the revised amount of salt.

I found this bread to be fantastic. It's the first one I've made that has turned out properly. Not too sweet like many of the recipes are.

This is the best and easiest recipe I have ever found for a delicious, light white bread. I also substituted soft margarine for the lard and it turned out wonderfully.

Yum! Just got my first very own Kitchen Aid, and this is the first batch of bread I've ever baked - and boy, do I feel like a star! I followed the recipe exactly (with the exception of substituting butter-flavored Crisco in place of the lard), and brushed on a whole-egg egg wash just before baking....wow!  Only having one loaf pan, I rolled up the other half of the dough into rolls and put them side-by-side in my Pyrex dish. The other half (here's where I got creative!), I braided - I really like the look of braided loaves. As mentioned, I brushed everything with egg wash, and baked them together for the exact time listed in the recipe - and it all turned out so beautifully! As I type this, I now have my second batch rising. The changes I'm making to this batch is: adding 1 Tbs cinnamon to dough with other dry ingredients, and then I'm going to braid the loaf as I did the first time, but make each individual braid a cinnamon swirl with melted butter, cinnamon and brown sugar. Wish me luck! PS: the best part of the rolls was that I could eat them fresh out of the oven (for "quality assurance", of course) without damaging my beautiful loaf!

I'm giving this no stars b/c I know the problem lies with the cook (myself) and not the recipe.  Basically, I have 2 loaves of dense, pale, deformed bread in my garbage right now.  I followed the recipe and the instructions TO THE LETTER...and it turned out bad. I have made various types of bread before so I am familar with how to make it and what it should look/feel like throughout various stages but I could use some tips from other reviewers to make this more successful. I even let it rise a little longer during the second time...but I'm not sure what I did wrong. Help? I'll keep checking in for future reviews and possibly give this a second chance... Also - maybe I was supposed to bake it hotter: it says to preheat at 425 but bake at 375 (I baked at the lower temp)

I switched out olive oil for the lard and layered the ingredients in my bread machine.  The loaf was crisp outside and tender inside -- the taste and texture were both wonderful.  (I brushed it with 1 T. of melted butter right after it was done for extra flavor.)  I devoured four big slices before I managed to wrap it up and put it away!  Assuming I can control myself better next time, I will definitely make this again....   :)

I've made many loaves of bread in my day. I wanted a recipe for something lighter and softer, this is it. Very very good!  I have some tips: (1.) I warm my oven (not hot though - check it in a minute or two) to make a proofing box for rising. Then I turn it off and put in covered dough letting it double as directed each time. (2.) Use an electric knife to get good clean cuts for slicing. You can really cut thinner, even slices this way (if desired) helps when you want to eat healthier or for presentations sake. You will need to apply a little pressure to start cutting because the loaf is so soft. (3.) Lastly when bread is cooked and just slightly warm, I wrap in plastic helps to keep a softer crust.  Personal preferences: I'm adding another tb. of sugar next time.  Also I'm cutting the salt to 2 tsps as well.

WATCH OUT FOR THE LAST STEP! I didn't notice the extra step at the bottom. Preheat oven to 425F then lower it to 375F? I ended up baking my bread at 425F for 15mins, before figuring out what I did, and then turned it down to 350F for another 5mins. I was lucky, it actually turned out fine! Maybe next time I'll try baking it at 400F for 20mins. Bread is very soft. Crust is kind of chewy. Turned stale/dry quickly though.

Fantastic Recipe!! I doubled the ingredients to make four loaves.  I used butter flavored Crisco instead of the lard, added three tablespoons of wheat gluten and an additional two tablespoons of sugar.  Wow, what a difference to my second batch!!  This recipe is a keeper!!

This is the exact kind of white bread recipe I've been looking for.  Others on this site are quite good, but this is the type of "everyday", versatile bread I plan on making every week.  Perfect amount of mild sweetness, perfect crust, fluffy interior.  Don't look any further, folks, this one's a keeper!

A wonderful bread! Light and yet strong enough to use for sandwiches and toasts, and with a fine texture, great for runny honey. I used extra light olive oil instead of lard. I didn't have bread flour so I substituted 2 teaspoons per cup of all-purpose flour with gluten flour. Feeling festive, I added a cup of golden currants. I also let the dough rise an extra time for a finer texture. A delicious bread, easy to make, suitable for daily use or special occasions.

This was a very simple, but tasty white bread recipe!  Based on reviews, I've included some tips:   I cut the amount of salt in half, as the recipe amt. seemed like too much.  Make sure your bowl has been warmed up before putting in the water & yeast/sugar mix.  I do this by filling with hot water prior to use.  I also hand whisk the yeast/sugar mixture until disolved before placing it on the stand mixer. Make sure your ingredients are thoroughly mixed before adding more..i.e. adding in the flour.  I made this with a Kitchenaid mixer, and dough hook.  I let it run on speed #2 for 7 minutes once all ingredients were added, in place of hand kneading.  Pre-heat your oven to 425, and place your bowl with the dough in it on top of the oven, as this will insure a warm enough environment for rising.  Often times bread dough doesn't rise because it isn't warm enough in the room.  I prefer to cover my bowl with plastic wrap instead of a wet cloth.  When you punch your dough down, don't overdo it...two or three punches is enough before separating into loaves.  Place the covered loaf pans back onto the top of the oven for good rising results.  During the last 10 minutes of cooking, baste with butter and baste again when removed after cooking.  And just to clear up the oven temp confusion...the oven is preheated to 425, then when you put your bread in to cook, lower it to 375 for the 30 minutes.

This was my first attempt at baking bread from scratch and I will definitely be baking more soon, I wish I never had to eat store bought bread again!  The recipe was super easy to follow and the bread was delicious.  I used half the dough to bake a regular loaf of bread as per the instructions.  I rolled out the other half, sprinkled with a mixture of cinnamon and sugar, rolled and cut into cinnamon buns.  I made a caramel with brown sugar and butter, poured into the bottom of my baking dish and let the bun do their second rise in the dish.  Both the loaf and bread and buns were all gone in 24 hours (I did share!). Soooo good.  My husband keeps asking when I am making more.

This recipe is so versatile. I've made bread, cinnamon rolls, calzones and garlic toast from the bread slices and it's all delicious. Definitely a homemade taste with a hearty texture and I will continue to use this recipe for years to come. Thank you so much for sharing!

My family loves this recipe.  I've made it for several occasions and it always turns out great!  I make it in my bread machine by cutting the recipe in half. I also substituted butter for the lard and increased the flour by 1/3 cup.  I've used the leftover bread for french toast and my husband tells me it's the best he's ever had.

This is the best White Bread recipe I have found on this site - including the Amish and the Country white bread.  I have made about 6 times in the last 2 or so weeks and no problems.
Once I substituted whole wheat for about a third of the white flour and turned out great although next time I would try it more 1/2 and 1/2.  I also make my buns out of this recipe for hamburgs and sloppy joes etc.  I weigh out the dough at about 4 oz per bun (makes a nice larger burger size) and cook about 22 - 25 minutes.  
A great thing about this bread is it doesn't go stale.  I am eating a toasted slice right now that was made 3 days ago and still tastes great.  It also is a bread that slices nicely.  I hate breads that when you go to slice it all scrunches up and you come up with a mis-shapened piece of bread.  Except the time I made with the whole wheat, I follow the recipe exactly.  
Thanks for sharing Danialle!

This was my first attempt at making bread and I was quite pleased with the results. I used butter instead of lard and it worked fine. The bread is nice and crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Perfect for making sandwiches.

I've made this bread 3 times now and each time I change the flavors.  Traditional white, garlic rosemary and garlic parmesean.  Each time it has turned out great.  Definitely will be a go to recipe.  Thanks for the best bread recipe I have.

I've made this many, many times now.  It was my first attempt at break baking and it came out flawless!!  Now I usually braid the bread dough for it's final rise and it comes out not only light and fluffy, but absolutely gorgeous!  It's wonderful for sandwiches and as dinner bread.  Thanks for a great recipe that is easy to follow!

My first attempt at making home made bread, this turned out pretty good!  I did substitute vegetable oil for the lard.

SO PERFECT!  I have made several white bread recipes from this site.  If you want the perfect loaves of bread use this recipe.  I had to sub. butter for lard (did'nt have any lard) and they rose perfect and tasted wonderful.  Great for sandwiches and toast.  Not mushy or crumbly.  It tastes just like my Grandmas white bread.  Finally this is THE recipe I will use from now on. thanks so much for posting it

Excellent! We used butter instead of lard. Easy to work with. Tastes great. I halved the recipe and then rolled the dough out into a long rectangle, spread with real butter, sprinkled with cinnamon sugar, rolled up and baked it that way. Cinnamon swirl bread. It was so good! The bread has a nice consistency. I would also use this bread recipe just for plain bread as it was very good.

I've made this four or five times now, and it has turned out great every time.  I have mostly used butter in place of the lard, but also tried it with coconut oil once and was happy with that loaf as well.  I've also used maple sugar and honey instead of the sugar.  All in all, a great loaf!

This is a very nice white bread. I used butter instead of lard and substituted 1 1/2 cup of the bread flour with whole wheat. Baked one loaf in a shiny metal pan and one in a glass dish to compare. Very little difference other then the loaf in the glass dish browned better on the sides and bottom. Brushed the top with some melted butter about halfway through baking. Great texture - really nice all-purpose sandwich bread.

I've made machine bread for yrs. Now have a KitchenAid.  This bread is very light just like I like.  Not spongy and dense as the other 8 recipes I tried.  It rose beautifully. In fact rose out of my Artisan 5 qt. bowl. Had to push the dough back in. If you like a dense loaf you won't like this one. The other all recipes white bread used egg and it was very dry the next day. If you wish to avoid cholesterol causers, stay away from breads with egg or with lard.  I used Light Tasting Olive Oil in this recipe.   This is PERFECT!
Thank you to the poster.

This is a fantastic white bread recipe. I've tried many white bread recipes and this one is definitely my favorite. It's a great bread when you want the bread to be the star or when you don't. Makes for great toast or sandwich bread.  I like letting the dough rest about 20 minutes before I knead it. I agree with spreading melted butter on the bread- though I do this before I put the loaves in the oven.

Wow!  This is, by far, the BEST bread recipe I've ever come across.  The instructions are fool-proof and the end result is a perfect sandwich bread: not sweet, not dense, not squishy.  I used butter in place of the lard, and I also scored the loaves down the middle with a knife and set some butter in the slit to make split-top loaves.  They seemed to disappear in minutes!  Thank you for such a tasty and easy recipe; I'll never get store-bought bread again!

Best bread recipe I have tried - it has never failed me.  I use Olive oil instead of lard.  I have made this into a whole wheat by using two cups of all purpose whole wheat flour, it also comes out beautifully.  Great Recipe!

This is the best white bread I have ever made. It came out perfectly soft. I used margarine instead of lard and cut back a little on the salt. Next time I'll add a bit of honey for a slightly sweeter bread. Consistency was perfect though. I also rolled the dough out with a rolling pin to get all the bubbles out before the second rise. Rolled the dough into a loaf a placed in pan seam side down.

I used this recipe for sticky buns for breakfast this morning, and baked the other half up as a loaf. I'd just about given up on white bread recipes, because they never seem to maintain the texture we enjoy. This is a wonderful, flavorful recipe I'm grateful to have found. The dough was terrific to work with, too, in my kitchenaid stand mixer. Thanks very much for sharing!

Yes. Traditional white bread. Good flavor. Now if I can just half it equally. I used lard and enough flour to get the dough the correct consistency. I tried oil once. When you taste it side by side, the lard is better. Shortening will work too. You always butter the top.

Wow!  This is the most gorgeous loaf of bread I have ever made!  It smells divine!  I halved the recipe, used butter instead of lard and used my bread machine to make the dough then I baked it in the oven.  The taste is the best I have EVER had out of white bread.  This is my new go to recipe for white bread! Thanks for sharing Danielle!

I use this recipe all the time, but reducing the salt to about 2tsp or so.  Very good and very easy to make.

I have also modified this to include raisins and cinnamon - just right - not too sweet.

This was a great recipe.  I had to actually turn the loaves over so that the bottom could be baked.  At the time given for them to be finished, the top of my loaves were brown, but the bottom was raw..so I turned them over for about 8 minutes.  They taste great!

Wow! This was the easiest bread I have ever made! I only had one loaf pan so made cinnamon rolls with the other half. I put the usual butter/brown sugar/cinnamon on half of the rolls and put dried cherries and chocolate chips on the other half. Just had 2 of them with some coffee and YUM is the verdict!! Oh, I used 1/2c.sugar instead of the 3 T called for and butter in place of the lard. Thanks for such an easy,but good recipe!!!!

I have made this bread 3 times and love it! My 3 yr. old grandson loves it! I make it exactly as the recipe states and it turns out perfect every time! We love to make French toast with this bread. My friend has requested I make it for Thanksgiving. Also I have tried it with butter and with oil(I didn't have any lard), the butter loaves have a darker crust than the oil loaves.

So simple and so good! I made it with 3 TBS of butter versus the lard called for in the recipe and it turned out great. I am going to try it with white wheat flour next time. 
I've seen reviews where people said the bread freezes well but has anyone tried freezing the dough?

First time making bread and this was an easy recipe to follow. I substituted the bread flour with all purpose flour and it still turned out really well.

Looks and tastes just like my moms used to. Just yummy, moist, with a good crunch of the crust.

I never even considered making my own bread until I came across this recipe and read all of the rave reviews and wonderful advice.  I have now made this recipe many many times and have impressed my family and friends.  The only thing I do differently is I use butter flavored Crisco shortening.  Thank you to Danialle for submitting and to  the allrecipe family for all of your great advice!!!

This turned out incredibly well!   It was my first time baking bread, but I just followed the instructions and it turned out perfectly. The bread is moist and has a texture and crust that almost reminds me of fresh French bread, just softer and in a sandwich version. I did brush the loaves with melted butter before putting them in the oven, and brushed with a mix of butter and honey once they came out of the oven because I like the sweetness the honey adds. But it would be wonderful without the honey glaze as well! I will make this recipe again and again.

I love this recipe!  The first time I mixed it by hand, but the second time, I used my Kitchen-Aid stand mixer with my dough hook and turned out great, if not better.  The only thing I did different was use salted butter instead of the lard.  We don't buy bread anymore. Oh, and to store the bread we use tall plastic containers, but, metal would would great too.  If you have never made bread before I'd go to this website to know how to put it in the pans, it helped me:

Other bread recipes I have used made the bread too sweet, and I wasn't about to go and buy a bread maker when I could find a recipe to use without one. I am so glad I stumbled upon this recipe. It tastes just like the homemade bread you have been waiting for. My house smells lovely now. Thank you so much! Saved for life!

I misread the recipe and only used 1 tsp of salt. My loaves rose quite quickly as a result. I used butter instead of lard. Very good bread.

Very Good!  We used one third each of all purpose, wheat, and bread flour.  Also substituted butter for the lard.  Halved the recipe.  My 5-year-old loved the bread and the learning process!

Most delicious! Best bread recipe yet! I even use this recipe for garlic bread sticks! I substitute garlic salt for the regular salt, olive oil for the lard and oil and brush with a mix of salted butter and garlic powder. This is the recipe to use! Perfect every time and also works in bread machines!

Wished I could rate this higher. I made this bread yesterday and WOW. I made bread in the past and it always turned out dry and dense. This recipe came out moist and perfect and very tasty. My daughter couldn't wait for it to cool. As soon as I cut the loaves she right away grabbed the end parts and slathered them with butter. I made toast out of a slice this morning and I must say, YUM! Thank you for this great recipe!

I would give this recipe ten stars if I could.     I have made this bread quite a few times (exactly as written, only substituting in the butter instead of the lard) and it always gets excellent reviews from the entire family. I just dug this recipe out again and finished baking my first batch an hour ago. This time, I was out of active dry yeast so I used bread machine yeast instead. Because bread machine yeast cannot proof I mixed the dry ingredients first before adding the water and butter. I also decided to try multigrain flour this time and, despite the changes, both loaves turned out beautifully. Thank you for such a great recipe!

This recipe really worked for me as I have not had much success making bread in the past. My only problem was my crust was hard. The next time I make this recipe I will brush butter on top to help make the crust less hard. Other than that, the bread came out just right and was very tasty straight from the oven. My 3 year old wanted to keep eating it! Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

This bread is a good solid white bread and I've used it to make several types; it's easy to modify this bread. I've made cinnamon swirl with raisin, jalapeno cheddar as well sundried tomato & basil. Also, rolls turn out fantastic as well

I've made this bread twice using unbleached all-purpose flour and oil instead of bread flour and lard...happy to report that it's still amazing!  So easy and so very delicious.  The bread tastes great fresh and makes perfect, crunchy toast.

This was my 1st attempt at making bread and I will definitely be making this again.  I have always been so intimidated at the idea of homemade bread, but this was super easy.  The only I changed was the amount of salt as 1 Tbsp just seemed like it would be way too much, so I cut it back to 2 tsp.

So good.  I am making it instead of buying bread.  I did have to add just a bit more water each time I made it, but that was all.

Successfully halved the recipe; used the bread machine to prep the dough and then shaped it for the loaf pan. Still working on my shaping technique, but that's my ineptitude, no fault of the recipe. Very yummy!

Terriifc.. This a perfect recipe for beginners without a bread machine or even bread flour. This was my first successful loaf of white bread. Very simple recipe, no need for a bread machine!
 The loaf came out as promised, soft and fluffy center with a crunchy crust. I cut the ingredients in half to yield one loaf and substituted butter instead of lard and all purpose flour instead of bread flour and still very happy with the results.. also, before the last 2-3 minutes, I brushed the loaf with some butter. This recipe gives the satisfaction of being a little less dependent on store bought stuff.

Absolutely awesome.  I live on an island in Panama, Central America and food is not as easy to come by, let alone fresh...I don't have a breadmaker or bread flour..just regular flour, so it took a while to find this recipe.  I've used it twice and it has turned out way better than expected each time.  I don't even mind the little extra work it takes...makes it all the more rewarding. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!

I really liked the taste of this bread. It reminds me of the Amish white bread from this site, but a tad more dense and little less sweet tasting. The recipe said that using butter or veg. oil was okay. I went for butter with canola oil. I mixed and kneaded the ingredients, on low, in the Kitchen-Aid no problem. The only thing I would do different is to increase the second rise time, to 1 hour, as I would have liked the loaves just a little taller. It does make the best bread for sandwiches, though, of all the bread recipes I have tried. Thank you, I will make this again.

I don't buy store bread anymore. This makes a great sandwich bread. The only change I made was replaced the 3 tbls of lard with 4 tbls of butter.  Gread bread!

I thought this bread came out great. Every time i Have made bread it has come out kind of dense, but not this one! I halfed the recipe but next time I think i will do the whole thing. I also added a tablespoon of flax meal to the flour and salt before mixing and substituted half oil, half butter for the lard. Definetly a keeper.

I have been baking bread for years now and this is the best bread recipe I have found. I added a cup and a half of whole wheat four and it was great  It really does not dry out fast like other bread I have made in the past. Definitely a keeper. Thanks so much!

This was my second attempt at making brerad.  The first try was quite a failure.  I ended up with flat and heavy bricks instead of soft and airy loafs.  I used another recipe the first time.  After reading more to find out what I did wrong, and reading all the reviews and comments I felt good enough to try again.  I ended up with wonderful soft, delicious bread that I could be proud of.  I will continue to use this recipe and maybe try some whole wheat and honey next time.  Thanks for the recipe and all the comments that helped me learn and grow as a baker!

Incredibly easy to make, pretty fool-proof. The loaves turned out beautiful (except for the fist print that my one year old decided to leave in the dough while it was rising!) In my oven I only had to bake for twenty minutes. Any longer and it would have been hard. The only thing that I didn't like about it is the yeast taste is a little more pronounced that I like. I usually never eat white bread, so maybe that is the issue.

OH MY!  I haven't made home made bread in years and finally decided it was time to start it up again.  This is the first recipe that stood out to me and I knew I had to try it.  I didn't have lard on hand so I used butter instead, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  This is such a wonderful recipe and makes the house smell awesome.  The Hubby and Kids are LOVING it!  Will make again and again.  Thanks so much for sharing!

I am usually the one who makes the bread in our hosue but since I've been busy lately, my husband decided to try his hand at it.  This bread turned out so perfect that he has decided maybe he should be the one to make the bread from now on!  This has definitely been added to my recipe box and will be my white bread recipe from now on!

I absolutely hate making bread... It usually turns out horrible and since I don't have a bread machine or kitchen aid it's all by hand. So the only reason I find myself kneading is to stop the begging and pleading from my boyfriend for homemade bread. So I picked this recipe because I had no milk/dry milk, and it turned out so nicely. I used one half of the batch to make garlic rolls... Which was just rolling out the dough after the first rise and spreading a minced garlic/butter mixture and rolling it up like cinnamon rolls except sealing the ends. They baked for a little longer than the loaf and were delicious with our chicken pasta dish. This recipe is great and so versatile, it will be my bread recipe for life:).

I used vegetable oil in this recipe and it was fine. I used my stand mixer with dough hook for mixing and kneading. I made one plane loaf, and since this is such a great basic recipe, I made another with chopped dill and poppy seeds, and then another with extra sugar and cinnamon. So simple and such a versatile recipe.

This is a wonderful bread. I havent ever made  bread before. I printed 3 white bread recipes out and tried this one first. My husband & I both agreed that it could not be improved on. The only thing I did different was i used butter flavored Crisco. I have made this for a couple of older friends and they also love this. I havent even tried the others. We no longer buy bread. Thank You.

It has probably been 20 years since I made bread by hand (meaning without my KitchenAid or a breadmaker). I wanted some good bread for grilled cheese sandwiches, so I tried this recipe. It was SO good and SO easy! I didn't have lard, but I did have 2 TBS of shortening and 1 TBS butter, so I used that instead. I'll definitely be making it again, especially considering how easy it was.

I used to make bread every Sunday when I was 9-10 years old and then lost the recipe that I used.  Since finding this one I really enjoy making bread again.  This is an easy and very tasty recipe.

I used whole wheat flour, instead of white, and it was so amazingly delicious!  I am never going back to store bought bread!

I LOVE this recipe! I literally do not buy white bread anymore, I think it's a waste of money after eating this bread! The only change I made was to use butter instead of lard, I like the flavor and texture much better. And then I'm not using lard, either. I make it every weekend and the two loaves last my boyfriend an I until the end of the week, but only if we don't share, otherwise it's gone by the end of the day! The crust is delicious, it always turns out just right.   Try this bread, you'll love it too!

I made this bread last night and it turned out great. I used butter instead of lard, and all-purpose flour instead of bread flour, but I had no problems at all, and the taste is awesome. All in all this recipe is very easy to make and the taste lives up to the expectation.

My first time baking bread and I found this recipe so easy, thank you so much!
I found it to be quite a heavy bread(which I like) rather than light and fluffy. Not sure if that was the recipe or me?! Loved it and will make again and again I am sure!

As the worst cook in the world, I can say that this recipe is easy and comes out great.  I used olive oil instead of lard or butter, and made them into bread rolls.  If I can do it, anyone can!

HA! After trying countless white bread recipes, I think your bread is so far, my favorite off of Allrecipes.com. I did use butter instead of the lard. It was fluffy and fragrant (the buttery smell was heavenly) and soft. It got a little weird after a week or so in a plastic ziplock bag, so i think since i dont eat THAT much bread, ill just make one loaf at a time. Great recipe. thank you :)

This recipe made me want to try baking a loaf of bread, so I did.  Unfortunately, the bread seemed to not cook on the inside.  The outside was nice and crunchy but the inside looked raw....  I don't know where I went wrong.  It's my first attempt, so I will look and compare another recipe next time.

This was fantastic. Just the epitome of great sandwich bread! I've made his recipe about four times and I have three tips. First, combine the yeast, sugar, and water in the mixing bowl and give it about 5 minutes until bubbles start to show. That way the yeast are active when the flour and salt and oil are added. Second, don't miss the temperature decrease. Preheat to 425 only-- then lower it to 375 before adding to the oven. Third-- coat the top with butter or oil before tossing it in the oven. It will keep the top nice and moist so you get a nice crown without slashing, and toward the end it browns up very nicely. Definitely a keeper

OH MY. This is the best bread I've ever made and trust me, I've made a lot. Normally my breads are a bit dense with a chewy doughy texture. I have been baking bread tons to figure out how to get it light and airy. I finally figured out, I used too much flour. This recipe, I used 6 cups of flour, and some more for dusting. I also used vegetable oil instead of lard and it turned out fine. I also used the amount of salt stated in the recipe, and despite many reviews, it wasn't too salty. I am so pleased and proud of this bread!!!

Tip: use 1/2 cup of water to dissolve the sugar and yeast.  Then replace the other two cups with 2 eggs and milk.

I've been making my own bread for ages, and I usually make potato bread. I wanted to try a nice white bread, though, to make in my new Pullman pans. This was a great recipe to try out. The bread is soft and fluffy, and the crumb is absolutely strong enough to hold up against spreads, meats, etc., for sandwiches.

I did make a few changes. First because others had mentioned it was salty, I reduced the salt by 1/2. I used butter for the fat. And because I think it helps make a fluffy but firm crumb, I replaced 1/2 cup of the flour with 1/2 cup of potato starch.

I got two gorgeous loaves out of this!

This was a very easy recipe to make.  The dough had a great texture and once baked was nice and fluffy with just a touch of density.  My only hang up was it tasted a bit doughy and yeasty for my liking.   The second time I made this is used about 1/8 less  yeast, I use crisco in place of lard and I let the dough rise for about 2 hours then gently push it separate and rise another 1.5 hours.  No more awkward yeasty doughy taste.

This is an excellent recipe. For a more whole wheat bread I use 4c of bread flour and 2-1/2 c of whole grain wheat flour. I've also made a more gluten friendly kinda  version with 3c of bread flour and 3-1/2 c of gluten free all purpose flour.

It was white bread.  It was easy.  Good for a beginner, like me.  I reduced the salt as some had recommended, but I would probably put the indicated amount it next time.  I would make it again, but it is very basic.

Best. Bread. EVER.  After reading all of the rave reviews last night, I could hardly wait to make this today.  I have made bread before, (GOOD bread, too) but never as good as this recipe.  As others pointed out - it is so versatile.  I divided the dough in half and made one loaf of bread and some hamburger buns.  This recipe makes so much bread, however, you could easily get 3 loaves out of this.  The loaf I made was HUGE and the buns were equally huge - now I am wishing I had planned hamburgers for supper tonight :)  I think the key to baking this is preheating the oven to 425 and then reducing it to 375 to bake (and brushing it with melted butter).  I have never had bread turn out so golden brown on the outside (just like the bakery!) and the best softest texture on the inside.  Once my family got a smell of the bread baking, it didn't stand a chance.  Hoping to save out one or two buns just to see how it is the next day.  This recipe has set the bar high for sure, I don't think anyone will be happy to return to store-bought bread (including myself), I guess I have my work cut out for me!  And I have lots of plans for this recipe - caramel rolls, cinnamon bread, breadsticks, hotdog buns, dinner rolls, croutons, bread crumbs, etc.

Doesn't need any changing. I didn't end up using the entire 6 1/2 cups of flour, but it was still delicious.

I live in Colorado and have always had a hard time getting bread to actually turn out. This recipe worked great, I used my kitchen aid to mix all the ingredients, etc. it turned out perfect, it's not sweet like some recipe, I brushed it with melted butter about 10 minutes prior to it finishing baking.

I love how the crust is slightly crunchy and the middle is light and moist. This is my favorite bread recipe!

This was my second time attempting to make bread. The 1st time with a different recipe was a flop. This recipe was easy, and turned out perfect. I used half the dough for bread, and the other half for large buns.

I followed the recipe just as it is.  It turned out great! This is a great recipe for anyone, but especially for someone who may just be getting started baking their own bread.

I've made this twice now, exactly as the recipe is written. It is the best white bread I've ever made, and my husband agrees. I disagree with those that decreased salt. I think it's perfect.

I'm fairly new to bread making, I followed the recipe to the tee  except I made four smaller loaves.  It was AMAZING, I delivered a loaf to each of my two daughter-in loves( while it was still warm) and they thought the same. I will be making this now probably every other day, easy and so much better than store bought!  Thank-you for the blessing!

First time making this recipe...everything went well except the rising of the dough... upon doing some investigation I realized that the yeast needs a warm environment to rise... as it is winter and the house is below 70 degrees the bread did not rise well at all.... still taste good... just kind of thick and flatter than I would have liked.....

I've been baking and cooking most of my life but I was always intimidated by making dough's. They just never seemed to turn out right. This recipe was easy and came out with perfect loaves. I make it all the time and even make it for friends for a treat. I have also used this recipe to make dinner buns and they are awesome.

I have used this recipe many times and it works!
I made it for Easter Dinner and since it I use crisco for the "lard", I made one vegan a very happy person!
Today I made 4 dozen dinner rolls (2 batches) for my daughters 5th grade Christmas Feast. I will be making another 4 dozen for Chriatmas eve dinner with my family! 
Great recipe!

Quick and simple.  I add an egg, 1/4 cup buttermilk and use 2 tbsp lard, 2 tbsp butter.  Also, I prime my yeast by adding a tablespoon of molasses to the water after I have warmed it, then add the yeast.

I halved this recipe and used it to make bierocks.  The texture was soft and moist but I also really liked the flavor.  I did use King Arthur flour and substituted Crisco for the lard.   Turned out great.

I have made thousands of loaves of bread when I worked in my fathers grocery store. There we had the luxury of a proof box to  rise your dough and to keep it from drying out. I came up with my own version on how to do this at home. I use a cooler and just put in about an inch or 2 of hot water set my bowl of dough in it and put on the cover .WALLAA instant proof box ! Once I pan my dough I use a wire cooling rack in  the cooler to keep the pans out of the water.  Using this cuts your raising time greatly !

It was really good!  We made it in a kitchen-aid and used butter instead of oil to grease the pans and bowl . Some said it was too salty but 1 tbsp split between two loaves is really not that much, and you don't taste it at all. We also used all purpose flour instead of bread flour and it turned out perfectly fine. Will definitely be making this again!

Recipe was easy to follow, and turned out perfectly.

In my first batch, i also beat 1 egg and brushed it lightly on both loaves after they rose in the pan, immediately prior to baking.  They came out beautifully crisp and browned on top.

For my second batch, i used 3 1/2 cups of all purpose flour, and 3 cups of bread flour, and got a great light and flavorful sandwich bread.

I didn't use bread flour which I think made this bread a little more dense then I had hoped it would be. Still: very nice, simple recipe! Gave a loaf to a friend and he said is was very nice. Will probably try again will bread flour instead of all purpose.

I am a bread making newbie.  No machines, just using my hands.  I tried several recipes, they were ok.  Then I found this recipe.  OMG, we just love it.  The recipe makes 3 loaves and it is gone in no time at all.  I love this recipe, this will be my go to recipe.  Made no changes whatsoever.  Does not need any changing.  Thank you for sharing this.

*HIGH ALTITUDE ADJUSTMENTS* This is a good, basic white bread recipe that is hard to mess up and will probably be fine no matter your technique.  I have made it as written, but I live at about 5000 ft above sea level so recipe as-written produces an uneven bread without fine texture because it rises too much and too fast.  After lots of experimenting, here are the alterations I find produce the best result at my altitude: use vegetable oil instead of lard; reduce yeast to about 3.75 tsp; use bread flour; let rise twice in the bowl and in the refrigerator (so you have 3 rises total- rise in bowl in fridge, punch down and reform to a smooth ball, rise in bowl in fridge, punch down, form loaves and rise in pans at room temperature); bake when the loaves rise about 1/2 inch above edge of pans (instead of doubled); after preheating oven, reduce to 400 degrees and bake for 23-27 minutes. If you like a little extra moisture, add 1/2 cup of prepared mashed potatoes to water/sugar/yeast mixture before adding flour in step 1. Follow all other instructions as written.

Made 1/2 the recipe tonight.  

Changes:  used coconut oil instead of lard

ADDITIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS:  Use melted butter to coat the bread when it comes out.

Other RECOMMENDATIONS:  Make sure the bread is around 190º when you're done baking or somewhat near 190º (mine was 188º) to make sure the inside is done.

I used a CONVECTION OVEN for this, and lowered the temp to 250º after I took it out a couple of times, after it baked for 20 mins., to make sure it was done.  It did take over the 30 min time, but well worth it.

Other recommendations:  continue to SPRAY THE DOUGH in the oven with water to make sure it stays moist.

REVIEW:  Best white bread I've ever made.  Tasty, moist, perfect accompaniment to any kind of cheese, I used Tallegio on top of this.  It was a great choice, and I'm so pleased that it came out so well.  

FLOUR USED:  CENTRAL MILLING (company) ORGANIC ARTISAN BAKERS CRAFT PLUS MALTED, which is essentially bread flour, but a high end one.

EQUIPMENT USED:  Food processor.  I only kneaded it 4x (one each way) after it had risen for 1.5 hours the first time & then rolled it and tucked the ends under & put it in a 9.5" pan that was pre-oiled with coconut oil.

Adding:  I let it autolyse for 15-30 mins before rising.

i was hankering a nice piece of toast made out of homemade bread and was searching for a quick and easy recipe, and this is what i found...wow...so easy, and very very good tasting. This is exactly what i was looking for. I will be making this a lot in the future instead of buying it in a store. i substituted the lard with coconut oil since i had no lard on hand. seemed to work fine. bread is nice and light and fluffy in texture, and is just out of this world.

I made bread for the first time ever today with this recipe. I was always too nervous to try to made bread. But I decided today was the day and came across this recipe. I am so glad I chose this one. The bread is so good. Crunchy crust, soft inside. Great taste. I had bread for supper, warm with butter. This will be the only recipe I will ever use for bread I believe.

I nice basic recipe. This is very much like my Grandma’s bread. With twelve kids she always made 6-12 loaves at a time. I subbed butter for lard as I don’t buy lard. I have also used any cooking oil availability. Always good. Its hard to get bread in China so I make my own.

This is THE perfect traditional bread recipe.  I followed exactly as posted (using butter).  It was very easy to make using a dough hook on my Kitchen Aid.  (You can certainy do it by hand;  it will be just as good.)

I have been making bread for many years using a recipe from my mother-in-law, which is good, but this is better.  

I found the salt quantity perfect.  The sugar quantity was also perfect.  Did not taste sweet.

Tips:  
1.  Use plastic wrap to loosely cover dough when rising instead of a damp towel.  (Easier clean up, and works beautifully).

2.  If using bulk yeast (such as you buy from Costco), use 1 1/2 Tablespoons.

3.  Place bowl in microwave during rising.  Keeps the drafts away.

4.  I used flour I purchased from Costco that I always have on hand (I think it comes in a 20 lb. bag).  It's the one that says it's good for bread, pastries, etc.  Very economical.

5.  For those of you who live at a high elevation, you don't need to make any changes.  I live at 7200 feet above sea level.

I have tried and failed at bread baking several times. Now that my diet requires me to avoid most of the commercially processed foods, I spent an hour poring over the basics in All Recipes. I finally joined A|R after using this recipe, just so I could share my compliments. This is an awesome bread. Freezes well for French toast (you'll want to eat the fresh baked in 2-3 days, as it may spoil quickly). Thanks kindly for a wholesome, simple recipe that isn't the typical bread machine "Add ingredients according to the manual and turn the machine on" variety!

So happy I found this again. I lost my bookmarks from my phone a while back, and my homemade bread has suffered since.

I am vegan, and have replaced the lard with coconut oil, earth balance, shortening, even olive oil, and it has come out amazing every time.

I used half the recipe and still made two small loaves. I used margarine instead of lard. Oven temp and time was spot-on for my oven. Top is crusty; inside is soft! I froze the second loaf, but had to thaw it the next day. Really good plain white bread!

4.35 stars. I really liked it. The instructions are not clear. I preheated oven to 425F, then put the unbaked bund inside oven, then changed the Temperature setting to 375F. And baked for about 30 minutes. It turned out just nice and it smelled really good. It was a bit hard to cut in slices because the slices have to be handled delicately for the slices to hold together in a nice slice shape. But my second bund is in the oven right now so, it wasn't that bad if I am doing this again. But could somebody comment on what the temperature is. The recipe calls for preheating at 425, then baking at 375 which doesn't make any sense.

Oh. And I changed the amounts of sugar and salt. I only used 2 tespons of salt (for the two bunds) and 4 teaspoons of sugar.

An easy, fun bread to make with almost foolproof results. However, if you cut the recipe in half as I did (no need for 2 loaves), cut way back on both the sugar and salt. This amount might be okay for two loaves, but not for one. I used 3 teaspoons of sugar and 1-1/2 teaspoons of salt. Ideal.

I tried this recipe and it turned out wonderful! I changed some things...I used all purpose flour and I only put in 1/2 a tablespoon of salt in. I also replaced the lard with salted butter.

I make one or two loaves every week. This is so easy to make with a kitchenaid mixer with a dough hook. We don't buy bread from the store anymore. Excellent recipe!

I decided that instead of doing my typical honey wheat by feel this week, I would go with a classic white and looked up a recipe. I swapped lard for coconut oil. It smelled delicious in the oven.  The taste was something salty and I'm entirely sure that is because I usually go for the healthier whole grain numbers and use less salt.  I'll deal with what I got.

This is now my go-to recipe for a never fail homemade bread.  I've used combinations of wholewheat, multigrain flours taking  the place of up to half of the white flour.  It may be my oven but I usually rotate half way through  and remove at about the 23 - 25 minute mark.

I tried this because I couldn't find the recipe I normally use, I won't be going back. This is so simple, no changes are needed except to watch the amount of flour. I just used 6 cups, I didn't need the other half cup. I also used traditional yeast and proofed it before adding it - just personal preference. The bread was so light and has a great texture. I just baked the one loaf, I put the other half of the dough into the freezer for the next time I need fresh bread or buns.

This was much easier and turned out much better than the first bread recipe I tried here. The only thing I will change the next time I make this is a little less salt. I didn't add a full tablespoon this time, but the salt still really stands out to me so maybe just a teaspoon and a half next time. Makes great toast for my breakfast in the mornings.

OMG  This tasted just like bread I would buy from a professional bakery, except warm and just out of the oven!  The (slight) changes I made:  Only made half of this recipe, used "sugar in the raw" instead of white sugar, used cisco shortening instead of lard, made rolls instead of loaves so i only had to bake for 20 min.  Texture and taste wow!  Everything was spot on.  Who knew bread was so simple to make?  The only change I'll make next time is to use butter instead of shortening.  It actually tasted too much like professional bread and i want to give it that homestyle buttery taste.

I have a KitchenAid with a dough hook.  I basically used this recipe except I substituted 1/2 cup milk for 1/2 cup of the water, and used butter instead of lard.  I used 2 Tbsp of dry yeast, and put the yeast and sugar in the mixing bowl.  Then put the milk, water and butter in a large measuring cup and heated in the microwave for 2 min, and added that to the mixing bowl with the salt.  Then I added 5 cups of flour, 1/2 cup at a time until well mixed.  Then I replaced the mixer beater with the dough hook and added the final flour a little at a time until it reached the right consistency.  Once the dough hook finished its job and the dough was one smooth ball with little residue on the side of the bowl, I covered it and let it rise, shaped into loaves for second rise, then baked at 375 for 30 min.  It is perfect!

The bread turned out quite tasty. In fact I think the two of us ate half of it before it had time to cool.  I used my stand up kitchen aid mixer with the bread hook after stirring in the first two cups of flour. I recommend using the proof setting on your oven if you have one. But be careful when you take the towel off the loaves in the pan, after the second rise. I lost some height As the pans were too close together and when I separated them, they fell a bit. Oh I did reduce the salt by half after readin other peoples post.
The recipe was easy enough to make.I have to give it four stars though because there seems to be a step missing, I didn't understand how long  the bread should bake at 425? Or do i just turn the oven down when i put the loaves in? This was confusing to me since I have never made this type of bread before. Thanks for the recipe, I will definitely be trying this again.

I found the bread to taste too yeasty and even after through baking all the bread inside (not the outer crust) was too soft and doughy. I think if I try again I will add less water and yeast.  I also added less salt than what the recipe called for due to the many comments saying the 1 tablespoon was too much so I  changed it to 3/4 of a tablespoon instead. Next time I will do half a tablespoon.

The bread came out very good texture-wise.  I used kosher salt in hopes that it wouldn't be too salty, but it turns out needed more salt.  I should have used regular salt. I did use the amount of salt the recipe calls for.  And the amount of flour used depends on the humidity in your kitchen.  You might need more or less than what the recipe calls for.

Just took two loaves out of the oven and one is nearly gone!  I bake most of the bread we use and decided to try this recipe because of the reviews and how easy it appeared.  It lives up to the promises: a nice crispy crust and tender but sturdy crumb.  I can't wait to see how it tastes toasted.

I had a recipe I used last year but I misplaced it which was actually a great thing. I came across this recipe and tried it. I've made it a few times now.  I really like the texture of the dough. I've made plain as the recipe calls for and another time I stretched it flat and added brown sugar, raisins and pecans. I then rolled it up like a jelly roll, let it rise and baked it. There are all kinds of things you can do with it. This recipe's a keeper. I printed it out so I won't lose it ! ??

This was exactly what I was looking for! Like a lot of other users, I added vegetable oil instead of lard and cut back just a pinch on the salt. The texture is perfect for toast, sandwiches, grilled cheese, etc and it was ready in very little time. I decided to free-form the loaves, I prefer the rustic look of them. Be careful if you decide to go this route, the loaves rose so well they almost took over the baking sheet and each other! I love making more involved, time-consuming breads, but sometimes you just want a loaf of white bread in the house. I'll be making this weekly.

Finally a perfect bread recipe! I just started baking all of my bread at home and failed with at least 5 different recipes that just wouldn't work even with perfectly proofed yeast but then I stumbled upon this heavenly recipe and now am in love. The bread has a nice crust and buttery flavor. This is now my go-to bread and I plan on baking this weekly. 

P.S. This bread is highly addictive!

I made this with excellent results, the only thing I would do different next time is soften the lard more than I did, I had to work a little harder to get it blended.  The taste is perfect, I'll try to make this every week for my lunches at work

Great taste. Good white bread. I made it with all purpose flour and brushed the top with butter after I took it out of the oven. I will make this often.

Good recipe...I use vegetable shortening instead of lard and half the amount of salt...Everytime I make this bread, it goes so fast. I have to make double the loaves :) Easy to make bread, especailly for those of us first time breadmakers! NO need for a bread machine!

This bread is SO yummy! 
My fiancee and I are both celiac, so I replaced the bread flour with gluten free flour. It worked perfectly! We also used butter instead of lard, and the recipe still turned out perfectly.

Great recipe and I made it two ways. In a loaf pan, then to see how this dough freezes I froze/thawed the other half and made the next day.It passed with flying colors, some don't. But I made that loaf artisan style because I love a thicker crust with carunch. Simply gently stretched and cupped in my hands to form it into a ball, proofed, then placed it in a preheated Dutch oven at 500f for 30 min then remove the lid and mist w/water and let it go until I get the color I like. It's a moist dough with oil so no danger of drying it.
I also used olive oil. Not just any olive oil, Frantoia which I buy at Amazon. The last olive you'll ever buy once you taste it. Delicate and nutty, fruity and will pass the sip test for sure. A "peppery finish" is code for poor quality oil that they want to charge an arm and a leg for. It's actually a serious money racket. I buy a litre for $20.00 which is cheaper than anything else on the shelf but it comes in other sizes too.
I will hold onto this recipe for sure. Wonderful crumb and perfect partner for my last batch of apple butter! I'm sending a photo of the round loaf which I cut so you can see how thick and brown the crust is yet the inside is wonderful, light and very moist.

This has become my go to recipe for white bread.  It comes out consistant every time, has great flavor and easy enough for my kids to make.  I have already made 2 loaves this morning with another 2 rising.  These are going to be for Thanksgiving stuffing....so much better than store bought!

I substituted butter for the lard, and halved the recipe to make only one loaf. It turned out very nicely--a soft and fluffy traditional white bread, which is perfect for sandwiches. This is a very easy bread to make, and would recommend it to anyone who isn't experienced in bread baking.

My 10-year-old wanted to make bread.  We did a quick search and he chose this recipe.  I didn't help him at all!  He did it all by himself, just like he wanted, and it turned out perfect! :D I'm quite proud. :)

Fantastic! Tonight's the first time in my life I ever tried to make bread, and this came out perfectly. My wife was actually on her way to bed when I asked her to try it; she ended up eating 3 slices with butter and jam. Wonderful!

Super good bread; light inside and crispy outside.  HOWEVER, I have never used a tablespoon of salt...I use a mounded teaspoon and it's plenty. I also brush the top with melted butter. Very easy recipe, and pretty quick.

This is an easy recipe. It will give you a nice crust and fluffy center. I find that letting it rise for two hours instead of one works better. The video was a big help for this beginner, too.

I have made this several times. It is easy and comes out light and delicious. I use my kitchen Aide mixer and it is so easy. I bake on a stone baking sheet. Maybe that's why it is so good. Sometimes I add spices like rosemary or dill. It keeps for several days too.

Easy recipe. Turned out with the texture I was hoping for. Because my bread tins seem to be a bit under 9x5, I made 5 rolls as well with the dough, and baked those in muffin tins. I used butter in place of lard. Both rolls and bread loaves took about 20 minutes for me. Will make again.

It hardly seems worth it to add another 5-star review to this recipe, but I'm going to anyway! I've been baking all our bread for about a year now and searching for a good basic bread for sandwiches, toast, with eggs or peanut butter. This is it. I substituted 3 cups of the flour with whole wheat bread flour and added 1/4 cup gluten. Such a simple recipe, bakes up beautifully. A little chew to the crust and nice and soft inside.I'll be making this often!

Excellent, excellent recipe! I don't buy bread anymore. I don't change a thing to the recipe, perfect in every way. If you want, you can put cheese or herbs on top. A 5 lbs. bag of bread flour should make you about 5 loaves. I make everything at once and freeze what I don't use.

This is my favorite bread recipe ever! It's really delicious and versatile. I use butter instead of lard and use my bread machine to mix the dough. Then I bake it in pans or shape it into braids, dinner rolls, etc. I also sometimes add seasonings (such as thyme, rosemary, and marjoram). Great for sandwiches and toast.

It came out as described.  I made one loaf.  I might have measured incorrectly as the water was too much for the flour.  I added flour while kneading with the stand mixer, but I used whole wheat flour for that.  This is the best loaf that I ever made, and I have been making bread for decades.  For the rising segment, I rub softened Crisco on the loaf to keep it from getting hard in spots, something I hate.  I let it rise in the oven after I turned it on and off and used a damp towel over it.  I put a pan of hot water in the oven.  It worked well.  I used instant rise yeast and followed the instructions for that, which shortened the first rise.  I used good butter rather than lard.  I think I'll stick with this recipe rather than search further.  Also, I cut down the salt to one tsp as the recommended amount seemed excessive, and other reviewers had commented about that.

This has become my 'go to' bread, it's awesome. I always add some flax seed meal and chia seeds, I just mix them in the flour before I get started.  Great way to add some omega 3's to your diet.

Followed recipe. Substituted coconut oil for lard. Simply scrumptious!  I have baked bread for years, always used milk, eggs & butter. Thought I'd give this a try. I will be making it every week  or as soon as I run out!  So simple & so good!! Not too salty, perfect amount of sugar. Nothing like kneading dough to get all the kinks out of your brain.:).

This recipe is fool proof. I made it the per recipe the first two times, as I always do, and both times it was excellent! The last few times I have made minor modifications according to my own individual taste. First I added half the salt the recipe calls for and substituted it for sugar. I'm not sure if it's because I use sea salt, but the first time it was just a little too salty

This recipe came out great the first time I made it! (That almost never happens, I usually have to trial and error a few times and make adjustments before an online recipe turns out well.) So I would absolutely recommend it! Also, I didn't have lard so I just used butter.

This bread came out really dense. Maybe it's the humidity, but I simply cannot get bread to work.

Best bread recipe that I have tried so far, it wasn't too sweet or too salty. I will be making this bread every week. Thank you.

It of the handful off recipes I've tried this is by far my favorite.  It's simple enough to memorize.  Easy to put together and give you wonderful,  consistent loaves each time. Off you leave the brad dough it to rise too long you end up with a yeasty and alcoholic tasting loaves so if you're running behind our can't get to your dough when you thought you could throw it I'm the fridge for a few days and it will develop an incredible flavor! The extra long refrigerated rise is what really takes this brad to a 5 start recipe!

This is the closest I've gotten to store-bought bread. It's very soft, moist, springy. Delicious! I did substitute butter for lard and did rub butter onto the outside of the loaf immediately after removing from the oven. It definitely helps the crust (I hate a cripsy/hard crust). Used 12x4 pans and it made two not-so-tall loaves.

I make this bread almost daily.  I have halved the recipe, and then after a few loaves I also added 1 tablespoon of molasses to the recipe.  And WOW!  This bread is super toasted for sandwiches.

This recipe truly is the best!  I braided one loaf, placed it in the bread pan, and brushed the top with a beaten egg before baking...the second loaf was the traditional shape and I brushed it with melted butter before baking...both looked great and tasted even better!  I actually forgot to add the salt to the recipe but it wasn't missed.

This bread turned out perfect!!! Great texture, taste, although I did reduce the salt to 2 t. as recommended by other reviewers. Just make certain that after you preheat the oven at 425 to turn in down to 375 when you put your loaves in or you just might be very disappointed with your results. This is a "keeper"!

Wonderful Bread but I did change just a few things. Used butter flavored Crisco instead of lard,1 tsp salt and brushed with an egg white wash just before baking. It seemed a little too crusty so I brushed butter over it for the last 10 minutes. This is my new Goto bread recipe! See picture I added.

I love this recipe for it's ease and taste.  The whole family loves it.  As being a vegetarian, I did substitute the lard with extra virgin coconut oil.  The consistency remained and gives it a nice twist to normality :)

Amazing, perfect recipe! It raised well, cooked perfectly, and tasted wonderful, all according to the specifications of the recipe, substituting corn oil for the lard. This will become a weekly practice for me. If you save a loaf for the following day, it is more manageable for slicing thinly. On the first day, it's so soft and spongy that the slices come out thicker, still, oh so yummy!

I got a kitchenaid for Christmas, and had been trying to bake a decent loaf of bread for a month! Living in LA with its dry climate, along with my inexperience, has given me hard, dense loaves...thanks for the foolproof recipe, because it's exactly what I was looking for. If you follow the directions, you literally cannot mess this up!!!!

Mm, awesome. I'm eating some right now. A really great bread recipe. I followed the directions as much as I could; but as I've heard said many times, bread baking is not an exact science. Times vary based on the temperature, the humidity, the pressure... I only needed about 4 1/2 cups of flour, and it took considerably longer to proof than the recipe said. (I'd allow myself about four hours to make it, all together) But it turned out well! If you're new to making bread, as I am, make sure that you de-pan the bread as soon as you can, even if it's not totally cooled. If you don't, the bottom of the bread will become soggy. Nobody wants that.

I didn't get the results I was hoping for... I changed the lard to butter and used all-purpose flour (and a about 1/4 cup less flour than what was called for).  The bread came out dense and tasted like flour.  I know this can come from under baking the bread, but I'm very familiar with baking bread and I know when it is done.  Plus, it was in the oven for the 30 minutes, with the exception of pulling them out and brushing egg white wash over them five minutes before they were done.  I might have to invest in a scale to get the flour right for the next time... and find a recipe that uses weight instead of cups.

I just made this recipe, It is very good, rises nicely and has good flavor. I Used butter as my fat, and took advice from other reviews and cut the salt to 2 teas. I have been making bread for a few years and for some reason I have not found a recipe for an everyday sandwich bread. This recipe slices nicely and doesn't fall apart. I'm going to use this for everyday & school lunches. I also put light butter on the top of loaves when I took them out of the oven. Thanks for the recipe, Danialle

Used this recipe while visitng my sister and her family in West Virginia and my 16-year-old nephew asked me to teach him how to make homemade bread.  Didn't have the Fannie Farmer recipe that I've used for the last 19 years, but this recipe seemed very similar, so we tried it.  Doubled the recipe and were treated to four BEAUTIFUL loaves of bread.  My daughters, nieces, nephew, mom, sister, and I almost ate an entire loaf 5 minutes after they came out of the oven at 9:30 P.M. : )  Great the next day for toast and BLTs.  Two comments:  for the person who mentioned that they didn't last well for days, no homemade bread does.  It isn't full of preservatives and additives like store-bought bread.  Secondly, we ended up baking the bread for 1 hour, like my Fannie Farmer recipe and my mom's 45-year-old bread recipe call for.  Didn't think it was anywhere near done at 30 minutes.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is fantastic!  This was my first time making bread without a bread machine and it turned out lovely!  I covered the bread with aluminum foil as it baked so the top wouldn't brown too much.  I removed the foil for the last 7 minutes and brushed the top with melted butter.  The bread came out crusty and flaky on the outside with exactly the right density on the inside (light without being too light and just dense enough to be perfect).  I used the recipe exactly as it stated but I halved it because I only wanted to make a single loaf.  The bread was a HUGE hit in the house.  I served it with our dinner and between my husband, my 5 year old daughter and myself, we ate almost the entire loaf with only 2 slices leftover.  They are already begging me to make another loaf!  I saw a few reviews saying they cut the salt down.  Honestly, you don't need to. The bread wasn't at all salty.  It was absolutely perfect!

I have not tried this yet but I'm getting ready to...I have a question I hope someone who has made this already might see and answer.  Instruction #4 says to preheat oven to 425, instruction #5 says to bake at 375.  Do you preheat at 425 and then turn it down to 375 when you put the dough in the oven?  That's what I'm going to go do anyway, I hope it works.  Thank-you.

NEED MORE STARS! This recipe lived up to the hype.  Great crust, amazing crumb, nice flavour. I substituted 2 cups multigrain bread flour and used butter instead of lard, also cut the salt in half. I used my KitchenAid Artisan and after initial mixing, kneaded for 4 minutes on speed 2. Baked for 35 minutes to an internal temp of 200F.  Perfect loaf (it was loaves, but one is already gone). Thanks for this go-to recipe!

I made these using the bread flour, the bread came out great, I let my bread machine do the kneading for me. The bread came out light and fluffy at first the top was crusty but once cooled was soft. Didn't have enough salt but that was my fault I used about 2 tsp instead of the 1tbsp...wish I did though. But good keeper recipe.

This recipe was super good .  I used butter flavored Crisco instead of lard.   Used a trick I got from another baker concerning "rise time".  Turned on my oven for 15 seconds and placed the dough inside.  The rise was incredible.  The second rise, i did the same, only left the dough in the oven for 20 minutes, then removed and let it finish on the countertop for the remaining 10 minutes while I let the oven come up to temperature.  30 minutes bake time was perfect here in Colorado.  The flavor and texture were perfect for both loaves.  Thanks.

This is the best white bread recipe I have tried so far. I did switch it up a bit. Butter instead of lard and I decreased the sugar by 1/2 tbsp and the salt by 1/2 tsp. Perfect every time. Beginning bread baker.

I have been baking bread for over 30 years and have many recipes.  This white bread is the best recipe I think I have ever had. Very flavorful and stays moist for days. This is the only white bread recipe i use now. It really is the best.

This is a great bread recipe- not too fussy and the product is great, especially if you don't add all the salt. I really like how easy it is substitute in whole flour as well. I've been adding two cups of whole flour in after adding the first two cups of white flour and the bread still turns out very nicely.

ok, last time i made bread was back in the 80's and it was hard as a rock.  so...i decided to try again to beat the yeast into submission.  although i didn't put a thermometer to the water, the dough ran up the beaters and extruded out the front of my mixer (ah! that's what those plastic gizmos are for!), i mixed most of it by hand, and i barely was able to knead it after that...my wrists were so tired...it rose!  so i said let us bake the bread!  and we did!  and it was GOOD!  

what a FORGIVING recipe!  i LOVE it!  thank you thank you!  i will make this again for sure!

Really good bread - not too sweet and puffs up nicely.  I usually make 1 bread loaf and rolls with the other half of the dough.  I have also experimented with garlic butter and parmigiana in the middle and it was also excellent.  Yum-o!

I just made homemade bread for the first time, as I'm new at learning homemade recipes - and this turned out wonderfully!  I don't have lard, so I used butter.  I also halved the recipe & only own a small loaf pan, so I used the extra dough to make a big roll on a pizza pan.  I just got them out of the oven and can't stop eating the warm, chewy goodness :-)  With the sweet taste, I don't know that I'd used this for sandwiches, but I believe they'd make great rolls (or even breadsticks), and I will try that next time.

This is the first time I've attempted to make bread using the traditional method rather than a bread machine. This recipe was simple to use, instructions easy to follow and the finished product made even me look good. I need lots of practice with the kneading and forming of loaves but even with my lack of experience, I looked like a pro. Thanks Danialle!!!!

I followed a readers advice and let the bread rise longer in the pans and  I had two large loafs.

This was my first loaf of bread that came out really well. I made a few changes - I reduced the yeast to just over one teaspoon and I let the dough rise twice before the final rise.  I also splashed some water in the bottom of the oven so that it would create steam.

this is the bread I remember my mother making when i was little --- light, airy and absolutely fabulous out of the oven!
The first time I made bread it was a disaster - using this recipe it was awesome this time - even my wife had a piece (and she's on a diet) because the smell drove her wild! Ive deleted all my bread recipes - this is now my favorite.....

I tried tried tried to follow the recipe but 5 1/2 cups of flour appeared to do the trick, I also brushed the loaves with butter per another reviewer and it  came out WONDERFUL. Crispy crust soft and chewy inside.  Would have given 5 stars, but didn't due to the changes. Still, fantastic bread.  Thanks for the recipe. :)Will make it my #1 bread recipe.

Excellent all purpose bread. Dense enough to spread with jelly or honey but soft enough for sandwiches. Freezes fairly well. I substituted butter for lard, honey for sugar and cut the salt in half. Used 2 cups of whole wheat flour as well

For me, a foolproof recipe. I divide the crecipe in half for one loaf and it's still great. I use melted shortening instead of lard, though. 

Tonight I'm going to try using it for cloverleaf rolls, rolling three balls of dough and putting into lightly greased muffin tins. It's mornng, so I'm waiting for the initial rise, then I'll punch it down, roll the balls, put them in the tin, cover with plastic wrap and put in the fridge. When I get home, I'll take it out, let rise for 30 minutes or so, then bake. Fingers crossed.

AND: Teach your teens to make this! It's so easy, they'll get a real boost of self-esteem in the kitchen!

I've made homemade bread by hand for many years and this one just didn't stand up to other recipes I've made. It was too flight/fluffy for my tastes.

Simple recipe with big taste. I've also made dinner rolls with this, just use a cupcake pan and follow the same easy steps. This couldn't be easier and so worth the effort. I make bread when I'm stressed and need to release some energy. Kneading this dough results in a soft, warm loaves that comes out flawless every time. There is nothing like hot fresh bread from your own hands. Very satisfying.

I followed the recipe exactly . . . this bread is fantastic!  I was a little hesitant because I don't have a stand mixer, but I just mixed by hand and kneaded well and it came out beautifully. Great recipe for a beginner.

I halved the recipe, to mix and do first rise in the bread machine, and made 8 sandwich rolls. Very good. Baked 15 minutes at 375. I did use butter flavored shortening, rather than lard.

Other than a failed attempt at a flavored bread recently, I haven't made bread in over 40 yrs. No bread machine, not even a hand mixer..used a whisk for the majority, and a wooden spoon for the remainder of mixing. Still turned out light and airy. It did take a smidge more flour than called for (1/4 C maybe?) but that was worked in while kneading. Really a great easy recipe.

I keep thinking I've found the best white bread recipe but then can't resist trying another one. This is yet another good one. I did reduce the sugar down to 1 tbsp which was just right for us and used vegetable oil instead of the lard. Makes great sandwiches and toast and I love the crust on this. I'm making another batch today. Thanks so much Danialle.

While it takes some time, this bread is pretty simple to make. This is coming from a guy who had to buy his first sack of flour to make this bread. When I tasted it the first time it made me so proud that I could bake something that good.

Loved this bread...thanks for the recipe!  I did end up using more flour than was called for, so make sure you have extra on-hand and add until you get the consistency correct.

This was the first time I'd tried to make bread in 15 years. My first attempt had been a complete failure, even the dog (who ate garbage) wouldn't eat it. This was simple and easy and turned out wonderfully! I was very pleased.

Fantastic Bread! I simply quit buying bread after I found this recipe. Melted butter brushed on top of loaves for the last 7 min of baking is a must.

Yum! I substituted splenda for the sugar and shortening for lard, and it turned out GREAT! This is a wonderful recipe, also I took the bread out 5 minutes early and brushed with water to make it extra cruchy. :)

This is the best bread recipe ever! I've made this with butter and with lard, and it is infinitely better with lard! The texture is great and it tastes delicious! Even people who don't normally like home-made bread love this.

Fantastic! I, like others, used oil instead of lard. I used about 5 1/2 cups of flour, but it varies each time. Buttered the top too like others. I plan to keep this recipe FOREVER! I plan to use it for rolls, and cinnamon bread. Great A++++++++++++++

The best and easiest recipe. Just the way my mom would make her bread. Turned out just fine with all-purpose flour, and veg oil. I made 24 buns with this recipe.

My first successful white bread. I've made several white bread from this site but none of them rose (my fault of course-not the recipe). They rose allright but not as high as I expected. But this one rose high above the pan and still high up a bit in the oven. The taste was great. Just as I expected. A bit salty, so it's nice to be eaten plain. Nice proportion between sugar and salt. Finally I can have store bought like bread in my own oven. Thanks alot!

My first bread baking try in 30 years! And the recipe was fabulous! I let it sit with the yeast mixture longer, as I did with letting it rise for an hour and a half. It did double in size, as I had hoped. I brushed melted butter on the tops of both loaves with sprinkled sugar before and after I put it in the oven. Wow, it was delicious! The slight sugar touch gave it a light sweet taste on the not too hard crust. More bread recipes are now in my horizon!

I made this bread today using RapidRise yeast packet, following the directions on the yeast package and it turned out wonderfully. Unlike many breads on this website, it is not too sweet but more like store white bread. Nice crisp crust, soft and light insides that taste delicious. Thank you for the great recipe!

This was SO EASY. And it turned out incredibly well. A few notes: I did substitute the sugar with creamed honey. (Delicious!) And instead of lard I used vegetable oil. (I didn't have lard or enough butter.) Also, I don't think I put the entire 6 1/2 cups of flour in - just enough to be able to knead it - maybe 6 cups altogether plus a little flour during kneading. Right before the last 40 min. rise, I turned on my oven with baking stone in there so it would have plenty of time to heat up. I did try rubbing butter on the loaves 20 minutes into the baking process, and that worked very well. I took them out of the pan about 5 minutes after they came out of the oven and put them on a cooling rack. And as a side note, it seemed like the crust was really hard right when it came out of the oven, but it softened up nicely as it cooled.  Another FYI, I have a probe thermometer and cooked the bread until 190 degrees F so I didn't have to "tap" the bottom of the bread. But to sum up, this is a very easy recipe, seems like it is very forgiving, and made some of the best white bread I have ever tried!

I halved the recipe, used the dough cycle on my breadmaker, and baked it in the oven. I also used olive oil instead of lard. The bread had a great flavour, nice crust and most importantly the kids loved it! Oh and it rose beautifully, the best rise I've had with any of the recipes I've been trying recently.

This recipe has become my favorite for white bread. It always comes out right and even beginners can do it. My 11 yr. old daughter loves to help me, we cheat we don't knead the dough I am lucky enough to have dough hooks with my mixer.
Thank You for giving up this recipe it's wonderful.

This is the bread recipe I use most often; it turns out perfect every time, even when I'm careless.  Good sturdy crust, soft breadguts.

This recipe was ok. It rose and baked perfectly but we did not care much for the texture.  I will stick to the cuban bread recipe from king  auther's flour that I have been using.

WOW! Usually I have to fine tune every recipe I try- taking from one, adding to another. This recipe however was amazing!! My husband and I ate half the loaf in one sitting and it was even fantastic the next day. I cut the recipe in half just to test it out and deducted a cup of flour and it was fluffy and perfect! Then, with the 2 slices I had leftover, I made scrambled eggs, piled them on top of the thick slices, covered with a slice of american cheese and put it in the oven (still warm from baking the bread) my goodness, I don't think my husband has ever eaten so much of anything I've cooked.

I have made this to many times now to count. This is mt familys fav. recipe. This is without a doubt the best bread recipe I have found. My kids prefer this over any store bought bread now. It's great for toast , sandwiches, and their breakfast sandwich I make them. We always enjoy one out of the oven with some butter and honey. 
Thanks so much for sharing this !! Wish I could give it 10 stars!

Very easy to make, and very tasty bread. I misread the directions and used slighty more sugar than I was supposed to, didn't seem to affect it at all, it turned out great!!!

I've only ever made the bread recipe on the back of the yeast packet before and it's always come out so bad we've ended up throwing it away coz noone eats it! But this bread is delicious, so airy and has a proffessional quality. Never again will i go back to the old recipe! Thank you for posting it.

I made this bread because it's been ranked #1 in the bread category for weeks now, and I wanted to see what all the hub-bub was about. I guess I can see why fans of white bread like this recipe. It produces really good bread as far as white bread goes--not spongy at all.

I would definently make this bread again! It was so tasty and a home run with my family. It was easy to make and fun as well. I have never made bread in my life before, so I have to say it turned out great for my first try!

This is a great recipe. I substituted Margarine for lard and did it all in my Kitchen-aid. I started with the beater on low until I got to 5 cups of the flour and then switched to the dough hook for the remainder then turned it up a notch and beat for another 7 minutes or so. Turned out perfect, the proportion of salt to sugar seems about right and it was very tasty. I buttered the tops lightly right out of the oven to keep them a little softer. What I really like is this bread keeps very well for several days.

This was my first bread — Ever!  And, yes, I am over 60.  I had a lot of mindset issues to get over before even trying this.  My mother could never make bread “work” although I remember how good the house smelled and how nummy it was when the butter melted into the bread and then everything kind of melted in your mouth.  

Long story short:  I made this yesterday for the first time!  And it is a Success!!  I made it as written with butter (as mentioned by the author) for the lard, and used quick-rising yeast (rookie bread ingredient shopper whoops) that calls for a 10-minute resting period to replace the first rise.   I also went on instinct when it came to kneading and for how long and, maybe, since I googled kneading and kneading techniques when the bread was in the oven, I might be a little more confident next time.

Summary:  This recipe is amazing!  Great texture and flavour!   Works even for the rookiest of rookies (me).  ??  Thank you!

Very flavorful, dense, and beautiful. Saving this recipe. Used butter instead of lard. Might try it with less flour to see if it will be lighter, or less dense.

Perfect white bread. I made it as written except I only put 1.5 T sugar in the dough because my husband does not like sweet sandwich bread. I have made this bread now several times and it is consistently delicious. I make it every other day. It will remain a staple in our household for years to come.

First time making this and it turned out light and fluffy.  The crust was a little crunchy, but this bread makes the most amazing grilled cheese - crispy on the outside, soft and tender inside.

The bread turned out beautifully well in terms of taste, my mother loved it. But there is a little problem, that I would love to be helped with. The top of the bread forms a sort of crust irrespective of the remaining bread.....what did I do wrong.

I added raisins and cinnamon and sugar to this and it turned out very well.
I added 1 cup of raisins when adding the rest of the flour to integrate them into the dough.
I added 3 TBS of sugar and 1.5 TBS of cinnamon to the rolled out dough after the first rising. Punch down the dough, cut in hafl, roll in rectangle. Add a little bit of water to the rolled out dough and sprinkle your cinnamon and sugar then roll and seal the seams and let rise again as the recipe states.
the dough seemed much wetter than other recipes but the end product is very nice.
I would definitely make this again.

It's so easy and so delicious.  I substitute butter for shortening because I love the flavor of butter.   Even though white bread is often on sale at the grocery store, it doesn't taste like this and all of the artificial ingredients.  
I am going to modify for raisin/cinnamon bread and dinner rolls.  Nothing like the smell of fresh bread baking in the oven on a cool and wet fall day.

This recipe is amazing.  It has a crispy crust and a soft fluffy interior.  I half this recipe and use my breadmaker.

It turned out very tasty, and soft! I used oil, and just put all of the dough in a cast iron pot to cook it, so I ended up with a large round loaf. I will definitely make this again.

I cut the sugar back to one teaspoon ,the salt back to one tablespoon and used margarine instead of lard ( didn’t have any) but will try it with lard next time. I brushed the top with egg white before placing in oven.
Nice loaf makes great toast.

Yes, I made it and it was SENSATIONAL.  I've never made bread in my life and this turned out beyond my wildest expectations.  I am not a cook, baker or candle stick maker, BUT yet I followed the instructions and video (viewed it at least 3 different times) and the results were FABULOUS.  This the only bread receipe I will use although I will probable make variations on the theme.  I shared with several friends and they raved about how good it was.  I still cannot believe how good it tasted (better than store bought for sure!) and still have the nutritional content it has.  Why would anyone eat anyother bread than this.  I did substitue Stevia for the sugar.  Thanks X1,000,000!!!

I made it and it’s to die for! But I have problems slicing it as it’s kinda crumbly. Did I not need knead enough for the second rise? Or were my baking pans too small for that amount of bread? Also I used butter instead of lard, 2 teaspoons salt and all purpose flour. Any tips to help?

This simple recipe rivals any white bread you can buy in a store.  It's easy to make if you can follow instructions.  Be sure to use bread flour, not AP.  You will get a tremendous rise, and fluffier texture from the stronger glutens in bread flour. Enjoy!

This is a great bread.
The whole loaf is only 540 calories! It is very fast, tasty and easy to alter. After kneading bread in my big stainless steel bowl, immediately I  divide in half, put in the bread pans, rise only 1 time and bake. Much better texture than the double rise. Faster too.
I'm making about 4 loaves weekly now.

No changes to the recipe were made and the bread came out great.  Compared to other bread recipes I've tried, this one was the quickest and came out the best in my opinion. Everyone's taste is different but this seems like a winner for all tastes.

Made a half batch to be sure it turned out well and that we liked it... now I wish I had made the 2 loaf batch, as it is already being attacked by the family! Everyone is loving the crispy crust and the light but firm center. It also toasts up beautifully. I did not have lard, so I subbed in olive oil with no problems. I used to be afraid of working with active yeast, but if you use a thermometer to check the temp of the liquid before adding the yeast, you won't go wrong!

Have made it 3 times, this is a really good bread. I now only make one loaf at a time, it is fast and easy. You can change it a little if you want to, i like to add a little more sugar, very little. Make this bread you will love it.

Great recipe. I did double the sugar for more flavor, otherwise it is too bland. 

I have used this recipe as a base for cinnamon bread, garlic rosemary or parmigiano bread. 

I no longer buy bread as the three loaves I get from this recipe last about one week.

I do not use a machine, so I add three and a half cups of flour while blending in a bowl, then turn out on a floured surface to add the remaining three cups, while kneading. Scrapers are a necessary tool for this technique.

I make this recipe weekly.

The changes I made:  4 Tablespoons of sugar, 1 scant tablespoon of salt, 3 Tablespoons of butter not lard.  Also, covered the bowl of warm water, yeast and sugar to let yeast ferment (about 10 minutes).  Added salt and butter AFTER I added the first two cups of four.  Brushed tops of loaves with butter when they came hot out of the oven.  Followed the rest of the recipe and it turned out very well.  A keeper!

Very easy dough to make, great to work with and fast as bread doughs go.  A little bland on flavor but okay.  I made one plain loaf and one with cheese.

Tasty, easy and delicious! Made 2 8x4 loafs and took a few extra rolls because I felt like I had extra dough, which was good because the loafs were almost overflowing. Crispy on the outside and fluffy in the inside.n  I added some egg wash before putting in the oven. I put some foil at some point because it was getting too brown-ish at the beginning. Overall, delicious!

Very easy. After the first rise, I found kneading it again made it lighter and softer. This had a great taste!

Love this bread.  I usually cut the recipe in half, since it's only two of us.  If I do make the entire recipe, I find since I live in a hot dry climate, with high elevation, I have to cut down the flour to 5 cups. I wrap the extra loaf of bread with press and seal wrap and place in freezer.  It defrosts beautifully and tastes as if I just made it.
  I always use Kitchenaid mixer with dough hook too.  And, I do not use lard (yuck, yuck) or crisco.  Instead I use organic coconut oil.  Also I use regular white flour.  I find the bread flour doesn't taste as good, perhaps it's because of where we live.  I also cut down the salt to 1/2 a tablespoon when making one loaf.  Recipe is very forgiving.  
Also, after the first rise, I remove dough from bowl and lightly flour surface, and I use my rolling pin to roll dough out into a square.  Then I fold dough into the shape of my bread pan and gently place inside pan.  I let it rise once more before I bake it off.  I use the convection setting on my oven at 400 degrees and it only takes 18 minutes.  I remove from oven, brush top with Amish unsalted butter and remove from pan onto a wire rack to cool.  I have a slicing guide which holds an entire loaf of bread, which makes for easy, and even slicing for sandwiches, toast, and anything you use bread for.  This also makes yummy french toast!
I never buy bread from the store anymore.  It's full of chemicals and frankly, it's plain gross.  This is so cheap to make granted you have time, and

This is my go-to recipe for bread!  Watching the video first  took all the "scary" out of making this recipe.  My loaves come out picture perfect every time.  I no longer purchase bread!!  Also, I saw a review that warned not to put the bread in the freezer.  I did.  Wrapped well in foil and placed in the freezer, a week later I let it thaw on the counter and it was as fresh as the day it was made.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

We just made this bread today. We loved it! It did rise quite a bit so I might break it into 2-double bread pans instead of the one I used. I will be interested in watching it over the next few days to see how long it lasts.

I will definitely be making this regularly.  I used 3 Tbsp of bacon drippings and the flavor is wonderful!  I highly recommend the bacon grease over an alternative. I also used the 1 Tbsp of salt and it doesn’t taste too salty to me as other reviews have stated.  Also, I preheated the oven to 425, then changed it to 375 and put the bread in. Baked for 30 minutes. The tops felt hard when they came out, but I brushed them with butter and they softened up. Perfect!!

This the easiest and fastest bread recipe I have found.  I baked this in one Pullman bread pan and only let it rise the first time. The second time I closed the lid  and baked it as directed. It came out FANTASTIC!!

I used to use another really popular recipe on this site but I always found it a bit dense.  So I took a chance this Christmas morning and tried this recipe instead and I’m sooooo glad I did!  It’s light on the inside and the crust has a nice crisp crust. It’s absolutely perfect in my opinion. 
I made it exactly as the recipe is posted, didn’t change a thing!  This is definitely my go-to recipe for bread from now on!

After searching this site for plain white bread and reading reviews, I made this today.  It came out beautiful for my first time making bread!  The ingredients were near identical to my mother’s recipe that is written on an envelope without instructions. I followed this recipe exactly, and will definitely make again.

All I can say is yummy.  I have made this recipe into bread, hot rolls, and cinnamon rolls, all of them come out awesome. I added a little more sugar when I mixed the yeast and water for a sweeter bread and that was great too.  It is easy and turns out amazing makes even me look like I can cook.

My son loved this bread! I’ve been using a Ciabatta recipe to slice for his sandwiches. I decided to try this for something different and he came home from school so excited to tell me how good the bread was and to make it our permanent recipe! I used all purpose flour for most of it since I ran out of bread flour. It didn’t take the whole time to bake. I took it out of the oven 3 minutes early so it wouldn’t burn.

Second review!! Okay! I made this again, I forgot to buy frozen rolls (Bad home cook! Bad!) for Thanksgiving so I thought, why not make that bread again, and use one half of the ball for rolls? So, here we are! One half is a normal loaf, I then shaped 12 little dough balls into a muffin tin, baked as usual. The only thing I did differently this time was brush rolls and bread with salted butter the last 5 minutes. I re-brushed them when they came out of the oven, and MY GOD. This is now, seriously, my universal, go-to bread recipe. THANK YOU, OP!!! Thank you!!!

I have made this bread multiple times and absolutely love it. The taste is amazing and it is very easy. The only issue I have is my loaves tend to stay flatter and more dense, but it is still very tasty. It makes amazing grilled cheese sandwiches or toast.

Very good! Simple to make, crunchy crust, soft inside. I used olive oil instead of butter to make it a little easier to mix.

First time making this & it came out very well! I halved the recipe & made 1 loaf instead to test it out. I also used unsalted butter instead of lard. I baked until 30 min but then a few min longer to get that “Golden” top. I think lightly browned would’ve been fine for me though, it’s a very crunchy crust but still very soft inside. Also I can really taste the yeast or maybe I put a half cup too much of bread flour. I will definitely be trying this again & be making personal adjustments as I go but absolutely great for a first timer! Very happy with the result, thanks for this :)

This was my first home baked white bread. I’ve made cornbread and biscuits, but I’ve always been intimidated by loaf bread. Well no longer, this was fairly easy and will only get easier the more I bake.

Just made bread using this recipe and making bread for the very first time from scratch. This recipe was very easy to follow, very easy to do. My only problem was I didn't divide the dough quite evenly so one loaf is slightly bigger than the other. But that's on me not the recipe! I am a reasonably good at baking but a first timer for bread without a bread machine.

This recipe is outstanding! I used another one previously that my husband referred to the final product as “boat weights”. So I am SO glad I found this instead. I substituted honey/agave for the sugar since I try to avoid cane sugar when possible and used butter since I didn’t have lard. Loaves came out beautifully. Nice, firm crust, and chewy, light crumb inside. This is my go-to for white bread from now on!

This is so delicious! I over-proved it slightly, so the crumb was a bit dense, but the flavor is amazing. I don’t usually like plain white bread, but I was eating this slice by slice as soon as it was cool.

This is the only bread recipe I use, even with whole wheat bread. Since I live in Ukraine, the only solid shortening is butter, so I use sunflower oil and increase it to 4 Tbsps. or 1/4 cup. The only other adjustment I make is that I add 1/4 cup vital wheat gluten. Everyone I give it to raves about it!

Excellent. Basic recipe for a hardy bread. I used 3 tbsp of butter in place of lard and it worked fine. It rose beautifully. Like most white breads, its flavor is subtle. I will add melted butter on top next time. I'm looking forward to adding nuts and savory spices to build up the flavor. Sunflower seeds would probably be a great choice, but the dough is thick enough to hold any kind of seed or nut.

my bread did not rise as expected and then I saw 2(.25 ounces)packages......so is it 2x .25 ounces?...i put in 2 and a quarter teaspoon ...that is .25 ounce - so should it be 2 times my 2 and a quarter teaspoon.....bread still came out lovely - i used a free hanging thermometer in my oven - get the temperature to the thermometer inside - during the baking the thermometer will go up and down - don"t worry about that. Crispy outside lovely inside --- oh and i only used 1 tablespoon olive oil - if you can read you can do anything :)salt was perfect for the two breads so i will not be lowering that as suggested by some comments

This made a dense, slightly sweet, super soft  bread. It made two loaves for me so I think this recipe could easily be halved.  I used margarine instead of lard and 1 tablespoon of salt seemed like a lot so I did a little less than 1/2 of a tablespoon and it was perfect!

My go to white bread recipe.  It halves really easy.  I don't mind the saltiness and I think that's what helps it not go stale so quickly.  I call this my lard bread recipe.

Made this for the first time.  Made two loaves.  One was traditional white bread and I tried the 2nd loaf as a cinnamon sugar loaf.   Both loaves turned out very well.  After the 2nd proof and I put it in the oven I got another inch or so rise out of it before a solid crust formed.  

The cinnamon loaf looked great but I think I used too much butter and sugar.  So for next time, I will use melted butter and a pastry brush and lightly coat the dough with cinnamon sugar via a shaker vs using a spoon to spread it.  

Both loaves taste great and this is the 1st time I made this recipe and I basically was playing around to see how making bread worked.

I have used this recipe multiple times, it has become my go-to recipe, we all love it. I started making bread as part of a healthier diet because I know what I am putting in it every time. Since I started this, it makes me sick to my stomach to walk down the bread isle at the grocery stores, must be all the preservatives they add to keep it "fresh", does not smell very good to me anymore. This recipe comes out perfect every time I make it. I usually make one loaf of bread and then form the other into rolls or bread bowls, whatever we are eating for dinner.  Making your own bread is time consuming but worth the work. Thank you for sharing this recipe!
*UPDATE* I added 2 eggs to the mixture to make a denser bread. This came as a pleasant surprise and I will continue to do so.

I really enjoy this recipe. It's easy and made two very light, fluffy, loaves. I tweaked it a bit:
1. I didn't have lard, but since I did have butter and Crisco Buttery, I opted to use:
                           
                                1 tbsp of butter (it happened to be unsalted) 
                                and 2 tbsp of Crisco Buttery/Butter Flavour. 

I figured I should substitute some animal product (butter) with the shortening since the recipe called for lard. YET, I also figured I should use some shortening to provide the crispness of an oil based product that lard typically provides.  **Lard is unique in that it interacts with baking both through taste and consistency; it acts kind of like a butter/shortening hybrid, in that it tastes richer than shortening, but gives bread a crisper crust than butter (in my experience.) Thus why I thought mixing the two would react similar to lard. I wanted a fluffier bread, so I put in more shortening than butter. I find butter gives a denser, and less crisp, bread.
- After reading some reviews, I also cut back a little on the salt. I put in 2 tsp (ie: 2/3 of the recommended 1 tbsp) of salt. I used Kosher salt since I like the taste. Sea salt would have given a similar taste I'm sure. I usually put 1 tsp of salt in per loaf. Again, just my preference.
- Although it was unspecified, I used Olive oil to grease my bowl and coat my dough while it rose the first time.  **Funnily enough, I just use cooking spray to coat my b

I've been using this recipe for the last two years (to the day) and it has become my "go-to" since that time.  I've used olive oil, lard, Crisco, butter, vegetable oil......just about any type of shortening......with equal results.  I've modified it to include whole wheat and rye breads by substituting 2 1/2 cups of those for the white flour.  I find little difference when using all-purpose flour in lieu of bread flour.
I'm 71 years old and have been baking bread since about age 25, usually with acceptable results, but I have turned out a marginal batch or two along the way.  That has never happened with this recipe, even when I sometimes err in the process.
This recipe is similar to one in my mother's cook book, which is nearing 100 years old, but has yet to fail me.  I've passed it along to numerous people because I regard it as almost "idiot-proof".
I make baguettes from the same recipe and place a pan in the oven as it pre-heats.  Just before placing the proofed loaves in the oven I pour about two or three cups of water into the pan.  Makes a nice crunchy crust with tender center.  Slash the loaves prior to placing in the oven, and if using perforated pans, (I do) reduce the baking time by five to ten minutes.
Experiment.  I did, with wonderful results.  Makes wonderful cinnamon/raisin bread, too.  Soak the raisins with the yeast/sugar/water.  Add the cinnamon just before forming the loaves, after the first rise.

This one is a winner!

The recipe is fine, I'm sure, but it's the plainest bread I have ever had. I kept putting things on it, hoping it would taste better, but it just ended up tasting like what I put on it and nothing more. I really wanted to like this recipe. ;(

Didn’t turn out well for me. I think because of the high temp before turning it down. The outside was hard as a rock. If I try it again I will just cook at one temp.

Should the dough be so sticky that you can't handle it? I was very careful to measure everything perfectly but had to add more floor so I could knead it. Did anyone else have this problem?

Very good basic white bread recipe: moist, fine crumb, great crust, not too sweet. It’s great toasted. I did substitute butter for the lard. In one batch I threw in a couple handfuls of uncooked old fashioned oats. Before baking I brushed the tops of the loaves with a beaten egg & a little water. Beautiful! By the way, I let my KitchenAid stand mixer do ALL of the mixing and kneading - so easy. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I used butter.  Tastes just like I remembered bread tasting like as a kid.  Never buying store bread again.  I didn’t knead it that long - maybe 3 mins max.  Perfect air to dough ratio.

The bread came out PERFECT! The only thing is that it rises way beyond a bread loaf pan. I cooked both loaves on a cookie sheet and got beautiful, big fluffy loaves that tasted wonderful right out of the oven. I’ll definitely use this recipe in the future.

I love this recipe and have made it more times than I can count. The only things I change is I use oil instead of the lard, and reduce the salt to 1 tsp. I have used this recipe as my go-to recipe for homemade rolls as well. I make 24 rolls and the family loves them for sandwiches, using for hamburgers, etc...
I recommend this recipe to anyone and everyone.

This was an easy fool proof bread.  I used 3T. butter flavored crisco instead of lard and my Kitchen Aid mixer/dough hook.  Got 2 thumbs up from the 8 y/o and will definitely make it again.

Very delicious, nice and fluffy on the inside and nice crust, I also added a light eggwash before I put in oven and sesame seeds on one loaf and poppy seeds on the other, found it added a little extra flavor.

Turned out wonderfully!  Being the 1st time making this bread, I stuck to the recipe, except for the lard [didn't have any] and the time in the oven.  Since my oven is a convection type, it usually cooks faster than conventional ovens, I pulled out the loaves 4 minutes early. 

The salt content is perfectly fine for my taste, as well as my wife's.

I decided to use Crisco, not lard [didn't have any on-hand] and didn't want too brown of a top by adding butter.

It slices very well and even thin toasted slices hold up well to aggressive buttering.  This reminds me of the bread my childhood friend's mom used to make back in the early 60s.

This will most certainly be a weekly double-loaf.  Great toasted, or as a sandwich and can't wait to try it on a grilled cheese & ham sandwich.

Thank you for the great recipe!!

Still making this bread. I usually don't add a whole tablespoon of salt and I add about a teaspoon more of sugar.

I'm 14 and I'd never made bread by myself. This recipe is so simple and it turned out so great! It rose and had an amazing flavor! My older sister ate almost 2 loaves in 4 days, she loves it and so do my parents.   I will definitely make this again.

Very good recipe. It was more dense than I'd have liked it to be, but it was so soft it made up for the density. I did have to use butter instead of lard and I made exactly half the amount for a single loaf instead of two. All the same, a very good loaf.

Delicious.  I did add an egg to the recipe and found it gave a nice texture to the loaf.  Definitely going to be one of my favorite recipes.

Just started making this, however the directions don't say to proof the yeast. It simply goes on to adding in other ingredients. My yeast is currently proofing. I'll report back after the bread is done.

OMG! I just followed this recipe and made thee most perfect bread... I did some things different.I used real butter instead of lard.The kind of butter that comes in cubes so I could measure exactly 3 tablespoons. I also used Crisco butter flavored spray to oil the bowl ( lightly)  and lightly sprayed  the glass bread pans with Crisco butter flavor spray. Very lightly! 
 Here's another good trick!
When the recipe called for splitting the dough into two after rising in a oiled bowl for a couple of hours,I waited till it rose, I did the parting into two, but I got out a very large piece of tin foil  without any flour or spray,then I rolled out my glob of dough with a rolling pin on the tin and folded  the dough into a rolled loaf. I repeated that with my second glob. 

I also placed it into the glass baking pan with Crisco butter flavored spray. (very lightly sprayed) And then I also placed loosely tin foil on top of the dough to rise for an hour  and baked the bread with tin foil on top. Phenomenal! I am book marking this recipe.Thank-you!

Makes a nice, sturdy bread with a good texture. The only criticism is that I wish I had read more reviews and reduced salt. I like salt, but this was way too salty - still edible - but definitely noticeable. I'll reduce it next time for sure.

Easy to follow recipe. Great bread for sandwiches, toast, or as a snack with butter or other spread. I made this bread twice, the first time I used loaf pans and made no tweaks to recipe. The second time, I made two stand alone loaves, brushed with extra virgin olive oil after second proof, and scored the loaves before baking. Simple and delicious.

This was OK. The only change I made was to use butter instead of lard. It was better than the first one I made from another recipe, but still on the hunt for the perfect, to me, bread.

Great recipe! I had to substitute bread flour with APF. Still came out great, will definitely make again and will try it with the bread flour to see if there is much of a difference.

This came out horrible, my third try at it, I followed instructions exactly, exact temperature of water, yeast, rising, baking. Far to dense and not good flavor, heading for the trash can yet again. I wish someone could tell me what I am doing wrong, my only change in the recipe was olive oil instead of lard, but a lot of people did that. I either need a new recipe or a baking class, I will give it 4 stars because I think it is my issue somewhere.

Easy recipe to follow. First time I ever had a bread recipe turn out good. This is a keeper! I used my mixer with the dough hook to knead. I used butter instead of lard and cut the salt in half because of some of the reviews. Other than that I followed it as written.

I'm not buying white bread anymore. I've been making this tasty bread for a couple of months now and could not go back to store-bought white bread with no flavor. 

This bread has a delightful flavor and it holds up well to butter. In other words,  it has a tight crumb and doesn't tear apart when you apply butter to it. My wife and I will even snack on it in the evenings.

I have been looking for a new bread recipe and this one is AMAZING!!!!     I checked out the other reviews and did follow what quite a few suggested and put less salt in.  I only used maybe  2 tsps.    This bread is just out of this world.  So fluffy inside and it stays so fresh, yet keeps it's beautiful crust too.  I can tell you, it didn't  last long once the kids got to it!!    I highly recommend this to everyone!!

I've this twice now and love it. I used all purpose flour the first time because it's all I had. Yesterday I used bread flour and to be honest, AP had a better flavor and texture. Makes great toast! This will be my go-to white bread recipe from now on.

I just started making bread. I have tried doing the jelly roll up with the dough and it never seems to turn out right. It doesn't raise up as much and I always seem to get air pockets. Is there an easier way? Can I just form the loaf by hand?

Awesome basic bread! 
I was looking for a bread suitable for sandwiches and these turned out perfect.  To give it a bit of texture and more fibre I subbed half the flour with whole wheat.
Will make this one again for sure!

Wow, this bread is REALLY good! I normally don't think baking homemade sandwich bread is worth it, but this recipe is much better than what you find in the store.  I followed some advice from the other reviews and reduced the salt by roughly half. I also brushed the top with melted butter to have a shiny crust. Then, while the bread was still hot I stuck it in a plastic bag to let the crust get soft for 45 minutes or so. When I took it out, it was incredibly soft and easy to slice up. My boyfriend and I even sampled a piece with only butter- it was excellent. New favorite bread recipe, for sure.

I didn't add as much salt, just as the other reviews said.  I didn't have lard so I used margarine; the bread didn't brown but stayed white (due to the margarine).  It was very dense, which doesn't bother me at all, the problem I had with it is that it was very yeasty even after I baked it.  I could smell the yeast on the bread when I cut it, and after keeping it closed in a container for a few days there was a pungent alcohol smell and I was actually worried that it would start fermenting again and I'd end up with hootch.  I ate most of it, toasted with butter and it had an almost sourdough taste to it.

I just made this bread today and thought it turned out pretty nice. The crust is really nice and it has a good flavor. Easy to make. I definitely substituted vegetable oil for the lard, though (not a lard fan). I think put less flour in though - I usually do put less flour than recipes call for to make sure it's nice and moist.

Tried this recipe for the first time today. The bread is great with butter. I'll be trying it for sandwiches later. It seems like it will hold up well.

My bread machine broke down and I was looking for a recipe for doing it by hand.  (When my kids were little, I made batches of seven loaves without a recipe, but that was then!) Reviews for this sounded reasonable so I decided to give it a try, using a half recipe since I am by myself now.  Well, it raised up a  lot, so I decided to make two small loaves.  Just had a slice of it when it came out of the oven, and it is great.  No swapping of ingredients, either!

I am NOT an experienced bread maker.  In fact, I have only successfully made bread in the past that did not use yeast!  Not anymore! I made this bread yesterday and it is fabulous!  After reading reviews I cut the salt to 2 tsp instead of a tablespoon. Everything else was kept the same. I heated the oven to 300 then turned it off as I was preparing the bread, and put the batter into the oven with a towel over it with the door ajar. It actually rose!!  I was so excited.  I also reviewed other tips, and read that if you push down on the raised loaf and the dimple remains then it is ready to be punched down. My boyfriend said it was the best homemade bread he had ever had. Perfect texture and flavor! Will definitely make it again.

Great recipe! The crust was a little chewy for my taste. Great advice on cutting down on the salt - I only used 2 tsp. I will make this again!

If you're looking for a delicious yeasty white bread then look no further! It's a cinch to make and very delicious. We made and have away bread for days as our Christmas gifts and all were happily received. The only thing I changed in the recipe was reducing the salt top 2 tsp. as suggested by other reviewers. Other than that I followed the recipe. I also used this bread dough to make out of this world cinnamon rolls!

Perfect recipe. Made it by hand using traditional yeast, not in a machine, and it came out tall and light--just as light as bakery or store bought. Some people have found it too salty, but I didn't find it so at all. I'm not going to change this recipe an iota, although I did knead longer. More like 16 minutes. (Note: I'm at high altitude, and it was still perfect.)

This is the best white bread recipe I've ever tried. I made two loaves and a batch of dinner buns today and served the buns with split pea soup. My husband and daughter raved over the buns. Then they had to try the bread and they almost cried ??

I used the full tablespoon of salt but used Himalayan pink salt. It gave the bread a lot of flavour and wasn't too salty. I also used the lard as in the recipe and I think that's key for flavour. Too many white breads taste bland to me. The only changes I made were to use coconut sugar in place of white sugar and I used active dry yeast which I activated in 1/4 cup warm water with a teaspoon of sugar. 

I've been making bread for over 25 years and I can definitely say this is the best white bread recipe I've made yet. This will become my staple.

Came out pasty in the middle but I used dark pans.  Next time I will cut down the temperature by 25 degrees F and will check it at 20 minutes.  If that doesn't work out then I will use foil lined in the pans.

Best bread I have ever made by far! I take it out five minutes early, brush with melted butter and return to the oven to finish baking. It just gives it better flavor.

My dough turned out very tough. I'm not sure what I did wrong. I would love to hear tips and trick to make the dough light and soft like in the video. The bread was good, a little dense though.  It went from super stick to too dense.  I'm sure if I could figure out the dough, the bread would be lighter. Please help!

I subbed butter and used all purpose flour.  I mixed everything in my Kitchen Aid mixer then used the dough hook and kneaded it for 8 minutes.  I followed the rest of the directions except I sprayed a little oil on top of the loaves while they rose in the pan to keep the towel from sticking and I also did a light egg wash before baking.  It turned out delicious!  I've been making bread by hand since I was a child (I was raised making challah) and this is a great easy bread when I need something quick.  It's in my rotation from now on!

I've made this several time and it's a very straightforward recipe for new bread bakers like me. The flavor is delicious and it produces consistent results. However, I'm still having trouble kneading it to the right texture, even if I allow extra time. Also, does anyone know why you preheat to a higher temperature than you bake it at?

OMG! This bread was outstanding . So many white bread recipes to choose from... Look no further this one is the only one you need. I did what most of the reviewers  did and substituted butter for lard and I did put butter over the tops before baking. I was a little leary when I was making the Dough , it was very sticky and I had to add a lot of flour so I could knead it and get it the right consistency, but it came out great. I am so happy to have an easy go to bread recipe. It is so versatile, I can't wait to try rolls and cinnamon swirl bread. Thank you for this great recipe

This makes 2 decent size, nice tasting loaves. I have substituted skim milk for 1 - 1/2 cups of water and it still rises nicely. This is my 'go-to' recipe when I want a change from whole wheat.

This bread was perfect. Not too sweet, light. My son liked that the crust was soft. Only thing I did different was add a cup of water to a pan on the lower rack.

I've never made homemade bread before, so it took me 3 tries to get it to rise.  Then as I was putting it in the oven to cook, somehow I deflated it! Although it wasn't as tall as it should have been.  It was very soft, light, and tasted SO GOOD!  I will be making this bread often.

I love this bread! I did cut down on the salt, 1 teaspoon. I just took the bread out of the oven and hubby is devouring it.  I will continue to use this recipe.

I made this bread for the first time yesterday, and used leaf lard rendered from our own hogs. I've been looking for a sandwich bread to replace store-bought, and this is definitely my pick.  We love this bread!

Just made this bread and it's wonderful. Got a thumbs up from my 11 yr old son. Only change I made was using white wheat flour as it was what I had on hand. This one is a keeper!

This was my first time making bread. I halved the recipe and it turned out great!  I also cut back on the salt  based on others reviews about how they thought there was too much salt. I wish I hadn't though. Next time I make it I will use the correct amount of salt for sure!

I used vegetable oil since I didn't have any of the others in the house, and I also added basil and some black pepper for flavor, it was absolutely wonderful the first loaf was gone in 2 days! I will definitely be making this recipe again, it might just be my go to bread :)

This turned out great, and I've only made bread once in grade 9! It was very easy. Like someone else suggested, in the last 5 min before the bread was fully baked, I brushed the top of the loaves with olive oil and sprinkled a bit of rosemary and oregano on top. Next time I'm going to put a some rosemary and oregano inside the dough.

Confused about the oven temperature. It says set to 425 then bake at 350 for 30 minutes? Do I bake it at 425 for any amount of time or just let it get that hot, place dough in then turn it down to 350 and let it go from from there does 30 minutes?? This bread looks like it will be delicious and I can't wait to makes it!!

Made this a few times, followed the direction exactly except I used butter instead of lard.  Bread tastes great but after it cools it's pretty crumbly.

I love this recipe! I bake and cook all my dishes on an antique wood cook stove and constantly battle the challenge of keeping the temperature steady. I have tried several other recipes (including my own ) and they have all failed me miserably..
Until now! I did not make loaves, but made several kaiser type buns instead. (Tied knots, and tucked ends under. ) I won't use any other recipe from now on.  Thanks for posting this one!

It is great bread, I have no problem with it and make different things with this dough than bread. For me my only down fall is my house is colder (guess drafty) than it should be to raise bread but I make it work. I've tried so many different recipes but this on is for me.  I will continue to use this recipe,   Thanks Danielle

I have substituted butter in place of the lard and it is delicious. I make this bread several times a year.

This bread is awesome. I made it at least 20 times. The only issue with it is that it is somewhat dense. But I still love it, and will continue baking it.

This was the first loaf of bread I've ever made and it was perfect.  Not enough can be said about how easy this recipe was to follow.  Brilliant.

I used butter flavored cisco and made this for homemade stuffing. It was perfect! I didn't make it in a bread loaf since I knew I would be turning it into stuffing so I just used a glass baking dish but it still turned out amazing!

Love it! Could have baked a little longer but I had to rush out of the house to get my son from school. But it still turned out wonderful! I cut the recipe down to make one loaf because it was the last of my flour. My husband and son love it! Lol we are already planning on me making this regularly!

I made this recipe this morning and was trying to get it baked before I had to go to work. So, I used rapid rise yeast which eliminated the 2nd rise but I had a few minutes so I let it rise about 20 min.  the second time. It would be hard to mess this bread up.  I buttered the top for the last 10 min. of baking. Tonight I made toasted sandwiches and it was great!

I've been looking for a good bread recipe, and I think I found it!  I substituted butter for lard, and I also gave the yeast a little time (about 8 minutes) to proof.  I'm not sure if the proofing had anything to do with it, but the rising times might be a little long, because my bread was HUGE haha.
Anyway, great bread, not too time-consuming, and was very flavorful and fluffy in the middle.  I will probably post again regarding how long it lasts before going dry....if it lasts past tonight. :)

This was OK. A bit bland, and had to throw away half of it because it was so tough from all the flour.

I loved this recipe but 1 tablespoon salt is too much.  2 tsp is enough.  I do not know why you preheat the oven so high to begin with if you are going to bake at 375 for 35 minutes.  Interesting.  Most of us bakers have to tweak things a little depending where we are in the world.

I made this recipe with three alterations...I used olive oil instead of lard, halved the amount of salt and I used 3.5 cups white all-purpose flour and 3 cups of whole wheat flour.  It turned out amazing!  30 minutes in the oven was too long.  My loaves were done in about 20 minutes...probably an altitude thing.

Bread is perfect!!  I make them into 12 inch rolls and used as pizza dough. They are wonderful with everything!! I used melted butter instead of the lard, (it's what I had around the house).

Just made this recipe and was somewhat disappointed. 1st rise was perfect, second rise was also perfect like it should be. My problem is that it never rose any higher when baked. I had a loaf of bread that was no higher than the pan. The bread tasted great but the crumb was firm and heavy. Will try it again, I just wish I knew what went wrong.

It could be because I'm new to baking bread, but I found I had to add almost 4 cups of flour (I also added 1 tbsp sugar and 1 tsp salt)! It came out very light and fluffy (which is good) but it was also a little bland. I used regular Crisco instead of lard. Will try again with some more flavoring.

I followed the recipe and thought it turned out great! I used butter flavored Crisco for the lard, as that is what I had on hand. I didn't have to use any extra flour as some reviewers did...and I think it tasted good, not too salty at all. Turned out 2 awesome, beautiful loaves of bread that my family devoured. Will definatley make again. Super easy and quick for homemade bread.

I think it was suposed to be 1 tsp not tbsp. I did it with only a teaspoon and it was fine.  not sure why the recipe asks you to preheat to 425, then bake it at 375. but over all the bread was tasty and is good for the first time bread baker.

Wonderful recipe! I used butter instead of lard and followed the rest to a tee. I ended up with two beautiful loaves and will definitely use this recipe again! Very easy and delicious.

I tried it and it didn't come out the way I expected. The crust was great but the centre was a bit raw. I don't know what I did wrong, I did everything recipe said.

This is actually a really good recipe. We enjoyed the saltiness, however, I would have a tendency to cut the salt by at least 1/3 if not 1/2. Easy-slice, holds up well. Makes good rolls also, although a little dry-you will want extra butter with rolls.

I have cooked this bread twice. I am not too familiar with making bread so the outcome what probably my fault. Both times, I had to add 2 more cups of flour to work it. After adding the prescribed amount of flour, the dough was just way too sticky and unmanageable. Adding the extra flour the bread turned out okay but not fantastic.

Delicious and easy, i wish i had the time to make my own bread for my family everyday, this would be the recipe i would use. Not sure why but it only took about half the time stated to rise at both risings. I will certainly make this bread again.

Baked this bread yesterday. Very good. The only difference was I used Crisco and all purpose flour. 6 cups flour was plenty for the dough and dusting the surface for kneading. Baked at 375 30 minutes. Came out perfect.

Wow. Just perfect, the bread is light and on the inside, golden brown and crispy on the inside. Havfluffy ing some experience making pizza dough, I let the yeast in the water with the sugar for 10 minutes. Use your hands to make this bread, as it's the best way to incorporate the flour. It only took 30 minutes and it was ready. I cut a slice right after I took it out of the oven and it was amazing, can't wait to make sandwiches using this bread.

EDIT: After making it for a third time, I discovered some tricks. First, only put in 6 cups of flour not 6 and a half. Use an electric mixer with dough hooks when mixing in the ingredients, you then only need to knead the dough 5 minutes. 25 minutes in the oven is enough, my 3rd attempt was the most soft and delicious yet.

I use this recipe often.  It's my go to for white bread.  The crust is always  nice and crisp, and the inside is dense and soft.  I always half  the recipe, since I don't need two loaves at once.  Sometimes I substitute butter for the lard.  I also, use 1 teaspoon of salt for the halved recipe.   Before baking, I split the top and pour a tablespoon of melted butter inside the split.  I bake for 30 minutes, and the bread comes out perfect every time.

I loved this recipe. I replaced the lard with coconut oil. I didn't have bread flour and use King Arthur all purpose flour and it came out wonderful. For anyone having problems with stickiness if you're live in an area with high humidity you'll have to adjust your flour/water. The 8 minute kneading is needed.

Very good! I melted butter, infused it with a touch of truffle oil and course salt, five minutes before it was done I brushed it with the butter mixture and grated some great dry sheep cheese on top. Came out great!

Love this recipe! Very easy! I did do a few things different, only because I like to experiment. I bloomed the yeast separately using some whey water from some ricotta cheese I made earlier. I heated up the whey water, took 1 TBSP of the sugar and the yeast and mixed together until the yeast was foamy. Then I mixed using a dough hook in the mixer, and let the dough rise. No problems at all. The dough rose very high, I punched down and divided into 2 loaves. The smell is awesome!! Baked off like nobodies bizness! Absolutely delicious and easy. This is a winner hands down!

This is a wonderful recipe. I live in the high desert, so maybe the dough seemed a bit drier at 5 cups and that's where I stopped incorporating the flour. So in my experience, we went and used 5 cups of flour altogether. We ended up with 2 beautiful loaves of bread!

This recipe is solid, and it's good for a beginner.  I have been baking breaking bread on and off for 15 years so this didn't measure up to the best I've ever made, but it was a good basic recipe. I would encourage people to try it.

This was my first attempt at baking bread and it turned out perfect!! I did use less salt and 1/2 a stick of butter instead of lard.

I loved this recipe - very light and fluffy!  I was able to get a huge loaf plus one shaped more like an italian loaf as well as a pizza out of this recipe - it could easily be halved.  I used vegetable shortening and all purpose flour - came out wonderfully.

excellent traditional recipe.  THE HARDEST PART IS TAPPING IT ON THE BOTTOM TO SEE IF IT IS HOLLOW SOUNDING.

I'll have to try this recipe again and hopefully be able to give it five stars next time. I'm sure it's something I did on my end, but this bread turned out dense with a lumpy top. the dough itself seemed somewhat dry initially to the point I added a bit more water. I'm not sure if I accidentally added too much flour or if I didn't kneed long enough. I'm not an experienced bread maker, but this recipe seemed so easy and fool proof.  My daughter, who loves plane white bread, said it had no flavor. I'm not sure if a bit more sugar is necessary. I didn't mind the denseness, and actually enjoyed the crunchy crust, but it wasn't at all light and fluffy on the inside for me the first time. I'll try again.

This is a good recipe, but following it exactly makes really dense bread. Here are the changes I made to make it nice and fluffy. I used all purpose flour instead of bread flour (AP flour has less protein and makes helps make it fluffy). I also use Highly active yeast instead of regular yeast. I proof the yeast before making the bread. To proof the yeast dissolve it in warm water(120-130 degrees F) with the sugar and let sit for about 10 min until a froth forms on top, then proceed with the recipe. I too used crisco shortening instead of lard(mostly because its what I had). I have a convection oven so when baking I preheat the oven to 350 Degrees F convection bake and bake for 30 min. I hope this is helpful to others using this recipe. (I do plan to try using honey instead of sugar in the future when i make it again ill let you know how it works)

Wow!  Followed the recipe and it was the best white bread I have made.  It was the first time I have ever used lard, so I am guessing that is what made it so great.

I found this recipe today and followed it to a T!  It is so easy to follow and the bread turned out fantastic!  I hadn't made bread by hand for decades, (thnx to the 20th Century and bread machines), but I will sure be making it by hand in the future! Thank you so much for sharing!

Excellent traditional white bread recipe, like my mother used to make. I use all purpose flour, not bread flour (my mother never used bread flour either) and my bread turned out great-twice. 

I know many are using bread flour but it seems completely unnecessary. More expensive and more gluten in bread flour. Follow this recipe using all purpose flour (I use gold medal) and you will have excellent bread. Make sure the warm water for the yeast is neither too hot or too cold-and knead the dough for 8 minutes as the recipe says. Your dough won't rise in a cold place so find a warm corner. Time and temperature in this recipe are exactly right! 

My son thought I bought it from a bakery-it's that pretty and tasty.

Made this with substituting unsalted butter for the lard, and pure raw honey for the sugar.  Turned out FANTASTIC!  Will be keeping this as my all-time white bread recipe.

My whole house smells like heaven, and my husband and I just polished off half of the loaf smothered in Nutella...so obviously it was a hit.

I made it just as the recipe called for, salt and all. No complaints on saltiness here. This is the new go-to bread recipe in our house!

Great tasting, easy and basic white bread. I substitute local honey for the sugar, and veggie or coconut oil for lard. Makes great sandwich bread.

My first bread recipe, and it was fantastic!  Light, fluffy, with great texture and taste, and very very easy to make.  I substituted olive oil for lard, as that's what I had in the house.  Please note, if you're using your new Kitchenaid mixer, this is a double batch and can be too much of a strain on your machine, as I found out the hard way!  Once my mixer was repaired and ready to go again,  I halved the recipe and gave it another shot.  The bread is perfect!  I can't wait to try this with variations such as cinnamon, garlic, fresh herbs, etc.

I tried this recipe because I wanted french toast and didn't have any bread in the house. I think it's amazing. I never use lard I always either use butter or oil and I think that it turns out pretty great. It holds up to making casseroles and french toast upon other things.

Crust is soft enough, inside is fluffy. I reduced the salt to 3/4 T. It is not too sweet, just perfect. I used unsalted butter, and I added 1/4 t. more yeast because I am at 2200 feet elevation. I did no hand-kneading, only used my big KitchenAid mixer. Excellent. This is my new go-to for when I need a break from whole wheat. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This was my first experience baking bread and the recipe was perfect! I followed the instructions exactly as they are listed (and watched the video while I prepared the bread-this really helped!).  It is delicious and not too sweet; my husband loves it too!  Thanks!

This bread recipe was awesomely easy to make.  It only takes about 20 minutes of actual work.  The rest of the time is just waiting on the dough to rise or bake.

Tasty and simple.  Baked all three loaves, then froze two of them.  Later, defrosted and sliced.  Still delicious.

This bread was really good. I used honey in place of the sugar, used grapeseed oil in place of the lard and reduced the salt. I baked at 375 for 30 minutes. Turned out great!

I have tried this recipe several times while living in Nicaragua (Pacific coast).  By the time I have added all the flour, the dough is still usually way to wet & sticky to knead.  FYI kitchen is open air ... there is an onshore salt air breeze & quite high humidity.  I'm just wondering whether I should adjust the water content down or if it is OK to add lots more flour while kneading ?  If I leave the dough for a very long second rise, it usually turns out OK but often quite dry & dense.  Any suggestions would be very much appreciated!!!

This was the first bread recipe I've ever tried, and it's absolutely fantastic!  I've made it four times now, twice as loaves and the other two times I made big buns.  To make buns, grease two 9x13 cake pans with Pam.  After the bread has gone through its first rise, punch the dough down, take it out and form it into a long snake-like shape.  I then cut 18 even pieces with my dough scraper and then form them into somewhat of a ball, but not quite as round as a ball.  I then place 3 rows of 3 in each greased 9x13 pan, for a total of 18 buns.  I then let them rise for another 45 minutes (covered with a wet cloth or plastic wrap), and bake as directed.  They turn out wonderfully! They will be big buns!  Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper!!

This recipe is my base recipe. I change a lot to experminent. This last time I used 2 c. Of WW flour, and added 1/2 a cup of a ground up oat, flax seed, and sunflour mixture. I always use honey instead of sugar, and it is fanastic. My husband who would only eat Sara Lee bread for sandwiches now takes this to work everyday. My only complaint is that I can never get 2 9x5s. I use a 9x5 and a 8x4 and it rises perfectly for sandwich bread.

The recipe doesn't call for kneading the bread before the second rise, but I did anyway (for about 5 minutes or less). Used canola oil instead of lard. Made a great sandwich bread.

No.  I have not had success baking bread. Biggest problems is when I have tried, dough doesn't rise properly.  Possibly house is too cold.
this recipe calls for 2 envelopes of yeast. I have yeast in a jar how much should I use for this recipe?

I can't believe I made bread! It wasn't as pretty as the pictures and I'm sure I messed SOMETHING up but it was edible and my boyfriend gobbled up at least half of the loaf I made. I did substitute AP for bread flour but  that wasn't the problem. I'm sure with a little more practice this recipe will help me make some AWESOME bread! EDIT: I made this again and used the proofing directions on my package of yeast instead of reading the recipe. The bread turned out PERFECT. I will never buy bread from the grocery store again!

A KEEPER - Definitely!  I'm fairly new to bread baking, having received a KitchenAid mixer this past Christmas (my husband, the avid fisherman, hunter, & woodworker said to me as I agonized over the price, "You want the right tool for the job, don't you?" - SOOO glad he did!).  I used the recipe that came with my mixer several times, but like another reviewer, the bread seemed very dense.  THIS one though, is light, fluffy-textured, & flavorful! I did however, make a couple minor changes.

I used butter, all 6.5 cups bread flour, and rapid rise yeast, as that was all I had on hand, and did ALL of the mixing/kneading with the KitchenAid (YES!).  I let it keep kneading on speed 2 for several minutes until it cleaned the sides of the bowl & became quite elastic, and did the first rise for 1 hour in a previously heated & cooled 350* oven (we keep our house fairly cool).  I made the cinnamon loaf using Country Crock's Cinnamon spread instead of butter & a mix of 1/2 cup sugar w/2 tsp cinnamon.  The second rise was also in a warmed oven for 45 minutes.  The reason the white loaf looks a little flat on one end - it stuck to the damp towel & I pulled a bit too quickly when removing it!

Absolutely delicious breads! I'm NEVER using another recipe! Thanks for sharing, Danialle!

One of my "Bucket List" items was to bake a loaf of really good white bread that did not resemble a brick.  After years of trying, I have finally succeeded, thanks to this recipe!  I used my Kitchenaid mixer for the kneading and Crisco instead of lard.  This could not have been easier!  I HIGHLY recommend this recipe!

I used this recepie today as a base to make a seaweed bread. It turned out pretty well. 

The changes I made were:
Used olive oil instead of lard
Substituted ground up nori (the seaweed used to make sushi rolls) for the salt
Substituted 1 cup of flour for flaxseed meal

I also ended up adding a touch more olive oil and water and using less flour than the recipe suggested

I used butter instead of lard and I'm  unsure as to how old one of the packets of yeast was. My bread didn't rise well the 2nd time so I got a shorter, denser loaf than intended but it's still yummy. I'm going to try again with new yeast and maybe use Crisco shortening instead. Maybe less salt too - tasted fine but that was an awful lot of salt.

Best bread I've made so far! 

I used a mix of white whole wheat flour and unbleached plain flour with a bit of vital wheat gluten. I also replaced the lard with olive oil.

Hand-shaped and scored for a more rustic loaf, pressed some rosemary on top, and brushed with butter at the end. Amazing!

We love this recipe; its our 3rd time making it.  Instead of halving it (only have 1 loaf pan) we made 1 huge loaf and baked it for 28 minutes on a cookie sheet.  It was AMAZING! The texture was perfect and it looked like one of those big artisan loaves you buy in the bakery.  The 6 of us (4 adults, 2 kids) ate all of it and we're going to make it like this again tomorrow.  Try making a large loaf with no bread pan, you won't regret it!!!

Tried this recipe today, (I usually use the Amish white bread on this site)and I loved it!!! This is a much softer loaf inside.  This will be my new "go to" white bread recipe!  Thanks!

I tried this recipe three times. I only succeeded once. The other times the dough didn't raise. It was very good the one time I managed to make it right.

This bread is by far the easiest and tastiest recipe I have tried as of yet! My kids love it and my husband cant wait for it to cool down before its tore open and devoured! I occasionally add a few Tbs of Honey to the dough and top it off with a honey drizzle for a sweeter 'with coffee' version.  Thank you!!

So good!! I made a couple changes. I dissolved the sugar and yeast in 1/2 cup warm water and then used 2 cups of  potato water for the balance. I also use bacon drippings as the fat and cut it into a cup of the flour before adding to the wet mixture. Best success I have ever had with bread.!!

At 6 1/2 cups of flour, the dough was way too sticky.  At 8 cups the recipe turned out beautifully ( 2 x 900 gram loaves).  I started second guessing my measurement, so made it again, this time using 7 1/2 cups for a dough that was still sticky.  Also turned out fine.  I am only giving 3 stars because of the adjustments (required for me).

Easy and very fine texture! I used 3 tablespoons of sugar in the yeast mixture, and 1 teaspoon of sea salt instead of regular salt. Tastes great! This is now my go-to recipe for bread!

I halved this recipe and threw it in my bread machine on "basic."  It's great.  My 4-year-old loves it.  It tastes a bit like sourdough, which for me, is a good thing.  I used melted butter instead of lard.  I was concerned by how the top of the bread looked when it came out - it looked like it was going to be soft and doughy.  But it wasn't - just-right on the inside and crisp crust on the outside.  Took me about 5 minutes to make, which is the best part of all...

Yummy bread - great consistence and outside was nice crust.  This is a keeper.  I cut recipe in half just to make one loaf and I used Crisco instead of lard but will try lard in the future just to see which taste I prefer.

Call Guiness Book of World Records! I have never seen two loaves of bread go so quick. It has to be a record time.
A delicious bread. I did however had to with hold about 3/4 cup of flour. Could not work it in. 
I have also used this recipe for dinner rolls and pizza.

omg ... love baking homemade breads ... reminiscent of my childhood ...the smell and the feeling that all is right in this world.....

love this simple recipe ... half'd it ...however because I reside on my sailboat ... it did not rise, too cold ...so I used my heating pad during the pan rise sequence and it turned out beautiful .....

delicious...... french toast the next morning and ham sandwiches for lunch....

I highly recommend this simple recipe for homemade white bread.....

Great bread! I think this will be my base bread recipe from now on. I made one regular white and the other I added 1/3 cup Vermont white cheddar powder and 3/4 teaspoon onion powder. Both loaves were wonderful.

So easy and super yummy! This bread turned out beautiful, I may never buy from the store again! FYI- when looking through ingredients I only had all purpose flour on hand, not bread flour like recipe suggested, and it still turned out great!

Excellent bread, excellent instructions!  Just be sure to oil the SIDES of the bread pan, including the RIMS, because this bread will rise over them and stick if you don't.  Enjoy it!!  Thanks, Danialle for exactly the white bread recipe I was looking for: flaky crust, tender inside, great taste!!

I've made this twice now, and my fiancee polished off one batch in a day.  This makes an amazing bread, and it's easy to pull together without a machine.  I've had a lot of fun experimenting with homemade breads, and this is my favorite recipe.

This is a great bread recipe!!  I used margarine instead of lard and 1/2 Tblsp of salt.  The loaves came out perfectly!!  I'm a mother of 5 and with 2 playing basketball, we are on the road all the time and money can be tight!  Making homemade bread is a tiny step in saving money!  My kids gobbled up all the yummyness of this bread!!!  Thank you Danialle for sharing this recipe!!  You're awesome!!!

Very good bread. My family loved and two loaves only stay at home for a couple days. This is a very easy recipe. If you concider what good bread cost at the store this is less expensive by 50% or better. The effort to make is very easy with a Kitchen aide mixer.

This is a great simple bread. I got tired of store-bought and wanted to try to bake something, so this was the first one up. First time I did it, I didn't read the directions on the "rapid rise" yeast and activated the old fasioned way. It came out tasting good but I didn't let it rise enough and it was a little dense and crumbly. Second time, I use half King Arthur whole wheat, kneaded more, added more sugar, layered/rolled in cinnamon and raisins and it was PERFECT. Sight chew, fluffy, moist... I mean perfect. It has a very nice crust as well. I'll play with additional ingredients more as it seems difficult to mess up. Thanks for sharing the recipe... and for the ego boost!

This bread turned out exactly as described, delicious with a very light center with crunchy crust. Good for sandwiches and makes the most perfect toast!!
The dough was very easy to work with too. I used butter instead of lard, replaced 1 tbsp of water with an egg yolk + half a tsp of lemon juice. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!! Definitely a keeper!!

I know there are a lot of ratings already, but I think it bears repeating.  This was great.  This was the second bread that I have ever made and it is divine.  I only had enough ingredients for one loaf and will be heading to the store to get more shortly.  I intended this loaf for sandwiches at school and only have a half loaf left.  It has only been out of the oven for 30 minutes.  Great, great recipe, easy for beginners.

I followed the recipe exactly except for substituting butter for the lard.  The bread was a definite winner - I kept one loaf and gave one to my mom who then called me for the recipe.  You can't go wrong with this bread.  I do suggest rapid rising yeast for quicker prep time.

This is a delicious bread, although it baked unevenly and was doughy. I halved the recipe and baked it in a loaf pan and though it tasted good, again it was doughy and a bit dense. I will make this in my bread machine next time.

LOVE IT!!! First Time making Bread today and it was as easy as pie!! Like others, instead of lard I used Becel. I don't think I will ever buy store bought bread again!! There is just no comparison. I think I will do what another reviewer said and Bake a couple loaves each Sunday. :)

Excellent bread. I make all of our family's bread and this is the recipe used. One word of caution for beginners, find a video on kneading and follow that. I started using the dough in place of a heavy bag and my bread came out dense & flat. One of the "biggies" in ensuring a successful loaf of bread is proper kneading.

This is a FANTASTIC recipe! I'm a complete bread-baking rookie (as in, this was my first time ever making bread) and using this recipe I managed to create perfect, melt-in-your-mouth, fluffy on the inside, crispy on the outside white bread. The only thing I changed was the lard, which I replaced with butter. My finished product looks exactly like the picture, and tastes phenomenal. I'm going to have to exercise a remarkable amount of self-restraint to prevent myself from eating the whole loaf!

Yummy, buttery, bready goodness. The few things I changed was whole milk instead of water, butter instead of lard and some egg wash on top. So simple- I will never buy store bread again!

This a wonderful bread for beginners. I substituted butter for the lard, otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It has a very good crust and soft center. The only problem I had was my dough did not rise as much as I thought it would, but I think thats because my yeast is a little old. I will definately make this again with fresh yeast.

What a great recipe. Depending on the humidity I adjust the water or flour content.  I use this recipe to make all kinds of bread, including round loafs. My wife loves them!

A-MA-ZING!!! My last batch of bread turned out very doughy, but this recipe was easy and it came out just like in the photo! I actually undercooked it five minutes, and it was perfect!

YUM!!!!! Great bread! I had to decrease the temp to 330 degrees because my oven cooks really hot, but other than that, I followed the recipe & it turned out beautiful!

Oh my, so good!! I had to start making almost every bread type because buying from the store was starting to taste fake, and some of the preservatives in the bread were making us sick because of a disorder. First time making bread and it went soooo fast. Usually bread just sits and goes bad in my house! Hats off to you.

Perfect! I used half butter/half shortening and the taste was awesome! Also split the recipe to do one loaf and some rolls - my husband said they were the best rolls he's ever had!

This is my favorite bread recipe!  I take a tiny bit of the salt out to make it rise a bit more and add dill and rosemary to make it aromatic.  A perfect white bread recipe!

I've tried making bread a couple times now, and this recipe was my most successful attempt yet! My bread actually looks just like the photo. I followed the recipe to a t (used olive oil for lard, per Danielle's instructions) and it turned out perfectly. Thanks for this! I might try it with whole wheat flour next time--anyone tried that yet?

This was my very 1st attempt at making any type of bread. I cut the recipe in 1/2 since I wasn't sure how it would come out & didn't want to make 2 loaves. The only change I made was that I used butter instead of the shortening. I also brushed melted butter on the top the last 5 minutes like some suggested. It came out perfect & I was so happy the 1st time was so easy!

A wonderful and easy bread recipe.  I made sure to use the "proofing" instructions on the packages of yeast before proceeding with the rest of the recipe.  The dough had a velvety texture and was very easy to knead and work.  It came out nice and high and I followed one reviewer's advice and brushed melted butter on it about five mins. before it was completely finished.  I do recommend placing loaves in plastic bags as soon as they've cooled as there are no preservatives in the recipe and the bread will change texture quickly.

Excellent bread!  I used vegetable shortening instead of lard and added my own personal touch to make our favorite bread, vegetable bread, that is served at a local restaurant.  After adding 3 cups of flour, I added 3/4 cup dehydrated vegetable flakes softened with enough water to equal 1 1/2 cups of vegetables.  Then I slowly added the remaining flour to the mixture.  The bread is so scrumptous served with a hearty soup or stew.  The smell of it is incredible!

Breadmaking never interested me too much; this recipe was my first attempt at baking standard bread.  Made very good bread with not too much effort.  I found it a little dense, but perhaps I should have allowed more time to rise because of altitude...not quite sure how that plays into the yeast equation.

This is probably the easiest recipe I've ever used for bread...and will now be the only! I was able to make two smaller loaves in my (smallish) bread pans, plus a good size round loaf I baked on a stone. Thanks so much for sharing!! :O)

For the first time, I have made bread and it rose to a nice round loaf -- just like the picture!  Can't wait to try it, will be having it with some beef stew tonite.   Great for a rainy day like today!  The only thing about this recipe was that you needed to cover the dough with a damp cloth and let the dough rise for an hour.  It did just that; however, the dough stuck to my damp dish towel!!!!  I also didn't know why you had to preheat the oven at 425 degrees when you bake it for 30 minutes at 375 degrees??

This is the best bread recipe ever!!! I have also use this recipe to make cinnamon swirl bread.  Just roll it out after the first rise spread melted butter and cinnamon and sugar on it. Then roll it tightly and place it in the loaf pans and do the second rise then bake.  Amazing French Toast bread!!!

This turned out exactly as I hoped it would. It's light, fluffy, makes wonderful sandwich bread and french toast. The recipe that came with my stand mixer turned out to be very heavy and dense. This one however, is a keeper. I'm sure that I will be making this again next week. Thank you so much!!!

WONDERFUL!
I halved the recipe and used my bread machine...I bake with lard so having it is never an issue.  
It worked GREAT in my machine...a perfect loaf of bread.  I didn't change a THING either.
CRUSTY on the outside and moist on the inside.  Reminds me of being in "Amish" country and stopping at a farm where the local ladies sell baked bread...My husband also remarked on how good this was THEN I told him it was a new recipe I tried.  It will be in my forever book that I am working on.  MANY THANKS for sharing this one with us!

Absolutely wonderful!  It brought back memories of learning to bake as a child at my grandma's.  It tastes just like I remembered hers to taste.  It rose better than most bread recipes I've tried, and nothing beats it right out of the oven with butter and preserves slathered on it!  Thanks for sharing!

I make this bread all the time. I turns out every time. I add a little honey and cinnimon to the dough to give it some extra flavor.

Since I've spotted your recipe, I've made it twice.  It tasted very good both times and I thank you very much for sharing it.

This is a great bread recipe.  Turns out great every time.  The only problem is, my mom said it didn't do well with sandwiches.  I've just been using mine as toast or plain.  I will definately make over and over again.

My first try at bread and this turned out great.  I split the top and coated with a honey/butter mixture before baking. This gave the crust a sweet crispy flavor.  Thaks for a great recipe!
