I normally go for the recipes with high ratings and pictures, but every once in a while I'll try a low numbered one and I'm glad I did this time. Followed this to the tee and it turned out just how I like potato salad, not too mustardee and not too creamy and sweet, just perfect. Give it a shot, I did and I'm glad for it.

I loved this recipe! I didn't add the black olives, but i did add the pepperoncinis. One thing that I was wondering before making this and would like to clarify for anyone else contemplating this recipe is that the pepperoncinis did NOT make the salad spicy at all! Instead, they added the PERFECT ammount of flavor(and I used pretty spicy pepperoncinis). The recipe didn't say what to do with the peppers, so I diced them finely and removed the seeds, and it was gorgeous! My family has zero tolerance for spicy food, and they loved it! This is easily the best potato salad recipe I have ever come across. For best results, refrigerate overnight.

Very, very good. I made this early this morning and let it sit and marinate for the rest of the day, until dinner. I used a double dose of the Dry Ranch Seasoning mix from this site(minus the salt and plus dill) instead of prepared ranch and used chopped pickles instead of relish. I don't have celery seed, so I omitted it and added a couple chopped  stalks of celery. This recipe didn't specify which kind of onion to use, so I used a quarter of a red I had on hand. You really don't need 1 1/2 tsp. of salt in this, the flavor in this salad is just fine with just a couple nice shakes. Very flavorful.

This is a great potato salad.  It is not too mustardy and the ranch gives it a zing.  I am not giving it a 5 star because as written it is not my favorite.  I am giving it a 4 star because it is darn good and deserves the rating.  I am so tired of people giving a recipe a 1 star rating when they have not tried the recipe.  But yet they cut it down because it has a high fat content.  These people need to back off.  I have lost 177 lbs without surgery.  I do not need to have someone lower a rating on a recipe because they can't handle the fat.  Better they should cut down on their portions.  It is not about the fat it is about putting down the fork.  So for those of us who can practice portion control and know that fats can contribute flavor, give this one a try.  It is fairly traditional with a bit of a twist.  ENJOY it.  I did.

I have been searching FOREVER for a really good potato salad recipe.  Finally, I found one!  I made it early in the morning and let it refrigerate for about 8 hours before we ate--it was really good.  However, the next day was just fantastic.  If you have the time, try to make this a day ahead.  One note, one reviewer stated that the recipe was too salty (even though she didn't follow the original recipe!)...it does seem salty before you refrigerate it, but once the flavors blend, everything evens out.  If you're worried about salt, I'd cut it in half and then check before you serve.  Thanks Cheftini :)

This is the best potato salad ever! I did add the pepperoncini's and I did not add the black olives.  This is so good because it's more mustardy unlike the typical potato salad with too much mayonnaise flavor.  Gets better tasting as leftovers too...thanks!

I now have the recipe for potato salad that I've looked for all my life.  This was fantastic!!!  Thank you SO much for sharing.  All those who ate it, loved it!  Use a red onion to add color.  Don't do the potatoes as recommended, rather peel potatoes and cube, then boil.  Cooking time takes less and they cook more thoroughly.  Put in the fridge to cool as well as the eggs.  Then assemble ingredients.

I've never made potato salad,  and decided to make this one for a company 4th of July picnic.  Everyone loved it.  Fantastic recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly but left out the two optional ingredients.

Yum Yum! Instead of relish I added chopped pickles. I added red bell pepper and peas. I added olives but no pepperoncinis.

This potato salad recipe is delicious! The test of many dishes for me is how much is left after a pot-luck, and not much of this was left at all (and that's only because there was a plethora of food there). I didn't add either the pepperoncini or the black olives. This dish needs some color so, I threw in a handful of dried parsley flakes and about 1 TBL. of dried dill weed. It only added to the flavor and presentation!

This is almost exactly like I make my potato salad, however, I haven't used the pepproccinis, but I do add about 1 cup diced celery and use Lawry's seasoned salt.  I have always had great compliments on my potato salad and it's really great to know someonelse makes one that's liked so well. I actually have to give my grandmother the accolades as this was her recipe and she was a fantastic cook.....

I always figured celery seed was optional, which it is, but these are the ingredients I used when making this commercially. :D It's super delicious. I changed red potato to russet, and I don't know why the directions say this...but you should never "bring water to boil" with said ingredients already inside. WAIT for the water to be boiling, then put the eggs/potatoes in. It's a form of stewing, not boiling, if you don't wait for the peak temp. Just sayin'.

I have made this for many years, the only comment I have is to save time you can cook potatoes and eggs together, for the 15 to 20 min. works out well.

I used five pounds of red potatoes which is more than the 10 potatoes called for in the recipe and I had plenty of dressing.  I used the pepperoncini but skipped the black olives.  I only used 3/4 teaspoon additional salt, if that, because I used ranch dressing made from a packet which I find very salty.  After I made the salad it tasted too salty and not all that special.  The next day, however, after the flavors had a chance to meld, the dressing tasted perfect and I really liked this salad.  The pepperoncini do not make the dish spicy but just had that little extra something.  I don’t think that anyone even noticed them because I diced them very small.  This is a darn good potato salad that I will definitely make again.

With the help from allrecipes I was able to calculate this recipe for 200 for my daughters wedding reception.  I was able to buy all the ingredients perfectly and had no waste and running to the store for more ingredients. I made this in quadruple batches and put in large zipper bags and laid them flat.  My mother was a little worried about the taste because it didnt have celery, but I told her with all the positive reviews it  had to be be good!  We kept licking our fingers-YUMMY. Did not add peppronicins and used russet potatoes.  EXCELLENT.

Made this for college football day.  Hands down the best potato salad I've ever had.  Everyone loved it.  I did not add the olives, but I will try it that way next time.  I minced the peperoncini (to disguise it from my son).  I was worried about the ranch dressing because it seems like everything these days is "over ranched" but it added just the right amount of spice and you would never guess there was ranch dressing in this potato salad.  I can't wait to make it again!

Very good. Glad to have a recipe that I know I can go to that will work. Let is chill overnight and added extra eggs as a personal preference. Took it to a family day military event and it was gone before I even got into line for food.

I AGREE this is the best potato salad.  I was out of prepared Ranch dressing but I had a powdered pkg of ranch and sprinkled in about 1 1/2 tsp and added 1/2 c sour cream to sub for it.  I had blk olives to use up so I added them --very good.  When i made this I couldn't find the recipe I was looking for so I settled for this one and I am so glad it did! This is my new favorite.

This was very good potato salad. I used 3 dill spears instead of relish, 2 celery stalks instead of celery seed and added some pickle juice (didn't measure but maybe 1/4 cup).  Also peeled and cubed the potatoes before boiling, after draining them I rinsed them thoroughly with cold water to cool them off so I didn't have to wait for them to cool in fridge.  Next time I'll cut back the mayo & add pickle juice. Overall it's very good potato salad, thanks!

an excellent mayo-based potato salad with a nice tangy flavor. made it the night prior and i think that helped punch up the flavor. i used canola mayo to lighten it up (stuff's great. tastes as close to full-fat mayo as you'll ever get). almost the entire batch got consumed...18 guests...everyone tried it...some guests only ate the potato salad. keeper recipe.

Ok was skeptical about the ranch dressing.  All I had in the house was bacon ranch and it came out delicious!  I also changed the salt to 1 tsp of kosher salt, added 2 tbs of sugar and used sweet pickle relish instead.  Fantastic!  This is going to be my new "go to" potato salad.  And trust me...I am picky!

This is one of the best potato salad recipes I've come across and I think it's the combo of mayo & ranch dressing with dill relish that does it.  I've done the salads with Italian dressing on the potatoes first then mayonnaise, or just mayo with mustard.  But this one is tops.  I use a combination of potatoes- some Yukon Gold and some red because I find their texture is different and adds interest to the salad.  I didn't add celery seed because I don't care for it.  I always add celery to my potato salads, but didn't on this one because it didn't call for it, but I thought it might taste like it was missing something.  I don't think it did.  I liked it just the way it was.  Thanks for the recipe!  I've already made it 3 times!

I decided to try this recipe because I don't enjoy potato salad with vinegar.  I made it for an extended family event and everyone raved!  My older brother is known for his cooking skills and my dad said the potato salad I made was better than his.  No changes made to the recipe.  Used both optional ingredients and it was delicious!

Best potato salad I've ever made. Adjusted for 4 servings and used small red potatoes and left the skin on, and left out the olives. This will be my potato salad recipe from now on.

This recipe is very close to the one my mom has used for years, except we did not use the ranch dressing, pikcle relish, celery seed or the optionals.  We did also put in sugar to taste.  It is a family favorite.  I use her recipe but add dried dill or dill leaves.   Susan

I have made potato salad about 4x and every time I dislike the recipes I try. I finally found something I love. I just added a little sugar and used half the onion but otherwise kept the recipe the same (w/o the optional ingredients). At first I thought there wouldn't be enough creaminess but it ended up being perfect. Quite creamy -- how I like it.

Absolutely  LOVED this.  I did leave out the eggs (forgot all about them until it was too late) and celery seed (didn't have any) and it was still great.  I was wary about putting in the chopped olives and pepperoncini (I'm from Georgia and we are VERY picky about our potato salad) as these ingredients seemed unusual but they were perfect. The recipe makes a pretty large bowl of tater salad and it was gone in two days, which is saying alot since two out of my family of five "don't like potato salad", I caught them both eating HUGE portions!  Definitely a keeper and will make again and again!

I'm not a potato salad person but this recipe is one that I really liked. I made this at the last moment to serve with slow cooked barbeque chicken (Zesty Slow Cooker Chicken Barbecue). It was good but ended up being 10 times better the next day. I didn't have relish so I chopped up some pickled cucumbers (Adrienne's Cucumber Salad) and added red and green bell peppers to it also. I will be making this again and have already shared it with family.

Awesome potato salad. Did not use eggs or black olives (not a fan), but did use the pepperoncini. Really enjoyed the little bit of spice they added.

Excelent recipe! I didn't have red potatoes so I used the russets I had on hand.  Added the olives. Used finely chopped green onions to get it past the onion haters. Everyone (all 20 people) loved the potato salad! No leftovers! Dang!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is delicious! Very flavorful. I used finely chopped dill pickles (and a splash of pickle juice) rather than the relish but apart from that didn't change a thing. Next time, I will add more pickles, more pepperoncini, and possibly more olives, too. I think that might just make it a 5-star potato sald!

This potato salad is the best I have ever made or tasted! One trick is to let it sit for several hours or overnight to let the ranch dressing flavor mix with the others or it won't taste right. I did leave out the olives and pepperoncini because my family doesn't like these two. Try it, you'll love it!

I made this recipe pretty much as recommended and it is fermenting in the fridge as I type. I had a couple of sneak preview bites before I put it into hibernation overnight and if this is going to taste better tomorrow then I guess I will be in heaven on my lunch break... Thanks much it's a great recipe!

Made as directed, with one change, we left the skins on the red potatoes for a nice color addition. It is a very good starter, but far, FAR too salty. I was hesitant to even add it in the first place, but I always like to try a recipe as written before I pass judgement. in my opinion, drop the salt out of the mix entirely, with both the ranch dressing and dill relish, there really is no need to add the additional line item. 4/5, only thing that knocks it down is the saltiness.

I found my last potato salad recipe!!!!! I love this, I will add more mustard next time for personal preference but tasted amazing with what the recipe called for. I also only had sweet relish and lite mayo on hand and I wouldn't change a thing next time! And I agree with others, the next day it is best, two days even better, so try to make it beforehand if possible.

AMAZING! My father hates potato salad and says this is so good, I could enter it into a contest! I did use my own substitutions - I used dill ranch, vidalia onion, green onion, and omitted the olives. Everyone asked for the recipe.

Holy mother of God. . . this potato salad is in-freaking-credible. 
Made a couple of unintentional modifications because (apparently), I can't really read very well.
--used Kraft Peppercorn Ranch dressing because that's what I had. Due to it's pretty solid pepper level, I eliminated the pepper that the recipe called for since I felt like it was already covered.
--misread the recipe & used celery salt instead of celery seed. Don't know if it's the same thing but it tastes just fine so I'm not going to go out & buy one more thing for my overburdened spice rack.

Intentional modifications:
--husband hates chunks of onion so I just used onion powder (though I probably could have left it out altogether). Used around a teaspoon, maybe half a tablespoon...
--left out the salt. between the ranch dressing & the use of celery salt, this tasted fine to me without adding the extra sodium content so I went ahead & left it out. I would recommend waiting until the end & only salting if you feel necessary.
--and I left out the optional stuff as well like most of the people here.
Once again, Allrecipes & its awesome home chefs leads me to the recipe promised land. Hallelujah, can I get an amen?!

Was very good and very easy.  I had never made potato salad before, but this one was great.  Got lots of compliments, I made it just as was, except I had green onions.  I may use a tad less mayo and mustard next time.

My husband really loved this potato salad!  I used my egg slicer to slice the eggs and potatoes because we like chunky potato salad like they make in New York.  It doesn't taste like the New York deli's make, but its good!

I made this potato salad because it looked interesting, and it did not disappoint! Our company went back for seconds, and thirds...An exceptional recipe, and it seems to get better the next day, if it lasts that long.

I am picky about my potatoe salad and this was perfect.  It was a good balance of egg, potatoe and all the other ingredients.  Only thing I changed the 2nd time I made it was less onion but you can do that to taste.  Really good and will make again.

I used this recipe and it was so yummy! I did make a few minor changes, though. I boiled my potatoes in water, chicken broth, Meditteranean sea salts/seasonings, and Herbes de Provence. The potatoes had a delicious flavor. Also, to the salad I added diced bell peppers, diced celery, and toasted almonds. To the dressing, I added Herbes de Provence, dash of balsamic vinegar, plain yogurt, pinch of sugar, garlic powder, thyme, oregano, Meditteranean seasoning, Mirin rice wine, ground rosemary/garlic seasoning, and a little bit of cinnamon. Yummy! :)

I was a little skeptical about the ranch dressing but I have to say this was really good. I couldn't even taste the salad dressing. I didn't use the pepperoncini's  because I don't like them but I followed the rest of the recipe to the T. Thank you for sharing.

Good, not great.  Didn't think all the flavors penetrated the potatos enough even after refridgerating overnight.  Next time, i will cut the potatoes into even smaller bites.

Great as is.  But, I make it all the time and have found some improvements with a few things.  Reduce salt by half to add room for 1 1/2 t of celery salt.  Double the amount of eggs.  Add 1 t. chipotle pepper Tabasco sauce.  Also caramelize the onion.

I have used Allrecipe.com for about a year now and signed up so I can rate this recipe. It was "The Best Potato Salad" as advertised! I used sweet relish instead of the dill pickle relish, no black olives becasue of preference, and DO NOT leave out the Pepperonicis. I had no idea what Pepperoncini Peppers were untill this recipe and I feel like a void in my life has been filled! I think I ate more of them then i put in the salad.

I used more dill pickle relish, no celery seed (didn't have any) no pepperoncini, nor black olives and used 1 tsp salt.  Did add 4 pieces of chopped celery.  When I made the mix, thought it had too much mustard, but when finished with the recipe, it wasn't.

I was searching for potato salad recipes ran across this one sounded so easy and good so I decided to try it. I am so glad I did this was a really good recipe easy to make but I did add my own things as well but the dressing is wonderful, I used bacon ranch dressing in one and in the other just ranch, shared with neighbors and they both said that the bacon ranch dressing one was better..You can not go wrong using this recipe..thanks

Cheftini should change the name to THE WORLDS BEST POTATO SALAD. This recipe is what made me register to Allrecipes.com I saved this recipe to my favorites on my mac book and took two weeks,but I decided to try it out today. I went to super market and gathered everything I would need and this recipe turned out fantastic. The optional stuff I left out,but this recipe was a huge success. Please excuse my profile photo as I just returned home. I got two weeks with family before I head back out and I started watching a show on tv and I loved it and thats where photo came from lol anyway this was amazing. Thank You as I was looking for something to cook for my lady pot luck at church AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING TY

The BEST potato salad I have ever had. Made it for a BBQ and received rave reviews from everyone even the kids. Think I can say this is better than my mom's. Followed the recipe exactly and made it a day a head like what was recommended in other reviews.  I tasted it right after I made it and it was really salty. But after letting it sit over night it was the key. Also stays nice and creamy doesn't get dry.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this potato salad- I doubled everything but didn't add optionals- I FORGOT the pepperoncinis and put whole slice of egg as a garnish with more paprika so didn't want to stir in the pepperoncinis when I remembered them! I added two big stalks of celery shopped fine cuz that's how my family likes it and used chopped pickles cuz I didn't have relish.I didn't think you could beat Miracle Whip and mustard for this salad- I like this MUCH better! thanks! I wonder why Beverly Furton gave it one star when she said it was  almost exactly like heres - she keeps making yucky potato salad? ha

This potato salad is a winner.  Just like I remember it from my mom.  Don't skimp on the relish, it really added something special to the flavor.  This will be my keeper recipe for Potato salad forever.

Best potato salad ever. I don't use the optional ingredients (I am a vegetarian) nor do I add the celery seed. It tastes amazing, but does require a bit of time.

This recipe reminds me of my mothers which I really miss.  I loved this recipe... especially the banana peppers at the end.  It gives it added texture and zing. I do use light ranch dressing... just to cut back on the fat a bit.  You can't tell the difference.

I LOVE this potato salad! I didn't have any relish so I did the next best thing and minced some jar dill pickles instead and it came out wonderfully. Aside from the relish (which I saved a trip to the store on), all of the ingredients were already on hand considering we eat a lot of salad and cold sandwiches for lunch! So easy to prepare and well worth the wait while the flavors blended in the fridge.

I have made this twice.  People love it.  The ranch really makes a difference.  The only thing I left out was the pepperocini's because I didn't have any.  I left the rest of the recipe as-is.  You will not be sorry, this really is the BEST potato salad!

This recipe is delicious! I do not add the eggs, pepperoncini or black olives, and it still tastes wonderful.

I use 3/4 cup of natural yoghurt and 1/4 of a cup of mayonaise in place of the whole 1 cup of mayo, and it turns out just as good!

Love this potato salad! It's a favorite in our house and the only recipe I use anymore. I do add the pepperoncini but have never put the olives in, only because I don't ever seem to have any when I make it. I use celery salt instead of seed. I've had to use sweet relish a couple of times because it's what I had and it's still delicious. Another add in that is good is a little bit of crumbled bacon. I agree with a lot of the other reviews though, peel and cube the potatoes before cooking.

Excellent recipe!! I would suggest though that if you want them without the skins...then peel them before cooking! Very time consuming.

This is delicious!  Ranch dressing makes everything better!  I don't understand why you would cook the potatoes before you peel and cube them, though.  It's so much easier to peel, cube then cook.  Also, run cold water over potatoes to speed cooling.  I didn't use peppers or olives or celery seed, and it still turned out fantastic.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

This is definately a keeper. I didn't add the optional ingredients, but it was great without them. I have now made this several times for my family and they LOVE it! I am not a fan of ranch dressing so I was afraid to try it; however the combination of all the ingredients makes this Potato Salad the best...

Wow, made recipe as wriiten with everything including the pepperoncinis, but did omit olives.  
Great recipe, definately better the next day!
I sampled it immediately after all ingredients were added, it was "okay", but left it overnight, it went from "okay", to " great"

My Mother-in-Law insists on turning family potlucks into a potato salad competition. No matter who brings the potato salad, she also brings one too "just in case" (implying no one will like the other person's salad). Which is especially annoying since hers is very bland. Soooo.... I brought this one to the last family campout and EVERYONE loved it, even those that supposedly don't like onions or mustard in their potato salad (as claimed by MIL). So my bowl was emptied right away, hers sat around for the flies!!! Can you see my smug, satisfied smile?

Really yummy!  I used sweet relish for my hubby and green onions instead of white.  Omited the pepperoncini and black olives.  Ranch gave it that extra bit of flavor!

My first attempt at potato salad!  This was delicious.  I made it a second time for a family dinner and everyone loved it.  It is traditional in taste, but has a little more zip.  I made it to the recipe the first time, only choosing not to include the olives.  I found it did need a little crunch and added about 1/4 c. finely chopped celery the second time.  Perfect!

This really is "the best" potato salad. The addition of the ranch dressing keeps it from being too mayonaisse-y or too mustard-y. Served this at a fish fry and got rave reviews.

Made this potato salad again according to the directions. Tasted a little salty, but put it in the fridge for about 2.5 hours and the salty taste was gone. For those who don't like a 'sweet' tasting potato salad, this is the best I have made so far.

Very good recipe. I had no black olives, didn't miss them and added chopped celery for crunch as others have stated here. Only things I changed in the recipe were those two. Will keep recipe on file.

OH.MY.GOD! The best potato salad I have ever had. My mom, who has been the one who always made the potato salad in the family just flipped over this salad! It was just sooo good! The only thing I did differently was instead of celery seed I used chopped celery. I didnt have celery seed @ home. Plus I omited the pepperoncini's -- no one cares for them at my house. This is now THE potato salad that is going to be made from now on!

Excellent potato salad!  Best I have ever had!  Thank you for the wonderful recipe.  I added a little bit of crumbled bacon to it once it was done on the top, and everyone raved about how good it was.

I make this for the guys I work with every Friday.  Without exception, everyone who eats it swears it's the best they've had.  Skip the olives, add a pinch of cayenne powder, and mince the onions and pepperoncinis very finely.

I halved this recipe, we are just a family of 4. The amount of dressing this yields is perfect, no need to add more later. I also used actual celery instead of the seed and added red bell pepper for more color and crunch. The only thing I'd change is the dill pickle relish - my brother asked me if I made the dressing with pickle juice! Overall, it tasted OK. It's a good starter recipe - with plenty of room for adding your own flavors/ingredients.

Here's a great speed tip, I made a triple recipe for a large crowd. After the spuds and eggs were ready to cut, I put them through my hand french fry potato maker, it cut both the eggs and the spuds perfectly (you just have to cut them to size lenghwise), it made it so fast and easy. Everybody loved the salad!

This was a huge hit when I made it for labor day, even my brother who normally hates potato salad, loved it.  I modified it slightly by adding real bacon bits and using only 1/4 cup hidden valley ranch dressing and then I added a little over 1/4 cup of whipped cream because that always made my grandmothers potato salad.  I didn't do the pepperoncini or relish or celery seed, and I only did about 2/3 of a small onion.  It was perfect!

I found this potato salad very, very good. However, it is a tad too salty. I followed the recipe exactly but did not add the optional olives. Other than that, everything was the same as written and definitely I would reduce or even eliminate the salt. My husband was expecting a sweeter potato salad, so this one dissapointed him. However, it is very good and has a great combination of ingredients that work very well together.

Everyone has a vegetable they don't like -- mine is celery. Instead of celery, I used fresh cubed cucumbers to give it that satisfying crunch. The cucumber really elevates the dish by giving it a fresh, clean flavor and texture component.

Halve the salt! This recipe was awesome and very much like the potato salad my grandfather used to make! I omitted the 1/2 cup ranch dressing for 1/3 cup Mayo; also added 1 stalk chopped Celery. ALSO try 1 finely chopped Jalapeno pepper (de-seeded) for a nice kick! :)

I personally didn't care for the relish added with the flavor of ranch. Seemed to clash for me. But others really enjoyed it. I added a little bit of crispy bacon and diced celery to give it a little more crunch rather than peperoncini.

This is a very good potato salad.  My normal potato salad is basically this one minus the optional ingredients (and I use Italian dressing in place of ranch).  I made this yesterday, and my family loved it.  I would recommend cutting the salt back some.  I used 1 tsp. rather than 1 1/2 tsp.  The only change I made was to leave out the black olives as my family does not care for them.  As others have said, this is much better the next day.  Next time, I will add some crisp cooked bacon.

The secrets: Use Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise, use spicy brown mustard instead of standard yellow mustard, and then FORK the potatoes until they are nearly mashed.  mmmmmmmmmm.....SO good!

Delicious... I'm a ranch addict so next time I'd add just a bit more.  Right before you serve it, add some crumbled bacon or bacon bits.

This potato salad recipe is absolutely fantastic!  I have to admit, I was a bit nervous about the ranch dressing but it came out awesome.  I added a few extra veggies but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Thank you for sharing this great recipe!

Good potato salad. I think I would have liked it even better if I had the celery seed and black olives to add. I did chop up some dill pickle slices and mixed it in.

This was soooo good! I was a little hesitant about adding ranch dressing, but it was delish. I chopped up some celery that i had in the fridge, and it really topped it off... there were no leftovers! Definitely a keeper!!

Very good recipe.  "10 red potatoes" is a little vague...I had no idea what size they should be.  My 10 potatoes ended up weighing about 5 lbs., but I think maybe they were a little bigger than they should have been.  The recipe called to boil them 15 to 20 minutes, but I boiled mine for 30 minutes and they still weren't quite done.  So when I make it again I will opt for slightly smaller potatoes than 1/2 pound each.  I totally disagree with the reviewers who said it was too saltly...not at all.  If you taste the dressing before you put it on the potatoes, it does taste a little salty.  But it's perfect after it's mixed with the potatoes.  I skimped a little on the pepperoncini because I just wasn't sure if that sounded good to me, but next time I will go heavy on them because they were great.  My only question about them is are they supposed to be sliced or chopped...the recipe doesn't say.  I left mine sliced so they would be consistent with the black olives.  And as many other reviewers have suggested, definitely make this a day early.

I was skeptical about this recipe, calling for pepperoncinis but decided to give it a try anyway. I’m glad I did! This is hands down the best potato salad I’ve ever made. It is not spicy at all, but flavorful with just the right amount of crunch you want in a potato salad. I made it for my family, and they ask me to make it again. Make sure you use RED POTATOES. This makes all the difference in the world in how they cook up....I don’t like “mushy” potatoes in my potato salad, and the red ones cook up nicely for this.

Family loves this recipe.  Always change up the recipe a little bit each time but have not added relish or olives.  This tastes best when refrigerated.

I just made this and I gotta say WOW!! one of the best potato salads I've ever had or made. The only thing I did differently was NOT add ranch.  Although I am a huge ranch fan, it just didn't seem like it should be included. I did try it first before I judged and so glad I did that.  I also mixed all the said ingredients (minus the potatoes, olives and eggs ) together in one bowl first then so poured it over the potatoes and mixed.  I left  the olives and eggs in separate bowls because not all people like those items. Overall hands down THE BEST! ! thanks for sharing :)

Very good, but I did make some changes to give it a bit more flavor. I didn't have olives or pepperoncinis, but the peppers would probably be awesome in it. I ended using some diced jalapeños and they were great, not too spicy but just a little heat. I also doubled the pepper, added about a half a teaspoon of ground mustard, and a few drops of sriracha. So good!!

I think this might just be the best potato salad ever! The flavor is great, and I never would have thought to add ranch dressing to potato salad. So this recipe is great for originality. The texture is smooth while the flavor is tangy in a subtle way. The mayo/ranch combo did turn out kind of liquidy, which might not be what some people want, because it doesn't stay on the potatoes real well, but the flavor is amazing. Five out of five people liked it in my house, so I'm sure it will be made again. Thank you for the recipe, cheftini!

What a success! I had to give it four stars tho because I did later the recipe. I used lite sour cream instead of mayonnaise, used chopped pickles instead of relish, used purple onion, added chives, and used more mustard than it calls for. I would hands down make again! Thanks!

First off I totally screwed up by not cooking the potatoes long enough. BUT, even with a couple crunchy potatoes, this is the BEST potato salad I've ever had!  Only thing I added was bacon. Not because it needed it, it truly doesn't, but because it's bacon. Lol!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!!! I'll be making this way more often!

Very bland and unloved by my guests.  I think this would be fine, as the texture of the potatoes is good done this way, if it were spiced up some.  The only problem is I look for a recipe that is complete as is, so I don't have to play around with it.  Good idea but disappointing results.

The potato salad was fabulous!  I did not add the pepperocini's as I was out, but I don't feel like that compromised the dish at all. It was wonderful. Just the right amount of sauce. Like others said, you won't even know ranch dressing is in it-I swear that is the key/secret though!  This is one of those dishes that I think will be even better the next day!


One recommendation I have it to try and choose potatoes of uniform size so they cook at the same rate.  Mine took the full 20 minutes. Also, I was short on time and did a rapid "cooling" in the freezer of the potatoes and it worked out great!

Excellent recipe.  I just cubed the potatoes and gently boiled them for 15 mins instead of going through the process above (I don't believe in peeling red potatoes anyway).  I really like the flavor the ranch and relish add.  This is a keeper.

I usually don't follow other's recipes . I mostly do my own thing season to taste as I prepare. I like to look for new things to make and the different variations of the things I do. I've been making this type of potato salad for years . Never have I added ranch dressing to it. This time I did. Wow !! What a wonderful difference it made. This is the best potato salad I've ever made an eaten . Thank you for posting it. It tastes just like my mom's did.

This is a great base that you can change up to have whatever ingredients you like in it.  I was surprised how nicely the black olives fit in, but still haven't been brave enough to try the pepperoncini.  This is the perfect way to hard boil eggs - I would just add that if you crack the shells on the eggs before running them under cold water, they will cool faster and won't have any gray around the yolk.  FYI, 10 red potatoes is 3 lbs and I used about 1/2 cup onion.  I always look at what the Cook's Illustrated Kitchen has to say about traditional recipes and their advice is good - use russet potatoes cut into 3/4" cubes, bring to boil, add 1 Tblsp of salt and simmer for 8 minutes.  Drain and let stand in bowl with 2 Tbslp of vinegar for 20 minutes.  It really gets the flavor into the potatoes and prevents them from breaking apart since you don't have to cut them afterwards.  Cut the salt in the recipe in half, since you have salt in the potatoes and choose red onion.  The second time I made this, I doubled the olives (2 2.25 oz cans), left out the celery seed, chopped 3 dill pickle spears instead of using pickle relish (funny flavor in the relish) and used sour cream instead of ranch dressing because I had some leftover in the frig.  I really didn't miss the ranch dressing, so I think if you don't have any on hand, go ahead and use mayo or sour cream.  Next time I will put even more pickles in - I like the tang and the crunch.  If you like celery, I say add the real thing.

Loved! I made the ranch dress from here: "ranch dressing II" by dwania. This recipe is so much better than any store bought stuff. I followed the potato salad recipe except for adding more mayo, I used the ranch dressing for to get the creamy texture I wanted. This recipe will not let you down.

I have never given a bad review before but this was horrible. To be fair I do like a sweeter potato salad and I did use sweet relish instead of dill because of it. I know exactly what killed it for me. It was the mustard! I mean come on, 2 TABLESPOONS?! I only put in 1 and it was waaay too much.

Best Potato Salad EVER!!  Made it for a Canada Day BBQ and everyone loved it.  Didn't add the options but did add red pepper for crunch and everyone loved it.  I've made many potato salads but this one turned out the best.

When I first made the "dressing" and tasted it I almost didn't use it...it tasted very much like store bought with a vinegary taste and I was so disappointed with the waste of ingredients.  I had no time to come up with something else as a house full of ppl were arriving....so I it mixed it all together, put in the fridge.  I was SOOOOO wrong.  It was amazing, the best potato salad ever...I got a ton of compliments and it went fast.  I didn't have the pepperoni which was optional so I used cooked bacon..I had a diverse crowd so I didn't add the olives.  Thank you so much for this wonderful salad recipe.  I will always use it from now on and will probably try the pepperoni and olives next time!

This is a pretty good potato salad.  For a bit more thick and creaminess we used 3/4 cup of mayo and 1/4 cup of ranch.

This was awesome! Should have doubled it because it went quick. The only thing that annoyed me was that it said to peel the potatoes after cooking. Oh no, way too tedious for me. I am peeling before I boil next time. Other than that, this is a new staple at our house!

I doubled this recipe for a large family gathering.  Major hit!  Everyone has their favorite homemade potatoe salad recipe, and this one ranked at the top.  I added chopped cerlery and shredded carrots to give it more of a crunch. For the final presentation, I  saved two of the eggs, sliced them and arranged them on top, with paprika sprnkles. Absolutely delicious.  This is a keeper and joins the family favorites!  Wish I had taken a picture :-)

I'm not a potato salad lover BUT, this is really good potato salad.  My husband loves it so I made it for him and I tried it.  LOVED IT.  He doesn't care for olives so I left that out and I was out of dill pickles other than that I followed the recipe and it is delicious.  I would highly recommend it.

So I started making a large batch of potato salad today - for over 70 people - and then I thought I'd like to try something new. I saw all the great reviews but I am not a fan of prepared salad dressing so using Ranch didn't appeal. But I liked all the other ingredients so gave it a try and WOW - this is what potato salad should taste like. I didn't have dill pickles but used the pepperoncini and they gave a nice taste boost. Used green onions because I like the color but everything else as written. Very very good - thanks for this!!

My husband loved this recipe... I didn't add the onion or pepperoncini, but I did put celery and black olives. My step son hates onions...  Other than that I followed the recipe...

OMG this was absolutely delicious!  Made it exactly as the receipe stated expect for the "optional" items.  Had company for dinner the day I made it and they loved it.  I just couldn't believe that all these ingredients would make something that tasted so, so good!  This was the very first tiime that I ever made a cold potato salad and was looking for a very good recipe -- I am so glad that I found this one.  It is a keeper!

1st time I ever tried making homemade potato salad.  I will never try another recipe.  This is the best potato salad I've ever eaten..no more deli disappointments! The only thing I added was a couple tbsp of sour cream.  My husband loved it.

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! 
Tastes great as written, immediately and after a day.  I have been  trying to recreate family recipe that is lost and this is very close....I followed instructions, added 1 c finely chopped celery, increased mustard by 1 TBLSP and did not add optional items.

This is outstanding, in fact the best that I've ever had!  Made just as the recipe recommends including the pepperoncini and olives.  The only thing I added was 2 stalks of chopped celery to give it a little crunch.

I would have to say, the title is correct! This is the Best Potato Salad! Perfectly Creamy and great flavor! I did not use the pepperoncini or black olives. Next time I will try using the pepperoncini because I thought it could have used a little crunch. Also, the recipe did not state what type of onion to used, so for color and because it is my favorite I used a Red Onion, and let me tell you, Delicious!

Very easy and very good. I normally do not bother with a potato salad recipe just because they kind of bore me, really; however, this one caught my eye with the addition of the pepperoncini's, which I love and had to try it. YUM, YUM. I was even short on time, so after completing the recipe, I put it in the freezer for half an hour to speed up the cold process. It work brilliantly. A real winner. Thank you.

I have made this three times for get togethers and every time it is the favorite item served and I get many compliments.  One friend said, "wow, better than grandma's recipe." :-) The last time I cut down significantly on the mayo and let it set overnight which seemed to really bring out the rest of the flavors even more.  A true keeper.  Thanks so much for the reipe!

Very well done. Followed exactly, enjoyed flavor right when I made it, knowing would get even better over time. After tasting it as written, only added some fresh Italian parsley- both for freshness and color. Perfect for me. Chunky, light, tasty and fresh. Def keeper, thanks for sharing!

15 minutes is definitely not long enough to boil, I boiled whole potatoes and then chopped after they cooked and cooled off. They were crunchy :( flavor was very good though

Very yummy recipe! I omitted the celery seeds because I didnt have any and it was still perfect. Love the addition of eggs and the ranch dressing added nice flavor. I also made mine with Yukon Gold potatoes, since its our household favorite!

The only issue I had was the process of hardboiling the eggs...the way listed did not work for me and they were mushy/unusable.  I ended up boiling then simmering on low heat for 12 mins to get them perfect.  I added the pepperoncini and black olives...it tasted excellent.

The perfect blend of creaminess and tang!  I cooked the potatoes and the eggs together in the same pot.  A real times saver.  Didn't have the optional ingredients, but this dish was wonderful anyway. Will definitely add to the salad repertoire!

I increased the potatoes because it was a little heavy on the dressing/mayo for my preference, and substituted chopped celery for the celery seed (which I did not have).  I also added onion powder and used sweet relish instead of dill.   Give it a full day or two to let the flavors meld after making it before serving.

i followed recipe exact...(except maybe i put too much mustard).. gave 4 stars but this could easily get 5 with small adjustments. i believe the red potatoes are a must for great potato salad.  i think i put a little too much mustard in mine for i eyeballed it instead of using my measuring spoons and with the relish and pepperoncini it was too mustartdy/vingery. but again maybe it was too much mustard..dont get me wrong this salad was still good but it was not the best.. i like mustard in my potato salad but i like the mayo to be more dominant in the flavor. i think the ranch is a nice addition but i do miss the classic potato salad with the green pepper and maybe a little celery. i WILL make the best potato salad for it is one of my favorites.

I have potato salad issues - meaning, no potato salad has lived up to my expectations...until now. DO NOT leave out the banana peppers. They definitely add that something "extra" that will have your guests asking you "what is that great taste in here?" It doesn't add any heat...just a flavor that is imperative to this potato salad. VERY good!

My husband loved it! And he the pickiest potato/macaroni salad eater! I didn't peel the potatoes and added just a bit of sweetener. Not too mustardy, not too much mayo. Just right! Thank you for sharing the recipe!

WOW!!! I did make a few changes, but not that many.  I used white potatoes instead of red, since that was what I had on hand.  I didn't have ranch dressing, but I did have some ranch dressing mix.  I added about 1/3 of the dry mix package (Hidden Valley), then added a little sour cream, and a little extra mayo.  I increased the mustard to about 4 tbsp, since my husband is used to a more mustard-ey salad.  Everything else I kept the same.  I did add the pepperoncini, but not the black olives, since I only had green, and was afraid it would be too salty.  The salad hasn't even completely cooled down yet, and I can't stop eating it!!!  Awesome combination of flavors, I can't pick out exactly what makes it great, but it's just  really really good overall.  Definitely making this one again.

I really like this. Good flavor. I may have added too many potatoes (I used 6 plain bakers potatoes because that's what I had) so I added more "sauce" for flavor. Plus real pickles and celery in addition because that's just classic to me. Great recipe. Thanks

This is easily the best homemade recipe for potato salad that I have made. I would have given it 5 stars but had to add some additional ranch and spices to it. I loved the peppers in it. I left out the olives for my husband, but am anxious to try it with the olives in it. I also added celery.

I have never been a big fan of potato salad. Made this when we had some people over (summer BBQ) and it was a hit- even I liked it! Now I make it regularly.

This was OK. Maybe I was too hyped up after all the rave reviews. I think it is a good base recipe that could be tweeked to make if more flavorful. I found it a bit bland (didn't use the pepperoncini & olives--that might have made a difference).

This potato salad had the right proportion of mayonaise to mustard.  I added: 3 stalks of finely chopped CELERY, one finely chopped GREEN PEPPER, and one jar of chopped PIMIENTOS.

A very nice salad and made it just as the recipe is written. Next time I make it I'll cut the onion way back or maybe try a Walla Walla or a Maui sweet onion. The yellow onion I used was WAY too strong. I know, not the fault of the author! There were left overs and the onion got so strong that I couldn't eat it! Just too hard on this old man's tummy! LOL!

I'm not a big potato salad fan, but this is great!  I followed the recipe exactly and added both of the optional items; sliced olives and pepperoncinis.  Next time I will add some chopped celery for crunch and more pepperoncinis.  It's even better the next day.

Really good potato salad recipe!  Everyone loved it.  I bought sliced pepperoni, layed it flat on a baking sheet lined with foil and cooked it until crisp, then added the crumbled pepperoni to the salad.  Gave it a little crunch and spice, and was a huge hit.  Used finely chopped celery instead of celery seed, and about 1/4 of a red onion diced, instead of regular onion.  No black olives.  It turned out really flavorful and GREAT!

This is delicious! Everyone really enjoyed this and said it's a nice change from the basic potato salad. I realized I only had sweet relish, so I used that but only used 3 tablespoons, and it worked out just fine. I also left out the olives because I was serving this to a few who do not like olives, but I would love to try this again adding them as well. The addition of the ranch was great! Thanks for sharing, this will definitley be made again :)

I LOVE this salad! It is my new go-to potato salad. I love the flavor from the ranch and pepperoncinis. Amazing! I've made it with red and yellow potatoes and it was delicious both ways.

This potato salad was delicious! I used Yukon Gold potatoes because I needed to use them before they shriveled up. I also used Sweet relish because I already had it instead of Dill relish. I omitted celery seed, pepperoncini, and olives. It used to bother me when people would review these recipes and have changed ingredients but I realize now sometimes it is just what you have to work with.     I also mixed all the ingredients except the eggs and potatoes ahead of time and let the flavors blend overnight in the fridge. My husband raved over it!

Awesome! I didn't have black olives on hand so I didn't add them and just cut up some pickles in substitution for the relish.  I chopped up the perroncinis and I think they really add a nice flavor.

Excellent! I made it last night and tasted this am. Like previous reviewer initially I thought it tasted too salty but it's not. Chopped Pepperchinis are a nice addition and blended well. My family doesn't like olives. I used white onion and added 1 tsp of sugar to the liquid mixuture.  This is a keeper :)

This was YUMMY! I never have dill pickle relish on hand, so I just chopped up some dill pickles. I added the optional olives and peppers because we love them both and I also added some chopped celery and chopped green pepper for extra flavor and crunch. For the dressing, I opted to use light homemade ranch and light mayo (to lighten it up a little) with no problems at all. This had such a wonderfully different taste from the 'normal' potato salad and we really enjoyed it. I will most definately be making this one again-YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I took peoples advice and made it a day earlier. And Oh my gosh, it was so good!  I cut the recipe in half (6 servings) because I wasn't cooking for a lot of people, but I wish I didn't! It's already all gone.   I ended up using a little more relish than called for, but I love the relish. I used a sweet onion, since the recipe didn't say which onion to use and that's all I had. I also didn't add the optional ingredients. And it was still just so good. And I didn't add the celery seed because I dislike celery and I didn't have any.  When I was making it my mother was watching me and she was like "ranch dressing!?"..she was iffy about it but tried it anyway and she loved it!

I had never made Potato Salad before, never was a fan but I was asked to bring some to a party.  I found this recipe and made it as directed except I used chopped celery instead of seed and I used green onions, I didn't add the optional items.  I got compliments from everyone and will probaly be asked to bring it to all parties.

This is really the best potato salad ever!  I followed the recipe exactly except for adding a bit of juice from a dill pickle jar.  So good!

I've made this twice already and everyone loves it. My mom even likes it more than her favorite potato salad recipe. I use about three times the pepperoncini peppers this recipe calls forand about twice the dill pickle relish. Very yummy! I will be making this recipe for the rest of my life!

Delicious! I made it pretty close to the recipe although I didnt add the paprika, celery, or the black olives and pepperoncini. Im sure it would be delicious I just didnt have those on hand. I added 2 tablespoons of Dijon mustard and also minced dill pickles with my onions instead of the relish. Wonderful recipe thank you for sharing!

Turned out very well, I made it for a friends birthday party, everyone loved it so much many asked for recipe and it was one of the few dishes people asked to take home with their leftovers. I made it exactly as listed, I would cut back on the mustard to 1 tablespoon next time. I made it the day before and we had leftovers for 2 more days, it was just as good after 3 days. I will make again.

My dad is a fan of potato salad, but he's also really picky about how he likes it. I decided to try this out and he LOVED it. My mom accidentally cooked the potatoes too long, but he likes it all mushed up like that so it was fine. 

I still like potato salad on the sweet, firmer side so I personally wasn't wowed by it. But for a standard, classic potato salad it's definitely tops.

Really good and the ranch is a nice twist.  Add a little dill pickle juice in addition to relish for extra zip.

Family liked it a lot!  I gradually added the mayo mixture to the potatoes until I got the consistency we like and saved the remainder to toss together a  little macaroni salad in a couple of days.

The best combo of ingredients. Didn’t add olives because my spouse won’t eat them. Next time he’s on a road trip, I’ll make it with olives. Pretty sure i can eat the entire salad over a three day period. Yum!

I enjoyed this salad, but I added grated carrot for extra color, flavor and crunch. I think I used larger potatoes than expected, so it wasn't as creamy as pictured, but it was still very good

This is now my second time making this potato salad and it turned out even better than the first! I was a little shy with the relish the first go around, but had compliments and discussions about using more, so this time I followed the exact recipe and it’s a hit once again. I will use this recipe every time I am asked to bring a side to a BBQ or grilling party-so glad I found it in the Spring, leaves many more opportunities. Now I just need to not sample too much before serving at the party, because it is true that a few hours in the fridge bring the flavors out even more...you will not regret trying this recipe!!

Everyone loved it! It’s a smooth texture which was good but I may put in some celery next time.

What a great recipe, the only different Ingredient I used instead of the pepperoncini peppers, I used a tabasco pepper.

I had to make a few changes to meet the FODMAP diet I'm on for IBS. I substituted sour cream for the buttermilk, spring onions for the onions and banana peppers for the pickles. I never would have thought the banana peppers would be good but they were great. I cooked the potatoes and eggs in my pressure cooker.  The spices were spot on.  Thanks so much for sharing your recipe!!

I was a bit skeptical about ranch dressing in my potato salad, but it worked. The only change I made was using hot chili peppers in place of the pepperoncini peppers. It gives the salad a zing that my family thought was great.

This is so easy to make slight alterations to if you just use the basics and make to your own taste.  Hubby and guests had seconds.

The potato salad is outstanding.  I also picked up a few tidbits of knowledge about the desirability  of using red potatoes for potato salad and refrigerating them before cutting or dicing them up.

This was excellent! i dislike sweet potato salad, this was not. I didn't add the olives or pepperoncini or the celery seed. I did add about 1/2 cup chopped celery for crunch, subbed dijon mustard for regular and added a bit of dill weed and used 1/3 cup chopped dill pickle instead of dill relish. So good!

I give it a 3.8. Don’t forget the paprika that would probably have helped and I didn’t put in enough salt but basically it’s a real good potato salad basic recipe

I made it for a camping trip with a little extra i did 14 potatoes and upped the ingredients to match the extras, came out great. Made about four almost five pounds worth, it lasted all five days in a cooler with ice, perfect to the last bite.

Great potato salad, this will be a go-to!  I did substitute out plain Greek yogurt for 3/4 of the mayonnaise to make it *slightly* less caloric and left out the olives.  I DID include the pepperoncinis and I really feel like those are what makes this recipe stand out!   I didn't have a lot of time to prepare it last night so it only sat after being prepared for about an hour and it was still delicious.  Served it to a crowd and almost everyone went back for seconds, and my husband raved about it all night!

Simple and great. Followed the recipe except I didn't have celery seed, so I added some celery flakes. I added the pepperoncini but omitted the black olives ( I needed them for the next day's mac salad).  Everything was smooth and delicious. I didn't take the skin off my red potatoes, I like them in there. 
Everyone loved it. It will be my new go-to potato salad. I can stop trying new ones!

This is a good basic starting recipe.  Great how it is, or add what you have on hand.  Easy to make to your liking, and I’ve never had one complaint..

I left out the pepperonis because I do not like them.  I  added 1/2 cup of light sour cream and cut the mayonnaise to 1/2 cup. I will make the recipe again with the changes I made.

I followed the recipes except for the black olives. I skipped it for now but would love to try it next time. I added one stalked thinly sliced celery and baby dill weed. To add more aroma, texture and color to it. I opted for red onion instead of white. Lastly, I used 1 tablespoon of yellow mustard and one tablespoon of jalapeño mustard to add more kick to it. Taste really great. My hubby is loving it!

I just read through all of the suggestions and applied them to my recipe.  I did however use regular baking potatoes instead of red.  Everything depends on your preference.  And per my husband this is pretty close to his moms recipe.  But there is still something missing from it.  (And I have no way of asking her as she passed away 7 yrs ago.  Best mother in law a girl could ask for.).

The only changes I made: instead of pickle relish I added chopped “wickles pickles” (spicy bread & butter pickles) and sugar. Everyone loved it!!

Tried for the first time and took to a party. Everyone raved about how unique the flavor was, some who said they did not like potato salad, tried it and loved it. Firm red potatoes and the extra kick of pepper chinos was the key to that experience. I boiled an additional 3 eggs to decorate the top with reserved black olives and pepper chinos. I also added celery for that more crunchy texture. Easily my favorite and will use as my "go to" special dish!

Fantastic recipe.  I made almost no modifications, other than to add a touch of prepared horseradish for a little more zing.  I had tasted it before adding the horseradish, and it was plenty good without it.  I also did not peel the potatoes as it says in the recipe.  I'd rather keep the nutrition that is contained in the skins, and it doesn't affect the potato salad at all.  Thank you for sharing!

I gave this a 5 star even though I haven't eaten it, but because of the dressing. Here's why, ended up with an extra egg and enough dressing to dredge the egg in, OMG was it good, so I immediately boiled up 7 more eggs (for he extra yolk), quartered the recipe and made up some deviled eggs. Man, talk about tasty, added some bacon crumbles and chives. sat them out with the potato salad, everybody raved about both.. thanks for the recipe..

I am picky with potato salad. I like my mother in laws and my moms. Store bought is not great, never bought one I really loved. I tried making without a recipe, no good. Hello all recipes! This one is perfection. Made exactly as written and than I put it in fridge overnight. Brought it out next morning to stir again and than I tasted it. Amazing! It is so good, I will never make it any other way and I’m never buying potato salad again! It’s a bit of a labor of love with the potatoes if you follow 100% but make this dish the day before you need it and you’re golden. I love it so much!

Excellent! I'm one of those people who never uses a recipe for potato salad so sometimes it comes out great and other times just ok. Of course when it comes out great I don't remember what I did to make it great. This will be my favorite from now on.

I made it with a few tweeks regular potatoes instead of red potatoes and added diced dill pickles instead of dill pickle relish also doubled the recipe. Used onion powder instead of an onion. Family doesn't like onions but a little flavor is okay. It was a huge hit and will definitely make it again.

This potato salad has a really good flavor. I didn't add the pickle relish, pepperonicini, or black olives.  I did add chopped celery to it and used the rest of the ingredients it called for. I made it for the second time last night and would definitely make it again. Its a keeper!

Yes!   This  is very much like my traditional potato salad and the bonus in this recipe is that it tells how long to cook an unpeeled potato.  So I always refer back  because too many times I've ended up with  potato salad looking like mashed potatos.  Thank you!

I only substituted dill weed spice for the dill relish since I was to lazy to go to the store to get it. Turned out amazing. Will definitely keep this one in my favorites.

Rave reviews all around - I was searching for something standard but with a twist, and I found it. I'm certainly not one to follow recipes to a T because sometimes it's too much work (but I never stray too far from the usual). I used your average russet potato because that's what I had. I used half a sweet onion and a bunch of green onions. I didn't measure paprika, but I'm certain I went over the recommended amount. I used celery salt because I didn't have celery seed. I chopped a dill pickle and a couple of pepperoncinis (no olives. I let it sit overnight. Will definitely make again.

This is delish!!   I did have to add a couple of TBSP's of vinegar.  It's just what we're used to in our potato salad.  I also added 1/2 cup of celery and 1/2 cup of carrots instead of the celery seed.

Wonderful! My only problem was that I dumped a little too much relish in but next time I will be more careful! Delicious and easy recipe. Will be making again!

Amazing potato salad!! When I was a kid, my mother used to make potato salad in the summer and whenever other people ate it, they were always asking her for the recipe. Well, guess what? This is IT! I made for the first time this week and the memories flooded back! Seriously, this is the ONLY potato salad recipe you will ever need again! Just make it, take it to your school function, office party, church social, etc., stand back and wait for the rave reviews!

This potato salad was great.  I prepared this salad for Thanksgiving and for Christmas I will add celery seed to taste and dill pickle relish to taste.  I did not season as I should have.
What is wrong with me?

My husband and I disagree greatly on how much mustard should be in potato salad, but this recipe is spot on for both of us. I did include the pepperoncinis and they were the perfect complement. Left out the olives. Everything about this recipe is perfect in my opinion. The texture of the potatoes was creamy, but not mushy. I loved it so much I ate JUST potato salad for dinner :) I won't look for another recipe. This is THE potato salad!

Made a double recipe  for a party .... well received.  I thought it was a bit too creamy and would reduce the mayo and ranch in next rendition. But definitely a great side dish for a large party.

I made this because it had all the ingredients in it that we like. I did not put in the pepperoncini. But I put in celery instead of celery seed. Because of that I could have used a little more dressing. It was actually the best potato salad I have ever made. My husband loved it.

I made this at 72 servings for a company bbq , was a hit. I boiled the potatoes in a 450 oven for 1hr, in seasoned  tap water covered in foil. I didn't have a pot big enough for 20 pounds of reds. I left the skins on for texture.
 
I  seasoned  potatoes lightly after dicing. skipped the olives and Substituted the peperoncini with banana peppers, chopped up,  used 1 red and 1 yellow onion, pulsed to small dice and rinsed under cold water. 
added greens off of 4 bunches of green onion, slivered.

I would probably reduce the ranch dressing by 1/3 next time. it is a little over powering. mixed the wet ingredients an hour before mixing to let flavors marry. Once potatoes cooled added the mixture and refrigerate for at least 12hrs. 

 I garnished with  some fine chopped parsley, a light dusting of dry dill, paprika to the top, drizzled a little extra virgin olive oil too.

solid recipe that had them raving and asking me for the recipe.

Alright....so let me say this........the potato salad was VERY good. It really was but there are some things that need to be done to ensure the recipe is hitting at its optimal capabilities. I did make this to a "T," adding the pepperocinis but no olives. I only added a little Tony Chachere's seasoning salt. Here are the issues:  Following the directions exactly caused my potatoes to not be tender enough...at all. Next time, I'll either cook them longer or fix them the way I've seen people do for decades......peel and cube them FIRST and THEN boil them. The smaller sized cubes will need less time to cook. The second issue is the potato salad was extremely creamy. While that's not a problem for me, there are plenty of folks who like theirs a little less "wet." To remedy this, just add more potatoes or decrease the mayo and ranch a tad. Flavor-wise, it was slightly different from the potato salads I'm used to but it was deliciously different so I'll be making this again. I'll just make sure the potatoes are much more tender next time.

I have never liked any potato salad. Ever.  But I was sick of buying that disgusting, expensive stuff from the store for my husband at cookouts, so I decided to try this recipe.  I did made a few changes, but it was really, really good, even for me.  Definitely a keeper.  I can't wait for him to taste it later.  It did seem  salty, but that was initially, so I'll see how it tastes after some refrigeration.
My changes: I decreased mustard to 1 TBSP and 1 tsp.  Used 1/3 of a large yellow onion.  Instead of pepperocino, I chopped about 2 TBSP of green peppers.  I subbed 2 TBSP chopped celery for the celery seed.  I used 7 very large red potatoes, and cubed them after boiling.

I have made this dish many times. I don't add pepperoni peppers because I didn't have them when I first made it and we liked it so much without them. I have taken it to all sorts of places and it always gets rave reviews. It is just easiest because it uses relishes and it is splendid.

This is the best, basic, classic potato salad. I have been using this recipe for a couple of years and it always gets compliments. It isn’t trying to be fancy, it’s just good ole potato salad.

Made exactly as written, except did not add the optional black olives.  This is a nice, somewhat traditional potato salad.  I did not taste that much of a difference by using the ranch.  One of my guests raved about the salad.  Not difficult to make but be sure you have at least an hour and one-half available to make it.

I made this yesterday exactly as written, with the exception that I used a quarter teaspoon celery salt instead of celery seed as I did not have it.
It turned out great, next time I make it I might sprinkle a little pickle juice on the potatoes and use a little more mayo. Family loved it. It's nice to  have a recipe like this they can be modified per individual tastes. I always used to make my potato salad without a recipe and it never turned out the same way twice. Now I can look forward to some consistency!

Excellent recipe. However, I changed the 2 tablespoons of prepared yellow mustard  to only 1/2 teaspoon, and then it tasted just right. You can always add more mustard, but you can't remove it once it is mixed in.

Tip: If you don't have the 1/2 cup of ranch dressing, you can add these ingredients instead. 1/2 cup mayonnaise, 1/4 cup sour cream, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp dill weed, 2 tbs milk, 1/2 tbs parsley and 1/2 tsp onion powder.

If you're not a fan of sweet and tangy potato salads, this really is the best. It's a great, savory flavor which I love as I often make it next to my sweet and tangy macaroni salad.

I've made it many times now, exactly as written, sometimes without the optional stuff, and a couple times I had to use sweet pickle relish because I didn't have any dill. Every single time it tastes amazing. 

I use a red onion because I like that dab of color, and I always make sure to prepare it a day ahead so it has time for the flavors to blend. It really tastes different after sitting for a day.

This was my first time making any potato salad and it turned out to be simply wonderful !  There is a more "robust" flavor to this recipe than with many you would find at a family gathering so I give it five stars.

This recipe was a hit for my husband and I. I did half red onion and half green onion, added just a little bit of sugar to taste a hint of sweetness--since I like my potato salad a little bit more sweet--(my husband doesn't like sweet). I also added a cup of finely chopped celery instead of celery seed. DELICIOUS!

I will make this again , just adding a little more mustard and pickles because we like them. Otherwise loved it . Only change I made was adding diced radishes for crunch. Really loved the flavor added by the pepperocinis.

This was a great recipe and very similar to my mom's that I've made for years.  A few things I changed only because I didn't have it at home:  I chopped up really small some celery ribs (out of celery seed), used powdered ranch mix  and blended it with the mayonnaise.  The eggs I didn't chop, I just sliced them in half lengthwise and laid  them on top of the salad, it makes for a prettier presentation.  Will make this again!  Thanks so much,for sharing your recipe

This so yummy!!! I followed the recipe exactly (no optional ingredients). For the potatoes I peeled and cut them up and then put them in a boiling pot of water. I also slightly whipped them to get the lumps out.

This is  first time I've seen a  potato  salad recipe with Ranch dressing so my curiosity allowed me to  this. I'm glad I did! I didn't have  any relish but the recipe  still came out  great! I highly recommend this to anyone.

I made this yesterday! The red potatoes really make this a smooth salad! I put celery salt instead of celery seed because that's what I had on hand. I also didn't put the ranch and it tasted amazing! Big hit! I will add that it's quite an eggy recipe... I happen to like that! If I were to put olive and pepperochini on it I would sprinkle on top so people have the option of scooping it...

This has become my go-to potato salad! I did substitute chopped dill pickles instead of dill pickle relish and added some fresh dill, just because I like a lot of dill flavor.  I also cut down on the amount of salt & left out the optional black olives and pepperocini.
It's soo good!

This is the best potato salad!! Everyone I have made it for loves it. I did make some changes. 3/4 cup of mayo, 8 eggs, chopped dill pickles no relish, 1/2 onion, 2chopped celery stocks, 3/4 can of olives. I like a dry potato salad. So so good!

I'll allow this four stars because it does cover the bases of what a good potato salad consists of.  However, you bumped your head when you added the ranch and olives.  Never, ever in my life has there been any of that in a traditional Southern recipe or any other recipe that I have tried.  Since olives are an either "I LOVE it or I HATE it" type of food, one would never venture into that unless they were making it for a specific person.  As for "ranch" dressing, NO.  Just no.  Some people are taste-blind to the fact that ranch dressing is awful and should never be added to anything, however, I am not one of those people and I choose to keep my recipes neat and clean.  Thanks for your recipe!

Flavor was great but would be so much better if made with russet potatoes instead of red. The texture of red potatoes are better mashed!

Wow!  This is a keeper.  I will add that I inadvertently had to change the recipe slightly.  I did not have any celery seed.  So, I omitted it all together.  I followed the recipe exactly besides that.  I added the optional peppers, but did not add olives.  Also, I left the skin on the potatoes just out of laziness.  It was definitely the best potato salad recipe that I have ever tried.  Next time I will add the olives and celery seed and try it as written.

Just made so was still a little warm when I tasted it, but I think it just may be the best potato salad I have ever made. Only change is I added some chopped up celery because I like a little crunch in my potato salad.

My new favorite potato salad recipe! I am not a fan of mustard nor relish but my dad and fiancé love it in theirs so I always make mine then set aside before making theirs. With this recipe I no longer set mine aside and even eat it w the relish and mustard and I enjoy it. It's chunky and creamy and full of flavor. So glad I found this!

I really loved the flavor. I was worried that the raw onion would make it spicy and taste weird but the flavors melded perfectly. I left out the optional ingredients and peeled and cubed the potatoes prior to boiling to save time. I loved it. My only critic is that it visually wasn't appetizing. I had one person ask if it was vanilla pudding. Will use red onion next time for color and the olives. Any other tips to make this look as yummy as it is? Thank you for this recipe!

This is my go to tater salad recipe and I'm always asked to bring it to our get togethers.  The only thing I really do different is add chopped celery so there is a little crunch in it and I don't completely peel the potatoes.  Great recipe!

This was my first attempt at potato salad and it was delicious! I followed most of the recipe but I did not have dill relish and ended up using sweet and it was delicious. I think the mustard and mayonnaise help balance it. I also added a little bit of dill.

It's official: this is indeed the world's best potato salad.   I made this for my Mom, who always claimed that title for her potato salad.  She took one bite, and declared this to be better.  The thing is, I dislike potato salad, and did not so much as taste test this when I was making it.  That's how good this recipe is!  I followed the recipe exactly, since I had never made a potato salad before.  Thanks for making me look like a great cook!

I got rave reviews when I made this potato salad for a group dinner recently!

A couple of things I did differently...
No olives, no pepperoncini, no celery seed (didn't have any,) and I used sweet relish instead of dill.  I didn't have time to let it all stew together for 2 hours, but it was gobbled up in no time anyway!  I will absolutely work from this recipe again!  (My guests loved the consistency of the potatoes!  Boiling first and peeling second is the way to go!!!!)

First time making potato salad and it was exactly what I wanted. Didn't add the optional items, the onion because my boyfriend and I both hate them, and didn't add the relish. I DID add bacon bits though, the ranch made it very tasty. Will

Great flavors.  I make this quite a bit and its always a hit.  I do use Dijon mustard instead of yellow, just because I like the extra kick.  Otherwise, I follow it as written.

Love this recipe but one of my biggest complaints for recipes like this is the lack of measured ingredients. ..."one chopped onion" or " 10 red potatoes" is too vague imo. not all veggies are created equal so it becomes a trial and error exercise. Please recipe posters include measurements....

This was a great potato salad. Made it for a get together with the in-laws and it was the first dish to go!

Delicious traditional potato salad with a slight twist.  It's creamy and eggy and mustardy.  Just delish!  The ranch adds a little extra something without being overwhelming.  Very very good!!  I do not add the optional ingredients.

First time ever making potato salad and everyone RAVED about it. I used real celery instead of celery seed but everything else is as the recipe said (minus the optional ingredients). I may use more potatoes so it's more "potatoy" because mine seemed to have a little excess creaminess with the mayo and ranch dressing. This is my new recipe and I'm making it again tonight for a Boy Scout outing!

Excellent Potato Salad.  Made it exactly as the recipe called for except I used Celery Salt instead of seed because that is what I had here. I don't think the optional ingredients are optional.  I think those ingredients is what sets this recipe apart from the rest.  Going to be serving it at a BBQ this weekend.

My family love potato salad. I'm searching for a great recipe and unfortunately I'm still searching. I made this  as stated except I cooked the onions (migraine trigger). It was flavorful in the beginning but when you keep eating it the taste does change.  Was also salty the next day.

It IS the best!  A lot of potato salad dries out and requires more and more mayo. This stays moist and creamy. I agree with others, the final dressing tastes weird, but next day VOILA! Super yummy salad. I cut up sweet gherkins instead of relish and threw in a few capers, so had both sweet and salty. Halved recipe for just two of us at home right now. It will be my Go-To from now on.

Absolutely the best traditional potato salad recipe EVER. The ranch dressing takes it to a new level. I served it at a July 4 BBQ and had requests the next day for the recipe.

It's what you hope for in a potato salad. Followed directions exactly. Thanks for sharing! I had really big potatoes and they were pretty firm, so if you like them softer, cook slightly longer than stated, but it was still wonderful.

LOVE LOVE LOVE.  I am very picky about potato salad. I loved this recipe and so did everyone else.  I didn't have celery seed but did everything else to the letter and it turned out delicious. This will be my go to salad everytime!

don't know what the fuss is about.  When I tasted the dressing before mixing in with potatoes I thought it tasted like tartar sauce.  Added more mayo which helped.  Can't taste the ranch dressing.  Will go back to my own potato salad.  Relish taste is very strong so if your not a relish fan I would cut back the amount.  Glad no company coming and hubby will have to eat it.

I made this as it minus the optional. This was my first time making potato salad and it came out pretty good! There wasn't enough "twang" in it like I prefer though so next time I'll double the mustard and relish. Thanks for the recipe!

Great even without the egg! The suggestion to boil the potatoes first, cut later is key if you don't want it too creamy, as is letting them chill in the fridge first! I am on a mission to perfect the simplest potato salad recipe ever, and while this is a bit more complicated (ingredient amount-wise) than I'd like, the nominal extra effort is worth it. Kudos!

Hands down best potato salad!  I didn't put in the optional ingredients (as I have no desire for either) but it is a hit regardless.  My brother was skeptical at first (he's very picky...he's had some pretty rough ones) but once he tried it, he deemed it his favorite.  Can't ask for a better review than that =)

People are pretty particular about the kind of potato salad they like.  This one is a winner if you like a simple mustard salad.  I use celery instead of the pepperocini but only because I don't like peppers ;)  This is a new favorite recipe and it will be added to our summer cookouts for many years to come!

I loved this so much!  I could not stop picking at it yesterday and started nibbling at it early this morning:)  I made a couple of very small changes, due to what I had on hand.  Those being green onion instead of regular (although I'd love to try it with red onion!), light mayo and plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  I added some chopped parsley also.  Excellent!  My husband won't eat anything with mayo in it so I'm forced to eat this all by myself...sigh:)  This will be my go to potato salad from now on.

I love onions but one half an onion would have been sufficient.  And, too salty, one teaspoon would also be enough.  Not to brag, but I still like my cold German Potato Salad the best.
I think I'll try the "World's Best Potato Salad" next.  LOL

I made this recipe as-is but left out the pepperoncinis. It didn't work for the wife and I because it tasted like Ranch Dressing, which It was probably intended to taste like, we just didn't care for it.

This was a hit at my BBQ! I 1 & 1/2 the recipe and didn't make any changes except to decrease the relish just a tiny bit (it would have been fine either way). Oh, I did peel my potatoes and cube them before boiling and then let them cool on the counter because I felt it saved time, and I was making they day before so I new it would get a good chill. I recommend making a day ahead if you can. As for the flavor. It was just right! Not too much mustard flavor, it was delish! I had about 15 people over and it was plenty @ 1.5 of the recipe but I had no leftovers. Everyone really enjoyed it! It's a keeper!

I made this  salad as per recipe minus the two last ingredients. I added some dill pickles ,some of the juice plus some white balsamic vinegar. They made the dressing a bit more runny (I like it not too creamy) but a lot more tangy and tasted excellent. I saved it in my recipe box and I definitely will make it again.

I have struggled with homemade potato salad for years and I think the hunt for a good recipe is over!! This recipe had the perfect mix of ingredients that did not overpower the dish. My previous attempts either had too much mustard, mayo, or just too bland. I was apprehensive about adding  pepperoncinis but I trusted previous reviewers and went for it. In the end, this ingredient set this dish apart from many others I have tried.  I added additional olives because my family loves them. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!!!!!

It's a good recipe for sure. Anything that adds a little something different to mundane old potato salad is welcome. I added pepper encrusted bacon to this recipe and it gave it one extra layer of flavor. I also use celery hearts instead of celery seed and both black and green olives. Very good.

I've made this over and over again and get lots of requests for it! I use the exact recipe with about 3 or 4 finely chopped pepperoncinis and no black olives. There is never leftovers, love it!

I love this potato salad! Which says a lot since I never like any potato salad other then my mom's recipe. I did leave the pepperoncini and black olives out since it was for a big party and there were people coming who do not like one or both. (I will definitely put them in next time I make it for our family). I like my potato salad very wet (creamy), and this was a bit dry after sitting in frig over night. So I did add extra mayo and Ranch and seasonings proportionately. I also like lots of eggs so doubled amount (which may have contributed to it being a bit drier). These changes where because of my preferences of taste. GREAT SALAD!

Awesome, easy to make, full of taste.  I've made my moms potato salad for years ... Chock full of bell peppers, pickles, onions, green olives, celery, etc., with a dressing made to taste with mayo, vinegar and sugar.  This recipe beats the old family recipe.  The quantities of ingredients are just right and the ranch, mayo and yellow mustard make a perfect dressing!  I added a fourth cup chopped bell pepper and just a little chopped celery.  I didn't have the peppercinis but I did have 2 small, fresh finely chopped jalepenos with no seeds or rib that was leftover from tacos the night before.  They brought just a hint of fresh spice.  This will be my go to potato salad from now on!

If this tastes better after it sits a while,  it will be best ever potato salad.  Did waaayyy too much tasting while preparing it, so I hope I still have room for some for dinner.  Halved the recipe and added a little celery and a titch of mild pepper rings I found in the back of the fridge instead of pepperoncini.  Would have loved to add the black olives, but husband hates them.  Great nonetheless!

Well, I have to say that I'm impressed.  I was nervous about adding ranch.  I was nervous about cooking the potatoes whole too.  But, happily to my surprise, it was all delicious.  I halved the recipe since it was just a side dish for dinner but my husband made the dressing at full amounts.  So, my potatoes were a little drowned in the sauce but it was still really good.  Next time, I'll make sure the whole recipe is halved or regular!

I loved this potato salad! I added a little less mayo and ranch and it turned out perfect. I also made my own relish because I didn't have any on hand and omitted the celery seeds and pepperoncini's.

This is a very good recipe. I misread the ingredients and got celery instead of celery seeds. I chopped the a stalk of celery. I'm not sure what the seeds would have done, but I didn't miss them. I will be making this one again!

I've followed this recipe exactly, and think it is great.  It's been in my box for 2 years. I know there are many different potato salad recipes, but this is the best.   Sometimes I add crumbled bacon,  sometimes I leave the egg out.  Those are optional.  Although I always add vinager which I I wish was listed with the recipe it's always an afterthought but a must.  Great all around.

Made this for a cookout at a neighbors and I did take the suggestions from the reviews of making it the day before it turned out wonderful, everyone raved about this recipe.  I did not add the black olives but other than that followed the recipe to a "T" and it was really good will use this as my go to potato salad recipe from now on.  Thanks for the recipe.

I haven't even let it "marinate" in the refrigerated yet and it is already the best homemade potato salad I have ever had.  We usually pay about $60 during the holidays for a local restaurant's potato salad.  NEVER AGAIN!  My substitutions:  scallions, bell pepper, sweet relish and spicy brown mustard.  Delish!

Great recipe!  I made this for a family function and it was a hit!  Added more mustard to taste and eliminated the black olives/pepperoncini. The second time I attempted the recipe I doubled everything and mistakenly used Heavy Mayo...didn't turn out as well.

This is delicious!  We didn't add the olives or pepperoncini's in ours though.  I've never liked potato salad before this recipe...enough said.

Of course I modified the recipe, as I always do to taste. Instead of dill pickle relish, I chopped up some dill pickles in little pieces.  Instead of celery seed, I use actual celery chopped up.  I also added some yellow pepper chopped up.  Other than that I followed the recipes pretty exact. It was the first time I've ever made potato salad and I was extremely impressed!  Very yummy!

This was great, I didn't have celery or the optional ingredients, but still very good.

Made it the night before, and ate it the next day at dinner time.  Flavor was mellow, subtle.  I couldn't taste just mustard, or just ranch.  It blended together very well.

For people that like a strong flavor in potato salad, this might not be the one for you.  I loved it because it was light tasting while still being creamy.

I will be making it again.  Next time I will find some celery, and use the optional ingredients as well.

I got 2 thumbs up from everyone at the table!  I have only ever made my Mom's recipe, but really wanted to try something different. I made a couple small changes, including actually cutting up some celery instead of using the celery seed. I used red onion as it's my daughter's favorite and used dijon mustard instead of prepared mustard.  I left out the optional ingredients and will be making this again for the next long weekend at the lake, becasue I know everyone will love it!

I made this for my family. It was really good, but I found that it lacked a little "zip". I think it is because I used plain yellow mustard. I intend to try this again with stone ground mustard, for a little more "zing". Also, I had a LOT of leftover dressing. I can use it as salad dressing, but I still think it was too much. I might cut back the amount of mayo next time.

Amazing! I gave 5 starts, which I rarely do. I omitted the last 2 ingredients but did go a little heavier on the seasonings for extra flavor. I will never make another salad!

Left out the optional ingredients and followed other reviewers advice and used sweet relish, not sure if that makes a difference.  Good recipe.

I used this dressing for a combination potato and broccoli salad.  I replaced half the mayo with fat free sour cream and we just loved it.  Great balance of creamy, sweet, and tangy.

This was my first time making potato salad.  I am not sure why but I have always been nervous about making potato salad.  My sister asked me to make it for a family event and after it had chilled I asked my husband to taste it.  I had thought it was too salty when I had tasted it before it had a chance to cool.  He asked me if he told me that it was too salty would I leave it at home and not take it to the event.  Everyone loved it!  Will definitely make it again.

The best potato salad recipe!  My friends beg me to make it.  I think using red potatoes and chilling in the fridge after boiling was key to making this great.  I also loved using the peperoncini.

I've been trying out different potato salad and made this one for Easter Sunday dinner and everybody loved it. I also added in some green olives with everything. The addition of pepperoncini was really great. Nice and creamy and every bite bursting with flavor.

This recipe has a lot of taste.  As others, I left out the olives and pickle relish (we don't like sweet potato salad). The pepperocini is a must as is a little finely chopped red onion.

I love potato salad and this is certainly delicious. I used kosher salt instead of table salt. After I dished everything into the serving bowl, I sprinkled the top lightly with kosher salt. I am making it tonight again. Yesterday was a pot luck.

This is an excellent recipe.  My husband and I like black olives and they do add something special to the taste.  I couldn't find pepperoncini.  Since we both like a little kick, I substituted a half of a chopped jalapeno and it was also very good in this salad.

This is an A+ recipe! I just made a batch, divided it into two, one with egg, the other without egg. 
 It was so tasty, I cant wait to try it tomorrow after it has sat for a while. I followed the recipe, added everything and used Veganaise in place of Mayo, tasted very good and my husband loved it too. I did add one long stalk of celery chopped to the recipe and it was perfect!!!!

OMG best potato salad I ever made. I added the peppers, but not the olives as I didn't have any. Beats the potato salad I grew up on that was potatoes, eggs, salt, pepper and Mayo.

This was by far the best potato salad I've ever made, so says my entire family. Even though I accidentally left out the egg, it was still outstanding. I even turned some anti-potato salad people into BIG fans with this recipe. Thank you!

Very tasty!  I followed the recipe except that I ran out of yellow mustard so I used spicy brown mustard.  I didn't add the olives or pepperoncini.  It was even better after it sat in the fridge overnight!

I typically make just a plain mayo, mustard, celery, egg, onion potato salad.  I never really thought to mix ranch in with it, and the celery salt.  I really liked this sauce.  I think next time I make it I will add bacon and cheese.  Very good ratio of ingredients.

I don't usually eat potato salad but I was stuck making it for a party.  This recipe was so good I even ate some.  It turned out great.  I left out the onion, pepperoncini, and olive, it was a kids party.  I made a triple batch the night before and let it chill.  It was all eaten.

I was skeptical of this potato salad at first because I am not a huge ranch fan. But it was fantastic, the ranch is not a real strong flavor and I used mayonnaise that already had the pickle in it, some kind of sandwich spread. It may seem salty at first, but after its been refrigerated its better.I will be making this again!

This potato salad IS the best! I am throwing away all my other potato salad recipes. This one will be the one I always make from now on. I didn't use the olives but I did use the pepperoncini's and they added the perfect little kick to make this salad even better! The only other thing I did was use 1 tsp of salt instead of 1 1/2 tsp.

VERY good potato salad. Best I've had. I added one sweet potato (skin, cubed, bring to boil and boil for about 5 mins), it added a nice sweet contrast to the relish and peppers, adds a little more color + plus sweet potatoes are so good for you.

I dislike rating something when I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but it was out of taste preference. I didn't do the onion, relish, pepperoncinis, or olives, but i followed everything else exactly. It was my first time making potato salad, and i don't think i need to try a different recipe. This one rocks! Perfect for the Memorial Day BBQ!

This potato salad was good. I omitted the peppers and put the onions in a blender with the mayo & ranch to mix together. I like the flavor of the onions without the texture. All in all, a very good potato salad. Thanks!

Whole family loved this salad.  I did add some crispy bacon as a garnish, but that was the only change I made.  Very creamy and rich, but great.  Would be a great salad for a large family or work get together.

Seriously...???!!!?  This is absolutely, hands-down, without a doubt one of the BEST potato salads I have ever had!  I made three alterations out of necessity- used white potatoes, green onions and sweet relish (didn't add as much because I don't care for it as much as dill but it's all I had on hand).  I skipped the two "optional" ingredients as well.  Definitely a keeper of a recipe.  YUM!!  Thank you!

*ETA...this is still my go-to recipe. I absolutely love it. I still skip the optional ingredients and I still just use white potatoes. It is at its best the next day.  Sometimes I use onions, sometimes I don't - depends on if I remembered to buy one. :) Recipe is excellent either way. Love it! Thanks again!

This potato salad recipe was really good.  My husband and I both enjoyed it.  It really creamy and didn't have an overwhelming mustard flavor like so many potato salads do.  I will definitely be making this again.

I have never made really good potato salad until this recipe.  This is very good.  i would probably use more sauce or less potatos next time as it was a bit dry the next day as the potatos had absorbed the moisture.  Still, it was delicious.

Looking for a new potato salad recipe (my boyfriend likes the deli style; more mustard than mayo) I made this and also the "World's Best Potato Salad" recipes for a tailgate.  In the taste test, this recipe won 6 to 1, which is great since it was WAY easier to make.  The other recipe was much sweeter, so if you like it that way I suggest using sweet relish in place of the dill.

Great potato salad.  Everyone gobbled it up.  I forgot to put in the pepperoncinis, but it was great without.  Didn't put in black olives either.  I didn't like that idea.  Don't think it really goes in potato salad.  Maybe next time I'll try though.

AMAZING!! It is so hard to find a good potato salad and this one is wonderful! The only thing I did different was I used white potatoes, instead of using celery salt I cut up celery and I chopped up bacon to put on top. I made this for a Labor Day party and a week later people are still talking about how great it was!!

I wanted to make potato salad, and this is exactly how I wanted it to be (except I used chopped up pickles instead of relish, and mixed in a little brine too). So good!

This is always a big hit.  Using a really tasty ranch dressing eg. President's Choice Ranch in the produce section and grating the onion make it even better.

The seasonings & creaminess make this a good one! Mine was a little too goopy, but I think it was because I cooked the potatoes too long and diced them before I boiled them.  Will probably make this from now on, but boil my potatoes whole instead.

I omit the onions and add chopped pickles instead of relish.  Yum!

I had never made potato salad and I wanted to make the best one ever for my daughter's graduation party! I was so happy that the guests raved great about this potato salad! It definitely is the best potato salad!

Great basic potato salad recipe. I didn't include the olives or pepperoncinis. Instead of regular ranch dressing, I use peppercorn ranch, which just added a little extra kick. This is now my "go to" potato salad recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious!  This will be my "go-to" potato salad recipe from now on.  Got rave reviews from my children and husband.  I didn't have yellow mustard and used brown mustard instead.  Still tasted yummy.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

The potato salad was fine... nothing to write home about.  Next time I'd add some bacon for added flavor.

Left out olives and used chopped celery in place of celery seed, only 1 tsp salt and the peppers make the salad, so delicious!  Oh and I used russet instead of red, personal preference.  Fabulous!  So glad I tried it, thanks for sharing, genius!!

This potato salad was excellent and easy to make.  Also, it tasted better the next day which was nice.  I used a reduced fat mayo and left out the celery seed because I was out, and it still tasted great!  Perfect for holiday barbecues.

This potato salad is excellent!  I added celery finely chopped and didn't use peperoncini's as this was mainly made for my baby.  He loved it as did the rest of my family and it was a perfect finger food for him.

I omitted the optional ingredients to go for a more simple salad, it came out really good! I've never made potato salad before, I'm pretty impressed with myself.  I did add just a touch of red wine vinegar because I like a little acid kick in my salads.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent potato salad, even my finicky friend who doesn't really like potato salad thought it was really good! I loved it. I thought the combination of flavors was exceptional (I left out the onions cause I personally can't stand them, and nobody complained ;-) I used baby dill pickles for the dill relish because I didn't have any relish on hand, and threw in a little of the juice just for fun. YUMMY! Thanks for the recipe!

This was pretty darn good. Nice and tangy. The relish is a good addition. I used cut up dill pickles, because we don't really use relish for anything else and I didn't want to have half a bottle of relish laying around. My husband says it needs bacon. I'm a vegetarian, so we served it at the bbq with a side of bacon bits. That was a hit. :-) Definitely a good potato salad, but needs some tweaking.

A great salad, just don't add the salt (or decrease it by a lot) and it doesn't need so much mayo.

I made this as stated except I used 2 stalks chopped celery in place of the celery seeds.  This was VERY GOOD!  I loved the vinegary taste from the Pepperoncinis and mustard.  Not too spicy or salty at all.  If you prefer a more tangy/tart type of Potato Salad than this is the recipe for you.

wanted a potato salad that I liked...made this one for my father's retirement party and I think everyone there has asked me for the recipe.  I didn't add the optional items and didn't use as much onion, but it was wonderful.....didn't have that much left over which was a shame, but so far, every event I have been to since then has had this recipe.  I am  VERY picky, but this is wonderful

I really liked this recipe.  I did not have celery seed - so used celery salt for both the regular salt plus the seed.  We also don't like olives so I omitted those.  I used a couple green onions (whole thing) from the garden.  I really like this potato salad but my husband says it is ok...But I still give it 5 stars!

I was pretty skeptical about the best potatoe salad ever, thats a pretty tall order. I made this to recipe specifications with the following exceptions: I used chopped celery instead of the celery seed (about the same amount as the chopped onion, and I also used chopped pickles instead of relish (again same amount as other chopped veggies). I have not waited the specified amount of time as I HAD to try it immediatley and I must say it is the best potatoe salad ever. I will update when I try again in 2 hours and also tomorrow.

I'm not sure if it's the best potato salad ever, but I do know it's pretty  good. I made some for dinner as a side for some chili marinated double cut pork chops.  I ate 2 servings while it was still warm before dinner.   This sure beats the potato salad from KFC, or any of the other places in town.

This was the best potato salad I've ever made or even had.  Great recipe, thanks!  Only changes I made were more for preference and lack of ingredients than anything else.  I didn't have any dill pickle relish or pepperoncini so I used half sweet relish and half hot pepper relish. I also used 1 stalk of celery (I halved the recipe) and less celery seed and didn't add the black olives (didn't have them either).  It was awesome and went very quickly.  As soon as it was gone, my husband asked me to make more.

Excellent recipe! This was my first time making potato salad and it turned out great. I cut the salt in half and added chopped celery (instead of the celery seed) to give it a little crunch. Definitely a keeper.

Not a big Potato Salad guy but my son was having a gathering and asked me to bring some. I loved it and so did everyone else. Next time I make it I will make a bigger batch so that we have some leftovers. GREAT RECIPE! Thanks

Very good, but because of the size of my red potatoes I had to use 10, and it still seemed like I had a little too much dressing.  I'll definitely try again with more pepperoncini and black pepper to suit my family.

I made this recipe with 2 alterations and 2 additions... I used 6 russet potatoes instead of red potatoes and I used 1 teaspoon of salt instead of 1 1/2 (which still seemed like it was too much for my taste. My additions were 1/4 cup of celery and a whole green apple (cubed).   It was absolutely delicious, my boyfriend and I both loved it very much. The ranch was a really great addition (I may use less mayo in the future, there was a lot of dressing which is why I did a whole apple instead of a 1/4 cup, but I don't know if my red potato to russet potato ratio was correct either...)  It was great though! You should try it with the green apples, it adds a nice sweet/sourness to it with a crisp fresh flavor! I loved it!

Really good...or so my husband tells me :) I left out the optional ingredients and used chopped pickles instead of relish.  This definitely needs to sit for a while though...it tastes very salty at first, but once it's absorbed into the potatoes, it mellows out and becomes very flavorful.  Make it the day before if possible.

Wow. Tangy and delicious. I used chopped up fill pickles and a bit of pickle juice instead of relish and didn't have porcinni but added extra spicy mustard instead. Great!

This is the best potato salad recipe I have come across. I did think the relish taste was a bit overwhelming, so I would add a little less next time. However, the potato salad was still very delicious.

Perfect, not too mustardy nor swimming in mayo either. I used a touch less salt than called for.Tasted much better with the peppercorni and letting sit overnight. Was out of celery seed so used fresh diced celery and was not too crunchy.

I have never made potato salad before which is surprising because my husband & I love it. I decided to make this for a pot luck lunch at work and I was very nervous since I have never made it before. I made it the day before, and like another reviever said it tasted salty at first. After it sat overnight the salty taste was gone! I made my 16yr old daughter, who hates potato salad, try it the morning before I brought it to work. She protested, but tried it anyway. She LOVED it! She asked me not to bring it to work, lol! My husband also tried it and insisted I make some for home too! This was very easy and very tasty!! I will take the advice of another reviewer and try this with bacon ranch next time. Since I have a sweet tooth, I may try it with honey mustard instead of yellow mustard next time! Thanks for the post, this is my first and last potato salad recipe!

I needed to make potato salad for a party of 100 people. Having never made potato salad,I was a bit worried. I made several samples of differnt recipies for my family. This was without question the number one choice by all. Numerous people at the party asked for the recipe and the entire tray was gone in no time! I wouldn't change a thing.

Wow!  This is definitely the BEST potato salad recipe and a keeper.  Instead of ranch dressing, I added dry ranch mix as someone suggested in a post as well as pepperoncinis, olives, and real bacon bit pieces.  It was great just made, but even better over night while the flavors got to blend.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Loved the recipe!   I didn't have red potatoes on hand so I used russet.  Also, my husband and I like a little more mustard so we added to taste.  Not your usual potato salad.

This truly is the best potato salad I've ever made.  It was easy to make and the results were delicious.  I think I will cut the amount of salt next time, since I'm pretty sensitive to it, but other than that it was perfection.  I highly recommend this recipe!

Delicious!  I used banana pepper rings and zesty dill pickles which is what I had in the kitchen.  Next time I will omit the celery seed, a personal preferance.  The peppers and pickles made this a five star recipe.  I will definitely make this again!

I am usually not a potato salad fan but we had a bunch of new garden potatoes. It is the truly the best potato salad that I have eaten.
