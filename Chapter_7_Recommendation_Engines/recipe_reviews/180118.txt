I found both things to like and things that could be improved with this recipe.  On the plus side, the chicken came out wonderfully and very moist, and the potatoes were also delicious and made the stew very filling.  The preparation was also extremely simple; the most time-consuming part was cubing the chicken.  That said, even having left out the celery salt (which I didn't have), I found this stew much too salty.  This coming from a guy who considers salt to be its own food group; I put it on virtually everything.  In retrospect, I think that the only problem was that 6 bouillon cubes is far too much. I ended up adding two cups of whole milk to try and mellow it out without hurting the creaminess, which did help somewhat.  But the bouillon just ended up giving the whole thing that salty, artificial chicken flavor, like eating a packet of ramen flavoring.  If I were to make this again I'd use maybe 1 or 2 cubes of the bouillon, if any at all.  The condensed soup and the chicken breasts are probably enough chicken flavor by themselves, especially if you leave a little bit of the chicken fat on the breasts.  Then just salt to taste.

HELPFUL HINTS TO MAKE THIS 5 STARS: This is a recipe that can be changed 100 different ways and still turn out good.  Important thing to note is you absolutely positively do not need to add the bouillon cubes.  Well, let me rephrase... 1 chicken bc does taste fine w/o being salty when you add the potatoes.  If I use grand biscuits which I recommend to serve with this, I do not add potatoes.  Kinda overdone on the carbs.  If I do add potatoes, DEFINITELY add 1 can of chicken broth and this is the only time I would consider adding a tsp of garlic salt to flavor the potatoes a bit.  I added lots of fresh garlic.  You also can omit the celery and baby carrots if you don't have them.  My bag of mixed veggies always have carrots in them.  The black pepper should really be reduced to 1/2t unless you like tasting black pepper in every bite.  I also recommend adding 2-3t of mrs. dash or equivalent or it will be very bland as the chicken has no flavor.  If you use frozen chicken breasts, just add 1 more hour to the cooking time.  This tastes wonderful.  Can also be served over noodles.  :)  Oh, and I always cook this in the crockpot on low not high.  My thawed chicken is always done in 4-5 hours on low, and I found the frozen veggies needed 1.5 to get soft.

Just by reading this recipe I knew I was not going to add any salt to it. Ended up putting in garlic, pepper, and fresh basil. Also, instead of any buillon I added a can of chicken broth. I know the potatoes would have been good, but I put in wheat egg noodles. Also added onions and mushrooms. I will try the potatoes next time. Very easy, creamy and yummy.

The was really excellent, with a few small changes.  As others suggested, I omitted the bouillon and used 1 can of low-sodium chicken broth.  I also combine about 1/4 cup flour with some water and added to the dish during the last 15 minutes of cooking.  Turned out nice and thick to spoon over our biscuits!  I will definitely be keeping this recipe for the next time we want chicken and biscuits!

This was really yummy!!  I have blood pressure problems so I skipped out on the celery and garlic salt, and boulion cubes - and used plain garlic, a big family sized can of cream of chicken soup, and one small can of cream of celery soup!  I also just added the potatoes, a chopped onion, bag of frozen veggies, ground pepper and herbs!!  Very good!  Very easy!!  Will for sure make many times over!!  Thank you!!

I gave this recipe 5 out of 5 even though I changed it according to a lot of the reviews. I did not add the potatoes as my family ate it over biscuits. I also omitted the salts and bouillon cubes per the advice of many reviewers. I did add onion and one can of chicken broth. This recipe was AMAZING!!!! I have two very picky kids and they both ate this with no complaint. It really does taste like the filling of chicken pot pie. If you have not tried this recipe you need to run out and get the ingredients to make it for dinner tonight!! Thank you so much for sharing this!!! Also, I had plenty of leftovers to enjoy later and enough to freeze for another meal.

Great flavor but WAY too salty!  I would suggest using garlic powder instead of garlic salt and use low sodium bouillon.  Other than that - great recipe! Served over home made biscuits - YUM!

I made a half recipe omitting the salt. Half just about filled up my whole crock pot! I wouldn't cut your chicken pieces too small as mine fell apart when stirring. Enjoyed it served over biscuits.

This is a great base recipe.  I was looking for a crock pot recipe that would yield something similar to chicken pot pie and this fits the bill.  However, I wouldn't go with the recipe as it is.  I agree with others that say this recipe can be modified in a million different ways.  Here's my rendition.

First off, 10 potatoes is way too many - I added 5 small ones and it was plenty - and you don't need two 24-oz cans of soup.  I used a large, oval crock pot and I used two 16-oz cans of cream of chicken and one 16-oz can of cream of celery.  I also added three 16-oz cans of chicken broth, because otherwise, it's way too concentrated.  

I didn't have any celery but substituted about 2 cups of broccoli florets and it came out great.  I also DID NOT add the 3 teaspoons of various salts and 6 boullion cubes that the recipe calls for.  Does anyone add salt to canned soup?  Of course not, let alone this much.  Given the 3 cans of chicken broth I added, I did add two tablespoons of Knorr Caldo de Pollo chicken boullion powder, and it was plenty.  I also added celery seed since i didn't have celery, a generous sprinkling of Mrs. Dash and reduced the pepper to 1 tsp.  Also added two heaping spoonfuls of Christopher Ranch garlic and one chopped onion.

This came out great prepared as I described, and it is wonderful served over noodles or biscuits.

Delicious just as it is!  Veggies were perfect and chicken was moist and tender.  We'll definitely make this dish again.  Thanks!

I really enjoyed this meal.  I didn't have celery or frozen mixed vegies - I just used carrots, potatoes and corn. I added a little creole seasoning as I like all my food with a little kick.  The part I did that was different was that I used a biscuit layer right on top (I took it from Paula Deen's shephard's pie recipe).  So, when the stew had cooked in the slow cooker for 4 hours - I took it out, added a biscuit recipe (2C self-rising flour, 6T mayo, 1C milk) and spread it over the stew - popped it in the oven for 30 mins (or till golden) and it is a biscuit-topped stew.  Very filling.

I am giving this a 5 because my husband & kids all said it's a keeper and they are fairly picky. Plus i had a surprise guest (who it turns out hates chicken pot pie) and he said it was great and wanted the recipe.  Having said that, I plan to make a few modifications next time. 1) I omitted all salt & decreased the pepper in the recipe as most reviews suggested that I do so. I will definitely be adding more pepper next time. I only used about a tsp and will prob end up using the entire TBSP as the recipe suggests. 2) I decreased the bouillion as suggested (some even omitted) and only used one cube, but will definitely up it to 2 or 3 and will see how that goes before I start experimenting with the amount of salt I add. I did not add the baby carrots, as my frozen mixed vegetables were plenty. I will also be adding onion next time, because I love onion in just about everything, and think it will work well with this.

Followed advice on other reviews. I halved the recipe because I was only cooking for two. Changed garlic salt to garlic powder, halved the black pepper, only added half of a bullion cube. I added about 1/2 cup chicken stock and 1/2 cup milk to give it some creaminess. Overall a good recipe if you change the salt ratios. Super easy to make.

This is a great recipe for a busy family and my kids loved it.  But 6 boullion cubes?!?  That is the equivalent of 1/4 cup salt!!! I used 2 and it was sufficient because the condensed soup is very high in sodium as it is.  Used a bit of homemade chicken stock I had on hand as well to add a bit of moisture.  I've added green beans on occasion and any other leftover veggies I might have and it has been a winner.  Just reduce the bouillon cubes and you'll be pleased.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I took the suggestion of other reviews and omitted the salts.  I also didn't bother cutting up the chicken breasts.  I just put them on the bottom of the crock pot then after 5 hours of cooking I took a fork and shredded the meat.  It was delicious and the left overs were great too!

Very Good.  Did make a few changes - I used 1  14 oz can each of condensed cream of celery, and condensed cream of chicken, used 1 can of chicken broth and added 2 teaspoons of instant chicken bouillon instead of 6 bouillon cubes.   Also just added frozen peas, not mixed veggies and halved the amount of potatoes.   Cooked on high in 3 hours and served with biscuits.  Even my picky kids liked it!

Just made it, its sitting in the crock pot. I wanted to 5-STAR this before tasting it simply for the easy and simple prep work. . . I'll be back tomorrow to see how the flavor is!.......... And I was correct! THis stuff is INCREDIBLE! the only difference I did was to use fresh instead of frozen veggies. Had it on low for 10 hours and the consistenc was PERFECT when I went to eat it (served over biscuits)
Thanks for this awesome, easy and DELICIOUS recipe!

SOOO salty!  I only added 2 bouillon cubes and it was way to salty. I will try this agin but I will not but any bouillon cubes in. 
I did add seasoning to it, oregano, basil, bit of paprika.  I would do garlic powder not salt, and I didn't add celery salt. I also added almost a can of water
Way to many salty things in here. Just watch out for that.

There are a couple of things you can do here that makes this recipe better/easier.  First, I add celery seed and garlic powder, minus the salt.  There is already plenty of sodium in the chicken soup and bouillon and, in fact, I also cut the bouillon in half.  I add about a soup can and a half of water to the mix so that there is more "gravy" at the end to soak up with biscuits.  Also, I don't add the baby carrots.  I just buy frozen veggies with peas and carrots to add towards the end.  Overall, this one is a keeper.

This was really good! I love chicken pot pies usually, but hate those big frozen peas and half the time the carrots never get done, so I thought this would be great to try. I changed it up a little though. using only 5 potatoes, I felt 10 would be a little over kill. I used 3 regular cans of cream of chicken and one of celery, I also added just a little chicken broth. I didn't add any bouillon cubes at all after reading the other reviews about it being too salty. I also didn't use frozen veggies, I used can peas and corn. I didn't waste time cutting the chicken up either, I put in 3 whole frozen breasts and let it cook on low for about 8 hours. I served mine over biscuits and it was a hit!

This was great. I served it over "Baking Powder Drop Biscuits". I followed the recipe exactly but added a can of corn and a can of green beans instead of the frozen veggies. Thanks for a great recipe!

Yummy! I did a quick saute' of the onions, celery, carrots and potatoes in butter with a sprinkle of kosher salt, pepper and fresh thyme before tossing it in the crock pot.  Also lightly browned the cubes of chicken and then tossed them in.  I made my own roux and used low sodium chicken broth and a packet of Herb Ox No Sodium Chicken Boullion. I added the cream of chicken soup and then some milk to thin it down a bit more, garlic powder rather than the garliuc salt, and more thyme. It was absolutely delicious!  Developing the flavors was an extra step that was really worth it.

Made this on a day that I was going to be out of the house all day.  I cooked it on low for 9 hours.  My husband and both of my kids absolutely loved it.  It was very tasty with just the right amount of pepper.  I did put pillsbury biscuits on top the last 25 minutes it was cooking for the crust.  A definite make again dish for us

This dish was good!  I did substituted some things:  I used a bag of frozen vegetables for stew instead of the Fresh veggies.  They were Kroger brand and contained:  Carrots, Pearl Onions, Baby Carrots, Peas and Celery.  I also used 1 103/4 oz can of cream of chicken soup and 1 10 3/4 oz can of cream of potato soup.  I substituted low fat and low sodium chicken broth for the bouillion and garlic powder, celery seed and ground white pepper (1 teaspoon) for the seasonings. 

The key to not having the chicken taste bland (as some reviewers complained about) is to season the chicken before it is cut up and added to the crock pot.   I seasoned my chicken with garlic powder, black pepper and Lawry's Seasoning salt.   I cooked on high for 4 hours then added the veggies and cooked on low for another hour and a half.  I served the pot pie over flaky biscuits and my family loved it!

Made this with 5 leg quarters, 2 cups water, 2 TBS "Better than Boullion" (chicken flavor), and 6 red bliss quartered potatoes. I omitted the salted spices and used garlic powder and celery seed. Pepper quantity was mistype lm sure, salt & pepper to taste! After these changes, I followed the recipe pretty closely. After 5 hours in crockpot on high I removed and boned chicken. I omitted the canned soups and thickend with 3 TBS cornstarch mixed with 1/4 cup cold water, adding slowly to crockpot set on high. After 15 minutes I returned chicken to crock along with 1/2 bag of frozen corn. Served in bowls over baking powder bicuits. Great pot pie flavor, much easier than oven preparation! Also used J P 's bid daddy's biscuits from this site!

i used lower sodium broth, no bullion, love the carrots, ommited the potato's, , the herbs were fine, onion great, added fresh mushrooms, instead of potatos, it gave it an earthy taste, low sodium broth, and pepper to your liking, now i would give it 2 stars more.

I followed the VIDEO recipe almost to the letter and this was really excellent!  That is, I used only one bouillon cube, one teaspoon of pepper and I used garlic powder in place garlic salt.  (Even with those changes it was still fairly salty, which was just fine for our taste buds, but some might want to cut down even more on the salt by eliminating the celery salt. ) Was really really easy, no fuss -- I served over those Pillsbury type bake in the oven biscuits that come in a tube.  Yum!

Definately look at the other reviews before attempting this recipe.  I only used 1 chicken bouillon cube and it was still a little on the salty side.  Also, the 1 Tbsp of pepper was way too much.  I would use only 1 tsp of black pepper.  The chopping and cubing of the potatoes, and chicken was a little time consuming.  With these changes I will make again.  This was great served over canned jumbo biscuits.  It makes a very large amount, probably enough for a family of four to eat off of 2-3 times.

Why would anyone use garlic/celery salt vs. fresh ingredients? It's no wonder this dish is so salty! You can ALWAYS add salt, but can't take it away. Plus its better to let individuals add what they prefer. Forget chicken breasts. Go with skinless thighs for more flavor.  Last but not least, a little cumin or curry powder might taste good. Sprinkle of chili flakes. The Connasewer has spoken.

I wish I would have read the reviews before I threw all the ingredients into the crock pot! This was inedible. So salty that I dubbed it 'High Blood Pressure in a Pot.' I agree with others this could be excellent - IF YOU LEAVE OUT THE BOUILLON!!!!!

With tweaks this recipe is "phenomenal" (to quote my husband).   I used reduced fat and sodium soups....one cream of chicken and one cream of mushroom because that is what I had on hand.  I used reduced sodium chicken broth instead of the bouillon and water.  I used about 2 tsp minced garlic and 1 tsp celery seed.  In addition, since some reviewers said it was bland, I added a package of Italian Dressing mix, and 1 tsp of poultry seasoning.  Instead of the frozen vegetables I added a couple of handfuls of dry broccoli slaw (shredded broccoli, carrots and cabbage).

This is "meh" as a recipe. It doesn't have much flavor (except salt). I seasoned it as the recipe was written (just garlic salt, celery salt, and pepper) and found it to be very bland. I ended up adding dried parsley, terragon, and thyme to give it more flavor, and then sauteed some onions and fresh garlic & added these to the crock pot in the last hour. It was very easy to make, but really needs some oomph.

I did make some changes to suit my own taste. I put 2 whole frozen chicken breasts in the crock pot followed by 2 10.75 oz cans cream of chicken and one 10.75 oz can cream of mushroom, then one can of chicken broth. didn't use celery, chopped up 6 carrots, used 1 bag frozen peas, used 8 small potatoes, omitted chicken bouillon, 1 1/2 tsp pepper, 1 tsp celery SEED, 1 tsp garlic salt, 1 tsp poultry seasoning, and 3 cloves fresh minced garlic. then shredded chicken after 6 hours and mixed in some flour to thicken a little.

Made this for the first time a month or so ago & about to make it again today!! Absolutely LOVED it!!! Soon as I seen the recipe I knew I wasn't going to add ANY salt at all, there's already enough in what I use! Used 2 bonless/skinless chicken breasts, 1cup & a bit of chicken broth.. Oh I also seasoned my chicken BEFORE putting it into my crockpot & then added some more once it was in. I also used a few packets of chicken powder instead of the bouillon cubes.. Instead of frozen veggies I just added some carrots and a can of corn& some potatoes!! Cooked it on high for about 4hrs & it was perfect!!! I can honestly say I didn't have a single complaint about it, when made this way!! Everyone has their own way of making stuff and what might taste good to some, may not be the same for others! That's one thing I love about cooking, you can always make it the way YOU want it!!!!

First time I tried this and the family said it was a keeper and my oldest took some home with him.  I have to say I never use regular bouillon I use herbox sodium free granulated chicken bouillon so I didn't have any issue with saltiness nor do I use garlic salt I'll just add minced garlic and celery salt I just added Mrs. Dash instead. 
Will definitely make again  because it was a quick yet tasteful recipe.

Don't throw the baby out with the bath water OR in this case the Pot Pie Out w/ the SALT Water. Good news Bad News.  Bad News: More salt than is tolerable.  Good news: So darn easy to fix. Use only one bouillon cube (OR better yet, 1 t. of "BETTER Than Bouillon" (saves 110 mg sodium PER CUBE & tastes better) For the remaining 5 cubes use Herbox Chicken Bouillon powder. It comes in a jar OR envelopes. You still get good chicken flavor BUT NO SODIUM.(Find them w /the canned soups, top shelf) That way you can adjust the salty taste( and sodium Level) but leave the chicken flavor in tact. Also switch the Garlic salt to Garlic POWDER. you may need  to use LESS...about 1/2 For the celery salt,switch to GROUND celery seeds. Again more celery flavor ( using 1/2 amt listed)and much less sodium. The cream of chicken soup has more than 800 mg of sodium, (per serving) so if you love a salty taste, there is plenty of salt in that. Keep in mind also that even "no salt added " broths have over 100 mg sodium PER SERVING and "low sodium broths/ stocks have FAR more sodium than that. As for the rest of the recipe, I add 1  to 2 t. of FRESH thyme leaves (Or 1/4t to 1/2 t. dried thyme....but fresh is far better) I also add in 1/4 to 1/2t. poultry seasoning.  Both the FRESH thyme and poultry  seasoning add a much more home made taste.

I was looking for a recipe that would use ingredients already in my freezer and pantry.  This one fit the bill.  Love the "one pot" prep.  I modified the recipe as follows (and halved the other ingredients listed):  1 veggie boullion cube, 1/4 C water, 1/2 t poultry season, no additional salts, 1/4 cup chopped onion, deleted the additional salts, skipped the baby carrots, and added frozen peas and carrots instead of the mixed veggies. Baked a can of crescent rolls "flat", and served the stew over them (extra flaky).  Plus Side green salad.  Great dinner!

This was delicious!  I was out of celery and had to leave it out, so I added a can of cream of celery soup.  Instead of chicken bouillon, I used a can of chicken broth.  I use frozen corn and green beans because my husband is allergic to peas that are in the mixed vegetables.  I served over biscuits.  It's perfect for those nights that you need a crockpot meal.  I added everything all at once.  Because I added the canned broth, I did need to add a cornstarch slurry.  This was really good and I will add this to my monthly rotation.  The only reason I gave it a 4 is because I feel that the chicken bouillon would have been too salty.  Thanks for sharing!

This was so good!! I halved the recipe, and mine was not watery at all!! Very thick!! After reading other reviews, I was a little nervous that it would be too salty, so used no bouillon cubes, but chicken stock instead. Didn't measure, but used maybe 1/2-2/3 cup. Used a little less celery salt, and garlic powder instead of garlic salt. All in all, a great and easy recipe. Thanks to GourmetSoy!!

As a stay-at-home mom who is constantly chasing after an energetic young child, I appreciate easy and tasty slow cooker recipes so, so much. This one was great — no fancy ingredients with simple directions. Something I can prep in a short time, which sometimes is all I can manage!

I would rate it higher, but I made the following changes, so I can't properly rate the cook's original recipe.

1) I omitted the potatoes since I planned on serving this with biscuits.
2) I omitted the chopped celery & baby carrots because I didn't have any.
3) Replaced cream of chicken soup with condensed cream of portobello mushroom since it was the only condensed soup I had.
4) Omitted the chicken bouillon.
5) Added 1 cup of chicken stock.
6) Sprinkled some flour to help thicken the sauce toward the end of cooking.

For easier prep, I also didn't cube the chicken before putting into the crock pot. I just left the breasts as is, then shredded them with two forks about an hour before being done (around the same time I added the flour).

Yes, I made changes. There HAS to be a mistake...1 TBL pepper?! I used 1 tsp pepper & it was still really peppery. I also used garlic powder instead of the garlic salt & 3 tsp of chicken base in place of the bouillon cubes & no extra salt(yikes!). Skipped the celery. I would def use more chicken next time, the ratio was way off. Now, w/the changes I made, it was good, not great. There's no way I would like it w/added salt or the amt of pepper called for. Maybe that's a personal pref, but I think the amts called for are extreme(obviously others feel the same way since so many changed the recipe also). Hard recipe to rate....3.5-4 stars w/changes.

This was excellent! Veggies weren't too mushy, chicken was tender and not too salty. I added a little Mrs. Dash into it for kicks too.

This was pretty good ... we added more liquid (thank goodness, because it was still pretty dry).  I wasn't crazy about the addition of the can of soup ... I felt that the same flavor could have been gotten with something less processed.  We enjoyed it the first night but we ended up throwing away the leftovers so that says something....
11/14.  Made again using 2 big cans of soup and one can chix broth.  Was nice and loose and served over biscuits.  Tasted good but again I find it to be too processed... I mean, I'd never eat Campbell's soup as a dinner and that's pretty much what this is, with veggies and chix added.  Won't make again and bringing down my 4 star rating to 3.

I have gluten and dairy allergies so I made some revisions :)  I first covered the chicken pieces in an "all purpose" organic spice that I have and then put the chicken in a pan to not "brown" it but slightly cook the outsides.. until "white".
 
I made a gluten/dairy free substitution for the "cream of soup":  4 tablespoons of earth balance butter melted in a pot, added 4 tablespoons of rice flour then 1 1/4 cups of rice milk.  I ended up adding about 1/2 a cup of chicken broth to the crockpot because I realized that it called for 2 cans of "cream of soup".  
 
I used 1, gluten free, all natural chicken bullion cube.. actually I may of added another 1/2 of a cube.
 
I did add salt and pepper and some onion powder.
 
Then I added a few stalks of celery and a few fresh carrots (chopped) and added a 16 oz bag of frozen veggies (potato, onion, carrot, celery).. wish I would of added peas!

This was SO good!  I put some pillsubury biscuits in the oven (for family) to go along with!  Thanks so much for sharing this!!! :)

This was too salty for my taste even without the bouillon.  I would try omitting the garlic salt and celery salt and instead just using garlic powder and celery seed.

I thought this was really good, but I used a can of chicken broth instead of the boullion, and I did not use the baby carrots and celery.  I would suggest cutting the potatoes into smaller pieces so you don't have these giant chunks.  If interested, this recipe is 7 points for 1 cup if you are on WW.  I also found this delicious with saltine crackers crumbled in instead of a biscuit.  It does make a ton, so if you make the recipe as written, you definitely need at least a 5-qt slow cooker.  I was able to freeze half of it.

Good recipe we loved it -- but I did alter it some after checking amounts.  Did not use bouillon -- I don't care for that fake taste, I used 1 cup chicken broth instead.  Also did not have any celery salt so I used a leafy center stalk and just removed before serving.  Also did not add carrots since my mixed veggies had them in already.  Served with crescent rolls, gravy was nice and creamy.  Might add another can of cream of chicken soup with 1/2 can of milk next time -- we love extra gravy.

Easy and delicious! Made 1/2 the recipe but cut potatoes down to 1/4. Added onion and changed some of the veggies to suit our tastes. Drastically reduced salt and bullion but still used some. Will DEFINITELY make this again!

Great flavor and so easy but too salty. I hate tampering with people's recipes too much but this has enough sodium for a week. I fixed by subbing a teaspoon of minced garlic for the garlic salt, omitting the celery salt and bouillon cubes, just using one can of the condensed soup and adding a can of lower sodium chicken broth. Needs thickening with corn starch mixed with a little cold water.

Really delicious! I eliminated celery (I hate it), the salts, and took the bullions down to two, based on other reviews. Came out delicious. Would be great with biscuits.

I just finished cooking this and with a few changes it is absolutely amazing! I used Garlic Powder instead of Garlic Salt and I did the same with Celery Powder. I only used 2 bouillon cubes. I used 2 cans cream of chicken with one can each cream of mushroom and cream of celery. Everything else was the same... it tastes like home :)

Tried this recipe but made a few changes (I'm borderline hypertensive so this was WAY too much salt - especially 6 bouillon cubes) so I used the low sodium soup (I did two chicken and added a mushroom) and used no bouillon cubes but I did chop up some sweet onion and put it in there.  My family came in the door begging for dinner and couldn't wait for me to finish it up!  The chicken was wonderful - moist and tender!  Will be doing this recipe again and again!

I left out all of the bouillon cubes, the celery salt, and the garlic salt, and it was STILL salty from the undiluted canned soup. Maybe it would be better with low-sodium soup or I'm just sodium-sensitive, I'm not sure which.

I used fresh cracked pepper, so I may not have added exactly 2 tablespoons.  I also used chicken base instead of bouillon cubes. I ended up adding cornstarch towards the end to get it to thicken up a bit.  

I thought it was okay, but my husband thought it was too bland.  Everyone finished what they took, but only one person out of 7 went back for seconds.

I really enjoyed this.  I think I would like to top it off with some "canned" biscuits, put those in the crockpot the last 30 mins and it would be a nice topping...it was perfect though as is!

Even elimanating the bouillon and halving the salt was not enough.  The dish was to salty, I am willing to make again w/out adding any salt though.  Everyone in the family ate it, loved the crockpot simplicity, too.

I really like this recipe.  Easy to put together and easy to serve.  Most of the family like it a lot.  I changed some minor things - I left out the bullion (didn't have any) and added a tsp of chicken stock base.  I also added approx. 1 tsp of dried thyme, 2 tsp dried parsley and some garlick powder.  I would definately make again.

I loved how easy it was to make this stew! My husband is the pickiest eater I know, and even he went back for seconds. The stew was salty for me- but not enough to stop me from eating it- and my dad said it had too much pepper for him. I like spice so this didn't bother me. Next time, I will use garlic powder instead of garlic salt, and maybe go without the celery salt. Also, it was rather thick, even for a stew, so I would add some wine to water it down a bit. Definitely worth trying and modifying to personal taste!

4 Stars only b/c I made a few subtle (spice/herb) changes. Otherwise, this was delicious and PERFECT for my family as my son cannot eat wheat yet hubby wanted a "pot pie"! I did also cook potatoes separately as mashed potatoes. Even my sons (ages 2 and 4) who are occasionally the typical picky eaters, loved it!  Overall, great recipe and I will be making this again and again!

I think I will try this recipe but I would add some butter, heavy cream, and flour and skip the bouillon and cream of chicken soup....instead use chicken stock. Sounds sooooo yummy!!:) I am rating this as my way of making the recipe.

At the last minute I realized this actually calls for 4 regular-size cans of cream of chicken.  I had 3 and used one cream of mushroom, but otherwise followed the recipe, shorting the potatoes by half because mine were large.  There is definitely too much pepper and the salt needs to be reduced as well.  That being said the teenager and I thought it was really good.

This is quite the comfort food.  Taking the advice of other reviewers I cut the bouillon in half and it was perfect.  The first time I added the celery and celery salt and it had a funny taste so I left it out the second time, if you don't like the taste of celery all that much, skip it.

This soup was great!  I did take other reviews into account and skipped the boullion, but added some low salt chicken broth.  I also only used garlic powder, and skipped the celery salt (didn't have).   It was not lacking in salt or flavour at all.  I can't imagine how salty it would taste with the omitted salts!

this was outstanding! The only issue was I think I put in too much pepper...but next time less pepper and it will be even better! I loved it, a great "lower" fat version of chicken pot pie.

This turned out so delicious! It was very easy to make and the ingredients were inexpensive. I did, however, make way too much for my small family of 3 and next time I think I will cut the recipe in half.

Easy to make and it turned out delicious, I did cut back the bouillon to two as that's all I had and no celery salt as I had none.  Served it over the biscuits and everyone loved it.   
It makes a real good size recipe.

This was really good but I do prefer it in a pie shell!  I used chicken broth in place of the cream soup and bouillon (too much sodium).  I also didn't add carrots or celery, I just used a bag of frozen veggies that included them. I used a can of sliced potatoes instead of fresh.

I really liked this with just a few minor modifications - I layered 1 onion, about 2.3lbs chicken tenders, 1 packet onion mushroom dry soup mix, potatoes, carrots, celery, and 2 cans cream-o-chicken mixed with about 1/4 cup heavy cream. Cooked about 5.30 hours and came out creamy! VERY GOOOOOOD!! I will be making these again!

Nice, EASY, comfort food. We ate it served over biscuits.  Because of the biscuit, I cut way bak on potatoes. Plan to make often......Wow! I made this again and can't believe how salty it is.  It's barely edible. I made exactly as written. Last time I must have cut the bouillon. Next time 1 only!  I've added another can of soup and am adding tsps of lemon juice trying to cut the salt.  Arrrghh Reading reviews is important.

I found it to be very salty - I would recommend using the reduced sodium chicken soup and grabbing 4 smaller cans rather than the 2 large "family size" cans.  It will yield about 4 ounces less in your soup base but will be fairly insignificant in the long run.

Made this as is (didn't read reviews first--my mistake) and the amount of pepper called for made it inedible.  No one could eat it.  It was a shame, since I could tell it would have been delicious. I will make again using only 1 teaspoon of pepper.

Tastes pretty good and easy to make. I pretty much followed the recipe, except I didn't notice that it called for (2) 26 oz cans of soup, I thought it was 2 of the regular size. So I wound up using 3 regular sized cans. Also, I was out of garlic salt and celery salt so I used garlic powder and celery seed. Good thing because for someone that likes salt, and salts almost everything, this was almost too salty for me because of all the bouillon! And I did use the full tablespoon of pepper and glad I did. I'm not a big fan of pepper but I thought it added a great flavor and it was the perfect amount. Next time I'd love to serve this over biscuits. I thought because there were potatoes it wouldn't need it, but this would have been fantastic over biscuits!

This could have been a great dish.  The 1 Tbsp of pepper overshadowed all of the other flavors. I love good, spicy foods.  But this was all pepper!  Before serving to my little kids, I strained the chicken, vegetables, etc. in water.  Then served on biscuits for them.   But even for the adults, it was way too peppery.  I look forward to trying this recipe with maybe just 1 tsp of pepper.

Very good with a few changes. Don't use all those bouillon cubes. I use 2 spoonfulls of the powder chicken base. Not so much pepper either. I also use 3 cans of cream of chicken instead of two. Makes it much thicker if you are going for that pot pie feel. For sure over biscuits is how we do it and my kids love it!

I used only one chicken bouillon cube and added a can of  low sodium chicken broth and thickened with corn starch near the end.  
Would definitely make again!  Nice comfort food!

Wow..this recipe was delicious after a few trials and modifications!
I made this dish three times and the third time was the charm.  The last batch was made for the holidays and it was big hit- with the grown ups and the kids. 


I took out the baby carrots (it didn't wow me the first time I made it) and put in another small bag of frozen veggies, plus two more small potatoes. I only used two boullion cubes and omitted both the celery and garlic salts all together (as others mentioned, the original recipe is too salty). 

Overall, it was easy to make and fuss-free. Serve it on top of biscuits or white rice.

This would have been delicious had it not been for the overwhelming amount of salt! Next time I may only use 1 bouillon cube if at all. Also, I highly recommend using a 6.5 quart cooker for this size recipe. 4 qt was too small. I plan to try the recipe again without all the extra salt.

I will make this again but makes some changes.  I used 10 med to large red potatoes, peeled and cubed.  I cut back to 3 bullion cubes.  The end result was that it was still way too salty and there were too many potatoes to my liking.  It was more like potato soup.  The first thing out of my families mouths were "wow, this is really salty". I will cut back to one bullion cube, delete the celery salt, and use 6 potatoes. Just my HO.

Would recommend this recipe - it is quick to assemble and is a very hearty and tasty meal.  I recommend following others' guidance: garlic powder vice garlic salt, only two bouillon cubes.  I also think 10 potatoes is way too many; go with 5 and cube them rather than just quartering them.  My big issue is that the baby carrots did not cook all the way through; next time I would try regular carrots cut into 1/2" circles.  I also was in a pinch for time, so I cooked in high for 3.5 hours, and then another 45 min once I added the frozen vegetables.  I note that many other people thought it was a bit dry and so added broth; I did not find that to be true.  I thought the stew was just as moist as a regular chicken pot pie.

Between the seasonings and so many bouillon cubes, it was too salty for me. I added some fresh parsley and served it on a bed of Kentucky Biscuits, also on the AR site. I really wasn't feeling up to cooking a big dinner. This quick and easy recipe fit the bill nicely, and hubs enjoyed.

Great meal!  However, I left out the carrots, celery, chicken bouillon and garlic salt.  I threw the chicken, new potatoes, soup, salt and pepper, couple of shakes of celery salt, 2 tbsp of chopped garlic and the frozen veggies in to the crock pot at 7am on low.  Came home at 6:15pm and it was AWESOME!  And the veggies were not mushy at all!  Definitely a favorite!

5 stars, following the advice of other reviewers.  I skipped the chicken bouillon, I used  1 tsp. pepper, 1 tsp garlic salt & 1 tsp chopped garlic.  I added chopped onions.  I served without noodles or bis quits, as the potatoes were enough carbs. I cooked on low for 5 hours, added frozen veggies, and cooked for another hour on low.  Even my picky 5 year old loved it!

This recipe is delicious, and the recipe as listed does make a LOT. I too served over buttermilk biscuits. I prepared the dish as written, except followed others' advice and used only 2 bouillon cubes. Next time (and there will be a next time) I will cut the black pepper to about 3/4 tablespoon.

I was worried about salt after reading reviews so I didn't add any extra - no bouillon, used garlic powder and it had plenty with just the cream of chicken soup. Rated it 4 stars because I think if I'd added the extra salt, it would've been too salty. Great over biscuits!

I've made this twice now.  I cut out the salt completely, and the buillion.  Added a bit of milk.  I also added Rosemary, basil, and chili flakes for some spice.  
I didn't use any frozen veggies, and added broccoli.
First time, I served it with biscuits, and second time, with fresh thick slices of bread.  It's very filling and easy to make.

This was way too salty., I had to add 2 cans of Cream of Potato Soup and 1 more can of cream of chicken.  If I make this again.....I will omit the salts, cut the pepper in half,  and maybe add 1 bouillon cube.  I will still add 1 onion though and try 1 (10 3/4oz) of potato and 2 (10 3/4oz.) chicken soups.

I have never reviewed before, but I just had to this time. Wow! Disappointing.  I didn't understand why the recipe called for buillion cubes and other reviews said it was too salty. So, I used chicken stock.  I followed the recipe exactly except the cooking time and the stuff curdled. It looked horrible and it was watery. What's more, it was bland, bland, bland.

Made this tonight and served it over biscuit. Also added some pearl onions to the meal and frozen vegetables. The only think is it was a bit too thick because I think it was in the crock pot for too long, sort of evaporated even on low.  Will make this again, even the kids eat some.

Pleasantly pleased with this.  I cut out the bouillon and added a can of low fat non msg chix broth to thin out a bit.  Not very salty.  Everyone had seconds.

After reading other reviews, I used this as a basic recipe and added my favorite veggies, etc...I did not add salt or use bouillon, as other reviewers mentioned it was too salty.  I just used lots of frozen veggies and it was great.  The only problem was that it was EXTREMELY peppery.  I saw some other reviewers with the same problem, and I realized what I/they probably did wrong - I got 2 normal cans of condensed soup, not 26 oz cans.  So, in essence I had like 1/2 the soup base.  I found the consistency to be perfect, though, so next time I will just add pepper to taste instead of adding more soup.

After reading reviews & cutting way back on the salt by using lower sodium items and chicken stock instead of bouillon, it was PERFECT! The consistency was creamy & delicious. Satisfied our huge family from 2 years old to 55 years old!!

A new family favorite at my house! I followed the reciepe as listed and everything turned out perfect.  I was a little worried reading some of the others, but mine was fine (not overly salty).  Will be a staple week night supper from now on! 5 stars!

I made whole wheat dumplings as a suggestion from my hubby and cooked them right on top. Theu plumped up beautifully and smell wonderful. I also followed some of the other suggestions and decreased the salt and chicken cubes. I used fresh veggies including broccoli and some frozen peas.

My picky kids loved this!  I served it in puff pastry shells and it was a big hit.  I would suggest cutting down on the bouillon by 2 cubes since I think 6 cubes would have made this quite salty.  Overall, an easy crowd pleaser.

I made the recipe exactly except I didn't use potatoes.  We had it over rice instead.  Way too much salt and pepper such that there was no other flavor.

Very good!  I left out the extra potatoes, so we had more soup mixture.  I also left out the celery salt and substituted galic powder for the garlic salt. My family really enjoyed it.

This is a good recipe for comfort food.  Condensed soups are most always high in sodium content.  To get around this purchase the low or no salt cans.  It is also possible to get no salt chicken bouillion. or broth.  I use the broth myself.  A dash of poultry seasoning also adds flavor to the dish.  Happy eating :o)

I omitted the garlic salt, celery salt and only used 1/2 the bouillon cubes. I did add 1/4 teaspoon of garlic and 1/2 cup chopped onion. With my changes everyone loved it and will make it again, my way ;o) I do think the original recipe would of been to salty.

I think this turned out really well.  I used the powdered bouillon instead of the cubes, and just sprinkled some in, so I don't really know measurements, but I'm positive it was less than the recipe called for.  I also didn't add the baby carrots as the veggies I was using had carrots in them. I think this turned out a lot better than the other chicken pot pie crock pot recipe on this site.

I left out the potatoes and added brown rices at the end when adding the frozen veggies. This made it more of a "casserole" but also a healthier alternative to serving over biscuits! Great "comfort food" especially for chilly weather!

Lots of points for being easy!  But it turned out to be really good too.  I didn't add any extra carrots since my mixed veggies had carrots and I only used one bouillon cube.  Made some quick biscuits to go along w/ it and was done.  It was even better as leftovers! Thanks!!

This came out great. I modified to serve 6, used 3 frozen chicken breasts and placed them in the bottom of the crock pot. I used 5 red potatoes cut up into chunks, but will make them even smaller because we like our taters soft, and even after 6 hours on high, then were still slightly hard.  Used 7oz of baby carrots, but since we like our carrots super soft like the potatoes, I boiled them for about 12 min first, then cut into bite size chunks.  Added it all to the pot, topped with 2 cans of c of chicken soup and 1 can of chicken broth. Didn't add any of the salts it asked for and added 1 tsp of minced garlic and 1/2  tsp black pepper.  Cooked on high for about 4.5 hours.  Took the chicken breasts out and cut into bite sized pieces and added back to the pot.  About 35 min before easting I added about a cup each of frozen peas and corn and let it cook for the remaining time.  Total cooking time was about 5.5 hours on high.  Served over buttermilk biscuits and it fed my boyfriend and I for 2 nights, then took the remaining stew into work for lunch on the last day! Super yummy and will definitely make again!!!

I'm so bummed that I didn't read the reviews before making it!  The pepper and salt are so over powering.  I'll try it again some day with much less salt and pepper.

I really liked this.  I followed a lot of ppl's suggestions and did not use any bouillon cubes.  I used 3 can's of soup.  2 Cream of Chicken and 1 Cream of Celery.  I added some frozen peas and carrots and a can of corn the last hour of cooking.  I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper and seasoning salt and used 6 baking potatoes.  It came out creamy.  Kinda like a chowder.  I served it over bisquits.  My boyfriend wanted a more "pot pie" taste but I liked the "chowder" like consistancy and taste.  I cooked on high for 5 hours and low for the last hour.

I did make quite a few changes to the recipe but I found this one easy to tweak to our personal tastes.  I used 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can cream of chicken.  Only used 3 chicken breasts which I put in the crockpot whole.  Later while serving it was so easy to shred them up.  For veggies I used what needed to be used up-celery, baby carrots and onion.  Used celery seed, celery salt, parsley, rosemary, 2 cloves minced garlic and just a one chicken boullin cube to season.  It was runny, however, I transferred it to a dutch oven just before serving and added in some corn starch mixed with water to thicken.  Came out beautifully, we added salt and pepper to taste.  Thanks for a great new recipe, I will use this over and over again-this is a good one when I have lots of veggies to get rid of!

I used Better than Bullion instead of bullion cubes and garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I can control the sodium better that way. This definitely makes it in to the fall/winter dinner rotation!

1-13-2016 ~I needed to make supper tonight, but having been away from home for nearly two weeks presented challenges. I was limited by the ingredients I had on hand, by the fact that we had another snow dump today and I had no desire to go to the grocery store, and by the fact that I have been "cooking lazy" for several weeks now.  Necessity led me to this recipe.  Again, limited by the ingredients I had available and in an effort to please my own taste buds, I took a fair amount of liberty with the recipe, but kept the basic bones intact.  I added no salt, no chicken bouillon, no garlic salt, no celery salt. (Man that's a LOT of salt!!)    The soup, I believed, had enough salt already and if not, it could always be added at the table.  I had no celery.  I hate carrots.  And I haven't had mixed vegetables since I was a kid because I hate them too.  What I did have was a no salt seasoning blend, a little garlic powder, a glug of white wine (Chardonnay),  some good jarred mushrooms, a jar of pimientos, and some frozen peas. I had potatoes, but didn't include them as I wanted to serve this over pasta.  As this cooked the kitchen was filled with an incredible, mouthwatering aroma - very encouraging! It was a little too liquidy, but I stirred in a flour and water slurry and within minutes it was the perfect consistency.  This was surprisingly delicious, too delicious in fact, to have been so easy to prepare.

I used this recipe as a base since we're really sensitive to salt and garlic, and it is a great starting point for your family's likes. Basically what you like in a chicken pot pie, use for vegetables in this recipe, which is what I did. I used 4 10.75 oz cans of Healthy Choice Cream of chicken soup (do they even make 26 oz cans any more?), about 1 tablespoon of no salt seasoning blend mix from Trader Joe's (like Mrs Dash's general blend), 2 teaspoons of poultry seasoning, half a soup can of water and several grinds of fresh black pepper.  I used about 1/2 lb sliced baby carrots, two huge celery sticks diced, half of a huge onion, about a cup of fresh sliced green beans and cooked on high for 4.5 hrs, stirring half way through.  Then a half hour before it finished cooking, I fished out the chicken pieces and cut much smaller, then added a healthy cup of frozen peas.  I can't say enough about this base recipe - it is a perfect starting point and a great way to keep your kitchen cool on a hot day.

I removed the celery/garlic salt and chicken bouillon.  I added extra fresh celery, green onions, garlic and Chardonnay wine. French girl always cook with wine. ;-)
I am on paleolithic healthy eating. Oh! no buttermilk biscuits.

While watching video I didn't like idea of all the salt. But I remembered the potatoes and chicken. In the end the fresh ingredients use up the salt. I do have one question???? Why do most women come here when they have no intention of getting a recipe.They only come here re-write recipes. It's the number one reason I've never sent one in.

This was really good except in my opinion too salty. Next time I would cut the salt in half or out all together.

I'm giving it five stars because of the way I made it. =)  Like a lot of people on here I read 6 cubes of bouillon and thought it would be way too salty.  I used 3 chicken breasts, (lasted 2 days for myself, my husband and my 13 year old daughter) and I didn't cut it up, with the cooking time I used, the chicken literally shreds and falls apart once you go in to give it a whirl or two, 2 large cans of cream of chicken (I used about one and a half of those because I have the smaller crockpot), measured in the large can I measured 1/4 to 1/3 low sodium chicken stock (depends how creamy you want it), 1 tsp black pepper, I put in minced garlic to my liking to give the chicken some extra flavor, 5-6 red potatoes quartered, and one chicken cube, mixed it all up and cooked it on low for 8 hours.  On the last hour I threw in a pack of mixed veggies, any type will do.  And I topped it with Grands Biscuits.  I know it sounds starchy, but it's really good and I am more than sure that that's why it lasted for more than one day for us.  I don't have a pic but I'm making it again today, so I will share soon.  Enjoy!

It was good.  I think the cans of soup can be interchanged like some people said.  The salt can be heavy, use garlic powder instead.  I noticed some higher end chicken producers are going "no salt added" and most frozen chicken is put in brine so it freezes better, so if you are using fresh, no salt added chicken, consider the seasoned salt.  This recipe is easy to customize to your individual taste. I use the smaller 10-11 ounce cans so you can mix in different flavors.

Delicious! The only change I made was I only used 3 bouillon cubes, no extra carrots, and less celery.  I'm not sure how you would get 16 servings out of this - there were 4 of us and there was not a single bite leftover; I would say it was more like 8 servings since we all had seconds.  I served this over hot, flaky biscuits. This was definitely a comfort food!

This recipe was a great start to a wonderful meal with a few simple changes.  All those bouillon cubes would have made the stew too salty.  I omitted all of them and substituted with almost 2 cups of chicken broth.  I also  omitted the garlic and  celery salt and chopped extra celery and used 
granulated garlic(2 teaspoons).  With these 
changes, the salt content was perfect.  Thanks for a good recipe

I have made this "Chicken Stew" for some time now. My husband and I love it and chicken is healthier than beef. You can add spices to your liking or leave this recipe as is. We prefer ours with the biscuits on the side with some Margerine or butter. It's great for kids too! Our grandsons prefer this over Beef Stew.

Just made this tonight and it was a hit with everyone! I followed some suggestions from others & omitted the bullion cubes and salts, as I believe  it would be too salty, and used garlic powder and pepper. I also used fresh veggies that everyone likes (except frozen peas). I prepped the chicken by dredging in flower and spices and browning slightly in a frying pan before putting in the slow cooker. This keeps the chicken juicy & keeps the texture that my husband prefers. I will be making this again and again. Thanks!

This is Great! My whole family fell in Love with this recipe. I did substitute all the seasonings for just  4 tsps of Morton Nature's Seasons. It has all the spice's plus a few more.

This is really good if you use the regular cream of chicken soup and not the fat free.  Instead of the bouillon cubes, use 1 can chicken broth.  Instead of the frozen veggies, use 1 can mushrooms, 1 can french cut green beans, and 1 can corn. Peas optional. Also use less pepper. Use half the amount of chicken and potatoes. Add some finely chopped onion and sprinkle a little garlic powder onto the chicken.

I just love getting home and dinners ready!  Make some biscuits and your ready to eat.  I use 1/2 chicken breasts and 1/2 chicken thighs, I think it keeps it from drying out as much.  This makes so much that we can freeze 1/2 for another day.  I also like to cook this and then place in a pie shell for a "pot pie"

Made this exactly as written...all we taste is an overpowering flavor of pepper. Next time, I will add the pepper after preparing.  Also, I won't use the bouillon and change the garlic salt to garlic powder. This recipe has potential.

I cooked this on low instead of high for 5 hours, and still found that it stuck to the sides and needed a little more moisture. I also cut down on the cubes, using 2 instead of 6. Also used minced garlic instead of the salt.

Very good!  I have 3 little boys and they loved it.  I think others who use the recipe should go by the recipe.  Once you make changes to it, it's no longer THIS recipe.  Make a new recipe, don't try and "improve" or change recipes, its annoying.

Frighteningly salty. The first batch I made, I followed the recipe exactly and it was inedible and had to be pitched out.  I've made it since with some tweaks, and it's much, much better.  I leave out the bullion, the celery salt and the garlic salt altogether.  I use minced garlic and a pinch of regular table salt instead.  On occasion I have also used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken due to availability at my store, and it has worked well.  I serve it over fresh, homemade biscuits, and it's a hit.

Even better the next day.  I made some biscuits as a side to the stew.  I omitted the garlic salt and replaced with fresh.  I only used two buillion cubes and celery seed instead of celery salt because it's what I had.

Tooo much pepper!  I add Bisquick drop biscuits with 1/4 tsp poultry seasoning at the last 30 minutes point after adding the frozen mixed vegetables. I cut the potatoes into smaller pieces to make sure the aren't crunchy.

This was easy to make and tasted great. Kids loved it. I, too, left out some of the salt this calls for and it was plenty flavorful.

What a bummer! I was so excited to find this yummy sounding recipe that required little prep, and didn't require a trip to the store.  During my baby's nap, I quickly read the ingredients and threw it all together.  Half way through putting in the black pepper, I knew I had made a mistake.  A TABLESPOON of pepper?!  That is ridiculous!  It was completely inedible.  I'm so disappointed, because if the spices listed were more accurate, it would have been a good recipe.  As it is, I might try to freeze it, and when I buy more ingredients, I'll quadruple the recipe without adding any more spice.  Frozen pizza for us tonight, though.

After reading the reviews I didn't use any of the added salt and only used 2 bullion cubes.  Still a tad salty but very good.

This was wonderful. Didnt put in potatoes, added a quarter of an onion, only had 2 boullion cubes so I used 3/4 tablespoon of soup base. One can cream of chicken. Served with homemade rolls, delicious. If I wasnt so full right now Id go back for more! Perfect for busy days when I have no time to cook since the veggies were still bright in color my son had no problem wolfing this down (hes not a fan of canned, dull, not so fresh veggies)

Way too much salt and pepper in this recipe! However, with some tweaks, this becomes a great 5 star recipe. Forget the bouillon cubes. I don't use garlic salt in anything, I prefer real minced garlic, but if you do use the ground up version, try garlic powder instead of garlic salt. Much better flavor and of course, less sodium. I did not add additional carrots as called for, I simply used a large bag of mixed veggies which had lots of carrots in it already. I cook this on low for about 5 hours. I usually use cream of mushroom soup, but that is personal preference. I have also made this with cream of celery soup and it was great! Lots of ways to tweak this and make it yours.

I switched this dish up a bit. I used non-condensed cream of mushroom soup from Whole Foods, and I did pan sear the chicken before adding to the cooker for more flavor. Instead of bouillon cubes I used low sodium chicken base. I also tried what others suggested, using fewer potatoes and cutting them into smaller cubes. 

My end result was runny, despite my having added corn starch, so I ladled the liquid into a pot and added flour/milk and simmered to a gravy, which was perfect. This occurred because I had used a thinner mushroom soup, but the one I used had less sodium and fat, so that's the price I paid for a healthier option. Delicious - perfect for cold weather!

This recipe was very good.  However we found that the 1 tablespoon of pepper was way too much.  I would also add more chicken next time.

SUPER SUPER SUPER SALTY!! I love salt, don't get me wrong, but it probably doesn't need any of the bouillon or additional salt.  I had to keep adding water and milk to try and dilute it, which ended up making it runny. luckily the biscuit helped soak that up.  I will make this again and I do recommend it, but wow, the amount of salt...

Like several other reviewers, I used chicken broth instead of cream of chicken soup. I also did not use bouillon, but added in some basil and a bay leaf. I used garlic powder and celery flakes instead of garlic salt. I had sweet potatoes on hand, so I used that instead of russet potatoes. We loved it. Only problem was that there wasn't enough! I didn't add any frozen veggies, so I'm guessing that is the reason for less. What I got was probably only about 6 servings worth.

Definitely needs tweeking, but has real potential. First off, way too much pepper. My 5 year old wouldn't eat it because it was too "spicy". Cut the pepper in half. I adjusted too because it seems like it has way too much salt too. I used 4 bouillon cubes, heart healthy cream of chicken (lower sodium) , and omitted the celery salt. It could just be my crockpot, but I suggest stirring half way through. Not all my potatoes were cooked completely.

I think for this to be more like a "chicken pot pie" (yes, I know it says stew....the addition of some crust type topping at the last 30 of cooking would be nice, even using biscuits  to top or serve over.

Simple, easy, and oh so tasty.  Big, BIG hit in our family.  I followed the one bouillon cube recommendation and reduced the garlic salt to one (1) teaspoon (and that was only done after completing this dish without any changes).  Friends and family now want this recipe. Mmmm - Mmmm Good.

I did what I normally do not do make changes to a recipe before I rate them. I only made half of what the recipe called for. I followed some recomendations and the video skipped the bouillon cubes, instead I used a can (10 ounces) of chicken broth. I used garlic powder not the garlic salt and celery seed instead of the celery salt. With that said I followed the rest of the recipe and it turned out very good. Will keep this recipe with the changes made.

TOO MUCH SALT!  The recipe calls for six bullion cubes, but even the video shows just one!  It is simple to prepare and very tasty, easy to change up...might be good with a little thyme in it as well.
By the way, this recipe should be halved for a normal meal...easily serves 10 with these quantities.

It was a very good "all in one" meal. Had to make some changes because of what I had on hand. I used four skinned leg quarters and put them in the bottom of the cooker. In a large bowl, I mixed all of the other ingredients (changes were: 2 lbs red potatoes, 1 cream of chicken, 1 cream of mushroom, 1 chicken bouillon cube, 1 teaspoon pepper). All of the other ingredients used were as listed. After 5 hours I added 1/3 bag of mixed veggies because that was all I had. It still turned out wonderful. I think using 2 cans of cream of chicken would be better than what I did. Love the quick convenience of the recipe!

I really liked this recipe. but I agree, no to the garlic salt, yes to garlic.  And also NO PEPPER.  That was WAY too much pepper.  Otherwise this was a good recipe.  I added red onion to mine and added a can of Cream of Onion.  Gave it a great flavor.

I would give this recipe 3.5 stars done the way stated. I made a few small changes and it turned out awesome! I thought it had way too many potatoes so I halved it and used 1 can of chicken broth instead of bouillon. I did cream of chicken with herb and next time I think I will add in an extra half can of it because I thought it needed a little more also used less on the garlic salt and pepper. Served it over Pillsbury biscuits and it was great!

Really easy - quite tasty. However, I think the 1 tablespoon of black pepper should read 1 tsp or pepper to taste. It is wayyyy to peppery...almost inedible. 

Only changes I made is I did add some fresh garlic in addition to the garlic salt and used chicken broth base instead of boullion cubes. (Sensitive to MSG and the amount in the cream of chicken would be enough for me). And made a roux to thicken it a tad more.

Basically the recipes was great.
Creamy, tasty, great comfort food.
I made a few small changes. Eliminated the baby carrots as the mixed veggies already had them in the mix and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. 
One other change I will implement next time is to cut back to maybe 8 potatoes as the 10 called for in the recipe was too much, and, I would cut them to smaller chunks to make them more spoon friendly.
Other than that, it was an enjoyable dish that was well received.

I always make the recipe as is and then decide if it is a keeper, as is or change it. This one was Ok, It tasted good but not great. I might make it again when I need a quick recipe, but if I did would not use the garlic salt, celery salt and the bouillon. It was ridiculously salty. I would use garlic power,celery seed and perhaps a low salt chicken base.

I made the mistake of adding 10 oz of water (mixed with consomme so it was basically broth) and it ended up WAY too watery (I prefer a creamier base). I think they key to this recipe is to season to YOUR taste. I am highly sensitive to the taste salt so I never used celery or garlic salt in general let alone in a recipe that calls for canned soups.

My changes: 4 (10.5 oz) reduced sodium cream of mushroom soup, 1# potatoes, 2# carrots, 2 ears of corn, 1 onion, 1/2 bag frozen peas, 1/2 bag frozen green beans, dried parsley & herbs de provenance. And I used 3 huge chicken breasts and insane amounts of fresh cracked pepper. It was ready after 6 hours on low.

My husband hasn't had this yet but he's going to love it (this is total comfort food!) and I will definitely make it again.

This was amazing!!  I cut up biscuits and put them in the crock pot about 30 minutes before it was done.  The only thing I would do differently is cut up the baby carrots or used sliced carrots.  Highly recommend!

We didn't add all the potatoes cause there wouldn't have been room in my slow cooker. This was a nice warm comfort food type meal.

Very watery, but good.  Miss the crust that u get in usual pot pie.  I think next time I will pour it into grands biscuits and put them in the oven to brown.  6 cubes of bouillon was wayyyy to much. I used 2 packets of lower sodium bouillon powder.  I may use less soup next time.

Definately need to add extra seasoning.  I don't know if I would make it again as there are other slow cooker meals that are just as easy but much tastier.

I agree with others that there are a 100 different ways to make this just a little bit different.  But it is a great base recipes.  I followed it except for using the bouillon, celery salt and garlic salt.  I did not feel it was too salty.  Of course the Men's life group that I fed with it loved it and ate every last bit they had on their plates and came back for 2nds and 3rds.  Try it but make it your own.

It wasn't bad- that's all I can say really. My husband ate it, but flat out said he didn't like it, and my daughter felt the same.  I didn't think it was bad, but it wasn't what I was hoping.  The consistancy was more soupy than a pot pie filling, and the biscuits didn't do the trick when it came to replacing the pot pie crust.  I froze the left overs, and I might try to put it in an actual pie crust next time and add some flour to the mix to thicken it up a bit. BTW, I did follow the recipe as written.

I changed a few things up, mainly because I didn't have a couple of ingredients handy.  However, the one thing I didn't change was the amount of black pepper, and it needed to be changed.  Very hot and "peppery."  I will definitely cut the pepper next time.

This was ok. I think it needs more seasoning personally. I did leave out the bouillon per some suggestions but I added back in some salt.  It was just ok though.

Quite good.  Per other reviews, I only put in 1 tsp pepper, 2 bouillon cubes, and replaced garlic salt with garlic powder.  I also used cream of chicken with herbs soup.  Might add some other spices next time, but even hubby was happy with this.  Definitely more diet friendly that a real pot pie.  Thanks!

I'm not huge into chicken pot pie so I wasn't expecting to like this as much as I did.  It was really easy and quite tasty.  I did change a few things.  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of the breasts.  I also massively reduced the salt content cuz good lord it called for a lot of salt.  I only used 2 boullion cubes and I substituted 1 1/4 tsp. of garlic powder for the garlic salt.  I also only used 1 1/2 tsp. of pepper.  I love pepper and I did end up adding more to it so I will probably use 2 tsp. of pepper next time.  All in all, it was really good.

This was good, but not great.  Even only adding 1 1/2 tsp of pepper, it was pretty strong.  Also doesn't need any added salt.  The chicken was extremely moist.  I served over biscuits.

The first time I made it I didn't use any bouillon and it was a little blan..the second time I used only 1 and it was perfect!  I also used the 97% Fat Free cream of chicken and no one noticed the difference..very tasty!

This is one of the only recipes I've ever made that my boyfriend will ask for over and over again.  The first time I made it I screwed up and didn't put in enough soup, but it still turned out great.  Every time after that I've followed the recipe exactly and it's been perfect.  Thanks for an easy weeknight meal!

I loved this recipe!  I cut this recipe in half since there is only two of us.  I did reduce the boullion cube to only 1 and used garlic powder instead of salt.  I also used peas instead of the mixed veges.  Everyone I gave this receipe loved it, too!

I made this for a friend who is due to deliver her first baby this week, and my family and I tried it before giving it away - you know, quality control.  :)  After reading the reviews, I reduced the salt and pepper called for in the recipe and am glad I did so.  I also only used one extra large bouillon cube for a half batch of the recipe.  I can't imagine how salty the recipe would be with three!  It turned out really well - to make it a five star recipe, I would recommend adding chopped onion, and maybe increasing the proportion of chicken just a little.  This will definitely be a repeat recipe when we need a little comfort food!  Prep and cleanup were super easy and fast - a huge bonus for our busy family...

You need to add chicken broth to cover the chicken and veggies- you can also use poultry seasoning (1 tbs) instead of the boullion.  One hour before your cooking time is done (8-9 hours on low) shred the chicken and add a cut up can of biscuits.  Cook one more hour and you have a lovely chicken and dumpling stew!!

Finally a recipe for a crowd.  I made this for the first time yesterday for a Bible study group.  It filled my large crock pot.  Everyone loved it!  I'm a dark meat girl and a penny pincher, so I used three leg quarters instead of breasts.  I removed all the skin and fat and cooked them in there whole.  I took them out, let them cool and removed the bones, and cut up the meat.  I put it back in when I added the mixed veggies.  Oh, and I just used regular potatoes that I peeled and cubed.  Great recipe.  I'll make it again.

So quick and easy and melt in your mouth good.  The best thing to make when you have 5 minutes to throw a bunch of stuff in the slow cooker.  Big thumbs up!

sooooo goooooood. The only thing I changed was adding 4 tbs of flour & 4 tbls butter to make thicker. I also used low sodium cream of chicken. My son and husband loved it! Its a great way to get all your veggies in. Great served with a little tabasco.

I made this last Sunday for dinner and I have to tell you that we couldn't wait to enjoy it while it was cooking.  The aroma was unbelievable.  It made quite a few servings and this fed 6 adults and I was lucky to have leftovers the next day.  I have never put raw meat in my crock pot before, (always have browned the meat in a frypan first) but the chicken was moist and just perfect.  I will definitely make again but next time I would reduce the amount of pepper from 1 tbs. to 1 tsp. I found it a little too hot peppery, but still excellent.    Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

I think a tablespoon of pepper was too much, although my hubby thought it was just right.

This was easy to put together and my family liked it. I served it over puff pastry shells, accompanied by a salad. There was not as much liquid as in a regular pot pie, so next time I may add another can of soup. Thanks!

This was decent. I liked it and my family liked it even more than I did. It was definately easy to throw together and the chicken was very tender. I did make some adjustments. Iused  four bouillion cubes and omitted the celery salt. I also used fresh garlic instead of garlic salt and used only a tsp of black pepper.  I think without those adjustments it would have been extremely salty and peppery. I served it with biscuits as others suggested. Easy week day meal.

Delish!!!!! I used two regular size cream soups, 1 chicken, and 1 celery instead of the 26 oz. can of cream of chix soup.  I also added about a half cup of frozen corn to the recipe for additional color.  The celery salt I exchanged for garlic powder because I wanted taste but didn't want the additional salt. I will make this again!

This was wonderful and easy. I used a can of cream of celrey and cream of chicken as others had suggested. I used the amount of pepper suggested but it was a bit too much. We like pepper but I will cut it in half next time. My older kids don't like stew/soup. I made them try this and they were willing to eat it. This is a first!! My toddler loved it even with all the pepper. This is a keeper.

This recipe is fantastic.  I followed others advice and cut out the salt, using garlic powder and onion powder.  I cut the recipe in half, but still used 3-10.5 oz cans of soup.  The only other substitution I made was to use 1/4 of a turkey breast that I made yesterday using the slow cooker turkey breast recipe from this site.  Served over biscuits it is an excellent meal and so good on this cold winter day.

Was so easy and tasted good too! I actually used frozen chicken breasts, like the kind that come in a bag already frozen and just threw it all in the crock pot. When it was almost done I chopped up the chicken in big peices. Ate it over biscuits. Very good!

This recipe was pretty good. I made a couple minor alterations. I eliminated the boullion to reduce the amount of MSG in the recipe and pressed two cloves of fresh garlic rather than using the garlic salt. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. Next time, I will cut the amount of celery salt in half and plan more time for cooking. It needed an extra hour of cooking time for the potatoes to be done, and I diced them smaller than was suggested. I also served this over homemade, buttermilk whole wheat biscuits. It was delicious together! I would recommend this on days when you have time to do a lot of kitchen prep early in the day as it took quite a while to dice the chicken and peel and dice the potatoes as well. It also makes a lot!!! This will easily feed my family of 4 twice this week. It's a great recipe for a busy week!

I made this twice now. Easy delicious meal. ...Omit celery salt and chicken bouillon. Season the breasts with chicken seasoning.
This recipe as it stands is salty to the extreme.

Super tasty when making several tweaks suggested by other reviews!  Here's all the changes I made and it turned out great:
- Didn't use fresh celery and baby carrots (accounted for these in the frozen veggies).
- Didn't use celery salt.
- Reduced potatoes to 5 (cubed instead of quartered).
- Reduced pepper to 1/2 tsp.
- Replaced garlic salt with garlic powder.
- Added a generous sprinkle of Mrs. Dash original blend for extra flavor.
- Replaced chicken bouillon cubes with a can of reduced sodium chicken broth.
- Used two 22.6oz and one 10.5 oz can of condensed cream of chicken (recipe calls for two 26oz cans but my grocery store didn't have them in that size.)
- Used two 12 oz bags of frozen veggies - one with a mix of diced celery, carrot, and onion, the other with a mix of carrots, green beans, pea, and corn.

With those ingredient swaps, I otherwise prepared as suggested.  5 hours on high for the main ingredients then another hour on high after the frozen veggies were added.  Served with grands biscuits.  Very flavorful and will definitely make this again!

This is a good base for a slow cooker chicken stew, but you really don't need bouillon, and I would add some herbs. I omit the celery salt as well, use frozen peas vs mixed veggies, throw in some chopped up onion, and add ground sage and some fresh thyme.

Like many reviews stated, just cut back on all the salt.  I used 6 chicken breasts, 8 potatoes, 1 bag of baby carrots, 1/2 diced onion, 2 cans each of cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soups, 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth, 1 t. garlic powder and 1/2 t. pepper.  NO BOUILLION CUBES  I added the bag of frozen vegetables for the last 2 hours but next time I think I won't.  The potatoes and carrots would be enough.  (not sure about the corn in the mixed vegetable) Oh...and even after 6 hours the diced potatoes were still rather firm.  I added 1/2 c. flour with water the last 15 minutes to thicken.  To serve:  pour the chicken mixture into a bowl or plate and TOP with a cooked buttermilk biscuit.  I may consider even putting the cooked mixture into a cast iron pan and topping it with uncooked refrigerated pie crust...an popping it into the oven for 15 minutes or until the crust is baked.    This made A LOT...maybe 10-12+ servings.

Pretty good. Easy and well-received. NO MORE than 1 tsp black pepper, not 1 TBSP. I think it's a typo. No bouillon; one can each of creams of celery, chicken, and potato +1 can full of broth. Used fresh celery and baby carrots (cut in half) half of an onion (because I had it in the fridge) 2 cloves minced garlic and frozen peas and corn. Maybe 1/4tsp cayenne; none of the salts. Even with 1/4-ish cup of flour for the last 30 minutes, I wished it was thicker. I don't regret it and I'll probably do it again.

I substituted a can of cream of mushroom for one of the chicken.  Next time I'll cut back on the black pepper, as the recipe was a little too peppery for me.  Otherwise, I really enjoyed the dish and look forward to serving it to the crew this winter.

The video showed one bouillon cube, the recipe says use  6, I'm assuming that is incorrect?
I would use garlic powder instead of garlic salt and maybe a cup of low sodium chicken broth instead of the bouillon cube.

Excellent! And, I must say that I have never really been a "fan" of chicken pot pie however my husband is and since it's cold and snowing outside I figured this would be the perfect day to fire up the crock pot for some good old-fashioned "comfort food". Like others, I used what I had on hand - basically eyeballed everything and cut back on the salt . I used two large chicken breasts, no potatoes, a handful of baby carrots, minced  garlic vs. garlic salt, celery seed vs. celery, 1/2 tsp. black pepper, a couple of bouillon cubes, some low sodium chicken broth, a little milk , a little white wine along with the canned soup and frozen mixed veggies. The smell was nothing short of awesome and to thicken it up a bit at the end I just left the top off the crock pot for an hour. I served this over PA Dutch pot pie noodles and YUM - creamy and very filling! This definitely warms you up on a cold winter evening!

It's just two of us so I halved the ingredients. Other changes I made were: chicken thighs rather than chicken breasts as that's the meat I had, the thighs turned out great & I recommend that, if you're looking for a good crockpot chicken thigh recipe, the thighs were tender & moist & shredded just like pot pie meat. Also didn't use the large amount of pepper suggested, and also didn't use any chicken boullion as I don't have any. I put a package of dry Italian salad dressing in & it gave good flavor. Not bland at all, so I recommend that if you feel it's too bland. Served it with microwave steamed broccoli & baked pillsbury grands buns as side dishes, nice to dip the buns into the stew.

I like to try recipes the first time exactly as written but with all the other reviews about the salt, I made a couple small changes. I used 1 tsp. of Better than Bouillon  instead of the cubes and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. And cut up organic carrots in 1/2" pieces, because they tend to be sweeter than the bagged baby carrots. I wouldn't recommend leaving out the potatoes because I feel that helps keep the saltiness down.  I tasted it midway and it was too salty but when fully done the potatoes absorbed some it was perfect!  Nice hearty meal for winter. Hope this review helps!

I made vegetarian by putting in cubed tofu instead of chicken and cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken and veggie broth -it was a hit!

This is really good, but, like others, I tweaked it. I didn't use canned soup, but used my homemade chicken broth and then added about 1/2 cup cream. Also, didn't use bouillon, but had to add salt. I used garlic powder and fresh celery leaves, then added some chives and chopped onions. I also used white sweet potatoes which gave it a touch of sweetness, but really not noticable. It turned out really well. We ate it on top of rice noodles. Yummy!!

I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and celery seed instead of celery salt.  The only change I would suggest otherwise is to cut way back on the black pepper, maybe only use 1 teaspoon.  It was too much for my tastes. Other than being too peppery, it was fabulous!  We love it and will definitely have it again!-Liza

My family really liked this recipe.  The only thing I changed was adding chicken stock, because I did not have the bouillon.  I had some frozen veggies in the freezer (I think Italian mix) and used those.  This is a definite keeper.

Good if you don't add the bouillon, which made it too salty. 

Also, it needed more flavor besides chicken soup. I would make this again more like chicken a la king: some chopped green pepper and a can of mushrooms.

I made this recipe for a picky husband and two year old and it went over well.  I have a salty palate so this dish did not taste overly salty to me.  I did not have enough cream of chicken soup so instead used one can of cream of chicken and two cans of cream of celery soup and it tasted wonderful.  Also, I served over crescent rolls and it was wonderful.  Will make again!

This is a delicious, easy meal! I was only cooking for myself so I cut it in half. I'm not a big salt user so I used 2 no sodium bouillon packets mixed with 2 cups boiling water and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and it was salty enough for me without being overpowering. It's nice and creamy. Definitely a meal I'll make over and over during the cold winter.

This was outstanding..however way too salty.  I did not use the celery salt or the bullion and it was still too salty.  I cut it with some sugar and really took the saltiness away.   Next time I will only use garlic powder.. I also substituted one 26 oz can of cream of chicken soup and used three 10oz cans of campbells healthy request cream of chicken and one cream of celery. this was the best stew ever! making it again this weekend!

This is delicious over Pepperidge Farm pastry pufffs and gives it an elegant look.  I also add a bit of margarine to the vegetables to give it a bit more flavor and use chicken stock instead of the bouillion cubes...not so salty.

I cut the salt out.  Used only 1 tsp pepper like other reviewers.  The flavor turned out fine.  I ended up cooking it all day on low.  The meat was perfect but the potatoes and carrots were still really firm.  Next time would layer veggies on bottom, next chicken and cover all with soup and seasonings.  Also, this was more like broth than creamy.  Didn't have time to thicken it up.  Only three stars for the adjustments needed.

Disappointing. WAY too salty. Bad enough that we had to toss leftovers. There does seem to be something tasty under all that salt, though. Might try again and halve the amount of garlic salt, celery salt and (probably the most important) only add one or two chicken bouillon.

I'm giving 4 stars because I did use the reviews to change this recipe. I used minced garlic and some powder instead of garlic salt and used a pinch of celery seed instead of the celery salt. I shook in pepper to taste- nowhere near 1 tablespoon and I only used 1 big bouillon cube. I added some chopped onion that I had frozen. I used regular potatoes because I didn't have the red. Since I used a lot of fresh carrots I only added frozen corn and peas a couple hours before it was done. It was delicious!  I honestly did add some salt at the end when I tasted it, but I'd rather have to add salt than be stuck with something too salty. I know what I did is not this recipe, but that's why I love reviews! My way was really good and I will make it again.

This was great for everyone. My husband usually doesn't like stews or soups but he loved this. I did add just a bit more pepper and I added some milk (just a 1/2 cup or so) to make it a bit less thick. I cooked on low for 8 hours and it turned out great.

We made this more like a real pot pie by putting it in the oven for the last 12 minutes with Pillbury Cresent Roll laid over top. (transferred part of it to a large pie plate, added the unrolled Cresent Roll on top) The cresent roll made a flakey crust on top.  We cut back on the bullion cubes, using just 4 and will cut back more next time we make this.  It was a winner and will be repeated in our house!

So far, all I can really say is I made this recipe totally backwards. My chicken was still thawing, but I know how my slow cooker is so I started it heating to temp. In doing so, being my first time making this, I threw in my fresh veggies since I wrote down add all but frozen veggies. Lol. So, I thought 5 hrs on high with fresh veggies would all turn to mush, so I partially cooked my 3 medium red potatoes into bite sized pieces and boiled in salted water (abt 6 mins), cooled then coated with mrs. Dash original,  pepper and a little salt. I also cubed the chicken and put it in the oven for 10 mins, with salt/pepper sprinkled over it, which is fine by me to get those juices out first. Otherwise I always think blood seeping out into the stew. I didn't have any chicken broth on hand, but the condensed did look pretty thick, so I drained the broth from a can of chicken noodle soup. I used real garlic and cut up an onion in large chunks. I used fresh baby carrots, minced garlic and chopped celery. No bullion cubes. I didn't go wild with the recipe,  just made a few changes based on reviews and made more work for myself by making things out of order. Lol. I now have it on low for the next 2 - 3 hours to finish the potatoes, carrots and chicken. It already looks and smells delicious though. :-)

It was WAY too salty. I would use garlic powder instead and use fewer bouillon. I think with those changes it would be a 5 star recipe.

I made this yesterday for my family. I omitted the potatoes as I was serving it over buttermilk biscuits. I also omitted the bouillon and used healthy request soup instead because of all the sodium. I will make this again, but I will significantly reduce the amount of black pepper used. It was way too peppery for all of us. This would be wonderful on a cold evening.

I think this is a good idea for a slow cooker meal. It's easily modified to your liking. The cream of chicken adds a lot of salt, so I reduce the number of bouillon cubes to two. Changes I make: garlic powder (not salt); 1 cup diced onion; 1 teaspoon thyme; add only frozen peas, right at the end.

Excellent. I went lighter on the salt by using low sodium soup and less  bullion that called for. I added a bit of garlic and some sage. I served it with biscuits. Family loved it.

The recipe as stated is a salt-bomb. That said, I think there's hope for this one. I may try this again (once I forget how awful it came out this time). I would at LEAST halve the garlic and celery salt, and probably only ONE cube of bullion. I also really didn't get the "pot pie" part. It's just chicken vegetable stew without some sort of bread. I'd serve this over biscuits.

Definitely too salty!  I might try it again with some of the other suggestions about low sodium bouillons, but it definitely needs some modifications.

I followed the recipe exactly so I would know what/if I would change next time. This recipe ends up yielding quite a a lot of stew which almost over topped my crock pot. Also, with all the vegetables I felt it needed more chicken. Next time I will half the recipe and add more chicken but otherwise delicious.

Really good, but the recipe calls for way too much pepper. I recommend halting the pepper or even less, and just adding more for flavor at the end.

as others have said only 1 cube of chicken bouillon and only 1/2 tsp of ground pepper.  Also add 1 tsp of onion powder and use 3 clove of minced garlic instead of garlic salt...also i use skinless/boneless chicken tights

Omitted the celery salt, garlic salt and chicken bouillon.  Added basil, garlic and chicken broth.  Used one can regular cream of chicken soup and one health request cream of chicken soup.  Put this over biscuits.  Delicious!

I made this for supper tonight. My family and I were very excited to try this dish. Next time I make it I will cut way back on the pepper. The pepper was burning up our mouths so we didn't eat it. Other then that it was easy to prepare and I will make this again

Loved the idea, and put twists of my own.  2 cans heart healthy campbell's cream of chicken 10 oz., 1 tsp celery salt, 1 can low sodium chicken broth, 1/2 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp garlic powder, dash of pepper.  5 hours on high, frozen chicken and everything but froz mix veg, then added veg and 1.5 more hours on low.  Mmmmm!  And so easy!

My 4yr old niece and I made his together. She is a very picky eater. The entire family absolutely loved it. I did not use mixed veggies...instead i used a can of corn and a large onion and green pepper. I also only used 3 potatoes and i did not use the bouillon. I figured it would be salty enough... and it was. I also used 1 cup of low sodium chicken broth... this made it very creamy.

Made this recipe yesterday.  It was wayyyy too salty (& I only had the garlic salt to add)and definitely too much pepper.  Not sure I would risk making this again by eliminating these ingredients.  Very disappointed!

We love this recipe. I have only made it with the helpful hints from Chef Joy. It's easy and so good. Love to make it before I go to work. We have a wonderful dinner at night! I do make the biscuits and potatoes because my family likes both! Try it, you won't be disappointed.

We didn't like this, way too much chicken bullion and it was too salty. I'd omit the baby carrots if there are already carrots in the frozen veggies. On the plus side, it was very easy to prepare.

Pretty good but too much salt.  I usually make a recipe for the first time exactly as directed, but I saw lots of comments about too much salt.  I only used 2 boullion cubes, a little garlic POWDER, and a touch of celery salt.  Also cut down on the pepper.  This was really good served over Grand biscuits.

This is really delicious and easy to make. However, one tablespoon of pepper is really too much!  Even my hubby, who loves spicy, agreed that this was too peppery.  So next time I make it, I will decrease the amount of pepper. Esther P.

Absolute best recipe!! My son's favorite. Right on the money! Put this over buttermilk biscuits and you're in heaven!! You cannot go wrong. The only change is you should cook it on high for 8 hours.

This was a HOME RUN with my family! I chose to use boneless skinless organic chicken thighs instead of the breast as I think the thighs have more flavor. I did use less bouillon - I added a few garlic cloves, fresh dill and kosher salt. This recipe is a must try... I will be making this again and again!

I made this recipe the other day and I found it could be an excellent recipe however, the tablespoon of black pepper was way too much. It made it absolutely horrible to eat. I will make it again but with about 1/8th tsp of pepper and will add a little onion.  I will also cut the recipe by half.  It makes just too much.  I used the healthy choice Campbells soup as its less sodium.

Delicious.  Added some garlic, upped the pepper a touch.  Used 1.5lbs chicken breast and about that of red potatoes for a good mix.

My family enjoyed this recipe once the garlic salt, celery salt and chicken bouillon cubes were replaced with Tony's seasoning, 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of poultry seasoning, minced garlic, chopped onions/parsley and 1 cup of low sodium chicken broth.  This one is a keeper!

I like everyone else made some changes, but it turned out good. I did not add any of the 'salts', I used sodium free bouillon, added minced garlic and an extra can of cream of chicken soup. I also added some chopped onion. Also, I did't have any carrots, so I have canned and I will add them before serving.

So it is delicious but I tweaked it quite a bit.  I did NOT use that many potatoes and it was still too many potatoes.  6 cubes?  Insane.  I used ONE.  I also didn't add celery but other than that, I followed it completely.  Oh, I love garlic but it was too powerful in this recipe so next time I will cut it back a smidge.

First, too salty. Second, you don't need to cook it on high for 6 hrs. It seared and scorched the bottom of the food in the crock pot. Low for 6 hrs would have been better. Third, it makes a humongous crock pot of food. If you are feeding an army, there would still be left overs! The amount is unreasonable for a family. Even halving the recipe would probably be too much.

Loved this!  Super Easy and quick to get together.  Did reduce the boullion cubes to two and added a little chicken broth.  Substituted the garlic salt with fresh minced garlic.  Will definently make this again.

I put NO bullion cubes, no garlic salt, and reduced the celery salt to 1/2 tsp and this did NOT need more salt.  I reduced the pepper to 1/2 tsp. and added minced garlic to replace the garlic salt that I left out.  We thought this was tasty and I will make it again!

This was exactly what I was looking for after having something similar at Panera.  I omitted all the potatos (because I don't like them) and doubled the other vegetables.  I halved the garlic salt and the pepper as other reviewers suggested.

A decent recipe that makes a HUGE pot of stew. However, 1 tablespoon of pepper is WAY too much. Next time, I'm cutting it to 1 teaspoon. Also, I agree with many others that the bouillon cubes can be cut at least in half. I also suggest using low sodium cubes.

I had to change a lot of it because it was so salty. I took out the bullion and added a can of broth, and didn't add any salt. The mixed veggie I used had carrots, so i left out the baby carrots. It was really good. After I changed it.

I'm not a cook so I have been looking for recipes that are quick and easy.   I have a picky family too... this dish was a hit!!!  The whole family loves it so when my brother in law and his family stayed to visit, I made this dish for them.  They absolutely loved it too.

What a bizarre amount of pepper! I saw that the recipe called for WAY too much salt, and cut back on that. But for some reason I didn't notice how very much pepper it wants. And it ended up tasting good, except for all that pepper! Next time I'll put maybe a teaspoon in, at most.

Very salty! I added a couple dashes of garlic seasoning, but didn't add any salt. However the 6 boullion cubes added plenty of salt on their own! Even my husband who loves salty dishes found this salty....can't imagine what it would be like if I had added the salt too. Will make again though because despite the saltiness it was a good easy recipe; next time I will follow other reviewers advice to reduce the salt further.

Everyone in my family loved it!  Go easy on the black pepper though.  1 T is too much.  Did not use the chicken bullion.  Added some extra garlic and onion flakes.  Used about a cup of vegetable stock in the crock-pot and then thickened up the gravy after.  Went on low for about 9 hours.  I cooked the frozen veges first and then just added them.  Served over buttermilk biscuits.

Unfortunately I did NOT read the reviews and made the recipe as is. As the others said, too much pepper, and to many buillon cubes. My husband said it was good otherwise. Will make it again in a month and make it MY WAY LOL

This was great considering I decided to make it at the last minute and had all the ingredients that I needed on hand.  My changes where 1) Only used 1 -2 bouillon cubes 2) Used fresh garlic 3) Cooked for 10 hours on low, put frozen veggies in for last 1.5 hours.  4) Used only 1 t pepper 5) Added one fresh onion.  Would make again, my 2 year old daughter enjoyed it.

Agree with others that this was way too salty and the bouillon cubes lent an artificial flavor that wasn't necessary.  I skipped the bouillon entirely but seasoned the chicken chunks with salt and pepper prior to cooking.  Also substituted bag of frozen pearl onions for the frozen mixed vegetables and added a splash or two of dry sherry.  Maybe a different dish in the end, but closer to 5 stars for my taste.

I really liked this. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that there was WAY too much pepper in it for us....two of my children couldn't even eat it.  I added some cornstarch to it towards the end to thicken it up a bit.  Otherwise it was great and I will definitely make it again (just with less pepper next time!).

This is a nice hearty meal.  I agree it would have been way too salty with the bouillon.  I left that out and instead added a can of low sodium chicken broth.  I used 1 tsp of garlic salt and 1 tsp garlic powder and then used celery seed rather than celery salt.  I also omitted the carrots since they are in the frozen mixed veggies, and only used 1 tsp of pepper.  Lastly, I only used 10.5 oz cans of cream of chicken soup.  With the broth too it was plenty of liquid.  We served over biscuits and it was very nice.

Wow, we enjoyed this! It was better than I expected.  One of the cans of soup was 98% Fat free cream of chicken.  I cut it down to 1 Chn bullion, I think maybe 2 would have been fine since I used minced garlic and no celery salt.   I added peas instead of mixed veggies. They went in at the last hour.  I had already used a full bag of carrots and 3 stalks of celery and light on the potatoes.  I also used already cooked herb roasted chicken since I had leftovers.  I added that the last hour too.  I served over crescent rolls since that's what I had.  Yum, will make again!  Perfect on a fall day.

I didn't add the frozen veggies. I think the 2 tsps of garlic salt was a bit too much and next time I will probably only add some minced garlic instead. Very easy and good though and the kids ate it all up. I served over J.P.'s Big Daddy Biscuits from this site.

I cook dinner at Ronald McDonald House once a month, and this was a big hit, especially with the kids. I left out the boullion and added some Trader Joe's 21 spice mix and garlic powder. I didn't measure, just sprinkled it over the chicken. For the veggies I used frozen pea and carrot mix. I'll definitely be making this again.

Meh. This was "OK." My fiance has been gone all wk.(returned 2nite). When we spoke yesterday, he jokingly asked what I was making for dinner when he returned. I knew I needed to find a something that could slow cook while I was at work. I came across this recipe some time ago & immediately thought of it. Ironically, when I mentioned this to my fiance, he said he saw one of his co-workers eating a "deconstructed" pot pie & has craved it ever since - easy decision! :-) Unfortunately, I can only give this 3 *'s. To be fair, I did ch. things quite a bit tho.... As written, this would have been WAAAY too salty, IMHO (and for that reason alone, it would STILL only merit 3 *'s). To speed prep, I purchased a bag of Ore-Ida steam n' mash cut red potatoes (found in the frozen foods section) & used frozen chx. breasts that I had in my freezer.  My only other ch. were to add a sm. (chopped) yellow onion & a 15.5 oz. can of creamed corn (trying to clean my pantry). I also sub. chicken seasoning blend (Patrick) for the bullion & spices called for & used frozen peas instead of mixed veggies (another item in my freezer). All in all, this was allright, but a little bland & too mushy for my liking (my potatoes were VERY soft). If you are going to give this a try, I suggest cooking on LOW, not high (I think this is the reason for my bowl of mush!). Served w/ heart-shaped pie crust cut-outs, this was a "cute" meal. At least my fiance got a kick out of that!!! Thx. anyways! :-)

This was a wonderful meal to make in advance and forget about. I did add some of my garden herbs like thyme, rosemary and a bay leaf which I really felt added to it. If you want to go to work and come back to it just leave it on low and come home to yummyness. I made whole wheat biscuits for a healthier take on a filling dish. My boyfriend usually has to get seconds to get full but he got full of his first plate full!

I loved this, but I have to admit, I made a few changes, so I know the rating is not accurate.  I omitted the bouillon and used "better than bouillon" a condensed goop of sorts that I feel is better.  (used 2 teaspoons.  Other than that minor changes, such as omitted salts and used garlic powder instead and 1 teaspoon of black pepper instead of 1 Tablespoon.  Cooked on LOW for 9 hours.  YUM! Served over biscuits and made a ton of food!

This was delicious! It will surely be our new chicken soup replacement!! I used 1 jar of gravy, 1 can cream of celery soup, 1 can whole white potatoes undrained, 1 can peas drained, 1 can corn drained, 1 can mixed veggies drained...seasoned the chicken with garlic salt and calypso seaoning. I didn't use the boullion per other reviews. Served with drop biscuits and hot sauce! YUMM!

This was a great meal. My husband just kept repeating that this was the best recipe we've ever done for the slow cooker! I cut the recipe in half since there's only 2 of us, but would recommend adding a third chicken breast instead of just 2. I took suggestions from other reviews and only used 1 chicken bouillon cube and it still came out with great flavor and not too salty at all. I cooked it on low for 9 hours and the veggies were perfect - the carrots were not mushy at all. We spooned it over bisuits and had an amazing dinner.

I read the reviews and made the adjustments suggested such as decreasing the amount of pepper and salt, however it just did not taste or look good, my kids (who love chicken pot pies) would not eat it!

This recipe has potential, but I have to agree with other reviewers that the seasonings definitely need adjusting.   I'm a big fan of salt and pepper, but both were way too much in this recipe, and I only used 3 bouillon cubes instead of 6.   If I were to do this again, I would use no more than maybe a teaspoon and a half of black pepper, 3 bouillon cubes, 1 teaspoon of garlic salt and 1 teaspoon of celery salt.  I'd also probably put in a couple of bay leaves and some chopped fresh parsley.    I also found it took about 8 hours to cook.

I didn't add the bouillon, and it was plenty salty without it.  I also added a can of peas at the end of cooking.  It was a tasty stew.  I am sure I will be making this again.

I made this last week and it was fantastic! Based on the other reviews, I left out the bullion altogether and that was a wise choice. I used frozen peas instead of mixed veggies. Will definitely make again!

Highly recommended. Excellent comfort food on a snowy day. Also something great to share with friends or neighbors. Agree with the recommendation to cut the salt/ bullion. Recipe as is would be salt over kill. Would also recommend not cutting the chicken too small to prevent it from drying out. Ate as a soup with roles on the side. Yum!! Enjoy

Very tasty!  I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, didn't use celery salt, used 1 tsp of pepper, two cubes of chicken bouillon and added some poultry seasoning.  I took the advice of others about too much salt.  Thanks for sharing!

Too salty as written!! I even lessened the amounts of garlic and celery salt based on other reviews.  With some adaptations this has potential but as written I wouldn't make again.

Very good recipe, though, I altered it a bit. Condensed soup is salty enough, so i didn't bother adding salt. I used chicken tenderloin pieces since that's what I had. No celery, replaced that with corn. Included a bit of thyme. Served with the 'Kentucky Biscuits' found on this site.

Decent base, but it lacked something.  It was fairly bland.  I'll try again, and maybe this time actually put it into a chicken pot pie and see how that works out.

I am like many who loved this recipe, but changed it a little.  I used less bouillon and made my own cream of chicken base.  I also omitted the garlic and celery salt because the bouillon made it plenty favorful.  Really loved it!  Very comforting!  Thank you!

Terrible because I followed the recipe.  I wasn't paying attention and just added everything as it said. Served my family dinner and no one could eat it because it was extremely salty.  I should have paid attention but I was confident that it would be good because of the ratings. Very disappointed.

Sooooo good! I added garlic powder and used low-sodium organic chicken broth instead of bouillon, and used a can of light cream of mushroom and a can of low-sodium cream of chicken. Also, I used chicken thighs instead and added one slice of raw bacon to give it a mild smokey flavor.

This was spectacular!  For the chicken, after dicing, I seasoned it with a touch of olive oil, pepper, garlic powder, and coarse salt and added it to the crock pot with a large onion (chunk cut), the celery, and the carrots.  The meat/vegee mixture warmed while I put together the soup mixture in a bowl. Following reviewers' advise on the bouillon, I only used one tablespoon of "Better than Bouillon", and mixed that in the bowl with all the Cream of Chicken soup and added 1/2 carton of broth, Mrs. Dash Spicy Table Blends, celery seed, savory sage spice, crushed red pepper, and three bay leaves.  After adding the frozen mixed veggies near the end, I found the mixture too thin, so I mixed three tablespoons of corn starch with enough milk to mix, and stirred that into the stew.  In the end, it was perfect, and my family said it's the best thing I've ever made!

I used most of this recipe, dumped all ingredients in a slow cooker and set it to cook. Added the frozen bits towards the end. only changes were that we found a cream of mushroom and chicken soup can and used that for the canned soup. and my bullion is a paste. It was truly delicious and im certain it will be a staple for the cold months of the year!

Really quick and really easy. Great tasting! I toast some bread and add that to the bottom of the bowl and pour the pot pie over it. Gives it a great texture or a crust.

My family loved it. it seemed a little salty so I'd recommend using low salt soup and reducing the salt a bit.

it was delicious. I made a few changes like no potatoes or chicken bouillon in general. It was a very easy recipe to follow.

This was a disappointment.  It just came out bland.   It needs a good helping of Poultry Seasoning.  Even with the Chicken Broth and a couple of Chicken Bouillon Cubes, it just didn't do anything for me.  I'll try it again, but I can't  give this recipe any more than 3 stars.

I've tried this a few times... the recipe as is was way too salty for us, so I substituted garlic powder and celery seed for the salts, and used a salt-free home-made cream of chicken soup, and I think only did 2-3 bouillon cubes.... A family hit!

I made it for my family here in Colombia South America.  I had to substitute, but it was delicious.  I used 2 cups of diced carrots instead of a package of baby carrots.  I made 2 packs of Crema de Pollo soup, using just half of the liquid.  I dissolved one and a half chicken bouillon cubes in 1 1/2 cups of hot water.  Since I only had packs of frozen peas, I used one pack and one can of corn.  I made drop biscuits from scratch, using oil instead of shortening.  The second day it was a little dry, but we ate it with gusto.  I will make it again.

Delicious! Really liked this and will make again. I used none of the salt, and subbed garlic powder and celery seed. Also used half the amount of potatoes, quartered and then quartered again. I think next time I’ll add dried crushed rosemary at the start.

Meh. Very bland despite adding fresh garlic and a bunch of dried herbs. Halved the recipe so halved the time but chicken was still hard and dry despite gooey sauce.

My 1st time I made this I would have given it 5 stars.
But the last 2 times I've made it I have found it very salty. Recently I've had to alternate my diet and need to eliminate the potatoes and salt. I steamed potatoes separately to serve other family members.  I replaced the soup with low sodium  soup, replaced the garlic salt with minced garlic. But, I didn't have low sodium bouillon; it is difficult to find.
I'm going to continue to look for alternative ingredients.

So easy to make. I didn't use the amount of chicken bullion because I was afraid of it being too salty. This recipe can easily be adjusted for personal preference. I thickened mine as I like a heartier base.
I think I'd like to add spinach next time I try this

I modified the recipe just a bit; no buillion and only one large can of cream of chicken soup.. then filled the can with broth and dumped that in to make it a little less thick. A thinner stew was my intention as I served it over rice. Next time id season the chicken more, or differently, and probably shred it once cooked vs cube it raw. Otherwise this was fantastic and easy!

GOOD EASY We enjoyed . My SC does not need that much time. I used Cream of Celery soup and liked that with celery in stew. No bouillon, but I added chicken broth. Just added frozen peas and corn towards end. Needs more than basil I think.

I'm giving it 5 stars for @GourmetSoy's inspiration - and because my version was outstanding! ;) I heeded the salt warnings but did use 4 bullion cubes. I also subbed 1 of the cans of cream of chicken w/ cream of mushroom. And I threw in a can of sliced mushrooms, 2 quartered small yellow onions, and minced garlic instead of garlic salt. Because I'm eating low-carb/low-sugar, I decided to do without the potatoes. Oh yeah- I used 6 chicken thighs and that really made it. The meat fell off the bone. No biscuits in here, though, so it's more like a mega-hearty chicken soup than a pot pie thing.

Thank you, GourmetSoy. Please don't be offended that I made it my own. I couldn't have done it without you!

I made double quantity to feed my wife and myself and my daughters family of 6.I reduced the salt content, added thick sliced mushrooms and used a mix of chicken breasts and thighs.
Everyone said how rich and tasty it was.
I will certainly make this one again.

It was pretty good but a bit bland. I added the frozen veggies at the beginning simply out of convenience and it was too watery by the end.  I added cream of celery at the end and some more chili powder, salt, onion powder and garlic. Definitely more to our liking. I also recommend heating on low for 8 hours if you have the time.

Great Recipe, I love Chicken pot pie, but I'm off wheat/flour currently so this is a fantastic replacement, makes a ton too.  didn't sub anything, except I threw in an extra cup of peas, cause I like peas.

This was very easy and very yummy!!  It was a little spicy, so next time I think we will cut the pepper in 1/2.  Otherwise it was great, even kids liked it.  We served it over flaky, buttery buttermilk biscuits with a green salad on the side.  :-)

Was looking for an easy chicken breast based meal to cook during today's snow storm. Read some reviews first and omitted the bouillon, used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and only a little fresh black pepper. Also just put the breasts in whole as I don't like cutting raw chicken. Added some water as it seemed a little "dry" for a crock pot. Came out tasty and not too salty. Loved soaking up the broth with my Cheesecake Factory brown bread. Will definitely make this again!

Recipe was easy to prepare, but it was way too salty.  So much so my husband and I couldn’t eat it.  I was afraid this would be the case as I was adding the garlic salt, celery salt and then the boullion cubes  but I don’t like to deviate from a recipe the first time I try it.

I haven't made it but looking at the reviews regarding the bouillon cubes being too salty, they need to use Better than Bouillon, it had 50 % less salt and adds a lot of flavor.

Easy to make but beware. Omit bouillon, pepper garlic salt and celery salt.  Used boned broth instead of bouillon and garlic powder. Salt and pepper to taste when ready.

OMG SO SALTY! I am not a great cook and I follow recipes as they are assuming they are correct, and this one definitely has something off. Maybe it's the bouillon? I didn't even have the celery salt and just the recipe alone was INSANELY salty.  I put just 5 of the cubes since 6 seemed like a lot, and I definitely could have done without any. OY VEY! It had so much potential to be great!!

The definition of comfort food!  I tweaked recipe also....used cream of celery soup and knorr chicken stock instead of celery and bullion cubes and only 6 small to med potatoes. Also cut black pepper in half.  Crock pot was full to brim!   Wonderful aroma and taste

Love this recipe.  I use Pillsbury extra thick biscuits as the base (we're biscuits and gravy people).  Go light on the pepper and tweak as needed.

Very easy and versatile. I only had two small cans of cream of chicken so I added one cream of celery and one cream of mushroom. I also added a can of corn and frozen peas as my vegetable. I didn’t have any biscuits so I took some crescent dinner rolls and lined a loaf pan with the dough. I poured the leftover filling in and added dough on top as well.

I generally followed the recipe but did it stovetop and used fresh vegetables (frozen peas only). It was flavorful but very salty. I would omit the garlic salt and use fresh instead and you could drop down to one billion cube.

We made this and I couldn't eat it. I was so disappointed!  One table spoon of pepper is way too much!  Next time, I will change that part. My husband is the only one who can eat it.  I am not sure how children could eat this with that much pepper in it.  Next time will be better, I hope!

Made as stated the first time-  and it was ok.  Since then I have added a teaspoon each of rosemary and thyme as well as fresh mushrooms and fresh garlic.  I did not add any of the 'salts'.  Yum!

YUM!! A family favorite! I have been making this for 3 years now. It’s so good, and so easy to make. The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because the 6 bullion cubes make it, too salty. I only make it once or twice a year and forget every time to use less. I’m not a chef by any means, but I think 4 would be plenty to keep an authentic pot pie flavor.

Very salty and way too much pepper for my taste.  I will make it again, but might change the garlic salt to garlic powder, and get low sodium chicken bullion cubes.  And definitely less pepper next time.

I made this in a pot, not a slow cooker (I was pressed for time). I did make the change of  1 can reduced sodium chicken broth and left out the potatoes. Cooked biscuits in the stew. Put raw biscuits on top of stew, baked in oven at 400 degrees without lid for 15 minutes and then baked  another 15 minutes with lid on. This is a great recipe, will definitely make again.

this is a great recipe, I didn't add the salts and used no salt bouillon. I still found it a bit salty from the cream of chicken.

Gave 4 stars because I also modified the recipe as written to make it good. I followed it as is the first time and it was just bleh, so I took some suggestions from other comments for round 2. This time the end result was extremely good and I will be making this pretty regularly as it was a huge hit at my house. Instead of breasts I used boneless skinless chicken thighs (package of 6), 1 cup chopped celery, 1 cup chopped carrots and about 5 diced russet potato, 2 cans cream of chicken, 1 can cream of mushroom. For seasonings I used 1 tbs chicken bouillon which I’m thinking may be the equivalent to about 2 cubes, 1 tbs garlic salt, 1 tbs minced onion then sea salt salt and crushed black pepper to taste. After 5 hours in the crock pot I shredded the chicken with a fork which basically fell apart anyway and put biscuits in the oven to serve it over. I highly recommend making this recipe your own way and if you want to follow it as written, good luck!

I left out the celery because I'm not a fan, and the baby carrots because my bag of mixed veggies already came with some. Additionally, I replaced the chicken bouillon with chicken broth, as others have suggested. In hindsight, I should've added more salt as I only realized afterwards that I used salt free broth and condensed soup. But that hasn't been problem at all, as I've just been adding some before serving. Great tasting dish with minimal effort!

The general idea of this recipe is AWESOME!  I made it for a campout for a few friends, and everyone loved it.  However, I changed the recipe according to the reviews I read, and after reading over the recipe (and making it), realized that there definitely would have been waaaaay too much salt.  I skipped the bouillon cubes and used one can of chicken broth instead (you will need liquid to go with the condensed soup...this amount made it more like a hearty stew which was perfect).  The frozen veggie mix ended up being enough, so I didn't use the carrots.  I used about half the chicken and potatoes called for (maybe their slow cooker is much bigger than mine?).  I used garlic powder and celery seed instead of the salts (it literally did not need salt added, and I'm a salt junkie).  I served it over homemade buttermilk biscuits and mm-mmmmm was it good!  Overall great recipe, but I'm wondering if they actually tested it before writing it?!

I probably won't make again because the chicken got really dried out. However, it made a lot. It fed my family of 4 for two meals.

I overall was very pleased with how it turned out. It honestly could use a little more flavor so i think ill add a little bit of chicken broth next time. But was still happy with how it tasted.

Thanks to other reviewers I cut down on the amount of chicken bullion cubes, and did not add any salt while cooking. My only real comment... I have a 6qt slow cooker, and there was no way I could fit all these ingredients in. I was only able to fit about 5 red potatoes, and still leave room for the mixed veggies. Perhaps the recipe meant those little small 2" red potatoes? But the final outcome was a rather tasty, and hearty filling dinner.

It has a good flavor, but I gave it 4 stars because with the stock ingredients it was too salty! I'd have to figure out what might work, but maybe replacing garlic salt with garlic powder?

Like the others I didn't add any salt.  I used 2 cans Cream if Chicken, 1 can Cream of Celery, 2 cans Chicken broth.  Following the recipe I then added a few potato flakes to thicken it up before serving over frozen Grand biscuits.  Very good and it received rave reviews!

This is a pretty decent base for a recipe, but only got 3 stars until I can make some changes. It was too salty and had too much pepper for our liking. I had even cut back on the amount of bouillon as suggested by others, and it was still too much. The chicken was nice and tender, and the veggies cooked well, no issue there. I used a can of cream of chicken and cream of mushroom, since that’s what I had on hand. Those items tend to be rather salty anyway, and since you aren’t watering them down, it’s a lot.

This recipe is a wonderful, easy base. I just wish I had paid closer attention to the other reviews and cut down in the black pepper more. I put in two teaspoons, 2/3 of what it calls for, and it was way too assertive. I felt so bad for my three year old who helped make it and was excited to eat it. He took a couple of mouth full before the pepper aftertaste started to kick in and he wouldn't touch it. Said it burned his tongue. I ended up having to add another can of cream of chicken and can of corn to try to counteract it. Now that I know, though, I will definitely make this again. Just hope I can get my kiddo to give it another try.

Definitely smelled like chicken pot pie, but the tastes was more of a[n] (awesome) chicken stew (but still not a pot pie flavor). Needed more of a couple things. Trust the comments!

This turned out great! I did follow the advice of other reviewers and reduced the number of bouillon cubes. And I used a big can cream of chicken, small can of cream of celery, and small can of chicken broth. I know I’m rating a changed recipe but I still think the starting point is great and then adjusting is more personal preference. Will definitely make again! Chicken was very tender.

This was ok. A good starting recipe for improvement. Main issue: Way too bland. I know CPP isn't a spicy meal, but this was cafeteria bland. However, it was good enough to make again, and this next time I will jazz it up. More peppers, maybe some Mrs. Dash, more herbs, etc. Also, will use fresh veggies for much of it--carrots, celery, grn beans, etc. No need for frozen.

Very tasty but cooking it on high for a total of 6 hours cooked a lot of the gravy away. I think 4 hours on high or 6 hours on low would have been sufficient.

No need to cube the chicken. I put the breasts in whole and remove and shred it when I add the mixed vegetables. I also do not add bouillon cubes.

I got second place in my office Souper Bowl competition with this soup! I did put in fresh garlic instead of garlic salt and it was still pretty salty so I might find a way to reduce that in the future. I also omitted the celery because I don’t care for celery. The great thing about this recipe is that it’s very adaptable and you can just throw in whatever vegetables you have on hand.

I may have used too big of potatoes because I had a good bit but otherwise it was very good.  We will make it again for sure.  I'm thinking more of 4.5 - some of us really liked it but 2 loved it!  So - it was good.

I'm pretty sure the black pepper measurement is a typo. I made the mistake of using the full tablespoon and it rendered the dish inedible. Use a tsp of pepper and only 3 bullion cubes and it is a nice dish.

Omg this is delicious! 

I tweaked it a bit after reading reviews.

 I made this today. I used 4 cut up boneless skinless chicken thighs unfrozen,
2 10.75 oz cans cream of chicken and one 10.75 oz can cream of mushroom, then one can of low sodium chicken broth, no water.

 I added a half a teaspoon of basil, thyme, and poultry seasoning and omitted the chicken bouillon cubes and no pepper.  I didn't do potatoes. 

 I added  two mixed bags of vegetables that I had for an hour and 30 minutes aftef the 5 hour mark. Then I did the sprinkle and stir of 1/4 cup of flour like another reviewer said to make it thick.  

I will make it again.

Very easy and delicious. Instead of bullion cubes, I used GFS chicken base in an equivalent amount.  Wonderful comfort meal served over fresh made basic biscuits.

Used only 2 cubes of bouillon and no salt. Only used 6 potatoes, and added in 3 cloves of garlic. Served with biscuits -
 tasted great!

Be sure to use the small Red Potatoes.  Makes a HUGE amount.  I think I would spice it up much more if I make it again.

Tastes just like pot pie! Excellent meal and leftovers are just as good the next day. Everyone in my family enjoys this recipe. The recipe makes a lot of food. My crockpot was nearly overflowing. Next time i make this i will invite some guests over for dinner....  or i could make less for my small family of 3.

love this recipe! HOWEVER 1 Tablespoon of pepper was way too much for our family. After that first time I started using 1 teaspoon and it's much, much better... even my pickiest eaters love it. I also use 1 teaspoon garlic powder instead of the garlic salt and regular sea salt in place of the celery salt.

Made it for the first time last week. Was very excited, but when I got home from work, all around the edges had burnt. thank goodness the middle was fine, and did not taste burnt. Next time I will definitely add a box of chicken stock instead of bouillon. It needs more thin liquid (other than the thick can soup). Will definitely make again.

It called for a tablespoon of black pepper way too much! I will make it again only using 1 tsp of pepper and see how it turns out. So after i added cheese to it to tame it down it was good .

I bought 2 normal sized cans of the soup not realizing it called for large. Luckily, I had 3 more at home (mushroom and celery). I used low sodium options on all that I could, the soups, used reduced sodium Better Than Bouillon; used minced dry garlic instead of garlic salt, celery seed instead of celery salt. I used 2 skinless breasts and 4 skinless thighs. It came out great and we will have it for the third time tonight. I would reduce the pepper next time. DH likes the peppery taste, I think it's a little strong. You can always add. It's a definite repeat.

Made this for an office potluck Halloween Party and everyone loved it.  I made it almost as written, but after reading the helpful reviews and other recipes, I did make a few suggested changes.  I used about 5 medium potatoes chopped and that was plenty. I sauteed in butter the celery, a chopped onion, and 2 cloves of minced garlic (with a pinch of salt).  Seasoned the chicken breasts with a seasoning salt and put them in the bottom of the crock pot whole.  Put the celery, onion, garlic mixture on top of that and added the chopped potatoes and carrots, and a bag of frozen peas.  Took 2 family size cans of cream of chicken soup, added about 3/4 - 1 cup of sour cream, and a small can of chicken stock and mixed it in a bowl.  I then added a tsp of Thyme, tsp of Oregano, tsp of black pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder and mixed that together and poured over the chicken and mixed just a little.  Cooked it on low overnight and during the night tasted it - ended up adding some salt, garlic salt, more pepper, and more thyme to taste - not a ton.  This morning I pulled the chicken breasts out and shredded them - put some gluten free thickening powder in the stew mixture to thicken, then added the chicken.  Served them with halved biscuits - it was EXCELLENT!  Love the addition of the thyme and oregano.  Will make again - besides the chopping, it was super easy!  (Did not use celery salt or any bouillon so that's why I used salt / garlic salt).

I wanted a chicken pot pie stew that tasted similar to one that I had at a chain steak resturant on the west coast. To this recipe, I substituted Better than Bouillon for the dry chicken bouillon brand (bouillon cubes are full of salt!) I added 1 can of reduced salt cream of celery and reduced the chopped celery to 1/3 cup since we’re not keen on the taste. I added a salt free seasoning brand to the chicken and added chopped garlic. Instead of biscuits, or noodles, when it was time to serve, I crumbled up baked pie crust pastry on top of this stew. Yummy! It was so good like the steak resturant’s version! Easy to prepare too!

We really enjoyed this and will be making again but like others I felt there was way too much salt in it. I used fresh garlic in place of the garlic salt . I served it over egg noodles per my daughters request next time I may try serving it over some sort of biscuit. Thanks for sharing!

The first negative comment i received was: is this canned food? Because it 100%? tastes like it was. A very big dissapointment really neither the taste nor the texture was appetizing and not to mention that I followed the recipe exactly as the video. No no definetly not a keeper, waste of money.

I made this recipe with a few modifications. First I cut down on the potatoes to five normal potatoes. I only put in two cubes of chicken bouillon, one can of chicken broth two cans cream of chicken, and one can cream of celery. I also suggest that you cook the chicken breasts whole and when their done then cut it up into cubes, otherwise it gets a little dried out.

Decreased the salt called for, and changed the veggies around a little, but it was delish.  Served with cornbread muffins.  Will definitely make again.

This was great but needed to cut WAY back on the salty ingredients. First of all, I used Campbell's healthy choice soup (for lower fat/sodium) rather than regular, and used a sodium free chicken boullion product rather than 6 cubes in the recipe. It also does not need garlic salt; garlic powder is sufficient. I can't even imagine the total grams of sodium per serving if this was made as posted. This was a hit with some small changes; we added turnips in place of some of the potatoes, mushrooms and extra peas since we like more veggies, and served it with biscuits and a salad.

I tweeted the recipie using 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth,  6 chicken breasts, 2  small cans of cream of chicken, 1 small can cream of mushroom soup,  a dash of celery seed, and one envelope of Lipton onion and  mushroom  gravy mix. I added frozen mixed vegetables 1/2 hour before serving. Spooned the mixture over biscuits. It was awesome. Chicken was super moist and the gravy was delicious.

Holy SALT, Batman! I followed the recipe exactly and while the consistency was excellent, it was too salty to eat. I plan on making another batch but eliminating all the bouillon and the 3 teaspoons of salt and mixing it into the super salty batch to see if it will even out. I'll substitute real garlic for the garlic salt, add more fresh celery instead of the celery salt and throw out the rest of the bouillon cubes. If that doesn't work, I'll have a lot of inedible stew on my hands.

This recipe is a good "how-to" base, but it needs some tweaking.    First and foremost, no bouillon.   Way too salty.  The veggies can be varied according to the tastes of your audience.  We kept the baby carrots, but no celery or mixed frozen veggies.  I always put a couple of small pats of butter on any lean meat in the slow cooker.....keeps it moist.   Then I added quartered small red potatoes, two 22.5 ounce cans of cream of chicken soup, and a packet of McCormack's country gravy mix.  I cooked it on low for five hours, added a can of peas and a can of corn, and grated in a little fresh pepper.  It was quite delicious over biscuits!

Delicous, but a little salty as written. I subbed jarred minced garlic  for the garlic salt, used about half the amount of celery salt it called for since there was fresh celery in it. I  left out the carrots, because there were diced ones in my bag of frozen veggies. 

I added 8oz sliced button mushrooms and a half a sweet onion, chopped. 

If I make this again, I'll sub a lower-fat, lower sodium cream soup base to make it healthier.

I cut back on the cream of chicken soup, going with three 10 oz cans and added 1 1/2 cups of heavy cream instead.  Also reduced the recipe to 1 Bullion cube and will reduce the amount of black pepper to 1/2 tsp or just a little more.  Will substitute home made biscuits next time too.

Aside from that, this is a great recipe as it is easy to prepare and was very well received and disappeared quickly.  Rich and flavorful, it is very satisfying.  I am adding to my recipe book.

Not bad, but with lots of tweaking. Deff dont use the cubes unless they are salt free.

This is a good base, but with lots of wiggle room for your imagination.

I made a few modifications and really enjoyed it. I used about 1 1/2 tsp. chicken bouillon, cut the amount of garlic salt in half, and substituted celery seed for celery salt. I also added 1 chopped onion, reduced the number of potatoes from 10 down to 4 medium sized ones, used an equivalent amount of chopped carrots instead of baby ones, and made 1.5 recipes worth of Cream of Chicken Soup From Scratch from this site,  to use in place of the 2 cans of soup. I was almost out of flour, so was unable to make buttermilk biscuits to serve with this as I originally planned, but this was great served by itself. I'll definitely make it again.

My family loved this recipe!! The only thing that I did differently was omitted the baby carrots because the bag of frozen mixed vegetables that I used had carrots in it already. I will definitely be making this again.

This was good but 1T pepper really is too much. So's the salt, but I automatically adjusted that. I used about 3/4T pepper...next time I think I'll use 1t. My guys enjoyed it (even with too much pepper).

Have made this several times.  My husband and I  like it a little more 'soupy' so added an additional can of cream of chicken.  Keep at least one container of it in the freezer.  It has become our 'go to' when neither of us feel like cooking.

This was a great base recipe, but I heavily modified it to make it less salty. Didn't use celery salt or chicken boullion, instead used low sodium chicken broth, some Mrs. Dash, and a splash of white wine.

I used 5 russet potatoes, less bullion, and no celery salt.  I used 2 regular of cans of cream of chicken, one of cream of celery and 1 can of water.    It was a big hit and I will make it again.  Thanks!

I wanted to love this - especially considering how much is in it and how much it makes.  And I willl try it again.  But take my word for it people - at least HALF the pepper! I use fresh ground, and didn't go with the full Tablespoon, and even then it was VERY peppery.  It was, as others have stated, very salty.  I didn't use bullioun cubes - I used "Better than Bullion" and even so it was very very salty.  I would suggest 1 or 2 cubes or cube equivalents at most - and WAY less pepper. You can always add more, but you can't take it out once it's in.  I added (after the fact) greek yogurt to try to cut it, and it worked a bit, but I'm kind of disappointed, and learned my lesson to read the comments before trying the recipe.  Had I seen the salt and pepper comments, I would have really scaled them back.  It's a lot of $ in ingredients to not be happy with it.  Again, I'll try again, but will definitely decrease the bullion and peppper.

Will make again. 
Only had 3 B.S. breasts  on hand 
6 med. russet potatoes, diced
3 carrots , diced
2 cans cream of chicken
1 bullion cube 
Breasts were only partially thawed, so I started on high for 3 hrs then switched to low for 3 more hrs.
1/2 hr before end time I added 1 can of peas & 1 can of corn
Also a sprinkle of garlic &  onion powder. 
When done it seemed a little thick. I would've put in 1 can of chicken broth if I had some but there was none to be had.
My wife had just arrived home from work so i asked her what she thought. She advised 1-1/2 cup of water and 1 more can of cream of chicken.
I thought it turned out great. Served over Pillsburry Grands buttermilk biscuits.  Wife thought it was good. Daughter said it was OK

We halved this recipe and it should still serve the two of us for three meals! We added kale and corn. We also added 3 cups chicken broth, but I will probably reduce it to 2 next time to make it a little thicker.  I made biscuits and put the stew over top. We did use the 3 bouillon cubes to make the chicken broth and I think it was too salty so next time I will try only adding 1 cube.

The only reason I gave this 3 stars was it was SALTY!  I've made this twice now, the first time according to the recipe. The second time my own version. The first batch we couldn't eat, it was just way to salty. The second time around I substituted fresh celery for the celery salt,  made a super simple Bechamel to use in place of the soup and tossed in 2 frozen cubes of my own reduced chicken stock (which are so easy to make I always have a variety of bags of reduced homemade stock ice cubes in my freezer now). i added garlic, basil, pepper and a couple bay leaves. Superb!

I make this all of the time. I love that the chicken can just go straight in the crock pot without having to cook it first. It fills you right up and has lots of vegetables. As other reviewers have noted, this doesn't need 6 bouillon cubes; I just use one.

I followed the recipe exactly. The tablespoon of pepper permeated the entire dish making it almost uneatable. I could not taste anything except a strong pepper taste and it even smelled like pepper. I like pepper, but it was more like eating pepper than a soup. The chicken was over cooked and dry. I will try again, but change the recipe to use thighs and 1/2 TSP of pepper.

I modified a lot of this recipe to make it a little easier. First, I didn't add in the carrots or celery because I thought the bag of mixed veggies would be sufficient. That being said, I put in two 16oz bags of mixed veggies because we like ours heartier. I also substituted 2 cups of chicken broth for the bullion cubes. As far as seasoning I used the celery salt, pepper, and garlic powder instead of garlic salt because that's what I had and it worked fine. I did not add any salt because everything combined is salty enough. This ended up making a whole crockpot full so I made 16 biscuits to go with it. It can also be eaten as just a hearty soup in my opinion too.  Overall it was very quick and easy, cutting the chicken was what took the longest out of all of it. I would definitely make this again!

Great recipe!  I did make some changes:  Instead of bullion I used 2 table spoons of powered chicken broth, I added 1 tea spoon of onion powder, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp of white pepper.  2 cubed  fresh carrots, 1 cup frozen peas, 1 cup frozen corn.  I added all the ingredients at once with the veggies on the bottom, topped by the cubed chicken and then added the can of soup.  Great cold weather stew while watching football!

Better than Pot Pie! Though it was not exactly right for my taste, it was easily tweaked for my family. 
I made this pretty much per the instructions to make a double recipe. I used frozen skinless boneless thighs, and added onions. I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. Omitted the other salts altogether, and did use about a tablespoon of coarse ground pepper. I used four 10 oz cans of different condensed cream soups because that’s what I had. 
Lastly, added approximately two teaspoons of cayenne pepper after tasting it toward the end of cooking. Before the cayenne, the dish was rather bland for my tastes. I did not add the biscuits, but served it over rice instead. Enjoyed thoroughly!

I used half the chicken and potatoes called for, but extra veggies. I also used only fresh veggies:  diced carrots, green beans, onion, celery, mushrooms. I added frozen peas toward the end of cooking time. I used garlic powder instead of salt, half the celery salt, and half the bullion.

This is a great recipe for a hearty meal with good flavor. I will probably make it again but will not add the biscuits since I did not care for their texture. I will probably serve it over already prepared biscuits next time.

It really does taste like chicken pot pie. Recipe calls for too much pepper for our tastes. Will be cutting that in half next time. But, yes there will be a next time!

Made this delicious dish today and we loved it. Interesting  that  the chicken mixture ladled over a buttermilk biscuit tastes very similar to pie crust in a regular chicken pot pie. I used left over rotisserie chicken pieces and 2 cans Healthy choice  cream of chicken soup. Instead of the recipe seasonings with salt, I used some Italian and Greek seasonings without salt and added about a cup of water and 1/2 cup white wine. After cooking all in a crock pot for about 6 hours, it was DELISH and gave  a delightful aroma in the house. Will definitely be making this again during cold weather as it is truly comfort food at its best.

Very salty and I already had decreased the celery salt  to 1/2 tsp and substituted the 2 tsp garlic salt with one tsp of garlic powder.   Also, the recipe said to cook on high for 5 hours and then another hour after adding the frozen mixed veggies.  Had to turn off after 3 hours as the potatoes and chicken were cooked.  Very disappointed and a waste of ingredients....

My chicken soup curdled. Carrots/potatoes turned mushy. Did taste good. Looked unappetizing on the plate.  Added none of the "salts". Used Low-sodium chicken broth . 5 hours on high is too much.

I made this for Sunday dinner.  Everyone loved it!  It had lots of flavor and is definitely a keeper for cold winter nights.  As noted in another review, just reading the recipe,  I could tell it was going to be loaded with salt.  I put in three boullion cubes instead of three. I also used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  Next time I make this, I will probably use low sodium soup.  All in all, it was very good.

This was a great starter recipe. I did a pretty thorough overhaul, in large part to considerably cut down on the salt and incorporate more herbs. If you would like to see what I did, my recipe is posted as Crock Pot Chicken Pot Pie Soup.

To much black pepper. One tablespoon seemed to much. I put in less but still to much. Next time I'd decrease to one teaspoon. Can always add more pepper later. Otherwise, yummy.

As suggested by a variety of reviews I incorp almost all that interested me....decreased to 5-6 red potatoes, increased to 3 ribs of celery, decreased to 1 cube bouillon+ added 1 -16oz chick broth, changed garlic powder NOT salt, changed to celery seeds NOT salt, decreased to 1 1/2 tsp of pepper, added 1 onion loosely chopped,added sliced mushrooms, added sprinkle of creole seasoning for a little kick, and biscuit dough spread on top baked for the last 30 minutes or so (dough: 2 c self rising flour, 6 Tablesp of mayo, 1 c milk).  EASY!!!

Very tasty dish, but I added 1 med onion with the other vegetables, reduced potatoes from 10 to 8, and used only 1/2 T pepper - I figure more can always be added later if someone wants it, but you can't take it away.  The next time I make it, I'll also use 5-6 chicken breasts instead of just 4.  It wasn't quite meaty enough even for me who doesn't have to have meat at every meal.

It was delicious! the cook time was perfect. But I had no idea what Chicken Bouillon was.... instructions say add 6 cubes, DO NOT do that. maybe add 2 max! The taste of the stew was great but sooooooooooooo salty. I had to make the stew 2 more times and mix it all together just to try and make it less salty to eat. I have left overs for an entire week but its great now lol.

Added a few extra bullion cubes cause I didn't have the celery salt.  Had a great flavor and left overs were just as good if not better!  Will make again for sure, huge hit with family!

I loved the basics of this recipe, but I did some changing, dropped the carrots, celery and bouillon, there was plenty veggies in the frozen mixed veggie bags, and I had saved the broth in my freezer from chicken I had cooked the month before, also way to much pepper for me, so I used 1/2 teaspoon. The other change I made was serving over long grain rice, I served this dish at church and everyone loved it

Very good recipe - I read through the reviews and twinked this recipe based on suggestions made by others and put my own spin on it.  I halved this recipe since it makes a lot - only used 1 chicken bouillon cube since it also called  for celery salt & garlic salt.  Added a little ground sage and a bay leaf too and cooked as directed.  I thickened it up with flour and water/milk and served it with homemade buttermilk biscuits.....it was a hit and I will make this recipe again - it is a family favorite.

I'll admit I haven't made this YET but read many of the reviews first.   Since canned soups are generally notorious for being high in sodium, I will be adding NO salts.  Will be using the low sodium chicken broth I already have instead of bullion cubes, one can cream of chicken, one cream of celery & one cream of mushroom. garlic powder, celery seed, coriander.   Will skip the potatoes or at the very least lessen the amount and use one or two sweet potatoes instead of red because of  serving over biscuits.   Hope I can pawn this off on my S.O., since his opinion of pot pies is unsuitable for posting    LOL     Otherwise, I'll be eating leftovers for quite some time.    Since there are only the two of us, will likely have to halve the recipe unless it freezes well.   I'm sure our dog (a.k.a. the tapeworm, the gargoyle) will also want a bowl or four.  :)

Followed the receipe to a extent I cut the potatoes smaller  bite size pieces along with the carrots. Eliminated the celery salt and garlic salt also like one other viewer did a lot of sodium going there, added garlic powdear instead. Was really good over biscuits wife was impressed.

I made this but out of necessity I had to make some substitutions. I didn't have enough cream of chicken soup so I used 2- 10.5 ounce cans of cream of chicken soup, 1 -10.5 ounce can of mushroom soup and then made a white sauce with half the bouillon to make up the difference in amount of soup. It turned out well.  I appreciated how versatile this recipe is and I wouldn't hesitate to use all the soup if I had that many cans available.

Great recipe alike the other reviewers I made some changes. First Off I only used one bouillon cube and omitted the celery salt  to make it less salty. 6 cubes of bouillon is too much. I only used a quarter cup of diced carrots as the recipe calls for frozen mixed veggies which already contain carrots. Also I had a cup of chicken broth and mixed some flour and water together and added that to thicken it a little. With these changes it turned out wonder! Thanks for

Nice warm winter meal. My kids loved it. I actually brought the crockpot to the ski chalet and it cooked it's last 2 hours while the kids and I skied. Came off the trails and warmed up with this stewy goodness. I halfed the boullion, added a bit of garlic.  I will make again for sure

We travel in our motor home full time so I am always looking for a recipe I can throw together before we leave and then have for dinner at our destination.  My whole family (hubby, teen son & daughter) loved this.  I think it could be better by reducing the 1 tbsp of pepper down to 1-1/2 tsps.  I used two packets of Knorr Condensed Chicken stock instead of the boullion.  I also used 2 Regular cans of cream of chicken and one regular can of cream of mushroom. I also used about 1/4 tsp of thyme and 1/4 tsp of poultry seasoning. I also added chopped peppers, zucchini, yellow squash and onions. I also used frozen peas and corn instead of the mixed veggies and used fresh carrots and green beans (no potato).  I love recipes that allow me to add extra veggies - my kids don't even notice.   I believe this would work well baked into a crust for a true pot pie as well.  This is very filling. We each had one biscuit covered with the stew and there is enough for dinner tomorrow and probably a lunch for two of us sometime later this week.   This is definitely a keeper!

Wonderfully rich flavor and easy  to prepare.  I altered the recipe for 4 servings and omitted the salts.  Used garlic powder and celery seed instead.  Also used sodium free bouillon and one can each of regular  and low sodium cream of chicken soup.  Served over split cheddar biscuits,  it was very satisfying comfort food.  Will make again.

I agree with what a lot of others said on here. It's definitely too salty if you follow the recipe exactly and use 6 bouillon cubes. I'd cut this back to 1 or 2 cubes. I also added some chicken broth and used half fat free cream of chicken soup and half regular to cut back on the calories and it still tasted good. We had biscuits with it and it was yummy! All in all a great easy recipe.

I followed some of the suggested alterations to the recipe and it was a hit with my family and friends! I switched out the chicken bouillons for regular chicken broth and just used garlic powder and celery instead of garlic salt and celery salt. It still came out a bit too salty, but with biscuits or some kind of bread on the side it was fine! I would use less broth and more chicken soup mix and add both red and idaho potatoes to keep the sauce thick. Overall I would make again

This was so delicious and filling! Was my bf and I's first slow cooker recipe and we really enjoyed it! If you don't like too spicy I wouldn't recommend using the tablespoon of black pepper that is listed. We LOVED it but for anyone who strays away from spicy or peppery I wouldn't suggest it. Maybe just a pinch. This is our fav slow cooker receipe thus far! Still good

I would definitely make this again.  It was peppery, so if you are not a fan of pepper, I would cut back to half the amount.  It is a lot of ingredients, so smaller crockpot users beware!  Next time I will either cut the recipe in half or use a larger crockpot.  I decreased the heat to low and doubled the time because I was making it for my lunches for the week and I had it cooking overnight.  Everyday the flavor got better...even my boyfriend commented on that over the course of the week!

I followed exactly and found it way too salty and peppery. My husband no with high blood pressure refused to eat it.
I think it can be saved by decreasing billion cubes.

A pretty versatile and easy meal for a college student with a slow cooker! I loved the smell of it and the chicken was nice and moist. I omitted most of the salt because of having one kidney but it was still great! I used Creole seasoning, a bit of garlic powder, and a dash of salt. I had some flaky biscuits on the side and I was so full. I have leftovers which is awesome, good recipe!

This is the best ever comfort food once a few changes have been made. This is what I did:  Substitute 1 can cream of celery soup, use 1 tsp garlic powder and no garlic salt, only 3 boullion cubes, a splash of milk, peas instead of mixed veggies.....and more carrots and celery and only 5 potatoes. YUMMY!!!!! and use boneless chicken thighs!!! add salt if needed at the end. I threw all ingredients into my electric pressure cooker including frozen chicken. It was done in 45 minutes and tasted like it had simmered all day long!!! Serve it over  canned or homemade biscuits. It doesn't get better than this people!!!!!!

Super easy and very tasty!  I cooked this on low as I needed more than four hours.  I also added milk to the cooker(about 1/2 cup) as I was surprised at how little liquid there was prior to cooking.  I had bone in, skin on thighs but used them anyways. I also used two russet bakers as they hold up better to all day cooking.  When I got home from work I took off the skin and removed bones which was super easy.   Next time I will add probably another thigh or two and definitely use less garlic salt.  In fact, probably just garlic powder as it was pretty salty.  Just a few of my changes, but REALLY GOOD!!!!

I halved the recipe for two of us, and the sodium is way too high. I substituted 2 cups of (organic) brothfor the bouillon. (Next time, I'll use stock for a stronger flavor, or a white wine.) I also chose an organic condensed soup and regular carrots prepped by hand. Chose garlic powder over garlic salt, and used 1/2 the amount of celery salt. Added in 1/4 tsp sea salt in lieu of the garlic salt. I kept the black pepper as listed, and truthfully still wasn't quite enough. I did a full 16 oz of the mixed veggies, but honestly I'd rather find other fresh veggies to throw in at the start and be done.  Next time, I think I will add a bay leaf or two, and forget the celery salt altogether.

Everyone LOVED this...I used garlic powder, used 4 bouillon cubes, and lower sodium soups..in order to cut the sodium.  I will use less pepper next time.  still with a few minor adjustments...this is a great recipe for crowds...I also used bonesless/skinless thighs, instead of breats, stayed moister, more flavor.

Omg...Too much pepper!! I should followed my instincts when it sounded like too much! I didn't use all the salt tho. I used fresh garlic instead of the garlic salt. Just used the 1 Teaspoon of celery salt.  So if I would have just put 1 teaspoon of pepper..it would have been wonderful!  It's ruined. we couldn't even eat it. :(  People that post their recipes...be more careful when putting the measurements!!

My wife and kids liked this and requested I make it again soon. I did not use the frozen veggies. I used canned and fresh veggies instead.  Like many users in the comments section I also used chicken broth instead of bouillon cubes.

My family and I liked this dish quite a bit.  I wanted the sauce thicker than it was turning out  though, so I  added about twice the amount of cornstarch as the recipe called for.  Will definitely make this again!

I used 3/4's of a tablespoon pepper. The stew came out way too spicy, so I tried to salvage it with lots of milk. The recipe  is good otherwise.

I wish I had the reviews before I made it! I think this could be a good recipe,. but the salt content is WAY over the top! I couldn't taste anything but sale - which was a real disappoint to me. I won't even try to "tweak" this - it's not worth it.

Loved it! Only needed half the ingredients since I'm not looking for a family, and found that if you adjust the time to 4h total, and add the frozen veggies at 3h15m, it turns out wonderful! I did note that it was a bit pepper-y, so next time, I'm using 1/4 of the recipe's recommended pepper, which should be just about right.

Delicious!!!  I eliminated the salt, added garlic powder, some basil and parsley. I added extra black pepper since I like that flavor. I substituted the cubes for 1 can of chicken broth and substituted one can of cream of mushroom, since it was in the cabinet. I served this over a nice freshly baked biscuit!

This deserves a 5 star rating, but because I didn't make it "exactly has written" I couldn't give it the full 5 stars, but the alterations I made was 5 star delicious! 

I made this a couple weekends ago. It was SOOO good. I did make a couple alterations however. Instead of the chicken bouillon I used 1 chicken stock in a box and then near the end of the cooking time I added a couple tablespoons of flour to a 1/4 cup hot water, mixed it up and poured the mixture into the pot to thicken the gravy base. I left the celery salt out because I already had the chopped celery going into the pot.  And just for personal taste reasons I only used 1/2 teaspoon of chopped garlic. To serve, I poured it over biscuits. This is a keeper.

Made for Jim and Yvonne when she was sick.  They loved it.  It looked and smelled delicious so will make for us again.  Used garlic, sage and poultry seasoning; and boneless, skinless thighs.  Just threw it all in the slow cooker.  Cooked on high and was done in about 4 hours.  Added frozen peas towards the end.

I was glad I read many of the 1- and 2-star reviews before making this stew.  Based on comments, I used 1 teaspoon black pepper (1/2 would be better) instead of 1 tablespoon.   I added a little more frozen mixed veggies and omitted the baby carrots completely, since my mix already included them.  I cut my potatoes into 8ths instead of quartering them.  For extra flavor, I added 1 teaspoon dried thyme and 1 bay leaf.  Finally, instead of 6 bouillon cubes I used 2.  After about 4 hours cooking, I tasted the stew and found it somewhat bitter(??), off-putting, and bland, so I ended up adding 1 teaspoon of kosher salt, which was perfect.  I prefer the mellowness of kosher salt, so next time, I will omit the celery salt and garlic salt completely and replace with kosher.  I served the stew over biscuits, and my husband and I enjoyed it.  I think it might work better to ladle the stew in a bowl with the open biscuit on top to prevent it from becoming soggy.  I plan to freeze the leftover stew since it made quite a lot.  All in all, with modifications, this is a good, easy, hearty dish.

This was a hit with my very picky family.  The only suggestion I have it to reduce the pepper by half as well as the chicken bullion.  Overall, it was delicious!!  Will definitely made again and again!

I made the recipe and substituted 1can chicken broth for the bullion cubes. Unfortunately the 1Tbsp pepper called for ruined the flavor...too much pepper! I would use pepper to taste or 1tsp at most. I will try this again but make changes. We also had to thicken the base at the end. I might try 1/2 can chicken broth next time to improve consistency. It has the potential to be very good and was super easy to prep.

Too salty for me. I gave it three stars because of the simplicity of the recipe; quick and easy. Try half the recipe and possibly no chicken bouillon, the canned soup should be enough salt and flavor.

This turned out looking like it had already been eaten.  If I were to make it again, I would include a lot more liquid, so it didn't have that gloppy consistency.

This is my all time favorite recipe. I have made this a dozen times since I recently got my crock pot. The only thing I do differently is I add a little less pepper than is called for. It's so good.

I made it without the bouillon cubes and added chicken broth but I thought the stew was missing something, it didn't have much flavor.  It was still really good but I added a lot of salt to it. I will make again tonight and follow the exact recipe and see how it turns out.
Update: so I made it how the recipe says to make it and it's SO salty. Doesn't really taste anything like chicken pot pie but more like a Mexican chicken tortilla stew. This is something I need to just tweak to get the desired taste. Will make again and change things up.

Trust that it will end up "soupy" enough.  
I didn't trust it with the condensed soup and added another can of water.  At the end of cooking, it was too watery and I had to add cornstarch.  So just trust it.

I made it almost exactly the way the recipe said other than the garlic salt which I had none and just used garlic powder and it came out quite well. It didn't seem overly salty to me or my wife. I also added a little bit more celery and carrots then said too just to get it a little bit more bulky.

First time I made as instructed. It was very good, but too salty for my family. I made again; sub garlic powder, sub 2 low sodium boullion, sub 28oz homemade chicken broth + 1 can cream of chicken, doubled the pepper, added a poblano. I will be making this again.

1 buillon cube, turkey meat instead of chicken, garlic powder instead of salt, 1 teaspoon of black pepper. 4hours on high, then one hour with frozen vegges. Yummy. Easy. A great way to use leftover turkey meat from the holidays.

The recipe is a very good one. The only alteration I feel it needed was to the amount of pepper. I'd put about half of what the actual recipe calls for  unless you like the dish with a very peppery kick. Otherwise it's really really good!

This recipe was great! I usually get the pre-made pot pies from Costco, but I won't be doing that any longer! I served the stew over reduced fat biscuits. Great leftovers for work as well.

I couldn't figure out whether or not the bouillon cubes needed to be dissolved in water or not?  I dissolved them in 1/2 cup of water and added it to the slow cooker.  My final product came out more like soup than pie filling. Probably my fault!

I went to check on this after 4 hours and the meat was already overcooked!! Frustrating too because I used pheasant that my husband hunted for rather than chicken :( I left out the boullion cubes and cut the garlic salt and celery salt in half. Wish I wouldn't have used the celery salt at all since it is extremely over powering! Since the recipe is so easy I'll try making it again but I'll cook it in low and use different seasonings.

Dear god this is salty. And I didn't even add any bouillon as having read all the warnings and put in a little chicken broth instead. Salty. Potatoes, sugar, extra water added and it's still a bit too much.  Had I not added the chicken broth and maybe even less salt, it would have been perfect. Next time..

It is a keeper !! :) (with a few changes).... I didn't put in the cubes instead I used a cup of chicken broth.  I halved the service size. I think next time I will use veggie broth.  either way it was my first try at a slow cooker and it was successful. thank you for sharing!!

I used one can of chicken broth since I didn't have chicken bouillon on hand.  Also, I would decrease the amount of black pepper...just was a bit overbearing...other than that, it was an amazing dinner, and super easy!!!

This was a great recipe when I knew I wouldn't be home from work til 6:30, it's 40 degrees here, and my kids were hungry. I went with the reviews and didnt use 6 boullion cubes, I used 2. I used about 6 red potatoes, and used lots of fresh garlic plus garlic powder...not garlic salt. I also added one cup of chicken broth.  It made a whole, huge crock pot of stew. Very yummy and easy!

The only change was was due to not finding an ingredient. So no baby carrots. This was awesome and delicious. I had plenty of leftovers that I ate during the week. Leftovers were just as good as it was the first day. I will be making this again!

Way too much pepper in the original recipe; I wish I'd read more of the reviews here before making it, because an entire tablespoon of pepper completely overwhelms the dish. My husband likes very spicy dishes, so he didn't completely hate it, but for me it was nearly inedible as-is.  (And this was after I tried to cut it with another can of cream of chicken.) Also, I suggest swapping out the frozen veggies for either fresh or canned. I know canned doesn't have the same nutritional value as frozen, but it was very obvious to me that the veggies weren't fresh. I'll also echo what some other commenters said, in that the potatoes seem a bit redundant if you're serving over biscuits as suggested. Overall, quite disappointed in this one.

I sauteed  3 chicken breast, onion, red bell pepper, celery, green chile, in garlic olive oil and some garlic salt. I added potatoes, peas, corn, mushrooms. I used only 1 can of cream of chicken soup. I used 1 tsp Better than Bouillon with 1 cup of water.  After 3 hrs on high, turned to low and added 1/2 cup of Fiesta Dip. (sour cream with red and green jalapenos). In New Mexico we like our green chile and jalapenos. Maybe I could of thickened it with a roux.  Wasn't thick enough for me. I use a 5 qt slow cooker.

The main issue I had with this recipe is the amount of salt, way too much! I didn't add the carrots or celery because the frozen vegetables had everything I needed. Also I added 4 bouillon cubes but next time I will only use 2. The garlic salt and the celery salt are not necessary but I did use the garlic salt and added a cup of milk the last 15 minutes to tone down the saltiness, next time I will either eliminate the garlic salt or cut it back. This is a great recipe and with a little tweeking, it was awesome! I definitely recommend it and will make it again!

The recipe is a great base. I made the following adjustments because of what I had on hand.
- Cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken 
- omitted the boullion 
- added an onion and fresh garlic ( still used half the amount of garlic powder) 
- added a bit of Italian seasoning to make up for no boullion 
- used only a tsp of pepper
-my crockpot cooks a little faster than most so I  cooked it on low for about 5 hours then turned it up to high after adding the veggies. 
Potatoes turned out really well. They're were flavourful and not mushy like some slow cooker stews.

I made this after reading some reviews and used homemade broth and homemade cream of chicken soup (from this website). There was no problem with saltiness . I did find it to be more like soup than stew and had to thicken it with flour & water at the end. And it does make a LOT! Completely filled my crock pot. Served over Chef John's buttermilk biscuits (this website also), it was fabulous!

Before you measure out what you need, make sure your slow cooker can fit all of the ingredients. I didn't check (default 16 servings) and caused my medium slow cooker to overflow.

Despite this, it's very delicious (that much black pepper gave it a healthy bite)!

It's a great, easy recipe.  I wanted chicken pot pie but didn't have time to make a crust from scratch (I never buy pre-made ones).  So this recipe was a find! I'm assuming the extra salt everyone is talking about was needed in the original recipe due to the amount of potatoes used.  Potatoes can soak up a lot of sodium, without tasting salty themselves, when added to a dish.  I only used a small amount of potatoes, and because I ran out of bullion, I didn't add that.  I never use garlic or onion salt either. I just chop or grate the real things when a recipe calls for it/them. I did add some vegetable stock I keep in the freezer and will salt the entire dish (if needed) once it cooks a while.  Put it all in the crock pot about an hour ago.  So far, so good.

I made this once before and had made a few adjustments. Definitely omit the boullion!  This time, I minced 4 garlic, diced 1 small onion, and 2 stalks celery, put them into the crockpot with some chicken broth (maybe 1 1/2 to 2 cups) and sprinkled black pepper generously.  I added 3 potatoes, diced.  Then, I took 6 chicken breasts and sliced them thinly against the grain and added them to the crockpot.  2 cans light chicken condensed soup were stirred in next.  Crockpot set to low for 5 hours. After 3 hours added a large bag of frozen mixed veggies.  Served with refrigerator biscuits fresh from the oven and family loved it!

I read all the other reviews, and took every ones advice. I made sure not to over salt it. I used garlic powder and celery seed instead of the salts. I also used half of a bulilion cube. I used a can of chicken broth too. I liked it, but my husband said it was okay, it didn't taste like a chicken pot pie to him. I will try to make this again but change it up a bit.

Delicious and easy recipe.  Did take advice and omit garlic salt and bouillon, and substituted one cup of chicken broth.  Next time will reduce amount of potatoes.

My husband liked it more than I did. I didn't find it to taste like much. I'll try it again because I love pot pie but don't have time to make the traditional maybe I'll read the reviews for substation ideas.

Had to alter it a lot. I was only making it for 2. So I only used one bouillon cube, one can of cream of chicken, did not use any salt. After everything it was a great dish over flaky biscuits. I would make it again

I was just making this for my husband and me so I cut back on the potatoes to 4 and used red skin so I left those on. Instead of bouillon cube I used 6 teaspoons of Better Than Bouillon Chicken Base and 6 cups boiling water. I didn't have celery or garlic salt so I used celery seed and garlic powder. And at the end of cooking I thickened the broth with cornstarch and water mix. And then we ladled everything over our biscuit.   My husband liked it but I knew it wasn't full of healthy ingredients so that's the only reason I didn't rate it higher. But it was a quick and easy recipe.

*Edit 06/18/2018: Holy cow, how did I miss this is so salty! 
 I must have used low-sodium cream of chicken the first time. 
 If I make it again, I will leave out some of the bouillon cubes and maybe use low-sodium soups too.  

Very good, but I didn't use so much pepper.  In fact, I used just over 1 teaspoon, and it was still maybe a little too much for my taste.  Oh, and I didn't have enough canned cream of chicken, so about half of it was a homemade recipe of cream of chicken.  Other than that, made it as instructed, and it's very good.  In fact, I wouldn't mind putting this in a semi-regular rotation.

We didn't like this. The flavor just wasn't there even after adding poultry seasoning.  I thankfully followed the recommendation of omitting salts and bouillon cubes. I also added a can of chicken broth and that made it much too watery.  It wasn't awful but I won't be making it again.

I did alter the recipe as we are only 2 people BUT I will certainly make this again and will for more than just the two of us too.  Many mentioned their try came out very salty so I reduced the Chicken Boullion and substituted the Garlic Salt with Garlic Powder.  We found it perfect and I don't usually add salt to much - only at the table but this didn't need a thing.

Absolutely amazing. Only things I did different were instead of using frozen mixed vegetables. I felt there were already enough carrots in it. I got a can of corn and a can of green beans. And put them in at the beginning. I would add an extra can of soup just for more sauce and only use 2 bullion cubes maybe 3. I didn't use celery salt. Stir at 5 hours and start some biscuits in the oven. Chicken fell apart it was so tender. I wish I cut the potatoes into smaller pieces. I will be fixing this again!!!!

Too salty and way too much pepper. I ended up pouring it into a strainer and rinsing it very well. Back in the crockpot with a 10 oz can of cream of chicken and 1/2 cup milk.

Recipe was fine. I only wish I had read the reviews before cooking. The chicken bouillon cubes definitely ruined the flavor and smell for me. My boyfriend said it tasted like there was a lot of "pepper or something" in it. I lessened the amount of pepper, so I'm sure that's not what he was tasting. In the future, I will completely omit the chicken bouillon cubes.

I always use Herb ox Sodium free bouillon. It really makes a big difference in the salty taste.  I only used 2 envelopes for this recipe and it was "yummy".

It was okay, nothing particularly special. Overwhelmingly tasted like cream of chicken soup and not much else!

Only about half of the carrots were of the desired consistency; many were far too firm for having been in the slow cooker for about six hours!

I halved it, as my crockpot is considerably smaller than the recipe calls for!   Boy are the other comments right about the pepper!  I expected a more creamy texture, but was pretty soupy.   I used garlic powder instead of salt, no celery salt-didn't have any.  And actually forgot the bullion, but other comments tell me it was not essential to the dish.  I guess I'll eat the rest cold or when I feel  like exceptionally spicy.  Unfortunately my son (8) wouldn't touch it.

I made this, and it's delicious, especially over biscuits. I did change the recipe, because the bullion coupes are a bit much. It's perfect with 2, and a little water (add enough for the soup), and cooked for 4 hours in my cooker.

My husband and I made this dish for the first time today and served it to young kids and parents.  Served stew on buttermilk Grands  Biscuits and a pistachio creme salad.  Everyone had seconds. Not a drop left!!!  No additional seasonings needed on diningroom table for this dish.  Next batch ready to make then freeze for hunting camp :-)

My whole family really enjoyed this. I did use chicken broth instead of bouillon due to others suggestions. I also used only frozen corn instead of mixed veg because it already has carrots and celery in it. I served biscuits on the side and it was perfect! Staying on my staple list for weekly meal plans.

When I was making it, I thought 6 bullion cubes is way tooo much, but I thought the recipe knew what it was talking about. Turns out I was right, it came out so salty, that it was inedible.  Despite all of the salt, I could tell it was a good recipe, minus the bullion cubes.

Yum! I follow the recipe exactly and this came out very good. The carrot flavor was a little stronger than I like, maybe because the bag of mixed veggies had carrots in it also. Next time I will peel and chop my baby carrots and use half as much. I didn't have any biscuits to I served this with Saltine crackers. Very hearty and filling...reminds me of chicken and dumplings, without the dumplings.

I made this in the summer & still had that warm comfy home feel when  I ate it. This was absolutely delicious. 
NOTE: However did need more chicken stock as the stew absorbed it. Also, I added rosemary, because I love it in pot pies & it was just the right touch

I see a lot of reviews saying this recipe call for too much salt...but what about the pepper?  That's a ridiculous amount of pepper and because my husband helped me throw this together, he used what the recipe said.  We both found it completely inedible!  I would make this again but with both salt and pepper reductions.

Hello people, The Netherlands speaking, I just got a cast iron slow cooker. Me happy! And decided to try this recipe. I have to guess how much ounces are, but I think I got it figured. (still guessing ;-))Some ingrediënts i'll have to improvice on, but it smells delicious. I am gonna cheat on the buttermilk biscuits. Am using off the shelf puff pastrie things.

My family and I enjoyed this for dinner last night!  I will make it again, and when I do, I will cut back on the pepper and salt.  You can always salt & pepper stuff at the table, right?  I also added three diced pieces of spring onions. Made some cheddar/cheese biscuits, too.  This is really an awesome dish and smelled wonderful while it was cooking!

Even without a slow cooker, this recipe was a hit. To cut back on salt I used celery seed and powdered garlic. Also I added about a cup of chicken stock and 1 less bouillon cube. It was a big success and made enough to last a week.

I cut the servings to 8 and still had left overs. I didn't use the bullion but did use some low sodium chicken broth.  I added some flour to thicken up the broth. It was a huge hit. Fam loved it.

Very good. This is something I'd have to get used to eating just because I grew up eating all of those ingredients in one convenient little bowl, but very good nonetheless.

I made this today. Instead of condensed chicken soup, I used butter, milk and flour. I mixed this before hand so that the mixture thickened. I also chopped large carrots, used a bag of just frozen peas, and added chopped kale! it was delicious!

I cut back on the pepper too and doubled the mixed vegges. I replaced the soup with a Healthier low salt version, The Bouillon cubes with no salt packs, & 1/2 a teaspoon of garlic powder instead of garlic salt.

Great recipe full of flavor.  I made minor substitutions I added 4 oz. of sliced mushrooms & I substituted (4 LG Sweet Potatoes for the 10 Red Potatoes & I used Low Sodium/Fat Cream of Chicken Soup).

I made this for the first time a few weeks ago. honestly, I've never had chicken pot pie before. it was absolutely delicious. I followed advice from some other reviews and reduced the salt, added garlic powder, cream of mushroom soup and cream of celery soup. I'm making it again this time but doubling the recipe bc last time there wasn't enough to satisfy my palette!

amazing recipe.  i followed this recipe pretty closely, only leaving out any and all things celery (gross!) and only used 1 bullion cube.  served over grands biscuits.  de-lish!  just finished some leftovers for lunch and i think it might even have been better the 2nd day.  thickened up a bit more.

this would be amazing to use to make an actual pot pie.  will FOR SURE be making this again!

I prepared this recipe over the weekend and we had it for dinner tonight. The preparation was simple and flexible. You can make several modifications to suit your palate and it will surely still turn out well. I agree with others regarding the bullion cubes. Wish I had noticed the other comments prior to making this dish. While our stew is not too salty, the cubes are totally unwarranted. Seasoning such as organic no-salt seasoning, sweet ginger garlic seasoning, and oregano - or others - will do. I actually used these with the cubes, thus saving us from mouthfuls of salt. The seasoning tempered the salt, but the sodium is nonetheless present. I will eliminate the cubes when preparing it next time. Great recipe though!

I thought the potatoes and carrots weren't necessary ...and really, I wasn't a big fan of the celery either. If you're going to serve the dish over biscuits (which was delicious), the traditional "mixed vegetables" that come from a frozen bag work nicely all on their own. From a nutritional perspective, potatoes are a great carbohydrate on their own. Putting them together with the biscuit, I felt, was too much. I would choose one carbohydrate source or the other. Otherwise, it's a great dish and very easy to do.

Had a 10 lb. chicken and a large breast all with skin and bones so I simmered all in water with some Mural of Flavor a herb and spice mix, no salt, from Penzy spices. Cooked for  2 hours removed and let cool. Separated meat from skin and bones tore into pieces. Mixed 2 large cans of Cream of Chicken soup with roughly one can of the liquid I simmered the chicken in. Added celery, small container of fresh mushrooms sliced, garlic powder, a little celery salt, pepper,cooked chicken,. combined well cooked on high 3 hours in Crock Pot. Added a package of frozen carrots and peas and cooked on high for another hour and half. Served over some fresh baked buttermilk biscuits. Very good tasted like a pot pie from a five star bakery/deli. I froze a portion to see how it would be. Just as good. Next time I thought I would line some ramekins with some prepared pie crust, ladle in some finished product, put a top on it and bake.

I made this today and we had a great dinner! I did alter it to reduce the amount of salt; used celery salt but garlic powder and 1tablespoon of low-sodium chicken Better Than Bouillon. I also made my own cream-of-chicken soup and it came out just fine. Served with baking powder biscuits and it was a terrific, comforting meal.

This recipe has lots of potential but if you follow it exactly as listed you may find it too salty to eat! With a little tweaking and less salt I think it will be great!

This is so delicious. However I substituted low sodium chicken soup and used garlic powder and celery seeds instead of the salt mixes. I also substitutes low salt bouillon.

My kids loved this!  I didn't add the celery salt or the garlic salt because I don't like either. The soup and the boulion cube are more than enough. We used a low sodium cream of chicken soup and that was just enough seasoning for us. I also found that it was watery, so I added some cornstarch to thicken it up an make it closer to the consistency of chicken pot pie. I also added ALOT of veggies.  The kids really, really liked it. It tasted even better the next day!

Tasty recipe. I adjusted the recipe to feed four people then doubled the chicken and potatoes. I also omitted the frozen veggies and added canned creamed corn. Since there were a few things in this recipe that were salty already, I used a little less chicken bullion than suggested. Overall it tastes great!

I wish I would have read the reviews of this before I made it.  It seemed like it was going to be super salty so I used just some chicken broth and put in one bouillon cube.  I really wish I would have cut back on the pepper-- no need for a sweat lodge after eating this with a whole tbsp of pepper.  I added some fresh herbs from the garden and a half cup of white wine at the end.  I didn't use the frozen veggies at all.  I will make this basic recipe again with some major modifications.  Tweak it to your own taste and it should be fine-- very quick and easy to make, that is for sure.

Great recipe!  Simple and yummy!  I did some variations.  I used adobe and seasoned each piece of chicken, I added half a large onion diced, 1- 26 oz can of chicken condensed soup, 1- 10 oz can of chicken condensed soup and 1- 10 oz can of cream of mushroom condensed soup. I did not have celery salt or chicken bouillon and I think it would have been too salty with that. I used less potatoes. Followed the rest of the recipe and served over Pillsbury biscuits from the oven. Family wants a repeat!

Very, very good...used low sodium chicken broth instead of bouillon. I used no salt, only Vegeta, which is salty vegetable dry seasoning. I was light on pepper too, but I like tasting my food as I go, better be safe then sorry or hungry. When I added frozen mix vegetables towards the end of cook time I put a tbl spoon of flour to thicken it up a bit. It turned out perfect, especially when I poured it over crispy biscuits.

I made this recipe according to the instructions and it turned out GREAT! The only thing I did different was cut the pepper amount to one teaspoon instead of one tablespoon due to small kids eating the meal. It was very hearty and very filling.

Loved it!  So easy to do.  Changed it a little, but my hubby and son came back for more...and more....
Instead of 2 tins of chicken soup, I put 1 of chicken and corn and 1 of mushroom.  Also halved the bullion, didn't add any salts at all, added an onion, plus an extra tin of water.  This made it a bit sloppy, but I just thickened it with a chicken gravy mix and added some two-minute chicken noodles.
Everyone walks in from work demanding to know what I've been cooking (and there are 4 kids and a hubby).
Definitely a winner in my home!

I changed quite a few things: I used 2 cans cream of chicken, 2 cans cream of celery, 1/2 cup of water, 2 sweet potatoes- cubed, and a generous sprinkling of Mrs. Dash Original Seasoning (No Salt). I guess I came up with a completely different recipe! Towards the end of the cooking -- couple of hours left, I added pearl onions and mixed frozen veggies. Cooking the chicken, soup and potatoes from the get go helped thicken the sauce, and the soup made it creamy and delicious! Before baking my biscuits, I sprinkled shredded cheddar cheese on top of them -- so yummy! I did not try the recipe as it is posted because of the reviews, and looking over the ingredients it definitely sounds like it would be too salty.

Not bad, I'm not sure if my potatoes were just large, but I used the amount the recipe called for and felt that the mixture didn't have quite enough sauce, so I added a little more soup to mine. It is plenty salty, so I would recommend using less bouillon. I halved the recipe and only needed a cube and this was perfect for me. Very filling and I would imagine this is quite a bit healthier than the average chicken pot pie. Oh, and if you don't want to wait for the crock pot method, I cooked up my chicken and boiled my carrots and potatoes in a separate pot. Then I put the other ingredients in a pot and added the cooked chicken and potatoes, made my biscuits, and then ate it about an hour later.

We try to do low sodium, so I used low sodium soup and eliminated the salts (used garlic powder instead of garlic salt).  I added a bit of thyme, because we like that with these kinds of chicken/turkey dishes.  We ate this over canned biscuits.  It was okay, but no one was excited about it.  My daughter seemed to like the potatoes more than anything.  We didn't bother with the leftovers.

My family loves this, taste great and so easy to throw together. The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars is the fact there is way to much salt in it, which of course I altered to begin with.

Great Family meal and easy to prep, however it is extremely salty! I didn't even add the garlic powder just the chicken cubes and celery and that was more than enough.  Next time I will use less cubes and no celery salt or garlic salt.

Love this and make it all the time now. Didn't have celery so I used one can cream of chicken and one can of cream of celery, omitted the bouillon (just to cut back on salt). Easy to alter and still have a delicious dish.

Loved it.  My rating is based on it tasting the way I 'think' it should. Very easy to make.  

My changes were:
I used 1/6 of the recommended bullion, 1/2 of the recommended pepper.  Replaced the garlic salt with garlic powder. Omitted the celery salt. I added about twice the amount of recommended baby carrots and frozen veggies.

This perfectly suited my need for a meal with easy prep that I could make in the morning and forget about until dinner.  As I was buying the cream of chicken soup I happened to see cream of chicken with herbs, so I bought that.  I also added some chopped onion and some sliced fresh mushrooms, as well as some poultry seasoning and rosemary.  I served it over noodles, and it was very good and everyone seemed to enjoy it.

Very good and easy. You definitely don't need all of the salt. We used only one cup of chicken broth versus the bouillon and 1/4 cup of flower to thicken it a bit. We also did a biscuit bowl too which was good. If your already making the biscuits flip a muffin pan upside down and shape the dough around it, looks cool and gives you a good portion size!

I probably would have loved this recipe if it had only a dash of pepper.  I was so overwhelmed by the pepper that I couldn't eat much of it.  Might try it again, but only use pepper to taste.

The end result was very good and tasted like chicken pot pie filling. To make it lower in fat I used the 98% fat free cream of chicken soup which I think made it a little thinner than most stews but didn't detract from it. I DID however, just based on gut feeling, decrease the amount of ground black pepper from 1 TABLESPOON to 1 TEASPOON and that was good for me. I like pepper taste but not the overt spiciness that can come from it.

Delicious. I did leave out the celery salt and bullion cubes, and substituted garlic powder for the garlic salt. I also cut the pepper back to about a teaspoon and a half. I will definitely be making this again.

I added no bouillon and no extra salt.  Added some bottled garlic.  But delicious served over a biscuit.

Very tasty served over buttermilk biscuits.  Use 1 can of chicken broth and no bouillon cubes.  Thickened with potato buds for a creamier stew.  Will make again.

Lacked some pizzaz. I cut back on the bouillon as suggested but it just seemed to be ok tasting. Not sure if I would make again :-(

Yum!!! I made some modifications based on other reviews, didn't add celery salt, only added 2 cb cubes, and I added 8 oz of chicken broth. I also added 4 tlbs minced garlic and increased the pepper to 3 1/2 tlbs. I used rotisserie chicken from Costco cause I didn't have frozen. I drizzled chicken stock on the chicken and let it sit while the other ingredients cooked and added it when there was 1 hour left. I cooked on low for 4 hours. Oh and I didn't add frozen veggies cause I didn't have them. Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!

A little one-note, but pretty good. Cut the potatoes up really small! And I only used one bouillon cube; otherwise, it would have been incredibly salty. 

To make it a proper stew: take out some of the cooked potatoes and puree them, then mix them back in.

I have made this recipe 3 times, and my whole picky family loves it!  I leave out the celery and celery salt and add dried onion and dried minced garlic in place of garlic salt - the condensed soup is salty enough.  I find that chicken thighs give a deeper flavor than chicken breast, and we like the texture better as well.  I've used red potatoes and Idaho potatoes, peeled and unpeeled.  I've used all frozen veggies when I'm in a hurry.  I can get this in the crock pot in less than 30 minutes even with chopping and/or peeling potatoes and cutting up the chicken.  I haven't tried canned chicken or precooked rotisserie - but I bet they'd be good as well.  This is a fool proof, very adaptable recipe, and leftovers are even better the next day.  My own personal touch to my plate only is to add lemon juice to the leftovers - like greek lemon chicken soup. Yum!!

This was good, but not what I was expecting.  I would say it's more like a chicken stew.  There's not really anything "pot pie" about it.  It was more of a broth than the creamy consistency I would expect in a pot pie.  I also used coarse ground pepper which ended up making this very peppery.   Just something to be cautious of next time.  I will probably make it again.

Very good but use only the 1 or 2 chicken bouillons.  This is a very easy recipe that could be changed in many ways but I went with the this recipe and was very pleased with the result.

I loved this recipe, with a few tweaks.  I agree with all the comments regarding salt content.  I, too, could tell it would be salt overkill if I followed the recipe.  I left out all the added salt, and I think next time, I'll even leave out the bouillon based on what other reviewers have said.  My family loved it served over biscuits.

Great recipe.  I did modify just a bit with no sodium bouillon and lower sodium cream of chicken soup.  It was a bit bland but you can salt to taste when serving.

I didn't grab two cream of chicken at the store. I did 1 cream of chicken and one cream of mushroom.. I did 1 bouillon... ok don't judge me.. I was super afraid it would be sooo salty.. I did add one can of broth as others suggested.. my husband said not to next time. He said it would be nice thicker. I liked it with broth.. So that's not a deal breaker if you do or don't. We had this for Thanksgiving dinner. Since I am gluten free and not a turkey fan, this was a great alternative.  Its simple and inexpensive. Its rich and creamy and the celery salt adds so much.

We followed it all the way but instead of 6 chicken bullion cubes we used 2 and a can of low sodium chicken broth. I cooked it on low for 6 hours and added the veggies the last hour. Delicious we will definitely make this again!

Mama Shaw made this stew.  I intuitively cut down on the sodium.  Luckily I had celery seed without salt and garlic powder without the salt.  I only put a tiny bit of bullion.  I wish I had only added a tsp. of pepper.  1 tablespoon is too much.  I only had chicken quarters with the bone on them and would never put any bones in this stew again.  The chicken was so tender and it fell off the bones which made more work for me to have to find all the bones before serving.  I also didn't have enough condensed chicken soup so I substituted some for some cream of mushroom.  My husband gave it 10 stars and my daughter gave it four. I give it 4.5.  Mama Shaw will definitely be making this again.

This is really delicious on a cold day or a day when you are feeling a little sick, but it does have a little too much salt. I might recommend using less bouillon or salt.

Family hit! I used a pre cooked rotisserie chicken from the store, sliced two large carrots and cut up fresh beans into 1/2 inch pieces or so and tossed it all in from the beginning.  Based on other input, I omitted the salt and bullion completely and only used 1 TSP of black pepper. I used: 4- 10 oz cans of cream of chicken soup and then filled one and a half of the cans with chicken broth to help get extra soup out of the can.  Mine may have been a tad thinner than a pot pie but it was delicious and far from " soupy" !  Served it on top of Grands biscuits.  Oh- and I omitted the potatoes.  Next time I may try the potatoes and a dash of red pepper flakes?? Hmmm. Lots of options.  Definitely being added to the favorites page of my recipes!!

I made this recipe and halved it for a smaller batch.  When I saw the
TWO tablespoons of black pepper, I knew it was too much.  I only put
in 1/2 t. and it was too much.  So I would say taste, and then season
with pepper.

This was so salty we could not eat it!  1/2 the bouillon cubes is my suggestion.

Great easy recipe...makes an entire 7 qt crock pot full.  I served over rice and/or mashed potatoes..would be good with bisquits.  I added extra chicken as well.

Made this recipe.  Very good, but WAY too salty.  If I make it again, I would certainly limit or eliminate the chicken bouillon cubes. Nancy

1 Tbsp of Ground Black Pepper is way too much.  It was way too overpowering in the recipe.  Other than that, it was pretty darn good.

This was great . its extremely good . I didn't add any salt  or pepper while cooking . Used two cans of cream of chicken as the recipe indicates and one small can of cream of celery . used maybe 8 potatoes .cooked the breasts whole and shredded at end and also added some shredded turkey I had frozen . Very easy and very good . Cut potatoes and baby carrots in bite size pieces .

I agree with those who said it was too salty.  Garlic powder for garlic salt would work, and I'm not sure that the celery salt adds that much.  And a TABLESPOON of black pepper?  WAY too much for me. I'd  start with a TEASPOON and go on from there.

Used a cup of chicken broth instead of the bouillon... but the  pepper was crazy. Try a tsp instead, maybe.

I made it according to the recipe, but there is a serious amount of black pepper that pretty much overwhelms the entire stew. However, it smells fantastic, so I'll have to try it again with less pepper next time!

I cut this recipe in half, nixed the potatoes, and used some chicken broth and cream instead of bullion. I also used a can of cream of mushroom and a can of cream of chicken. It didn't come out that thick, so I'd reduce the broth and cream next time. Overall, I really liked it and it's super easy which I love.

Good but missing something, the way I made it.
Didn't measure any of the spices (added too little pepper), skipped the bouillon cubes, used 1 can cream of celary & 1 can cream of chicken, and added a can of water (should have skipped that, didn't come out as creamy as I would have like, I was initially worried I didn't have enough liquid, especially since I was using frozen chicken) and used a frozen seasoning mix with onion and peppers.  Turned out good, but not quiete chicken pot pie filling like I was expecting.  I think next time it needs more onion.  I added everything at once, instead of adding the frozen veg. at the end, and it turned out fine.  I also started with 6-8 frozen chicken tenderloins, did not bother to cut them, much easier to just shred them at the end.

Delicious recipe, I choose not to add chicken bouillon though, I felt like chicken and cream of chicken was enough, besides bouillon adds that extra saltiness. Otherwise great and easy .

Loved it! Served it over buttermilk biscuits. I omitted the potato and carrots, and I cut the recipe in half. There was too much pepper so I would reduce it to 1 tsp (for half the recipe) or less.

Just like the other comments - I did not add all the bouillon but this recipe was a great base! I used extra potatoes and assorted veggies and added onion powder and thyme, used 2 cans of cream of chicken and one can of cream of mushroom and only used 2 chicken bouillion cubes and topped it with a little sharp shredded cheddar. hubby said he really liked it and I agree! this is very customizable and super easy! definitely will repeat!

I love this.  I would alter it slightly because it is salty. I skipped the salty ingredients and it was still slightly salty. next time I am going to cut the bullion cubes by half and add some low sodium broth. this truly tasted like a chicken pot pie!

Only used 2 tsp chicken bouillon and it was just right. I didn't even bother with making biscuits because it was good as is.  We tried crushing Ritz and Club crackers over the top and that was yummy too.

A homey recipe, I did use bone in chicken and have used an already cooked chicken from the deli in the past, makes it a little moister than blsl breasts. This is a little thick so it is very good over biscuits. Thanks for sharing.

Too salty so eliminate the bouillon cubes and celer salt completely!  The only salt I added was for seasoning the chicken as well as some pepper, but not as much as the recipe called for.  I added frozen corn, peas and some nonfat half'n'half to make it creamier.  Also some thyme.  Makes a lot and is delicious!

I guess I can't really rate the exact recipe; I changed a few things. I didn't add celery as my family doesn't like it. I only had 1 can of soup, so I used it and then shook some cream and chicken broth and flour together in a jar and used that. I can't imagine using 6 bouillon cubes; just way too much salt. And is it just me, or is 1 tbsp of pepper a typo?  I used less than a teaspoon and it was definitely peppery enough. I used fresh minced garlic and also added half a diced onion. I know my recipe was different, but this one was a good starting point. :0)

My toddler loves this (and if you have a picky eater for a toddler, you'd love it too).  But when I read the recipe, I immediately forgoed the celery salt and garlic salt and opted for fresh celery and minced garlic instead.  I also cut the bouillon cubes down to 1.  There is plenty of salt in the condensed chicken soup, and of course, salt to taste.  I serve this with extra flakey buttermilk biscuits, and my kid has a ball dipping it in the broth, and she gets her fill of veggies too!

As usual, I subbed a few ingredients. It turned out okay. Next time I'm going to try to find a way to make it a bit creamier.

Good recipe, but I changed a few things.  To start, I halved the recipe (which nearly fills my crock put). Like everyone else, I skipped the chicken bouillon.  I didn't want it so thick, so instead of 1 26oz can of cream of chicken, I used one 10.75 oz can, and then added almost 2 cups of chicken stock.  And instead of 1.5 tsp of pepper, I only add 1.  The first time (and another time I forgot), the stew was too spicy for my family with halving the pepper.  
This was a great base recipe, and is a regular in my house with my alterations.  It is also very flexible.  I often use regular potatoes and/or carrots depending what I have in the house.  Sometimes I add mushrooms. I often skip the frozen veggies, but those might help thin the stew with all the water in them.

Was really good but....
So i cut back on the bouillon cubes to one and used 2 cans cream of chicken soup and one can on cream of chicken and mushroom soup ( had 7 large thighs and was going to freeze some).  After 4 hrs I tasted and needed seasoning, salt, something ... so added 2 more bouillon cubes. It helped some. This is a good basic, family friendly recipe.  Would add some more fresh thyme next time and maybe some paprika.  I will make this again.

This recipe was great! It was so quick & easy to put together. I doubled the recipe but still made some changes after reading the other reviews. I only used 2 bouillon cubes, 1 tsp of garlic salt, 1 tsp of pepper & I completely omitted the celery salt. I love salt and would salt everything if it would taste good and I thought that the seasonings in this were just right. I didn't feel the need to any anything else to it. I also added lima beans & corn. Great way to make chicken pot pie without all the work. Would def recommend this! I will be making this again in the future!

Good recipe for a fall evening. I used 4 russett potatoes, a bunch of spices, 2 cans cream of chicken, some frozen veggies, bag of baby carrots, 1 can water, garlic, and some onion. At the end it was a bit watery so I added 1/4 cup flour to thicken it up.

Didn't have that chicken flavor I was expecting and I put in 4 chicken breasts.  Took the advice of other users and cut back on the bouillon.  Also, not as thick as I expected.  Served on Grand Biscuits.  Presentation was fine.  Would definitely tweek the seasonings though.

This was a good base recipe...changed a little.  It was very salty and peppery (I only used 3 bouillon cubes, and the 1 tbs of black pepper was way too much.  I only used a teaspoon and it was very peppery).  I used 1 can of cream of chick soup and 1 can of cream of mushroom.  I added about a 1 1/2 cup of water.  The last hour I put fresh veggies in (string beans, broccoli, cauliflower, and corn), and added about 2-3 tbs of cornstarch mixed in about 1/4 cup of water to thicken it up.  It was hardy, and very tasty.

I had read some of the reviews, so I was apprehensive about adding 6 bouillon cubes, so instead I only added 3. It was still way too salty. My husband also thought it had too much pepper. He will not be eating it again, and now I am left with a ton of leftovers. I would recommend not using 1 tablespoon of pepper, as it's too much.

I wasn't sure how this recipe was supposed to turn out.  My turned out as a brothy soup, which is not what I was going for.  I then added half cup of red wine to cut some of the salty chicken broth flavor, then I thickened with mashed potato flakes to make a stew.  It turned out well then.

This was good. I used 3 cans of soup by accident..next time I wouldn't add the potatoes if I was going to use biscuits. My husband said it didn't taste exactly like pot pie, but that's probably because I used two cans of mushroom soup and one can of chicken. I think I would emit the can of mushroom next time and the potatoes. It makes ALOT.

I made this for dinner tonight, the whole family loved it...even my picky seven and four year old!!!  Wow I followed some of the advice others gave, I added no bouillion and no celery salt or garlic salt.  Instead I used 1 tsp. of pepper loads of fresh grated garlic, a dash Italiano seasoning, three cans of low fat cream of chicken soup, two large carrots, 6 med. potatoes, 2 stalks of celery, a can each of whole grean beans and peas thoroughly rinsed. I'm really impressed

I cut this recipe in half and there was still plenty to go around.  The adults liked it  but the kids were just so-so on this one.  I didn't find that it really tasted like pot pie, more like chicken stew.  I'm sure I'll make this one again though!

My family enjoyed this recipe.  We down-sized the recipe to serve 6.  Our comments would be to add more chicken and veggies.  I also reduced the salt.  Very good; this one is a keeper.

Very hearty but I would recommend adding salt to taste, not the recommended amount.  I also added 2 cups of water and ONLY 2 chicken bullion's (geez, 6 would knock the wind outta ya!).  I slow cook for 8 hours on low so the need for the extra water, but I wouldn't recommend the extra water if you slow cook on high for shorter times.  I added some frozen peas in the last ten minutes of cooking.  Stirred at the halfway point and then again when I added the peas.

i have to admit that i didn't love this, although i was really expecting to.  it just lacked flavor i thought and tasted too much like you poured cream of chx soup over chicken and frozen veggies, which i guess if you think about it, you kind of do... anyway it was ok but not something i will make again.

Way too much bullion! Recipe was alright. Think it could actually be really good if the you take out or lessen the overpowering condensed fake chicken taste of the bullion.

This is a great recipe. I did have to make modifications based on what I had on hand. Instead of the red potatoes I used a can of cut up potatoes (mostly drained), a can of carrots and peas. (Again mostly drained. Left out the celery and bouillon cubes and frozen mixed vegetables. Still turned out great!

Only used 2 bouillon cubes and less of the 2 salts, will just use the herbs next time plus a sprinkle of salt as the soup is so salty already.  To make it a pot pie one needs a topping so added some buttermilk biscuits from the fridge section of the grocery store during the last hour of cooking (at which time I added the frozen veggies) and it made the dish very good.  Not to mention cutting down on the pepper as per previous reviewers.

Very good on a cold night. I used the healthy choice canned soups and that cuts down on fat and sodium. I served this over biscuits make with the light BisQuick. Worked out well.

My husband and I LOVED this! We happened to have some puff pastry in the freezer, so we defrosted it, put the finished stew in a pie dish, and laid the pastry over it, cooking it at 400 degrees for about 10mins (until the pastry was golden brown) and served it with French fries! Great recipe!

Hmm. I'm not sure what I did wrong, but this was...just ok. It was very watery! Not sure why... I used only 3 bouillon cubes but it was salty enough- just watery. I also thought the baby carrots were unnecessary...
