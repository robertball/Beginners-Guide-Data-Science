This is an awesome version of Taffy Apply Salad.  I usually let the pineapply/marshmallow mixture and the vinegar/flour/juice/egg/sugar mixture sit in separate bowls overnight in the fridge and then assemble the salad right before serving.  Delicious!

Awesome recipe, everyone loved it.  I also added some tapioca pearls with the marshmallows and they were kind of fun. Also add more apples, the more the better.

I've used a version of this recipe for years. The only thing I add that is different is a large Snickers bar chilled and then cut up in small chunks.

What a delicious apple salad.  I took this to a baby shower and came home with an empty bowl and requests for the recipe.  I made this as written; only I did not peel the apples.  I really liked the salted peanuts in this recipe.  They worked well with the sweetness of the other ingredients.  I made the salad up early in the day, but did not stir the peanuts in until right before serving.  I did not want them to get soggy. This is a wonderful salad that I would make again.
