This is a very delicious way to cook butternut squash! 
Next time I think I will cook it at 375 or take it out of the oven sooner. Since I love nutmeg, I might add just a bit. :)

This was the first time my family and I had eaten butternut squash and it was great! Kids and husband loved it! I was out of sour cream, so I used about a half a cup of goat cheese, and instead of the fresh basil, I just sprinkled some dried basil in. To make it easier to peel the squash, I put it in the oven on Broil for 5 minutes. It softened the skin so that it peeled easily and was easier to cut without cooking the squash.

Never cooked or eaten butternut squash before.  This was wonderful.  Took a little longer than I thought to peel and cook squash, though.  If a person doesn't have "experience" with this type of squash, they might want to take a little extra time for prep.

I thought this was a really creative way to use butternut squash. It was tasty. I added cubed chicken to make it a full meal. I cut the squash length wise and roasted it for 50 minutes at 400 degrees which made it much easier to handle.

This turned out great!  I cut the squash in half, and microwaved for 5 minutes so it could be peeled easily.  Then putting this recipe together was a breeze.  Everyone loved it for supper and we had it warmed up for breakfast!  Will definitely make this again!

Just made this recipe...I didn't have any mozzarella so I used other shredded cheese...Used low fat Greek yogurt in place of sour cream and it was very tasty...My husband loved it! We will have the leftovers for breakfast with crispy bacon...I agree with the other reviewer: It does take a while to peel and cut up the squash...Make sure you have a good sharp knife and cut the squash into bite size pieces if you don't have a food processor...

Very tasty meal.  We had this with brown rice and a vinegary cole slaw salad.  I made a few changes:  I added beans to the squash and onions.  I used cheddar instead of Parmesan.  And I mixed the mozzarella with some ground flax seeds.  My family requested that the next time I make this I have a bigger cheesy layer.  So I'll probably just double that part of the recipe.

Fantastic!! I used feta cheese on top instead (used parmesan inside) and only had to use a 7x11 pyrex dish.

This was my first time eating butternut squash in, and I loved it! I did start cooking the squash first, before adding the onions, because I thought it would take a little longer to get the squash tender. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly as it was, and I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is banging! Instead of fresh basil, I added a few tbsp of dried basil. I've made it a couple of times - one time I used some leftover cheddar cheese, the other I used leftover Jarlsberg and both times it was delicious!

i followed the recipe exactly and the results were excellent.  I questioned the amount of onions but they added so much wonderful flavor.  it's also a visually appealing dish with melted, browned, chewy mozzarella cheese on top.  Definitely a keeper!

Easy way to get the squash cubes...just microwave the whole squash for 5 minutes (depending on size). Great recipe, I used evaporated non fat milk, reggiano parmegiano and lemon juice for the tang. I'll definitely do this again with a pork roast.

I made this exactly as the recipe was written except I substituted Monterey Jack cheese for mozzarella because that's what I had on hand. It was delicious and a great way to use butternut squash that isn't a soup. I will definitely make this again.

This was great and easy. As always, I got helpful tips from other reviews. Most importantly, I only cooked for 20 minutes, which was perfect. Was a bit liquid-y right at first but firmed up nicely. I don't like Parmesan so I did use Mozzarella for all the cheese and I added more spices including nutmeg, Italian seasoning, and dried garlic and basil as well as the fresh garlic. I also used a bit of wine in with the olive oil to cook onions and squash, because I like the flavor that adds sautéed food. Great texture and taste, will definitely make again.

Had only 1.5 lbs  Butternut Squash so halved the recipe in 8"-8" casserole dish.  Added some Panko bread crumbs at the end of cooking squash in skillet and extra amounts of Parmesan and minced garlic, plus a hint of nutmeg.  

Very delicious as a main entree with salad (plus added Seasoned Italian Bread Crumbs with sprinkled Mozzarella on top!)

Cooked at 400°  for 35 mins.

I baked the butternut squash first. The taste of parmesan was a bit strong for me. I would use less next time. I used a casserole dish instead of the 9 x 13 pan and I used yogurt in place of the sour cream because I was too lazy to go to the store, but would definitely like to make it again to try the sour cream.

I tried this recipe as written. It was a different way to fix butternut squash. I kind of liked it,will have to fix it a few times to see if it will be a regular.

YUM! Loved the new twist on butternut squash. I added, some other vegetables to the mix, and used sourcream, cheese, and cream cheese and loved the result. I also added a bit of cinnamon!

I paired this with a bean loaf that I made, and it really balanced out the richness of the cream with the beans.
 Give it a try

This is a delicious recipe!! I know I'll be making this one often. My hubby loved it too, someone at his work smelled it while he was heating it up, so he had to share some!  That guy loved it too!  To make it a full meal, I added some browned Italian sausage just before putting it in the casserole dish.

Perfect just the way it is written.  First time I cooked butternut squash and won't be the last.  I put it in the microwave for 5 min to make is easier to peel and cut.  Fantastic recipe - thanks!

Really a delicious dish but I had a few issues which prevented a 5-Star rating. For my taste there was insufficient salt and I had to add more. I’m not a big salter but 1/4 tsp was just not enough to enhance the overall flavor.  Just as I feel the salt was lacking the basil was too prominent. I cut back to 1/4 cup because that was all the fresh leaves I could harvest, but next time I will use only  2 tablespoons.  And also next time will bake at 350 for a little longer.and put under broiler briefly to brown up the mozzarella. I feel that 425 is too high for a custard. (Mine was not nearly set after 15 min and then separated slightly from overcooking). But really a wonderful recipe- told my family it’s our new macaroni and cheese and they enjoyed it thoroughly.

We browned a pound of pork sausage in a cast-iron skillet with the onion,  then added everything else, putting it all in the oven.  Delicious!  To aid with peeling the squash, we baked it first for about 30-minutes to soften it up a bit.  Great dinner.

This was delicious!  I used pre cubed butternut squash found in the produce section of our grocery store.  Caramelized the onions as suggested, added a can of pinto beans and cooked as directed (did not seem like quiche at all).  So good!

I was very disappointed with this recipe,  This was not creamy at all.  Was more like a quiche.  I think you need to eliminate the eggs and go with a cheese sauce, the 3 eggs don't work.  I also cut back on the onion and only use one onion, and only three gloves of garlic.  Would not make this again.

I wanted to get away from sweet side dishes this year and ran across this recipe. I tried it on Thanksgiving and liked it so much I just cooked it again today. It is now my favorite butternut squash recipe. I am using a slightly smaller dish to make it in, since I didn't want it spread out quite as much. Great taste.

My family didn't like this dish as much as I did, but I really enjoyed how savory it was, especially so because of the onion. So the leftovers were all mine! It was my first time working with butternut squash and I'll use this recipe the next time I do, too.

I put Feta cheese on top as previously suggested, as well as have added dried Oregano to the recipe. Broiled towards the end. It is delicious!

This was great, it had a lot of flavor with the onion/garlic/basil. I had some green bell pepper that I added as well. I served it with grilled chicken and didn't need to season the chicken at all because the casserole had so much flavor!

I just made this for thanksgiving day, and I am sorry to say this was not a big hit.  I would not recommend this dish. The squash would have been better sautéd by itself and served just that way. I don't think cheese and egg did the squash any justice. Very disappointing. One star rating only because the squash was seasoned well and tasted good by itself.

EASY DIFFERENT.     I have made this and freezing for Christmas
2016. I made a small one to eat tonight. It's good. Quite different with this egg topping and not a butter and bread crumb topping. It is plentiful, and defenitly a seperate layer.
It's custard like. I liked it, I always need something different with squash. I pre- cooked or softened squash in Micro for
easier cutting. I then skinned and cubed squash.  Added to onions and then in casserole. Addded brown sugar and touch of nutmeg. I used Greek yogurt in place of sour cream.
Poured egg mixture over squash and cooked. Very nice.

This is a very different way of preparing butternut squash than we’re used to.  While it is not our favorite way, it was still a nice change of pace.

Our family really likes this squash dish. I used a bit less garlic and did not have fresh basil, but used my dried herb. I have made this a few times already. I think it is a good dish for Thanksgiving or Christmas.

This was ok but certainly nothing special.  I don't really think that the squash and cheese go together very well.  We like butternut squash and eat it often in the winter - usually roasted with some olive oil and salt.   We prefer it that way and for the effort this just wasn't worth it.

This is excellent!  I followed the recipe exactly but added a little more salt after reading reviews.  The garlic offsets the sweetness of the butternut squash nicely.  I'll make this one a lot.

This was my first experience with Butternut Squash, made this as listed but substituted dried basil since Fresh was not available. Love the recipe but wash shocked how sweet the butternut squash was despite salt, onions and garlic! Never having cooked with Butternut Squash I thought the sweetness came from all the brown sugar, molasses and Maple Sirup recipes usually call for.  So, great recipe but butternut squash is off the menu for us going forward! My husband said it tasted like pie and asked for the whipped cream ...  thinking of trying this with potatoes instead for a satisfying meal or some other, less sweet squash...

It's okay but I didn't use the mozzarella cheese. I didn't want too much cheese. This is definitely a side dish and not a full meal. I am a pescatarian so I am trying to find dishes that offer a good balance of protein and fiber. I also don't like to eat fish meat every day.  While the egg and cheese offer protein, the dish just wasn't enough for me.

I had been looking at this recipe for sometime now and finally decided to make it. I did not change a thing and it was great. I may try some of the different variation posted by other readers just because I got so many squash this season, but it was pretty awesome the way it was.

This was great! I did not have any sour cream so I substituted 1/4 cup cottage cheese and 1/4 goat cheese . The only other change I made was before I added the mozzarella, I put a layer of pancetta on top of the veggies.

It was very good. Sometimes squash can be a bit strong in taste but this was very good. Next time I am going to lessen the Parmesan and the basil and see what it is like. They were a bit strong for me.

This is a really delicious recipe. I chopped the squash pretty small in a food processor (kinda by accident) and it still was very good. The topping is like a quiche almost. It took about 5 minutes less than the original cooking time for me, so keep an eye on it.

More of a Butternut Squash Quiche, than Casserole. I added chopped walnuts and nutmeg to the mixture before I baked it. Great side with chicken or turkey. It was a Thanksgiving  smash!

Wonderful blend of flavors.  Most super markets have the butternut squash already cleaned and cubed which saves time.  I recommend the fresh basil.  The sweet squash and savory cheese is terrific.

My family and I loved this recipe! Followed to the "T", except used Colby Jack on top. I was not expecting the quiche-ness texture, but as an egg fan, I loved it! I recommend more basil or tarragon and pepper.

Had a kind of quiche texture that I did not care for. Was surprisingly bland. It wasn't terrible, but I definitely won't make it again.

Thanks Easy Cook for submitting a butternut squash recipe that is a bit different.  I esp. liked the topping...the basil really gave it a nice flavor.
