I was so happy to find this recipe! I am one of he co-creators of the "Shrinking Chatter Safari through Africa" (found on the recipe exchange) and had been looking for a recipe to try out in honor of our trek. The heat of this dish is just right leaving a lingering tingle on the tongue. Very tasty and the peanut butter adds an extra depth of flavor that the whole family thoroughly enjoyed. I made exactly as written using olive oil for the veggie oil in the recipe. I wouldn't change a thing. Thank you for a wonderful recipe which will be a keeper in our rotation.

Having seen other recipes for African Chicken Stew I would used different vegetables (such as sweet potatoes turnips) and use vegetable broth instead of water. It would intensify the taste. All in all the recipe is very good. I increased the garlic to 3 cloves minced spinach to 3 cups and reduced the red pepper flakes in half.

mediocre.. quantity of ingredients way too much.. Potatoes & chicken amt can be halved.. just make sure you don't "hold over"... par boil potatoes first!

I too was happy to find this recipe. Long-time friends of ours were missionaries in Cameroon (I think) and served African stew to us one Friday evening. My husband loved it! That was many years ago and he says this version doesn't quite match his memory but he liked it anyway. Not sure what's different--I remember discovering the peanut butter but I was more fascinated by the bananas with mayonnaise and chopped peanuts that were served as a side dish. It totally distracted me. Anyway we love this dish and I'm taking it tonight to the church potluck where other former African missionaries and a few African exchange students will be eating. Wish me luck!

The foundation ingredients here are good but I changed it up quite a bit. Used prescribed amount of chicken and all chicken stock and vegetable stock way more than 2 cups. Did 3 Tsp of cumin added 1tsp of curry powder and 1 tsp tumeric and 5 cloves garlic. Extra salt and pepper It still need helped so I added a large can crushed tomatoes and small can of whole tomatoes That did it! Created the taste combo I was looking for. Also used mushrooms carrots celery and bay. Just a trace amount of potatoes (2 small) which I added at the end. Then a huge container of baby organic spinach once I turned off the heat. Delicious!

I had thought I had coriander but did not. It would have helped this recipe. I added a touch of lemon pepper and chili powder to try to offset the missing coriander. I also added a can of chick peas which worked well. Hubby didn't stop at the store so I had no spinach. All in all recipe was very good. I did not add potatoes and put stew on top. I will make again once I get some coriander.

This stuff is addictive. I made it with celery bell peppers scallions and carrots instead of spinach. The family was very happy with the result. I used a dash of ground red pepper flakes which was perfect and avoided hot spots of crushed flakes. It's not a bad idea to season the chicken with salt pepper cumin and garlic while cooking. This one's definitely going on the "heavy rotation" list.

This is one of my go-too-stews. Just because I normally have these in my fridge I do sweet potatoes carrots red pepper onion and and entire package of frozen spinach. I have even replaced the chicken with chickpeas and it still turned out great. This recipe freezes really nicely as well. It always makes everyone in the staff room jelous when I heat it up at work:)

This is pretty tasty but I feel like something is missing. I'm going to have to play around with this to get it where I want it but I still loved the dish.

A very tasty and filling recipe. My 3 year old sister and my dad (pretty hard to please both!) loved it! My mom thought maybe some watercress or water chestnuts could be added though.

This wasn't bad though I thought it needed more salt maybe salting the chicken prior to cooking but it tasted a little bland to us.

Made with my kids tonight using left over turkey rather than chicken. My near 3 yr old had two helpings. I will make again but I will reduce the potato and add about a cup more stock. Overall all very filling recipe and pleasing.

I just needed more peanut butter. I didn't have enough. But even though I was short on peanut butter this dish was amazing. It has a little kick to it but I think I will put in more spicy ingredients. It was very cold here like 50s the other night so it was perfect! I had it with flat bread for dipping. My husband absolutely loved it! I will definitely make this again...and again.

I'd actually give this a 3.5. It needs more spice I think. I'll try it again probably doubling the spice in it. I did add carrots and I liked that. I used 1 fewer potato and added in 2 carrots. Everything else I kept the same. So next time more salt more red pepper and other spices. I really liked the peanut butter base so it's worth it to me to keep this one around.

I made it but i added garbanzos beans and stewed tomatoes and a onion soup pack plus mushrooms and carrots a can of spinach. Along with the other ingredients. But just enough peanut butter to taste.

I love this recipe! I've made it several times and I like adding sweet potatoes and carrots and double the chicken broth. Because I add to it I use extra spices--but not the red pepper. Thanks for this great recipe!

Outstanding! Best stew recipe I’ve found in years! Added a drained 15 oz can northern white beans, mushrooms & carrots, didn’t have spinach. Scared to add PB, tasted good without it, but added 1/2 cup chunky style-it took this to amazing! Thanks for sharing this lovely dish!

I’m only giving it four stars because I didn’t follow the precise recipe. But it’s DEFINITELY a good guide. Yes, I used all of the ingredients listed, BUT I used: two 12.5 oz cans of chicken breast pieces (drained & shredded) subbed water for extra chicken broth, used minced garlic and added diced bell peppers, freshly sliced carrots, curry powder, FRESH coriander, & olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Now, when I say I didn’t follow the precise recipe, what I mean is I MEASURED NOTHING!! I already had some frozen cut/cubes potatoes (with the skin on) because that’s how I store all of my fresh potatoes. From start to finish, in true fashion of my ancestors, I eyeballed, dashed, pinched, & tasted along the way to get it JUST RIGHT. It turned out BEAUTIFULLY!! So flavorful and filling. It was an instant hit!! Even with my son who doesn’t really like peanut butter). I didn’t tell him it had peanut butter in it. Haha!! Side Note: I was skeptical about adding that ingredient and I definitely don’t think I used 3/4 cups of PB, but it rounded out the flavors PERFECTLY!! DON’T SKIP IT!! If I had to guess, I’d say I used a heaping 2 tbsps of PB. The way I made this recipe, it made a little less than 4 qts of stew.
