I could only find 14 oz. cans of artichoke hearts, so I used 2 cans and used 1-1/2 times the parmesan cheese and mayo, but 8 oz of mozarella. I took this dip to a wine tasting party and it was a big hit. I served it with Triscuit Thin & Crispy crackers. Very easy to make but very elegant looking in the cassoulet.

This was prety good although next time I will double the artichokes.  I  also added onion powder about a cup of cheddar cheese.

Great recipe.  Everytime I make everybody loves it.  I add a touch of tabasco sauce for a little kick.

I added a can of green chilies and a splash of jalepeno juice to it for a kick. YUMMY!! als much better with fresh grated parm over canned like kraft as not as much flavor with kraft and oilier. Great recipe.

Love it!  Used 3 garlic cloves instead of the garlic salt, and 8oz buffalo mozzarella, chopped.  Tried adding a can of drained green chilis to it, as per another recipe, and that was good too.  Served with crackers and sliced baguette.

This is my favorite Artichoke Dip.  I usually double the amount of artichokes, but leave everything else the same.  I serve with crackers or pieces of torn french bread.
Thanks for sharing!

This was very yummy - even left over!  Next time I'll try it with some green chilies.  Thanks for the recipe.
