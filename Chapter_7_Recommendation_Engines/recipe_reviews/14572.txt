Good Lord Almight! These burgers are fantastic! After blending the ingredients, I let them set up in the fridge for about 1 hour before forming patties.  Grilling was no problem after brushing the grill with a generous layer of olive oil.  Forget the bun -- these burgers don't need it.  Instead top with a layer of steamed spinich and serve with Sweet potato french fries.  Visually stunning and absolutely delicious!!

At first I was hesitant about this recipe because I thought the burgers would be a bit too dry.  I ended up using ground turkey breast meat and added about 1/4 cup of chicken stock to the mixture of meat, feta and olives before I formed the patties.  They turned out to be juicy and wonderful, Definitely a keeper!

YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY!  Who knew usually dry turkey burgers could taste so good?  Made the recipe for Memorial Day cookout and everyone raved.  Here are some tips for serving.  I used fresh spinach leaves, sliced onion and roasted red pepper as a base for the burger in the pita - and topped it all off with a spoon of cucumber sauce.  There are now brands of feta that have olives, sun-dried tomato, and basil already incorporated into the cheese - and this makes a wonderful alternative to plain feta.  Also, if turkey burgers are a bit dry, use half to 3/4 the amount of turkey and supplement with lean ground beef. This does help make it a bit more juicy.  This recipe is definitely a keeper! THANKS, LOl!

Excellent! Great way to liven up ground turkey!
I used black olives instead of kalamata olives with great results.  I highly recommend this recipe! Thanks for sharing it!!

Love, love, love this recipe!  I am a new Mom and still have (7 months) later about 15 lbs. of baby weight to lose.  I decided to try the Atkins diet and was looking for different things I could eat.  These turkey burgers are fantastic without any bun or dressing.  I even heated them up in the microwave the next day for about 50 secs. and they were just as tasty, if now better.  Thanks!

Great burgers!  I cut the olives, since my husband and I don't like them, and added some pine nuts.  And he's been bugging me to make them again ever since!

After quickly scanning this recipe I think they should be called "Italian Turkey Burgers."  My thoughts of Feta cheese is "Greek."  So, I used 1 1/2 lbs ground turkey breast, 2 tsp. greek seasoning & 1/2 cup Mediterranian Olives packed in olive oil.  I also mixed the feta cheese right in the ground turkey. Fried them in a skillet with a little olive oil.   I then brushed extra virgin olive oil on whole wheat buns and lightly toasted them.  Topped the burgers with baby spinach leaves and a splash of fresh lemon juice.  Totally healthy and delicious. I served these with a healthy greek salad .  FYI: greek seasoning contains: onion powder, mint, oregano, garlic powder & sea salt.  Gives the turkey burgers a little more flavor than all oregano.  Try it!!

I've made these a couple times, they always come out very dry.  I will try the chicken stock as recommended - sounds like just what it needs.  They are quite good, just a bit dry and I think a little more flavour is in order, again perhaps serving with tzatsiki as recommended by some reviewers.  Overall a good lower fat substitute for beef burgers.

Decided to try the recipe as is and am WOWed! That four simple ingredients could create something this outstanding is just a mouthful of joy! I made the patties midday and had no trouble with them falling apart (a simple par-freeze-- 15 minutes in the freezer-- while the grill is heating should fix that for those having issues...it's what I do for my other favorite turkey burger recipe from Cook's Illustrated that contains ricotta cheese (that's a moist and tasty burger, too). That mixture is very delicate and handling improves 100% with 15 minutes in the freezer prior to grilling!) Hubby wasn't home to try these burgers, but I know he doesn't like olives, so my next attempt may be cause to try adding some diced dried tomatoes to his in lieu of the kalamata olives. Can't wait!

My family enjoys this recipe and we have put it in 'the rotation' of meals we make every few weeks. You don't really need to serve on a bun, they're good eaten plain without condiments, but you can go the lettuce and tomato route, too. A word of warning to those who tend to substitute freely, though. If you want to leave out the Kalamata olives find another recipe - they're an integral part of the flavor and the remaining ingredients won't make the ground turkey flavorful enough. Likewise, if you want to substitute black olives for Kalamata olives find another recipe - standard black olives are far too mild to be a good substitute.

Unbelievably delicious!  I used reduced fat cheese and added breadcrumbs to make this a loaf (cooked in the oven for thirty minutes at 375). Hubby and I devoured half before it made a plate!  Perfect--

I used garlic herb feta cheese instead of plain. I also added extra spices, I like to use Hot Shot pepper, Italian Seasoning instead of Oregano, Onion Powder, and a dash of Chilli Powder for color. Next time I make them I will add chopped onion. When I make Turkey Burgers, I like to put the patties in the freezer for 15 minutes to help them keep their shape. It works great!

We're always looking for new ways to use ground turkey as my husband does not eat beef. I found this recipe and my 14 year old daughter made these the other night. These were very, very tasty. Next time, though, I'll serve inside Peppy's Pita bread and topped with my Easy Greek Cucumber Yogurt Sauce. Both recipes are available on this site. Thanks for sharing this recipe. It's a keeper.

Delish! I added about 1/4 cup frozen spinach, thawed and drained before making the patties and cooked them on the stove.. I only cooked half the mixture as burgers and put the remaining meat in the oven and cooked as a meatloaf.   350 degrees for about 35-40 minutes for ½  pound meatloaf. Sliced and served in pitas for cold sandwiches. I dressed the pitas with a little mayo spiked with some “absolutely fabulous greek salad dressing” from this site, cucumbers, diced tomatoes  and shredded lettuce.

I rely on this recipe to please family and to WOW guests. I am always asked for the recipe (which I now have memorized)at parties. I do like to use "tomato-basil" or "mediterranean" feta cheese, not plain feta. I don't leave out the oregano, though! And I use lots of ground pepper.

Very good!!! I did cut back on the amount of feta, but I think it would be fine as is. Served on toasted garlic bread - very good. (They were actually good the next day chopped up, heated and served in a toasted pita with marinara sauce...)

I was really impressed with this recipe! I made sure to make it while hubby was out of town since he's not a fan of olives, but I bet even he'd like these! Instead of oregano, I used greek seasoning. I thought 2 tsp was a lot, but it turned out to be the perfect amount. These are very flavorful and moist too. Mine definitely did not take 10-12 minutes to cook. Don't overcook these or they'll be dry.  I think next time I'll take the other reviewers' recommendation to top with tzatziki sauce. This one's a keeper!

These are terrific, I have tried both ground turkey and ground chicken breast. They turn out wonderfully on the grill. I also substitute 1 tsp of Greek seasoning for one of the teaspoons of dried oregano. Love it!

very good. I did follow others by adding 1/4c whole wheat panko to keep the burgers together. I just was not sure without and didn't want them falling apart on the grill. served with Tzatziki Sauce I from this site.

We loved this!  I added sauteed onion and garlic (about 2T onion and 2t garlic), 1/4 cup oil-packed sundried tomatoes, chopped, a pinch of hot pepper flakes, and after everything was mixed, I made up the patties, packed in plastic wrap, and put in the freezer overnight (my husband insists that burgers grill better if he starts with frozen patties). I served with sliced tomatoes, and a mixture of plain yogurt mixed with grated cucumber (if you like things hot, add cayenne to taste), lettuce, and pita  for the bun.  Enjoy!  And thanks for a starting recipe - that is one of the things I like about this site - the sharing of ideas and starting points!

These were SO good!  I skipped the olives because I don't like them, but they felt complete anyway.  They taste good with mayo, mustard, ketchup, or any combination thereof.    I will definitely make these again.

Just made these last night on the BBQ and everyone loved them. Used fresh parsley and oregano and added green olives (stuffed with garlic). Also served them on foccacia bread. Serious, people went crazy over them.

We tried this recipe twice because the first time we accidentally used too much oregano, and only had black olives. We thought that was why we didn't like it.  It wasn't.  The second time we followed the recipe to the letter. I REALLY wanted to like this recipe.  I expected to like this recipe, based on the reviews.  I like all of the ingredients in this recipe quite a bit.  But, it just didn't work for us.  It was edible, but none of us (Me, my boyfriend, and my son) were racing back for seconds.  As a matter of fact, my son and I couldn't eat an entire patty.  I'll stick to "my" way for fixing Turkey Burgers from now on.

I make these burgers on a regular basis now - they are sooooo good! I've shared the recipe with other cooks and they all agree this is a different and delicious variation on the burger!

Really good and quick to make. Instead of putting them on the grill outside, I used my Foreman grill inside and the burgers were tasty. They seemed a little dry, so I added some dijon mustard and it helped.

Very tasty!  I didn't have oregano by itself, so I used an Italian seasoning powder that blends oregano, basil, parsley, and garlic.  I also added a dash of Tabasco to the mixture.  I ate it in a whole-wheat mini pita pocket with fat-free sun-dried tomato vinaigrette and fresh spinach.

These were great!  Only thing I did different was add a clove of garlic for our taste and also an egg to make the meat bind together better since I was afraid how it would grill.  We skipped the buns and had lettuce and tomato with it but definitely could use some of that Greek cucumber sauce they put on gyros.

Tried these last night and they were great.  I added the 1/4 cup of broth many people said was needed, then had to add bread crumbs because the mixture was far too wet.  Instead of the oregano and black pepper, I used store-bought Greek seasoning.  The results were so good that we are CERTAIN to try these again.

Coming back to add in changes we've made to this recipe to make it outstanding.
Along with the listed ingredients, we use a couple cloves of minced garlic, about 1/2 of a small red onion, and a splash of balsamic vinegar (a couple tsp), sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.
We leave these in the fridge for a few hours before forming up the patties. It's easiest to cook these from frozen, but with our mix we never have an issue with them falling apart when cooked in a pan stove-top. The indoor grill idea is out - they're just too juicy and sticky with the add-ins for the grill, so the pan it is. Love these burgers!

These were awesome! Def. make again! All we added to it was 1/2 cup of jarred sundried tomatoes in olive oil, parmesean cheese, garlic salt, and I added about a tablespoon of the juice from the olives. Thanks!

My husband and I really enjoyed these burgers. I did not put the olives in them cause we both do not care much for them and I used feta that had herbs and garlic in it. I also used a little greek seasoning that had oregano in it and they came out wonderful. I served them with butternut squash fries which were also really good and easy to make!

We love these! I always double the recipe so I can freeze the extra and have burgers on a moments' notice. We eat them in pita bread with sliced cucumbers and a drizzle of Greek dressing or tzatziki.

These were pretty good- I used black olives and 4 oz. feta and about 2 oz. goat cheese that I had leftover from another recipe.  The flavors were strong, but good.  I served them with wheat pita bread (I formed the patties sort of oblong to fit in 1/2 a pita) and topped with a dab of mayo and tomato.  They would be good with sour cream, but I didn't have any.  It almost tasted like a gyro!

This recipe is great and has never disappointed.  Friends and family love the burgers and they are very easy to make.  I serve with various buns instead of pita bread and I use sun-dried tomato dressing and thinly-sliced cucumbers as condiments.  They taste wonderful!!!

I am not a fan of Olives at all, but the husband is, and I love feta, so I thought I would try it.  This was great, we will be making this again.  It was so easy, and impressive.  The husband wants to make it for guests!  Used low fat feta and 99% fat free ground Turkey.

These are very good in terms of flavor and ease! I would advise not to use all white meat ground turkey breast, as that is what I used and they were a bit dry. I would use regular ground turkey next time. Over all, this is very tasty turkey burger! I think tzatziki sauce would make an excellent topping too!

I made this recipe into several meatloaves for my night to cook on our family vacation this summer and all 17 of us loved them!   Not one person ate just a single portion, from the 5 year old to the 55 year old.  Excellent recipe - I'm making them again tonight!

These were absolutely the most moist burger ever.  Even my husband who does not like kalamata olives thought they were really good...he did say I could omit the olives next time but only heard 'next time'.  I gave 4 stars b/c I used ground chicken instead of turkey, chopped the olives instead of using slices and used greek seasoning instead of just oregano.  I will be making these again as a 'healthier' alternative burger...but I may cut the olives to less then 1/4 cup for the hubby.

I made these this past Saturday, and then saw almost the exact recipe on the website today! We used whole wheat buns, but we even talked about how next time we will try to use a nice, thick pita bread! Some slight changes: I added some bread crumbs and an egg to help the patties hold together, and we added crushed red pepper and garlic powder to the mix as well.  We topped ours off with fresh baby spinach, red onion, tomatoes, and cucumbers, and my girlfriend made a dilicious sauce out of plain greek yogurt, lemon juice, and fresh dill. Served with grilled zucchini... VERY TASTY! The only thing was that I found it took much longer on the grill than 10-12 minutes... more like 20-25 over medium heat. Maybe I made my patties much thicker, but be sure to check the middle of the thickest patty before serving... turkey should not be undercooked.

Very good burger! Like others, I omitted the olives (not a fan) and substituted roasted red peppers, which added a nice color and flavor. I added a bit of olive oil to the meat as I used the leanest turkey. Also added some fresh basil from the garden.  It was very tasty, even my 2yo loved it. No bun needed. Will make again..

Used chicken breast instead of ground turkey. Also used some tatziki, purple onion, and red pepper on top. Sooooo yummy!

Easy recipe & a nice change from regular burgers.  I use a small can of chopped black olives in place of the kalamata olives & it tastes great.  About half of an 6 oz block of feta equals a cup of crumbled feta.  I use the lowfat feta.  Serve with mayo, lettuce & tomato on a whole wheat bun.  Delicious!

Easy and Excellent!   Add a little zesty ranch dressing on top instead of mustard or ketchup

These were unbelievably good!  I used ground chicken instead of turkey since it was cheaper fresh, but they were awesome!  I served them on buns w/ romaine lettuce, slice of tomato and a lil bit of yogurt sauce...will definitely be makin these again.  My mother wanted the recipe!  If you cant find kalamata olives in your store, check with the regular green olives for ones in a jar, they would probably be on the top shelf.

I was a little diappointed.  I love all the ingredients but I think the feta would be better served cold, on top of the burger instead of inside.

I liked this recipe, but I wasn't as impressed as I'd hoped to be. I served them on whole wheat buns wiht tzatziki on both sides. Like I said, good, I'll probably try them again, but there's just not as much flavour as I expected to be with these ingredients.

Oh my gosh!  This recipe was a HUGE hit.  My husband couldn't stop talking about it.  And I was so impressed by the taste (and how easy it was!)  I grilled mine on the George Foreman grill.  I served with red onions.  Mmmmmmmmmm!

This was a really great burger. Flavorful and most of all different from regular recipes. My only complaint is that the burgers didn't stick together well while cooking, resulting in small clods of meat separating from the patties and getting burned in the pan.

Soooo YUMMM!  I don't write reviews often, but this recipe was soooo good, it will replace the beef and lamb burgers I usually serve at cookouts!  My ridiculously picky 3 year old was helping me cook.   As we were mixing the ingredients she said it looked "disgusting".  But, when lunch was served she said "Mama its magic! It went from disgusting to delicious."

Nice flavor that most anyone wold enjoy.  Added 1/4 cup chicken broth, 1/4 tsp pepper & 1/2 tsp salt and reduced kalamata olives somewhat to limit the fat content. Cooked on George Foreman grill for 5 minutes.  Served on toasted bun with homemade tzatziki sauce, spring mix greens & fresh tomatoes.  Welcome change from the traditional burger...would be awesome with a greek salad (tomatoes, feta, fresh basil & oregano, onions & olives).  Definitely worth a try!

So quick and easy! Followed the recipe almost exactly, just added 1 large clove of crushed garlic and some lemon pepper seasoning. I cooked mine in a grill pan over med-high heat for about 4 minutes on each side (I made 5 patties). Served it naked with a side if pierogies. Next time, I'm going to make the meat mixture into meatballs to serve with a Mediterranean pasta dish. Stay tuned!

These were absolutely spectacular! My husband loved them just as much as I did. I used extra lean ground chicken and dried italian seasoning, it was delish! I pan fried them in a little olive oil, and the patties stayed together just fine. I served on top of a soft tortilla and a bed of arugula and spinach. For a topping I made a sauce with 1/2 c plain Greek yogurt, 2 tbsp mayo, 2 tsp dried italian herbs and a shake or 2 of garlic powder. The sauce really complemented the burgers well. I will be making this again!!

These were so good and so easy to make.  I do not make burgers with beef, only with turkey, which sometimes frustrates my husband.  I was suprised that these burgers didn't have any eggs in the recipe and I almost added one to make them stick together, but I didn't.  They actually stayed together really well (I guess because of the oil in the olives) and they were really moist.  I don't give anything 5 stars but this is an exception to that rule.

These were pretty tasty.  I followed the recipe and didnt find that they weretoo  dry.  I did think they were a bit on the bland side, so next time I will add more spices or maybe some sun-dried tomatoes.

Wow! I was really surprised at how just a few ingredients made a plain ole burger into something really memorable. I changed the recipe just a little bit. I used regular ground beef (YUM) and added a few dashes of garlic powder. The last little change was something inspired by my husband's Greek grandmother's meatballs: Using the fine side of the grater, I grated a little bit of onion/onion juice into the meat. Not much -- just a little to perk it up. Super delicious! Thanks for sharing the recipe.

These were great!  I was looking for a way to make turkey burgers more appealing to my red meat-loving boyfriend and I happened to have everything on hand for this recipe.  The only changes I made were that I used ground oregano instead of dried and instead of pitting and slicing the olives, I only added some of the olive juice in.  It gave the burgers the flavor and juiciness without the extra work.    I didn't have pita on hand but I served them with fresh tomato, mixed greens and hummus and they were delish!  Even my boyfriend approved.  Will definitely be making again.  :)

These are delicious!  Many turkey burgers I have made have been dry, tough, just not appealing.  These are very moist - my entire family loves them.  We have them at least several times a month.  Thank you for reinventing the turkey burger!

Made these again recently! Still delish! I used 99% reduced fat ground turkey breast so the only thing I did different was I added a small drizzle of olive oil to the meat mixture. Everything else I kept the same.  I made them into slider size patties and had my husband grill them for me while I prepared the Greek style salad I served these with......................... No Bun Needed!!! These are supremely good and bursting with flavor... I soaked some sun-dried tomatoes (not oil packed) in about 1/4 cup boiling water for about 10 minutes to rehydrate them. The only thing I did different with the burgers was added the liquid (just the liquid) from the tomatoes to the turkey and added a pinch of garlic. I made mini burgers because of how I was serving it.  While I cooked the burgers, I browned some mushrooms and set them aside. I then caramelized a medium onion, sliced. When they were caramelized, I added a pinch of garlic, the rehydrated dried tomatoes, a dash of garlic salt and pepper and allowed it to warm through. I added that hot mixture to a large bowl containing one bunch of fresh spinach and let the heat from that mixture wilt it.  To plate, I added the spinach mixture then topped it with some browned mushrooms. Sprinkled it with just a tiny amount of feta. Placed two mini burgers on top and served it with a spoonful of Garlic Aoili from Jake & Justine on this site.  This was wonderful!!! Low on carbs and healthy! Didn't take long either which is always a plus... Deeee

Wow--these were great.  I was skeptical, at first, since there are not many ingredients.  I did add 5 cloves of garlic crushed and used low fat feta cheese, and they came out like very tasty homemade gyro without the grease!  We topped them with tzatziki sauce (1 cup sour cream, 1 grated cucumber--seeds removed first, 2 minced cloves of garlic, two dashes of dried dill, and juice from a half lemon), lettuce and tomato slices and everyone loved them!  The kalamata olives do not overpower the other ingredients--everything works together perfectly.  This recipe is a definite keeper...thank you!

Although I usually try to make dishes true to the recipe the first time I make them, sometimes it's not possible, or not wise. One of my children doesn't like olives, so instead of putting the olives in the burgers, I pitted and chopped olives for those who like them to put on as a topping. To compensate for omitting the olives in the burgers, I added an egg (to 1 1/2 times the recipe) as I was worried they would be too dry otherwise. The other change I made was to use ground chicken instead of turkey because my grocery store didn't have ground turkey today. Everyone liked them, and they were easy to put together. Thanks!

My husband's favorite burger! I also add some sun dried tomatoes along all other ingredients. Yummy and much healthier than regular burger.

EXCELLENT turkey burger...juicy and full of flavour!  We had our youngest son's 2nd birthday yesterday with our families and I chose to make these along with Spicy Turkey Burgers from this site (which I have made often).  I used a Greek Seasoning instead of just oregano and they were fantastic, a definite keeper!

Yum, yum, yum!!!  This is the best turkey burger I've ever made - even using the lowest fat ground turkey breast.  I did add some chicken broth as others suggested, but other than that I didn't change a thing.

I just made these for dinner tonight and they did not disappoint! Very quick and easy... I followed the ingredients exactly but I added chopped fresh garlic and a splash of italian dressing to mine ( I was worried that the meat would get dry).  I pan fried them in a bit of olive oil and they stayed nice and moist!  Really great flavor..nice way to spice up boring old ground turkey!  I will be making this again!

One of the best turkey burgers I've ever eaten.  I used half a cup of sun-dried tomatoes, as someone else suggested; I also used a roasted pepper and basil feta and Emeril's Italian seasoning (and reduced it to 1.5 teaspoons).  Served on an onion bun with cucumber and red onion slices and homemade tzatziki, with garlicky sweet potato fries, this made an excellent dinner.

These are awesome! I found it interesting that some people had to add egg or breadcrumbs because my patties held together just fine.  The only thing I changed was left out olives (not a fan) and fried them in some olive oil on top of my stove for five minutes on each side.  Easy, filling, and healthy!!

This is great!! Granted I did change it a little based off some reviews I read.  I added 1/3 cup dried oatmeal (instead of breadcrumbs) and 1 egg to hold it together.  I also added some Greek Seasoning with the oregano and about 1 tsp worcestershire sauce. I put it on the george foreman grill for about 15 minutes and they came out perfect!  They werent dry at all!

We tried this the other night.  Unfortunatley the weather was such that we had to "grill" them on the griddle, but they were very tasty regardless.

The feta adds a great greek flavor, but I didn't think the kalamata olives added enough distinct flavor to make it worth the expense.  In the future I think I might use garlic stuffed green olives.  There are other olives with a much more distinct flavor, but in a relatively small midwestern town they aren't readily available.

We served these burgers in pitas and dressed them with a dill and cucumber sauce (Tzatziki).  This recipe is similar http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Greek-Tzatziki/Detail.aspx

This recipe was amazing, I couldn't believe how juicy they came out!  I didn't really follow the measurements I just kid of eye-balled the amount of feta.  and I used Italian seasoned turkey.  They were so quick and easy to make, I will probably try these again, maybe using blue cheese or some other type.

Soooo Yummy. For a lower fat version I used Shadybrook 99% fat free ground turkey and I omitted the olives because of the high sodium and replaced it with dried spinach, I also used fat free feta cheese and they came out outstanding!
Very delicious on a wheat roll with mustand, lettuce, tomatoes etc...any  topping you enjoy! Thanks so much!

Loved these. I am normally not a 'poultry-burger' fan either, but I did enjoy these. I can imagine that they would lack some flavour if you left out any ingredients. Served on great buns with tzatiki sauce,lettuce and tomatoes. Yum.

To me these burgers had almost no taste.  I didn't have any olives though, so that might truly make a difference.

Feta makes everything good! Especially Turkey burgers which are typically bland.  My fiance and I are big on Turkey burgers since we both work - they are quick and healthy so I we we do burgers by regions to make things different. This recipe made "greek night" great. We put them on baby whole wheat pitas with hummus on then and Taboule mixed with greek seasoning, Cucumbers, Tomatoes and Feta on the side. Yummm

Wow!  I just happened to have the ingredients on hand and I made this up quick.  It was so wonderfully good.  The feta must be the trick to keep these so moist.  I also added 1/4 cup of chicken broth as others suggested, parsley, canned black olives (didn't have kalamatta) and crushed red pepper.  Top it with cheese, tomato and lettuce in a pita - thanks!!!

I've been making these a few times a month for the last year.  Fabulous.  If you're cooking for olivephobes just leave them out, they'll still be great.  Sometimes I add a splash of olive oil.

Interesting way to spice up old turkey burgers.  I skipped the olives and black pepper and added 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder and a couple of tablespoons of water to add more juice.  The burgers definitely need to be grilled, not fried.  I fried them, and thought they were way too oily.  Feta cheese alone provided enough fat.   I will also add more garlic next time - I felt they were a little bland.  Overall though, I truly enjoyed it!

These burgers are great!  We serve them with hummus and pita wedges, instead of fries, for a fun Greek dinner.  I never have problems with the turkey being dry.  I do use the 99% fat free, but the brand I use must be a good one for keeping it's moisture.  I very rarely make a recipe without making changes, but this one is perfect just the way it is!

Burgers were still a little bland.  They seemed to be missing something.  I don't like olives, so maybe eliminating those from the recipe changed the flavor drastically.

Even the kids ate these! I used feta seasoned with sundried tomatoes and basil, and skipped the kalamata olives.  No problem with dryness, maybe because my ground turkey was 15% fat, not extra-lean.

My husband thinks this is the greatest recipe I have tried yet!  He never eats just one, and we have them at least three times a month.

I have reviewed this recipe before but everytime I make them my family can't rave enough. I tried frying them and they were just ok but off the BBQ they are superb. We don't eat regular hamburgers anymore unless we go out to eat. My toddleer and picky 4 yr old both love them.

I have to admit; I has hesitant about this one.  It sounded odd.  But i loved it! !

I struggled with what to put on it (I made it hamburger style)...I don't eat ketchup with turkey but I do with a burger.  I ended up with mayo, lettuce and tomato.

Next time I am going to crumble the turkey and place in a pita with a greek dressing.  yummmm! !

I made this exactly to the recipe and grilled them on a grilling mat.  They were juicy and very tasty.  Of course, I love feta cheese and kalamata olives.  Fantastic!

Tried to do this in a pan on the stove, probably much better on the grill. One change I did do was I used lettuce instead of a roll. It turned out AMAZING!!

These burgers are VERY good! They were much more moist than I expected. I only gave 4 stars because I needed to add a tablespoon or 2 of breadcrumbs to held it together.  I also omitted the olives and added 2 tablespoons of Pesto to the mix...so incredibly delicious! WIll absolutely make again!

I can't rate this anything other than a 5 because I didn't really follow this recipe, I just used it for inspiration, and that wouldn't be fair to the poster. 
That said, I combined ground turkey, fat free feta, italian seasoning, salt, pepper, sauteed onions and garlic, and chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. I grilled the burgers and served them with thin sliced onion, tomato, more feta cheese, spinach leaves, and raspberry chipotle sauce. I don't even like turkey, I'm a red meat man, and these things were amazing!  I was looking for some healthy options that actually tasted good and this nailed it! So, again, my thanks to the poster for the inspiration.

Really good with the addition of the recommended broth. I used olive tapenade and a touch of crushed rosemary in addition to the oregano. The other reviewer was right - no bun needed.

These were fantastic! I used lean ground turkey and jumbo black olives, from a can I sliced, that worked fine. The 1 cup of feta ended up being near a 6 oz package. I used leveled spoons of the oregano and just a couple lite sprinkles of black pepper. I shaped the patties using a mashed potato scoop and got 7. I decided to cook them in the house in a pan sprayed with olive oil, but they didn't seem to be getting as brown as I liked. So, I lined a sheet with foil and finished them under the broiler for 2 minutes on each side. That made them perfect. I ate on a wheat but with a little lite mayo, leaf lettuce, sliced tomatoe and onion. I wish feta cheese hadn't gotten so expensive. This makes a great lunch!

I can't believe how simple this recipe is, and how delicious! Holy cow...seriously one of the best burgers I've ever eaten.  I sort of expected them to be pale & dry but they were neither. Moist, delicious, & flavorful.  I even used reduced fat feta. My husband wasn't enthused when I told him what I was fixing for dinner, but he was singing a different tune after he ate! Making these again really soon, thanks for an awesome recipe!

We followed this recipe as written and they were the best turkey burgers I have ever had.  They weren't dry at all.  We ate them with Tzatziki on a bun and a slice of onion.  It didn't need anything else.  Definitely a summer keeper!!

My whole family loved this!  I used the turkey package that had about 1 1/2 lbs. of meat, and it turned out juicy and tasty.  I also used only 6 oz. of feta, but that was because it was the size of the package.  I will add garlic next time, as per some reviewer's suggestion - we love garlic, but really it was tasty without it.  Simple and good!  We haven't served it in a bun yet - we serve with brown rice and a green veggie.

I absolutly loved these, made 4 patties, used only 1/4 c basil tomato feta cheese, and chopped a little onion, and black olives, used chicken broth to simmer in, and these were wonderful.  Froze leftovers for lunches.  Think I will leave olives and add mushrooms next time, for more healthly meal.

These are absolutely great. I made these tonight. Like a prior reviewer, I added garlic to the mix. I placed all the ingredients in a large zip loc bag and smushed it all together and let it sit for a couple of hours in the fridge. Patties were great with a little Frank's Red Hot on a whole wheat pita. Spinach, roasted red peppers, it's all good! Excellent warmed up, too for a quick lunch.

These a great turkey burgers without the traditional worcestershire sauce.  Thought they were a little dry but I'm sure that's easily remedied.  Used capers to add salt because I didn't have the olives.  The oregano was just right and if you're dieting the feta is a wonderful addition to what could be a bland meal.  This is a keeper.

Delish. I normally don't think hubby would be thrilled about the olives, but he wasn't aware of what was in there and I got rave reviews. Thanks !

Loved these, a great twist on the run of the mill hamburger.  Used black olives from the can and pan fried in a little bit of healthy fat.  As suggested put them in pita with lettuce, tomato & onion which really added to the flavor.  Husband loved as well.

Deeelicious!! I didn't need any chicken broth or anything, and they didn't seem too dry to me! I personally don't like ground beef, so my husband and I have been trying to find a "burger" alternative, and I think these have made the list! The only change I was thinking about was chopping the olives smaller so they mixed in better. Apparently we lost some whilst bbqing. But all in all, delicious!

These burgers were hands down THE BEST burgers I've ever made. As suggested by other users, I added 1/4 cup chicken stock. It made the turkey so juicy. What a great low cal recipe! Will be making again very soon. DE-LISH!

My kids loved this! Definitely a keeper, the olives and cheese provided enough salt so I didn't add any. Will be making these instead of plain ol' turkey burgers.

I reallllly like these burgers. That being said, I couldn't necessarily follow the recipe exactly because it's the middle of winter and I don't have a grill so I used my stove. Along with the feta (I used garden herb) and olives, I added some minced garlic and onions with some egg whites to help hold it together. They came out well, but since I'm super paranoid about under-cooking poultry (I'm a novice in the kitchen) they were pretty dry. The flavor definitely was delicious though and I will be making these often in the future. 

Oh and seriously add the egg whites. These burgers weren't as crumbly as some others that I've had.

If there was an option for more stars, I would have used them! These were THE BEST turkey burgers I have ever had in my entire life. It was quick and easy to make and my husband even liked them and he hates turkey burgers! He wants them again. I took the advice of another reviewer and used a Tzatziki sauce and put it all in a pita pocket with some fresh cucumber slices and it was awesome! I WILL be making this again! Thank you for a great recipe!

These were so good! I didn't have kalamata olives, so I used Trader Joe's Olive Tapenade Spread instead - it worked great! I served them on quartered pita bread in leu of buns. Sublime!

LOVED THESE!   I used chicken breasts, pulsing quickly in the food processor, then added all the other ingredients plus about 1/4 c chicken broth.  Next time I'm tripling the recipe because I made 1 1/2 lbs this time and only got one burger and there are only 3 of us!  I was looking forward to having one for lunch tomorrow but that's not going to happen.  Poor me!  I think I'll go back to the store tomorrow.  These would make sensational meatballs for soup...mmmmmmm!  Thank you Lol!

I didn't follow this recipe exactly, I just copied the idea and improvised a little.  I left out the olives because they are a little strong for my kids' pallates and I added some chicken stock and a little bit of olive oil to the mixture.  I served it with some home made tzatziki and it was fantastic.  A great idea that I will make again and again.

Good golly Miss Molly!  These were so delicious.  I used 50/50 dark and light ground turkey, olives I had on hand, and I don't know how much feta cheese (I know it was less than a cup).  I also added a teaspoon of bottled minced garlic and salt and pepper.  I just made them for lunch, and I am fighting the urge for seconds.  I also just fried them in a pan with cooking spray, absolutely lovely recipe!!

Wow! My fiance and I had these for the first time tonight. We ground up the olives in the food processor before mixing with the turkey. Then we cooked them on the George Foreman for about 6 minutes per patty. Amazing! We'll definitely be making these again.

Added a clove of crushed garlic, fresh chopped onion, an egg and 1/4 bread crumbs. Then, because I didn't want to fool around with burgers formed it into a roll and made a meat loaf - baked for 45 minutes.  Really, really good!  Next time I'm making tzatziki sauce to go with!

Wow! I knew this would be good but I had no idea how good!  I intended on only eating half but it was too delicious and tasty I ate a full serving.  I followed the recipe exactly and followed some of the advice given by others.  I made sure the olives were chopped small so the burger did not fall apart.  I live in the NorthEast so it was a little cold for grilling.  I cooked them on the stovetop at medium high heat 5-6 minutes on each side and added the Tsatziki (sp?) sauce which was also recommended.  Also put the burger in a pita pocket and topped with fresh spinach and tomato.  Perfect!

Definitely will make this again! I had to improvise as I didn't have all the ingredients. I mixed 4 oz. container of feta cheese to 1.25 lb. of grnd turkey, 1/4 cup shredded parmesan cheese, 1 tablespoon minced garlic, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, oregano and about 1/4 C water. let sit for about an hour and then made into paddies.  We ate these with the sweet potato sticks - simply delicious!

Very nice turkey burgers.  Bf liked them, although I didn't put olives in his burger.  I put the olives in mine and mine fell apart--I think it's bc I didn't chop the olives.  We'll make again, but I think next time I'll mix everything in the food processor (for me anyway--with the olives!) so the olives are more chopped.  I belive that will help with the crumbling--it really only was falling apart where the bigger pieces of olives were.  I really like the flavor and bf was happy with it too.  thanks for the recipe!

I love this recipe.  I have made these burgers twice and both times, they were great and not dry at all!  The only change I make is to use about 1 TBSP of Greek seasoning (onion, garlic, oregano, mint) instead of plain oregano.  Thanks for a great meal!

This recipe was outstanding! The combo of oregano and feta was excellent. I made them for my 1 1/2 year old twins and they loved them too! :-) Definitely a keeper.

These were delicious -- the feta made the burgers really juicy and delicious. My only edit was that instead of putting the salt and pepper in the burger mix, I sprinkled salt and pepper on the top and bottom of the burgers before putting them on the grill. This way, the burgers were a little crispy on the outside and melty on the inside. Yum!

Burger was OK - the olive taste was a little overpowering for me (and I love olives) and the burger was still dry.  Adding tomato and roasted red pepper to top the burger really helped with the dryness.

These are awesome, made with these revisions...I use ground chicken, not ground turkey, they're even better with ground chicken.  Also, I use feta with mediterranean herbs, so the olives aren't even necessary.  Definitely cook them in a skillet, though, they stay together better! :D

These are a staple in our house. So easy and fast to put together. This is my 2 year old's favorite meal. We make mini hamburgers and throw them into a green salad - so yummy!  Using semi defrosted turkey also helps to keep them together on the skillet. I also never measure so I just throw in as much olives and feta as we like!

My husband, who is a little indifferent to all the ingredients, LOVED this burger. We served on a pita as recommended. I had kal. olive tempanade on hand, so my prep was even easier. Will be passing this recipe along to friends and repeating often!

Delicious! I used lean ground turkey breast and low fat feta. I also added a clove of fresh garlic and salt to the recipe. I've made them several times and they're always a big hit even with non olive lovers.

This was pretty good!  I substituted "greek seasoning" for the oregano and pepper - and used the chicken broth as other reviewers suggested.  I will make again.

Yum - I made these with the regular ground turkey, feta, oregano, minced garlic and a splash or two of worchester.  I used a whole wheat bun and topped mine with some tomatoes and guacamole.  I left the olives out just because I didn't have any and grilled them along with my sweet potato fries.  I'll definately have this again.

Superb recipe, I did adjust it to suit our tastes by sauteeing a half small onion with a few chopped mushrooms and a large clove of garlic in EVOO to add moisture and flavor. I served the burgers on whole wheat buns with a microlayer of FF mayo and fresh spinach leaves. Next time I will make a Tzaziki sauce to serve with them. This recipe will definately make it into our regular rotation. Yummo!

Good and easy, but it could use a bit more flaver.  Will make again and add a splash of worcestershire and use a tzaziki sauce as others have suggested.

Excellent way to dress up a turkey burger! I followed the recipe exactly as it's written and I wouldn't change a thing next time. I served mine 'bun-less' with spring mix salad greens on the side. I also made a yogurt-based dill & cucumber greek dressing to spread on each burger. Will make these apart of my 'routine' meals!

The best turkey burgers I have ever had. Like others I added a bit of bread crumbs and an egg. This made the burgers nice and moist, and the feta and olives flavor combination is absolutely delicious.  I'd also recommend trying them in a pita with some tzatziki sauce.

We grilled these. They were really good! I am not a huge fan of Oregano but it didn't overwhelm, just perfectly complimented the ground turkey. Hubby doesn't like olives so I used only 2 Tbsp. Plus a Tbsp. of Olive oil, They could've had a little more fat content but they had a great taste. Because we cooked them on the grill, they probably lost a lot of oil that way. They were hard to keep together but they looked great when done. Also added red pepper from the garden and topped with Jarlsburg cheese & red onion. Did not eat with Pita. Yum, Very good!

These are the best ever. Have made them several times over the summer. I use regular sliced black olives as that is what is available around here.  Still they taste great.  After making up the patties I freeze them and when ready to BBQ put them on the grill frozen.  They stay together beautifully and come off the grill moist on the inside and well grilled on the outside.  Last time we cooked them over an open campfire. The added smokey flavor was to die for.  Thanks for a great recipe.

These are absolutely awesome.  I followed the recipe exactly, only subbing black olives for kalamata, because that's what I had in the house.  The amount of oregano is perfect, IMO. I was VERY leary of not putting any salt in, but I went ahead and left it out, and they were just perfect, so flavorful!

This recipe was absolutely fantastic! I loved every last bite of my burger, and so did my guests.  We ended up using black olives, 1 tsp. worcheshire, and 1/4 cup minced onion, in addition to everything in the recipe.  I dressed them with lettuce, tomatoe and a pesto mayonnaise spread. They were fantastic and we had no problem with them being too dry or not sticking together.  I think the key is using 93% lean ground turkey, rather than the 99% lean variety.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.  I'll definitely be making these again!

What a terrific spin on regular old turkey burgers! I I recommend adding some breadcrumbs and some worchestershire, it adds extra oomph to these tasty burgers. Oh and I tried using flavored feta (sun-dried tomato and basil) and it was phenomenal.

This recipe is really great - I make it at least once a month for my boyfriend and I.  I always use black olives and also add in finely chopped onions which adds great flavor and texture.  And, if you cook these on a George Foreman grill, you see a lot of the fat from the meat and cheese drip right out!

These were pretty good.  I was a little nervous about the taste, but I ended up liking it, as did my husband and one of my kids.  They have a strong oregano taste, so if you don't like oregano you may want to cut back some.  I made quite a few of these and froze them for future dinners.  They defrost and cook up wonderfully, no problems at all.

I am normally not a turkey burger fan, but I decided to try these. I am so glad that I did these are awesome. We loved them. I followed the recipe just omitting the olives (boyfriend hates olives). This is a keeper I will be making them again. Thank you for the recipe.

Really good! Followed the recipe without any additions. Didn't need any. I suppose if you want it to taste like beef, you could add soy sauce or worcester, but we didn't find it necessary. My husband and I paired with sweet potato fries. Mmm!

I've tried several turkey burger recipes from allrecipes, and this was definitely one of the best.  I left out the oregano and pepper, but used seasoned feta instead of plain.

We really enjoyed this burger.  I didn't use olives since I didn't have any.  My burgers were fairly delicate on the grill, but they held together...barely!  I served them on Whole wheat sourdough rolls.  Some people added bbq sauce and others added mustard, mayo or ketchup.  Everyone liked them, including those who said the "don't like turkey burgers".  Thanks for the simple recipe.

I thought this was just okay.  I'm not a fan of olives, though, and those made some bites a bit weird, even though I halved the amount included.  My husband loved them though, but he's not a picky eater.

The burgers are quite hard to hold together. Once you get them in the pan though, they cook up nicely. I used crumbled garlic herb feta and omitted the olives - perfect for me. The feta crumbles on the outside get nice and toasted - I really loved this idea. Thanks for sharing :)

Easy and Delicius...
I bought a mix of various types of pitted olives from my grocery store olive bar including some hot ones. Used italian seasoning in place of only oregano and added garlic powder. YUMMY. Served on toasted hero rolls with mesculin mix and tomato.  I did not have any problems with the burgers staying together. Grilled for about 5 minutes per side. I rated it a 4 of 5. My husband gives it a 3.5 out of 5. I needed a side dish...should have made sweet potato fries.

Being somewhat health conscious I make these as often as I make our Portuguese Burgers. A good blend of flavors that just need a little more kick. I like to add some minced garlic and a tad of steak sauce to them. Overall a great recipe! Thanks for sharing.

Delicious!  We don't care for olives, so we left those out.  This now is our go to recipe for turkey burgers.  

Next time we plan to try them with a little tzatziki sauce on the side.

These were amazing, super easy to make, and the flavour was great, my beef loving husband had seconds.  The only thing I changed was no olives, I don't like them and too expensive, and added 1tbsp of greek spice and some salt.  Delicious and easy you won't be sorry to try this recipe, thanks

We LOVE this recipe! We've had cravings for this recipe. I cannot believe it took me so long to rate it! These burgers are great on the grill and even better the next day! Believe it or not it's good with ground beef too.(just incase you have to pinch pennies) ;)

These were just ok. I used a heaping teaspoon (rather than 2)of oregano. All I could really taste was the oregano in them. Next time I will use less. I used sun-dried tomato and basil feta cheese. I served with home-made steak fries, broccoli salad and baked beans.

MMMMMMMMMMmmm delicious.. these burgers will be hitting my grill many times this summer.  I didn't add olives, and added about a 1/4 cup of italian bread crumbs and garlic/herb seasoning instead of oregano.  Made 3 HUGE burgers.

Wow!  This was much better than I even thought it would be.  We all loved it.  I served with pita bread and no other condiments were needed.  Very flavorful!
I made this for guests many times.  Everyone's favorite including the children.

I thought this was pretty good. Still need to experiment with what to put
on the bun because it seemed like it needed something tangy. 
Took longer than 10 minutes to cook.

This recipe really jazzes up regular turkey burgers.  Make sure you use kalamata olives and a good feta to ensure it has that "bite" that makes it so good.  Serve w/greek salad and be creative with the buns.

I'm not a big fan of oregano but I can't believe what it did to our usually bland turkey burgers.  Combined with feta and black olives (since we didn't have kalamata), the burgers were excellent.  I used extra lean ground turkey and they were still wonderfully moist.  I am anxious to try the recipie with kalamata olives next time!

The turkey burgers were brilliant!  I'm not a huge olive fan, but I put them in anyway and the flavour was excellent.  I mistakenly seasoned with salt and pepper when I only needed the pepper, due to the salty feta and olives.  On one side of the bun, I spread hoummus and on the other I used tzatziki.  This turned into a heavenly Greek creation!  Not only was this an incredibly quick and easy meal for during the week, but I would definately serve these burgers to company!!  Thank you... a new staple in my home.

This is a new favorite for my family.  It's very quick and easy to make.  Mix in a 4 oz container of flavored crumbled feta to the ground turkey.  We like the tomato basil flavor.  We don't use the olives or oregano.  Form your patties and season with a little pepper, and that's it.  I fry them up in a cast iron pan.  What really makes it special is using roasted red peppers and baby spinach for your toppings, instead of tomato and lettuce.  Really good!

I made this exactly per the recipe. My husband and I both love turkey burgers, kalamata olives, feta cheese, and pretty much all greek food, but this burger was not a big hit with us. We had them on a fresh burger bun with lettuce and tomato and just weren't wowed. We think it would be best served alone with rice or something else. These turned out to be nice and moist as well so not sure why others had issue with dryness.

Very very tasty... But I made a taste change right at the start. Instead of oregano, I used Turkish Seasoning from Penzey's Spices. I also made a yogurt sauce of plain yogurt and a little of the Turkish mix. I discovered that the feta in the turkey mix starts to burn before the turkey was done, so I plan to play with perhaps adding less to the turkey mix and putting some on top, like a cheeseburger. Will definitely keep this in the mix of meals

To this recipe, I add 1 tsp lemon zest, 1/2 cup chopped fresh baby spinach, and 1/4 cup chopped red onion. The result is fabulous. I serve with a tomato slice and store-bought tzatziki sauce (Cedar's) on flatouts or small wheat pitas.

Best turkey burger I ever ate. We don't eat beef or pork and truthfully turkey burgers can be a little bland. Not these babies. Moist, juicy, and full of flavor.

These turkey burgers were great! This is my second time with this recipe. I modified slightly by adding a tablespoon of olive oil to the recipe, cutting the feta by half, and serving with baby spinach, olive oil mayo, and roasted red peppers on ciabatta bread.

Love these burgers.  Make them all the time.  Top them with jalapeño cheese and they are outstanding.  The family loves them.  I always double the recipe and everyone has one the next day for lunch.  Kids take them to school for their lunch and are very happy.

Delicious!  I did make some changes.  I added 1 tsp each onion powder, garlic powder.  Reduced oregano to 1 tsp.  I also added finely chopped onion, 1 jalapeño seeded.  You really can't taste the jalapeño, I was just trying to clean out the fridge!  I added 3 tbsp yogurt to add moisture, and I'm glad I did.  It was very moist.   I liked these more than the chipotle turkey burgers on this site.

These were delicious!!!  I read a lot of the reviews.  I followed the recipe exactly but the additions I made were 1 tsp of mediterranean  seasoning,  a bit of olive oil infused with garlic and 2 tsp. of Balsamic Vinegar.  I also cooked them on top of the stove and it took @ 10-12 minutes.  I served them with a recipe I found on this sight : 1/2 cup of greek non fat yogurt, 2 TBS mayo, 2 tsp. dried Italian seasonng, garlic powder and some fresh lemon juice.  This recipe made 5 burgers.  They were very moist and not dry.  I did mix it up and let it sit in the fridge for @ 45 minutes and then made into patties.  Delicious!!  This is a keeper.

We all liked it. The flavor is very light. It was delightful to eat, and it was delicious. We would definitely recommend it.

These are the best turkey burgers I've ever made! My family loved them!! I'll make them often! I didn't have any problem with dryness & did use the advice to put them in the freezer while the grill is heating up. I also made them a day ahead of time which might have helped, not sure. Thanks for sharing this receive!

So easy and delicious!  Made one "plain" burger for the son who wouldn't eat feta or fancy olives.  Will definitely make again!

2/27/16 - made again, as good, if not better!  We had leftover burgers the day after for dinner and were delicious!  Easy to customize per the kids in the house (no olives, no feta or olives), etc.  Per other reviewers, added some Greek seasoning!  Fantastic!

These burgers are awesome!! We usually get more like 6-8 burgers, rather than 4. I use regular black olives instead of kalamata's, only because I usually have them. They really don't need any more  seasoning than what is called for, but we like garlic or onion in them sometimes. Wonderful family favorite. Thanks so much for the recipe!!

I was surprised at how juicy and flavorful these burgers were!  I followed the recipe, except I used a regular hamburger bun and added a bit of red onion and a little Best Foods as a garnish.  We cooked these on our indoor grill, the Cuisinart Griddler and they came out great.  My husband also loved them.  I am now thinking of spin-offs (blue cheese and garlic, etc.)  Thanks for this great recipe!

Absolutely fabulous.  Incredible.  If you like these types of ingredients/flavors, you will love it.  The turkey is "neutral" enough (but still healthy) that the spices and cheese just pop.  Will make it again and again.

There is no doubt this is a 5 star recipe!  Before I tried this recipie I have not had a turkey burger that I actually would want to eat again. This I will definately make again!  I followed the recipie exactly. I put it on a toasted hamburger bun and put a little mayo and tomatoe on top... Wow. Next I am going to try to eat it with tzatziki sauce.  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent recipe!! Had no trouble with these burgers being too dry. Prepared them in a grill pan over medium-high heat and was sure to remove the burgers after exactly 12 minutes. Added a little of the olive juice to the mixture. And used feta cheese with basil/tomato spices.

OMG, this was outrageously, to-die-for good, and so EASY! I'll be making these again, for sure. I used Mediterranean Herb Feta, and ordinary black olives, because I forgot I needed Kalamatas, and no stock added. These were juicy enough, done according to the recipe. The whole family loved this, not just me!

This is a great twist on burgers.  I'm not a fan of ground turkey meat.  I generally find it dry and lacking flavor, but with this recipe, I'll often choice these over your more traditional beef burger.  And at cookouts, these are always sure to go as fast as the "regular".

Great!  My family won't touch black olives so I just added some olive oil to the mixture.  It was DELICIOUS!  My kids actually ate it (they won't eat regular hamburgers), and my red-meat-lovin' hubby even asked for me to make it again!  Thanks for a tasty, easy recipe!

Yummy!  My husband does not believe in turkey burgers, but, he liked these!  Yay!  I loved the tang imparted by the olives and feta, which also helped to cut the dryness.

My roommate and I made these into meatballs instead of burgers and they were delicious! We didn't have olives but they would have made them even better.  We put them on top of a salad with sundried tomatoes and a drizzle of balsamic and it was a great meal.  Two small meatballs provided just the right amount of meat.

The flavor of these is lovely. I followed the recipe, except using fresh oregano from the garden rather than dried. My burgers fell apart some, but not enough to really matter. We stuffed them into pita pockets, topped with "Yia Yia's Tzatziki Sauce", lettuce and tomato. Delish. Definitely a keeper.

these burgers were good but serve them with the following ingredients might make them better: Instead of bun; use pita pockets.  Add red leaf lettuce, a greek cucumber sauce as a garnish (same as used in gyros), and sauteed onions makes it a five star restaurant burger.

This is a great recipe, and a terrific alternative to regular beef burgers.  I added a 1/2 cup chopped roasted red peppers and 2 teaspoons fresh/minced garlic and it is to die for!  I'm on a low carb diet so I eat the burger on a bed of mixed greens - yum!

I cooked these burgers last night, and they were lovely. The nicest Turkey burger I've ever made. The only problem I had is that they fall to pieces easily. If you are careful with them and only turn them once, you should be fine. I'm definitely making them again. Three out of four of my children ate them, that's good in my house.

We enjoyed it.  Kept the recipe exactly as written and served on pita bread, w/ romaine lettuce, and tomato.  Went ahead and squished some avocado b/c Pita bread is dry and ketchup or mustard would NEVER go.  It was really good.  Hubby wants to try them w/ hummus next time.  I guess dinner is a hit when the hubby is already making plans for the next time :)

Very good!! I didn't have the olives so i added a little garlic powder.  We ate them on pita with gyro sauce.  My wife is picky and she loved them.

Excellent, simple recipe! The blue cheese was a bit strong for us; added some minced red onion and fresh garlic to next batch, and it was superb. Thanks for sharing!

This was so tasty! I added chopped onions, dried sage and used black olives (chopped) instead of the kalamata olives. Cooked on the grill 6 min. each side and it was fabo to the taste buds.No dryness at all.

These are excellent! I used 1/2 the amount of olives called for, 1/3 pd more ground turkey, and the full 1 cup of Feta.   Definitely making these again.

I LOVED this recipe. Very easy and very yummy. It was too cold outside to use the grill, so I fried in a pan with a little spray oil. Unfortunately, they stuck a little, so next time I will use olive oil and more of it. I love kalamata olives and thought it was a delicious addition, but my boyfriend (who also loves kalamata olives, too) wants to try it without the olives next time. And there WILL be a next time. Tonight, as a matter of fact!

These had really great flavor.  They were slightly dry when I tasted them plain but we put them in pitas with the tzatziki sauce 1(adding cukes) from this site and it was all better!!  Thank you so much for a new recipe to add to my rotation!

Just made these and they were good, but I am not sure if I like turkey burgers...I keep trying to like them but I may have to give up. I agree that it definitely needs a gyro sauce and some onion. The recipe is a great one but next time I will be using beef..gosh I really wanted a healthy alternative...oh well I guess I will have to practice portion control! :)

These were absolutely delicious! I'm not a fan of olives, so we did not include them. However, we did make some other additions. We added a little bit of chicken broth (made them very juicy!) and a bit of garlic. We topped our burgers with feta, tzakziki sauce, cucumbers and onions. We now make these once a week. They are fantastic!!!

i really wanted to try these, but I m not that fond of olives.  I chopped up mushrooms very fine and put them in.  They were a good substitute, and they gave  great flavor.  I also chopped up a bit of onion very fine and added it to the mix.  It was really well worth it, it kept the meat a bit more moist.

My family really loved these.  I had to make them without the olives since my kids don't like them, but they were still very good and no one complained about them being too dry.   Next time I'll try them with garlic like others have done, but even without these are very tasty and pleased my 5 very different eaters.

We made these tonight and thought they were very good.  I was worried that the flavor would be overpowering but it wasn't at all.  We cooked the burgers in a pan as opposed to the grill.  We cook alot of turkey burgers and they are more moist when cooked in a skillet.  Would make again.

I really liked these.  We took them to a bbq and others wanted to try them as well!  I especially liked the bites of feta in there.  We changed two things: 1) we added an egg for binding and moisture (as others had said they were dry) and 2) we added about 1/2 a large white onion.  We ate them just like "regular" burgers with lettuce, tomato (from our garden!), and onion all on a bun.

Very good.  I was hesitant about using the olives, but they weren't overpowering at all.  I think next time I'll add more feta and olives.  I did add an 1 egg and 1/3 c. bread crumbs.

We really liked this!  I added three cloves of garlic, some onion powder & pepper, and cooked in a pan with some olive oil for 6 minutes each side.  Topped with more feta, some baby leaf spinach, and served on a whole wheat kaiser roll with fresh corn on the side.  Tasty!

We followed the receipe exactly and added a little soy and Worcestershire Sauce for flavor and appearance. The burgers were better than advertised. We didn't need the pita and instead served sweet potato french fries. The meal was great.

Bland.  The first batch I made and cooked as recommended.  The second batch I made and let the ingredients marinate overnight but I didn't notice a difference.  Again, BLAND!  Not terrible but I won't make again.

these were pretty good... the olives & feta definitely help boring ground turkey, but I think it could use even more doctoring... like beef! kidding.

We loved this! Thanks to the reviews I was careful to not overcook them and they were very moist and the flavor was great. Even our six year old who turned up her nose at them ended up liking them! We added a slice of tomato and some lettuce and they didn't need anything else!

Thought we would try something different for supper and I had all the ingredients.  The kids would not even finish their burgers as they insisted they had a weird after taste due to the feta cheese. Hubby thought they were just okay.

I thought this was a nice change of pace from regular old burgers...it was a little on the expensive side tho...$4 for the Feta which I bought Athenos Feta with lemon, garlic, and oregon.  $1 for a small can of regular olives, Kalamta were $7. Good burgers!

I really like these, and so does my roommate who doesn't like anything.  We're not big bread eaters, so had a nice fresh green salad with Italian vinegrette - mmm!  Flavorful & healthy, right up my alley!  Thanks for sharing.

One of our favorite grilled "burgers." Like another reviewer, we substitute sun-dried tomatoes in olive oil (3/4 cup) for the olives.  These are delicious served on naan bread with cucumber sauce (from Costco's).

This is simply delicious!  I did add an egg white with a bit of yolk, cut the oregano in 1/2 and used low fat feta.  It was moist and savory.  I served it with some marinated grilled vegetables.  The mushrooms went especially well with it! This will becomes a regular for sure.

These were incredible, my boyfriend doesn't like turkey burgers, but he actually asked me to make these again.  They were so good they don't need a bun or anything extra!  I paired them with steamed artichokes and fried sweet potatoes!

These burgers are unique & delicious.  So much flavor to savor.  I couldn't find calamata olives at our grocery so I used greek olives that are similar with great results.  If you are wanting to try something new, with lots of interesting tastes-TRY THESE.

A cool alternative to regular hamburgers! I followed the recipe exactly. Slicing an pitting the olives took a bit of time but well worth it! I also purchased rolls from the bakery department instead of burger buns. Will make this again. Anyone have a good yogurt sauce to go with this?

These were just okay.  I think we needed to use more feta, because I could hardly taste it, although we did use a wholel container of feta.  it was fun to eat with a pita and hummus though.

if you buy the more finely ground turkey, these turn out fantastic.
Spray with Pam before setting on the grill and they come out much more moist and juicy!

A large improvement over the flavorless plain ground turkey burgers.  Next time I will add even more feta cheese.

We loved this recipe!  The turkey was so moist and flavorfull.  I had to hide the 2 that were left over so my husband wouldn't eat them!  I wouldn't change a thing.  I might try all white meat next time with a little chicken broth as some suggested.

These turkey burgers were very tasty and juicy! I don't usually eat feta cheese and I thought the recipe called for too much of it, but it turned out great.  I will be making this recipe again

We loved this recipe!!  Had to substitute a small can of sliced black olives.  First turkey burger we've had that wasn't dry.

All I can say is DELICIOUS! I actually didn't even know a recipe like this existed so I made up my own concoction on my turkey burger the other night...Using Jennie-O's frozen turkey burgers, any type of wheat bread with KENS caesar salad dressing spread on the bread, tomato and basil feta cheese, topped with a tomato slice & avocado...then dip the burger in the caesar dressing...IT'S THE BEST!

These weren't too bad.  Husband and 6-year old son liked them.   A switch from regular burgers.  I may have added more olives than I should have (1 cup).   Will probably make again some time.

This is a great barbeque alternative, fast and easy to make, and it tastes great!  Even without the olives.

Just something about them sounded so good, but again, it was missing something of a kick.  Might try again but add some "spicy" stuff to it.

Wow, I think I died and gone to heaven.  These burgers are great. Didn't use any condiments with these burgers as the olives, cheese and oregano complimented each other nicely with a rich full flavor. Definitely will be making again and again. YUM

I love Feta cheese and Turkey Burger so this was a real treat!  I will make them like this from now on! *****modification
Get a can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce and take one pepper and a little sauce out and add it to about 1/4 mayo.
Chop up the pepper and mix with the mayo and sauce, it will store in the fridge as long as mayo will.  this may goes great on this burger!
Really tastes good on the turkey burger.
