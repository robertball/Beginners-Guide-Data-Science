We just had this pie for Thanksgiving.  It tasted incredible and was incredibly easy to make.  Two other pies were made, Grandma's famous apple pie from scratch, and Aunt Wendy's cherry pie.  Let me just say that this Caramel-Pecan Pie was the first one gone!

I made a sugar-free version for diabete grandparents- IT WAS GREAT!! I used sugar-free caramel topping and stevia in place of sugar. It tasted like a GREAT pecan pie!! You couldn't even tell it was sugar-free!! Yummmmm!! Super easy, and tasty!

We really enjoyed this pie. I used a bit more of everything since I was using a deep dish pie plate. I also used refrigerated pie crust to make it easier.

I made this pie years ago and never forgot it. The caramel gives it the perfect sweetness.

As far as pecan pie goes...it was okay. I wasn't blown away by it like I was hoping I'd be. Good.

This pie tastes great! So why only three stars? The pieces stick to the pie dish---I think the caramel got soaked up by the crust. So it was very difficult to serve pieces of pie. They were a mess on the plates!

I made this pie for a Christmas potluck and it was the hit of the dessert table.  There were seven other competing desserts, but this one was the first one gone.  A few people even came back for seconds.    It was also one of the easiest pecan pie recipes I have ever made, with minimal prep time.

Made this last night for a few friends I had over for dinner. Fantastic!!! I couldn't find the caramel flavor so I used butterscotch instead...delicious! I will definitely be making this again! Thanks for the recipe!

Amazing pie! I make it every year and people love it. VERY rich though.
