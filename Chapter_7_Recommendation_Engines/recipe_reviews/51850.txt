Hi all...I am the submitter of this recipe. I just want to share a few tips, all veggies should be diced very fine. Before you fold in the crab meat, if the veggie/binding mixture is too loose, add a little more bread crumbs, if it is too dry (which may result in the cakes not sticking together), and a little more mayo. After all the cakes are made, I lightly pat more crumbs on all sides. Yes, I do fry them, but not in that much oil as stated here. I have never broiled them, but I'm sure they are just as good. I hope this helps, and enjoy!

this is a great recipe, with one exception.  i think it is always best to saute' your main veges (onions, peppers, garlic, etc.) before incorporating them into the main dish.  afterall, the heat of sweating the veges is what brings out the maximum flavor in them. i did add the garlic, which i do to almost all seafood dishes.

These were great! My boyfriend has been wanting to make homemade crab cakes for a while now, so we decided to do so for a recent potluck holiday party here in New England. We followed the recipe as directed, and only changed a few things, mostly from what we liked in other crab cakes. We used real crab from the seafood section of our grocery store (16 oz.) instead of the 3 cans. We decided to use crushed Ritz crackers in the mix instead of bread crumbs (though we still coated them with breadcrumbs). Also, we omitted the  bell peppers and decided to chop up onion and celery and saute them in a little butter instead (we had wonderful crab cakes on the coast once like that so we had to add it in!). Lastly, since it was finger food at a potluck, we formed cakes about the width of half-dollars which turned out great. We ended up baking them (at 375) since they were difficult to turn over, and that worked out fine. Rave reviews at the party!!!

I have tried many crab cake recipes and never found one I wanted to make again until now!  These were excellent. Even my husband agrees (which is amazing!).  I followed the recipe pretty much exactly (except for adding one extra egg white and using less oil to fry in).  I put the cakes in the freezer for about 15 minutes before frying and had no problem at all with them falling apart.  I am going to try broiling them next time and see how they compare with the fried.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is by far one of the best crab cake recipes I've tried. I make it for all family holidays in bite sized appetizers. I like to use panko breadcrumbs rather than regular for the outside crumbs (I use regular breadcrumbs in the actual crabcake mix). When I make them bite size I also bake them to avoid being in the kitchen for longer than I have to. I spray the baking tin with oil olive and then individually spray each crab cake with a wee bit of olive oil and bake at 375 for about 12 minutes (or until they are slightly golden and heated through).  Whatever way you make it though- the results are always the same- delicious!

These were incredible!  Simply every bit as good as what you would expect to get in a fine restaurant.  I bought the cans of crabmeat at Wal-Mart, and paid only $1.50 for each, making this recipe as affordable as it is delicious.  I made a couple of small changes.  I used Italian style breadcrumbs (all I had), and I omitted the red pepper and substituted with more green bell pepper.  I served these with an mango relish that I improvised, and it was a great combination.  I chopped one mango, added about 2 Tbsp. finely chopped green bell pepper, 1/2 small can of chopped pineapple, 1/2 green apple, peeled and finely chopped, juice of 1 lime, 1 Tbsp. apple jelly, 1/2 serrano pepper (finely chopped and no seeds), a small handful of chopped cilantro, and a teaspon of sugar.  Pureed a small portion of the mixture, and then mixed that back in with the rest.  The crabcakes had a wonderful flavor all on their own, but with the addition of the salsa, it was over-the-top amazing! Definitely worthy of serving to company or a/o you want to indulge.  Thanks, Lori, for a great crabcake recipe.  I will make this again and again.

Lori, really, brilliant recipe. The flavor of this recipe was excellent and I'd make it again in a heart beat. Still, I couldn't resist cooking the patties two ways. For the first two cakes I followed the recipe and fried them in a skillet as directed. They looked fantastic, but there's no mistake that there's a lot of oil there. Thinking that frying them in less oil on a griddle might be more healthy and less oily, I cooked the last four patties on a flat Westbend grill in about an ounce and half of Canola oil. I cooked them five minutes per side and they crisped up nicely and heated well through. My wife and I compared the flavor at dinner an both agreed that lighter was better. 

Also, I omitted the hot sauce and onion powder from the cakes themselves. Instead I added them to a tartar sauce made with light mayo (Duke's), sweet relish (Vlasic), fresh lemon juice, and a little Worcestershire. 

Over all, fantastic.

Absolutely delicious! I added real onions instead of onion powder plus some garlic powder and didn't add as much oil. The one thing that I would suggest though is to definetly freeze them before you fry them. It makes them stay together much better.

I made this for a dinner party last night and it was a huge hit. These were great for a party because I prepared them all early in the day, fried them and put them on paper towels before everyone sat down for salad, and then served them with grits and a crab cake sauce once they'd rested about 10 minutes. 

I used fresh lump and backfin crab meat and shredded it slightly. I used about a 1/4 cup of oil per skillet full of cakes (I made 24 cakes) and it seemed to be the right amount (and the key is to heat the skillet well before adding the cakes so they can immediately fry to hold together). As the directions indicate, 5 minutes cook time per side was just right.

I followed the directions very carefully and these crab cakes turned out a complete mess. They did not stay together in the pan and I just had a huge piled on mush in the pan. I taste the mixture and it was so greasy. I don't know  what happen. The recipe probably requires more egg whites to hold together in the pan. Very disappointed!

Use Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs in the cakes, and dredge in panko crumbs. DO NOT pat cakes more than what's necessary to just keep them from absolutely falling apart. If they fall apart anyway as you drop them into the pan - no problem, just gently slide the broken-off part back in approximate place, but DO NOT try to mold it back in to perfection. These things need to be a bit shaggy!!! Cook until there are a few black spots, then turn, and cook again the same. Drench with fresh lemon, or lightly with lemon and with a sauce - your choice. I like both cocktail and tartar sauce with crabcakes!

A final suggestion - if you're sensitive to onions (um, Pfffffft!), then substitute a bit of shallots and chives for the green onions and onion powder. Just a bit, and you get all the taste, without all the dramatic effects!

All in all though, this is an authentic Maryland Crab Cake recipie! 5 stars, EASY!!

I've made these twice and they come out perfect every time.  I also sauteed the vegetables first.  I also put them in the freezer for about 10 minutes before frying them.  They stayed together nicely.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used this dish in a family cookoff, and it turned out wonderfully!!! I just sauteed all of the vegetables first and I added fresh minced garlic and celery. In addition I used crushed ritz cracker in the mixture, and only used the crumbs as a coating. I also made a homemade sauce out of 1c. boiled heavy whipping cream, 1.5 tbs of creole seasoning, hot sauce, melted butter, and 1/2 cup of green onions.

This is a delicious crab cake recipe. It is now the only one I use. I use fresh crab instead of canned, and I bake mine for about 12 minutes at 375 F.

Absolutely the best crabcakes I have ever tasted! After making these I ordered some at Red Lobster and the were no where near as good as these! Make sure you use good quality canned crabmeat.

I think this is a great recipe for crab cakes. I do however saute my veggies before adding to the crab.  Although my grandma think this is "horrible" to do so.  I think it adds something to the dish.  All in all great recipe.

Was okay, wasn't terrible.  But I cannot say for sure if it is this recipe or not - it really could be you just need to use the best, freshest, lumpiest crabmeat for best flavor.

A very good recipe.  I'd give it 5 stars but being from Virginia Beach, VA, I've had a lot of really excellent crab cakes that are hard to beat.  I precooked the peppers, used a whole egg instead of just white, dried parsley in lieu of fresh and had to forego the onion powder because I was out. The cakes had a nice texture and were very tasty. My opinion is as long as you stick to the basic recipe you can alter it a lot and still have a great outcome.

LOVE this recipe! In fact the whole family loved it. I used a small yellow onion, cuz that is what I had and I sauteed it along with red and orange bell pepper. Didn't add the parsley or Worcestershire sauce and doubled the Old Bay. Used the whole egg also as I didn't see myself using the yolk anytime soon and didn't want to waste it! Used panko for coating the outside and cooked them in olive oil. DELICIOUS!

I made these with imitation crab meat and didn't have any peppers.. I know, but I thought they were really good!.. The DH said not so great, but oh well!... Next time I'll buy some real crab! ** With imitation crab meat they would not hold well, I had to add all the bread crumbs to the mix and add another whole egg!

I made these crab cakes today as an appetizer for my Sunday dinner.  I did a "test" cake before I did the rest and it it held together fine.  I used a whole egg instead of just the eggwhite.  I also omitted the peppers since I didn't have any.  Instead, I put a little oil, celery, green onions, onions, old bay, and lemon juice in the food processor....then used it as a 'seasoning' for the crab.  I then folded in the rest of the ingredients.  Had a really nice flavor.  My next batch will have one more egg and I'll make the patty just a tad bit thicker.  Wonderful flavor!

Oh my gosh... these were to die for!  I broiled them for 12 minutes or so to keep the recipe fat free.  Amazing!

These are phenomenal! I love crabcakes but have never made them myself. I wanted to make a sweet simple dinner for my sweetie and I and this was the perfect recipe. He loved them. The only changes I made were, I used a yellow pepper instead of a green, used vacuum sealed fresh lump crab from the seafood section and chopped it up, and I didn't have the old bay seasoning so I used zesty lemon grill seasoning because it had everything in it. I also found I needed more bread crumbs in the mix to hold the cakes together better, used about 3/4 cup. I served them with a sauce of 2 TBLS mayo, sour cream and dijon mustard mixed well with fresh parsely and a splash of white wine and a little white pepper, alongside a salad of baby italian greens with cucumber, mozzarella cheese and balsamic vinaigrette....delish! Thanks for the great recipe...will try appetizer portions at my housewarming party!

Very good.  I added garlic in addition to the other spices.  I pan fried them but think I'll try baking them at some point.  The whole family enjoyed them.

I just made these about 15 minutes ago. Love them! Only thing I did different was saute the veggies with a few cloves of garlic! Used a litte bit of Evoo and regular oil. Perfect! Did not fry them so to speak just enough to give them that beautiful color and crispness. Used some Dijon mustard as a side. Thanks Lori!

A HUGE thanks to Lori, wherever she may be, for sharing this fantastic recipe. It has all of the flavors I look for in a delicious crab cake. I appreciate the fact that it doesn't call for too much mayo, because that can really ruin a crab cake for me. I like to cook the bell peppers and garlic beforehand just to bring out a little more of the flavors, and we usually bake our crab cakes to avoid the extra fat from the oil. Turns out perfectly every time :)

Excellent recipe!  I cooked all the veggies with the dry spices first, and it was a smash hit!  I added finely chopped celery, fresh dill, minced garlic, and smoked paprika and made my own garlic-dill tartar sauce!

UPDATE: MADE THESE AGAIN (AS CRAB CAKE SANDWICHES) AND WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED. THESE WERE MUCH BETTER THAN I REMEMBERED! :) I MADE FOUR CAKES (ONE EACH FOR MY HUSBAND, DAD AND MYSELF AND ONE FOR MY LUNCH THE NEXT DAY). WHAT I DID DIFFERENTLY WAS REFRIGERATING MY FORMED "CAKES" FOR A FEW HOURS (I MADE THESE LATER IN THE AFTERNOON, BEFORE VISITING MY MOM AT THE HOSPITAL). I THINK THIS MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE. MY CRAB CAKES DID NOT FALL APART WHEN I FRIED THEM (IN ONLY 3/4 C. OIL - 1 C. IS ENTIRELY TOO MUCH). PERFECT! These were just "OK" for me. I like all of ingredients in these but found my crab cakes to be a touch too tangy for my liking (prolly because of the lemon juice / dijon mustard - one or the other would have been sufficient, IMHO). These were also not as flavorful as I had hoped and the crab mixture was really wet and difficult to work with. Having said this, I did form three large cakes because I was serving these sandwich-style and only feeding two adults. Perhaps if I'd formed smaller cakes as directed, the mushy factor wouldn't have been an issue for me. I still remain true to the TOH crab cake recipe that I've been using for years. Although very similar to this one, the ratios of ingredients produce a crab cake that is more to my liking. I do like the idea of coating each cake in breadcrumbs tho (my go-to recipe calls for flour instead). I might give these another whirl, but for what these cost to make, it won't be anytime soon. Thanks anyways, SLJ6! :-)

Only slightly changed by substituting red bell pepper with green and of course the only thing wrong with the recipe is that the cake has too strong a bell pepper taste.  So maybe I'll substitute red bell pepper for something else next time. And next time I'll double or triple the old bay seasoning. It's great.  Another review suggested that 1 cup of canola was too much, but for a 12" pan it's perfect.  REMEMBER: Use a spatula to flip them. I'm an amateur and used tongs.

The kids and I liked these very much, in fact it was the most they had eaten for dinner in quite awhile. The hubby was not to impressed, but on that note he is hard to impress and is picky. I will make these again though. Also I left out the red bell pepper only b/c I dont usually have that on hand.

These were excellent! The only changes i made were i only had green pepper so thats what i used and i used fresh jumbo lump crabmeat instead of canned. I made these 2 different ways. First, I made them as crab cakes. Then, I used the mixture to stuff flounder filets which i topped with additional Old Bay and fresh parsley then baked for 30 mins @ 350 then broiled for 10 mins. Perfect! Thanks Lori...I will be making these again.

These are, by far, the best crab cakes I have ever had.  I stuck to the recipe, except I sauteed the peppers & onion before adding them to the mix.  These were incredible!

Wow, I've never made crab cakes before and these ones were delicious. I had canned crabmeat on hand and didn't know what to make. These were really easy to make and tasted great too! Thanks for the recipe it's definately a keeper.

My husband loves crab cakes and I was so excited to make these based upon this recipe's star rating.  Make sure you read people's reviews because almost everyone made adjustments before making them which, to me, is basically creating your own recipe not following the one given.  All my husband and I could taste was pepper (and they were chopped fine) and the crab flavor was totally lacking (which is probably because it was canned, but hey- wanted to give the real recipe a shot).  Don't waste your time- we're still searching for the perfect crab cake.

I don't know what went wrong, but these didn't taste very good at all. I used Costco crab and just didn't like the taste of the cakes. My husband said they were pretty good, but I won't be making these again.

This was wonderful, I had a problem with scooping the crab cakes out of the pan, to prevent it from breaking when drawing them out, use a flat metal spatula.  This was very tasty, I used Tartar Sauce I from this site as the dip.

This was handsdown 5+ stars worthy.  I never had a crab cake before, and i decided to try it out, and it was soooo good.  Had wonderful texture and flavor.  I used a yellow bell pepper instead of the green, and it was great, i think when i make them again i'll use yellow again or red.  Man they were good, and the dijon mustard is definately the awesome secret ingredient that makes it a WOW crabcake.  I loved it.  Thanks so much Lori!!!

Made these crab cakes today and they were wonderful!  I, too, used 16 oz. of fresh crab, the whole egg, and put Panko on the outside of the cakes instead of regular breadcrumbs.  Also, I lightly sautéed the vegetables prior to mixing them with the other ingredients.  I popped them into the freezer for 15 mins. before frying them in a little canola oil and they held up perfectly.  My husband, who is very fussy, loved them and  said these were definitely a "for company" recipe.   I'll be making them as part of our Christmas Eve dinner.  Thanks Lori for sharing this recipe.

I made this exactly as stated and they were delicious!! The only thing I would change in the future, as a previous reviewer already stated, is that I would saute the veggies first to get them softer.  I wasn't a fan of the "crunch" in these crab cakes but it's an easy fix.  They are very zesty and tasty.  I will make again with the softer veggies and update in the future!

These were pretty tasty but I had trouble turning them. They fell apart. But it was tasty anyway.

The flavor in these is awesome!! I really liked that there was some veggies in them. I did have a hard time flipping them without them breaking apart not sure what I could have done differently... will definitely try to make them again.

First, the good: the flavor of this recipe is amazing! I love that it has so many veggies in it. I served this with a seafood dipping sauce from this site and some dirty rice, with a bit of Cajun seasoning added to both to give it a bit of a Creole flair. Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I cut it in half, but still added one egg white. This was my first shot at a crab cake, so I wasn't sure what consistency I was going for, but my first one  completely fell apart! I added another two teaspoons of mayonnaise and one more egg white to the remaining batter - I'll be cooking these up tomorrow, and I'm hoping I'll actually get a crab cake rather than just a pile of crab yumminess. I'll update as to the success of tomorrow's attempt.

Yum!!!  Loved the flavor in these!  I used fresh blue crab meat and I even made my own bread crumbs and grinded the mustard seeds for this.  This is our go-to crab cakes recipe now!  I served these with Garlic Aoili from this site!  Thanks Lori!

My family loved them. They were very easy to make and I received no complaints whatsoever. I fried them up with some sweet plantains. I didn't eat any myself because I prefer more bready crabcakes where I don't taste the crabmeat as much. Next time I'll make a few of these with less crabmeat just for me.

All I could taste was peppers and mustard and I DID follow the recipe to the T. I didn't have trouble with them holding together at all; however, I found them to be mushy and lacking in crab flavor. What can you expect from canned crabmeat. There's nothing like lump crab. Used Panko and they browned up nicely (in way too much oil). With all the great reviews, I was expecting something fantastic!

I made these for me and my husband. We weren't expecting anything great; I've tried several of these recipes over the past couple of years and they've all been so bad we ate something else for supper. So we were pleasantly surprised at how good these came out. I used a stalk of celery instead of the bell pepper since my husband doesn't like it. I think it would have been absolutley divine with the bell pepper - next time I might mince it very fine and sneak it in and see if he notices. Awesome recipe! Will definitely add it to my permanent, make frequently recipes! Thanks!

I loved the combination of ingrediants. I think that I should have broiled the cakes instead of frying them. We rarely eat fried foods and I could really taste the oil. I will use this recipe again but I won't fry them.

Made these for my husband (I don't eat seafood).  I followed the authors suggestions under her *review* and minced the veggies all really fine. Also, she said to use less oil to fry them in which we did. Used fresh crab.  Thanks! He LOVED them!

Awesome. I've been meaning to try this recipe for months - glad I finally did. I used red pepper only since I didn't have any green - and sent everything through my food processor before adding the crab. Perfect crab cakes - I served them with Spicy Seafood Sauce from this site. Thanks SLJ6!

Oh my oh my  OH MY!!!  These are wonderful!!!  I had seasoned bread crumbs, so that is what I used.  I whipped together some garlic mayo to serve with these.  I can not wait to make them again as is and also use the mixture to stuff fresh mushrooms and also to make stuffed flounder.  I will be making this dish often.  Thank you for a new favorite recipe!!!!

I made these exactly as the recipe directed.  I could not get them to hold together to fry.  The ingredients were to wet.  They came apart in my oil.  This was such a disapointment.  Such a waste on good crab meat.

This recipe was not as great as I expected it to be.  The crab cakes would not stay together in the pan.  They also lacked flavor - very bland to me.  I decided to use 2 egg whites instead of one because of a previous review.  I also broiled them instead of frying because I could tell they would be too oily for my taste.  I think the Phillips frozen crab cakes are better.

TY Lori! I used fresh rock crab from my catch, again...several hours of shelling to get almost 2 lbs of meat. I use as little oil as possible to get the job done, hot pan, cook as fast as possible at high heat of course.I can't critique much cause tis my first time making cakes but I assure you of my admiration. oh..I added / marinated 1 tsp of habenero for 1 hr in the liquid preperation, do I have your approval Lori?!!!!

I've never made crab cakes before, but I tried this recipe for Father's day, and it came out great!  They loved them. I didn't even use a sauce. I used a little extra crab meat and made it for 8 servings. Great recipe.

Excellent crab cakes. I chopped the veggies fine and sauted in butter, otherwise I made exactly as written. I knew these would be good just by looking at the ingredients. Next time I'm adding some cayenne pepper!

Tried this recipe verbatim and it turned out wonderful.  Very good flavor but maybe a little too rich if you plan on eating a lot.

Wow!  I should have made more!  I used red, orange and yellow sweet peppers (I don't like green) and also used panko-style bread crumbs.  My only prob was that they fell apart when I went to flip them in the pan. I had even made smaller sized cakes.  I think maybe my oil could've been a little hotter.  I served these with lightly dressed mixed greens,  garlic aioli and roasted red pepper coulis.  These were a huge hit as an app at my Mardis Gras dinner party, but I will be making them more often than just special occasions!  Yummy!

These were delicious.  This was my 3rd time making them.  The first time, I used real crab meat from a seafood market and it came out perfect.  The 2nd time, used same seafood market, but there was pieces of crab shell in the crab meat.  The 3rd time, I tried to used canned crab meat, but it didn't work out very well, it fell apart in the oil because the crab meat was too fine.  Be careful if you use canned crab meat, maybe add more bread crumbs to see if it will stick together better.  I love the recipe and will keep working with it.

Really good, I bake these on parchment paper and drizzle a very small amount of melted butter on each crab cake while baking.

I made these for guests this weekend, although I mad smaller ones so we could have them as an appetizer. The flavor and texture of the cakes was very nice. I did however choose to bread them differently (due to lack of freezer space to allow them to "set up" as other reviews suggested, I figured a little thicker breading would keep them together, I was right!). I made small cakes, lightly coated them in flour, dipped them into beaten egg and then coasted with dry (Italian seasoned) bread crumbs, them I fried in oil. Served them up with a little bit of tartar sauce (forgot the mango salsa at the store!!!). Great reviews from my guests, even a request for the recipe! I will definitely make them again :-)

I really liked this recipe. I did not have any dijon mustard and I left out the hot sauce but it was still very good. I will definitely add dijon next time though.

Great recipe. Since my daughter can't eat flour products (bread crumbs), I substitued almond meal instead of bread crumbs, and before frying the cakes I lightly covered them with almond meal.  Also, instead of using mayonaise and an egg white, I used 2 large eggs to hold everything together.

Everyone loved these crab cakes and said they tasted like they were at a restaurant! I made them a little too thick, so they took longer to fry. I will make them thinner next time. This one's a keeper. Thanks, Lori!

They were ok but I feel less veggies would be better. A bit plainer would bring out more of the crab taste.

I've paid for crab cakes in restuarants that weren't half as tasty as these. Quite delicious. We used all red peppers and substituted cilantro instead of parsley, largely because of what we had on hand. Thank you for submitting this recipe.

These are sooo good. I'm sure they are perfect the way they are written, but I made a really fun adjustment. I used the red pepper, but instead of green pepper, I shredded half a zucchini with my standing cheese grater and put that in the mix. I think it helped everything stick a little more. Also, don't worry if you don't have some of the things in the recipe. I've made them with and without parsley,  hot pepper, green onion, and old bay seasoning. The recipe is very forgiving like that.

Quite good.  I sauteed my veggies, didn't have parsley, forgot the hot sauce (which I will try to remember next time!), used a whole egg, used Old Bay with Lemon and Herb, didn't add the dry mustard or onion powder,added several cloves of garlic (sauteed with veggies), pressed panko bread crumbs on the outside, then cooked on the grill. Served on burger buns. Hubby, daughter,her boyfriend,and I all thought they were very yummy!  Will make again!

I made these for my very picky boyfriend whose uncle is a chef.  He ate every last morsel.  I added a diced up jalapeno for a kick.  If you de-seed them, you get just a tiny bit of heat but great crunch!

I though these were pretty good. I will either use fresh crab or a different kind of canned crab next time as I wasn't to fond of the kind I used. Hubby really like these and wants me to make them all the time now.

I think I will be ending my 4 year search for a keeper crab cake recipe. These were the best homemade I've ever had. I made a few small changes - I sauteed the peppers and onion for a minute or 2 in a little bit of butter, I used a whole egg instead of just the white and I broiled them instead of frying. I drizzled about a tablespoon of melted butter over the tops the last 2 minutes of broiling for flavor. Yum.

I made these to bring to a family dinner; I was a little leary because I only had 12 oz. of fresh crab and 12 oz. of imitation crab- but I chopped the imitation crab in the food processor and used it anyway. I double the recipe and made appetizers. After the test cake any fear that I had of them not coming out was gone!! These are awesome; even at 0700 when I made them. I also baked them at 375 but it took almost 30 minutes to get them lightly browned on both sides. I didn't have dry mustard or onion powder so I omitted them both. This recipe,I'm sure will only get better with all fresh crab!! Very good and very EASY to make. Thanks Lori!

I loved everything about these crab cakes - taste, texture, and that they are easy to make.  I did not add the onion powder or dry mustard -just a bit more Old Bay instead - and they were perfect.  Thanks for a keeper recipe.

These were very good and very easy to make.  I followed another reviewer's advice and cooked them on my westbend skillet with less oil than the recipe called for.  Will definitely make these again.

I've been trying various crab cake recipes for years, and this is IT!  Everyone loved them!  I used fresh crab meat instead of canned and added a bit more mayonnaise (perhaps because the crab was a bit lumpier) to bind them together.  They came out perfect!  I used a red pepper sauce from another crab cake recipe on Allerecipes.com and it worked perfectly with the peppers in the cakes.

I followed the direction to the tee. The crab cakes were very good, but a little bland. Next time i think i am going to double the mustard and the old bay just to give it a little extra kick. Other than that it was a very quick and easy recipe.

These crabcakes were excellent, restaurant quality for sure.  I used fresh lump crabmeat, I don't care for canned crabmeat, and really prefer a lumpy crabcake.  I took one reviewer's suggestion and popped them in the freezer for 10-15 minutes before frying, which helped to hold them together.  This is probably one of my favorite AR finds, thank you so much!!

The best crab cakes I've ever made.  I followed the recipe to the end but thought the mix would not hold together so I added the leftover yolk plus about 3 tbl heavy cream.  That worked well.  I also didn't use all that oil.  Yum!

Awesome recipe!!!! It was my first time making crab cakes and they came out great. I changed up some things like saute veggies a little in olive oil with some fresh garlic and the key to keeping them together for cooking is chill them for at least an hour or two before cooking them.

These cakes got rave reviews from my friends.  I was careful with the recipe from the start after reading the negative reviews (regarding them falling apart).  I had the heat turned up high at the start of cooking, however, they didn't hold together very well.  I just made smaller, but thicker, cakes.  The smaller cakes held together much better than 6 large cakes, as the recipe calls for.

My biggest concern was how hot the oil should be.   4 minutes on each side was too long at high heat.  However at medium heat the 4 minutes on each side yielded perfectly brown cakes. Good recipe.

This was my first time at making crab cakes and these turned out great.  I sauteed the veggies before adding them.  I also had to use more bread crumbs, because the mixture was very wet.  I took the suggestion of others and fried them in less oil.

I took a few ingredients such as: green peppers,parsley,hot sauce, and some of the other seasonings from this recipe and added them to the "My Crab Cakes" recipe when I made them.  I do this a lot with recipes and have always been happy with the results.

These were pretty good.  After reading the reviews I decided to just omit the bell peppers hoping they would not fall apart and that worked well, not all that crazy about bell peppers in my crab cakes anyway.  Coated with Panko bread crumbs because they stay very crispy.

These were prety darn good!  They take a little more effort than the other recipes posted but are worth it.  Hubby liked how the seasonings added flavor but did not overpower the crab and they stayed together without a lot of breading.  I did add an extra egg white.

This was my first time making crabcakes. They were easy and delicious. I made them ahead and froze them so all I had to do was fry them on Christmas Eve.  They were such a big hit, I'll be making them every Christmas!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Terrific recipe!  I'd put these crab cakes against any restaurant.  I made a double batch thinking they'd make great leftovers, I guess I'll have to find out another time because there certainly weren't any leftovers this time!

Great recipe!!!  They take a little time to prepare but I must say that these are better than most of the crab cakes I get in restaurants.  I cut down on the amount of oil I fried them in and would agree that is the way to go.  Besides that, I didn't change anything - they are perfect!

These were wonderful!  I used 1 can of crabmeat and one 6 oz bag of crabmeat (the real stuff, not surimi) from Walmart. Used much less oil.  Also made in the late afternoon and then put in the fridge till I was ready to cook.  Also diced the vegies really small.  If the nutritional info is based on one cake per serving, count on doubling the calories and fat.  It made 6 average size patties and my husband and I each ate two of them. One would not have been enough for a dinner serving.

Fantastic!   Used a whole egg and baked them with a bit of spray oil and used fresh off the boat Dungeness crab which we can get in San Francisco area.   SO much better than restaurant crab cakes with way too much 'filler'.   These were great as they were mostly crab and vegetables--maybe the best recipes I've tried from this site and I've tried a lot! The perfect special night dinner--this one for my valentine of 25+ years.

We really wanted salmon cakes tonight so we cooked salmon before incorporating and used that instead of crab. This was great, not as basic as most of the salmon cake recipes, but not so extravagant that it couldn't be done on a weeknight.

These were fantastic.  Very happy with the recipe. We needed to cook a bit longer though and I think it was because of the thickness.

Made this last night and it was REALLY good. I added a pressed and then diced garlic clove. Make sure you add just enough bread crumbs to help the binding process. Better to leave it on the loose side because what I think is the key to getting the mixture to hold together is to refrigerate the mixture for an hour before dividing into patties to give it time to set up. Also I used the small panko breadcrumbs which made for a nice light crust. I cooked them in butter and then drained on paper towels. I used a canned lump white crabmeat from Costco and it was delicious. Lastly I made a simple aioli by mixing some mayonnaise with Sriracha sauce and it really was a great fit for these awesome crab cakes.

These came out really well for me.  I used a mix of crab and lobster meat. I also took some of the other reviewers advice and sauteed chopped shallots, celery, and red pepper in a pan first and added that in to the mixture.  But the spice mixture was great.  These were a great hit - I made mini ones - and will definitely make again.

This recipe is outstanding. I made this for the first time for a party and everyone raved about how great it was.  A number of folks asked for the recipe and will happily pass it on. I did add some garlic to the recipe and did saute the peppers, green onion and garlic before adding to the mix.

These were amazing.  We made a sauce to compliment the crab cakes.  It was made by mixing 2 tablespoons of mayonaise, the juice of half a lemon and a few shakes of hot sauce.  It was all very tastey!

I tried another crab cake recipe and it was awful. This one was really good. I added celery because I like it. I made them small as suggested. I used canned crab meat. Now I'm ready to try fresh crab when I have it from the Oregon Coast. Fresh crab is so yummy by itself why waste it in crab cakes...but if we catch lots I'll try it.

Hello Lori from your neighbor in Flanders! I'm a crab cake lover and very picky about them too. I'm so happy that this recipe turned out as fabulously as it looked. I did cut way back on the oil and they fried up beautifully. Thank you so much for a great lunch today!

wow these were so easy and tasty! Although, they did fall apart on me too, even after adding extra egg white, and i think i might try sauteing the peppers first just to soften them up a bit and bring out their flavour! I pan fried them with just a few sprays of canola oil in the pan to make them healthier and they still turned out nice and golden brown! I served them with the "Crab Cake Sauce" also on this site (by Joan). Delicious!

My husband made these for dinner last night.  The taste was great!  He prepared a horseradish sauce to accompany them.

The only negative he had about the recipe was that they didn't stick together as well as he would have liked when frying.

Great recipe!  I did use an entire egg vs just the yolk.  I added the lemon zest as well as juice.   I also made the patties and then refridgerated for a couple hours so it didn't fall apart and it worked perfectly.  I served with a remoulade of mayo, dijon, lemon juice, worchestire and hot sauce.  So delicious.  My daughter's favorite appetizer anywhere we go is crab cakes and she said these were among the best she's had!

Meaty, every flavor is balanced.  Reminded me of my 11 years living in the DC area.  I didn't change anything in recipe.  I did, however, serve it with Arnaud's remoulade sauce - that's from living in East Texas/Western Louisiana for 15 years!

I did use a whole egg & regular mustard (instead of just the egg white & was out of Dijon) and the family was quite happy with the results  ! I will definitely make this again.

I made the recipe as directed, but used two egg whites and extra mayonnaise to ensure the cakes stayed put while frying.  I also substituted 1/2 tsp. onion salt since I didn't have onion powder.  I found that 5 minutes on each side was too much, so I turned down the heat to medium on my stove and cooked approximately 3 1/2 to  4 minutes on each side.  I followed the advice of another person who tried this recipe and I placed the crab cakes in the freezer for 15 minutes prior to frying them.  I made extra cakes, so I am going to try broiling them tomorrow instead of frying them.  I think a sauce would be a nice complement.  Will explore those options tomorrow as well.

These were terrific!  We had left over King crab from New Years Eve, so the flavor of the crab really came through. I didn't have bell pepper so I used a little more green onion.  I didn't have Old Bay, so I used a copy cat recipe from the web.  I thought these were terrific!  Lot's of flavor, I did have to use more binder (Panko) as Lori mentioned in her follow up, which I think was due to moisture from the crab. But they had more flavor than what I usually find at a good restaurant!  I made some Sirachi aioli to go with, but they were so flavorful it wasn't needed.  Thanks for such a good recipe!

I made it just as written, except I only had two cans of crab so cut everything by a third. They were great! I used a sriracha crab cake sauce recipe with them. They were crunchy on the outside, tasty on the inside. I felt slightly like something was missing so may add a little salt next time?

Really good and easy to make. I baked in the oven instead of frying. 350 for approx 12 minutes.

Absolutely delicious. Made mostly as is... Just a few minor adjustments - I used whole beaten egg and made smaller crab cake balls - they seemed to hold together a lot better than the bigger ones. Used Gluten Free bread crumbs, and just a red pepper with no chili sauce. I also use the Pontchartrain Gulf caught  lump crab meat. Serve it with coleslaw, shoes string fries, and a pink sauce (Mayo, Ketchup, Worcestershire Sauce, Lemon Juice, Tabasco) Amazing!!

We use jumbo lump crab and broil instead of fry them and top with mango salsa! I love these!!!!!  My husband is so picky about his crab cakes and most restaurants do not compare to his love for these.  Since we do the jumbo lump and do not fry them, they can break easily, but we just gently slide off the baking sheet on to the plate.  Best crab cakes ever!  Thank you for sharing!!!  Dice everything really small to.

I confess I had to make a few changes here. I used fresh King crab meat instead of can. It looked like I didn't have enough crab meat, so I added some shrimp meat to the mix. I did have ground bay leaf, so I used 1/4 tsp. of thyme. I also didn't have fresh parsley, so I had to guess what four 'sprigs' of parsley might look like (thankfully I've often used fresh parsley before!) with dried. Finally, I didn't have any green onion so I used regular red onion and I only used red pepper. Lots of substitutes perhaps but they came out fine. I think in next time, I'll try having all ingredients on hand - and I will definitely try freezing the patties before frying! Maybe chilling the mix before forming them also. My one complaint on this recipe (maybe all crab cakes) is how sticky it was when I was making the patties; I felt like I was waiting too much of the mix because of the amount stuck on my hands.

I make these all the time. I lightly dust bread crumbs on the patties  and put the in the fridge for about and hour. This helps them set and keeps them from falling apart.

I had a 16 oz can of crab so I worried about measurements, but I don't think it would have mattered. instead of bread crumbs in the mix I used almond meal, vegannaise instead of mayonnaise, and the bread crumbs to coat the patties I used a mix of gluten free panko and chickpea flour. I misted the top of the patties with olive oil and baked at 400 for 15 minutes, turned them over misted again and baked for another 8 minutes. nothing was going to hold these together, I needed 2 spatulas to flip them, but the flavor was good, very tasty. I think adding the egg yoke might have helped. I will keep looking for a crab cake recipe

Made just as directed with 3 changes to the technique...sauteed the vegetables in a bit of butter before adding them to the mixture, put the mixture in the fridge for an hour and then baked, instead of fried, at 375 for 15 minutes. They still weren't piping hot, so I may do them a little longer next time.  Really great flavors, very vibrant and delicious.

Gluten free baked version!  Don't be mad because of my changes, it was necessary for me!  Substituted gluten free bread crumbs, used 1 lb. fresh crab meat and baked instead of fried.  Chill 2-4 hours after making patties.  Preheat oven and foil lined try to 400.  Coat baking sheet with canola oil (about 1 T.). Bake 15min and the turn over and baked additional 5 min.   Remove to paper towel lined plate to absorb extra oil and serve with your favorite remoulade sauce. I've never had crab cakes because finding them gluten free is next to impossible.  I'm so glad to have tried this recipe...it was fabulous!

This is by far the best cheese cake recipe. I have made this exactly as the recipe is written and it has come out perfect. I have also used this recipe as a base for other flavors.

In 1972 after returning from Vietnam I was stationed in Biloxi MS at the local police station with town patrol.   The cook at the PD made what has been the best crab cakes I have ever eaten... Till now.  These crab cakes are at least as good and that says a lot.  I added a little more mayo and a lot more (1tbsp) of Old Bay but this is a great recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

This was my first time making crab cakes. I picked this one because for me it seemed like the ingredients were all there, and my name is also Lori :) Personal taste/instinct told me to add carrot and extra bay seasoning. A quality canned crab meat is definitely the way to go. They are delicate to handle, all part of the challenge! I pattied and bread crumbed then put in the freezer for 20. Re-bread crumbed then fried. I was also careful to slice the veggies very thin to prevent falling apart. Next time I'll try the food processor to save some time. A keeper. Thanks Lori!

I added chopped celery, garlic and parmesan to mixture and put the cakes in the freezer before dipping them in panko flakes.  I used extra fresh crab my husband had just gotten out of the ocean that day.  Fried them in a little oil in my Grandma's cast iron skillet.  Great recipe.

These were great. For anyone that had problems with them falling apart my advice is to use less oil, fry them on medium and do not turn them until they have set. That said, we are from a small town in Michigan and do not have anywhere to purchase "real crab meat" I have to confess that I followed the recipe exactly, but substituted "fake" crab meat and it was still excellent. if and when the " Real" stuff is available, believe me we will try it. But even with the substitution, it was a great recipe!!

I used 1/2 Panko Bread Crumbs with 1/2 Progresso Bread Crumbs, and added a 2nd egg white to bind the mixture. The Panko keeps the Crabcakes lighter, as well as less likely to overwhelm the delicacy of the Crab ( I used fresh, from my local FishMonger). I added some seasoned salt, lemon pepper and Cayenne Pepper to the last of the breadcrumb coating mix. Served it with Cheese Toast, grilled, and it was fabulous-- best I've ever had!!

Great recipe! I have made this recipe as is and variations of it and the cakes turn out great every time. For a minor kick I add a teaspoon of two of Siracha. Another change in my recent batches is that I halved the frying time, drain, and then pop in the oven, so the feel less oily and have a nice crunch. Plus, if someone is late coming in for dinner it's super easy to heat up.

Very good.  I made some modifications to achieve 10 servings.  By using 4 cans of of pink crab in 6 oz. cans (very affordable), I added a 5th can of wield small shrimp to create texture.  Also, I baked the 10 crab cakes at 375 for 12 minutes then broiled them until they were my desired golden color.  This will be our new to-to crab cake recipe.

Delicious! I followed the directions almost exactly, except I used dried parsley and 16oz crab claw meat that I shredded up.  I also BAKED them at 375 for about 15 min.  The first time I made them, I baked half and pan fried half, and my husband and I agreed the flavor comes out and the texture is much better baked.  I spray the tops with fake butter spray about 3 minutes before I take them out and they crisp up nicely.  These also make me about a dozen decent sized cakes, and reheat in the oven perfectly!  Thanks for a great recipe!  Highly recommend.

I'm sure this is a fine recipe, but I think I've decided after trying several crab cake recipes that in fact I just don't like crab cakes! I tried this one, and it just didn't do it for me.  Thanks for sharing though!

This recipe had the perfect amount of crab. Great recipe. Really good with a side of Japanese steak house shrimp sauce, or a remoulade if you can find it on the shelf at your grocery store.

These were great , but I had to make a few additions. I used a 16oz package of flaked imitation crab. I added a little extra green onion, 1 jalapeno, 3 cloves garlic and 1/8 cup parmesan.  Made the garlic aoili sauce to dip them in. Yum!!

They taste alright, but I had a lot of trouble getting the patties to bind together. The directions do not make clear just how fine the vegetables need to be chopped either. Really, they need to be closer to minced. I ended up crushing bread crumbs into a fine powder and adding about twice as much Mayo, Dijon Mustard, Worcestershire and seasoning. Even then, it only yielded about 4 small cakes. I will continue to use the seasonings from this recipe, but I'll be re-tooling how some of the more basic ingredients are implemented.

I wish I had have added some garlic to the mix after reading the other reviews. Overall, this was a great recipe. At first, my mixture was too loose, so i added more egg. I saw another user suggest to add more mayo. I will do that next time.

Really good recipe, my boyfriend at them all up.  I have learned I am just not a fan of crab meat, but I won't mark the recipe down because of that fact.

i put a spin on this recipe and omitted (i.e., didn't have so i improvised) the Worcestershire sauce and the Dijon mustard. I used red onion, no onion powder, and dried parsley flakes. i replaced the hot pepper sauce with serrano peppers and placed the mixture in mini phyllo shells. A-MAZING! we couldnt get enough of them and i can't wait to make it again!

LOVED these, I made them exactly like the recipe called, and they were a hit. I always thought crab cakes were something I could only get in a resturant. Not anymore!

We love this recipe, I made the mistake of bringing them to work once and now I'm asked to make them all the time. I did make the change of using fresh crab meat from the seafood store in addition to the canned, so it has lots of chuncks of crab, expensive, but worth it

This recipe was good a start.  I added more tabasco and onions.  I also sauted the green peppers with some garlic for an extra kick!!!

Great recipe!  I did have some trouble like the others with it staying together in the pan.  My kids weren't keen on the green pepper. I told them it was a Crabby Patty from Sponge Bob. LOL!

By far the best crab cakes I have ever had.  There isn’t a restaurant crab cake out there that can beat this recipe. The only thing that would make them better is if someone else would make them for me, whenever I wanted them.  If you want a little more kick to the crab cakes, try substituting one of the bell peppers for a poblano pepper.

I thought these were the most delicious crab cakes ever.  I followed the recipe exactly (which I rarely do) and was pleasantly surprised at the outcome.  My husband loved them as well.  Will make again for company in a few weeks.

Excellent flavor, but way TOO MUCH oil in frying.  The recipe calls for 1 cup and when they were done they were virtually soaked in oil.  Even when I tried to get the oil out on paper towels, they were oily.  So next time I will try to fry on high heat with less oil.

Fabulous recipe!  We usually serve carb cakes with a tomato ginger sauce, but these stood on their own.  I also fried them in a light coating of olive oil on a griddle - too oily doesn't do it for me.  But they browned beautifully.  I used only red pepper (since that is what I had).  I used leftover fresh crab from cracked Dungeness crab.  The taste was SCRUMPTIOUS!  Highly reccomend.

Good, not a lot of bread crumbs.  I will add more Old Bay next time.
