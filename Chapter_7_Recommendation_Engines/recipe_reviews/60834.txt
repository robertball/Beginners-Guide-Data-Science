This pizza was just average.  I added some mozzaerlla to the toppings.  This sounded really good, but nobody in my family thought it was anything special. I don't think I'll make this again.

We liked this pizza and we'll make again. Was also great as leftovers, not a piece went to waste. We used imatation crab since that is tastier to us and I buy on sale and freeze. (I just recommend squeezing the water out after thawing for this pizza) I made 1/2 the receipe and that would be great for 4 people with a side. I think the cream cheese is the right amount since there is not other cheese on it. (and i would not recommned adding other cheese since that would change the pizza too much and with the ingrediants not blend right) I would use the amount listed for the cream cheese and be sure to cut into little pieces so each bite is sure to have some cheese.

I used less cream cheese as someone mentioned and can't imagine this with the amount the recipe calls for.  Canned crab meat is not to exciting and if I ever had fresh crab meat I probably wouldn't use it for a pizza.  My kids (5 & 3) both liked it but not sure if I'll make it again.

Too much cream cheese for me.  Plus, when you live on the coast, and are used to fresh seafood, canned crab just doesn't cut it :-/

I thought this was only okay; my husband thought its fantastic. I thought it was bland and a bit dry. Changes I made were I used pizza dough that you buy in the bakery rather than the canned, and I did use leftover real crab rather than canned. I will try to make it again but adding more flavor/seasoning.

Easy to make!  I started with my own pizza dough, then roughly combined the cream cheese and tomato sauce to spread on top, then added the crab.  This was a delicious pizza for a special occasion!
