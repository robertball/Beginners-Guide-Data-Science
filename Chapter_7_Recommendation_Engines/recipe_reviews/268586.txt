This was very good.  I mixed some garlic powder into both the onion mixture and the ricotta mixture, as well as mixing some black pepper, salt, and a tsp of honey into the ricotta.  I used two sheets of puff pastry (the entire box) and doubled the ricotta mixture.  I reserved 1/4 of the gruyere to sprinkle over the top of the onion mixture before baking.  I drizzled about a tsp of honey over the top before baking.

I think the mushroom mixture and the ricotta were bland.  I would add more spices if I make again.
