So Easy! I melt all the ingredients, except for the peanuts, over low heat, added the peanuts, and just scooped out tablespoonfulls onto waxed paper.  They set up and made the BEST little chews!  A perfect combo of saltly and sweet. The first to go at the party. I will make these for years to come.

YUMMY! I made for my Christmas Cookie tray and they were devoured in no time. Even made a second batch before the holiday came, except the 2nd time I chose to mix all ingredients together and then set....was much easier and still tasted great if not better.  Quick, easy, and a big hit with my family! Thanks Stacy!

Mmmmmm.. 
To start off with I halved the recipe. Other than that and putting it in an 8x8 inch baking pan I didnt change anything. It was hard to get out of the pan. Here are the changes I'm going to make next time. Although I get why the peanuts are supposed to be on the top and bottom (inspired by the candy bar)It was too peanuty, taking away from that awesome chewy, fudgey center. So Im going to reduce the amount of nuts, not lining the pan with then, and instead chop some up and mix them in with the melty mixture. Then I'll line my baking pan with parchment paper. I'm still going to top the mixture with peanuts, though. This is just my preference, and reallyI still think this recipe is awesome and will definitely make again.

This candy tastes wonderful.  My problem was trying to get it out of the pan.  It was a gooey mess that couldn't be cut with a knife.  What did I do wrong?  I went right by the recipe.

I halved the recipe and it's a good thing I did. We gobbled them up in a couple of days. I used parchment paper to drop them by spoon fulls and it worked great. The second batch I dipped them in chocolate after they had cooled. They are just too good!

I made some changes to the recipe that I think will help with the problem of them being too sticky.  I didn't melt the marshmallows in the warm mixture, and I increased the amount of marshmallows to soak up most of the warm mixture.  I added the peanuts on top and used wax paper to press it down.  Refridgerate and cut when set.  Yummm!

Well these are certainly good but also very rich.  I, like others, had a terrible time with the sticky consistancy.  Even leaving them in the fridge at all times except when cutting a chunk to eat did not reduce the stickiness.  Because I found this to be a big deterrent, I will not be making these again, although as I said, they are quite yummy!

I followed the directions exactly except for 2 things.  First I pulsed my nuts in a food processor.  I did it until they were fairly fine with chunks.  I would suggest only processing them briefly to get them roughly chopped.  If the nuts are too small, you have a ton of fine nuts at the bottom of your pan.  However, having them chopped up some helps to prevent them getting stuck to the pan.  The other thing I did was used two 8 inch bread pans, as I don't have an 11x7.  These are awesome and my family can't stay away from them.  Thank goodness they are a cinch to make!

These are super easy and super good!!! I made them along with some other candy to use for gift platters this year. My husband has taken a liking to these so I don't have many left for the gifts :)

These are so simple & quick to make.  Everytime I make these, they are gobbled up in no time.  I prefer the dry roasted peanuts in order to avoid high sodium in the salted nuts.

Made these exactly as written. They tasted great! Just be warned, they take a couple hours in the refrigerator to set up enough to not be a big, gooey mess.

So easy to make it was unbelievable. Got an encore from the office but with some chocolate drizzle for that O'Henry taste. Gluten free which seems popular these days.

Flavor is great. Mine took forever to set up. Finally left them in the fridge overnight. I made the mistake of lining the pan with tinfoil thinking it would be easier to get out of the pan. Ended up having to peel the foil off and putting it back in the pan. When I did this I decided to go ahead and spray the pan. They came out easy after that.
Also had to store them in the fridge or they started spreading out. But I would make these again.
