This is from my brother- in-law, who is from cuba.

We use regular sub rolls from the grocery bakery. We spread a very thin coating of butter on the outside and lightly sprinkle them with garlic salt and black pepper.  Once you grill them, they are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Inside, we used thinly sliced deli ham and left over pork tenderloin from the night before, swiss cheese, mayo, mustard and fresh pickles such as claussen's.  We grilled them up on the Foreman grill, pressing hard to flatten them out and heat everything through.  I have yet to make these without rave reviews!! I now have a new favorite sandwich!  Very easy to make and fantastic!!  Thanks.

I've been making these sandwhiches for years only I use a club roll like a Paninni bread and 86 the maoy and mustard I use cilantro, parsley, garlic, hot chile flakes and olive oil, puree in food prosessor to make a pesto and spread that on the roll, you'll love it better and it's better for you

This sandwich sounds like the real Medianoche to me.  I have a Cuban-American cookbook from Miami, "Memories of A Cuban Kitchen" that includes the same recipe. Egg buns are a good bread to use - sweet and big enough in the dinner size.  Most international bakeries/delis have egg buns. Thanks for thiss classic, yummy recipe!

I am addicted to this sandwich as made at a Cuban bakery in Glendale, CA. and I have to say that this is close to town in flavors, BUT it is missing the garlic! I always smash a garlic and rub it on the cut side of the bread before spreading the mayo and mustard, and then follow the rest of the recipe as indicated -now that is a WOW of a Cuban sandwich! The reason for the added garlic flavor is that "traditional Cuban roasted pork" is loaded with garlic and that is the special flavor to this sandwich that you will not find in regular store bought sliced roasted pork. Try this trick to see the difference - Otherwise, this is a winner of a sandwich!

This is the sandwich we make using the leftovers from Cuban Pork Roast I from AR.  Using other pork types just pales in comparison....    Always awakens the taste buds with so many different flavors.  One of our favorites!  Thank you Pretty Pink Bullets for the submission for all to enjoy!

I grew up in Tampa Florida and I remember my parents packing my sister and I up and driving into Ybor City for Cuban sandwiches and deviled crabs. Other than the mayo, I made as directed and they took me back to my childhood. Great recipe!!!!!

Although I just used a hoagie roll instead of a sweet roll this was awesome-- I did use my George Foreman Grill to press the sandwich together-- although it had some cute grill marks across the bread it was sooooo easy to do instead of the heavy pressing with a skillet etc.  Family loved it of course

We also added Italian dressing and we didn't have sliced dill pickles, but we substitued dill pickle relish and it turned out great.  This is definately a hit with our family and will our new use for left over pork loins.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I have made this many times and it is very good...I was born in Ybor City, Fl and am of Cuban decent...It irks me when people in restaurants call their sandwiches "authentic" Cuban...If it's not on real Cuban bread, it is not an "authentic" Cuban sandwich...Otherwise, very good sandwich...

Oh, wow!  I used some of a leftover french loaf since the store didn't have any sweet rolls other than the onces that are really small.  I used spray butter, smoked ham, and some black pepper pork sandwich meat.  Soooo good.  Next time, I'm going to use a honey mustard recipe that I got off of the site instead of mustard/mayo on the sandwich.  Thank you so much!  This is definately a keeper!

My deli did not have pork to thinly slice, so I roasted a pork loin fillet seasoned with just salt and pepper and sliced it into thin cuts.  I used brown sugar deli-sliced ham and sandwich-sliced Tabasco pickles.  I used a cast iron skillet to press the sandwiches and found medium heat worked best (rather than medium-high).  Tasted truly authentic!  Can't wait to make again!

Yum, the only thing I can compare these to is a Po'Boy.  They are great.  The plate trick really works too.  I just brushed with a little olive oil to help crisp them.  I used regular sandwich rolls too.

My new favorite lunch!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used just regular panini rolls and didn't measure the mayo and mustard, just put on to our tastes.  Used leftover pork I had from a roast, and it was fantastic!  I used my George Foreman to grill for a couple minutes.  I can't wait to make this again!

I was looking for a good recipie, and I found it! I love cuban sandwiches. For an interesting twist buy the prepared pulled BBQ pork in your deli section and heat that up and use that for the pork. Makes for a taste explosion!!!
Thanks so much for sharing your wonderful recipe.

Pretty darn good. I do it a bit different... Use a firm baguette instead of roll. No mustard. Instead of mayo do garlic aioli. Instead of pickle use sweet banana peppers. YUM. Also, add chopped cilantro.

This was good, similar in flavor to a ham'n'cheese with a twist, to my taste.  However, my better half really liked it!  I had to improvise with the  griddle/skillet thing, and I do say that  8 minutes (4 min. a side) was a  bit too long-  it got a little too *carbonized*.  If your pan is hot as it should be, 3 minutes is plenty!

I bought a loaf of the real-deal cuban bread (the kind where they put a palm frond right down the center of loaf) from an authentic cuban bakery in Tampa which elevated this to a 5-star recipe...yes, the bread is that good!!  I thought 1/2 cup mayo was too much for my taste, so I cut that back drastically.  I used reduced-fat mayo and spread just enough on the bread to moisten it and then spread some mustard on top of that.  I used my panini pan to get the pressed effect, and did add some really flavorful Campari tomatoes before cooking.  Nice, nice sandwich for lunch today.

I had a hard time finding pork lunchmeat- so I bought a pork tenderloin that was already marinated, baked it and sliced it up for the sandwiches- very very good! We don't use sweet rolls, but a nice crusty Italian roll. Everyone loves these!

Very easy and very good. There is a vendor near by job who sells these and I love them , but this recipe  is far better than his medianoche sandwiches. YUM  NOTE: I used my George Foreman grill to make these and it worked great.

One of my favorite sandwiches ever! This turned out perfectly, thank you :o) I used leftover sliced pork roast for this and it was awesome. Definitely don't skimp on the mustard and pickles!! I actually had spicy kosher pickles so I think that took this recipe up to ten stars. The frying pan method worked just fine so I didn't  have to dig out my george foreman grill. thanks again for this recipe!

I've eaten a LOT of Cuban sandwiches (never in Cuba, mostly in Key West) and this tastes as good as the best I've ever had - even though I'm low-carbing it these days and made it with a low carb Tortilla and it wasn't pressed in a grill.  FABULOUS recipe.  Thank you so much for sharing!

If you cant find roast pork at your deli, do this.  I take a pork tenderloing and marinate in Mojo Criollo overnight to give it that authentic Cuban flavor.  Then roast slowly in oven at 300 degrees until done.  Then I shred it, this is how they used to do it when I was growing up in Tampa.  It was delicious.

This is the real thing folks.  I'm of Cuban descent and live in Miami and this is a wonderful recipe.  I would argue that mayo is not an original ingredient in a Medianoche or a Cuban Sandwich but you can always leave it out.  I make these for parties, cut the sandwich into fours, put toothpicks through them and place them on platters.  They are always the first to go.  Great Recipe!

Those of us who used to live in Florida and - quite honestly -  took these sandwiches for granted THANK YOU!!
WOW - a great sandwich that reminds me of living in Tampa, although the bread was not particularly sweet.
A keeper!!

Excellent! I used extra lean pork and ham, reduced fat swiss, and light mayo. My husband said it was the best he'd ever had.

it sounds good, but not the cuban original recipe; no sweet bread, we use cuban bread,  crispy and dry outside and no mayo, instead butter should be use...I'm born and raise in Cuba, my mother has cuban restaurants all her life... but it seems a good variation..

Loved this!  It tasted just like one I had at Walt Disney World recently.  My only change was using mozzerella cheese instead of swiss (didn't have swiss on hand).

Delicious, but I did make some changes.  I used an equal amount of mayo and mustard, blended, and added a shake or 2 of garlic powder.  I also used roasted turkey and roast pork and provolone cheese and sub rolls.  Guess that's pretty different than the original now that I've written it!  Nevertheless, this was a good guide to use, and the sandwiches were a hit.  They'll be a regular.

I love making these sandwitches as they are easy and can be combined with whatever you have on hand. I would recommend using olive oil instead of butter as well.

Wendy, these are great! I used soft kaiser rolls, mixed in a bit of italian dressing with the mayo and mustard and there was plenty of meats for 6 huge sandwiches. Luckily my deli had sliced roast pork! I too brushed them with olive oil before pressing them in my griddle and they crisped up so nicely. Served with black bean soup. Even my little girl loved her sandwich AFTER she yanked the pickles off!

This was wonderful!  When I have had these at Cuban restaurants, there is no mustard or mayonnaise on the bread, just butter, so that's how I made mine.  I used provolone instead of Swiss (just a personal preference, and Claussen garlic pickles.  Wow!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made these using the Cuban Pork Roast I from this site, and it was absolutely delicious. We did thicker slices fresh out of the oven and skipped toasting. My boyfriend is not a fan of mustard, so that was left out, but did add garlic powder to the mayo, similar to another reviewer's suggestion.

In a pinch I have made these using everything except the pork and it's a good way to use up those extra hamburger buns. We like to mix mayo and italian dressing together as in the Cuban Midnight Sandwich on this site.

Excellent sandwich!  Even my picky "Boys" at it up and wanted moore.  I used some leftover pulled pork from another dinner earlier in the week that had no barbeque sauceon it.  It was seasoned with a few spices and it was perfect on this sandwich !  I will surely make this one again !

My family loved this even though I had to make some adjustments to use what I had on hand at  the moment.  I had to use Havarti cheese and hamburger buns.  But after grilling them on a grill pan and pressing them with my cast iron skillet you couldn't tell it was a bun.  It just tasted wonderful.  I only made half of the sauce and it was plenty.  This is a good quick meal.

I love this sandwich! One of my favorites...For the spread I did 1 part dijon, 1 part spicy mustard, 1 part yellow mustard, and 3 parts mayo. I omitted the pickles out of personal preference and didn't have pulled pork on hand so I used turkey but will definitely try pork next time. And since I had it in my fridge, I added sliced scallions, fresh spinach leaves, and a pinch of black pepper, salt, and sugar. YUM!

I had seen this made on the FoodNetwork and wanted to try it but never had all the ingredients until now.  I followed the recipe as stated except for the bread.  I only had ciabatta bread (plus it made for a smaller serving size)!  This was so good!  The crispiness of the bread, the pickle crunch and of course the "sauce" makes the sandwich!  Will definately make again.

Cubans have become one of my favorite “go to” sandwiches when eating out.   It’s true, an authentic Cuban must have a slice of pork tenderloin to be considered a real Cuban Midnight Sandwich.  For the pork tenderloin, I used the recipe for “Havana Slow Cooker Pork Tenderloin” from this site.  It gives this sandwich a lot of extra added flavor.

Not that I know personally, but it looks like the sandwiches I've seen on travel shows.  I made ours on onion buns with leftover grilled pork chops.  My husband had one like the recipe, everyone else had theirs catered to their tastes.  I made mine on a whole wheat bun grilled with olive oil, a bit healthier and still yummy!

YUM!  My husband raved about it (he took leftovers for lunch), I loved it, my daughter loved it, but our teenaged son was so-so.  He ate it, but didn't take a second one (he is 16, 6 ft and growing, so 2 sandwiches would be the norm).  He's the only reason it didn't get 5 stars!

Except for the sweet bread, this is exactly the sandwich I lived on in Key West, made by Cubans for Cubans. They used those rolls that are a smaller, hoagie sized version of French bread. I love these sandwiches, but I only gave 4 stars because I didn't like the sweet bread so much. Next time I'll go back to the original.

This sandwich is delicious and very quick and easy to make! The only suggestion I have is to use spicy or deli mustard instead of regular yellow mustard, but either way everyone should give these a try you wont be disappointed!

I had left over center cut pork chops that I thinly sliced, and added a thin spread of italian dressing to the bread before mayo and mustard. We used portuguese rolls, which are denser and crustier. What  a great sandwich. The pickles make it, don't leave the pickles out!! Not like the real thing but as close as we'll get in upstate NY.

I too have problems finding the Cuban sweet rolls, so I use honey mustard instead of regular yellow mustard. (Don't use honey mustard dressing -- it tastes different.) It's the closest I've come to emulating the cubanos I loved in Miami.

Excellent!  I used the ingredients as listed, but just mixed mustard and mayo together and used the spread. I also used my George Foreman grill to cook it and the bread turned out nice and crusty outside and soft inside.  I wouldn't change anything.

We love the other recipe on this site that uses turkey, but are tired of turkey after all the Christmas leftovers, so I was happy to find this recipe using pork.  It was just as good.  I added Italian dressing to the mayo and brushed with olive oil, not butter.  A plate weighing them down on medium heat worked perfectly with whole wheat sub rolls.  Serve with vegetable soup or a salad for a complete meal.

I made this sandwich for an unexpected lunch with friends using leftovers and it went over very well. I didn't use sweet rolls because I didn't have any, but used some french bread slices I had in the freezer. It was a really good lunch with a quick fruit salad and iced tea and I was able to make it with what I had on hand.

Ohmigosh...what a great meal idea! I served it with the tostones and both my husband and I were captivated by the flavors and the fun of cooking together in the kitchen...it took both of us to prepare the sandwiches and cook the tostones....

Well, I guess the person that didn't even TRY to lighten the calories has never had a Philly Steak Sand!!!  THAT has MORE calories,LOL.  This sandwich is awesome the way I made it. Used Miracle whip and prob 1/4 cup for 4 sandwiches. Made with Honey Baked Ham, less salt AND calories, used left over pork, again, less calories AND salt. Used olive oil and regular french rolls. Mind you I only made it that way because thats what we use at home!!!  Tasted GREAT! And Im sure no one would notice!!! Thanks for the recipe!!

What a great sandwich!  I went out and bought a sandwich press specifically for this recipe; I love trying new things.  It was well worth the time and money to be able to serve such an out-of-the-ordinary sandwich to my family.  Having never used a press before this, I followed all directions to the 't'.  Next time, I'll try some variations such as the Italian dressing mentioned.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good, recipe, I made it slightly different.  I used a low carb wrap, cut it in half and grilled the sandwich that way.  I also used sliced turkey instead of ham.  I will also try this the traditional way, and I'm sure it will be just as good, the pickles on the sandwich make it extra tasty.  I also used coarse mustard, which I think makes a difference too.

Really good sandwich.  Used regular bread and sweet bread and butter pickles, because that was all I had.  Turned out great.  Grilled it up like a regular grilled cheese and did not press it down.  Had the heat up too high and the bread browned before the cheese melted, so I just put it in the microwave for a few seconds Loved it.  The bread and butter pickles would be good for those who don't like dill.  Will make it again using the recipe ingredients and the changes I made.

Excellent! I didn't have the traditional Cuban bread and subbed with French Rolls for my husband and a GF Ciabatta Roll for my sandwich. I marinaded a pork tenderloin using a mojo sauce from another recipe on this site, which worked perfectly. I was hoping for more garlic flavor to come through in this recipe and next time will add some garlic to the mayo. I don't have a panini press and simply made these in the cast iron skillet and used my cast iron tortilla press on top of the sandwiches. Simple and tasty Cuban sandwiches we will definitely make again. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a Cuban Sandwich, so named by the Sicilian grocers who made them for the Cuban cigar workers in Ybor City,-Tampa, Florida. They were never made nor eaten in Cuba. Cuban sandwiches originated in Tampa in the early 1890s. The Media Noche sandwich is actually different than this and is usually made on a roll rather than slabs of Cuban bread a.k.a. Pan Cubano. A REAL Cuban Sandwich has only the meats, cheese, butter, yellow mustard & pickles on it. The pressing cam along when a bright cigar worker figured out how to use a label press on a towel-wrapped sandwich along about 1915.

NO ORIGINAL CUBAN SANDWICH, MEDIA NOCHE, CROQUETA PREPARADA, FRITAS, ANY INCLUDE MAYONNAISE. MAYONNAISE IS A LATE COMER AND UNNECESSARY  ADDITION TO A DELICIOUS CUBAN  ORIGINAL. EVERYTHING ELSE IS MUST, BUT DROP THE MAYO PLEASE, IT KILLS THE BLEND.

The taste was very good but I used my George Foreman as a press and I think it dried it out too much. I will definitely try again.

These were good and would make again with just ham or pastrami.    Grilled soft kaiser buns on the George Foreman.

This is the real deal - best cuban sandwich ever!  My husband grilled a peppercorn pork tenderloin which made this sandwich truly authentic.  We also purchased fresh cuban bread.  We don't have a panini grill so I buttered the cuban bread on both sides and weighted the sandwiches down with another cast iron grill.  Outstanding!

This version of the medianoche is great! It was actually the first thing I made with my Cuisinart GR-4N 5-in-1 Griddler after Christmas.  And I've made them many times since.  I'm not gonna lie - I have a texture issue with pickles; so when I make them for me, I mix pickle juice in with the mayo in lieu of putting actual pickles on the sandwich.  That way, the flavor is still there, but the pickle isn't.  Although I prefer it that way, I've also had them with pickles in them (still yummy).  And when I make them for other people, I do it the traditional way with pickles.  This sandwich is always a hit.  It's great drunk food.  It's great comfort food.  And it's one of those "warm your soul" foods that is fantastic after a few hours  of shoveling snow.

This sandwich was called a Cuban Mix in the a restaurant we frequented. I've been making this sandwich for years with ciabatta rolls but am going to make the Cuban Water Bread recipe on this site soon and try it with that. As for the differences in the sandwich recipes here on AR, I chalk it up to each cook's personal touch just as there are many varieties of Southern Fried Chicken and many, many other things.  Make the one you like the best and enjoy! I'll be making this one for our dinner tonight :).

I've made this several times now. I do have to be a bit inventive as I don't have a panini press. What I do have is an old fashioned cast iron waffle maker so our sandwiches are funky looking, but delicious. Tonight I used slices of a pork loin with the ham and Swiss cheese. Made as recipe written. Fun sandwich.

For the "cooked pork", I fried up some thin center cut boneless pork chops with some garlic powder, salt, and cumin. And I know that the "traditional" Cuban sandwich has to have pickles in it, but I cannot STAND pickles, so I subbed in some thin slices of fresh, seeded jalapeno. They gave the sandwiches a bite and some crunch and we were really happy with the results. Quick delicious dinner - thanks!!

Used the Foreman indoor grill, pressed, then cooked 3-4 minutes depending on desired browning of the bread. Delicious and very simple with basic ingredients.

My husband loved this! I cooked it in the crock pot on low for 8 hours, and was so surprised at how tender it came out using an inexpensive cut of pork. I'm not a big fan or oregano, so I'm trying it today with tarragon instead. Thanks for sharing, this one's a keeper!

OMG...Just as good as my favorite Ybor City restaurants in Tampa.  This is a hit!  I used mayo with olive oil in it.  I used a pannini press. I used Cuban pork roast from another Allrecipes recipe.

Very good sandwich...needed a way to use leftover pork loin from Thanksgiving.  Easy, delicious, and overall crowd pleaser...I used the Foreman as well and it was quick and easy with very little clean up.

Very good!  I needed to use up some leftover pork tenderloin, and this did the trick!  I couldn't find sweet rolls (I don't even know what those are!) so I bought Pane Italian rolls.  I went out on a limb and used the mayo, although using it on a heated sandwich sounded gross to me.  I mixed the mayo and mustard together, which the directions don't call for.  This seemed to work out well.  Instead of butter, I used olive oil on the bread, and I grilled on the Georgie for about 4 minutes.  I have no idea what an authentic Cuban sandwich tastes like, but this was really good!

My family loves this recipe. We always make them after having a pork loin or tenderloin the night before, and the Foreman Grill is great for pressing them. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Yummers!  Made no changes to this recipe.  Used Sweet Italian Hogie bread that Kroger sells.  A great way to use up some leftover pork loin from a previous dinner.  The boys LOVED!

Was really good, better if I had a press as using the plate made it slide off.

OMG, this sandwich is awesome! I wasn't sure if it would be that good because it calls for so much meat and cheese, but it was soooo good. I made the recipe exactly as stated using sliced leftover pork roast and was very surprised by how excellent this sandwich tasted. I have never had a medianoche before, so i can't say how authentic it was, but definitely delicious! will be making again.

I stumbled upon this while looking for a way to use up leftover pork tenderloin, and I'm so glad I did! For an even more authentic flavor, I made my own Cuban rolls from a recipe found on recipezaar.  So good!

Like others, I could not find sweet Cuban rolls in my area: I just used a very dough-y sub bun. I would not change anything except subbing EVOO for the butter. I think I would of liked better and it is healthier. The mustard/mayo on mixed lunchmeat sandwiches is something we've done for a long time (we flatten on a George Forman grill, so although this was not unique to us, it was still very good and we will make again.

These are excellent - are now my family's favorite sandwich. My Godson stayed with us and when he left, that's the recipe he wanted. I use giant kaiser buns my local store sells and the kids prefer salad dressing to mayo. Definitely a keeper.

These are good.  I didn't have any pork, so I used ham and turkey.  I know it was not the same, but it was still good.

Recently got a sandwich press as a gift, and my husband LOVED this sandwich.  I used hoagie rolls instead of sweet bread and used bread and butter pickles.  It was very good..

I also made these for the AFC Championship game and they were very nice. I used sweet pickles instead of dill and I loved it that way. My guests enjoyed them as well! Go Pittsburgh!

These sandwiches are wonderful. Only one problem though. Now my husband wants them every day for lunch! Authentic or not,they are a keeper.
