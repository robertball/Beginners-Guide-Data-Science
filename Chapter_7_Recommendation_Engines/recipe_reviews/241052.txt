My mom made this for years.  It's one of my favorites over the holidays.  You won't find an easier, more delicious pie recipe!

I saw this recipe on the back of the Real lemon juice bottle and wanted to see if anyone else had success before I would try it. I added lime zest to the mix and I ate about 3/4's of the pie myself, it is tasty. Though next time I will add a little less lemon juice.

Loved it!  I used a Kebler 2 extra servings graham cracker crust which proved to be too large.  Stick with the standard 8 or 9 inch.

This is a great pie.  Love lemon (anything) and this fits the bill.  I love the creaminess of it and especially the graham cracker crust I used.  (Keebler.)  Will be making this again.
