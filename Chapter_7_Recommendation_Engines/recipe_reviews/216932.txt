I really love this recipe, it is so simple and easy. Sometimes for a slightly sweet touch I melt together some butter and honey, and brush the twists just before I take them out of the oven.

Well, I completely forgot to get the puff pastry at Shop Rite BUT I had Grands rolls from Pillsbury. Took them out of the can, rolled them out and proceeded as the recipe suggests. Cut into strips but did not twist. They were AWESOME! ! ! Also, if you buy the pre-shelled pistachios, you don't need any more salt. Bravo!

So simple, easy and fast but so good! Great combo of flavors and textures with the flaky puff pastry and crunchy pistachios/kosher salt. The only thing I did different was to just leave the twists the length of the pastry (didn't cut into 3" strips) and leave the nuts chopped a little larger. Simplicity at it's best. Thanks for sharing!

Be sure to check if your pistachio nuts are salted and if they are,  cut WAY back on the kosher salt and maybe donâ€™t use any. Easy recipe. My second batch turned out much better with only a small amount of salt.

What a light, delightful appetizer!  I made these as directed, but added a little grated Parmesan as well.  A real crowd pleaser!

I made these for a party I went to and they were a big hit.  I prepared as directed and they turned out superb.  The only change I made was to bake an additional 4 minutes.  Thanks for a great recipe.  Debbie
