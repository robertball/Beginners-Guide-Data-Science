This is the best way to cook tougher cuts of moose or any game meat like this.  It was tender and I could do anything with it after it was steamed. I put a clove of garlic in the boiling water and salt and peppered the moose meat.  My husband said to keep this way of cooking moose handy.

I don't normally cook or eat wild game, but with this recipe I will be.  No wild taste at all, my mom would be proud of you, thank you.
