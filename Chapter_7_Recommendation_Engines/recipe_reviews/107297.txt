This was an amazing crust.  The secret to it is the butter.  I used a shredded parmesan cheese to add to the crust and it was simply amazing!  I agree with Zedar....there isn't enough crust.  I used Pampered Chef deep dish pans and it was really close. If you're expecting to made a beautiful fluted shell, it's not going to happen the way the recipe is presently.  I will add 1/4 cup more flour, 2 more tablespoon of butter and enough water for it to get it to a ball stage.  The taste and flakiness complimented the spinach quiche and ham quiche that I made this evening for dinner.  Both crust turned golden brown, and I didn't prebake the crust.  I will use this recipe again as I experiment with some different quiche recipes that I am trying out on my family.  Thanks for sharing Joanna!  :)

This came together quickly in my Kitchen Aid mixer, I just cut the butter into bitty pieces before adding to the flour. I used this for a bottom crust for a homemade pot pie, using garlic mashed potatoes as a top crust. Turned out great. Next time, I'll not wait until the last minute and make the pie dough in the morning. The longer this crust sits in the fridge, the less likely it is to warm under hot hands. Great recipe! This crust is so flaky and tender.

THANK YOU for this recipe!!  This is my new secret weapon when making quiches.  My other secret weapon is sticking to Julia Child's recipe for quiche!   I've made this twice now, and once I used havarti instead of cheddar, as that's what I had on hand.  The havarti gave the crust a lovely, delicate taste, but beware: Since havarti has a high moisture content, you don't need as much water.   Also, here's a tip for everyone: If you freeze the butter briefly (maybe 10 minutes or so, no longer!) before cutting into small pieces, it makes it much easier.

Much tastier than plain flour/shortening crust. I needed to add a few extra TBSP flour, but flour amounts always vary to some degree anyway. I also like to add about a tsp total of dried herb combinations (basil, oregano, rosemary, thyme) to get a cheese/herb crust. This recipe is a keeper!

Thank you for this wonderful recipe, i made the crust following these directions but made tiny quiche tarts instead. It turned out a little over 24 mini ham,bacon,spinach, and swiss cheese quiche. I've made them a few times, friends and family are dying for the recipe. Very tasty- great results. ** if you are a health nut this is not the quiche crust for you. It was a little greasy but no one complained. My 88 yr. old grandmother ate about 3 or 4 of these mini quiche- and she's a picky eater... lol and then there is my 37 yr old cousin who hate vegetables but tried them despite the spinach content. :-)   Have fun with this recipe everyone its certainly a keeper!

this came out really nice especially for my very first homemade crust.  i only had 4 tbsp butter, so i supplemented it with oil.  it came out great - light and cheesy - perfect complement to the custard i used for my quiche!  thanks!

This is a wonderful piecrust! I made a double batch so I can use the second crust for a chicken pot pie in a day or two. It bakes golden and light, and tastes like a cheese cracker. I used my broccoli-mushroom-onion-bacon-cheddar recipe, using evaporated milk instead of regular. This is the best quiche I've ever made! 

I started to bake the unfilled crust as the directions said, but saw it was shrinking. So I removed it from the oven and stretched it back into shape, filled it with the quiche mixture, and baked it. It came out so good! I recommend that instead of pre-baking this crust you just fill it and bake all at once. Thank you for the great recipe.

I used this crust on top of a vegetable pot pie, and it worked out great!  Wonderful flavor and texture.  The pie baked for 40 minutes at 375 degrees.

Flaky and rich from the cheese.  I was a bit leary of the amount of flour--it's not enough compared to other quiche pastry recipes, but it does work.  I did add a bit more flour than called for so I could get all the butter mixed in.  It definitely needs cooled before rolling out.  I was impatient, so I put in the freezer for a while instead of letting cool in the fridge.  I had more than enough crust for one quiche--maybe those who have had too little have larger pans? I used my regular quiche pan for this, and a regular sized pie pan would've been fine as well.  I used this with the Salsa Sausage Quiche recipe on here.  Thanks for the recipe!

My crust came out a bit crunchy where there was a cheddar chunk, but it may be because I used a hard cheddar.  Otherwise, it was a great success! It was very tasty and complimented the quiche...I used the "Spinach-Quiche" recipe as my custard and the combination was delicious.

I doubled this and made it using the food processor to cut in the butter. I did add a generous pinch of salt as my butter was unsalted and didn't use all the water. I left this in the fridge for about 3 hours then let it sit on the counter for about 10 minutes before rolling out. Perfect compliment to the asparagus and mushroom quiche from this site. I'll definitely use this recipe again. Thankyou Joanna.

I was worried this would not work out, but it was wonderful for the quiche I made (Spinach and Carrot Quiche SUBMITTED BY: CRISTEN1 ).  I was unclear on what breadcrumbs look like, I had to roll it between two pieces of Saran wrap to prevent the dough from sticking to the pin (maybe it wasn't chilled enough) and it wasn't enough dough to cover the sides of my pan.  Nevertheless, my quiche was great and improved by the crust on the bottom.  Why buy frozen when this recipe is so easy and cheap?

This was terrific. I had a little extra so I rolled it out into a small circle, put some shredded beef with a tablespoon of barbecue sauce in the middle, folded it over, sealed it with a fork, and baked it for a 10-15 minutes in the oven along with the crust. A new recipe was born. Yum.

This was a great quick and easy recipe in a pinch. I used it as a base for a egg quiche with breakfast sausage and green/red peppers. I had all of the ingredients on hand and it made just enough to fit a 9 inch round pan. This is a keeper!

I used this crust recipe for a Tasteofhome recipe for vegetable quiche.  I also added some Rosemary in with the crust.  It was a lovely match for the quiche and we will use this every time!  Thank you for the delicious recipe.  I will make a double batch next time because the quiche recipe is large and I had to really stretch the crust.  I loved it!!

This is the best crust! I had no idea you could put cheese in it :) I would definately do 1 and 1/2 of the recipe for a good sized 9" pie crust though. Can't wait to use it again, thanks!

This was a good recipe, Joanna.  It was my first time making a quiche and I chose this cheese crust.  I used cheddar but see where another reviewer used parmesan - I'm sure that is excellent too!  I used a regular 9-inch glass pie dish and did not QUITE have enough crust.  But that did not affect the outcome of the quiche.  I stretched it as far as I could and the quiche did not stick.  It was still easy to serve.  I will use this recipe again.

I made this for Boxing Day this year and it was really nice.  I used Trex instead of butter (It's like shortening) because I thought it might make the crust a bit more flakey.

I used fresh grated parmesan instead of cheddar and it was amazing.  As others have posted, there wasn't enough crust to cover the bottom and sides of the pan so next time I would make more.

It made for a great easy crust for a cheese and pesto quiche. 
The only note I would give is to add a little more of everything to make a bigger batch so you can cover the dish better and use less water.

I needed ANY type of dough recipe for quiche. This turned out great, thank you. I did not use the cheese, as would have been too much cheese for us. Was the first time I was able to use my vintage (1960's or early) Pastry Cutter, QUITE exciting. Turned out lovely, tasty crust ( I added some salt to the dough, just about 1/4 tbs or less ), and my first home made crust !!

This is a lovely recipe. Made it to use with Quiche Lorraine to use up left over Xmas Ham. It went down so well I've made a double batch to pop in the freezer. I did find it only just filled a nine inch flan dish so I'd add another 1/4 cup of flour, another tbsp of butter , a little extra cheese & cold water.

This crust was ok. Easy to make, but not light or flaky. The taste was bland and the cheese did not add anything special. I took the suggestion of another reviewer and added an extra 1/4 cup flour and 2 T. of butter to increase the size. It did fit in the pie plate with this amount. I wouldn't make this again - I prefer Trader Joe's crust.

This is a great easy recipe to use for any quiche. This is the recipe that got my husband to try quiche, which he was very reluctant to do. Now quiche is a part of our regular breakfast schedule and I make it about twice a month. Had my 7 y/o nephew over last weekend to try his first quiche and it was a big hit with him.

maybe I'm just missing something, or just plain weird in the kitchen, but I needed absolutely no water for the dough to ball up nicely.  Good taste!

The cheese also builds stability in this crust.

Just made this tonight and LOVED it!!!!!! Fantastic, very tasty and flaky, but I think I will double the recipe and cook the leftover crust for yummy treats!!! My quiche came out great and didn't stick to the pan at all! Thanks for this wonderful crust!!!!

Delicious.  This works well for a thin quiche.  Even though i added more flour, anyway.  thin quiche being 5 eggs and 1 cup of milk/cream

GREAT! 
It looked weird when adding water (i guess it's because i'm not used to making pie crust!) and it was a bit sticky, but i just refrigerated it and added a little bit of flour later.
I do agree that you need to stretch the recipe a little and add flour, butter, etc... if you want to fill your pan without having to roll the dough too thin.
I personally doubled the recipe for two crusts and added 1 tbsp butter and 1/8cup flour, it was ok, but it could have taken more.
Thx so much Joanna!
