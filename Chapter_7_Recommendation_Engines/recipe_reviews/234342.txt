I was skeptical, but these were very, very good!! I'm not sure what asian chili paste is, and couldn't find it at my grocery store, so I subbed for sriracha sauce.  Very spicy, but soo good!! I garnished with lime wedges as well as the scallions.

i want to post my updated review first because i was able to follow the recipe more closely.. this came out super good.. i finally had the chance to marinate the wings with the sauce.. only sub was lemon juice for the lime.. i liked them better as leftovers the next day.. i think this would go great on boneless, skinless chicken breasts/thighs as kabobs.. this recipe is a keeper.. ty again for the recipe ~~ORIGINAL REVIEW: the sauce is very tasty.. i had to sub 1/8 tsp ground ginger for the fresh and i added about 1/4-1/2 tsp sesame oil for extra pop.. im sure this would make a great marinade.. ty for the recipe

Made this as a sauce I put on wings I had baked in oven to crispy, then I dipped them in the sauce and put in oven for a few minutes to warm through. It's such a flavourful sauce. Nice and spicy but not overpowering. Delicious. Will make again.

Update Feb/18 - made these in the oven last week and they were really good. 20 minutes 425 degree each side - so this how I'll do these from now on. Hot but tasty! Old review: These were okay but next time I think I'll bake them in the oven. I'm not a big fan of the charred skin from bbq'ing them. Or perhaps I need to learn how to better bbq chicken wings. The flavor was pretty good though, hubby liked them a lot and they were easy enough to prepare. So I will try them again next wing night and see what oven baked is like. Or learn how to bbq without charring them beyond recognition.
