Well, I was supposed to share this drink tonight with a *friend* who ditched me. Her loss, this stuff is like liquid whipped cream wih a bang. Delish!

Lisa J is right in her review, it does taste like liquid whipped cream with a punch. This is one of those drinks that you can easily slurp down 3 and then feel it when you stand up. Nothing says Happy Holidays on a cold winter evening while wrapping gifts, quite like this. Enjoy!

Nyah! Nyah! LisaJ! I got here FIRST! :) this was just outstanding! I only had the Mint Bailey's in the house (actually, used up the last wee bit!) and this is something that will be an annual treat! Packs a punch so don't have too many! ;)

Santa informed me that he prefers this to the milk with his cookies.   My husband loved it as-is.  I added 1/2 oz. of light cream to mine.  Happy Holidays!
