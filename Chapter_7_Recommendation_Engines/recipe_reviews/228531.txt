I made this brine per the posted recipe.  My fried turkey (13 lbs) came out excellent. The bird was moist and absolutely delicious. My family loved it.  I let the turkey sit in the brine for about 15 hours and let it dry for 2 hours before frying it at 350F for 45 minutes.

Everyone loved this recipe. This has to be the best tasting turkey we have made for Thanksgiving or Christmas. We had friends over later and the turkey was all eaten up! Amazing. Thank you for sharing.

I have fried a number of turkeys and I always brine them before frying.  This is by far the best turkey brine I have used.  My daughter-in-law told me this was the best turkey she had ever eaten.

I picked this recipe because of its name (married to a Matt) haha.....This recipe was easy as far as brine recipes go.  I brined my turkey for 11 hours then deep fried it.  Flavor was excellent, not overpowering just a great flavor.  Bird was juicy and tender and skin was beautiful brown. I will continue to use this one for Thanksgiving!!
