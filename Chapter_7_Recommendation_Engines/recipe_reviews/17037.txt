Very good cookies!! I really liked the use of only one stick of butter. As to the baking time, as with ALL cookies, baking time will be effected by the size of your cookies, what kind of cookie sheet you use and how accurate your oven is, so don't really think that should be how you rate a recipe. I used a 1 tablespoon scoop, as opposed to a spoon, and got 60 cookies. I baked some on a dark, non-stick sheet and those only took 10 minutes. I made some on a shiny, "air" cookie sheet and those took 14 minutes to get brown but with either, the taste was GREAT!! I used orange essense cranberries and natural applesause and couldn't be more pleased with the taste and texture. These don't spread much, either, so kind of "patted" the scoop down a bit to get a flatter cookie. Definitely a good recipe for someone watching their fat and fiber!!

I made these again and I measured everything perfectly and they turned out great. I suggest that if they seem a little uncooked in the middle, that you put them back in the oven for another minute or 2. So in my oven they are having to be cooked for a full 10 minutes. Also, I put twice the amount of chocolate chips. I and my kids still love them as much as the first time and I am taking them to a GRITS meeting tonight (Gals Raised In The South) so then I'll find out the true reviews.

I scoured all the reviews here, trying to figure out if these were really chewy- or cakey.  Well, turns out they were cakey.  I don't know how you would make them chewy- they do have applesauce in them, which to me means cakey!  Besides that, they are very tasty, just not texture-wise what I was looking for.  At least they're healthier than regular cookies.  1/2 cup butter for 35 cookies is great IMO.  I'm thinking quick cook oats would have been better in these as well.  Didn't change a thing except to add a little cinnamon, and had to cook them longer.

These were delicious.  I made a few changes for a healthier version: 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup raw cane sugar, 1 cup wheat flour, 1/2 cup all purpose flour.  I also replaced the butter with non-hydrogenated margarine.

I was looking for an alternative oatmeal raisin cookie containing applesauce and I'm pretty happy with this one.  I omitted the chocolate chips and walnuts because I didn't have them and replace the white sugar with honey. I wound up baking them a lot longer than anticipated -- almost 18 minutes. They were slightly crunchy on the outside and wonderfully chewy on the inside.

Mmmmmm... These turned out really yummy.  They mixed up very nicely.  I used cinnamon applesauce and omitted the walnuts and upped both the raisins and chocolate chips 1/4 cup each.  I baked them at 360 for 13 minutes on airbake sheets and this seemed just right.  My oven seems to run cooler.  I did forget to grease the sheets first and didn't realize my error until all sheets were covered w/ dough but still managed to get them off with a thin metal spatula. I will make these many times again.

These were amazing! I changed the recipe slightly by adding slightly less sugar, 3 egg whites, 2 1/2 cup oatmeal, 1/2 cup wheat germ, and decreased the butter by 3 Tlb. Very moist and yummy.

Would not consider these to be chewy. They are soft and fluffy and don't have a whole lot of taste Not a bad cookie but def not great will keep searching for a chewy oatmeal cookie.

These were pretty good.  As another mentioned, you should keep them in for the full 10 minutes because I took my first batch out after 8-9 minutes and the insides weren't fully cooked.  Try to look for a browning on the bottom before removing.  Also, I didn't care much for the walnuts in there so I think I'll increase the chocolate chips and raisins next time while losing the walnuts.

I wasn't impressed. I followed the recipe exactly and they weren't chewy at all! There was way more flour taste than oatmeal.

Great cookies.  I made them with Splenda brown sugar and Splenda sugar for my diabetic son.  They came out light and fluffy which my husband loves about them besides the taste.  A win-win for all of us!

We used unsweetened apple sauce, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and dried cranberries instead of raisins. They were thick, chewy, and really delicious! Next time, we're trying 1/2 cup of shredded coconut!

I followed the recipe right till the end.  The batter seemed way to soupy but since i had already stirred in the oats, i could not add more flour as others had suggested.  I added about another cup of oats, and they came out perfect!

These were okay, the 15 yr old liked them, the 50 year old didn't, not sure why. I thought they were okay (Revised opinion, I grew to absolutely love these cookies! Ate a bunch of them over the next wekk, and am back for more. Followed the recipe exactly.

Pretty darn good!  Was just looking for a way to use up some extra applesauce and because it was already 7:30 pm I was looking for something that I could make QUICKLY for my family for a late night snack.  These totally fit the bill.  I was out of raisins and nuts so had to leave those out; made half of the batch plain and the other half with the full 1/2 c of chocolate chips - super chewy and yummy either way.  I made sure to bake these for 8 minutes - then checked back every 30 seconds beyond that till I felt they were ready to pull out (that's how I bake all my cookies b/c we live in CO where things dry out QUICKLY).  TY for the great recipe!

These were really good and easy.  I didn't have choco chips so I had to skip out on these.  I added just a lil' less sugar and replaced some flour with wheat flour.  All I had was self rising and it worked for all of you skeptics out there.  I used pecans for the nuts.  Yummy, thanks! RuthY  Ruth

Excellent cookies. I did use egg replacer and in stead of applesauce I happened to have a fruit based fat substitute and used that. I also added a few extra chips.

I have only air bake cookie pans.  I decided to try & bake one pan with cooking spray & the other with parchment paper.  I'm not sure if the p. paper soaks up moisture or what, but the pan made with the p. paper were absolutely PERFECT!  And still chewy & wonderful.  The pan sprayed with the cooking spray were pretty horrible....just gooey & not good.  AND, I couldn't get the darn cookies off the pan!  SO anyway, that may help you.  As for taste, WOW!  Amazing flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly, except used mini chocolate chips.

My daughter made these cookies today and the whole family went crazy over them!  She only added chocolate chips and no raisins or almonds, but they would have been fabulous with them.  This is a definite keeper!

These are great. They are really soft and look a little undercooked on top at first, but the center is perfect. I might like to add a little more applesauce next time instead of using two eggs.

These are good but nothing exceptional. I think I'm more of a crispy oatmeal cookie eater. I do like that they are a little bit healthier than some other recipes though!

Chewy, sweet, moist, and delicious!  My toughest critic even gave them 5 stars.  Be sure to cook until nicely brown all over and not just on the edges.  Brown just on the edges gave an almost doughy cookie.  Tinted brown all over was awesome!

I just made these cookies exactly as directed in recipe,& they are fantastic! I have never made cookies from scratch this perfect. They are delicious with a cold glass of light soy milk (Silk).I don't usually care for raisins but they are healthy & go perfect in this. I made these in a toaster oven on a dark cookie sheet because my big oven is broken,& they still baked perfect. I did notice the bottoms were browning & tops weren't quite done so I turned the heat down to 300 & cooked for five more minutes..worked great! They are chewy & delicious! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe. I have been looking for a chewy oatmeal recipe for a while. I can't wait to bake some for my granddaughters when they come to visit.

These came out thick, hearty, and delicious. Not so much chewy as hearty, like a delicious healthy snack.  We used cranberries rather than raisins (for more of a tart-sweet contrast), skipped the walnuts (allergies), and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, which brought out the chocolate flavor more. Ghirardelli semi-sweet chips (as they melt the best, as per Cook's Illustrated, and experience!), and baked them on parchment paper on a pan (instead of buttering the pan). They were thick and delicious! A great recipe!

I wanted to make more a of a power cookie. I doubled the applesauce and added a hefty 1/4 cup of peanut butter. I used 1/2 cup lightly packed brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar, and 1/4 cup of honey instead of the original sugar instructions. The honey was a great addition, giving it a bit fuller savory flavor. I didn't add the chocolate so for extra flavour to replace it I added cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. I used almonds instead of walnuts. I also opted for whole wheat flour.  This made for a more spicy savory cookie than the orignal sweet and chocolate.

These are really good! I just made them (with a few tweaks) and I can't stop eating them. I used 1c. all-purpose flour + 1/2c whole wheat flour; 2c oats + 1/2c oat bran + 1/2c wheat germ; and 1/2c each dried cherries, sweetened shredded coconut, and chocolate chips. I had planned to use walnuts but completely forgot, so I'll just have to make them again soon!

I really liked this recipe. I added both chocolate and butterscotch chips to it and it was great. My husband doesn't like nuts and I didn't have any raisins so I didn't add those things, but I think that the choc. chips, raisins and nuts would be great.

I added cinnamon and replaced the raisins with dried cherries. 
This recipe is very dry and not at all "chewy"... Very little flavor.

The chocolate chips and raisins are very yummy together! I add 1/2 tsp cinnamon. I have also thrown in extra shredded zucchini before (just be sure that all excess water is drained off first).

It's the best oatmeal recipe I've tried.  I cooked it for 12 mins.  And it came out perfectly.  The first batch was in the oven for exactly 10; and it easily crumbled.  The 12 mins is perfect.

great cookie!! I left out the chocolate chips and walnuts and added more rasins.Very chewy which i love! One thing though, you must watch the cooking time! I pulled mine out on the time suggested and they were not finished cooking. You may have to cook them longer.....otherwise they come out a bit sticky! But other then this a great cookie! I will be making again and again! thank you much!

These are fantastic!!  Probably my favorite cookie I've made from allrecipes.  I followed the directions exactly except added 1/2 tbsp of vanilla instead of the 1 tsp.  They are sooo wonderful, especially right from the oven.  They stay moist and chewy when put in a container. Yum! I want to make another batch today!  I got 30 larger cookies from this batch but did have to bake them for 20 minutes.  Even then they were not 'crispy' enough for my husband -- but I like them a little bit soft.

Amendments include: 
-no nuts (didn’t feel like adding them)
- no raisins in the house and Hubby wouldn’t eat sundried cranberries (even if I had some) so in went some leftover candied cherries, chopped
- 1.5x the chocolate chips (because) I had leftover dough-space from not adding nuts)

Super yummy, soft and chewy oatmeal cookie. Just what I wanted. In my opinion, they are a bit too sweet though. I think I will reduce the sugar a bit next time. I also put dried cranberries in. I think adding 1/2 cup of Rice Krispies could add another level to this cookie too. Overall, AWESOME!!!

These were great! Used coconut oil instead of butter and had not nuts or chocolate so is doubled the raisins.  Would add another cup of raisins next time.

I omitted the chocolate chips as these were to serve to friends who some do not eat chocolate. I also added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. I made larger cookies than the recipe called for, so it took 14 minutes. We also live over 6000 feet, so I added a1 tablespoon of flour and another tablespoon of applesauce. Ithey are chewy not at all crunchy. I would next time add another 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts for added crunch. I would definitely make this recipe again!

These are absolutely delicious!  I got exactly 3 dozen, but I probably could have gotten more had I not made the first pan so big.  I've tried other recipes and they've either been too hard, or chewy but didn't spread out.  These are plenty chewy and they spread just fine!  I added dried cranberries  and walnuts.  I could have added more cranberries, though.  Maybe even almost a cup, but they are still delicious! I believe the softness comes from the brown sugar, because other recipes call for less brown sugar and they are not as chewy. This recipe is definitely a keeper! Thank you for sharing!

Chewy Oatmeal Cookies I Haiku: "I've made these a ton. Over time, I've changed some things, but they're always good!" The first time that I made these, I followed the recipe, other than dropping the walnuts, and found it to be a nice, cakey, not overly sweet, just right cookie. I make them fairly frequently and oftentimes replace the eggs w/ 2 TB flax meal mixed w/ 1/4 c. water, adding wheat germ, and/or reducing the sugars. I've never been disappointed w/ the original, or occasionally-adjusted recipe!

These are pretty good, but not VERY good. Which is VERY good for my big family: they last longer! 
They are a bit on the dry side(not chewy), so a cup of tea goes very well with them.

My favorite oatmeal cookie recipe!! I had been looking for a good recipe for plump, chewy cookies and after reading reviews I decided to try it. My cookies turned out so thick and yummy and my dad (whose very picky) loved them. I did add about a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and omitted the nuts and raisins then upped the choc chips to 1 cup. Definitely recommend this one!

My first attempt at making cookies and I was very pleased ! The only reason why I'm rating only 4 stars and not the full 5 is that I didn't stick exactly to the recipe, made the following changes: used whole wheat flour, no nuts, doubled the chocolate chips. However, these were not really chewy. They turned out crisp on the outside and soft and cake like on the insides. We loved them. Will definite make these again !

These are absolutely amazing. They are moist and delicious. I made a half batch raisin and nuts and the other choc chip and nuts. I used a tablespoon to spoon onto baking sheet and bakesd for 10 minutes. Will use this recipe again!

I love these cookies. The chocolate chips were left out as I prefer just raisins and walnuts and these were increased to 3/4 cups of each. I used cinnamon applesauce from one of the idividual little cups. I especially like that you can bake them for about 12 minutes for a chewier cookie and a little more if you prefer your cookies more crisp and they still taste delicious.

These were great! I took the advice of a few others and cooked them for a little bit longer (12 minutes) to make sure they weren't too soft. I omitted the chocolate, walnuts and raisins, and the cookies were still fantastic!

These were a little dry to me.  But my kids and husband liked them.  My husband said they were not very sweet which is just the way he likes his oatmeal cookies, so he ate these up quickly.

I love this chewy cookie recipe! I did not add the nuts or raisins because my son does not like them, and I used mini-chocolate chips because that's all I had. After eating about ten of these cookies I decided they were too addictive to stay in my house, so I took them to work the next day. Several people asked me for the recipe.

This recipe is amazing, it takes well to modifications and produces amazing and flavorful cookies, all while keeping things fairly healthy! I love to cook for my roommates, and they're trying to eat healthier, this makes a great dessert for any dish.

These cookies were sooo good! Very moist and chewy with a lot of flavor. I added more spices (allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger) and some whole wheat flour. I made half the batch with just chocolate chips and sliced almonds, and then added shredded coconut and craisins to that for the second half. These are really great.

I really enjoyed this recipe, and so did my mom AND her daycare kids! So it's a good recipe for all ages... I added 1 tsp. cinnamon, and I think that without it, the cookies wouldn't have been quite so good.  They're awesome fresh out of the oven, but even better the next day! I baked some for 8 minutes, and they came out looking too raw, so the next batch i did for 10, which seemed too long, but both ended up tasting delicious! I would definitely recommend this recipe!

I've been looking for a really dense, chewy oatmeal cookie recipe and haven't quite found one yet, however this one is still pretty good.  I think I may have overcooked the first batch by a couple of minutes-they were not burnt by any means but came out very light and fluffy rather than chewy.  The second batch I made sure to watch the cooking time..I'd say 8 min max, and I had a bit of a denser cookie which I liked.  The taste is great and I did enjoy this recipe.

I made them with over a cup of raisins in place of the chocolate chips and walnuts.  Very good.  YOU MUST let them cool for 5 before you move them.  I made these for a BBQ for my husband's work and I used a mini muffin tin to freeze a dozen uncooked and took them as a hostess gift.  Also, I added some Saigon Cinnamon.  They were excellent!  Better than the mix you buy.  FYI!  It seems like a lot of salt, but it is needed.  I skimped and baked a test cookie only to add more to the mix later.

I gave these 4 stars because I think they have a great flavor and would probably have a better texture had I followed the recipe to the letter. I was wanting to make a healthy cookie, so I made the following changes: 1c. whole wheat flour & 1/2c. all-purpose. For sweetness I used 1/3c. brown sugar, 1/3c.sucanat & 1/3c. honey. Added 1 tsp. cinnamon, increased raisins to 1c. and omitted chocolate chips & nuts. The dropped cookies of the 1st batch didn't spread out when baked, so I pushed them down with the back of a spoon for the remaining batches, but that made them too crumbly. The 1st batch actually held together better. I will try this again!

I took the advice of other reviewers and baked my first two sheets of cookies longer than stated on the recipe.  They were overcooked and not chewy at all.  My final sheet of cookies was put in for 8 minutes and turned out perfectly.  I would recommend that you put the cookies in and watch for when the edges start turning brown but are still a little shiny on top - that way they set up but are still chewy. I added 1/2 tsp ground cloves and 1 tsp ground cinnamon, omitting the chocolate chips, because I like my oatmeal cookies with some spice.

These cookies were amazing.  My family and daycare kids loved them.  I had to cook them for 15 minutes instead of 10 minutes but other wise perfection.

These cookies are good, I didn't think they were chewy, though.  I added 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. allspice, 1/2 tsp. cloves, 1/2 c. prunes, a full c. of golden raisins, omitted the chocolate chips.

These are pretty good cookies.  The only alterations I made was adding a little cinnamon and used egg substitute.  I also didn't have any chocolate chips...I will use next time to help with the sweetness factor.  Cookies also didn't spread out at all, definitely had to cook for 12 minutes.  But they still taste good!

Great recipe!!  I like raisins better than chocolate chips, but no one else does in my  house :-).  Either way was great. But since today I didn't have any raisins, I went for chopped up apples (I used fuji apples) and added a little bit of cinnamon and nutmeg. Delicious!!!

These were ok.  I ended up making them slightly larger, 30 cookies instead of 36, and cooking them for 13 minutes for fear that they wouldn't be cooked enough pursuant to other readers' comments, and they were cooked a bit too mutch.  Not very chewy, more cakey.

If you grease the cookie sheets the cookeis spread out too far, though they do remain chewy. I would not make this recipe again, there are far better recipes.

These cookies were perfect! I made them for my son's daycare, so I went light on the sugar and upped the applesauce a bit. I also substituted 1 cup of whole wheat flour. I read the reviews first, so I carefully checked the cookies before taking them out of the oven. I cooked them for 11 minutes, and I got lots of compliments on these. Oh yeah-- since these were made for toddlers, I left out the nuts and added a sprinkling of butterscotch chips and just used more raisins. Yum!

I used whole wheat pastry flour instead of white flour, cut out the nuts, and used 3/4 c raisins and 3/4 c chocolate chips (certified nut free).  Yummy!

Oh my goodness, I made these with an egg substitute (my daughter is allergic to egg whites) for my huge family, they were gobbled up in a matter of minutes! They were a big hit

This recipe was amazing.  Changing the cook-time to about 11 minutes, these cookies came out perfectly chewy in the right places and lasted like that for days without getting mushy or too cakey.  I added carmel swirled chocolate chips instead of walnuts or regular chips, and let me just say that between my family and my boyfriend's family, these cookies only lasted about 2 days.

Great cookies! I made one batch with butterscotch chips instead of chocolate and craisins instead of raisins, and also a regular batch.  They were both good.  Baked for 13 minutes.  Thanks for the recipe!
