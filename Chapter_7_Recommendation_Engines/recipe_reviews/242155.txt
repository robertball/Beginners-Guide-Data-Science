We made this for Super Bowl LI and served it on a hamburger bun with coleslaw.
I added a diced hot pepper (poblano) with the garlic to the chicken cavity. I also used yogurt rather than mayo (just because the yogurt was close to expiry).
The sauce was prepared the night before. I usually substitute beer or wine for water when cooking to enhance and/or add flavour. This recipe doesn't need it!

I made with chicken breasts.. I dont care for dark meat. I cooked this for 3-4 hours in high.. shredded meat and put back in for an hour. I didnt get much flavor at first, but when I added the sauce.. it was great. Loved the tang of the vinegar

My family definitely enjoyed this, though I cooked the chicken a little differently.  I didn't have a whole chicken but I did have 3 bone-in chicken breasts totaling just under 5 lbs.  I put the onions in the bottom, added the chicken, topped with the spices, and covered with water on high until the chicken was cooked through and falling off the bone before shredding and tossing with the sauce.

I made this with 2.5 pounds of boneless skinless chicken breast.  Cooked it for 3 hours on high, shredded it and then did a couple more hours on low.  Made it as written other than that.  It is delicious!!  This is my First recipe review if that tells you anything

Oh my goodness this recipe is fabulous!!!!!!!! I used 4 boneless skinless chicken breast for my husband and myself, and it turned out great!! Just amazed at how great the sauce tastes on the chicken recipe.
I also used Tricolor Rotini "Ronzoni Garden Delight" to serve the chicken dish on with a side Deli vegetable salad, and garlic bread.
I got the idea to use Rotini, and the vegetable salad from one of the other reviewers, thanks!! As she said, I too had a lot of leftovers probably for 2 more dinners, reheat or to make into another whole other dinner idea. Very easy and cost effective and really yummy!!! What more could you ask for for a great recipe!

Very good and something really different.  I made as directed and we enjoyed it over vegetable spaghetti.  I saved part of the chicken breast to use in a salad for the following nights dinner.  I thinned down the delicious BBQ sauce and used it as a dressing for the salad.  I made the BBQ up in the morning, so that it had all day to meld.  This made a lot of food for 2 people, and I have enough froze for 2 more meals.  A delicious recipe, that I will be making again.  I served this with sliced tomatoes and cucumbers.

I thought this was very good. I also used chicken pieces, legs, boneless thighs and breast.I cooked mine on high the one hour and on low about three. Shredded the meat and put it back in slow cooker for forty-five minutes. I did not add the Sauce because I was not sure my husband would eat it so I made regular sauce also. He ended up eating the Alabama barbecue sauce and liked it.
I had leftovers ,and for lunch I heated chicken with sauce, poured over Warmed Tostito Cantina chips, added black olives and Montery jack cheese. Heated until cheese melted. Great nachos!!

I used a mix of boneless skinless breasts and thighs....and I wrapped each chicken around a clove of garlic.
I refrigerated the chicken overnight; heated and shred it the next day.  I added the sauce - I went a little more heavy handed on the cayenne in that recipe - and simmered it all over low heat for another hour or so......NUM NUM!  We gobbled it up as is....but next time we're doing pulled bbq chicken open face swiss melts.... :o ......and then really anywhere I'd use a shredded pork!

I followed the recipe exact but I used 3 pounds of chicken breast (the grocery didn't have whole chickens) and I didn't have liquid smoke. This was amazing! I invited my parents over for dinner and I was a little bummed because I would have liked leftovers. Just kidding, but I can't wait to make it again!

Had chicken legs on hand so I used them to make this dish.  I didn't use a crock pot, instead put them in a pan and cooked until they fell apart.  Tasty!  I'll make these again!

Excellent. Made as the recipe was written. Chicken was very moist and tender. I will definitely make this again.

This came out pretty good for such a simple recipe. Not your typical BBQ. What really stands out is the sauce. Drizzling some sauce on the chicken afterwards is what gives it most of its flavor. The pulled chicken by itself does taste good it just doesn't have enough flavor on its own to really stand out. I will make again but I might add a bit more spice to kick the flavor up a notch. BTW, I made this with some regular old chicken breasts and it still came out good.

I used a whole chicken and found this to be a lot of work. While eating, I had to watch for bones. Next time, I think I will use chicken breasts instead. And, there was no much taste.

This is insanely good. Changes I did:
1. Used about 1.5 pounds of boneless/skinless breast and about 1.5 pounds of boneless/skinless thighs.
2. Doubled the dry mix and liquid smoke.
3. Doubled the white sauce.
4. Slow cooked for 7 hours rather then 8 hours
Super recipe!!

I guess alabama bbq is just not for us.  I followed the recipe exactly except used a whole cut-up chicken, but the flavors just didn't do it for us.  The addition of the sauce helped but just didn't pack enough flavor for us.

Loved this receipt. I made it with three chicken breasts, added some mushrooms, other than that I changed nothing. I served it on spaghetti squash.

I made the chicken--cooked it 9 hours on low & it was great.  I served it with Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce instead of the mayo based sauce in the recipe.  Everyone loved it.

Chicken was very moist. I used four thighs.  We didn't care for the sauce, will something on it next time. Also I used smokey paprika.
