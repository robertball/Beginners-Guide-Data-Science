Cheese spread with bacon isn't available in my corner of the world, so I used cream cheese instead.  After mashing with a potato masher I didn't like the texture, so I put it through the blender. The result was a creamy, delicious soup.  I was going to add bacon, but thought it tasted great the way it was. It's not a good diet food because of the high fat and calories, but it's an excellent comfort food and treat.  The three servings produced were quite large.

I would have given this recipe 5 stars if it hadn't just turned into mashed potatoes when I made it.  I used homemade chicken stock instead of water and bouillon but when  I cooked it like the recipe called for the potatoes absorbed all the liquid and all I was left with was mashed potatoes.  I used 3 medium sized potatoes and ended up adding about another 2 cups of stock.  I also used an 8 oz block of cream cheese instead of the cheese spread which I added and then pureed the soup.  I added 6 slices          of bacon cooked crisp and chopped up. It tasted fantastic and everybody in my family loved it.  Will definitely be making this one again.

I cooked extra bacon (besides the bacon in the cheese spread) and chopped it up and added it to the soup.

It's a fast and easy soup to make, but tastes like you spent a lot more time.  I increased the ingredients for a church potluck, and it was a big hit.

This was really easy to make with a very satisfying flavor. I used cream cheese and 6 slices of bacon. I also added garlic powder, black pepper and a little bit of salt.

This recipe was amazing. If you have kids and they wont eat the onion, try blending it so its more like a puree. It was absolutely delicious!!!

I really liked how this turned out. It wasn't  a very, very long preparation, and that worked well for me. I just needed a way to get rid of some half cooked potatoes. This soup was the answer. Of course, since this was a meal saver, I wasn't prepared. You may laugh, but I didn't have:
1. Chicken boullion; but I replaced it with beef bouillon (uhhh is that okay?)
2. That cheese spread with bacon; I replaced it with shredded cheddar cheese and bacon bits, LOL :D (Now that is NOT okay, haha! )
3. A potato masher; I just used an egg beater... '~'
I am a kitchen amateur. This is the first recipe I've done on this site!!! I just joined allrecipes yesterday so I could improve my cooking and baking, so by the time school is back in session, I'll be good enough for Thanksgiving & Christmas baking... I hope... :) Thank you so much Ms. Hugg for posting this recipe. Even an amateur like me could make this taste good!

This was delicious! I used the cream cheese as suggested in one review because I didn't have any cheese spread, but otherwise followed the recipe and it was terrific! My picky eaters loved it and I'll have to triple the recipe in the future.

I tweaked this recipe and it is so easy and awesome! I used 5 to 6 potatoes, 3 cans chicken broth, 1 to 1/2 cups of carrots, and 1 onion. Then, after the potatoes and carrots were done cooking, I put 8 to 10 ounces of shredded cheddar cheese. I took it off the burner a minute or two after I added the cheese. And I did NOT mash the potatoes.  It's so delicious and didn't take me very long. I even left most of the skin on the potatoes. I just took off the eyes and any dark or bad spots. This saved me a lot of time.  Thanks for the basic recipe idea!

Awesome! All I added was a splash of cream, montreal stk seasoning and used real cheddar cheese and real bacon. Sprinkled with a few chopped green onions on top.

doubled the recipe, added whipping cream to help thicken the broth. Used three chicken bouillon cubes and poultry seasoning. Used colby jack cheese since that was all i had. Fried the onions in the bacon grease to add more flavor.

My 9th grader is taking cooking as an elective in school, and missed the unit on soups.  So his teacher told him to look up a recipe for potato soup and make it at home.  He chose this and I'm glad that he did.  It was easy enough for him to make and tasted great.  We didn't have the bacon cheese spread so he took the reviews here and used a block of cream cheese and topped with bacon.  YUM!  ...and even better because my son made it for me
