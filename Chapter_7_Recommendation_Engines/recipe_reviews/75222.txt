Absolutely fantastic!  I never rate a recipe without doing it exactly as written.  The instructions missed the bacon fat which was in the ingredient list (I remembered to include it).  It was very good - a thick, melt-in-your mouth, hot dog "tempura!"  In my second batch, I replaced the corn meal with crushed Onion Flavored Sun Chips, reduced the salt by half, and added 1 tsp paprika and 1/2 tsp onion powder.  The sugar in the recipe cooks the batter very fast, so I used room-temperature hot dogs before dipping it into the batter.  An A.B. TIP: Put batter into a glass for easier dipping.  The resulting flavors were exciting and surprising!  When deep frying, they didn't want to flip to cook the other side, so I weighed them down with a perforated disk.  So wonderful!  Perfect shape, texture and taste.  TRY THIS, FOLKS!

I had been searching for a homemade recipe and found this!! 
Took the advice on using a tall glass to dip in!! Great tip!
I also tried cutting the hot dogs in half for a bite sized treat! Also, I had the oven on a low 200 F to keep the dogs warm until served...

I love this recipe. I had to make additional batter, about 2 1/2 times the original amount (we like a good coating). I also dipped the raw hot dog in flour before dipping it into the batter, which I also put in a tall cup. Great recipe.

Better late than never!!!  I'm soon to be 75 years old and have made enough corn dogs in my time to supply the Super Bowl.  Finally!!  The best tasting batter I have EVER made.  It has to be the buttermilk and baking soda that makes the difference.  Roby, all you need are a few helpful hints and you will be ready for the county fair. :)  1.  To keep the batter from sliding off the wieners, dust them with flour before putting them in the batter.  The flour acts as a glue for the batter. 2.  Put the batter in a tall glass...you can dip the wiener down into it.  3. As you are pulling the wiener from the batter, gently twirl the stick. This helps keep the batter on, too.  It's all about keeping the batter neatly coating the wiener!!  4.  The last trick is...(and you have to work sort of fast...) When you take the corndog out of the batter and put it in the hot grease, hold it upright, put it about 2 inches down in the grease and hold it about 3 seconds, then carefully drop it in the grease.  I'm not sure what this does but it works like a charm and my corn dogs never split open.  Okay!  That's it.  Time to eat the corn dogs I just made.  I already had the best looking corn dogs in the state...now I have the best tasting, too!!!  Thanks.

when I wrote this recipe it was to cut up the hot dogs into thirds. My deep fryer is too small to put sticks into the dogs. I guess they can change directions.

We wanted something fun, fried, and quintessentially American to be the star of our 4th of July feast, and these really fit the bill. We used veggie dogs and omitted the bacon drippings, and made sure the dogs were at room temperature before dusting with corn starch and dipping in the batter. Pulling them out of the batter with a twisting motion worked beautifully to keep the batter on the dog. As soon as I put one in the deep fryer, my husband dove in with tongs and pulled them up from the bottom of the fryer by the stick so they wouldn't adhere to the fryer basket. We drained these on a rack over a paper towel lined pan, and kept them warm in a 200 degree oven until all were finished. We ate these with traditional yellow mustard slathered on with a brush, just like they did it at the local corn dog stand when I was a child. Hot, diggedy, corn dogs! These are just the BEST.

A great corndog recipe. We also cut the hotdogs up and cooked them in the batter. Anyone out there know how to keep the batter on the hot dogs?

This was a great recipe. Was perfect for family movie night and the kids and hubby were asking when we were having it again before they were even done! One suggestion though. Dust the hot dogs in flour before battering them so the batter doesn't fall off, grease splattered everywhere with the first one but after i used flour no more problems.

Awesome taste!  We buy these at the grocery store, but they are so expensive I looked here for an alternative.  I used the batter to make onion rings as well which turned out very crispy and tasty.  Make sure you dry the dogs off first and coat in flour so that the batter will stick.  Thanks for sharing.

These turned out really well. I've tried a few other corn dog batters and this was by far the best. I left out the bacon drippings and it didn't seem to matter since they were great.

I was't very impressed.  Fairly easy to prepare, used the flour on the dogs trick, suggested by others.  Didn't really taste like fair corn dogs......

This is a superb corn dog recipe! I initially made this using the exact ingredients listed and it was delicious but ended up changing some because they were unavailable in our house.  I discovered that substituting the exact amount of buttermilk with plain yogurt produced such a wonderful flavor which is even, to me, tastier than buttermilk.  I honestly won't be using butter milk again.  Also, I prefer a thicker and cakey dough for my corn dogs and lessening baking powder to 1 teaspoon and baking soda to 1/2 tsp made it perfect to me. Also, I tried making this without sugar and it was still very delicious and cooking it at a lower temp (160 c) made it crispy on the outside while still very moist on the inside.

These turned out so good!  I made sure the hot dogs were very dry and rubbed them in a little corn starch so that the batter would stick really good. I love this batter! I did one with a cheese stick instead of a hot dog. OMG!!! Yum!

Dude and Dudettes,

I fed a slew of coworkers with this recipe and they went nuts! They transformed from adults into children before my very eyes, as they devoured these delicious treats. 
I made a double batch and had to add a little more flour to get the thickness I desired. It was enough for 16 Nathans hot dogs and a few twinkies, oreo's , almond joy and snicker bars. Even the most reserved protester rolled their eyes as they took a bite of that coated almond joy- oh, i forgot this was about strictly corn dogs. Anyways-  two big thumbs up!

I just made these and turned out great. I don't have a deep fryer so just used oil in the bottom of one of my electric skillets turned to 350. Then used only one pack of cloverdale meats franks (red hotdogs). I cut them in thirds to make mini corn dogs. Dried them, rubbed with a small amount of corn starch and then let rest until room temp while preparing everything else. I didn't use the bacon drippings, but substitued honey also reduced the amt of sugar and also added 1/4 cup or more flour. Also used soured milk because i didn't have buttermilk. when dipping, I used my fingers, dipped and dropped straight into the oil before any fell off. It was perfect, nice coat, not too oily, crisp on the outside and completely done when i bite into them. Will be making them again and my kids loved them. Didn't have much left over but the stuff i did have, made fennel cakes, which were also fantastic.

Delicious! Using all the tricks in the reviews, coating the dogs with corn starch first, putting the batter in a tall glass or mason jar and dipping the dogs in that and then swirling.. but I did have trouble at first with the batter fanning out in the hot oil until I read another review that said to "The last trick is...(and you have to work sort of fast...) When you take the corndog out of the batter and put it in the hot grease, hold it upright, put it about 2 inches down in the grease and hold it about 3 seconds, then carefully drop it in the grease."  That tip kept the batter from fanning out in the hot oil!  We will make these again!!

We liked how these turned out, though they don't look anything like the picture!  I used expeller-pressed coconut oil to fry in, and they tasted terrific (no coconut flavor with expeller-pressed coconut oil) and fried up really well.  I did one package of hot dogs dried, dredged in corn starch, then dipped in batter and despite having perfect-temp oil, the inside batter wasn't cooking.  So I stopped dredging in corn starch, and I thinned the batter with a little milk, and the second package turned out MUCH better - cooked batter all the way through, and the corn dogs weren't so big.  The first batch could barely fit in my kids' mouths!  I wish I'd thinned it sooner.  We'll definitely do this one again, and I don't think I'll change a thing!

Followed recipe as written, warmed hot dogs in 175 degree oven while preping batter so they were about room temp before drying with paper towel, and rolled each in corn starch then stuck on a disposible wooden chopstick.  The batter stuck beautifully -- didn't come off when frying. Great recipe, tasty and fun to make. Fried outside using the burner on the propane grill so the house stayed cool and fry-oil-smell free.

"Thank You" for sharing this recipe. I did not have the bacon drippings, so that was omitted. I used "sour milk" since I was out of buttermilk (1 cup milk plus 2 TBSP. vinegar). My husband and two teenage boys loved the corn dogs. Brought some over to my twin sister and her family, they also enjoyed this recipe. I will use this again.

Tried this out over the weekend with friends.  These turned out really well, the dusting of flour on the hot dogs before dipping them in the batter definately helped!  The only problem we had was that if the oil was too hot cooking the batter on the outside, there would still be some uncooked batter on the inside.  Just try not to cook the dogs up too quickly!  I'll be making these again, they were great! : )

Me and my husband went out and bought a deep fryer just so we could try this recipe, and we were'nt dissapointed! I read other reviewers say they had a hard time getting the corn mixture to stick, but if you dry the hot dogs really well it will stick just fine. These corn dogs were very tasty! We'll be making them again.

Delicious corn dogs... so good, we dipped kielbasa sausage into the batter as well to make the mega-awesome "corn sausages". We added a little honey for extra sweetness, and a touch more flour to compensate for the extra moistness the honey added. The one and only downfall is that they soak up a lot of grease and can't for the life of me figure out how to avoid that.

I halved this recipe for 10 hotdogs and there was still a lot of batter left.  The flavor of the batter was very good but it wasn't thick enough on the hotdog to make it like the store bought ones.  It was crunchy and tasty but just not quite thick enough for what I was looking for.

My daughter has been begging me to make corn dogs- yes, I tried it once but was a flop!  So today, after Hurricane Irene left, I went out to get some ingredients. I got almost all except for the buttermilk.  I thought I'd experiment and use sour cream instead. The rest is history! I followed all but just substituted an 8 oz tub sour cream + 1/3 cup milk for the buttermilk and no bacon drippings- it is still delish! We all love it! I wouldn't change a thing. Thanks for sharing!!

I tried these tonight in honor of National Corn Dog day. Our first dog was delicious, but we desire a little thicker batter, so the second attempt we did a double dip. Fried it once, dipped it, and fried it again. It was great! Followed the suggestion of caoting the outside in corn starch, and no problems. We will definetly have these again.

This recipe turned out great! I used wooden popsicle sticks and cut the hot dogs in thirds for an appetizer sized portion. I didn't have bacon drippings, so I used melted shortening instead and it worked great. They fried up nice and puffy. Would make again.

I really liked this recipe, I made it exactly as posted. I found it worked best if I dipped the corn dog, put it in the fryer for 30 sec, removed it and dipped it again and then cooked until golden. For the last four I added 1/4 tsp cayenne and 1 tbs red pepper sauce for an awesome spicy corn dog.

Even though the batter held on nicely to the hot dog,  it really puffed up and got distorted in the frying oil. It tasted okay but too grainy and it flaked off onto our plates when we ate it. So it's not that it tasted bad but it is definitely NOT like a Fair corn dog in my opinion.

These corn dogs turned out great and I even left the bacon drippings out.My fryer is small so I cut the hot dogs in half and fried three at a time.I had leftover batter so I just put it back in the fridge and made more the next day.I experimented with different hot dogs and we all agreed the all beef ones were the best.These were fun to make and it satisfied our craving for fair food : )

My family and I really loved these!!  Did all the right things, like rolling room temperature dogs in corn starch, leaving the batter in the fridge for 1/2 an hour, and cooking them without the sticks, etc.  I had no problems whatsoever and my daughter, the Pogo queen, gave 10 thumbs up!!  The batter tasted funny with the bacon fat before cooking, but that wasn't a problem AFTER they were cooked.  Four mins. and they were perfect!!  Thank you so much for an outstanding recipe!!

This was an outstanding recipe, I felt like I was 10 again.  After looking at numerous recipes I chose this because it had a higher sugar content and I was looking for a sweeter batter, it did not disappoint.  I didn't have bacon drippings so I just subbed oil and it was great.

Great corn dogs!  We used the big beef hot dogs like they sell at Costco.  We have a rectangular deep fryer, so they fit in one at a time.  The key to keeping the batter on is to dry the hot dogs well before you dip them.

These were great!  I rolled the hot dogs in cornstarch and had no trouble at all with the batter not sticking.  The batter didn't cover all of two pounds of hot dogs, more like just over a pound, but that was plenty for us.  I did add a couple of things to the batter, borrowed from another corn dog recipe--1/2 tsp. cayenne and 1/3 cup grated onion.

I thought it was really good, but not state fair. I did the pat dry and dust with flour, really helped. But I also had to make my batter a bit thicker. I just added 1 tablespoon of flour at a time till it was nice and thick. I never buy butter milk, because it just gets wasted after the recipe, I made my own 1 cup milk 1 tablespoon of white vinegar.  After putting coated hot dogs in oil, I had to tap them to remove them from the bottom of the pan. Worked out great!   Even used the remaining mixture as funnel cake for dessert. Just dusted with powder sugar after i pulled out of the oil. Yum Yum!

i followed the recipe except i didnt use bacon drippings.  the batter was very good.  the only problems i had was the batter kept sticking to the deep fryer basket and the batter kept coming off the hot dogs.  these problems had nothing to do with the recipe, but everything to do with ME not having a chance to read other reviews. my 4 yr old and hubby loved them even though they didnt turn out as pretty as the picture. LOL i wil make these again and i will use the other suggestions so these will turn out perfect.  thanks from a novice cook.

This is actually alot harder than I thought it would be, lol. I halved the recipe, and cut my hot dogs in half. For some reason, the batter wasn't enough. I followed the trick about coating the wieners in cornstarch before dipping and it really didn't help; maybe flour would work better? Also, using a bowl for dipping doesn't work. Wish I would've believed the reviewers that recommended using a tall glass. I used less sugar and omitted the bacon drippings, but added chili, garlic and onion powders to the batter for more flavour. Make sure you fry these in very hot oil until they are a little more than golden brown to get a nice, crisp coating. Not exactly like store-bought... My fiance and son didn't care for them so I may not make them again.

This recipe is awesome! I had to cut the hot dogs in half to get them to fit but they were perfect. I still need to find a better stick to fry them. The only change I made was that I didn't use the bacon grease(yet to try when I have some) and I added 2 tablespoons of honey to sweeten it up which really helped(I tried with and without honey with honey being the winner).

My grandson and I made these. They were very good and nice and crunchy, my only complaint was the hot dog inside was barely warm. I didn't want to leave them in the oil any longer or they would have burned the outer crust. Maybe my oil was too hot ? ? ?  I guess next time I'll leave them in longer in less heated oil.

Fantastic!!!! Even my picky kids loved these, and honestly they are just as good if not better than corndogs from the fair! Pouring the batter in a glass was an excellent idea. I used shish-kabob skewers then cut the pointy edge off and broke in half and they worked perfect. Part way through the recipe, I realized I didn't have any buttermilk, so I used 1 Cup whole milk and added 1 Tbsp butter, and they seemed to turn out just fine. the only thing I would do different would be to take the basket out of my deep fryer and just use it regular because the batter stuck to a couple. Thanks for an awesome recipe!!!

These are A-MAZ-ING!  Way better than the frozen ones in the store & rivals any fair corn dog I've had. If you're having troubles getting the batter to stick to your hot dogs or prefer a thicker coating then add 1/8 to 1/4 cup of flour to the batter. I used the suggestion to use a glass for the batter so it's easier to dip the hot dogs into. MAKE SURE you use a pot or deep fryer that is deep enough to submerse the ENTIRE hot dog ALL AT ONCE or you will have the problem some people mentioned about the batter "flaking off" the hot dog during frying. Mine did that until I used my Grade 9 Science knowledge to determine "It's Not The Recipe, It's You".  Thanks for a great recipe, this one is a keeper!

Pretty darn good!  I couldn't make these fast enough at my daughter's birthday party.  The adults were thrilled with the authentic carnival style dogs.  My daughter who is the ultimate critic loved them too but she wouldn't touch one that wasn't perfectly covered.  I chilled the mix and brought the dogs to room temp and dried them.

The best corn dog recipe I've made so far! The breading is fantastic, perfect amount of 'crunch' and thickness and just a touch of sweetness. I followed other's suggestions by letting the hot dogs come to room temperature, cutting them in half and dredging them in flour before dipping them in the batter. I followed the recipe exactly, used a package of four hot dogs and there was plenty of left over batter to do another four. Let the finished dogs sit in the oven heated at 200 degrees. I will definitely make these again!

I made this recipe for my 4 year old carnival birthday last night and it was a HUGE hit.  EVERYONE LOVED THEM!!! adult and kids... Perfect, I took the suggestions from a couple other people and had zero problems. A little flour on the dogs to get rid of any wetness before dipping, and putting the batter in a really tall glass for the dipping part. AWESOME LOVED IT, only problem.. not making them everyday now!

This is an awesome recipe!!  I made mini corndog nuggets by cutting bun-size hotdogs into thirds and drying them with a paper towel.  I dipped the dogs into the batter with a fork and used another fork to nudge it off into the hot oil.  The batter puffs way up in the oil, which I point out because it looks like there is not enough batter sticking, but it will be plenty after it cooks.  My kids loved these and said they were soooo much better than the kind you buy (plus, when you make them yourself, you can use all-beef hot dogs, and the store ones use the nasty chicken/pork combination "meat").  You will not be disappointed!!

These were really a mess!  Followed the recipe exactly as written but the batter just slid right off into the fry daddy grease.  I tried drying the hot dogs.. rolling in flour.. leaving them moist.. not using flour.. using less batter.. using more batter.. lol  After about 6 tries.. I salvaged the rest of the weiners by having the kiddos grill them over a campfire on sticks.. they had a blast! ;)

These were okay. Not the easiest thing to make if you're not using a fry daddy. I fried them in a skillet so they ended up being rectangular shaped. I could have done without all the grease. Other than that, the taste was very close to county fair corndogs. Doubt I will ever make them again. It is easier to buy frozen corn dogs. Less mess, less grease- even if you fry them, and the taste is about the same.

Best corn dogs ever!!! Fried up perfectly crispy...the key is to have oil temp perfect.  Added bonus is to take the bacon and bread it and fry it up! Unreal.

My son loves these!  The flavor was spot on.  We did stickless dogs so they would fit into my dutch oven to fry on the stove.  Next time, we plan to double the batter and sweeten with honey instead of sugar.  The hubs loves honey corn dogs.  Can't wait to try them again!  Thanks for a wonderful, nostalgic recipe!

I have tried other recipes but they were mediocre. This is by far the best... they batter didn't come off ( I made sure dogs were dry as suggested and dipped in flour first) and they were absolutely tasty.The only thing i changed is I ommited the bacon drippings and I just added a bit extra salt.

I was nervous since we don't fry much except pan frying.  Instead we just put olive oil in a pot, checked the temperature with a candy thermometer, and had at it.  

Out only changes were that we used bacon bits (we don't eat red meat) and stuck the sticks in AFTER cooking.  Made our fingers messier getting the dough on, but worked great.  My seven year old said they were just like at the fair (yes, sometimes she does eat red meat when out!  We're not absolutists or anything).

All I can say is.....mmmm good!!  I didn't use the bacon fat (I thought frying was enough grease!) but used honey in place of it.  It added a nice extra level of sweetness to it, but not a lot.  I even used wheat flour, and they turned out wonderful!  OH, and a tip:  to get the batter to stick to the hot dogs better, roll them in cornstarch and brush off the excess before dipping into the batter.  Makes the batter really stick, and works better than drying! Great recipe, thanks!!! :)

These were very greasy. I was impressed with the batter and how thick it was and stayed on the hot dog, but then when I put it into the oil it just came apart. The texture of the corn dog wasn't like what I remember. I love corn dogs, but this was not it.

YUM! Very good! I dusted my dogs with a little bit of flour and the batter stuck pretty well. Would definitely make this again. I gave this recipe 4 stars b/c I would have preferred it to be a tiny bit sweeter. Add a tad bit more sugar, and yo got yourself a fair-esque corn dog :)

My family loved these, worked perfectly. Now for the ones that the batter slid off maybe your batter was to thin for some reason. I had no problem with it, put it in a large tall glass and stuck the dog down in it and turned it around and put it in oil. No problems what so ever..

Absolutely delicious! I've been meaning to make them for a while, and finally got around to it today. They were AMAZING! The cooked batter reminds me of the crunchy part on my stepmom's Southern Cornbread! Soooooo yummy!

This was fantastic!!  Tasted just like the corn dogs that I used to get at the state fair!  I was instantly taken back to my childhood!  I also added 1 tablespoon of honey to the batter and dipped the hot dogs in flour prior to dipping them in the batter.  This was GREAT!!!!  I will make this many times more!

These corn dogs were great, I thought the batter was just right. I made them in the skillet so it was a bit tricky keeping the batter on, but I managed. I also rolled the hot dogs in flour before coating in the batter.

OH MY THERE IS NOT WORDS TO TELL HOW GOOD THESE ARE. THEY TASTE BETTER THAN ANY I HAVE EVER BOUGHT. WE DID NOT HAVE PLAIN FLOUR BUT I USED SELF RISING FLOUR AND JUST LEFT OUT THE BAKING POWDER AND SALT AND SOME HOW I FORGOT THE BACON FAT BUT THEY WERE STILL THE BEST. WILL KEEP THIS ONE AND MAKE ALOT.  THANKS ROBY

These were great! Be careful with the temperature of the oil, because with the sugar in the batter, they do brown very quickly. However, you have to leave them in long enough to make sure the breading is cooked all the way through. Also, I keep a container of bacon fat in the fridge to add to various foods for flavoring. Hash brown potatoes are especially good cooked in bacon fat (just don't do it too often because it isn't very health conscious). Thank you, Roby, for a delicious and simple recipe.

This recipe is fantastic & so easy to make!  The only change I made was leaving out the bacon drippings (I did not have any), and they still turned out perfectly.  This is definitely a keeper.

Really good. My only complaint is that the batter tends to fall apart when reheated in the microwave. And what was left out was that the hotdogs should be warm before battering and frying. I had to cut the hotdogs into thirds. The first time I made this recipe, I made the mistake of assuming the hotdogs would become hot while frying.

Fail. coating didn't want to stick on. tried with floured dogs and w/o. put the batter in a cup, that was a good idea. otherwise, these were not very loved in this household.

This was delicious!  I made it just as suggested except that I used turkey dogs and didn't use the bacon fat because we don't eat pork.  I took the suggestions of some others and let the hot dogs get to room temperature, dusted them with flour and twisted the dogs as I pulled them out of the batter and it all went perfectly.  I LOVE that we can have corn dogs now!!  I had some leftover batter so i buttered my muffin tin and made some cornbread muffins too!

WOW! These are fantastic! Super crunchy if you cook them a bit longer. We live in a very rural area and have little to no fast food access so these were a real treat!!

Made these for my twin boys' 4 year birthday party..."HUGE SUCCESS!!" All guests raved about the taste and the parents begged for the recipe!!  THANKS FOR A GREAT RECIPE!  Will add this to my recipe collection, and plan to make these for years to come!  Superior taste, especially in comparison to county/state fair corn dogs!  Great ratio of breading to hot dog!!  LOVE this recipe!

These are wonderful, but they are a "sometimes" food.  We felt bad serving them to our kids... but...YUMMY!  we also fried some jack cheese in the batter too.  They were even better than the dogs.

The recipe is delicious.  But, one thing I had to do was to make the  batter thick because if I didn't the batter wouldn't be very thick after deep frying it.

I didn't have the bacon trimmings but they still turned out excellent. Great tip about rolling them in flour. I also tried onion rings and jalapeno poppers with this batter and they tasted just like the stores.

We all really liked these!  They turned out perfectly!  This was the first time we’d ever tried making these and I think they were even better than the ones we get at the fair.  For whatever reason it had never occurred to me before to try making these at home, I was so happy to find something different for supper.  We added some cream corn to the batter on a whim.  It just seemed like a good idea and I was really pleased with the results.  It added to the flavour and texture of our corn dogs.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

A-W-E-S-O-M-E !!! I followed the recipe, didn't change a thing. I took one reviewer's advice and used a tall container and dusted in flour before battering. My family really enjoyed these.  We will definitely be making these regularly.

Mine just didn't turn out.  I'm sure did something wrong, but I'm not sure what.  It took me like 4 corn dogs to get them to stay together.  But they were way greasy.  I think my oil might not have been hot enough.

We loved these! I used jumbo hot dogs and it only made just over a package per batch. My husband is a very picky eater and he absolutely loved them. I also didn't use the bacon grease and it was still awesome. I do roll the hot dogs in flour to help the batter stick and I put the batter in a big cup so that I could just dip them in it. Great!

this was an excellent recipe for corn dogs, they fried up crispy on the outside, and tender inside.  Awesome!!  We made some by putting cocktail sausages on a skewer, 3 at a time and they were SO darn good.  Totally worth the time and effort to make these at home.  I did cut the sugar by about 1/3 based on reviews, did everything else by the recipe.  Excellent, thanks for this batter recipe!

GOOD GOLLY THIS IS SO GOOD!
I followed directions, except for bacon fat. I replaced with 1/4 cup of honey mustard. (I am adding more next time). This batter is so good, just skip the hot dogs and fry it by itself! YUM!!!

Oh, one more thing...don't skimp on the hot dog, use good beef, I didn't and the meat was the worst part.

This recipe was wonderful.  Just like the fair.  We used melted butter instead of bacon drippings and we used powdered buttermilk mix to make our buttermilk.  We cut our hot dogs and made mini corn dogs.  We also rolled our hot dogs in a bit of flour before dipping in the batter and the batter stayed on very well.

Amazing taste! The best corn dog I've ever eaten!  Didn't put the bacon grease, added 2 more tablespoons of buttermilk.  I put 2 inches of oil in a deep skillet, used a skewer to coat the  dry dogs (no flour) and then a fork to slip them off the skewer into the oil.  Fried about 1 minute each side, until golden. Drained and cooled them a couple minutes then put the skewer back in for the kids to eat. I only had 1 pack of hot dogs so there was leftover batter.  I used a spoon to put small spoonfuls into the oil, they were like little hushpuppies and they puffed up in a perfect round ball, we must have eaten a dozen of those!  Thanks for this recipe!

This was a really disappointment. All of the batter came off in the oil. I tried some of the tips like making sure the dogs were dry first but it didn't help. My six yr old was really disappointed to get a plain hot dog rather than a corn dog. will not try this one again. I am giving it a one only because I cant choose zero!

These were not as perfect as frozen corn dogs that you can get at the store but they were ten times better!!! We made a double batch of the batter and poured it into a glass to help dip the dogs a bit more easily. Then we deepfried enough of them to eat and lightly fried the rest and put them in the freezer. Throw the frozen ones in the oven, microwave or lightly fry in a oiled pan for a quick and easy snack or even for dinner. Yay!

I patted the dogs dry before placing them in the mixture but it still fell off the hot dog during frying. I tried coating in flour first then the corn meal mixture and it worked better.

Best corn dogs ever.  They came out of the fryer just picture perfect.  They were a hit with the family.  I took the advice of dusting the hot dogs with flour before dipping.  Batter stuck perfectly.  I also used a tall glass for dipping.  We got 9 beautiful dogs.

Very yummy!  Good quality hot dogs from the butcher made a big difference.  I didn't have bacon grease, only cooked bacon, so I chopped it up real small and added that instead.  I also didn't have any baking powder, and the dogs came out more tempura than cakey, which I liked.  We had some leftover steak in the fridge, so I used the extra batter on small chunks to make steak bites - those were really good, too!

Was much easier than I anticipated. I didn't have a deep fryer, and a large pot worked just as well. I used quite a but more oil to fully submerge the dogs. Kids loved them and thought it was a fun dinner.

I had to really tweak this recipe -- I added more egg and more flour & corn meal, too.  The batter kept exploding open even though I gently twirled the battered dogs in the oil at first.  Once I fixed the batter, they turned out great.  I'm going back to the Pioneer Woman's recipe next time - but I'll cut it in half (which is why I tried this one - it was a much smaller quantity).

Even though I followed all of the tips written by other reviewers, I still had some trouble with this recipe.  The flavor was good, although it didn't produce the type of corn dog I thought it would.  I prefer a cakey-type corn dog, this was light and almost lacey in texture.  When dropping the dogs in the hot oil, the batter fried in a flat, almost pancake like shape around the hot dog.  Not round, like in the photo.  I flipped it over in the hot oil to fry the other side...but they were by no means round!  I doubt if I would ever try this again...I will keep to the good ole fair corn dogs!

Very flavorful, tender yet a crunchy crust.  Dogs came out looking like the picture.  Didn't have sticks so used a fork stuck in the dogs.  This is a keeper!

I doubled the sugar and salt. I did not dredge in flour first but will next time. I used Costco hot dogs and cut in thirds. I am making tomorrow for my son's preschool graduation. They are SO yummy! Better than our fiar Krusty Pups!

This was a fun family night dinner.  They turned out pretty good.  The batter was a little runny though.  We dipped the hot dogs in cornstarch as suggested and that helped the batter stay on better.  Very fun!

I usually buy frozen corn dogs for my children and decided to try and make them from scratch.  Well, this recipe was so easy and delicious. I did eliminate the bacon drippings, used beef hotdogs cut into thirds and covered them in flour before dipping into batter. The result was wonderful.  My children rated these the best corn dogs they have ever eaten.  Thanks Roby!

The corn dog nuggets I made from this recipe, following it exactly, were good but not special.  They tasted just like the frozen kind except with better quality  hot dogs b/c you put them in yourself.  The word "fair" in the title had my hopes way up, and I was disappointed.  They are nothing like the ones at the fair, atleast the ones I've been to in the South.  I won't make again considering the let down and extreme greasiness.

I made these twice, the second time I used 1/4 cup less buttermilk, the batter was thicker and tasted better. I well make these again for sure! Update: The flour I was using was bad the first 2 times I made these. I should have brought it back to the store, it didn't look right, so the next time I made it with different flour I needed all the buttermilk.

Best corn dogs ever! That's what everyone said after they tasted the first one and proceeded to devour them all before I got one. It's necessary to bring hot dogs to room temp or warm a bit in the microwave. I found the batter sticks to dogs if completely dry with or without dredging in flour first; tastes great with or without bacon drippings, which tends to make the batter not stick. Used a tall glass, like everyone suggests. They do brown in a few seconds, so I cooked one at a time to avoid burning. Will be making these again!

This was the fluffiest corn dog recipe I have tried. It was very good. I didn't use the bacon dripping but added a teaspoon of dried mustard and a dash of paprika. If you roll the dogs in corn starch the batter sticks so much better. Also, it worked well with tofu dogs.

I soured milk, and really, really dried the dogs off, dusted them w/cornstarch, and I still had a difficult time keeping the batter on. I wish the inside of the dog was hotter, but I will admit the flavor was fantastic. We rarely deep fry anything anymore, but this will be a treat every now and then.

These were yummy. I didn't have any cornmeal simply because I don't think they sell it in Australia because I can't seem to find it anywhere! I just used plain flour in its place and added a teaspoon of chicken bouillon, sprinkle of seasoning salt instead of normal salt. I used a tall glass to dip the dogs. Rolling them in flour before dipping made the batter stick well. I took out the basket in my deep fryer and just used tongs to roll the dogs around. It's better if the oil can get very hot as to bubble around the dog. My two kids loved these and ate them in record time!

This was a yummy batter. My grandson ate them up. Light on the inside, crunchy on the outside. I made the Lazy Baked Macaroni and Cheese and it was a perfect dinner.

Pretty tasty. I added a little paprika and onion powder as suggested by a previous reviewer, plus I cut the salt down by half. I used only about 2 tablespoons of sugar. I DID use the bacon drippings (I keep bacon grease in a plastic container in the fridge, and I refill it whenever I cook bacon! It's awesome for cooking eggs, pancakes, french toast, potatoes.. Just about anything!). I mixed all the ingredients in a 4-cup measuring cup. Instead of using sticks, I chopped the dogs in half lengthwise, dusted them lightly with flour, dropped two at a time in the batter, and fished them out with a fork. Let the excess drip off, dropped 'em in the deep fryer, and they were done in 3 or 4 minutes. Thanks, Roby, they were fun and tasty, and I just stuck the leftover batter in the fridge to use today!

I truly feel like the odd ball on this one. They came out great and were easy to make but the flavor wasn't what I was looking for....something was missing and I can't put my finger on it.  The family all loved them so I am giving them 4 stars but my quest for the perfect corn dog will continue.

This is a wonderful corn dog recipe! They are light and fluffy and crisp on the outside just like it should be. My pot wasn't quite big enough to submerge all at once so cutting the hot dogs in half was a must so the batter doesn't run off. Also dipping in flour first and using a tall glass seems to get the best low mess results here. I didn't have any skewers and used take out chop sticks I cut in half and they worked perfect.

I followed the instructions exactly and the batter just kept flaking off when I put the hot dogs in the deep fryer. Don't know why but it just didn't work out for me. Maybe it was the brand of ingredients I used but still, be careful when making this.

I love fair corndogs and these are perfect. My neighbor had NEVER eaten a corndog and he and his family loved these too. I even used the bacon drippings. I have made them 3 times since finding this recipe. I couldn't find sticks so I cut wooden skewers in half and of course clipped the tip. FANTASTIC!

This was an awesome recipe. The county fair just left town and I tried most all of the carnival foods but did not get a chance to try the corndogs. I found this recipe and the whole family was very pleased at the way they turned out. We will definitely try this one again.

It was a hot summer night and so I decided to try out this recipe. I pretty much followed the recipe to a T, except I use one whole egg and 2% milk with some butter melted in it--I also added my own spices and cooked the hotdogs in advance. I also shallow fried my corndogs and was using really long skewers [so I could roll the corndogs through the oil as they cooked]. Overall they came out nicely--not as crunchy as I hoped, but good anyway. I will definitely make these again!

Made this with veggie hot dogs, left out the bacon.  Also I did not deep-fry but shallow-fried instead in about a quarter inch of oil.  I haven't tasted authentic corn dogs so can't say how mine compared, but they were very light, fluffy and delicious.

I followed the suggestions of others-dried the dogs, floured, and put the batter in a tall glass. I fried these at 400 about 3 at a time so that the temp would not drop too much. These were GREAT! I am not a Corn Dog fan so to speak, but I enjoyed the "crunch" that you don't get from the frozen ones.  These are cheap to make also. Why spend the $$$ on buying these. My daughter helped me make these and she also enjoyed them.  I tried this recipe because I am thinking about making corn dogs for a community celebration and there is ususlly hamburgers or BBQ.  Thanks Roby for a great recipe and thanks to all you others for the reviews to help me "tweak" this. EASY to make and GREAT to eat!!  The only thing I "miss" is the crunchy batter that is at the end of the stick. I will survive. :-)

I ended up dipping in flour first, then in batter, then flour again & batter again.  They were not totally smooth and I don’t know if it is just because of the way I went about mixing the batter.  Everybody loved them though.

My standard for Corn dogs is the Fletcher Corny Dog at the Texas State Fair in  Dallas.  Nobody does them better. I lived in Dallas for 25 years and never passed a chance to eat them.

These are actually better, because you have the chance to buy a higher quality dog.  All beef, organic, whatever you like. I end up cutting them in half to better fit into my fryer, and use chopsticks as my wooden sticks.

The breading is light and crisp and almost melts in your mouth. Now I have one less reason to go back to Texas.

We used it in a fondue.  Dried the hotdog chunks with paper towels and dusted each piece in a bowl of flour just prior to dipping in the batter and into the oil.  Worked awesome!

Much easier than I thought it would be, though I did have problems regulating a consistent temperature on the frying oil.  Got around this by pre-cooking the hotdogs on grill before battering and frying.  So even if the cornbread cooked fast, the internal dog was still hot.  This did not seem to negatively effect the batter adhering to the hotdog as I was concerned it might.  Just make sure it is good and chilled.

I have never made anything like this before, but have always been curious!  They turned out great!  It won't be on the regular rotation, but loved it!  I had a lot of okra, and used this as a batter for the okra also.  Again, very good, but for health reasons, not on a regular rotation. 
Great recipe for fun and self-indulgence!

This is the first time I attempted these and they came out better than my wildest expectations. It was difficult for me to find yellow corn meal here in Johannesburg (unless I substitute it with Polenta). I didn't want to take the risk of messing the recipe up with a substitute, so I used regular white cornmeal ( known as maize meal here) and added a little squeeze of yellow gel food coloring to resemble the bright yellow batter and it looked like the real thing. Oh my word, these tasty corn dogs are an absolute hit with everyone at home. I will definitely favorite this recipe for an easy light fun dinner bite any day!!! Simply delicious is all I can say!!!

Wow! Followed y'all (room temp, dry, cornstarch, paprika-onion batter) but replaced bacon drippings w/ liquid smoke+sesame oil.  The batter stuck beautifully, but my Weber thermometer, rated to 450 degrees, cut out and the oil def overheated, overdoing the dogs like crazy--they were inflating as fast as pappadums.  The recipe is so good that the result was still addictive...but I can't wait till next go-round.

I, too, shallow pan fried these (using  Crisco vegetable shortening). My 21 year old daughter -- who loves corn dogs, but who has always felt somewhat "culturally deprived" because I did not buy them often -- absolutely LOVED these. While my own personal "technique" may need some adjusting, I will definitely make these again.
