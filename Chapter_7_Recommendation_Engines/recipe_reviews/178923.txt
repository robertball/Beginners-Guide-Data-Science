Super easy and super yummy!! I got 18 muffins out of this recipe and I had to cook mine for 20 minutes. I only had milk chocolate chips, but the muffins still tasted great!! Try them warm!

This recipe is amazing!!!  The muffins were moist and delicious, not to mention they turned out absolutely beautiful with the almond slivers on top!

Very moist and the flavor is perfect.  The almonds on top are a nice touch but easily avoided if you don't want them.  I will certainly make these again!

This recipe is very easy to follow and absolutely delicious! I bought a different brand of muffin mix that called for 3/4 cup milk, 2 eggs, and 1/4 cup veg. oil so I modified it to 1/2 cup milk, 2 eggs, 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup applesauce and it still turned out great. I have a fundraiser bake sale coming up and these will be on the menu for sure! Thank you!
