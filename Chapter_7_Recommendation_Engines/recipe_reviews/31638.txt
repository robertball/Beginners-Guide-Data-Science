Very good.  I will definitely make this again but next time I will make sure to use the ingredients on the list.  I used regular russet potatoes and some inexpensive paprika I had on hand.  I also did not use bell peppers because I didn't have any and it really did need the peppers.  I think next time I will also use a second clove of garlic.  I substituted bacon drippings for some of the butter which I think added alot to the flavor.

These were delicious! I left out the green peppers and sauteed the garlic in butter.  I partially microwaved the potatoes to speed things up. I used regular paprika and used Lawry's seasoned salt. These were perfect for Sunday breakfast paired with scrambled eggs, bacon, toast, juice and coffee. I doubt any diner could have compared.

AWESOME! While sauting the onion/bell pepper, I added a head of chopped broccoli and some fresh mushrooms I needed to use up before they went bad in my fridge. A perfect side to our chicken! In fact, this was the first to dissapear. Its not the most unique recipe but that doesn't detract from its taste. Paprika, potatoes & veggies - we can't get enough. Thanks Ruth!

These are soooooo good! I first tasted these earlier this week at work. I talked to the Chef and he showed me how to make them and this was his recipe, minus the green pepper and add bacon. These are so yummy. He just used paprika from a giant spice container and I doubt it was Hungarian. Mmmm!

This was delicious and easy to make. I didn't have Yukon gold potatoes so I used russet potatoes and it turned out fine. Hubby and I found this was even better when the leftovers were refried. Thanks Ruth!

YUM! I used idaho potatoes, which I opted to peel, used more garlic than called for and added a little bacon grease in with the butter. These turned out so flavorful and could not have been easier to make. Loved the addition of the paprika. I will be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Man! What an easy way to make home fries! I remember, as a little girl, my mom would make them and it seemed like the hardest thing in the world. The potatoes took so long to cook. However, boiling the potatoes first really cut down the cooking time in this recipe. Oh yea and I didn't use the Hungarian paprika I used some regular paprika  and of course the home fries were still delicious.

These were awesome.  They were gone so quick.  The only thing I would change is that I cut the pot. into too large of chunks. They would have gotten crispier if they were smaller. But I would recommend these to everyone.

So thankful for this recipe, as I'm pregnant and am always craving home fries cooked this particular way. Driving 30 minutes out to the closest to the restaurant that cooks them this way can be quite cumbersome & costly when you crave these daily like I do! My only change was I only had russets but they cooked up just fine!

I over-boiled my normal potatoes, did not use paprika, yet the taste was wonderful. Mine became mashed potatoes with green peppers.  still good!

Was great, but I wonder how to make them more crunchy. Should I cook them longer? Went well with scrambled eggs!

My mother used to make this a lot when I was growing up, until I decided I hated onions. I like them again nowadays but had forgotten about this! I used to eat so much I'd make myself sick, it's just irresistible. The only thing she did differently was slice the potatoes very thinly, instead of doing chunks. I can't wait to make this again!

These were good breakfast potatoes, but the onion and green peppers burnt before the potatoes were done.

Good stuff! Used red taters + a little red pepper (don't like green). Crumbled up a couple pieces of turkey bacon and added in. Also threw in some chopped green onion and small pieces of tomato for the last couple minutes. I think the juice from tomatoes added a nice flavor. Will def make again.

Easy and delicious....Instead of frying in the butter, I opted to used a some olive oil and roast the potatoes and peppers in the oven. 375 for about an hour and the potatoes were a bit crispy. Thanks

I'm trying to cut starch veggies like this, but it was very good.  I used regular paprika instead of sweet one.  I bet it'll make taste better.

I followed the recipe down to the last grain of salt but found that the potatoes did not brown and they were very greasy.
I love home fries and I will try again but will use less butter and will cook onions after potatoes and peppers have cooked for a bit.  My onions started to burn and by the time potatoes were cooked, onions were near black.  I ended up draining mixture on paper towelling and then I put them in oven to crisp up and brown.

I really liked this, and it was a good way to use up some cooked Yukon gold potatoes. I sauteed chopped onion in butter and olive oil for 5 min (did not use the green pepper). I then added the potatoes, sprinkled with salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder, and a little each of paprika and smoked paprika and cooked for about 10 min. During the last few minutes, I also added some chopped,  leftover cooked apple-maple chicken sausage that I heated for 30 sec in the microwave. Add a little ketchup on the side, and it was better than some breakfast places! Thanks for the great and easy recipe!

Great foundation for a good dish. While boiling the taters I did the onions and set them aside. Used 3 minced garlic cloves and cooked them in the butter(melted) in the microwave for a couple of minutes.  I used that with the oil to fry the spuds. Turned them a couple of times to get a crisp (about 5 min per side) then added the onions, paprika and parsley at the end. Salt & pepper to taste

Very good!  I made this except I used Russet potatoes instead of Yukons and olive oil instead of butter.  It turned out very good.  Thanks for the recipe.

It was a little too spicy for my family (not me), so I'll tone down the paprika next time. Easy to make.

This is a great recipe that gives us all a lot of leeway! Just hubs & I so I made it with only 3 smaller Yukon Golds. Omitted the green pepper (hubs hates). Cut down the butter. Added an extra clove of garlic (because... we love garlic!), cut the butter in half, and the paprika: scant Tbl! Delicious.  Easy! Will most def put this in rotation! (Served it up with sloppy joes)

Turned this into a meal by adding chopped cooked sausage and chicken along with cooked green beans. Sprinkle with grated cheese after finished mixing.  Nice with a green salad.

This is a great base for home-fries. I was really in the mood for some and figured I'd whip it up for Mother's Day as part of a brunch meal. I did, however, sprinkle some regular paprika, sage, cayenne pepper and thyme, rather than the sweet paprika. It added a bunch of flavor!

Provisionally, I'll give this a '5' just to try it again, this time sauteing the potatoes with the onions, ti give them a better consistency and sharper taste.
3-22-13:  Ann said this was her 2nd favorite potato recipe, behind only the rosemary roasted recipe.

Delish - but changed out the green peppers for red peppers.

This is absolutely the best after being put into a taco shell. Add some salsa, sour cream, and cheddar cheese.  No need for meat!
