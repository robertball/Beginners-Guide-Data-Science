This had a lot of flavor.  A little bit spicy and a little bit sweet. Perfect.  I made only a few substitutions, regular broccoli in place of broccoli rabe and added in a fresh zucchini from our garden.  Used Cajun chicken sausage from Sprouts.  Other than that, kept the recipe exactly as is. I imagine this would be great with spinach or kale if someone did not have broccoli on hand.  Will make this again!

I have to say I did not care for the chicken sausage that I used (no fault of the recipe). It was a chicken sausage with feta and spinach that I had picked up at Aldi. I did enjoy the dish though. The lemon red pepper and broccolini and parmesan really make the dish. I'd make this again using a sausage that I know we like and recommend others to do the same!

Used mild Italian sausage because that is what I had. Super easy & super tasty. Everyone loved it. Served with garlic bread and extra Parmesan cheese. Yum

This was a great, simple alternative to pasta with red sauce! I substituted broccoli for the broccolini. I subbed chicken broth for white wine (didn't have a bottle open). I also used turkey Italian sausage, which I find can be harder to brown evenly due to the texture. To compensate, I let the sausage cook a little longer and added some extra liquid when needed. This dish has a wonderful kick and literal zest that we really enjoyed. I immediately had requests to bring the leftovers for lunch the next day! This one is a keeper.
