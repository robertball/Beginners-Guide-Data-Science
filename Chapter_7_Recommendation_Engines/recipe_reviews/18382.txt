Terrific Old Fashion Recipie! Ok...first I want to say that the last person who left a review for this said they barely got 3 doz out of it and that it was messy...I am wondering if you maybe covered it while it was cooking?...leaving it to sticky. Also how big of balls did you make? I made balls the size of large marbles and I got around 6 dozen...also my dough was not messy at all...I had to press it to make it stick together into balls (once pressed they stayed formed very well...not crumbly at all) Anyway...I just made these and they are very good and very christmasy:) I must say though that when I took the "dough" out of the oven I was suprised at the consistancy. It was a dry "casserole" (looked like dressing) that I wasn't expecting. Better words could be used in the directions to save confusion. (the directions say to beat well with a wooden spoon...it should say to break up or loosen) I almost discarded it but I took my wooden spoon and "beat" it as best I could. (I just stired and got it all loosened and broken up) As long as you aren't thinking of typical cookie dough you'll be ok. After the mixture cooled I pressed the dough into balls and rolled them in sugar assembly line style. It was very easy but a bit time consuming...they are good though...and very Grandma-ish:) thanks for sharing Peggy!

Peggy thank you for posting this recipe. I've been looking for it for years. Folks this is a wonderful holiday cookie. I top mine off with half a candied cherry to make them look festive.

I needed to use up some dates that I bought for a different recipe and didn't make. And gluten free was a bonus. These were perfect. I did stir a couple times while baking but I don't think I needed to. Just at the end would work fine. I followed another reviewers suggestion and left it overnight before working with it. And thank you to the reviewer who formed the mixture into logs using plastic or paper and then cut off pieces to form into balls and roll in the sugar. That made it go super fast and really contained the stickiness. The first person to try them asked for the recipe.

Thank you so much for this recipe. My Mom made these for us when we were little so they definitely are an old fashioned Christmas cookie. Mom always made them into little logs instead of the balls but they are really wonderful cookies no matter what shape you form them into. Thanks very much Peggy for posting this recipe. They will be on my cookie tray this year!

I got this recipe more than 30 years ago from a Christmas cookie exchange party in Denver. It has become a tradition in my family to make them at Christmas. My recipe says to take the casserole out of the oven every 10 minutes and scrape the sides with a fork to keep the coconut from getting burned on the edges. (The problem is that it tastes so good that I have to eat a forkful each time I stir. Yummy!!) I usually let it cool overnight and roll them into small balls the next day. You can freeze them after you roll them into balls. I then roll them in powdered sugar not granulated. They are best just big enough to pop in your mouth not bite. (powdered sugar can be a little messy to eat.) Everyone loves these. My daughter-in-law made them with dried cherries when she didn't have dates. Yes these are messy to make....but worth it.

I would make these again. They're pretty good for the little effort required. Dough was crusty on the outside and gooey on the inside when it came out of the oven but it all stirred together to form a sort of crumbly mixture. It is certainly easier to roll into balls if you wait until the dough is completely cool. I had a sticky mess when I started too soon and found it much easier when I followed the directions and waited for it to cool.

I usually don't goof but I still give this a 5 because it was my fault. Be careful. It calls for 1 1/4 cup sugar but you are to use only 1 cup in the batter. It made them a tad bit sweet so I added some coco powder and it reduced the sweetness a bit. I put the batter in a 9" brownie pan and that was fine. Yes they do get a bit sticky but I just put some sugar in my palm and rolled away. It makes a large quantity and they are delicious!

I made this recipe late last night expecting to write a negative review today but when I woke up I found a note from my husband on the cookie plate - "Best Cookie in the World." I have to admit that they taste pretty good. My only complaint is that it's a mess to work with( I had to spray Pam on my hands to keep the dough from sticking) and it only makes barely 3 dozen. I don't see how she got 5 dozen! Will make again.

Honestly I expected to hate these due to the coconut but my husband likes it and I had all these odd ingredients left over after cleaning my cupboards out. They turned out really well and we ended up fighting over who got the last cookie. I used sweetened angel flake coconut candied cherries candied ginger walnuts and after the mixture had cooled down I also added chocolate chips. They were sticky to roll so I ended up using parchment paper to roll the mixture into a log and then sliced off equal portions which didn't require quite as much handling. Next time I will skip rolling them in sugar as they are pretty sweet already. I will definitely make them again as the whole family loved them.

Made these in 2010 and they are top of my list for 2011! Love them!!! A bit messy to make - but worth it! I believe I followed the recipe as written last year and plan to do the same again this year. My preference was for smaller balls - maybe the size of a large shooter marble.

Good Recipe I don't use the Coconut. I just like the Dates with the walnuts Instead of all granulated sugar I used 1/4 cup of brown sugar. I also use powdered sugar to make the date rolls. They roll very easy that way and not so sticky.

This cookie is addicting so better double the recipe. I have made them with both walnuts and pecans. I didn't have dates so used diced dried figs. I finally after 3 batches remembered to butter my hands. This made rolling them so much easier. If doubling the recipe it will take longer in the oven. I think I had to give it 45 minutes instead of 30. Thanks Peggy for a new family favorite.

Anyone that likes a fig based treat will enjoy these. I've already shared the recipe with a couple receipients. I followed the recipe As Is. The "dough" is a little heavier than a typical flour based cookie but worth the mixing effort. We ended with about 30-35 balls. They may have been slightly larger than most.

I have been making these cookies for years. Love them!! I make sure my hands are damp and the cookie dough is very cool before rolling in balls. I use the sugar to roll in also nuts and or coconut. I have some cooling right now. YUM Thanks Peggy!

Yummy! I used light brown sugar instead of white and pecan chips instead of walnuts and a food processor to combine. This worked fine. I cooked the dough in a 2 quart rectangular glass baking pan instead of a casserole and I think that worked reasonably well. When you stir after cooking make sure to incorporate all the crusty parts. I missed a few. I followed the advice not to roll the balls in sugar and I agree that they are sweet enough without. I did not need Pam on my hands but the balls were sticky still warm when I made them.

Happy accident. I accidentally added a third egg and did not have enough dates and walnuts to correct my mistake so in the spirit of using up leftover ingredients I used the following instead of the original recipe: 3 eggs 1 1/4 cup sugar 1 cup walnuts 1/2 pecans 1 cup dates 1/2 cranberries 1 1/2 t. vanilla 1 1/2 cup coconut flakes and 1/4 t almond extract. When rolling in the sugar I added some cinnamon. Overall it was superb. Thanks for the original recipe!

These are AWESOME! They are super easy (I mixed everything together in the food processor - adding nuts at the very end with a few quick pulses). I waited a few hrs for the cooked mixture to cool and it was super easy to work with. I rolled half in reg sugar and half in icing sugar (for contrast) but i think I prefer the regular sugar (they're so pretty!). My kids normally shun dates but I told them these were "sugarplums" and they LOVED them. I made them small (one-bite sized) which I will do again. Thanks for sharing this one!

I was so very happy to find this recipe! Back in 1970 I was given this recipe by a dear friend of my mother-in-law's. The recipe giver was in her 50's and mentioned that her mother made these cookies when she was a child. Now that really dates this recipe as being very old--kind of like the origins of Red Velvet Cake that uses both cornstarch and vinegar with a roux icing. I had lost my copy of this recipe and I am so happy to find it here! My original recipe called for these same ingredients although I've always used the dried diced dates. And as another reviewer mentioned mine were rolled in powdered sugar. I wonder how this recipe would taste substituting Craisins for the dates?

The first time I made these for Christmas I followed the recipe exactly and LOVED it. The next time I was out of walnuts so used pecans which I preferred (pecans are my favourite nut so no big surprise) and I cooked the 'casserole' longer and cut into squares. They were chewier but less fuss. Next time I will substitute some dry sour cherries for a portion of the dates. And perhaps some dried apricots....love this recipe.

I made it with less sugar in the recipe the coating makes them sweet enough. And I froze them before rolling them in the sugar then rolled the frozen ones and used them for Christmas packages. Rave reviews! My mother-in-law always made these for her cookie trays my favorite brought back memories of our precious Jo Alice this Christmas. Merry Christmas!.
