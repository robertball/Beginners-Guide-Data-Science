My husband and I loved it! I searched "whole oven baked chicken" and just used the first recipe I saw, and I'm glad I did.  I used all of the ingredients as directed, but added about 2 TBSP of honey.

I did not use our dutch oven though, I lined a glass pan with foil and covered it with foil. I baked it at 375 for 2 hours. then uncovered on Broil for 5 minutes and it was soooo soooo juicy, my husband pulled the bone right out of it! It was so easy to whip up all the ingredients too.  Try this! 

The flavor was great and not overpowering at all. OH I JUST remembered, I did add one bouillon cube, instead of poultry seasoning.

This turned out ok, but wasn't as flavorful as I would have hoped. My almost 6 lb hen took about 45 minutes longer to cook than specified.

Delicious!  Followed the recipe exactly...the chicken was perfectly done (cooked a 5.3 lb chicken) with very moist white meat.  My husband and I very much enjoyed it.

I was a little skeptical with the variety of ingredients but it was amazing. It was very juicy and the kids enjoyed pouring the sauce over the chicken. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is super good! Even my husband raved about it, and he actually cooks allot more than I do. The only thing I changed was I used a can of beer instead of water. The near was juicy& flavorful, and the outside got nice& crispy...yum!

I wish I could add more stars! This was absolutely delicious!
I had some left, not much since it was so good, removed the bones, mixed the sauce together with cooked mushrooms, a splash of dry vermouth and served over noodles. Another hit!
Thank You!!

Everyone loved it!!! I didn't add flour and used a tsp of better than bouillon in place of poultry seasoning and wildflower honey.

I didn't have Worchester so I used BBQ sauce. For a 5 pound chicken I cooked it covered for one hour basting once and then it turned over breast side up and then cooked 30 minutes uncovered.

I made this it was very good. I have to question the cooking time. After an hour and five minutes you have raw chicken. I had to cook it for at least two hours and fifteen minutes.

The bbq sauce for this recipe wasn't as pungent as I like my sauces to be but it was good.  It was missing key ingredients (IMO) such as chili powder, cayenne, paprika, brown sugar, etc.  There just wasn't enough kick to it.

I baked it at 350, 20min per pound plus an extra 15. Added ginger curry and garlic. Turned out excellent!! Also brined the chicken and put slices of butter in between the skin and chicken. Added pieces of bacon on top.

This was fantastic!! I'm vegetarian but my family isn't. Even my two kids, age 2 and 4, tore this up without a problem. I didn't add any honey but it was fantastic!! Thanks for sharing.

I  have to say this is the BEST roast chicken I have ever made.  I am going to use this recipe to cook my Christmas turkey in the crockpot.  I suspect it also will be delicious and very moist.  Yum.

This is a nice, easy chicken recipe. Our cluck was on the heavier side and it took an additional 35 minutes of cooking time. I'll be interested to try cut up chicken next time. thanks for sharing maryjmohler

You really have to adjust the cooking times I followed the recipe exactly and the chicken was still raw had to throw it back in on a sheet pan for another 25 minutes?

Made this recipe for Christmas dinner and it was a hit!  I doubled the recipe but ended up using only one chicken, so I had plenty of sauce. The cooking time for the 6 lb. bird was right on target, using a cast iron Dutch oven. This is the mist delicious and moist baked chicken I’ve ever cooked.

Made this for lunch today, I substituted A1 Steak Sauce for the Worcestershire sauce.  Baked at 375 degrees covered with foil and broiled last 5 minutes uncovered to give that brown look.  Delicious, moist and juicy chicken meat.  I will cook it again.

Do not!!!! Do not!!!! Follow these instructions!!!!! Get a thermometer cook chicken. From my attempts and the other reviews at least an hour and a 1/2 before removing lid. The chicken needs to be cooked before browning or when you try to brown it and find out it’s still raw you will burn/dry it. Unless this person made this recipe with a Cornish game hen I’m not sure why they say 45 min. Other then that it was good.

I love this recipe.  I made it for my in-laws and my family and they all loved it.  I prefer more sauce so for that part of the recipe I increase everything by another half.  I also use a bit more honey than indicated and I use half teriyaki and half soy sauce.  I usually make this in a regular roasting pan and it comes out perfect every time.

I guess my family expected more and will have to tweak this or try something else. I split the 5 lb chicken and cooked 1.5 hours as husband wants it done. The sauce was excellent after each of us put a personal hot touch to it as it needed a bite when poured on rice. One  added Sriracha, one added Franks Red Hot Wing Sauce, one added Tabasco and Cholula Sauce. We are a hot sauce type of family.

Definitely time  your baking by the 20 min. per  pound method. Chickens do come  in different sizes. Also, wipe any marinade from the sides of the Dutch oven that may splash when you coat the chicken before baking or it will blacken the pan. I will give this recipe another try with these fixes.

This chicken was very good. I used beer instead of water which I read in a previous review. I also added a boullion cube to the sauce & softened butter under skin of the chicken. Yummy!!!

Great flavors, sauteed onions before adding to marinade mixture.  Sauce is amazing over smashed potatoes.  1st time making it I used a "regular" stew pot and it needed to be cooked about 45 minutes longer to get done.  Purchased a cast-iron pot, still had to cook it 45 minutes longer.  Will still make this great recipe but allow for the longer cook-time.  Next time I'll butcher the chicken and try it in a slow cooker to see what happens.

I chop the onion superfine, (I have to hide it from my husband who doesn't like onions but eats them all the time) and find this adds thickness to the gravy. This is a great recipe!

I'm rating this based on the sauce and potential alone because I think I botched my chicken through no fault of the recipe. I had a 7.5 lb bird, and am a bit of a novice with whole chicken roasting. An hour in, and the chicken was still raw as can be. So I did the 20 min/lb rule and followed the instructions. When it came time to flip, the chicken literally fell apart, so the flip was impossible which left me with very soggy chicken skin. Parts were really moist, and other parts were really dry. My bad...The sauce however was dynamite! I followed the instructions exactly and my boyfriend and I loved it. I'll definitely try this again, maybe with a smaller bird or with chicken parts instead.
