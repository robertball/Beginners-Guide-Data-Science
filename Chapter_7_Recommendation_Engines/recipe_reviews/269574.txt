Used blueberries and strawberries. Can use any fruit you prefer. The almond breeze is so good in it.

I used 2% milk and dried cherries and was delicious. Easier to make a triple batch so had breakfast for several days. The almond extract added a nice change .  This was a yummy oatmeal.

I have made this 3 times and the only change I made was to add a small amount of agave syrup to sweeten naturally.
It is so wholesome tasting and keeps me full until lunch.

My daughter in law made it for me and now that’s become a staple for me. But we do add walnuts in addition to the other ingredients and some pure maple syrup for more sweetness. Heaven in a jar.

So easy. I love it. I have added raisins, cranberries, bananas, whatever I have at the time. I have also added maple syrup and brown sugar.
