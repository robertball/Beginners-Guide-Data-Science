I have made this tourtiere twice and here's what I learned:

1) it's better to boil the potato pieces for about 10 minutes before adding them to the meat mixture (1st time they were undercooked)

2) we thought the original recipe was pretty good, but found we didn't really care for the cinnamon and cloves, so the second time I made this, I omitted them. Might taste a little less like a true tortiere, but it sure makes a delicious meat pie that even picky kids will love.

3) If you think you have celery in your crisper and realize at the last minute that you don't, a cup of frozen peas tossed in makes a great substitute.

4)Tasty recipe and very easy.

This was okay. I used 2 potatoes and didn't use celery as I didn't have any. I shredded one carrot, and chopped another up. I chopped everything into small pieces and they all came out fully cooked. 
I've never had French Canadian food before, so I wasn't used to the combinations. While it was okay, I think that next time I will omit the sweet spices (cinnamon, nutmeg & cloves) and substitute savory such as marjoram, garlic powder, onion powder and maybe basil. The flavors didn't mesh together for me.

This is absolutely the best Tourtiere although I did add 1 tsp Allspice for authenticity. For ease and consistency, I put the potato, celery and carrot through the food processor, chopped very fine.  I did as another reviewer suggested - cooked the meat the day before.  I used Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust for the pastry - this is the best pastry.  And I made the pies into 5" tart size.  We had one last night and the rest I've frozen.    I was making these for gifts so I 6X the filling recipe and doubled the pastry recipe - got exactly 16 small pies.  A tourtiere is different from a regular meat pie.  Leave the spices out and that's what you've got - a regular meat pie, not tourtiere.  I put the rather dry pastry scraps into the mixer, added a little water (maybe a TBSP), added 1 c. grated cheddar,  mixed well, rolled out into straws and baked.  No waste and delicious.

Loved this recipe.  Easy to make and tasted delicious.  I've been looking for a tourtiere recipe for years and I've finally found the one!  My husband ate it for supper and then lunch the next day.  Thanks.

The spices complement the vegetables well. I  added salt to my serving as it need something. It was excellent after that. I've also made this like Shepherd's Pie by omitting the potatoes and crust, and spreading a layer of mashed potato on top.

My husband and I love going to Quebec for Christmas every three years.  This recipe reminded me of the wonderful scents that came from the local restaurants.

I used a mixture of ground beef, ground pork and ground veal, which is easily available at the grocery store.  Mincing the vegetables were a task, but well worth it.  The spices were perfect and filled my kitchen with a wonderful savory scent.

It was snowing really hard yesterday and this dish fit the bill with a hungry husband who spent the whole day out on the road.

This recipe is definitely a keeper in my recipe box!

This excellent pie makes a great dinner for family or company, something out of the ordinary. If you have not experienced French Canadian cooking, you may find the flavors unusual, but very delicious!  We added an extra potato.

This is an excellent recipe.  The spices are just wonderful and would be perfect for a Christmas pie (in fact, I plan to make it for my inlaws this Christmas).  This time, though, I made it using an empanada maker as little mini-pies to have as appetizers.  If you do this, I'd recommend adding the potato at the same time as the other veg along with a little more water and simmering for about 20 minutes ( you want the potato to be firm tender).  This is because the bake time on the little pies is only about 20 minutes instead of the full 45, so the potato won't get done in the oven.  This quantity of filling will make about 3 - 4 dozen 3.5 inch diameter empanadas.  If you reroll the scraps, you can get about a dozen from one 9 in. crust, so you'll need four crusts for the entire batch.

My mother turned her nose up at this at first.  She said it smelled like a mince meat pie, which she KNEW she didn't like.  After she tried it though, she was wowed.  Has asked me to make it again for her.  I liked the cinnamon and cloves, gave it a very nice hearty flavor.

We loved this. I made it exactly as written, except I only used one crust. I put it in a casserole and topped it with crust. Delicious!

I did not have any ground pork, so I doubled the beef.   Also boiled carrots and potatoes separately with some chicken gravy mix and water instead of bouillon...  SO GOOD!  My husband said it's a keeper!  Served with a green salad and fresh sliced tomatoes...  YUM!

So good, I did spice it up a little. I added 2 tsp cumin and 1/4 tsp allspice. Other reviewers said the potatoe was under cooked I don't think they chopped the potatoe small enough. Dice them just like the carrots and celery and it will turn out lovely! This is my new meat pie, so good!!!

**Please note that while the ingredient list states that 1 pie crust is needed, the directions refer to 2**  Although I am partial to Cincinnati-style chili, and am used to beef flavored with cinnamon and cloves, I thought the measurements in this recipe were a tad excessive. I wish I'd added them a little at a time - they were so strong, I had to omit the allspice completely. I managed to avoid the undercooked vegetable problem by adding more stock to the meat mix, and simmering it for about 12 mins. Perfect. Thanks, Wendy!

This sounded like an odd combination with the meat and spices but it was EXCELLENT! We loved it! I made it exactly as called for except used beef bullion instead of chicken since that was all we had. I did not have a problem with undercooked potatoes. I think the key there is to cut them really tiny which is what I did. We'll definately be having this again.

Finally!  I've now found a recipe to rival my father's!

Our grocery store sells a 'meatloaf mix' which is 1/3 lean ground beef, 1/3 ground pork and 1/3 ground veal.  This is the only change I made.

I doubled the recipe and am so glad I did ... because now we have another whole pie in the freezer for New Years Eve!!

My husband is still raving to his family about the Tourtiere we had on Christmas Eve!

Could just be me but it was far too salty. Will put one cube next time and it probably didn't help that I used back bacon too, though I always use the three mixes when I make a pie and it has never been salty. Otherwise I am sure it is a good recipe.

This is delicious. I've never had shepherd's pie before. Next time I will not add the bouillan and will reduce the clove as that was a little overpowering of a flavor.

I don't know what an authentic tourtiere would taste like, but I found the flavor of this recipe to be bland.  Otherwise, I did take the advice of other cooks who chopped and parboiled the potatoes and this seemed to work fine.  The cooking instructions were fine, just not a great flavor to me.  Perhaps adding some Maggi seasoning would help.

This was a good recipe. I omitted the potatoes since my Mom and grandmother's recipes didn't have them in them. I doubled the recipe, and baked it in a jelly roll pan. I baked it at 450 degrees F for 15 mins, then lowered the temp to 350 degrees for the remaining 30 mins. It was GONE at Christmas dinner and was asked for the recipe from all who were there!  I made it a day ahead, and just reheated it the next day. This recipe lends itself well to that and freezing for a later date.

This had a very dry crumbly texture that was not what I was looking for in a meat pie.  Also, the potatoes were still very firm which made the whole meal a flop.

fabulous, thanks so much for sharing!  My husband loved it.  I used ground veal instead of lean ground meat, and added a 1/4 teaspoon of allspice and instead of water I used chicken broth.  Its a keeper!

I thought it was good, but members of my family did not. I changed a few things. Since I didn't have ground pork on hand, I substituted it with turkey breakfast sausage. I also used chicken bullion with spices, instead of plane. I doubled the garlic and added 2 potatos.  Overall the yeast was sweet and savory, but my husband didn't care for the sweet spices.

This recipe was okay but it was not what a tourtiere is like in Quebec.  There are no potatoes in tourtiere and there is not chicken broth ... I'm not quite sure what nationality this Tourtiere comes from and it didn't taste bad but it was not a Quebec recipe.

Quite good and I'll make it again. Next time I'll omit the cinnamon and cloves too.

It was too dry. It was like eating flavoured ground beef in a shell. I expected some sort of gravy or juices

This is delicious! I added some poultry seasoning to the filling and turmeric to the top crust. My whole family loved it! We ate on Christmas Eve. Thanks for the wonderful new tradition!

Liked but not loved. Recipe didn't mention you needed 2 crusts, so I only used a top one. Cooking potatoes pieces with carrots will soften them. Would make again, reminded us of pasties.

My mother made this every Christmas Eve.  We would go to midnight mass, come home, open one gift and eat tourtiere.  It was magical.  She still makes one pie for me at Christmas for my family.  We don't attend midnight mass anymore, but we ALWAYS have this at Christmas Eve.  I should make it more often - it's a fabulous cold weather treat or meal.  I leave off the nutmeg - it's too much for us.

I've made this several times and it is really delicious and pretty simple.  I like the spice combination, even though it is different from what's usually used with ground pork & beef.  The only thing I change is I leave out the onion and garlic (I can't eat them) and use some celery seed in their place. I definitely recommend this.

I followed other reviewers' suggestions and boiled the potato, carrot and celery. Other than that, I followed the recipe and my boyfriend and I really enjoyed it! I found the mix of spices very unusual but it totally worked! I served with a side of caesar salad and tomato soup. There was a lot of filling leftover after packing a 9" crust. That's okay though - I put the excess in a Ziplock bag in the freezer. It'll be a quick dinner by throwing in some brown rice and serving with a green salad on a side. Will make again!

Excellent.  Great flavour.  I've made this more than once and it always turns out.  The only change I make is to grate the carrot and potato.

My husband and I thought this was very good.  The spices were not over powering. I used the "Miracle Baking Powder Pie Crust" from this site, which came out very flaky, tasty, and a perfect companion with this meat pie.  Will make again and again.  Thanks for an excellect recipe.

My whole family loved this and it was easy for a beginner to cook, though time-consuming.  The great part is that it uses ingredients that we keep around the house, but the staple dessert spices give the "same old" a completely new spin.  My approach was to use only beef (it was all we had), boil the potatoes, and not worry about the egg wash.  Everyone was pleased, so we'll be doing this again soon.

This turned out beautiful.  The taste was what I expected, (from the ingredients listed) but I think it needs a sauce of some kind, some gravy or something to bind it together. Oh, I only used pork and no cloves. I hate buying spices for one recipe and never useing them again. All in all it was good.  Thanks!  AND can someone tell me the correct way to pronounce tourtiere?

An outstanding recipe that always goes over well.  Lots of chopping (thank goodness for food processors), but the end result is always great.  Use the leanest meat you can find!  Thanks!

This recipe will become a new favourite in my family.  The instructions were easy to follow, and I had all ingredients in my pantry. I made the recipe as written and the only thing I did extra was to thicken the sauce in the pan, with a little corn starch mixed with water, before putting it in the deep dish pie pan.  It cooked up like a dream and tasted delish!  Thanks a lot! 5 stars in my household.

Definitely a keeper.  I lived in Quebec for 10 yrs and people made it to their liking, so as far as I am concerned, there isn't only one way to make it traditional.  I had found a Martha Stewart version in a cook book years back and really liked it.  I lost the cook book and her online version is different.  So with that being said, I followed this one pretty similarly as it reminded me of hers.  Only thing I did was to just use clove and nutmeg (leaving out cinnamon) and added ginger as I recalled she had that in hers.  Was very tasty, thank you!

I stayed mostly to the same theme making this pie, cinnamon, cloves etc but didn’t worry about the quantity so much. I added extra potato. Delicious.

Hits the spot perfectly! If you aren't a fan of sweet and savory mixed together, you probably won't like this, but its a personal favorite of mine so this dish was perfect for me! I used chicken broth instead of bouillon because I ran out, and substituted a 1/2 green pepper for the celery just because I never use enough to buy that giant bundle and throw the rest away.  And I did 1/8 tsp of each seasoning and also added 1/8 tsp of all spice. Next time I will add more carrots and maybe try a different meat than ground beef. Maybe ground sirloin? I'm just not a fan of the flavor of regular ground beef.

I made this and was very pleased with the result - the seasoning is excellent - changes to note:
I doubled the recipe and made one big pie plus 4 smaller ones to give away - wonderful Christmas gifts.
I simmered the meat, veggies and seasoning for 20 minutes then cooled.  This allowed the veggies to be cooked.
Next time, I will cook and mash the potatoes ....add to the simmered mixture (as per another recipe) - this would give it a better consistency.

Great recipe.

I couldnt use many vegetables, so it was a tad bland (cook for picky eaters). I added extra potatoes for more filling. I also didnt have a top crust so I used a handful of cheese as the topping instead. Turned out great!

My husband loves this! He always likes to eat it while watching Game of Thrones. I also really like it. I must say though that I rarely add the carrots or celery as I don't usually have them on hand. I also zap the potato in the microwave for a couple minutes just to get it a little soft for going in the pie.

I loved it! As another reviewer stated, it did seem to have a lot of onion in it. I like onion anyway so it wasn't really a problem for myself. I will have to look closer at the different chicken bouillon cube options at the store. I used the Knorr brand and 3 seemed a little too salty for me. Not sure all bouillon cube are equal in size or saltiness. Otherwise, awesome recipe! Oh, and I used about a 1/2 - 3/4 cup of frozen peas in place of the celery as other reviewers stated.

Overall recipe was very good . Made exactly as written. Found that it was a bit salty. Will probably use low salt bullion or reduce the bullion cubes to 2.

Great recipe, but you do have to cook the potatoes a bit before putting them in the pie. I diced them into tiny bits but they still came out crunchy with the recipe as is, so definitely boil them for about 10 or so minutes before putting them into the oven!!! Great flavors though!

My family and I are from the south and the spices used in this dish are not common to us what so ever. My husband had a tough time eating it bc the taste was 'weird' to him... but I LOVED IT! I ate the whole pie by myself.  I made 2 changes. I used chicken broth instread of boullion and water and I added half  a prepared brown gravy mix into it! I also added some   finelychopped mixed veggies. my toddler didnt even know there was veggies in it!

I was actually looking for a plain English pie recipe when I came across this one. I omitted the cinnamon, bay leaves, cloves and nutmeg, as I just wanted that Meat and Potato flavor. It was excellent, just what I was looking for. My 3 year old gobbled it up too!!!

EXCELLENT! Our entire family loved this.  I did not use the celery, and only used the cinnamon.  Added garlic powder, basil, oregano, and salt.  The results were fantastic!  My 7 year old told me I "could make this any time!"

Just great, doubled the recipe, omitted the cloves (didn't have ground cloves), added small amount of cayenne pepper, cooked and mashed the potatoes.  Really good.

This came out pretty good. I agree with the other reviewers with the fact that there isn't enough liquid. I took that into account and added 1 packet onion mushroom soup mix as well as water mixed with a little cornstarch before adding to the pie crust. It still was a bit on the drier side. I actually enjoyed the nutmeg, cloves and cinnamon. The flavors were subtle and not overpowering. Perfect.

My family enjoyed this very much.  I did change it quite a bit to suit our tastes.  I left out the spices except the pepper and added a seasoning blend.  I added almost one can of cream soup since many reviews thought it was dry and added some cheddar cheese.  My family likes crunchy veggies so I didn't add the celery and carrots until the very end of cooking the hamburger mixture on the stove.  I also used all hamburger since I didn't have the pork on hand.  It turned out beautifully and very tasty.

Very good! My aunt and I made it and were impressed with the blend of flavors. We mostly stuck to the recipe with a few minor changes we had seen in the comments. Its a keeper and we'll make it again!

I think it needed a thickener, maybe a little gravy.

This was very good!  I did the recipe exactly as written and it came out perfectly.  I used a roll out premade crust.  I've seen this recipe with Paprika and I'll probably add that next time.  Otherwise, the mincing was the hardest thing.  I'll definitely use my food processor next time.

After reading the reviews I tried to tweak this to our liking.  I love experimenting with ethnic foods but also like to please my family so in place of bouillan and water I used 99% fat free beef broth, excluded the bay leaf since my husband hates bay leaf and cut back on the cinnaman, cloves and nutmeg, though it turned out ok it was not well received in my family.  But thats the great thing about all recipes, you make what you like.  Thanks for the post.

This was very good... next time though I will make my own crust instead of using a ready made one and pre cook the potato a bit so I can use bigger chunks instead of small. 
My husband gobbled it up. Thank you
