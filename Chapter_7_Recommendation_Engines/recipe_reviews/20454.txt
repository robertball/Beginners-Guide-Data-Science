This recipe sounds very flavorful, but is suprisingly bland. If you use 1/2tsp Hungarian paprika in place of the cayenne pepper, you will get superb results! (I also like to use boneless/skinless chicken breast).

I was lookin for a change from the same old boring chicken. My family loved this, including my four year old. I cooked it in a roster instead of  the oven and it turned out great!!!!

My husband who is a very picky eater loved it.  And it is so easy I put it in the oven while I feed my 4 mo old.  Dinner was served 30 minutes later.

Does anyone have a recipe that can utilize a half-baked chicken? I got halfway into this recipe and then realized the spices DO NOT mix at all, so you're left with a gloppy, clumped-up mess that you can't even BRUSH onto the chicken, much less "pour" as the recipe calls for. This recipe ruined an entire meal for my family; thank goodness for take-out. There's bound to be a better recipe for Deviled Chicken.

Easy!!  Not as much flavor as I would have hoped for but it was still moist and juicy.  Would definately make again, maybe with just chicken breasts and a bit more cayenne pepper to spice it up.

This is a keeper for life. I did add some of College Inn Culinary broth white wine & herb to the remaining butter, the pour it over the chicken and cook for 30 mins.

I was disappointed with this recipe.  It sounded delicious on paper, but the taste wasn't what I expected.  I really could only taste the paprika.  If I make it again, I would decrease the paprika and increase the other spices and maybe add some onion powder.

This tastes pretty good.  It's also easy in terms of preparation, because there's no chopping vegetables.  The spices, however, tended to clump and burn slightly, making the flavor a little strong in areas.  I didn't really like using that much butter for one dish.  I also prefer recipes that don't interrupt the cooking time.  But my boyfriend loved this chicken, and it was tasty.  I *might* make it again.

Very easy to prepare. My husband loved it, but I thought it was a little bland. Next time I will add more spices to give it more flavor.

Pretty good. I didn't find the paprika overpowering, but it is one of my favorite spices.  I subbed olive oil for butter since it doesn't always agree with me but kept the rest the same.  Was a nice lunch with some leftover veggies.  Thanks for the recipe!

Deliciously moist...I added about a tsp of brown sugar to the spice mix because I like spicy but I like sweet, too.  The drippings made a fantastic sauce to spoon over the chicken at eating time!  I served this with roasted sweet potatoes & red onions that were in the oven for the same time. (The chicken baked covered with foil for the first half of the cooking but then uncovered after I basted with the sauce.)

I used skinless leg quarters for this, though wish I had the skin, maybe I could have given this a five?  But, the reason for the four, is the chicken was uber juicy, and because it was skinless, I covered it with foil the first 30 to prevent over-browning.  and, being it was skinless, the flavor wasn't as bold as I wanted it.

I wasn't too impressed.  I didn't think it had much flavor.  Although I am just learning how to cook so I may have done something wrong.  But I did learn something though.....all this time I have been cooking my chicken on a higher temp for a shorter amount of time....I did it this way and my chicken was juicer than it had ever been
