Delicious! I made mine in a bowl, and the recipe didn't specify if you were supposed to scramble up the eggs or not, so I did. Great combo of flavors, and a nice, fresh tasting breakfast~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

EXCELLENT! tweaked it some to be a little more "figure friendly"...subbed all whites for eggs,   olive oil spray for butter and all cheeses were part skim/low fat...also added quinoa for some necessary carb #s--had this right before my workout...quick, easy and....PORTABLE! will DEF make again and again!

This was seriously a great breakfast! I cut everything in half for one small serving for me. I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta, and it worked great. I loved the Italian flavors and used an Italian cheese blend on top. For the picture, I cut 2 grape tomatoes in half and made into a heart shape for a Valentine theme. I will be making this for breakfast again! :)

Made mine in a soup mug and with Swiss Miss Milk Chocolate mix, microwaved for 2mins. Inverted the mug over a plate and the cake "plopped" down about 5mins later. Perfectly scrumptious as a quick treat. Will consider placing a cupcake liner inside the mug next time.
