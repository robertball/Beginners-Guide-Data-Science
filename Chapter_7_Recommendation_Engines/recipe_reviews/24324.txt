This recipe was simple and very good.  I cut the slices about 1/4 inch, and melted the butter to pour on top.  I then added a layer of dried parsley and a thin layer of seasoned salt.  Came out great- no leftovers!  This is very easy to adapt, also- sprinkle with Italian herbs and Parmesan, or any other combo that goes with your meal.  This will probably become an easy weeknight side at our house.

These Potatoes are defiently a keeper. Very easy to make and every time I make them there is never any left overs. One more thing I put them in a single layer in the baking dish and cooked them for 1 hour for a more tender potato. Hope this helps  :o)

I used red potatoes I had on hand and left the skins on.  I pre-melted the butter, spread over potatoes, and then seasoned.  I cooked them at 375 (i had some chicken in the oven too) and it worked just great.  These were simple, easy, and tasted great.  My husband loved them!

SOOOOOOOOOOOOO FAB!!!!!!!!!  We served this with flank steak with horseradish sauce (from this site) for company and he couldn't stop raving about how good these potatoes were!  I sliced my potatoes, put them in a baking dish, dizzled with melted butter and added the seasonings.  I baked mine at 425 for about an hour because I doubled the recipe.  I didn't turn the potatoes- some were crispy-some were soft..........soooooooooooo luscious!  Make these!!!!!  They're delicious!!!!  I eyeballed the season salt because I used salted butter and didn't want to oversalt- use your judgement and you won't be disappointed!

Good, not great.  Laying butter slices on the potatoes didn't seem as practical to me as just drizzling them with olive oil, tho' melted butter would have achieved the same thing. The baking temperature of 350 degrees seemed low to me, so I raised the temperature to 400 degrees and I was pleased with that higher temperature.  I also used fresh parsley rather than dried, always a better choice if you have it available. I sliced the potatoes lengthwise, about 1/2" thick, which made them particularly attractive on the plate. Sprinkling them with a little freshly grated Parmesan cheese gave them the pizzazz I think they cried out for.

Loved these...incredibly easy to make and both the grown-ups and the kids loved them.  I did cover with foil to speed up the cooking time and then took it off to crisp them up.  ALSO, the (few) leftovers we had were perfect "hashbrowns" the next morning! Thanks for a quick and easy alternative potato side dish!

This is one of our new favorite snacks. We actually went a little bit more unhealthy and add cheese and bacon to the top! Very good!

This was super yummy. we were tired of eating mashed potatoes, even though they are my favorite. I made a little more than this recipe calls for. I used 6 potatoes, 1/2-3/4 tablespoon dried parsley, and about 5 1/2 tablespoons butter. Salt to taste. My husband LOVED them. he went back for seconds, only to find that my mother and father-in-law had already eaten them lol. EXCEPTIONALLY DELICIOUS:)) thanks for sharing

We didn't think this recipe came out very well.  It was too salty, and it wasn't clear whether we were supposed to put the potatoes down in just one layer or in multiple layers.

versatile and very good any way you make it!  Layering them single layer, I wasn't able to fit much in one pan so I made two.  One I followed the recipe and used a bit of Italian seasoning.  The other when the first side was done cooking and I flipped them over, I took the suggestion of another reviewer and added a little cheese, cooked and broken up bacon and green onions.  Totally decadent but very good!!!  My husband and son liked the cheese, bacon and onions one.  I liked them both.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for an easy way to make a delicious side dish!!!

These were fine in my opinion. Not anything mind blowing or special - just potatoes. I thought the butter might add something my usual olive oil didn't, but I think I prefer the olive oil (and it doesn't hurt that it's better for you). I'd also increase the temp to brown them a little more - potatoes were a bit mushy.

Very good but I didn't use close to all that seasoning salt.  Directions would have helped if the thickness of the slices had been indicated but as it was, I made 1/4" slices, basted them with melted butter, baked at 350 but I left them in the oven for almost an hour., sprinkling Parmesan cheese on for the last 20 minutes.  Beautifully crisp and tasty.

These potatoes were easy and delicious!  I did add some garlic powder and topped with Parmesan cheese as suggested.  And did bump up the cooking temp to 400 for a nice "crisp on the outside, soft on the inside" texture.  I love that you can use your creative juices and flavor them to your own liking. Wonderful!!

Delicious!  My guys really liked this simple recipe.  I sliced the potatoes and laid them in a glass casserole dish.  I melted the butter and drizzled on the potatoes.  I didn't turn the after 20 minutes like the recipe states, I just baked for 40 minutes and they were perfectly cooked.  I had fresh parsley that I chopped as opposed to using dried. The men in my life are huge potato lovers, so I know I will be making this simple recipe again.  We had 'Lucky's Quickie Chickie' from AR and bruschetta using fresh basil, diced tomatoes, green onions and olive oil on toasted hot dog buns with the potatoes.

In place of seasoning salt, I used Trader Joe's Everyday seasoning.

I also covered the potatoes for the first half hour minimum....then uncovered for the last minutes, then hit broil for 2 minutes at the end.

These were great!  Was looking for something other than mashed potatoes.  I sliced them almost half an inch thick, seasoned with seasoned salt and a little paprika for some color, covered for 20 min, then uncovered for another 20.  Turned out great!  Everyone loved them.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe was incredibly easy to make and it tasted great.  My husband loved it.  The only modifications I made was I melted the butter first and I used dried basil instead of parsley.  Awesome side-dish recipe!

I followed the recipe except I did melt the butter then drizzled it onto the potato slices. I cooked at 400° for 50 minutes (no need to turn them halfway through). I took advice of some viewers and the last few minutes I broiled them. I wish I had NOT done that step. That made some of them hard and difficult to eat. The seasoning was just right and the taste was amazing!

They were very flavorful but a little greasy.  I melted the butter but I may have used too much.

One kid really liked it.  The other said it was ok.  Both ate all of their potatoes.  I did the recipe exactly as advertised, but added some bacon bits.  Cooked for 20 minutes both sides.  Good but not to die for.

Super simple, fast and delicious.  Just the right amount of buttery. I used celantro in place of parsley flakes that I did not have in my pantry. I will definitely make this again.

These were really good! I used fresh parsley from my herb garden rather than dried.  I also sprinkled some garlic/parmesan seasoning on them.  Delicious!

Following the other reviewers suggestions, I used melted butter as well. I cut them in the shape of home-made fries because I had my 4 year old nephew over. I used seasoned salt and shredded parmesan. Came out wonderfully! Served ketchup to the kids and sour cream for the adults. Will make it again.

This was very easy and the kids loved it.  I melted the margarine and poured it over the potatoes.  I sprinkled parsley, rosemary/garlic mix and parmesean cheese on top.

To quote my husband, these are very tasty you can make these any time you like. I don't think there's any more to say really. Thankyou Kim.
