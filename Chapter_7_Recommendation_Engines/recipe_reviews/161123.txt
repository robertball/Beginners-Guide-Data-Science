I just finished this up, and have them in the freezer, waiting to be used.  I made Bread Bowls from this site today, and was left wondering what to do with the leftover "insides".  I came across this recipe and decided to give it a try.  I did not use the food processor, as i didn't have a ton of bread to use, i just crumbled the partially dried bread and put on cookie sheet.  I put in oven at recommended temp, and left for 10-12 minutes, stirring once after 6 minutes.  After they were cooled, I put them in a zip lock bag, and crushed with a rolling pin.  Worked like a charm!!  Thanks Jess for sharing your recipe!!

I needed to use up a large loaf of sourdough bread that didn't exactly turn out the way I wanted. After cutting off the exterior crust, I grated it using a box grater. I preheated oven, put enough to layer my airbake pan, tossed in the oven and shut it off. I moved the crumbs around a few times with my hands and just let them sit there with oven light on until they were dried out but not toasted. I did lightly sprinkle and mix in some 'fruit fresh' (it's powdered Vit C) just to ensure some preservation. Anyway...it's basically dehydrating bread crumbs but they work well in place of Panko. I won't be buying those anymore...thanks!

You can make dried breadcrumbs with any type of bread. I just buy a loaf or two of inexpensive, white bread when it's on sale, lay the slices out on my oven racks on low heat until they're completely dried all the way through, break the slices up into my food processor & pulse until they're the desired consistency. I store them in a tightly sealed plastic bag in my pantry. They can easily be seasoned with herbs & spices as needed. Saves me a fortune on store-bought breadcrumbs. For something even easier pulse soda crackers in the food processor.

This is more of a plain bread crumb but shredded instead of processed to a fine crumb. Panko white, is made with no crusts, panko brown is made with the crust included. Both white and brown panko have the addition of a sweetener which gives them a completely different flavor that plain bread crumbs.

Super simple with my Magic Bullet and my toaster oven. I used some leftover rolls from Christmas and they worked perfect.

This is very similar to mine.  Panco crumbs seem to be dryer and cruncier and very white.  I do this on a cookie pan with a baking sheet.  I put them in my food prosessor an chop them fine. Any bread works.  I like the best baked chicken recipe that bastes the chicken with sourcream, Soy sauce, lemon and celery(poppy)seed. As the bread
crumbs cool use the paper to shake them then take chicken and bread them on the cookie sheet and stick it back in the oven at 350 for 30- 40 minutes.  If you stick potatoes in the oven when you bake the crumbs.  Now you have a dinner in ann hour. don't need a whole loaf adjust up from for slices. I also add garlic granuales and other seaonings and melted butter to bread crunmbs before I bake the crumbs.

I save bread crusts in freezer until I have a bag full then use them to make bread crumbs.

I never throw any bread away now - I make my own Panko like rhis - any flavor/type of bread works. Saves a lot of money - they're pretty expensive at the store.

This recipe was a lifesaver, I was so thrilled to find it!  I went to the grocery to get items for my supper, thinking I had panko bread crumbs already at home. Then once I got home & realized I didnâ€™t, thought my supper would was ruined. This took so little time to make, I will never buy panko bread crumbs from the store again! So so happy to have found this, thank you!! :)

LOVE! I decided to try my hand at chicken katsu (a panko-breaded fried chicken), but I needed it to be gluten-free. This was perfect for my needs! It took a little more time in the oven (probably related to flour-type differences), but it made the most perfect Chicken Katsu I've had in a long time. Thank you for bringing Panko crumbs back into my life!

Easy & delicious. Considerably better than commercial bread crumbs.
