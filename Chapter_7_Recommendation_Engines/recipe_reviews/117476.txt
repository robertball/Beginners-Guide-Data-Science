My husband and I loved this loaf! 
For a TURKEY meatloaf it was wonderful! I left out the green peppers and olives (that just didn't sound good to me) and instead of oat bran I used bread crumbs that I already had with some italian seasoning mixed into it (aka Italian breadcrumbs ;)
I also spooned some ketsup ontop of the loaf-I thought it'd get too dried out being uncovered and all....
My husband has requested this a few times already!
Definitely a keeper ;)

This is my new meatloaf recipe! It is not only easy, inexpensive, lowfat and high protein but it actually tastes good too!! I don't eat beef and so I can't say how it compares to beef meatloaf but I can say I have had a couple of disasters with turkey meatloaf and this turned out fantastic. The first time I made it I didn't have any sage or dijon mustard and I subbed wheat bran for oat bran cuz that's what I had, so I skipped the sage and used some honey mustard dip I had in the fridge, It was a little on the dry side but flavor was good. The next time I made it I increased the egg whites to 2 hoping to make it moister, still didn't have any sage and used spicy brown mustard and wheat bran. Voila!! I must say though it doesn't make a huge loaf but it was perfect for my big eater husband, my 8 year old and myself so if you have a lot of people to feed you might want to double it. Also it only took 45 minutes in my oven and I think it may even have been done before that. It's a keeper!

I registered on this site just to review this recipe because it is so good! This will be my meatloaf recipe from now on!  Very versatile - I left out the Dijon mustard and olives and switched the oat bran for italian bread crumbs and added some italian spices.  My husband loved it, he couldn't tell that it was turkey.  I served it with roasted potatoes and a side salad. Thanks for a yummy and healthy meatloaf recipe!

I won't be looking for any other turkey meat loaf recipe.  This was great.  I usually don't like veggies in meatloaf unless they are sauteed first, but I  chopped everything very fine in a food processor and the flavor was good.  I used oatmeal because I don't stock oat bran which worked fine.

I also split and cooked the recipe into a six cup large muffin pan and made little loaf's! Serving size ready and nice to plate!! Cooking time decreases just a little.

This was a very tasty meatloaf, full of spice one of my favorites but it took me almost two hours to cook through!! Very easy, omitted olives and celery salt and used ground up oat meal instead of oat bran to make it gluten free.

Very bland and not nearly as moist as other tukey meatloaf recipes I've tried. Surprising, as it smelled wonderful while baking and the ingredient list looked like it would yield a tasty outcome.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was moist and the best Meat Loaf that I have ever made.  My Husband said he had never eaten such delicious and moist loaf.I 
would definitely make this again.

Delicious! Didn't have oats, so I chopped a 1/2 a bagel in the blender and added that instead. Worked great. I left out the green peppers and olives. Followed others advice about the ketchup on top. Also, about cooking at 350 for 50 minutes. Great recipe.

I had never made meatloaf in my life. I wanted a little comfort food tonight and had all the ingredients for a turkey meatloaf. I selected this recipe based upon the great reviews. And I am hooked! It was easy to made and tasted great with the roasted red potatoes and greek salad that I served with it. Thanks so much for sharing something as tasty, but much healthier than what mom used to make.

I followed this recipe almost exactly (minus the olives) and it tasted pretty bad.  The spice (not sure which, sage maybe?) were overwhelming.  I give it 2 starts because the texture was good.

This is the best meatloaf I have ever had and my husband agrees!!!! We make it like once a week, with smashed cauliflower as a side dish, it feels like you are eating meat and potatoes. I follow the recipe exactly, except a couple of things, I use Low Sugar Ketchup, and I put a thin coat of that ketchup on the top of the meatloaf before i place it in the oven. AMAZING!! Brilliant recipe, thank you!!

Yum!  Made it almost just as described.  Used Italian bread crumbs instead of oat bran, and didn't have quite all the seasonings, but it was delicious!  My boys ate it up (and they are pretty picky eaters!)

This is fantastic! I used a whole egg, rather than just the egg white. Omitted the green pepper (my husband doesn't like them, otherwise I wouldn't have!) and the olives. I used bread crumbs instead of oat bran and doubled the onion and garlic. It turned out amazing! So moist and flavorful. I also only cooked it for about 45-50 minutes. I will definitely be making this regularly!

This was delicious! The only changes I made were to add one more egg white (I had 1.25 pounds of turkey) and I used oats instead of oat bran because that's what I had. This had LOTS of flavor!

So this recipe was a good starting point for me...Thanks!  I've been searching for a good turkey meatloaf recipe for awhile and trying various ones here.  I followed it with these modifications: 1 whole egg, 1/2 cup oatmeal that is soaked in 1/2 cup milk until all milk is absorbed, I sauteed in water: 1/2 cup chopped bell pepper, onions, celery and a grated carrot until soft and added that to the meat mixture.  I omitted the olives.  Everything else the same and it was delicious...even my 5 and 6 year old raved about it.

I'm upgrading this recipe from 3 to 4 stars.  It tastes much better the next day. I omit the green peppers and used bread crumbs. With 10 min left to cook I topped it with Heinz Chili Sauce.  I think it's some trial and error to get the seasonings right if you're willing to experiment.

i omitted:
Worcestershire sauce, sage, olives

i substituted:
red pepper for green (really good choice!), bread crumbs for oat bran, and celery seed + salt for celery salt

This recipe was just what I was looking for.  However, I did customize it to my own taste.  Used the whole egg, italian bread crumbs, omitted the green pepper and olives, used more onion, added crushed red pepper, put ketchup and mustard on top of the loaf, and tomato soup around it for a "gravy" for mashed potatoes.  Yum!

This was good but not great which is why I'm only giving a 4 star.  We added 2 eggs and it was pretty moist.  There was no glaze so we followed someone else's and it was ok.  We will keep looking for a better recipe.

Terrific indeed. I'm going to make it again tonight! I love that it's healthy and that it provides oat bran as an alternative to using bread. I would have never thought of that on my own. Super easy to make and incredibly tasty. Highly recommended.

Fantastic!  My husband loved it better than any ground beef meatloaf I have made.  Praise indeed!  I followed the recipe except that I used oatmeal rather than oat bran because it was what I had.  I also used kalamata olives rather than ripe olives - for the same reason.  My husband said I should remember to make this meatloaf again.  How can I refuse...

I was really impressed with this, so was my boyfriend. We used the leftovers to make sandwiches the next day. Sourdough bread with mozzarella cheese heated in the oven until bubblely...then a big hunk of warmed meatloaf on top...yum.

My entire family ate this dish w/o complaint, which is a good thing!    I bought one of those prepackaged 3 lb. tubes of ground turkey and tripled the recipe to make two meatloaves (one for the freezer).  I omitted the black olives and used Lawry's season salt in place of celery salt, and I also used oatmeal instead of oat bran.  Since I eyeballed the ingredients rather than measuring them, I'm not sure how many oats I used, but I know it was a lot more than called for since the mixture seemed runny.    My family thought there was something a little odd about the flavor - couldn't decide if it was the Worcestershire or the peppers - so we will probably play around with those amounts next time to make it more to our taste.  I topped the meatloaf with ketchup about 10 minutes before removing it from the oven.  Even so, my family still ate it with extra ketchup.

Bland.  I did not use W. suace because most kinds have HFCS, so I replaced it with vinagar and molasses, but still this meatloaf was kinda disappointing.

This was ok; but, if I make it again I will definetly sautee the onions and peppers first.  DS actually cried at the dinner table tonight in protest of the meatloaf and I suspect the white semi crunch oninos had something to do with that.  I liked it though, so I might make this one again with that one change in the process.

LOVED THIS! I have never made turkey before only beef, and this was better than the beef! My husband wants it to be a regular on our dinner table! I did make a few slight changes tho, I added more egg as suggested by someone, I omitted the Dijon mustard and olives, and I changed bread crumbs for the wheatbran, red pepper for green pepper, and celery seed with a pinch of salt for celery salt, just simply because thats what I had in my house. This is a FANTASTIC recipe and I am so glad you posted! Thanks!

We had this tasty meatloaf last night. I did sauteed the onions first, omitted the green pepper (didn't have any), and substituted regular oatmeal for the bran. Everybody raved. Highly recommend.

Not a big fan of turkey meatloaf but this was actually really good.  It had a really nice flavor.  Like the other reviewers, I did add ketchup to the top and used italian breadcrumbs.

This was a good  basic meatloaf but ground Turkey  can be on the boring side so instead of 3 tablespoons of ketchup I substituted 2 tablespoons of ketchup and 1 tablespoon of seracha (to give it a little more flavor) also added some sautéed mushrooms in place of the bell peppers/just because I had some leftover mushrooms on hand.  Substituted the breadcrumbs for the oats & I put the catchup on top (as other reviewer's had suggested) turned out good.  Served with mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables.

This was delicious!  I did make a few changes though at the suggestion of others.  I halved the milk, vinegar, and bread crumbs (used crumbs instead of oats because I had an old sourdough loaf from SF that needed to be used).  I sauteed the garlic and onions before adding to the mixture and gave them a splash of white balsamic vinegar just before they were done (this gives them a nice bite once in the meatloaf).  Also, I omitted the celery because I didn't have any and I used basil/thyme/oregano because that's what I had fresh on hand. For the glaze, I mixed together 3/4 c of ketchup, 1/4 cup of dijon mustard, a couple tbsp of worstechire, a tbsp of sriracha, and a pinch of brown sugar.  I cooked it for an hour at 350* and it came out perfectly cooked and VERY moist.

This was terrific!  DH (a non-poultry fan) loved it, too!!!  A few changes because of our tastes and what we had on hand:  I subbed Italian bread crumbs for the oat bran (didn't have any).  Left out the olives because we don't really like olives.    The meat loaf came out tender and very flavorgul.  Thank you!!!

Excellent flavors!  I think next time I will try baking it with some ketchup on top and bake it a little less - it was a little dry for my tastes.

I am trying to find the perfect turkey meatloaf.  This was pretty good but not exceptional.  I would make it again while I search for that perfect recipe.  I did add ketchup to the top while baking because my family likes meatloaf that way and I didn't want the top to turn out dry.

This cooked to 160 in 15 minutes.  I let it cook to 190 in 20 minutes.  Any more cooking would have dried it out.  We will have this delicious meat loaf often.

I've been making meat loaf since I was knee high to a grasshopper.  That is many, many years.  I had ground turkey last evening and knew I wanted to a a meat loaf with it.  I've cooked with ground turkey many times but usually masked in chili or spaghetti sauce.  This was fantastic!  I did add in about a 1/3 pound Italian sausage for flavor and binding.  I exchanged the green pepper for a ploblano, only because that is what I had in the house.  It gave it recipe a really nice flavor.  Hubby LOVED this.  That surprised the heck out of me.  I knew he'd eat it, but actually giving it praises was another thing!  This recipe will be on hand the next time I have a pound of ground turkey in the freezer and need a fairly quick meal.

My children, from 4 to 17 LOVE this meatloaf. My husband always loves a good turkey recipe. This is easy and I follow the recipe except for olives. Turns out perfectly every time! Super moist too. My family of four finishes the whole thing off in one meal, so the serving size is proper.  Yummy!!! Never thought I would like let alone love a 'turkey' meatloaf, but I do!

My first review of an allrecipes recipe.. This Turkey loaf is wonderful!! I doubled the recipe, following almost exactly w/ these minor exceptions..  used 2 whole eggs. Sauteed the onions, bell peppers and celery. Used 2C. of Italian bread crumbs and a can of diced green chili's.. a splash of white wine and also made a glaze of the ketchup, Worcestershire and Dijon to put over the top.  (no brown sugar). Made into a loaf and  baked 375, covered, in a 9x13 for 30 min and uncovered for around 35 min or until done. Wonderful!! Im not a red meat eater.. I have found a new "Meatloaf" Try It!!

Very good, tasty, simple, easy and fast. I made a few changes: 2 whole eggs, regular mustard, no green peppers. The whole family approved and my husband packed it for lunch the next day, when it tasted even better.

Better than my beef meatloaf, not dry at all.  Used oatmeal since I didn't have bran, and that turned out good.

I had to make a couple of changes because of the ingredients I had on hand. I used a whole egg instead of an egg white, used Progresso Italian bread crumbs instead of oat bran, and instead of the marjoram and sage I used 1/2 tsp of poultry seasoning. Omitted the olives, also.  It was DELICIOUS.  I jotted down my changes so I can make it again. This will be going into our regular rotation!

My husband is so picky and annoying about meatloaf.  I made this recipe tonight and he LOVED it, as did I.  I used Italian style Panko bread crumbs and Italian seasoning, including the sage. After reading others reviews, I decided to add a glaze to the loaf of ketchup, worchestire and italian herbs, for the last 10 minof cooking I added a mozzerella/provolone cheese mix on top. It was so awesome, I'd give it 100 stars if I could!! Thank you for this recipe :)

Yummy!!  We all loved this!  Next time, I need to be sure to cup the  onions and peppers in small bits so it's not so chunky.  Top with ketchup for last 5-10 minutes of baking for extra flavor and moisture.

I did di a few things different though.....instead of oat bran I used oatmeal and instead of green peppper I shredded some zuccini and yellow squash (I try to hide veggies when I can) I also added just a little bit of beef bulion in place of the salt.

I used two egg whites and added oregano to the recipe.  We love onions and green peppers, so I added a bit more than what the recipe called for. We were skeptical for a turkey meatloaf, but it was very moist and tasty. Will make again.

Best turkey meatloaf I've ever had and low calorie, too! I also substituted Italian (prepackaged) breadcrumbs for rice bran, and used brown sugar mustard instead of Dijon. This is a great recipe and I think the minor ingredients are very flexible to tweak to taste without ruining the texture, moisture, or consistency of the meatloaf.

This turned out really tasty and is an easy prep.  Mine came out a little wetter than I had hoped but I didn't follow the instructions exactly, using a whole egg and having an oven that is nearly impossible to keep at an even temperature.

Excellent meatloaf!  So much yummier than ground beef recipes I have tried. The oatmeal is a great addition - made it very moist.  We add ketchup and my kids eat it up.

Love this recipe! I cook it for my husband all the time, but instead of oats I use Panko bread crumbs and no bell pepper. It comes out great every time!

I was so looking forward to this after all the great reviews - I followed the receipe and maybe I did something wrong but it was super dry and pretty bland - family tried to be nice, but after I tasted it and proclaimed I didn't care for it, everyone else agreed and said don't ever make it again.

Great recipe! Well received on numerous occasions. I usually do several times the recipe and make it in muffins tins, so I can freeze some to eat a few at a time. I don't keep oat bran, so I just use oatmeal ground in the food processor. And I prefer red bell pepper to the green.

I LOVE this recipe.  I've made it about 5 times now.  I do omit the green pepper, olives and marjoram (I never have it).  I also substitute sea salt for the celery salt and add a few extra "shakes" of dried thyme. It is so moist and flavorful.  It's a great way to dress up the taste of turkey meat.  This is the best turkey meatloaf recipe ever!

Terrific! Made it for myself and my parents. We all thought it was wonderful.I only made 2 substitutions to use what was on hand...Oatmeal for Oatbran and Jalapeno for Green pepper. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. It was moist and tasty. I will make this meatloaf again.

I loved this recipe.  I've never had turkey meatloaf before and this was a huge hit.  It was moist and very tasty. Will definitely be making this one again.

This was just ok. It needed something else to make the flavor more interesting. I'm not sure what- maybe bbq sauce instead of ketchup, bread crumbs to improve the texture?

Even my beef loving hubby loved this meatloaf. I didn't have oat bran so I used 2 slices of wheat toast. It had a great flavor. I will be making this over and over.

This recipe was pretty good.  My kids thought it was ok and my husbank liked it alot.  I did leave out the olives and I used celery seed instead of celery salt.  I took the advice of another and baked it for 50 min at 350.  I also used 2 egg whites instead of just one to moisted it up a bit.  I replaced the oat bran with bread crumbs to add a little more of a taste.  I will probably make this again but not anytime soon.

I followed this recipe closely and found it  to be a bit bland.  Perhaps one should add more worcestershire, steak, or terriyaki sauce.

This recipe was good. I do feel like it needed something - maybe more ketchup. But very good - and based on other readers, I cooked it at 350 for about 50 minutes and it was perfect!
Thanks!

This was a great recipe, especially to brush off the chill of fall. I used quick oats instead also. The loaf was very moist and flavorful. I can't wait to eat the leftovers!!

I followed the recipe exactly, and I just didn't like the texture of the turkey loaf using the oat bran.  Also, the cooking time recommended is too long, mine almost burnt on the bottom of the pan.  Next time I think I'll use either whole oats or bread crumbs and will cut down the cooking time by about ten minutes.

This was really good, even though I made a lot of changes.  I didn't have any bran, and I didn't have breadcrumbs, so I used whole oats instead and it worked fine.  I added some dried basil, oregano and thyme, and left out the olives and pepper because I didn't have any.  Next time I might try a red pepper.  My husband really liked this, and it's healthy to boot!  I'll likely make this again.

I was really impressed by this meatloaf. I used spicy mustard instead of dijon, and thought it turned out great. I didn't even miss beef.

Definitely not a favorite. Flavor not bad but cooking time is WAY too much and it is more like meat "bars" than loaf - very thin in the pan. Maybe better if done in a loaf pan? May try to tweak the recipe and give it another shot. Quite disappointing after reading the other reviews.
