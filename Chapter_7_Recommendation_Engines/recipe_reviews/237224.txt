Yes I will make it again but I must admit I tweaked it because of what I have/had on hand. I do not use condensed soup. So I made a roux and thinned it with beef broth to make a medium white sauce (flavored with some garlic and ginger and curry powder, s&P) to replace the soup.  I doubled the recipe- half to take to a pot-luck and half for my family. Added some frozen peas for color and chicken to make it a meal. The mayo is an unexpected ingredient for certain and not necessarily strictly authentic BUT gives a 
creaminess to the sauce that is great. Skipped the crumbs and almonds cause I did not have either. All in all a good recipe that I will use again. Thanks for sharing!

Probably the best potato casserole ever!!  I had to substitute 1% milk for the coconut milk and cream of mushroom soup for the cream of chicken as I had neither.  I added approx. 1tbsp of chicken paste to the mixture.  The cauliflower went perfectly with the potatoes... We absolutely loved it and it will definitely be a regular dish for us!!  Thank you so much for posting it! :)
