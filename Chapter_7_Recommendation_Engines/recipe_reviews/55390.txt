I made these this morning, adding one shredded granny smith apple. These browned really quickly for me. I served them with the Apple Cider Syrup I made last night. I liked them a lot but the kids were lukewarm about them.

Good taste but I think I messed up.  The recipe says to use "2 cups complete pancake mix".  On the back of the pancake box, it says mix 2 eggs, 2 c. dry pancake mix and milk.  Although I knew to use the apple cider in place of the milk, I wasn't sure about the eggs.  add? Not add? I choose not to so the pancakes turned out a little doughy but I'll try this again, with eggs, to see if they're fluffier.  The flavor was still good. Also, I reduced the nutmeg and cinnamon by half and increased the vanilla to 1 tsp.  This does remind me of fall and we served with hot apple cider.  Hopefully next time, they'll turn out right.

I've tried these twice and I love them as do my friends. I followed the recipe exactly and it always leaves me wanting more. One twist I've added is to slice up and cook an apple on the stove top along with a little sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. The cooked apples served on top of the pancakes go great with the traditional butter and syrup!

These were simply delicous! I'm 14 and I made these when I had to baby sit the neighbor's kids one morning and they had 3 small children, and they made me make them 4 times! I made them at home this morning and put some small pieces of chopped apple in them and used apple butter instead of butter, though I consider using syrup but it was delightful! (I put a little less nutmeg 'cause I'm not a nutmeg person! And I used pecans instead of walnuts,... mmm)

Best for an early fall morning.  Must use only the COMPLETE pancake mix - the kind you only add water to.  I'm not a big nutmeg fan so i cut it in half and it was still great.

My best friends in the world and I woke up this morning after a long night of gabbing, catching up, and lots of laughs.  We knew we could not finish the slumber party without cooking brunch - it's a long standing tradition.  Unfortunately this year, the sixth friend was unable to make the breakfast due to a car accident.  The rest of us were hesitant to cook her famous waffles without her, so we logged on and found this recipe.  I added two eggs to mine, in addition to some heavy-duty mixing, a little more vanilla, and chopped apples.  My friend Jenna, the hardest to please (the food expert of the group - also the most rotund if I may say so), actually asked me for the recipie and we made another batch and brought it over to our friend in need.  Thanks for making our stomachs full, our mouths happy, and our injured friend comforted with the flavors of fall.

I made these with Bisquick, and also used a mix of walnuts and pecans. Really good with a drizzle of maple syrup. Thanks!

Tasty, and the walnuts are a nice touch.  Full of spiced flavor, but they do cook a little different than the average pancake.

Followed the recipe except that I added an additional heaping TBSP of Brown Sugar just b/c we love BS sooo much.  Very fragrant while cooking and very tasty eating.  My batter was a bit lumpy when I used the complete pancake mix.  I want to avoid that next time, so I will make my own mix from scratch and see if that helps. I would definitely make this again and put it on on pancake rotation.

These are really good pancakes, although I might cut back a bit on the cinnamon next time. A nice variant is to chop an apple up into the batter, and serve with butter, honey and hot cider.

Very yummy!  I do not typically use mixes, so I used my homemade pancake batter as usual, only omitting the milk and substituted with 1 cup of apple juice (didn't have any cider on hand).  They turned out great!!  Will fix again!  I topped them with warmed, homemade apple butter!!  MMMMM!

I ALWAYS make a recipe as written first - but this one is an exception.  I followed the Bisquick recipe (since that was what I was using as my "complete pancake mix") and used eggs.  I added all of the ingredients on here as listed, except for the apple cider, in which I'm certain I used quite a bit more than called for to get the consistency I wanted.  The scent while cooking is unbelievable.  I did have to play with the consistency and the temps on my stove to get these right, and I never actually felt like I actually got them perfectly done.  Oh well - they were good, and we'll make them again as stated.  Thanks.

so good! I only had spiced apple chai cider, so i used that instead...and i added 1 egg to bisquik mix instead of the complete pancake mix. Per another reviewer's suggestion, i sauteed apple slices in sugar and cinnamon and put them on top.  Really really good. My boyfriend ate about 8 of them, and my 2 yr old had seconds as well!

These were really yummy.  They do have a lot of cinnamon and nutmeg flavor, but I like that.  If you aren't into that much spice, cut it back.  We used apple butter on top in place of syrup and it was awesome.  Next time I will add some chopped apples for a little bite (we aren't nut people, so we left that out.)

I decided to make these when a friend had given me some apple cider.  They weren't bad - I think I will decrease the amounts of nutmeg and cinnamon next time, tho.  It was a rather strong spicy taste, but some probably like it that way!  Also, it didn't take anywhere near as long to cook on each side as the recipe states.  Use your own judgement!  =)  I also did not use the walnuts (not a nut fan) or the butter flavor cooking spray, since I used a nonstick pan.

This was an awesome recipe. I didn't follow the directions exactly though. I added the spices until they looked right. My siblings and I loved it! I added an egg to the mix and then milk to and simply adding the apple cider with it. Added some chai spices as well just to mix it up a bit. Great job! Thank you for this recipe. I think it is now a household favorite. =)

This recipe was awesome.  Fall in New England=Apple anything!  I took another reviewers suggestion and added the 2 eggs and I also chopped up an apple.  I highly reccomend this recipe to anyone who has some cider and apples laying around.

Delicious! They taste like much fattier apple cider donuts! I used Bisquick and just swapped the cider for the milk. It might have been my imagination, but these seemed to cook more quickly than normal Bisquick pancakes.

I just made these this morning and they were pretty good. If i make these again i would probably decrease the amount of nutmeg, it was a little overpowering. But overall a very good recipe.

Very good. It has a little too much cinnamon and nutmeg for my taste though. Next time I will use less of the spices. I didn't have any apple cider, so I used apple juice. When I make these again I will add nuts (didn't have any this time) or raisons. Overall a great recipe!

These turned out terribly for me, but it could be partly due to the fact that I used my normal "from scratch" recipe for the pancake mix part.  Perhaps the amount of flour wasn't the same?  These tasted good but were chewy and tough...

Nice idea for taste, but very heavy and tough pancake.  I didn't change anything in the recipe either.  I might try this again, but next time use a ratio of water to the cider when mixing with the complete pancake mix.

These were so great.  Used the "Fluffy Pancakes" recipe from this site instead of boxed mix, substituting 2/3C of apple cider for the called-for milk.  No nutmeg, so used a dash of allspice.  Left out the walnuts and brown sugar, and added a diced, small apple.  Wonderfully apple-y and good.

The taste in these is really nice! I think I'll cut back on the spices a little next time for a more subtle taste. That being said, I didn't make the actual batter as stated, so here's what I did, if you're looking for a bit of a healthier twist:

-1 1/2 c wheat flour (or do half wheat, half white)
-1 3/4 tsp baking powder
-dash of salt
-3 tbsp melted butter (I use Smart Balance)
-1 egg OR 1 tbsp milled flax seed with 3 tbsp water
-1 1/4 to 1 1/2 c apple cider
-spices

Mmmmm!

I think this would have been better with the walnuts--to counteract some of the sweetness.  I thought they were good, but I next time I am going to make a reqular pancake batter (I am not really a fan of the complete mixes).  They are really sweet, but a fun deviation from the normal breakfast.

I used Bisquick with the 2 eggs.  I substituted apple cider for milk and added the spices suggested.  It was fluffy and delicious with apple butter.

I substituted apple juice for apple cider because I could not find any. But they were still really good.

Great!  A wonderful taste of the fall season.   I added a chopped apple and raisins and they were still fluffy.  Will decrease the amount of cinnamon next time, as I would like to taste more of the nutmeg.

These were very good and I thought they had the perfect amount of cinnamon.  I was glad for the fist review that mentioned adding the eggs - I did and they turned out great.  Yum!

We really liked this recipe. It seemed like a touch too much cinnamon though, so I may use less next time. Thanks for the delicious treat!

Delicious and a great way to sneak fruits and such into a kids diet.  Mine does not like fruit so I sneak it in wherever I can.  I made these, turned around to put more on the plate and she had not only took one, but the whole plate!  Luckily they were silver dollar sized so no big deal.  She loved them.

Some of the best pancakes I've ever made! I never have pancake mix hanging around so I made my own with 2/3 regular flour and 1/3 whole wheat. I also omitted the walnuts since my husband doesn't like them. I just toasted some and added them to the top of mine. I will definitely be making these again!!

These were delicious!  I made a mistake and used a bisquick-type mix so I just added an egg to the batter.  I'll use a pancake mix next time because I'll definitely be making these again!

Very good. I would decrease the amount of apple cider by about 1/2 a cup or so because as is, they are pretty watery but besides that VERY yummy. You don't even need syrup. They taste great plain too!

I liked the taste of these pancakes, but found them to be very tough (perhaps I should try a different brand of pancake mix).

We used this recipe for breakfast after Thanksgiving with a crowd.  It was a huge success.
I omitted the brown sugar because the cider was very sweet.Try it and enjoy.

If we do again, it will have either chopped apples or raisins added.  Definitely less nutmeg.

Good recipe for days you're out of eggs. I am not a fan of nutmeg by itself, so I did add a little allspice and ginger to balance it out. Made this recipe as waffles instead of pancakes. They smelled great cooking, very "fall" and comforting, but needed syrup to top off the flavor.

Made these this morning after picking apples last weekend.  I followed the recipe the way it was except I added 2 finely diced apples to the batter.  Turned out great.

These were pretty good. I used incomplete pancake mix- add milk, egg, sugar, vanilla. They came out quite thin...so I added a little corn starch and some more pancake mix to my batter, along with a squirt of milk. Still quite thin. I'm 14 and made these easily, they're very easy to make. They brown/burn easily, so keep a close eye on the edges. Use a wide pancake flipper too, as theyre very thin. I would have given this 5 stars if they puffed up well. Good job msredkitty! Definitely awesome- I served with Sweet Butter on this site.
