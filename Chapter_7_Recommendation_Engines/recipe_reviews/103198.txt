We loved the taste of this soup.  However putting it through the blender was a big mistake.  We all agreed that it ruined the texture.  I will make it again, but will not puree this soup.  I think I will even add some spinach leaves and some rotisserie chicken chunks next time.

Luxurious, delicious soup. Fine texture, keeps you coming back for more.   Perfect for a special occasion.  I followed the recipe exactly as stated and it turned out great.

Absolutely delicious!  I used jarred artichoke hearts and strained the soup after blending but before adding half and half.   Velvety texture and no strings!

Excellent! I used 3-4 minced cloves of garlic instead of the one, and I used fat-free half and half. Second time I made this, I made dumplings and cooked them in the boiling soup. EVEN BETTER!

This was one of the most delicious soups I have ever tasted, and I have tasted a lot of soups! I substituted homemade vegetable stock to make it vegetarian, and also added about 1/2 cup extra artichoke hearts.   I will be making this again and again and again!

Yum!!!  I made it for 4 instead of 8 and followed the proportions pretty closely.  I used a can of artichoke hearts (15 oz or so) and chopped them.  1 can of chicken broth (again, 14 or 15 oz).  Before I added the cream, I threw in about 3/4 cup water.  I used only 1 cup of half and half instead of the 1.5 it called for because I wanted it lighter in calories.  Excellent flavor!  The lemon is key.  Don't try to use packaged lemon juice.  Go for the real thing.  Refreshing!

We felt this soup just needed the juice of half a lemon. You may prefer more but I suggest tasting before adding the other half. With that being said, my goodness what an unexpected treat! I'm going to leave ingredients partly whole next time without blending all.  However for a dinner starter soup, I would blend and garnish...also strain it as another reviewer mentioned.

Very good, will definitely make again.  However it wasn't as thick as I thought it would be.  Maybe next time I'll use fat free sour cream or just a potato to thicken it up.

Excellent, luxurious soup.  Next time I may cut back just a bit on the lemon and perhaps add some cooked rice (The flavor is quite similar to the Greek avgolemono)

This soup is so unique and complex. A couple of things that I did to save time: 1) used an immersion blender inside the pot and 2) didn't strain, which turned out fine. The second time I made this, I added salt and it was too salty so it would be best to be sure to taste before salting it.

Good flavor, but not as smooth as I thought it was going to be.  I'll try it again another time.

Great! Used cottage cheese because I didn't have any half and half. It sounds crazy but it was delicious.  Also used two boxes frozen artichokes and that seemed to work just fine. Will make it again.

I added a little more lemon, lots of broccoli, chicken, and a little parmesan (little less half-and-half). Yum!

I used fat free half and half and accidentally overheated it at the end a little so the half and half broke, but just a little. Still tasted wonderful.

So easy to make, and a great way to sneak vegetables into your child! My six year old loved it with crackers. It is super fast to make, too. Next time I'll try reducing the fat by dividing the half in half IN HALF and substituting skim milk. Yum.

Fantastic soup that everyone loved.  I only used a splash of cream at the end, since it felt creamy enough without it.  This recipe is a keeper!

Delicious. My new favorite soup. And, thanks to the pureeing, no artichoke haters were any the wiser.

Needs a more hearty consistently too watery and Ionoy used 2 rather than 3 cups half and half.

Great  soup for a cold winter day. I made it exactly to the recipe but added 1/2 cup rice for texture. Added it before I added the half and half. simmered for 20 minutes and then added the 1/2 & 1/2. VERY GOOD

This was a complete waste of perfectly good ingredients.  Watery (not as in yummy broth or consomme) and flavorless.
