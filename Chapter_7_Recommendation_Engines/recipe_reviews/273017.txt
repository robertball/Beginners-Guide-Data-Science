First, if you use an air fryer to reduce fat in your diet, this may not be the recipe for you. But if you are okay with bacon and butter once in a while, then this recipe is terrific! I made it exactly as written, with one small exception. When I began wrapping the bacon around each chicken thigh, it seemed to me that it was just too much butter for each thigh (1-1/2 lb was 5 thighs), so I cut the amount of butter in half (I can use the leftover compound butter for something else; it won't go to waste). The chicken still came out juicy and delicious even though cooking it for the recommended time resulted in an internal temp of 185 degrees. When I saw that, I was afraid that the chicken would be dry and tough, but it wasn't at all. I will definitely make this again but may reduce the cooking time a bit.

Very good. Next time Iâ€™ll buy deboned thighs instead of doing it myself. Only change I made was sprinkling paprika and chili powder mix over the thighs before cooking. Cut into quarters and used for appetizers - big hit with friends.
