So easy, simple and so delicious! I change the white sugar to brown sugar and cut to 1/2 cup only. Turned out great!!! I made this twice and I found that by beating the egg a bit longer, you will get a better spongy texture.

great recipe! I tweaked it a bit: instead of white sugar I added 1 overripe banana and half a teaspoon of liquid stevia for sweetness, and a teaspoon of vanilla extract while keeping everything else the same. the cake did not rise at all hahaha. I think I need to cut back on the water next time, there's probably too much added liquid with my tweaking. 

still amazing though! I've made it twice now. Thank you for such a simple healthy recipe :)

I did as some of the reviews suggested and halted the sugar amount, and the cake wasn’t too sweet. The problem I had was the cake being too dry.

I put half the sugar that you had. Your amount of sugar was the amount of flour which meant that it was too sweet.

Quick, easy, and tasty! I swapped almond milk for the water, added 1/4 teaspoon of lemon extracted, and about 1/3 more matcha power to boast the flavor. Love it! No need for frosting or anything, although whipped cream and fresh berries are a treat.

Amazing! I love matcha and green tea, and this treat was perfect! The cake was nice and light, and not too sweet (but sweet enough)! If anyone noticed my pic, I added some green food colouring on top of the batter and swooshed it around with a spoon to make a marble-effect on top. No other changes, it was simple to make!

This recipe was amazing! The cake was fluffy and SUPER easy to make. Surprisingly, it wasn’t too sweet although the flour and sugar had the same measurements. 

I recommend making the original recipe first and then maybe the second time halting and adding ingredients. I added a little more matcha powder just to give my cake more of a pop

My husband LOVED this cake - most cakes are too sweet for him. This was halfway between a bread and a cake, I read the other reviews and cut the sugar a bit, also using brown instead of white sugar. My matcha powder was coconut flavored, which added a lovely flavor to the finished product. I used a piece of parchment in the pan to help with removal and also found it was done after only 18 minutes.  I dusted with powdered sugar and added a few dots of whipped cream to the curved edge - looked a bit like a piece of pumpkin pie!

(green cake with icing sugar dusting and strawberry slices on it) I accidentally put 3/4 cups of water in but didn't want to triple the recipe so I put in about double for the dry ingredients and honey. It came out really pretty. Pretty dense as you might expect but it was good. Kind of was like a castella cake in consistency and strength. Cut out a slice perfectly. Excellent for photos. Looking forward to trying it with the right amount of eggs next time.

Made it with 1/2 cup of brown sugar; delicious! Tasted more of honey than of green tea, but I liked it all the same.

I agree with the other reviewer. The texture is strange. It is nice and light and I did replace the white sugar with 1/2 brown sugar instead and I like that substitution. But the lack of any oil, and the spongey texture turns it into somewhat like a "steamed" cake...if you have ever tried one. The green tea flavor is very aromatic but without that, the cake would be a very boring one. And the portion is definitely small. Think of it as a 1 inch thick slice x 8 instead of a regular 8-slice cake portion.

This recipe is great! Baking with matcha powder can be complicated, like once I made a matcha mug cake ( I was following a recipe I found online), it used a tablespoon of matcha, and yet when it came out of the microwave it tasted like flour. Oddly though, I ran out of honey, so instead I dipped the tip of a butter knife with app apricot reserve, (like you would do with food coloring but triple the amount) and it tasted amazing! I always make recipes like this in cake pop form, because there is really no need for icing, (that way my instincts don't tell me there is a whole cake on the counter, you have to make some butter cream frosting and top this cake. No doubt that once they got our of the cake pop maker, they were gone in a matter of seconds!

This green tea cake was very odd. It had a weird texture and it definitely tasted like green tea. I love green tea, but I really did not like this cake. I think that this recipe is one of those that you either like or you don't like.

I made this almost exactly as written (I just dissolved the matcha in the water and added it all at once at the end). Next time I would reduce the white sugar to 1/2 cup.  Otherwise, a perfect recipe: easy, fast, and delicious. Also, this could easily make 10-12 slices of cake instead of 8.

This is a really good green tea cake. Very light and not too sweet. Perfect for tea time!
