I hate to see reviews like jazmin's when all the recipe needs is a new name. It seems that aficionados of kalua pork are pretty determined about how it should be prepared. And there isn't just one way, just like there isn't just one way to fix fried chicken. So try Meg's Kalua Pork before judging it. BTW I have it in the crockpot right now, just as she wrote it. I'm giving it 5 stars untasted just to counteract the previous one star review which was also untasted.

Like a few on here it seems unfar to rate this a 1 star when you haven't tried it. There are many ways to make different dishes and again it depends on what part of our country we live in.  It's pretty darn close to what I have used to marinate pork roasts in for several years. I'm going to try it next time I get a pork roast.  We love pork roast, well really just about anything pork.  But this recipe looks easy and tasty to me. I certainly will come back and comment again after eating it but I can tell by the ingredients and how close to what I have been doing for years without a recipe that the meat will be very tender and tasty.

Amazing!  I used Hidden Valley Farmhouse Original Italian with Herbs dressing and used garlic powder and onion powder instead of the onion and garlic cloves. Tossed in a handful of honey gold potatoes and carrots. Started late so I set the slow cooker on high for 5 1/2 hours. It's the best Boston Butt that I've made ever!  My family is in love with this recipe.

Make sure to brown the meat on all sides first to keep the moisture in. This was amazing, my new favorite. We ate it over jasmine rice and made a gravy from the sauce. Juicy and flavorful. Kids loved it too.

Ahhhh this is soooo good! My pork butt was 8 lbs and I'm glad I chose this recipe to have so much leftovers of! I left all the sauce ingredients the same amount, good thing too because that crock was almost full by the time all the fat and juices rendered outta that baby. My soy sauce was reduced sodium, and I forgot to put the green onions on till the last two hours of cooking. My Italian dressing started as a dry mix from this site, so 'homemade' I guess. The whole thing just Works. Yum!

I was skeptical, but it turned out so good!  Only used half of the mixed marinade and used a bone-in pork butt.  Very, very tasty!  Try it!

While the cooking liquid was pretty salty, the meat was fantastic!  I would reccommend this for a frequent go to easy recipe that everyone will be sure to enjoy. 
We didn't use the cooking liquid, but I did store the leftovers in it and am going to fix myself a sandwich right now.  I served with my Boston Baked beans and coleslaw.

The reviews were so good I took a risk and made this the first time for company. It was wonderful! Everyone ate seconds, including a picky 6- year- old. So easy to make and so tasty. I wouldn't change a thing.

For more flavor, try using beef bouillon or beef broth instead of water. And teriyaki sauce instead of soy sauce. And brown the roast before putting it into the slow cooker.

This was delicious and  it was so easy to prepare.   I pulled my roast apart once it was cooked and served it as shredded pork over rice with the juices.  Everyone enjoyed it very much.

I made this just as written and it turned out great. The pork butt was 7 lb and there was plenty of sauce. I diced fresh button mushrooms and removed about a cup of sauce from the crock pot and added it to mushrooms making a nice sauce for the meat. I did thick slice the meat and put it under the broiler for a few minutes to crisp up some of the fat. I will make this again. We are eating Keto and this works well with Keto. Very good.

I just made this today and will be making it again! Next time I will reduce the soy sauce or use low sodium as it was a bit too salty for my taste.

Very easy. Happened to have Kraft Tuscan Italian dressing, purchased low sodium soy sauce and cooked on high setting until done. I took some of the liquid and added cornstarch to thicken for gravy. This was delicious.

It was an easy recipe to follow, and you would think that by using the salad dressing it would come out extra salty, but it didn't so I had to add just an extra 1 tablespoon of salt to give it some flavor. It made the whole house smell so good that I am thinking about adding this recipe to my saturday recipes.

Oh. My. Goodness. This is my new favorite way to make pork. Followed the recipe exactly, except for browning the roast before putting it in the crockpot. So moist and flavorful!

Perfect!  No changes to the original recipe other than, as others suggested, browning the roast prior to putting it in the crock pot.  Amazingly tender and succulent!  Served with rice and my family gobbled it up.  i used a crock pot liner and clean up was a snap.  Thank you.

I cooked recipe as written minus the garlic. I found it very plain but it was well enjoyed by those in my family who prefer plainer food. With the leftovers I added BBQ sauce on bread (tasty), and mixed with rice, salsa an kidney beans (okay).

I was skeptical but made it due to the ease. I am so glad I did!!! I used chuck roast because it's what's available to me. We like very flavorful and seasoned food so I seasoned the meat with salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder. Browned it then put it in the crock pot. I did what the recipe called for the sauce. I did thicken the sauce once it was done by stirring 2tbsp of flour with 1/2 cup of water and then adding it to the sauce (after removing the meat) and allowing it to cook on high for 20-30 more minutes. This was amazing! Yes, I modified it. But who doesn't modify recipes to their personal taste anyways??!

My wife made this and went by the recipe exactly as she doesn't deviate from the instructions in recipes (LOL). This is a very good recipe that was such a hit with our family that my son requested it for his birthday. We used a boneless pork butt and it was tender, moist, and used the gravy to put over rice along with the meat. I never write reviews about recipes but this one was good enough to do so this time. And you can vary this recipe very easily like adding carrots or potatoes. The gravy is soooo good.

Easy and delicious! We had half the people go back for seconds, and can't wait to have it for leftovers.  Some enhancements we made:
1) rubbed sea salt (or course  kosher salt) all over the roast before putting it in the cooker. I use a palmfull (about a quarter cup) and will use half that amount next time.
2) when you defat and shred the pork, also separate and return 1/2 to 3/4 of the cooking liquid to make it super moist.

We liked this recipe.  I did not have green onions so substituted  i/2 chopped onion.  Since there are only two of us, I used a 2 pound roast and adjusted ingredients to slightly more than half (I thought I would need more , but next time will use half or less).  I also cooked on high for 5 hours and it was perfect.  I then used the juice for soup...Needed to add more water because too salty, but if used reduced salt soy sauce might not need to.  Definitely will make again.

This was very easy and used ingredients I usually have on hand. I thought it was a little bland and my pork butt was only about 3 lbs. I thought it would have been too salty like some reviews said but I didn’t think so. I did use more Italian dressing “just because”. My husband, who usually says that I under season, didn’t have any complaints however! I did put carrots in my crockpot as well and they seamed to soak up the flavor nicely and next time I will add some potatoes and cabbage since we liked the flavor a lot!

If I try this again, I'd double the liquid, and double the garlic. As is, it came out dry and bland.
