Cooked as directed except I can't get fresh herbs so I just sprinkled dried parsley, thyme, and rosemary in it instead.  Absolutely divine.  Used a home brew porter for the beer.  Will make again.

After simmering for the 3 hours, I removed the meat from the shank and simmered for another hour (with the shank still in the pot). I used one large lamb shank, instead of the 4 in the recipe and  thought it was an adequate amount of meat, although 2 would have made it perfect.  My husband said it was "pub quality", so this recipe is a keeper.

Oh. My. Goodness. This was sooo good! I used one 1.5-pound shank and used only about 8 oz of stout and about half the amount of beef broth, and I omitted the rosemary. Absolutely wonderful. I used some chocolate stout I had left over, and the flavor was great. I served it with roasted Yukon Gold potatoes. This was my first time making lamb shank, and I will definitely be making this again. Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

I am very disappointed to say that I hated it.  I followed the recipe exactly, so I'm not sure what might have gone wrong, if anything, but it was really bad.  My husband and I both stopped eating it and we threw out the leftovers.  I've had lamb shank before and loved it.  That was not this recipe.

Made this with a home brew imperial stout.  Increased the amounts of aromatics, then used a stick blender after removing the meat to puree the liquid and veggies into a wonderful sauce.

I made this for my mother-in-law this past weekend, because she loves lamb shanks . . . and Guiness.  It was a tremendous hit!  I served it with cheesy polenta, also from this site, and it was definitely an excellent combination.

I DID, however, use my pressure cooker instead of the stovetop method, but that was only because I was shorter on time than I planned to be.  I'm not a huge fan of lamb, but this was so tender and did not taste in any way gamey.  It was very delicious, and I recommend it for something different!

Great, our fav. winter meal.

I use Beef shanks, chix stock, dried rosemary & thyme. I use a porter instead of a stout.
All my variation are due to not having the specified ingredients in the pantry.

Super savory and hearty. We loved it.

I used a local brewed stout for the beer. Only things I did different was no parsley (didn't have any), I added a little bit of crushed red pepper, and I thickened the sauce a little at the end with Arrowroot. I pretty sure it would be awesome with a leg of lamb, as well. Anyhow, it was delicious. Super good.

Delicious!! I highly recommend. Restaurant quality I think, with the addition of a little brown sugar to cut the bitterness of the beer. Cooking Tip: TRIM all visible excess fat from the lamb before browning. I got rid of at least 1 cup of fat that way and did not need to cool sauce to separate fat before eating! This makes for a yummy but MUCH less greasy dish. There was NO gamey flavour, just tender lamb. I also seasoned with salt & pepper before browning. We cooked up organic barley as a side dish instead of potatoes and it goes very well with this stew. Thanks for the recipe.

Not a fan of dark beer but one year it seemed ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY to have lamb and something Irish related for St Paddy’s day.  I made the mistake of ordering the lamb by piece, not weight and it ended up being very expensive.  I gulped, paid and headed home.  I am SOOOOO glad I goofed!   This was one of the most complex, rich, amazing dishes I’ve ever cooked.  It was so worth the expense and we savored ever morsel of the leftovers for days.  It is now our required fare for our Green Day.  And as luck would have it, I found out this year I’m 1/4 IRISH!!!!  There’s a reason for my blarney!

This is good.  I thickened the sauce and used it as gravy on some mashed potatoes.  I did have to top it with sriracha, though, because it was kind of bland. Thus, the four instead of five stars.

If you think you don't like lamb, please give this a try it will change your mind. Served over homemade mashed potatoes,  this has become a favorite at our home.

I had a leg of lamb instead of shanks so I trimmed leg into cutlet sized pieces and used sun dried tomatoes instead of the paste.

Made to the recipe exactly, definitely good for dinner on a wintry day.    I served it in a soup plate over Basmati rice.  Not as savory as I had expected, I did end up using salt (I normally don't)  Cooked the lamb shanks for 3 hours:  fall off the bone tender!  I did have to skim off the fat before serving. Hubby liked it, he is not a lamb fan at all.  Will make again.

Loved it!! Followed almost exactly except I had to use dried parsley & I added some extra carrots to use as a side. I made gravy with some of the extra juice & served with mashed potatoes. It was easy to make & there wasn't too much prep. I chopped the veggies while I browned the lamb. Hubby & kiddos love it too.
