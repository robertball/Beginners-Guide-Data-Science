I have modified this recipe and made it quite a few times. I omit the walnuts but add extra fruit - 1/3 cup each of chopped prunes, craisins, apricots and raisins, and one tablespoon of sunflower seeds. I use regular rolled oats, 1/4 cup of oil (instead of the stated measure). Also, I grate the apple rather than chop it and this makes the mixture much more moist.

I bake in an 10 cup bar muffin tray (instead of the round ones)for around 20 minutes. The result is a golden brown, flavoursome, substantial and very filling jumbo muffin that we use as a breakfast alternative - on busy days we eat in the car on the way to work.

PS. I have also used smaller round muffin moulds and have gotten about 15.

I was delighted to see this recipe in the sunday daily news.  It had all ingredients that I like.  I am wondering if something was missing since it was such a heavy consistency and didn't rise at all nor taste good.  I read the recipe over twice to be sure I had included all the ingredients and everything was as listed.  It was a great disappointment and waste of many expensive ingredients.  Please help.

I made "muffin-tops" out of this recipe- just plopped 2tb onto a cookie sheet and baked at 350 for 14 min.  I used skim milk instead of 1/2&1/2, white flour instead of wheat, and omitted the nuts.  They are absolutely delicious!  Not dry- (wheat flour is very dry and dense- haven't figured out a way to make it taste good yet) Very yummy!

Definately have the oven at 350, not 450!  These are yummy muffins!  I didn't have half/half (nor did I want the calories) so I used fat-free evaporated milk.  I omitted the cranberries and nuts since the family doesn't care for them.  Didn't have quick oats, so I ground 1 cup of regular oats in the blender to make a flour.  I also made one recipe with Splenda and one with sugar.  My husband did not care for the aftertaste of the Splenda muffins, and with only a 1/3 cup of sugar, this doesn't add much sugar per muffin.  I will stick to this next time.  I shredded the apple, as well.  Very moist, yummy and good-as well as healthy!

Pretty good muffin for a healthier muffin.  Used applesauce rather than apple, milk (less of due to applesauce), and regular oats (soaked in liquid ingredients while measuring dry ingredients and spraying pans).

This recipe made delicious muffins.  I had no fat free half and half, so I used rice milk.  I also used regular oats, as I didn't have quick oats.  I used half white and half whole wheat flours, and I grated the apple.  I left out the walnuts because my husband doesn't care for them.  Here's how I put it together:  soaked the oats with the milk, egg, oil and grated apple.  While they were soaking, mix the flours, sugar, salt, baking powder, spices and raisins.  Combined the two quickly and put into a greased, standard (12) muffin tin.  Baked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.   They were light and moist and very tasty.  This is a keeper!

One of these makes a filling, easy to grab breakfast.  I add wheat germ for added fiber and prefer to heat the muffin by wrapping in a paper towel and put in microwave for 20 seconds.

For being healthy muffins these are good. :) I just made banana honey whole wheat muffins and they weren't good so it's a nice change. I grated the apple and added 1/4 cup oil (as previously suggested). I didn't add the walnut and substituted honey (slightly overflowing the 1/3 cup. I'd make these again... oh and they make great mini muffins. Baked at 375 - 15 minutes for regular and 10 minutes for the mini muffins.

Fabulous receipe! The only change I made was to use half whole wheat and half regular flour. I also used dried cranberries instead of raisins. The texture was wonderful and there was sweetness, tartness and crunch all rolled into one. I used paper liners sprayed with Pam and baked at 350 (instead of 450) for 20 minutes. Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe!

A great healthy muffin that is a keeper! I didn't have half & half, so substituted buttermilk.  I didn't find them dry - maybe because I tried not to overbake.  Will make these again.

These came out very dry and much too dense, even for health food. My family would not eat them, although they picked out the craisins, which are always tasty, and munched on those. I thought that I would be okay making a recipe from USA Weekend, but no. I won't make this again.

Love this one. I give these to my kids for breakfast on the run. Variations we've tried: chopped dried dates + cinnamon, chopped firm plums with no spices, apples and craisins with no spice, spelt instead of wheat and raisins - these last were a bit too heavy, but the kids had no problem gobbling them up anyway.

Delicious!  It's healthy and if you use a little less sugar and add some applesauce instead of the oil(or you can use some oil and some applesauce), it's even healthier!  I am always looking for a good whole wheat recipe and this is one.

delicious. I used pear instead of apple and omitted the walnuts. I also replaced half of the  milk (never even heard of fat-free half and half) with applesauce although I had to add a bit more milk. I think that this probably made it more moist. I also used regular oats as that was all that I had but they were still good, just a little more crumbly. I know that I changed a lot but this is still a good basic recipe.

These muffins are awesome! Friends and family raved about the fruitiness of these muffins and said they needed no butter.  I did substitute fat free buttermilk for the half & half, used Cherry Flavored Craisins & increased the nuts to 3/4 cup.  My oven cooks fast, so they were done in 12 minutes.

I made these muffins and had a great time especially with the Christmas smell.  I made a couple of modifications due to ingredients that I had on hand.  I used 3/4 cup skim milk, backed off the sugar to about 1/4 cup, 1 cup frozen cranberries (chopped in food processor), omitted the nuts, 1/2 cup white flour, 1/2 cup wheatgermaid,  2 1/2 tsp pumkin pie spice. Everything else was per the recipe. I then topped the muffins with cinnimon chips before baking.    The muffins were fabulous and pretty good on texture.  The smell through the house was fabulous as well while they  were cooking.  The smell changed as the different ingredients began to cook.

This recipe turned out fantastically for me, but I made a few changes to suit my tastes.  I decreased the half-and-half by a quarter cup and substituted with fresh apple cider I had on hand (tis the season!).  I also added fresh cranberries (that is what I had on hand) and doubled the amount of cinnamon and nutmeg.  I also added cloves and ginger to taste.  Lastly, I crunched up banana chips and put them on top of each muffin before baking.  Delicious and fairly nutritious.  Enjoy!

Everyone in my family loved these muffins, including all 4 kids.  I used honey (1/4 cup) instead of sugar or splenda.  They were dry,but nothing that a glass of milk didn't fix.

I was a little bit weary to make these, after reading other reviews claiming that these muffins turned out dense and tasteless. I decided to give them a try anyways, based on the "healthier" ingredient list, and I am happy that I made them! They definitely taste healthy and will be a good on-the-go breakfast option at my house. The only change I made was to use applesauce in place of the oil. Also I cooked them at 375 degrees for 20 minutes. I think 450 degrees might be too high.

This is exactly the kind of flexible recipe I was looking for this morning to scrape together a Sunday breakfast.  I did two batches of these (big family).  I omitted the walnuts and cranberries in both.  

In the first batch I used a large granny smith apple, shredding 1/3 (for the moisture) and chopping 2/3 (cause I love those apple pieces).  I didn't have any half and half (or milk, even) so I scraped together 3/4 cup homemade yogurt (adding a bit of water to the jar and shaking!)  I also used 1/2 cup pure maple syrup instead of sugar (we like to use unprocessed sugars), all whole wheat flour, and expeller expressed safflower oil. Also, 1T of baking powder seemed a lot to me, so I used just under 1T.  This filled a large 12 cup muffin stone pan.  

For the second batch I did all the same except I used 2 small fancy red apples, chopping one and shredding one.  And for the dairy used 1/4 cup of the yogurt and the other 1/2 cup I used fresh from the farm jersey cream. I got 40 mini muffins out of this batch.

Both were really fluffy, soft and apple cinnamony.  :)  Will definitely be using this again.  Thanks! 

Oh, I almost forgot I baked these at 400, 20 minutes for the large muffins and 10 minutes for the mini muffins.

Tried these at my mother's. They are great! She made the following changes: Instead of half & half she used Silk French Vanilla Creamer. She subbed turbinado raw sugar. Instead of flour she used Bob's Red Mill Spice Apple Bran Muffin Mix. Measured out 1 cup of chopped apples and used pecans instead of walnuts. Then after they cooked she also spread 1/2 tsp of honey on the top of each warm muffin. Absolutely amazing!

Used as a base, this recipe turned out great with exceptionally moist muffins, although I made a number of adjustments.

Doubled the recipe and used 2 cups whole milk which I soaked the oats in for about 20 minutes first. I used a full cup of dark brown sugar, 2 grated apples (medium large), 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp baking soda, and 1/2 cup butter. I always use real butter in place of oil for baking, although sometimes I cut the amount in half if a recipe calls for a lot of oil/butter.

I like big muffins similar to what you get at the bakery but they need extra time to cook at slightly lower heat. Using a large muffin pan that holds six, I made two batches at 400 degrees for 30-35 minutes. Presto!

I liked these a lot but I do agree that they are a bit dry. I'm going to freeze mine & warm them up in the microwave & hopefully that will moisten them up! I tend to make the mistake of not chopping my apples up nice & small so next time I might try mashing them up before adding to the batter. I used applesauce instead of oil & left out the walnuts & raisins. They tasted wonderful but next time I think I'll use 1/2 cup Splenda just to sweeten it up a tad. Thanks so much for all the healthy ingredients.

These muffins are delicious! I used 2/3 cup white flour and 1/3 cup whole wheat flour. Also used regular oats soaked in wet ingredients. I grated 2 apples for the recipe. And WOW! Not too dense with a great cinnamon flavor! Will definitely make again!

I loved this recipe. It took more preparation cooking than regular baking, but the end result was tasty and healthy. Will definitely make again. I used milk instead of half and half, and used quarter cup whole wheat flour and three quarters plain flour. Maybe next time I will try half cup each. I only had oats which I powdered fine to make oatmeal. It smells wonderful when baking and tastes better.

Would like to have seen these rise more, for a more fluffy texture. Pretty much, whatever it looked like when I dropped it in the pan, it stayed the same shape after baking. I used toasted slivered almonds in place of walnuts, using what I had on hand, and baked it at 350, after reading other reviews.
I think next time I will make these as fruit/nut bars, since the texture is so dense. Flavor is fine, might cut out nutmeg next time.

Picture was deceiving... there's no way that picture is made with this recipe.  The muffins were pretty good - although, dense and a little dry.  Wish I'd read all the recommendations for extras before baking.  However, even if you follow the recipe to the letter, they taste pretty good, and you can say to yourself, "they definitely taste healthy!"

Just what I was looking for! My whole wheat flour tends to absorb moisture, so I added a couple of splashes of apple juice as I folded the wet/dry together. The muffins turned out light and fluffy - not dense like I thought they might be given the reviews. I like the tartness of the cranberries along with the apple.

Some ground cloves added some good flavor to this recipe.  Also, I used oat flour (ground the oatmeal to flour in the food processor) instead of the oatmeal.

These were tasty, but I had to make some modifications to suit my family.  I used whole wheat pastry flour to lighten the texture, added another apple, and used 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of 1/3 cup granulated sugar.  They were definitely a hit!

As far as healthy muffins go, these were really pretty good.  My 3 year old and 1 year old ate them, and they reject "healthy" muffins alot.  I used white flour (OK so not as healthy!), whole milk, shredded the apple and added frozen raspberries.  The battery was a little liquidy, but that turned out to be OK.  I used regular not quick cook oatmeal and came out a little crunchy.  Also cooked at 350.  Will definitely make again.

I used spelt flour in this recipe. We liked the muffins, it was kind of like eating apple crisp in muffin-form due to the texture and spices. Next time I will grate the apple to see if the helps with moisture - mine were a bit dry. This is a very healthy recipe and I was pleased with the results. If you are looking for super moist, sweet, light and fluffy muffins you should go with a full fat version made with refined flour.

Oops.. I forgot to put in the baking powder!  I was wondering why they weren't rising.... Nevertheless, they turned out well!  I didn't have a problem with them being too dry, but I did change some things.  I used fresh cranberries instead of dried and I added some more spices.  Didn't have any nuts, so I left that out.  Love this recipe!

I made these with raisins instead of cranberries, and Splenda instead of sugar. I thought they were very yummy & my picky three year old gobbled one up at lunch. My husband thought they were a little too dry but he just added a dab of butter and poped it in the microwave for a second.

Husband and I loved these muffins.  Being a WW member, loved the nutrition facts.  Decided to bake them on moments notice.  Used Splenda, didn't have half-n-half, so I used 2% milk, also used rye flour instead of whole wheat (didn't have any in the house).  Healthy, sweet, wonderful, filling. Going to try them with mixed dried fruit pieces, maybe a banana instead of apple.

I;ve been looking for a low-cal bar or muffin made with wheat flour & here it is.  Tasty, you bet!  All these ingredients together are yummy!  Only thing is I had to "mash" them in the muffin liners,(no big deal on that).  It made me 20 cupcakes(small liners).

I fell in love with these muffins the first time I had them & asked my sister-in-law for the recipe! I’ve made them quite a few times now, but I made a few changes - not to the ingredients - just to the assembly & baking. First of all, they almost burned the first time I made them  in a 450 oven, so I bake them at 425, checking for doneness with a toothpick.  Also, I grate the apple instead of chopping it, which integrates much more easily into the batter. I mix  the grated apple in with the wet ingredients, combine & mix with the dry ingredients, and mix in the dried fruit & nuts last.  I just made a batch & ate 3 right away!

These were really good! I left out the craisins/raisins in place of using more apple, and it worked great! I used a little bit of brown sugar as a sweetener too. My husband loved these! Thanks for the recipe!

Very versatile as you can add any fruit/nut combo you like.  I use 1% milk.  I also make muffin tops as an other reviewer does by cooking at 350 for 14 minutes.

Seriously  is there really such a thing as low fat half and half? ? Surely not. I substituted  brown sugar for white (or chemicals ie Splenda) .
  Tasty muffins and quite substantial too.

Made these as a school breakfast this morning. They came out on the dry side. Next time, I may add additional oil (coconut?) or applesauce to make them more moist. Also... I was hesistant to bake them at 450, but I did for just 15 minutes and I think they were just fine at that high temp.

These are great! And easy! I made them with whole wheat flour, my two year old is obsessed.

Just made these muffins. I used fresh cranberries instead of dried, and no nuts, as I don't like walnuts. The fresh apple and cranberries made them moist but otherwise the muffins didn't have a lot of flavour. I will try a different recipe next time!

The muffins were good. My 4 year old ate two for breakfast which is a compliment. I took some of the reviewers advise and shredded the apple which diffused the taste evenly throughout the batter.  I used regular milk, flour and sugar (what I had in my cupboard) and didn't add nuts (my fam doesn't like). I got 12 small muffins. I will make again maybe using a bigger muffin tin.

I made this recipe exactly as written - the oven temperature is definitely too high.  They were done in about 10 minutes and almost burnt and kind of dry.  However,the recipe was very good - I will make it again but I will decrease the temperature to 375 or 400.  Would give it 5 stars of they bake slower to a golden brown. I also added some cinnamon sugar topping to jazz up the tops a little.

These are good, but I gave them 4 stars because they do not store well.  They get soft and loose something in the process.  Great, hot out of the oven or cool afterwards, but I put them in a ziploc and the next day they were much less in flavor.  If you are making them for a day when they will get eaten at once, definitely give them a try.  P.S.  I added quite a bit more cinnamon and like I said, very yummy!

Very tasty and pretty healthy.  I just made these and am finishing one as I write this...I didn't have half and half so I so substituted equal parts heavy cream and skim milk and they're a bit too crumbly, so I'd go for the 1/2 and 1/2 next time.  Otherwise, great!

I agree that these were too dry. I used buttermilk and grated the apple. They also have a strong flavor of baking powder, even though they did not rise much. Will definitely keep looking for a better oatmeal apple muffin recipe.

These are delicious! So good it's almost like dessert!  I followed the recipe for the most part, though I did increase to 1/4 cup of oil, shredded the apple, used regular milk w/ vinegar trick and added 1/2 cup diced dried apricots.  I reduced the oven temp to 375 degrees.  These were very, very good.  I highly recommend this recipe!

These turned out really good!  Having read previous reviews that they were dry, I added an extra TBsp of oil.  I didn't have all the ingredients so I substituted: skim milk instead of half-and-half, unbleached flour instead of whole wheat, and pecans instead of walnuts.  Fuji apple chunks really made them super moist and sweet.  Great for breakfast!

I just made these and thought they were good. I was hesitant to make them because of some of the reviews said they were dense. I went ahead and made them and I'm not disappointed. I made only 2 changes. I shredded the apple and baked at 375. I didn't add quite as much cinnamon because they are for my toddler and didn't want them too "spicey". But I didn't think they were dense. Oh, and I chopped my cranberries so that my little one couldn't pick them out and didn't add the full amount. She liked them and I liked them. Simple, nothing fancy, but tasty.

These turned out quite nicely...first, the temperature is definitely wrong, which would explain some of the low reviews, I think. I baked at 350 and made some modifications due to lack of ingredients in my pantry. I used 2% milk instead of ff half & half, 1/2 wheat and 1/2 white flour, left out the nuts and dried fruit. I grated 2 smallish apples and threw in a handful of peanut butter chips. My daughter is enjoying these for a healthy breakfast.

Really good.  I omitted nuts and the spices.  Instead I used orange extract; made for a perfect breakfast muffin in combo with the apple and cranberries.  Does not taste too "whole wheat-y."  Made 12 muffins, baked at 350 for 15 minutes.

I went the muffin-top route since I'm overseas and don't have a muffin tin. I also used white flour, golden raisins, and no nuts. Delicious! My son can't eat sugar and has been begging me for his own dessert. This was it. He's happy tonight. I would have given this 5 stars, but since I used white instead of wheat, I couldn't.

I made these yesterday and my boyfriend loved them. I did make a few changes. First, I didn't use nuts or cranberries and I also didn't have any fresh apples on hand. So I used applesauce instead and I also added a banana to the mixture before baking. I also cut out the nutmeg. They turned out really well. The recipe is kind of small so next time I'd probably double it.

Pretty good... I substituted a little more than 1/3 cup brown rice syrup for the sugar and used half white flour and half whole wheat flour.  Also 15 minutes was plenty of time in my oven!!  Will probably make again and add flax to make even healthier!

These were very good.  I didn't have any eggs in the house so I substituted 2 tbsp corn starch mixed with 2 tbsp water and added an extra tbsp of oil.  Turned out great.  Very tasty.

I LOVED this recipe as a healthy option and is great asa breakfast muffin.  Theo nly changes I made, based on the other reviews was changing the temp. to 350, I used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 white flour, I did'nt have half and half cream so I used 1% milk and it was fine, I also added ground flax seed.  The walnuts, dried cranberries and apple are amazing together in this recipe.

I only had white flour on hand and used that. I didn't have problems with it being too dry at all. I tasted a bit of the baking powder though, so I might change that a bit next time. Other than that, they were great and my 1 year old loved them.

Yum! The recipe tasted great despite using plain milk and omitting the raisins and walnuts. My muffins were done a touch early, so keep an eye on them.

So, for a healthy muffin, this was pretty darn good. Relatively low fat, and some good fiber and protein content.

I substituted 2% milk for the half-and-half and used 1/2 cup whole wheat and flour and 1/2 cup of white flour. I also omitted the raisins, nuts, and nutmeg to suit my own tastes. 

I'm VERY glad someone else mentioned the 350/450 mishap or I might have missed it. I baked them at 350 and they came out just fine--I think 450 would be a mistake.

The apples are the best part--next time around, I would use more. The muffins are still moist but could use a little more flavor. 

I will be making these again. Thanks for a great recipe!

Great flavor!  I tried making this as a coffee-cake in my bundt cake pottery at 350... it didn't get cooked by 45 mins... we ate some almost-cooked.  Tasty!  Then I stuck the rest back in the oven at 5 min intervals.  It finally got cooked but I lost track of the time so I really don't know how long it took.
