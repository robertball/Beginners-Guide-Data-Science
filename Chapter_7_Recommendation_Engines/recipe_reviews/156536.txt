I'm giving this recipe 3 stars for being very easy and quick. I used real butter and maple flavoring since there wasn't any maple extract at the store. My fudge turned out very grainy and dry and crumbly, probably from mixing too much, but even though I had sifted the powdered sugar, I had a hard time getting all the lumps dissolved. The fudge was also VERY sweet, even too sweet for some of my sweet tooth kids, but we still ate the whole batch. I might make it again, trying a little less sugar next time. Thanks

Very good! I used whipping cream instead of milk and it gave it a smooth texture ... The icing sugar did go a bit lumpy but we didnt mind at all ... We will make it again soon!

WOW, hard to rate this, other then saying I won't be making this again. I do apologize to the author but something is totally wrong with this recipe. After making it to a T, and seeing what unfolded as the result, I went back and saw, another person mentioning it was gritty. And yes. This recipe is gritty. But more so very buttery. It had the flavor of maple but butter too with the crunch of the walnut pieces. I think and don't quote me on this. I'm not a fudge expert maker. But I feel there is to much butter. While the recipe set up in the beginning and after being in the frig for 4 hours, it was still soft and slightly crumbly when cutting. 15 minutes doesn't do this recipe justice. Before adding in your walnuts, please make sure you get all the sugar lumps that it creates out of the mixture before adding. I know I sifted my powdered sugar very well and it came out very lumpy. I think getting the lumps out as it was cooling and mixing around trying walnuts was just a little understaking. The only thing positive was that this recipe was sweet and had nice flavor if you can get past the overwhelming butter taste. Sorry.

This is a fast & easy way to whip up a sweet treat for a houseful of boys!   This recipe has ALWAYS come out well every time I've made it (I use real butter and Mapeline).  It's easy to keep the ingredients on hand "in the event of an emergency". :-)

It's hard to believe something so easy is this incredibly good. I think the nuts are an absolute necessity, I mean:  Maple & Walnuts?  They're best friends!  Personal taste tells me this could've been a touch more maple'y and a little less sweet.

This was so easy and so delicious.  We debated about adding the walnuts, but decided to. It was a good choice.  I think it really added to the flavor.  One side note...I went to three stores (including a specialty store) looking for pure maple extract.  Does it even exist?  Anyway, I used imitation maple flavored extract and it worked fine, so don't fret if you can't find the real deal.  Enjoy.

I haven't made this fudge yet but am tomorrow.  I do have one important question.  I will find out the hard way anyway lol but I intend to use mapleine (maple flavoring) which may be stronger than an extract.  I will let you know how it turns out.  Let me know if this is not a good idea in next 15 hours.  thanks :)

I tried this recipe with no walnuts and using pur maple syrup. I also only put 13 ounces of sugar. It turned out delicious and amazing, while not being too sugary. The only glitch is the texture. It came out a little gooey and not hard. I wouldnt bring this to a party or give it as a gift. But for a nice family treat, its amazing. Yums from the whole family.

The taste was good, however the consistency was a bit runny and the texture wasn't very smooth. I didn't add walnuts to mine, but I will when I try making it again. The smell is heavenly.

I followed the recipe as written and it turned out great. One tip - my icing sugar comes in 1kg packages, so I converted it to 3 2/3 cups. Very simple and tasty.

I have tried this twice and both times I ended up with a soupy, sticky, great tasting mess.  I cannot seem to get my fudge to firm up at all!!  It tastes great, though - if you like maple soup.

I cut the recipe in half...just enough to satisfy my sweet tooth urge and put some away for another day!!!

It had a great flavor except was very sweet and sort of grainy. I didn’t mind that it started breaking into smaller pieces when cut. I will try again!

Am I the only one?  16 ounce is 2 cups!  Put it together, knew it couldn't be right. After 3 minutes solid liquid, so added 2 more cups powdered sugar it came  out perfect.  Beat it hard til it got thick.  Other problem was the butter burned in tiny areas so used a spoon to remove.  Not sure why the recipe  has not been corrected. Also have only seen powdered sugar in 32 ounce bags.  I didn't need to put in fridge as it hardened on counter.

Very easy and tasty.  A little too sweet for my taste.  I would probably add a pinch of salt next time to counteract the sweetness a little.  I did not have issues with texture like some of the other reviewers, but I was a little disappointed at the size of the batch.  It doesn't make a whole 9-inch pan so you would need to double the recipe if you wanted it to serve to a group.  Will definitely make this again.

Couldn't find maple extract so used maple syrup.  My fudge didn't harden up but it was still tasty and not too sweet.  I used it as a glaze on some cookies.  Cut the recipe down to 12 servings.  Will try again.

I used less sugar and butter, real maple syrup (3T) 

It was so tasty! This recipe is worth doing this again.

I have made this many times minus the walnuts. It comes out with great flavor and decent texture - just make sure you don't leave it out of the fridge or it will soften like a stiff frosting rather than fudge. 5 stars for taste - 1 star for functionality and texture.

I have made this fudge twice and am convinced the success is related to the power of the microwave. Mine is 1200 watts and the powdered sugar was like small rocks. I then put it in my food processor and it came out great. Otherwise I followed the recipe to the letter.  The only problem now is staying out of it.

It didn't turn out for me at all.  It was too gritty and sweet.
