I was looking for a way to mix up taco night and this recipe was it! My kids are picky eaters and they completely cleaned their plates. My husband enjoyed it as well. The only reason I gave it a 4 was because of the amount of salt in this dish. Other than that, it was a hit. Thank you for sharing this recipe.
