Great cookies! My family loved them!  I only made a couple minor changes:   - since I don't like baker's chocolate, I used 2.5 regular 100g bars of Hershey's Dark Chocolate. - changed 1.5 cups of sugar to 1 cup   I found it was easier to blend the dough using a spoon and then a hand mixer and I controlled the texture with the amount of coffee I poured in instead of adding more flour.  For Icing: I found 2 table spoons of cream is not enough at all so I added quite a bit more till it mixed well and had smooth texture but wasn't runny (used hand mixer once again) and added lemon extract instead of vanilla extract for that added flavour. If you have icing in a deep bowl, it's easy to just dip the cookies in there instead of spreading it on them.  I made half a batch with icing and another half withouth. They taste awsome with jam too!  Thank you Madeleine for a wonderful recipe!

The cookies turned out great, did have to add more cream to make the icing.  My kids thought they were delicious.

As others said, really time consuming for the mediocre outcome.  The cookies were blandish and the frosting too sweet for the cookies.  We changed it up a bit and that helped:  added Kahlua (about a teaspoon) to the frosting.  I would probably double the amount of spices in the cookies if I was compelled to try this one again.

Really didn't care for this recipe.  As with another poster it did take quite a while to bake these and they weren't all that great.  The texture was dense and lacking flavor (maybe that's why the icing is included).  The cookie isn't completely cooked after 10 mins, so I had to adjust the time to 18 mins.  Plus, I added almost 8 cups of flour before the dough was sticky enough to roll into a ball.  Also, the longer these cookies sit around the harder they get.  Not a recipe I would make again.

This is the first time I have ever written a review for anything, so I really wanted to save everyone from wasting their time.  This recipe takes FOREVER to make and the amounts for the icing are not correct and I wound up with half of my cookies not being iced.  Don't make these-waste of about 3 hours of your time!
