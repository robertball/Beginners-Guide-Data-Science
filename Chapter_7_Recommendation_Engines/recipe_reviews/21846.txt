this recipe is spot on, it rocks. all i change is that i use real bacon when i can, and wild leeks..not the huge store bought ones..and oh, as for the salad dressing, make a note that it is *miracle whip* not ranch, italian, etc. it means mayo, salad dressing. just to clarify...i know a lot of people who mess that up than down it because they did it all wrong

What a wonderfully fresh alternative to packaged onion dip!  My whole family loves this! I served it as a spread tonight, on fresh bread with tomato slices. It is such a versatile dip, you can add your personal favorites to it as well, like Red Devil, water chestnuts, shredded carrots, or minced black olives.  I definately will be making this again and again!  Can't wait for next year's leeks already! ~DonnaJ

We used to make eat this dip all the time in Slovakia before I came to the US.  We love our cheese dips and have a wide variety to compliment our endless bakery goods.  This one particular recipe is a very popular dip.  You just have to make sure you are using Salad Dressing like a Miracle Whip and not an actual dressing.

I modified a little to reduce the calories.  I used light whipped cream cheese, light sour cream (instead of the creamy salad dressing), Lemmon Juice (instead of white vinegar), and 50% less fat Hormel Bacon Crumbles, black pepper to season.  IT WAS A HIT!

I don't think I used the right kind of "creamy dressing".  I used a creamy italian and it didn't taste very good. I think that if I would have used a ranch it would have tasted better.  I will try again with a creamy ranch.

This dip was awesome good!  Only change I made was adding about 1 cup of grated swiss cheese.  This will be a regular repeat for us.  Also, I was glad to read in a review that the "creamy salad dressing" was aka Miracle Whip.  I was about to use Ranch dressing.

A good tasting dip but it's not clear (as noted in other posts) whether the creamy salad dressing should in fact be real salad dressing (aka ranch) or Miracle Whip. 

I didn't see the other comments before making it and choose a creamy italian. Whichever type of dressing you choose will make up the major taste component of the dip overall. The vinegar and sugar are an interesting addition taste wise and were quite pleasant.

Nice dip, nothing special though for our tastebuds

This dip is fabulous and so easy! I made no changes, unless you call using light mayo instead of regular mayo a change. Well, and I used packaged real bacon bits. I served it with a fresh baguette and everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.

Delicious creamy dip. Per another reviewer, I added some shredded swiss cheese. We served it with raw veggies, very good. I'll definitely make this again.

I followed this recipe exactly except omitted the bacon bits and used Neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese (1/3 less fat). I let it sit in the fridge overnight. I was worried that the raw onion-y flavor would   be overpowering but it was mild and just really worked. Ate it with fresh veggies but would also be good with crackers, raw cabbage as a cole slaw, or a yummy sandwich spread. Props to the reviewers who pointed out that "salad dressing" means Miracle Whip in this recipe. It gets 5 stars for being yummy and just so darn easy.

We enjoyed this recipe! I used 1 cup of Miracle Whip and would probably cut back a little next time because we found it too creamy and rich with the amount I put in. Everything else was great and we followed the recipe as written. We served this dip with plain and garden vegetable Ritz Crackers.
