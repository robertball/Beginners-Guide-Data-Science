I really loved this recipe. It has a wonderful flavor and texture. It is also super quick and easy to make. I did double the vanilla in the recipe but other than that I made it as suggested. Thank you Marge for this wonderful homey pie. This is a definite keeper!!

This recipe was very easy and very tasty. I made it for my grandfather's birthday. He enjoyed it - and so did my 2-yr-old son!

This was a great pie. The recipe was simple but delicous. I added some cinnamon to mine and my family loved it. We ate it when it was still a little warm with some whip cream. I will be making this again and agian.

I didn't know how much I was supposed to whisk the egg and blend the mixture. I think I blended too long and there was too much air inside and my pie was bubbling in the oven! But it tasted great in the end although it was more like a sweet sugar pie rather than a cream pie to me and my husband.

Great base for a pie. If you have any LorAnn's Gourmet flavoring oils you could easily make this pie into anything you desire. I was going to add some cinnamon like most previous reviewers suggested but then I had an idea to 1/3 cup liquid Chai concentrate. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of saigon cinnamon. Great to add fresh whipped cream and a drizzle of caramel on top! Very easy!

This surely was a good homey pie... but it was good and that's all! I mean there was nothing special about it. However easy was it to bake I don't think I'll bake it again.

Incredibly delicious and easy to make. Do NOT use a prebaked crust though. We couldn't find an unbaked premade crust and figured it would be fine. The crust burned but the rest was scrumptious.

Very quick and easy to assemble. The taste of this filling is quite phenomenal. I've added to the recipe a teaspoon of ground cinnamon and about 1/4 cup of raisins just to add some jazz to this already great filling.

This pie is not only simple but really good too. There's even room to fudge a little. I didn't have enough cream nor any brown sugar so I just added more sugar and all the cream I had. It still turned out great!

I made this pie over the weekend I wanted something sweet and had all the ingredients in the house. I loved it! Delicious! I stored the cooled pie in the fridge and it's really good cold too. I never know if you should keep pies in the fridge or not so I did just to be sure. YUMMY!

This is a really easy recipe and very good. I suggest if you like chocolate melt one herseys chocolate bar in the microwave and add to filling. It's awesome. We really enjoy enjoyed this pie.

Excited to find an easy cream pie recipe but found this had no real flavor. It was pretty bland.

I tried this for the first time for our family Christmas and it was a huge hit!! I used a store bought (shame shame) gluten free graham cracker crust but it was still delicious. Followed the recipe as is and but will use more caramel next time.

Filling tasted awesome. I had high hopes but unfortunately it rose high and then overflowed and when I took it out it collapsed! Haven't tasted it yet but there is not a lot left in the pan! Maybe I mixed it too much. The filling was a ice thick cream when I put it in the oven. Suggestions appreciated.

This pie is super delicious! I used the leftover whipping cream and made whipped cream to top the pie. It was fantastic. I will definitely make this pie again.

The filling is a 5 but my crust was burned. I might bake individual servings in ramekins without the crust.

I read all the reviews and saw that some ppl had problems with it setting up. So I added about a half tablespoon more flour and and it set up wonderfully. I was a bit worried since I'd never even heard about this pie let alone baked one and on first try I fed it to family and friends totaling about 10 ppl - so as I sat the pie down I prefaced their serving with "If you don't like it I will take no offence" Well everyone loved it... even raved about the crust (which was a frozen one from Walmart!) So a week later I made 3 more - sent one home with my step-daughter another with my nephew and we kept one. Again it was delicious. What surprised me was that it was just as good cold as it was warm. The 3 pies I made today I used cinnamon extract instead of vanilla and put cinnamon and raw sugar on top. YUM. Thanks for the easy and more importantly tasty pie. This recipe is a keeper! Two weeks later... I doubled the batch and made two more pies. Since most of my family like cinnamon this time I used one teaspoon of cinnamon extract and one teaspoon of cinnamon oil. OMG... you definitely taste the cinnamon. I think it's perfect. I'm glad I didn't sub all cinnamon oil thou - it would have been too much.
