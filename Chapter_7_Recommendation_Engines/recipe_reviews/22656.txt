This recipe is easy and healthy.  I did make some changes.  Instead of garlic and onion powder, I used about 1/2 cup chopped onion and 2 cloves of minced garlic.  I sauteed these in a dutch oven with olive oil, then added the water, rice, bouillion, salt and pepper and brought to a boil.  Then I covered and placed in oven at 375.  It's important the the water is boiling before going in oven!  After 1/2 hour I added the vegetables.  I ended up baking for about 70 minutes, but I think it could have baked for another 10 minutes, as some of the wild rice hadn't popped open yet.  Very tasty and I love how it uses such colorful vegetables!

This is a wonderfully healthy rice recipe.  I love that you can just throw the rice in the pan with your favorite chopped vegies and put it in the oven (stirring every 20-30 min or so).  I will definately be using this one again.  Thanks Holly. (BTW...i added ginger, soy, and lots of garlic, and to me it was great this way)

This wasn't bad, but it was pretty bland and it took a lot longer than an hour for the rice to cook.  The veggies, however, were limp by the time I took the dish out of the oven.  I wouldn't want to make this one again.

I cooked this recipe at 350 for an hour and it wasn't near done so I turned up the heat to 450 and still had to cook another hour.  The veggies were overdone of course, but the rice was still not quite done and there was lots of liquid sitting on top.  I let the entire casserole sit in the oven for another 40 minutes and the rice finally plumped up.  The flavor was so/so.  I doubt I'll make this again.

This receipe is very good when you change a few things around. I suggest adding broccolli instead of red pepper and no celery.  Add 1 can veg broth, instead of 1 cube.  Add water only as needed.  The rice takes far longer to cook, so stiring every 15-20 minutes will help. Add at least 3tbls of salt & pepper for a better taste.  Add chicken to this and it turns out great.  My kids really do love it!

This was fine for a weeknight meal, though it took a long time to cook.  I used broccoli, carrots, zucchini, mushrooms, onions and fresh garlic.  I also cooked it at 375 and it still took over an hour, even stirring every 20 minutes.  I used chicken broth (all I had on hand).  The rice was still a little chewy while the veggies were pretty mushy.  I actually really liked it, but my husband wasn't wild and my kids wouldn't eat it past the one required bite.

I liked the final product, however, it did NOT cook for 1 hour in the oven.  I had to finish cooking it in the microwave because my main course was finished and my guests were waiting.

Overall, I liked this recipe. I cooked it at 375 for an hour and 15 minutes to and an hour and 30 minutes. It definitely wouldn't have been done in an hour at 350. I also added mushrooms, which I sauteed in butter first, and fresh onions and garlic instead of onion powder and garlic powder.

The cooking time was an hour longer than the recipe called for, but it turned out great once it was finally done. I wonder if cooking the rice before baking would be a better idea.

I made this recipe and changed it a lot and it was okay.  I made it for a large group (35 people) and the multiple to 30 servings was enough to feed at least fifty as a side dish.  If you are multiplying it for more folks, keep that in mind.  I left out the bell peppers, put in broccoli, used real onions (I should have used real garlic too) - and used large corningware casserole pans to make it in.  It took about an hour and a half to cook, too, but I was making it the day before so that timing difference was okay for  me but anyone making this dish should know that that part is a little off in the recipe.  Everyone who ate it seemed to like it all right,  but in spite of my efforts to follow the suggestions of the other reviewers, it was still kind of bland. If I made it again on a small level I might do it in the pressure cooker and add some zingy spices. I don't discourage people from trying this recipe because it is a very healthy one, but if you do try it you might want to practice with it first on a small level with some of your favorite spices before serving it to a group of guests.  This recipe is a good effort at healthy food and I do like that.

With all the vegetables in it, the chopping took awhile but once it was done, all I had to do was plop it into the oven( maybe a food processor would be quicker?). It is very pleasing to the palate though. I was very pleased with the final result.

Even my brother (a chef) liked this recipe.  As I did not have bouillon or margarine, I substituted 2 cups of chicken broth (skipped the water) and olive oil.  If in a hurry, perhaps pre-chopped vegetables can be found in the produce or frozen foods section of the grocery store.  It took 2 hours to cook - not unusual for brown rice - and then I fluffed with a fork, covered again, and let it sit for 10-15 minutes.  It would be a great way to use left over meat (chicken, turkey, pork roast, etc) - just cut into bite size pieces and add to casserole about 30 or 45 minutes before serving.  I will definitely make this again.

My son and I made this dish together.  Next time, maybe we'll add some broccoli
or some potatoes and maybe a little more spices.  Overall, pretty good.

This was a great side dish. I made it for the first time and my company loved it. You could add meat for a main dish too. It was super flavorful and tasty. I didn't put in zucchini and it was still great. Also, I used chicken broth as a substitute . Definitely  a winner at my house.

I added two tablespoons of capers for a little zip.   I think adding green beans would be good too.  It took about an hour and 20 to cook.

I Love this recipe.. but I hate mushy vegetables so I really recommend partially precooking the rice. I usually put the rice in my rice cooker for about 20-30 minutes. This gives me time to chop and slice the veggies. I just use what ever is in the fridge that needs to be used up. Also not a big fan of powdered flavorings so I add a clove or two of minced garlic and a couple tablespoons of chopped onion.

While I appreciate the nutritional value of this recipe, it was not well-received by my family.  None of us liked it (adults or children) and I ended up throwing the leftovers away.  Also, the prep time is a lot longer than 10 minutes unless you have a food processor.  I was disappointed.

This was a superb recipe!! I will definately make it again. It was so much simpler to make than other rice casserole type recipes I've tried. Next time I'll experiment and add in some broccoli or toasted pecans. Mmmm....

a great, nutritious recipe.  i love the fact that all the ingredients are mixed together and then baked, as opposed to pre-cooking anything.  makes it really easy!
