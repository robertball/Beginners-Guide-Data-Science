These are pink and I have 2 daughters--need I say more?  I did have to substitute strawberry Jell-O for the cranberry, but it worked well.  The mini M&M's didn't stay whole when added, so I think I would either leave them out or try the regular-sized ones next time.  
This is a fun treat!

This is an awesome snack, treat or breakfast bar!  I did not have the exact things called for so I used cherry Jello, and instead of candy I sprinkled mini chocolate chips over the top when done and pressed them in.  Cherry-chocolate bars!  I even used organic cereal to counteract my guilt about the food coloring in the Jello, lol.  Loved this!
