I was pleasantly surprised by these! Usually I find things with stevia to have an aftertaste, but these really didn't. (I did use Pyure brand stevia). I used dark chocolate chips and added a couple drops of vanilla extract, but kept everything else the same. These baked up beautifully. I've never made lava cakes before, and these came out right the first time. I did end up baking mine about 14 1/2 minutes, and probably ended up using about 6-8 oz of dark chocolate chips. I will make these again--and maybe add a little coffee to the next batch for an extra oomph of flavor!

This recipe is a keeper!
These cakes are delicious and decadent, but using a good quality chocolate is the key in this. I suggest Ghiradelli 60% cacao and upping the amount of stevia to 1/3 of a cup.

These came out adorable and delicious! After coming home from the store I realized I did not have a block of chocolate, so I used cocoa powder and a tablespoon of shortening. Then, I did not have heavy whipping cream because it had frozen in my refrigerator! lol. But, it was still good without it. I will make these again.

Nice cake! It looks like a very elegant dessert. A little too sweet for my taste and reminds me a little bit of a brownie, not the texture but the flavors. A great alternative for a diabetic person or someone on a diet.

I substituted almond flour to make this grain free also.  We enjoyed this very much and will be serving it for our holiday dessert with fresh whipped cream on top. Low carb.

I was skeptical, but these were really tasty! What an elegant dessert, and guilt-free! I'd make these again.

I used a different brand of stevia. That was my only alteration. These tasted awful. They weren't sweet at all. You could only taste the bitter unsweetened chocolat.
