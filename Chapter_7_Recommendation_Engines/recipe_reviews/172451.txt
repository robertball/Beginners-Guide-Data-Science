They tasted like almond but were too sandy. They barely hold together and I followed the recipe exactly.

I've used this recipe 4 times already, it not that sweet but you can add more sugar as needed. It's quick and easy and taste good!

Dough could not be rolled out and was way too crumbly as written. It needs a touch more liquid to bind it better. However, it was nicely almond tasting.
