Very good! I liked that this used less mayo (I used Hellmann's light mayo). I also used less bacon than called for, just to keep it a little lighter. Made earlier in the day and kept in the fridge until ready to serve. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I followed the recipe exactly.  Look it to a family BBQ and everybody raved on how good it tasted.  I will definitely make this again.  Maybe next time I will add some halved cherry or grape tomatoes and feta cheese to give it a little Mediterranean flare.
