This cake is moist and delicious!  Love this recipe! I have made it about 10 times and each time it comes out perfect!  I made no substitutions, followed the recipe exact.

I have never baked with dates before so making this cake was exciting. There was a lot of sugar in it with the dates and 1 cup white sugar but it didn't taste overly sweet.  Everyone enjoyed it but I couldn't help feeling like something was missing.  Maybe some toffee sauce or creme fraiche to pour on top. Thanks for the recipe.

This cake has a wonderful flavor and texture.  My husband loved it and requested that I put it in my rotation for his treat with his morning cup of coffee.  I agree, it's perfect with a cup of coffee.
