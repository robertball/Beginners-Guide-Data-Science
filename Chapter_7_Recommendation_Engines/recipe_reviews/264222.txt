Super smokey and delicious with added twist. I prepared as described. Rather than BBQ, I placed in an electric smoker using 50:50 mix of Apple and pecan pellets in a pellet tube (available thru Amazon). Slow smoked for 2-1/2 hours at 185 then an additional 30 minutes at 375. Turned out excellent.

I seared these on my Lodge cast iron griddle and finished them off in a 400 oven for 15 minutes.  They came out fantastic.  I used the Hillshire Farm hot smoked sausage and if you like heat in your food, you will love this.  It's very quick, easy and guest worthy.

These are DELICIOUS! I followed Deb C’s method and seared them then finished them in the oven. The folks I served them to loved them as well. I wouldn’t change anything about this simple, company-worthy recipe. It’s a great spin on jalapeño poppers and I could see these being served at any casual party. Yum!!

We LOVED these!!!!! I didn't have access to my grill today, so I  air fried these at 400 degrees for about 15 minutes or so, turning halfway through, which worked perfectly! For the simple amount of ingredients these were super flavorful and the whole family gobbled them up and said I should make them again...I will! Thanks for sharing.

These were so good!  My husband agrees that we will make these again.  They are really good sliced up cold as an appetizer as well.
