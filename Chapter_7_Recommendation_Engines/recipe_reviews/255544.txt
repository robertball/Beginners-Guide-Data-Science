Made as written except that I used fresh boiled chicken. This was pretty good. The ranch seemed to overpower to me so I ended up adding more taco sauce to tame the ranch. Not a pretty dip but it was easy and tasty.  It doesn't make a whole bunch so you might want to double the recipe if making for more than a couple of people. On that note, if making a single batch I will only use half of the ranch packet the next time I make this and only use the full packet if I am doubling the recipe.
