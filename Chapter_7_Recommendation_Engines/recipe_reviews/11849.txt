I can't believe that this dish is rated so high!!  I followed the instructions exactly as laid out in the recipe and it tasted awful!! We used top quality cheese, but the dish turned out very greasy and oily and had zero flavour.  So be forewarned that if you buy good cheese, you're looking at about $10 and it's just no good.

It was our first Dinner Party in our new house, and my SO's 30th birthday.  A doubly special event.  I was struggling with a Vegetarian guest, and another guess that would not eat a vegetable if his life depended on it (he is a meat-and-potatoes-hold-the-potatoes kind of guy).  I thought this dish would be safest, pasta and cheese.  Who doesn't like pasta and cheese?  It turned out awesome!  I added some mizithra to the mix, which is just what it needed.  Also, not sure if it is clear in the instructions, but it is even better if you brown the butter (and use BUTTER, not that margarine stuff)

This is good. I did make a couple changes though. I cut back on the butter (used butter, not marg) because a couple people said it was greasy. And, like a reviewer before me suggested, I used a bunch of roasted garlic (2 big heads actually) It was very simple to make, and turned out well. Pasta, cheese and butter! How can you go wrong? :)

Growing up, my grandfather always let me eat my spaghetti with just butter.  This is a grown up version of that.  I think that roasted garlic would definately give it a richer flavor but for me, it was great the way it is written.  You could spruce it up with some sauteed spinach-saute it with the roasted garlic maybe.  Anyway, this recipe is simple, and with good basic ingredients very good.

This recipe is a good base recipe... and it's as good as you make it. For the garlic butter, if you use margarine and garlic powder, it's going to taste like margarine and garlic powder... kinda like the frozen garlic bread you get at the grocery. If you want a more upscale flavor, use real butter and minced roasted garlic. A half cup of butter is a LOT of butter, so you might want to cut that back. I only used 2 Tbsp butter and found it to be fine. Also keep in mind you're using a lot of cheese which will release some fat when it's cooked. If just cheese and pasta sounds a little rich (I thought it was) feel free to toss in veggies of your choice. I like artichoke hearts, sun dried tomatoes, kalamata olives, onion, spinach, etc. Overall it's a good dish, and a nice change from the same old spaghetti.

This was quite nice, except I would suggest butter instead of margarine (I think it tastes better), and real garlic to enhance the taste.

This was sooo delicious! My kids loved it! The only thing different I did was substituting five minced cloves of garlic for the garlic powder.

Delicious!  We had a few additions to the recipe, otherwise we followed it exactly.  We added 1 1/2 fresh diced Roma Tomatoes, tons of garlic (as we are fiends), and 1/2 of an uncooked medium sized white onion to the cheese then added as directed.  Next time we are going to add about 1/4 pound of mozzarella cheese and some green chilies.  Defiantly a very flexible recipe as far as additions go.

This was good but I made some changes to give it more flavor.
I melted 1/4 cup of butter and added 2 tsp of garlic salt (the garlic salt I have has added parsley and salts) and basil.  After the noodles were done I coated the noodles with the butter/spice mix.

The cheese I used was Kraft - Italian - 5 cheese.  Has Mozzarella, Provolone, Romano, Asiago and Parmesan.  I layerd the noodles and cheese in a 9" glass pie pan.  Cooked at 400 F for about 30 minutes.  I used 8 oz of noodles.

Goooood. :)

So easy and so delicious!  Definitely a keeper for my recipe box.  Next time I might add sundried tomatoes or black olives as suggested or even spinach or fresh basil before serving.  Loved it!

Excellent & Yummy!!  And soooo quick & easy for us working women.  I also used the "Italian Blend" shredded cheese, and used 4 cheese spaghetti sauce between the layers.  It was awesome.  (although it became an italian dish, not greek)  My husband said it tasted like something from a resteraunt.  I made 1/2 recipe for just the 2 of us, and it was still enough for 2 meals.  A definate keeper!!

This was great and my husband and I loved it!  I also used the already mixed Italian shredded cheese and saved money and time.  At the last minute, I put three cheese spaghetti sauce on top and next time I'll add it to the layers.  Great recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly as stated (except using butter instead of margarine) and it came out tasteless. Not even real minced garlic or the best cheese could save this dish.

Delicious! I sprinkled some fresh basil in the middle and it was wonderful. I also put some garlic in the melted butter. It seems like it could go really great with some chicken or shrimp.

This was ok. It was a bit bland. Something different for a change and not your regular spaghetti. I'll make it again but next time may add some spices and possibly will try and put a light layer of spaghetti sauce in between each layer. Thanks.

I thought this dish was okay! I did use a pizza blend of shredded cheese that had all included and parmesan, so maybe if I followed exactly it would have been great! Everyone at my dinner liked it! I thought it was good but just missing something! I would be willing to try it again!

Mr. LTH enjoyed this and was surprised when I told him we'd never be having it again...  We'll never have it again because I CAN'T STOP EATING IT and there's zero nutritional value to the dish.  It's tastes decadent (how can you go wrong w/butter, cheese, and pasta...?) and I had a hard time stopping myself from finishing the pan.  That being said, I can't imagine using margarine and garlic salt (unless I was in a pinch; they'd they'd work, for sure).  I used butter (and only 1/2 the amount called) and minced garlic (nuked together to melt the butter; it'd be every better sautéing together) instead.  My shredded cheese was a mix of mozzarella and provolone, so I used 2 total cups and 1/2 C of fresh grated Romano.  I also added a pinch of crushed red pepper to the cheese mixture (and would add more I it had been just me eating).  The only other small issue I had was the "medium" baking dish; I've no clue what that means.  I used an 8X8 square glass dish and it fit perfectly.  THANKS for the recipe (not from my hips...)!

Very easy to make!  What made it even easier was using a package of pizza cheese (same price with all three cheeses necessary in the bag!).  I don't know what makes this Greek, but it tasted more Italian to me!  So my family added some pizza/spaghetti sauce to our plates and turned it into a pizza pasta!! Yummy!
