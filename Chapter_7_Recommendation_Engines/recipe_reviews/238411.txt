This was great! I added a traditional roux and used diced tomatoes with garlic and onions. Very tasty!!! You can also add andouille sausage.

Great recipe!  I left out the celery and used 2 red bell peppers rather than the green just due to family preferences.  I also used cubed chicken breast rather than thighs.  The flavor was absolutely wonderful, definitely a hit!  I used the Simple Cajun Seasoning recipe from this site since it's not a seasoning I generally keep on hand.  Like a previous reviewer, I also used Reynold's Slow Cooker Liners when making this recipe- they definitely saved me time on clean up!

Really great flavor, here!  Though not a traditional gumbo (no roux), this is a very easy recipe to prepare.  I followed the recipe exactly, and DH and DS had seconds.  I reserved some for lunch, or they would have cleaned the pot.  I like the taste of okra, and I will add some next time, with about half a package of andouille.  There are so many veggies in this, the only side needed is some crusty bread, to catch every drop of the delicious broth!

Really delicious for such an easy slow cooker recipe! I added some smoked sausage to this, which really came through in the final overall flavor. I also found the consistency to be too thin, so I added some roux. YUM. This was not spicy at all, so next time Ill either add more cayenne, or serve with some hot sauce. A great hearty and healthy meal! The slow cooker liners are a real time saver too!

I've never had gumbo before, so I can't judge how authentic this is. Having said that, we loved this. We served it over the rice and had slices of fresh baked bread as a side. Delicious meal, and super simple!

I changed two things: #1 omitted the cayenne. My husband can't handle spicy. #2 put 2lbs skinless, bone-in whole chicken thighs, instead of 1lb chopped boneless, skinless. (I figured the bone made them twice as heavy so I doubled it.) We had to remove the bones after it was done cooking shredding the chicken in the process. I don't think this made a difference taste-wise, just ease-wise. Shredding already slow-cooked chicken is way easier (and cleaner) than chopping raw chicken.

Very easy and flavorful. I added sausage and mushroom, substituted ROTEL for the stewed tomatoes, cooked the rice in the slow cooker about 30 min prior to adding the shrimp which absorbed some of the liquid making it less soupy. We had thirds... could not stop eating.

Delicious! I like it when my lips buzz a little but if you don't like spicy, make sure you cut down on the cayenne and Cajun spice. I made it to share with a friend who used to live in New Orleans but ended up eating the whole batch by myself :(

5-20-16  ~I wish there was something I could do to rid myself of my distaste for dark meat.  There are so many recipes that call for it but I just can’t do it.  Here too, I used chicken breasts instead of the chicken thighs called for.  And I was happy.  I didn’t add the cayenne, because I don’t like heat in my food, and I’m glad I chose not to.  Between the Cajun seasoning I used and the Cajun andouille sausage I threw in, it was really quite hot enough, thank you very much.  I also added some frozen okra, something fairly new to me, and I enjoyed it (FYI, the frozen was infinitely better looking than the “fresh”).  I’m not sure this was as good prepared in a Crock Pot as it would be in the conventional manner, but it sure was good enough!  Note: I also didn’t use the slow cooker liner, and the pot cleaned up quite nicely and with little effort without it.

This was a delicious and easy weeknight gumbo.  Took me about 15 minutes to throw together.  A few enhancements, I used two cans of tomatoes with okra and one stewed, added sliced andouille chicken sausage, and used a couple of teaspoons of file gumbo.  Enjoyed this recipe!  Thanks for sharing, Reynolds.

Made it to recipe except substituted yellow for green pepper and opted for a bag of pre-cooked shrimp. Really yummy over brown rice and with crusty bread! Will make again and again!

Very good!  Sauteed onions, garlic, celery and added mushrooms in EVOO before adding to crock pot. Made a roux in the saute pan and added it to crock pit.  Easy and very tasty!

Very tasty! I was looking for a way to prepare chicken thighs that was new and exciting and this fit the bill. I had 1/2 of a kielbasa sausage in the fridge so I threw that in as well. We really enjoyed this. :)
I didn't cut the thighs up because I knew I would have to leave this in the slow cooker for 8 hours and I was hoping to not dry out the chicken. I was able to shred it with a wooden spoon and it wasn't dry at all.

So yummy and even easier to make! I added a little spicy sausage and my husband loved it. I think the Reynolds slow cooker liners were sent from the "cooking Gods". No clean up is one thing that attracts me to a new dinner recipe and I will never use my slow cooker without them. I will definitely be making this yummy dish again!!

super easy recipe to make. We made a double batch (one to eat now & one to freeze & eat later).. For the frozen batch, we cooked the gumbo just 3 hours on high, left out the shrimp, put it into a gallon size freezer ziplock. When it was time to eat, I let it thaw over night in the fridge, poured gumbo into the slow cooker (used a liner this time too, so easy), cooked it on low for 3 hours, added thawed shrimp like recipe above, cook for another hour until shrimp was done, served with rice. YUM!

This recipe is amazing. My family and I raved over this one. I ADORE the simplicity of throwing everything into the crock pot, and the Reynold's Slow Cooker Liners are genius! No clean up at all!! The only thing I added was some diced smoked beef sausage (kielbasa). We also sprinkled on some gumbo file before serving, since I had it! We will absolutely use this again. I love the mix of proteins and the slightly spicy, flavorful broth. Yumm!!

The recipe above reminded me of Campbell's Chunky gumbo, which isn't a bad thing. I substituted andouille sausage for the shrimp, which kicked up the favor.

If you have the ambition, add a roux. Heat 1/2 C of vegetable oil to the point it's almost smoking, then stir in 1/2 C of flour. (This is hot and sticky, so be really careful as you work with this.) Stir the oil and flour as it browns. After 3-4 minutes, when it gets to a reddish-brown, pull it off the heat and add about 1/2 C chopped onions, bell peppers, green onions, or celery to stop the cooking process. Add this to the crockpot. It adds body to the broth and a nutty taste to the stew.

My husbands family roots from Louisiana and we made our first visit there this year. Came home craving gumbo. I use Rotel, exclude bell peppers and celery if I don’t have them on hand. I use the Cajun spice from this website to substitute required spices, 5 tablespoons, cutting salt in half. I also add a roux ; half cup butter, half cup flour. This is FANTASTIC.

This was simply amazing! Great recipe, thanks for sharing. We love heat, so the only modifications I made were to throw in some matchbox peppers form our garden along with a few shakes of hot sauce.

This is a great crock pot recipe. I used chicken andouille sausage in place of the chicken for more flavor. I also substituted okra for the peppers to give it more of a southern flare.

Without a roux, this isn't gumbo.  It should only be called a stew but not gumbo.  It's offensive as a Gulf Coast native to see this called our beloved gumbo!  That aside, with some tweaking the seasoning, it's not a bad stew.

I had folks in for Mardi Gras and didn't have time to make traditional gumbo so I used this recipe, threw it in the crockpot and got rave reviews all weekend. No, it didn't have the smokey flavor of my hours-long version but it was delicious and made everyone happy!

Suggest less chicken broth. Was more like a soup than a gumbo. It did thicken with the rice, though. 
I added some file to provide thickening and flavor.

I made this and it was a very easy recipe.  I did not use green pepper but did add okra.  I used chicken breast meat and also added 8 oz of skinless turkey kielbasa.  I also browned the chicken and kielbasa and sauteed the onions and celery before putting it all in the slow cooker.
Everyone loved it and I will make this again.

This is my first attempt at gumbo. I omitted the celery (personal preference) and the cayenne (too much heat for me). I also added andouille sausage like some reviewers suggested. I wasn't a fan of the andouille, myself, but the rest was good. I've never eaten gumbo before so I don't have a basis for comparison. But my BF loved it, and he's a fan. I'll definitely make it again, with okra and smoked sausage instead of the andouille.

I  changed almost everything in this recipie. I usually don't cook gumbo in the crock pot but wanted to give it a try, but still staying true to my trusted gumbo recipie. 

I substituted fire roasted tomatoes for the stewed, just a personal preference. Omitted the cayenne and black peppers, but used a finely chopped jalapeño. Added okra. I probably had double the amount of veggies called for.  Cooked on low three to four hours. 

My chicken was cooked so I waited the three to four hours to add that. Also used andouille sausage. I cooked the veggies with the meat for three hours. I forgot the creole seasoning and shrimp! but the sausage and jalapano provided enough flavor. Overall good recipie, especially if you want to cook gumbo in a crockpot!

We really liked this, but next time I think I'll add sausage instead of the shrimp, just a personal preference. Followed the recipe with the exception of using chicken breasts instead of thighs. It had a lot of heat and good flavor, we served over Dirty Rice for even more kick! I will make this again!

This is Doug's favorite!  Made it with the Simple Cajun Spice recipe but half the salt and cayenne pepper.  Made a roux to thicken.
