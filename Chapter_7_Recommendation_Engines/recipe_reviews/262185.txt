Really good flavor and the crispy skin makes it.  Would like to figure how to get a green veggie in there instead of just root veggies.

The honey and Sriracha sauce came together surprisingly well, my husband loved it. Not too spicy but lots of flavor with some heat to it. I doubled the glaze recipe and didn't even need the wine to cook the root vegetables.

My family loved this dish. Next time I make it I plan on doubling the amount of vegetables as they cooked down quite a bit. I took the advice of others and cut the vegetables pieces small. The vegetables cooked well. I will also serve with a side of rice. A great dinner!

My husband and son didn't care for this dish. I made it exactly as directed. I think it's too peppery. Make sure you cut the veggies in small enough chunks so they cook through. After cooking on the stove to brown the veggies, they were in the oven for an additional 40 minutes and still weren't cooked all the way through.  I was hoping this would be a hit with the family considering the reviews, but it was a flop in our house.

Very tasty.

I'm not seeing anyone else mention this problem, but when I add the chicken skin down to peanut oil at high heat, the skin will start to burn after 45sec.  So keep an eye on the chicken at this step as leaving it for 3-4min skin down may ruin it.

Excellent and easy dish! My husband swears it’s the best thing I’ve ever cooked. I doubled up the chicken so we have some for lunch tomorrow and I’m excited to have it on day two. Something about cooking the chicken in the oven on top of the vegetables makes it all taste so even and perfect. I switched the siracha sauce for a jalepeno hot sauce we like and it still was good. Also replaced the red wine with white, which we also liked. Will def make it again!

This was so very delicious!  It's a keeper!  I used grapeseed oil (it also adapts to high heat) and used only 1 heaping teaspoon of pepper but otherwise followed the recipe.  Oh, yes, one other exception---no turnips.  The honey sauce and the rub can be made ahead of time, so dinner would only take about 45 minutes if that was done.  Thank you so much, Willpio, for our very wonderful dinner!

The sauce is to die for!  I may double it next time just for dipping.  I did make a few changes but I think the original recipe still deserves 5 stars.   First I halved the black pepper as per other reviewers and glad I did, the flavor was just right.  I replaced the turnip with about a half a pound of Brussels sprouts because it's what we had on hand and we LOVE Brussels.  I didn't have red wine so used chicken stock instead.  I only put in about 1/2 cup but I think I will omit it entirely next time.  The juices from the chicken and the sauce made plenty of liquid for the veggies to cook in.  The cook time suggested in the recipe was perfect for me.  Will definitely make again!

I have now made this many times and it's a hit. So incredibly flavorful! The whole family loves it. Definitely works best with bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs.  I also start it in the cast iron pan and sear the meat to brown it, then finish on the BBQ, basting with the extra sauce. Fantastic!

I didn't add as much pepper as asked for, just did more than the usual few twists of the grinder. Also didn't add wine, but did add about a quarter to half cup of chicken broth (salt free). It may've been fine without that, but it turned out well with it. Very tasty, and compliments from others! 

Will make again for sure!

I rarely give reviews for the recipes I make although many are good. This recipe was exceptional to me with so much flavor and pleasing to the pallet. I used skinless boneless thighs and found the seasoning through the meat was phenomenal.  If you want to impress your guest's with a nice meal, I recommend this dish. Maybe slightly spicy for some pallets but full of flavor.

The crispy skin on the thighs was great. The combination of the honey and sriracha has a just the right amount of sweet heat. Looking forward to the leftovers. Love the root vegetables as well.

I really haven't made it four times - only once, and I made the following changes:

I subbed canola oil for peanut oil
I used orange blossom honey
I subbed 2 butternut squash, cubbed, for potatoes
I subbed scallions and leeks for the yellow onion
I subbed beet for turnip
I did not a garlic head
I did not use red wine
I added yellow, crook-neck squash and zucchini which gave me all the liquid I needed
I cooked it a lot longer than it calls for in this recipe to soften the butternut squash.
I added fresh herbs from the garden for the last several minutes of cooking.

I will make it again, but I will not use nearly the same amount of black pepper. I will use only half, 1 T., of what this recipe calls for.

I’m sorry; but, this was an awful cooking experience for me. The sauce boiled down rapidly into a sticky mess that I had a very difficult time getting off my nonstick cookware. The finished chicken was dry and way too spicy for even my husband.

This was delicious and fun meal to prepare!  Next time I think I would lighten up a bit on the Pepper and Cumin (just a smidge).  But other than that......the chicken was so tender and buttery!  We will definitely make this again!

I didn’t have turnips but everything else made exactly how the recipe was published. Yum. It was tasty, I could use more sriatcha for spice,  but I will make again and add to rotation in our home.

I made it the first time following recipe except doubled the sauce (used less butter and a bit less wine).  We loved it but then I had two left over thighs and made it again changing it up a bit:  less black pepper by 1/2, cut fewer potatoes, used one turnip, more carrots and a large onion.  I did not double sauce and used about 1/4 C avocado oil in lieu of butter, sweet chili sauce 1/3 C and about 1/4 C honey, no pepper in sauce and I didn't cook it on stove just mixed in a bowl and spooned on at same intervals.  I used about 1/2 C red wine.
Still delicious, thanks for a great tasty spicy yummy recipe.

This recipe is easy and really good. Wasn't sure what to do with the turnip so if you don't know, you peal it and then chop it for this recipe. This will go into my weekly rotation.

This is one of the best dishes I have made in a long time. I made it as written except I doubled the recipe and added extra red wine at the end. Beautiful, delicious, impressive one-dish meal. I will make this often!

After reading other reviews I did cut the veggies smaller, I used 3 carrots and 6 red potatoes.  I also only used about a teaspoon of pepper throughout the dish.  My family really liked it, I would double the sauce, it is good and I did not quite have enough to baste the chicken in it when I added the wine so I kept what I had left to finish it off with.

Excellent recipe! Not generally a fan of turnips but the rich robust flavour of this dish has made me a fan! The turnip is the star accommpanyment to the crispy chicken. Made just a few changes: added sliced cremini mushrooms and a little more red wine (to taste) to the spicy sauce and roasted chicken and veggies. Delish!!

I recently got a cast-iron skillet.  I'm really enjoying it and I was excited to try this recipe.  The only thing I did differently was to add 2 parsnips, which I recommend.  The rub on the chicken is excellent (the tablespoon of pepper scared me but I went with it) and the sauce is YUM!!!!  I cut the vegetables pretty small as others suggested.  I cooked them a little longer before putting them in the oven so they would be done.  Next time I will omit most of the peanut oil.  It just didn't need it.  I keep my skillet pretty well oiled so I think that and the fat from the chicken will be enough.  I will definitely make it again.   Thanks so much for sharing this fun recipe!

I’ve had this bookmarked for awhile and finally tried it yesterday. My daughter and I really enjoyed the flavours. I always use chicken breasts so the thighs were a nice change. I never leave the skin on chicken any more so that was a tasty treat. I had to cook the veggies about 25 minutes longer than the recipe called for and I had them cut into bite sized piece.

I loved this recipe. However instead if the russet potatoes I think it would be better with red roasted potatoes. So I will probably try those next time. Make sure you cut the veggies kinda small so they cook all the way. Here are my photos of the dinner I cooked.

The first impression of both my husband and I was delicious and I would have rated this a 4+ star.  For whatever reason neither one of us wanted to even think about eating it again.  Bizarre, I know.  I recommend this for everyone.  The problem is with us and not the recipe!

We really enjoyed this dish tonight. I used a beet, in lieu of turnip , it had the most beautiful color.  Will make again & I will be def. struggling with the decision to try the turnip or use the beet again.   Regrettably didn't take a photo.
