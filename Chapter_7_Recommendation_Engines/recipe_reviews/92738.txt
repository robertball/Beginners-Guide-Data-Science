Not bad, a nice departure from the usual dessert.  But, for the hoopla involved, I'd rather have plain ol' watermelon.  I'm also not a huge fan of sesame seeds.  Everyone who tried it said it was pretty good, but preferred the slices of fresh melon for dessert.

very different but extremely nice pudding. Good with cream or on its own. All our dinner quests enjoyed it.

I'm not sure what this is supposed to taste like, but it had a rubbery texture and wasn't flavorful.  I would not make this again.

Unique and delicious. It is more like a chewy dense cake, so if you are thinking "pie" you will be disappointed. Also, it doesn't taste much like watermelon-it's just sweet, cakey and good. Coat the bottom of your pie plate with olive oil before you put the seeds down and it will come out perfectly.

I love this recipe, and it always helps me use all of my watermelon before it goes bad. Coupled w/ the sesame seeds, its great.

This pie was really good.  Not knock-your-socks-off awesome... but really good. I always enjoy trying new things and this was "something completely different." I made it for my family of 8 and everyone liked it a lot.  I would make it again.  The sesame seeds add a surprising amount of flavor. I would never have thought to put these ingredients together, but it works.  I served it topped with whipped cream. One tip for the sesame seeds... I greased my pie plate with pan spray.  When I added the sesame seeds I turned and tapped the plate like you would to flour a pan all over the bottom and rim.  It gave me a great even sesame seed "shell" to pour the filling into.

Very interesting texture! Awesome if you have too much watermelon or leftover watermelon that no one wants to eat. Tasted kind of like pumpkin pie and I liked that it was virtually fat free. I used almond slivers instead of sesame seeds on the bottom and added a tsp of vanilla for more flavour.
