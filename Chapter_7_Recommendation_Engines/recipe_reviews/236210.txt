Added some very ripe raspberries to the cream cheese filling and baked for 15 minutes.  Not sure exactly why the roll-ups need to be frozen (maybe keeps the filling from oozing out?), but I froze them overnight.  Must say it was nice this morning just to pull them out of the freezer and into the oven.  These rolls are just crisp enough that you can hold them and eat, no fork necessary.   They’re not overly sweet, and although I ate them hot, I think they’d be equally good at room temperature or even chilled.  They'd be a terrific addition to a brunch buffet.  Thanks jessnay for a quick and tasty breakfast today!

I didn't roll my in cinnamon-sugar but instead in a typical French Toast mixture (eggs, milk, cinnamon, and vanilla). Then right to a fry pan in butter. You can almost top them with anything. I had powder sugar, maple and chocolate syrup, and honey.

Very nice and easy brunch option.  My guests LOVED it.  I will definitely make it again and double the recipie amount.  The only change that I will make is to decrease the amount of sugar in the cream cheese spread.......just a little  sweet for my taste buds.
