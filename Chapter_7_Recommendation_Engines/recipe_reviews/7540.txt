This is a good, simple cake to have with coffee.  To glaze it neatly, I used a tip I got from elsewhere on this site.  Make the glaze while the cake is cooling slightly on a rack.  Prick the cake all over with a skewer or icepick.  Then, pour part of the hot glaze into the pan, put the cake back into the pan, and pour the rest of the glaze on top.  Leave the cake in the pan to cool and to absorb the glaze, then invert onto a plate to serve.

This was fabulous!  It's very light.  I followed the recipe exactly, with a few minor variations: used butter instead of shortening, and increased "cake" cinnamon to 1 TB and "topping" cinnamon to 1 1/2 tsp.  I also sifted the dry ingredients before incorporating.  It was done baking in 39 minutes, and not dry at all.  I will make this again.  Next time I will probably poke larger holes for the sauce to soak into the cake.

I followed others' advice and upped the cinnamon in the cake batter to 1 Tablespoon, and used butter instead of shortening.  For the sauce/glaze, I used brown sugar instead of white and 2 teaspoons of cinnamon.  The family raved!  Thanks!

I wanted something different for breakfast so I tried this cake. Great day! It's fabulous! We added 2 tablespoons of oil, made sure we beat it extra long till the batter was light and fluffy and folded in 1 cup of butterscotch chips. When it was done I let the syrup cool along with the cake, poked holes in top and sides with a chopstick and spooned in the syrup. Its like a big cinnamon roll!!
Awesome!! I will surely make this one again and again!  5+ stars! 
Thank you Leta!

This is a great recipe. I made it for Christmas breakfast this year and my family ate the whole thing. The cake itself is kind of plain - just a light butter cake. The cinnamon syrup is what makes it really tasty and unique. My only word of caution - the syrup pools around the bottom of the cake. I don't think it would keep well. If you are not planning to serve a group and finish the whole cake at once, you may want to just spoon the syrup over each slice, instead of pouring it over the whole cake at once.

Very good, would be great for a brunch buffet.  The syrup came out too watery for me, maybe I did something wrong.. I improvised by mixing up a batch of white icing, which I poured over the cake.  If you like your cakes with lots of taste, as opposed to mild and buttery, then you'll want to add more spices to the batter.  Overall, a very good homemade yellow cake.

This wasn't particularly amazing, but it's very difficult to find recipes that are. The cake turned out perfectly fine. It was moist, but held together well. I had hoped the icing would be more like a glaze, and not as runny, but that may be due to my lessening the butter in the icing to 3 tbsp. I also altered the actual recipe since I don't like my cakes really sweet and I thought the amount of butter originally called for seemed to be a bit too much for this amount of cake. I changed the recipe from 2/3cup butter to 1/2cup (or 1 stick) butter and from 1 1/3cup sugar to 3/4cup sugar. The cake still turned out great according to my tastes, and I'll continue to use this recipe for a breakfast cake to go along with  my morning coffee.

My 1 1/2 year old son loved this recipe.  FRiends of ours ate about half of it as well.  I made it in a regular cake pan, as I didn't have a bundt pan.  I just left it in the pan and poured the syrup over it.  NExt time I might try putting part of the batter in and then some apple pie filling, and then the rest of the batter.  It was definitely a hit and I will be making it more often!  thanks for a great recipe!!!

Wow, this is tasty.  I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1/3 cup of brown sugar, I used 1/3 cup of milk and 1/3 cup of applesauce, I upped the cinnamon to 1 tbsp, I used 1/2 tsp of salt, and I used butter instead of shortening.  I did not glaze it and it was delicious as it was as we don't like things too sugary, but I'm sure a glaze would have made it even better for most people.   I only needed to bake this for 35 mins.   This is a keeper.

I followed the reviews and added on heaping tablespoon of cinnamon to the cake and 1.5 t to the sauce (plus milk instead of water) and it did not lack flavor at all!  The cake wasn't too crumbly at all and for those saying it came out dry, either decrease the cooking time or add a spoonful of mayo (yes mayo!) to the batter before baking...it really helps!

Very delicious and easy to make cake. Great for any occasion. I put 1/4 shortening and 1/2 butter. I also sprinkled top of cake with cinnamon sugar. My mouth is watering thinking about it!

As many reviewers suggested, I used butter instead of shortening and also added extra cinnamon. I also tried using milk instead of water in the sauce, but it was still way too watery so I dumped that batch and tried it again with just the sugar, butter, vanilla, and cinnamon (again, I went heavy on the cinnamon). Served warm with ice cream, it was really good -- not dry at all. I will most likely make this again.

This is a nice one-shot dessert. One-shot being that I felt it was tastiest served fresh with the sauce straight off the stove top. Otherwise the cake itself was on the dry side - not that this is necessarily a bad thing, as the dryness works well with the sauce - and wasn't quite as enjoyable the second time around.   I will definitely make it again, but will reserve its preparation for times when enough people will be on hand to enjoy it fresh.

I made this cake from an AR cookbook so I didn't have the benefit of reviews.  I replaced the shortening with butter and used a 9" bundt pan because I don't have a 10" pan.  I baked it for 45 minutes and it was done.  I will probably make this again, taking the suggestions of more cinnamon in both the batter and the glaze and using brown sugar in place of white.  I think I would also make a simple syrup then add the butter so the glaze isn't so runny.  We did like the fact it was not overly sweet.  Thanks, Leta.

I made this last night and served it warm to a group of friends. It was well received, and one of the ladies said she didn't care much for cinnamon- and this was the perfect amount. I'm not giving it 5 starts simply because I feel that it needs MORE cinnamon. I could barely taste it. I'm not quite sure if I'll make it again - but if I do I'll definitely increase the cinnamon. Also - don't forget to flour the pan (like I did) otherwise the cake won't come out in one piece!

Cake was very dense, should have read reviews and added more cinnamon, recipe a little light on cinnamon for a cinnamon cake. ,The cake  did not rise very much and was on the dry side, the glaze helped.  Also the glaze would have been better if it was all melted butter and no water.

Absolutely yummy cake!  I made it in a loaf pan, instead of the bundt pan and the cake rose beautifully.  Very moist.

This cake recipe is so so.  I made it for friends (we ate dessert at my house after dining at the Olive Garden).  This is a nice "after dinner" dessert, especially following an Italian meal (it's not too rich).  The only problem I had was removing the cake from the bundt pan without destroying it (I need to work on that - LOL).  I found it difficult to drizzle the cake with the syrup mixture without making a mess (I inverted the cake onto the serving plate so that I wouldn't have to move it from the wire rack, but now see why you drizzle the cake over a wire rack first...).  I used the end of a small wooden spoon to poke holes into the cake (not all the way through).  Small fork pricks would not be deep enough to allow the syrup to seep down into the cake (at least I don't think so).  Does that make any sense?  I think this cake would be good with a nice powdered sugar glaze poured over the top.  It goes great with coffee!  Thanks for sharing.  My friends enjoyed it more than I did.

i made this cake last weekend and it was quite tasty.  modifications consisted of halving the amount of baking powder, adding more cinnamon to the batter, another half teaspoon of cinnamon to the syrup, and about 3/4 tablespoon of cornstarch also to the syrup (it went on beautifully when thicker).  the only minor gripe, which prevented five stars, was that the finished product, althogh a keeper for sure, was just a tad dry.  i'll make this again and try to figure out how to moisten it up.

Very good cake! So yummy, and moist. The secret is to make the holes in the cake larger so most of the syrup is poured into the cake. Definately recommend it!

I agree this is the best Cinnamon Cake I have ever made! Mine was not too dry or moist but just perfect.  This is also the tastiest cinnamon cake and the buttery topping so delicious. Great as cupcakes too. Try it!

The cake was kind of dry but I didn't like the glaze it was too watery. Overall I think it needs more flavor and a thicker glaze that will stick to the cake not leave a puddle of a mess.

I made this cake for a breakfast at work today.  It has been a hit and I have already handed out the recipe to severql people.  I did change the baking powder to 1-1/2 tsp and used cinnamon sugar in the pan.  I also used my carving fork with bigger tines to poke holes in the cake and it worked out very well and I didn't seem to have as much glaze left over as others mentioned earlier.  I will put this recipe in my favorites box!  Thank you.

YUMMY!  I took advice from a lot of reviews on using butter instead of Crisco and extra cinnamon. I also used milk instead of water for the syrup. I like the syrup so much too that Im thinking of what other recipe I can use it on!  As I type my fiance' is on his third slice!!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This cake is wonderful.  I did make a couple of small changes. Instead of 1 1/3 cups of white sugar, we used 1 cup white and 1/3 cup dark brown. I used butter in the cake instead of shortening because I can't have shortening. We doubled the amount of cinnamon.   In the glaze, I added a couple of tablespoons of maple syrup to give it some depth and I used dark brown sugar instead of white.

Fabulous!  Instead of shortening, I used equal amount of applesauce.  I was in the mood for something with cinnamon and this definitely fit the bill.  I added a little more cinnamon to both the cake and the icing.

I just baked this for my mother's birthday and it was so delicious, it was hard to wait for her to arrive. I honestly could have eaten the whole thing myself. I also used butter instead of shortening and upped to 1 tablespoon of cinnamon in the cake. This recipe is a definite keeper.

I enjoyed this cake immensely, but I did change the shortening to butter.  I do agree that it could use more cinnamon hence the 4 stars instead of 5.

Not sure how to rate this because I think it would have been a wonderful cake but WOW -- so much salt!  I used the 3/4 teaspoon listed in the recipe and the salty taste was so strong in the resulting cake, I had to brush my teeth to get the taste out of my mouth.  I will try this cake again someday without the salt.

I have made this cake twice now and it is wonderful.  I like this cake because it is light with a subtle cinnamon flavor.  The syrup is really what makes the cake.  What I want to try is to add a little rum to the syrup . . .

This cake was awful.  We only ate maybe 1 and 1/2 pieces from it. Too dry, crumbly...and very bland! The glaze was too runny and not at all impressive. Will not make again.

Incorporating other reviews, I used butter flavor shortening and added extra cinnamon to the cake batter.  Also used less water for the sauce topping, but it still came out a little watery (maybe too much butter?).  The cake itself is good, but as others have said, a little dry.  Don't know how to fix that.  My husband said he ate this because he was hungry, not because he especially liked it.

Not bad, especially served with butterscotch ripple ice cream (mmmm!).  I've never tried a butter cake, but I found this cake a lot drier than I expected a butter cake to be!  I substituted margarine for shortening - perhaps that was my problem?  I added 1/4 cup of oil and 1 cup butterscotch chips, and this helped the moisture content a bit.  I can't imagine how dry it would have been without it! - I will likely add 1/2 cup of applesauce next time, instead of the 1/4 cup oil.  Also, I followed one of the reviewer's suggestions to remove the cake from the pan, pour in half the cinnamon sauce, and let the cake soak in it, in addition to poking the top and pouring it over.  That was yummy, too. With all these changes and additions, the cake was pretty good.  I will make this cake again, but likely not for a while.

I have never had any luck with completely scratch cakes until now.  Spectacular results, although next time I will spoon the sauce onto the slices as they are cut.  Even my "been cooking for 65 yrs." g'ma was utterly impressed.  Thanks.

I baked it in the oven for 45mins. The crust was rather hard but cake inside was good. Overall, its a very nice cake,..just a little too sweet. Cut down on the sugar and it'll be just right.

I've made this cake about 7 times since I first saw the recipe at Christmas 1999. 
It's a great cake, and everyone loves it - but I've made two changes since the first time I made it.

First, the recipe calls for too much baking powder. This causes the cake to rise dramatically and 
then fall in the middle as it cools. Still tastes good, but I think it makes the cake crumbly after a day or so.
I reduced the baking powder to 1 teaspoon. Second, I reduced the amount of syrup by half.

Anyway, it's a terrific cake!

This was my first time I had ever made a bundt cake. I followed the recipe exactly, even the cool-time to flip the pan so the cake would come out. That part failed. Less than half broke off and came out, the rest stubbornly stayed in the pan. So I remade the next day, only changing two things, I  greased my pan THOROUGHLY, right before adding the batter. Then, instead of flouring the pan, I used 3/4 cup sugar and 1 TBS of cinnamon (mixed together) to sugar my pan. Cake came right out, no sticking.  I love this recipe, I didn't have adjust for high-altitude either.

My husband Samuel is a cake connoisseur and he absolutely loved this cake!  I used butter flavor shortening instead of regular which gave it an extra buttery, Southern, down home taste

Lovely recipe, but like others, I had to up the cinnamon in this recipe.  I also added diced crystallized ginger, which is always a hit in a spice or cinnamon cake.  Serving it with cinnamon cream cheese frosting made it so everyone was coming back for seconds!

The cake turned out really moist for me and the syrup was excellent. I also tweaked the recipe but it was already a great recipe to start with. I like alot of flavor so I also added 2TBS to the batter and used dark brown sugar instead of light or white. I beat the batter extremely well each time an ingredient was added and until it was smooth as a babys bottom. I also sifted all my ingredients together. With the syrup which turned out excellent, I added 2 teaspoons cinnamon.I only substitued the white sugar with dark brown and brought to a boil then turned it down to a simmer and whisked it for about 5 to 7 minutes and it turned into a beautiful dark brown thick glaze. It was delicious just make sure you flour your pan well and give it time to cool in the pan.

I added the extra heaping tablespoon of cinnamon and used milk instead of water.  The cake had a delicious flavor.  It is at its finest while warm.  My only complaint is that I did find the texture a bit grainy both times I have made it.  Other than the texture issue, this is a good recipe to have on hand.  I will make it again and try to figure out the texture quandry.

I got rave reviews about this cake. It was really good. It was kind of crumbly. I think that is due to the shortening. I think I might try this with all butter next time. After I poked holes in the cake with a skewer and poured the syrup in I topped it with chopped almonds. It was sooooo gooooood! Thank you!!!

This cake's texture is perfect. I did a weird variation on it (I made it a cinnamon cumin cake), but the basics of the cake were unchanged and I was really satisfied. It was a huge hit with my friends! :)

I thought this was fantastic, but I had to change a few things - it was so thick that I added an extra cup of milk (and the final product was still very dense!), used butter instead of shortening, and did not add any water to the glaze, which made it much thicker, it looked great - like butterscotch.  I also added an extra tablespoon of cinnamon to the cake as suggested by some other

This cake recipe turned out awful!  The cake was so crumbly that I could not take it off the wire rack without if falling to pieces!  It was so dry and bland, what a waste of my ingredients!  Usually every recipe I try on this website turn out wonderful.  
Don't make this cake!

Cake was dry due to my own fault of baking it too long but the flavor was excellent.  It is important to pour the cinnamon syrup over the cake while it's still warm, otherwise it doesn't soak in.  Will make again!

I used oil instead of shortening and the cake turned out very moist and light.  Cooked in about 35 min.  The cake itself is a bit bland, even though I increased the amount of cinnamon and vanilla.  The flavour actually gets better when the cake cools.  Use very big holes for the topping - fork pricks are too small.  Or possibly cut the cake in half and pour it over the middle.
I took this cake to work and had people asking for the recipe - it was very popular!

I was not too fond of this cake. It was a little too dry for me. I followed the recipe just like it said but the cinnamon syrup that you pour on top and sides is really messy. By the reviews it seems like a lot of people liked it but it just wasn't my taste.

This was superb.When i first made it I topped it with the sugar syrup which was ok.The next time i made it i did'nt use it,instead i sprinkled icing sugar on top,every body liked it.the third time when i made it what i did was that i poured  more than half batter in the pan and added cocoa powder to the remaining batter then added it in the pan.It was a great hit.Every body loved it.Yes i also greased my pan generously with margarine.It came out perfectly.thanks for the recipe.

Delicious... . I did some changing to the cake. I didnt use the syrup. substituted the shortening with butter. Added 2-1/4 teaspons of cinnamon to the batter, there were some that said the cinnamon taste was really faint. I cut back on the sugar to 1-1/4 cup. Also added 1/4 cup of oil, and 1/3 cup of milk to the batter (since there were some who said that it came out dry). Instead of baking it with a Bundt pan, I used a muffin pan. Baked them at 350 degrees for 15 minutes. It came out soft and fluffy...kind of moist too. The cake came out a bit greasy though. Next time i would add apple sauce, instead of oil. I love it! Definate repeat.

I love this cake.  It came out of the pan  very easy.  The only thing I will change the next time I make it is the glaze.  I think it would be better with a creamy glaze made with a few tablespoons of milk, powder sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla extract instead of the syrup.

The cake itself was fine..not great..but fine...i would suggest greasing your pan A LOT...i tried to get my cake out...and half came out and half didn't...it was not pretty... I would also suggest that instead of using shortening for a "butter" cake...u actually use butter...that was another mistake of mine...also use a different glaze unless u want to be on a sugar high for days on end..my sister thought it was too sweet, which I thought she would never say that until pigs flew.

We loved this cake it was really tasty and looked pretty out of our heart bundt pan. We didn't make the sauce and thought it was great without it, also we substituted buttermilk for the milk.

This was a good basic recipe, with ingredients on hand. I would add more cinnamon next time, bigger and deeper holes in the cake, to soak up the sauce.  Maybe even a confec. sugar glaze, to dress it up.

Could tell it had potential. Why on earth you'd make with shortening and not butter is beyond me.  So next time I'll make that substitution.  I must have cooked a little too hot or too long or the recipe isn't exactly right...cake turned out dry.  Could have used more cinammon, I thought...I doubled the amount and would have liked a still stronger cinammon flavor.  In recipe's defense, when cake came out really dry, I didn't bother to put the butter/cinammon sauce on it, since cake was already kinda trashed.  Hoping that next time, I'll do better.  I also used a cathedral bundt pan, and the cake really didn't want to come out of there.  I'll do a better job of greasing pan next time.

I also found this cake crumbly, but we enjoyed it anyhow.  I left out most of the water in the glaze to make it thicker and that helped.  I added extra cinnamon to the cake itself, but still found the flavor less rich than a sour cream coffee cake.

Yummy cake, nice cinammon-y flavour, but I think the drizzling sauce could be a bit thicker.

so nummy! I had nothing to do so I decided to make this cake, and as luck would have it my mothers friends came over right when  the cake was still steamy, they loved it! I was so proud. It does have alot of calories though so I probably wont make it again for a while.

This cake was okay I expected the taste to be more sweet! More moist not as dry, it didn't last very well. I wanted something a lil more buttery /more cinnamon flavor. I tasted very lil cinnamon in the cake, I did taste the flour!I may try it again but definitely with another icing, the syrup didn't satisfy me, Thanks anyway

This cake was good, but not great.  We liked the cinnamon and loved the topping...but overall thought that the cake was pretty dry.  

Although, baking it made the house smell SO yummy...recommend baking this cake if you're trying to sell your house!

The only problem I had with this recipe was getting the cake out of the pan.  Even broken, it didn't take away from the flavor.  This was a hit!  I'd recommend using a spring form pan to prevent the cake from crumbling when you remove it.  Ohh man, cinnamon cake and coffee.  This was wonderful!

I thought this was a terrible recipe.  The cake was dry and very crumbly.  The glaze was deffinately too watery.  I even substituted the water in the glaze for milk.  It was so watery that it just soaked the outside of the cake and there was a puddle of liquid at the bottom of the pan.  I will never make it again.

This cake was super rich and sweet, which is great depending on sweet your tooth is.  It was especially great while still warm, but mine broke because I removed it from the bundt pan while it was still quite warm.

It was pretty good.  Next time I will only make half as much glaze - there was way too much and much of it went to waist.  I will also take the advice to put some butter/cinnamon/sugar in the pan for a nice "crust" - that would be good!  I'm wondering if instead of making it in a bundt pan, making it in a regular pan (although I'm not sure what size would be best...9x13?  9x9?), then poking the holes and pouring the syrup over the top.  It would have a better chance of soaking in, I would think, and so much of the syrup wouldn't go to waist.  :p

This cake is to die for. When it's still warm from the oven you could almost eat half the cake in one sitting! The only change I made to the recipe was I used 2/3 c of olive oil instead of shortening. I also decreased the sugar by about 1/4 c and I used water instead of milk since we had run out! Even so, it was amazing - my whole family loved it.

I made this exactly as the original recipe said with no substitutions. Personally I thought it was okay for the amount of ingredients required. I definitely like the buttery flavor of the drizzled cinnamon and butter.  But, I thought the cake was very crummy probably from being in the oven 5 minutes too long which dried it out. I think I will try it again, but this time I will reduce the cooking time by testing it sooner, reduce the amount of baking powder, replace shortening with vegetable oil or butter, and add a bit more cinnamon to the batter.  We'll see how that works.

My husband loved the cake. I would use a two-tine meat fork instead of a regular to allow more of the syrup to soak into the cake.  I liked that I had all the ingredients in my cupboard, so that I could make it on the spur of the moment.

Would definitely make again. Delicious cake. I also used brown sugar in the syrup and a little extra cinnamon in both the cake and syrup but I'm sure it's great just as written - I just happen to prefer brown sugar and more cinnamon.

This cake is delicious! I added more cinnamon and used butter instead of shortening. I initially tried to pour the glaze on while the cake was still in the pan and let it seep through, but either I didn’t have enough glaze or I didn’t give it enough time because the top of the cake was a little dry once I had turned it out of the pan. I made a little more glaze and poured it over the top and then it was perfect.

I used 1tbsp of vanilla extract and cinnamon. 
For the glaze I added a little bourbon.

Very good, although a bit sweet. I did use less sugar, and substituted butter for the shortening. 
I may use more cinnamon in the cake the next time I make it.
Tip: I sprinkled some walnuts on the bottom of the bundt pan before I poured in the batter. Very good!

I saw this recipe in the Feb/Mar 2018 Allrecipes Magazine. It suggested using the bottled syrup instead of the last 5 ingredients. Since I had just received a bottle of Torani Cinnamon Syrup, I used it. Very good. After tasting it, I realized this is the kind of cake I prefer to add nuts to, like banana bread. It will go great with a cup of coffee. I also believe it will get more moist and flavorful each day as it sits and soaks up all the cinnamon syrup.

This was delicious, made as shown, no changes.  Actually, my husdand made it  (his first even cake).  As there were only the two of us, next time I might follow Caroline's suggestion of serving each piece and then pouring the syrup over it as it is eaten.

Okay, I cheated on this, but I was short on time and wanted to make the cake.  I used a Duncan Hines yellow cake mix, made it according to directions but added about 3/4 t. cinnamon to the batter.  After baking I poured the glaze over the cake - it was amazing!  I don't like things that are too sweet and this was perfect.

2/27/18: Very good cake! I followed other reviewers suggestions and increased the cinnamon in both the cake and glaze (1 tablespoon and 1 1/2 teaspoons respectively) and substituted milk for water.  The glaze is watery, so pour it into the pan (after removing the cake and poking holes in it--I used a kabob stick) and put the cake back in (as suggested by another reviewer). The result has a strong cinnamon flavor I love.
4/6/18: I replaced the shortening with butter (2/3 cup is 10 Tbs + 2 tsps). Also, I used brown sugar instead of white and my glaze was thicker. Baked 40 minutes.

As published in their magazine, Allrecipes substitutes store-bought cinnamon syrup for the topping in this recipe.  I don't think I'd make that change since the topping here probably has better texture and is cheaper.  Likewise, some reviewers spoke about how good the cake was hot, I liked it better the second or third day after the topping has set and the flavors melded.  I would cut half, or so, of the sugar called for in the recipe for the cake itself out and substitute a less refined sugar for all, or most, of the sugar in both the cake and topping recipes.  Butter is better than shortening too.

So buttery and yummy! I took someone else’s advice and put half the cinnamon sauce into the bundt pan and put the cake back in to absorb it and it worked out perfectly! I will be making this one again.

This cake had a great taste, but it was a little dry. As soon as I took it out go the pan, it fell apart. It still tasted great. But the glaze did not work out as well as I thought it would. The butter did not mix well with the rest of the glaze ingredients.

This was a great cake. I made it as is except I added 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil and for the topping I did 1/3 white sugar and 2/3 brown. 

The cake was super moist and so delicious with coffee.  I have half away to keep from eating it all. 

Will make again

I really loved the flavor of this cake, especially with the cinnamon syrup.   I plan on making the cinnamon syrup as an ice cream topping!    It was a bit dry for my tastes but overall a very easy cake to make with ingredients most would have already.

I saw that the reviews had said it was dry, so I made modifications to make it a bit more moist. (added an extra egg yolk, added some vegetable oil.) Even then, it was dry. It needs something creamy in it, like perhaps sour cream, pudding, or heavy whipping cream instead of milk.  All in all, this is great served warm with some coffee and I generally enjoyed it.

It was delicious. I used butter because I didn't have shortening and I only used 1 1/2 tsp baking powder 1 Tbls cinnamon in cake and 2 tsps cinnamon in the sauce. I drizzled glaze on it to make it taste like a cinnamon roll. My husband really loved it.

I made this cake exactly as directed. I did not however make the glaze for the top. While the cake was very good it was a bit dry. I suspect that is because you really need to use the glaze on this cake. I probably won't make it again.

I cut the cake recipe in half but kept the amount of glaze as-is. It's a lovely, simple cake. I've made it as travel snacks, so I'm hoping it'll stay moist and tasty until my fiancee and I fly the day after tomorrow. Of course, he might eat it first...

So easy to make it :) and the ingredients are simple - I didn't even have to go to a shop, as I had everything already. I used butter instead of shortening - same amount - and let me tell you this cake was delicious! :)

I chose this recipe to try to get rid of some Cinnamon Vanilla coffee creamer that I didn't like as coffee creamer.  I used the creamer in place of the milk in the recipe, and also in place of the water for the glaze!  This cake was SO light and moist, the glaze was delicious.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!!

Excellent recipe but I would suggest adding more cinnamon. I did so and it tasted super good, 1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon is too little.

I really liked the syrup, but not the cake.  I didn't think the cake had much flavor, and it had an almost greasy texture.  I made the syrup without the water based on some other reviews, and it was delicious.  I am going to try it on some other type of cake.

I LOVED this recipe! It was so light and heavenly. My family couldn't get enough! Not only did it taste devine, but the smell from cooking it is out of this world! Thank you for sharing!

I made this cake two days ago and was good? But not the kind of cake i was looking for. I think it was more like a bread than a cake maybe my mistake or a cake gone wrong.

I had such high expectations for this cake.  It didn't taste as well as I thought it would.  I did substitute the butter for the shortening and added 1 tbsp of cinnamon and even added 1 tbsp of vegetable oil to avoid the "dryness" everybody had been talking about but unfortunately, it still came out a tad bit too dry for my liking.  I also thickened the sauce by omitting the water completely and adding about 1 tbsp of corn syrup.  I did not let it soak through the cake; instead, I drizzled it on top of the cake.  I'll probably not make this again and will just stick to the Yogurt Spiced Pound Cake (also from this site) for a moister cake.

I even followed the suggestions to try to get this moist, but it didn't work.  To start, I used a full stick of butter, instead of shortening.  Cut the sugar to 3/4 cup, used buttermilk, and even dropped in some oil... Nope, it was dry and fall'y apart'y.  The glaze, I decided to skip ALL the water, to keep it thick. It's good 'n' sweet that way, but gritty and there's not nearly enough.  If I didn't make my version of the glaze, this would be in the trash, but since I did - we'll eat the crusty, glazed outer edge and chuck the rest.

I personally didn't have all the ingredients at home so i altered the recipe  a little bit. this is what i did:
-no vanilla extract 
-instead of 2/3 cup shortening i put in 18  table spoons of butter (which is actually healthier believe it or not)  
-instead of milk i put in 1/2 a cup of half and half.
this might sound a bit unhealthy but it was soooooooooooooo delicious!!!!!!! 
and i'm sure that the original is just as good!!! if you want to try this recipe out (my version) then follow the original directions! 
enjoy!

The cake tasted absolutely wonderful, but I found that it took me twenty extra minutes to cook the cake than you suggested. I used a silicon bundt pan, so maybe the metal cooks faster. But, no matter what, the cake was great!

wow...this was a great cake!!! i've never had sooo many compliments for my cakes before. i made it twice in 2 days, it was just THAT good. the funny thing is that i'm not even that crazy about cinnamon. but the only thing that wasn't perfect, was that i didn't think it tastes that good cold...only when it was still warm. so you should serve it right away.

When I read buttery, I was expecting a real moist cake.  It was not crumbly dry like some had stated but it was on the drier side.  I did not bake as long as stated hoping that would help but it was not to be.  It did look pretty and smelled good but did not have a lot of taste.

this was a real good coffee cake, i tripled the amount of cinnamon and added a teaspon of ground up instant coffee. I also didnt use the syrup, and instead used a glaze that was recommended.

i don't have a bundt pan, so i just used a rectangle glass pan and didn't worry about taking it out of the pan. drizzled the sauce all over it and it was so good. very satisfing, a bit too buttery for the sauce perhaps, but still good!

I'm a bit disappointed. I see that many other reviews have the same thoughts as I do concerning this recipe.  A bit dry and slightly bland--it doesn't look too appealling either, kind of pale and unappetizing. I used butter and I doubt using butter was the reason for dryness. The cake fell apart when I tried to take it out of bundt pan. I will however try it again with a few changes.  More cinnamon in batter, maybe sourcream to moisten it, and a thicker glaze perhaps.  The kids didn't mind the soggy mess. Good with a tall glass of cold milk.

We really enjoyed this cake.  I did hold back a star, however, because I will have to make some changes before we LOVE this cake.  The only change I made this time was to use shortening instead of butter...come on, the recipe is called "buttery"...so where's the butter?  Having watered-down butter in the syrup does not a buttery-cake make!  
The next time I make it, I will put more cinnamon in the cake so that I can omit the cinnamon syrup.  It was a little too sweet and a little grainy.  We really didn't like that part of the cake.  Other than that, it was great!

It was a good cake, not the best I have ever made, but we did enjoy it. I poked holes into the cake with the end of a chopstick instead of a fork. That helped with the syrup. Maybe it was just to heavy of a cake for me. Im not sure. Thanks for sharing.

I made this recipe and it came out great!!  My wife does all the baking and I found this recipe here and decided to make it.  The only recommendation is that you poke the fork in deeply so that the syrup will soak in all the way.  Served warm with ice cream and everyone loved it.

This cake was fairly simple to make and tasted very good, but the mix for the top was very messy and sticky. I guess wait a long time before pouring it over the cake.

This cake is so delicious because of the butter sauce you put on the cake.

I made this cake for Valentine's Day because my husband loves cinnamon.  It turned out great.  I only drizzled some of the syrup over the cake.  The rest I drizzled over each slice as served.  The cake actually kept well.  It lasted in our house for almost a week, and I just warmed it in the microwave and reheated the extra syrup to drizzle over the slices each time.  I would definitely make it again, as it was very simple to make.  I may try it with applesauce the next time, as recommended by other reviewers.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This cake was easy to make. When heating the sauce, I heated it up too much, so the sauce collected at the bottom of the cake-dish. I had to wait until it cooled down before pouring it over the cake again. You would think the cake would become mushy from the sauce, but it didn't. Nice, smooth flavor. I would bake it again.

This is a good cake, but a little on the dry side...next time I might add some applesauce to the batter or a few teaspoons of oil to make it a little more moist.  But, the taste was really good!  It made my house smell wonderful!! !

Sorry to be one of the few to go against the majority, but there was nothing special about it. Dry and boring. Will not make this again, although my father in law seemed to like it. Needs something...apples, maybe? Like another reviewer said, the bread seems to be missing something. Sorry! :(

I had so many compliments with this cake. :)  It was really moist and the sugar/cinnamon top coating was yummy. :)  I tried cutting the glaze in half and found out that I didn't have enough to coat my cake.  Maybe next time I'll alter the icing to 2/3 or 3/4.  I had no problem using a springform pan (except that I had to bake it for an extra 10 minutes).  One thing that I might try doing next time is put a cinnamon swirl inside the cake or make individual cupcakes.

I made this for a coffee & cake afternoon and it was a big hit!  Very easy and made with ingredients you usually have around the house anyway.  Took one user's advice and used brown sugar instead of white sugar for the cinnamon syrup and I have to say it came out VERY good!

I can't stop eating this cake!  It is delicious. Since I have had some terrible luck with high rated cake recipes lately, I scaled this down to 4 servings.  What a great feature allrecipes offers!  I have mini bundt pans and it made 8 mini cakes.

Wonderful!  I took this to work the second time I made it and it was gone in about an hour.  My only suggestion is grease the pan VERY well, the first time I made it the top half stayed in the pan but it still tasted good.

Made the recipe exactly as it is written.
Everyone complimented me for this cake at a party.  However, it really is better the same day than day 2.
The sauce is my favorite part.

This was the first cake I have ever made. It was not that difficult. Very moist and exceptionally good. I used a splash of almond extract to give it a bit of kick. Note: It was only good covered for two days, after that it was very crumbly and not nearly as tasty.

It is just a little bit too sweet,
but nice butter and cinnamon taste.
For Germans: I used a few drops of 
Butter-Vanille-Aroma.

This cake was very tasty, although it was somewhat crumbly once served.
A great make-ahead.

I've brought this to work twice and had an empty plate within a few moments.  Especially good on a cold winter morning.

I really liked this cake, and it certainly passed muster with my family.  It would be great to take to a potluck or picnic.
