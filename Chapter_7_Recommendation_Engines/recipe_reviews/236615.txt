This is a yummy recipe.  I halved it and then made two balls, putting onions in one and not the other.  The change I made was to use real bacon, almost six strips of Safeway's thick sliced.  I covered them differently so that the non-onion eater among us could distinguish hers.  We thought these were very yummy, though the one with the onions definitely had more flavor.  I would definitely make this recipe again!  Thanks, marion!

I have made this recipe several times and it always goes over well.  Unless you are having a large party, just make half the recipe.  I make it a day ahead or the morning of the event and then roll it in pecans or dried parsley closer to the time I put it out.  Can't go wrong with this one if you like bacon and bleu cheese.

Made this for a Super Bowl day of gluttony. Super easy to prepare and got thumbs up from girlfriend who doesn't like bleu cheese. I'll definitely be doing this again.

This a great crowd pleaser. I did change a couple of things though. I used lite cream cheese and fat fee feta instead of the blue cheese crumbles. Not all of our family likes blue cheese and they never knew it had any in it. I also added red pepper flakes for a little more flavor and just a little bite. Fabulous!
