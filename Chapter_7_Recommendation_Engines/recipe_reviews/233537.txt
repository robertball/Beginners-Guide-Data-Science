Made this recipe today. This is a keeper for sure. I used colbyjack cheese and farmland bacon. I brushed BBQ sauce on very light to seal in the juices. We will most definitely make these again.

We really loved these hotdogs - the bacon and cheese with a little tang from the mustard work great together!

I saw a picture on Facebook made this without ever seeing this recipe. The only differences is I didn't add mustard or pickles. Plus I put it in the oven at 350 for 15 min.

Excellent!! I smeared the mustard on the bun. If your gonna take the time to wrap a dog with bacon, use high quality and you won't be disappointed:) Delish!! Thank You Sandra 92083:) Keeper!
