D*MN! is all I and my family can say! I took this to a big family get together and it was voted unanimously (By northern italians) the BEST lasagne they ever had.  We are talking raised in northern Italy folks. Well, I made a few adjustments, to make it a bit easier. I used Barilla oven ready lasagne noodles, mixed my ricotta with 0ne egg and 1 frozen, but thawed and squeezed dry box of spinach. I thickened the bechamel by using 4T of flour instead of 2, it was very runny with just 2. (Dont skip the nutmeg, this is a great flavor complement. For the meat I used 7oz each of ground Buffalo, pork and veal. (Veal makes a difference, dont just use ground beef) and instead of tomato paste, I added 1 16oz can of wild porcini marinara.(found at Trader Joes) This is going in my forever book here at home. Not too saucy, not too cheesy, PERFECT!

The best lasagne I have ever had. I am never going back to the American version. The bechemel sauce really is key to this dish. One thing for new cooks making bechemel sauce, make sure you use whole milk. I tried making it once with skim milk and it didnt work. You need that fat in there. You can make the meat sauce a day or two ahead so it will develop its flavors more :)

Alrighty,
I found the pasta easy to make if you use your food processor. A good marble or teflon rolling pin makes rolling the pasta a breeze. No real need for a pasta machine  here. You can also make the pasta sheets the night before, layer between wax paper and refrigerate to expedite things in the kitchen  the next day.(do not cook pasta until ready to use)
I decided to double both sauces just in case I felt a single batch was too little.  (another reader complained of too little sauce) If you use a small food processor to chop your vegetables  you will be done in record time.
 I used most of both sauces when I assembled the lasagna. What a delightful  aroma while the Ragu was cooking.
This is not difficult, it just sounds that way. 
Excellent  flavors! Do try this one, you will be pleased, my guests certainly were.

We tried this once with regular lasagna noodles and were most impressed with the sauce.  We made the mistake of making too many layers though.  The second time, we made the spinach pasta ourselves, added some cooked spinach and eggplant to the layers, made extra sauce and it was amazing.  I highly recommend going heavy on the sauce part and trying to make the pasta... it was a little hard, but fun and worth the effort!

This so goooood! I've made it several times, exactly as written and its been perfect every time. I usually make it for a friend that hates pasta but loves 'noodles'. He loves this because the pasta is so thin, and there are so many flavors. It usually takes a bit longer for the prep time though. Can't figure out why,..

This was pretty good, but I'm not a fan of bacon or ham so I left it out. The veggies were overpowered by the cheese, so I might add more next time. And I wouldn't add any salt next time either, between the meat and the stock it is salty enough. I also didn't understand adding butter to the cheese so I left it out for a healthier dish. The overall flavor was very good, and not as time consuming as I expected. Great way to get veggies into the kids!

This lasagne is divine.  It's beautiful to look at, the fresh pasta melts in your mouth, the ragu is substantial without being overpowering, and did I mention the bechamel?  The overall effect is sophisticated, yet comforting.  Rolling out the pasta is the most labor intensive part, but after the first try it will be very simple to do the next time.  MAKE THIS LASAGNE.

Fantastic recipe, although, not for someone in a hurry. I made an alternate version of this same recipe by leaving out the chicken livers and substituting ground turkey and turkey ham. Although there was a change in taste, the calories and fat content dropped significantly.

Excellent recipe - so nice to see it done properly. I always infuse the milk for my bechamel with bay leaves though. Traditionally, bay is an essential flavour.

Yummy! I'm a college student living in a dorm and this was my first time cooking lasagna. My friends were amazed at how well it turned out. I didn't bother with the fresh pasta, but Ronzoni's worked ok and was really easy. I left out the chicken livers and used ground beef and italian sausage for the meat, which was pretty good. The ragu and bechamel were divine, and the amount of cheese was just right. This was all I wanted in a rich satisfying lasagna that didn't feel too artery-clogging.

I have made this lasagna for years, don't know where I got the recipe and did not know its ethnic origins - but I use regular lasagna noodles and it comes out great. I also make other 'specialty' lasagnas. When someone makes regular lasagna with tomato sauce, I pass.

Whoooa, this was amazing. So worth the labour (which I'm pretty used to, because lasagne is a frequent meal in our house). This is perfect as is, I'm sure, but I had to make adjustments because I didn't have semolina flour, chicken livers or any meat except for Italian sausage. And everything turned out totally fine. I also added some cream to the bechamel for a nice, rich finish as well as a sprinkling of mozzarella in the layers. Thanks so much for this recipe; it rivals the usual tomato-based lasagne! (I personally prefer this version!)

I was only able to make the sauce for this recipe (minus the chicken livers, everytime I went to the store they were out) but it is FAB on it's own and over other types of pasta...the Man-Boy loved it and I've already cooked it twice again! THANKS for the recipe, looking forward to trying it in it's complete form with the homemade spinach pasta...XO bellisimo!!

Outstanding recipe! This is about as close to the original as one can get.  The only curious differences are bacon instead of pancetta and chopped ham instead of ground veal for the sauce. The original "ragu Bolognese"  is on file and certified by the City of Bologna as I'm sure Arianna is aware.

My husband made this lasagna last night, and I swear, it is the best lasagna I've ever had in my entire life. WOW, the bechemel sauce was awesome. Hubby used Italian sausage instead of ground pork. He doubled the tomato sauces and cheeses in order to make more (family of seven here). And he added fennel and garlic. The herb flavor was outstanding.  Hubby comes from a family of Italians, so he wanted to make something authentic. Lemme tell ya...this is as good as it gets!

This recipe was an outstanding beginning to a great meal. Very, very tasty. I only say this because I made/ would like to suggest some changes (not flavor-wise, but quantity or ingredient). I am not a fan of dissecting recipes here on AR, but this one recipe deserves a second try. It WAS really outstanding! I had the hardest time finding semolina flour so I opted for an old homemade spinach pasta reipe I had. Well, that took forever to assemble. I do not have a pasta machine so it was very time-consuming. I do not know how much easier that step might have been, so I cannot really comment on the dish at that stage.  I think I would double the ragu next time, and I absolutely doubled the bechamel the first time. Be sure to delete a cup of milk (only 3 cups) when doubling, or it will be too loose, and add a lot more salt and nutmeg; at least a 1/2 teaspoon of each, or to your taste).  I also simmered the ragu for a good hour so it reduced nicely, and deleted the livers. I think they were totally unnecessary unless you were doing a day long simmer. Too strong a flavor. There are enough meats and vegies to add substance... and my DH hates them, anyway. Other than the above, I added an extra noodle layer just before the last bechamel/ parma (real, fresh grated parma reggiano) topping as my recipe made 12 sheets and I hate to waste, and reduced the butter pats by 1/2. It WAS REALLY GOOD! Truly GOURMET :)

Fantastic recipe.  I added 1/2 cup of wine to the ragu at the time I added the tomato paste (in accordance with other ragus of this nature I've made in the past).  I also added two cloves of crushed garlic to suit my taste.  The flavor combination is well worth your effort.  You WILL NOT be disappointed!!

This recipe is fabulous! I desperately looked for chicken livers but could not find any in the small rural Minnesota town that I live in - still it turned out better than any recipe that I have ever created. I used Bertoli lasagne pasta and added spinach to my meat sauce. Next time I will definately double the recipe to make 2 because the one went so fast that there was no left overs. Thank you for this incredible recipe!!

Wow! A work of art that is definitely worth the effort in the kitchen! I made this and had an Italian to dinner. She said it was the best she's ever had, and all eating it agreed. So tasty, and the pasta melted in your mouth. Exquisite recipe which will be a staple in my collection. Thank you.

Since I'm vegetarian, I left out the ragu and used a good jarred sauce instead. I also substituted store-bought wheat pasta for homemade, and added a little fresh basil. The bechamel sauce is what really makes this recipe, especially the nutmeg. I recommend getting block parmesan and grating it at home, too, the taste is so much better than with pre-grated.

Just wonderful!  I didn't change a thing.  It's time consuming, but not any worse than other lasagna recipes.  If you are sick of red sauce for pasta try this dish.

This is an absolutely spectacular recipe! A few notes;
-Even if you have never tried, making the pasta by hand is completely worth it. I found that making a little bit of extra dough made it easier to roll out the lasagne sheets. 
-I made the recipe completely as written once and enjoyed it, and also once with ground buffalo and enjoyed that too. I may play with the ingredients more in the future just for fun.
-I would highly suggest rolling out the sheets of pasta before you begin making anything else.
-Finally, I served this at a dinner party and some of my friends can be a bit picky. Everybody ate everything and some even took seconds - everybody loved it! Thanks for the magnificent and fun recipe!

This was amazing!  My husband and I both agreed we will never be able to do Lasagna another way.  I was unable to make the pasta from scratch due to time, but hope to give that part a try next time.  I'm sure it will make it even better if that is possible.

I LOVE the bechamel sauce in this lasagna. I used store bought boil noodles and skipped the chicken livers. The lasagna has a very interesting flavor--like no other lasagna I've had. My husband really enjoyed it. Next time, I would use store bought sauce instead of tomato paste and beef stock. The bechamel sauce is what really makes this lasagna.

This is pretty much a perfect recipe. I didn't make my own lasagne, and instead of using the mixture of minced pork and minced ham I used chopped up English bacon (which was the closest thing I could find here in England) and it still tasted delicious-- and all that on my first try on making it!

Followed instructions assiduously, and ended up with wayyyy too little bechamel, and the 'ragu' ends up more like wallpaper paste than a sauce. Overall a dry, pasty, cardboard texture, and precious little flavor either.  Severe disappointment after all the glowing reviews - noticeable how many changed substantial elements of this recipe, rendering their own versions completely dissimilar. Now I just have to figure out to do with the pound of chicken livers left over ...

This recipe is one of the best I have ever found on this website.  The ragu is incredibly flavorful and the home-made noodles are amazing.  I see a lot of people skip the home-made noodles, but really, you should give it a try!  They're a lot of fun to make and they make for a great story when your guests start raving about how amazing it is!

Absolutely mouth-watering.  Made this a few years ago and I was impressed with the flavor.  It is definitely time-consuming, but well worth every minute.  I made a double-batch yesterday and still wish I had made more since I shared it with four others.  The flavors meld even better over time in the fridge.  May even want to triple it!  Do not vary the recipe; it's superb as written.  The homemade pasta is what impressed my guests the most!  Highly suggest pre-making the pasta as another reviewer suggested.  I will be making this again and again.  (Takes me much longer than 1 hour - even with food processor, but I enjoy being in the kitchen.)

The ragu was magnificent - I will use that as a staple in some of my other recipes. I do not feel the chicken livers made much of an impact - I will leave them out next time. Garlic in the ragu is better (in my opion) plus I aded some fresh basil from the garden -yumm!! For ease - next time I will do store bought noodles.

Fanastic lasagne recipe.  A lot of work to prepare, but worth it.  I made it without meat, and it was still the best lasagne we have eaten.

I lived in Italy for three years. My Italian boyfriend would make a pasta al forno very similar to this and I loved it.  I never wrote down his recipe and am regretting it.  This is as close as I need to come.  American lasagne is terrible after you've had the real kind.  Thanks so much for this recipe.  Mille grazie!!!!

This was excellent and it was rewarding to spend the day in the kitchen and end up with such a melt in your mouth recipe. Served it w/our favorite wine,green salad w/bayshrimp and Danish Bleu. I hope I don't offend, by changing the authenticity to suit our tastes, but I added minced garlic to the ragu, omitted the bacon and chicken livers.  I hand added fresh grated romano and a little fresh parmesean to the bechamel.  Rich and divine.  Thank you!

WOW! The best lasagne I have ever made. My husband said it was the best he ever ate. I really struggled with the pasta, it was probably not thin enough, but it had great flavor. I will porbably resort to store bought noodles next time.

Lasagne assembly directions are flawed:  I had to add a 4th sheet of pasta.  Otherwise the bechamel/parmesan topping would have gone on the last layer of ragu, bechamel and cheeses.  Drain the browned meat before adding tomato paste and beef stock.  Too little bechamel and parmesan; they disappear.  Nothing dramatic.

This was wonderful ??. My Nona used ham in her lasagna as well. I had pancetta and  prosciutto so I used them up... Oh my word it was so close to my Nona's recipe. The bechamel sauce makes for a rich satisfying meal, with a salad it was perfect.
I had no boil lasagna noodles so I used them up. It still cooked for the same amount of time. This is a versatile recipe to use up  leftover items. But do follow the recipe exactly once to experience an authentic recipe.
Better half ate 3 large pieces! Next time I'm in Pueblo I will pick up the semolina to make my own pasta. This is now part of my permanent monthly menu!

Great flavor and better than most. Could things I would do in the future. 1. Double the ragu. It just needs more for 13x9. 2. More bechemal sauce as well. 3. A bit more tomatoe paste. Maybe 3 tablespoons.

I made this for a family dinner and everyone loved it. I admit I did not use the chicken livers or oregano in the ragu as no one in my family likes those flavors. This sauce was delicious. I also did not precook/par boil the fresh pasta noodles first, I just let them cook in the lasagna.  This will be my go to lasagna recipe from now on.
