This was very good.  I doubled the recipe to fill my bundt pan better.  I also used a bit extra banana.  It was very moist and flavorful.  We also chose to use chocolate chips but I know the walnuts would be great in the middle as well.
A family secret is to use sugar instead of flour to coat the pan after greasing.  Also put a layer of sugar on the top before baking.  This is a SURE way for everyone to eat the crust.  My daughter asked for more crust before she finished the middle! It doesn't burn and makes every bite wonderful!

This really is an excellent recipe.  Not only is it low in sugar compared to other banana cakes but it is low in fat too.  The cake is super moist and I used 1 cup of banana which gave it a really great banana taste.

Yum.  I will definitely make again.  I doubled the recipe for a brunch I was hosting, and it fit perfectly into a regular size bundt pan.  I omitted the nuts and used brown sugar in place of white sugar for the filling.  I also sprinkled chocolate chips into the batter, which I think really added some depth to the flavor.

This cake was super moist and very tasty.  I did not have any white sugar on hand so I used raw sugar with one tbsp brown sugar thrown in.  I had to supplement what white flour I did have with some whole wheat flour... which I will also do again.  I used toasted pecans instead of walnuts and sprinkled them througout the batter.  All in all, I think the recipe as given will also be wonderful without the changes I had to make.   

I doubled the recipe because this makes a small cake; it could also be made in a regular pan.  

You will really enjoy the smooth, moist cake this recipe produces!

im thrilled that this recipe only called for 8 tablespoons of sugar compared to the 2-3 cups i was seeing in other banana bread recipes. i also didn't have to have 3+ overripe bananas laying around. the flavor came out perfect, and the cake is moist. 

i dont have a bundt pan so i baked it in a 8x8 pan (which i forgot to grease), it only took 20 min. to bake at 350, and it didn't stick to the pan. thanks!

I doubled everything, which is essential if you want it to fill the bundt pan better. Next time I'll use brown sugar instead of white in the center, but otherwise this came out very nice!

Yummy!  I dusted my tube pan with sugar for extra yummy, used 2 bananas, and low-fat vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream and it was great!  I put whipped cream sprinkled with cinnamon in the center for a nice serving visual- and it tasted yummy too.  I got great reviews- next time I will double the recipe to fill my pan completely!  A keeper.

This was decent, not a typical coffee cake to me, but still yummy.  I do think that the recipe needs to be doubled to make a regular sized cake.  It barely filled up my bundt pan.  The flavors did blend together better after sitting for a day.

This is the second time I've made this cake and it turned out great both times.  I doubled the recipe and made it in a 9x13 pan.  I also changed the filling to a brown sugar & cinnamon mix b/c we don't like nuts.  A great way to use up bananas that are too ripe.

I guess I didn't realize my fluted tube pan was too big and made this recipe exactly as is.  Waaaay too little batter and the coffee cake came out about 2" tall! Tastes good, though!  Next time I'll double the recipe (and read the reviews first so I would have known to do that in the first place!).

this is so good and not too sweet. Recipe definitely needs to be doubled, still only filled the bundt pan 1/2 way. The batter was thick which concerned me but it turned out superb! I did not add nuts, instead I added about 1/2 bag of mini choco chips, also subbed about 1/3 of the sugar for agave syrup and instead of all white flour I used part whole wheat & ground flax seed.

This recipe for coffee cake is very good.  I made it exactly as written except added more mashed banana and that made it very moist.  The sour cream added a little zest to it.  I baked it in a 8x8 pan and added some shredded coconut on top.  very good recipe.

I thought this recipe was pretty delicious.  I agree with other reviewers that the recipe could be doubled to make a full sized bundt cake; mine turned out rather small--about half the size as the one pictured.  I used two bananas, which gave me about 1 cup, and I used brown sugar for the cinnamon and walnut mixture.  It baked for about 25 minutes and was moist and yummy.

using 2 bananas, i doubled recipe and cooked in 9x13 (about 30-34min). excellent! light, fluffy, and not too sweet. pecans instead of walnuts. i used a combo of white and brown sugars for the batter and for the filling. i like this cakey texture better than banana bread.

This is by far one of the best recipes I have ever used! I took the advice of others and instead of powdering my pans with flour I used sugar-great touch. Also, I had to use two times the batter to fill up my bundt cake. Instead of adding nuts I used a brown sugar ,sugar and cinnamon mixture-sooooo good.

Very good!!! I doubled it and added some flax seed and wheat germ and used white/whole wheat flour. I also subbed yogurt for the sour cream and I used 3 bananas total. My husband won't stop eating it.

I only had 3/4 cup of all purpose flour so I added 1/4 of whole wheat flour and extra 1 to 2 tbsp of sour cream.  Also I made a mistake by mixing the sugar/cinnamon/nut mix into the batter  instead of putting it on top of the cake after it is done.  But it turned out very good after all.

Wonderful recipe--I enjoyed the cinnamon-nut mixture. I thought brown sugar would be a nice touch for the mixture, so I used that in place of white. Glad I did! I substituted vanilla yogurt for the sour cream and had excellent results. The cake itself is moist; however, I expected a little more banana flavor...next time I will probably throw in another banana. A very light glaze might nicely complement this recipe...maybe next time!

This was really good.  I used chocolate chips instead of nuts and I used brown sugar in the filling. I doubled the banana.  It was very moist and I only had it lightly covered with plastic wrap.  It was not even tightly covered.  We ate on it for three days in the morning on a camping trip while we waited for breakfast to be done.  It was great in this facet and I think I would consider it to be more of a breakfast item then a snack cake.  I will double the recipe next time although the short pieces were kind of nice.  I did not top it at all.  It may have been nice with a drizzle of a white glaze but I liked it the way it was.  I had trouble telling how much was half of the batter so when I added the second half over the filling , it kind of bled through.

I also doubled the recipe and used 5 bananas but I think that was too many. 4 would have been better but the flavour was yummy. Next time I'll skip the sugar nut mixture and just mix the nuts into the batter since it's easier or maybe even blueberries instead. I sprayed the pan with pam and the cake slid right out.

I accidentally posted this to the wrong recipes (darn newbie here!) so please forgive the duplication.  This is the one I really meant to review.  

What a wonoderful recipe!  The cake comes out nice and moist with a rich banana flavor.  I doubled the recipe (I had three bannanas to use up!) and it worked well.  I also ommitted the nuts and just sprinled the cinnamon in the batter. Lastly, I chose margarine instead of butter this time and it certainyl did not seem the worse for wear.

I do think that it could use a nice light frosting so if anyone knows of a good one please post away!  I tried another from this site and it lacked the delicacy that I think would suit this particular cake.

Yummo!  I made a few changes because I was missing a few ingredients.  First I used strawberry yogurt instead of sour cream since that's what I had and I added 1 tsp of lemon juice to make up the acidity that was lost by not using sour cream.  I also put the cinnamon into the batter and instead of filling the ring with the nut mix (I had no nuts) I used chocolate chips.  The only problem I had was that my tube pan was too big so it didn't rise up inside the ring much and it cooked quicker than in the recipe.  I also used too few chocolate chips :)  Other than my failings the cake was great, I flipped it out and sprinkled with icing sugar and it lasted less than 4 days between my boyfriend and myself.

I doubled the recipe, used 3 bananas and added cinnamon baking chips to the nuts/sugar/cinnamon mixture.  The coffee cake came out moist and great tasting.  It would be good with chocolate chips too but I didn't have any in the cupboard.

I used 1/2 cup sugar in the actual batter, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and about 1/3 cup sour cream. I also added chocolate chips to the batter and sprinkled cinnamon on top before baking. I skipped the walnuts. I baked for 35 minutes. This was very moist and sweet and delicious; kids loved it.

My family loved this coffee cake and it is a great recipe to use up those ripe bananas.  Please note that this recipe is for a 6 cup Bundt pan, most pans are a 12 cup size.  Therefore, I doubled all the ingredients and it was the perfect size for my pan.  I poured in half a pan without nuts for my son, and quickly added nuts to the remaining batter.  Even with doubling the recipe, my cake was done baking in 35 minutes.  This is a tasty recipe with great presentation.  It will definitely be made again in our house.

Very good recipe!  The cake is light and moist and yummy!  I added about 1/2 cup more bananas to mine and used pecans because that's all I had on hand.  I think the next time I will double the recipe so the cake will be higher.  Will definitely be a repeat recipe in my house!

This is the yummiest, moistest banana cake I've tried so far. Just the right sweetness, I don't mind having it for breakfast & snack the whole week. I doubled the recipe, sprinkled brown sugar on the bottom of the pan before pouring in the mixture, sprinkled more brown sugar-cinnamon-nuts mixture on top before putting it in the oven. Result---perfect yumminess! Me and my daughter finished almost half the pan in just about 2 hrs. Friends even asked me to make some for them. Will definitely be the recipe I'll be using all the time I bake my own banana cake.

I must've used too large of a fluted pan(my mom actually laughed at how flat it was)..but even at that, this coffe cake just didn't work. It ended up dry, and not very flavorful. Definitely NOT the best way to use up over ripe bananas in my opinion!
