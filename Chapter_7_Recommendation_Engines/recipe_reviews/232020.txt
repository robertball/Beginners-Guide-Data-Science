Super easy with whatever veggies you have on hand.....delicious! I use OreIda hash browns which makes this recipe so quick to assemble!

Even though this is a Country Crock recipe, I did not use the butter.  A quick spray of Pam was sufficient.  I otherwise followed the recipe, adjusted the serving size to 6 servings, and it took longer to bake than stated.  45 minutes covered, and another 45 uncovered.  It's so versatile to use whatever you want!  Tip - potatoes must be dry!!  So if you're using thawed frozen potatoes, press with paper towels to remove all of the water.  Fabulous recipe!!

Good, easy recipe!  I used butter instead of Country Crock and seasoned a bit with salt, garlic, and pepper.  Also substituted ham for the bacon.  I think this is a great basic recipe it is easy to do small changes to...

I thought it was good but my boyfriend and daughter didn't much like it. I will try this again without the peppers and broccoli and add sausage & ham...

It was so easy to mix up. I'm hoping the piece I snagged to refrigerate for tomorrow tastes just as great cold.

Made this for breakfast this morning and was really good! Used broccoli, onions and red bell pepper. I did add salt and pepper to the mix and substituted 1/2 cup of cheese with pepper jack cheese. Did not have time to thaw the hash browns completely but still turned out great!

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out good but not fantastic.  This is a good basic recipe and  needs a little more spice for my liking. For the veggies I used mushrooms, onions and bell peppers.  I will make this again but next time I'll use 4 - 4 l/2 cups of saut√©ed veggies plus throw in 1 or 2 Serrano peppers or spicy sausage.  I need to play around with this recipe a little more. Thanks for sharing.

It was delicious! Even my husband who is not a casserole fan - took seconds! I added ham, broccoli, tablespoon garlic powder and green onions. Also substituted 1 cup sour cream with 1/2 cup skim milk for the 2% milk.

I put sliced fresh jalapenos on top during the last part of cooking.  I thought it was kind of bland.  Definitely needs seasoning.
