This was nice, but didn't taste like the Starbucks green tea frappuccino that inspired it.  Green tea powder would probably make it taste more authentic.  Regardless, my daughter and I enjoyed the flavor.  Be sure the brewed green tea is completely chilled so you don't melt the other ingredients, and we didn't use all of the sugar listed.  This is a nice change from heavier milkshakes!  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I don't really think it was fair of the last reviewer to rate the recipe without trying it. I have seen numerous green tea flavored recipes calling for matcha, which is nearly impossible to find. It would probably be quite expensive just for that reason. I was glad to find a green tea recipe that use brewed green tea, so I could try it. I followed the recipe exactly and just brewed a tea bag in some warm tap water for about 5 minutes. It did taste like green tea. I used 1/2 fat ice cream, but probably could have just used a couple packs of Truvia in place of the sugar. The only thing I would change is too start with one small drop of green food coloring and blend it. I did the 2 suggested and it looked like a shamrock shake.

Yum! Tastes like the Starbuck's drink it was created for. I've been wondering for a couple of years how to duplicate that drink and now here it is. Thank you chripuri91; I'll be making this in my rotation of morning drinks. Especially once it is summer. I used vanilla frozen yogurt since that is what I had, let a green tea bag steep for a long time so it was strong, 1 drop of food coloring and the ice cubes. The only thing I changed is the sugar. I tasted after 1 TBL and it was plenty sweet. Thank you, thank you!

This was SO good! After reading the reviews, I decided to go with the green tea matcha latte powder that I had on hand that I haven't been using. It gave it a great flavor that you otherwise would not get solely with the tea bags (sorry!).  Also, you get the green color, so you can skip the food color. For my own taste, I'd cut back even by half on the sugar --it was  a tad sweet. I can't believe that I forgot to add the ice,  but that would surely give it a nice frosty and thick texture. I'll definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

I agree with a previous review that said it didn't have really any green tea flavor. That being said I do love a good vanilla cream frappucino. Next time i would just use milk instead of tea.

Thank you for submitting this... It's perfect!
TIP: 
Don't add in too much vanilla. It takes out the flavor. 
Add the tea leaves for an authentic taste!
PERFECT RECIPE ; Quick and easy, and refreshing.
