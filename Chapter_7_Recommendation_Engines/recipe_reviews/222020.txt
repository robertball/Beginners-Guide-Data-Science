the flavor of these burgers was amazing!!!  However all the burgers completely fell apart on the grill, so we just chopped it all up, added a litttle leftover sauce and turned it onto Pineapple Teriaki sloppy joes!!  Turned out great!

My husband ate a burger like this at Red Robbin and he asked me to make it and he loves them, the teriyaki and pineapple are a really great flavor combo

These were the best burgers.  They actually did taste just like Red Robins.  Easy and very juicy.  I made them on the grill without tinfoil and no problems.  Will definately make again.

Tried this recipe for sliders.  Love love Love the flavor.  I made adjustments for personal taste of course, only because we have to have a little more heat on our burgers.

I liked this recipe but I did change it a little. For the actual burgers I added an egg and bread crumbs so that it would be moist and stay together. And instead of Swiss cheese I used cheddar cheese and added tomato to the sandwich. Also instead of ketchup I put a little bit of bbq sauce. Overall a good start up recipe.  Oh and I made them on my George foreman grill. Turned out great!!!

I made as directed and the burgers stayed together but wanted to fall apart.  I made them thicker than I usually would and which fine because the stayed the same size.  I flipped them gently and the melted cheese helped keep them toghether.  Also put the burgers on the bun at the grill so I didn't have to handle them much.  Flavor was good

Next time, I'll make sure I have lettuce because it would bring these burgers up to 5 stars for sure!

I added breadcrumbs and an egg to the meat mixture to keep pattys together and it worked great.  My family LOVED these burgers.  My husband had seconds and even my 5 and 3 year old little picky eaters couldn't get enough!
