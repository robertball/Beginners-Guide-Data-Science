This recipe is awesome.  I made it for a movie night with the girls, and I knew everyone else was bringing wine and cheese, and I wanted to bring something a little more substantial.  This is definitely filling.  It definitely needs a little something extra, so I think pepper jack could be a great addition.  I added some garlic powder but it definitely could have used some salt (or just used garlic salt).  The smell of the garlic brings everyone to the bread.  I think the sourdough is key - it just adds great flavor.  To make stuffing the bread easier, I stuck something small under different parts of the bread (a serving spoon, upside down), which would spread the bread apart.  Then I moved the spoon somewhere else after stuffing with cheese.

This wasn't quite as easy to prepare as I envisioned, perhaps I used to hard of a bread.  i had some difficulty "opening" the bread w/out ripping it apart.  Although, I did try shredded cheese thinking it would be easier, but now I think sliced cheese is probably the way to go (as the recipe states, duh).  The taste is great though and I think I'll try this one again.

Very good! Loved the flavor and tastes good reheated if you have leftovers. Shredded Monterey Jack might be easier to work with but still a great recipe!

I have prepared this Savory Party Bread twice now..took to a bbq and it was gone before I could snag a bite.  The second time it replaced our popcorn during a lazy afternoon of video's.  We LOVE this recipe and any leftovers you may have are easily reheated in the foil...thank you Kay!

This is a fabulous appetizer or soup accompaniment. I often substitute the Monterey Jack Cheese with Kassari or Asiago.Yummy!

Minus the cheese, I have been making this bread recipe for years to use with either my mom's hot veggie dip or my hot crab dip (I never used cheese before because cheese is in the dips).  It dresses up any sourdough loaf and it can stand alone as an appetizer or served with a soup. A must try appetizer recipe.

Very good! And very pretty:) I do wonder if there is a better way to have guests eat this without getting their hands all messy and all over the bread though?

So good! My supermarket didn't have sourdough bread, so I used just a big loaf of bread (not sure what it was called. (Looked like a really wide Italian bread without sesame seeds). I would use less butter next time, as the cheese is probably enough itself. REALLY good. Will definitely make it again and try different cheeses too!

I made this for a New Years Eve party and it was quickly gobbled up. Very easy to make as well. I do think it needed a little something else. Might try adding some bacon next time. A keeper!

SO easy and SO delicious... it went over so well at a party. It's fun to pull apart the pieces of bread to munch on! Just something about it... I'd recommend cutting it as close to the base as possible otherwise you'll end up with a sizable chunk of uneaten bread at the bottom. :)

This is a wonderful, impressive, easy appetizer. It is a bit messy, but here's what I do- serve it with 2 forks to pull the bread cubes out. Then there are not fingers all over it! Definitely a must try.

Fabulous idea!  My son suggested serving it with balsamic vinegar and extra virgin olive oil as a dip.  WOW!  Kicked it up 5 notches!  It's definitely going to be a party favourite.

I chose to used sliced pepper jack cheese and used minced garlic and a little onion powder in the butter mixture in place of the green onions.  Otherwise followed as directed.  The end result was good although I would not serve this at a party because it's a little messy to pull the bread apart.  There's no way to do it without everyone getting their hands all over it, unless you were to slice it all up before putting it out.  I had to bake mine longer than stated for the cheese to melt and most of the good stuff does go to the bottom of the loaf.

I made this for a party I hosted recently. It was delicious! I got many compliments on it. It just has to be eaten right out of the oven while it is still warm. It isn't very good once it sits out for a little while.

This bread was super good.  I made it for a get together and everyone kept on commenting how yummy it was.  Here are the changes I made: 1/4 c butter, 8 oz block of monterrey jack cheese cut into little squares to fit the slits and 1 clove of garlic minced.  I will definitely be making this again soon.

Sorry - - We were not fans of this recipe at all.  I made the recipe exactly as written, and it was terribly bland.  Maybe pepper jack cheese would have helped?  It needed some ZING (garlic, hot sauce, something.)  All in all, I had high hopes for this appetizer, but we were very disappointed.  I'm just glad I made it for my husband first before serving to guests.  Sorry, Kay.

This recipe has been a standard on New Year's Eve for several years, and there's a good reason--it's delicious!!!  Everyone absolutely loves it!  Over the years, I've learned that I only need about 1/2 the butter, although I've never had complaints when I go all in, either.  I also use pepper jack instead of plain monterey jack--it adds just a little bit of spice.  This recipe ALWAYS turns out great, and it's ALWAYS a crowd-pleaser.  Make it today!

This is fabulous!  I served it as an appetizer and it was a big hit!  My oven was full of other appetizers so I used my gas grill to heat it up and it worked great! Thanks for the recipe!
Update: I made this for my sister and she didn't have onions so we used fresh chives from her garden.  Oh my was that awesome.  They loved it as well.

I LOVE this recipe. I had it at a baby shower the other day and it was a huge hit. People huddled around it til it was gone. The person who made it used hawaiian bread and it was perfection. I am making it tomorrow for a New Year's Eve party. I can't wait.

My local bakery didn't have the sourdough that wasn't already sliced.  So I cut the already sliced loaf into little squares, coated with the butter/onion mix.  I also added salt and garlic powder into the mixture.  I added shredded Monterey Jack cheese, baked for about 10 minutes, then broiled for 5.  A huge hit!

This was soooooooo good! I made it for a get together with 8 people and we finished it pretty quick. I only used half the butter and cheese (and it was still plenty). Next time I will probably eliminate the butter altogether. Once the cheese melts, it's dripping with oil.

I also added 1 tsp of garlic salt to the butter/onion mixture. Yum! I look forward to experimenting with different kinds of cheese and bread.

I have made this twice in a week and it is fabulous. I've used a large french loaf as well as a round sourdough loaf. It would be hard to say which is my favorite. Once I mixed minced garlic with my butter and one I sprinked garlic salt over the top and in the cracks. Both were a huge hit. Also I used pepperjack cheese both times. YUM!

This is sooooo good! I have made this bread many times, sometimes subbing swiss cheese for the monterey jack. Either way it's GREAT! Also, I like to add some garlic powder (maybe 1 tsp.) in with the melted butter mixture and usually omit the poppyseeds because I never seem to have them on hand. Also, try this with King's Hawaiian round bread...you will NOT be disappointed, I promise! :)

Everyone at the party I brought this to thought it was great! it was a bit of a hassle to cut the sourdough, I'll probably try to do it differently next time. Good flavour and the butter drizzle is fantastic.

So easy and impressive to present! I make this all the time and always receive rave reviews. Block cheese is easier than shredded, and now that I have mastered the idea, I switch bread and cheese varieties all the time. Perfect for people who want to serve something fancy but don't have the time or talent to get complicated.

I love the idea of this but made changes from the way this was written.  I cut the loaf as written, but used shredded cheese and made a garlic butter to drizzle over instead.  Everyone loved it at my Christmas party.

This was easy, interesting, and tasty. I didn't feel like there was enough "drizzle". I may make more of the butter/onion/poppy mixture next time. Maybe I'm just not a good drizzler.

This is not as easy as it sounds; cutting and assembly alone take too long. Overall, this bread is pretty good and got good reviews, but hard to eat without cutting up into serving pieces after cooking. Not sure I would make this again.

Not too shabby on its own but it could use some tweaking.  I recommend getting the cheese at the deli -- you can get much thinner and more consistent slices that way.  I also recommend going half butter half olive oil, and mix in some onion powder, garlic powder, dried basil, and dried parsley to taste before drizzling onto the bread.

I had a realt hard time getting the cheese inbetween the cut slices of the bread. So I felt like all the cheese was on the top part of the bread pieces. I will try to make again and think of a better way to get the cheese into the bread without breaking it all apart!

I love this recipe. My mother has made it for parties as well as I. Always a big hit. I do not use the poppy seeds, Don't like there taste and don't want to ruin the taste of the cheese. They just get in the way.

This was very good, I brought to a girls night and it was gone within 15 minutes. I made some changes however, I bought a loaf of bread with roasted garlic cloves in it. I ended up pulling out the cloves however because I used garlic in the butter rather than the onion. Also I did not use the poppy seeds. It still came out great.

This is very good. I had 5 people ask for this recipe at 1 party. I added a dusting of garlic salt on top for extra flavor. I can't wait to try this with pepper jack cheese.
