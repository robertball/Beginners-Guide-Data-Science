This is pretty bland; however, here is what I did to improve on it...

Added:
1/2 diced yellow onion
1 diced red pepper

and I used EVOO instead of the butter.

On a second version I used the above ingredient changes and then used whole wheat pasta.

Thinking about adding steamed sliced carrots next time.

Simple and just plain delicious! I usually have this as a side dish, but tonight I need something quick and this was perfect for a "meatless" weeknight meal. I used a steam in bag of broccoli and sauteed some fresh portabella mushrooms in a little olive oil along with the garlic.  I didn't bother baking this, but just tossed everything together with a little olive oil, a bit of salt and cracked black pepper then topped it with some shredded Parmesan and Romano cheese - delish!

Good recipe, Karen. I added a bit of onion to the mushroom saute, (used fresh shrooms)more garlic and just a touch of Italian seasoning. Topped with a little fresh basil and parm.
I would definitely eat this again, and thanks for the recipe!

Made this tonight and thought it was great. I made a few minor tweaks - used cavatappi noodles, added extra garlic, a splash of Worcestershire sauce, and some leftover frozen shrimp I had. It would have been just as good without the shrimp. Also topped it off with a couple of handfuls of mozzarella before baking. After tasting the final outcome, I think this would also be good with portabellas and/or a pesto sauce mixed in. Will definitely make this again!

We have a similar recipe at a local restaurant that is very popular with patrons. Based on other's recommendations, I jazzed it up.  I used EVOO and butter (the butter is the taste it needs), and added a dash of kosher salt and fresh ground black pepper.  What an easy side dish to grilled pork chops!

This was one of the best side dishes I've made from Allrecipes. I love broccoli and mushrooms and struggle with ways to make them creative and new. The result was amazingly delicious. My only changes were using a vegetable corkscrew pasta instead of cavatelli, which created a colorful palatte. And I used fresh mushrooms. It was sooo good. I did add a bit of salt and pepper as well, but I thought it had great flavor; not bland at all. I can't wait until lunch tomorrow to have more and to schedule a dinner party so I can show it off! Thanks so much for a fabulous recipe.

This was a great dinner, didn't have a lot of flavor. I used 1/4 c. olive oil instead of butter, maybe that's why. I was trying to make it less fat. I used a parm and romano mix. I will make it again and play around with the flavors

My cousin gave me this recipe to try, and my husband and I LOVED it!!  Not exactly a "heart healthy" dish, but I'm thinking of substituting some or all of the butter for olive oil next time.

This is a delicious dinner and is easy to make!  I spiced it up a little with some crushed red pepper flakes and various seasonings.  We also tried it by adding pesto to it, but I like it better without.  You could use less butter, about 1/2 as much is enough.  I added extra parmesan cheese and topped it with mozzarella before baking.  I will definitely make this many more times!

Made this last night, it was very good.  My kids like things like butter noodles and other bland tasting dishes.  I was out of mushrooms but went for it anyway and they were very happy although, I did add onion with my garlic and a pinch of garlic salt (we're big garlic fans and I didn't have three cloves).  We all liked it!

Decent base recipe but needs some additions. I started the broccoli in a saute pan with a little vegetable broth & let it steam a bit, then used fresh mushroom, canned have very little flavor to me and added the garlic. Sauteed in a 50/50 blend of evoo and butter, and a little crushed red pepper (to taste).  Cooked and drained the pasta and then added it to the same pan, no need to bake it. Sprinkled liberally wth the parmesean before serving. YUMMY!

A bit bland, but it has potential. In addition to some of the ideas provided, I would double the mushrooms, use most of an onion, and more parmesan. Mozzarella cheese on top added a lot.

Like another reviewer stated, I absolutely LOVE the idea and flavor of broccoli and mushrooms! I LOVED this recipe, though I will be experimenting with it... I think it is very versatile. I had Rigatoni pasta in the house, and any good pasta like that will do, but the Cavatelli pasta is excellent. I used fresh mushroom, a whole package. I cut back on the butter to 2 Tablespoons and used minute amounts of oil as needed, everything sauteed nicely and came together nicely. I used fresh Parmesan. I did add some pepper, but since Parmasan already is salty, and we are cutting back on salt for health purposes, I did not add salt. I hope to play around with some more... I think it is wonderfully flavorful and HEALTHY!!! Karen, thanks so much for sharing this recipe!!! A+ all the way!

I used fresh baby portobello mushrooms and added a little extra garlic.  It hit the spot on a cold winter evening!

This was an excellent, tasty meal.  My husband and I both enjoyed it.  I used a tablespoon of minced garlic, and it just came out wonderful.  I will definitely add it to my cookbook.

Made as a side dish.  Used 8oz fresh mushrooms. Good flavor.  For future I would use less pasta. I forgot to cover and it got a bit too dry.
Just made again and covered.  Changed rating from 4 to 5 - very good and moist. Used 8oz tri-color rotini.

I wouldn't suggest microwaving to cook any foods.  Just not a healthy way of cooking.  If you steam the broccoli for 2 mintues that'll do it! Other than that this receipe was very bland so I had to kick up knotches with fresh basil and chopped roman tomatoes, portabello mushrooms and pecorino romano and fontina cheese! Most delicious!

Yes, this is Cavatappi pasta in the picture.  NOT Cavatelli.
Pasta can really "bland" the flavor of the dish, it's individual preference.  Add more garlic, EVOO, parmesean cheese or herbs of choice, and sometimes it's going to take a lot more to get the flavor/consistency you like in a pasta dish.

Yum!  I added an onion, sauteed the broccoli with the other veggies in both butter and EVOO, and added a little mozzarella and fresh basil on top before baking.

Tastes almost EXACTLY like a dish we served at an Italian restaurant I used to work at.  I used penne instead of cavatelli and found that I didn't need to put it in the oven, but otherwise, followed the recipe.  My four year old is LOVING it as is my friend's six year old daughter.  Definitely making this again!

I made this as a side dish for 5 people and I would definitely do it again! I only had rotini pasta around so I used that, texture was different but it worked well. I also added just a bit of thyme (I loved it but some didn't) to the butter and also salt. I think it turned out great, it was better than the main dish. I should also mention that my 8 yr old ate it up aswell!

Mild flavor, substituted olive oil for butter.  Still trying to play with recipe to add a spice or two but can't find anything that wouldn't upset the balance.  Great on reheats or as cold.

I liked the recipe very much with the exception that 3 cloves of garlic were a little much for the size of the recipe.

My husband and I liked this recipe a lot. We used fresh mushrooms instead of canned. It did lack a little taste for as much butter that was in there. But it was still very good. :)

I used this as a side dish and omitted the cavatelli since the main dish that I was serving already had noodles. I liked the idea of steaming the broccoli ahead of time while I sautéed fresh mushrooms, fresh garlic, and onion in the butter. To me the butter is what makes the sauce but I think my next attempt will include a bit of olive oil. I also added salt and pepper to the sautéed mixture.  Thanks for a good starting point, Karen!

I liked this pasta dish. I added onions and more garlic. Since my kids don't like broccoli, I mashed them and everyone in the family are it all. I will do it again.Thank you.

Yum. I followed all directions as it was posted and it was very very good. The mushrooms definitely add to this dish. The parmesan, butter and garlic cling deliciously to them. I am making this again and I am going to add cubed chicken. Try it, its great!!!

My kids (3 of them, under 6 years old) loved this!!  I didn't have any mushrooms (they love mushrooms), so I added baby carrots with the broccoli instead.  Really good family dinner.  Everybody cleaned their plates!
