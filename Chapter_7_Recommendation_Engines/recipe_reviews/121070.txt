I used beef smoked sausage and it was really good! I used 1/2 each of red pepper, green pepper and yellow pepper.  Everyone really enjoyed it.

This dish is very good with a few revisions. Definitely cut the spices by 1/2 tsp. Even then it was a bit much. I also added a little less than 1/4 cup of chicken broth. Over rice was great.

This recipe would be better if you cooked potatos with the other ingredients instead of serving it on rice.

Very quick and easy dinner. It tasted pretty good, too. I used about twice the amount of all veggies it called for. Next time I might at a can of tomatos or some chicken broth so it has a little "juice" to go over the rice and maybe some red pepper flakes as well to give it a little kick.

This was good. My mom and I liked it but my husband and dad liked it more. I reduced the amount of the seasonings like others suggested and I added crushed red pepper. Also I added a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh because I did not have any. Definately different. I would make it again for they guys if they asked for it.

This recipe was definitely yummy! I decided to do brown rice b/c its healthier and the only thing I would do next time is mix a little seasoning in with the rice right before its finish so its not so bland, even salt or pepper for taste.  I also did add zucchini.

Great recipe but i used 1/2 teaspoon of orgeano, basil, and garlic powder and a pinch of salt and pepper. it was perfect, any more would have been too much! Also, i served it with roasted potatos instead of rice.

I cut down the dried spices to 1 tsp each and added 2 cups of cooked rice to the other ingredients in the pan with 1/2 cup of chicken broth. This dish makes the kind of leftovers my husband and I love!

I loved this but I have to use a little less oil than the recipe calls for.

I made this recipe last night, and it was quick to make and very, very delicious.  My boyfriend is a picky eater, and he really enjoyed it.  I will definitely make it again.

This was great, very wonderful flavor to it. Instead of strips of the peppers, we chopped everything up which we liked better though.

I liked it, kids thought it was pretty good.  Hubby didn't care for it.
