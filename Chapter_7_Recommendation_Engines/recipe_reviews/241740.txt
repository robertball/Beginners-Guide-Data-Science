I was excited about trying these cups & followed the recipe exactly but the resulting product was not what I anticipated. The cups are not crispy at all.  You need to have some water on hand when shaping them as the batter really sticks to your fingers.  I think the ingredients need to include butter or margarine or oil or something that would allow them to crisp. Eliminating all fats isn't necessarily always a good thing.  I'm really sorry I can't recommend this recipe.

I thought they were going to come out crispy but they were chewy, which I didn't care for. Also, the banana flavor was really strong, which I wasn't expecting. If I make these again, I'll probably try applesauce instead of a banana and I would really like to figure out how to make them crispy.

I substituted half the honey for some smooth almond butter 
 to reduce the sugar and add some extra protein. They turned out great with a fantastic flavor and chewy texture. My kids and I loved it!

Very difficult to press granola mix into cups. For the value of the ingredients, this was a waste of time recipe.

I didn't make any changes and they are ok. Very delicate and fall apart easily if you try to get them out of the pan too soon. I would add more cinnamon to the base and use a vanilla flavoured Greek yogurt (I used plain and it was a little bland)

These were great!  my family loved them and I plan on making them again soon!  They were fairly easy, except for that they took quite a while to make.  I would recommend making them the day before and leaving them in the fridge overnight, but it works either way.

Made it as described except I left them to chill overnight before I baked them and they turned out great. They were a huge hit for a birthday brunch and looked super cute as well! These would easily be customizable with adding nuts or other things you enjoy in granola.

It was undercooked, needs another 10-15 minutes to cook the oatmeal.

They turned out very good.  I will make sure that the bottom isn't too thick next time.

Lots of compliments from those who ate them and fairly easy to make!

My hubby and I loved it. I made the recipe to the T except did not fridge for one hour 1st like it said to, I just put it right in the oven for 20 min and it was perfect! I could really taste the almond extract and I used vanilla yogurt like it said to instead of plain.
