The batter was soupy.  I added a tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp all spice, then poured it into a prepared pan and baked it like a cake.

Fair taste, yet these cookies were a tad dry. I liked the idea of an old fashioned recipe, however this was essentially cake, made up into cookies.

This was a great old-fashioned tasting cookie! It is definitely cakey, so if you don't care for those kinds of cookies, then this is probably not for you. I added a tablespoon of vanilla and a teaspoon of nutmeg and cinnamon to make it more flavorful. I iced it with an orange powdered sugar glaze at the end (3 tablespoons of oj, 1.5 cups of powdered sugar). The dough was not for cutting, so I made these as drop cookies and they formed beautifully. Also, I ended up with a lot more cookies than the recipe called for...so plan on making some for others as well! Everyone will thank you for it!

I really liked this recipe.  This is not a rich cookie--it is delicately flavored and has a soft, dry, cake-like texture.  Which is exactly what I was looking for.  The dough is very soft and hard to work with--I had to put a ton of flour on the board to keep it from sticking.  I used a 2" cutter and baked them for about 12 minutes.

There are major errors in this recipe.  It is a cake batter.  You cannot roll it out.   There is no time for baking. I had a huge mess.  I will not be doing this again.
