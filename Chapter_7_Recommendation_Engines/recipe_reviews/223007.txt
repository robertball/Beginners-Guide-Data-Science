Congratulations for being a cancer survivor ~ & getting to live near Mt. Rainier! I love this recipe. It is great as is or can be changed so many ways; nuts, fruits, grains. I used pistachios, craisins, dry cherries, pecans, ground flax seed & added 2 cups rice krispies.

These are great, Alison! While I was mixing this recipe, I kept thinking back to the time I hiked Mt Ranier in '94. Congratulations on your journey! I enjoyed your video that goes with this recipe. These bars have nice flavor. I used almonds, pumpkin seeds, raisins and cranberries. I used oat bran in lieu of wheat germ. If you cut into these bars when they are warm, they are very crumbly. Wait until they cool, and they are perfect granola bars!

These were awesome!  I also added Reese's peanut butter chips since my boys like lots of peanut butter.  They said "Mom, don't ever buy the bars at the store again.  These are awesome!"  They are more filling and taste so much better than the store bought ones.

These were great. I needed gluten free, so I used gluten free quick cooking oats, puffed millet (for extra volume), but didn't have any of the seeds, wheat germ or nuts, so I didn't use any. I put extra dried fruit in (I used mango, apple, prunes & raisins). They were delicious! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to completely change or gut the recipe, but wanted a healthier, gluten free recipe. I will definitely use this again. Thanks for posting!

Delish!  I was looking for a recipe w/o eggs and butter, that uses honey instead of corn syrup and this was it!  Perfect!  This is my go to recipe for granola bars, will be easy to vary too!  Thanks for posting and congrats on your cancer survivorship and climbing mt. Rainier!

Made these for my 19 & 17 year old son's and they made me promise to never buy the store bought bars ever again.  Used dried organic blueberry's as my dried fruit.  

Loved them will be making these for years!!

Boy, was I ever excited to make these!  I made them, but without the wheat germ and sesame seeds, replacing them with flax seeds.  I did not use walnuts either -- I used dried coconut instead.

I should have known they would be reeeeeeally nutty -- the chunky peanut butter was a little overwhelming.  My taste buds think that they are too greasy and salty, but my husband really likes them!  Also, they are a bit too crumbly.  I wanted more uniformed bars -- like the over-processed gross ones in the grocery stores.

For my first time making granola bars though, I am impressed.

These turned out great and were really easy to make! The only substitution I made was using agave nectar instead of honey.

I so wanted these to work out for me. They seemed uncooked and then overcooked within a matter of a couple of minutes. I made 1/2 recipe and put it in an 8x8 pan, so I may have been partially to blaim. I did the mixed dried fruit suggested, apricot and prunes, and then added some cherry juice sweetened cranberries. They ended up just too hard to eat. I thought, I could salvage them into granola with milk. However, they never softened up. To top, the taste was like over-cooked peanuts or peanut butter and hard fruit. I wish I didn't waste all of those ingredients. My only suggestion is to keep a good eye on these, especially when they are coming close to being done.

This is a good recipe that has a lot of room for substitutions depending on what you have in the pantry.

So, so, unbelievably dry. Made them for a friend who is really active - he couldn't even eat one without it crumbling. We took the rest and used them as a granola topping on yogurt, which was pretty good.

These were some of the best granola bars I have ever tasted.
