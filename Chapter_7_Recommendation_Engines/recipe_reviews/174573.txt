The flavor of this is fabulous - but it was way too wet, almost pasty. I  even reduced the amount of peaches because it seemed like too many to me. The only way I can see this working for me is if I reduced the peaches more, or used dried peaches. I may try again, because I really want it to work. Thanks! :)

I made some adjustments to this recipe after reading others' comments.  I reduced the amount of baking powder for one thing....4 Tablespoons??? I have a feeling this is a typo and should have been 4 teaspoons.  Consequently, that's what I did and it worked just fine.  Then I upped the amount of sugar to 1 cup.  Since I didn't have any sour cream on hand, I substituted yogurt and used sour milk for the liquid.  When I cut up my peaches I had roughly two cups; that seemed to be in proportion to the amount of batter that I had.  I added 1/4 cup ground almonds and then sprinkled sliced almonds and some brown sugar in the pan before pouring in the batter. I baked the cake for 1 hour and 15 mins. and it turned out just fine.  My husband just helped himself to a second piece, in fact.  It would be good served with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of peach ice cream!

Unlike the previous reviewer this cake wasn't too moist for me, perhaps because I too thought that 6 peaches seemed like a lot.  I reduced it to 3 peaches, and that was fine, though going with four might be better.  My issue with the cake was that it was more like bread than cake.  I am not a fan of overly sweet anything, even desserts.  That being said, this needs more sugar, even by my standards.  Perhaps the sweetness was less than adequate because the number of peaches was reduced, but i really think the cake would have a hard time getting all the way done with so much fresh fruit.  I loved the idea of this cake, and am so disappointed that it didn't rock my world like I was hoping.  I would try it again, perhaps just sticking to the recipe despite my doubts, if it weren't so much work.  I don't mind putting in time for something that turns out fabulous, but when there are so many doubts it just doesn't seem worth it...
