I would give this 5 stars, except that I really didn't like the salsa.  The burgers are OUTSTANDING though, and I make them once a week!  I have decided to use a store-bought salsa with pineapples and peaches in it (mild) and that seems to work out great with it.

I loved this quick and easy recipe! My husband didnt really understand the concept of a burger without ketchup and cheese...but he liked it too!

These were good, but seemed like they needed a little something more. The only thing I changed was using lime juice instead of orange, since that is what I had. I cooked them up on a grill pan and we ate them on whole wheat buns. My husband thought it made it better to add BBQ sauce to his. Overall, I thought these were good, but I have made better turkey burgers (like the "Actually Delicious" and the Mexican turkey burger recipes on this site.)

I really liked the flavor of this dish, however, I made wraps instead of burgers. I also made a sauce with about 2tbsp ea of mango and pineapple, 1 tbsp mayo, jerk seasoning to taste, about a tsp of vinnegar and brown sugar, and pineapple juice to thin it out. I pureed it and let it sit until dinner was ready. It was soo good!

These were just okay.  I followed the recipe for the burgers exactly and I think there was too much green onion and too much parsley for me.  I may try these again.

I made the burgers - nice change to the usual!  Didn't have all the ingredients to make the salsa but it sounds delicious!

I wish there was a half star option for recipes, because this was really more of a 3.5 star recipe.  The burgers were pretty good and the salsa was pretty good, but together on a whole wheat roll they were just ok. They weren't bad, but I probably won't make them again.  I thought they tasted like they needed something, but I don't know what. They got mixed reactions from family members, ranging from "yum" to "yuck."
