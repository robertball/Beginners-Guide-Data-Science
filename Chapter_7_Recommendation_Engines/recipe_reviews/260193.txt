For everyone complaining about burnt chicken,just place your chicken on a rack on the bottom of your pot. It can't burn if it's not touching the bottom.  A real simple fix. I made this recipe at least 20 times to perfection.

I am the submitter of this recipe, and I am glad people are enjoying it. Just a few comments. This recipe is mainly for the method, and the taco seasoning, salsa and broth you choose are going to make a huge difference in how yours tastes. I use homemade taco seasoning mix, homemade chicken broth with no added salt,  and cheap Aldi's salsa, and it tastes wonderful to my family. I have not had any issues with burning, even when I double or triple the recipe; but,  I'm glad that the rack/trivet has been suggested and is working for some people!

I made this using fresh chicken breasts and doubled the recipe.  I loved that I could just throw all the ingredients, set the timer and walk away.  What came out was incredibly tender fall apart chicken that took no effort to shred.  I placed the shredded chicken back into the pot with the yummy liquid and let it sit for about an hour.  I combined this with drained black beans and brown rice for burrito bowls lunches for the week.  This will be one of my go to recipes from now on, it was delicious!

Try shredding your cooked chicken with your electric hand mixer — it works fabulous. Do it when it’s still warm.

After reading multiple reviews, I took the advice of Chef Tom and put the chicken on the metal rack that came with the instant pot. My chicken wasn't burned, and it was surprisingly moist and so delicious.

I love this recipe.  I made it in a crockpot on low.  4-5 hours.  Delicious.  Will make again. Oh, and I used fajita seasoning instead of taco seasoning.

We used frozen , boneless, skinless chicken breasts and thighs.   For the salsa we used a whole can of Rotel with salsa spices and then all the other ingredients as written. It was perfect! Because we used a whole can of Rotel and broth, ours had a good amount of liquid.  This was fine for us. This recipe is so versatile and a keeper!!

This was a big hit with the whole family!

I actually did not eat this. I made this on a night I had to run to class, however, my husband and kids (ages 7, 5 & 1) gave this 5 stars.  I used a half packet of taco seasoning due to the kids but my husband said the entire packet would have been better as instructed in the recip. They topped it with cheese, tomatoes, red onions, peppers, lettuce and avocado. My only complaint was with my instant pot directions since mine does not have a poultry setting. Using frozen chicken I selected the meat setting and tried to set the timer for 15 minutes it ended up cooking longer (user error, ugg) but they said it was delicious. Will be making this again! Thank you for the recipe!

So easy and fast in the Instant Pot Duo that I just got - this was the first meal I made in it. Made almost exactly as posted except I added 1/2 cup more of Salsa and used 1.5 lbs of thawed Chicken Thigh meat (it's more tender). I did not need the trivet and it did not burn and was ready in 10 minutes!! Made chicken tacos and my 5 year old even ate them!

This is the best from-frozen chicken IP recipe I have made yet. I took the advice of placing the chicken on the trivet and out if the liquid. I think that made all the difference. I will make all my chicken breasts like this, with

The taste is good, but was burned. Need to add (double) more broth or water. I used some chicken thighs and they were better & more moist than the breast pieces.

I used chicken thighs, bone in, no skin. No taco seasoning mix, just salt and pepper Penzey's Florida Pepper. Thickened the juices left with some sour cream and served them over riced cauliflower with cheddar cheese.

This turned out better than I expected. The chicken was flavorful, tender, and not overly spicy. I added about a tablespoon of olive oil to help prevent any burning like the other reviews mentioned. Makes great chicken for serving atop a salad, along with shredded cheese and sour cream.

This is a regular rotation at our house. I use water instead of broth. After shredding the chicken I place it back in the pot with the mixture and mix well. I then drain the chicken in a colander and place back into the pot. Press the sauté function and drive off a little of the remaining liquid for about ten minute stirring occasionally. This gives us the seasoned chicken without the drippiness. Absolutely love it!

Made it with salsa from our local restaurant and I used the Kirkland taco seasoning mix. It didn't burn even though it was in the pot with no trivet. This will be great on a tortilla!

Flavor is good, but I think you need to add more liquid, or put the liquid in first ahead of the frozen breasts. I kept getting BURN on the Pot and had to keep stirring. Once it got going though; was fine.

Made per the instructions with frozen chicken.  Also discovered "1 oz" of taco seasoning is basically a whole package of taco seasoning (at least it was of the brand I bought - Organics).  I thought the chicken came out a little tough, but it was tasty enough and it doesn't get much easier to make than this!

The only changes I made was I didn't have chicken broth so I used a chicken bouillon cube and just heated it up in half 1/2 a cup of water and I also accidentally dropped in more than half a cup of salsa But either way it was a great meal

I used the rack in the instapot as others have mentioned and also doubled all the wet ingredients - chicken turned out really moist and delicious - we added tortilla chips at the end with homemade queso to make sloppy nachos

Great dish for Taco Tuesday!  The only change that I made was I used a bottle of beer instead of chicken broth.  I put the frozen breasts on the rack as other reviews mentioned so that the chicken wouldn't burn.  I had leftover rice from Thai food 2 nights ago, so I made it into Mexican rice (added saffron, cumin, salt, pepper, and a bit of tomato paste).  Served it with tortillas, guac, salsa, shredded cheese, and shredded lettuce.  Delicious!!!

It was my first time using a pressure cooker, so I could have cooked it in a bit less time as I wasn't cooking from frozen. I threw in some green pepper with it as well.

I added some chopped fresh tomatoes and then followed the recipe as it was written. I used my slow cooker- 6 hours on low. It made a lot of flavorful sauce which I served on brown rice.

Skipped the taco seasoning. Seasoned thawed chicken breasts with Lawry's seasoned salt and McCormick Italian & Herb blend. Put the chicken broth in first, then the seasoned breasts on the rack, then poured Tostitos Mild Splash of Lime chunky salsa on top. Set the Instapot to poultry and 15 minutes. Came out great! Paired with white rice. Will definitely make again, will try the taco seasoning next time to make tacos.

I used water instead of broth and put it in the pot first. No issues with any burn notice.  I used about a cup of peach salsa and this turned out really delicious.  I will certainly make it again.  I served it over rice the first night and used the rest to make chicken nachos.

This recipe was super easy and quick!  It needed more salsa, but that is probably just personal choice.  Next time, I won’t use the rack.  I think if it cooks in the liquid, it will be infused deeper into the chicken.  Definitely will be making this recipe again.

I made this today in my Instapot. I did not have the other sauces....so I used what I had at home...
 
4 frozen chicken breasts.  
1/1/2 cups of enchilada sause...
6 green California peppers (chopped)
1 red bell pepper (chopped)
5 garlic cloves (minced)
1 onion
1 cup water
salt and pepper to taste..
I sauteed all vegetables.... then added the chicken on top and added sauce and water...
Then, pressure cooked it for 20 minutes
....
served it with Spanish white rice
tostadas, and queso fresco Don Francisco.
My family loved it...

This was a great recipe.  I added onion flakes and garlic powder.  Chicken did not burn in the Instant Pot.  I cooked 2 fresh chicken breast for 8 minutes + QR and they were very moist.  I diced up the meat and put it back in with the sauce reserving a cup to be spooned over the burrito.  The vote is to make this recipe again.

I did it with 2 lbs of chicken so I doubled the recipe, and then I pulled the chicken out of the pressure cooker when it was done and used the leftover salsa and chicken broth and made rice into it. It was delicious, and a great quick and easy one dish meal.

Quick, tender, and tasty! I followed the directions with one exception: I used thawed chicken breasts. Didn't burn a bit. Tastes great and it's really tender - it shredded easily with two forks. Will definitely make again!

This chicken was excellent and I will definitely make it again! Just to be safe, I did a cup of the chicken broth and out the chicken on the little rack that came with my Instant Pot. I also used jerk seasoning instead of taco seasoning and it was a delicious combo with the salsa.

Wonderful! Didn't burn at all and I didn't use the trivet. I've been looking for something close to the Taco Cabana shredded chicken since they took it off their menu for my wife and this nailed it! Perfect flavor, fast way to get mexican-themed shredded chicken meat on the table for tacos, burritos, baked potatoes, or whatever else. Wife was very happy!

Made as directed except used homemade taco seasoning mix. Shredded the chicken and added it to a bowl with some Instant Pot Mexican Rice.  Nice and easy meal.

For someone new to Instant Pot cooking it was a very easy recipe to follow.  The flavor was very good.  Followed other peoples's suggestion about cooking the chicken on a trivet and had no burned flavor at all.

So ridiculously easy! I followed the recipe exactly as written, and it was perfect! My only future edit will be to triple it, as it only made just enough for one meal for my family of five, and I'd really love to have leftovers for another lunch and dinner, to cut down on cooking, since this would be so versatile (tacos, nachos, taquitos, enchiladas, quesadillas, etc.).

Made as is, family loved it.  Super easy to make.  Started with frozen chicken but was still pink after 15 minutes so set for another 15 - will add additional time in the future.

Very good recipe for salsa chicken, which can be used for so many different meal options. I used homemade taco seasoning (Taco Seasoning I by Bill Echols) and La Victoria Salsa (Mild). I followed other reviewer suggestions and placed the chicken breasts on a rack, topped with the salsa. Thought it would need more broth and added an extra 1/2 cup broth as well. The only change I would make is to reduce the cook time to 6 minutes as the chicken seemed dry, but not a problem with 8 minutes cook time (thawed chicken) as I added most of the remaining liquid in the pot to the meat which brought back moisture and more flavor too. Used this recipe to make a large batch of chicken enchiladas which was perfect! Served with Instant Pot Mexican Rice by Bren. Excellent meal for us last night! Thanks for the recipe!

This was so easy and very good.  I used the rack in the bottom of my cooker as others had suggested.  I also doubled the salsa and chicken broth because my Instant Pot says to use at least 18oz. of liquid when pressure cooking...probably didn't need the rack since I had the extra liquid.  Bottom line, the chicken didn't burn and was cooked nicely.  We used romaine lettuce to make lettuce wraps as I had seen suggested in a slow cooker version of this recipe.  Topped with cheese, tomatoes, avocado and sour cream.  Yummy!  Next time I'll try making it with Rotel.

Easy, yummy, moist chicken for tacos. I doubled the recipe and it was great, but cut the sodium by using just one taco seasoning packet and mixing it with 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp chili powder, 1 tsp onion powder, and 1/2 tsp black pepper so there would be enough to cover 2 lbs of chicken.

used package of chicken thighs, not frozen, cooked 9 minutes.
Did need to cook down sauce after shredding chicken to thicken it up, as it was a little watery. was very tasty, even better the next day..

Loved this!  So flavorful and easy to make.  I did add a little more liquid as suggested by other reviews.  The chicken was moist and tender.  I served it with rice and a fresh salad.  I'm looking forward to the leftovers in a wrap or quesadilla style!  Even my finicky husband raved about this one!

When I took out the chicken to shred it, I added black beans, corn and onions and sauteed it for about 5 minutes (and added the shredded chicken).  Served it with rice, cheese, lettuce and sour cream.  DELISH!

I keep almost everything the same, except I double the amount of salsa. Make sure you are pouring your sauce back into the chicken after you shred it because the chicken itself doesn’t take in much flavor.

So easy and convenient!  I ended up with way too much liquid  though so I will only add a couple tablespoons next time just to prevent burning or sticking.  After shredding(which was quick and simple because the chicken is so moist), I put the chicken back in the pot, added frozen corn and black beans then simmered until heated through.  Used for chicken taco salads.  Yummy!

I doubled the recipe and used beef stock I already had open and it worked great. Used the chicken for quesadillas, will definitely be using this again!

the chicken was tasteless and dry  without the sauce.  My family did not enjoy it.

This was my first attempt at using my Instant Pot...and it was a winner!  My family loved it!  My adjustments were that I used boneless, skinless, frozen chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts and a low sodium taco seasoning; that is what I had on hand:)  The chicken was cooked perfectly, tasty and moist!  We will be saving this recipe and will be putting it into the regular dinner rotation:)

I make this almost weekly and always recommend it to new instant pot users. The meat is so versatile and can be used in so many different ways. I tend to add back beans and use as filling for quesadillas and burritos, nachos or add to rice and top with cheese for a super easy casserole.

Made this last night for dinner. I made as  written and added some leftover black beans and corn at the end. We put over Brown rice. The chicken was moist and tender. Easy to put together. Will make again.

I made it just like the recipe said.  Not sure why people say it burned.  Came out perfect!  After shredding the chicken, I put it back in the pot for a few minutes.  It had a lot of flavor and the whole family loved it.

I won't make this again.  It was sickeningly salty.  I ended up tossing it out.  And IF I should ever change my mind, I will NOT use regular taco seasoning, I'd suggest using Mrs. Dash Salt FREE Taco Seasoning.  And no, it wasn't the chicken broth. The one I use is only 20mg of sodium per 1 cup serving.

I cut the recipe down to 2 chicken breasts, 1 teaspoon of taco seasoning, 1/2 cup of salsa and 3/4 cup of water, for just my husband and I.
 I found it too salty, for my taste, with chicken broth. Very easy, quick dinner.

This was so quick and easy, and my picky family loved it!  I got home late, threw FROZEN chicken in the instant pot, and in 30 minutes we were eating yummy chicken burritos.  Oh my goodness, you have to try this.

I made these for my family and they all ranked these tacos a 4-4.5. I made the recipe pretty much as written, I had 2lbs of chicken so doubled the salsa but not the taco seasoning or water.  This recipe is similar to one I make in the crockpot but it is so much quicker! Perfect for a healthy dinner on nights my daughter has practice for my taco loving boys.

Easy, tasty, and quick! I didn't use frozen chicken - can't really understand why the recipe called "frozen".

I made this and. It was sugessted to elevate the chicken.  I did just that the chicken was great! But I did not put enough sauce is the bottom. The sauce burnt. I am positive I will double the salsa and broth next time. I scrapped enough out to flavor the chicken. It was a hit in burritos anyway!

This would be a great recipe with a couple changes. I followed the recipe exactly except for using about 1.5 pounds of chicken. I didn't have the problem some reviewers had getting a BURN signal. Some reviewers added extra broth and this was one of my issues. I had way too much liquid and the salsa got watered down. My first-night tacos were very blah. I made enchiladas the next night but added more salsa before reheating (and after pouring off extra juice). This helped a great deal. The chicken still needed more seasoning--perhaps more taco seasoning or a spicier salsa. I did use the suggestion of one reviewer to shred the cooked chicken using a hand mixer. This worked great!
