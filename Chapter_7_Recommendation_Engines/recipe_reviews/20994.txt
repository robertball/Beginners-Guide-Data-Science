Loved this, but changed it significantly.  Used whole wheat couscous instead of rice.  Left out the tofu, and added spinach and feta cheese.  Didn't microwave the peppers so they stayed crunchy, brushed oil over them before baking.  Used green, yellow and red peppers, all were delicious.  This is going into our frequent rotation of meals, it was so delicious!

This was a great recipe to work with. Since I made changes, I don't know if I am at liberty to give it a five, but I did. Since my family would not want to be eating an entire green pepper, I made these into stuffed cabbage. I sauted a finely chopped green pepper, onion and garlic. Then I added the soy sauce, wine and Worcestershire sauce. I increased the wine and soy sauce to 1/4 cup. I did not use the cranberries or pecans due to family preferences, however, I think they would be a great addition. I rolled the mixture in cabbage leaves and poured the tomato sauce on top and baked at 350 degrees for about an hour. They were very good. I had leftover mixture and it is great all by itself. All in all, a tasty recipe no matter how you prepare it. Update: I have since made these exactly as the recipe is written (except increasing the soy sauce and sherry by an extra tablespoon each) and they are my favorite Vegetarian Stuffed Pepper!!! Love them!!!

We were in the mood for Stuffed Peppers and this recipe looked good.  We didn't have any dried cranberries or pecans on hand, so I substituted them with raisins and walnuts, which tasted great.  Lots of interesting textures/flavors!  My husband raved at how nice the filling was and that it seemed "meaty."  I will likely be making this recipe again.  Thanks!

This was really yummy! I baked the green peppers face down for about 25 min before stuffing them and putting them back in.  I also added cumin to the mixture.  I did not use the sherry, I didnt have any and wasnt going to buy some since I never use it.  I did add the chopped pecans which were really good, I was going to add some raisens but SOMEBODY ate them so I didn't have any left.  :)  Overall very good and will definately make this again.  Its also really good reheated as left overs.

Excellent Dish. I was a little concerned about it tasting rather bland though it came out amazing. The cranberries and pecans gave it a great accent.  I was a little confused by the directions. I wasn't sure if it meant to put a 1/2 in of water insider the peppers and microwave or put a 1/2 in of water in the bottom of the dish and place the peppers into the dish. I choose to put the water in the dish and then the peppers in.  The other thing I wasn't sure by the directions was how small to chop the tofu before placing it in with the soy sauce, wine, worcestershire sauce. I looked up another tofu stuffed pepper recipe online that called for dicing the tofu and decided to go that way which worked perfect.

Didn't like it at all.  I'm not sure what made me think this would be good.. While I was making it I couln't stop telling myself what a bizarre recipe it is.

Very tasty! One of the best 'stuffed pepper' recipes I've tried... Great marinate/ saute for tofu, which I'll use again for other purposes too! I used 'Dragonfly's Bulk Dry Uncheese Mix' (from vegweb.com) instead of parmesan, added some parsley to the stuffing for color (fresh basil would be good too), & changed the cooking strategy a little, but followed the recipe otherwise. I treated it as a make-ahead casserole: microwave-steamed the peppers 6 min, mixed up the stuffing, stuffed the peppers, topped 'em with the tomato sauce mixture, then covered & refrigerated overnight. Baked it, covered, 20 min at 350; uncovered it for another 10... delicious! A little bulky to eat; may experiment with stuffed zuchini next... or maybe *quartered* peppers... this would make a really pretty holiday casserole, with red/ yellow/ green bell quarters stuffed & topped w/ fresh herbs.... hmmm... anyway: YUMMY! thanks for sharing this delicious recipe!! I'll definitely make it again! :-)

This turned out great! I made this and froze it so that I could pop it in the oven another day. Since it was frozen, it had to bake quite a bit longer (about 1 hr 15 min total). I like the way the rice got crunchy while baking. I sprinkled with cheese instead of the tomato sauce.

Made this recipe for meat-eaters and veggies alike. For the meaties I added ground beef in three peppers; tofu mix in five other peppers for the veggies. I honestly liked the brown rice mixture better on its own than inside the peppers. Perhaps my huge organic ones were too thick and still very crisp. I'd increase the amount of sauce and maybe layer some sauce while stuffing the peppers. Might increase the amount of cranberries next time as well.

Absolutely delicious! Very healthy and easy to make. I cut this recipe in half since I was only cooking for two people. Give this recipe a try! You will not be disappointed. =)

This was SO delish, even my carnivore fiance loved it!  I bought some huge organic green peppers and cut them in half length-wise.  It was plenty for one person.  I also added some water on the cookie-sheet towards to end of cooking as to not make burn marks on the pepper.

This was delicious w/ a very unique flavo!.  Some changesI made:  I made more Worcester sauce/sherry/soy sauce than called for in the recipe.  Also I splashed some worc sauce/sherry/soy sauce in the fully mixed stuffing, to make it more flavorful & help keep the green pepper moist.  I didn't have pecans, so i used walnuts.  After I filled the peppers, I rubbed the outside of the pepper with a little olive oil, and dabbed some on the top of the stuffing, figured it might help keep the pepper & stuffing from drying out too much.  Oh, and I microwaved for 4 minutes (not 6), as I didn't want the peppers to get overcooked/limpy.  I agree with the reviews who said that the tomato sauce should be skipped.  It didn't taste bad, it's just that the stuffing tastes so good by itself, that the tomato sauce detracts/masks the yummy flavors inside the green pepper. Next time i will not bother to make the sauce at all.  Although I might add an extra little sprinkling of cheese (either Parmesan or Mozzerella) on top next time, and see how that tastes.  Somehow, I ended up with not enough stuffing to fill all the peppers?  Maybe my peppers were too large.  I also had to figure out something to do with the extra tofu (which by the way, I pressed for a half an hour to get excess water out) since my tofu package was larger than what was called for.   All in all, a recipe that I will definitely make again, and the best tasting stuffed pepper recipe that i have ever eaten.  Thanks for the recipe!

I really enjoyed the recipe as written, but can only give 4 out of 5 for these reasons:  1) doesn't say what to do with the tofu, you could probably use firm silken, which might be better  2) not enough tomato sauce   I would almost double the amount of sauce, mix it in with the rice AND put it on top.   BTW... I just used a can of unsalted tomato sauce and it added the perfect amount of flavor.   I love this recipe other than what is stated above... It will be added to my go to recipe book :)

I made these yesterday as part of our family Christmas meal for my vegetarian sister in law. They were fantastic!! I made changes out of necessity alone...I used cashews in place of pecans, omitted the tofu and sherry as I didn't have any, added an onion and a clove of garlic...which I fried a bit first in oil before adding the soy and worshestire sauces. I used brown minute rice made with veggie broth due to time constraints. End result was incredible!!! A keeper! Thanks for sharing :)

Fantastic recipe, we made it with the tomato sauce on some and a slice of swiss on others. The Swiss won! When I make it again I will eliminate the sauce and just use Swiss. Also not being vegetarians we used chicken instead of tofu and still wonderful!

Yum! I used 6 red, orange and yellow peppers (I hate green ones). They were tiny little things so I had a lot of left over filling which I will use again soon although I don't know for what. Next time i might throw in some extra cranberries and pecans. Also, I think I will put some of the tomato sauce in the filling mixture instead of spooning on top. Very good all in all :) And a little note about measuring... for the tofu, use one box cubed tofu drained... and 1 large can of tomato sauce = about 3 cups.

This was a great base recipe. I drained the tofu the night before (using a heavy pan to press all the water out) and then marinated it in vegie stock overnight then cooked the tofu exactly as described in the recipe. I used 1 cup quinoa instead of the rice (and only used half of that when it was cooked). Used yellow, red and orange peppers instead of green. I didn't have tomato sauce so I used a small can of diced tomatoes with a dash of white sugar (maybe 1/4 tsp) and a pinch of basil. I know, lots of samll changes but the technique and base recipe is right on! My other half who doesn't even like peppers ate the whole thing and said we have to have it again! Thanks for the recipe :)

My husband and I loved it.
There were a few differences we made, however.
We used quinoa that we pre-cooked in vegetable broth, which made adding any more salt unnecessary. 
Also, I'm allergic to pecans, so we used crushed almonds--and it was fantastic! 
Will absolutely make this again.

Pretty good. Flavor was a little odd, and our family thought it was too sweet. May skip the cranberries next time and add more cheese.

This was FABULOUS! I wanted to make it exactly like the recipe, but did use a mixture of brown and wild rice which  I think was delicious, and used soy cheese instead of parmesan. Also, I mixed 1/2 the tomato sauce with the rice mixture and put the rest on top. It would have been just as good without any sauce at all. Oh, and I used a mixture of red, green and yellow peppers. Had some rice mixture left over, and made a tiny "meatloaf" out of it.

I enjoyed these very much.  I did add a bit of Italian seasoning and garlic to the sauce.  Next time I will also put a bit more soy sauce in but it was great as is.

These are different and good. I particularly liked the pecans in the stuffing and the brown rice was good too. I would have liked the stuffing to be more moist, so next time I would either mix in some tomato sauce with the filling or add some veggie broth. Also, some black beans would have been a nice addition. The flavour that the tofu had was really good. Thanks!

OMIT BROWN SUGAR. This dish has a marvelous mix of flavors and the brown sugar really messes it up.

I made this for my father and I one night, and followed the recipe exactly. Neither one of us liked it. The more we ate them, the more offensive they became. Im not sure what it was exactly (we think it was the sherry) but something tasted off. I'm very surprised at the good reviews. I will not even try to doctor this one up. just not worth it.

The only thing I didn't love in this recipe was the tofu.  That could be because I'm not very good at cooking it yet, but I don't think I liked the soy sauce, sherry, Worcestershire combo.  Everything else was fantastic though!  I especially liked the textures that the pecans & dried cranberries added.

This dish was really good, I just didn't think the tomato sauce went well with the cranberries at all.  I would make this but omit the tomato sauce, it doesn't really need it.

Followed directions exactly using large red peppers.  Did not add additional salt although I did season with pepper Quick and Easy, especially if your use the frozen microwaveable brown rice, It's Ready in minutes and it speeds up prep time. Hubby liked them as well so we will be making them again.

The husband and I loved these.  It was my first time making stuffed peppers, these were easy and fantastic.  I had to substitute walnuts and raisins, because that what was in the pantry, but otherwise followed the recipe word for word.  I will be making these again soon.

These were unbelievably delicious.  They were even better as leftovers the next day.  The only change I made was to use spinach (1 pkg of chopped frozen) instead of the tofu due to allergies.  I would make this again and again.  It was also very filling.

Very good but a little bland on first try.  Combined some other suggestions and think that adding more soy/wine/worst mixture, more cranberries, and alternately using couscous instead of rice are great options for flavor.  Definitely a keeper!

These were good and they had potential, but not a do-over.  Liked it better without the sauce (dried cranberries don't usually go good with tomato sauce I figured out).

I absolutely loved this recipe! Although there was quite a bit of changes I had to make when it came to meat and sauce but it was fantastic. The sweet taste of the cranberries with the green pepper was weirdly incredible. But I would not microwave the pepper as long because it came out a little soggy and I like crunchy.

Stuffed peppers have always been a favorite of mine, so was excited to try this vegetarian version. The tofu had me a little iffy, I don't like the texture, but dicing it and mixing it in with the rice made it perfect. I used meatless spaghetti sauce to top it. Very tasty! I froze left overs in individual bags, makes it easy for me to take for lunch, it microwaved well reheating it.

This recipe is a good starting point!  I'm glad to have made a dent in my abundant harvest of peppers!  I used whole wheat berries instead of rice, and substituted a few other things, but I like the idea of the cranberries and nuts.  It's delicious.  Thank you.

Beautiful. Just beautiful. The only thing I did differently was to add shredded pepper jack cheese on top of the tomato sauce mixture and melt in the oven. I loved the addition of sweetness (in the tomato sauce and with the cranberries). It was amazing. I'll be making this again. Thank you for sharing!

I made it two weeks ago. My mouth is still watering for it. I'm making it again this weekend for guests. It's exceptionally delicious. I made it as is and the leftovers were just as good. O.M.G. And i'm not even a vegetarian. Also, it's very hearty. Perfect all on its own.

"Wow!" is all I can say! The only change I made was to use vegetarian "beef crumbles" instead of tofu. All together this recipe blew my mind! The flavors were exceptional together. The funny thing is that I'm not big on bell peppers, but I thought I'd give it a whirl. Kudos for an excellent, fun, easy recipe. Note: my kids only ate the mixture out, not the peppers, but that's still awesome!

Amazing recipe!  The only thing I did differently is the method I used to pre-cook the peppers: I boiled them in water for about 8-10 minutes instead of microwaving.  Also, I used instant brown rice (much easier and faster).  I served these with peanut butter mashed potatoes and the two complimented each other perfectly.  You HAVE to try this recipe!

This is the best recipe I could find on the internet that's without meat - and that I could modify to our taste - great starting point, as it has all the basics. I omitted tofu, sherry, brown sugar. I replaced cranberries with raisins, pecans with cashews (what I had on hand). I added chopped green onion and 1 finely diced chili. I also added the tomato sauce to the rice mixture to keep it moist, and topped with parmesan. What a delicious result!

Great recipe; I left out the nuts and the sherry but it still came out nice. The cranberries were an unexpected but delicious touch. The only thing I didn't like was that the peppers weren't as crisp as I like them, but that's my personal preference and no fault of the author's

I think this recipe is great. I made a couple of very minor changes; left out the sherry and I added some of the tomato sauce mixture to the stuffing before baking to make it a bit more moist. Used red peppers and they were just a bit crisp-tender, just the way I like them!

Wow, this is great.  I didn't miss the meat at all.  I used walnuts instead of pecans, white japanese rice instead of brown, and shredded parm instead of grated.  I cooked the diced tofu in the sauce, but also cooked the cranberries, and nuts in the sauce.  I added green onions and diced tomatoes to the stuffing mix as it cooked in the sauce. Afterward, I stirred in white rice and shredded parmesean.  Instead of using tomato sauce, I pureed more of the diced tomatoes in a food processor and spooned them on top.  I sprinkled w/ shredded parmesean on top before baking.  I found there was no need to wait for the stuffing mix to cool before loading up the microwaved peppers.  They were great and easy!  I served them with sesame green beans and peanut butter noodles.  Everyone loved it!  No one missed meat.

My husband and I really liked this. I added a can of diced tomatoes to the rice and omitted the cranberries. Also just used Hunts tomato sauce on top ( no added sugar). Can’t wait to make this one again in our quest for meatless dishes that don’t feel like rabbit food!

It was really good! I substituted the cranberries pecans and brown rice with raisins chickpeas and white rice. I forgot to add salt, pepper, and cheese, but the tomato sauce covered up my mistakes. Next time I'll probably increase the amount of sauce for the tofu to get a sharper contrast between sour and sweet.

I have never  cooked with tofu but would like to have alternatives to eating meat at every dinner. My family really liked this recipe, it had so much flavor! I wasn't sure about the dried cranberries so I used fewer than what was called for. Other than that , exactly as written. Delicious!!

I used red peppers because I think they’re sweeter than the green. Also I covered them in the oven with aluminum and left the dish for another 10 mins   
Great success and will definitely make it again!
Thanks Allrecipes!

Absolutely delicious!  I did not have Worcestershire sauce so I substituted rice wine vinegar and Tahini sauce and it worked out great.  I would put less brown sugar in the tomato sauce as it was a bit too sweet.  I will definitely make it again.  My boyfriend is a vegetarian and he loved it!!!!

Did not add tofu....& may even use a vegetarian meatball next time (I don't care for the meatless crumbles). Will also come up with other veggies to stuff in the pepper. I loved stuffed peppers & the cranberries & nuts really drew me in!

It is a good base for a vegan dinner but could have used some herbs, spices, and  sautéed onion. Loved the cranberries. I used pistachios because that's what I had. Sprinkled a little Colby Jack cheese to add some flavor. Will make it again because I want to add some of those extras I mentioned.

These were so good.  There are so many options to making the recipe appeal to personal taste.  I added spinach and mushrooms to the rest of the ingredients for dinner tonight.  Next time I think a little corn would be a good addition.  My husband loved the sauce.

I absolutely loved these. As the cook in a vegetarian family, I'm always looking for [easy] ways to make tofu more interesting. Takes a lot of creativity to come up with these weird ingredients to stuff a pepper with, but it works! I roasted the peppers (yellow and red) first, and everything came out crunchy and flavorful. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a very healthy vegetarian dish, but it's really lacking in flavor. The cranberries are an excellent touch, but I'd consider doing something else with a crunch besides pecans. I ended up putting hot sauce on mine and it was okay that way.

I wasn't sure what to do w/ the tofu, so I diced it and then added it to the sherry/soy sauce.  I used batsmati rice instead of brown.  I cut my green peps in half lengthwise and then simmered them for one minute/side before filling them.  I added a touch of cinnamon and black pepper to the tomato sauce.  The first day they were fine, not bad but nothing amazing.  The second day, reheated, they were much better- I also mashed my rice with the sauce the second day.  I think mixing the sauce w/ the rice before stuffing might help some?  It's a good, filling, vegetarian meal that let me feel guilt free after Xmas dinner.  I will make 'em again.

This was quite tasty. I was making it for my fiance, who is a meat kind of guy, so I substituted sausage for the tofu with yummy results. I also added a touch of cinnamon to both the stuffing and the sauce. Yum!

Great recipe. I used a box of mushroom flavored rice instead and added half a can of stewed tomatoes to the mix and the other half of the tomatoes to the sauce. The husband loved it.
