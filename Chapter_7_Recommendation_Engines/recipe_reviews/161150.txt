Good sauce. Took about 10mins to thicken up after adding the stock. I finished it with a splash of cream instead of the butter.

This was an emergency whip up and then I realized I was out of port wine!  So I checked the booze cabinet, turned upa bottle of madeira, so I ended up making madeira sauce and just lighted up a little on the dijon.  It was very good.  I always like to have some quick and easy sauce recipes in my back pocket, to add some life to boring old grilled chicken or pork.  This definitely will stay in my recipe box.

I wanted a sauce for lamb chops.  Normally, I would grill the chops and serve plain, but I wanted some extra flavor. This was unbelievable.  I didn't measure the mustard, but it was much less than the 1/4 cup called for - I wanted to insure I tasted the port with the lamb, and didn't want an overwhelming mustard flavor.  Other than that, kept everything the same.  It was yummy! Served with seared lamb chops, smashed potatoes, and steamed cauliflower.

I was searching the web site for a topper to our grilled steaks.  Came across this gem.  I didn't have port wine so I used dry white wine.  I think any kind of wine will do.  Next time, I'm going to reduce the mustard in half.  This would also go great on top of mashed potatoes.  Thanks for this keeper!

Excellent, but had to add maybe 1/4 cup cream to this to make it extra good. Easy and delicious!
