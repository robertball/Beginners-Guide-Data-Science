These were delicious!!!  I saw no reviews or stars on it and happy to be the first one since all three words of this recipe are my favorite!  I sub the white sugar for confectionares’ sugar at same quantity and came out perfect. I didn’t have molds to make “flower” cookies so I made them little balls at first.  Soon I discovered that cream cheese doesn’t expand and the cookies stayed balls.  So next batch I flattened out the “balls” and looked like cookies.  I did this recipe as prescribed and made 1” balls and got about 5 dozen.  I added green food coloring, too, since I am giving them for Christmas.  I planned to add sprinkles at the end, but dough too hard or well baked to allow for sprinkles.  Cookies taste like an actual lemon cheesecake!  Nom-nom-nom-nom?? delicious!!!!
