This was easy and delicious. My only suggestion is that since it is very fattening that you cut back on the amount of butter, oil, and half and half that the recipe calls for.  I will definately fix this again.

This is SO good! I did make some substitutions. I used Old Bay seasoning, as others had suggested and I sauteed the garlic and mushrooms in coconut oil instead of butter and olive oil. I also used cream cheese instead of half and half. Awesome. Thanks!

I made this for the second time tonight & I just want more people to know about it.  It is wonderful!  My kids are picky & they love it!  It's like something you'd get in a fancy restaurant.  This time, I did cut the butter & oil by half.  It was just as yummy!

I think this is a 5 star recipe. My changes: I added a can of diceed roasted tomatoes and decreased the amount of butter, added a couple teaspoons of CAjun seasoning. I served it with linguine beside a seared salmon filet...very good :)

This is wonderful and very, very easy! To make it healthier, I used fat free half and half, and half of the amount of fat (and used light butter). I mixed it with whole wheat pasta and loved it! The sauce is not very think, but we liked it like that. Oh, and an extra clove of garlig was perfect.

I made this for dinner tonight and LOVED it!  My husband gave it a "10"!!  I didn't do anything different except for adding an extra clove of garlic and eliminated the mushrooms (personal preference). I also reduced the butter to 1/4 cup and it was fine.  I had to use about a tablespoon of corn starch to thicken the sauce.  Will make again for sure. Thanks for a delicious and quick recipe :-)  UPDATE...Ive made this many times and it has become one of our favorites.  I finally tried it with fat free 1/2 & 1/2, and it is just as delicious!

I added cajun seasoning and cut down on the oil and butter. This recipe is really good but I actually liked it better the second day when the sauce had thickened up a bit.

This is easy and delicious!  Perfect for a busy mom.  My DH loved and we "argued" over who got the last serving. (I won.) This is definately going into our favorites.  I did add a few cajun spices as DH loves his food spicy.

Delicious!!! Thanks to all of you who suggested halving the butter. As it was it was plenty rich. My husband loved this dish, and so did I - I agree with Steff T that it looks fancy like a restaraunt dish! I had to thicken the sauce a little, as many of you did. With the suggested alterations, definately a five-star recipe!

This was a really tasty dish, even without Cajun seasoning.  It could really use something to thicken up the sauce though, since the half-and-half stayed runny throughout the cooking process.  All my parmesan ended up clumping too, so I'd probably sprinkle it on top after plating instead of mixing it in.  Very easy to make, though, and you can use fat free half-and-half for a low-fat dish that still tastes rich.

This recipe is so quick and easy and yummy tasting.  My husband insists I make it at least once a week now.  This crawfish mixture is even good without the linguine.  The second time I made it I added shrimp and drenched it over baked fish and rice.  Yummy!

Very tasty--used vermicelli.  Decreased butter to 2 TBSP, used 3 cloves garlic (love it!), and used 1 can mushrooms--that's all I had.  Didn't have quite a full 1/2 cup of green onions, so minced a shallot in addition to them.  It seemed a little dry, so I added about 1/2 cup white wine.  As per the other reviews, I used 2 1/2 tsp. Creole seasoning (Emeril's Essence--without salt--the recipe is on food network website).  If you combine the pasta with the sauce & let it sit about 30 minutes, the pasta will absorb the sauce and won't need any kind of thickening.  Wonderful!  Thanks for a good basic recipe!

This was a great, simple dish. We substitued the crayfish tails for a mixture of prawns, clams and mussels and added a dash of white wine - very tasty.

Delicious & easy.  I didn't have half and half so I substituted evaporated milk.  I think I'll cut down on the butter next time.

Excellent and quick to prepare. I did not have half and half so I added milk and a little Wondra to thicken the sauce. Added fresh corn cut off the cob and some steamed clams. Delicious!!!!

This was incredible.  If I could give it a 4.5, I would.  The only comlaints that I had were that it was not quite thick enough of a consistancy for my taste, and I had to add a bit more cajun seasoning to give it a spicier flavor.  Otherwise, this was wonderful!  I will definitely make this again. I also added some squid and shrimp to the sauce, which turned out quite well.

My only complaint is that i had to add some cajun seasoning to it so that it took on a heavier cajun taste, which is what i was looking for in the dish.  Went well with a california riesling.

This was delicious. I live in Louisiana and have had my share of seafood pastas and this recipe is right up there. I halved the butter and oil and used fat free half & half and it was still fabulous. My kids ate it up, even my 6-yr-old. I suggest adding some Tony's orther Cajun seasoing instead of salt & pepper.

We were pretty impressed with this recipe.  I agree that it is restaurant quality!  The only change that I made is I cut back on the butter (and used light) and I also added about a can of diced tomatoes because I just love tomatoes with everything!  We enjoyed it very much!

I really loved this!  BUT...I cut the butter in half and had to thicken the sauce, just stayed a little too watery...also cut out the green onions.  Loved the parsley in it!  I have made this about 3 times now and my kids love it...I love it...

It was good, but missing a little something. A few dashes of Worcestershire sauce, maybe? I did add a little Old Bay, as others suggested, but I wasn't crazy about the flavor of it in a cream sauce.

Easy to prepare but bland. If I make it again it will be with a lot more seasoning.

REALLY TASTY!! I broke one of rules and modified the original before making it the first time - BUT, to my defense, this was very similar to a recipe I had years ago but lost. I was glad to find this one to use as a starting point. I added 1 TBSP Cajun seasoning, reduced the butter by half, and added a bit of corn starch to thicken the sauce. Next time I will wait until the sauce begins to thicken before adding the crawfish so they don't cook down as much. Overall a really tasty meal.

I made this recipe because my husband and I had a lot of leftover crawfish from a crawfish boil the weekend before. It was SO easy to make and tasted DELICIOUS! I made it exactly according to the recipe. Next time I would probably cut the fat drastically, and try it with fat free half and half. But this got my husband's approval, which is not easy to do! This would also be great with shrimp or chicken too!
