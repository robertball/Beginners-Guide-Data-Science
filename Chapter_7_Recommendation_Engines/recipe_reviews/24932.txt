As an avid cook and baker who has spent way too much time looking for a good beer bread recipe, I found this beer bread to be the best of what I have made from several different recipes in the past. It was moist, but not too moist. It was tender and flavorful with a nice outside crust layer. I am not a drinker; however, I used Budweiser beer as it is the only beer I will use to cook with; what a rich and wonderful match with the wheat flour, and so easy to prepare. I did mix the recipe in my Kitchenaid stand mixer; its appearance was simply gorgeous. This is a definite keeper!

This bread is delicious. I made a few changes to the original recipe. I added 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese to the batter. I also took another persons advice and melted butter to pour over top of bread before baking. I added a little salt, pepper and some Mrs. Dash Garlic and herb seasoning in the butter before I poured it on the bread. Next time I may add the Mrs. Dash right in the batter. There isn't any salt in it so you could probably use as little or as much as you'd like. I would make this recipe again for sure.

Very attractive, rustic looking bread that betrays the minimal effort that went into it. Surprisingly delicious, and I'm looking forward to making it again with variations--dill and a handful of shredded Cheddar cheese, or maybe herbs or Italian seasoning. It was a tasty acccompaniment to the Creamy Chicken and Wild Rice Soup. However, both my friend and I thought it was a little on the salty side, so I think next time I'll reduce the salt to 1 tsp., and use 1/4 cup of UNsalted melted butter over the top rather than salted. All in all, a lovely bread I'll be happy to make again, and not just because it's easy and produces a loaf of bread in under an hour. Great recipe, and a pleasant surprise!

Great recipe! I didn't alter a thing other than adding a few tablespoons of melted butter on top before baking as others suggested. I used a bottle of ale (Portland Ale) with great results. I am thinking of packaging the dry mix, putting it in a loaf pan w/ a bottle of beer and giving as christmas gifts this year. Would make a great hostess gift, too!

there is nothing i can add to the other reviews except to say that after the first loaf came out and cooled, cut off a slice and as soon as i get off this thing i'm mixing up another loaf so there will be some left for the fish sandwiches that i intended it to accompany in the first place. this one needs six stars B.L.

Very easy, very good.  I added 1/4 of melted butter on top of the batter before baking (a trick I picked up from another beer bread recipe).  You can add up to 1/2 a cup if you like, but use real butter!  YUM!

I cannot believe this is a quick bread. Smell while baking is incredible, texture is awesome, and end result is super tasty. All I had was Heineken light, but I can't wait to make this with a Guinness. Mmm. Did add the melted butter, since almost every other reviewer did; probly about 1/4 cup. UPDATE: Made this again, this time a half batch. A half batch is a little too much for my mini loaf pan! Took about 40 minutes to bake.

I've made this three times and I suggest you DO NOT use 4 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder; use 3 teaspoons.  I did some research and looked at other recipes and most recipes that don't use self-rising flour call for 1 teaspoon of baking powder for every 1 cup of flour.  When I used 4 1/2 teaspoons the bread had a very distinct, bitter aftertaste.  This is a great bread with the baking powder modification.  Also, I pour 2 Tablespoons of melted butter on top 10 minutes before it's done baking.

Excellent! I used Budweiser brought to room temperature. I added 1 cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese. Mixed everything in my KitchenAid mixer; it was sticky but did well. I poured 1/2 cup of melted, salted butter over the top prior to baking. Baked for 55 minutes. This turned out beautifully with a chewy crust.

What more can you say about a bread that is delicious and takes very little prep time?!  The only change I made was to melt 1/2 stick of margarine and pour it over the unbaked bread dough.  The butter gave the crust a very rich and crunchy texture.  I've made this several times because of its ease in putting it together.  Thanks, BLChrisman!

I read that there were several people who thought this recipie tasted to "Beery" well I just wanted to share that you can make this with ginger ale or sprite if you would like. It will make the bread sweeter though. But I prefer my beer bread made with the ginger ale. Hope this helps!

5 stars all the way. It's easy, it's tasty, it's versatile and it's wheat! We usually use Pyramid Apricot Ale. It gives this bread a delightfully fruity flavor. Even my kids love this bread. I have also used Pumkpkin Spice Ale (available in Fall and a different brand than Pyramid) with good flavor results. We usually use some sort of ale but in a pinch have used beer. Using beer results in a very strong beer flavor- if that is what you are going for- use your favorite beer! We prefer the Ales, they seem to not only impart the beer-y flavor but notes of whatever Ale you picked up. I have also used ALL whole wheat before, although more dense just as tasty! We also like to pour a couple tablespoons melted butter down the top before baking. mmm!

We loved this bread!  I was concerned about the bitter taste that other reviewers had experienced, but used a mild tasting beer and it came out tasting beautifully!  I added a little more brown sugar, 1 Tb honey and poured 1/4 c. melted butter over the batter before baking.  It had no ill aftertaste from the baking powder and I used the full amount of Clabber Girl.

Dh and I LOVED this bread!!!!  So easy and perfect with a bowl of homemade soup.  I will make this often.  I thought it was great plain or with a little butter, & my kiddos ate theirs with a drizzle of honey.  Dense, moist and not overly sweet...plus, I had all of the ingredients!!  Can't wait to try it again with a steaming bowl of stew.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

What a great recipe!  And to think, people pay around $6 for the pre-made beer bread mix.  I think this tastes much better than beer bread I've tasted made from a mix.  I've made this twice now.  You can vary the ratio of whole wheat and white flour to suit your taste, just make sure the total is 3cups of flour.  I recommend melting 1/4c. to 1/3c. butter and pouring over the top BEFORE baking.  This bread keeps well for several days, wrapped tightly(if it lasts that long).  When I made it for guests, I broke it up into chunks and served it with dill dip as an appetizer- delicious!!!UPDATE - for people who think this has a bad aftertaste, try using ALUMINUM-FREE BAKING POWDER (Rumsford brand is good).  The aluminum in most baking powders probably would leave an aftertaste with 4.5 teaspoons!

Mine didn't turn out very well. There's a few things that I may have not done right. I think maybe the beer had something to do with it?  And also I used baking soda instead of baking powder. Next time I will use baking powder or make my own with equal parts baking soda and cream of tartar.

dh (a.k.a. the beer snob as I call him) recommended New Castle Brown Ale to accent the flour in the bread (this coming from someone who only eats frozen food if I'm not home) anyway, the bread came out great!  I made 3 breads the first time, then changed the brown sugar to a semi-packed 1/2 cup for the next 3 beers and it was PERFECT! So similar to Tastefully Simple wheat beer bread!  Tomorrow I'm picking up a 6 pack of Harvest Moon Pumpkin Ale for a great fall beer bread and still plan to keep the brown sugar at 1/2 semi packed, can't wait!

Wow! I just made this tonight to go with one of my favorite Julia Child recipes for beer braised beef. So I used the same beer for the beef and the bread (Shiner Bock). I took some previous advice and only used a scant Tbsp of baking powder and also poured 2 tbsps melted butter over the top. Plus I used white whole wheat instead of regular ww, and for sweetening, 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup molasses. I expected it to have more of a muffin texture, but it really did come out more like a yeast bread (I didn't knead it at all - stirred only to moisten throughout). The whole family loved it, even the pickiest ones - not a crumb left. We drank the shiner with the meal and it was just wonderful.

I would give this more stars if I could!. I have been making recipes off of websites for years without rating them,I just HAD to rate this one! I used all purpose flour because I didn't have any whole wheat, I cut the salt by half as reviewers had suggested. I used dos exis beer, and very old expired baking powder because that was all my bf had. Poured 2 Tablespoons of melted butter on top ONLY, it totally covered it. I was very skeptical about the results. I was soooo wrong in an extremely yummy way! My boyfriend and I ate it hot right out of the oven! Made some more the next day because it didn't last. The consistency of the bread was as of zuchini or banana bread when hot and it was crusty on top. It was great! had it with butter and honey. Next time will cut out the suger, and try rosemary and olive oil!- thanks Blchrisman for this wonderful recipe. I am officially addicted!

This is a fairly good beer bread recipe, and I read most of the reviews here before I tried it.  The texture and finish of my loaf was good... the top crust was a little crunchy even though I added melted butter before putting it in the oven.  The taste of the finished loaf was slightly salty/bitter, but it would work well with soups and chilis for sure.  The beer choice for this recipe will have a profound impact on the flavor, especially if bitterness is an issue.  I chose to use Alleycat Amber Ale from The Lost Coast Brewery & Cafe in my recipe.  This beer only has a very slight hop bitterness to it, and I didn't think it would be enough to translate into the bread flavor, but it could have.  I'm going to modify this recipe and try it again.  I'm not very happy with the suggested 4.5 teaspoons of baking powder.  That could be another source of bitterness.  I think I may make this again with self-rising flour in place of the all-purpose flour with the added baking powder and salt.  I really think this would make a better bread...

Update: January 3, 2009

I made another loaf of this bread today.  I replaced the all-purpose flour, salt, and baking power with just 1 1/2 cups of self-rising flour and the bread tastes MUCH better.  On the nit-pick level, if you choose to modify the recipe this way, you might want to add no more than 1/2 teaspoon of salt.  I also added 1 cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese.  The results are delicious :)

We love this bread!!  Ihave made it twice in one week already.  I did use 1 TBS instead of 4.5 tsp of baking powder like other reviews suggested and lessened the salt to 1/2 tsp.  I used amstel light the first time and killians red the second and loved them both.  Will try pumpkin ale next! I had to come back and add that I also topped with 1/4 c melted butter before baking it, it made it very moist and the butter seeps in on top tastes great! Also, DO use aluminum free baking powder.  You can get Rumford at Walmart, or Kroger has it in the organic food shelves.  Bobs Red Mill also makes an aluminum free baking powder, most any health food store (like whole foods) will carry either of these.

What a wonderful non-yeast wheat bread!  Got my best results by using my Kitchen Aid to beat the batter and develop the gluten.  Like the results best when using full-bodied, well-flavored beer (like a micro brew).

This was a good dense bread.  It was  just a little more dense than I or my husband cared for.  I used a lager as that is what I had, but I think next time I'll use a darker, stout beer -it might give it a "richer" flavor.

I am really sorry to give a bad review, but this turned out horribly!  It was extremely bitter.  I have tried other beer bread recipes that turned out much better.  It may have been the beer I used... I used a Heineken in the fridge because I don't like them, and I didn't want to use my good beer in the recipe.  (I guess the lesson is to use a beer you like to drink.)  But I have to say, I don't think the beer can account for all of the bitter taste.  I CAN drink Heineken after all, and I could not eat this bread.

Great! I did not have whole wheat flower so I just used 3 cups of all purpose flower and my family loved it. I used Budweiser and 1/2 cup brown sugar. It was not bitter. I also added 1/4 cup melted butter to the top when I put it in the oven. I have made this bread twice, the second time I used my Kitchen Aid Mixer with the bread hook attachment and it turned out even better!

This was great, and like they say would be great with stew or soup.  I am trying to use only fresh ground wheat, so I only used 1/2 cup of bread flour.  It was great hot, haven't tried it the day after.

Served this with spinach dip. I used a 12oz. can of Sprite in place of the beer. Nice bread but was a little crumbly. I will try it with beer next time.

This was so easy to put together and we had everything on hand.  Cut the salt way down.  Really good flavor and not dry.  Crunchy crust.  Had to eat a piece still warm with butter.

I am not a baker by any means, and even I can make this.  I love it - a good hearty bread.  My favorite way to serve it is cut in cubes with sour cream and onion dip at parties.

This bread comes out fantastic every time!  I was out of brown sugar, so I made my own with white sugar and molasses.  Between the blackstrap molasses and beer, it has a great hearty, slightly sweet flavor.  I baked it in a stoneware loaf pan which made the crust tender but a little crispy.  I prefer a wheat beer over a darker lager for this bread.  It's easy to adapt with different herbs and cheeses, depending on what you're serving with it.  I blended Cheddar cheese and fresh cilantro for a Southwestern-style bread alongside chili.  another variation that works well is Asiago and Parmesan with Italian herbs.  Delicious!

Wow!!!  As another reviewer said, I also got hooked on beer bread from a Tastefully Simple party and wanted a cheaper fix. I was quite skeptical about this bread because it just seemed too simple. Well, it is definitely simple, but it one of the best beer breads I have ever had! I like dark beer, so that is what I used in the bread. Awesome flavor!  I can't overstate how good this bread is. I made it for a dinner party and everyone raved. I decided to give it as a gift at Christmas. (I posted a picture of my "gift" in the photo section of this recipe.) I got the bread pan and bags at the dollar store. I printed up gift tags on business card templates with my computer and on the back I printed the directions. In all, the whole package cost less than $4. I will be making & giving this bread for years to come!

Oh wow was this delicious! I used 2 cups organic stone ground whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup all-purpose flour. The beer I chose was a summer ale flavored with honey and orange peel. It gave the bread a nice brown color and a subtle flavor. I used my kitchen-aid mixer on low speed for about 5 mins. to mix the dough with the dough hook. I also poured about 1 Tbsp. melted butter over the top before baking. The whole kitchen smelled great while it was baking. The type of beer used in cooking really matters. Make sure it's fresh, otherwise the food will take on a "skunky" flavor. Avoid using that old bottle that's been sitting in the back of the fridge for a few months! Also, use a darker beer such as an ale or even a stout. Lighter beers that go great with wings and pizza don't work well for cooking because their flavor is so mild. I can't wait for my pasta fagioli to finish cooking so I can eat more of this bread! Love the idea of another reviewer to make this mix into a gift with a bottle of beer. I might have to do the same, thanks!!

Great bread, I'm made it several times using Heineken beer. I made four loaves as Christmas gifts, each accompanied by a small jar of honey, and got great reviews. Changes I made: *used only whole wheat flour. *reduced baking powder to 1 Tablespoon. *reduced salt to 1 teaspoon. *added melted butter to top of bread sometimes before, sometimes after cooking, and sometimes both! YUM!

This was an awesome recipe.  I used a honey brown beer.  I decreased the baking soda to 1TBS (3tsp)  and asalt to 1 tsp.  I also used 1/2cup honey instead of brown sugar.  I baked the bread for 20min and then drizzled with 3TBS melted butter and honey.  We ate it ALL in 1 day.  I have had success using whole wheat flour, white flour, and a combo of both.  I've made this bread 3 times in the past week.  So easy, yet so tasty.

Excellent Recipe!!  I added more beer to give it a stronger flavor and also so that I didn't have to knead the dough.  It came out sticky (just like an expensive packaged mix) and baked beautifully.  I cut down to 2 1/4 tsp. of baking powder and cut the brown sugar just below 1/3 cup and added a teaspoon of honey. I put 1/3 cup of melted butter before putting it in the oven.  Then 10 minutes before it was done I put another 1/3 cup of butter through the top crust and back to the oven for the remainder 10 mins.  It came out moist and delicious.  I will be making this one often and it's a definate keeper.

I did not realize that whole wheat flour could spoil.  I did notice a funny smell when I measured it, but kept going with this recipe.  The resulting bread was so bitter it was inedible.  So, word to the wise, check the whole wheat flour before using : if it has a stale, faintly sour smell, toss it!

This was really good bread- easy to make too! I love the addition of the whole wheat flour.  This was a little dry on the first day, but nothing a little butter could fix! Second day was nice and moist.  I did sub garlic salt for the regular salt and it gave a nice hint of flavor.

Great recipe. I used white sugar instead of brown, and added half a cup of flax seed meal and it turned out well. I thought that there was a little too much baking powder in the recipe (I detected a bit of that bitter baking soda flavor in every bite), but no one else who ate it thought so. Regardless, the next one I'm making has 3 teaspoons of baking soda instead of 4.5.

This was great!  I used Blue Moon and added the butter to the top (probably will use 1-2T instead of 1/4C next time).  Its an easy recipe that is delish, it would be great with any meal or snacks and it can be easily adapted.  We'll be trying it with some diced apples and cinnamon as well.  It is fantastic as written so go preheat your oven.

I love this recipe!! It is so simple and tastes great. I used all purpose flour with 1 TBL of baking powder and 1 TSP of salt. The only beer I had in the house was Miller Lite. Turned out perfect. The flavor is stronger the next day after baking. I heat up a peice in the microwave for 15 seconds and top with butter. Delicious.

A nice recipe enjoyed by the entire family.  I did reduce the salt to 1 tsp. as others had suggested.  The bread had a wonderful flavor and couldn't have been easier to make.  I would suggest serving the bread warm.  The following day the crust was rather hard and the bread texture not as tender, despite being stored in an air tight container.  A definite make again recipe....thank you!

I was not expecting this to be as good as it is!!!  Made this to accompany a roast on Christmas, as an "extra".  It is FABULOUS!  I will be making this once a week.  Would make a great hostess gift too, mix the dry ingredients in a nice container, throw in a mix of bottled brews and a pretty card with the directions!  Thanks for this new addition to my keeper recipes!

Great texture, but awful taste (I hate the taste of beer so it's not the recipe it's me...).  I made it because I was curious.  Extremely quick and easy...beer-lovers, try it!

I used some of the other suggestions and used all whole wheat flour, only 2 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp salt, and 1/3 c honey along with 1 can of Miller Lite.  I also brushed the top with melted butter.  It tasted great!  It was nice and hearty and the hint of sweetness was just enough.  The only problem was that it was a little too dense and doughy in the center.  I think I'll try adding a little more baking powder next time and bake a little longer.  Otherwise a great recipe I will definetely make again!

This bread is very good, but I made a few modifications.  The first time that I made it, I followed the directions exactly, and it was so salty and with a bad taste that we couldn't eat it.  The second time, I cut the baking powder down to 1 1/2 tsp. and the salt down to 1/2 tsp., and it was great!  I have also substituted sprite for the beer, and it comes out great!

Crazily enough,this recipe is rated higher than the plain "Beer Bread" recipe which is also on this site, but I found it to be much less pleasing.  I found that the whole wheat recipe was OK right out of the oven, but as it cooled it became more and more tough (could be because I used freshly ground whole wheat flour rather than regular bagged whole wheat flour)...I don't know, I was just looking for a great tasting beer bread so I saved both recipes and tried them both and found the regular "beer bread" to be much tastier and much easier to prepare than this whole wheat version.

Very good and very easy...it took about 5 minutes to put together and that was with a baby strapped to the front of me :) 
If I make it again I think I will cut back just slightly on the brown sugar because I thought it was on the slightly sweet side, and top with melted butter as others mentioned because the top was just a bit dry. 
I used a Lienie's Red, which gave it a nice flavor. 
Big hit with the family.

This is great - quick, easy, and tasty.  We always have it with chili.  It also makes great toast!  My 3yo and 1yo like to eat it, too.  I've had the best luck using a JW Dundee's Honey Brown Lager, but try it with different types of beer!  I usually do a little less brown sugar than it calls for, but that is just our personal preference.

This turned out absolutely wonderful!  I used all whole wheat flour, and halfway through baking, I spread butter on top of the bread. The beer I used was Shiner Bohemian Black Lager (Bought in the family pack). I also added a handful of 2% shredded cheddar cheese.  Sweet, hearty and delicious!

I followed directions exactly.  The bread turned out beautifully.  Took about 50 min to bake.  Tasted wonderful.  Next time I might try topping with butter, brown sugar, and/or oats to get an interesting crust.

I really enjoyed this bread. It's very dense, but that is to be expected without yeast and using whole wheat flour. It has great flavor. I used a large individual can of Heineken, which worked out perfectly to make two loaves. I baked them at the same time and they were done in about 55 minutes.

Delicious!  While it was baking we could hardly wait to eat it due to the yummy smell!  I followed the directions as stated, though I did add a tablespoon of melted butter on the top, like others suggested.  I had dark brown sugar at home, and I may try that next time just to see.  I also used Sharps, a non-alcoholic beer, for that's what I had in the house.  SOOOOOO good!

I love beer bread and this one was very good.  I thought this might be too sweet for us, so I cut the brown sugar down to 1/4 cup.  I wouldn’t do that again; I’d use the full amount.  It needs that extra sweetness.  I particularly like this toasted!

This was so yummy and easy to make!  I used pumpkin ale so the bread had a little bit of a pumpkin flavor to it...delicious!  I didn't have any wheat flour so I just used 3 cups of all purpose flour.  I also melted a 1/2 stick of butter and poured it on the top before baking.

So easy. I only had white flour, but turned out great anyways. All the other recipes for beer bread called for self rising flour and this didn't. That is why I choose this one.

I cannot rave enough about this bread, it is DELICIOUS and a cinch to make! The bread has a lovely sweet flavor. I used Blue Moon's "Honey Moon Summer Ale". My only change to the recipe was to use half the salt. The texture of this bread is terrific, but I think adding a little bit of oatmeal would be a good thing.  Thank you!

Delicious.  Crisp and earthy tasting.  Used 100% whole wheat flour and loved it.  Kids loved it with peanut butter spread on it.  I loved it with just some butter.

I really enjoyed this bread as did my co-workers. It's so easy to make.  I have sliced it and added butter, garlic powder and shredded cheese and melted it under the broiler.  I do cut the salt back to 1 teaspoon.  Great recipe!

YUMMY!...this taste like Great Harvest Bakery Bread (might just be local).  I used 1/2 cup old fashioned oats, 1 1/4 c each of the other.  I also used Redhook's Blonde Ale (Seattle brewery.  I sprinkled some oats on top and then poured 1/4 c melted butter on top.  I baked 50 minutes and then covered it with plasti wrap for 30 min(as someone else recommended) I believe this holds in the moisture.  I might have to leave the house so i dont polish off the rest of it...

This is a great recipe, I melted butter to put on top before baking.  I also put some flax in mine, just because I try to add flax to things you can not notice it in.  I also had made some honey/butter to spread on the bread.  This is a much better recipe than the self rising flour recipes.  Do not let your beer set to get flat, its the fiz and yeast that make the bread, just open the beer and pour.  I won't spend money on Tastfully Simple box again.

Really good and easy. Used king arthur "white" whole wheat flour for all the flour (3 cups.) Also used Heffeweizen beer. Topped with 2 tbls. melted butter and used convection toaster oven at 325 for about 35 - 40 minutes. Came out moist and flavorful. If top starts to brown too much before it is done tent a bit with aluminum foil.

I used corona. I melted 1/2 stick of butter and poured over the top of the batter and let it rest for about 30 minutes before baking.  Removed from oven and brushed just a little more butter over top and wrapped in plastic wrap for about 30 minutes.  Sliced it while still slightly warm and drizzled honey over top.  Everyone enjoyed it!

So beery good! Too easy! A tad too sweet. I'll add less sugar next time. This bread came out great and would be so good with chili, stew, soups, toasted, not toasted, with salads, with no salad, with butter, no butter...well you get my drift. Make sure to use a nice beer like an ale. My daughter didn't like this very much. She said it reminded her of recycle-the-beer-bottles day. It's very fragrant!

Excellent bread! I used Sam Adams and to make it healthier, skipped the sugar and used a half a cup of honey. Never heard of Rumsford baking powder; just used my usual brand and there was no bitterness whatsoever. Hubby loves bread with soup and this went great with our lentil soup tonight. "B.L.", due to time, I was looking for a quick and easy bread and this really did the trick. Thanks so much for a fantastic recipe!

Yummmmmmy bread.  I'm normally disappointed in beer bread, but not this time.  I generously buttered my pan and then spread a couple of tablespoons of butter on top before baking and I got a nice crisp, chewy, delicious crust.  I also changed the flour combo to 2 cups all-purpose and 1 cup whole wheat.  I also used a bottle of Tequiza for the beer.

This bread was UGLY, but good.  I used Red Dog beer and I liked the flavor, the kids liked it as well.  My son was reading the recipe & decided that since it was so easy to make, that he would make it next time.  Thanks B.L.

This bread is so easy to make.  I've taken it to two different parties and have gotten rave reviews.  I took 2 loaves to a larger party and had a taste test with two different types of beer.  Inexpensive beer seems to taste the best.

Used all all-purpose flour (didn't have any wheat flour and wanted to try this) and I used a Sam Adams Oktoberfest beer. I didn't have a loaf pan, so just formed the dough into a round pile on a baking sheet and it turned out excellent. The beer taste was strong, but good. Thank you for this recipe!!

Used splenda brown sugar and pumkick beer, did not add butter, turn out wonderful. Easily one of the best and simplest bread I have ever made. Will be trying all types of beer in it now.

This was really easy and turned out well the first time, nice crusty top.   As for beer choice:   You have to like the beer to like the bread.

Ok...this bread is great!  Super simple, quick and easy!  It also lends itself to any additions you can think of.  I used a pale ale micro brew.  I also added rosemary and shredded cheddar.  Garlic butter on top and it was amazing!

Incredibly easy and good.  I doubled and made as a loaf and in an 8" round pan.  Like so many. I reduced the salt to 1 tsp., the baking powder to 3 tsp., added 1 cup of shredded cheese, and 1 tbl. of honey.  I'm sure if you made it as written, it would be great as well

As with other new recipes, I try to decide what I will do differently the next time.  The bread looks beautiful and has the crusty top as promised because I poured butter on top. I also love the texture. However, next time I will dilute the beer with water, 8 oz. beer, 4 oz. water, to reduce the "beer-y" after-taste and also halve the brown sugar from one third cup to one sixth.  I thought it was too sweet for bread.  One reviewer thought it was too salty and I too sweet!  Just goes to show how tastes vary.  I will definitely make this again this winter when we have homemade soup.  I did enjoy a small chunk this morning, toasted with jelly.  I am keeping it in the fridge in plastic wrap.

This was a very nice quick bread. I used all whole wheat flour (because I did not have any other kind), and it came out perfectly. Soft and chewy; great with honey butter. Oh, and I used Sam Adams Boston Lager to make this. I think it would be even better with a darker beer.

I made this using Shiner Bock beer, exactly as the recipe recommends.  I may try buttering the top next time, as others have suggested, but only for color.  It came together VERY quickly, and I couldn't imagine it being any simpler to make!  This bread is mildly sweet, and goes wonderfully with butter, margarine, or honey butter.  This will be my go-to recipe for beer bread from now on.

I love this bread and have made it several times.  The only change I have made is using only half of the brown sugar and adding in some honey to sweeten it as well.  I always receive plenty of compliments when I make it!

I was craving fresh bread, and we are out of yeast. This was one of the first recipes I found, so I gave it a whirl! It was extremely easy and came out pretty tasty! I used a bottle of Leinenkugel Oktoberfest. I also went by other reviewers suggestion, and poured some melted butter on top, did it the last 10 minutes of baking. My mother, shockingly, didn't like it, and said it didn't taste like bread.. Saying it was probably the wheat flour.. Looks like I'll be eating a good amount of bread this week! I would love to make this again with a different beer every week or so.

I really like this recipe. I didn't have any all-purpose flour on hand, so I instead used 3 cups whole wheat white flour. It turned out perfectly. Very nice crust and nice soft texture inside. Thank you for sharing!

The whole family loves it.  It gives me an option for bread for dinner without having to plan to far ahead.  I used club soda instead of beer because I didn't have any beer in the house and it worked great.

I added a handful of shredded cheese, some dill and two tablespoons of butter on top. It was delicious and a nice change from my normal bread machine breads, but maybe I just prefer yeast breads in general. My husband loved it with chicken salad. Used a bottle of Irish Red leftover from a party.

I used Harps Lager for this bread and everyone loved it.  The bread has a nice crumb, and I swear that some people would never beleive it was not a yeast bread.  I also tried it with Guiness, and it was not nearly as good.

This bread turned out too salty and kind of dense for our taste.  I would use a lot less salt (I used kosher salt) next time.  I also think melted butter on the bottom of the pan and drizzled on top (make sure you use unsalted butter) will improve the taste dramatically.

Loved it!  I did find it a little sweet for my taste, so next time I'll cut the sugar a bit.  I also found it a little hard to slice, but that might have been due to my impatience to slice into it right out of the oven!

for the amount of work that goes in to this recipe (almost none) the results are fantastic. I will definitely be making it again in the future, but I will probably try adding some seeds, nuts, or something to give the bread some texture. I would also use a flavorful beer. They make so many interesting fruit and spiced varieties now the possibilities are endless.

This bread was so easy and absolutely wonderful!  I added cheese and garlic like others had suggested and used Michelob Ultra Amber and it turned out great.  I will definitely make again and try with other beers to play with the flavor.  Boyfriend tested and approved!

I was excited to try a highly rated whole wheat beer bread recipe, since I make regular beer bread frequently.  I was disappointed with the flavor of this bread - way too bitter.  The texture was terrific, and I plan on altering the recipe to add more sugar or possibly use white instead.

I absolutely love this beer bread.  I have so much trouble trying to keep myself away from it after I make it; I'll find myself eating it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner the next day!  It might seem like it needs a bit more liquid at first, but do not fear.  Just keep stirring and it will eventually all be moistened with just one bottle.  I admit, I've used expensive lagers and it's great, but I've also used Select 55 and it's still pretty darn good!  The only change I make is from a review I found on here.  Before slipping it in the oven, I melt about 1Tbsp of butter and pour it over the top.  Also, my baking time varies depending on the depth of the loaf pan I use and the oven I'm using--I'm a young adult trying to settle down, so I've made this bread in different apartments, at home, at grandma's, at fiance's house.....I make it a lot ;-].  I always start checking it around 40min with my wooden skewer or toothpick. I do like using a skewer to check breads because it goes deeper than the toothpick.

I have to give this 5 stars for the incredible easy factor of this recipe and how good it tastes.  I followed it exactly and will not make any changes at all when I make it again (and I will).  I used a summer pale ale and think I will stick with a similar beer in the future because it was perfect.  It is heavier than a yeast bread (obviously) but perfect for toast and to accompany soup, chili, etc.  Or just hot out of the oven with butter!  Yum!

So delicious and easy!  Made exactly how the recipe said and it turned out really good.  Put some honey on top after it's done baking for a little sweetness and it's even better!

Very easy and delicious!  Followed the recipe exactly.  Will try adding 2 cups whole wheat flour and only 1 cup regular next time I make it.  I'm interested to experiment with different varietites of beer.

So good!  This is the best tasting loaf of bread I think I've made so far, and definitely the easiest.  It feels sinfully easy.  My husband can't stop talking about this bread, and he's not a huge carb lover like I am.  It's got a great, sweet yeasty flavor and it's so simple it's ridiculous.  This is going to replace my old bread recipe!  I used Blue Moon Pale Ale and it was great.  Thanks!

Made this tody evening.  My first bread bake ever! The bread was very moist.  However it had a bit too much salt.  So like some of the reviewers recommended.  I will add less salt and baking powder next time I bake it.  Otherwise, it is a great receipe, one I will use over and over.  I have always wanted to make rather than buy my own bread and this is a great start.

This turned out great.  I used all whole wheat flour because I didn't have any all-purpose on hand.  I think next time I will cover the loaf for the last 10 min because it started to brown on the top.

oooh, I was at a tastefully simple party last night..and wanted their beer bread for my thanksgiving dinner tonight. However, I had to order it, and the lady did not have any on hand to sell right then and there. So..I went searching for a recipe and hit upon this one. YummO..omg, this is soooo goood! and it smells so wonderful baking. Something I'm going to try tomorrow? cream soda, with cinnamon for a breakfast bread and then drizzle some thinned buttercream frosting...I think it will be very very good.

After using Tastfully Simple mix I was bound to find something similar I could make from scratch.  Straight off, I made two loves and like the reviews, cut back the salt nut not the baking powder. The bread was HORRIBLE.  It tasted metallic.  I used Clabber Girl double acting baking poweder.  It was so bad, I spit out the first piece.  Not to be deterred, I immediately started up a single batch with half the baking powder and the loaf turned out just as good as the expensive mix.  I used Heineken and I'm not a beer drinker so stood at the beer section scratching my head, but think I'll try a wheat honey beer next time.  Anyway, with the revissions on the salt and baking powder, this is a winner!

Delicious and unbelievably easy!  Only change made was to decrease the salt from 1 1/2 tsp to 1 tsp per some other reviews. It is a great compliment to soups.

I made this recipe a long time ago with Bud light, and at the time I would have rated it a 3 1/2.  This time, I tried using Guiness Stout (not extra stout), and it improved the taste of the bread dramatically!  I used a bit more sugar than called for - a few more large lumps, and brushed the top with melted butter after baking.  Everyone raved about it!  My daughter thought this was even better than the bread a local Irish Pub-style restaurant is famous for.

This was my 1st  attempt at making any kind of beer bread.  I added fresh garlic cloves and melted butter to the top before baking.  It was an awesome addition.  I will defiently make this over and over with different spices.  It was also very simple and easy to make.

Really good. I took the advise of other reviewers and melted butter on top. I think next time I will add some cheese to the mix. I served this with curried zucchini soup and it went really well together. Fast and easy.

This was really good and so easy. I only used half a cup of white flour and the rest whole wheat because that's all I had but it was really good. I'll probably make it that way again next time. The texture was great, and it tasted wonderful.

Yummy, and so simple! I actually left out the whole wheat part and just used 3 cups of bread flour. Used the good ol' Kitchen Aid mixer with bread hook to mix, top with a little butter and bake. So easy!!!! Served it up with a little soup. Thanks for sharing!

This bread is very good! Mine turned out just like the picture posted by Minibug Mama. It is incredibly easy to make, and so fast! I used non-alcohol beer- Kaliber, and the flavor is wonderful! As others have posted, it is a tad bit sweet, so next time I will reduce the brown sugar to 1/4 cup. I also put melted butter on it before and after it baked, and wrapped it in plastic after taking it out of the oven. (Thanks Lori66). I will be making this again and again!

This bread was pretty good.  I used all whole wheat flour and a pumpkin ale.  It was so simple that I will probably try it again with some changes.  I think I will try the gingerale suggested by another reviewer and maybe a combination of flour.  It was good my way but could be improved.

I've been using this recipe for years now and it's a total hit at my house.  Shiner Bock is my beer of choice these days but Sam Adam's Summer Ale was *really* nice too.  I follow the recipe exactly, just alter the flavor with the beer used.

I made this recipe exactly as listed, I used Guinness for my beer choice.  Was moist and slightly sweet with a nice wheat bread taste.  I could definately taste the beer flavor. (Which my husband loved as he is a huge Guiness fan)  Ate it both warmed up and cold - good both ways. Choose the beer that best suits your taste and have at it!  Easy, quick and tasty.  Served it with Pot Roast and our chili recipes this week.  Yummy and the wheat flour ads a little health there too.

A great easy and quick recipe!  My sister buys a pre-packaged beer bread recipe, I'm so excited that I found an inexpensive way to make a great beer bread.  This is the second time making this in two weeks, this time I customized with italian seasoning and cheese, yum. :)

I have always liked Pampered Chef's beer bread but hated how expensive it was.  This is just as good.  Although I would suggest pouring a little melted butter over the top  of the batter before you bake it.  Mine crust was a little to dry.

I have made this bread several times, the first couple exactly as stated in the recipe.  I did make a change, unlike others I did not cut down the baking powder, I cut down the salt to 1/2 tsp.  This cuts down on the after taste while the bread keeps it's volume.  The crust will soften if allowed to cool 20-30 minutes before slicing. I love the ease of this bread and the taste is very good.

I baked this last night & it was SO easy.  Since my dough was pretty sticky, I couldn't get a nice smooth top from the batter, so I sprinkled some oats on top.  The last 10-15 mins of baking, I drizzled some melted butter on top.  I had it fresh out of the oven & it was very moist and dense.  The crust was chewy, but the inside was crumbly.  Still good, but I like a chewier inside.  The oats looks beautiful on top.  Next time I will try putting the melted butter on before baking.

Oh my gosh, I don't know what I did wrong.  Maybe it was my choice of beer (I used a brown ale.)  Sorry, but I did not care for this. Actually, I think my whole wheat flour was probably rancid. It only lasts 2 months in the cupboard. Make sure yours is fresh and maybe use a lighter beer so yours doesn't end up in the trash like mine. I will probably try this again soon because it sounds so good on paper!

This is my new favorite thing to make & take! I use club soda instead of beer, and use the melted butter on top.  So simple and wonderful.  It is always appreciated.

This was the first time I made beer bread and it turned out great even kids like it!! I didn't have whole wheat flour so a added a bit more normal flour and a bit of rye flour. It worked out fine and I actually think that the rye gave it a little kick. so I recomend beer bread and hopr to make it again

Taking the advice of previous reviewers, I used a slightly short tablespoon of regular baking powder, a slightly short teaspoon of salt, and a slightly heaped 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  I used Yuengling beer and the bread turned out sweeter than I expected but very good.  I will definitely be making this again--it was easy, has basic ingredients, and I love the taste and texture.

The first time I made this bread, it had a bitter aftertaste and we did not care for it.  Then I read the reviews about using Rumsford baking powder.  I couldn't find Rumsford baking powder at my grocery stores, so I just reduced the amount to 2 tsp. baking powder.  I also added 2 Tbsp. honey and poured 2 Tbsp. melted butter on top of the dough before baking.  We had it for dinner tonight and it was a big hit.  I used Fat Tire beer.  It tasted just as good as an expensive mix I used to buy.

Fantastic recipe!  I made a few changes... since I couldn't find aluminum-free baking powder and was worried about the taste, I lowered the amount to about 3 tsps.  I also used 2 cups whole wheat to 1 cup allpurpose flour and added about 1 tbsp each of molasses and honey to the mix.  We used a bottle of some type of milk stout and pour melted butter over the top.  My boyfriend thought it was a little sweet, but we both loved it, especially with a bowl of chili!

Excellent and easy!! I'm a busy mom and the work involved with yeast breads was too time consumming.  I did 2 cups whole wheat flour and 1 cup AP flour. Also make sure to use Aluminum-free baking powder (Rumford brand). I was having a bitter aftertaste and saw a reviewer suggest this, it makes a BIG difference.

A great, simple recipe.  I used Michelob Amber Bach.  It is slightly sweet, rich and very flavorful.  I think dark beers with a sweeter taste would work the best.  If you used a light, bland beer with an aftertaste the bread will probably reflect that.  My family loves this bread.  Thanks for sharing.

Fantastic! Made it exactly as written using a local Oktoberfest beer. Fabulous taste and texture. We used it as a side for soup and toasted it in the morning for breakfast.  Smells wonderful while baking.  Thank you!

I use this recipe exclusively, but change the flavor by using oat flour or buckwheat flour. All work equally well and all are equally tasty. Of course, the flavor is also changed by using different kinds of beer or ale.

I modified this slightly and we love it!  I decreased the white flour (also I used bead flour) to 1 cup. I added 1/2 cup of rye flour and a heaping tsp of caraway seed.  The modification yielded a slight rye flavor-more of a multigrain flavor, actually.  Nice crust with moist inside .  The loaf was about 3.5 inches tall at the middle of the loaf.  Looking forward to using this as a dipping bread with a bowl of homemade soup!

OMG! I have made many breads, and this is the fastest, easiest and tastiest!...Even faster to make than a breadmaker recipe. 
I only made minor changes:
-I added 1 Tblsp. of Molasses.
-Used 1/2 tsp. salt
-melted 3 Tblsp. of unsalted butter and poured over, as suggested by others. 
-Used Kokanee Gold Amber lager (left overs from a party.)
...I can't wait to try this with specialty/seasonal craft beers!

Easy recipe!  We used our home-brewed nut brown ale in ours.  Threw it all in our breadmaker on cake cycle and it came out great.  Hubs says its a bit bitter, but thats the beer.  It would turn out differently with the type of beer you use.

Delicious bread with great texture.  I reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp. and added 2 T. melted butter over the top of the batter before baking.  I used a Belgian Wheat ale and next time plan to use a hard cider flavored with apple and ginger.  I sliced the whole loaf and put it into my freezer.  When I want a special morning treat with breakfast, I remove one slice at a time and pop it into my toaster.

Wow! Just took this out of the oven and tested it...awesome! I have never even eaten beer bread before much less made it, but I love it! So simple. Used Coors original beer bc that's what kind were I to drinking right now. I don't taste beer just bread goodness. The only modification I made was 2 cups bread flour and only 1 cup of whole wheat but pretty much the same. And also poured half stick of melted butter over it before cooking too! Thanks for the recipe!

Very easy and good, but crumbly.  I've made the recipe exactly as written, and also switched it around a few times.  Most recently I've used self-rising flour for the all purpose flour, and cut the baking powder and salt in half to reflect that.  I use brown sugar Spenda blend.  I generally mix the dry ingredients and add about a 1/2 cup of toasted wheat germ, then the beer.  Then I divide the mixture among two smaller pans or three mini pans.  I tend to add different mix-ins to some....about 1 tsp crushed rosemary and 1 tsp crushed instant minced onion, or 1 tsp crushed dill, or 1-2 tsps bacon bits (in a seasoning blend or not).  All have been very good; the rosemary and onion is my favorite.  In the smaller pans I cook the bread about 10 minutes less.

My only criticism is that the bread is crumbly, even when made with no changes.  I'd like it to be a bit more fine textured, but maybe the crumbliness is in the nature of beer bread?

For years I've been buying a home party beer bread, but always hated the outrageous price.  NO MORE!!  This one blows theirs away!  I followed the recipe exactly as written and used a Corona beer.  MMMMM!  I'll definitely be making this again soon!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I really like this recipe, it's so easy for such good results.  But I took some of the advice offered by other user:  a cup of cheese mixed in with the bread (I didn't take anything out, the first time I made it it seemed a little wet), two tablespoons butter on top (I added a little salt) as well as a coating of cheddar cheese on top of the bread with about twenty minutes to cook (I also added another two tablespoons of butter).  It was delicious, and the crust I added (simply cheddar cheese, butter, salt) was perhaps my favorite part.  Great recipe, and easy to tweak to the way you like it.

My favorite beer to make with this bread is Stella. Granted, I've only attempted to make it with Stella, and Shock Top. 

I add 1 tsp of baking soda to keep it fluffy, and a bit of pepper for fragrance. It makes some bomb dinner rolls. :D

Made this last night. First time making bread and it turned out beautifully. Followed directions, used a can of bud light as it was what was available. Only thing I added was a teaspoon of vanilla. Roommates want me to make it again tonight. Took maybe five minutes to set it up then threw it in the oven for 55.

This bread would have been much better if it wasn't so salty. I read one review that suggested reducing the salt, so I only put in 1 tsp instead of 1 1/2. Sadly, this was still too much. The texture is nice and the loaf baked beautifully, so I will make this bread again with less salt.

This is a definite winner and so easy, sticky, but easy/quick to make.  I followed other reviewer's advice & used an ale (fat weasel), added 1-cup freshly grated cheddar, 2-tsp dill weed, 1 egg (white only) mixed all by hand. then drizzled 1 Tbsp butter on top. baked in convection oven & it was done a few minutes early. It rose perfectly with such a nice & crunchy texture outside & so soft inside. fantastic robust flavor. was a terrific addition to our pasta/meatball dinner tonight.  Thank you for sharing this recipe, definitely making again.

I always loved beer bread and haven't had it for years.  I followed the recipe, watched the time carefully and used fresh ingredients (incl. bottled Budweiser). Altho' moist to the touch the bread seems dry in the mouth, difficult to swallow and doesn't have the rich beer flavor I recall from the white version of the past.  I'm SO disappointed and don't know why it's so lacking.

The texture of the bread was great!!  I baked in it a cast iron skillet so it would bake faster (didn't allow enough time for the 50-60 minutes).  I do agree with several other reviews that the recipe "as is" is too salty.  But, I made it with hard cider, and the mild apple flavor came through in the bread!  Delicious!!

This was a really easy recipe to make. I used a honey brown lager for one loaf and a Sam Smith oatmeal stout for the other loaf. I preferred the Honey lager. It did turn out dry (user error), so I would watch what type of pan you use and the time that you cooked it. I used a glass pan and cooked it for 50 min.

Surprisingly easy recipe and also very tasty. I will definitely make this again. It was a good throw together to go with homemade chicken noodle soup. It has a hint of sweetness from the brown sugar, I think next time I will try it with a nut brown ale.

This was my first time ever eating or baking beer bread and all I can say is HOLY COW. This is amazing. Moist, rich and flavorful. I stuck to the recipe except for pouring melted butter over the dough before baking, as others had recommended. I am printing this out and putting it in my binder of favorite recipes.

very easy to make and nice looking bread. I did cut back on the amount of salt because last time it was bit too salty for me. I added a bottle of guiness beer. This turned to batter a dark color. The dough was a bit sticky and I put it in a large loaf pan. After reading other reviewers suggestions I decided to add 1/4 cup of melted butter. I let it sit for a few minutes before putting it into the oven to bake. The bread rose nicely and it had a nice brown color to it. The bread was slightly crunchy on top and soft on the inside. It definitely has a nice flavor. I put a little butter on it while it was still warm. I like this beer bread recipe over others I have tried so far.

For so few ingredients it came out wonderfully.  I used a bottle of Widmer unfiltered wheat hefeweizen and it complimented the brown sugar perfectly.  I only had 2 1/2 cups of flour and so added some oatmeal, which caused the bread to not rise quite as much as I'd hoped, but it was delightfully light, moist and was absolutely DELICIOUS toasted a few days later.  I will definitely make this again!

Fantastic bread! Dense, moist, flavorful and slightly crunch on top.  I did add about 3/4 cups of cheese, but did not change anything else. The amount of salt was just fine for us. I really love how the brown sugar gives it that hint of sweetness. I was looking for a way to use up our "non-alcoholic" Kaliber beer and this was just perfect. I think I'll make two more loaves and take them to my parents for Easter brunch.

Just made a loaf yesterday and making two more today. Absolutely easy to make for my first bread and came out as one of the flavorful breads I have had. I took others' recommendations about adding seasonings and kept with the original recipe. Thank You!

So easy and delicious! I changed the proportion of flours to 3 1/4c WW Flour and 3/4c AP Flour and dashed some cinnamon on top- even my dad who's hesitant when it comes to whole wheat breads loved it!

Awesome if you are searching for the alternative to the expensive Tastefully Simple recipe as I was. My boyfriend gave it a 10.

I made this with Blue Moon and really wasn't too impressed. I could see this being served with soup or chili as a decent side for dipping (catching other flavors) but not much more than that. It wasn't bad but not incredibly good.

Very good - not the prettiest loaf you'll see (admittedly, I may not have mixed or shaped the dough enough, etc.), but tastes wonderful - great texture.  I used Guinness.

Did not turn out.  Crust was tough and had a weird aftertaste.  Used an IPA so not sure if that was the problem.

I made this with ginger ale and it was delicious.  I let it rise for 30 minutes or so before cooking.  I also buttered the top and cooked for a few minutes at the end.  Great taste and texture.

I really can't say that I liked this because I don't like beer. But this was such an easy recipe that I had to try it. It came out great! Moist in the middle with a nice crust and was extremely quick to make.

I love this recipe. It couldn't have been easier. I couldn't wait to try it once it was out of the oven. I wasn’t disappointed. My husband already requested a second loaf. I hope it is just as good on the second day. I did put a little melted unsalted butter on top, but I'm not sure how it changed the taste. Next time I will try it without the butter.
oh, I forgot to add which type of beer I used, it was Bud Select.
I just reviewed the recipe and realized I forgot to add the salt. I didn't miss it, it was salty enough from the beer.

very, very tasty bread. love the crunchy crust outside, and that moist, flavorful inside. this is surprisingly easy to make (even when you're hungover ;p it'll still come out perfect). oh yea, i added some honey to the batter, drizzled some canola oil on top before baking. oven-fresh bread on a lazy day ;) sweet~

I make bread all the time and am just shocked at the ease and quickness of this recipe.  Plus, the taste is superb.  I used Shiner beer - yum.  The dough is sticky and "weird" looking, but really turns out great.  Thank you.  Will use over and over again.

This is so easy to make.  The whole wheat flour goes very well with the beer taste.  I thought it had a little too much salt and baking powder, but tasted good just the same. --update- I've made this again several times, and lowering to 1 Tbsp baking powder and 1 tsp salt makes it taste perfect to me.

This was my first time baking beer bread.  I was a little worried at first because I don't like beer very much.  But I was making a spicy black bean soup, and I read somewhere that a beer bread would compliment it very nicely.    The bread turned out beautifully, it was quite easy to make, and it was delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly as it was give.  Next time, the only thing I will change, is by adding a little less sugar... maybe half of what it calls for.  Neither my husband nor I have a sweet tooth, so this is just preference.

I completely agree with the other review that this should be a 6-star recipe. This bread is absolutely delicious! Great crispy crunch on the outside bbut still rich and moist inside. I think this tastes much, much better than the boxed kind that you pay $4 for. I didn't put it in a loaf pan, just formed it into two small mounds and baked one on a stoneware sheet and the other in a small crockware pan. I used the last bottle of beer I had in the back of my fridge. I think it was Miller lite. At first I thought the dough would be dry because it was not goopy like the boxed kind, but I just used my hands to form it and the final product was fantastic!  You can easily modify this to go with any kind of meal or special occassion- savory or sweet.

Very good!  I cooked it in round pan and took it out a few minutes early- it tastes great and is very moist.  This may be the easiest bread I've ever made, too.  I just used a leftover bottle of honey ale that had been sitting in the fridge way too long and I already have the ingredients memorized.  Love it.

I've made this recipe 3 times now, and I love it.  It is easy to throw together, it doesn't take many ingredients, and it is really neat how using a different beer alters the taste.  So far I have used only Samuel Adam's beers (Oktoberfest, Cream Stout and Boston Lager) and they all had a unique and delicious taste. I followed another reviewer's suggestion of putting some melted butter on top and cutting back on the salt.  Overall this is a recipe I will be making over and over again.

This is such an easy bread and it turned out great. I gave it only 4 stars though because the salt content needs altering. I used half the amount indicated (as other reviewers had suggested), and it was perfect. I used Buffalo Bill's pumpkin ale, and it complemented the brown sugar very well.

This bread is some of the most flavorful bread that has ever touched the haven of my mouth.   With a good India pale ale, such as Dogfish Head sixty minute both in the bread and to drink with it, I couldn't think of a better afternoon snack.   Honestly, I believe the more hoppie the beer the better the bread.   A+

Really very good.  I used a light ale beer, 1 tsp salt, 3 tsp baking powder, 2 C. whole wheat flour, 1 C. white flour, the brown sugar as described and cooked for 55 minutes. Delicious.

This is a great whole wheat beer bread recipe!  I made no changes to the recipe, I used Miller Lite. I also made a  honey butter (equal parts honey and butter in a blender until combined) to spread on the bread. I will definitely make this very simple recipe again.

So easy to make.  I've played around with a few different types of beer and have found the darker the better.  The bread was actually a lot sweeter with Guinness than with Coors Light.  Went great with corned beef and cabbage on St. Patty's Day.  If you've never made bread before this is the best place to start.

I was so excited about making this... used a Dale's Pale Ale.  It baked up great and had a nice texture, but all we could taste was the baking powder!  4.5 teaspoons?  Is that a typo?  We each had a slice or two (but soaking it in the potato/corn chowder I served it with before taking bites) and then I threw the rest away.  The baking powder taste was just incredibly overwhelming.  I will try this again but cut way back on the baking powder!

Really simple and really good.

Only thing different I did was cut WAY back on the salt and melt a little unsalted butter and pour it over the dough before baking. This went really well with the Slow Cooker Chicken Taco Soup.

Oh my goodness, this is fantastic-and so simple! Perfect with soup. I love how it’s so quick and you don't have to let anything rise. Unfortunately, I didn't have whole wheat flour, so I used all-purpose for the entire thing-I know, not as healthy:) Next time I will try oat flour- you can make it just by pulsing quick oats very finely in the food processor. Make sure you check yours all the way in the middle-mine takes a long time and sometimes turns out sticky!

Ha!! And I always thought I needed a bread machine to make bread?! This is my new favorite recipe and I can't wait to make it again. 
I followed the recipe to a T, used a can of Budweiser, and it turned out fantastic. I can already tell that I'm going to save a fortune on bread (good rolls cost 50 cents a piece at the grocery store!) My next mission is to figure out how to get it a bit less crumbly so I can use it with sandwiches. 
Thanks so much for this recipe!!

YUM!!! This bread was so easy!  I decided about an hour before dinner that we needed bread and this was just the perfect recipe!  I left all the stated ingredients in place and added 2 tsp. garlic powder, 1 c. grated cheddar cheese, 1 tsp. dried basil and poured 2 tsp. melted butter over the top 10 min. before it was done baking.  It was so easy and my family loved it!  Thanks!

Amzingly simple, amazingly good quick bread! I've made this twice, both times with a belgian wit-style beer, one that is flavored with orange peel and coriander. Turns out very tasty! I tried the advice of other users and put some pads of butter on the very top...crisps up the outside, makes the inside moist, and smells great while cooking! Complements any hearty soup or chile very well.

This is a wonderful "base" beer bread recipe.  Make it as is with a dark porter for a hearty, intense bread best served fresh from the oven with butter or preserves (blueberry is the best).  Use a red ale and add 3/4 C of golden raisins for a complex flavored bread, again best served fresh with butter.  You can control the heartiness by adding more white flour and less wheat flour.

I definitely recommend!

This is a fantastic recipe.  Melting a little butter on it before baking it creates a nice, sweet flavor, but it doesn't necessarily need it.  The boyfriend thought it was way better than the typical "beer bread mix."

I really loved this recipe. I used Coors Lite beer after reading the past reviews, to avoid a bitter taste. It worked, no bitter taste. I pour 1/4 cup melted butter over dough before baking and it came out beautiful! I took Princess Jenna's advice and served it with homemade honey butter-so good! Very simple yet it looks and tastes any thing but simple.

This is my favorite beer bread recipe - it's incredibly tasty, and I love to use whole wheat flour wherever I can (if you do too, check out the recipe for "Whole Wheat Ginger Snaps" on here - SO GOOD!). Being a broke college student, I of course drink and bake with the cheapest beer available in the area, which is Lionshead - costs me about fifty cents a bottle. And frankly, I find it delicious that way! Another reviewer said they did a taste-test and people like cheaper beer, so I think there may be something to that... :)

Very good.  A bit sweet, but each time I've had beer bread it has been sweet.  I used Bud Lite and thought it might need to be a bit flat, so I popped the top before I  made it.  I was impatient, though, and made it about 15 minutes later.  I couldn't taste the beer in the bread.  I put a few pats of butter on the top of the loaf before I made it, which made the top all crunchy and good.  Thanks!

Yummy! I was looking for an alternative to cornbread to go with our soup for dinner. At first my husband wasn't sure about the texture. But then he got the idea to mix honey with butter and put on the bread. Oh my goodness! That is good :) I did add a bit more brown sugar to make sure it balanced with the bitterness of the beer. I think depending on the style and brand of beer, the brown sugar amount needed could vary. It was nice to be able to taste both the beer and brown sugar in the final result. Very tasty.

I used Samuel Adams Cherry-Wheat beer. 
Did not like the dense texture and the bitterness of the beer was too strong. May try again with a lighter beer.

Delicious!  Followed recipe exact, with the exception of subbing honey for sugar.  The melted butter poured over the top is a great idea!  It created a beautiful, uniformly browned crust.  Try it, you'll love it!

Nice bread.  Very simple.  Very strong beer flavor.  I would recommend brushing melted butter on top before baking.  Choose your beer wisely.  If you do not like beer flavor - why are you baking beer bread?????

Made 6 loaves for my dad's 60th. This was a big hit. The kids are loving it! Also, on a side-note, I made a loaf with wheat-free baking mix and wheat-free beer (YES, made by Anhauser Busch). It was also very good. If you know of anyone who is allergic to wheat, this could be an option. I would like to add, that even though the wheat-free baking mix had the baking powder and salt already, I added what this recipe called for anyway. According to what I read, wheat free needs a little help with the rising. Both kinds very good!!!

I used a Sprite Zero in place of beer. I should have read reviews first as I can taste the baking powder. I'll try again with less. Otherwise it was good.

Ok, so I flubbed around a little bit and used all whole wheat flour instead of mixing half whole wheat and half regular white flour.  Also used Splenda instead of real sugar.  Came out kind of dry and bitter.  Bitterness may have been from the type of beer I used.  Overall, it was pretty good.  I think if I follow the recipe to the T it would be a lot better.

So good!  I have used the Beer Bread I recipe on this site, which is also very good (I usually use 1/4 cup sugar, and sometimes brown).  But I have been trying to eat more whole wheat, so I found this one.  I used a regular old Miller Lite and 2 cups of whole wheat flour and 2 cup of all-purpose and I was so pleased with the bread!  This tastes much better on following days than the other.  Just toast it with some butter and it just melts in your mouth!

WOW! So good and yummy.  VERY EASY to make.  Bread tastes much better the second day once the beer taste settles.  Very good with pasta as well as with sandwiches and salad.  I used Heineken which was strong but ever so good the following days. Will definitely bake again and experiment with other beers.

Excellent recipe!!  I followed others advice and used 1 Tbsp baking powder, also rubbed with butter after baking.  I used Bud Light, all that I had at the time, but it turned out great!!  Will experiment with a darker beer next time.  Husband loves it too!!  Definitely a keeper!!

I made it exactly as the recipe stated and it was wonderful, So easy to make.  I made it with Labbatt Genuin Draft and it was MMMMMMMMM good.  My husband didn't want any because he was full.  He took one bit and ate half the loaf.

This recipe is AWESOME!! I made it for the first time today, and my husband went nuts over it! I used Newcastle Brown Ale for the beer, and it came out perfectly. Thanks for such a great recipe!

This bread was so good.  I have bought Tastefully Simple beer bread before, which is excellent, but expensive.  Lots of people at the party thought this was the Tastefully Simple bread.  It was a big hit paired with garlic dip and spinach dip.

I can't believe I haven't reviewed this recipe yet.  I've been making this for almost two years now.  I don't change a thing on the recipe.  I use AmberBock ... it seems to taste the best.

This is so good, considering how easy it is to make! I cut the baking powder to 3 tsp (aluminum-free) and I cut the salt down to 1 tsp. I used 2 Tbsp white sugar, 1 Tbsp brown sugar, and a bottle of Michelob light ('cause hubby wouldn't let me use his good stuff). I also poured 3 Tbsp. melted Smart Balance buttery spread for extra flavor. It came out soooooo good! Crusty outside and moist inside. Thanks!

I made this bread twice this week! The first loaf made it out of the oven and was gone in less than an hour. Had to make another loaf the next day. I melted half a stick of butter and poured it on top, then sprinkled a tablespoon of sugar over the melted butter before baking. Extra crunch on the top! YUM Tasted like the manufactured mixes from the store, but better for you without the additives and preservatives.

AMAZING! Followed users recommendations: Aluminum Free Baking Powder, 1/2 cup Brown Sugar.. SO GOOD.  I used honey wheat ale (Honey Brown, to be specific) and I couldn't believe how easy and fabulous it was. Tried it with Sam Adams Cherry Wheat, but it wasn't as good or sweet. I'd go with "Honey Brown Ale", it was delicious with just butter! YUM! THANKS!

I used the suggestions posted by BABYSMILES; all whole wheat flour, honey instead of sugar & 2 tsp baking soda. I poured the 1/4 cup of melted butter over the loaf before baking, and it was great! I had one piece & my boyfriend ate the rest. Thanks for a great easy recipe!

Tasty!!!  I used the half cup of brown sugar but otherwise followed the directions.  Next time I will use all whole wheat flour as an experiment.  I used a bottle of lager.  And the best part was this bread was great even though I live at 9500 feet!!

I used all whole wheat flour and substituted honey for the sugar, and it was still delicious.  I used Killian's Irish Red beer.  Fifteen minutes before the bread finished baking, I poured 1/4 cup melted butter over the top, which made the crust extra yummy!  It was best fresh out of the oven while it was still warm.

Yummmy!  It is the best beer bread ever!  I have made this recipe about a dozen times and still can't get enough of it.  I increased the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and used 2 cups AP flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour.  YOU MUST USE ******RUMSFORD BRAND BAKING POWDER****** or it will not taste good at all.   (I ONLY FOUND IT AT THE DOMINICK'S SUPERMARKET.)  The kind of beer really changes the flavor of the bread so make sure it is one that you like a lot.  My favorite to cook with is MGD BEER.  Now, when ever I drink beer I automatically think of this bread!   Even got my non-drinking family members BUYING and *eating* beer.   :)  Thank you soo much for posting!

YUMMMY!  I wanted to make some bread for dinner, and didn't know what to make. but we were making cheese and rice brats, and figured what would go better with brats than beer bread?!  Followed recipe exactly, turned out wonderfully.  My other 3 roommates and I pretty much finished off the loaf in one sitting!  Very nice, crunchy texture on top and wonderful with warm butter!  Thanks for sharing!

This is probably the best beer bread recipe I have ever tried! I've used JW Dundee Honey Brown beer, and Shiner Bock. I'd say the Dundee gave it a better flavor than the Shiner. I also added some honey as I poured in the beer (probably 1/4 cup..I didn't measure) I also poured some melted butter over the top before baking! YUM! This bread has been a big hit everywhere I've taken it and my kids love it! This will be a family favorite for a long time to come!

I doubled the recipe, using half 7up and half beer, and I used sorghum molasses and honey in place of the brown sugar.  MMMM!  I used muffin tins and drizzled melted butter on top before baking.  what a tasty bread!

This turned out great and couldn't be easier. I used Leinenkugel's Original (since I'm from Wisconsin). I added a little butter and salt on top, and that worked out well. Next time I'll add sun-dried tomatoes and basil and maybe a little parm cheese.

Really great beer bread.  I used Budweiser.  My husband didn't like the taste, but wants to try again with a different brand of beer.  Best eaten while it is warm.

This is fantastic!! I took it out of the oven a few minutes ago and had to try it right away. Warm with honey,jelly or peanut butter...fabulous. I tried all 3 on small pieces and can hardly wait for supper tonight. I will use butter on it with the meal and have no doubt that it will be wonderful,possibly will skip the meat and veggies tonight. I added an egg and put 1/4 c.melted butter on top of batter before baking as  some others had suggested. I will be making this one often. Thanks for sharing

I have been looking for a quick recipe for homemade bread.  My family was tired of quickbreads that all had the same flavor, texture, etc.  This bread can be altered with just a different flavor of beer.  My husband loves it!  We had it for breakfast this morning.

I can hardly believe a bread so easy and quick can be so good!  I used to buy an expensive bread-machine mix for beer bread, but never again!  Even the 3-year old liked making and eating this.

I’ve made this a few times. I’m trying now to cut sugar to 1/4 C. and I added 1/2 C. sunflower seeds to the dough. I also used raw oats for the topping.
Delicious!

I followed others suggestions and brought the baking powder down to 3 tsp, added a cup of shredded cheddar and topped it of with melted butter with garlic and onion powder. Delicious!

This was the easiest and tastiest bread! I used a combination of a Cherry Pilsner and a Lager. Also added 3 tbsp pumpkin seeds, 3 tbsp sesame seeds, 3 tbsp sunflower seeds. Brushed the top with butter before baking as many suggested. Excellent!

I've never reviewed a recipe, but this was wonderful bread!  It was one of the easiest things I've made from this site.  Had a luncheon serving lemon chicken soup n this bread.  FANTASTIC!  Followed the recipe exactly.

I had some left over Stout and an over abundance of whole wheat flour with an itch to bake. I would have given this 5 stars but found it to be a little too salty.  I will cut back on the amount of salt next time. I did follow another members suggestion and did throw some  unsalted butter with black pepper and thyme on the top before baking. This bread is great toasted.

Oh my gosh, what an easy to make bread recipe. Also as good as was easy. My hubby homebrews his own so I made with his Rye beer. It was a bit strong for me but I still enjoyed it. Hubby really liked it but he likes rye bread anyway unlike myself. Can't wait to make this with his German Wheat beer which is my favorite. This one is a definitely a keeper. I did use only 3 tsp. of baking powder and added 4 tsp. wheat gluten as I do with all my bread baked goods.

Instead of 1/2 wheat and 1/2 white I use white-wheat flour. Add a teaspoon or so of cayenne, parsley, and garlic powder and 12 oz seltzer instead of beer.

I will make this again.  I used a summer ale and added a little sharp cheddar cheese.  It looked as beautiful as it tasted.  Was gone too fast to get a picture, or I'd share that.  Very easy recipe to follow.

This is quite a heavy bread, though very easy and tasty.  I do believe it is miss-titled though.  It should be called Half-Wheat Beer Bread since it is made with half all-purpose flour and half whole wheat flour.  That aside, I reduced my sale by 1/2 t. as it was suggested by another.  I only had a very dark beer on hand and used that.  It turned out bitter, but edible.  I would suggest to only use lighter colored beers for this bread.  Overall I am happy with this and would make it again, but with lighter beer.

For such a simple recipe, this was really good.  I followed the recommendation of someone and I decreased the amount of baking powder.  I used about 3.5 tsps.  It did not have baking powder taste.

Seems like a good recipe.  Never had the chance to try it since it will be taken to church on Sunday for the youth bake sale.  The crust seemed a bit  hard, but I did top it with melted butter to give it a different appearance and flavor.  I will make it again and update my review later.

Wonderful bread. Did exactly what the recipe said except I did pour 1/2 cup melted butter over top before cooking. Great flavour and the crust is awesome. I'll be making this again soon.

Taste was there.  It was just to crumbly for our taste.  I wanted to try something that did not require yeast.  So for that reason and since it tasted good, it gets 3 stars.

This was ok. I didn't have any beer, so I substituted club soda. If I made it again, I'd probably skip the brown sugar and add a tablespoon of honey instead. It was easy to make and filled its purpose, but not sure I'd care to make it again. Too sweet and salty. Just not my taste.

This is a good quick bread recipe. It has a nice taste, especially to eat with a more prominent dish. As many reviewers have pointed out, it is NECESSARY to cover the bread with butter before baking  or the bread will come out  extremely hard on top and be difficult to cut.

Followed recipe and added the melted butter as others suggested. Used a black & tan beer and it was so good had to put the loaf in the freezer so that I didn't eat it all in 1 sitting!

This quick and easy beer bread version is tastier than the all-white flour that I've used before.  Don't expect beer bread to be yeast bread texture, though.  It is really delicious with corned beef and cabbage or like meals.

It was super easy to make and came out pretty darn good.  I think it was a bit salty but I'd make it again.  Easy fresh loaf of bread is a good thing.

This is the best, the only thing I do differently is to just plop the dough onto parchment paper. Many more crunchy bits this way...and you need to adjust the time to approx 40 mins.

Okay, so I made a couple changes. First off, my husband is a brewer (makes his own beer) and we had some left over grain that he had used. So, instead of using a cup and a half of whole wheat flour, I used a cup of the left over grain and mixed it with water, heated it, then let it cool back to room temperature essentially making non-alcoholic beer so to speak. Then I mixed the mixture into the dry ingredients. Secondly, I used 1/2 cup of white sugar instead of the brown sugar. Over all, it turned out amazing!

Hmmm... I thought it was lacking flavor and the texture was very dense. But then I followed another reviewer's suggestion to only use 3 tsp of baking powder, so maybe that was why it turned out dense. Also I used a good dark winter seasonal beer, maybe this is better with a cheap watery beer like Bud! Still, not impressed overall.

I've now made this twice and each time it has been excellent. I will definitely continue to use this exact recipe. It is delightfully moist - but maybe it's because we keep adding 16 oz. of beer instead of 12 by accident (we just assumed the bottle was the same volume - nope). As per other suggestions, we have been baking with melted butter poured on top. For the last 10 minutes of baking or so, we have been putting honey into the melted butter too. So good!

I have made this bread as written and loved it. But this time I added 1/4 cup chopped walnuts and 1/4 cup roasted unsalted sunflower seeds and then used the dough to make drop biscuits, by baking rounded tablespoons onto a cookie sheet and baking at 425 for 13 minutes. Yummmm.

Excellent bread!  As per some of the reviews, I added 1/4 cup of melted butter to the top of the bread before baking.  I also included shredded cheese and reduced the baking soda to 3 teaspoons.  Delicious!  I ate two huge slices in one sitting :)

The bread turned out amazing! It's a bit crumbly, but that's fine, and adds to the texture. Adding some cinnamon and dried fruits or nuts would probably just add to the magnificence of this recipe.

Great recipe! I did not have any whole wheat flour so I added all white flour and it turned out fine.  I also added only 3 teaspoons baking powder like one reviewer suggested, and I added only about half of the salt called for as well.  To offset the bitter taste that some reviewers complained about I added 2 teaspoons white sugar. I used Corona Extra beer which gave it a nice flavor. 10 minutes before it was finished baking I melted 2 tablespoons butter and poured it over the top, everyone loved the salty flavor it gave to the crust. The bread was finished baking in just under an hour.

I have made this twice.  The first time I thought that it was too sweet (and I love sweets).  I used Sam Adams Octoberfest the first time.  Made it again today with Corona for dinner with family.  Used less brown sugar and used the full amount of baking powder.  We all thought that it tasted great.  I did not think that it had a bitter aftertaste.  Maybe the key is to shake your baking powder before using it, I always do that.  Will definitely make for years to come.

I didn't read through all the reviews so I missed the tip to lower the baking powder.  Which is probably exactly what I didn't like about this bread - bitter aftertaste.  I used Samuel Adams and added butter to the top - it was so easy to put together.  I really wanted to like it, but nope.  Hubby didn't even like it fresh out of the oven with butter.  It was also difficult to cut into slices, something about the odd-shaped crusty top would have it coming apart.  I'm going to try again with the lowered baking powder and add some additions other reviewers tried - but as written, I wouldn't make it again.

The house smelled wonderful while baking. I used all unbleached bread flour and a bottle of Sierra Nevada Oktoberfest. Very hearty with just a hint of sweet, brushed the top lightly with butter. On the advice of another reviewer I did cut the baking powder to 3 teaspoons.

Such a easy, quick ,delicious bread! I used a Pumpkin Ale, amazing. I can't wait to try this with different beers. As other suggestions, I use 1 tsp salt and 3 tsp baking powder. Melted honey and butter, basted it before baking than basted a little more 10 minutes before done. Of note, mine cooked in 45 minutes. Watch carefully!

Followed recipe exactly (except for adding 1/4 cup melted butter on the top before baking).  Excellent served warm, spread with butter.  Good with a hearty soup.  Will make again.

This bread was so easy, and so delicious! Nearly as good as those expensive boxed beer bread mixes. I also added a little butter on top as it was baking as was suggested on other reviews.

Best beer bread I've ever made. Not dry or chewy. I added nuts to the recipe and salted the top. Really good!

This is the first loaf of bread that I made with my new (to me) wheat mill. I was looking for a recipe that I had all the ingredients for and this one fit the bill. I used Abita Mardi Gras Bock. Haven't tasted yet but it smells wonderful. I'll try to update once we cut into it.

Loved this recipe! Very easy and the bread turned out very flavorful.  I used Guinness Extra Stout and per other reviews topped my bread with 1/4 cup of melted butter before placing it in the oven.  It baked for 50 minutes at 350 in a dark loaf pan.

Followed the recipe using Sam Adams Boston Lager and poured a little melted butter over the top as others suggested. I used splenda brown sugar and used a little less than the 1/3 cup the recipe called for. It still was good but a little sweet for a dinner bread. However, it was excellent toasted the next morning and 2 mornings later it is still good. Definitely would make again using a pumpkin or apple ale and the full amount of brown sugar substitute.

I made this exact with the exception of brushing a little butter on the top. I think its a good base recipe. It came out pretty and the texture is good. I do taste the bitterness of the baking powder though. I would do the same and reduce the baking powder to 1 tablespoon and I think I would also add a little honey to the recipe. I will be trying this again with some variations!

Our oven cooks things much faster than any recipe says, so we cooked it for about 40 minute and got a lovely, moist loaf that went fantastically well with our butternut squash soup. We'll definitely be making this one again!

I followed the recipe exactly and the bread is very yummy, but tastes quite strongly of the beer.  It's something nice for a change, especially given how super easy the recipe is, but I don't know that I would make it regularly.  Also, next time I think I will use some oatmeal on top, because the texture on top of the bread is quite unattractive.

I had some Sam Adam's Cherry Chocolate Bock beer which nobody would drink, so I used it in this recipe. The only change I made was to use all white flour. I thought the wheat flour may make the flavor heavy. It was delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this today and it was a hit! I used Sprite Zero instead of beer and also spread 3 TBSP of melted butter on dough before baking. It's so easy and very very tasty.

Made this to go with some split pea soup. I didn't have whole wheat flour, so I used 3 cups of all-purpose flour instead, and made it with Shipyard Pumpkinhead beer. It came out great and smelled awesome while cooking. Overall, it's a really delicious and easy recipe that I am sure I will make again. I would rate 5 stars, but the top crust is a bit hard to chew.

This bread is excellent, just as written.  I think the reason there was a small percentage of people who didn't like it is that those are the same people who don't like whole wheat bread, period.  It is something that one has to get used to if you grew up with white store bought super soft and sweet mush bread.  This is so much better for you.  I like to grind my own wheat (I get teased) so my whole wheat flour is very fresh.  I like the idea of premixing this and wrapping up with a beer for Christmas gifts.  What a great idea, I am definitely going to do that this year.

Perfect every time! I recommend checking the loaf partway through cooking, because mine was done a bit sooner than the recipe said. It's a perfect, hearty bread to have accompany soups and salads. I'm a big fan!

Ridiculously good!  I made mine with an Oktoberfest beer and put a tbsp of butter on top before baking.  Insanely delicious for being so simple.  Almost a cornbread taste somehow.

WOW!!!! i usually dont like alcohol flavored foods, nor do i like whole wheat.  but the bf does, and i had some leftover vanilla porter from some french toast i'd made earlier.  i had used 2/3 cup of the vanilla porter, so i added 2/3 cup of leinenkugels honeyweiss to make up for the lack of vanilla porter.  sooooo good!!!! i drizzled a little olive oil on top instead of butter.  the bread was sweet, yet tangy and delicious.  will make again. and again!

This bread was fantastic! I followed the advice of another review and added 1/4 c melted butter on top of the dough and halved the salt. It was really easy to put together and tasted fabulous! I used a Summer Wheat Leinenkugel this time, but look forward to trying it with others!

So easy! Turned out perfect. Made it for 3 other people who could not get enough. Needed something that was fast and easy, sometimes i do not have the time to make homemade bread from scratch. Thanks a lot for sharing :)

Love, love, love this bread!  I used Leinenkugel Honey Weiss for the beer and OMGoodness, this was divine.  Also, I melted about 1/4 C butter and poured over the top when it came out of the oven.  Can't wait for breakfast in the morning when I will toast this and eat it with sausage.  Yummmm

This bread was super simple to make in the Kitchenaid and came out perfect! Following other reviewers advise, I poured 1/4 C. melted salted butter over bread before baking. Used Pacifica Clara mexican beer and it was very tasty! Will make again.

Good, stick with you bread. I used 3 tbsp of agave instead of brown sugar & amstel light draft. This could be good sandwich bread. We had it for breakfast with honey & peanut butter on day one and with apricot preserves another day.

Faster to prepare than store-bought bread mix, and much more rewarding. After a box of Trader Joe's beer bread mix sat in my cupboard a few months, I made it & it was delicious. (The instructions called for an entire stick of butter melted & poured over the loaf prior to baking...of course it was delicious!) Later I discovered that Trader Joe's mix is a seasonal item and no longer available, so I'd hoped this recipe would compare. It exceeded the quality of the TJ's bread, even without all the melted butter...though a few tablespoons did enhance it nicely.

This was awesome! I made my first loaf of bread today with this recipe. It's really easy to make and tastes great-my husband loves it. I'm looking forward to experimenting with different beers, as I used whatever we had in the fridge at the time.

Very good just as is.  Sometimes I spray with a little butter flavored cooking spray 10 minutes before I take the bread out for color but I have tried alterations in the past and nothing comes close to the original.

Delicious!! I have made beer bread before but this one is fantastic. I used bread flour instead of all-purpose, and cut down on the baking powder and salt like others suggested and it came out great. I also bushed with butter when it came out to the oven. I will definitely make this again.

This bread is very tasty.  The only thing, which may have to do with the beer I used, it was a little salty.  Next time I might cut down on the salt.  All in all, a great bread recipe.  Excellent for sandwiches!

This bread is so moist and delicious. I would recommend cutting back on the salt as it was a little too salty. But that didn't stop us from devouring the loaf!

Absolutely delicious and perfect texture. I was afraid 1/3 cup brown sugar would make it too sweet, but it was really wonderful as is.

I actually wanted to give this 4.5 stars, but didn't have that option.  I prepared this recipe exactly as written.  It made very tasty bread and was super, super easy to make.  I highly recommend making this bread if you are in a hurry!  My husband liked it enough to request it again, and the beer does make a difference.  The first time I used a New Castle Honey Brown, and the second time I used a Yuengling.  I actually liked it with the Yuengling better.

We enjoyed this bread.  It was very easy to make and I plan to make it again although next time I think I will add more cheese and possibly jalapenos instead of the green chilies.

Easy to make, surprisingly easy. The bread that results is moist and delicious. I used Miller Lite (I did NOT want to waste good beer) and bread flour instead of the other flours. I brought it to work, and a coworker asked for the recipe. Success.

Great taste! gave 4 stars instead of 5 b/c the bread ends up being a little dense/compact, but the taste is great. I added some butter on top of the bread as suggested by other reviewers, but the next time I'm making the bread, I will definitely leave the butter out. Totally unnecessary.

I was very pleasantly surprised! Not only was the whole wheat unnoticeable, but this bread succeeded in making a very bad beer (Mad Elf ale) taste very good in a bread. I also added the recommended butter on top before cooking, and would again, as I found it added a wonderful dimension to the bread's flavor. I did reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup simply because I was too lazy to go find my 1/3 cup measure. Thanks much!

Delicious and easy, even with Coors Light, which is all I had around at the time.  After a few tries I put a couple of handful of shredded cheddar in the mix along with some dill, then sprinkled some of both on top.  The cheese was delicious.

I followed the recipe as written except for reducing the salt to 1 teaspoon.  I used O'Douls non-alcoholic beer but didn't taste any beer flavor to the finished product so I will use regular beer or ale next time.  The bread dough came out more like a batter for me - I was able to mix it up easily with just the wooden spoon.  The bread came out wonderfully and was delicious.  This is a recipe that will become a part of my favorite baking collection.

super easy recipe and was very good! I made as is (although i cooked it a little too long - 55 minutes - so it was a little chewier) and I think i would like to add a little cheddar cheese and diced chillis or melted butter on the top or something else to give it a little more kick

So easy and delicious!!  Other than cutting back on the salt, I made no changes.  The bread has a nice crispy, crust, and soft, chewy center.  My bread was done perfectly after 50 minutes.

This was THE BEST!  Have not made beer bread before tonight, no excuse!  I followed the recipe exactly but put in 1 1/2 teaspoon of Italian seasoning as suggested by another baker.  Went perfect with my homemade Italian 'hamburger helper' type dinner.  Will definitely make this again.

The bread itself is very delicious. Very easy to make too. But the texture was a little dense, the bread turned out too crusty and we have a difficulty to cut it.

I made this last night and it turned out great!  I did add about 2 tablespoons of honey to the batter and used a Miller Light since that was all I had and it turned out wonderful.  This loaf won't last long at our house.  Next time I will try it with Orange soda.

I did not care for this recipe. Dry and very very bland.  We're not picky eaters at all, but we eventually had to just throw the whole loaf away because we just couldn't eat it anymore!

Tasty!  I followed the recipe to the letter.  For the beer, I used Rickard's Red (which is what is usually in the fridge).  I baked for 50 minutes, but it could have used a bit longer.  The taste was good, especially still warm from the oven with butter on top.  Mmm!

Very good, and even had good texture the next day - not crumbly and dry like whole wheat bread often is. I highly recommend using a honey brown-type beer to give it a really good flavor.

Great bread, quick and easy.  I also cut the salt down to 1 tsp, added a cup of shredded cheddar cheese, used a regular Budweiser beer and poured a half cup of melted butter over the top.  I didn't have any trouble with bitterness, but I used double acting baking powder and so I needed only half as much. It was devoured as soon as it came out of the oven.

This was very good! I stole one of my husbands Bud Selects to make it. Took other reviewers suggestions to pour 1/4 C melted butter over the top prior to baking. I love how crusty this bread is on the outside and then really moist on the inside. Will bake again!

I used Guiness and buckwheat flour.  Dark delicious bread!  I even forgot the sugar, and it was still good.  Gonna try again with the sugar soon.  Melted butter over top like some others.

First, let's just say this is the easiest non-sweet quick bread I've ever made.  Mine came out pretty good, although next time I will use a better, fuller beer instead of the Miller Light we had, which I would never use again for this.  Too light, and I think it played a part in making the crust too crunchy and hard.  The overall flavor is ok, but would definitely be improved by using a better beer.

This is the first loaf of bread I've ever made, and it was very easy and tasty.  I used a Yuengling Black & Tan, and did not deviate from the recipe.  My partner and I each give it four stars.  It tasted good, but was simple and a little chewy.  I will definitely use the base of this recipe and play around as other users have.

This bread was really quick and easy to make. I served it with minestrone soup, and the leftovers have served as really yummy toast for breakfast the past couple of days. I followed the recipe exactly, and will probably try it with all whole wheat next time to see if I like it as well. Thanks for a great recipe!

Fantastic. A little sweet with a pilsner and the recommended sugar for my taste. But so easy and so good, I expect I'll chart out my preferred sugar to different beer types before very long at all.

Loved the flavor, loved the ease of preparation... did not love the texture. It was way too dense and chewy for us. Maybe I did something wrong, but with a recipe that simple, I don't think I could have messed it up. Thanks anyway, but I won't make this again.

Definitely a winner here! I did throw in 2 garlic cloves and the beer of choice was Budlight.  Very tasty!

This recipe was well-liked by all of my family.  Personally, I felt it was a bit too heavy but still delicious.  I melted 3 TB of unsalted butter and poured over the top, cooled, and served with spinach dip.

The texture was nice and it was super easy, but it came out very bitter (as other reviewers also noted).  I'm assuming it was my choice of beer - Grolsch Lager.  I'll give it one more try with a different beer.

It may have been the beer I used, but it was a little blander than I expected.   I'm going to give this another try, with a different beer.  Also I may add some sharp cheddar cheese for some additional flavor.

The baking powder...it seems like a lot, and my bread came out bitter tasting. Maybe it was the beer I used though (Stella Artois). I put the butter on top, but the loaf came out too crunchy, so next time I will bake it for a few minutes less and baste the top with butter when it's done baking.

I used a microbrew darker ale.  It was rather gross.  Maybe a lighter beer would be all the difference. It just tasted really bitter.  Easy to make, though.  I won't make again.

Thought I would try this one out. My regular beer bread is basically the same recipe except it uses white sugar and white flour. I like my regular one better. And as other post have mentioned, I pour melted butter over the top before cooking.

I thought this bread was great.  I added melted butter to the top like other viewers and thought it got a little brown for my tastes.  Next time I will wait until almost done and then sprinkle either sugar or garlic on the top.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Help! What did I do! I love beer bread. And I love wheat bread, so why did this not turn out? I made exactly as stated. Didn't even add the butter. It tasted metallic-y. Was it the baking powder? I thought 4 1/2 t. sounded like way too much, but went with it since none of the reviewers mentioned anything. Want to make it again but not if that is really the final product! Adding some sharp cheddar cheese made it edible.

This turned out better then I thought. I dont drink alcohol let alone beer so I actually had no idea what beer to use. I did settle on bud light. I liked the texture and consistency of the bread. Also used whole wheat graham flour instead of regular whole wheat flour only b/c I grabbed the wrong flour.Thanks for the recipe. I think I'll try a different beer next time for sure.

I was hoping that as with other baking that the alcohol would burn off as neither my boyfriend nor myself are fans, but I could still taste those definite "beers" tones. Not sure if cutting down on the ounces would cure this or just a different beer, but not too sure I'm willing to try. For the record, I used Coors, only wheat flour, mixed in 1 tbsp. of honey, and topped the loaf off with the melted 1/4 butter as others suggested.

This was very good, I used Indio a Mexican beer that is a little strong, and it came out great, you could taste the flavor of the beer, but it wasn't overwhelming. I think that if I had used a lighter beer, the flavor would have been too mild, but that's just me, I like beer . I used to make cheese and spinach sandwiches, and I used the leftovers the second day to make tomato bruschettas, delish!

I have made this recipe several times and it's wonderful!!! My family especially likes it with spaghetti and meatballs. I add 1/4 cup of melted butter to the top before it goes into the oven and it makes the most amazing crust. I tried it once with a Guiness dark ale and didn't like it nearly as well as Labatt's Blue. Thanks for sharing.

Delicious! Used Smithwick's Irish Ale.  Not bitter at all, just a very slight beer taste.  Poured 1/4 cup melted butter over the top before baking as well.  Even better the second day.  I made it for St. Paddy's Day and served with honey butter. Will make again and again.

This was great! Didn't change a thing. I used cheap beer like I always do for beer bread(I save the good stuff for drinking):) Yummy! Thanks!

Very bitter. I was hoping for a sweeter taste. I accidently used baking soda instead of baking powder...maybe this is the reason. I'll have to try it again using baking powder.

Yum excellent!  I did not change a thing, except reduce salt to 1 tsp and add 2 tbsp of melted butter during the last 20 min of cooking.  Used a Speights Ale (I'm in NZ), not a very flash beer and the flavour was perfect, not too "beery" or bitter in the slightest.

THIS WAS OK. I NEEDED HEARTY BREAD FOR BEAN SOUP MY HUSBAND MADE. I USED A DARK BEER (THAT MAY ACCOUNT FOR THE BITTER AFTER TASTE) THE TEXTURE & TASTE WAS MORE LIKE BANANA BREAD, WITH OUT THE BANANAS. I WOULD NOT MAKE THIS AGAIN.

Great! I cooked it last night and today we had it with smoked salmon, onion and cream cheese. My wife was very pleased! I used black stout and it gave the bread a lovely malty smell. Easy for a beginner like me, just follow the recipe exactly.

This bread was gone almost before it was completely cooled.  We had some leftover Bud Lite and I found a great way to make use of it.  It was very easy to make, too.  I didn't think it tasted to "beery", if it did, I wouldn't like it.  Next time I'll try with just the whole wheat.

Pretty good, it looks like it will be stale as a brick tomorrow. I shouldve waited for it to cool a bit more before slicing, but supper was ready. We're not beer drinkers so I thought it was a bit bitter. Kids and hubby liked it.

This was insanely easy, insanely delicious, and much adored by my husband. Contrary to other reviews, I thought it was best the first day. Definitely making this regularly (and that says a lot coming from someone who rarely makes the same thing twice).

This is very good and easy to make when you're supposed to bring the bread and you only have an hour.  It is rustic, but that's part of its charm.  My family loved it.

I love this recipe.  The only changes I make are omitting the salt and only using 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  It only takes 40 minutes to bake in my oven.  It is excellent with chili!

Excellent and easy!  What more can a person want?  I will add a touch more salt next time, just personal taste.  I served this bread with homemade beef barley soup- a great meal for a cozy fall evening.

I used ALL whole wheat flour and took the advice of Linda McLean by using honey in place of the brown sugar for a healthier bread.  End result, yummy.  It is dense and crumbly, but oh so easy and tasty.  Can't wait to try this out again and changing the beer for soda - would be GREAT for those cold winter nights with a giant bowl of chili.  Thanks much for the recipe!!!

I don't know what I did wrong, but my bread came out VERY dense and kind of bland.  I followed the suggestions of others and used 100% whole wheat flour, honey, and just 2 tsp. of baking powder.  I think I will follow the recipe to the "t" next time and also use the advice of others and try the aluminium free baking powder.  I used Corona Light beer this time, but I will use a much stronger flavored beer next time so that I can taste the yeast.  Thanks for this recipe and I will definitely try it again.

Very good for what it is: a quick, *easy* bread that tastes/smells like yeast.  Didn't look very pretty, but just slice it before you serve and no one will know.  I cut down the sugar to 1/4 c.  The bread was very yummy, sliced and topped with honey.

I'm echoing the sentiments of several other posts.  This is the best beer bread recipe ever!  I found the suggested brand of baking powder (Super Wal-Mart) and added the 1/2 cup of brown sugar as suggested.  Crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside and nicely sweek, awesome!  Oh, I used Stella Artois a Belgian beer.

My first time making beer bread, it turned out wonderful, served it with chili.  I used Shiner Bock beer, Whole wheat flour and bread flour.  I also added butter to top before baking as suggested. My family loved it.

Excellent! After reading some reviews I was scared to go by the original recipe, so I took the advice of another review with great results. I used a slightly short tablespoon of REGULAR baking powder, a slightly short teaspoon of salt, and a slightly heaped 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Used Michelob Ultra Beer. Brushed 1/4 C melter butter on after 20 min in oven. It was just like an expensive mix but better!

Very easy and really good. I added 1/2 cup brown sugar and substituted 1/4 cup soy flour for white flour. I also  poured melted butter over the top the last 15 minutes of baking.

My husband and I really liked this beer bread, however, I thought it was not quite sweet enough.  I added 1/3 cup white sugar, and used a honey wheat beer, and it turned out perfect!

This was good. I rated it a four mainly because it was so easy. I needed a fast bread for my soup and this fit the bill especially since I had no self rising flour on hand.

This is the 3rd beer bread recipe I have tried, and this one is the best so far. Very yummy and hearty/healthy tasting. I did increase the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and used 1 tsp salt and 1tbsp baking powder. Good stuff!

I made this over the weekend and YUM!  I added some melted butter on top before baking and it was delicious!  It is so fast and easy and WAY cheaper (though just as good) than the TS beer bread.  I like that you only need regular flours  - so the ingredients are ones you probably have on hand.  I made this with the stuffed pepper soup....great combo!

As the name states, accidental.  I am a true fan of Shiner Bock beer and have been using it in several recipes.  This recipe came out as a crowd pleaser.  However, the other day I ran out of all-purpose flour so I substituted a 1/2 cup of pioneer baking mix...and wow!!! It bakes a bit longer but it's worth it.

This bread wasn't too my taste at all, I threw the majority of it away.  Didn't even like it with chili.  I'd give it less stars, but I think it was just me, not the bread.  I'll stick to cooking, not baking, with beer.

I used a honey wheat lager. My husband and son just did not like it. They said it tasted liked unsweetened bran muffins. I was bummed as it was so easy to make. I might try it with all white flour next time.

I think this is a quick and easy bread to make.  As for the flavor, I think it has to do with what beer you use.  I used Michelob Ultra and it turned out really well.  I also used Splenda in place of the brown sugar.  Mine turned out to be a very sweet(not honey bun sweet) bread.  My family loves it!  We love it for sandwiches, with meals, or just by itself.

This is quick to assemble, but I did not care for it.  There is NO flavor to this bread.  The yeast in the beer doesn't quite do it so it doesn't even taste like bread. I should have added some molasses or something to give it some flavor.

The good flavor along with ease of preparation earns five stars for this recipe.  I made it with Michelob Ultra, slapped it in the pan, add melted butter on top and an hour later had a tasty bread. Thanks!

This LOOKS really good...so I gave it two stars instead of one.  However, the taste is rather...uh, bad.  My husband wouldn't eat it.  I wonder about that 4.5 teaspoons of baking powder.  Is that correct?  It has a very heavy aftertaste of something...and I noticed that others have also commented on it.  I don't think it's the beer.  I think it's the baking powder.

I just made this bread and it is delicious!  My husband and I aren't really beer drinkers so since I didnt have a can of beer I used a can of 7up.  I've done this before with boxed beer bread mixes and was told that all you really need to add is a carbonated beverage, not necessiarly beer.  Well, this recipe turned out great with the 7up!  I also melted a little butter and poured it over the batter before baking (about 1/4 cup).

Easy, filling, and delicious.  Flavor changes depending on beer used...can be sweeter or stronger.  Haven't tried one yet that wasn't good!  Favorite was probably a Holiday Ale I had left over...dark, and gave a great flavor.

The bread turned out more bitter than the beer itself.  I'm not used to making quickbreads, but it was denser and more crumbly than I'd hoped for.  I wouldn't make this again.

I thought this was excellent. I used all white flour as we were out of wheat and found it to be quite sticky - perhpas becuase of the flour or perhaps because I'm at a high altitude. I just kept adding more flour until it was workable. I used a light beer and is not bitter at all - this can't be beat!

My husband and I loved this bread!!
I did put melted butter on top before baking as suggested by some other bakers. I used Leinies Honey Weiss!!
We had some while it was still warm.
It had a sweet flavor. Very good!!
I don't think I would change a thing, other than the melted butter.

This was pretty good bread, but I think it was the beer I used that gave it a bitter aftertaste. I will make this again with a lighter more subtle beer.

I'm not a big fan of whole wheat bread so maybe that's why I found this a little boring. I regularly make a different version of beer bread with all white flour and I add lots of cheddar, parmesan cheese and parsley. Unfortunately this recipe doesn't come close to that one. I found the dough a bit wet when I was putting it in the pan and had to sprinkle additional flour on top to press it down. Halfway through baking I spread a garlic butter recipe that I got off this site (submitted by Denyse) over the top to give the top of the loaf a prettier appearance and a little more flavor. I also spread it on the warm bread slice and it really improved it for me.

This was on of the best breads I have ever had.  It was moist, and hearty with a subtle sweetness.  I will definatly be saving this recipe. YUMMY!

I found this to be too crumbly in comparison to the plain beer bread recipe. The texture was a little dry, maybe I will decrease the amount of whole wheat flour if I try it again. The flavor was okay, maybe broiled w/butter & garlic it would moisten it enough.

This bread is wonderful with chicken noodle soup.  I used a wheat beer and it is so yummy and easy.
