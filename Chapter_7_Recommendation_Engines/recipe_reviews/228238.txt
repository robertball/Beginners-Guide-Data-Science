Wow!  This was the first time I'd tried an unrated recipe, I made it exactly as stated (marinating for 6 hours), and it was so simple and delicious!  It was very easy to prepare with ingredients you're likely to have on hand, except for maybe the goat.  We had purchased two pounds of frozen goat stew meat and made a curry with the first pound.  We found that first meal quite chewy and tough to eat because we hadn't realized that we should have stewed the goat for some time to soften it.  With this recipe the marinating combined with the stewing made the goat meat easy to eat.  The broth was lovely and rich, and rather than rice we used bread for sopping up the broth, but next time (and there *will* be a next time) I think we will use rice.

Though it was very, very tasty and I do recommend it, it did seem to be missing a little something.  The flavour seemed a tiny bit unfinished, if that makes sense.  I was thinking maybe some other herb or spice was needed to round it out, but I couldn't put my finger on it.  I may have to experiment... :-)

WOW !!! Thank you very much Olivia Tuggle !!!
On a scale of 1-100, this is a 100. WARNING: You may find yourself starting to like leftovers, eating it 3 times a day, licking your fingers and plate, and eating 1/3 of it at the counter b/s you can't stop to get more comfy.  TRIPLE+ the recipe and definitely use lots of water for sauce and lots of rice for soaking it.  I used some extra finely crushed red pepper and finely chopped tomatoes (and a bit of paprika) b/s I didn't have cayenne pepper and tomato sauce.  The final taste is really a combo of hot, salty, sweet and sour - WOW !!!

This recipe was amazing. We have never cooked goat before and were worried about the taste (this was an Ibex goat that we cooked so it's game meat.) We marinated for 24 hours and the meat was so tender that we didn't have to cook the recipe as long as the recipe suggested. Great taste. We will definitely make this again!

After the first time making this, it quickly became my husbands favorite dish. He requests it all the time, and no one else in the family complains. I took the advice of a reviewer and boiled the meat for two hours before marinating, and used the boiled water in place of the beef stock. I marinated the meat for six hours, and used sweet peppers instead of bell pepper. It was absolutely delicious!

Recipe was great and am sure beef could have been substituted  but goat  needs  to be boiled 2 hours first  to soften then do original  recipe using  boiled water as base for stew.

My husband and I enjoyed this dish. I did not use any additional salt based on a couple of the reviewer's warnings, and I doubled the vegetables. Other than that, I followed the recipe. This is the first time I cooked goat, so it was a risk. However, we eat lamb regularly. If you like lamb, I think you'll like goat. Definitely a keeper for us, and now I want to try more goat meat recipes.

This was so good!  I live in India and was making for the family here, so I did minor tweaks.  But the basic idea of this is perfect and you can vary it as you want.  
Here's my changes: I tripled the recipe, so added three goat feet to give the soup broth richness as I used the meat cooking liquid only (no broth here and I didn't have time to make one). After marinating and browning I pressure cooked the meat with thinly sliced onions and water.  I made the tomato base as written, then added the meat with cooking broth and marinade.  I needed to add more water.  My family likes spicy so I did up the spices (I don't measure but used a lot of chili powder and some various masalas).  Since the meat was mostly done I just added the potatoes to cook and tasted as they cooked, adjusting the spices.  Served over rice.  This is definitely going to be made regularly for us!  YUM

I made some changes based on what I had in the kitchen. I used the whole 2 lb bag of goat cubes because I already had them thawed. I left the marinade measurements the same except I doubled the garlic and used white wine vinegar. I marinated for 12 hrs. 
I dumped the whole thing in the slow cooker with the rest of the ingredients except for the peas. I tossed those in when it was done. I added Hungarian paprika, a bay leaf and a chunk of ginger. The bay leaf and ginger not to be eaten. 
The stew is absolutely delicious. The meat was tender and flavorful. I will definitely be making this again.
Next time I will probably flour the meat to thicken up the gravy as the slow cooker creates a lot of juice.

AWESOME! I LOVED IT! I marinated the meat for 12 hours! The meat is very delicious! I didn't add everything that the recipe said and also changed a few ingredients, but all in all it is great and this was my first time cooking goat! Definitely would do it again!

I think this recipe has potential. This is my first time cooking goat, and it came out on the tougher side.  I think it needs to be simmered way longer.  I used apple cider vinegar and replaced some of the soy sauce with low-sodium soy sauce.  I also used diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce because it's what I had on hand and added a splash of ketchup.  Taste-wise, it was very good - not too sour, salty or sweet - a perfect balance.  Just need to get the goat less tough...

Easy recipe that has a great taste. We substituted a quartered ear of corn in place of peas.

One of my local grocery stores sells boneless goat meat that is already cut up into small chunks.  I've used it in Jamaican curried goat and Indian recipes, so I thought I'd give this a try.  The result was subtle and delicious!  I had two pounds of goat, so I doubled all the ingredients except the tomato sauce  (I used a 15 oz can of petite diced tomatoes) and added very little water.   I only marinated it for less than two hours.  I also substituted fresh green beans for the peas because I could.  Thank you for this.  We will eat this dish frequently throughout the year.

Way too salty, way too tomatoey, and we even used less than the recommended amounts of soy sauce and tomato sauce! Definitely will not make again, and if I could rate this lower I would for sure. I have NO idea how this is rated so highly.

This is wonderful! First time having goat and I love the flavor. Wife didn't want to try it so it was all mine. I ate it every meal until it was gone and I always had a smile on my face when I was finished.

Recipe is spot on, I used 2lbs of goat. The only personal changes I made were 3 potatoes and a full cup of peas. I marinated the meat for 24 hours. You definitely want to cook the meat longer to get it fall off the bone good. I cooked the first stage for an hour and a half, and then added the veggies, then cooked for over and hour more. it's game meat and lean and needs time to break down. careful with the cayenne pepper, a little goes a long way with this.

I made this today (to have for supper) - I was pleasantly surprised at how tasty it was.  the only ingredient I omitted was the peppers as neither my husband nor I are fans of any kind of peppers.  It was very tasty.  I ended up marinating it for over 12 hours, actually.  And I used Low Sodium Soy Sauce.

EXCELLENT recipe and will definitely make it again.

I really like this.  I rarely marinate, just add the vinegar and soy sauce along with the tomato sauce and broth.  I cook it in the pressure cooker for 30 minutes then add the potatoes, carrots and peas.  Do another 20 minutes.  Always tender and delicious.

Hands down my favorite recipe!!! I made this recipe, but made my own broth with goat fat/scraps, and cracked bone. It takes a couple hour, but is super easy to make and makes a huge difference.
Just toss 3 chopped carrots, one onion sliced onion, 3 stocks of celery and the meat scraps, bring to a boil, then simmer for 4 hours and strain. 
Perfect dish.

Tasty, however I echo other people's concerns that the times need to be lengthened because my goat was still a bit tough after 2 hours of simmering

This was delicious.  I used my own garden vegetables for the most part, fresh tomatoes instead of tomato sauce, green beans, carrots, cabbage,  parsnip, potatoes all from my garden.  I marinated the meat for 5 hours (it was all the time I had) and then popped it into the slow cooker on high for about 6 hours. Hubby wished it had more spice, I'll probably add chilpotle peppers in adobo sauce next time.

It was not bad. Was not good either. Sauce (tomato paste, vegetables, broth) was tasty. Meat was not. I used the pressure cooker (!) and marinated for 10 hours, but the goat meat was still not tender enough. I like lamb, deer, duck and other game meat, but the taste of this goat was still too gamy. Not into goats, I guess... I did not add additional salt - soy sauce, garlic, and tomato paste provided enough.

This recipe is so good! I've made it several times,
I substitute the meat with beef. Each time it's a hit and were scraping the bottom of the pan. I come from a huge Filipino family and everyone cooks and this recipe makes the cut! Thank you!

It took a little coaxing to get my wife to try this, as she usually doesn't enjoy goat, but we both loved it. The best part is that there were leftovers...that we fought over the next day! 
(P.S. I didn't have time to marinate the meat for six hours, but four seemed to do the trick.)

Delicious! I'm not Filipino but my husband is and I have made this more than once for him and he loves it. He asks for me to make this regularly. I follow recipe as is and it comes out perfect every time. My kids even gobble it up!

So salty, sour, and gamey. I'm not a picky eater and have never given anything less than 3 stars. At the very least to reduce the salt taste, I'd recommend substituting water for the broth.
