Very tasty! I have made this 2 different ways - one with Newman's Own and without. Both yummy! You can marinate the steak with just about any marinade you like and instead of the Newman's dressing you can use fresh or bottled lime or lemon juice instead. Definitely will make again!

Yum! I made the tzatziki, but ended up using a homemade Greek dressing on everything. Fresh red peppers add more crunch than roasted.

This was delicious! I ended up making my own marinade/vinaigrette for the steak and salad out of white balsamic vinegar, olive oil, garlic, lemon juice and herbs. The tzatziki was a little undersalted, so I added about 3/4 tsp of kosher salt. I also made the Pita Chips recipe from this website instead of grilling them.

This is a great recipe. I had some left over cooked steak so I sliced it thin and made the cucumber-lime tzatzki dressing. I served it in a more traditional gyro fashion. My family ate it up and asked for more.

I made steak/gyro sandwiches from this recipe, but only used the steak marinade idea for the meat and then used the Tzatziki dressing recipe from this site. EXCELLENT choice for these sandwiches! BTW..I used sirloin and not flank/skirt.

We had this tonight using left over steak we grilled yesterday. It was fabulous. I had the ingredients, so I made my own lime vinaigrette instead of using bottled.

Honestly, this recipe only gave me the idea of having a steak salad for dinner.  I didn't use any pita and used a different Tzatziki dressing from this site (Tzatziki Sauce I).  Other than that, the rest of the ingredients came from this recipe.  I really enjoyed it.  I had never had a salad with steak before this and I found that I liked it.  The steak itself was really good, too :) I would make this again.

I used left over grilled steak and the Yia Yia Tzatziki sauce,(I already had it made up).  Not a steak eater, but those who ate said it was great and would make a great pita sandwich too. Just scale back on the lettuce and stuff it in the pita. And it is a lot easier to just toast the pita than to heat up the oven, especially since it was 107Â° today! I am excited to try this with grilled chicken next time.
