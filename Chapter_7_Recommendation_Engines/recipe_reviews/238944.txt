I made half a recipe in a 9" square pan and regret not making the full size.  This is really good, the flavors blend perfectly. I do suggest checking in several areas to be sure it is thoroughly baked.  While the center was baked at 42 minutes the outer part needed an additional 7 minutes.  I should have tented foil over the top to prevent it from darkening, but made the mistake of thinking it wouldn't need too much additional time.  Perhaps using a lower rack would solve that problem.  Whatever you need to do to make it work is worth it.  I had never used the Pam Coconut Oil spray before and I must say I am now a fan.  Thank you, we enjoyed this

This was OK but I think it needed a bit more spice for our taste. Thanks for sharing!

I added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter in addition to the pumpkin pie spice and also added a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to half of the icing. I still feel like it could use more of the spice for flavor. It's definitely a moist cake that is quick to put together. BF loved this cake, but I'll continue to use my "regular" recipe.
