Very easy to make, and just delicious! I used less honey, about 1/2 cup, and a bit more of the ginger and garlic, and it still came out great.
Something different to make with green beans, it's worth a try!

Oh this was just a lovely dish. The ginger,soy sauce, honey and garlic all work well together giving the green beans an extra special flavor that just pops out loud. I only had a 1/2 cup of honey and it was still just perfect. Again and again I will make this recipe and this dish will show up at many holiday dinners. Yummy. Thank you so much for sharing.

I'm glad to have another way to dress up veggies.  I only used 1/4 cup of honey and then squeezed a bit more on top of the beans while they were cooking.  I probably would've liked them with a 1/2 cup of honey, but my husband doesn't care for sweet stuff.  1 cup sounded like way too much.  I also microwaved my beans because I had other stuff going on the range.  By the time my husband came in the beans were cold.  I heated mine up a bit and the flavors seemed to come alive.

Was tasty. There was a bit too much sauce though, so i'd say reduce the amount of liquid add some. Especially as the honey liquidfies as cooked. Could work as a base for a Asian based dish though. ^_^

It was a bit too sweet with the recommended honey. Will try again with less honey.

I am not sure that soya sayce is a good choice for a green vegetable.  It resulted in mottling the color of the beans which I often rely upon for a bit of colour  on a plate.  I reduced the honey and doubled the ginger and garlic as indicated in the reviews.  Flavour was ok.

Great flavor!  I'll try it again with frozen green beans for winter.  I always keep ginger in the freezer, so everything will always be on hand.

Good flavor, but a bit too much sauce.  I will reduce both the soy sauce and honey next time.

Made it as to accompany a roast pork loin.  Very tasty.  However, next time I will use less liquid so as to finish the beans as a glaze.  I kept the leftover liquid to use in a stir fry.

I am amazed these were so good--honey on green beans, but they were delicious and so easy especially since I used canned green beans.

I followed directions exactly, no changes.  I used jarred minced garlic and ginger and it was DELICIOUS.  I don't think there will be any left when my husband gets home...

My husband liked these & he is not really a veggie  eater. He said "what is the sweet stuff?" I said "honey." Then he said " I like it!" I was surprised.

This was delicious - I followed the recipe but only for 1 lb. of beans... and I also grated some carrots and tossed those with the beans when in the fry pan, which helped soak up the soy sauce and ginger flavor. My husband, sister and myself highly recommend these beans!

I love this! Ran out of green beans, so I mixed in some asparagus and it tasted just as great. I would use a little less honey, like 3/4 cup so it is not too sweet. 1/2 tbsp of lemon juice also helped with the flavor.

My husband LOVES when I make these green beans.  Very asian-style.  The ginger and honey smell oh so good while cooking in the soy sauce.

This was a great recipe to use since I grow my own green beans and easily had 2 pounds at one picking.

Even though I did not have the exact ingredients it was delicious. I had to substitute tamari and pickled ginger. This is an excellent sauce for the beans but I think I will try it on fish also.  This is my new favorite.
