The soup came out a delicious colour and texture (although as other users mentioned, it DOES take about 40-45min to cook the beets through). Since I had some other vegetables to use up, I added one carrot and two sticks of celery (all grated) to the beets as they were boiling, then blended it all together.

You'll need to serve this soup with something else (ie, crusty bread), as it's not quite filling enough on its own.

Delicious!  One of the best soup recipes I've ever made.  I made the recipe with chicken broth instead of beef stock, and it made the soup a bit lighter.

We had some beets in our produce co-op that we didn't know what to do with.  This recipe was great!  We didn't have enough beets so we added some potatoes too.  Easy and yummy!

After cooking for 30 minutes, the broth had great flavor. Then I blended the soup and it had the consistency of thick grainy pudding.  It would have been great if I had not put it in the food processor.  What a waste of beets.  I even added some more beef stock to try to smooth things out and it was still grainy.

I made this in my VitaMix in about 7 minutes. I micro'd the stock and then blended on high with the raw beets.  I sauteed the rest and added to the mixture.  It was yummy!! Even my 7 year old vegetable hating daughter had several spoonfulls.

I just discovered a new love for beets! I sliced the beets thin, which allowed the cooking time to stay closer to the approximated 20-25 minutes.

Great option for beets in a healthy dish. But make sure your beets are fully cooked otherwise you will get a grainy/lumpy cream.

In response to the review written by gina w. on Jul. 18, 2006.  

I've made this soup a couple times now and every time its turned out perfectly smooth.  I know from experience why her soup came out chunky and it can be explained by the method of blending.  

She mentions using over 8 beets.  I've made the soup with as little as 2 very large beets and with more than 8.  I have also added a couple carrots and sweet vidalia, just for the heck of it.  Both occasions with the addition of more vegetables, it still turned out smooth.  When writing a negative review its important to tell us what kind of blender or food processor was used and whether you were able to liquefy the soup in portions.  Properly.

If having 6 or more beets its important to be dutiful with blending. You may have to do it a couple more times to ensure you've done it correctly. Sometimes if you put less content in a container for blending the blades throw the chunks to the top and regardless of how much time you leave it blending, because the speed of the blades is so high the chunks never get blended correctly.  Its important to reconstitute different parts of it back into other parts and allow it to be liquefied again and again to ensure that its perfectly smooth.

I've used a Magic Bullet blender and had some difficulty in getting the soup perfectly smooth. That's because you have a small capacity for blending which creates more work.  Which often equals a chunky soup.

* Add chili powder to make it SPICY!

This was easy but not exactly quick - the beets took longer than I'd expected.  Oh and I don't have a blender so I couldn't puree the soup, but it was still pretty good.

This soup was decent.    I made it exactly as stated but I also added a shallot to the onions and garlic.  It needed at least 45 mins for the simmering.  I saved time by pureeing the soup with my hand-held cuisinart mixer.  It left it somewhat chunky.  Oh, this also makes nowhere near the serving amount listed (4).  I'm a light eater and its perfect for me: one bowl tonight, and one left over for work tomorrow.  If this was a for a main course or a hearty eater, this recipe would easily be a single serving, and not the four listed.  That said I will probably make this again, because beets are really good for you.

This is something I could eat every day. I used my homemade chicken broth because that is what I had on hand and no cream to cut calories. It was great without it. My son ate it two days in a row with seconds. He said it tastes like 'Thanksgiving'.
added later: I've made this a few times now and find that it tastes better with chicken broth than beef. Also, I simmer it for an hour so the beets are soft. I try to use small beets. A final add: I don't recommend adding potatoes as some reviewers here mention. I've tried it when I was short on beets and thought it dulled the flavor.

Very Good.  Fortunately, I found this
recipe a week after pulling the last of
the beets in my garden.  Fortunate
because I only had a can of beets, but I
wanted to try this.  So I cheated and 
used the canned beets.  I sauteed the 
onion and garlic while processing the
beets (helps to have plenty of liquid in
the processor bowl).  I poured most of
the blend out, added the onion/garlic to
processor bowl and liquified.  Mixed
with the beets and simmered.  I can't
believe fresh beets would be better, but
I would certainly use them if I had them.
  After making this a couple of times I 
was ready to experiment.  Add 3/4 cup of
sugar (I use Splenda) and 1/2 cup white
venegar and you get Harvard beet soup.
I really like it that way.
   Many thanks, DeelightUK.

This is the most delicious soup i have EVER eaten. i made a few adjustments; I used a large box (32oz) of beef broth, i used 2 golden beets and 4 red beets. i cooked it for a little over an hour. While i was waiting for it to cool so i could put it in the refrigerator i tasted the soup while it was hot, it was delicious. an hour later i decided to eat some more of that great soup this time adding cut up cooked potatoe room temperature. soup was room temperature it was soooo good! an hour later i am wanting some more of that good soup, i eat it this time with a boiled egg. soup is cooler and egg is cold. Absolutely fabulous. At this rate i am not sure i will have any left for my family for dinner tomorrow.

This was wonderful! I used canned beats, and onion powder so the cooking went much faster. I also added a little goat cheese instead of cream. Wonderful!

I've never had beet soup before but both my husband and I really enjoyed this. Like another reviewer I used chicken stock since that's what I had on hand, plus added a bit of chopped sausage and topped it with sour cream. This soup was very flavorful for the few ingredients is has.

I added 1 tbl fresh chopped basil and 1 tsp dried thyme at the cooking stage.  At the table we added balsamic vinegar (a couple of teaspoons, perhaps).  With these changes my husband and I liked this soup very much (and I am not very fond of beets).

I used more onion (3), 8 cloves garlic and chicken stock.  I also added 2 tablespoons of red wine vinegar and instead of heavy cream, I crumbled feta cheese on top and omitted salt and pepper.  Guess I completely changed the recipe because I didn't have the required ingredients!  Was a smash hit all the same.

Quick and easy to make although I thought my fingers would be red forever but it came off pretty easily. It was pretty basic but a good soup and definately a healthy soup until I added the heavy cream. What the heck ya cant live forever.

Used an entire box of  vegetable broth, as I used beets straight from my garden and they were on the large size.  Added 1 potato for smoother texture, topped off with yoghurt for a tangy accent to the sweetness of the beets.  Delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a quick and easy recipe when you have some extra beets on hand or when you don't want to fuss around with making "real" borscht.  I definitely cooked the beets for about an hour instead of the recommended cooking time.  I also eyeballed the amount of beets/broth and ended up with a fair amount of soup.    Instead of putting this all in a food processor, I just cooked it in a large saucepan and used my immersion blender to liquefy it.  It turned out a bit on the thick side, but there were no chunks at all.  (cutting beets into smallers pieces helped)  Novices be warned- this can get messy quicky! Wear your apron and be prepared to wipe up spills quickly.  All in all, this was a GREAT taste for such an easy recipe.  It's not "serve for company" soup, but it makes a nice homemade batch of warm comfort food.

I wish this recipe gave you some idea of how much salt and pepper. My soup was bitter at first. After some experiments with small portions of the soup, I added more salt and pepper and some LEMON juice. (from half a lemon) Also I served this soup cool. On a summer night the cooler it got the better it tasted!

Yes, a very tasty recipe.  I used quite a bit of pepper to zip it up as well  and added fat free half and half to the batch instead of "swirling with cream".  Those who find it grainy might not be cooking the beets enough.  Cooking time will depend on the size of your chopped beets.  I found it to be a smooth soup...not as smooth as "cream of something", but also much more nutritious.

This was really good.  The texture was somewhat grainy like others mentioned, but it didn't bother me.  I cut up the beet in really small pieces and it took about 25 minutes to cook.  Then I blended everything into a puree.  A very healthy meal!

I was doubtful at first, but having beets and not knowing what to do with them, I tried this recipe. It is the best soup I believe I've ever made and I make a lot of soup! I had a lot of small beets to use up and cooked them on the stove to remove their skins. In addition to the listed ingredients, I added vegetable stock because that is what was on hand then remembered I had some chicken stock in the freezer so I added that as well to my pot of beets with a bay leaf, and some crushed dry rosemary. Thank you for a real Keeper!

great soup.  I roasted the beets with a bit of olive oil, then after they cooled peeled them.  I used veggie broth instead of beef.  After I pureed it all together add some salt and pepper to taste.  Instead of cream I garnished with chopped spinach and goat cheese.

This is a DELICIOUS soup!! After reading the reviews, I went ahead and simmered it for one hour, just to be sure; and after a minute in the Ninja, it was smooth as silk. I had also added some celery and carrots that needed to get used up, and homemade chicken broth. I made sure the veggies were just about caramelized before adding the broth, which added to the flavor.

This was an easy, delicious recipe. I doubled it, cut out the heavy cream and added a potato to make the soup a bit thicker, and served with some crumbled goat cheese. The goat cheese goes SO well with beets! I chopped the beets into relatively small pieces and had no problem cooking them in the time stated in the recipe. This also froze well! With the potato and doubling the recipe, it made 5 hearty servings.

Amazing soup! I boiled a quartered potato along with the beets to thicken the soup a bit, giving it some more substance. Use veggie stock and this is an amazing vegetarian main dish. Simple, and delicious!

I didn't have quite enough beets, so I added a few carrots and used yogurt to keep it low cal.  I ended up cooking it a lot longer than the recipe suggested, so I'll cut the beets into much smaller pieces next time..  I'd recommend doubling this if you're making this for four as an entree.   This recipe is very easy and the soup was delicious!

Sooooo Easy and oh Sooooo Yummy. I occasionally eat a beet slice or two at the salad bar so when my husband came home from a friends farm and had 5 lbs of fresh beets I was a little intimidated. This recipe is the best!! I served with croutons & a lime slice. So good and you can freeze it. Thank you.

Well...we started a veggie smoothie with lots of beets, greens, and celery that didn't turn out (blech!). In desparation, I went to allrecipes.com and found this recipe. I used vegetable broth rather than beef and a huge dollop of homemade yogurt in place of the heavy cream. YUMMMY and saved what would have been chicken food! Thanks for a great suggestion!

Thanks for the idea. Ultimately, I did this a little differently. I washed the whole beets, wrapped each one in foil, and roasted them at 400 degrees for 45 minutes. Then, holding each one in a paper towel (to keep my hands from burning and being stained red!) I rubbed the skins off and chopped them. From there, I made the soup as per the recipe, (well,almost - I added a rib of celery, chopped, with the onion ) simmering for only twenty minutes as the beets were already tender. While it was simmering, I coarsely chopped the beet greens and quickly sautéed them in a bit of olive oil. After pureeing the soup with my immersion blender, I stirred in the sautéed greens. Instead of heavy cream, I put some Greek yogurt in a bowl, added a splash of olive oil, a squeeze of lemon juice, 1 clove of minced garlic, and some salt and pepper and mixed it up. I served the soup with a generous dollop of the yogurt cream on top. It was fabulous.

Delicious! Very easy to make, I used a bit more of the beets suggested since I had them from my garden. 
Cooked them for about an hour and blended them in my Vitamix. Can't get better than this. Very healthy, and yummy. I made four batches and I am going to freeze it for a cold winter day. 
I love this kind of recipes.

I added some ginger to the pan with the garlic and onions to give the soup a bit more bite. I also threw in 2 carrots for extra vitamins and flavor. After we blended it we decided to throw in 2 small apples to give a little more tartness and sweetness and to mellow out the powerful beef flavor. (Next time I make this I would use chicken or veggie stock). If you want to put an Asian twist on this soup I would garnish this with fresh chopped coriander (a.k.a cilantro).

I got a bunch of beets in a box of produce this week and I wasn't sure what to do with them so I tried this.  I was pleasantly surprised with how it turned out.  I followed the recipe except that I used chicken stock.  If you're a beet person, then I'm sure you'll like this!

My family just tried this beet soup for dinner for the first time.  My 6-year-old son said, "I could eat this soup for lunch EVERY DAY and not get bored...for at least six days!"  I added two small potatoes, grated carrots, and chopped celery as some of the reviewers had suggested, and mashed it by hand instead of pureeing it - my family prefers slightly chunky soup.  (We also skipped the cream, since my husband is dairy-free and I discovered at the last minute that my cream had turned.)   

I'd been worried that the soup would be bland, but my fears were unfounded.  What rich layers of flavor.  If you like beets, I highly recommend this recipe!

I roasted the beets with some garlic cloves first, added 3 celery stalks, 1 carrot, 1 teaspoon of caraway seeds, 1 more cup of beef broth and 1 cup of water.  Used sour cream instead of heavy cream at the end.  YUM!!

Delicious, with a sweetness that was delightful. Did not use cream, and it was fine. Took 45 minutes to cook to the consistency for liquification. This was enough for two bowls of soup.

What a tasty and healthy recipe!

I used homemade chicken stock, instead of beef stock. I also substituted cream with plain yogurt, which turned out to be a great complement to the sweet beet. 

I tried to slice the beets really thin, but still needed to cook the soup for 40 minutes. You do have to make sure to use a good blender / food processor for this recipe, as the beets might still be a little hard even when cooked through. 

Considering the ingredients I put in, this is definitely a very healthy delicious recipe. Bravo!

SO good. This is the first AllRecipes review I have taken the time to write...it was THAT good! I added two potatoes which smoother out the "grainy-ness" some others complained about. Added sour cream on top instead of cream. Yum, yum!

I thought it was terrific, but my husband's only comment was "It tastes like beets." (He only tried a spoonful.) Apparently, it won't convert some people who don't like beets, but those who DO like them should try this delicious recipe!  I used half chicken broth and half beef broth, and no cream, and it was still gently sweet, though not as elegantly served as in the picture.

You should try this recipe and alternate the beef stock with vegetable stock and the cream with an almond milk to make this even healthier! This should help with it not being overly thick. A nice light and very healthy soup

Followed this recipe using chicken stock and 1 potato. I did thin it out a bit with some milk and it came out smooth and tasty. I am going to make this again playing with some flavour additions.  I also used some of this as a base for a mixed fruit (banana & blueberry) smoothie and was very tasty.

I was the only one who liked it between my wife and 1 1/2 yr old nephew.  I thought it was so velvety and simple.  The flavor was just fine and for someone who doesn't remember ever having fresh beets, I think this was a good first effort.

This soup is fantastic! I used Trader Joe's Hearty Vegetable Broth instead of the beef broth for a lighter flavor and as a vegetarian substitute. I recommend cooking the beets beforehand.  They take about 45 minutes to 1 hour to get soft and you can cook them in advance then whip up the soup when you're ready. This soup would also be great as a topping over brown rice or a sauce with some other dish.

Sooo good.  The only change I made was to use veggie stock instead of beef to make it vegetarian, and I added more stock as I let the beets cook for an hour.  I used a dash of 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream to make it even healthier.

A bit too thick in my opinion, seemed more like a liquidy mashed beet. I would try again but will add more broth.

Loved this! Made it vegetarian by using veg broth. If you like beets you will like this soup.

Very easy and very tasty.  I skipped the heavy cream to save on calories and it was still awesome.  Easy to adjust water content to get the consistency you want.

The recipe is not as good as the 100 year old recipe that I found. The broth and homemade noodles are excellent..

yum! I made this recipe as described, only used vegetable broth to substitute the beef broth, as we are vegetarians.    this soup came out fantastic! I also added a hint of dill the cream was the perfect compliment added to the sweetness of the beets.  it made the soup!  will make again, for sure.

I'd skip step #1 and the frying, but not the onion or garlic.  I'd grate the onion and garlic into the broth and simmer.  I find frying the onion and garlic makes it too strong and oily tasting.  As for the beets, love them, but what to do with a 25 pound bag a friend dropped of, I have to use them-up fast. No one else wants to bother with them.

The color in this soup is exquisite.  I added a little red bell pepper, evaporated milk and celery.  I blended half the beets and half the pepper, milk and celery, onion combo and chicken broth and left the rest chunky...delicious....

Even taking the advice of the other reviewers my soup turned out grainy. We still enjoyed it somewhat with a baggette for dipping. I think we would have loved it if the texture turned out better.

Liquid beets, that's all it was....with a bizzar flavor. Not good, texture was that of baby food. VERY MESSY to make and time consuming. It took 45 min. to simmer the beets to tender.

This recipe turned out better than we expected! It has a very sweet flavor, like a very sweet carrot.  The texture is strange, but we may not have blended it well enough. Overall, very easy and tasty recipe!

I make a similar soup in the summer, but serve it chilled.  I use one can of sliced beets, 1 tablespoon of diced onion, 2 cups chicken broth.  Put all in a blender till smooth.  Serve with dollop of sour cream or plain Greek yogurt.  My husband & I love this!

I did my own take on this and made it 5 starts. Chicken bone broth vs. beef broth. And, Instead of turning it into the consistency of a smoothie in a food processor, I left it clumpy and mashed it with a potato smasher. Perf.

I make a lot of soups. This is a keeper. One of the best soups I've made in a long time (and I've been making a lot of great soups recently). I never knew borscht could taste so good!!! I topped each bowl with finely chopped green onions and a large spoonful of sour cream and put a hard boiled egg in each bowl (and I boiled the eggs together with the soup).

One of my favorite soups! I doubled the ingredients because the original recipe doesn't make that much. I also simmered the beets for about an hour. Instead of adding the soup in batches to a food processor, I used my emulsion blender in the pot to puree the cooled soup. This cuts the time of making this great soup and makes cleanup easier. It turned out uniformly smooth. I use the emulsion blender for all blended soups and highly recommend this workhorse of a tool if you make lots of soups.

I read some reviews and added a few things. Sautéed a leek, chopped carrot and celery for about 10mins on medium heat then added 2cups of chicken stock and garlic. After bringing to a boil added beets, seasoned (salt & pepper) and simmered for 20/25mins. Added a can of coconut milk, simmered for 5mins then used the batter setting on my Blendtec. Soup came out creamy and smooth.

This is my go-to recipe for Beet soup. You can add a variety of different vegetables! I also add the beet tops coarsely chopped. I cannot believe it is not in any of the recipes on the web!!! My mother always washed and chopped up the tops. If you have purchased beets without tops then Swiss Chard will do. It can replace the cabbage or just add it in!!! Super easy basic recipe!!

Notes - I used more than double the amount of broth.  I needed to because the beets took a lot longer to cook and the broth cooked off.  In the end, with a food processor, it still wasn't smooth.  The flavor was good but I agree with others, adding other veggies would make this better.   My husband liked it a lot more than I did.

Made this such as instructed with beets from the garden. Delicious! As others had suggested, I cooked the beets for 45 minutes to allow them to be cooked through.

Fabulous! It was easy to make and a healthy recipe. It's a great way to use beets from my garden. I used chicken broth instead of beef stock. I minced the beets and onions by using a "chop wizard" which reduced the cooking time.

I had a package of pre-cooked beets from Costco that were close to expiration and I had no clue what to do with.  I thought maybe a soup might use beets and this recipe was rated highly, so I thought I'd try it.   I was so convinced this was going to be good I doubled the recipe since I had so many beets.  I was pretty shocked at how simple, easy and YUMMY this soup was.  I will definitely make it again.  I highly recommend the Costco pre-cooked vacuum sealed beets. It makes the recipe prep extremely fast and far less messy (no red hands).  

I used turkey broth I had on hand.  Between the turkey broth and utilizing pre-cooked beets, it wasn't quite as dark as the picture shows.  Next time I'd love to mix in some golden beets because golden beets are amazing!  

For reference, 1 medium beet is about 8oz. The Costco package had a ton of small beets which was the equivalent of 4 medium beets.  

I used 1/2 an onion because it was all I had and plenty of garlic.   I added no additional seasoning other than salt and very little pepper. 

I used a homemade turkey broth that was 3rd  batch (so very weak broth), no seasonings, no salt added.

I used an immersion blender, but the immersion blender didn't make it smooth enough for what I was hoping for, so I put it into my Blendtec in 2 separate batches and it was wonderfully smooth after that. 

It was so good and really reminded me of a tomato soup. I can't have tomatoes anymore and this would be a great substitute if I'm craving th

Simple and delicious. I made this in my instant pot. 8 minutes on manual after sauté.  I didn't purée as I like the nice chunks of beet in a broth. I definitely will make this again.

I used pre-cooked beets and the soup was done in 10 mins and tasted great. Also added a tablesppon of aged balsamic vinegar to give it a slightly sour edge and put in a couple of bay leaves, pepper corns and cloves in a spice bag while the soup was cooking to give it extra flavour, which I then fished out before I pureed it.

I loved this soup.  I used vegetable broth and crumbled a beef bouillon  cube into the mixture since I had no beef broth on hand.  I diced the beets and simmered everything for about 45 minutes. No extra salt or pepper needed.  I blended it all at once and it was perfect- thick,  smooth texture.  I added a little sour cream since I had no cream but it was mostly to achieve the look!  Delicious.

Very tasty soup!  I added a bit more broth so that it's not so thick.  I used sour cream in place of cream and it still tasted very good.

Made per the recipe, and it was so-so. Rather thick and without a lot of flavor. I happened to have some homemade pickled beets on hand, and added some of that liquid to the soup. That helped a little. Not sure I'd make this again.

I really like this soup because it reminds me of the beet soup my German mother used to feed us.  It's not too heavy and has a mild sweet/sour flavour without sugar being added.  We topped it off with sour cream instead of the cream called for by the recipe.  I just used my manual masher to puree it since I had chopped the beets quite small as suggested by other reviewers.  I also added one potato to thicken it up somewhat.  All in all it was easy to make, though a bit time-consuming.

This was my first beet recipe ever made, and this was delicious overall. I ended up adding more beef stock to this though since my blender isn't good and it came to a halt while pureeing this as written. I think cooking the beets for longer like the 40-45 mins suggested may have helped the blender issue. I do like the idea of adding carrots to this as well so I will be trying that out next time. This is a keeper!

This was delicious, made with Veggie Broth in a box!
We made it with only 2 teaspoons olive oil in the cast iron skillet. 
We used 4 beets, which we had cooked ahead with their tails and stub of green attached, then chopped them and added them to 1/2 onion and 1 clove of garlic.
We didn't use the blender but it would be fine if you did. It was ready in 15 minutes because the beets were cooked. We didn't add salt or pepper. It's a lovely dish.

Wow! If I was a fan of beets, this recipe would totally turn me off them. Didn't like the texture or the flavor. Cooked everything for longer as the beets wouldn't soften in the suggested amount of time. Even tossed in a bay leaf hoping it would add something. It's a recipe that screams to add herbs and spices, just not sure which ones. 
I've been trying to like beets, and this recipe doesn't do it for me.

I really enjoyed this soup! Great way to use up beets! I added some fresh chopped basil at the end with some sea salt, it was delicious! I read someone else's review who said they would probably not sauté the onions and garlic next time, but just cook them in the stock. I think I agree with that because I thought the oil & sauté flavor was a bit too strong. I think part of the beauty of this recipe is the ease that a person can tweak it to fit their taste!

This soup was creamy and delightful.  Great mouth feel! I will caution those who do not care for beets, you still taste them on the finish, however to me the marriage of the cream and pureed beet enhances that true iron flavor.

I do not like beets but got red and golden ones in my farm fresh basket so I decided to put them to good use. It did take longer to cook, especially the golden beets and I added two med size carrots too. I made sure the beets were soft and had no texture issues others have mentioned. My husband loves beets, he loved the soup. I dislike beets but the soup was actually pretty tasty.

It was my first time making beet soup and I couldn't be more pleased.  I used onions and shallots and let the beets simmer for just over 45 minutes.  I used a dollop of sour cream instead of cream and swirled it around. Definite hit.

What a great quick recipe! I precooked the beets at 300 for about 30 minutes, and also added 3 thinly sliced potatoes. I doubled the amount of broth to 4 cups (I actually boiled the broth before adding it). Try this!
