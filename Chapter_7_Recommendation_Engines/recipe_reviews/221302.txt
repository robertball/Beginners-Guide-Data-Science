I added a squeeze of lime juice to the cocktail and I shook the ingredients (including the ice) in my cocktail shaker to get it really cold. One of the best adult drinks I've had in a long time.

Needing a break from all the prepwork the eve before Thanksgiving, I made this cocktail. It was decent, but would've been better with flavored vodka, or better yet, Malibu rum! Defintely use a cocktail shaker and add a squeeze of lime.

It is delicious especially with orange juice instead of pineapple juice!

You can't go wrong w/a classic! I prefer to use Ocean Spray's Diet Sparkling Cranberry for some bubbles. I rarely have limes, so I tend to forgo the garnish. This makes a great weekend breakfast drink (especially if you don't live in Seattle and can't drink Manny's for breakfast...).

I've had a bay breeze on many occasions with this basic recipe. I do love them but changed it up today by using white peach/cranberry juice in place of cranberry. I also, as others, put the ingredients and ice in my shaker, then strained over ice in a highball glass and garnished with two maraschino cheries and a pineapple wedge.

This drink is delicious, although I do prefer mine a lot stronger than this calls for.

It's very good if you like sweets.  Great for a cool day.  I made 6 recipes of this at once and it came out great.  It was a big hit with my guests.

Made several batches in a glass pitcher and just served them over crushed ice with a garnish. The guests we had lived them!  It was the perfect drink for a steak dinner.
