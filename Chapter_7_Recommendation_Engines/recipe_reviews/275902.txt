This is a delicious recipe, but we found it to be rather dry.  When I make it again I will add liquid, either veggie broth or miso.  I will also add more vegetables, I think some combination of spiral carrots, peas, celery, sweet green, yellow, or red peppers or maybe baby corn pieces.  As a side dish it may be ok as is, but for my vegetarians it was a main dish and needed more.
