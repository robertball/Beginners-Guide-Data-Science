I used reduced fat mayonnaise and I added it 1/4 cup at a time until it was as creamy as I wanted. The cumin was optional, I opted out. The bacon drippings were a stroke of genius. This salad is IN-sane. CRAZY GOOD.

Deliciously different tomato and cucumber salad!  To simplify it, I used a 4.3 oz. bag of real bacon bits instead of cooking bacon and crumbling it.  Of course, I didn't have the 1 T. of bacon drippings to add but that just made the dish healthier.  Omitted the cumin.  Reminded me of a BLT with the mayo, tomato, and bacon flavors.  Just be sure to de-seed the tomatoes and drain off as much liquid as possible before adding to the salad to minimize the wateriness of the dressing.

This is EXCELLENT!  Even the pickiest eaters will love this, as well as those who can take or leave cucumbers.  It's going to be a summer staple and see many pot lucks.

Very nice change from the "regular" tomato-and-cucumber salad. We all loved it. Thanx for the recipe.

This was pretty good but I REALLY didn't care for the cumin, next time I will leave it out.

GLUTEN FREE, DAIRY FREE AND YUMMY!!!! AM-AZ-ING. Refreshing, and yes, reminds me of a salad version of BLTs. Can't taste a strong cucumber or tomato flavor. Just refreshing and satifying ( nice to have a filling vegetable side dish). I left out the cumin. I plan on making this many times to come.

This is more delicious and certainly more unique than most tomato/cucumber salads; thanks.  I agree with marleneb- it will see ample potlucks and gatherings!

This is really good!  Creamy with a nice kick, it was a pleasant way to use up our garden cukes and tomatoes.  We will definitely be making this again!

Omitted cumin, as per other reviews; added dill weed (dry), and probably used more than a TBLS. of bacon drippings, but oh, my- this really does taste like a BLT- soooooooo good!!!!

Extremely yummy! We cut back a bit on the pepper since the bacon we had was very peppery and added a splash of hot sauce to the dressing. Even people who "don't like cucumbers" ate it and wanted seconds. A great way to use up all the garden surplus.

I’ve made this twice in the last week, trying to use up my cucumbers and tomatoes. Get first time, I used bacon, and it was great. The second time, I used prepared bacon crumbles and added the drippings from the first batch of bacon. It was good too. Both times, I added a thinly sliced Visalia onion and a handful of dry dill. It was a huge hit with my family!! I’ll definitely make this many more times!!

Delicious. I did not add cumin, personal  preference, instead I added a little dill.  Also substituted real bacon bits for ease of preparation at my lake house. Still this is a wonderful salad. Second time I made it I added a some macaroni and made it a pasta salad. This also came out great.

This was a wonderful way to change up the summer cucumber salad.  I did change a bit to suit our tastes.  I used half sour cream with half mayo since we aren't huge mayo lovers here.  This was perfect for us for texture and creaminess.  I skipped the cumin since my kiddos aren't fan and just used a little all purpose seasoning. This was a hit and we will be making it often in the summer.

I used crumbled bacon bits and added red pepper, omitted cumin.  It was really easy to get my half plate full of veggies at dinner! Superb!

Not too bad.  WAY too creamy.  If you don't like super creamy colelaw, potato salad, etc. (as I don't), I recommend cutting the mayo down by half.  I thought the cumin was a really nice add.  If you're not sure whether you'll like cumin, smell the cumin first - it tastes like it smells.
