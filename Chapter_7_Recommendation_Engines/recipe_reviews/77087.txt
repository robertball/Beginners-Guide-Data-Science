Just the perfect amount of kick without being too hot.  Served this with "My Crab Cakes" at a party and everyone loved it.  I could put this sauce on just about anything.  I am thinking about trying it with the "Zucchini 'Crab' Cakes". Good stuff.  Thanks BahaTheCat!

This was OK.  It saved our dinner (Fat Tuesday Salmon), but I won't be making either recipe again.

I like to call this green heat. It had just the right amount of heat for me and tasted good on cucumber and celery. Looking forward to using it on other foods.

I followed this recipe until I got to the Wasabi which I cut in half, glad I did too! This is pretty hot stuff.  I have a gathering and did crab cakes so I wanted a variety of sauces to satisfy everyone, the bowl was empty so I guess it was good....to hot for this senior!

I had trouble finding wasabi powder where I live, so I used Wasabi paste.  I added about 1 teaspoon, but it needed more.  Next time I'll increase the amount.  This was a huge hit with raw vegetables and with pita chips.

This was AWESOME. 

I live in a fairly limited place so I used wasabi paste and cut it into half a tablespoon but it still turned out excellent. I actually used it as a spread on shrimp po'boys and the flavor amazing. 

I will be making this again for everything haha
