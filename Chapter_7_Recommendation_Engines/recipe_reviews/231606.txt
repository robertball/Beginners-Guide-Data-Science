Just got a juicer for Christmas, and this is the first non-traditional juice recipe I've tried.  Had to make a few minor tweaks, but this was delicious!!  
My oranges were on the sour side, so I added one red apple, just to make sure that the juice wasn't too sour for me to drink, and I didn't have any spinach on hand, so I added two extra kale leaves (they were huge, each leaf made a ball the size of my fist when they were scrunched up to put into the juicer).  I probably left out a lot of nutrition by leaving out the spinach, but this was a great combination of flavors.  I've only had cooked kale, so I don't really know what it tastes like raw, but for those of you who might be hesitant to use it, it doesn't detract from the flavor of the juice at all!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Oh my goodness!!!! I just tried out my juicer for the first time and made this! Absolutely delicious! It was great not to taste the spinach or kale but being able to taste the orange, apple and lemon sometimes individually. Five stars!

My husband is doing a juice fast, so we've been trying to find good recipes for the juicer.  Like some of the other reviewers, I did make a few alterations to the recipes because we were out of spinach.  Here's what I put in the juicer - 2 1/2 oranges, 1/2 lemon, a bunch of kale (7-10 leaves, I'd guess), 1 green apple, and 1 yellow apple.  It turned out fantastic!

This is awesome!  I actually would add a lot more spinach and kale, because even a cup doesn't make much, and it really doesn't change the taste that much.  Either way, great juice!  Thanks!

Try adding a piece of ginger! That ups the zing and takes this great juice to a new level. Can't taste the kale or spinach but I know it's in there. A win-win all the way!!

Tried for the 1st time.  I loved it. Added ginger and pineapple. I had 2 glasses. Will definitely continue making for the family. Husband and daughter approved (8) . Adding ice, is perfect.
