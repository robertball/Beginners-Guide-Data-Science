This was pretty good and so easy! I did change a couple things. I cook the meat alone, drain, then add the onion because I like the juice from the onion, it adds more flavor. Also, I didn't have enough time to let this simmer for 8 hours so instead I used a 15 or 16 oz can of sliced carrots and skipped out on the celery, so nothing had to become tender. I left it on low til my husband came home, 4 hours later, and dinner was warm and ready to go. The only problem with this was something I can remedy later and thats why it still got 5 stars. Too spicy! I will definitely make this again, but with 1/4 tsp pepper next time. That should probably do the trick. Thanks for the upload! Another easy stew recipe to go in my permanent collection.  Update: Since it was so spicy, adding a bit of water to the leftovers and reheating made it more manageable to eat! Try this if it comes out too hot for your taste.  Update #2: it was definitely the pepper that gave this heat.  Green chiles are never hot, but if you do want to add more heat, then I would suggest maybe adding jalape√±o instead.

This is the first time I tried an unrated recipe on AR and I'm glad I did! We really enjoyed this soup. I did not have celery so I left that out but I will add it the next time I make this. For my frozen mixed veggies, I used a bag of zucchini, green beans and carrots. Obviously with the addition of spaghetti sauce, this is a very "tomato-y" soup. My husband thought there was a little too much tomato taste but he still ate up his bowl and went for seconds. My two young boys both gave this 5 stars, even the picky little one...which doesn't happen often. I did add 1/4 cup of barley during the last hour of cooking. Oh, and my boys enjoyed dipping mini saltine crackers in their soup :) I will definitely make this soup again, thanks for posting!

I liked this stew a lot and it is a keeper, BUT... People. GO EASY ON PEPPER!!! After some review here ( the person said it was not spicy enough) I decided it will be good enough for me and I followed the recipe and put 1 teaspoon of pepper. Oh, how I regretted it. I do love "spicy" but not THAT  spicy. My husband cood barely finish his portion, and my toddler constanly opened his mouth and soon refused to eat it. I tried to save situation by putting some honey, but it did not help much. But to give a good healthy dish 4 stars just because of it would be unfair, because the name of it "Spicy stew". Next time I will put only 1/4 of teaspoon of pepper.

Made this soup as written, except used stew meat in place of the ground beef. Forgot to put the celery in, so just used a few shakes of celery salt, and added a few shakes of cayene pepper for a little extra kick.  Will definately add to our soup rotation.

Neither spicy nor a stew, but still delicious.  It was more like a hearty beef soup.  I like a lot of heat, so I used Fra Diavolo (or Arrabiatta) tomato sauce, but still not spicy enough. I also used 3 1/2 cups of organic beef stock instead of bouillon and water.  Overall, a great comfort dish.

Fantastic soup! I followed the recipe almost exactly. I used 1 cup beef broth instead of the bouillon granules and for the vegetables I used a bag of frozen corn and a bag of frozen peas. There was a little 'kick' but definitely not spicy. I'm wondering if others used the Rotel brand for the tom and green and chilies? I used another brand - 14 oz zesty, mild tom and green chilies. Even using the 1 teaspoon of pepper I would not call it spicy. My one year old loved it! Will be on my monthly recipe rotation for sure!

I wasn't expecting that much from this because of the minimal ingredients involved, but what a GREAT SURPRISE!!! I threw this together inthe morning and it was wonderful!  There was so much flavor to this !  I think I can modify this with different vegetable ( just used frozen mixed vegetables), but I think I  can different textures/tastes with different vegetable combinations. Try this with a dollop of sour cream on top! YUMMY!!!!  This was GREAT!

A very good, easy stew!  I made a few changes based on what was on hand: I used frozen carrots and corn and fresh green beans for the veggies, and I did not have a can of tomatoes with green chiles so I substituted 10 oz. diced tomatoes I had frozen and added some chopped jalapenos and a pinch of cayenne powder for spice.  Very yummy, I'm taking it for lunch next week!

I have now found a new beef vegetable soup to replace the one I have been making for the past 15 years.  That's how good this one is!  The only changes I made was to add extra meat--a pound of stew meat (on top of the ground beef) and fresh baby carrots.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

We threw this together last night and it was easy and AWESOME!  My husband loved it and I did, too.  I can take or leave vegetable soup usually, but I had 2 bowls full!  We used Ragu Parmesan & Romano spaghetti sauce, only 3 cups of water, 1 can of mixed vegetables, no celery, and added some raddiatore pasta.  This one definitely goes in the recipe box!  Thank you!

Great Stew! I've tried it with ground beef and it was good, but it was even better when I tried it with ground Turkey! Yum!

I have been making this recipe for years now.  My family loves it!  The only change that I make routinely is that I use a can of italian style diced tomatoes instead of tomatoes with green chilis since my family does not characteristically like very spicy meals. The italian style diced tomatoes (i.e., with oregano, basil, and garlic) blends nicely with the rest of the ingredients.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! I added a few of my own tweaks however--stew beef instead of ground beef (raw in the crock pot so it soaks up the flavors), a little Montreal Steak Seasoning, chopped garlic clove, and a chopped jalapeno (but only if you love spicy!). My better half loves it, and he's got a pretty persnickety appetite! I'll be keeping this recipe, its great! Go for it!

I love to make slow cooker soups and this one is a keeper. I change a few things. I used 2 lbs. of burger, I added a can of beef broth, cut way back on the water (1 can), added and pack of dry brown gravey mix and a 1/2 cup of barley. This is very good and so nice to come home to after work. The house smelled great! Thanks!

Yummy! It sounded kind of odd at first with using spagetti sauce but this recipe rocks! After reading reviews before I made it I decided to only put a half tspn of pepper. Just the perfect heat. The base of this recipe seems very versitile I would like to try adding different ingredients like pasta shells or potatoes as well as cutting up my own fresh veggies instead of using frozen.  KEEPER!

Really great! I threw all the ingredients (except celery) into the slow cooker. Added some potatoes. Set it on 10 hours, and forgot it! Came back to a great soup! Thanks for the recipe! I will definitely make this again!

Used 1 lb turkey breast cut into 1/4 inch cubes intsead of ground beef.  Also used 2 cups low sodium beef broth and 1 cup water instead of bouillon granules.  Didn't have 8 hours to cook on low, so cooked on high 1.5 hours, low for about 4 hours. Soooo good!! Vegetables stayed suprisingly firm, not at all mushy.

I have made this soup for years and I have never put in the crock pot. Frozen veggies cooked for 8 hours seem like they would be mush. This is a great weeknight meal when pressed for time just heat through on top of the stove and your veggies will still have some substance and it's even better the next day!

Delicious, quick and simple!  I threw this together the night before and turned it on mid morning. Some changes I made were: 1.) diced tomatoes with onions and garlic, not chilies  2.) chicken bouillon instead of beef 3.) omitted the celery  4.) 1/2 tsp. pepper 5.) 1 tsp. garlic powder to the meat 6.) added 2/3c. tiny bow tie noodles during the last 30 minutes of cooking.  I made a few homemade biscuits to go with the meal and served them with honey and butter.  Yum!  Delicious meal!

I am only giving this recipe 3 stars because, although it is a great base recipe, it is VERY bland as written.  I started by adding tabasco and a dash of ground cayenne, but it was still missing something, so I added cumin. I ended up adding more tabasco, and cayenne and taco seasoning. The result was tasty, but I wish I had added it from the beginning.

was not impressed with the recipe as written.  it was a good base to which i added and changed quite a bit to make it spicy enough (as written found it to be very bland) and actually even add  flavor.  i started out doing exactly as posted and quickly realized that something was way off.  couldn't put my finger on it but added quite a few of my own ingredients and salvaged it.

Good recipe w/ lots of flavor. VARIATION: Delicious using 2-3 lbs stew meat, cubed instead of the ground beef (meat is fork-tender after hours in the tomato sauce).

I have made this several times and followed the recipe exactly. It is one of the best stews that I have eaten. It has a nice kick to it but not too much if you are not big on spices. Perfect to throw together right before work and come home to a great meal.

My parents were coming over, and I wanted something simple, but hearty to make. I used an 8 oz can of sauce, a 12 oz can of chunky tomato's already seasoned with garlic and oregano, and for the veggies, I used peas and corn. Awesome! Not much was left from the pot, and had the rest for lunch. Yummy! Definitely a keeper!

This soup was very good.  I added this soup to some penne and topped it with some shredded cheddar cheese to help thicken it a bit.  My family loved it.

Fantastic recipe! I used 3 cups of beef broth instead of water and granules. Added in all the veggies left over from the previous week of dinners. Put in about 1/4 teaspoon of celery salt in place of the celery and only used 1/4 tsp of pepper. My kids even ate this and asked for seconds. Great, easy, quick recipe. Thank you!

This stew is delicious.  It is a versatile recipe since you can use many different vegetable blends. I used a blend of broccoli, green beans and red bell peppers.  This is definitely a keeper recipe.

Good BUT you should know it tastes more like vegetable chili.  Not too spicy at all.  Might be a better recipe with stew meat.  Easy to make and hearty tomato flavor.

So simple and delicious! I used beef broth instead of the bouillon and used half a bag of baby carrots. I also added two serrano peppers and two jalapeno peppers since the other readers claimed it wasn't quite spicy enough. It ended up to be a good amount of spice, (though I would've preferred spicier, but I don't think the in-laws would approve). Everyone loved it! I am only a beginner with crockpots, cooking, and the kitchen, but these great recipes make it so easy to get into it! Thanks for posting!!

This was good soup though I doubt I'll make it again.  I used a combination of fresh vegetables (3 small potatoes and a handful of baby carrots) and frozen (peas and corn).  I also reduced the pepper to 3/4 tsp. since I was planning on giving some to my 15 month old.  I left out the celery out of personal preference.

YUm! This had just the right amount of spice. I did use hunts zesty tomato sauce and reduce the amount of pepper. My frozen veggies were peas and corn. While I liked it very much Dh said It was good but said it was a soupier chili minus the beans.

This is wonderful!  I have made this twice now.  The first time I added a little pasta, the second I did not (we like it better without). This is what  I changed I added two packages of frozen mixed vegetables, no celery and 3 beef bouillon cubes (we don't mind it a bit salty). This has definitely gone into the family favorite book!

This was quite good. My husband really enjoyed it as well. I did not have diced tomatoes with green chiles so I used diced tomatoes with sweet onion and used the called for amount of pepper & added a dash of cayenne pepper. It was very good and I will definitely be making it again.

Delicious! Very practical and easy to make. I used fresh chopped tomatoes, and one hot pepper. Also used half a jar of tomato alfredo spaghetti sauce. Added salt to the whole thing, and refrigerated overnight before slow cooking it the next day. My frozen veggies were carrots and green peas. Otherwise all the same, but eyeballing mostly. The celery was still crunchy when I got home, but the flavours were delicious! It did feel like it needed rice or pasta alongside. So I made some pasta to have with the leftovers the next day. Yum! Thanks for sharing!

Great stew!  It was easy to just brown the meat and throw everything in the crock pot.  It was nice and ready when we got home at the end of the day.  We added a little parmesan cheese to it as well.  It added a creamy flavor to it.  Will definitely make this again.

Made as directed, except omitted the extra water based on the reviews of seeming too soup like.  Came out more like stew/chili.   Flavor was very good.  Served with corn muffins and some shredded cheese (cheddar and monterey jack) on top.  Family enjoyed!

Great soup and I followed recipe except for doubling the ground beef as so many others suggested.  Next time, and there will be a next time, I will cut the pepper in half as it does have too much of bite, for us anyway.  And I will leave the ground beef to one pound as the recipe stated.

This is really good! I added some carrots and a little cabbage and increased the amount of ground beef a little like some other people suggested.  This is definitely my new go to recipe when we want a vegetable beef stew.

This soup was awesome! My kids loved it.  I added some fresh veggies I had around the house-corn, green beans, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots.  I also added some shell pasta during the last half hour of cooking.  I did not use the tsp. of pepper b/c I did not want spicy stew.  I used only enough water to rinse out the sauce and tomato containers and I had to add more water after the pasta cooked to make it more like soup.

YUM!  I used beef stew cubes (next time I will just throw in the crockpot raw, rather than brown first, to get the juices, fat and flavor into the stew), and I did not brown the onion, just put it in raw into the crockpot.  I used part broth, part water - next time I will cut the total amount by about half, or maybe use only 1 1/2 cups broth and omit the water, as it's a little soupy.  Serve with sour cream on top, if you like your soup a little creamy.  My hubs and I loved this with freshly made garlic toast.

This was a very tasty dish.  Didn't find it overly spicey, so when I make it again, I will probably spice it up a bit more.  My dinner company did enjoy this dish, which I served over rice.

This soup turned out delish!  I added barley as suggested by other reviewers, which made it less "soupy" & more "stewy".  We had enough leftovers to freeze two dinner servings for my husband & me.  Yummo!

This was excellent!  Just what I was craving.  I didn't have to change a thing.  My husband loved it, and it was great leftover as well.  Wait!  I did change one little thing:   instead of ground beef i used pieces of beef I buy in the store already cut up for stew.  I just think stew needs beef chunks and not ground beef.  I will make this again for sure.

This is both savory and simple!  I did cut back on the pepper as per other reviews, to 1/4 tsp, but otherwise I made it just as written!  To me, it's more of a soup than a stew, in case that makes a difference to someone out there!

This soup (yes, I think it's soup) is just loaded with flavour and is absolutely delicious!  I found it a little more spicy than I normally like but I do have a low tolerance for spicy foods.  My husband, on the other hand, loves spicy food and says this is definitely one to add to the regular rotation.

Yummy.  I used a bit less water and instead of spaghetti sauce, used a can of basil oregano diced tomatoes and a can of plain tomato sauce.  Didn't have the ro-tell, so used a small can of green chilies. Tastes better than a canned hearty beef stew, but very similiar and homemade!  My kids loved it!

This was very easy to make but it didn't taste that great.  No one was very happy with the flavor to begin with but it did get a bit better after sitting overnight in the fridge.

Followed the recipe exactly, except substituted stew meat, and only used about half a teaspoon of pepper. Delicious, tons of flavor and really simple to make! Will be making this again with the stew meat.

yum! I made it following the ingredients to a tee.....perfect. the only change was to cook and drain the meat THEN add the onion for a few minutes before following the rest of the directions. we like our onions with more crunch. will make this over and over...thanks!

OMGoodness!!!!  This was so delicious!!!  I had to make  couple of changes....I didn't have an onion so I used about 3 tablespoons of onion powder, 3 tablespoon of garlic powder, and used less sodium beef broth instead of the water and bouillon.  I served it with green chile cornbread.

This was really easy to make.  I didn't change any of the ingredients, but I did make it in a stockpot instead. I only used one pot for everything. Simmered for about 4 and a half hours.

A very good, basic veggie soup. None of my family found it to be "spicy" at all. Not a bad thing, I was just expecting it to be a little "hotter". It's more of a soup than a stew but good. The fun part is you can choose from so many sauces out there to add your own twist! I guess if you wanted a thicker product cut down on the water some. Overall, this was good and easy to make. Anything in a crock pot cooking for 8 hours is fun. I wasn't blown away from the taste so that's why I can't quite give it 5 stars but it was a good, solid soup. Thanks!

Picked this recipe only because I had most ingredients on hand.  Definate keeper.  The only  change I made was used frozen corn instead of the frozen vegetable only because it was what I had on hand.

Pretty good. My fiance liked this, so I'm pleased about that (he and I RARELY agree on food...)!!! I'm actually surprised I haven't stumbled upon this already... I own all of the TOH Quick Cooking (now Simple & Delicious) hard-cover cookbooks. Since this recipe comes from S&D, I know it must be in one of them. :) I'm really glad I stumbled upon this recipe. It's budget-friendly, calls for ingredients I generally have on hand and prep couldn't be easier! All I had to do was brown some beef, chop veggies and dump those two items - and everything else - in my slow cooker the night prior. I took my sc insert out of the fridge the next morning, set the sc timer and off to work I went. When I got home, I served up steaming bowlfuls of soup (wow!). One other plus.... This recipe is VERY versatile. I ended up using a 26.5 oz. can of Hunt's zesty & spicy tomato sauce and a 12 oz. bag of steamable frozen veggies (i.e. green beans, peas, carrots & corn) with excellent results. A couple of things to note: Many reviewers warn that this is spicy, almost too spicy. In all fairness, this IS spicy beef vegetable stew (geez!). Second thought. This is really a soup. A stew is thick and chunky. Call it what you want, but this is definitely soup, IMHO. Ranch Goldfish crackers were (surprisingly) a nice accompainment. Thanks for sharing. :-)

Really really good! My spaghetti sauce was only 26 oz., and I didn't have beef bouillon granules, so I just used a can of beef broth (14.5 oz. can) and 2 cups water. I didn't find the frozen veggies to be overly mushy at all and was surprised at how flavorful this was with so few ingredients. This was loved by everyone. My husband keeps telling me how good it was hours later!

Extremely easy and extremely tasty. I had the family over for dinner and they thought I had slaved over the stove all day. LOL! I substituted Italian Sausage for the hamberger and also added 1 lb. stewing beef just because I like my stews meaty. Otherwise stuck to the recipe and was very, very pleased.

I love this recipe because it is so versatile.  For a really quick dinner, I take the spaghetti sauce and and 3.5 cups of chicken broth and a can of chicken breast meat and about 2 cups of cooked brown rice.  Sometimes I throw in some garbonzo beans too.  A little parsley for color and a dash of thyme and it is really a fun little italian chicken soup.     Someone said cooking in the crock pot could turn the veggies to mush but I like using fresh carrots and parsnips and toss in some frozen peas and corn at the end of the cycle.  So many things you can do with this to make it your own.  Thank you so much Lynnette for sharing this old favorite!!!

I love the zippy tasting base to this soup.  I used stew meat instead of ground beef. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written.  I think it would taste better with fresh vegetables but as a quick and easy soup, it was not bad.  Next time I plan to dice carrots, potatoes, celery onion and maybe a cup of frozen peas.  Hubby liked the base to the soup also, we will be using this again.

Loved this recipe! I just moved out and started cooking for myself and I am impressed by how easy this recipe is, not to mention tasty!! I don't really make any changes either... I omitted the chillies and added potatoes, as well as some italian spices and parsley, but that's it. Thanks so much for the recipe;  I will continue making it on a regular basis!

This recipe is very easy to make and very healthy.  I made this last week and my husband already requested it again.  I did add some chopped carotts and used half the pepper. It's already in the crockpot ready to be put on tomorrow.

I made this the first time with only plain diced tomatoes & added chopped green pepper. It was very good. The children liked it.The second time I couldn't get diced tomatoes with chilies so used tomatoes with spicy red peppers & small can of green chillies. Great, spicy!

I didn't have ground beef but I did have 1 lb of ground italian sausage.  Sauteed 3 cups of diced veggies.  Carrots, celery & onions. In place of water I used 1 can beef broth & 1 can veg broth. Added 1 can diced tomatoes & 1 can chilis.  Put in some garlic powder,  2 bay leaves, a little italian seasoning & s & p to taste.  When it was ready I added a cup of frozen corn & some broken & cooked  thin spagahetti.

Made this as-is, except that I chopped up some carrots to add, and also added an extra pound of stew meat, as per someone's suggestion. I love the result, it has a great flavor and heartiness. My fiance said it was just ok, but he's not a big fan of soups, anyway. My only complaint is that it's fairly greasy, possibly from adding the extra beef raw? Great topped with cheese and served with french bread.

After reading all the raving reviews, I really expected more from this recipe; it's not really a stew, nor is it really a soup.  The only change I made was to add salt free diced tomatoes without the green chilies because I worry about the amount of unneccessary sodium in our diets, and other reviews complaining about how spicey it was.  This recipe tasted like spaghetti sauce with a package of frozen mixed vegetables -- very tomatoey.  Sorry, I don't think I will make this again :-(

Delicious!  Through it in the crockpot in the morning, and had a perfect soup for dinner.  I had a 20oz can of spaghetti sauce, and added the difference in water.  Mine was perfectly seasoned, and not "saucy" at all.

This is a great recipe and will be made again.  We will be having left overs all week because it made so much.  The only change I made was that I did not put as much sauce as it called for, yet the flavor was great and there was plenty.  I will probably add more veggies to it next time and maybe a little pasta.

This was easy and tasty! I used beef stew meat in place of the hamburger. I think next time I make it I will just use hamburger since the stew meat was a little tough.

This was really yummy for how simple it was to make. I browned the meat and tossed everything in the crockpot. I didn't have frozen veggies, so I used fresh. So good!

My husband made this today. Extra onion, no celery, 1/4 tsp pepper and used italian tomatoes with green chili.  It was wonderful!  We'll be making this again no doubt, perhaps with some pasta or barley.  Definately a keeper!

Very good and very easy.  Ingredients probably on hand.  I heeded earlier reviews and added 1/2 tsp pepper and whatever veggies I had around.  One can of rotel and because I am in Texas I added 3 thick slices of fresh jalapeno.  It was wonderful!  Just a little spicy=enough to notice but not enough to burn.

Very good!!  Everyone loved it including my son who doesn't like many vegetables and doesn't usually like anything with pepper in it.

It doesn't come any easier or heartier than this! I cooked a cup of elbow macaroni and added that to the pot during the last 30 minutes...scrumptious!!! Oh and do go easy on the pepper...i only used about 1/4 tsp for a very flavorful stew. Enjoy some french bread with this recipe...

Very good.  Wasn't sure I would like "spicy" with "vegetable stew" but this is now a family favorite.

This was pretty good. Will definitely make again. Made for dinner for a few friends and almost no leftovers.(always a good sign). This is going to go into my freezer soup collection.

My family loves this stew/soup. I love how easy it is to throw together. Jar sauce is brilliant and have used Mario Batali's Arrabiata pasta sauce to give it a lot more heat (albeit a little pricy for a jarred sauce but worth it). I have used beef stock instead of bouillon and adjust the liquid accordingly. We only like to add frozen peas and carrots, and do use the can tomatoes with green chiles. We serve it with crusty bread and top it with parmesan.
