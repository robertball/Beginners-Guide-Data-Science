Great recipe - I add a little garlic and onion powder.  You can use egg beaters if you want to lighten it up a bit.  I use reduced fat cheese but any cheese will do with the recipe.  This is great with toast, an English muffin, or inside a tortilla.

For me as written it doesn't have enough oomph. I sauteed onion, mushroom and garlic then threw in the ham. I also used less cheese, just sprinkling a little on top. Served with a habanero salsa in a WW Tortilla. Thanks for the recipe, it's easy to play around with.

This is a good recipe. Fast with great flavor and a good way to use leftover ham. After making this for the first time, there are may other foods that can be added to the recipe if you want to. I will be using this recipe many time over.

Used up the last of the easter ham with this one! Great! I did use a combo of cheddar cheese and pepperjack for some kick! Served with a side of hashbrowns. Yummy!

Good filling for breakfast burritos. I use turkey ham and the eggs, I'll use two egg yolks and four egg whites. If you use a 2% sharp white cheddar, you can cut the amount in half because the flavor of the cheese will make you think you used more than you did. I like mine topped with homemade salsa.

This is a quick and easy way to use up some leftovers.  I remade it with Johnsonville sausage and it was a delicious breakfast. Thank you!
