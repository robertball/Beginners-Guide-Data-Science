This was so good! It was not easy to make, but well worth it. I found the cream cheese very difficult to spread, even though it was soft. Next time I would thin it with milk, I think. I doubled the amount of mushrooms. Also, I didn't grill it. Instead I put it in a 9x13 glass pan and put it in a 350 oven for 40 minutes. My family loved it!

Wow! Fixed this burger for company and it was gobbled up. I agree that it was fussy to make, but I mixed the burger ingredients the day before and so all I had to do was fix the middle stuff and assemble the burger. The recipe is a keeper for us!

I looked at it as an art project and spread the cream cheese with my fingers! Also use 1/2 an onion, its plenty! My wife has had me make this twice and she doesn't like meatloaf!

Very yummy stuffed burger...worth the effort.  CoKo, who omitted one of the star ingredients... cream cheese, has NO business posting a negative review.   Thanks for giving me another ground beef keeper recipe.

This was an okay stuffed burger.  I left out the cream cheese because I didn't feel it was needed.
Try stuffing your next burger with spinach and blue cheese.

An excellent recipe. I'm a big fan of simple dishes with that lend themselves to customisation. I did this in a glass dish in the oven at  390 for 35 minutes and then let it sit under the grill for 5 minutes.

In the filling I used spring onions (green onions or scallions) and used creamed mushrooms.

I brushed the top with my own steak marinade which has a bit of a sour back taste from the balsamic vinegar. Next time I'll add some ground esspresso to my BBQ seasoning. (It sounds weird but it adds an amazing depth of flavour.)

This gave it a very nice mix of complex flavours. 

But there are an amazing variety of changes you could make here. In the future I'm planning on stuffing it with feta/spinach, bacon bit and breadcrumb mix. 

I will say that I can see it being tough to build this loaf without the structure of a glass dish. I did learn a quick tip. Put half of the beef at the bottom and then build a wall as an edge. Fill the cavity with your filling and then all you have to do is top it with the rest of the beef. Worked for me.

This was good.  I made the mistake of keeping the grill on high and a lot of the insides came out, plus the hamburger got burned.  This was my error and not the recipes.  Even with this error it was tasty.  I'm sure a lot better if the cook has more control :)

My husband made this recipe exactly like the menu and it was awesome'  He made it for our daughter last Sunday and all she did was hum through the whole meal.  We have made it twice and will be making again and again.  Didn't change a thing.

Fantastic! The key to this recipe is not to skip any ingredients. The flavor of the chipotle peppers, bbq and the rich filling is out of this world! The only thing I did differently than the recipe is mixed the cream cheese with a little bbq sauce in the food processor. It helped thin it out a little and made it easier to spread. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Excellent!  We loved it!  The only thing I did different was to omit the chipotle peppers because my wife can't handle the spice and heat.  The only difficulty I had was it got a little too done on the bottom.  Perhaps my grill was too hot.  Next time, I might try completely wrapping the whole thing in foil and turn it once during cooking to minimize the burning.

This is delicious!  It took me longer than 30 minutes to prep, but I'm a slow veggie cutter upper.  It was well worth it though.  The only thing I did differently was I used olive oil to cook the veggies in instead of butter.  We put the recipe together the night before  which worked well.  We forgot to put the BBQ sauce on before cooking, but it didn't matter.  It was DELICIOUS!

Made this one a few months ago, and when i took a bite it was amazing, i made my husband eat a bite from mine before he even sat down and he was like NOW that's a meatloaf. We loved it. 
I did make a few changes, i had NO idea what adobo sauce was so i had some fiesta ranch mix on hand, made that accidently put the whole 16 oz recipe in the meatloaf my husband and I didn't think it messed with the taste at all. I did add some crushed red peppers in the layers and on the topping. Again, this was an AMAZING MEATLOAF!

Loved this! Only changes I made was instead of using regular cream cheese I tried using the whipped version for spreadability. And I cooked this in the oven like another reviewer. A total keeper!

Made it just like it says,very good. The second time the only things I changed(added)was I put in 1/2 cup raw diced onion,more garlic and 6 slices cook bacon inside. Mixed the bbq sauce (homemade)with a honey & dijon mustard,cooked it in my weber,on a sheet of h.d. foil with pistachio wood for some smoke,it was fantastic!

Everybody loved it when I made it for dinner! It is a sort of unique stuffed burger/meatloaf. I also baked it in the oven about 40 minutes on 375. I left out the chipotles just for sake of one less ingredient and it was still delicious. I would definitely make it again!

We enjoyed. Next time I will put less hot peppers in beef, add an egg and seasonings to beef (like regular burgers) so that it is more moist.  This cooked perfectly without any filling leaking!

Everyone loves this one!  One change I may make next time is maybe only using half the can of chipotle in mix.  I too had to use in oven made it easy.  I lined a glass pan with the meat and up the sides to create a square bowl.  To help with the creme cheese place in a glass bowl add the season and microwave until soft,  makes it very easy to mix and spend on the meat with rubber spatula.  after everything was in used remainder or meat to cover and press down to create a good seal.  make sure to use bottom of broiler pan with foil for drippings to avoid mess.  Fabulous taste!  Thank you!

Delicious! I used sweet peppers instead and omitted mushrooms, and it had great flavor. The cream cheese really added an interesting taste. I cut meat to 1 lb and it was perfect amount for two. 30 minutes on BBQ was accurate. Try this - it's a nice departure from traditional recipes.
