This is a great recipe!  As I started making this, I realized it was a bit lacking in directions.  After trying to mix the ingredients and having it very lumpy, I put my stove on the lowest possible setting and barely warmed the mixture for two minutes or so. I did not want the coconut oil to completely liquefy. It was just enough to turn the mixture into this silky smooth texture. I put the chocolate into silicone muffin pans like others suggested and then added different toppings to several of them.   Slivered almonds, crushed hazelnuts, macadamia nuts (salted for that yummy sweet-salty combo!), coconut /chocolate chips and white chocolate/ raspberry chips.  What an easy way to serve an assortment for guests.   Next time I'll try cranraisins and raisins.  Thanks for a great recipe!

So yummy! The first time I made this, I heated the oil on the stove then added the other ingredients. After stirring for a little bit, the oil actually separated from the maple chocolate. I made this again tonight, and instead put the jars of hardened oil and syrup in a warm-hot water bath in my sink for about an hour to melt. It turned out perfectly!

Five-star chocolate from a non-maple syrup lover. The flavor of this chocolate does not even hint of maple (a plus for me) but instead is rich and delicious. It is not sweet, more like a 75% cacao chocolate bar. 
I used a silicone mini-muffin mould to shape them. I made a half batch resulting in 10 pieces weighing 27 grams each. After a while in the fridge they harden enough to remove and eat like a chocolate treat or roll into a ball and dust with more cocoa powder like a truffle. Melt in some warm almond milk or freeze. Really, just a great recipe with endless options for use. Thank you for this recipe.

This is an awesome recipe. I changed a little though:
2/3 cup of maple syrup
1/3 cup of coconut oil
1 cup cocoa powder (unsweetened) 
Hope you enjoy!

Loved this recipe! I melted the coconut oil on low heat in a sauce pan and then added that to the cocoa and maple syrup. Put the mixture in muffin tins, topped some with sea salt and others with melted peanut butter. Put them in the fridge and voila!

IF  IT SEPARATES: your maple syrup may be cold, zap in the microwave in 10 secs increments stirring well in between. What happened is that the maple syrup started solidifying  the coconut oil.  After doing this the mixture remained silky and was not off color or separated after cooling.

This was really tasty, I could taste the maple right away which is a plus for me. It melts very easily between my fingers, I think it needs some coating to hold up better, I will see to find a way to thicken it up. I plan to add coarsely ground nuts next time, finely ground would add a bit of protein.

This is undoubtedly the most decadent chocolate dessert I have ever had. A little more instruction would have been good. I consider myself "kitchen savvy". I was a little lost after mixing the ingredients together. I put it in a muffin tin and popped it in the fridge. I feel there could be a ton of possibilities for this dessert. Great recipe and SO easy. Thank you so much.

Yummy!  Heated the coconut oil slightly, in the microwave,  so it would mix easier.  Taste test "Excellent".  Added some sliced almonds, just because.  Put in a muffin tin to cool.  Will absolutely make again.

I have made this for a few years now, the only thing I do different is add 1 cup organic crunchy peanut butter and 2 teaspoons vanilla.   I warm mine up in a kettle just until everything is melted and mix with a wire wisk.  Pour this into a parchment lined 9x13 pan put in the freezer for about 20 min. then sprinkle course sea salt on top.  Delicious!!!  My husband has even started eating this.

Love this recipe!  I gave 5 stars for it's versatility and simplicity.  So very many ways to change this up by adding, topping or incorporating almost anything to suit your taste.  I found by continuing to stir the mixture cleared up the separating issue.  Also, if using a muffin tin (I used a mini muffin tin) line with paper liners for ease in removing the candies from the mold.  For me, the ease of combining the ingredients is also my biggest drawback.  It melts so readily that it's difficult to hold  long enough to eat.  (Definitely will melt in your mouth AND in your hand).  However, this would make it very easy to add as a decadent ingredient in other recipes.  I think experimention is in my future.  Experiment 1 ...Combine 3 pieces with 1 cup milk, 1 1/2 tbsps. cornstarch, 1/4 cup Splenda over medium heat and stir til thick and creamy.  Stir in 1 tsp. vanilla and pour into half cup dessert bowls.  Voila!  Chocolate pudding!  Or Ã§ook to less than pudding consistency and  use as a sauce for pound cake or ice cream.

Directions incomplete and it doesn't tell how many servings.  I like the tiny muffin size in the picture, but from past experience I know pictures can be deceiving(ex:  cooking shows ingredients in custard cups).  Looks easy to try but I wonder if it sticks to the pan?  Need help to try.

Loved by all who ate it!!  I put it in metal/paper cupcake holders in a muffin pan, and then froze it.  Much easier to eat, and it doesn't melt as fast this way.  (I tried a smaller batch using avocado oil for someone who doesn't like coconut.  It's good but not as tasty and doesn't solidify either.  But she loved it anyway.)
To make it more interesting, I put peanut butter in some, chopped pecan in some, put pink Himalayan salt on some.  All versions were great.  A VERY easy and impressive dessert!  I'll make it again.

I wish I m
elted the coconut oil first because it was hard to mix when it was raw and trying to get the chunks mixed was a pain. Tasted amazing though!

Very good.    Made half a recipe since I had my doubts that it would turn out.  Because it is rich, I think a half recipe is just right for the two of us.  We stored it in the fridge; it sets up firm but softens very quickly.    If you want a vegan treat, I think you will be very pleased.  Low calorie it isn't.  But it is tasty.   The directions are vague.   I mixed, with a spatula, the coconut oil and maple syrup in a metal bowl that was placed  in a larger bowl with warm water in it.  This softened the coconut oil.   Once thoroughly blended, I used a hand mixer and slowly added the chocolate.   I dropped a couple almonds in half the mini muffin pan  liners and poured the mixture on top of them.  We preferred the ones with the almonds.    My wife was unable to guess the ingredients; no taste of the coconut nor the maple syrup.   Good mouth feel, good color and sheen, and great taste.

This is a delicious and easy chocolate recipe.  But, if you are not a coconut fan you may not enjoy its "cocoanutty" flavor.  And if you do not feel like putting it in a mold, it is delicious by the spoonful!   I loved it and will make it again!

I did slightly heat the ingredients on the stove as recommended by another reviewer and then whisked it till smooth.  Then I poured it in a plastic bag and put in the fridge to firm up the mixture.  Then I made small balls and rolled them into unsweetened cocoa powder, unsweetened toasted coconut and toasted almonds (separately) .  Be sure to use one hand for shaping and then the other hand for rolling around in toppings (very messy otherwise ;). 
 Then I refrigerated the balls to firm them back up again.  Mixture quickly softens at room temperature so serve chilled.  Haven't tried to make hot cocoa out of this yet, but I will be using coconut milk when I do so it is more Paleo friendly ;) ... enjoy!!!

I really enjoyed this simple recipe. I tried a half-batch to test. I added the ingredients together and put in the microwave in 15 second bursts until the coconut oil was half melted, then I stirred for a few minutes until the oil was completely mixed. I then added to silicone candy molds and made 12 candies (so 24 for a full batch) and I topped them with a little sea salt and they are delicious. And while these are made with healthier/natural ingredients, I calculated that each candy is 130 calories, which is a lot for something so small, so eat them sparingly!

The recipe definitely lacks directions. Changes are necessary when making this. I mixed all ingredients in a mixing bowl, starting at the lowest setting and increasing speed to the highest once the cocoa powder had been incorporated into the coconut oil. I mixed the ingredients for at least 20 minutes. I spread the mixture in a 8x8 pan lined with foil. My final product did not have the smooth texture the photos showed. I am glad I lined the pan with foil because I would have never gotten the chocolate out of the pan nicely. I will definitely alter the recipe in the future! It will make amazing truffles because it is so soft, even after refrigerating. I will also try the recipe using a really good unsweetened baking chocolate, melted in a double boiler and then add the coconut oil to get a harder chocolate so I can share it easier. I will also add only 1/3 C maple syrup to cut the sweetness a bit more. The flavor is really good. The final product is just not so easy to eat without being super messy unless I use a toothpick to eat it with. The recipe, as it stands, would make a really good frosting as a butter cream frosting replacement.

Great taste.  Put coconut oil in glass measuring cup and put cup in bowl of water in microwave .  Melted oil this way.  Added nuts to some and sweetened coconut to portion.   Both excellent.  Would rated it 5 stars except  for lack of directions.

I only had 3/4 cup of maple syrup so I scaled down the cocoa powder and coconut oil to match the syrup amount.   Melted the coconut oil in a measuring cup in the microwave.  I followed another reviewer's advice, I added the cocoa powder to a small saucepan, then added the syrup, then added the melted coconut oil and put on the stove on the lowest setting, whisking constantly.  My mixture did not separate like others said that it did.  I had enough to put into 24 mini muffin tins with paper linings.  Added sea salt to the top of half of them.  Put in the refrigerator for a couple of hours.  We all liked them but I preferred the ones with the sea salt on them.  Will make again!

Amazing chocolate!! I added some coconut and did put it in the freezer to set. Iâm going to try it on strawberries next. Just a word of caution though, itâs very rich, you donât want to overdo!

You have to keep it chilled or it melts in your hand. Good chocolaty taste but I thought the coconut flavor was too prominent. 
It is nice to know I can make my own chocolate, though.

There's a lot of potential here but there must be some missing instructions.My maple syrup separated out and pooled in the bottom under the chocolate.None the less the chocolate came out delicious but I would not recommend it to anyone who doesn't like plain coconut oil.

Melt the coconut oil in a bowl over a pot of simmering water, mix in the honey.  Then just blend in the cocoa powder.

It turned out a huge hit with everyone. Everyone loved it. The first time I made this, I heated oil in the micro then added cocoa first and then syrup. After stirring a syrup in the mixture started to thicken so I decided to heat it in the micro a bit more, but after i did the oil actually separated from the mixture and i couldn't stir it back together. So i just put it into muffin pans and when it harden in the fridge it had whitish strikes in it but still tasted very good. After that i made a second badge without heating it second time and it came out smooth without separating. Both badges tested excellent as i also  added a lot of staff to mixture as sunflower, pumpkin chia and hemp seeds as well as fresh fruits: blueberries i put in the mixture and the half strawberry and slice of banana i put in each muffin form and put the mixture on the top of the fruit.

I melted the coconut oil in the microwave until it was half liquid and stirred until the rest melted then mixed it into the other 2 ingredients and it came together smoothly.  Poured into mini-muffin tins lined with paper cups and popped into the freezer to firm up.  
I've added in chopped dried cherries or apricots, walnuts, slivered almonds or cashews, and unsweetened coconut flakes.  Have also topped with the barest sprinkling of sea salt.  Really versatile, really easy and gives me my chocolate fix.

Amazing, make sure you use pure maple syrup!  

As others pointed out need to heat the coconut oil a little bit, I did the same as someone, put it in a sauce pan on low and mixed until smooth, took about 3-5 minutes.  

Look forward to trying some variations on this, like peanut butter with it or maybe a little vanilla or some mint.

This is something I made for my sister, who is obsessed with dark chocolate. It cheers her up and helps to encourage her to lose weight, though it usually helps her add more on. So, I have been practicing and this was the first try and it was successful right away! I would recommend NOT oiling the pan you decide to put it in because it's not necessary and creates an oily residue. But, the taste is deep and dark, the way ladies love it, and smaller pieces cut would be recommended due to its density and lovely indulgence!

This is sooooooo good!!!! I was looking for some good chocolate and this was so awesome! Loved how it melted in my mouth and had a slight coconut taste. I added nuts, vanilla, and cream which made it even better.

It would have been helpful to determine how to store it after mixing. Melting the oil slightly would have been helpful, and sounds like okay. I just blended everything together. Put some into small muffin cups (12) and the rest in an 8 x 8  and then into the frig with a sprinkling of almonds. All of it could have gone into an 8 x 8 with parchment paper and then cut into squares. Not sure about the best way to do that, as its pretty sticky, but delicious...

I will make it again, using liquid coconut oil, not the solid which doesn't set?
I really like it. Will keep trying to get it to be firm.

It came out like a soft paste. I remelted and then added 2 cups of powder sugar to rescue the ingredients.  A fudge like consistency once the powdered sugar was added.

I will definitely make this recipe again- its simple, easy and a great way to satisfy a chocolate craving if you are intolerant to dairy.  The coconut oil just needs to be melted in order to mix well with the cocoa and syrup.  Then, I poured the mixture into candy sized parchment cups and let them harden in the freezer.

So very good, and so very easy!  
I too would have appreciated more thorough instructions, but will definitely make again, probably in a sheet pan.  I found it is better when thinner than what comes from a muffin tin.

Loved it! Directions didn't say to melt the coconut oil first. That would have helped to know ahead of time. Made it twice. Second time I made half with almonds and the other half with raisins. Wonderful! Thank you for the recipe!

I made 1/4 of recipe to try.  Flavor is great.  I had a problem with maple syrup separating.  I microwaved coconut oil and maple syrup together then added cocoa and mixed it together.  Put it in dish and syrup floated on top?

I had to give this recipe 3 stars, even though it tasted good.  No directions as to how to compile it so I based my recipe on several reviews.  My chocolate did not firm up, only the top half did.  It was good, but the texture didn't cut it.

Wonderfully chocolate!  Mine did not firm up as much as the pictures seem to show, but they are rich and flavorful and a sweet little treat to finish off a meal.  I used tiny paper muffin cups that had to be licked to get the last bit.  I will want to experiment with the recipe further using some of the add-ins that other reviewers have shared.

It may be healthy for some, but all that honey doesn't do it for diabetics. I use powdered Swerve (erythritol). It is a staple for me. The candies are delicious.
