A nice, tasty, simple chicken recipe.  I used boneless-skinless chicken breasts, so that makes it quicker than an entire chicken.  I used only the juice from the lemon (no zest).  Juice amount was 2T.  I mixed all of the ingredients in a bowl, put the chicken in a Pyrex dish and poured the mixture over the top.  Baked at 375 for 40 minutes.  I served it with steamed rice that I steamed with chicken broth and some of the remaining fresh herbs.  There is plenty of "gravy" to pour over the chicken and rice.  Nice flavor, tender chicken.  I will make this again, the family enjoyed it.  Don't make it you don't care for lemon flavoring as you can definatley taste it in the recipe!

Did this with chicken breasts instead and lemon juice instead of zest (I didn't want the flavor too strong) and it was SO SO good! The meat was so moist and flavorful, definitely a hit.

This was good.  I used all of the sauce on the chicken instead of making it as a gravy for the chicken. I would not use the zest next time as it was a little too much lemon.  The gravy is obviously NOT meant for mashed potatoes unless you like lemony mashed taters.

Looking for a simple recipe for a roasted chicken with gravy, I came upon this recipe.  My son covered his mashed potatoes with alot of gravy and was very dissappointed.  My husband and my son did not like the lemon flavoring in the gravy.  The chicken turned out fine, it was very moist.

I thought it was AMAZINGG but i did change a few things to make it quicker: instead of using a whole chicken i did the uncooked chicken tenders then cooked them around 20 mins. it tasted sooo good in under half the time

The chicken really came out quite good. I used a little less lemon zest than the recipe called for and it still gave the chicken a really nice flavor.  Typically you'd want to put the gravy on side items as well but because the gravy has a hint of lemon, it might not go well with many sides.

My husband was drinking the gravy straight from the ladle. I personally thought it was a little "lemony", but he couldn't get enough of it. I will definitely make it again. He insists!

This couldn't have been any more simple to prepare. The 4 star rating is b/c I think the water diluted the flavour of the white wine.

Was really excited to try this, couldn't have been more disappointed. The wine gave it the weirdest taste. Took 2 bites and just couldn't do it. Made sure to read everyone's reviews, good or bad, but just didn't turn out well in my opinion. Just a very unpleasant flavor.
