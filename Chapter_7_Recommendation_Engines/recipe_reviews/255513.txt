Super easy to make. I used a can of Lucky's fried apples with cinnamon. My family and I ate it all.

Only change I made was not adding the extra sugar at the end.  My husband says it's the best he's ever had and has asked for it again.  I'm not a cook.  But I love to bake.  He has never asked me to make something again with such sincere enthusiasm!  This will be a repeat dessert for sure at our house.

Needed to cook a bit longer because I used fresh uncooked apples. It turned out so good my man ate I've 1/3 of it in one sitting. It's a shock because he doesn't care for sweets. I will make this again and again because it's so easy for me, a person with bad neck and back issues, to make. I'm going to try the batter with other fruits.

There was definitely too much butter, the batter ended up too gooey because of the excess butter I think, there was no separation really when I poured the batter on top of the butter. The taste itself it great (although I did add a bit of nutmeg to the batter as others suggested). I will try it again at some point with much less butter, hopefully that will correct the issue.

I made this on a whim after I realized the apples I harvested from the yard wouldn't amount to enough for an apple pie. I searched All Recipes and had all these ingredients all ready. I did mix it all together once in the pan (the butter at the bottom was kind of unsettling and I wasn't sure how it would bake out.)  Is added sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg to the top and it gave it such a beautiful "crust" on top and oh so tasty! My husband isnt much for sweets, but really enjoyed this recipe. I plan to use it with other fruits from our back yard though the summers... pears, plums and respberries!

This was good! I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg to the batter. To the 5 fresh, small Granny Smith apples, I added 1/2 cup dried cranberries.To the topping, I added 1/2 cup oatmeal, and 1-2 tablespoons chopped walnuts. I left out the water, because I forgot. ??

Good quick recipe.  Used can of apple pie filling in place of plain apples. Reduced sugar to 3/4 cup and did not add sugar on top. This is very buttery tasting with 1/2 cup of butter. You may want to reduce if you do not like a strong butter taste.

I'd give it 6 stars if I could.  I followed this recipe to the 'T' and did not change a thing in the recipe. It turned out fabulous! I really thought it would be far too sweet, but to my surprise and my husband's, it was a real winner with us. Definitely a keeper!

It was easy to make. I thought the amount of butter called for was excessive. Next time I will add more peach slices and cut back on the butter.  A good recipe.

This is a great crowd pleaser! I added some blueberries and nuts which gave it a little crunch. I will make it again and use peaches too!

Delicious! I'll definitely make it again! The only change I made was not adding the extra sugar. I really didn't think it needed it.

First time making cobbler! Made it for a work event and won 3rd place in the baking contest! I did have to simmer the apples in a saucepan with butter, cinnamon, and brown sugar to soften them before baking.

Wonderful!!  Sooo easy, too!  I think adding the water & sugar-cinnamon combination was perfect!  Left topping moist, not hard like some recipes Iâ€™ve tried!  Thanks!  :))!!

I have been looking for a cobbler recipe that is easy and delicious, this is the one! I made one change by adding 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg. I'll definitely make this my standard recipe. I added homemade caramel on top after baking, a scoop of vanilla ice cream seals the deal.

I tried to make it twice.   Both times I ended up with a big soupy mess.   The butter in the bottom overwhelmed the batter, then when the apples went on top, the butter did the same to the apples.   I'm not sure why the interior didn't bake or firm up.  I have made other cobblers with similar instructions but without all that butter that turned out beautiful.

everyone loved this dessert.  was simple to make.  My only suggestion would be put a piece of foil over it about 10 minutes before it's done so it doesn't get too brown on top.  I will be making again!
