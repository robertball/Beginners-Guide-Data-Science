Because I did not have vine-riped tomatoes, I used half a pint of halved cherry tomatoes. This is wonderful--simple and delicious. Honestly, I ate the whole bowl by myself! No guilt here......it's low carb and low in calories.

I make this all the time in the summer when the veggies are super fresh! Sometimes I'll use red wine vinegar in place of the basalmic, just depending on my mood. Also wonderful with onions added~YUM!

I've been eating this for years with red wine vinegar and sliced red onion... however, I feel the Balsamic really takes it over the top. I had a bunch of Cukes and Roma tomatoes... ate this for 4 straight days and LOVED it! Wish I had a garden right about now. Thanks for sharing, MOTTSBELA!

This is very easy to put together.  It is light and refreshing and not too vinegary.  The only thing I did different was to add a cut up onion.  Will be making again for sure.

How can I not like cucumbers, tomatoes, vinegar and oil. However, I have never really used balsamic and did not know how it changes the color of food. I used roma tomatoes and and English cucumber to save time on peeling. As soon as I added the vinegar the cucumbers and tomatoes instantly turn a brownish color. I had no problem with the taste, except I might cut the vinegar and oil amount in half. Although, I would not be able to serve this to company because of the odd color it imparts on the vegetables.

I notice red onion in the picture.Not mentioned in the ingredients. This would definitely add to the flavor. I added a sprinkling of blue cheese when serving.

Awesome as is. I also have added a few things as I had a yellow pepper I had to use and a bit of onion to our taste. A little cilantro and 1/4 tsp cumin as I had these around too. Great color and there was not a speck left!

So simple, so tasty. I added a couple of scallions, and hubby and I sat and ate the whole thing! I was looking for something different than my usual sour cream dressing and this fit the bill. Thanks Mottsbela!

My husband liked this better than the other cucumber recipe I use, but I like my other better. This one was good, I just prefer the creamy cucumber salad to the vinegary one.

Made this with asian cucumbers which are thin skinned and are seedless, just wash and wipe the spines off also added the juice of a half of a lemon.  Very refreshing easy salad.

Made this salad many times but never used balsamic vinegar had always used red wine vinegar or just regular white vinegar.  I love the taste the balsamic vinegar gives this salad.  I added half a red onion and used cherry tomatoes cut in half.  It was a wonderful side dish. Will make again and again.  Thanks for sharing.

Didn't like this at all. I'll stick with my red wine vinegar, it has a much brighter taste for these vegetables.

This served as a good starter recipe.  I made this for a BBQ I went to, but I added little mozzarella "pearls" and halved calamata olives.  I also used grape tomatoes because I don't like the mess chopped tomatoes make.  Good stuff!

The simplicity of this recipe makes it an easy accompaniment for most recipes. It is easy to add ingredients to suit the entrée. I made this to be with stuffed peppers and I only added scallions.

Sliced the cucumber really thin, used apple cider vinegar instead of balsamic, added a little fresh chopped parsley and one small thinly sliced red onion. I only needed 1 Tbsp. each of vinegar and oil to adequately coat the salad.

This is a very good summer salad to eat as those fresh tomatoes and cucumbers come in from the garden. Next time I will add onions and garlic, dice my cucumbers, and use white balsamic vinegar.

Great summer salad. I added some thin slivers of onion to it and had it with a barbecued steak. The balsamic vinegar really transforms this from an average salad to a great one. I ate all the leftovers for a simple lunchtime salad the next day.

A nice summer salad to have with pretty much anything :) I added some sugar to cut down the acidity of the vinegar and some dried oregano. I'll be making this all summer long :)

Very good and refreshing for a hot summer day. Since my large tomatoes have not ripened yet, I halved a bunch of my ripened cherry tomatoes. I just mixed everything together and added more tomatoes as needed. Will be making this again soon!

Couldn't be any easier and tastes so fresh!  Like summer in a bowl!  I used red wine vinegar in place of balsamic but that's a minor change.  Tastes better the longer it sits.  Thanks for sharing, MOTTSBELA!

This was yummy and refreshing. I did add some celery seed just because I enjoy the flavor and a bit of sugar as my cucumber was slightly bitter.

I am having out-of-town Vegan guests next week. This is an easy and refreshing salad to have with grilled vegetables and rice. I made today for myself. I added 1 tsp. of sugar to the dressing. Perfect. Thank you for such a great no-fuss recipe.

Very tasty. My husband, not a huge veggie lover, was really a fan too!
I added red onion, garlic, green bell pepper and parmesan cheese. The onion really gave it a good kick, and I liked the bell pepper for the variety. I didn't feel the cheese did much, will not add it next time.
