This recipe was awesome! I de-skinned the chicken and I used half the amount of suggested vinegar and added 1 tablespoon of brown sugar instead. I didn't add salt because it is already in the soy sauce.  I also added a bit of cayenne and a pinch of corriander for some extra flavour. Yum Yum - if you make half of the recipe you will have some coconut milk left for coconut rice which pairs so well. Goes well with steamed asparagus on the side. mmmmm.

This did not taste like the Ginataan I am used to. Definately lacking flavor so I added some sliced jalapeno peppers and patis. Boyfriend liked it- but he's like Mikey, he'll eat anything!

Very good.  Next time I would skin and defat the chicken before cooking as it ended up quite greasy.  The chicken was cooked after 30 minutes, but tender after 45.    The sauce was good before I added the coconut milk, so I might even make this again without to change things up a bit.

I made this last night and it was so tasty, I love the flavour the coconut milk adds to the sauce.  I'm a big fan of onions and garlic so I added extra of both.  I will definitely be making this again!

So, this was delish. Will make it many times again. Economical too. I read so many reviews,  these were my alterations: more onion, more garlic, more water, 45 minutes, not 30, (you'll see where I mean). And YES......pull the skin and toss it ,  AND ahhh... Coconut milk is a must.

Some people said it was greasy so thinking of that and adding flavor I browned the chicken first. Drained the pan put in rest of ingredients returned chicken and cooked.It was for 2 so 2 thighs and legs half cup of wine and wine viniger extra garlic and whole can of cocnut milk. Keep temp low and do not break the milk...Add a little cornstarch just before serving to thickien a bit

Smells and tastes wonderful and it's easy.  I de-skinned the chicken, as others recommended.  Only wish I would've simmered it a bit longer because although it was perfectly done, I kept thinking "fall-off-the-bone" would be even better.

I did not like the flavor of this dish at all. I'm Filipino so I am very familiar with the taste of both adobo and Guinataan so I was very excited to try this recipe. As others stated, it was very oily, and lacked depth of flavors.  I added patis (fish sauce) and it helped a little, but the overall flavor of this dish was still disappointing.

Delicious!  Noting the many comments about this dish being oily, I used skinless chicken breasts which I cut into into pieces.  I cooked for 30 minutes (others suggested longer cooking times for chicken legs, but that longer time would have dried out the breast meat).  Some of the chicken broke down a bit into small "shreds," which was actually nice in the sauce!  Not having whole peppercorns on hand, I used slightly less than one teaspoon of ground black pepper.  I increased the onion and garlic to my personal taste and used "light" coconut milk to reduce the fat content.  Do not leave out the bay leaves -- while not overpowering, they definitely add to the flavor.  This was delicious and it provided generous leftovers, as there were only two of us.  We served over rice, but I imagine it would be nice over pasta, as well.

i like this!! i think i will try it..i wonder if i can add some greens to make it more healthy.  I noticed that on some comments, they said that it was greasy.  I dont think the grease is all coming from the kitchen...it also came from the GATA which is the coconut oil.

Sorry, my family did not like this recipe. It was greasy (even without the skins) and we just didn't like the flavor.

I will cut down on the vinegar next time. The texture of the chicken and flavors melded real well. Unfortunately the vinegar, to me, overpowered the meal.

I used chicken thighs with the bones and skins but a lot of fat came out of the process before I added the coconut milk. I probably would try to extract the fat or use white meat. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great! A crowd pleaser for both kids and adults.

Absolutely delicious!  I changed the white sugar to brown and halved the vinegar. I also served it on rice noodles!  Will definitely make this again!

Bernie (my partner) and I loved this dish.  First of all, if I were using the amount of chicken the recipe calls for, I would make 1.5  or 2 times the sauce. I used chicken thighs and legs removing the skin and excess fat.   I did reduce the vinegar to 1/2 cup but went by the recipe for the remaining ingredients.  I found I had to  increase the cooking time of the chicken by approximately 10 minutes.  I reduced the sauce by more than the recipe recommended which gave it much more depth in flavour.  When I added the coconut milk, I also added some sweet red, yellow and orange peppers that I had sautéed briefly.  About 2 minutes before the sauce was done, I added a cup of frozen sweetlet peas for colour.

I used apple cider vinegar instead of regular vinegar, I used chicken broth instead of water and low sodium soy sauce.  I served over rice and my whole family liked it!
