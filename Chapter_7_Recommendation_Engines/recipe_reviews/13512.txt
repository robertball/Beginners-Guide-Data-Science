The only changes I made was to use jarred artichoke hearts, and bagged mixed salad leaves. If I were to make this again, I wouldn't bother with the potato - it was an odd addition that didn't really fit with the other ingredients. Thanks, Christine!

Delicious!! The only thing I changed was, my family enjoys raw fennel and raw carrots, so I did not boil them before adding.  I also only had marinated artichoke hearts which I rinsed & tossed in. (Next time I will use frozen) This salad was fresh and crunchy! The diced potato (I used Yukon Gold), and cut up fontina cheese provided surprises of flavor & texture!  My VERY picky daughter just loved it, too!

Classic, can't go wrong. Don't forget to add a slice of lemon while cooking the artichoke and fennel. Thanks Christine L. for the recipe.

Delicious. Typical salad found in bars/caf√©s in Italy for a quick but filling lunch. I used Pecorino Romano shavings instead of Fontina. Make sure to add a squeeze of lemon to the water when cooking the fennel and artichoke and don't overcook any of the veggies, they need (including the potato) to be firm. This is a crunchy salad. Thank you for the recipe Christine L.
