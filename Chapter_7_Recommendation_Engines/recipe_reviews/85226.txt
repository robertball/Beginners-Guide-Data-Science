Surprisingly good!  A different way to use the beets in my garden; looks like a restaurant salad on the plate.  The toasted walnuts makes the salad.

My kids and I did not like this recipe!  My hubby thouight it was OK - but I won't be making it again.  I had beets from our farm co-op and didn't know what to do with them.  This wasn't the thing.
