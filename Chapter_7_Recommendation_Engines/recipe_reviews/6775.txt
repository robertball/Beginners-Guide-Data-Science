Great little recipe! And it was a nice way to use up some ripe bananas! I used half brown sugar and half white sugar, buttermilk (sour milk) and added a nice splash of vanilla for good measure. Very tasty with a cup of tea!

Besides giving me another way to use up sour milk, which I often do end up with, this was an excellent banana bread, simple to prepare, with a wonderful flavor.  I've come back to this recipe more than a few times, and always am happy with the results, as are those I serve it to.

Nice and basic. I used butter instead of margerine. I made them into muffins to freeze for my husband's lunch.

Excellent flavor!  I replaced one third of the flour with whole wheat, and reduced the sugar by about 1/4 cup - still ended up with a very sweet banana bread.  I was very careful to mix until JUST blended - I tend to overmix everything. Great texture, very moist, a little crunch on the outside and overall great taste.  Thanks for sharing!

I made the recipe exactly as stated and was VERY pleased. So much so that I didn't even miss the nuts I usually consider a must in my quick breads. It was very moist and the slightly crunchy top and sides add a whole other dimension. I'll definitely be adding this to my recipe box - the actual one - not just my virtual one here! And I'll be making this for gifts this Christmas as well.

Excellent. My husband and I are traditionalists, and this was just what we needed to partner with tea and/or coffee. Either way, the recipe is simple to make, easy to orchestrate, and the results were right on time.

Made this into muffins because I didn't have a loaf pan.  Which worked out perfectly! Made ten muffins.  Followed the recipe perfectly, but they came out a little less sweet and banana-y then I would have liked. (Probably because I love everything really sweet)  Next time I think I'll throw in even more banana and maybe a tad bit more sugar.

It was a simple and delicious recipe. Comes out soft and moist with a little crisp around the edges.

This tastes soooo yummy. I ate almost half the loaf instead of saving it for a family get together. I still got rave reviews from my mom and cousins from what was left for everybody, but I ended up buying over ripe bananas so I can make some more.

I used butter and added 1 Tsp. of baking powder. This Banana Bread has a good moist texture with a nice sweet flavour.  It has a nice golden crust that is delightfully crisp. I wrapped half of the loaf in plastic wrap and left it over night and the outcome was a super moist, soft crust lovely banana bread.  Thanks!

I made five loaves today as gifts for people who have helped me when I was in the wheelchair. I do not ever make a recipe for gifts that I haven't tried before, but I did today. I got raves from everyone. I also heard that people ate it plain and didn't use butter or jam. Thumbs up! I'd give it 6 stars.

This is a very versatile banana bread recipe. I felt like it needed some cinnamon and chopped walnuts. These ingredients were added in and I got rave reviews from my hubby and my co-workers. This is most definitely going to be my go to banana bread recipe! Thanks for sharing.

Really easy and really good!  The only thing I did differently was I cut the sugar by 1/4 cup.

I love this banana bread. Everyone in my family eats it up. I use butter and 3 very very ripe banannas. I usually cook this in my convention oven for an hour. I have made huge muffins and added chocolate chips with this recipe and they were also delicious. Since finding this I have used no other recipe

Followed the recipe exactly.  Very moist inside, slightly crunchy crust. It was a dense or heavy bread, not light & fluffy like a cake.  Would also be great with nuts.

I just got done making this gorgeous banana bread . Like to try different recipes out. Saw this thought it would be simple, well i guess maybe. Didn't last long in my house. I would rate this a 10 star. Will give this to my friends here in Vermont.
