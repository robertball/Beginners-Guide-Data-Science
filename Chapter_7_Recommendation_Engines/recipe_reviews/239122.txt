Why do you need to make so much pastry that you aren't going to use for this recipe, 1/2 the pastry will do. 
Pastry does not turn into dough, it needs more water. 
Filling has too many raisins and isn't enough to fill all tart shells.

They were very good , and will make them again.  I will try and put more liquid in them next time, as they were a little dry, as  I did have liquid left over, but afraid they would boil over.

I substituted 1/2 butter for the crust - I think this would be the ideal pie crust as it's very flaky. For butter tarts I tend to prefer a thicker, tougher crust. I had a difficult time figuring out how much to roll out the crust... I made one too thin and then a second batch too thick.

The filling rises quite a bit, so measure accordingly!
