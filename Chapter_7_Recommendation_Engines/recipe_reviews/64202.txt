I've been making this Near East recipe for about two years now and saw it on the website and thought I would comment on the easiness and the versatility of it.  The recipe as described is easy and tasty.  A George Foreman grill comes in handy of preparing the chicken and I like to add some spices to the chicken such as cumin, salt and pepper before grilling.  I prefer to serve as the stuffing to make a burrito.  Just get some 10" tortillas, spread some sour cream and/or guacomole on the tortilla and then add some of the Santa Fe Chicken Pilaf, some cheese and you have a burrito.  Easy dinner.

Soooo good. Just made it for two people so I only added about 1 cup of the fresh tomatoes. Seasoned the chicken with some Emerils chicken rub and used the garlic and herb Near East rice pilaf. Mixed everything up and rolled into burritos, very flavorful, easy and filling. Highly recommend.

I thought this recipe was a little bland even though I added extra cumin, and my husband did not like it at all!  The first night we put it in tortillas like other reviews suggested, the next night I put in on corn chips and covered it with cheese and jalapenos to make nachos.  I liked it as nachos much better.

This recipe is great and so simple!
I did do it a bit differently,though. I didnt use the specific rice pilaf,but i still used rice pilaf. I used canned  diced tomatoes in olive oil instead of fresh. I also added a bit of taco seasoning.
I just mixed everything together and put it in a tortilla with sour cream and cheese.
My whole family loved it, even my two year old foster sister who hates veggies!

My husband and I have this for dinner quite often.  I cut up individually frozen checken breasts, sprinkle with Cajun seasoning, and then cook the chicken in olive oil in a skillet. Other than that, I just follow the recipe.  Its quick, healthy, and makes great left overs.

It was good but not anything to get excited about.  I wouldn't make it for guests but it was good for our family.

I use this dish pretty frequently... it reheats extremely well, which makes it good for pre-made work lunches. It's also pretty healthy and very easy to make.

This was very tasty- but the prep time of 10 minutes is a bit low.  I boiled the chicken and added it to the mixture along with fresh onion and cilantro.   My husband really liked this, I will definitely make it again.
