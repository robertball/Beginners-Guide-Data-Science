Excellent!  Chicken kiev is always time consuming to prepare but is worth it if you use some TLC.  Shape the butter into logs and freeze before using, easier to stuff the breast and less likely to leak out while cooking.  I added 1 tbls lemon zest to the butter to increase the lemon flavor.  After assembling if you have time, put the chicken in the fridge for an hour, this lets the seam set and greatly reduces the chances of the butter leaking out.  Instead of deep fat frying, I browned the breasts in a skillet in olive oil and butter than baked for 20-30 minutes.  They also freeze beautifully so make a double batch and freeze one batch so you can enjoy them quicker the next time.  Just add 5-15 minutes to the baking time.

Prior to using a recipe from this web page I like to read the reviews.  I took a few things into account, like not lemoney enough and to filet the chicken breasts.  I did not have fresh herbs so I used dried ones and added one more tsp of lemon juice.  I also prefer my chicken kiev baked so I added some extra virgin olive oil to the bread crumbs prior to the coating step.  I then baked for 30 minutes at 350 degrees.  They were so good my 5 and 3 year olds made up a new word to describe how good this was.  My husband thought they were better than the store bought brands...definitely will make these again....They were a big Valentine's Day HIT!!

Good when stuffed and baked. I've never had good luck flattening chicken evenly so I cut a slit and pocket in each breast and pushed, squeezed or otherwise injected the butter/chive/parsely mixture in the pocket. It didn't leak out and still kept the chicken moist. It looks very impressive when done and tastes great!

Delicious! I added some dill to the bread crumbs, and opted to bake rather than fry (375 degrees F / 190 degrees C for 30 to 40 minutes) for a healthier version.

Make sure you flatten the chicken very thin or you'll have difficulty rolling it into a neat packet.  I used a seasoned bread crumb mixture I had on hand and probably should have stuck with the recipe.  The herb/butter mixture deserves the 5 stars in this recipe!  Very good...will definately try again sticking a little closer to the original recipe.

My mother used to make this when I was a little girl and we always loved it. I made this for her birthday dinner this year and it was awesome. I made these changes though: *used tarragon instead of chives (so yummy) *added 2 tsp of minced garlic to butter *after rolling, I refrigerated them overnight and they set real well. When I was ready to cook them, I put them on a wire rack on a baking sheet and sprayed them with cooking spray. Then baked them at 375 for 30 minutes.  It was awesome...so yummy. And they didn't leak!  I rolled them into logs like someone else suggested and also placed them seam side up. Only problem was how to flatten the chicken without tearing it.

this is the first time that I ever made this dish, I diidn't fry it, I drizzled with olive oil and baked it at moderate heat for about 25 minutes. It's very good and not at all greasy like I thought it would be. I used a mixture of Italian bread crumbs and panko crumbs and so it was really crispy. Thanks for a great recipe. I would have rated this 5 stars, but never having it beofre, I had nothing to compare it to.

This was extremely good!  I made more butter then was called for in order to double stuff the chicken.  Turned out great and it was extremely buttery inside!  Loved it!

I gave this recipe 4 stars when in reality it merely gave me a guideline and I took it and ran with it.  My butter was from a tub of flavored herb butter I got as a Christmas gift, and I flavored my bread crumbs with seasoned salt.  And finally, I took another reviewer's suggestion and merely pan seared in a little oil, to brown and crisp up the crumbs, rather than deep frying, and finished it in the oven.  I've never made chicken kiev where the butter didn't completely leak, but cooking it in a small pan and spooning the liquid butter over the finished chicken was pretty darn delicious!

The directions made this complicated recipe easy to follow. I also sauteed the kievs in olive oil before baking them at 350 for 20 minutes--came out perfectly. Thanks!

After reading reviews - I chose 2 variations ... I filleted the breasts and chose baking vs. frying.   - This was good! I did premake the butter mix and used any extra for my accompanying rice.

Fantastic!  I didn't have chives on hand, so I used parsley, basil and garlic to season the butter.  Wrong?  Maybe, but it was delicious!

Wow, this is real Chicken Kiev!  Even without the fresh herbs, this recipe is great!  Made it for my parents and they just loved it.

It definitely needs something – some kind of sauce with it.  The breading could use a little kick as well. Is there such a thing as strongly bland? Perhaps my expectations were too high. I’m going to have to play with it a little more before I can say I would serve it to guests.

The taste was sensational, but I am such a klutz when it comes to rolling up chicken breasts.  I filet them, pound them thin, but it never looks like the pictures.  I used fresh lemon peel, garlic, chives, parsley with the butter, it was so tasty.  This recipe is definetely a keeper.

Thank you so much for this recipe. I always looked forward to eating this dish when went out to eat, now I have an awesome recipe for Chicken Kiev that a restaraunt would have a hard time beating!! Everyone loved it. The only suggestion I would make is that fileting would probably make it a little easier. Thanks again!

This recipe is exceptional for adult company.  I fileted the chicken breasts rather than pounding them and they were DIVINE!  We will have these again for sure!  Oh, yum.

Wow, just delish! I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe. It took me awhile to be sure the chicken was completely cooked, but with thinner chicken breasts I think I'd get a better end result, but besides that, it was very yummy and a big hit with my mom! ;) Thanks for posting!

What, no garlic?  I don't like mine rolled in bread crumbs, but simply egg wash and flour to fill the seams so the butter doesn't leak.  Just before cooking, try rolling them in eggwash again and roll in Panko.  Yum

Great recipe. Ditto to the comments about flattening to a 1/4 of an inch or so. I left mine too thick and had to re-fry some of them which was a bummer.

I wish that I had read the reviews before I made this dish, but I was in a hurry.  As written, this is a 3-star recipe and not worth the effort.  If I make these again, I will filet the breasts or bake in the oven as others have suggested. Mine took anywhere from 12-15 minutes to cook and were nearly burnt on the outside.  I will also use lemon zest instead of lemon juice.  I used real butter and could not get the lemon juice to incorporate into the butter.  This might be okay to try again with some adjustments.

It was OK. I have an old recipe, but it is quite time consuming. I was hoping for a quick way to a delicious end. Really good Chicken Kiev takes time.

I baked it instead of frying it and just drizzled a little bit of Olive Oil on top before cooking to help with the browning.  I also didn't use an egg wash, I just used Skim Milk instead.  And also used a less fat butter.  All to make it a little healthier.  I also used more seasoning then the recipe called for.
