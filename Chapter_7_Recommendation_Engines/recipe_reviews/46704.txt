I do apologize for the confusion about "Ranch Style" beans.  I live in Oklahoma and you can buy this in the grocery store, they're canned beans with a more hearty flavor.  But...if you can't find them where you live, any type of canned beans will be fine.  Petra Dixon.

Maybe this will help with "Ranch Style Beans".  I'm from Texas but live in New Hampshire right now.  I found that WalMart has a similar item to the Ranch Beans (that you can't get here)and they are called "Chili Beans".  The WalMart brand can says "small red beans in a spicy tomato sauce".  Hope this helps everyone.

This recipe is the bomb - awesome!  Had to wing it a bit: used 1/2 (8oz.) Hillshire Farm turkey smoked sausage and no ham.  I prefer to cube the sausage rather than slice -- just cut slices about 5/8" thick and then quarter them -- easier to spoon up too!  Used 3/4 cup rice (which didn't cook up completely, but that was alright), 1 can of the tomatoes, and 1 can of spicy chili beans.  Didn't have any thyme or bay leaf, but did add a couple shakes of crushed red pepper.  This cooked up real spicy and would have been great with or without the beans, IMO.  Good stuff - thanks!

Pretty tasty stuff Petra! I followed the recipe to the letter and we all enjoyed this dish, with the exception that we thought there was too many beans. Next time, 1 can of ranch-style beans will be plenty. Thanks!

Yummy! I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, so i skipped the green pepper and used carrots instead, no sausage, used double ham. Used regular diced tomatoes and added lousinanna hot sauce for heat. Also used pepper, majoram, and basil. Easy and tasty!

I used one chicken breast for the ham but left the sausage. Turned out to be a really good, quick dish. Might be better with one less can of beans, though.

Made with 9 oz of sausage and pinto beans, doubled the peppers and omitted the celery. This wasn't too bad but not the best either.

Wasn't sure on the Ranch Beans and didn't read the reviews before making, so I used ranch style green beans that are similar to "french cut" green beans.  These worked incredibly well!  Added shrimp and used the Extra Hot Rotel's and WOW was this great!

This is great,I will definitely make it again. It was so easy to make. I had leftover ham and polish sausage and it was a great way of using it up. Thanks for a great recipe.

So yummy! I've made this several times to the letter and it is always a crowd-pleaser. Today I tried it with chicken and shrimp, instead of ham or sausage, with only one can of Ranch-style beans and it was great!

Excellent! Easy recipe to make with a few substitutions just based on personal flavor. Just used water in place of chicken broth. Used 1 can of ranch style beans and 1 can of low sodium black beans. I did add in a Tablespoon of chilipowder for just a bit extra kick. My three year old loved it.  Thank you to Petra for sharing the dish!!  100% better than the out of the box dish.

very hearty & tasty ~ I used 1 each, hot, mild & plain diced tomatoes.  didn't have any green pepper or celery or smoked sausage.  I used chorizo & browned it first.  This had wonderful flavor definitely a keeper.

We loved it!  Used brown rice (healthy!). Found that pouring in tomatoes with liquid from the can resulted in a lot of liquid in the recipe. Liquid never really absorbed. Next time, might drain can (of tomatoes) first.

My family did not like this recipe very much and I even used the spicy kielbasa and some crushed red pepper to jazz it up.  They said they like the Zatarain's Jambalaya box mix better, so I won't knock myself out trying to make it from scratch again.

This was AWESOME!!!!  I followed the recipe, except I used one can of Jalapeno Ranch Style and one regular can because we like a lot of heat!  This will definitely become a regular favorite!

This is another family favorite from this great site! I've made this several times for my family of men and they loved it. It's not too warm. I used turkey sausage and a large Pot. Thanks Petra!

Made with extra veggies, brown rice, all smoked sausage, and no ranch beans to be found so I used chili beans. I don't know if they're a reasonable substitute, but it came out really tasty, so we'll do it that way again. I baked mine (using brown rice) for 2.5 hours because I prefer these sorts of things as a baked casserole :) Thanks for sharing!

Good flavor.  I changed a few things though.  I only used smoked sausage (Hillshire farm hot smoked sausage).  I thought about andouile, which I may try next time.  I left out the celery and used red instead of green pepper, because in my opinion green peppers have no flavor.  I used rotell mild diced tomatoes and bush's chili beans.  Also substituted the chicken broth with 3/4 cup Sam Adam's Black Lager.  I just like cooking with beer. :)

The Texas Jambalaya was absolutely fabulous!!! It has the perfect amount of flavor and a nice spicy kick. Everybody in my family took many helpings. I only used 1 can of ranched style beans, and also used less sodium chicken broth. This is a definite keeper!!

Great flavor, but too spicy for us (and we like spicy) and the rice took an additional 20 minutes to cook so it all got a little mushy.  Will try again, though, with mild Rotel and cooking the rice separately.

We really like making this dish, and it makes a lot of delicious leftovers.  We have made it with jalapeno smoked sausage and with andouille and it was good with either.

This made for a super easy and fast dinner.  I only had 1 can each of ranch beans and rotel on hand but found it was enough.  I also added the juice from the beans in with the other liquids so it could cook off.  Just personal taste, I don't like my rice dishes mushy.  Thanks

This was absolutely fabulous! I added to chicken breasts, cut up, of  course, and I cooked the rice separate and stirred it in at the end. I also used Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning, a whole package of smoked sausage and an 8 oz. package of diced ham. Very meaty and it made ALOT!

I make this regularly for our city mission free lunch program - ALWAYS A HIT!!  I make enough to serve 75 - 100 people and we never have any left!  Very economical to make large batches!  A definite favorite! Thank you!  I make it spicy but not hot and have hot sauce available for those who wish to spice it up more.  Thank you!

This was easy and good though it took me longer to cook than I expected.  It might have been because I used brown rice instead of the converted long-grain rice (decided against buying the converted rice since it was $7.65 for one box).  I used red bell pepper instead of green and left out the celery since I don't like cooked celery.  We had it with crusty rolls though I'm sure it would be better with corn bread.

This is an awesome recipe. I didn't follow amounts to the letter and used black beans and kidney beans.I increased the rice by 1/2c. and used a whole can of broth. This will definitely be a recipe I use on a regular basis.

My husband and I loved this! I did leave out the diced tomatoes and chiles, and added some fresh chopped tomatoes instead (I needed to use them). I think it cut back on the spice and my children (3yrs and 12mos) at it also. Very easy!  I even forgot to stir in the beans and it was still very yummy! I will definitely make this again. :-)

Very good!  We only used one can of Ranch Style beans.  We also only used one can of Mild Rotel with one can of plain diced tomatoes, and it was still a tad bit spicy for our kiddos.  Us big kids really loved it though! ;)

Very good, I did change the meats to andouille, chicken & shrimp because my family prefers it.  I did add a little cajun seasoning as well for an extra kick.

This was good, my husband loved it.  Spicy, but not too much for my kids.  I left out the sausage, and I only had one can of the tomatoes with chiles, so I added one can of plain diced.  I also only added one can of beans.  They are what make the recipe!  Good, and easy!

This recipe was absolutely delicious and was easy to make!  I was really confused as well with what "Ranch Style" beans are (I'm from the north), so I didn't use any beans and it was still delicious.

This is a wonderful hearty meal for dinner or lunches.  I would like some recomendations for more flavor.  Useing a higher quality smoked sauge is important.  What is a ranch-bean (ranch style bean)?  I could not find the answer so I subsituted a pinto beans, not bad but am I miising something by not using a ranch bean?  Thanks for the recipe :)

I tweaked this recipe quite a bit to accommodate what I had on hand. I used beef sausage with no casing, no ham, and only one can of Rotel. I also used beef broth instead of chicken, orange pepper instead of green, and Mahatma yellow rice. The rest was exactly the same as the recipe suggested. It was very colorful, tasty and hearty. Will definitely make this again and glad I found the recipe.

I did not have green pepper or celery each time I made this, 3 times. But, I had everything else and one time I used H EB hatch Chile sausage and I had some left over  Chicken ticklers, which has a jalapeno with a chicken breast wrapped around it and bacon wrapped around that I just diced all  the leftovers and added either HEB jalapeno or hatch sausage. I used 2 cans of Ranch Style beans, 1 can of spicy Rotel and one can of diced green chilis. I added one package of jambalaya rice and seasoning with one cup of rice and 1.5 cups chicken broth. Yeah lots of tweaks here and there but an awesome base! We love it and it's in my favorite recipes. Serve with cheese biscuits or cornbread

Made this for dinner tonight and the family loved it. My wife asked me to make it again “real soon”. I added a half cup of frozen corn and it worked into the flavor nicely. The only substitution I will make in the future is to go with one can of ranch beans and one can of pinto beans. (The recipe as is, the ranch beans kind of over powered everything else flavor wise.)

I love it. Followed recipe. Only think that might have changed is the sausage. We use reindeer spicy sausage a majority of the time in our cooking. Also substituted shrimp for ham, only because I don't like the taste of ham.

I have made this recipe more than once. My family loves it. I have substituted chicken breast when I didn’t have ham and added small deveined shrimp. Also I use 1 can of diced tomatoes and 1 can of diced tomatoes with green Chile’s so it’s not quite as spicy for my husband and grand kids. Use double the chicken broth and only 1 can of beans. It has been a success every time!!

The only thing I changed was adding some extra onion, I had red pepper instead of green and one less can of beans... Exceptional!! Everyone loved it including my 6 and 3 year old... plus they had to eat their food in order to get honey cornbread...

WOW! Had to make it twice in the same week because the first batch was gone in an hour! I added a little more of the sausage and ham and skipped the beans, but that's just personal preference. 10/10 would make again

This is very good! The only thing I did different is cut the beans down to one can Everything else I followed. The rotel was plenty of spice. But some tabasco sauce would be fine if you wanted more heat. This will be one of my "Tried and True" recipes.

This was a great and easy variation on the Cajun standard. I followed the recipe pretty closely, except I used the entire smoked sausage and the entire 8-ounce ham steak. My wife and son both agreed this belongs in the rotation.

this was my first recipe I followed on AllRecipes, and I think I've set the bar very high for all future recipes. this was fantastic. followed the recipe with the following modifications: 

1) used one can of chili beans instead of two
2) used andoille chicken sausage
3) used 1/4 teaspoon of Basil instead of 1 bay leaf

Did not drain the tomatoes, and the rice absorbed everything just fine. 

Also made more than enough to feed my wife and I with the six servings, with leftovers.

Texas Jambalaya Haiku: "I LOVE Ranch style beans. They made this dish 'pop', so good! Used Andouille too." Kept the recipe the same other than serving ours over rice (my daughter would prefer things "not touching" on her plate) that I made separately in the chicken broth. Also swapped smoked sausage for Andouille as it's way more flavorful in a Cajun dish, but I'd like to think those delicious Ranch-style beans are what made this Jambalaya just awesome! Was surprised at the relatively light inclusion of seasoning (just thyme and bay leaf) but it didn't matter - we inhaled it!

This is a good recipe the way I ended up making it. We didn't have bell pepper, so I skipped that. No ham either, so I doubled the sausage (kielbasa). Didn't have any chicken broth left, so I used water instead. Had regular diced tomatoes, so I added a couple dashes of chili powder. Didn't have any but black beans, so I added the one can I had after draining/rinsing them. Turned out very delish!

This is really delicious! To tame down heat for my little ones I used diced tomatoes in place of Tomatoes with green chilies. Would recommend to anyone for sure!! Thanks for sharing!

Pretty yummy!! Only used one can of white beans and double sausage, no ham. Green chilies in tomatoes gave it just enough heat. My husband would like it again!!

I haven't tried this yet, but I'd like to ad to Petra's comments on "Ranch Style Beans".  I grew up in Texas and we also had these very popular beans on the supermarket shelf.  I now live on the east coast and brands like Hanover or Bush's Beans have a similar bean called "chili beans".  Look for that on the label.

This was my first attempt at jambalaya and it was delicious!  I also couldn't find ranch beans so I used pinto beans and, after reading the other reviews, only put one can in.  I also added shrimp...my fiance loved it!

This recipe is great. We have made it several times.  For a while, we liked it so much we made it once a week.

I read where folks not in the south don't know what  " Ranch Style" beans are. I think Bush makes a chili bean and Walmart Great Value Brand sells a chili bean. They are cooked with chili powder and other seasoning. You could add some chili powder to dish. Great dish.

Excellent recipe, hands down. This was an absolute crowd pleaser (and it was a crowd). The only improvement that I would suggest would be to add a tad bit more onion and rice. Searing the sausage ahead of time wouldn't be a bad idea either. Other than that, it was a great Creole translation. Great work Petra!

Quick, easy, and good!  I used brown rice instead of white, and added some red pepper flakes.  Even my picky eater loved it!

I made this with chicken/jalapeno sausage as that's what I had on hand. I also added some garlic powder and a little cayenne pepper. It turned out great - very hearty and filling. Thanks!

Good, but not spectacular. Tastes like a jazzed up Hamburger Helper...but easy to make in a pinch.
