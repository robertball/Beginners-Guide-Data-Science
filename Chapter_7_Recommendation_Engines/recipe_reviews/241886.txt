I love trying new recipes! The flavor combo worked although a full tablespoon of spices seemed a bit heavy. Next time I'll reduce it to a 1/2 teaspoon of each spice. The eggs were slightly dry after cooking a full 5 minutes. I added fresh cilantro, tomatoes and ate it in a pita. Delicious! The tomatoes and cilantro help cut some of the dryness and heavyness from the spices. I'll be making this again with just a few adjustments to suit my taste. Thanks for the recipe!

The spice combination in this recipe is yummy. As suggested, I had my eggs with buttered toasted bread and a cup of chai. I did have to make substitutions: I didn't have green chiles, only habaneros and bell peppers. I used a bit of both to even out the heat. Also, I used some green onions for colour.

i wanted something different for breakfast and came across this recipe.. based on CJ's review, i cut this down to 1 serving but used 2 eggs.. i also cut the turmeric in half bc i know it can be very pungent.. for the 1 1/2 green chile peppers i used a small jalapeno that i de-veined/de-seeded.. being from socal i couldn't help but put this in a tortilla and top with some avocado.. it was tasty.. i'm not sure if i would have liked the original amounts of the ingredients but i'm happy for the post
