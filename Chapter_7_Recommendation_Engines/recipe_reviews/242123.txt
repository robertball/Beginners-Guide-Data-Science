we really liked the taste of this with minor alterations.. subbed sambal olec for the korean chile paste and brown sugar for the white.. also used half the ginger bc i grated mine on a microplane which makes it basically pulp and i always worry about it being too strong.. i could totally see how this would go great on wings.. i'd simmer this if i were to go that route.. i think it would be a great sauce over some chicken and rice.. as is i'd dip wontons and eggrolls in it.. but today bf wants to use it as a baste and quick marinade for a grilled spatchcock chicken.. ty for the recipe

Made this twice.  It's so tasty on any meat.

White sugar is a little unnecessary (there are plenty of carbs in the paste) and I went overboard on the green onions with no regrets.

Also made it with ground ginger powder instead of grated ginger and it was just fine.  I think it would be fine with garlic powder as well to save some time.

This turned out great and was shockingly easy. I upped the sugar just a bit and used Apple Cider vinegar which I think added a nice fruity tang.

So, so good. I used a “mild” gochujang, which was plenty spicy for me (I would say I have a medium spice tolerance, but I was worried at first that this would be too hot). I didn’t have green onions handy so I used dried chives and a teaspoon of onion powder. I adjusted the flavours so I felt I had a nice balance between hot, sour, sweet, and salty (I added a bit of fish sauce for extra salt). Brushed it on chicken thighs and grilled them. The cooking process mellowed the spice a bit and brought out a bit of the sweet. It was fabulous. I will come back to this recipe again!
