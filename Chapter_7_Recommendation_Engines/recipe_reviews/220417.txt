EXCELLENT! One of the things that I did different: After I removed all of the skin and the meat after the roasting time of the chicken - I roasted the bones and the veggies from the pot (I added more onions, carrot and celery) on an oiled baking sheet and baked them at 400°F for ~ 30 minutes so to extract a richer flavor from the bones and the veggies. I followed the remainder of the recipe except I substituted a large dried bay leaf in place of the thyme, added some fresh celery leafs from a celery bunch and black peppercorns after all of the foam and fat had been skimmed off. I never omit bay leafs, celery leafs or peppercorns when I make a broth/stock. I was leery of using ketchup in a broth but I used the Hunts® brand of ketchup because it doesn’t have any high fructose corn syrup in it. Note: I wash off the dirt but I never pare carrots nor peel the outside skin off of onions for making broth/stock because I strive for all of the natural flavor and color that I can get into a broth/stock. After all, the broth is strained well and the bones seasonings and veggies are discarded at the end. The end result was perfect for my tastes and the ketchup added a surprisingly nice touch of flavor to the broth.

I have made this several times now as there was a tremendous sale on chicken I couldn't pass up!  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the ketchup.  There is so little of it and I just didn't want that in my "natural" broth.  It was good, but a little light on flavor for me and kind of too much work. (4 stars as written) So - I simplified.  I roasted the chicken & veggies as directed. I separated the meat then roasted the bones.  I placed the chicken bones and the veggies in my crock pot.  I deglazed the roasting pan with a good cup or so of white wine and put in the crock pot as well.  I added enough water to cover everything by an inch and set the crock pot to low.  I let this cook overnight.  In the morning I removed the bones and veggies.  I skimmed the broth and let it cool until I could put the whole thing in the refrigerator.  Once cold I removed the fat easily and underneath that was a beautiful, rich, gelatinous stock. Quite flavorful.  I froze the stock in 16 ounce containers. Easy and no babysitting the stove! (5 stars with these changes.)

I've made this several times now and usually make enough to freeze some broth for later use. I wanted to make some of Chef Johns chicken noodle soup yesterday but only had one quart of broth. So instead of starting from scratch I bought one of those Rotisserie chickens, removed the breast meat and threw the bones, skin and all the rest into the stock pot with some carrots, onion, celery and garlic I'd carmellized in 2 Tb. butter. Simmered it for three hours as directed in Chef Johns recipe with his called for ingredients and Ta Da, I had 2 more quarts of stock that was just as tasty as the original home roasted one. I have found that the browner you get your roasted chicken to begin with the richer your stock will be. It does take all day if you roast your own chicken and mine is never browned or done in 1 hour so I usually make the stock on a day I have more time and then freeze it, if I'm not using it in the next day or so for soup. Love this recipe. I never liked my homemade chicken noodle soup until I found this recipe and his Chicken Noodle soup recipe also on AR. Thanks Chef John!

I use this broth for my soups all the time. It makes the best chicken soup ever! I followed the directions exactly the first time, but sometimes I add my own touch. I do use some of the drippings to flavor the broth. I have also used rotisserie chicken to make this broth, just make sure you save the drippings from the bottom of the rotisserie pan.

So many reviewer's have expressed interest in why the small amount of catsup. Well, it's the same reason one uses a small amount (1/4 to 1/2 cup) catsup or tomato paste in a true Italian Bolinaisse (sp) sauce, just to add a brownish color.  The things one learns when going for your Dietetics degree...hmmm.  HTH & Blessings

Yes, this was good and enjoyable to make, as I love to cook, but I can't help but think it was a waste of time, money and most of all electricity.  Even when using a pre-baked chicken for the broth, it calls for 3 hours of simmering. That's 3 hours of constant gas-fire stove, doing nothing to help my environmental footprint.. 

When weighing the cost benifits….why not just purchase a few boxes of Swanson Chicken Broth?? That's NOT a rhetorical question….

This is really pretty good but wasn't quite as flavorful as I expected.   I have never used the secret ingredient "ketchup" when making Broth - I am not a huge ketchup fan nor do I hate it - I am not sure what it added to the overall flavor.  I usually roast the bones with a few more vegetable scrapes,  after having removed all the meat - and achieve a similar broth with a bit more depth of flavor.  Enjoy!

Good food is good always, but never more so than when it nourishes someone who has lost interest in eating. This is one of the few meals my mother would eat while undergoing cancer treatment. Thank you, Chef John, for sharing.

Yep!  Chef J's recipes not only turn out great, but somehow teach basic cooking skills at the same time. I had a 9-pound stuffer-roaster (!) and knew the broth I wanted from it would not fit in a single Dutch oven, so I roasted the chicken and veggies, then took everything out, saved 2 T fat for his chicken soup, deglazed and got the brown bits with water, and then put everything in a big stock pot.  And, the dark meat, rather than being discarded, made our pups very happy for their supper!   (very, very careful to remove all bones, of course)

I used a cooked rotisserie chicken that I had on hand, and it worked great (and saved time). I also added carrots and dried parsley. I also let it simmer for only two hours. This recipe produced the exact amount of broth needed for a scaled down to 5 servings of Chicken Noodle Soup by Sherry from this site. The soup came out great!

Great broth base for soups!


Cooking 4 Joy seems worried about the environmental footprint of simmering for 3 hours (electricity or gas use) and suggests buying pre-made broth.

I suggest they think about that more thoroughly as the boughten broth likely has a much larger if not double or triple the footprint, if they are so worried.

Labor intensive but then so is the flavor - intense and full of depth so it  is worth the time if you can do it, go for it. I made my own version of chicken rice soup with it and it was a big hit. Love Chef John's recipes and his videos always make me smile. He has a good sense of humor.

I’ve made this several times. I make this as written except I cook the entire carcass after I take off the breast meat. Just easier. Also—I live at altitude so I roast the chicken about an hour and 20 minutes. When I roasted it only an hour, the breast meat was still raw. Yes, I know a instant read thermometer would solve this, but I haven’t one! Anyway, we LOVE this recipe.

This is a great base; giving it a 4 because it's hard for me to let go of my herbs. With herbs (I add mine in the last half hour to hour of simmering so you can still taste them), this is a 5.

Also, for those who wonder "is it really worth it to make your own," I give you two reasons when it is: first, like me, you have food allergies to basic ingredients (yay, onion allergy :( ) that require you to modify even basic kitchen staples; and second (more common), making your own allows you to adjust the flavor profile to your liking (for example, try adding ginger, scallions, your favorite spices, etc). This recipe is an excellent base for this second reason.

Also also, if the flavor for any reason seems too bland, try simmering just the liquid for another hour or so to really concentrate the flavor. It makes a world of difference!

Amazingly yummy chicken stock! I had to make my own due to a low iodine diet and now I’m not sure how I will go back to store bought. It took a long tine to cook but the actual prep was so easy! Delicious!!

Made as directed and loved the depth of flavor. It's a project for sure and not for someone in a hurry. The resulting broth is like golden nectar :) Used it in CJ chicken noodle soup. I should have tried harder to skim off fat when it cooled, because i could kind of taste that, but others never mentioned that.

The only thing I change is adding one carrot to the roast.  I also do not peel my garlic/onions/carrots, I just wash them.  This has become a staple I make weekly at my house.

Amazing! The only way I will make broth in the future. Super easy and worth every second. I used a larger chicken and increased the ingredients and cook time accordingly.

I made this recipe exactly as written, except that I doubled it. It was excellent! It is my go to recipe for Chicken Noodle soup. The broth had a rich roasted chicken flavor.

I really did like this. No complaints. The absence of one star is simply that it takes WAY TOO long to prepare. I don't know if I would make it again because of this. Or I may (in the future) do what others have done and make a bunch that I can freeze to use for Chef John's chicken noodle soup (relatively quick) in the future.

This broth is exceptional, rich and deliciously full of chicken flavor. The roasting made all the difference and I'll never make my broth any other way. It is an excellent base for chicken noodle soup and it would make anything that called for regular chicken broth taste even better. I've found it's easier to make this using just chicken thighs and or drum sticks so that I don't have to wait for it to cool to pick the meat off. I pour in the water while it's still hot. I like to add bay leaf and carrots to mine but it's great either way.  We save the drained dark meat and mix it with BBQ sauce for future meals so nothing goes to waste!

Love this recipe, but I brown my chicken on the stove and then place in slow cooker with other ingredients adding thyme, rosemary, and peppercorns. Then follow the instructions as listed. Is wonderful!

Pretty good. Roasting the chicken adds depth, so do not skip that part.  Plus you will have the saved roasted chicken breast for another meal.( Making chicken salad with roasted chicken is much better than poached or boiled chicken. ) 
Like several others I remove the chicken off the bones and roast the bones @400 for appx 35  to 40 ish minutes. It produces a slightly darker stock. If you are Leary about the ketshup, as I was, you could just  add a few more carrots. They add sweetness  that you get from the ketshup PLUS beta carrotine and vitamin A, that ketshup does not. . To the broth / water part of this I add 1 to  2 more carrots, 2 more celery stalks w/ leaves,  4 more sprigs of thyme, and a handful of fresh parsley with stems. I almost always have saved bones in the freezer. So. I roast them along with the bones in this too. The results after testing both ways, ( Chef J's and my version 2 addition ) and asking 6 friends and family members to do a taste test of each method, was all 6 liked " version 2 "...( the one with additions)  I did not say anything about either version....just called them " version 1 & 2 )  However 2  people thought that John's version had slightly better color. 
One note about crock pot cooking the broth:   In general, Crock pot cooking meat can have a more stewed taste.....So to avoid that in this recipe if switching to crock pot after roasting, is to bring  the stock up to almost a boil as written in John's recipe, scraping up those flavor packe

I would really give this a 3.5. It was good, and my family liked it...so did I.  But, it was a lot of work and a lot of waste. Had to doctor it up a bit as the result was a little bland.

I just can't seem to go back to making broth the other way (boiling chicken in water with veggies, herbs, etc.)! This recipe makes a huge difference! There is no need to add crappy bouillon anymore. Recipe goes perfectly with Chef John's chicken soup, although I do add some extra herbs to the soup recipe when sauteing the vegetables, but that is a separate review. :)
