This coffee cake was great!  I did make some changes though: instead of using 2 cups white sugar, I used 1 cup white & 1 cup brown.  I then used light sour cream and I doubled the streusel topping.  On the topping I used brown sugar instead of white.  I made mine in a 9 x 13 pan and it baked for about 45 min.  My family loved it, thanks Mary!

This was a nice recipe. I left out the nuts and made the streusel from half cup brown and half cup granulated sugar, with more cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. Next time I would make more streusel so that the layer of it is more pronounced and add more flavor. I gradually added streusel to the top of the cake as it baked so that the sugar wouldn't burn. This made a really nice crust to the cake. If doing this, may need to increase the cooking time slightly due to the opening of the oven. Let it cool for few  hours before cutting. Wouldn't recommend baking this the morning you want to serve it because it won't cut nicely and makes for a sloppy presentation.

This is simply fabulous!!!!!!!  I made another streusel coffee cake and saw this one recommended by a reviewer.  Thank you!

This is moist & delicious.  It was gone in less then a day.  I made extra cinnamon and sugar and put it in the middle of the cake.  I like a big ribbon of streusel in the middle.

I wish I could give this cake 6 stars.  It deserves it.  Thanks!!

I don't know what went wrong with this recipe, I followed it exactly, with the exception of using only 16oz of sour cream, which was a little bit less than 2 cups.  The batter tasted great, it came out very, very thick. I checked the cake every 5 minutes from 45 to 60 minutes, I was still getting liquid on the butterknife at 45, 50 & 55 minutes. When we ate it, it was dry.  The sugar, cinnamon and nut mix did not bake into the cake at all. The nuts on the top burned and the sugar poured off when I removed the cake from the bundt pan. Should it have been mixed with some melted butter?  I was very dissapointed and embarrased to have served this to my husband's co-workers!

delicious. i too altered by pouring in 1/3 of the batter, then half the cinnamon sugar, then 1/3 batter and the rest of the cinnamon sugar, then the rest of the batter. i cooked it for about 50-52 minutes. 60 is too long. when i served it i sprinkled some powdered sugar on the top. if you cook it too long, it will come out dry. if you follow the instructions for the sugar connoction as stated, it turns into a mess when served.  oh and i use pecans instead. yum. we love this recipe with these few changes...

In an effort to lower the fat/carbs/calories a bit, I made several changes.  Used 1 c Splenda and 1 c sugar, 1/2 c eggbeaters and 2 eggs, and only had 1/2 c light sour cream, so used that and 1 1/2 c nonfat plain yogurt.  As suggested by other reviewers, I doubled the streusel filling and divided the batter into thirds so there was 2 rows of it running through.  It needed to be baked for 65 minutes and was done perfectly.  Let it cool for about 10 minutes and when I flipped the pan, it came right out.  This makes one big bundt cake, but it is really good!

This is a classic coffee cake, similar to what my late mother used to keep on hand for guests, but the recipe needed some help.  First, I baked this in a flat-bottomed angel food type tube cake pan (the closest modern equivalent to my mother's tube pan w/ straight, 3-1/2" sides that was designed for streusel cakes).  I covered the top w/ foil for part of the bake time to prevent the streusel from burning.  This way the cake is turned out upside down, but is then inverted again so that the streusel is back on top. Fluted cake tops can't show the streusel, and the batter is less likely to run over in a taller pan.  I made the cake as written except for using lowfat sour cream but w/o salt (almost 1 tsp) there is the "flat" taste some reviewers mentioned.  When a baking recipe calls for butter but doesn't specify what type, the convention is that it means unsalted butter.  Perhaps the submitter uses salted butter or margarine, so she didn't include the necessary salt in the recipe.  If you use supermarket vanilla extract (and not extra-strength gourmet extract) the amount of vanilla should be doubled.  Streusel sticks better if it includes a bit of butter.  My batter came out too thick to spread well in the pan, and the cake was more oily-textured than I like.  One solution to both issues is to sub in applesauce for half the recipe's butter.  However, the recipe was a great starting point to recreate my mother's classic.

Great recipe, except I had trouble getting the cake out of the pan even though I buttered and floured the pan beforehand. Also, I doubled the cinnamon and sugar mixture.  I served this Christmas morning and everyone loved it. I will definitely make this again!

Very good and very easy. I took the advise of other reviewers and used half white & half brown sugars and doubled the topping  also with brown sugar. Gets moist as it sits so better the next day. Came out beautiful in my bundt pan. This is a keeper! Thanks!

This was great. Everyone loved it. I added more of the streusel mix using brown/white sugar like many suggested. I also made an icing to drizzle on top.  Turned out perfect.

The flavor in this cake was really good.  My only complaint is that it COMPLETELY FILLED my bundt pan, so it browned on the top & bottom way before the inside was done.  It came out a little dry, but the inside was still a little soft.  I will use this recipe again, but will have to either use less batter or a lower cooking time.  My only other adjustment was adding brown sugar to the streusal and a glaze to the top.

An enormous hit at my family brunch.  I found that the "toothpick test" didn't work to test for doneness- I baked the cake about 10 minutes too long and should have removed it from the oven at 55 or 60 minutes.  Even still, the cake was delicious and I received many compliments.

We enjoyed this cake, however I think that I will add a little cinnamon to the batter next time that I make it. It has a nice texture and it is moist with a good flavor.

Amazingly Yummy!  Followed it to a T in ingredients.  I noticed it seemed like a lot of batter, so I baked it in a 9x13 and took the advice of putting the cinnamon mixture in layers of 1/3's.

Everone loves this each time we make it.  I use brown sugar in the cinnamon blend and twirl it into the mix with a fork to get a more even distribution.

You really cannot go wrong with this cake! Just look at all the delicious ingredients and you'll see it has all the components of a moist, wonderful coffee cake! I couldn't have been more pleased with how this turned out! I did two layers of the streusel so it was dispersed more to my liking, and I'm glad I did! I had a little leftover glaze from a different recipe so I used that and topped with finely chopped nuts. YUM!

Warning, do NOT use 4 cups of flour or you will have a coffee brick, made it exactly as written. That has to be a typo, if I make it again I will use 3 cups....recipe says to 'pour' into bundt pan, I had to fling it off of spoon, it was the consistency of stiff mashed potatoes.

I made this as a special treat for my fiance, as we are forever looking for different breakfast-type recipes to try. I enjoyed this but added a little dark and light brown sugar to the middle and top streusel to give it a little more texture and taste. Next time I will put a little of the topping in the batter, as well as putting the mixture in the bundt pan before adding batter and also in the middle and top as the recipe suggests. I only had one cup of sour cream so next time I will add the full two cups and see if that makes my cake a little more moist. Otherwise a great treat for anytime of day!!

This is a nice coffee cake. I wanted to make it as written, but when I saw the amount of streusel, I did decide to double it and it came out great. Next time I will probably finish with the batter on top (putting streusel only in middle) because when you flip the cake, the sugar/nut mixture is kind of messy and crumbly to have on the bottom of cake. Also I did not have quite enough sour cream (had 1 and 1/4 cup) but it sill came out fine. The cake itself is not too sweet, so the sweet streusel is a nice contrast. It got a little too brown on the crust, but inside was still good and moist. Baked about 50-55 min., maybe it was a few too many min. Overall, happy with the coffee cake, thanks for the recipe!

Moist and delicious. I also put it in a 9x13 pan and cooked it for 55 minutes at 350 degrees and it was cooked perfectly.As another reviewer suggested I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar in the cake and all brown sugar in the topping.Everyone loved it.

All of the unfavorable reviews are right on...this is very dry and bland, even after following suggestions to double the streusel and use brown sugar. Keep looking, there are better recipes. I will never make this again, what a waste of good flour.

This is really good, its perfectly moist and my family loved it. I substituted the sour cream for nonfat vanilla yogurt, and cut the recipe in half. Next time I make it I will double the streusel. Will make again.

Awesome coffee cake. Just what I was looking for. I made a couple changes: I used half whole wheat flour, and half all purpose white flour. Based on other reviews, I also used half brown sugar and half white sugar for the streusel, and I omitted the nuts just because I didn't have any. I also layered all the streusel inside between layers of batter instead of putting any on the top of the batter (which would have been the bottom of the cake after turning it out after baking). It turned out great! Took a full hour to cook though. 
I think next time I will half this recipe, because it makes a very big coffee cake and takes a long time to cook.

Amazing and SOOO delicious! I followed the advice of another reviewer and use 1 cup white sugar + 1 cup brown sugar, and making the streusel with brown sugar. It did take longer than 60 mins, so keep checking on it.

Outstanding! Simple recipe! Family loved it - even my mother in law who "doesn't like sweets" ate two pieces.  I made one substitution - instead of 2 cups sour cream, I used one cup sour cream and one cup buttermilk.  Fabulous!

Well I'll be making this for the first time today, I just moved out of my folks house a couple months ago and left my bunt cake pan there, so I'll be making this into a roll. Pouring the batter on a greased waxed paper sheet, cooking it than putting the filling on top. Cook it a few minutes longer, than roll it up and drizzle some ising on top. 3 stars for now, just for it looking and sounding good. I'll edit and put the real rate later today.

This was wonderful.  I do not own a bundt pan, so I baked this in an 8.5x11.  The first time, baked as the recipe stated and it was very good.  Next time, I could not find my nuts in my cupboard so, I used a trail kind of mix with cranberries, pecans, walnuts, filberts, and pistachios.  I just chopped it up in the food processor and added it to the cinnamon and sugar.  Yummy both ways.  Thanks!

This was delicious. I cut the recipe down somewhat, and spread a layer of diced apple tossed with cinnamon and sugar in the middle. Fabulous! By the way, the apples definitely increase baking time.

This was a dense cake. I kinda figured with all the flour. Not sweet enough and you really should double the streusel. Not nearly enough. I added milk to help thin it out, but I guess not enough. I like when I find a good recipe and have to make modifications for my own preference. This one needs modifications just to good. Didn't care for this and I know I won't be making this again.

I followed the recipe exactly except for doubling the streusel amount and the brown sugar suggestions, which I would also strongly recommend, and also by adding some salt, as there is no salt listed in the receipe.
I would never make this cake again.  It was very heavy and dense.  The cake part itself had NO flavor.  From my limited baking experience the recipe needs to be reformulated to: include salt somewhere (or some other flavor), add some lightness to the cake and butter for the streusel "topping" which is actually the bottom of the cake.  Without using a fat to hold the "topping" together at the bottom of the cake the nuts, sugar and cinnamon combo fell off and was dry.  The amount of batter was also too much.  The cake rose about 3/4 of an inch above the pan, I thought it was going to spill over....

This recipe does not specify to melt or soften butter. When I made this with my students, the batter was the consistancy of bread dough. I added milk to thin it out to proper consistancy.
Also, the ingredients listed for the streusel mixture, should have had brown sugar instead of white sugar.
As with any recipe, read the ingredients & directions thoroughly before preparing the item so you don't waste time & money.
Once the 3/4 cup milk was added, the coffee cake came out wonderful.

This does indeed make a lot of batter, and that is the problem. I followed directions exactly (I did not increase the topping and I thought there was enough) and the cake was dry on the outside and underdone in the middle. 

The cake is very good about halfway towards the center opening but that is not exactly what I wanted. My solution is to make half and bake it in a smaller, rectalgular pan. My oven is brand new and the thermomater is perfect so it is the cake in this case.

I was so excited to try this cake. Unfortunately like the other reviewer I cooked it 10 min too long. It was dripping on the bottom of my oven so even at 50 min  i thought it wasn't cooked through so i over did it. It came out dry. I also agree with a few others it needed double the streudel. My bundt pan may have been a bit small too. I may have to try another recipe.

THIS CAKE ROCKS!!!  Makes an EXCELLENT and very large cake!  I used a fancy bundt pan, and it broke when I flipped it...so I prepared a vanilla glaze for the top and sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar to make it more attracive...especially since it was my husband's birthday cake of choice :-) Next time I will use a regular bundt pan and turn it back over after flipping it out of the pan so that the cinnamon and nut topping is on TOP of the cake. Yummy, yummy, yummy...and it even passed the in-laws test!

This was great!  I had tried another similar recipe on the site, and this was better -- filled the entire pan better and was moister.  I used 1 Tbsp. cinnamon and only 1/2 cup nuts.

This coffee cake was delicious! It was perfectly moist and everyone I served it to was raving about it. 

I did make two changes to the recipe to make it a little less fatty and to make it more appealing to my family:
1) Instead of using 2 cups of sour cream, I only used one cup and substituted the second with a cup of plain yogurt. Doesn't make a lick of difference in taste but definitely makes you feel better about eating it!
2) I skipped the nut cinnamon mixture for the streusel completely. My mom hates cinnamon and the rest of us don't care much for it either. So instead, after I mixed everything together, I took a third of the batter and mixed it with 2-3 teaspoons of premium cocoa in a separate bowl. Then I layered the form: 1/2 of the regular mixture that was left, then the entirety of the cocoa mixture, and then the second half of the regular mixture. 

It turned out great, this is the greatest basic coffee cake recipe (excluding the streusel) and you can basically make whatever adjustments to the flavour you want! Next time I think I will make a lemon poppyseed one using this recipe!

A few tips for anyone who wants to to try this recipe next:
1) Although not stated, use salted butter instead of unsalted so you don't have to worry about adjusting the recipe and including salt to balance the taste.
2) The batter gets really thick so use a stand mixer if you have one. I prefer using an electrical hand mixer but the batter ended up climbing all the way up to the body wh

With some substitutions because we baked from the pantry instead of shopping, this turned out excellent!!
1: mixed 1/3 sour cream, 2/3 plain greek yogurt
2: half brown, half white sugar
3: added a bit of nutmeg because nutmeg makes cinnamon better
4: didn't have walnuts, but we did have those cinnamon-roasted almonds. 
It came out darker, of course. It DID overflow the pan a bit. But was NOT dry. Hubby says "dry coffee cake isn't a sin, people eat coffee cake with butter. But  this doesn't need the butter." The almond substitution was a total winner.

This is my go to "coffee cake!"   My teenage children ask for it for any "special occasion" like birthdays or Christmas.  It gets nibbled on throughout the day and is usually gone by supper time.   I add a little more brown sugar to the streusel and I also drizzle it with a vanilla/powder sugar glaze.    Love, love, love this recipe!

I made this exactly as directed except for using pecans instead of walnuts.  I should have followed the advice of some other reviews and made more of the sugar and nut mixture.  And for the top (which becomes the bottom) I would make a crumb mixture of flour, sugar, butter and nuts so that it becomes more melted into the cake. In my stoneware bundt pan it took over an hour to bake.  But I brought it warm to a morning meeting and had a lot of compliments.

This cake is very tasty and very big!  I baked mine in a 13x9 pan and it rose an inch over the top.  It did not run over, but it came close!  The streusel was a good amount.  Next time I'll swirl it around some in the pan after layering the batter/streusel.  Everyone at work enjoyed it!

This could be a good base.  We didn't  think this was a very good cake. It smells like cornbread after it comes out of the oven.  There is no streusel, as the topping is dry and it fell off the cake when we turned it over on the plate. We were expecting ooey gooey yummyness and got plain cake.

Well, this was my first attempt, ever, at a Coffee Cake.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I did change some things.  I used canola oil, instead of butter, whole fat plain goat yogurt (can't have cow dairy in our house) instead of sour cream.  I also used half splenda, and half splenda brown sugar blend for the cake, and used splenda brown sugar blend for the streusel.  I doubled the streusel too. I found this cake moist, yummy, not too sweet ... I think I'll add little pieces of apple next time.  :)

Baked for over 60 minutes -- seemed like it was getting too dry on the outside, yet I had some of the inner ring not fully baked.  I substituted granualted brown sugar for some of the white sugar for flavor and appearance.  This combination on the top of the cake ended up tasting burned.  I would put MORE than 1/2 the sugar mixture in the center of the cake.

This is really good. I have to admit a few changes (which I hate to rate when I make changes). I forgot to buy nuts so I doubled the cinnamon mixture and put most inside of the cake. I also did half brown sugar because of that for more flavor. It did rise above the pan but not so much that it bothered me. The sugar made a nice crust. Baked 55 minutes.

This recipe seems to be double every other one listed and I have baked it for over an hour and the cake is not anywhere near being finished. Not sure if this is meant for 2 bundt cake pans but I think next time I'll try to make 2 cakes or cut the recipe in half.

I made this cake and brought it to work and it was such a HUGE it!  It came out so high and it was scrumptiousdillisious! I did change sugar to 1 cup white/1 cup brown and I think that made a big difference.  I also double the streusel recipe for more effect in the cake! What an effect it was!  I added flour to the streusel mix to give it more of a crunch!  Delicious!  The cake was so tasty and yummy! So many people complimented me on that cake!  Thanks for such a wonderful recipe!

Wonderfully moist coffee cake! I halved the recipe and substituted l/4 cup of  deu leuce (caramel) flavored coffee creamer in place of l/4 cup of the sour cream since I was short on the sour cream. I added l/2 teaspoon of mapleine flavoring along with the vanilla.

This was great!!  I did cook it longer than stated but it was fine.  A lot of reviews had trouble with overflow but i baked in a Pampered Chef stoneware bundt and didn't have trouble.  It did up over the center but still not a problem.  I also had no trouble with the cake popping out.  I sprayed bundt with Bakers Joy. Next time I will double the "streussel" topping and add more to the middle and then mix butter with sugar/cinn. mixture for the topping, (which of course is actually the top!!!)  This was easy to make and was very tastey!  I will make again adding different things like apples or different nut combos or chocolate chip.  Raspberries and chocolate sound good!  Hmmmmm..........  gotta go bake!

This was good but not as moist as I would have liked it.  Also not enough "crumb" for my liking.  I'm a sweet freak though.

I didn't have a Bundt pan, so I made it in two glass pie plates. It turned out wonderful. It was yummy without being overly-sweet.

Everyone who ate this cake said it was very good. I made a small mistake in not putting enough sugar-nut mixture in the middle of the cake. Next time I make this I will put all of the mixture in the middle & make a glaze for the top. More like a cinnamon roll cake, I guess. But this recipe it tops as is.

I made the Streusel Coffee Cake for Christmas. At first, I was a bit worried because the batter was so thick but it turned out perfectly.
Moist, sweet and rich...everyone enjoyed it.

I made this last week and it was great.  I did not have sour cream so I used skim milk with vinegar.  I doubled the cinnamon recipe and used brown sugar in place of white for the mixture. I did three layers of batter.  It was a hit.  I did cook it for about 5 minutes longer than the recipe and let it cool on a baking rack.  Definitely grease the pan!

Awesome recipe!  My boyfriend has been asking me to make coffee cake for months, so I found this one a few days ago and tried it last night.  It came out amazing.  It did rise a little above the bundt pan (by about 2 inches) but all the more for us to eat.  Thanks!

This was a simple recipe to follow and it turned out Delicious! The batter was thick, hard to spread, so the filling was not as thick. I added some dried berries to topping and some more cinnamon to the batter. SO GOOD! Going to make it again!

It was okay. It wasn't as sweet as I had hoped. It also didn't taste too cake-like. I would have added much for sugar and some extra vanilla.

Great crumb, very moist. This recipe would be good in a 12 cup or bigger bundt. My bundt fits 8 cups comfortably so had to put the extra in a small cake pan.  Subbed brown sugar for the streusel and doubled it, creating 3 layers instead of two (plus enough to cover the extra small cake.)  No need for glaze. Wonderful recipe!

Really wonderful recipe.  Simple and the results are consistent.  I've made this about a dozen times; as written and also with modifications.  In place of the sour cream I have used yogurt and/or buttermilk which seems to give a slightly lighter cake.  I have also replaced the walnut mixture with blueberries, poppyseed or a mixture of almond paste and almond filling.  Giving this five stars because you can be creative with this recipe and each variation turns out well.

This cake is amazing. I tweeked it some. Doubled the streusel and the vanilla. I also decreased the sour cream to 1 1/2 cups and added half a block of cream cheese. A layer of chopped apples added a wonderful touch. Then I made a cream cheese frosting for the top and sprinkled with additional pecans. My co-workers loved it. Tastes even better on day two. I liked my piece warmed in the microwave for 20 seconds. Yummy!

No problems with this coffee cake at all.  I put one third of the batter in the pan and sprinkled with half the streusel, which I doubled and used brown sugar instead of white.  Added another third of the batter; sprinkled with remaining streusel and the rest of the batter.  Instead of two teaspoons of vanilla, I used one teaspoon of vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon extract.  When cool, I drizzled a confectioners sugar glaze over the cake.

Great recipe!  Everyone loved it! The only change I made was to use half white sugar and half brown sugar throughout.

This cake has a great flavor but I don't see how anyone can "pour" this batter. It is way too stiff to pour. I had to add close to a full cup of milk just so I could get it in the Bundt pan. I will probably make it again but with some adjustments like one cup less flour and twice as much of the streusel filling. And I think I will bake it in a rectangular pan--half the batter, filling on top and then the other half of the batter. I only baked it about 50 minutes and even with the addition of the milk it still came out somewhat dry.

I took into account of other reviews and put the streusel on the last 10 minutes of baking, but next time will make more since I felt it was lacking.  Tasted a m a z i n g!!

This was a good cake tasted much better when still warm. Would add more of the streusal to the middle of the cake since I like a lot of it.Was a little dry but heating it up took care of that. Not sure if I would make again maybe with a few changes it could be a 5 star recipe.

This cake is great!  I made it for my After Thanksgiving Brunch and my family loved it!  I did substitute brown sugar for the white in the streusel. No problems with over-flow, burnt topping or difficulty with pan release.  This will definitely go into my standard recipe file.

Great cake!  I took mine out of the oven a bit too early because I was worried it was going to get burnt or dry, but it turned out a little goey on the inside.  That's my only complaint.

I have no idea what went wrong. used the 10 inch bundt pan as instructed and others that said the cake overflowed, same happened to me :(  the top browned to a crunch, took it out of the oven before it became too browned, cooled it a bit, and the insides were mostly raw. what part wasn't all goo, tasted great.  what a shame

I did not have good luck with this recipe.  There wasn't enough streusel in the middle for my taste, and the nuts burned on top.  It overflowed my bundt pan and I had to bake it ~15 minutes longer (1 hr and 15 min).  Consequently it turned out dry on the outside.  I won't be trying this one again.

I always use an oven thermometer, and have many years of baking experience, yet this did not work out!  The outside of the Bundt (10" size) was looking a little overcooked at 42 minutes, so I removed it and let it sit in the pan on a cooling rack for 30 min.  When I removed it from the pan (came out nicely), the entire center of the cake literally OOZED out.  The flavor of the ccoked area was nice, but there just seemed to be toooo much cake batter, even though the pan was the correct size... I did use a silicone Bundt pan, so maybe that's why??  I will probably not waste my time trying this recipe again until I buy another (metal) pan or just make muffins.

I got distracted while making this cake and stirred everything together - no layers. I was disappointed until I tasted it and others asked me for the recipe. I added another 1/2 the streusel and added two  apples, diced; baked in a 9x13 and added a little icing drizzel. No left-overs!

I didn't like it.  It wasn't very sweet and the streusel wasn't a true streusel.  I'd add some of the butter into the streusel so that it really sinks into the cake.

I took this to a work function and it went over very well. I took the advice of others and used half brown and half white sugar. I also added a glaze to the top. The batter is very thick and there is lots of it. I cooked mine in a 9x13in pan and it came out well.

this is a super simple recipe!  used cake flour instead of reg alll purpose floor. It made it lighter and fluffy.  I was a bit dissapointed b/c It was kind of bland but after all it is a coffe cake! I used a mixtue of brown and white sugar.

Took over 60 minutes to bake and the batter was overflowing--too much for one bundt pan. I was truly disappointed-it is dry and doesn't have a lot of flavor.

Fantastic coffee cake, moist and delicious!  I made mine in a 9x13 pan (it was enormous, but didn't last long!).  I used low fat sour cream 1/4 cup white sugar and a 1/4 cup brown sugar in the strusel and 1 Tbsp cinnamon.  It cooked perfectly in 45min and made the house smell wonderful.  I also added a vanilla glaze.  Delicious!

This was a huge dissapointment. I made the cake part and put it in a flat pan (instead of bundt) and then put on a homemade topping. My roommate and sister referred to it as a 'grandma cake'(the ones where you don't like it but have to eat it). I'll keep trying. Thanks anyways.

I thought the cake was good.  It took  60 minutes to fully bake.  I would not put the cinnamon/nuts on top next time; they pretty much fall off.  Next time I'll put all the streusel in the middle.

This recipe is awesome.  I substituted the white sugar in the streusel with brown sugar.  Didn't have a Bundt tin so used a regular cake pan.  Had no problems with the cooking time, cake sticking to the tin, or dryness.  The cake turned out great!  Might be nice as someone suggested with a drizzle of vanilla glaze.  Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely delicious!  I used pecans instead.
