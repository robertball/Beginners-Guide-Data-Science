This was yummylicious and so easy that my 15 yr. old said he wanted to try to make it!  WARNING:  Please do not add seasoned salt as the other reviewer suggested until you make the recipe as directed!  This was seasoned perfectly as written.  Added the minced garlic to the dressing and poured over breasts, moving them slightly to make sure they're nicely coated.  Cooked chicken 4 hrs. as directed and mine were actually done by that time.  Softened the cream cheese in microwave for 30 sec. in a bowl and then blended the soup.  Took the chicken out and poured the soup mixture in the crockpot w/ the juice from the chicken, mixing thoroughly and then replaced the chicken back.  OMGsh, it was so good that we didn't even wait for me to cook the noodles.  Anyway, saved the rest for the next day and it reheated beautifully.  Maybe I'll be able to actually get some noodles cooked to go w/ it today--LOL!

I've been making this chicken for years, with a few minor changes.  No water is needed.  DON'T add any extra salt as a previous reviewer suggested, it'll be WAY too salty.  Sometimes I'll splash in a little white wine at the end, and I use sliced mushrooms, not chopped.  We serve it over egg noodles, and the whole family loves it.  It's delicious, and yes, rich, but you don't eat like this all the time!

This was wonderful. I made a few changes though. I used cream of chicken and mushroom soup instead and fresh mushrooms. I also added a bit of water to the sauce for a but thinner sauce. When dropping the chicken in crockpot, make sure to season the meat as well with a bit of seasoning salt. My kids loved this over pasta with a big green salad.

I made this for dinner last night with only a few changes and my picky family loved it! I didn't have a garlic clove, so I mixed in 1/4 tsp of granulated garlic with the dressing mix/water. I added mushroom soup instead of chicken because I did not have mushrooms. For the last hour of cooking, I shredded the chicken and added more water to make more of a gravy. It turned out beautifully and was delicious over noodles. I even used nonfat cream cheese and thought overall it was a pretty healthy and delicious recipe with no butter oil, or cheese needed like the traditional alfredo! Thanks for a yummy keeper!

Going to have to agree with everyone here and say the sauce was the real show stopper.  Creamy and so full of flavor.  I'm a garlic junkie and actually used a handful of cloves and I used fat free cream cheese and low fat or fat free...can't remember which...cream of chicken soup to make it a little less fattening.  Turned out great.  I also used a bunch of fresh mushrooms...many more than 4.5 ounces, as my boyfriend and I both love them.  Also added cracked black pepper to taste and topped with shaved Parmesan cheese.  This dinner was so easy...will definitely be making again.

This was good, my kids (4 and 6) both liked it.  This is a ton of sauce, though.  I don't like real 'saucy' dishes, so I would make this recipe for about 2 LBS of spaghetti next time.  This time I dished it up separately, cooked spaghetti then dribbled with sauce.  When we were done, I cooked up lots more spaghetti to combine with the sauce before storing leftovers.  Changes I made to recipe: -Used only 2 chicken breasts -Removed chicken from cooking liquid and set aside, then mixed in soup/crm cheese for sauce. -Diced chicken and returned it to cooking sauce. -Added 1 cup green peas to sauce, next time will add more.

So good and everyone loved it in my family which is hard to do.  :-)  I like more sauce so I did add extra can of cream mushrom. Also didn't have italian dressing mix so just used some italian viniagrette dressing I had, 1/2 cup.

Thank you for this simple recipe.  It's very quick and gives me, the husband, an opportunity to show his culinary prowess.  I made no variations other than an accidental switch from cream of chicken to cream of mushroom (purchased the wrong can at the store).

Instead of water, I used white wine. I used my own homemade italian seasoning mix and added a little organic chicken broth I needed to use. I also used fresh baby bella mushrooms. This was pretty good--the kids really enjoyed it. I made some roasted garlic broccoli to go with. Next time, I'd use more garlic and maybe add in some sliced fresh onion.

DH loved it.  Cooked for less time due to size of the chicken beasts.  Also added blush wine for extra liquid in the sauce. "Good Stuff!"

Amazing! Not just the taste of this, but that all family members gave it a big thumbs up! I made mine just a bit different. I didn't have dry Italian dressing mix, so I poured about 1/2 to 3/4 c. Tuscan Ital. dressing over 2 very large chicken breasts and cooked on high for 3 hrs. in my crock pot. When I checked it, the meat just fell apart, so I decided to shred the chicken with a fork. There was a fair amount of "broth" that I just mixed in. Then I added the cream cheese & soup mixture and cooked on low for an hour. Served it up over bow ties and topped it off with Parmesan ~ YUM! A new quick and easy dish for my family...thanks!

Oh my gosh this was soooooo good!! I even made it reduced fat and it was still rich with lots of flavor! The only additions I made were.....a splash of white cooking wine, turkey bacon and peas. Everything else was the same(except reduced fat). I served it over whole wheat bow tie pasta and it was YUMMY!!! My husband was licking his plate and my kids (ages 5,2 and 8 months)downed it(and that NEVER happens). Over all this recipe was a huge hit with the adults and kids! I definitely am going to be making it many more times!!

I made this a little differently - I chose to only use the recipe portion for the chicken breasts - using the italian salad dressing mix, water, and garlic.  I used the "Quick and Easy Alfredo" sauce for the remainder.  I put my chicken breasts in frozen, and thus cooked it on a high setting for 7 hours.  This was very moist chicken w/ a nice flavour!

This was OK.  I found the sauce to be very soupy (not thick enough), and also nothing like alfredo.

This tasted wonderful. I started off with 4 frozen breasts as I usually do when using the crockpot. This is very easy to do and tasty.

I wasn't too sure about this recipe, but it turned out really delicious. I didn't have the dressing mix, but used a little Italian dressing instead. Very yummy. Thanks!

I followed this recipe but took the review that indicated a lesser cook time.  I cooked the chicken for 2.5 hours and then 1 hour with the cream cheese addition.  I think my chicken ended up a *tiny* bit over cooked after that! So next time I would cook it even less.  HOWEVER -- I must say I really enjoyed the sauce that turned out after the chicken was off the plate.  The cream cheese/cream of chicken soup/garlic/mushroom/italian seasonings made a fantastic white sauce for the pasta.  I'd make that without the chicken, just combine the ingredients in a small crock and heat for an hour or so and pour it over the noodles!

Easy to make and my family really liked it. Bonless skinless chicken in the slow cooker is tricky, so I'm pleasantly surprised that this turned out as well as it did. Thanks!

This is a fabulous recipe and my family loves it. However, everything that goes in the slow cooker (except for the garlic) is a recipe from the Fix It and Forget It cookbook. Can't really claim this one as your own. I think adding garlic is a great idea and I'll try that next time I make it.

made this for dinner tonight as I had boneless chicken in the fridge and did not want to make it the same old way. It did not involve many ingredients (most I had on hand) nor a long prep or cook time. I cooked it exactly as stated in the recipe (i do  not like to deviate much until I have at least tried it first). It was delicious. The only thing I would do differently the next time is add peas (as another poster recommended) and perhaps some pearl onions. Additionally, as another reviewer stated, I would remove the chicken and cut it up into strips or chunks after the 4 hour cook time, add the soup/cream cheese mixture and blend the chicken back into the mix. My picky 5 year old even ate it. The chicken was tender, flavorful and succulent. Will definitely make again.

This recipe is amazing.  I've omitted the mushrooms b/c I don't like them.  I've also added steamed broccoli to the sauce, shredded the chicken, and put it over penne instead of spaghetti.  I've found that if you shred or chop up the chicken and stir it into the sauce it goes a lot further than leaving the breasts whole.  Great recipe that is my husband's favorite!

This was SO easy and my kids loved it!  I didn't even thaw the chicken breasts.  Just cook frozen chicken breasts with the water, garlic and seaoning on HIGH for 4 hours.  I didn't have dry Italian dressing on hand but used a packet on ranch dressing mix instead.

This was a very good recipe. I had to modify it a little based on what I had and my preferences. I put a whole (small) bottle of Italian Dressing with the chicken and they crocked for 4 hours. Then I added a whole carton of fresh sliced button mushrooms because I don't really like the canned ones. Added a can of cream of chicken AND  can of cream of mushroom soup because I wanted lots of gravy, and added only 1/2 of an 8oz. box of cream cheese. Let that crock for 1 more hour. My boyfriend shredded the chicken right in the crockpot with all the gravy and we served it over spaghetti. Easy and good.

This was an AMAZING dish!  I made the following adjustments per the other reviews. 1. used frozen chicken breasts and cooked on HIGH 4 hrs. 2. used 1/2-2/3c italian dressing instead of the packet. 3. Along with adding an EXTRA 4 oz of cream cheese, I added 1 can EACH of cream of chicken and cream of GOLDEN mushroom soups as I didn't have fresh mushrooms on hand. Then turned it to LOW for the last hour.  I also boiled my penne noodles in partial chicken broth and water for more chicken flavor.  The family loved it, will make again for sure!

Very easy and good. Not sure I liked it at first, but the leftovers were wonderful. It does have the "cream of chicken soup in a crokpot" flavor/texture, of course, but it was easy and everyone, even my pickies, liked it. Will do again.

this is so yummy and easy!  it's become a fave in our house.  We left out the mushrooms and tripled the garlic, just to suit our tastes!  Thanks so much for a tremondous recipe!

Taste was fine, looked unappetizing, won't make it again or even save the left overs. My husband almost wouldn't even try it based on it's looks.

This was good and an easy week night meal, but not something I would serve to guests.  My family enjoyed it.  We did not find it too salty at all.  It must depend on what dressing mix you use.   I omitted the mushrooms, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  I was a little worried when I first added the cream cheese/soup, but it thickened up nicely.

I love this recipe! It has all the taste of the heavy cream versions, without the heaviness. I made this both in the crock pot and in my pressure cooker - both worked wonderfully. I will sometimes use low sodium chicken broth when I do the pressure cooker. This gets made in my house at least twice a month!

This was very good and convenient to make.  I opted to rub the chicken in EVOI rather than using cooking spray, substituted chicken broth for water, fresh mushrooms for canned, added white wine to the sauce for a better consistency, and  served over fetticuni rather than spaghetti.  It was delish.

I didn't have the dry seasoning and so used bottled Italian dressing to cook the chicken in and it worked just fine. Also used more garlic cloves since we love garlic. The chicken was done in three hours, I removed it and shredded it on a plate and just mixed the soup and cheese in the juice int the crock pot, and then returned the chicken and let it cook on low another hour or more. I did use 1/3 less fat cream cheese and Campbell's Healthy request soup to make it  bit healthier. Served it over egg noodles. My two sons and husband really loved it.

This was great!  But I only gave it 3 stars because I made a lot of adjustments.  First, I used the Italian seasoning dressing mix from the Allrecipes website, but omitted the salt.  There is plenty of other salt in this recipe, and you can always sprinkle some salt over it all at the end if desired.  I also used fat free cream cheese and the healthier version of the soup.  I used half the amount of cream cheese as was recommended in the recipe based on some recommendations and I am really glad I did...it came out to be the perfect consistency.  I tripled the garlic, added about half a cup on diced onions at the same time, omitted the mushrooms (based on personal preference) and added slightly steamed broccoli and sliced red peppers when I added the soup mixture.  This added color to the dish and also tasted good.  Finally, in the last 15 minutes or so of cooking, I added about 1/2 cup of shredded mozzarella and some parmesan cheese.

I've had this in my recipe box for a year now.  Wish I had made it sooner.  This is delicious and easy.  I cooked the chicken only for only 3 1/2 hours.  Then mixed everything and cooked the final hour.  Only change I made was using a larger can of mushrooms.  Thank you for this recipe.

By far one of the best chicken slow cooker recipes ever. All three of my tweens/teens ate it and loved it and that is a NEVER HAPPENS Occasion! I did use cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken because that is what I had.

This was so easy and quite good!  I used low-fat cream cheese and the healthy version of the cream of chicken soup but otherwise followed the recipe.  Even with those substitutions, this was really yummy!  Thanks for a great recipe that is perfect for busy families!

This is one of the best slow cooker meals I have made! I didn't add the mushrooms, because I hate them, but I did add 1 1/2 cups of frozen peas 30 mins before it was done cooking. This is one meal my whole family enjoys! I make it often!

This was very tasty. I would say the flavor is more like stroganoff instead of alfredo due to the tang of the cream cheese. Still quite good though.

This is sooo good! My husband just loved it. And so super easy to throw together. I actually added the chicken still frozen. Next time I will double the sauce, so there is more! This will be a staple in our home!

This was delicious! My husband said it was his third favorite chicken dish ever and my second son ate two huge helpings and then asked to have it again tomorrow. I followed the recipe exactly as written (with the exception of the mushrooms, I don't use those). I steamed peas and we all ended up mixing them in with our chicken and noodles and they added a nice, sweet touch. Next time I think I'm going to try onion soup mix or maybe something with a bit of a kick. This one is getting written down and added to our family favorites book.

Lacking a bit, needs a little kick of some kind.

This turned out really good!!  We're not crazy about mushrooms so I replaced the canned mushrooms with a can of cream of mushroom soup.  I also drained about half of the water/chicken juice out of the crock pot before adding the soup/cream cheese mixture so it wouldn't be as runny.  I used 4 large chicken breasts, I'm sure larger than the 4 ounce ones in the recipe but there was plenty of sauce!! Also added some brocolli!

Eh.  It was okay.  Definitely not alfredo, and the chicken turned out dry from cooking in the crock pot without much sauce.

This is very good, but I'm an Alfredo snob and this just isn't exactly Alfredo, but it's very good. I love the zing the Italian dressing gives it.

I'm floored! This will be a favorite meal forever! Easy to prepare and oh, so flavorful! I did tweak the recipe a little:
I cut up the chicken into small pieces, for easy spooning when serving.
I added about 1/2 cup finely chopped onion with the mushrooms and cream cheese mixture. Gave it a nice fresh taste with a little extra texture.
The cream cheese was the lower fat neufchatel cheese; the soup was lower sodium Campbell's Healthy Request condensed cream of chicken soup.
The mushrooms were 8 oz of sliced fresh crimini mushrooms.
Wonderful stuff! My SO raved about it! We will be doubling the mushrooms next time (we love mushrooms)!

This was a hit with my family and the extra bonus was that I had all the ingredients on hand already!

We had this for dinner last night, and we really liked the taste - very rich tasting. The only thing is it was TOO thick - maybe it was in the crockpot too long? Next time I'll thin out with chicken broth.  Also, will probably use lower fat cream cheese. Other than that, awesome taste. Thanks for the posting!

Awesome dish... I used 4 huge breasts, so I doubled the initial water/sesoning mix.  I also did some things that other reviewers suggested, like cutting up the chicken into cubes after the 4 hours (before putting in the cream cheese blend). I used cream of mushroom soup  instead of cream of chicken, and no mushrooms (don't like them- go figure on the cream of mushroom soup).  I did use my own italian dry dressing mix (found on the allrecipes asian site, with the addition of a few shakes of lemon pepper, minced onion & garlic, and italian seasoning salt, and the subtraction of salt) because i did not have any on hand.  Turned out beautifully, even though the timing was longer because of the football game.  I also used linguini because that's what i had.  Deeee-licious!

This was wonderful! My entire family enjoyed it. We made the lower sodium and lower fat version! We did mix in about 1/2c Parmesan cheese. Yummy!

Sauce is fabulous.  I used fresh mushrooms and 2 cloves of garlic.  Cooked on low for 1 hour then added mushrooms and cooked additional 2 hours.  Removed chicken, wisked in softened cream cheese and cream of mushroom soup, returned chicken to crock and cooked on low for one more hour.  Nirvana!

We loved this! I've made this twice now. I cubed teh chicken to make it easier on the back end to eat, and I used 1/3 the fat cream cheese, and 98% fat free and reduced sodium cream of mushroom soup to try to ease this into a more healthier realm. Also used the Barilla Plus pasta. Smelled incredible as it was cooking!

I'm not sure what happened, but for some reason this was just NOT a hit in my family.  It got better as we ate more but the italian dressing/cream cheese flavor was jut a bit "off."  I don't think I'll make again.

This is SO delicious!  I have been looking for easy crockpot meals that my husband can make before he goes to work, and we all loved this one.  Instead of using the dried salad dressing mix, we used bottled dressing.  We also used low-fat cream cheese, the "Healthy" type soup, and added minced garlic and about 1/4 cup of shredded parmesan cheese to the sauce.  We left out the mushrooms, since my kids don't care for them.  This is definitely a keeper!

It hard for me to rate fairly because the new crockpots cook way to hot no matter if it is on low or high ( I keep mine on warm or else other settings will burn the food) The flavor was there but I did double all things "liquid".

Loved it! I'm looking for slow cooker recipes that both me and my husband can eat. The only kind of meat I eat is chicken so this is great. I only used two chicken breasts and it was enough chicken for me. I added carrots and green peppers towards the end. I thought the sauce was looking too thick so I added some water but that was a mistake because I think it would have thinned out a bit by itself after the cream cheese melted in. Anyway, super good and will make it again!

This was really, really good.  I didn't think it could possibly taste like alfredo sauce without the cream and cheese, but I was wrong!!!  I made it just as recipe was written. Will definitely make this again. It was really easy!!!!!

This recipe gets an A for being very economical and a C-/D+ for everything else.  I tried this recipe today and it feel very flat.  I think there are too many flavors that are supposed to mingle well, but didn't.  My sauce came out very lumpy and runny (I may have not let my cream cheese sit out long enough to soften.)  I added some flour to thicken it.  But after the first taste, I was done.  This is definitely something I will not be trying again.

This was excellent. I used low fat soup and CC. Also, I don't like Mushrooms, so I substituted a cup of green peas instead and added some bacon bits to give it more of a Carbonara flavor. Even with all low fat ingredients and bacon bits instead of bacon, it still tasted amazing.

This is amazing.  I used fat free cream cheese and 98% fat free cream of chicken to cut on calories.  I also served it over brown rice. I made bow tie pasta for my husband and son and I liked it better over rice.  I have seen this recipe before many times in the past and have never made it and decided I wanted to. Thankfully found it on this site and it is definetly a keeper.

Great!  I cut 30 min off of the cook time before adding the soup and cream cheese.  We also used bowtie pasta instead of spaghetti.  It turned out really good.  The only thing that's keeping me from giving it 5 stars is that it reminded me a little of tetrazzini tuna helper.

I used fat free cream cheese, and cream of chicken and mushroom soup. While this was good, I think next time i'll use regular cream cheese and try it without the italian mix. I also added some chopped red onions and peas for some color.

Usually, I triple the recipe and add a bag of baby carrots at the beginning of the cooking time, and a box of frozen peas toward the end, with lots of shredded Parmesan and black pepper on the table.  Once the leftover alfredo has cooled, I bag it in single serving sizes and freeze!  It reheats splendidly in the microwave for a quick and delicious dinner.

This is one of my favorite recipes! I cut the cream cheese in 1/2 to save on calories, but it's still delicious. I usually use the canned mushrooms & went with fresh ones this time. Very good!!!

We love this!!!  It has become mu daughter's most requested recipe.  I've added a little extra of the italian seasoning mix to kick it up a little, and sometimes some milk or cream to thin it out, but it's wonderful as is!

I'm not sure that 'alfredo' is a very accurate name for this recipe.  It's not as rich and cheesy as an alfredo sauce is.  However, it is a very good recipe that the whole family will enjoy.  I stirred in some steamed broccoli at the very end and served with a loaf of garlic bread.  Hearty, tasty meal!

I have an XL crockpot and was worried that I wouldn't have enough liquid.  I added 1 cup of bottled dressing (Vidalia Onion Vinaigrette) and it was fantastic!  This is a sure-fire keeper......

I really enjoyed this recipe.  The only thing I changed was I added fresh mushrooms because I prefer those to canned.  I will make this again, it was so easy and very good.

I didn't have salad dressing mix so I just poured on some salad dressing from a bottle.  Still turned out great.  I also added some dried diced onions and served over rice.  I shredded my chicken too. Yummy

Loved this chicken recipe and so did my family!  I changed it a bit, added a package of Ceasor dressing because I did not have the Italian and added a half cup of white cooking wine to the chicken breast in the slow cooker to prevent drying out.  I also added fresh mushrooms the last hour of cooking.  It was very yummy over whole wheat thin spaghetti! Will definately make this again....

Great flavor, mine came out a little salty but that's easily remedied next time. A good meal to "come back to" which is why slow cooker recipes are so good. Come home, boil some pasta, and you've got a delicious supper. I'll definitely make this again.

My family and I were not crazy about this at all. It was a bit on the salty side and was not even near real alfredo sauce. Followed the recipe to a T.

It is a really good recipe. I didn't have Italian dressing mix, so I used Herb and Garlic Seasoning by Knorr (1,7 oz). I diluted it with 1/2 cups of water. Put 4 chicken breasts with a sauce mix in a crock pot for 4 hours. After 4 hours I added to crock pot mix of 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, 1 can of cream of chicken soup and 8oz cream cheese. Mix it all together with the liquid,  put chicken back. 1 hour more and great dish is ready. Thank you for a really good recipe and all reviews. It is staying in my home ;-)

Having made this dish at least 6 times I have to take the time to rate it! I follow the recipe to a "T" using low fat cream cheese, Healthy Request Soup, and low carb pasta. Occasionally, I will throw in a sprig of rosemarry, a splash of wine, extra garlic or parsley. I know how much my family enjoys this meal with healthier products - even leftovers dissapear! If there is any left the next day, they reheat wonderful. This is a very satisfying meal and it really does please everyone in my family (from 1 year to 84)! So glad I found this recipe:)

I used Italian dressing out of the bottle and eliminated the water since I didn't have the dry mix.  I also used dried parsley flakes in place of the fresh.  We really enjoyed it and loved being able to make it in the crock pot.  Thanks so much

Delicious!  I did the low fat version and the end result was creamy and flavorful. Used low fat cream cheese and low fat cream of chicken soup.  Substituted fresh mushrooms for canned mushrooms and used no yolk whole wheat pasta in place of spaghetti.  This is a definite keeper in my recipe box!

I make something very similar to this but without cream cheese.  I will add a little bit (not too much because it gets too salty very quickly) of Italian dressing in dry or liquid form.  I use partially frozen, cut up chix. breast (this will add the liquid) sliced onions, frozen or fresh broccoli and let it go for the day.  When I'm about ready to serve, I add a can or two of cr. based soup (mush, broccoli, celery, or chix.) and while that't heating, I cook up egg noodles, rice, spaghetti, or mashed potatoes and serve the sauce over top.  The onions really give the chicken a great flavor and the options of added veggies is really endless.  This ends up more like a stew/gravy because the cheese is missing, but is a favorite and very versatile.

We thought this was a really good dish.  I made it almost exactly as the recipe stated with a few alterations.  I substituted cream of mushroom soup for the cream of chicken, I added about 1 TBS of butter to the chicken while it cooked and I used reduced fat cream cheese.  I find it interesting reading over some of the other reviews for the dish some say it needs more salt / seasoning while others freaked out over the sodium content.  I think you can manage the sodium to your own tastes.  However, I did think this had enough seasonings as written without adding more.  One reviewer commented on added parmesan cheese and I do believe next time I will add some to the sauce.  The water helped thin the sauce but I think you could easily substitute white wine or some chicken broth.  I’m sure next time I make this dish, I’ll play with it a little bit more.

Fantastic recipe--although it is a Taste of Home published recipe.  The garlic is not necessary at all and cook it much longer so that the chicken falls apart---yum!

This turned out very good.  I will say it was salty but that was from the seasoning mix I used (which I got from this website).  Also keep in mind this dish seems to be made for a small slow cooker.  I have a large one so, while it turned out well, it would be better with a double version.

I LOVE this recipe although I did make a few changes and it was AMAZING. I used low fat herb and garlic cream cheese, added a low fat can of cream of mushroom soup and added a small carton of Alfredo sauce. This made it more creamy and not watery, gave it even more flavour, as well as that little hint of Alfredo taste that was missing! :)

I tripled the amount, used low fat cream cheese,  otherwise followed the exact recipe. 

I cooked the chicken on high for 3 1/2 hours,  took it out,  mixed pre-heated cream cheese,  soup,  liquid from slow cooker together,  cut up the chicken,  put it back in and heated for 1 hour. 

The result - way too salty and thick!! Maybe next time I will try making with low salt soup (maybe smaller amount as well)  and add more water to thin it out a little bit.

This is DELICIOUS!  Another variation is to cook the chicken in the soup/cheese mix and omit the water. You can also toss it over some ready pasta and bake it for a few minutes.  DELISH!

Loved this recipe!  It is also easy to make on the stove top if you are in a hurry and would like a very yummy meal.  Even my 2 year old loves it!

Great stuff! If you cook on high you can cook straight from frozen breasts in the same amount of time. I omitted the 'shrooms cause I'm not a fan. Take the chicken out to shred it and use a whisk to mix the cream cheese and soup in, in the rock pot, really well before putting the chicken back in. The heat of the crock pot makes it easier to mix. I use dry parsley since I rarely have fresh. Also good over rice for leftovers! Kids loved it too!

I make this often. Hubby doesn't like mushrooms, so I leave them out. I've accidentally used cream of mushroom soup, and it turned out yummy that way, too. It's great served over spaghetti noodles, penne, and rigatoni.

Have been without a range for over a week; waiting for a new one.  Trying slow cooker recipes and found this one.  Followed it using low fat cream cheese and added a little white wine with the cream of chicken and cream cheese blend.  It was wonderful; tasted just like a chicken alfredo in a restaurant and without the calories.  Added shredded Asiago cheese to the sauce after plating.  Thank you for a great tasting, easy recipe.

Very good, and very easy.  Make it easier.  I think everybody makes too big a deal cooking pasta.  Put the pasta in the salted water, bring it to a boil, shut the burner off, put a lid on the pot, come back in 20 minutes and it's done perfect.  Drain the pasta and put your dinner together.

I actually had to use chicken thighs because that's all the chicken I had available.  It cut down the cook time.  I also used a two cans of cream of chicken and fresh mushrooms. So yummers!!!  Thank you for posting!

Everyone LOVED this!  I used more italian seasoning and more garlic than called for because we like food with bold flavors.  We don't like 'real' mushrooms in our food so I subbed cream of chicken soup with cream of chicken & mushroom soup. YUM!

Recipe sounded good and has numerous positive reviews, but my family hated it.  I made the recipe exactly as shown.  The more expensive gourmet alfredo sauces sold in jars at the grocery store taste much better than this.

This turned out fantastic!  Instead of water, I used chicken broth with the Italian dressing mix.  I also used a lower sodium cream of chicken soup, reduced fat cream cheese, and fresh sliced mushrooms rather than canned chopped mushrooms.  The combination was wonderful.

Due to a lack of time, I had to cook this on the stove.  I sprayed the pan with cooking spray, put in the chicken and poured the seasoning mix and broth over it, then cooked the chicken breast on medium a few minutes on each side before adding the rest of the ingredients and cooking (covered) on low until it was done.  Chicken was nice and tender, and sauce was very flavorful.

This is a tasty and easy meal that my whole family really liked. The only things I did differently was: use a few more garlic cloves, cooked my chicken a bit longer because they were still partially frozen when I put them in. There was plenty of sauce for the noodles. I served this with broccoli because thats what my kids like but I also think peas would taste great. Definitly making this again!

This was super yummy and very satisfying! I couldn't find fresh or canned mushrooms where I live, so I just used cream of mushroom soup. I did add a little salt at the table, but it didn't need anything else. Will definitely make again!

This was very good and simple to make.  I used fat-free Cream of Mushroom soup instead of Cream of Chicken.  I cooked the chicken in the slow cooker for about 6 hours.  I removed it, shredded it and added it back into the slow cooker after adding the light cream cheese and soup.  I dont think cooking the chicken in the italian dressing mix added anything so I will omit it next time. Served over 1/2 cup of penne pasta.  Satisfying meal for around 300 calories.

Family loved this! So simple to make, which I love.  I only added 1/2 packet of seasoning because I didn't want the taste too strong, this worked fine for us.  I removed chicken after 3 hrs. and cut into small strips then replaced after cc mix was stirred in with juices of chicken. Only needed 3-3.5 hrs max and chicken was very tender.  Served over linguine. Next time I will serve with added broccoli.

We really liked this dish.  I used the Italian dressing mix recipe from  this site as I had none on hand and I must say, this really turned out better than I had anticipated.  The sauce was quite good and the chicken was incredibly moist.  Thanks

Can I just say....yumminess?!  This was so easy and quite awesome.  Added a bit of white when I added the soup and used fresh mushrooms.  Other than that..stayed pretty true.  No need to add extra salt..plenty of that already.  I love cracked black pepper so I felt free to add.  Served over brown rice...YUMMO!

Great recipe, the only change I made was to heat the final sauce (low fat cream cheese, heart healthy cream of chicken soup, a few ladle scoops of he juices from the cooked chicken, half the mushrooms) seperatley and let everyone choose how much sauce to add.  I added the other half of the mushrroms to he chicken in the slow cooker and cooked for about another 20-30 minutes.  THe chicken was tasty both with the final sauce and without.  Definitely a keeper.

Loved this!  It was really good.  I didn't have a pack of the Italian dressing mix on hand, so I looked up a recipe on here for it.  Turned out wonderful!

Oh my goodness, was this good!  I followed the recipe with one exception, which was cubing the chicken instead of cooking the breasts whole.  My daughter asked for seconds, and my hubby had thirds, then proceeded to clean out the remnants inside the crock pot.  There was nothing left!  The only thing I might change in the future is to only use 3/4 of a package of the Italian dressing mix because I think it might improve the overall taste a bit.  This is going into the "keeper" pile.
**Update - made this again but used Healthy Request Cream of Chicken soup instead of regular - this was still delicious even though it cut out a lot of fat.

Delicious.  I used boned chicken breasts but I wouldn't do that again because the yummy sauce had some small bones etc in it.  I will make again soon but use boneless chicken breasts next time.

Love it!!  So good.  My family of six loved it too.  I did double the water and did 2 packages of Italian dressing mix.  It went so good over pasta.  A keeper for sure.  In fact, I have it in the slow cooker right now.

This is one of our family favorites. The crock pot is always licked clean.  :)  I cut up the chicken in cubes before placing in slow cooker and also use the Italian Seasoning Packet from Betty Crocker's Suddenly Salad Pasta Mix.  I just save those noodles for another dish or at times mix them in with the noodles required for this recipe.  This became our staple substitiute for when we first made this and only had this type of italian seasoning on hand.

This recipe came out good.  I made a few adjustments.  I added extra water over the chicken and added mozzarella and lots of parmesan cheese to the cream cheese mixture.  Without the mozzarella and parmesan you tasted too much of the cream cheese.  I also added Roma tomatoes right before serving

This was very good considering it's made without the traditional alfredo ingredients. Very easy to make and the family loved it. Tastes a little more American than Italian, but very tasty. I've already made this several times and always turns out good without a lot of effort. Definitely a keeper!

Didn't turn out the way I expected. The only adjustment made was to use neufchatel instead of cream cheese. Will not be making again.

I made it exactly as written except I omitted the mushrooms. First, it is not even close to an alfredo sauce. Second, it was so rich. The cream cheese flavor was overwhelming (and I guess it doesn't help that apparently I only like cream cheese on bagels). I tried to eat it, but could barely manage two bites. I'm just upset now that I wasted a whole pound of chicken!

This was excellent!!! Very tasty. Loved the flavor. I used fresh, sauteed mushrooms and 2 cloves of fresh garlic and it was delish! Thank-you so much for suggesting cream cheese in the sauce. I would reccomend this for any occasion.

This dish was delicious!  I added fresh mushrooms and next time I make it I will add more veggies and possibly sun-dried tomatoes.  I used cream of mushroom soup as that is what I had in my pantry.  We will be making this again!

Great flavor. However, the sauce is very thick. I love cream sauces but this one was just too thick for me. Next time I will be adding some wine at the end as other reviewers have suggested.

This had great flavor, but I thought the chicken was a little dry.  If I make this again, I would cut the cooking time by about an hour.

I love making easy recipes!  I tripled the garlic in this and used fat free cream cheese.  I diced half the chicken and shredded the rest and served it over egg noodles instead of spaghetti...oops, just realized I forgot the parsley at the end.  It was still a good and easy meal.

Excellent recipe base! Minor changes to this: 4 frozen breasts w/ sprinkled italian dressing on top, 2Tbl minced garlic,2C cream of chicken on top & splash of white wine. After an hr threw in softened cream cheese & 3 4 oz cans of mushrooms. Wonderful! This way everything cooks together without bothering, done in 5 hrs add some Wondra to thicken slightly & add cooked spaghetti!

This was a hit at my house overall.  After reading the reviews, I decided to amp up the spice a bit (we like things with flavor!) and I added about a teaspoon each of cumin and chili powder, and 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper.  I also used fat free cream cheese.  We added some pepper and shredded parmesan cheese before serving.  The whole family ate it up!  The only reason for the 4 stars is that it actually seemed salty to me.  I might try a lower sodium soup or something next time.  And probably a little more spice :)

This was just ok for me. Not as much flavor as I would have liked. It was simple to make, so I liked that part of it. I'll try some tweaks to add more flavor, but as is, it's just ok.

This was a pretty good recipe!  I think we would make this again.  I did take the advice of some other reviews though and used a can of cream of mushroom soup in place of the chopped can mushrooms. I also did not cook the chicken as long as the recipe said.. Total cooking time for me was 3.5 hours - any longer and the chicken would have been dry!

This was very good. I used light cream cheese, and 98% fat free cream of chicken. I also used fresh sliced mushrooms instead of the canned stuff. It was awesome and super easy!

So Yummy!!!!I didn't have any Italian Dressing mix so I made my own using the recipe on this site. Added parmesean cheese and frozen broccoli florets to the sauce. It was amazing!!! Thanks for a great recipe!

LOVED it and was so excited when my husband did too--seems we rarely agree on what we like to eat.  Flavor of sauce was delish and make the house smell great while it cooked.  Could it be improved upon?  Probably, and I am sure that it can be tweeked to personal taste, but it is amazing that something so easy can taste this good.  Thank you for a meal that is going into our regular rotation!

This was good- a tad bit bland- I will double the garlic next time. I also used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken, the flavor was MUCH better, and I didn't need to add canned mushrooms. VERY easy to make, yummy over pasta.

This was a great recipe.  To cut down on calories, only used 4 oz of light cream cheese, otherwise followed directions.  Turned out yummy.  Served over rice.  Will make again.

Great flavor and easy to make. Really good with fresh grated Parmesan on top. The chicken was so tender it fell apart when I removed it from the crock pot. Not a bad thing :)

I cut the breasts in half and when cooked, chopped them, mixed the sauce well and readded chicken to sauce.  The meat was moist and cooked through.  Really good.  I also used fresh mushrooms, diced. The water and juices were perfect amount to thin the soup and cheese to create a good sauce.  My grand kids will love this, but I may replace the water with wine to give it a little more kick and add parm cheese.

This was a very easy meal to prepare (and I  LOVE quick and easy--especially when I'm rushing to go out for part of the day) The results were surprisingly  delicious !  It was so creamy and the chicken came out amazingly tender...I served it with whole wheat linguine (which made it seem a little healthier) and veggies and even my two teenagers loved it...as well as the fussy husband.  Very rich but Excellent main course.  Thank you.

This was surprisingly good.  I didn't expect to care much for the sauce because of the canned soup, but it was very good.  Next time, I will season & brown the chicken before placing in the slow cooker, and I will probably use a different pasta-- maybe penne.

Dont make the mistake of making this with cream of potato soup. Really made it taste weird but thats all I had. Next time I will use the cream of mushroom. Just the italian dressing & garlic would have been ok by itself & making the cream sauce just to go with the noodles perhaps.

I  didn't like this as much as I'd hoped.  The cream cheese made it kinda bland.  If I made this again I might need to tweek it a bit.  On the bright side my toddler twins gobbled it up.

This was surprisingly good. I didn't have cream cheese so I used shredded mozzarella and Parmesan cheese as a substitute. We don't like mushrooms so I used sun dried tomatoes, and it was delicious! The sun dried tomatoes added a nice color as well.

I am giving it 5 stars because it was good as written. I added Italian seasoning, 1/2 cup shaved aged parm, 1/4 cup heavy cream, 2 T butter, 1 cup white wine and garlic salt...voila, instant deliciousness.  Calories, Schmalories.....it was worth every little one. Yummy and better than you'd get in a restaurant.   Served over bow-tie pasta. Omitted mushrooms due to allergy.

This is very good and very easy.  I would not call it Alfredo, though.  It does not taste like a typical Alfredo sauce.  For the dry Italian dressing mix, I used 2 T of the mix from this Allrecipes.com recipe: Italian Dressing Mix

This recipe was delicious...it made the whole house smell wonderful! The only substitutions I made was I created my own Italian seasoning mix by using all the spices I had on hand: garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, basil, pepper, salt and paprika. I also added thawed peas in the last 10 minutes - this was a great dish. Definitely will be making this recipe again and again. Thank you for sharing!

Excellent, creamy alfredo sauce. Never thought of using cream cheese, better than flour & less carbs for sure. Next time I will add more mushrooms, as we love them & also I used the Cr of mushroom soup. I will make this many more times to come, so easy in the crock pot The house smelled so delicious!! This on'e a keeper!

Delicious! My husband said it's the perfect rainy day dinner! Really, it was delicious. Mine ended up in the crock pot a bit longer and was perfect. We cut up the chicken in the sauce after it was done which was easy because it was so tender. We served ours over egg noodles and everybody loved it!

Fantastic...I used cream of mushroom soup and omitted the mushrooms since hubby doesn't like big bits of mushroom, but this was creamy pasta heaven for a date night with him! I'll definitely make this again!

I thought the sauce was incredible, however, even following the recipe, my chicken came out very dry.  I am going to try this recipe again in case it was the cook's (mine) error. Can't wait to have my family try it!!

For a crock-pot meal this one is pretty good.  The sauce was a good consistency, meaning not too runny, and the flavor was alright.  However, taste-wise, there's no comparison to real chicken alfredo.

Very good - made as is other than using Garlic Powder instead of garlic as I didn't have any.  I also forgot to sprinkle parsley.  Will make again for sure.

At first the use of so much cream cheese worried me. I tried it none the less and it blended perfectly with the other ingredients into a delicious sauce! So simple and packed with flavor!

This recipe was great! easy and incredibly tasty. I did increase the gatlic to 3 teaspoons of minced garlic (my husband and I always double/triple the garlic), but that's thr oly modification I made. My 10-year old loved it, too!

I have made something very similar to this recipe in the past and have served it over rice or pasta with a side salad. Very easy and delicious. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and skinless chicken legs, they came out so tender and juicy. I substituted a can of cream of mushroom soup for the cream of chicken soup and omitted the can of mushrooms because I did not have any on hand. Definitely will make this again!

I'm rating what I think I'd give it had I used the right Italian seasoning. I used half a bottle of Italian dressing instead of the mix. I had to ladle out the dressing before putting in the soup and cream cheese mixture or it would have been runny. I liked it alright, but my 7yr old did not. Husband thought it was fine, but not good enough to make again or to even try the "correct" way.

I made this tonight and it was an instant hit for my husband and me.  The only thing I changed in the recipe was, instead of using spaghetti, I used Essenhaus extra wide homestyle noodles.  This meal was absolutely delicious and we will certainly be making this again!

Loved the flavor of this - though, as usual, I didn't have all the ingredients, so I didn't follow it exactly. I really loved the sauce. The chicken, though, was just a bit dry. More than likely because of me than because of the recipe...

New favorite and I'm married to an old school Italian :) fused this with the alfredo sauce recipe as listed in the non cream cheese based one from another popular post. Prepared the chicken as mentioned here and then threw in the other sauce four the last hour before serving.

I was in a pinch for time so I cooked on high for approximately 3 hrs.  I had 2 chicken breasts which I cut thinly and cubed, each breast was then quick cooked with about 1 T of already minced garlic (each breast). Added the juices to the pot, I poured the cream of chicken, dry Italian dressing mix (premixed w/ the water) poured that on top of everything and cooked on high for 2 hrs.  Taste tested and found it to be a bit salty but smelling nice and garlicky so I took some of the juice out and added it to the cream cheese (only had about 3.5-4 oz) and mixed until creamy smooth.  Poured that in w/ the remaining chicken.  I also added about 1/2 c of water.  at the end of 3 hrs I cooked up some linguine and it came out awesome!! Hubby loved it and he's kinda picky eater, wasn't salty at all at the end, very garlicky and this recipe is a keeper as I will make it more!!!  Thank you for posting this!!

Delicious! Ive had a busy work schedule and was looking for a simple slow cook recipe but was in mood for an Alfredo recipe and found this..not exactly an Alfredo taste, but very close..rich, creamy and perfect serving size for 2 with a little left over. The only thing I did differently  was add fresh grated Parmesan cheese and a little extra fresh diced garlic. Yum!

Added sliced portabella mushrooms. Omitted the can of soup and just used the cream cheese and finished the sauce with a splash of sherry and it was so much better than the times I had made previously going by the original recipe. Thickened the sauce with a little cornstarch. Delicous.

This recipe isn't bad but it is  far closer to stroganoff than Alfredo. The entire house was pretty disappointed when I said I was making Alfredo and ended up with stroganoff.

I hate spending time on spaghetti dishes only to come back the next day to find that the pasta absorbed all the sauce and I'm left with dry noodles. Thankfully, that did not happen here. I added broccoli which absorbed some of the sauce, but there was still too much. Not a problem if you have some bread to dip, but the ratio of sauce to chicken and noodle might need a bit of tweaking. Great taste though, I'd make it again

I didn't like the chicken. I also doubled everything for the sauce and just put it over my noodles, it was amazing! I will definitely make this again, but just as pasta sauce.

I followed the recipe fairly closely, just substituted reduced fat cream cheese and fresh rather than (shudder) canned mushrooms.  I felt it needed more flavor, definitely some pepper.  It just felt like something was missing.  Maybe I'll try more garlic next time.

Easy recipe & tastes good, but doesn't taste like traditional fettuccine Alfredo.  Tastes more like chicken spaghetti because of the cream cheese.

i used this as inspiration for another one of bf's lunches.. i deviated a bit from the recipe but loved the outcome.. here are my modifications.. i only used the crockpot for cooking my chicken and pork (about 10-11 oz total) which i had already started cooking before stumbling upon this recipe.. i added the salad dressing mix to the sauce instead (i used 4 servings of Italian Dressing Mix from this site with my modifications).. left out the garlic clove as the dressing mix already has garlic in it.. subbed a cream cheese/greek yogurt blend (6 oz) for the cream cheese, a 6 oz jar of king oyster mushrooms pieces for the chopped mushrooms, and 7 oz of whole wheat rotini for the spaghetti.. i added a 16 oz bag of frozen pepper stir fry vegetables that i thawed out and totally forgot the parsley.. the recipe as is would be a little plain for our tastes but deserves 4 stars for it's adaptability.. ty for the recipe

This is a great recipe! We love it! I even made it for Christmas dinner just for my husband and me. It is super easy and soooo good. I think it is better than the one with all the cream in it.

I make this often! It's delicious! Only thing I do different is drain most of the water out of the crockpot so it is thicker. I'm actually going to make this tomorrow, minus the noodles (we are on a low carb diet :-)

I made this for our church pot luck yesterday. Instead of a garlic clove, I used garlic powder && I instead of fresh mushrooms, I used cream of mushroom soup. It was DELICIOUS!!! I will definitely be making this again and again and again!

Instead of the dry Italian seasoning packet and water, I used a half cup of Italian dressing...  the Olive Garden brand, and added a sprinkling of Penzey's "Tuscan Sunset" seasoning.  The results were very flavorful and tender.  My crew loved it!

I followed the recipe as written with the exception of one thing; I didn't add the mushrooms.  I know it would have been delicious with them, but since my husband doesn't like mushrooms, I left them out.

Wonderful, smooth and creamy, very tasty chicken dish!  And easy to make too!  Thank you for this recipe! It's a keeper!

Didn't have mushrooms, so I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken. Also, just a couple tsp of salad dressing mix to cut down on salt. It was delish!

This recipe was really good, both of my kids thought it was tasty even though my 3 year old was a little picky about eating (as usual). I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but if you choose to I think it will still taste pretty good. I had some time on my hands, so I made a clean version without the canned soups and packet of seasoning using recipes online. The recipe for the cream soup substitute that I used is here: http://centercutcook.com/cream-soup-substitute/ and for the Italian seasoning I did this: http://ppod.wordpress.com/2007/11/14/dry-italian-dressing-substitute/ . I also used a whole container of fresh baby portobella mushrooms, one can of drained diced tomatoes, 3 cloves of garlic, a splash of white wine, low fat cream cheese, and chicken thighs because they always come out better after cooking all day. This is definitely something I will make again.

The family and I all agreed that the taste was wonderful. However the next time I make it I will definitely thicken the sauce because it was way too thin. Also, not sure if I will use the cream cheese next time because it didn't want to smooth out in the sauce. I may try sour cream the next time. Over all a good recipe and will make it again.

This is ALWAYS a hit with my husband and whoever else I make it for! So many people have asked me for this recipe! I make it even more simple by forgetting the garlic and parsley, they really are not needed. I also adjusted the cooking time to about half and half - half the time with just the chicken and dressing mix and half the time with all the other ingredients combined. SO GOOD! I now always make a double batch because we always want leftovers of this meal

Very easy to prepare. More accurately described as Chicken Stroganoff rather than Alfredo. I did as others suggested and chopped the chicken before adding the cream cheese & soup mixture. Probably a lot less messy that way. I used freshly sliced baby portobello mushrooms instead of canned mushrooms. Tasted delicious with some freshly ground pepper added to it.

I decided before I rated this that I would not rate it as an Alfredo recipe since so many people said it didn't taste like Alfredo. It tastes like mushroom soup on noodles with tender chicken. Comforting and easy, but not something I would crave.

My husband loved this! I used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken, put in more garlic bcs I love it, and added frozen spinach. I did not add any salt and it did not need it at all. I also used the amount of water indicated and it was perfect. Will definitely be making it again

I made some changes, but it came out great. Instead of water I used a 14oz can of chicken broth and instead of mushrooms I added a 16oz bag of frozen broccoli florets and a 16oz bag of bell pepper and onion mix. I was making this dish for 5 people and wanted lots of leftovers, so I add to increase the ingredients a bit. I used 2 8oz packages of cream cheese and about 16oz of cream of chicken soup. I also used 3 gloves of garlic (because I really love garlic!). Oh and I used a 40oz bag of frozen chicken breasts and onion soup mix instead of italian dressing mix. It was more soupy that I would've liked, but I think that was due to the amount of chicken broth combined with the juice from the chicken. I didn't have to add any additional seasoning and would definitely make it this way again. Well minus the liquid part. Though if I wanted to use white rice instead of pasta, the liquid would soak in and make the rice taste totally yummy.

I rated this recipe 5 stars because it will be added as a regular dish for my family.  Also because everyone loved it, including two of my picky eaters.  When I came across this recipe I did not have time to slow cook it.  I also did not have dry Italian mix but found a good mix recipe on allrecipes.  So I grilled up the chicken, added the mix and water and added all the rest of the ingredients.  I added chicken broth since it was too thick for my liking.  I also made it with egg noodles.  Next time I will also add sautéed onions.  The Italian seasoning makes this a hit for our family of 6!!

This was OK but I probably won't make it again, basically it tasted like chicken with the soup on top.

We LOVE this recipe. My husband, who has an 'aversion' to anything in the crock pot, loves it too! So simple, fast and great meal for a busy day. I cut the cooking time in 1/2 by cooking on HIGH vs. low. Worked great! Thanks for sharing.

This was very good! The only thing I forgot was to add some peas as mentioned in another review. I love Alfredo with peas. But while cooking it made the house smell so good. Will be making this again.

Just ok. Tastes too much like chicken and the chicken in the crockpot shreds and the whole thing reminded us if tuna. Next time I will try the sauce alone and grill the chicken breasts; I think one can of soup and maybe the other some form if cream would be better.

I was a skeptic.  It seemed so simple, too good to be true. But this turned out really really yummy. I made it low fat and it was still creamy and delicious. I have to agree with everyone else and give it a 5.  You must try it.

I love this recipe but I don't put the chicken in until later because I make the blackened chicken recipe and add my chicken in the last couple of hours. It makes it taste like Red Lobster 
Cajun Chicken Linguini Alfredo...so good! Gives it a little kick!

I'm glad I added two healthy tablespoons of Parmesan cheese, while mixing the Cream of Chicken soup and cream cheese till smooth; really brought out a nice Italian flavor! While heating up my well oiled (gas)grill, I trimmed all fat from my chicken breasts--treating them with "whispers" of salt, pepper, garlic powder and Cajun spice. I also added nicely sliced mushrooms. Grilled chicken for about 6 minutes, each side--resting them for 15 minutes, tightly covered with aluminum foil over a plate before thinly slicing them. Aside that, I followed the recipe instructions--and my family LOVED it!! With a family of 4, I think I'll double the creamy sauce part

This was a good recipe, but I did make a couple of changes.  The amount of cream cheese seemed overwhelming, so I cut it in half. Cooked the chicken as per the recipe.  Then I took the cooked pasta and put it in the bottom of a casserole dish, sprinkled some fresh shredded parm on it, topped it with the chicken, then poured the mixture of 1/2 the cream cheese, chicken soup and mushrooms on top.  Sprinkled with parsley and some more fresh parmesan and put it in the oven on 350 for about 20 minutes.  Yum.  A great Italian chicken pasta bake.

This recipe in its original form is fantastic!  However, I have a friend who is lactose intolerant so I'm experimenting with recipes I love with diary substitutes.  For this recipe, I substituted the cream cheese for garlic and herb Tofutti - only 4 oz. because it's quite garlicy.  I also added half a small container of lactose free plain yogurt (I can only find these items at Whole Foods).  I omitted the cream of chicken soup.  But used 1/2 c milk (lactose free) and added chicken bouillon to taste.  This turned out pretty good but would love to hear from others who have lactose challenges.

Pretty good. Would prefer more sauce or for it to be more creamy. I would add more spices & I did use fresh mushrooms instead of canned.

I made a double recipe using 1 can cream of chicken soup, 1 can cream of mushroom soup, and  13 ounces of light cream cheese. I made my own dry salad dressing mix by making half a recipe of Italian Dressing Mix from this site. I cooked it on low for 1-1/2 hour, then on high for 2 hours, then back on low for an hour after adding the sauce (4-1/2 hours total). It came out great; my family loved it, and there wasn't much left over. My daughter asked me for the recipe.

This was pretty good.  I didn't have the dry seasoning packet, so I found a recipe for it on this website.  Although it said it was the equivalent of one pack, I think it was more, so when done, it was a little strong.  I put everything in he slow cooker is the morning because I wasn't able to add the cream cheese half way through and it turned out fine.

Tastes better the 2nd day. DS loved this. Revision 4/7/14: this is a quick meal to make in the afternoon and have it ready for dinner. I was a little worried about all the sodium in the pouch mixes, but you can easily make your own dry Italian dressing. Instead of cream of mushroom soup, I used cream of golden mushroom, which came out a little darker, and I used a tiny bottle of white moscato wine. I thought it would be too sweet, but the flavor evened out as it cooked. I used fresh, sliced mushrooms, which shrunk down a lot. Next time I won't cut the large ones in half to retain the flavor. I forgot the fresh parsley at the end, but it survived 3 freezes in our garden, so I think we'll have it year-round, and next time it'll add a nice burst of freshness. I served the chicken over angel hair pasta, just because we had several boxes, and it was good. I'll mark this as a keeper, and next time, I think the flavor will improve using blsl chicken thighs. Happy cooking!

This was fantastic and the hubby ,who is a picky eater, loved it as well. I only made a couple of changes.  I added fresh mushrooms near the end as well as used 1/3 fat cream cheese to lessen the calories and fat.

It was very good. I served it with hot penne and hubby really seemed to like it.  Make sure you soften the cream cheese really well so it mixes easy with the cream of chicken soup.

This is a favorite in our house! The only thing I do different is I don't use a clove of garlic but just buy a jar of already minced and I think it works the same. I used a clove the first time I made it and it was too much trouble pressing the garlic.

This was pretty good. I used fresh mushrooms and added a few basic seasonings: salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder, and just a little red pepper. I found the sauce a bit too thick, so next time I'd probably try thinning it out with some chicken broth.

this was just OK. Nothing like alfredo to me. Was too thick when finished so I added a ladle and a 1/2 of the starchy water from the pasta. Probably won't make again.

We really liked this... I made the sauce on the stovetop (used chicken broth instead of water for more flavor)  and grilled the chicken (sprinkled it with steak seasoning) We also added broccoli. Will make this over and over! Thanks for the recipe

Great recipe! Made it last night and the whole family loved it, even my picky nine year old gobbeled it up quickly! It is sooooo good!! I will definately add to my rotation. Not to mention how fast and easy it is. However, I left out the garlic and mushrooms and served over egg noodles. Fabulous!

This was good. I actually made it w/shrimp - put the shrimp in an hour before sauce is done cooking, to avoid being overcooked. A note, though: DO NOT eat this as leftovers. Eat it right away fresh because the consistency is not very good after being re-heated.

This recipe is FANTASTIC! Best chicken alfredo I have ever had. In fact, my husband told me that this was one of the better things I have ever made. It tasted very salty to me, which I thought was perfect.

This recipe was a hit with my husband and 5 kids.  I also use it to take meals to sick friends and new moms.  A terminally ill girlfriend found most foods too hard to eat or not tasty but she loved this.  Her family was so appreciative and effusive in complimenting the dish.  We now lovingly call it Susannah's Chicken.

This was a big hit at my house!  I didn't have Italian dressing mix so used 1 cup bottled Italian dressing instead.  I also used 2-1/2 pounds of chicken and cut it into chunks and there was plenty of sauce.  Will definitely make again.

My family loved it.   I used 1 can of cream of mushroom and chicken soup.  I did not use the can of mushrooms.  I also used light cream cheese.  I put my chicken in frozen and it turned out very tender.  I pulled it apart with fork before serving.

I wasn't sure about this when I saw the ingredients, but my husband and I tried it and LOVED it!  It's so easy, and tasty!  We make this at least once a month, sometimes more!  I did add in more garlic, since we are huge garlic eaters, and added in some more spices to taste.  But over all this is a great recipe!

We LOVED this!!!  I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  Also, before adding soup/cream cheese mixture, I cut the whole breasts into bites.  Before serving, we added fresh parmesan cheese and it was oh-so delicious.  I served with a caesar salad.  DEFINITELY a do-agin at our house.

It was good, but nothing sensational.  The sauce ended up being much too thick and rich with the amount of cream cheese, so I had to add another can of soup with some milk to balance it out, which I'm sure has some effect on my results.  Nobody in my family would eat the leftovers, so I doubt I will repeat.

This is really a five star recipe! It so easy to make! The only changes I made was I substituted a can of cream of mushroom instead of using canned mushroom and cream of chicken soup. I served this with hawaiian sweet rolls for dinner. It was wonderful!

My family loved this recipe even though I messed it up a bit!  I followed the recipe exactly as shown EXCEPT, when I mixed the cream cheese and the soup together I thought no way would this become creamy, so I added a can of chicken broth.  BIG mistake - it was way too thin.  Follow the recipe exactly and your family will love you.

YUMMY! I used weight watchers cream cheese and low/reduced sodium cream of chicken soup. I only used 1/2 of package of Italian dressing mix and up'd the water to about 1/2 cup so we would have a little more gravy.  I used penne noodles since that's what I had on hand. I also added a can of peas last 10 or so mins. Used frozen chicken breast  (I seasoned my chicken with garlic powder, onion powder, Tony's seasoning and some poultry seasoning) and up'd cook time by an hour (even though it ended up cooking longer since I had other things to do).  My family loved this! Next time I will add mushrooms or broccoli or maybe some artichoke hearts!!

It was ok for quick and easy.  I left out the cream cheese and added about two tablespoons of sour cream.  The dish would have been better overall had I added fresh vegetables to give it color.  As it was served, it looked pretty bland.

I felt the dish needed more spice to it which is why I gave it 3 stars.  My daughter liked it without any added seasonings but for my husband and I added some Tony Chachere's Creole Seasonings and for my husband who likes things really spicy I even added a few shakes of Cayenne Pepper.

We thought this was fantastic, and my boyfriend said I better hold onto this recipe. The only changes that I made was that I added a few green onions to cook, and threw in a little fresh basil about 10 minutes before serving. I will definitely be making this again!

This dish is pretty tasty but ... it definitely needs more garlic. It would also benefit from sliced onion and extra mushrooms.    UPDATE - So when I reheated this for leftovers I added about 1/4 cup of Kraft Calorie-Wise Dressing, 1/2 c up diced red onion, 1/2 cup diced red pepper and two more garlic cloves minced. SOOOO much better this time around!

Very tasty.  I made a few changes that made it a bit more flavorful.  I used four cloves of garlic and instead of canned mushrooms I sauteed wild mushrooms and shallots and used those.  I used low fat cream of chicken soup and low fat cream cheese.  I also used thighs instead of breasts.  Right before serving I also added a small can of peas for color.  Great recipe!

I made this with what I had on hand.  Cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken.  I had an envelope of Good Seasons Mild Italian, instead of the regular Italian.  I also had Neufchatel cheese.  It was good, but I think you should go with the regular Italian Dressing, or at least 2 envelopes of the mild one.  I adore garlic so I added more that the recipe called for.  Still a keeper, I'll just follow the recipe next time.

First time I'm reviewing anything. I really liked this recipe but I made it on the stove top. I also used fresh mushrooms which I fried some in olive oil separate. When it didn't look to me like it was going to be enough I added another cream cheese and a can of mushroom soup. Also, I added a little more water as this is very thick but very tasty....Thanks alot

This was very good, and very easy to make. I made very slight changes; I replaced the canned mushroom with sauteed sliced fresh mushrooms (about 1 cup). Also I added some shaved parmesan to the top when the food was plated. This made great leftovers as well!

So good and so easy.  What's not to like?  The only downfall is the high fat content.

This tasted great! It was easy to make. I didnt use any water as directed by the other reviews, used healthy choice cream of chicken, and nuefchatel (sp??) cheese instead of the cream cheese.  Came out great. Served over whole grain pasta and added fresh mushroom and broccoli. YUM!

My husband said this dish is a keeper! I used chicken broth instead of the water and I added some heavy cream near the end of cook time. I think next time I might add veggies.

A new favorite! I doubled this recipe to feed the whole family of 6. I used wide egg noodles because that is what I had on hand. This meal is perfect! Fast, easy and very good! Even my picky eater said "when can we have this again". Thank you for a new family meal that everyone loves!!

This was very good, very easy. Don't even have to go the whole 4 or 5 hours. I didn't have dry Italian dressing so just used the liquid Italian I had on hand. Also added some baby broccoli florets and about 1 1/2 cups of shredded x-tra sharp cheddar. Substituted the parsley with fresh chunky basil that I grow year round. Also chopped the chicken up into bite size pieces after it had cooked a couple of hours.  Nice thin sauce - LOVED the tangy flavor of it.

This was really good.  I didn't have time to put it in the crock pot so adjusted the time to go in the oven.  After mixing the italian seasoning & garlic and pouring over the chicken, I covered it with aluminum foil and baked at 325 for 30 min. Then I poured the soup and cream cheese mixture on top, covered again and baked another 30 min.  The chicken was tender and juicy and the sauce creamy.  I will certainly make this again and try it in the crock pot next time.

Good Flavor!  Kids loved it.  I added 1/2 cup Parmesan Cheese to thicken the sauce a bit.  I think I might like bow tie pasta better, but the kids said it didn't matter.

How can this be called Alfredo when there is no Parmesan cheese in it. Other than that, it was spectacular.

This was delish! My broyfriend is very very picky and he loved this recipe. I didnt add mushrooms or use parsley and it was still wonderful. I also didnt cut up the chicken breasts - I just put 2 whole chicken breasts in the crock pot and put the ingredients over it and then when it was time to serve I just placed the chicken on the plate and we both scooped up some noodles and put some of the remaining sauce over it and it was fabulous! I definatly recommend it :)

This chicken alfredo was very good.  After cooking according to the recipe, I took the chicken out and added some milk to the sauce to thin it out a bit.  Very tasty!

I accidentally bought bone on chicken but it still worked.  I also cooked it less time since a friend said it was too dry after the full time.  At 3 hours in I pulled the chicken off of the bone and it was fully cooked at that point so it could even cook less time.  I also used granulated garlic instead of fresh and added an can of condensed cream of mushroom soup since I didn't have mushrooms in the house.  It made more sauce and added the mushrooms I was missing to the mix.  Everyone liked the recipe and I think I will be making it again.

Absolutely delicious. Did not have cream of chicken soup, so substituted garlic cream of mushroom soup, however worked very well with this substitution. Did everything else the same. Very easy to make. Everyone loved it. Thanks for recipe.

Absolutely wonderful. I didn't have the dry italian mix so I used italian dressing and cut back on the water. I also shredded the chicken. Soooo good.
