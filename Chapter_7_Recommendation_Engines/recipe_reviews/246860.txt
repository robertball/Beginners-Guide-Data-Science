I scaled to 3 servings as I had 4 oz of the margarita mix to use up.
I used half club soda and half ginger ale to counter the sweetness of the mix and cranberry juice. 
I also added a lime sliced as I like the lime flavour in margaritas.
It was really tasty and a nice addition to our Mexican themed dinner.
