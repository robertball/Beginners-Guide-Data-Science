4.5  Pesto and Potato Salad Lovers rejoice!!!  My red potatoes were about the size of a golf ball or smaller so it made no sense to peel them;scrubbed well and sliced after cooking.  Added a small amount of Dijon Mustard and sliced some fresh basil to add with the red onion on the top for garnish and flavour.

Delicious... great summer salad, our favs including fresh basil and potatoes. Did not know how many 10 potatoes would equate to - best to state as weight, therefore, I used 3 lbs of gourmet red potatoes (golf ball sized) and doubled everything else. Also, did not add additional salt since I used store-bought pesto (6 tablespoons = 3 oz) and it was pretty loaded with salt....Was perfect for our needs!
