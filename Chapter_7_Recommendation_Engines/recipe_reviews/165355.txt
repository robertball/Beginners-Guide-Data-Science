These are incredible! I made them for an "all appetizer" dinner party and they were a huge hit.  I will make them again regularly.  They are quite sweet so they would also be great on a dessert or brunch menu!

These were a big hit when I made them! 
 
However, I recommend cutting the amount of brown sugar. I used only 2 tablespoons in the butter that was spread over the bread, and only 2 teaspoons in the fruit topping.

Made this little easy appetizer for my wife's bridge group.  It was a huge hit and have already had to make two more batches.  Simple and sweet!

Did this with strawberries instead of plums, and Fabulous!  I sliced up a french bread from Wal-Mart, and the colors made a fantastic presentation.  I also used the recipe for glazed walnuts from this website, since goofy me accidentally picked up plain chopped ones, and those things really had a good flavor.  All my guests commented on how sophisticated and delicious this dessert/appetizer was.  The only reason I had any left was because there were so few people invited and the enormous amount of other things I offered.  Thankfully, I had the leftovers to eat for breakfast, and the lime juice/berry mixture soaked into the bread nicely.. in other words, they keep well and this would be ideal for a brunch take-along. :)  Thanks for such a great recipe :)

This was a nice change of pace summer appy.  I used long French bread cut into .25" slices.  I did not measure butter, just eyeballed, and only used 2TBLS Splenda brown sugar blend and 1 tsp cin for 12 slices.  I used 1 peach, 1 plum, and 2 kiwi for my fruit.  DH loved them, as did his family.  I thought they were just ok.  But, I am kind of weird (I would have rather had the fruit, plain, and the non-toasted bread w/some butter).  I will make them again, though, because they were a big hit.

What a great appy to serve a bunch of women!  They loved it.  My first time making a bruschetta of any kind.  Ended up using a french loaf sliced in fairly thin peices---next time I think I will try broiling on one side and turning the slices over  adding the butter/brown sugar mixture and broiling on that side.  I was afraid the fruit mixture would soak thru making the bruschetta soggy, but, it actually held up well.  I used the "Sugar Glazed Walnuts" recipe on AR.

SO GOOD!!!
i cut the recipe in half, because i thought 24 seemed like too much. i wished i hadn't! my 21-month old ate 4 of them, and he has a very tiny tummy! i only used peaches, because that's all i had on hand. at first, i chopped them a little to coarsely, so i had to go back & make them smaller. i'll probably make these again tomorrow, because they're SO DELICIOUS!!! thanks for the recipe!!!!

Fantastic dessert or appetizer. I will make this over and over. I did follow the advice of others and cut back on the sugar.

Very good but very sweet!  I'll cut back on the sugar next time.  I thought the lime juice gave it a great flavor.  A very pretty snack/appetizer for a very cheap price.  I used the Sugar Glazed Walnut recipe from this site for the nuts but ended up burning all the walnuts I had so I substituted pecans (using same recipe) instead.

This was delicious!  My husband isn't a big nut person so I left out the walnuts, but it turned out really well.  Would definately recommend this.

This was a WONDERFUL recipe and everyone at the BBQ I brought it too gave it RAVE reviews. I traded out peaches and plums for blueberries and rasperries because it was the 4th of July and I wanted a simple red and blue dessert. The best part, the ease of the recipe and it looked amazing on the plate.

Used as a guide and adapted to what fruit I had on hand. This was EXCELLENT and I don't think you could go wrong with slight variations.  Half of it got eaten by family and friends as I was putting the rest on the bread rounds.  Can't wait until summer to make this again. THANKS!

This recipe is fabulous!  It goes together easily, although don't put the fruit mixture on the bread slices until just before serving so that the bread does not get soggy.  I used peaches, nectarines, plums, and strawberries in my fruit mixture and the addition of the brown sugar and lime juice is perfect!  Will definitely make again and again.

Took more time to make than expected, but well worth it. This was great! The butter, cinnamon and sugar mixture is great on toast by itself!

Very good!  Couldn't find the candied walnuts (live in a small town), so I just left them off and it was still very good.  My "meat & potato" husband even liked it!

I made these for a co-worker's birthday and everyone loved them. I had to use lemon juice instead of lime. I thought they were great too except that the bread's crust was really tough to bite.

What a great appetizer/summer snack.  I took this to a pot luck today and it was a hit.  I wasn't able to find ripe peaches so I used peach pie filling combined with drained canned peaches.  I also used slivered almonds which I toasted rather than walnuts.  For a bit of color I topped each serving with a few dried cranberries.  YUMMY!!

WOW! A huge family hit. We made it as a dessert! Keep your eye on the bread when you broil it to make sure that you dont burn them! A recipe that our family will use for years to come!
