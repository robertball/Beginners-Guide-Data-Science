My sister was the one who discovered this recipe on Allrecipes.com and made a few modifications which made the meatloaf even tastier. First, chop a large onion and mince (about) 3 cloves garlic.  Coarsely chop 1 pound mushrooms (any variety you prefer) and saute along with onion and garlic until soft.  Add mixture to the rest of meatloaf ingredients along with 1 teaspoon salt and freshly ground pepper to taste. Mix everything together well and set aside in the refrigerator for 2 hours for flavors to meld.  It's also better to do a free-form loaf rather than baking it in a pan as it a free-form loaf browns better and allows excess fat to drain off.  Follow the above modifications for an outstanding meatloaf.  We served the meatloaf with the Awesome and Easy Creamy Corn Casserole (also from Allrecipes.com), grilled asparagus and baked potatoes.

Reviews are one of my favorite things about allrecipes and I use them to (I think) make better recipes.  Since some people said this was dry, I only used one cup of stuffing mix.  For more flavor I chopped fine one carrot, half a stalk of celery, some red onion, two cloves of pressed garlic, and a little dry thyme (did not saute-they cook up nicely while the meatloaf bakes).  All the other ingredients I left the same.  Then I used half a can of whole cranberry sauce, 1/4 cup catsup, and 1/4 cup mustard to glaze.  This made for a healthy (for meatloaf) main dish that my husband raved about.

I'll be honest; I didn't make this per the recipe on the first try. There were so many reviews saying it was dry and/or bland ... I tweaked it right out of the gate. I'm glad I did! It was FANTASTIC. Here's what I did:

I used 20 ounces of turkey, and a 6 oz package of turkey stuffing. I mixed two cups of the stuffing (2/3 of the package) with a cup of water (about the proper amount per the package, minus a bit to allow for turkey juices), plus 1/2 tsp chicken bouillon.  To this I added the turkey, one egg, one stalk of celery chopped small, about the same amount of diced yellow onion, and the following seasonings: garlic, marjoram, thyme, rosemary, ginger, white pepper, celery salt, and sea salt. These were eyeballed. I was liberal with the salt and garlic - a few decent shakes of the rosemary, thyme, and white pepper, and small dashes of the marjoram, ginger, and celery salt. I plunked it in a loaf pan and kind of settled it down in with a spoon making ridges in the top (so it wasn't domed). The remaining cup of stuffing I mixed with 2/3 cup of water and poured over the loaf. I recommend baking to the internal temperature - mine took longer than an hour. I did make turkey gravy to pour over top, but it didn't need it! It was flavorful and moist! Hubs (picky) went back for seconds! As an added plus, it looked GORGEOUS with the baked stuffing on top. YUMMY!

(I gave it 4 stars because it wasn't the actual recipe. What I did make I would definitely give 5 stars.)

This is a great simple recipe.  My five year old, who never eats anything that I cook, loved it.  I, too, served it with a jar of turkey gravy, which I poured on top for the last 15 min of cook time.  I spooned out the run-off gravy and topped mashed potatoes with it.  With corn, it was a perfect meal, and enjoyed by all.

This was probably some of the best meatloaf I have ever had, it was so moist!  We were out of milk so I used chicken stock, and next time I think I will add some garlic and rosemary or poultry seasoning, but over all, it was great.

Easy, delicious, cooks well either in the oven or the crockpot.  Some other ingredients that work are: garlic, onion, poultry seasoning, chicken broth, and/or sauteed celery.  Just a very adaptable recipe!

This is really a fantastic base recipe to use, and it's very easy to experiment with. I halved the recipe (only had a little over one pound of turkey) and replaced the chicken stuffing with cornbread stuffing.  I also added one sauteed onion, a can of stewed crushed tomatoes (drained), 1/2 tsp. marjoram, and 1/2 tsp. garlic powder.  It's an eclectic assortment of stuff, but my husband and two-year old son loved it, and it was much healthier than the food my son normally loves to eat.  I covered it with foil while baking, but there were so many juices that I would recommend covering it for only about half the bake time if you're concerned about dryness.

I also used this recipe as a foundation. I chopped a whole onion, and minced 4 cloves of garlic and a medium-sized carrot - i sauteed all of these until they were fairly soft. I added this mixture to the turkey, the stuffing (i used the low sodium version), egg beaters (instead of whole eggs). I also added 2 teaspoons of mustard, as well as some freshly ground black pepper. I served the meatloaf with some prepared gravy and it was wonderful!

This was a good way to make ground turkey. The stuffing was a great addition. It was a little dry, but easily remedied with some turkey gravy over the top. Even my one year old loved it! I'll make it again for sure.

Everyone loved this recipe! I too added chopped onion, garlic and seasonings. For once, I didn't have any ground turkey in the house, so I had to  ground beef instead. I then made a brown gravy with the drippings and served with mashed spuds. Terrific idea Michelle!

I read the other reviews and added some onion soup mix and garlic powder.  My daughter loved it.  I, however, hated it.  I think it was the cooking time (or maybe my oven)  I think this needs to cook around 75-80 minutes so the stuffing is not so mushy.  Maybe I will try it again.

My family enjoyed this recipe, I made it a little differently - I used 3lbs of ground turkey, added a dash of garlic powder and 1 cup dried cranberries then divided it between 2 loaf pans.  I only gave it 4 stars since it still seems a bit bland.

I made this with a blend of white turkey and dark. I added chopped onion, more sage, thyme, and glazed it with cranberry ketchup (half cranberry sauce, half ketchup). In the end, we thought it was a tasty turkey meatloaf, but didn't have the Thanksgiving flavor that I had hoped for. I would make it again.

Great! I saw one review that said this was a little bland... Knowing that, I added some more spices and dried cranberries to the meat. Then topped it with a little gravy and served with a side of whole cranberry sauce. Goes great with mashed potatoes. Great recipe idea.

I used the reviews to add extra stuff: carrots, celery, garlic, onion pwdr.  This is a great base recipe and love using up extra stuffing.  Thanks!

My friend made this for us. She added chopped Vidalias and mushrooms sauteed in basil and garlic flavored olive oil, as well as a little salt, pepper, and red pepper.

I do not like ground turkey and was given some from a friend. I made this recipe and could not believe how easy it was and how great it tasted. It has all the flavor of a turkey dinner with dressing.

Excellent, easy meal.  I added dried onions, crushed garlic clove, S&P and some spices.  It was definitely a hit with the family. 4 stars b/c I altered it some.  This one is going into dinner rotation.

Too many bread crumbs with the turkey making the loaf extremely dry. Needs ground dark meat of turkey and added broth.

Ok..been thinking about this recipe (adding on to my original review) and I think if you are having it for Thanksgiving it may be fine as is.   Cranberries,potatoes,gravy etc,all the fixins' you may just want to leave it alone...may be just right.  Thinking, if you are making it for a weeknight meal, spice it up.   Really good for a base recipe.  I normally do not complain about bland,but just needs something.  I cut the recipe in half and maybe that is the problem also.  I did put sauteed onion,garlic,salt,pepper and some poultry seasoning...just not enough.   I made a turkey meatloaf years ago that had the whole cranberry sauce in it and that was excellent  (long lost)..I think that would be good in this recipe..will try again as a base recipe.  The more I think about It I am betting that when you cut the recipe in half you just don't get all the seasoning from the stuffing mix, and that could contribute to the lack of taste.

This was delicious with a few alterations. I'm not sure what was different, but it was very moist despite the fact that I only added one egg and NONE of the milk. I also used only two pounds of ground turkey and two+ cups of stuffing. I used frozen ground turkey and left the water from it in the bowl after defrosting (about 1 tablespoon). So, that may have helped. I also added sauteed onion and garlic, about 2 teaspoons worstershire sauce, and salt and pepper. It was great and the whole family loved it. It was very similar to a ground beef meatloaf, so this will be my permanent healthy replacement.

I thought this was very good.  I did add sautéed carrot, celery and onion but other than that I stuck to the recipe.  My family loved it!  I also served it with turkey gravy.

I wanted to use up my leftover holiday gravy, dressing and dried cranberries from the freezer, so decided to try this recipe with these changes. I used the ground turkey, eggs, some dressing(since it already had moisture add, I omitted the milk), then added dried cranberries and added more seasoning & sage, as many reviewers recommended. After baking, I served turkey gravy over it with mashed potatoes, the rest od the dressing, & a side salad. It put me in the mood for Thanksgiving dinner so I made Pumpkin Pie Cake III from AR for dessert. yummm!

This turned out pretty good, better than my previous attempts at turkey meatloaf. I added a cup each of finely diced onions and celery, left out the milk and eggs, and poured a cup of hot chicken broth over the stuffing. It was very good and tasted more like a really hearty stuffing than a meatloaf. Cook temp was perfect- don't over cook! I was worried about leaving the loaf uncovered while cooking, but it didn't burn and made a nice crunchy topping. I didn't add ketchup or mustard because I wasn't trying to make MEAT loaf and it came out a good balance of juicy and crunchy.

Good way to use turkey breast but I added items to make it more like a traditional meatloaf.  Try adding about 1/2 cup ketchup, garlic and top it off with a small can of tomato sauce last 15 minutes of baking.

I loved this recipe, but I did add a couple things based on the previous reviews.  I halved the recipe, and added some salt, black pepper, and garlic powder for some extra flavor.  I also spooned turkey gravy over top of it for serving.  It's super easy and definitely good.

I like to follow the advice of others who have reviewed a recipe... on that note I took the advice to add more seasonings.  It was still a bit blah for my taste.  I don't think I'll use turkey for meat loaf again.

I like to follow the advice of others who have reviewed a recipe... on that note I took the advice to add more seasonings.  It was still a bit blah for my taste.  I don't think I'll use turkey for meat loaf again.

I, as the other have, tweaked the recipe. I made a small stuffing from scratch and mixed it with turkey. In my stuffing, I used .5 lb of sausage. It gave it great flavor. The meatloaf was pretty good (with gravy on it) but I think the real treat will be sandwiches with cranberry sauce tomorrow. Mmmm, the moist maker!

delicious! We had a pre-thanksgiving craving that this meatloaf satisfied! Thanks for this creative, easy and adaptable recipe! 
I followed recommendations from other reviews and added garlic and onion and celery since I had it. We served it with veggies, sweet potato fries and cranberry sauce just for the extra thanksgiving touch

I thought this was a great, simple recipe. I added garlic powder, 1 packet of chicken bouillion, onion powder, parsely flakes, 2 Tbsp of ketchup & 2 Tbsp of A-1 sauce.  I served it with homemade mashed  potatoes, corn & spinach.  Everything was wonderful!!

Good, fast recipe.  Very tasty.  Like other reviewers, I would also add just a little more seasoning -- perhaps some garlic salt and onion.  Also, I made the cranberry sauce that another reviewer mentioned and it was awesome!  I used a small can of jellied cranberry sauce and mixed it with some ketchup and mustard.  I spread it on top before baking.  Yum!  We will make this again!

Very, very tasty. I was glad to see how well it all held together. The only thing I changed was cutting the recipe in half, as there were only 2 of us eating it. It was really easy to make, and I served it with green beans. The only thing I would suggest is having some gravy!

Excellent turkey recipe. We are always looking for GOOD lower fat recipes (using turkey in place of beef, etc.) This meatloaf was perfect - I wouldn't change a thing. My family absolutely loved it.

Lower the fat in this tasty dish by using 3 egg whites and water. Add any extras to give more flavor, I add onions and garlic (a friend of mine adds peppers). This is a great 2 point per serving for those on Weight Watchers when prepared as mentioned above. My picky (and I do mean picky) toddler absolutly adores this! Very easy to make too! Sometimes to give the more tradional meatlaof appearence, I add tomato sauce. Not necessary, but tasty nonetheless!

This was great!  We are very health conscious and used just egg whites which tasted great!  Next time, I may add a bit of salt and pepper to the meat.

I made this a few weeks ago and have been dying for it again! I made a gkaze by adding warm water to cranberry sauce and coated it.  I did not add the eggs - My loaf was only 1/2 lb so a bit different but the leftovers were fabulous with cranberry sauce on bread - like having thanksgiving on a sandwich and even tastier as a left over!

I'm so happy I found this recipe! I have not had much luck with ground turkey recipes. This is the first one that ws a hit with the family, including my super picky daughter who is HAPPILY eating leftovers for breakfast as I type. I didn't give it 5 stars only because I imagine if you followed the recipe exactly it would be bland. I sauteed garlic, onion, and celery and mixed that in with salt and poultry seasoning. It also took about 90 minutes to cook instead of 60.

I didn't add the milk but did add some sauteed carotts, onion and garlic.  It was delish!!!  Everyone loved it and we are eating the leftovers tonight!  
We opened a can of cranberry sauce to eat with it but it didn't need it at all.  I also served it with carotts and potatoes.  Next time I may add some spinach to the mixture.

Not that lucidnoodle will ever be back to read this, but this wasn't a good test of ground turkey if you've never had it -- I think you need to be used to using it to like this recipe.  That said, I'm used to ground turkey and still thought this was only OK.  I've made turkey burgers with stuffing before and those were great, so I thought this would be similar.  It was definitely easy, but also definitely needed more done to it.  (And since I rate the recipes and not my "fix" of the recipes.... after all, I could fix it up and make it like the Salsa Meatloaf on here that I made with ground turkey, but then it would be *that* recipe.) I did like someone's idea to make sandwiches of it -- that might actually be pretty good.

This was quite good.  Very moist and flavorful.  But I agree with some of the other reviewers, it needed some veggies -- I put onion in mine and it was good.  Next time I'll probably add celery and/or carrot as well.  Served with turkey gravy (and ketchup for dipping!).

I liked it, my husband didn't care for it too much. I added a pack of dry onion soup mix, and it was a little much. Next time I'll use just 1/2 a pack of the onion mix. 
It's a little dry, be sure to make lots of brown gravy!

This was OK.  My husband bought extra lean ground turkey breast which I think didn't contain enough fat, because it came out REALLY dry.  Also, it took 1 hour 25 minutes to reach 165 degrees which probably contributed to the dryness.  Next time I will buy the ground turkey with more fat and cover it while baking.

Very easy and delicious.  I used the Butterball Sage and Onion stuffing mix and then added a little more dried sage and marjoram for extra flavor.  Loved it served with turkey gravy and mashed potatoes. YUM!  Will definitely make again.

I made this recipe for some friends because it was so easy, and it was a last minute dinner.  It was great!  I did add some chopped onion, salt and pepper, Old Bay seasoning, and about a tablespoon of mustard.  I also used an egg substitute. I will definitely make this one again!

This is by far the best turkey meatloaf recipe I've tried. I took some of the suggestions from other reviews and added vegetables - one carrot, a small onion & 2 celery ribs, diced finely and sautéed until soft. I also added some minced garlic, sage and fresh thyme. My husband absolutely raved about this dish and can't wait to have it again!

I made this exactly to the directions except I added a cranberry/ketchup glaze. Unfortunately the turkey wasn't cooked all the way in the middle. It really needed about 10 more minutes. It was very good though!

My husband is not eating beef right now and loves meatloaf.  I picked up a pkg of ground white turkey and ground regular turkey yesterday and was looking for something to do with this.  I did make just a couple of changes, only because white turkey meat can be so dry.  I added 1 cup sliced mushroom, which I had put thru mini-food processor so they would not be noticable to him, same with a half of onion.  I added pinches of poultry seasoning, rubbed sage and white pepper.  I cooked it and let cool just a bit.  I had to have a taste.  OMG!! Very moist and VERY GOOD!  Thank you for this recipe..will definitely be making this often.  He works out of town during the week, so this is something I can make and freeze so he can have some homecooked food during the week!

I added seasoning, onion, garlic, carrots, celery, and flax seed.  I still needed more flavor for this meatloaf.  It was tasty, no doubt, but didn't have that "thanksgiving" flavor.

This is the second time I have made this recipe.  I was in a hurry both times.  I added dried onions (seeped in hot water first).  The first time I made it my family told me that it was the best meatloaf I had ever made.  It is very easy to prepare and very forgiving if you don't have exactly the correct amount of stuffin mix.  I used Colonna, Poultry in the pan single step stuffing mix.  I spread Bulls Eye BBQ sauce on the top before I put it into the oven.  Great recipe and my family loves it.

Omg! This is a must try! I tried this on a whim, just trying to use up what I had in the fridge.  It's difficult to find a recipe that everyone in my family loves, but this was a hit!  I added some minced garlic , Italian seasoning, I used 2 eggs & 1 Ib of turkey, it was scrumptious! I also like that it's a quick prep, for busy families, like mine.

This was very tasty. I added some thyme and also made a cranberry glaze for the top with brown sugar and orange zest. Served with mashed potatoes and gravy. It was a big hit and will make this again.

My boyfriend liked this, but I took one bite and it was over for me. Gray is not a good color for food. This recipe helped me uncover my deep hatred of ground turkey.
