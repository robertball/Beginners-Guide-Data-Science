I make this by hand as I don't have a machine. 
I use whole milk equal to volume of water and powder. 
I mix dry ingredients in bowl except yeast, warm milk, molasses and butter to 100 degrees F, then add yeast and stir in. In about 10 minutes when frothy, I pour into dry ingredients and stir with big spoon until no lose powder is left. I let sit 10 minutes before kneading for 10 minutes adding flour as needed to keep from sticking.
Cover with damp towel for about 2 hours until doubled in size. I then punch down and knead another 2 minutes and place in loaf pan to rise for about 2 hours until way above the pan top. It looks cooked at this point. Bake for 35 minutes @ 350 F. I live off this fabulous staple. I have subbed in Fennel Seeds when Caraway were scarce.

one of the best bread machine recipes, I've come across in a long time. I've never used caraway seeds and so I was a bit cautious. I of course made this recipe in the middle of the night to occupy my time. And when I woke up, wah-la it was done and cooled. The loaf was super airy, sturdy yet soft and nearly store bakery quality. Using an electric bread knife to cut even slices, turned out just beautifully. I was rather impressed. I was worried about the flavorful but it was very nice as well. I will try this recipe with other seeds or herbs and without as well. Very good, very good...a wonderful keeper for sure!!!

Outstanding simple recipe.  Best I've found. I make the dough in a bread machine using the dough setting.  This does all the hard work.  Then I transfer it to a breadpan to rise for about 3-4 hrs depending on temperature.  When I like the size I then bake at 350 for 30 minutes.  Great for Reuben's!

Nice!  I have some milk to use up that's edging toward spoiled, so I left out the milk powder, added a bit more flour, and used 1 cup of the milk and 1/4 cup water.  Used the dough setting on the bread machine, then let it rise in a pan and baked at 350 for 40 minutes.  Turned out flavorful and soft, and pretty.  :)  I like the seeds in here, but I know some people don't like seeded bread--I am sure you could grind them if you don't like seeds in your teeth.  Thanks for the recipe!

I am so happy I finally tried this recipe. It is so good! I had forgotten how much I like the taste and smell of caraway seed. It brought back sweet memories of my dear Mom.  This bread is wonderful toasted and buttered.  BramtonMommyof2, I hope you'll forgive me for the one substitution I made with your wonderful recipe. I did not have any molasses as it is not a flavor I enjoy. I read on-line that a suitable sub is pancake syrup so I used that instead of the molasses. I used this bread to make patty melts from another recipe found on this site (sponsored by the Clorox company).  What a wonderful combination of flavors it was! Thanks for sharing your recipe!!

I just pulled this bread out of my bread machine.  I had to stop myself from slicing it one piece at a time and devouring it after slathering each piece with butter.  It is amazing.  I used one cup of scalded milk with 1/4 cup of water.  I did not have molasses, so I used 3 Tablespoons of brown sugar.  It is completely amazing.  I will make this bread many, many times I am sure.  Very flavorful and delicious!!!

Delicious and easy to make. I substituted EV olive oil for the butter and honey for the brown sugar. Love that this recipe used some whole wheat flour, as not all do (and no gluten which I was out of).

This is the first time I made this recipe. It was awesome I added for teaspoonfuls of vital wheat gluten to make the volume higher and I used olive oil instead of butter. It was fantastic my bread machine is a Cuisinart convection breadmaker and it worked really well on the 2 pound setting with a light crest setting on the whole wheat number three setting

My rye bread never turns out, it’s always 3” high and solid as a rock... but this was fabulous!  I did add 1/4 cup of gluten.  However.. I always add gluten to my bread machine recipes, they just aren’t light and fluffy if I don’t. I also used King Arthur Flour.  So excited I found a recipe that works!!!!

This is my go-to recipe for rye bread.  I do not bake it in the machine, but form into two loaves and bake in the oven at 350º.  Just had a BLT using slices of this bread and it was great.  I also love just a simple slice of cheese on it for a snack.

Slightly chewy and crusty on the outside. Moist and yummy on the inside.  I sprinkled poppy seed and sesame seed on top. SO GOOD!

I have made it in the bread maker machine, but I prefer to use the dough cycle and bake it in a traditional bread pan.  I have also used the dough cycle and made it as rolls, which were absolutely amazing! I add a bit more caraway seeds and sometimes add a couple of tablespoons of chia seeds.

An all time family favorite.  It is impossible to screw up this recipe.

I also substitute potato flour for the dry milk as I am lactose intolerant and it works seamlessly well! Exact match for quantity for the potato flour and dry milk.

I learner that I don't care to much for caraway seeds.

Looks nice though. Made by hand as per reviewers recommendation.

I reduced the caraway to 1 Tblsp. and the brown sugar and molasses to only 1 Tblsp. each. Very good! My German beloved loves it.

Made this today and extremely happy with the results.  I didn't have molasses but exchanged for malt extract.  Love the light fluffy texture and taste.  Caraway seeds offer a subtle flavour. This is a keeper.  Thank you so much for sharing!

11/2017: This bread was PERFECT - moist, amazing flavor, used 2 lb wheat bread setting on my bread machine, baked right in the maker.  I had  bunch of substitutions because some of the ingredients I didn't have on hand, but it seemed to work out great!: 
-used scalded milk instead of water + milk powder
-used bread flour instead of wheat flour
-added 2 tsp vital wheat gluten  to help texture w/ the rye flour 
-used 1.5 T brown sugar instead of molasses.
-went heavy on the caraway, but I love the flavor.

  Update 12/31/17
Made bread for new year's eve dinner - turned out amazing again!  I used the recommended flours and molasses this time - turned out even better. Moist and great texture.  Still added vital wheat gluten and subbed scalded milk for the water + dry milk, heavy on the caraway again.

My new go to bread machine recipe! 
Don't believe anyone who gives this less than a 5-star review. 
It's soft, fluffy, and has great light flavor from the rye and molasses.

A good rye bread, I am pleased with it - the mixture of flours works well.  I subbed splenda for the brown sugar and also added about 1 T ground flax seed.  I think next time I make it I will cut the splenda subbed for the brown sugar in half, maybe it is sweeter than brown sugar.  Using just the molasses was enough to help the yeast rise.

It was good, the combination of flours provides a great texture and moisture in the finished loaf. The toast is real good. Kinda crispy. It's dense. It's great with peanut butter.

I made this recipe, but I left out the brown sugar, used 1 1/2 cups water, because it didn't sound like enough liquid and used a 1/4 cup more whole wheat (and a 1/4 cup less bread flour).  I used the order of ingredients that my bread machine instructions recommended (all dry first, then wet).  I also used the whole wheat setting.  It came out very well.  I was happy because I made one from another website the night before and it didn't rise well and was misshapen.
