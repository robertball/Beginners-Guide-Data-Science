Only made one change, and that was to reduce the amount of sugar by half (actually, I used Truvia).  We don't like things really sweet these days, so my instinct told me just to cut it back initially (that's just our taste preference).  In my mind, this falls into the "comfort food" category, and it certainly was a splurge nutritionally, but it is tasty, sort of like a corn pudding.  It took much longer than 30 minutes to brown, so I'd bump up the temperature next time to 350.  Very easy to put together, and we enjoyed it.

Very, very good flavor.  I had to raise oven temp to 350 and cooked for 40 minutes.  Was perfect.  Great side dish for an cold weather dinner...especially thanksgiving.  I used only 1/2 a cup of sugar as recommended by another All Recipe user.

Added diced onion, bell pepper and grated sharp cheddar; also followed other reviewers' advice; cut sugar to 1 tbl spoon & upped cooking time to 40 min. @ 350 degrees.  Turned out firm, not loose & tasted great.   Suggest reducing cooking time if you prefer it loose.

I really wished i had paid attention to the other reviews. I followed the recipe exactly and it was just too sweet for my husband and I. Also it really needed to cook longer as some of the other reviewers have suggested.

Very sweet and yummy. I cut the sugar to half a cup and it's still very sweet. A family favorite.

This is a good recipe but I only put 1/8 cup of sugar as others have noted as well and it turned out great. This is not a dessert and corn is naturally sweet anyway. Also, would recommend using a 8.5" x 11 pan.

It was good however one cup of sugar is way to much, next time I  will cut it down to 1/2 cup.

Kids liked this recipe. A bit sweet for me personally but I liked that it's different than my usual side dishes.

Don’t laugh.  :-).  I didn’t have crackers, so used leftover stuffing cubes and Cheerios.  Lol.  Used 2 eggs, and 1/2 C sugar, and baked st 350 for 40 min.  It was actually pretty good except still too sweet.

I used frozen whole kernel corn and served this with Thanksgiving dinner. Not everyone tried it but those that did liked it. I think 1 sleeve of crackers and half the sugar would have been enough. I will make this again for next Thanksgiving.

Doubled the recipe, halved the sugar, baked longer (40 minutes) at 350. Excellent dish for Thanksgiving. Very quick and easy.

I used 1/3 cup of sugar and that was plenty! I also added 1/2 a red bell pepper (sweet pepper) sautéed down, and that was excellent!

This just didn't turn out well, slightly gelatinous and too sweet. I even cut the sugar by 1/2 and it was still too much. I like corn casserole but I won't use this recipe again.
