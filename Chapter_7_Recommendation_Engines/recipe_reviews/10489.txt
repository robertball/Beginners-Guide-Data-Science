I made mine with 1 1/2 cups flour and 1/2 cup corn meal but thought the original recipe was great. I liked the not-so-sweetness and the cake-like texture. These are great late-night cookies-- I made these at midnight and it was nice to just drop them on the pan instead of rolling out dough!

I followed the recipe EXACTLY and they were absolutely horrible. They had no flavor whatsoever. All I could taste was the baking soda. Horrible!

I followed this recipe exactly. I was a little nervous about the batter being so soft and gooey but they actually baked up beautifully. Almost like a snickerdoodle very cake-like. I wouldn't use this recipe again but it was a good alternative when all other recipes called for shortening.

We thought these cookies were really good. They are on the plain side not too sweet but perfect with coffee/tea. They baked up beautifully. You could add icing if wanted them sweeter but we actually prefer the plain cookie. Thanks for a great recipie! I'll definitely be making these again and again.

We followed the recipe exactly and it tastes like we just baked salt. We're gonna try to put more sugar in but I'll probably move to another recipe next time.

These are pretty good and very easy and quick to make. I imagine they'd be good with frosting for those who like a sweeter cookie. One thing though: I'm not sure why these are described as "delicate brown sugar cookies." Mine were neither brown nor delicate--rather they were puffy drop sugar cookies of the usual kind. Perhaps I was supposed to make them smaller and flatten them more?
