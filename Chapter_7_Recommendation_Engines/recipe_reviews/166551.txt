I'm still reeling from how absolutely delicious this dish was! We prepared it just as written, and it was fantastic - I was leary of the anchovies but they deepened the flavor without overpowering the scallops at all. The one issue we had with the recipe is that if prepared as written, the scallops are not necessarily seared on both sides because the water from the peppers prevents the browning of the second side. Next time we might try searing both sides before adding the peppers, maybe even removing the scallops once cooked and then adding the pepper mixture, then mixing it all together at the end.

This was excellent. I didn't have anchovy oil so I added some bacon instead.  I served it with angel hair pasta which I seasoned with butter and garlic salt. I will definitely make this again!

Restaurant quality!  I followed the advice of a few others and sauteed my vegetables in olive oil first and then removed them from the pan.  Then I added the anchovies in the oil and cooked them down, then cooked the scallops so they could brown.  Then I added the cooked vegetables (so the scallops didn't overcook).  I served them with Rachel Ray's recipe for Lemon Spaghetti and it was amazing!!

I made this for Father's Day and we loved it.  I did not have the anchovy or the yellow/orange pepper, but it still turned out great.  I also increased the cooking time since the scallops I had were just huge.  I served it with sauted spinach and rice pilaf.

Great! I made this exactly as written. The anchovy oil and citrus work beautifully with the scallops and veggies. As another reviewer mentioned, you may want to sear your scallops on both sides before adding the vegetables. Mine turned out nicely browned on one side, and sauteed on the other - which was fine. I tossed them with little linguine and chopped parsley. Nice. Thanks for the recipe!

Decreased the olive oil and cooked the veggies first.  I love anchovies and I could definitely taste the anchovies in this recipe.  I will make this again but you really need to cook the veggies first and decrease the oil.

We loved this dish. I also cooked the vegies first. It is very important not to over cook the scallops. They only need to be seared 3 to 4 minutes. Lovely flavors in he recipe. Thanks so much for sharing.

This has become one of my fiancee's fav dishes.  Don't oversalt the scallops, and consider serving with a flavorful wild rice.

The flavor combinations are very good.  I used 1 tbsp of fresh lemon juice rather than zest.  I think one of two variations on this work best: 1. cook the pepper mixture separately and bring the mixture together with the scallops near the end of cooking or 2. cook everything according to the recipe, but add some of your favorite wine and reduce.

I poured the can of Anchovy fillets in oil to a large cast iron pan, mashed with fork and omitted the extra oil.  This is quick, tasty and looks great on the plate. I will make this again.

Really tasty!  My kids never even knew there were anchovies in there.  I agree that the peppers & onions should be cooked first & set aside, the scallops cooked next, then recombined.  I served over thin wheat spaghetti.

Overall it was tasty here are the things I would change:

1. Decrease the olive oil; I too found it a bit on the oily side
2. Use a bit of fresh thyme
3. I would cook the pepper medley and scallop separately, and then mix towards the end. (Cooking it together made it a bit on the watery side).

-Prepare half of the anchovy oil. Saute the peppers, onions, garlic, and   fresh thyme
-Then remove and set aside. 
-Then prepare the remaining half of the anchovy oil with the scallops.
-Add zest to the scallops.
 
-Then once the scallops are brown add the pepper medley with the scallop

Delicious! My husband and I love anchovy and this recipe is awesome. Although we cut the ingredients by half since we were making for two we used the whole can of anchovy. It was perfect for us. Love this recipe and will definitely make it again and again. Thanks for sharing.

I followed the reviewer’s recommendations and reduced the oil to ¼ cup, but I also drained the Anchovies (fillet in olive oil and salt) into the skillet. So I ended up with a bit more than ¼ cup and a bit less than 1/3 cup. I browned the Scallops on both sides then removed them to a bowl and then put in the veggies. I was hesitant about the onions and the peppers going in at the same time since onions usually take longer to cook, but the oil really evened it out. We had lemon wedges in a servers bowl for those who liked it more lemony. Great recipe!

This was a very unique recipe, that turned out great! I also put over angel hair with Olive Oil. Next time I would add a little heat or spice.  Maybe a little red pepper.

Needs refining - less olive oil, sear scallops on both sides, and cook veg separately. Otherwise excellent.  BUT - what is 'minced lime zest' and 'minced lemon zest'? Zest is grated lemon/lime rind, so how do you 'mince' it?

Wonderful marriage of flavor - I used a cast iron skillet so the scallops seared perfectly.  I did remove  scallops from the veggies after four minutes...amazing blend off flavors to tantilize the taste buds.  Succculent success!

Delicious! used bacon instead of anchovies as none on hand. Also used lemon juice and lime juice instead of zest. This is a very nice dish; will try with anchovies next time & searing veggies separately from scallops.

Awesome...anchovy really brings this together. I made this a while ago and my wife and I loved it.  She made it for me several weeks later, tho her version was a little salty. I don't think she realized the anchovies were as salty as they were. Bottom line: Salt control is important, but still super tasty!

A nice scallop recipe, and a change from the usual baked/sautéed way I usually prepare them. I will keep this recipe in rotation. I served over angel hair pasta.

Girlfriend like it a lot more than I did. She is the seafood expert in the household. Making it was very simple. Me personally, I used smaller scallops and end result was the same. Kudos to throwing Thyme in the dish!

Wonderful dish!  I didn't use anchovies, and I thought the lemon juice and rind would overpower the dish - but my husband who isn't a fan of lemons didn't even realize it was in the recipe. I used mushrooms instead of green peppers (I think you can substitute any vegetable for the peppers and it will still come out delicious).

The taste was good but so greasy. If I make this again it will be without 1/3 cup of oil and no anchovies, which add to the oil.  I like anchovies but not in this recipe.
