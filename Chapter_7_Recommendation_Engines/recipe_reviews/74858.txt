These were terrific, nice and juicy!  I bought them frozen and when they thawed I just cut them in half myself with a big chef's knife, no problem. I basted them with the marinade they were cooking in,about every 15 minutes while they were baking. I will definitely make these again!

I tasted the marinade before putting it on my hens. Too much soy! So this is what I did! Let me back up first. I bought Apricot preserves just to make this dish but when it came time to make it I couldn't find it. So I went to our local store and all they had was peach and pineapple. So I bought both! Glad I did because I used all of both. I mixed them and put a cup and a half in the marinade. Adding about a 2x2 grated piece of ginger. Then after they were put in the oven I took the rest of the perserves and put it in a pot on low heat I added about 1/2 a tsp. of ginger about a 1/2 tsp. of cheyenne pepper and about the same of sesame oil. WOW!!! Taste it first and then tweek it! When the birds were all but 20 minutes done then I spooned the mixture over them and finished the cooking. Don't baste anymore after putting it on. My family and my company really loved it! Almost forgot... I doubled this recipe so that is why there is so much preserves in it! I made with this a gourmet mushroom risotto found on allrecipes.

This recipe was pretty tasty. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of game hens, and my husband loved it. Next time, I think I will bread the chicken after it has been soaked in the sauce, though, for a more intense flavor. I also served this over jasmine rice mixed with apricot preserves and minced ginger. This recipe is a keeper. ; )

i used twice the amount of apricot reserve  (jam actually) just a little less soy sauce, and dried ginger spice ( 10 mls). I didn't have the white wine, but this still came out tasting awesome and was extremely easy!

I was skeptical of this recipe at first, but I served it as the main course for Christmas dinner and it was a hit.  The only thing I would to differently the next time I make this is use a rack to raise the meat out of the marinade while cooking.  The very top was nicely browned, but the portions left in the juice had no color.

This was so easy and really delicious. My family loved them. Could easily use pork or chicken. I will certainly make this again.

These are delicious and without the jam you would not have that great sticky glaze.  Perhaps those who did not care for the recipe did not use fresh ginger.  It is a huge crowd pleaser.

I picked this recipe out for my husband to make for a dinner party.  It came out wonderfully - and we only marinated them for 6 hours instead of overnight.  Next time we make it we'll marinate for longer.  I've already emailed this recipe to friends.

These were wonderful.  Moist and juicy.  I used my kitchen shears to cut them in half and it was relatively easy.  Both the adults and children loved them.

As other reviewers have posted, it tasted only of soy sauce.  The flavor of apricot and ginger (even tho I doubled the ginger) was lost.  I was hoping for much better.

This was okay.  Not a lot of ginger or apricot flavor, which was disappointing.  I marinated it overnight, and basted it conscientiously, but still it was a bit dry.

Fantastic! I was looking for a recipe for holiday dinner, saw this and decided to give it a trial run. I used all ingredients as listed but did up the amount of fresh ginger since it's one of my favorites. I prepped early in the morning so the hen had a good time to marinate. I used a glass oblong baking dish and added all of the marinade at once. I basted every 15 minutes, turning the dish each time. I will change this because it stayed too thin. I want more of a glaze so adding less marinade next time will allow it to thicken more (but still have extra if it gets too thick). The hen was fall off the bone tender after 1-1/4 hours, juicy and delectable.

The only change I made on this recipe was I doubled the amount of preserves; then I doubled the recipe.  I used four hens cut in half for eight servings. They were amazing! Not only was the taste great, but they came out of the oven picture perfect. They were moist, and had a great color. I made this at Christmas because everyone is tired of turkey and ham from Thanksgiving. Everyone loved them. This will become a holiday staple.

I made it, only substituting light soy sauce for less sodium, and it was very good.  We had them along with a small pineapple glazed ham for our Thanksgiving meal.  Both complimented each other well!  Frequently the beginning stages of marinades or glazes don't taste the same as they do after cooking in an oven for an hour or so.  Don't get too hasty about changing them.

Delicous. Circumstances prevailing, my  hens came butcher marinated in fresh lemon, olive oil, and garlic. I made sauce with home available items,  ginger syrup with grated ginger, apricot preserves, champagne
Vinegar, soy, no wine used orange liquor.  Did not care for the soy so added more ingredient
To cover.  Cooked jasmine rice in same sauce pan as residual marinade was made in.  Great. Can,t wait to try a fruit stuffed pork roast. Thank you.

This smells wonderful the changes I made is this I added Rosemary just a bit pat of butter. Instead of wine I used apricot nectar juice and instead of white sugar I used brown sugar everything else the same. I will report how this comes out tonight but really excited!
