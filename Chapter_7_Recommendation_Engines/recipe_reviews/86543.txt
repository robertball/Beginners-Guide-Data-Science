I modified this quite a bit as I am Portuguese born and raised in New Bedford, MA.   I chopped 2 med. onions and minced 5 garlic cloves. I put those two ingredients in a large stock pot over 3T heated Olive Oil for about 7 minutes, stirring occasionally.   I cubed 5 large Idaho potatoes, de-skinned and washed, I let them sit to dry out for a minute while I prepared 8 cups of buillion beef broth in a 2 quart saucepan.   I added sliced Portuguese Gaspars Chourico sliced ab. 1 inch each, then chopped in quarters.  Mixed that over the onion/garlic mixture for about 10minutes. Then, to this onion/garlic/oil/chourico mixture I added 1 can Red Kidney Beans, 1 can no salt diced tomatoes, 1/2t koarse salt, 1/2t black pepper.   I then added the boiled over buillion mixture with 2 cups of chicken broth to onion/chourico mixture in the stock pot. I added 2 Bay leaves and brought this to a boil about 25minutes. I then added 2 T vinegar, 8ounces macaroni, the chopped potatoes and cooked additional 20 minutes and added more stock/ beef buillion boiled in water if needed.   I then added washed 3 bunches of Kale and 1/2 head of cabbage thats been ripped in large bite sized pieces  (do not use hard stalks) into the veggie/chourico mixture.   I let it simmer and it was ready in about 20 minutes.   This is absolutely delicious! My husband who hates veggies ate all of them, including the kale, cabbage and diced tomatoes!!  This is a winner and so easy to make.

When I made this, my wife called it "resturant quality".I added spinach, and used red and white beans for some color.A dash(or more!) of cayenne puts a little zest in it.We found we like it better if the greens are left with a little firmness, and not over-cooked. So good, and so good for you. This recipe is fantastic.

Thank You, Scotty! It's easy to tell that you are a real New Bedford guy. This was wonderful. I've been trying to find this recipe ever since my favorite restaurant on the Cape closed. "Kadee's" in Orleans had a kale soup on the menu that was so similar to your recipe. I find that it is even better if it has time to be refrigerated overnight and reheated. All I can say though is, "Wicked Good"!!!

This was really great! I don't have a Portuguese market near me, so I modified the recipe. I also added a few things for taste and nutritional value. Instead of the chourica, I used hot italian sausage. Also, instead of adding the 2 pork chops, I added beef boullion to the water in the soup to add some meaty flavor. I also added a can of condensed split pea soup with ham, which added great texture, flavor and nutritional value. Instead of the Pimenta Moida peppers, I added plenty of cayenne pepper, and also a spoonful of hot chili paste. I also added 1 can of diced tomatoes. I included all of the other ingredients (onion, garlic, beans, potatoes, kale, cabbage) as written. This was a delicious, healthy, spicy, satisfying meal. I served with a loaf of french bread.

I have been making this soup for years. It is very good. But if you want extra flavor go to the local grocery store and find Lipton cup of green pea soup (it is a dry package soup) This makes the base of the soup rich and creamy.

This is just like my mom's Kale Soup. The only thing I changed was using Lima Beans instead of garbanzo beans. It was the way I remembered from growing up in Fairhaven. Thanks!

Tahhhhhhh bon! I'm not Portuguese, actually French-Canadian... but i grew up in New Bedford, and always got Kale Soup from my friends market the Salchicaria. Since I'm in Vegas now and a long way from home, I couldn't get good Portuguese Kale Soup out here.... my parents had sent me some Gaspar's Linguica... and found your recipe. I was able to get all my other ingredients out here... Just like home man... thanks so much!

Sensacional! There must be some old-world mysticism at work here. The whole is far greater than the sum of all the parts. Fifteen minutes into cooking, my kitchen smelled of magic and wonder. The anticipation only made the actual ingestion that much sweeter. Well done Scotty and thank you. I owe your family members a few bottles of Vinho Verde! Obrigado!

I cut this recipe in half and wished i hadn't! So yummy. GREAT winter soup and easy to make. I left out the cabbage (forgot to buy it) and it was just as good. Used Portugese linguisa smoked linguisa instead of chourico.

really good!  I did a few changes to the recipe, but it still came out really well. I didn't add any beans and I left out the hot peppers and pork chops. I used beef broth to add more flavor. Other than that I made this the way the recipe is.

Very tasty, but I modified it a little.  I used one can red kidney beans and one can cannelini (white kidney beans).  I also had thick boneless pork chops in the freezer that I needed to use, so I cut two of them into small chunks and used them instead of bone-in chops.  Finally, I replaced the Pimenta Moida with two whole jalapenos that I cut long slits in to release their heat.  When left whole, they're easier to remove after they've done their job.

Best Broth EVER. OK, I just used crumbled pork sausage and had no peppers, and I was amazed at the directions add two pork chops, but wow was this good.

I followed some of the suggestions on previous reviews, i.e. beef broth instead of water, added a can of diced tomatoes, switched out the hot Portuguese peppers with a jalapeno and used white kidney (cannellini) beans.  I used linguica sausage, left out the pork chop and added a chopped carrot since I didn't have any cabbage.  It was so good, I had two small bowls for dinner - the leftovers will make an awesome lunch tomorrow!

Once I discovered that using stock or broth in place of water,my stews-soups became sooooo much better,no matter what kind it was.I also make alot of my own stock/broth and freeze it & keep 2 store-bought containers of chicken/beef in the cupboard all the time.I am now making the Kale soup-its in the crockpot. We dont care for the beans or peppers-but everything else is the same.I have a Crusty French Boule for bread,and I'll make a salad if anybody wants some,but they'll probaly fill up on soup.Since the Kale that was purchased was a huge amount-I set aside some for the soup and blanched the rest for the freezer for winter soups. Thats some good vitamin broth there. Within an hour we should be smelling that yummy smell! We lov Linquica,but eat it sparingly,and thats what I use when making Kale soup. I give this a high 5*!

Very flavorful.  I used the hot linguica, so it did not need any additional heat.  I made it as written, except that I used green cabbage that I had on hand instead of savoy.  The soup is also pretty with the kale and kidney beans.  It was so quick and easy to put together, I see this becoming a regular menu item.

My husband bought a big gallon bottle of "kale blazer" juice and then discovered he didn't like it, so I was trying to find a way to use it. I made this recipe in my slow cooker and added the kale juice instead of water. It turned out so very good! We were joking that we'd never buy that kale juice again, except now we've found a really good use for it!

I'm gonna rename this poop soup cause it gave me nasty poopins. I couldn't find the ingredients to some of the stuff, pepper sauce and cabbage. But it was still great tasting but beware.... It might clean you out. Not great when you have to work the next day.

OK I did substitute - jalapenos for the portugese peppers and a spicy texas sausage for the portugese sausage, extra kale instead of savoy cabbage.  that said (and I don't think those changes are major) this was SO GOOD!  I would have thought it needed spices (oregano, cumin, something) but it does NOT.  somehow the flavors together are just perfect.  whoops - I did not use a pork chop either.  I imagine with the stuff I left out, it would be even better!!!!  thanks for a great recipe that we will use again and again!

I opened up the fridge and found some leftover beans, potatoes, and limp arugala. Used this recipe as a clearing out leftovers. I made the soup with a ham base and skipped the meat (we don't like a lot of meat in soups) 
and garbanzos. Otherwise it was made per the recipe. My husband loved it.

Had to cut this recipe in half and it still made enough to feed us a few times (3 people).  I used beef stock as a base that's what I had on hand, kept one whole onion and 1 can of Garbanzo beans (no waste) and 1/2 all other ingredients.  Added a can of unsalted diced tomato and a small yellow squash (to use it up).  Used chourice.  My husband loved it.  WHooohooo!

I just made this soup and it tastes fantastic. The only thing I did different was I used all beef broth instead of water and I used Al Fresco's Chirizo and Al Fresco's Sweet Italian Sausage instead of pork. I also added a can of diced tomatoes and I did not add the hot peppers. This healthy soup will be my dinner tonight and lunch all week.

I enjoyed this recipe but I did merge this one and another that was on Allrecipes.  The negatives come from one suggesting the Portuguese crushed pepper (messa pimenta?) 3 tablespoons! I put  only 2 thinking 3 would be too much. Well 2 was too much. I would suggest using only 1 or none. I don't mind spicy to a point but the heat took over the taste. I also had no idea on prepping the kale. I used fresh. I was told you should use frozen (even by old school women) and when using fresh you need to  chop it very very small.  I chopped it but not small at all thinking it would render down. The kale was still crunchy and a bit tough.  (and yes, I had taken out the middle vein)

Super Soup! I did use butter beans since thats what was on hand,and used bean with bacon soup for the other bean! It as a great choice and substituted the chourico with Kielbasa.Added hot pepper flakes since we like it spicy hot.
