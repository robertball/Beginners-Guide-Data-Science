I am the recipe submitter...If you do not like super-spicy food, do NOT use the seeds from the chipotle, and cut the adobo sauce down to 1 tsp or less. You can aslo add tomato to boost the nutrutional value (or the taste). Enjoy:)

All I can say is YUM! This is not your average turkey wrap...it's definitely spicy, but has a great smoky flavor from the turkey that perfectly compliments the creamy avocado and crisp veggies! I used Hellman's light mayo, flour tortillas and added some tomato slices.  Oh, and to take this over the top I added some bacon - everything is better with bacon, right? These were absolutely delicious. Just perfect with a side of kettle cooked chips, a dill pickle and a tall glass of iced tea! Thanks for a great recipe, messy_jessie!

These were good but not as spicy as I thought they were going to be.  They keep pretty well in the refrigerator (I made a bunch, wrapped in foil and served in mine and my husband's lunches for the week) except for the lettuce part.  Next time I will omit the lettuce and maybe add more chipotle peppers for spice!

Yummy!  Loved the sauce.  Had to use iceberg lettuce instead of the romaine.  Thanks!

These were good, and I think an interesting take on boring sandwiches for lunch daily.  Next time I will make sure the chipotle peppers are minced finely so that I don't get too much in one bite.

Made these for a light summer dinner last night and the kids and I really liked them. Hubby said it was okay which was a surprise because he loves chipotle. My picky eater son asked that it be put into the rotation!

I used prepared chipotle mayonnaise because I had it.  The wrap was yummy and made for an interesting change. This is one I will have to keep in the file for lunch with friends. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made a bunch of these for the family to bring in their lunches for the next day.  I used peppered turkey and blended the mayo with sauce from a can of peppers in adobo sauce (I did not use the peppers themselves). They were spicy... but very tasty.  I also used a shredded Monterey-Cheddar blend.  They stayed fresh even on day 2.  A great alternative to a tureky sandwhich.

Makes it a NOT boring turkey wrap. Just mild spicy. I use butter lettuce because itâ€™s easier to roll. Use guacamole instead of avacado  for the same reason. Smoother to roll up.  Make ahead for a great lunch with a salad or two.

I loved this because it took no time at all to whip this up. It's great for lunch or for dinner in a hurry. 

I bought a can of the peppers in the adobo sauce, and that worked pretty well. It had a good kick of flavor, but it wasn't overpowering.
