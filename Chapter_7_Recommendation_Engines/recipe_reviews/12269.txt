Useful, but better with less sugar (1/3 -1/2 cup is enough) and a few more raisins.  Doesn't need any salt, but a tablespoon or two of brandy makes it more interesting.

Nice pie; my family enjoyed it and it was easy to make.  I made two changes to the recipe.  I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup and I am glad that I did.  I increased the raisins to 1 1/2 cup and may even take it up to two cups next time.  Also, next time, I will add a splash of lemon juice or vanilla.  Will definitely make again.  I liked it better than those raisin pies that are just raisins, sugar, and corn starch.
