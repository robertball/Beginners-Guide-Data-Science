I bought the Plum Sauce already made in a jar - which saved lots of time.  The only thing I would change would be to use more of the coleslaw mix.

This is a very tasty meal!  Next time I will only use 1/4 cup (or less) hoisin sauce because it really over powered all other flavors.  I think that when you get this in a restaurant they don't use hoisin sauce in the dish, but rather add it to the plum sauce for a little spice.  Perhaps I'll try that...

Tasted like egg rolls, but was healthier. The plum sauce was lovely.

Delicious! I used a little beer as a substitute for the wine as that is all I had in the house. We really enjoyed it, especially the plum sauce.

We used thinly sliced pork instead of chicken,  was very good.  Would probably use less fresh ginger the next time, but otherwise this dish was a big hit!!!!

This recipe was fabulous!  I made crepes instead of tortillas which was a big hit.  I definitely recommend using crepes instead of tortillas and coleslaw mix instead of savoy cabbage and carrots.  This recipe took a little while to prepare, but was definitely worth it!

I replaced the meat in this dish with tofu for my vegetarian daughter, and she loved it!
