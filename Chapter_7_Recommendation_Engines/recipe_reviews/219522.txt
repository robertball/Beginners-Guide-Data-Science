A simple and delicious recipe! I added quite a bit in terms of spices - more oregano, basil, parsley, S&P during cooking. I made it for a family christmas for about 20 people and expanded the recipe quite a bit and cut up the zucchini into personal portions. I cut up the zucchinis into halves or thirds depending on the size and then filled them before baking in the same way. I found that the half cup of sauce added onto the shells at the end was not that helpful. It did keep some extra moisture while it baked, but it wasn't enough to really coat or even touch most of the pieces. I would probably add some cooked spinach or lots of extra parsley next time for colour. Even using green spinach, it isn't a very colourful dish. Everyone raved about them and it was a hit at the christmas party! Certainly a repeat dish. It can all be cooked in one pot (other than the rice) so it keeps dishes down. Success!
