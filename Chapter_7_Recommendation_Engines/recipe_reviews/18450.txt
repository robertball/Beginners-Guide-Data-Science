I made the Insanely Easy Vegetarian Chili instead of this one and it was a big mistake.  That one was bland.  This recipe is so good and easy.  The 1/3 cup chili pepper is too hot for me, but I still eat it.  I cry into my bowl, and still can't put it down.  Chili heat and preference vary by brand and person, so vary it to suit you.  The way the flavors blend is perfect.

This was very good.  I had to change some things according to my tastes or what I had on hand.  I used a can of black beans and a can of white kidney beans instead of garbanzo.  I omitted the zucchini and added 2/3 cup frozen white corn.  I used 2 14 oz. cans of petite diced tomatoes.  I don't think I even had 1/3 cup chili powder in the house; I only used 2-3 tablespoons.  I added about a cup of chicken broth because the mixture seemed a little dry and I needed to use it.  Omitted salt.  Served with light sour cream and sharp cheddar.  I really enjoyed it!

Terrific!  I like spicy food and this chili had the perfect amount of kick.  I added corn and used both kidney beans and chick peas (garbanzos).  I ended up putting my slow-cooker on high most of the time, maybe b/c I'm impatient, but ended up cooking for 7 hrs.

Great recipe!I've made vegetable chili before, but it was never this colorful, with such a great variety of veggies. I prepared the cut vegetables the day before. My slow cooker was being used for something else that day, so a few hours before dinner,I threw the veggies, and beans into a pot on the stove, brought to a boil, and let simmer until dinner. I doubled the recipe for my family of 6 plus we had leftovers. I  added  3 cans of light and dark kidney beans. I did not drain the beans, the chili really needed all that liquid to come to a simmer.I pulsed the whole tomatoes in the blender a couple times, and added another can of diced tomatoes.I doubled everything except the chili powder.I used 1 Tbsp. and it was still a bit spicy but not too spicy for the kids.It was sooo good! We topped it with shredded cheese and served this with cornbread.I will definitely make this again, next time in the slow cooker!

This was good but had a little too much chili powder.  My husband and I enjoyed it mixed with white rice.  Very tasty when served over rice.  The longer you cook it the better it taste.

Original recipe is pretty good. I used crushed tomatoes for a thicker more chili like consistency.  And corn instead of zuccini, personal choice.

It was a hit, and the people I served it too usually prefer meat dishes.  I did make one change though, I swapped out the zucchini and added 1 can of kidney beans, and I added 1 can of corn (not creamed), and it was great.

This is a very quick recipe that is both filling and has a wonderful flavor.  The variety of vegetables combine to make a savory chili (non-vegetarians won't even miss the meat, I bet).  The simplicity of throwing everything in the crockpot is something to LOVE!  And it's so nutritious.  Your body will thank you!

A very tasty recipe. A lot of vegetarian chili's lack in taste, but this recipe comes the closest to capturing the true chili taste.

This Chili was such a hit at my work, they asked me to make it again! I just added diced potato, squash, and ground beef to it to make it more hearty.

Wow! It's hard to miss the meat in this chili! Even my husband, who feels a meal is not complete without meat, declared this chili "delicious!". I had tons of veggies on hand from my CSA, so I added a few extras such as yellow squash, eggplant, and mushrooms...I only omitted the celery since I didn't have any on hand. Then I added extra tomatoes & spices to make up for the additional amount of veggies and I substituted kidney beans for the garbanzo beans. The seasoning is great and the spice is just perfect. Thanks for sharing this fabulous vegetarian dish...perfect for all those summer garden veggies!

Wonderful! I love crockpot recipes that are forgiving like this one, you can pretty much throw in whatever you have on hand. I sauteed the onions first in olive oil with some garlic (because they get weird if I don't) and added 2 big diced zucchinis to the pan for a few minutes before throwing it all in the crockpot. I threw 3 cans of beans in (2 drained, one undrained)(kidney, black and pinto), nixing the garbanzo beans. I only used 3 TBLspoons of chili powder, but doubled the oregano and cumin because I love those two together!! It came out amazing, so delicious. This is my go to chili recipe from now on.

I don't know how this recipe has 4 stars.  This is the first slow cooker recipe that I didn't like.  I thought they were all good.  I was looking for a nice healthy crock recipe so the veggies was nice.  The spice combo for flavoring was awful in my opinion.  Think about it-- its basically straight chili powder covered over vegetables.  Now I don't know what kind of chili powder you use, but I know that it doesn't do much as a stand alone spice.  Secondly, it's way too much.  I love spicy food, but this was overpowering with no dynamics.  I took almost two cups of the broth out and replaced with some water.  This recipe is in need of some major tweaking.

This was pretty good.  It did lack a little in the taste department.  I was expecting a more flavorful chili but it tasted like chili powder and water.  We ended up loving it once we served it over a baked potato and then topped with shredded cheese.

This was excellent!  I must admit though -- I added some spicy sausage links.  Also added fresh corn off the cob. I sliced the zucchini thick, so they'd hold up to a whole day of simmering without getting soggy and falling apart.  I used a can of diced tomatoes, and a can of stewed tomatoes. For the beans, I used two cans of mixed beans.

Excellent dish, even my father who prefers all meat-no bean chilies liked this.  I followed some of the suggestions and used only 4 tsps of chili powder, about 2 cups of chicken broth, and a  fresh poblano pepper in place of the can of peppers, since I had it on hand.  I also used a green and yellow summer squash instead of the zucchini.  I served over some rice and sprinkled a little cheddar cheese on top.  This makes is a tasty, filling, and healthy meal.

Where is the liquid?  I was sure the vegetables were going to burn in my slow cooker, so I added 2 cups of vegetable broth.  I advise anyone to add a minimum of one.  I also used two cans of diced tomatoes to make them spoon sized.  Very healthy and tasty!

Very yummy and super colourful! I followed it exactly and served it with sour cream and shredded cheese. It was even better the next day. I think I'd add some corn next time. Thanks!

I used fresh tomatoes from the garden in this and added a little more spice. Loved the color and firmness of the vegetables.  Served it in a tortilla bowl. Garnished with avocado and fresh tomatoes and my husband was coming back for thirds.

Delicious!!  I had never eaten Chili before, I detest Kidney beans and the idea of using another type of bean never dawned on me.  But this was fantastic!  I had no fresh veggys on hand, so I used 3 cups of frozen mixed vegetables as a substitute (the package I used had red, yellow and green peppers, onions, zuchini, eggplant, and mushrooms).  This recipe took me about 7 minutes to make, and that includes running back and forth to the computer to check the measurements.  This will  become a regular meal in my home!  Super fast, super easy, and delicious!

Oh yeah!  Good stuff!  I dare you to miss the meat!  As a bonus, a friend with gestational diabetes was able to eat 2 bowls and still have dessert!

YUM!  Made this today and it was wonderful.  I didn't have everything on hand however.   My changes - I substituted with a can of fire roasted diced tomatos, yellow bell pepper, and red onion.  I also only used 2 tbs of chile powder.  My husband raved about it and had two huge portions.  I think I will throw in some meat next time.  This would be great with chicken or ground buffalo.

Absolutely yummy. Didn't have the stewed tomatoes so I used 2 fresh roma, small can of tomato sauce, 1/2 c water with 2 veggie broth cubes, and black beans instead of garbanzo. Great vegan recipe! Will make again!

This is my favorite veggie chili recipe.  I serve it a lot for parties and even the people who arent vegetarian love it.  I serve it with sour cream and cheese on top and sometimes I serve it over rice.

I stick to as rigorous a food plan as possible, with portioned protein and whole carbohydrates so this looked like just the ticket -- and it was!  
I added extra zucchini, tomatoes, beans and carrots but stuck to the seasoning, which is intense.  It will have lasted a single person four nights and so, so good on the first really chilly nights in November, with either chicken or peanuts added for the protein I need.

This was very good with a rich and hearty flavor and texture.  I cooked it on high for 4 hours and the veggies were still a bit too crunchy at that point.  I ended up cooking it on high for 6 hours.

This is by far the very best veggie chili I have ever made.  SO good!  We make a double batch every time and eat it all week!  We do use kidney and whole pinto beans instead of the garbanzos but that's just my wife's preference.  Thanks for the recipe...amazing!

I substituted one can of white kidney beans for the garbanzos. I used about 1 tablespoon of chili powder and added two cans of V8 juice. I used extra liquid in the recipe because I was gone for 12 hours. Finally, I added 8 ounces of chopped mushrooms. I sauteed the mushrooms and onions before placing them in the slow cooker. This is a very good recipe.

I made this for a Superbowl party and it was a huge hit. My co-worker said it tasted like Stagg Veggie chili- but better! I love this recipe, but I added red onions and a small can of green chiles. Also freezes well.

This chili has just the right amount of heat for me, and I thought the spices melded beautifully. While I generally like garbanzos--chick peas--I think black beans, with their smoky flavor, might taste better in this recipe; I'll substitute them next time.

More like a soup than a chili.  It was way too spicy for my New England taste buds and I used less than the recommended 1/3 cup chili powder.  My guests barely touched theirs.

I made this last night for the first time.  It is so easy to make.  My young daughters and husband loved it.  I was short on time and could only cook it for 3 hours.  Next time I will try longer and see what happens.  I read a few of the reviews and added corn and crushed tomatoes.  I added an extra 15 oz of tomatoes.  I added heaping spices with the exception of the chili power.  I listened to other posts who said it was too much.  I forgot to buy honey, so instead used 1 1/2-2 tbs of molasses.

I love this recipe! I tweak it a little each time I make it so that I can use up whatever is in my cupboards. I usually put in a can of tomato sauce as well so that it adds a bit of thickness. Yummy!

This is a great vegetarian chili!  My husband, who told me that you can't make chile without meat, even went back for seconds!  I changed a couple of things after making it the first time, but even without the changes it was still great.  I used 2 tablespoons of chili powder instead of 1/3 of a cup, which seemed like a lot.  I also just squeeze the juice of the canned tomatoes out and then trow the tomatoes out.  I put in 2 diced up fresh tomatoes instead.  (I'm not a huge fan of canned tomatoes.)  I put in a can of black beans, a can of kidney beans, and a can of garbanzo beans, all drained.  I add a little extra of each seasoning, just for a little bit of a stronger taste.  I added half a package of frozen corn also.  While slicing the zucchini and carrots, after they are all sliced I usually cut them into halfs and thirds. I also put in half of a jar of banana peppers instead of the can of chopped chile peppers.  I think it adds better flavor.  This is a great recipe and everyone who eats it always goes back for seconds!

Not at all a personal fave.  The chili cooked up rather thin, and the large amount of chili powder was overwhelming, not allowing for much complexity of flavor.

Loved this recipe and you can't go wrong!!  Very easy to adapt to your personal taste and available ingrediants, which is what I did.  I used 1 summer squash in place of a zucchini, added 1 can of kidney and 1 can of black beans, a 6 oz. can of italian tomato paste to thicken it up some and an extra can of diced tomatoes which I think it DIDN'T need afterall!  Delicious!!  I will definitly keep this recipe to make often!

I changed it a little bit.  It is delicious!!! 

2-15 oz. cans black beans
1-1 oz. can garbanzo beans
2-15 oz. cans diced tomatoes
1 small can tomato paste
1 small can green chilies
1 zucchini, chopped
1 yellow squash, chopped
1 sweet onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, chopped
3 red bell peppers, chopped
1 heaping T cumin seeds
1 heaping T chili powder
1 heaping t mustard powder (I would have rather used tons of mustard seeds , like 2 heaping Ts but I didn't have any, I like their texture in chili, but now that I have used the powder, I might just stick with that)
salt and pepper

Mix together in a crockpot.  Mix occasionally.  I left it on low for about 10 hours and it is phenomenal!

I was looking for a vegetable-laden beef chili, so I browned a pound of ground beef with the onion and salt, then added it to the rest of the ingredients. My kids don't like spicy food, so I only added 1T of chili powder, and used cannelini beans instead of garbanzos, but I used the rest of the ingredients as written. This was delicious! Everyone loved it, it was not spicy, but it was very flavorful. Plus it made enough for 4 dinner portions with enough to send it in their lunches the next day. We have a lot of food allergies here, and this chili fits the gluten-free, dairy-free, nut-free bill and is delicious to boot. Thanks!

This chili was freakin amazing!    I just got an old crockpot from my mother-in-law and had to try it out.  Boy, this was the perfect thing to try out my new (old) crockpot with.  I really liked the idea of a veggie chili but my husband insisted I put meat in it as well.  So I added a 1/2 pound of lean ground beef and also substituted red kidney beans instead of garbanzo.  The best chili I've ever had!  The veggies added so much flavor and really gave it that home-cooked taste.  The slow cooker also had a lot to do with that.  Three adults (including me) gobbled the whole thing up in one sitting and trust me, we were SO FULL!!  My baby even liked it.  I also served it with saltine crackers, cheddar cheese, and sour cream.  TO DIE FOR!!   I must say I'm not the greatest cook but this recipe is foolproof!  I will be making this again and again and again.

Pretty good! It's really hearty and lots of good stuff in there. I made a few modifications... First of all, I don't think it's too spicy, so I'd leave the chili powder as is. Second, I omitted the onions and added corn. I also left out the celery (due to the ingredients I had around). I served it with Balsmati white rice, it's hearty enough to go right over the top. Really good. I put a little parmasan cheese on top as well. 

If you want it to be more "soupy" I'd definitely add water or chicken broth. This has more of the consistency of a stew. But, I like it as is.

We used this recipe for the first time we made chili - and it turned out amazing! The true test was feeding it to 4 unsuspecting friends, and each and everyone went back for seconds! Was extremely filling. We added some meat, zuchini, and about half of the chili powder. We also added some diced jalapeno - excellent!

This was delicious and so simple!
What is great about this recipe is that on its own its great, but it takes no effort to add any other ingredient you wish! I could easily add everything I like in chili, even  what I've never had in it before!

Easy to make, delicious and versitile.  I've made it 4 times, and my hubby the vegeterian loves it!  I generally toss in an extra can of beans (such as black beans or pinto beans) along with the chick peas, just to make it a little thicker and hardier and I use whatever veggies I have on hand.  Definatley a recipe I will use over and over again!

This was VERY yummy! I made it for some friends and they all asked for the recipe! :-) You can make it ahead and then throw it in a crockpot later! I will definitely make this again and again!

My girlfriend is vegetarian and I made this for her. The aromas were beautiful and it is so easy to do. She made up some vegetable chilli enchilladas with it.

I made this for a Lenten soup supper (so it had to be meatless).  I thought it was too spicy, but was told that people enjoyed it (and there was none left over).  After reading reviews, I omitted the zucchini and added a can or corn (drained).   I added a 16 oz can of diced tomatoes, used 28 ounce can of crushed (not whole) tomatoes and decreased the chili powder to 3 Tablespoons.

This was good. Very east to make too.  I made it for a get together so my vegan sister would have something to eat.  She liked it, but there were some non-vegans in the crowd who thought it was just OK.

This was good, however, you don't taste any of the vegetables--just the chili flavor. Therefore, I nix the idea!  I like the flavor of vegetables in my veg dishes.

This recipe is excellent!  It has a lot of flavor.  I did alter it a bit, adding more of the things I like (like celery and garlic.)  I also added corn and a pound of ground beef.  It barely fit in my slow cooker!  At first it appears as though there is not enough liquid, but as things start to cook down the chili gets a better consistency.  It took 4-5 hours on high, but only because the carrots take so long to get soft.  I WILL be making this one again!

This is excellent veggie chili. The prep does take quite a bit of time because of all the chopping, but it's worth the effort.  I made a double batch for a party and everyone gave it rave reviews. I added extra chili powder because we like it with a little extra bite. Even so, it wasn't spicy at all.

We loved it!  The we is my daughter and I - my husband wouldn't even taste it - no meat.  I omitted the zucchini and doubled the carrots, added extra onion, black beans and extra spices.  It was perfect and even better the next day.  Thanks for the recipe.  I am sending to all my friends.

This tasted weird.  I put less chili powder in than the recipe called for, due to what other reviewers said, and it still had too much chili powder.  Also, the carrots did not get cooked all the way.  It was good enough to eat, but I will not be making it again.

This is a gorgeous looking dinner!  My husband loved it, his only suggestion was to cut WAY down on the chili powder (and for him to say it's too hot is unusual.)

Wow, they oughtta put a warning label on this stuff!  I even reduced the chili powder to 1/4 cup and this stuff is blazing!  I also substituted kidneys for the garbs and a small bag of frozen corn for the zucchini.  I went the slow route and did about 6/12 hours on low heat.  I like more beans in my chili so next time I may subsitute another can in place of one of the veggies.  Great stuff though, I will make again!

Good and spicy!  I actually went out and bought cumin for this, it really makes a huge difference in the flavor.  I used home-canned tomatoes.  Maybe that was why it wasn't as thick as I like.  But it was still wonderful, and I'll make this one again.

Very easy and tasty!  I love meat and I didn't miss it at all.  I didn't have whole tomatoes, just a can of crushed.   I also didn't have any peppers, so I omitted them.  I added fresh rosemary and oregano and it was great.  Thank you for a no-fuss, healthy, week-night dinner!

I love this dish. But it calls for WAY too much chili powder. I used 1/4 c. and it is still a bit much, but tolerable. I also added beef to it and it is really good.

As the sole vegetarian in my family it's usually the carnivores who win out with the chili recipes, until now!  I prepared this for an office potluck and it was a hit.  It makes a lot so when I make it again I may freeze half for a quick weeknight dinner.   Add a little shredded cheese and some crusty bread,....YUM!!

This is delicious, but DO NOT use 1/3 C of chili powder!  I'm from Texas and like things so spicy my nose runs, but both my roommate and I couldn't handle the spice.  The flavors of the veggies were good though, and I'll make it again (just using lots less chili powder- probably 3 teaspoons or so!

I've been looking for a good veggie chili recipe and this is it!  A little too much chili powder for my taste, made it seem unbalanced.  I'll cut back and add more oregano and cumin next time and see if it will even out, but all in all, very good and very easy since there is no additional cooking of the veggies.  Thank you!

Made this last night for the first time.  It was my husband's first experience with vegetable chili and he really liked it!  We both really enjoyed it and decided that it's a keeper.  I left out the carrots as I didn't have any, and I added some mexican blend cheese on top when I served it.  Also served cornbread with it.  I highly recommend this recipe!

I found this recipe to be very bland as chili.  Having said that, I adapted the "chili" by adding it to chicken broth to make a half decent vegetable soup.  I wouldn't make this recipe again.

I was looking for a good, healthy chili recipe; I found it with this one.  I did add a small ammount of beef to it and used kidney beans instead of chickpeas,and it was wonderful.  Thanks for the recipe

This was delicious-- though I overdid it on the spices. I added  2 tablespoons of cayenne pepper for some reason... that combined with the chili powder made for a nose dripping experience, but it was still delicious. I also added a can of black beans. I'm a vegetarian but my carnivorous husband thought it was amazing as well :)

I served this over fritos with sour cream.  I added slighty less chili powder.  Everyone in the family enjoyed this--even the kids.

I thought this lacked substance, probably because there is not fat in it whatsoever.  Next time, I may use different types of beans and different vegetables.  My sister, who is vegan, loved it.

This recipe was very easy to prepare and had great flavor. And by flavor I mean it was Spicy!! Only one member of my family thought it was too spicy. I made it with fresh garbanzo beans and serrano peppers instead of the canned.

I liked the variety of beans and veggies in this mix, but the thing it lacked for me was SPICE! (It was even slightly sweet, I found.) Next time I make it, I'll use 3 tbsps chili powder instead of one. Maybe more. But it was still tasty.

This turned out pretty good. I wouldn't really consider it a "chili" but more of a tasty vegetable soup. Has really nice flavor!

Delicious and easy.  I didn't have access to a slow cooker, so  I cooked it on low for about 2 hours on the stove top.  I left out the chili powder for a less adventurous audience, and added more of the oregano and cumin instead.  For myself, I would have liked more kick, but the flavor was still great.

I made this for a group of friends just before Thanksgiving and it was a huge success!  Great flavor and can even be cooked on the stove if you need (just sautee the veggies until soft and let simmer as long as you can).

Very good, but not quite a chili. I added about 1 1/2 cups chicken broth because there was no liquid at all. Had a delicious flavor with all the veggies, but a bit more like a hearty vegetable soup.

I made this chili for my husband because he was sick and it sounded like a wholesome, spicy soup to help heal!  I omitted the zucchini and added a can of kidney beans.  For the spices, I added 1 Tbls of each, and it's just the right amount of heat for me, especially with the green chilies.  My slow cooker is also a rice cooker with just one heat setting which I think is high, so I set it on high for a couple hours and it's perfect.

My husband does NOT like vegetarian dishes, but he LOVED this!  It is so hearty and filling that you will never miss the meat!  I love that this chili is hearty and healthy and so very colorful!  I left out the ingredients I didn't have on hand, and added a few more cans of whatever I did have in the pantry.  I added a can of corn and a can of ranch style beans, and extra bell pepper, and added some hot sauce and creole seasoning.  This was a great recipe if you're cooking on a budget or need to clean out the pantry and fridge!  I will be keeping this one in my recipe box!  Thank you!

This is a good, hearty, tasty vegetarian chili. I just made minor adjustments. I used petite diced tomatoes instead of crushed, 2 cans of garbanzo beans instead of just 1. I added more garlic. I decreased the chili powder to one tablespoon. I found it to be on spicy side for me. I cannot imagine using 1/3 cup chili powder in this recipe. It would have made it inedible for my taste buds. Next time I will use even less than 1 Tablespoon. I will definitely make this recipe again.

This is the best chili recipe.  The key is the sauted celery, onion, garlic, and especially the corn.  I use frozen corn of good quality when not in season.  I have varied the types of beans and added tomato sauce (sweeter and saltier, but my husband likes it) and usually have to add water, unless putting it in the crock pot.   My biggest change is using taragon instead of oregano once cooking without my glasses.  Taragon isn't usually a favorite, but was a BIG hit in this chili, do so I use it all the time now.

This is an AMAZING and easy chilli !!!  I have never liked chilli until I tried this recipe.  My husband loves chilli - so we were trying to find something we could both like.  The only thing I changed was that I added in some cooked chop meat.  I have also made this chilli for guests and everyone always raves about it !!!

I made this for a small gathering of people (with 5 total, so perfect serving amounts!) and it was a hit. The only change I made was less chili powder since I didn't have as much as I thought. It was still very flavorful, just less spicy. No one minded that it was meatless either! Excellent recipe. Would make again.

This is a great vegetarian recipe. I omitted the celery as I thought it would be too 'mushy' after 6 hours in the slow cooker. Instead of using canned chilis, I used some hot peppers from my garden. As with a lot of chili recipes, they always seem to taste better the next day after the flavours have blended together.
This is a great recipe and I will definitely be making this again.

I used dry great northern beans rather than canned and cut the amount of chili powder down to 1 tablespoon. I also used tomato sauce from scratch and  did not completely puree the tomatoes. I will definitely make this again.

I added kidney beans and served it with sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese too. It was delightful and a hit with my GNO friends!

It was a bit bland and was lacking in something.  I added a cup of beef broth which helped some but I need to tweak the recipe some more.

I always tweak recipes,  I did not add as much chilie powder and I did not have carbona beans on hand, so I added six bean melody. I also added ground beef as I am not a vegetarian and like my meat .  This was the best chili I have ever made with lots of flavour and my family love it too as there was not much leftover. I definitely will make again.

The recipe was great sans the beans. I added a lot more veggies and 2 cups of veggie broth. Worked out well!

Very good chili.  I added a couple cans of red kidney beans. I also added A small can of diced tomatoes with chili peppers  since I  could not find fresh chili peppers at the store. I substituted a tablespoon of chipotle  chili powder for some of the regular chili powder because I like the chipotle flavor.  I also added 2 cups of vegetable broth because I like a lot of broth and my chili.It really made a large batch of chili so I froze a lot of it.

I used a can of mixed beans instead of the garbanzo beans and I personally added a bunch of Louisiana Hot Sauce to my bowl.

Delicious! I added black beans,  kidney beans and corn and served it with rice. It was perfect. Just the right amount of spice and very hearty. I like vegetarian dishes, but my husband really feels the need for meat in everything, but he didn't miss it in this dish. We will definitely have it again!

Wonderful recipe. I actually enjoy the celery in this and anyone who knows me knows me and celery don't mix. In this recipe they go great.

Added less chili powder because of the reviews and it just seemed odd to put in so much.  It tasted like all the flavors where fighting each other.  The sweetness of the tomatoes ruined the dish.  It was also soupy.

Too spicy for me but I am not fond of really spicy foods. I will definitely try it again with smaller quantities of spices though.
