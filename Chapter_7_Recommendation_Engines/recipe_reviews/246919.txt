I cooked for 2 1/2 hours and the meat was still way too tough.

This was delicious! Super simple to assemble at the end of a long day, and very satisfying. I served it with tortillas and made rice to go with the leftovers.

This is very easy to make. I added an extra onion and a yellow bell pepper. I would leave it 30 min longer in the oven. The meat comes out extremely tender.
