not bad after you do some tweaking. i added more water to get a consistency I liked. i also added soy sauce, fish sauce, onion powder, more garlic, and a little more lemon. i tossed the chicken in fish sauce and soy sauce before i placed it under the broiler.

Wow, this was the most satisfying meal I have had in my 1st week on the SB Diet. It is a good basic recipe that was great with a few additions. I marinated in soy & fish sauce with turmeric and ginger. I added fish sauce to the peanut sauce and instead of water I thinned it with chicken broth that had a little thai red curry paste mixed in. I grilled fresh vegies along side the chicken and dipped it all in the sauce! Super Yummy!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I made mine into a stir fry and added the sauce to it.  I added more soy sauce and more water.  I do not like sugar replacement so I added just a touch of honey.  I also used zucchini, onions, spinach, crushed red pepper flakes and spicy peanuts.

This was an ok recipe. I sauteed the chicken in the soy sauce instead of rubbing the chicken with it. Like others, I doubled the water and added a little bit more soy suace to make the sauce a little thinner. After this it did taste JUST like the restaurant. BUT it tastes better with the REAL chicken satay, not so much with this. Give it try if you're looking for something different in the diet.

This was great!  I brushed the chicken with spicy Chinese mustard.  It gave it a great kick and tasted great with the peanut sauce.  By the way:  follow the peanut sauce measurements. I tried to "eyeball" the recipe & had to start over on the sauce.

A rather loose interpretation of the real thing, but edible. I might make it again, but I would modify the peanut sauce, perhaps by adding some fish sauce to make it taste more like thai.

Good flavor. We doubled the recipe and had it as a full meal with a small salad. The sauce recipe made more than enough.

Felt like I was eating chicken coated with peanut butter. Sauce to thick even with additional liquids. Not a favorite here, though we did have a few laughs over it. Don't think I'll be making this one again.

The dipping sauce was okay but needed something... it tasted too much like straight-up peanut butter.  I will try adding fish sauce, more soy, and more lemon juice next time.

This sauce tasted just like melted peanut butter. If I make it again, I would double all sauce ingredients EXCEPT the peanut butter, and hopefully end up with a more authentic tasting satay. It is definitely easy, though!

I knew I would like this recipe, but I wasn't sure about my family.  But my picky husband and suspicious 5 year old thought it was really good.  I think the idea of peanut butter and chicken is hard to accept, but the taste is so good, you get over it fast!

I've made this a few times, either as a high protein snack or paired with a salad for a healthy meal. My boyfriend and I thought that the first few bites of this tasted strange, but then it quickly grew on us. Maybe it just takes a few bites to adapt to the flavor. You probably won't like this recipe if you're not a fan of peanut butter. I find the flavor to be quite unique and very tasty! This is a great quick, easy, and *healthy* recipe!

I give the chicken 5 stars and the dipping sauce 2 stars for a combined score of 5! The sauce wasn't horrible, but I just couldn't get over the fact that I was eating peanut butter with my chicken!

The chicken, however, was delightful. It tasted just as good, cold, the next day. Will definitely make this again, and try to find a different dipping sauce.

These were delicious! The sauce makes the dish in IMO. I didn't make chicken strips. I sauteed the chicken and served the sauce on the side. The next day I had the leftover sauce with pork. I did find the sauce to be too thick so I added some extra soy sauce and water.

I chopped up the chicken into little bits and sauteed it in a frying pan with a little bit of light soy sauce, adding the peanut sauce at the end.  My husband loved it!  This peanut sauce is really yummy and diet friendly.  Can't go wrong.

I have made this recipe several times now and it's become a family favorite.  It's so easy and really flavorful.  I add green onions and crushed peanuts as a topping, a whole packet of the sugar substitue and regular ol' Jif peanut butter and pour the sauce over pasta.  Sometimes I make it with the chicken and sometimes not, depends on what I have in the fridge. Even my 2 1/2 yr. old eats it!

I really liked it!  I used regular sugar and regular peanut butter, since I'm not on a diet.  I did use lite soy sauce, since the regular stuff is way too strong a flavor for me.  I wasn't blown away by the flavor of the sauce on the chicken, but I did like it overall. I thought it was different enough and certainly easy enough to make so that I'll be making it again.  This recipe is idiot-proof.  I nuked the sauce for a full minute - the peanut butter blends into the other ingredients really well once it's all melted and you get this great sauce.  It's really nice and a piece of cake to make - I think this will be a week-day staple.  Thanks!

I thought this was excellent.  When I sampled the peanut sauce separately, I thought it was going to be a flop, but when combined with the chicken, it's really delicious, with an entirely unique flavor.

I made this for dinner tonight with some sticky rice and I thought I was pretty good. My husband liked it a lot and wants me to make it again. Although I love peanut butter, I thought the sauce may have been "too peanutbuttery". In any event, I don't consider this a retaurant quality recipe but it is definately good for just the family.

This is a FABULOUS recipe for peanut dipping sauce.  I made it with regular peanut butter and sugar (since we're not dieting) and it was amazing.  Friends and family loved it.  Be careful not to over-do the lemon juice if you do add extra, since it can mess up your ratio and flavor a bit. *I used fresh minced garlic, and it was great.

Not bad -- we did the chicken on the grill which added a great smokey flavor.

I don't really eat a lot of Thai food, so I can't really say if this has an authentic Thai flavor...but I think it's delicious! We make this sauce all the time, it's so easy. Last week, we made 8 servings, thinned it a little and had it over ww pasta...yummy.

I liked this, but I did think the sauce was too thick.  Next time I will make it thinner with more water.  I marinated the chicken in the soy sauce for more flavor.

Excellent...prepared this for the first time for my stepdaughter's lingerie shower along with a broccoli rice stir fry.  The peanut dipping sauce was yummy and a big hit among the ladies.  I was pleasantly surpried to see how easy this was to prepare...I had never made anything before like this.  The prepared chicken was easy to thread onto skewers and made for a pretty presentation.

Fabulous!  The sauce was delicious and quick to make.  I used an entire Splenda packet though - it wasn't quite sweet enough without the whole thing.  I was too lazy to cut up the chicken so I just sauteed the breast and poured the sauce over the top.  Worked great!

I will definitely be making this again.  Very easy and lots of flavor.  I thinly sliced the chicken and marinated it in soy sauce for at least 30 min.  Added a good 1/2 tsp Thai Red Curry Paste.  I made a huge difference in flavor for me.  Added a little more water for a thinner consistency, but it's a great recipe.

I love Thai food, and was skeptical about the ingredients while making the sauce, but I thought it tasted just like what you're served in a restaurant. The chicken was great too. I followed the directions exactly for the chicken, tenderizing it with a meat pounder, and rubbing on the soy sauce. I cooked it slowly in a small frying pan with a tiny bit of olive oil, and it was tender, juicy, and delicious! I absolutely loved it. I could eat this every night.

My husband and I thought this was pretty good. We just served the chicken breasts whole and cut it up ourselves. Next time, I'd marinate the chicken in the soy sauce, because you really couldn't taste it by just rubbing it on while grilling.

This was pretty good. I chopped up the chicken before cooking and added the peanut sauce to the chicken in the pan when cooked (made as a meal not an appetizer). The only thing unappetizing about this dish is the appearance of the sauce..reminded me of..should I say this...liquid poop! Otherwise, fairly good! ha

I really didn't like this.  I used garlic salt instead of garlic powder but I don't think that really mattered.  I felt like I was dipping my chicken in peanut butter.

Fake sugar is really bad for you so use the real thing or none at all.
