WOW WOW WOW!  However, I did make a few changes--butter instead of shortening, two teaspoons of vanilla  (added right with the eggs), and an extra cup of oatmeal.  Absolutely chewy and delicious!  I only cooked them for 10 min at 350, but left them on the trey for 5 min to firm up well.  Thanks, even better then the oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipe from Nestle!

Gave it 4 stars cuz I had to change a few things to make it 5 (I hate it when people review a recipe and rate it based on what they changed!  They're not rating that recipe anymore!) Don't listen to other reviews and substitute butter... you'll just have flatter cookies NOT tastier! I added 1/2 c. oats, 1 tsp. vanilla, 1 tsp. cinnamon, and halved the amount of salt...5 stars now!

Wonderful cookie! I made a few changes though,
 1 1/2 cups of rolled oats, 1 tsp vanilla and you only need to bake them 7-10 minutes.  A nice, soft/chewy cookie with wonderful texture from the oatmeal.  My Kids and husband LOVED them.
Thanks, Tammy

I used half butter flavored shortening and half salted butter, cut the salt in the recipe in half, added a teaspoon of vanilla, and used mini-chips instead of full-sized chips (and I always use unbleached flour). This is the BEST cookie I have ever made! Cannot go wrong here! I made a full batch, cooked one sheet of cookies right away, took the rest of the dough, put half in a baggie in the fridge, then took the remainder and rolled it into a roll in wax paper and froze it wrapped in foil. We had fresh baked cookies for a week, it froze great! Make it ahead and freeze it for later! A+++++

I have had this recipe for over 20 yrs.  But mine calls for 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp of water.  I also bake at 375 for 8-10 minutes and they turn out very chewy.

I used this recipe for my main ingredients but I did change a few things as people suggested. I used 1/2 cup shortening, 1/2 cup butter, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 1/2 cups oats and 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips. I also changed the temperature to 325 degrees and cooked it for about 2 minutes longer and mine turned out AWESOME! I use a cooking stone (as I always do) and they cooked evenly and they were chewy and yummy. My husband and I ate all of them within 2 days. They were great the next day too. They had alot of chocolate in them, just as I like so if you don't like too much chocolate in it, I would use maybe 3/4 cup of chocolate instead.

Quite good.  I put in a tsp of vanilla like other reviewers suggested, and replaced 1/2cup of shortening with butter.  I also replaced 1/2 a cup of the white flour with whole wheat flour.  You can't taste the whole wheat flour but it gives a nice speckled appearance to the cookie and another layer of texture... plus it's a good way to sneak some more whole grains into your kids, who think they are just getting chocolate chip cookies!  Delicious and will make again.

These cookies were great!  I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I didn't put in a full two cups of chocolate chips because that seemed like too much, and I added a little vanilla.  They were wonderful and all my friends loved them!

I thought this cookie was delicious!  I didn't have enough chocolate chips so I added some chopped pecans - YUM!  I also used unsalted butter instead of shortening and added about 1/2 teaspoon vanilla - because I love vanilla.  The cookie was crisp on the edges and soft in the middle - just delightful!

FANTASTIC cookie!  I followed the suggestions of SEETHING and I used half butter flavored shortening and half salted butter, cut the salt in the recipe in half, and added a teaspoon of vanilla.  I froze 3/4 of the batter and have enjoyed fresh, hot cookies whenever.  MUST bake these!

Delicious flavor but terribly flat.  I followed the recipe almost exactly (I omitted 1/2 tsp of the salt).  Next time, I think I'll try quick oats intead of rolled (old fashioned) oats.  That may help keep them from spreading out all over the sheet.  If you like a super-thin, crispy cookie...don't change a thing!  (Except the salt part.  1 tsp is just too much.)

Of the the oatmeal cookies I've tried these are by far the best ones and this recipe is a keeper! 350 degrees for 10 mins in a convection oven leaves them undercooked so that once cooled they're chewy and perfect! I added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of vanilla extract, killer recipe!

Oatmeal chocolate chip cookies have been my favourite since childhood but I'm very picky when it comes to them.  I was so happy to find this recipe and with a few changes suggested from another reviewer they were PERFECT!  My only changes were 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp of water. Will absolutely make again!!!

I usually never bake with shortening because I find it disgusting.  However, after reading several reviews that substituting butter would make the cookie flatter, I decided to test out the shortening to see if I noticed a difference.  The difference was amazing and I didn't notice the the taste of the shortening at all.  I followed this one to the -T- and they came out DELICIOUS!  Thanks so much for submitting

This is a lovely cookie. It has a great texture. The only thing that's missing is a little flavor that the butter would give. I think  I'll try half and half next time. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious cookies! I gave it a 4 because I changed a couple of things, but it's a really great recipe. I reduced the sugar and did 3/4 brown and 1/4 white; I used butter instead of shortening; I also used 1 cup flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour; added 1 tbsp of water; and reduced the chocolate chips to 1 cup, and it turned out perfect. In the end I also did a couple of cookies with some raisins and cinnamon and it was great. Also left a bit more in the oven so they were crispy. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This was amazing!!! I followed another cook's advice and added vanilla and butter instead of shortening. It was so delicious it was hard for me to get the batter into the oven!!! 

I baked one batch and froze the rest so I can have them at a moment's notice. HURRAY!

Our family loves these cookies!  I do half shortening and half butter and add 1.5 tsp of vanilla, keep the rest the same.  Mine are done around 10 min.  Mine do flatten out but we dont mind, the outside is crisp and the inside moist and flavorful.

Great!!! 1/2 cup margarine in place of shortening as that is what I had with 1 cup of chocolate chips instead of 2 cups. Used 2 tsp per cookie yielded 27 cookies

You can not beat this recipes if you like chewy cookies! A reminder: ADD 1 TSP. of Vanilla- and it is perfection. Also for a bonus try adding a cup of walnuts for crunch. Note this makes alot of cookies sometimes I divode the batch in half. It's always gone within two days.

This is my go-to recipe. Like others suggested, I add vanilla; other than that, I've added anything in the pantry I can find! Butterscotch chips and pecans and cardamom, white chocolate chips and raisins and Chinese 5-spice powder (try it!), and chopped salted mixed nuts and cinnamon with the chocolate chips. (I leave out the salt when I make this version!)  I use butter-flavor shortening, but while I occasionally have to use all white sugar, I prefer this version with half brown and half white.

AMAZING!! These came out delicious! I was a bit skeptical when I was mixing the ingredients; it looked like it'd be so dry. But it all came together so nicely. I took the advice of another reviewer and baked them at 375 for 8-10 mins. This made them soft and moist. I also used 1 tsp of vanilla extract.  I used mini chocolate chips since that's all I had, but I think it made them that much better! They looked, and tasted, amazing. :)

These are quite tasty! They definitely didn't need the full 15 minutes, so I pulled the second batch sooner. I omitted the white sugar entirely to make it a little healthier, and added 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/8 tsp nutmeg to spice them up a bit.

I make these JUST as the recipe calls for, out of respect for the person who wrote it. They are fantastic just the way they are! Because my oven is an older model and harder to regulate temp., I bake them for 13 minutes instead of 15 (found out after the first batch got a bit too brown!).

Note after baking a dozen batches of these: I prefer the milk chocolate morsels in this cookie. They melt better and are silkier than semisweet.

I made exactly as written and they tasted just fine. I had problems with the amount of time stated to cook - my first batch were completely burned when I left them in the oven for the 15 minutes as stated.  cut minutes with each additional batch and found that 11 minutes at 350 degrees worked best! I have never had this problem before, so I am sure it is not my oven. Good luck!

DH raved about these cookies as written.  Personally, I'd like about half the amount of chocolate chips and find them too sweet, but it IS a cookie.  This is the Toll House recipe with oats substituted for part of the flour.  Great idea!

This recipe has been a staple in my household. I add 1-2 teaspoons of vanilla to the wet mix, otherwise I follow the recipe exactly. These freeze well too!

Wow, these were terrible! The cookie dough would not stick, so the chocolate chips kept falling off and the oats wouldn't stick either. The cookies came out of the oven the same size I had put them in, they never flattened even when I did so before baking them. I will never make these again.

After reading other reviews I made the following changes:  Added a teaspoon of vanilla extract, two tablespoons of water, used crisco baking sticks (butter) instead of shortening and I baked them at 375 degrees for ten minutes.  They came out great and I'll probably make another batch tomorrow.  Even four hours later, they're soft with a perfect amount of crunch on the bottom.  I love them!

I LOVED these cookies. However, I did have to add extra flour to make the consistency right, otherwise they spread too much. I added WHITE CHOCOLATE chips along with DRIED cherries instead of choc. chips. WONDERFUL!!!

I love these cookies! They are delicious! Next time I'll add a few tsp. of vanilla  extract. They are so good, and the chocolate chips make it taste so rich! I used 1 cup of chocolate chips and 1 cup of butterscotch chips instead of 2 cups of chocolate chips only. They gave it a sweet, chocolaty, rich flavor that was amazing! I had to bake mine for 17 minutes instead of 15. They are so good! I'll make these again! :)

An excellent basic cookie recipe that I made even more delicious with the following substitutes: butter for shortening, Demerara sugar for the brown and white sugar, and spelt flour for all-purpose flour. The Demerara sugar really gives the cookies an extra richness and a beautiful golden caramel colour. Thank You!

Very good! I gave it 4 stars because I changed it a little. I halved the salt, used half shortening and half butter, used 1/2 cup white sugar instead of 3/4 and probably even could have used less. I added a tsp. of vanilla and used mini chocolate chips. Will def. make again!

What drew me to this recipe to begin with was the fast that it did not require any butter (since I was out) so I did not follow the other reviewers suggestions. These turned out great. I did add 1 tsp cinnamon (which I am I a firm believer no oatmeal cookie should be without) and 2 tsp cinnamon. This will be my go to recipe when I am without or low on butter and cant make my regular chocolate chip cookie recipe. If you do use butter make sure it is softened as melted butter will yield a flat cookie. If you accidentally melt it add another tsp of baking soda. Of course using shortening to begin with will give you terrific results.

Yummmm!  I think I might like these better than traditional toll house.  Very good.  The only thing I added was about 1 tsp. of vanilla and that's because I tend to add vanilla to any sweets recipe that is without it.  Will definitely make again and again!

AMAZING!  My only change was adding 1 tsp. vanilla after beating in the eggs.  These cookies are very rich!  I made half the batch and froze the rest for later.  One of the best cookie recipes EVER!!  I will definitely make them again.

Tasted the dough before I added a couple things and it was just OK, not that good. It needed more flavor. So, I added a tsp. of vanilla and a tsp. of maple. The dough tasted great then! I cooked them for 13 minutes and they came out a little crunchy, and still a bit bland for my taste. I did two test cookies, adding rum extract to one, and almond to the other... and I only cooked them for 12 minutes. The verdict was both were delicious! I recommend splitting your batch and half and doing half almond extract, half rum extract! Maybe a tsp each! And 12 minutes was perfect time!

Normally the first time I make something from this site, I follow the recipe as written, because that's only fair. But since there were so many reviews and modifications, I made changes I now regret. I added 1 tsp. Vanilla, all butter instead of shortening, reduced salt to 1/2 tsp., and cut the oats down to 1 1/2 cups. ICK! By reducing the oats and keeping the semi sweet choc chips at 2 cups, the chocolate overwhelmed the cookie. So much so that we all agree they taste bitter, with barely a hint of oatmeal. Also, I think by using all butter and no shortening, the cookies spread out like flat discs. I gave it 4 stars because it's not the submitter's fault I didn't follow instructions, but why a few people made them that way and raved, I just don't get it. Half shortening with half butter, 1/2 tsp salt, full oats, 1 tsp vanilla, a little cinammon, and 1 or 1 1/2 cups choc chips would be my recommended changes, if you change anything at all. They are incredibly soft though and only took 7 1/2 minutes for a chewy center and golden brown bottoms! Yielded 60 cookies for me.

Amazing! I used all butter, added 1 1/2 tsp vanilla, and a couple of dashes of cinnamon. Some of the best cookies I've ever made!

Day one: Yummy! This recipe is a keeper.  I used the recipe as written plus added the vanilla and cinnamon.  Day two:  these cookies are hockey puck hard. Make sure you eat these the first day or you'll be using these as dunkers.  At least they are tasty dunkers!

I am giving this cookie recipe 5 stars even though mine came out incredibly flat.  But that's my fault because I took the advice of several reviewers who suggested cutting the amount of oats to 1 1/2 cups.  It might have worked out ok, but I didn't have any shortening on hand so I had to use all butter.  I should have known better...I've made enough cookies to know that butter makes a flat cookie.  I added a 1/2 cup of flour to the batter after baking a few batches and they came out MUCH better.  Also, just wanted to note that I found an oat cookie recipe a few years ago that called for processing the oats in a food processor to get the texture of, say, wheat germ.  I like this in a cookie much better than whole oats.  All in all, a simple, tasty, soft, yummy cookie. It was an easy recipe for my 4 year old to help me with and she loves them so I'm sure we haven't seen the last of them.

Awesome cookies!  These are the perfect oatmeal chocolate chip cookie - Wonderful flavor and texture.  I usually follow the recipe exactly the first time, but this time I did make the following changes:  (1) used 1/2 c. shortening and 1/2 c. butter, (2) used 1 c. AP flour and 1/2 c. WW flour, and (3) used 1-1/2 c. chocolate chips and 1/2 c.chopped walnuts.  Next time I will add a tsp. of vanilla.  I also tried baking at 350 and 375 degrees.  Baking at 350 degrees resulted in a thicker, chewier cookie which I prefer.  This is a keeper!

I modified this recipe a bit.  I used: 1/4 cup Splenda and 1/2 cup white sugar (instead of 3/4 cup white sugar), 2 cups store bought granola (instead of 2 cups rolled oats) and 1/2 cup shortening + 1/2 cup butter (instead of 1 cup shortening).  I also added 1 tsp vanilla.  They are super soft and scrumptous!  Thanks for the recipe!

Was the cookie I was looking for. Used butter instead of shortening.  Added 1 tsp. vanilla.  Reduced salt to 1/2 tsp.  Added 1 cup chopped walnuts.  Used Quick 1 Minute oatmeal.  Baked it in a convection oven at 350' 10 mins for softer cookie, 11 mins for a bit browner.  We were in the mood for a bit browner cookies.  Made 6 dozen 2 1/2" cookies with .6 oz spoonfuls. 
I also found these cookies were better refrigerated.  Unfortunately, when they are refrigerated I eat more.  Definately a keeper.

Great recipe! I made a lower calorie version based on some of the previous comments. My son and wife loved them and the revised version! The changes are below: 

- Used one stick of butter and ½ cup of applesauce
- Added ½ cup of raisins 
- Used 1 ½ cups of oatmeal vs 2 cups  
- Added ½ teaspoon of cinnamon 
- Added ½ teaspoon of nutmeg
- Used ¾ cups of chocolate chips (I know, I should have used more but most of the cookies had enough in them) 

Oh, and I increased the baking time to about 16-20 minutes or until they became a semi-dark tan color…this firmed up the cookie and made it a little crisp on the outside and chewy in the middle.

These turned out really well, but I am looking for a chewier oatmeal-choc chip recipe.  The texture of these cookies is more crumbly than chewy, but  wonderful if you like the crumbly-type of cookie. My husband loves them.  I will keep looking for that chewy cookie recipe, but I will probably make this again.

This recipe was wonderful. At first I thought they were too thin and not chewy enough for me, but the more I ate the more I enoyed the crispiness. I used butter instead of shirtening and added a little vanilla and dash of cinnamon/sugar. My oven tend to cook fast, so I only cooked for 12 minutes. My husband said they were the best cookies I ever made!

These were good. I didn't have shortening so I used butter. I added a little extra flour and oats as well as 1/4 tsp cinnamon. Though I wish I had added more than that! Thanks for the recipe!

After reviewing 20 "best" oatmeal choc chip recipes on the web, this is the best bet.  Vanilla missing must have been an accidental omission from the start.  Atkins Approach followers know that replacing shortening with butter is a "must."  I was surprised to discover after baking this recipe that it is almost identical to the Nestle choc chip recipe on the bag.  Add the vanilla and use butter in place of shortening and you are there.  Nestles uses an extra 3/4 cup of flour, which would make less runny as they spread.  Add oatmeal, and you have oatmeal cookies instead of Toll House.  Those reviewers who say it makes a flatter cookie are correct...butter is 15% liquid and 85% fat.  Some soothsayers adjust for this by adding an extra 2 TBSP butter for every cup of shortening called for in a recipe.  Last of all, allrecipes bakers who say a recipe turned out too dry might have used smaller eggs and drier flour.

really good....I did have to add an extra 1/2 cup of flour. The first batch I made was too thin and "lacey". After that I added the other 1/2c flour which made a more substantial cookie....very tasty. My hubby actually preferred the less flour, "lacey" batch which were kinda chewier and more "see-through" in look. All in all a yummy cookie...thanks!

Not bad - a little too chewy for my liking. I added cinnamon/vanilla like other users suggested but they just didn't stay together that well.

I adjusted the recipe to what another reviewer suggested.  Added 1 tsp vanilla extract and 1 tsp cinnamon.  This made for amazing cookies! I portioned mine with an icecream scoop and it took about 12 mins per batch.  We will be making these for years to come!

Fantastic recipe.  But DON'T GREASE THE COOKIE SHEETS; use parchment paper and NO CLEANUP. Also I followed other reviewers comments: used butter and 3 cups rolled oats plus the 1 tsp vanilla.  Cookies NOT FLAT! 10 minutes is enuf!

Wonderful chewy cookie.  I used peanut butter chips, chocolate chips and butterscotch chips as I had a small amount of each.  My family loved them made this way.  I will continue to use this recipe for oatmeal cookies.  Thanks Sheryl for a delicious recipe.

My 5 yr. Old daughter & I made these today, and it was so delicious. I listened to other reviewers and added 2 teaspoon of vanilla, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, sub 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour in place of the 1/2 cup of white flour, 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening and only added 1 1/2 cup of semi sweet chocolate chip. I also added 2 Tablespoon of wheat germ, baked for 11-12 
minute turned out fabulous. I feel that at least there is something healthy in a chocolate chip cookies :0)

Great cookies.  If you like toll house cookies, you should like these.  The only change I made was to add a cup of chopped walnuts.   I think if you preferred a richer cookie you could substitute a half cup of butter for a half cup of shortening but we liked them as is.  The only problem is trying to stop eating them.  Ah well, I’ll just suffer through it.

Today is my first time making these cookies and I used my CLEAN EATING knowledge and made them as a healthier version. I used only egg whites, splenda brown sugar, regular sugar, but only 1/2 what the recipe called for, applesauce no sugar added instead of shortening. I use only WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR and healthy oats. I added some wheat germ for extra heart health. Used dark chocolate mini chips. SO MOIST. Husband loves them :)

I made this recipe exactly as written except I added a couple teaspoons of vanilla because I love vanilla in almost everything I bake. They are delicious! My husband loved them and so did my 18 month old :)

I've made these before as written and they were good. I've since made some changes. I use half white and half wheat for the flour, splenda for the white sugar, I add cinnamon and vanilla, and even walnuts if I have them. Very good!

Good, easy-to-follow recipe I did sub butter in place of  the shortening however after making it and tasting it, seemed like the cookie was missing something?  I didn't use the vanilla which might have been it and I kept the recipe at 2 whole cups of rolled oats so that the oatmeal flavor really stood out.  I think next time I would add vanilla however a co-worker ate them and said they were the best cookies he's ever had so maybe I didn't need the vanilla after all :)

Pretty good. I think my semi-sweet chips were too much.  Might be better without chocolate or with raisins.

Great and easy to make. I added organic rolled oats in lieu of the instant oatmeal and added an extra handful as well. Made them very chewy and more akin to an energy bar. I would reduce the butter next time, and add coconut flakes for some more texture.

These cookies were wonderful! My husband couldn't stop eating them, he is laying on the couch now unable to move! I also used butter instead of shortening, and all brown sugar instead of white. They still turned out perfect, in our opinion!

I substituted butter for the shortening. Added 1 tsp vanilla. Replaced 1/2 cup of white flour with whole wheat. And increased the oats to 2 3/4 cups. I added some of the batter to vanilla ice cream...delicious! It replaces my favorite ice cream flavor: outrageous oatmeal cookie. You must try! :D Thank you.

These cookies are delicious. I changed a few things based on other reviews.  I added 1 tsp. vanilla, used 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips and 1 1/2 cups rolled oats, and baked for only 13 mins.
*Just made these again and they turned out excellent with the modifications above, however, 1 tsp. of salt is way too much!!  Next time I would use 1/4 to 1/2 tsp.

These were okay, but they seemed a bit bland-- like they were missing something. Very similar to my recipe, except that mine call for a bit of water. Maybe next time I'll experiment with half butter/half shortening and some vanilla. Good recipe with some tweaking.

Great recipes exactly as it is written.  I just added 1 tsp vanilla.  I also measured the dough out in tablespoons for a bigger sized cookie and only cooked them for 13 minutes.  Thanks, this one is a keeper!

The only reason I give this 3 stars, is that the dough was really yummy. The cookies were really flat (and I cooled the dough in the fridge first).

These cookies were very good! After reading the comments I added in 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1 tsp of vanilla, and a tbs of milk. The only other thing I'd do next time is not add in so many chocolate chips. Cooked for 12 min.

One word AMAZING! I took the advice of others and used 1/2 c. butter, and 1/2 cup shortening. I roo added 1 tsp of vanilla and a pinch of baking powder (to help them puff). They turned out soooo good. I only baked them for 12 minutes and let them sit on the pan for a few minutes before transporting them to my waxed paper. They are soft and fluffy. I divided the dough into 3 bowls. I made a dozen w/ o chocolate chips. I made a dozen with raisins instead of choco chip, and the rest I added the choco chips. All of them turned out wonderful

The cookies were delicious!!! I love how moist they came out. One thing I would like to point out is make sure that you don't overcook them. The first batch I left in for 15 min. and they were not very moist but with the other batches I took them out at around 12 min and they were perfect. I realize that everyone’s oven is different but I just thought that I would mention it.

I used this recipe as a jumping off point to make a much healthier cookie, but I was interested in the proportions of ingredients mostly.  This turned out very well.  (If anyone is interested, I used spelt instead of white flour, 3/4 cup coconut oil instead of the shortening, 1/2 cup organic brown sugar and 1/4 cup agave nectar instead of the refined sugars, only 3/4 cup chocolate chips, and I added a bit of vanilla).  They were delicious.  By the way, refrigerating them for a couple hours before baking really helped the texture.  NOTE: If you get flat, burned cookies, your dough was too soft!!  Add a little more flour or refrigerate the dough for a little while first.  It isn't the recipe's fault, you just didn't bake them right.

Awesome!  My boyfriend loved these and he's a big cookie fan.  The mixture gets very stiff so it's best to add the oatmeal and choc chips one cup at a time.  The recipe says it makes 42 but I got 50 good sized cookies out of the mixture so be prepared to grease more than one tray!!  Thanks.

I followed the suggestion to add one tsp. of vanilla.  I also used 1/2 c. applesauce in place of half the butter/shortening.  These were minor changes and the cookies were great so I still gave the recipe 5 stars.

Very delicious :)  Thanks for the recipe!  I made a few changes to adjust to my taste.  

1. Added additional 1/2 cup of Oatmeal
2. Added 1 1/2 teaspoon of Vanilla
3. Added 1 cup of chopped walnuts
4. Added 1/4 cup unsweetened coconut
5. Halved the salt since I used butter.
6. Baked 10 minutes.

Yummy yummy cookie.  I did make the following changes as rec by others:  1 stick butter and 1/2 C of butter flavored Crisco.  Also added 1 tsp of vanilla and a dash of salt.  Note:  let the cookies cool off a little before removing them from the cookie sheet.  I made a mess. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This recipe was great.  I did make it a little healthier by using whole wheat flour, smart balance butter and dark chocolate chips and they turned out amazing!!  My husband and son couldn't keep thier hands off them!  Thanks so much for the delicious recipe.

This is a great recipe!  I made exactly as directed except I added 1 tsp. vanilla, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and used Nestle semi sweet chunks instead of chips.  The cookies came out a beautiful golden brown, were perfectly rounded and had a nice texture.  My 1 1/2 year old couldn't get enough of these cookies and I felt like they are a little bit more nutritious than traditional chocolate chip cookies because of the whole grain rolled oats I made them with!

Amazing!  My husband begs for these cookies all the time.  We barely ever have leftovers but if we do, I stick them in the freezer and take one out a night and eat it as a snack. Mmmm.
Oh, I also substitute half of the shortening for butter. 

WONDERFUL!

I loved these cookies! I used 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of shortening. I also added 1 teaspoon of vanilla like the others suggested. I baked them only for 7 minutes and 45 seconds. They turned out great! I already gave my sister in law the recipe! I will definately make these again! Yummy!!!

This is the best cookie recipe that I have used from this site yet! except that I used butter instead of shortening and added a tbsp of vanilla flavoring. I had to make enough dough to freeze for later!

My husband wanted oatmeal chocolate chip cookies; oatmeal chocolate chip cookies, he got.  These were very like a classic chocolate chip cookie, except with a yummy chewy oatmeal thing happening!  I added a tsp. of vanilla, because I can't imagine making cookies without vanilla, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I would recommend keeping an eye on these as they cook, though; my oven runs pretty hot, but they were done (and on the verge of being overdone) in about seven minutes.

I followed this recipe exactly.  The crispy texture was to die for but I thought they were a little too sweet for me.  I am going to play with it a little more to get the flavor right for me, thinking 1 cup chocolate chips, 1 cup raisins might do the trick for me.  If you like a crispy cookie, this is right on the money!  Also, I rolled my cookies into balls then flattened onto parchment paper, baked 15 mins.

This is a really good basic recipe.  I followed the suggestions of others and decreased both the oatmeal and chocolate chips by 1/2 c; I also used margarine in place of shortening, because that's all I had.  I added about a tablespoon of vegetable oil in attempt to keep them soft and cooked for 12-15 minutes.  The cookies came out soft and tasty.  Next time I'll try butterscotch or cinnamon chips like others have.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are awesome!  I added a little vanilla and only used 1.5 cups of chocolate chips and 1.5 cups of rolled oats. One spoonfull really spread out into a large cookie.  These were a little crispier than a falling apart soft cookie but they were great!  For anyone who loves chocolate chip cookies, this is a nice twist!

Very nice.  Held its shape well with a nice texture and taste.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla and a healthy dash of nutmeg- baked for around 11 minutes. I also added some butterscotch chips in as well.  Next time I'll put in more brown sugar and less white sugar.

Umm.  Well.  These cookies were good.  But I didn't taste oatmeal in them AT ALL.  I followed the recipe and also took the advice of the "20 yr vet." and used 1 tsp of vanilla extract and 1 tsp of water.  They came out chewy, they were nice.  But as far as calling them "oatmeal" cookies, well....But maybe my taste buds are burnt out.  I gave them only 3 stars because I guess maybe the chocolate chips overroad the oatmeal.  But as far as taste, they were pretty good.  All the girls at work ate them (and they said the same thing, where's the oatmeal?)  I'll look for another "oatmeal" cookie recipe.  Thanks anyway!

Used all shortening because we like those kind of cookies and it did take all 15 minutes to bake. Cut salt in half and there was plenty. Added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1 tsp. vanilla. They turned out pretty good but not as good as my old standby recipe. Was a fun new recipe for the kids to try. UPDATE: The kids wanted cookies in a hurry so I doubled by half and used half shortening and half peanut butter. I also added all the salt this time and they were much better.

Followed the recipe exactly.  WONDERFUL taste, my picky 2, 4 and 6yr olds loved them.  I was looking for a little chewier cookie though - might play around with this recipe because this one is fabulous tasting but just really crumbly for someone with 4 kids to clean up after.  ;)  I might try applesauce next time instead...

I love to cook but am not a great baker....this recipe made me a hit with my kids!  I did the 1/2 butter and 1/2 butter flavour shortening, they were crisp and awesome.  I do not like chewy cookies so I was very pleased with these.I noticed that one user used smarties(in Canada they are like M&M's but in the Southern States they are like sweet tarts, I thought I might clarify.)

These are always a hit.  The trick is to take them out of the oven while they are still a little soft.  Once they are cool, they are the perfect combination of crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle.

I'm sorry, this recipe sounded so good, but the cookies didn't come out very good at all. I followed the recipe to the "t" ..the actual cookie part did not have much flavor at all and the chips were overpowering. Perhaps I will try it again some time adjusting the sugar that goes into the cookies and the amount of chips.

I was not sure these cookies would be very good since, as an amateur baker, I was surprised there was no butter in the recipe. The second batch of these just came out of the oven, and both my kids and my husband have circled the cookie rack like sharks, drank a half gallon of milk, and are leaving me with the crumbs to clean up. I DID make a few changes to this recipe, adding vanilla, altering the brown sugar/white sugar ratio, used butter flavored shortening, etc...but am sure the cookies would have been just as yummy without my chnages. One thing I would suggest everyone do is to decrease the heat to 325...as these are lovely cookies when just lightly golden. I also used my tablespoon sized measuring spoon as a scoop to give the cookies even edges, and have lovely little oatmeal "biscuits" as the result. My 6 YO said there were too many chocolate chips in her last cookie, but I think that was just her full tummy talking. However, dont hesitate to decrease the amount of chocolate. This recipe would also make a perfect raisin cookie. This is DEFINATLY a keeper, if nothing else as a FRUGAL dessert and lunch item! THANK YOU SO MUCH, WE LOVE THE COOKIES!

This is an amazing recipe. I did not have walnuts so used dried cranberries, dusted in flour.
Otherwise I followed her recipe as it seemed to be perfect and it was! I'll use walnuts next time!
My mom can't bake now, so I will take her some of these for a special treat tomorrow.

Good recipe, easy to follow. I made the base dough using butter and added raisins and sunflower seeds for one batch, and chocolate chips in another batch.  I also added cinnamon in both batches.  I don't know about the others, but mine definitely did not make 7 dozen as the recipe states.  More like 5 dozen of smaller cookies. Will try vanilla next time as others mentioned.

We liked these cookies.  I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening.  I used equal parts of flour and whole wheat flour.  I added 2 tablespoons of vanilla extract and 1 tsp of cinnamon.  Once I mixed everything, I added a little more flour.  I cooked on a baking stone and it took much longer ...  It took at least 25 mins.  Halfway through, I increased from 350 to 375 because they did not look like they were cooking.  I would make these again.

I followed this recipe to a T. The oven was fully preheated to 350, I left my cookies in for a full 15 minutes, and for some weird reason, the bottoms burned and tops did not cook, and they spread out like mush unevenly in the pan. I have no idea where I went wrong! I have followed ridiculously difficult recipes worse than this one before, and I have never gone wrong with a batch of cookies until this one.

I followed the direction and these were crunchy as soon as they cooled. The flavor was good and right out of the oven the we're perfect!

I followed the instructions almost exactly as stated.  I used vegetable shortening which made the dough really thick so I added about 1/4 cup almond milk.  I also added 1 tsp vanilla like others did.  They turned out great!

After following this recipe exactly the first time, I felt that something was missing.  I tried using butter instead of shortening, but the cookies were very flat, so I played around some more.  Finally, I used butter flavored vegetable shortening and added a pinch of cinnamon.  This was the key.  I also refrigerated the dough for an hour or so before baking.  Now the recipe is 5 stars.  These are now my go-to cookies.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy recipe! I substituted butter for shortening and substituted white whole wheat flour for the all purpose flour.  Cookies baked up nice and the recipe made a lot of cookies! Two-year old and hubby approved.

Delicious, with some adjustments. I used butter instead of shortenings, added 1 tsp vanilla and an extra cup of oatmeal. They did not spread at all! Baked for 11min @ 350. Next time I'll try another reviewers suggestion of adding cinnamon.

I have been using this reciepe for about a year now. The only thing I changed was using 1/2 butter and 1/2 butter flavored Crisco and added 1 tsp. each of vanilla and cinnamon. I also quadrupled the reciepe because I can't keep them in the cookie jar ... and my husband is the only one eating them! He RAVES about them to all the guys at work but I've threatened his very life if he gives anyone a taste. I'll be darned if I'm going to start making batches for the guys at work!!!

I have used this recipe dozens of times now - I don't really care for raisins but I crave an good oatmeal based cookie and I think this is a good middle ground.  I do add a bit of vanilla, cinnamon and a bit extra oats - usually 1/4 cup.  But these cookies always turn out fabulous.  I stick with the shortening, I have terrible luck backing with real butter, it never turns out right.  Anyways, great recipe Sheryl, I really enjoy them and so does my entire family!!  : )

I decided to follow the recipe the first time... and next time I think I will incorporate some of the suggestions. There weren't enough oats for my taste, next time it'll be 3 cups. I did cheat and add a tsp of vanilla, and glad that I did. The cookies were coming out a bit overdone on the outside and underdone on the inside at 9 minutes on 350F- after the first pan, I turned it down to 325F for 10-11mins and they came out much more even (but that could be my oven). I think some ground flax would be easily added, and minimally noticed. This recipe would also be great for other add-ins like dried cranberries, walnuts, butterscotch chips, or maybe some peanut butter!

Great!  I added a 3rd cup of oatmeal, as well as a generous handful of raisins and of nuts.  And instead of chocolate chips I put in three 200g dark chocolate bars, chopped into chunks.  Oh, and 2 tsps of vanilla too.  Got so many compliments on these!

These cookies are great.  I didn't have brown sugar so I just used white, and I also used whole wheat flour and added a tsp of vanilla.  So Good.  My husband loves them.

Very good cookies. I used butter-flavored shortening and I really think that helped to give the cookies some depth of flavor. With that one change these cookies are rich and chewy and they have that nice sturdy oatmeal cookie consistency that I like. I will definitely make these again!

Very good recipe. Made a few changes. I didn't have any eggs so I added a half a cup of water. Only added one cup of Oats and added 1 tbs of sliced Almonds. Very chocolaty so next time will only add 1 cup of chocolate chips

These cookies turned out burnt on the bottom and very chewy.  Instead of the recommended 15 minutes to bake, I knocked it down to 7 minutes, but it would always brown on the bottom and be raw in the middle.  

Even the better cooked cookies come out chewy (which some people like, I totally understand its a preference).  But beyond that the texture seemed very grainy and not much taste beyond the chocolate chips, despite the copious amount of sugar and butter.

I made this recipe with steel cut oats. Dont make the same mistake! They didnt cook and the cookies were just not right. I certainly can't blame the recipe since it specifies rolled oats, so I still rated it well. Just wanted to share to others learn from my error. :)

devouring a batch of these at the moment and they're delish! i subbed splenda for white sugar and didn't have enough chocolate chips, so i added raisins and walnuts to make up the difference. i also added 1tsp of vanilla, 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, and a tsp of nutmeg (i really like the chocolate/spice cookie combo). these cookies have great texture and depth of flavor with the additional spices and extract.  plus they're super simple and the kids had a lot of fun helping make them.  thanks!!

Very simple & tastey recipe. I do make a few minor changes. (1) sub 1/2 cup softened butter and 1/2 cup shortening for 1 cup shortening; (2) Only 3/4 ts salt (b/c I used salted butter); (3) 1 ts vanilla. The cookies come out best when I refrigerate the dough first (b/c of the butter). I've made these 3x now.

These cookies were delicious, however, I did make some changes that were suggested by the other reviewers. I added a half cup of flour, a half teaspoon of baking soda, and decreased the salt a little bit. I also baked them on 335 for 12 minutes. They turned out delicious.

These cookies are easy to make and absolutely delicious! I made this recipe exactly as written except for I baked the cookies for 11 minutes, then cooled them on the tray for 2 minutes before removing them to foil. The texture is perfect; slightly crispy on the outside with a chewy center. My son also loved them!

This recipe was not what I expected at all. I am a seasoned baker and I have never had cookies turn out this way. They were flat, wafer-thin and very unappealing! I am upset that I wasted my ingredients.

This recipe is excellent as written. I have these several times with PERFECT results each time! The cookies are PACKED with chocolate and they're very soft and moist.  I have used half butter and half butter-flavored shortening before. They turn out fine. Today, I used 1/4c butter and 3/4c butter-flavored shortening because that's what I had on hand.   I do add about a tsp vanilla and sometimes some cinnamon.   Today, I made the shortening substitution above, and also added 1 tsp vanilla, and used 1c semisweet chocolate chips and 1c peanut butter chips. I now have awesome chocolate/peanut-butter chip oatmeal cookies.   They'll be a hit at work tonight!   The 15min baking time works perfectly in my oven @ 350 deg.   Enjoy!

I have made these cookies at least three times now and have to say they are the best oatmeal chocolate chip cookie in existence... with modifications. I customize these to my personal preferences by using real butter, increase the oatmeal to 2 1/2 cups, and reduce the chips to 1 cup. I bake these for 10-12 minutes at 325F, and they come out crispy on the outside, chewy in the middle. Perfect! A solid five-star recipe when tweaked :)

I halved the recipe to 21 servings, added an extra cup of oats, added a tsp. of vanilla, and only had a little less than a cup of chocolate chips on hand. Still turned out great!

Yummy! Made with white chips rather than chocolate & added a little vanilla. So GOOD! I also have a newer oven (Whirlpool) Cooked @ 350 for 10 mins... turned out perfect.

Perfect!  Added 2 tsp vanilla and used butter instead of shortening.  Bake exactly for 15 minutes, they will harden up a bit while they cool.

Only 3 stars because they baked up so flat. The taste was pretty good but a little too oily and a little too much "shortening" taste.

Making the changes that others recommend (extra half cup to a cup of oatmeal), these cookies are phenomenal. If you are making small, tsp-portioned cookies, I would recommend checking them after 7-8 minutes, and/or baking them at 325 degrees F.

Since I did change it a bit I am not sure what the original cookies taste like but with my adjustments these are YUMMY!! My 2 yr old and I made these just for fun and they turned out great. Taking suggestions from previous reviews I only put in 1/2 tsp of salt and added 1 tsp of cinnamon along with 1 tsp of vanilla extract. Great for mama and kiddo recipe to do together and believe me the 7 dozen it does make won't last 2 days around here.

Giving it a 4 because after reading other people's reviews I made changes, too--added 2 tsp vanilla, an extra 1/2 c of oats, and halved the salt.  I also used dark chocolate chips to make them a little richer.  They're basically like the Tollhouse recipe with oats--nothing revolutionary, but still came out perfect & delicious!

I love chewy soft oatmeal cookies, and find that many of the recipes turn out more crunchy. I changed nothing and loved the cookies just the way that they were. I like to make smaller, more "bite-sized" cookies, so that way they cook more evenly and the edges don't get crispy before the center cooks. Will use this recipe again!

This cookie was great - although I made some changes to make it even better.  I kept the shortening the same, for no other reason than that was all I had on hand.  I did add 2 tsp of vanilla, because I love the taste.  I kept the 2 cups of oats, but changed the chocolate chips to milk chocolate and because they are sweeter, added only 1 cup.  I also add a 1/2 cup of toasted coconut and 1/2 toasted slivered almonds.  The cookies were light and airy on the edges and slightly chewy on the inside.  They were delicious!

I decided to use organic ingredients.  Used Turbinado sugar instead of the regular sugar.  Used 1/2 cup of organic unsalted butter and 1/2 cup of coconut oil.  Three cups of organic quick oats.  Also, purchased organic chocolate chip cookies.  Wonderful unique flavor....with the coconut oil (organic as well).  Oh, and used 1/2 teaspoon of himalayin salt.

I'm giving these only 3 stars because they are good basic cookies with a few flaws in the recipe. The baking time for most ovens should be much shorter--it took mine only 9 minutes. Also only 1/2 t salt is necessary, and adding 1 t vanilla really helps the flavor.   I also experimented with making them healthier, and it worked out very well. I subbed 3/4 c butter and 1/4 c nonfat vanilla yogurt for the shortening, cut the white sugar to 1/2 c, and subbed wheat flour for 1/2 cup of the white. They turned out great!

These were just okay.  Nothing to special about them. I did as some reviewers said. I used butter instead of shortening and also added vanilla.  They are soft and chewy but really lack in the taste department.  I really doubt I would make these cookies again

Good recipe, but mine took a little longer to cook. A little too much salt. I thought it was when I added it in, but I followed the recipe anyway. Now all I need is to figure out how to get them soft, they turned crunchy as they cooled.

Very good!! Not sure why it doesn't call for vanilla, but I did end up adding a few things.  Rate was based on unchanged recipe first. I added: 1/2 cup oat bran, 1/3 cup ground flax seed, 1 cup golden raisins, 1/2 cup walnuts, and reduced the chocolate chips to 1 cup instead of 2 cups.   They are crisp on the outside, and soft on the inside.  Perfect, and a little healthy stuff makes you not feel so bad about having just one more!

Delicious! They definitely did NOT need 15 minutes in the oven though - mine were done around the 9-10 minute mark. I took them out once the edges started to get really brown and they were *perfect* once they cooled. Nice and chewy the next day.    I also added in 1 generous tsp of vanilla after the eggs. Subbed butter for shortening and my cookies were not flat at all (butter never makes my cookies flat; perhaps people are softening it too much or using old baking powder). Used a mixture of chocolate chips and skor chips. Will make again for sure!

We thought these cookies were okay. There was nothing in particular wrong with them; they just weren't the best oatmeal chocolate chip cookies I've had. I made the "Soft Oatmeal Cookies" recipe from this website about a week later and those were incredible. Use that recipe and add chocolate chips for a delicious oatmeal chocolate chip cookie.

Wonderful cookies!  I used two teaspoon of vanilla flavoring an extra cup of rolled oats, and I used dark chocolate chips.  My kids could not stop eating them.  This will be a new regular in our  house.

I substituted butter for the shortening and my cookies really spread out and most of them fell apart. I'm sure this is my error, but it was disappointing to spend the time and end up with cookies I'm embarrassed to share. I used peanut butter chocolate swirled chips and they TASTE great, but look pretty rough.

Fantastic recipe. I used about a cup of chopped up high-cocoa dark chocolate instead of the 2 c. of choc chips, and added more oats to keep it a little healthier. Added chopped pecans as well. Probably the best home made cookies ever to come out of my kitchen, ever.

AMAZING!!!  My roommate was the one who discovered this recipe online and she makes it once a month. However, every time she makes it the rest of my apartmentmates eat it before I can... so I decided to make it myself.   There's no need to change the recipe, it's wonderful as it! Thanks :D

I used all shortening (last time I subbed in butter they spread very thin), quick cooking oats, and 1/2 tsp salt.  They are still a skoosh salty (but note I also don't regularly overly salt things).  Next time, I'll use 1/4 tsp salt in this recipe. The baking soda is salt enough, and activates off the brown sugar...so salt here is only for seasoning. Overall good cookie - crispy outside, chewy inside. They are not thick cookies, and I did bake them after sitting in the fridge for 2 hrs.  They settled once out of the oven, but any more baking and they would have been just all crispy.

Just whipped up a batch.  I also added 1 tsp of vanilla, and used 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 cup butter.  Delicious!!

Great cookies-like other reviewers I used 1cup salted butter and 1 cup of shortening. I also added 1 teaspoon of vanilla and cut the salt down to 1/2 teaspoon. Very tasty and chewy with a bit of a crunch on the edges!

These were great - I used butter instead of shortening and added 1 tsp of vanilla. I use a giant ice cream scoop to make them a uniform size, so it took about 20 minutes to bake.  They came out soft in the center and chewy around the edges.  YUM!

I thought these were pretty darn good. I don't usually make cookies with shortening. This time I had to, as I was out of the Olive oil spread I normally use. Out of brown sugar, too. So I combined a TBsp. molasses with 3/4 c. white sugar. My 'test' batch of cookies came out too done when baked for 15 minutes at 350 degrees. I baked the rest for 12 minutes and they came out great, even though they are flat as pancakes. Nice and chewy, however, I think these could benefit from more oats than called for. I also only had a handful of chocolate chips so they went in along with about half a cup of pitted prunes (that I chopped up in my mini blender.)I'm keeping this recipe for those times when I have no Olive oil spread (I hardly ever have real butter, either.) They are still moist on the second day, too. Thanks for this recipe.

These are delicious. I followed the others by adding 1 tsp of vanilla and only used 1 cup of chocolate chips.  I also reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup each of granulated and brown sugar and they are still plenty sweet.

My family and I agreed that these were the best cookies we'd ever had! I didn't give it a 5 because I changed a few things per the other reviews. I did 1/2c. butter and 1/2c. shortening, added 1tsp. vanilla and used dark chocolate chips. I also was short on time, so I baked them at 375 for 8 minutes. I'm also too lazy to grease cookie sheets so I didn't and they came out perfectly. Didn't stick at all and are nice and chewy.

I cut down on the sugar to 1 cup (there's as much sugar as there is flour in this recipe!) and substituted the shortening with butter at a 1-to-1 ratio.  It was still plenty sweet and the butter worked out great.  I rolled the dough into logs and refrigerated them before cutting them and baking them, so I didn't have the "flat cookie" problem another reviewer had who used butter instead of shortening.  Also, for one batch, I added a cup of raisins and it was delicious!  Will be making this with raisins from now on.

I followed the recipe almost exactly - only added a little vanilla (which I add to most baked goods).  The texture was perfect - nice and fat and puffy - chewy in the middle and crispy on the edges.  I think the Crisco is what helps them puff so much. They are VERY chocolaty - weight conscious could easily reduce chips to save calories and still have a very chocolaty treat!  I may try the butter flavor Crisco next time to get the flavor but keep the wonderful texture.  I noticed other reviews cut the amount of salt - these are a *little* on the salty side but I LOVE salty/sweet combo.  Makes a LOT of good-sized cookies!

These were awesome after changing it up some. I used 1/2 cup of shortening and 1/2 cup of butter, 1/2 tbl of vanilla, a dash of nutmeg, cinnamon, 1/2 cup of pecans and 1 cup of raisins. These are thick and very chewy, loved it!

These cookies taste delicious.  Even my 3 year old, who was skeptical about adding oatmeal, loved them.  I'm not sure why they turned out flatter than I would have liked.  Not sure where I went wrong.  They only thing that I changed was butter for shortening because I didn't have any shortening.

If I were going to make these again, I would increase the oats and add some vanilla.  I would also use half shortening and half butter.  As it is I think I'll just stick with one of my current recipes.

These cookies are okay... The only changes I made were to use butter flavored crisco, add 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon.  It's a flatter, crispier cookie.  Maybe should have cooked them for less time.

Perfect.  After years of searching, I finally found the perfect choc. chip cookie recipe.  This is my new signature.  BTW, I used butter and threw in a dash of cinnamon and vanilla.  Bake 10 minutes.

These didn't have much flavor. The texture was great...very soft and chewy cookie, but I think next time I'll try using butter for more flavor.

The taste of these were fantastic.  However, I did have to add about 1/2 cup more flour to get them to rise a bit higher, cause that's how I like them.  I also used butter in place of the shortening and added a touch of vanilla.  These were very buttery tasting and very crispy without breaking apart all over the place.  I also baked mine for quite a bit fewer minutes (9-10) but it may have been the size cookie I was making.  I think this is one of those "you can add anything to it" recipes - different chocolate chips, more or less sugar, different flavorings, etc.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Good basic cookie but a little too crispy. Added 1 tsp vanilla and cut oats to 1 1/2 cups. Next time will use butter or 1/2 butter 1/2 shortening to make them not as crisp and buttery.

5 stars with changes. I eliminated the white sugar, added cinnamon and vanilla. Only used 1/2 of the recommended butter and used cream cheese for the other half.  Used 3/4 of the chocolate chips.

I made these with my 4 & 5 year olds.  I used butter instead of shortening, added an extra cup of oats, added 2 cups of finely grated carrot, and substituted 1/2 cup of regular flour for whole wheat flour.  I made them teeny tiny so I can put a couple in their lunchboxes.  They came out amazing and I love that there's carrot in them!

The cooking time is WAYYYYYY too long.  I followed the recipe exactly other than grinding the rolled oats (not quick oats)only because my family doesn't like oatmeal cookies.  The first batch I cooked for 11 minutes and they were overdone, but still yummy.  For the next 2 batches, I added some vanilla and cooked for only 10 minutes.  I allowed the cookies to cool for 5 minutes on the baking sheet placed on a cooling rack, then removed to the cooling rack.  I made them to take to a friend's house for make your own cookie sundae's.  It is a shame to cover this delicious cookie with ice cream and toppings!  Will make again!

Just made this recipe tonight, and these cookies are absolutely delicious!  I did change the recipe a little because I didn't have shortening (and, to be frank, shortening kind of grosses me out), so I used softened salted butter instead, but I kept the other salt measurement (I don't mind my sweets a little salty... salt + chocolate = yum!).  I also added about a tsp of vanilla.  Baked at 350 for just a flash over 10 minutes and they're perfect.  Chewy with crisp edges, and not flat.  Yum!

Yum, Yum! I used butter for the shortening and added 1/4 less chocolate chips than suggested - and there was still a great chocolate taste. The oatmeal does add that chewy quality - well liked by all in my family.

I added a bit of vanilla as well, and did half choc. chips and half peanutbutter chips.  Good tasting cookies.  Cut bake time down to 11 minutes if you don't want crispy cookies.  Thanks for sharing!

This really is a great recipe. I did make one teeny tiny change, by adding 1 tsp of vanilla, and instead of using two cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips. I used one cup of semi-sweets and one cup of milk chocolate chips. I liked them so much that I ended up making two batches, one with walnuts and one without. Everyone loved these cookies and have been asking me to make more. Thank you Sheryl Juergensen!

Like other people, I added 1 tsp. of vanilla, along with the eggs.  The tsp. of water is very helpful if you find the mix too dry.  Otherwise, they are delicious and I have a hard time keeping them around.  My sister-in-law keeps them all to herself, not sharing with her husband or young son!

You know, I had trouble with these. The cookies flattened out a lot (despite that fact that I used shortening and not butter, as some people have done) and burned too easily on the bottoms. This may, however, have been because I have a small apartment stove. I ended up raising the cookies to an upper rack in the oven and using parchment paper. This resulted in a moderate improvement, but I'm still going to be looking for a recipe with a bit more flavor (and prettier presentation) to it.

Delicious! I made a few changes based on other reviews: Add 1/2 tsp. Cinnamon, Use 'butter flavor Crisco' shortening, Decrease Oats to 1 1/2 cups, and use only 1/2 tsp. Salt. Add 1 tsp. Vanilla extract. The 2 cups of Choc. Chips are a MUST! This is a fabulous classic cookie! The last batch I made I added some chopped pecans-Amazing! I am sure they are a great cookie to make 'As Is' in the recipe, but I'm glad I took the advice of others. This one is going in my Christmas Cookie List to make for the Holidays!

Great Cookie!! I read other reviews and decided to follow some advice and add 1 tsp vanilla. Along with that I added 1 tsp almond extract. I also decreased salt to 1/2 tsp. Instead of 2 cups of chocolate chips, I added 1 cup chocolate chips and 1 cup butterscotch chips. Unlike other cookies I have made, these did not fall flat-nice and chewy and not sunken looking. I think it is because of the shortening. My kids loved them. Will definately make again.

These cookies, as is, in my opinion get 4 stars. To make it a 5 star recipe - they need only 1 1/2 C chocolate chips (and I think overdoing chocolate is virtually impossible), replace half the shortening with butter to improve the flavor, add vanilla (a tsp or 2)to the egg mixture, and most importantly, should be baked within a few hours of eating (they'll be crisp on the outside and chewy inside - yum!). If you let these sit overnight, the texture completely changes and you end up with uniformly semi-soft cookie, neither chewy nor crisp.

This was a quick, easy and very tasty cookie.  I also made a couple of changes.  I cut shortening in half and added a 1/2 cup of butter.  I also added @ 1/2 cup more of oats and 2 tsp vanilla.  I tried the recipe out with 8 9 year olds and they devoured them.  They had no idea they could be remotely healthy!

Both my husband and I found this cookie to be too dry with zero chewiness, even though I did not put them in for full cooking time (only 10 min).  I followed the recipe exact, using all shortening and no butter despite what others had suggested.  If I were to try this recipe again, I would use butter instead for more chewiness.  The taste itself was good, but because of the texture and dryness, I give this recipe a low rating.  I would not try this recipe again.

Quite good! Didn't change the recipe at all. Crispy outside, yet chewy inside. I always assume I will get crispy outside when I use shortening. Oh, and I did use butter flavored shortening and for my first batch I used raisins (reconstituted with boiled water for moistness) instead of chocolate chips. I will try with chocolate chips next time, and there will be a next time that I will make these! Definately some tastey cookies!

I made this recipe exact, however I decided to change up the last few dozen. I bake some with oatmeal, others with peanut butter chips mixed in. The reason I did this was to add texture and some more flavor to the basic cookie dough.
 So far so good. The last batch just came out of the oven and I have sampled every different type. I personally like the ones I added peanut butter chips to. They are DELIOUS! Overall I would give this recipe a 4 star, simply because it was nothing over the top spectacular. Just a very good basic recipe.

i've been looking all over for a oatmeal chocolate chip recipe like this. it was amazing! 

however; i did use butter instead of shortening, two teaspoons vanilla (added right with the eggs), and an extra cup and a half of oatmeal as someone previously mentioned. & i also added a half cup of chopped walnuts with 1 cup of chocolate chips instead of the suggested amount.

i will definately be using this one again!

I don't make a lot of cookies, but these were easy and truly delicious. Per the instructions of other reviewers, I used half shortening and half butter, decreased the salt to 1/2 teaspoon, and added one teaspoon vanilla. I baked the first batch for eleven minutes, and the cookies were a tad too crispy for out tastes, so I baked consecutive batches for ten minutes, and they came out perfect, a bit crunchy on the edges and chewy in the middle. I cannot imagine baking them for fifteen minutes - they would have been burnt to a crisp. Next time I might try these with peanut butter chips. My picky toddler really liked them.

These cookies are fantastic. I have not baked cookies in years so when I offered to make cookies for a bake sale at school I chose your recipe. I did take other reviewers advice and used 1/2 cup buttered flavored shortening and 1/2 cup butter, as well as adding 1 tsp of vanilla. The only problem I had was saving them for the bake sale. Thank you for this delicious recipe.

This is a good recipe. I modified it a little bit to make it low-fat and safe for my toddler with soy and peanut allergies. I replaced equal amounts of organic all-natural applesauce for the shortening, and 1 cup raisins & 1 cup coconut for the 2 cups of chocolate chips. 
They came out sweet, fluffy and sooooo yummy. Next time I'll use 1/2 cup less sugar because of the natural sweetness of the sugar, though.

so far, this is my favorite recipe for chocolate chip cookies off this site and I've made the top rated ones. These were nice and thick yet still oatmealy enough. I did add a bit of vanilla (2 tsp.) extract only because I could not fathom making cookies without it. I don't like them when they are too bland.

This recipe ROCKS! Baked mine on parchment paper and came out PERFECT!!!

I also used 1/2 shortening & 1/2 mbutter (actually Country Crock). I think that made the difference in the crispyness but deliciousness of the cookie :) 

This one will SURELY go into the recipe box & passed on. 

Thank you!

I made these for my neighbors and they absolutely loved them!  I followed the recipe but cut down the baking time by about 3 minutes and was very pleased with the texture and taste.

Based on what I had on hand, I made a few modifications.  I used 1/3 cup butter and the rest shortening, only used 1/4 cup white sugar and the rest brown sugar, used a little over a cup of oatmeal and a teaspoon of vanilla and about 1/2 cup of mint chocolate chips.  This was a great recipe and I look forward to adding more oatmeal next time, but I wanted to give this recipe a try!  Cookies are soft and chewy.

I followed other reviewers advice and cut the sugar a little bit, as well as the chocolate chips and the oatmeal.  I think I would cut the sugar by half but keep the oatmeal and chocolate chips at the recommended amount.  Overall, a very good cookie, and the kids loved it!

very very good. I halfed the recipe but was still slightly short on butter so I added a little canola oil instead and they turned out awesome.

Tasty, crisp cookies!  I used butter instead of shortening.  I also took the advice of several reviewers and added 1 tsp vanilla, reduced the oatmeal and chocolate chips to 1-1/2 cups each, reduced the salt, and reduced the cooking time to 12 minutes.  Next time, I would probably further reduce the chocolate chips to 1 cup.

I thought these were delicious. My son loved them and he normally won't eat anything other than a chocolate chip cookie.  I used 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter.  They turned out thin, crispy and a slight bit chewy. Next time I will use bigger spoonfuls to make a chewier cookie.

I thought these were pretty good.  Since the recipe calls only for shortening, they came out more on the crisp side, and I prefer chewy.  I would have subbed half butter, half shortening, but I didn't have enough butter on hand.  If I make these again, I will definitly use some butter in them.  I also added some vanilla.  On a high note, I brought these to a church class tonight, and Father took 4 home with him.  I guess he doesn't mind a crisper cookie!

This cookie was great! I use very large tablespoon fulls because I like a soft chewy cookie and these turned out perfect.  Not to mention it was so simple.

I'll admit it, I made a few changes. I swapped out the chocolate chips for 1/2 cup fruit (chopped, dried cherries in my case) and 1/2 cup nuts (sliced almonds), and I also added 1 tsp. cinnamon, which really complemented the buttery flavor. Using Quaker instant oats and baking them for 16 to 17 minutes makes them crisper, but they still keep a somewhat chewy quality. Very delicious!

I have to say this is one of the best oatmeal cookies ever. I followed this recipe to the letter did not change a thing, I used crisco butter shortning. My wife even loved them and she doesn't like oatmeal cookies.

i wish i had read the reviews before making these. although good, they would be much more flavorful w/ half butter, half shortening and a tsp. or even 2 of vanilla. mine turned out pretty crispy - good, but i prefer a little chewier.

I used this recipe with the addition of 1 tsp of vanilla as a cookie cake recipe for a birthday party, I reduced the temp to 325, and baked for 30 minutes until a toothpick came out clean.  It was a hit, everyone loved it!

Maybe it was using butter / applesauce instead of shortening that did it, but these cookies were not very good.  The first batch was a gooey, flat mess that went straight to the trash.  I added about 1/2 cup more flour, about 1/3 cup more oats, and dash of cinnamon and nutmeg.  This improved the texture, but the taste was still rather bland and oaty. Don't know if I'll make this one again.

Excellent Basic Recipe- Thank you., I just took them out of the oven and they are delicious!! I made the following little changes: I put the oatmeal in the food processor and blended it until smooth--because my kids don't know they like oatmeal. I didn't have shortening so I used 3/4 c. margarine + 1/3C. applesauce and I used One Large Egg + one Egg white. I added 1 tsp. vanilla. I also didn't have enough chocolate chips on hand and used less than 1 cup--would have been better with the 2 cups per the recipe.

I made these this afternoon and they were awesome.  I didn't cook them as long (about 11 to 12 minutes).  They make a big batch... I got 48 (not counting the bit of dough I ate...not much but probably a cookie worth ...lol).  Enjoy

this recipe is simple and delicious!  Every time I make these cookies, people rave!  I occasionally like to mix it up a little by putting toffee chips, and adding cinnnamon, but they are prfection in their own right as well.  My favourite thing to bake!

these were good cookies, but I needed to add at least another 1/2 cup flour to keep them from spreading all thin and yucky.  However, after that extra flour, they were delicious

Add more oats! They taste better that way I think. I added about a cup extra, and didn't adjust the rest of the recipe.

This is my favorite cookie EVER!  The only things I changed is I substituted salted butter for the shortening, and added about 1/2 cup chopped pecans.  Also, I had to cook it only 10 minutes at 325.  The first batch was burned!  But that's probably my oven's fault.

Hands down the best cookie recipe at my house. I make at least 2 batches a month. I have added pecans, walnuts and raisins. Everyone in the family loves them!! I followed others advise and reduced the heat to 325* and flattened them with a fork. Thanks for such a yummy cookie!!!!

Cookie dough required an extra egg to cook right. Dough also needed to be frozen. Without these two tricks, the cookies were mushy and didn't hold together.

I didn't use as many chocolate chips as directed and I added a little vanilla after the eggs, but these cookies were a great hit with my boyfriend and kids.    It was difficult to keep them all out of the batter, so I knew it would be impossible to keep the cookies around after they had been cooked! It's simple and these cookies will get eaten!

Used chocolate chunks instead of chocolate chips.  Used only one cup.  Gave more of an oatmeal cookie with chocolate concentrated in part of the cookie.

I personally like my oatmeal cookies to have a little more texture. The rolled oats made for a fairly smooth cookie.  I will try with steel cut next time. 
Very tasty in any case.

Very good cookie.  Of course I made changes, most of which wouldn't affect the quality of the recipe on the whole.  I used butter instead of shortening but kept all quantities of ingredients the same.  I added a cup of dried cranberries to make my husband happy.  Since these were for his office cookie swap, I wanted them bigger than usual, so I used an ice-cream scoop to make big dough balls for big cookies.  I baked for 12 minutes,  sprinkled the top with  cinnamon-sugar mixture, then finished the 15 minute cook time.  I chilled the dough for 10 minutes before the first batch, then put the dough back into the fridge during cooking and cooling between bakes.  I ended up with 27 cookies.  They didn't get flat at all -- between chilling the dough and not using a hot baking pan, they maintained a suitable thickness, soft and chewy texture, and a "just right" sense.

The recipe is great and easy.  I followed it exactly.  Then for my personal taste I added two teaspoons of vanilla and about 1 1/2 cups of crushed pecans.  I give the original recipe and my additions 5 stars.

I use exactly the ingredients and proportions from the recipe except the recipe doesn’t specify old fashioned or quick, so I use quick. I use Spectrum organic shortening. I cook them in a good toaster oven with a cookie setting for 7 minutes at 330 degrees, convection. My family and all our friends are always asking me for more. It makes about 4 1/2 dozen cookies using a 1.2 Tbs portion #50 cookie scoop. I cook about a dozen, then scoop put the rest on parchment paper - 6 in a row, roll 'em up and twist the ends closed. I put those in a plastic bag and put them in the fridge (or freezer). Anytime we want cookies we take them out of the fridge, start pre-heating the oven, put the parchment paper down on a cookie sheet, separate the cookies, and bake right on the parchment. By the time the oven is pre-heated, the dough is warm enough to cook. They come out good as fresh. GREAT recipe! Thanks!

I will begin by admitting I listened to some of the other ratings and added 1/2 cup oats and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and vanilla. Also, I had a bag of milk chocolate and peanut butter chips. So I used them. However, I also must say they made beautiful cookies. This is a good baseline recipe. It was easy to follow and allowed for embellishment. If you follow this recipe you will get a good cookie. Cookies are hard but make beautiful dunkers with coffee or milk

I used all butter in place of the shortening and added pecans instead of chocolate chips. I also used old fashion oats. Everyone loved these cookies!

Super tasty cookies but they taste exactly like normal chocolate chip cookies. Not a bad thing at all because my family and I love chocolate chip cookies but if your looking for a strong oatmeal cookie maybe add more oats or try a different recipe. Really delicious and totally would recommend for a really great treat.

Made a crisp but chewy cookie. I used butter, with the thought that it would make a flat, crispy cookie, which is my husband's preferred type of cookie.  Or rather, I should say that I used a stick of butter and 1/2 cup applesauce, my usual sub in baked goods.  Divided the dough in half and added chopped pecans to half, and sprinkled extra nuts on top of these cookies so I could tell them apart from the non- nut ones.  :) These will be nice for our 4th of July picnic tomorrow!

Yummy! Gave 4 stars mainly because I thought the appearance was flat and not the most appealing, but taste and texture were great.

Thanks for this recipe, my late mom had this from the 1950's and I couldn't find it anywhere, in her recipes, 
the shorting works well, for crisper cookies and and the tsp of salt in a recipe this size is not that much
Yes hers had Vanilla and a bit a water
 thanks again, for posting this

Great recipe but I did change it a bit. I added butter instead of shortening. I did one batch that came out great but they were very very thin so I chilled the next batch for about 25-30 minutes and they turned out much better still a bit thin but very soft and chewy

Yum! I used white chocolate chips, and after reading reviews on how sticky the dough was I exchanged the oats and flour amounts around and refrigerated the dough prior to forming the cookies. Baked only 10-12 minutes and I had perfectly chewy cookies. Husband and friends rated these easily 5star, as did my 4yo (though any cookie is good in her books).

These were ok but not outstanding - followed the recipe exactly without any changes.  Very, very flat cookies!  Not that that makes it a bad cookie - it just seems like they are missing something - maybe some coconut, vanilla?  Not sure I would use this recipe again and will probably go back to my old standby recipe.  I had to bake them for about 17 minutes.  Took the first batch out after 13 minutes and they definitely could have used more oven time.

I used butter instead of shortening and added a tsp of vanilla. The first batch was pretty flat, so I added more flour and it turned out better. If you use butter, probably best to add another 1/3 cup of flour or so. I did some with chocolate chips and some with raisins. I added a dash of cinnamon to the raisin ones.

Fabulous!  I had to do butter and shortening because I didn't have enough of each on hand, and they turned off fantastic.  In fact, I was still short 2 T of butter, and you can't tell.  Perfectly crisp on the outside, but chewy and perfect on the inside.  Mine took 13 minutes, and yielded 3 dozen, not 7.

Love this recipe! I took the advice of others and added 2 teaspoons of vanilla and an extra 1/2 cup of oats, and subbed the shortening out for butter. I also add a cup of raisins along with the chocolate chips.

Pretty good; I added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of water. I do agree that the 1 tsp of salt is a bit too much; the cookies were slightly salty, but not to the point where you're grossed out. It's just a bit savory at the end after you swallow. Very chewy and delicious though; 10 minutes at 350 was enough in my oven. 

Remember to always chill your dough; I chilled it for about 15 minutes and they spread perfectly, not too thin.

Not a true review as I have not made it as written - sorry, Purists!  I did however make the changes that Elizra suggested, and they are amazing, moist cookies that taste incredible.  My new go-to oatmeal chocolate chip recipe.  Thank you, Sheryl (and Elizra)!

To the person who leaves out salt, baking soda needs salt or the cookies will be flat. Do not over mix or they will be flat. Shortening makes them crispy.
I cut out the white sugar, added another 1/2 cup oatmeal and use 1 cup whole wheat 1/2 cup white flour. Now they are a diabetic snack.

These were very tasty, however they are more chocolate chip cookies with some oats thrown in than oatmeal cookies.  I made them as written, just slightly less shortening (which was good because even with a little less they were quite oily), and slightly fewer chocolate chips (again good because even with the amount I added, about one and a quarter cups, the chocolate completely overwhelmed the oatmeal).  I did add some vanilla.  Although I prefer the taste of butter, in this recipe using shortening didn't diminish the flavor.  I baked on parchment paper which prevented the cookies from becoming as flat as some reviewers have complained of.  While these were not the oatmeal cookies I'd been hoping for, they were delicious cookies nonetheless.

This is my husband specialty for years, and then I found it on here!  It originally came from a restaurant in St. Louis, but don't remember which one.  The one thing that they did different was grind the oats into powder.  I did that today and left a few grains un-ground to keep it interesting. They turned out great!  They were not flat, and were in fact fluffy and a little chewy.  I agree with one reviewer that said to remove them a minute or two early.  I removed them a minute early and let them continue to cook on the counter in the pan.  Turned out perfect!  Great recipe, don't change a thing.

Yum! These are great with tea and this recipe makes a lot of cookies so you can freeze them for later. I used butter instead of shortening and milk chocolate chips instead of the semisweet.

Excellent cookies. I used half Crisco and half butter. Also added 1 tsp. vanilla and decreased salt.  Cookies were done in 8-9 minutes.  Let baked cookies sit on cookie sheet for a few minutes to firm up. Don't grease cookie sheet and the cookies won't 'flatten'.

Excellent cookies! I took the advice of a few other readers and used 1/2 shortening,1/2 butter. I also added 1 teaspoon vanilla & 1 teaspoon water. I baked at 350 for 8 minutes but I moved my oven rack up one from the usual postion ( 3rd row) I allowed them to sit on the cookie sheet for 1 minute and transferred to a rack.....Perfect. I got rave reviews!

These were so wonderful! I had no shortening, so used butter. Also, my kids don't like oatmeal, so I measure out the oatmeal and then turn it into a flour in my grinder. Only took 10 mins at 350 in a convection oven. I only wish I had thought about the butter being salted and I wouldn't have added the extra salt.

I used the shortening as the recipe states but as another user suggested added 1/2 c. oats, 1 tsp. vanilla, 1 tsp. cinnamon, and just a pinch of salt (instead of the amount called for on the recipe).  Also, the cooking time of 15 minutes would have been way too done, I only baked mine for 10-11 minutes.  Perfect and not flat at all.  Yum!

Super amazing! The first time I made these it was strange, the dough wouldn't stay together. It was crumbly but this time perfect. Even though last batch still tasted amazing. I added a touch more shortening this time so it's not dry! Awesome. Thanks!

Followed the recipe to a tee, just used unsalted butter for my preference, instead of shortening, which puts me off...If you take them out around 10 minutes, rather than 15, and let cool for the remaining 5 minutes on the tray, they are moist and delicious! And for all the people who say that they are too flat, get over it. Cookies are flat, cupcakes are puffy, if you don't like it, make a cupcake ;)

3/4 c unsalted butter, 1/4 c applesauce, 1/2 c packed brown sugar, 1/2 c white sugar, 2 eggs, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 1/2 c whole wheat flour, 1 tsp sea salt, 1 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp cinnamon, 2 1/2 c rolled oats, 1 c chocolate chips, 1/2 c walnuts (chopped). Combined in the usual order, baked at 350 for 12 minutes,  tasty! (: I used applesauce in place of some of the butter to cut down on fat and cholesterol; it also tends to make them a bit fluffier, and since it's sweet I don't need to use as much sugar.

I recently had to unexpectedly teach a high school pastry class and decided to bake these without ever doing it on my own first.  The kids were at first really reluctant to try their own creation based on the fact that they contained a "healthy" ingredient.  After they got past the fact that there was oats in them they gobbled them up!  They are awesome and I will forever now use this recipe in place of my standard Toll House one.  The only adjustment that I might try in the future is to use 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter. Love it!

Love this recipe. I tried for the first time months ago. My wife loved it so much. She regularly askes me to make more. The only difference I made to it was. I put half of the Chocolate chips asked for in the recipe.

I would have given this 5 stars but changed a few things myself.  I substituted butter for the shortening (my cookies turned out great...not flat at all like another review stated...) Added 2 tsp vanilla and an additional 1/2 cup of rolled oats.  I also cut the salt in half.  Great cookies!!

Absolutely fabulous! I loved the original recipe, but have tried it with a couple small variations as well. I substituted one cup of chocolate chips for walnut pieces, and that is the best way to go! I have also tried some fat substitutions but the result was not as good. This is well worth saving!

Excellent!  The changes I made:
1/2 shortening, 1/2 butter.
1/2 chocolate chips, 1/2 cinnamon chips
1 tsp vanilla
and a little shake of cinnamon into the mix!

They came out incredibly! Enjoy!

I used a hybrid as suggested: 1-1/2 c of oats, and 1 tsp vanilla.  I also added 1/2 c of dark cocoa to the flour, and used 1 c of raisins plus the chocolate chips (1-1/2 c).   Yummy!  Baked at 375 for 8 minutes.

ABSOLUTELY marvelous! I halved the recipe and changed it up a bit to meet our health needs...1/2c pure cane sugar and 1/4c agave nectar. Whole white wheat flour also muesli for the oatmeal. I added 1/4 cup walnuts for some crunch and butter instead of shortening. Fabulous!

Delicious!  Lighter and airier than my husband's grandma's recipe.  We used butter instead of shortening... next batch will have 1/2 pecan, 1/2 plain, instead of all plain!

Used Elizra's recommendation to substitute butter (salted) and vanilla. I then reduced the salt by 1/2 tsp. My first batch came out a little flat and then I added approximately an extra 2/3 cup of oatmeal to the next batch and the cookies came out fuller and chewier.

Recipe works very well at high altitude. Cookies were perfect after baking only 9 minutes on ungreased sheets.

Awesome recipe. Only a few changes, salted butter instead of shortening, therefore omitted the salt, reduced chocolate chips(used milk chocolate ones) to 1 1/2 cups, added 1/2 cup chopped, toasted walnuts, added 1 tsp vanilla and a 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Baked only 11-12 minutes.  Next time will try substutuing dried cranberries and walnuts or pecans for the chocolate chips.

My family's new favorite. I made these according to the recipe and did not change a thing, except I doubled it and found 13 mins. was sufficient enough for baking time. They taste great and were the perfect amount of crispy/chewy.

I used half butter, half shortening and reduced the oats and chocolate chips to 1 1/2 cups (as several others suggested doing).  I added two tsps of vanilla.  The first batch I made resulted in very thin cookies so I added some flour.  Otherwise, they tasted very good!

I found that the 15 was far too long, so I only baked them for 12 minutes. The second time I made them I added 1 tsp of vanilla and cut the oatmeal to 1 1/2 cups to make them a bit softer.  My four boys love them!

I wouldn't make these again. Cookies came out too flat and crusty. Had to turn the oven down and only cook for 10 minutes to keep them from burning.

These are awesome! I'm a novice baker and rely on the feedback of others to help prevent the devastation of a failed recipe. I took the advice and used 1/2cup butter/ 1/2 cup shortening, and added 2 teaspoons vanilla to the eggs. I wasn't sure whether to add additional oats or not based on previous feedback, so I added a modest 1/4 cup of oats to the 2 cups. I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon. They turned out perfectly!

AWESOME COOKIE! This is the best oatmeal chocolate chip cookie I have EVER tasted!   I changed it a tiny bit--added 1/2 more oats and 1 t. of vanilla.   I used tablespoon-sized cookie scoop and cooked them for 12 minutes at 350.

Excellent easy to make cookie.  My wife and I made half a batch and substituted butter for the shortening and they turned out great.  Currently my favorite cookie.  Perfect mix of crunchy and chewy. Enjoy.

I'm starting to think that all of our ovens can't all be this off...I would check your cookies at about 7 minutes because they start getting done VERY fast.  These were pretty good, personally 2 cups of chocolate chips is a little overwhelming so I would cut that back or do half chocolate chips, half raisins or nuts.  They also seem a little on the sweet side to me, but no one else complained, maybe I'm just picky.  Overall not a bad cookie, but definitely not the "best" oatmeal cookie I've ever had.  I did NOT add extra oats or substitute butter.

I made this recipe almost exactly as is. I substituted Butter Flavored shortening, used Semi Sweet Mini Chocolate Chips and use 1 1/4 cups of flour as I like a less floury tasting cookie - baked for 15 mins exactly in a 350 oven and they are the perfect balance of crispy, buttery outside, with a chewy, chocolately inside. Awesome!

I couldn't buy shortening where I am and used butter.  They turned out flat and chewy.  I chilled the dough but they still spread out too much and were too thin for my liking, nothing like the picture. Might have turned out better if I could have followed recipe to the letter.

Best cookie ever!!!!! Definately add at least 1/2 cup more oats, do not substitute butter for shortening( this just gives you a very flat cookie), add 1tsp. vanilla and make sure you mix the shortening, sugar and eggs for at least 3 to 4 minutes. I  made these minor changes but I will only use this recipe for oatmeal cookies from now on. Thanks for sharing Sheryl.

My daughter and her friend made these and we were very disappointed with the results.  To me these weren't even cookies because they were so spread out and flat. They did not rise at all.  I put in the 5 minute old fashioned oatmeal and 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  Maybe using the 1 minute kind would make a difference, but I believe there isn't enough flour.  These "cookies" smell and taste good, but I won't serve these to anyone but my family!

These by far were the best oatmeal cookies my family and I have ever had.  Did not have shortening so replaced it with butter and added 2 tsp. vanilla.  My son does not like cholocate chip so I used Ghirardelli Classic White Chips.  So good!

I used butter crisco and butter, but after only 9 min the first batch was done - if I would have left it the full 15 min they would be toast!  Will try chilling dough before and see if that helps.

Great cookie! Just as suggested I used 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 cup butter. I also added an extra 1/2 cup oatmeal. It turned out nice and crispy, so delicious! Thanks Sheryl!

I followed the recipe and added an extra 1/2 c of oats. They were flat and crunchy and lacked taste. I will not make these again!

This was wonderful. We don't use shortening, so I subbed lard. Also used 1 tsp vanilla and added an extra half cup of oats. Fantastic-- Finally found a keeper!

i used butter because i dont eat pig products and wasn't sure if  vegetable shortening was an acceptable substitute.  the cookies came out flat and really fell apart.  the oats didn't seem like they cooked enough either.  not sure i would try this recipe unless using crisco would produce the results that people are raving about :)

This recipe doesn't need another review, but I had to leave one since my family loved these cookies so much. They raved about them and ate every single last one in one day. (It was Thanksgiving, so that's allowed, I suppose!) They've been requested for Christmas already and I've been told they need to be a holiday tradition. And they're super easy to make.

I made this recipe a couple days ago and the overall outcome was pretty good. I did follow the recipe but I added half a teaspoon less of salt. I kept the flour the same but added chopped walnuts and toffee bits to decrease the runnier consistency other reviews mentioned. One last thing i added was half a teaspoon of baking powder to make the cookies less flat. Hope my version of these cookies will make yours more enjoyable :)

I printed this out on cookierecipe.com in 2000 and it instantly became my family's favorite cookie recipe. We have probably made this hundreds of times. You can go no wrong...with wheat flour or different types of shortening...it is the best! My grandmother even replaced her Nestle Toll House recipe with this one after decades of making that recipe. Totally recommend this!!!!!

After adding 1 teas. of vanilla, only 1 cup of chocolate chips instead of 2 and some chopped pecans, these cookies turned out fabulous. I used shortening like it calls for. They are chewy and very tasty. I am surprised at how many they made. These will become a staple in my house.

These were delicious.  They were easy to cook and they made a nice amount.  They would be great for a bake sale because they're very portable without crumbling.  I wouldn't replace the shortning with butter because your cookies won't be near as compact and they'd be more crumbly with butter.  Yummy

These cookies were super yummy!  I changed a few things though--so I won't give them a 5.  I used 1/2 shortning, 1/2 butter, added about a tsp of vanilla, added an extra cup of oats, and only used 1 cup of chocolate chips.  I thought they were plenty chocolate-y and had the perfect oat-y chewyness after 10 mins in the oven :)

I have been baking cookies for years and finally found that this is the best recipe for soft and chewy cookies. I changed one thing...I melted 1/2 margarine and 1/2 shortening in stead of 1 cup of shortening. THAT IS THE TRICK to these cookies. Seriously the best Choc chip cookie EVER!

Made recipe exactly as stated and didn't work out AT ALL.  The cookies spread and are completely inedible.  I don't think I've EVER had to throw out a batch of cookies before.

These are wonderful.  I'm sure butter or shortening is fine, but I followed the recipe and used shortening.  Only change I made was adding 2t vanilla.  These only need to cook (in my oven) about 10-11 min.

I thought these were really awesome,but I added about a teaspoon of cinnamon and a teaspoon of vanilla. I also cut the cooking down to 12 minutes and they turned out perfect,nice and soft!Left out chocolate chips too! Thanks for the recipe!! I will use this again and again.

These were just "ok" I followed exactly and I think next time I will add Vanilla as others suggested. Also, the Chocolate Chips (2 cups) over power the oatmeal taste, next time I will use less Chocolate Chips, 1 cup should be plenty.

A new favorite. Fabulous made with butter, thinner and more crisp. Also, a combination of shortening and butter works great, and it's great with butterscotch chips.

These cookies were the best!  The recipe was very easy and the cookies were very soft and chewy.  I added 1 tsp of vanilla and didn't add chocolate chips.  These cookies were great without nuts of chocolate chips.  Thanks for the recipe!

I too added a tsp. of vanilla and then used 2 sticks (1 cup) butter and 1 cup shortening (I doubled the recipe). I froze half of the batter, but the cookies I did bake turned out great. Note: I did not use a greased baking sheet, instead I used a silpat and they turned out great!

Well, I did like the taste and I thought they were really good. I did change things like adding 2 teaspoons of vanilla and 2 sticks of butter (1 cup) instead of shortening. I also cut down on the ammount of chocolate chips. Believe meh I llllooovvee chocolate, but then again what girl doesnt right? Well I poured in one cup and it looked like enough so I didnt put in a second cup, plus I was out of that bag and didn't want to open a new one. When I make cookies I chill the dough and then bake them and the stay thick and fluffy but these sank down and were thin. I love the taste and texture but wish they had stayed fluffy. Thanks :]

These were pretty good, but not a 5.  I did what others suggested, adding vanilla and I also used 1/2 marg and 1/2 shortning, because I didn't have enough shortning.  They were VERY sweet.  Sweeter than I generally like.  And I'm not so sure about the texture.  They also really stick to the pan, even my Pampered Chef that nothing sticks to! I'm not sure what I'd do different, but they need tweeking.

Make them "gluten free" and use "Spelt Flour" instead of all-purpose.  Still SOOO yummy!!!!  I also used 1 tsp of vanilla, like others suggested.  Great recipe!

They turned out great..  just soft and chewy enough, not hard as a rock.. Didn't have quite enough brown sugar, so added little extra regular sugar.. added some vanilla, baked at 350 for about 14 minutes.

They came out dry for me.  I thought that 2 cups of oats looked like too much and it was.  Use less oats.  2 cups of chips was too much also.  I used Splenda for the sugars, maybe that made the difference?  The mixture was dry and wouldn't mix together completely with the oats and chips.

Just wasn't the kinda cookie I was craving. I wanted nice thick cookies, these were on the thin side. Oh well, kids will eat them.

These are great cookies. I followed the recipe, except for adding some coconut in place of chocolate chips and adding a teaspoon or so of vanilla. They came out quite thin and dark, but the texture was really good. They almost reminded me of lattice cookies. I found 15 min to be a little too long, although they weren't burnt. I will definitely be making these again.

amazing! I didn't have any shortening, so instead I used half a cup of butter and a quarter cup of vegetable oil, and I also used 1 1/2 cups of all purpose flour and 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour, 2 1/2 cups of oats, and 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips. I added about a teaspoon of both vanilla and cinnamon as well just to give it a bit more flavor. Really good cookie and family loved it!

Yum! I had to use butter instead of shorting due to what was in my kitchen, I added 1 tsp vanilla and used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour in place of all-purpose flour.

A very yummy, chewy cookie. This is definately a 5 star with some revisions. I took some of the others suggestions and added a little bit of vanilla and cinamon. I also only baked them for 10 minutes and that worked out perfectly. :) Will make again with these subs. :)

I've made these several times since finding this recipe, and have not been disappointed!!!  They are amazing!!!

I typically use oil/applesauce instead of shortening, and need to add more flour.  Next time I'll try more oats as suggested by other users.

pretty awsome cookies!! I have been on a search for ones just like these. I used butter flavor crisco and only 1 1/2 cups oatmeal,only because i thought the dough would be too dry. other than that they were to die for!Thanks for the great recipe ;)

Good cookies. Used butter flavoured Crisco, added 1 extra cup of oatmeal. Not quite what I was looking for. Wanted soft and chewy. Also I would reduce the amount of shortening by about 1/4 cup.

Seriously!!!! THE best oatmeal chocolate chip cookie EVER!!!!! I did not alter the ingredients except that I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet--just a personal preference. I cut the cooking time to 10 minutes, but let them sit on the cookie sheet for another 3 minutes. They were perfect!!!!

This recipe needs way more oats...I followed the recipe to a T and they turned out flat as pancakes - I had to throw them away.  For the remaining batch, I added more oats and they turned out better.

Definitely an indulgence.  Were very good though!  Increased oats to three cups, added 2 tsp vanilla, and used 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white (just because my 1/4 cup measure was dirty and my 1 and 1/2 ones weren't!).  Also, got nervous they weren't going to flatten out so flattened the second batch while waiting for the first to come out - wasn't necessary!  I would reduce the salt next time round though.

I did modify the recipe.  Added 1t. of cinnamon and vanilla extract and 1/2c. of oats extra to the 2c. that it called for.  Decreased the salt to 1/2t. These were EXCELLENT!!!  My husband and I both love these....

I was really hoping these would turn out better.  I followed the recipe exactly and now I wish I had taken some of the other suggestions.  The cookies didn't turn out pretty.  They looked flat and greasy (they didn't taste greasy, by the way).  I think maybe the addition of some vanilla might help.  The flavor was really lacking.

I made these cookies last night and am somewhat disappointing.  I didn't have plain Crisco, but had the butter flavored.  I used it-which probably gave them a bit of flavor.  I also used 1-minute oats-not sure if that makes a difference or not-but it's all I've ever used in cookies.  The cookies came out very dry-and I could taste the grease in them (like they were fried).  I cooked them for 15 minutes, but added 2 minutes after checking, because my oven tends to under cook (so I have to do this with all cookies).  My husband liked them, and so did my kids, but they aren't terribly picky as long as it's a cookie.  I forgot about the recommendation to use vanilla, but will make a note for the future.  I will try again with butter next time and see how they work.  If this doesn't work, I'll stick with the recipe on the oatmeal box, because they always come out good.

Simply the best oatmeal chocolate chip cookie ever!!  I took others advise, added vanilla and 1/2 cup more of oatmeal.   Mine baked for about 12 minutes and left them on cookie sheet for 5-7 minutes. Delicious!!  Thanks so much for this recipe.  This definitely replaces my old oatmeal cookie recipe!!

Really good recipe with some of the modifications suggested.  I used half shortening and half butter (just b/c I only had 1 stick left), I also added about 1 tsp. vanilla and baked for about 10 min.  Reminds me a lot of the Nestle choc. chip recipe, but slightly healthier.

MMMMMM. I used butter and added a splash of vanilla, another handful of oats and half the chocolate chips! Lot's of changes but it's just the way I like my choc chip oatmeal cookies. I'm glad I found this recipe because it is a great starting point for oatmeal cookies. I will be adding this to my recipe box! Yummy!

Too much Crisco!!  Woah!  These were tasty, but I think they would've been better with more oatmeal, less crisco.  I followed the recipe exactly, which turned out to be a mistake.  Oh, well.  Still edible.

I followed some of the recommendations from earlier reviewers and used 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 of shortening, and added 1 tsp each of cinnamon and vanilla.  The batter tasted AMAZING, but the cookies spread so thin and flat that I couldn't even lift some of them off the cookie sheet without them falling apart.  I started by following some recommendations and baked them for 10 minutes, then took them out and left them on the tray for a few more minutes, but many of the cookies were still uncooked in the middle several minutes later.  I ended up putting them back in for a few more minutes of baking.  I will serve some of the less ugly cookies to my guests today and save the uglier ones for my family (they still taste fine!).  I guess I will have to keep looking for a dense, chewy cookie recipe.

Tasted pretty good.  Mine were crumbly, but it was probably my fault because my cups of oatmeal were generous.

These were good, but not great. My biggest problem is with the cook time...15 min. resulted in pretty crispy cookies, in my opinion. I ended up cooking mine at 10-11 min. and liked the results much better.

These are now my husband's very favorite cookies. They turn out chewy yet crisp...absolutely perfect! I made them at Christmas replacing half the chocolate chips with red and green m&m's. They were a huge hit at all the parties I brought them to.

Too flat and too greasy for my taste, I accredit it to too much butter and not enough oatmeal.  After two pans, I changed up the dough by adding more oatmeal and flour, the cookies looked a little better.  I will keep looking for the perfect oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipe.

My roommate and I love these cookies. But I started making them and realized that I didn't have baking soda, so apprehensively I substituted with baking powder and they turned out wonderfully. Very little and chewy.

These are dangerous to have around the house.  Although they are also a good way to get rid of all the oatmeal we brought!

I just made this recipe for the first time, and they were WONDERFUL. I had a niece staying with me who just loved them. I did add nuts, because I almost always add walnuts to my cookies. Thanks for the great recipe!

I added a splash of vanilla and only baked for 10 minutes. I ended up with only 4 1/2 dozen. But, they were delicious . . . crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside. Delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly, except I 1/2 it and I didn't have baking soda,so I used baking powder (more than I would've soda).  They were just OK.  I may try them again when I have baking soda in the house.

Well, I don't usually like oatmeal cookies, but because of all the rave reviews I decided to try this recipe.  Needless to say I am now an oatmeal cookie fan.  These were absolutely delightful!  I added 1 tsp. vanilla and used 3/4 cup shortening and 1/4 stick butter to help the cookies spread a bit better, but other than that, didn't change a thing!  Thank you for turning me into an oatmeal fan!!

These have become my new go-to oatmeal cookies!  I did use 1/2 margarine/butter and 1/2 shortening, added some cinnamon, and included 1 tsp. vanilla.  I also used white chocolate chips.  I baked them at 350 degrees for 12 minutes. Incredible!

Delicious!  Crispy on the outside but soft in the center-perfect.  THe only changes I made was to use unsalted butter in place of shortening, add a teaspoon of vanilla, and reduced the salt to 1/2 teaspoon, and a few dashes of cinnamon. I also did not need to grease the pans; they stuck a bit around the edges but a good metal spatula will pull them right up.  These did not spread much at all and taste great. Time was about 12 minutes at 350 degrees (325 was too low). I am curious to see how long they last........thanks for the excellent recipe, it will become part of my collection.

This is a great recipe!  I used salted butter and only 1/8 tsp of salt.  I also added a dash or two of cinnamon...just like the cookies at Potbelly's!

The flavor was outstanding, my husband and family really love them. The only downside was they turned out crumbly and wouldn't stay together. But it's still a recipe worth keeping!

Really good!  I split the recipe and did one half without the chocolate chips - which once I tasted one of the cookies with the chocolate chips - I regretted immediately

I love this recipe! I made it exactly following the directions, but for a different twist I used "reese's peanut butter chips" instead of the chocolate chips. These are so yummy!

We found this recipe to be very good. But I fixed it like the other woman did by doing half shorting and half butter and added the vanilla. We loved it! thanks

I'm really in trouble now! These cookies didn't last long in my house and once they were gone we had such withdrawls that I had to make another batch! They are delicious! The perfect mix of flavor, chew, and texture. I used half butter and half butter shortening instead of just shortening and added a teaspoon cinnamon. I added walnuts with the chips the first time and added pecans and coconut with the chips the next time. Both were a big success! I never thought I would find a recipe that beat my mothers....but I did. Thank you!!

I used all shortening (not butter/shortening) and it did two things. First, it made these cookies the most amazing homemade cookies in the world! and Second, made me feel REALLY guilty for eating so many!! All that shortening!! AAAACK!!!! 
These are amazing.

These turned out great! My only advice to others is to bake only 12 minutes and not to grease the cookie sheet. I don't know why it suggested it. It doesn't need it.

This is a great recipe. They come out nice and crispy if you bake them a little longer. Perfect for dunking. I have made them three times. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and they were very good, the second time I added 1 cup semi sweet chips, 1 cup white chocolate chips, and 1 cup of dried cranberries. The last time I used dried blueberries and white chocolate chips.

I've made these for my monthly swim team birthday celebration twice and everyone loves them.  My daughters love them too and they aren't much on oatmeal.  It's a great way to get some nutrition and fiber into them.  This recipe makes a lot and is great for a crowd.

They were edible, but not good. Too thick, too much oatmeal, WAY too sweet. Also thought they needed more choclate. Less sugar. I would not make again.

The cookie was really good except that it didn't taste like a real oatmeal cookie. The oatmeal wasn't prominent enough. I had a lot of people ask what kind of "nuts" were in them because it didn't taste like oatmeal. They all said they liked the cookies, its just not your typical oatmeal cookie if thats what you're looking for. Good oookie though.

These cookies were pretty good. The only problem with them was that I put half the shortening. I also only put half the butter. They were very crispy on the edges but gooey in the middle. Absolutely delicious. The only other change I made was I put 2 tsp. of vanilla in my recipe.

I lost my favorite recipe, so I was looking for one that was close...this was it!  I did add vanilla, cinnimon, and a little bit of lemon based on what was on my original recipe.  I also used butter flavored shortening, because that's what I had.  Anyway, these turned out soft and yummy. (I didn't put in the baking soda, because I didn't realize I was out of it.)  Anyway, this is a good recipe, and I recommend it to anyone.  The additions are also good.

Excellent recipe, I followed suggestions made by other people- added some vanilla, used butter instead of shortening, didn't cook as long as recipe called for.
Very easy to make and delicous!

This cookie was really good, but the cooking time was too long.  10 minutes was good for me.

I made these this morning and they were excellent!  I made them just as the recipe called for, and baked them for about 8 minutes - they were chewy and wonderful!  I did use "baker's" sugar which gave this a wonderful texture!  I'll be making these for years to come!

Cook for 7-9 minutes. Cookies don't expand very much when cooking. Froze half the batter and made cookies one week later - still tasted good.

These were delicious! I doubled the recipe, and instead of 1 1/2 cups each of brown and granulated sugar, I substituted 2 cups of brown sugar and 1 cup of granulated. I also used margarine instead of shortening. They turned out great. My family (especially my Dad, who doesn't usually like sweet things) really liked them. I think I will make these again!

Keep baking! ;o)

Not a very good taste. Very greasy tasting. They were better when I added some vanilla. Also I only cooked them for 9 minutes and the came out chewy.

I got rave reviews when I made these.  I froze most the dough and made it at a later time and those seemed to turn out better.  I also used unsalted butter instead of the shortning.

These used to be a favourite, but lately when I make them they don't hold their form. The end up flattening out. They're ok, but I used to make them so much better. I don't know what happened!

mine were absolutly awful! i think it was down to using gluten free flour which unfortunatly has the curse of making buscuits terribly crumbly and not at all gooey. They were clearly not cooked within 15 minutes and as a result of leaving them in for longer they were burnt and tasted awful. By looking at everyone elses comments i think this may have been down to me rather than the recipe though!

This recipe was quick and fantastically easy to do, but the cookies came out tasting wonderful.  The cooking time was perfect -- just be careful to leave enough space between the cookies, as they spread out quite a bit.  An inch and a half was not enough for mine. ;)

Only basic ingredients required and they taste wonderful.  I might add a teeny bit more moisture next time around because mine were a little too crumbly for my taste.  All in all, a great recipe that I will use over and over!

I found they turned out crispy and crunchy - not chewy at all.  Ok if you like a crispy biscuit, but I was looking for a something softer.  I would definately add some vanilla next time.  I forgot to add it and they were definately lacking.  Otherwise, not bad cookies.

These turned out soooo good.  I took other reviewers advice and added a 1sp. of vanilla and used 1/2 c. butter flavored shortening and 1/2 c. unsalted butter.  They flattened out a little thinner than I like so next time I will try just the shortening as written.  
Thanks for the great recipe!

I made these cookies and they turned out tasting good. They were a little lacking in flavor, but I think that could be altered by adding vanilla and a large amount of chocolate chips.

These are too flimsy and bake flat! They taste great, though, so consider adding extra flour (about a cup, for my 21- serving version)

This recipe didn't work for me. I did everything as instructed. Didn't change a thing. The first batch came out flat and totally stuck down to the cookie sheet..even though I greased. I can't say flat enough. Flat flat flat. I spread what was left of the dough into a square baking dish hoping to salvage the rest into squares. So far they look somewhat edible. I'll be scraping and soaking my cookie sheet for all eternity. :o(

My first batch came out a bit wet, but I think that is because I'm baking at over 4,000 ft above sea level. Anyway, I simply increased the baking time to almost 20 minutes - problem solved! A very delicious, chewy cookie.

Try this variation: add 1/2 cup of dried cranberries for a fruity twist. My friends were very happy with those!

Also, the dough keeps great in the fridge for a couple of days, so you don't need to bake them all at once.

Perfect mix between crispness and chewiness.  I added 1 tsp vanilla, used dark chocolate chunks and made 24 jumbo cookies.  Delicious!

This recipe was really easy to make.  I followed it exactly, except for using butter in place of shortening.  The cookies were golden brown after only 9 minutes, so I took them out while they were really soft and let them sit for 30 minutes before removing them from the cookie sheet.  The consistency of the cookie was perfect.  However, I used "chipit" chocolate chips, and I didn't like the taste at first.  I waited a couple of hours for the chips to totally cool and harden and tried another...OUT OF THIS WORLD!!

This is one tasty cookie! Added 1 tsp of vanilla and used 1.5 cups of oatmeal and choc chips each. Amazingly light and crispy cookies.

Used granola instead of oats - fabulous!  Came out thin and chewy, crispy on edge, like lace cookies. Use this one again & again!

My family loves this recipe!  Because of my the high altitude I added a little more flour and substituted half the shortening with butter for calorie sake.  These cookies don't last long in our home.

Instead of chocolate chips I added smarties instead (5 boxes) along with vanilla pudding mix which I had leftover from another cookie recipe. I'm guessing but it was around 1/4 of a cup...YUMMY!!!!

This was a GREAT recipe! I used Smart Balance instead of shortening and Altern (Wal-Mart's brand of splenda granular) instead of the white sugar and it turned out really good! Crispy on the outside, nice and chewy on the inside.
Thanks so much for sharing!

I bake cookies for friends and family constantly, and I'm always looking for a good, EASY recipe.  These turn out looking absolutely scrumptious, and they are delicious. I liked them so much, that I doubled the recipe, scooped portions on a baking dish, froze them, and stored them in the freezer for later.  YUMMY!

Just as it says "a delicious basic cookie". Baked according to directions but added a capful of vanilla. Only needed to bake for 11 minutes otherwise they would've burned(and my oven burns easily). Taste delicious. My kids love them(so do I)!

This turned out perfect. I'm always puzzled by other peoples comments on how theirs turned out runny or mushy. I can't see how if they followed the directions. I did lower the temp to 325 and added vanilla as suggested and my husband wanted to use Reeses chips so I subtituted one cup of choc chips with them. Delicious!  Thank you.

Wonderful cookie recipe!  I helped my nieces (ages 4 and 9) make these cookies and they turned out perfectly!  They looked and tasted so great that everyone thought they were store bought!  My new favorite recipe.  Take them out of the oven early if you like chewy cookies like me!

These are scrumptious cookies! Mmmmm! I recomend baking them at 325 and adding only 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips instead of 2 cups. If you put 2 cups in, the cookies will be too gooey! Also add 1 tsp of vanilla.

These cookies are very easy to make and delicious but, they are very dry. I added just enough milk to make them moist and cut back the baking time to between 9-10 minutes.

This is a very easy recipe that makes great cookies, even for a not very accomplished cookie baker like myself.  For the white sugar, I used half Splenda which worked just fine, and I omitted about 1/2 cup of the chocolate chips.  The cookies were very chocolaty and sweet.

Absolutly wonderful! Made for my mom and boyfriend( who is a very good cook) and they both raved about them!Instead of semi-sweet chocolate chips I added milk chocolate chips and it gave it a much sweeter taste, but still very good. If you like very sweet things milk chocolate chips are the way to go. This will definitely be my new favorite cookie recipe.

I realized, after scarfing down a few delicious cookies, that I forgot to add the white sugar.  They still turned out unbelievably well using only brown sugar and is fortuitously a lower calorie treat!  I will definitely make these again.

These cookies were too hard for my taste, but still were very good.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla after the eggs for more flavor, and halved the amount of oatmeal by necessity (I ran out...).  Everyone at work really enjoyed them!

Perfect, Awesome and Quick are the three words I would use to describe these cookies. Whenever I take these to any kind of gathering, they get gobbled up like there is no tomorrow!! I tripled the recipie and it was gone in three days!! This is the kind of recipie that you pass down generation to generation.

Very good Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies.  I liked these better as they have lots of rolled oats and a couple of eggs in the recipe.

These cookies are great. I did cut down the cooking time to 10-12 mins, I found 15 was too long. I also added a tablespoon of vanilla. Also, I only got about 5 doz. cookies not the stated 7 doz. MMMmm.. they were yummy!

My friend and I just made this recipe. We followed the directions exactly.  The batch we left in for the full 15 minutes were burned and very dry.  We had better luck when we took them out after 12 minutes, but they still left something to be desired.
