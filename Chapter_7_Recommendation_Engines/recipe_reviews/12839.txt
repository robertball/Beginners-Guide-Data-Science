Very good!  I doubled the pasta and garlic (8 oz. pasta is not enough for all the tomatoes called for, and the dish needed more flavor), and found that this dish really needed more shrimp (will use 2 lbs. next time).  I didn't add oil to the pasta while boiling (simply not necessary), and I used only 1/8 cup oil in the sauce to cut down on the fat.  Using fresh herbs is key!  If you add the shrimp in Step 2 as written, they will be extremely overcooked.  Add them to the finished sauce that is still simmering (along with 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/8 tsp. pepper), and they will cook in 2-3 minutes.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this the other night, and I must say it's the best dish I've made all year.  It was HEAVENLY.  I used lemon basil and parsley that I grew myself, and added around 1/4 cup of heavy cream and about 2 Tbsp. tomato paste to make a more creamy sauce.  I only used one 28 oz. can of tomatoes, and I think next time I'll use three 14 oz. cans.  I think I forgot to drain the tomatoes, so it took a bit longer to cook down, but the flavor was incredible.  This is an excellent dish for company, and it was just as good reheated the next day.  This recipe rocks, Pat!  Thanks for sharing.  :)

Pretty good but I have a question - I used 3(15oz)cans of Italian diced tomatoes. The instructions say that they s/b "drained" - but then when it comes time to add the white wine, it says to simmer until liquid is reduced by half.  What liquid? When drained and mixed together w/ the wine, there's barely any liquid to begin with. Yes, the tomatoes naturally release a little liquid but when they're drained, its not much.  In fact, I added half a can of tomato sauce just so the mix would cover the noodles properly. I understand that maybe this isn't supposed to be a "saucy" recipe but w/out some, it would be really dry. Next time, I'll try it but not drain all the tomatoes. It was still very tasty, which is why I feel the dish is justified to try again. Also, when sauting the garlic, I added a couple TBLS of minced onion and put parmesan over each serving.

Fantastic dish! I added a bit of extra garlic and some red pepper flakes and I left out the white wine because I didn't have any, but this was so good!!! I ate it until I couldn't eat any more, and the leftovers the next day had my coworkers drooling.

This was surprisingly good.  I only used 1 28 oz. can of tomatoes and that was plenty.  My husband is not a seafood lover and he said he'll eat this again!!!!  I forgot to add that I omitted the parsley and substituted fresh basil.

Well, I usually do not review recipes unless I find one that is really worthy of my time...this one takes the prize!  This recipe is sooooo good!!!  I used Bucatini instead of Angel Hair, and dried Basil for the fresh (couldn't get fresh here), everything else was the same and it was FANTASTIC!  Thanks!

So happy to be an experienced pasta a sauce cook and to also have read other reviews. My 3 stars is based on personal cooking knowledge of how this recipe and ingredients would have turned out had I followed directions. Hope my review is helpful for others because this recipe is not hopeless. 1: One can of tomatoes is more than enough. 2: For those who want more 'flavor' try using Fire Roasted Diced Tomatoes instead of Italian. 3: Saute the garlic (I doubled) in the  olive oil then add the tomatoes, white wine, parsley and use appropriate amount of dried basil instead of fresh 'or' add the fresh basil just before serving (fresh basil does not hold it's flavor during the cooking process). 4: Use cooked frozen and thawed shrimp (I used cocktail shrimp because that's what I had on hand) but, no matter what size cooked and frozen, do not add to the sauce to heat it until after the sauce has boiled down and just beofre adding the cooked, drained pasta. 5: Cook the pasta while the sauce is cooking down 6: Do not use the oil in the water and do not drain the pasta because the oil keeps the sauce from sticking to the pasta and the starch from not draining helps the sauce to stick to the pasta better.

This is an excellent shrimp dish!  I made half of this recipe last night for Hubs and me, but I went about it a little differently.  I began by sautéing the garlic in the oil (using only 1 T. of oil).  Then added the tomatoes, wine and parsley, and reduced it by about half.  I reserved the liquid from the can of tomatoes, mixed it with a little cornstarch and used it to thicken the sauce.  Then I added the raw shrimp and cooked them right in the sauce. I think this is much easier than fishing the shrimp out once cooked and then adding them back to reheat.  And since the flavor of basil diminishes as it’s cooked, I always add it at the very end.  I think next time I will add 1 T. of butter to the sauce to give it that wonderful silky smoothness.  I served this over bow tie pasta, but almost any pasta would work well.

This recipes is absolutely DELICIOUS and EASY! I also add a little frozen spinach towards the end (so it doesn't cook too long). As a tip, using the frozen or unfrozen raw deveined shrimp from the grocery store is easiest.  This has become my "specialty dish" amongst family & friends and I am by far a chef.

I thought these were good, but not THAT great, however, my family loved and raved about how wonderful it was, I had to make it again the next night!  I also used only one can of tomato and it yielded more than enough sauce and substituted chicken broth for the wine.  Thanks for sharing.

Very nice dish - fresh and light.  I used all ingredients to taste rather than measuring exactly, including using significantly less tomatoes than called for. (Most Italians, myself included, prefer their pasta, like their salads, VERY lightly dressed)  Also...adding olive oil to the cooking water is not recommended as it inhibits the sauce from clinging to the pasta.

I made this last night for dinner and my husband truly enjoyed it!  Instead of angel hair pasta, I used tri-color bowties and that was great and I followed the suggestions of the others by using one can of tomoatoes.  Definitly a keeper according to my husband!

This was OK (just OK...).  It was a bit bland and boring....  It called for WAY too many tomatoes.  The sauce did not adhere to the pasta.  The shrimp did not absorb the garlic flavor (very subtle) and had a somewhat "fishy" taste to them (first time this has ever happened to me).  I didn't really taste the  basil or parsley, so I don't know if buying fresh (which is much more expensive) is worth it.  This is a good "base" recipe.  If I ever make this dish again, I'll use HALF the amount of tomatoes called for (be sure to use Italian seasoned tomatoes...the dish is lacking flavor to begin with), maybe add some red pepper flakes to spice things up a bit, prepare with red wine (I like red better than white - it adds depth), serve over linguine instead of angel hair pasta (linguine noodles have more surface area to absorb the sauce) and maybe add scallops or sub chicken breast (even breaded breasts would work) for the shrimp.  Subbing chicken for shrimp reminds me of TGI Friday's chicken bruschetta pasta dish (which I DO like).  I also think that garlic bread would be a nice complement (I served my pasta with plain Italian bread - another bland flavor). We'll give this one more try - with my modifications.  Thanks!

Fast and easy. I used two cans of diced tomatoes. I agree with a previous review if I make this again i will not add the shrimp.

Wonderful!  Upon the recommendations of some other reviewers, I made a couple additions.  I threw in some hot red pepper flakes while the shrimp was cooking, and I added some tomato paste and heavy cream to the sauce.  I used fettuccine and the sauce clung wonderfully.  I also made some changes with regards to the basil.  Fresh basil doesn't like to be chopped too much, and it also is best left to be added later to a dish. I threw in some dried basil while the sauce was initially reducing to incorporate the flavor, but I didn't want to waste the fresh basil and have it turn black by heating it too early.  Instead I made some fresh basil ribbons that I threw in when I added the shrimp back in.  It worked perfectly.  This was wonderul and easy and I will definitely make it again.  My husband asked me to add it into our regular repertoire of meals.

To make this a little lower in calories, but equally tasty, I: 1) omitted the oil in the pasta (not necessary) 2) used whole wheat spaghetti (thicker is better: holds more sauce & flavor) 3) used 3 TBS of oil for the sauce 4) crushed rather than chopped the garlic to infuse the oil; browned it and removed it from the oil. 5) used one 28 oz can of organic whole tomatoes (tastier) liquid and all -- just crush it in the pan 6) omitted the wine (reduces calories & tastes better) The sauce takes about 20 minutes, so get your water boiling for the 11 minutes or so for al dente pasta.  Add the shrimp the last 3 minutes for, as someone mentioned, cooking them twice will make them rubbery. I also omitted the parsley because I don't think it tastes good in this sauce, and added instead a few TSP of crushed red pepper.  Dried or fresh basic works.   And I'd sprinkle the parmesan on top rather than stir it into the sauce.  It melts nicely into the hot sauce on the plate.

This was a good base sauce, but could use a little *umph*.  I added sauteed mushrooms and spinach to give it a little more substance.  Also, be careful not to add the shrimp until the very end, they get kind of tough if overcooked.

WOW... this is one of the best things that has ever come out of my kitchen!  I kid you not!!!  This was absolutely delicious!  Some minor variations:  I tripled the garlic and a little more wine (I used cooking wine) COULD be used, but not necessary.  I did use 2 -14 oz cans of diced tomatos (for 2 people)... it was enough but next time I might use 3 cans, for more leftovers.  For 4 people I'd def use 4 - 14 oz cans.  A DEFINITE WINNER!!!  Thanks Pat!

Really good and very easy.  Here are a few things that would make it even better:  Use 2lbs of shrimp and don't cook the shrimp as stated in step 2 - cook it in the sauce for about 5 minutes after the sauce has simmered for 8-12 mins (if you do it the other way, it will be overcooked).  Also, cook the pasta towards the end, not at the beginning (or it will cool down too much). Overall, a fabulous recipe!   *Added note: Don't double the amount of pasta as recommended by another reviewer - it's WAY too much!*

Terrific, quick and easy recipe.  Made only minor changes - I forgot to drain the tomatoes so the sauce took longer to boil down but after reading the other reviews it sounds like this was a good accident.  Increased the fresh basil and sneaked a little fresh chopped spinach in with the herbs (my family members think they don't like spinach - HA!).  To avoid overcooking some of the ingredients I layered everything as it was cooked in a deep covered casserole to keep warm - pasta, then the shrimp, last poured the sauce over all.  Don't reheat the shrimp in the sauce as they'll be overcooked.  Also add the fresh herbs during the last 2 minutes of cooking to retain more flavor.

My husband and I really enjoyed this incredible dish! Though, I have to mention that I didn't have white wine, so I substituted it with red wine. The next time I used white, and I will most definitely use RED instead.

This is a great base recipe. To add depth of flavor, before sauteeing the garlic, I lightly seasoned the shrimp with a Mediterranean seasoning. I used nearly 3 times the amount of fresh garlic and sautéed it in olive oil that had been infused with red pepper flakes (can be found in specialty stores or you can make your own by pouring good olive oil over a generous amount of red pepper flakes in a glass cruet and letting it sit). I believe the recipe imparts more flavor by following the steps and simmering the wine/herb/tomato mixture separately from the shrimp but for a longer time than directed by the recipe. I used 2 times the amount of wine, 2 drained 14.5 oz cans of Italian diced tomatoes and 1 undrained 14.5 oz can, fresh basil and parsley. Very nice, especially with crusty Italian bread, a salad and wine.

Wonderful recipe!! My husband really enjoyed it. For extra flavor, season the noddles seperately before serving. We season almost every noodle dish with butter, salt, pepper, Accent seasoning and sometimes garlic salt. It makes a huge difference in a lot of pasta meals ^_^

I didn't think this was great.  It was ok at best.  The sauce was watery and it didn't have very much flavor.  I was disappointed because of the high reviews.  Hubby didn't like it too much either...and he eats almost anything.  Don't think I will be trying this one again.  Thanks for the post, anyways.

This was awesome!  I did as a few others suggested and added a cup of heavy whipping cream. I didn't have any cooking wine, so I used chicken broth, and only 1 can of diced tomatoes.  I added the cooked pasta to the shrimp and mixed it all together...delish!

I didn't think there was anything special about this recipe.  It was just a lot tomatoes with pasta.

disappointing...even with extra spices, garlic, half tomatoes etc.  You are better off saving  the shrimp for something else and switching to a good red clam sauce.

Highly recommended.  This is one of my favorite recipes.  I've added it to my recipe collection and have made it quite a few times.  I always get a great review and many have asked for the recipe.  It is really fool proof and comes out great every time.  If I need to cut the prep time in half, I use ready cooked frozen shrimp (thaw them and add them to heat in the sauce at the tail end) and dried herbs (half the amount for dried herbs).  This makes for a great quick gourmet meal.

I halved this recipe for my husband, 2 year old and myself.  It made just the right amount.  I should have read the entire recipe before I started.  Next time I won't cook the noodles first.  It could be done while you're waiting for the sauce to thicken.  Doing it the way it's written makes it take so much longer to get the meal on the table.  Good taste overall!

This was good, but not saucy enough for my husband.  I drained the tomatoes too well.  The sauce was bland, the shrimp was delicious.  I put a bit of dried chilies and added more garlic.  Maybe some tomatoe puree or even cream like other reviews said.

I used 4 cloves of garlic and only one can of 28 ounce cans Italian-style diced tomatoes.  I did not drain the tomatoes..... I just cooked them down.

We LOVED this recipe!  It was yummy and one of the best dishes I ever had.  I squeezed a bit of lemon in and added a dash of crushed red pepper.  I would serve this to guests in a heartbeat.  Polished!

This dish had lots of good flavor and was a nice change from cream or alfredo sauce shrimp pasta. Since I only like a slight wine flavor to my food I cooked the wine with the shrimp and just a drizzle of olive oil and the garlic, let the sauce reduce to my tastes, and then added the tomatoes and seasonings. I also didn't drain the tomatoes then, to make up for the liquid. Thanks for sharing!

Wow! This was fantastic. I didn't change a thing. I made my own pasta, so it took a little longer to prepare, but it was worth the wait. Cooking the garlic with the shrimp before adding the other incredients allowed the shrimp to absorb some of the garlic flavor, but the garlic taste was not overly strong. Add a salad and the rest of the wine (i used Beringer Sauvignon Blanc) and you have a winner. Definitely a good date recipe for us bachelor's to put in the arsenal.

This recipe had great flavor and was very easy to prepare.  Based on the suggestion from others I used half the suggested amount of tomatoes and used 1/4 a cup of heavy cream.  To add a bit more flavor I used garlic flavored olive oil to saute the shrimp and added a bit more to the sauce.  Will definitely make again.

This is very good! I misread the recipe and added just one 28-oz can of tomatoes, and after having prepared the dish, I can't imagine having used two... I think it would be too liquid of a topping. I also used linguini instead of angel hair pasta, and I undercooked the shrimps so that when I returned them to the pan and tossed them with the sauce, they'd continue cooking and be overdone or chewy. It turned out wonderfully, and I'll definitely make this again!

I will definatly be making this dish again & again!!!  My husband LOVED it, and was very impressed with this dish!!  Even my 5 year old liked it.  I didn't use wine either, and I also used the frozen shrimp.  I added a little corn starch to thicken the sauce a bit.  I served it with breadsticks---thanks for sharing this recipe!!!!

I've tried this recipe twice now and I really like.  The only changes I think it needs is a little less tomatoes and to include the tomato liquid inside the can.  Without the liquid, it's a little on the dry side and the liquid actually helps form a nice thin sauce to go on top of the pasta.  It's delicious with the freshly grated parmesean cheese on top.

Great flavor...the fresh basil gives it a nice bright taste. Only comment I would make is to skip the olive oil in the pasta cooking water. Adding oil to the pasta prevents the tomato from clinging to the pasta after it is cooked. I drizzled a bit of extra virgin OO to the finished plate along with a bit of finely minced basil.

Just used 3 14.5 oz diced tomatoes (two Italian style and 1 garlic and onion) and doubled the amount of garlic.  This recipe is absolutely delicious!!  Fresh basil is a must.

Looked good but nobody liked in our house.  It was just too many tomatoes and the sauce did not really hold well on the noodles.  We also did not think that it had a lot of flavor.  Probabaly would not make again.  Sorry

We used precooked shrimp, so I cooked up the sauce and just added the shrimp at the end so they would get warmed up and not tough or chewy.  The sauce thickened up nicely when I made it, and I added a little more wine than the recipe called for because it was thickening too quickly, before the pasta was ready.

Everyone loved this recipe! I doubled the pasta and tripled the shrimp and wine. Since I'm not a big fan of pasta, this seemed overkill on the tomato flavor for me, but my guests loved it, so I'm giving it a 4. I grated 3T of Reggiano over EACH serving. YUM. Thanks Pat.

We thought this dish was very good,there are only 2 of us so I scaled the recipe down to 4 & we had enough for leftovers which were very tasty. I added a little extra garlic & half a can of tomato paste as another reader had suggested, just didn't want to chance it being watery, it was really good, I would say restaurant quality or better & very easy.

EXCELLENT!!  Will definitely use again.  Only used 14 ounce can of diced tomatoes and it still turned out great.  Timing was perfect but I used frozen shrimp that was already cleaned and deveined.  Thanks for the recipe!

Be sure to use a 12 inch skillet to prepare the sauce. It's a lot of liquid and can get sloppy in anything smaller. Also, even if your a cheese lover like I am- stick to the recipe and sprinkle extra on top of meal once it's prepared. I rated it as 4 stars only because it seemed a little too herby for my liking.

I was very disappointed when I made this.  It turned out to be very watery, and the sauce did not compliment the pasta very well.  I wouldn't make this again.

Loved the recipe.  What I did to make it a little simpler was to use frozen steamed shrimp.  This saves the time of deveining and cleaning.

I made this recipe for the second time this weekend and LOVED it. It is fabulous. This is my new favorite pasta. My fiance asked if we could make this every week. I added some heavy cream (1/4 pint) and some tomato paste to make it richer and creamier. The sauce is fantastic. I also added a bit of red pepper to counter the sweetness. The first time I made this my finance insisted that we sould get the shrimp steamed and with spicy cajun seasoning. I couldn't talk sense into him. What's the point if you are adding them to a dish? Well, he understands now and agrees that we won't do that again(sometimes they just have to learn for themselves). :) Wonderful. I can't wait to make this again.

Very Tasty - used only 28 oz of tomatoes as recommended by previous reviewers and added an additional tsp of garlic with a dash of red pepper.

I have been making this dish for a year now and it is one of our favorites. I start with a pound of cleaned raw shrimp and saute this in the garlic (about 4 minced cloves) and olive oil for about 5 minutes. Don't overcook. Take it out of the pan and then add other ingredients. I only use two 14.5 oz. cans of Hunts petite diced tomatoes (plain or with mushrooms--not seasoned). I like it wih the angel hair pasta. I also like using Holland House white cooking wine. It really makes a difference. The shrimp is added to the sauce at the very end for only a minute or two so it doesn't get overcooked and rubbery. I add shredded parmesan cheese at the table. Thanks Pat for a wonderful recipe!!!

Lacked flavor.  WAY too much olive oil to cook shrimp. Use 2 tbs of oil to sautee garlic then add 1/2C warer to cook shrimp to reduce fat. Also had to add more garlic. Even added spicy steamed shirmp to give a kick which was good.  A 10" skillet is NOT enough room to add all ingred. without it splattering everywhere and this is not a dish to cover during cooking since a reduction in sauce is required.

Had to search quickly for a main dish because I hadn't gone to the grocery store!
I was able to plug in a few ingrediesnts I had on hand and this recipe was one that popped up.
It was light and tasty! Love the white wine in it! I'll most definately be making this again! 
I only had Kraft parmesan from the shaker but this didh would be even better with fresh-grated parm. Don't skip this part!

Made this last night it was excellent! I took a few reviewers suggestions and left in some tomato juice from the can. I also added a little bit of heavy whipping cream to make a creamier sauce.  I added some canned clams (but would prefer baby clams) and some mushrooms-yummy! Next time I would also want to add a little crab-for a whole seafood extravaganza! Was easy to make, looking forward to the leftovers.

I followed this recipe with only one exception. I used 1.5 lb shrimp. The dish is fresh and light and worked nicely with whole wheat pasta. 
The kids won't beg for this but they'll eat and not complain!

I really enjoyed this one!  I didn't have fresh basil, so I used dried but it was still delish!  Thanks for a good spin on pasta with marinara!  Will be a new go to! *EDIT* I have made this several times and decided to switch it up a bit, I added about 1/3 of an 8oz jar sun dried tomatoes cut up and fresh spinach.  These two added a whole new dimension to this dish!  I would strongly recommend giving it a try!

This was without a doubt a fabulous dish. I doubled the pasta, doubled the shrimp, added fresh mushrooms and tripled the garlic. All my guests loved it and went back for seconds. This is a keeper.

This was really good. I did tweak it a bit to make it a bit spicy and I am not a fan of angel hair so the second time I made it I used penne pasta and that was so much better. I did post my additions to the recipe if you like spicy you should try it

Definitely enjoyed this pasta dish.  However tweaked the ingredients. I added a tablespoon of butter to the olive oil before cooking the shrimp for additional flavor.  Also increased the amount of garlic, since we a huge garlic lovers.  I could only find diced tomatoes with "herbs and spices"and since they seemed to lack much flavor added in additional basil and parsley.  Next time will add some oregano.  Thanks for the great recipe, will certainly make again.

3 1/2 stars. It just seemed to me like homemade pasta sauce. I used medium fresh shrimp added at the end. Added another 2 tsps. of garlic and another 1/4 cup of white wine... but still nothing special to me. I'll be trying other pasta and shrimp recipes.

This is a good recipe but it needed some adjustment.  Like others, 28oz of tomatoes were plenty. I made an additional batch of sauce because I had leftovers.  I used pre-cooked shrimp and added it at the very end (after simmering the sauce).  Heat the shrimp through (approx 5 min) then add the cooked pasta.  Very nice and the leftovers can be frozen. How convenient! Thanks NJMOM, I needed another recipe for Shrimp!

This was the BEST dish I have ever made!! You must use the fresh ingredients. I used alot more than called for. I would say almost 3tbs of fresh basil and almost 1/2 cup of parsley. Also way more garlic. I added the heavy cream as suggested and must say you HAVE to add this. It made a huge difference. I too only used one can of tomatoes, two would have been too acidic. I used already cooked frozen shrimp and just added them at the end to warm. So I just cooked the garlic in a small amount of oil then started cooking the sacuce. I also tossed the noodles with the sauce before serving. YUM YUM YUM. Will be making this lots of more times! THANKS.

As written, this recipe is 4 stars. I doubled the pasta (to 1 lb.) and the shrimp (to 2 lbs.) and halved the tomatoes (to one 28-oz. can) and added a little salt, and it was really good! (Even my shrimp-hater liked it!) I think that with about 1/2 cup of cream it would be even better! Make sure you have PLENTY of fresh Parmesan, too (not the powdered stuff) to really make it special.  Also, don't add the shrimp in the middle and then remove them and put them back. Just put them in at the end and cook for 3-4 minutes.

This is an absolute wonderful recipe with some tweaks.  I made this for a function at church - a women's banquet.  I tripled the recipe and made some changes.  I used extra garlic, parsley, and basil - even after tripling.  I used 3 bags of frozen large uncooked shrimp, not quite so many canned tomatoes - I believe I used 4 cans even after tripling, omitted the dry wine (didn't have any), added some chopped roma tomatoes, fresh mushrooms, and added some heavy whipping cream (2 small containers).  I grated some fresh parmesan for the top.  The dish looked so ellegent and everyone raved about it.  I've got to make it again this Saturday night for a pastor's conference.  I am going to do one LARGE dish with shrimp, and the other one with chicken.  YUMMY!!!!!

Followed the recipe exactly except I tripled the amount of garlic and added scallops and mussels for a VERY seafood-laden dish. The sauce itself was bland...everyone in my family kept adding salt to their plates. Next time, I will probably add more garlic, salt, sugar, pepper, and Italian seasoning.

Have made this numerous times... I chop fresh roma tomatoes (rather than canned) and add extra basil. Grate fresh parmesan cheese ( I use a potato peeler... the extra thickness of the cheese really adds flavor..) on top as well as including it in the sauce. Great easy company dinner!  Update: I had about 1/3# of fresh asparagus to use up and chopped it into 2" pieces and steamed till just tender and added to the recipe... excellent!!

My fiance loved this recipe, but I wasnt as impressed. It's much better than what I usually make for a scampi so that's why this gets four stars. The garlic that the recipe calls for is NOT enough for the entire dish. If your looking for a tomato-y garlic-y scampi, this isn't it as written. I would recommend adding at least another teaspon (if not more) as you reduce the tomato, wine, basil mixture. The taste is just about right otherwise and I did not have other reviewers problem with getting the sauce to stick, although I did NOT use the olive oil in the water. I really liked the chunky tomatoes and smooth, wine tasting sauce otherwise. My kitchen smelled very much like a good italian restaurant!! It would have been perfect with that extra garlic, otherwise. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe as a novice and it tasted like a chef prepared it!  So easy and will make it over and over again. Used a can of chopped tomatoes that had garlic, basil and oregano in it and eliminated the fresh garlic and it was still GREAT! Thanks for sharing.

DELICIOUS! Everyone in my house loved this, even my children, who don't even like shrimp!

As always, the readers reviews helped me to make a good recipe even better!

I followed the recipe with a few modifications: I used Linguine, instead of Angel Hair pasta; 1 large bulb of garlic; 1 small onion; 2 small cans of mushrooms; 1 small can of tomato paste and instead of white wine, I used a half pint of heavy cream. I also added more parsley and basil to flavor to my liking.

This was great and I'll definitely make it again soon!

This was delicious! Next time I will not drain the stewed tomatoes so that it will not be as thick. It got rave reviews at my house!

I can't count how many times we've made this recipe.  My husband had a similar dish at a restaurant, came home and described it to me and asked if I could find that recipe.  Well this one is the closest we've come, and has become a household favorite.  My husband makes it most of the time, and I refer to it as "his specialty".  We use fresh tomatoes instead of the canned - love the fresh vegetables and spices.  YOU MUST use fresh basil and parsley for full flavor!  We use about 6 large roma tomatoes to keep with the fresh ingredients.  Never hurts to add a little more garlic either  :-)

Very good.  Simple, easy, tasty.  I followed others' suggestions and used mostly dried herbs, with a bit of fresh at the end.  Red instead of white wine.  Added heavy cream--an excellent addition.

GREAT RECIPE, I READ A FEW REVIEWS SAYING THE SAUCE DOESNT STICK, WELL THE TRICK IS NOT TO USE OIL IN THE WATER WITH THE PASTA. TRY ADDING 2 CUPS HEAVY WHIPPING CREAM, CRUSHED RED PEPPER AND SEASON THE SHRIMP WITH BLACK PEPPER, BASIL, AND GARLIC POWDER.

This is so unbelievably amazing!  It tastes more like something at a fine Italian restaurant.  I increased the pasta to 1 lb as suggested before and switched to linguini because the sauce clings to it better while keeping the sauce the same amount.

This was a great recipe. My boyfriend raved about it and I liked it too. It was very fresh! The only reason it does not get 5 stars is because I honestly dont think I will make it again. It tasted great but not really that memorable for me.

Great recipe!  My whole family loved it kids included.  I add a bit more garlic though.  Make sure you reduce it well before adding the shrimp back in.  Will definatly make this one again!

Amazing recipe and so easy to make, especially since we use mostly organic ingredients when cooking!  I didn't even have fresh parsely or basil (I used dried seasoning instead), and I added baby scallops, fresh sliced mushrooms and zucchini and a bit of pasta sauce and it still turned out great.  Next time I will definitely use fresh herbs and I'm sure it will taste even better!

You really can't go wrong with this recipe!  I used bow tie pasta and it was such a pretty dish.  The key is using a white wine that you like...if it doesn't taste good to drink, you wont like it in the recipe.  I also cut back on the Olive Oil, and added some baby scallops.  It was perfect!

This could very well be the best shrimp pasta I have ever made and maybe even tasted!  Everyone, including the kids, really loved it.  I served it with a salad and italian bread with an olive oil dip (1/4 C olive oil, 2 cloves garlic minced. medium heat until garlic is almost browning. remove garlic, add 1tbsp italian seasoning, warm until serving-no shorter than 10mins).  I didn't do a thing to change this recipe, it was perfect as it came.  Thank you for sharing!

This was a really good recipe, the sauce was especially good.  We marinaded the shrimp first in olive oil, oregano, garlic, and red pepper.  This provided a greater flavor in the shrimp.  We also used a can of tomato paste in the sauce.

Have made this several times now.  It's a family favorite.  I do think there is a misprint in the recipe.  Probably should read 2(14 oz) cans diced tomatoes, which equals 28 oz. total.  This is plenty.  I always skip the wine, but it's still delicious without.

Tried this one tonight, as I was in a hurry and wanted something quick and easy.  I made the recipe for two of us, wanting one serving of leftovers.  I used one 28oz can of diced tomatoes undrained, and added one (all I had) fresh tomato.  With the wine and a 1/4 cup of the pasta liquid, I had plenty of sauce for 3/4 lb. of pasta.  Didn't have enough shrimp, so I used a combo of frozen pre-cooked shrimp and bay (tiny) scallops.  Contrary to another review, the scallops were GREAT in this dish.  They absorbed the light sauce and turned out WONDERFULLY - didn't break apart.  I do recommend waiting to add any frozen or pre-cooked shellfish after the sauce has reduced, to avoid overcooking.  I used linguine instead of angel hair - worked very well.  Definitely use fresh basil and parmesan/romano if you can.  Can't imagine the dish being as good without them.

My husband enjoyed this dish, as well.  Kids actually liked it too!  Will try this one again!

This was very good, I used 3-14oz cans of diced Italian tomatoes and I think it was just right. FRESH parsley and basil are a must. I added some sliced mushrooms. I also added some fresh scallops, but I think their delicate flavor got lost, won't do that again. I will try this with fettucini next time. I think the flavor is bold enough for it.  I used precleaned and deveined shrimp which made this quick dish even quicker. My only regret is that I did not have FRESH parmesan. Thanks!

I thought this dish was excellent.  I used three 14.5 oz cans of tomatoes and doubled the shrimp.  We love shrimp!!  One of the tomato cans, I used had green chiles in it which added some spice.  Personally I think it would of been better without the green chiles, but it was delicious!  You have to like herbs, especially basil.  Wonderful recipe, 5 stars!!!!  Thanks you for sharing!

This was very good.  I used precooked shrimp to make it easier.  I just added them to the sauce for 3-5 minutes or so to heat them through.

This was way too good! I used linguini instead of angel hair pasta for a different texture. The wine in the sauce is so delicate, but it adds so much to the taste. It was even good warmed up the next day.  I think that next time I will try with chicken too.

This is a great recipe. I made it for my friends and it went over quite well. It is perfect when you want something that feels healthy, and at the same time fills you up. The only suggestion I can make to others trying this out is that the prep time will be longer that ten minutes if you are deveining the shrimp yourself. So you might want to take that in consideration while planning the rest of your meal.

Wow!!!! First off the smell was intoxicating and my tummy rummbled soooo loudly while cooking! Amazing that such a simple recipe could create something so tasty and wonderful. I did not however add olive oil to the water for the pasta or run cold water over the pasta for I have watched enough Italian cooking shows, have 3 Italian cookbooks, and have coked enough pasta dishes to know that one should never add olive oil to pasta while in the water or run cooked pasta under cold water for it takes away all the natural coating pasta has, so that's a no no, but everything else was right on!!! OH, and no shripm in mine for i'm a vegetairn, but it was just wonderful w/ pasta and some crusty bread.

Was Delicious, my hubby went head over heals for it.  I didn't use all of the recommended amount of tomatos though.  I only used one can and that seemed more than enough.  Thanks for the recipe Pat!

Wow! This was so good! I added extra garlic, used just one 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes, increased the wine a tad and added a bit of whipping cream to the sauce to thicken and richen it up. It was light and delicious and definitely one of those recipes that I'll make over and over again.

I didn't have the win nor the tomatoes, but it still turned out excellent nonetheless. It becomes a really pretty dish without the tomatoes because the basil and parsley gets spread into the pasta and the shrimp shine from the garlic and oil. Overall, a simple and delicious meal, great for beginners.

I gotta say, as an "old" Italian cook, this was fabulous!!!  I made this last week, & can't wait to do again!  I used fresh Italian Garlic (the garden over-floweth!!!), & more garlic (I know my tastes!), & this was Heaven-on-Earth!  I suspect, having read "too much tomato" that you've got to be a tomato or Italian lover like me to appreciate the simple taste of tomatos!!!  I can't WAIT until my tomato plants are over-flowing!  They're starting to get big enough, but not red enough!  Blessings!!!

This recipe was very good, however I found it a little on the bland side.  Next time I'm going to add more garlic and basil, maybe some oregano as well.  Rather than using canned tomatoes I used fresh and added some sliced mushrooms to the mixture.

I made a trial run of this recipe last night - delicious.
It's now on the menu for Friday night's guests.  Easy, not a lot of prep and tastes like Italy.  
I did add a little fresh basel to the plate when I served it.

A little too much tomatoes for me. I will try again and change the recipe a bit and make it more saucy and less tomato heavy.

This recipe was great, though I added a few items. I cooked some green onion with the garlic, didnt use italian tomatoes,  just petite diced, and squeezed lemon juice on finished meal. Turned out great!

One can of tomatoes is enough, or 2, 15oz cans.  Always add a small sprinkle of red pepper flakes when you saute the garlic.  Turning the shrimp while cooking in garlic and red pepper flakes and olive oil, adding a little of the basil while doing so.  Add remaining basil, I use a bit more than called for (love basil), add tomatoes and let flavors meld.  2 or 3 minutes, then add the chilled pasta and re add the shrimp, turn heat to low or off, if good and hot, and let the el' dente pasta soak up the sauce.  It should not be too wet.  Good Italian pasta sauce is nearly all taken in by the pasta.    Serve with the parmesan cheese (Important to always grate your own fresh parmesan) it really does make a difference...   a red wine of your choice for pairing.  And it is a very very good dish.

Great recipe! Of course, you must add your own little touches.... If you're a garlic lover, use one HUGE clove of elephant garlic.  I also used equal amounts of fresh parsley and basil and substituted organic diced fire roasted salt free tomatoes and organic vegetable broth instead of white wine.  We poured the wine into glasses and served it with dinner instead.

I have never reviewed a recipe before,  it had to comment on this one!  It was absolutely delicious!  There was not a. Ite left, and my entire family, including our 3 teenaged boys, loved it!  I was out of white wine, so I added 1/2 cup of spaghetti sauce to the tomatoes instead and it was perfect. I will be making this on a regular basis from now on.  The only negative is that I will no longer be able to order this in an Italian restaurant again because this tasted so much better!

This was an excellent,  quick dinner.  I deviated a bit from the original though,  by cooking the shrimp directly in the sauce, instead of precooking them. I also only used one can of tomatoes and didn't drain them. I waited until the very end to add the herbs and left out the cheese. I don't care for cheese in seafood pasta dishes.
We will make this again and again!

Excellent dish - fresh and easy, super for summer (or any season for that matter)!!  I was sadly out of any type of 'long' pasta, so I had to sub in some whole wheat fusili!!  I used fresh parsley and basil I had growing along with both canned and fresh tomatoes (didn't have enough fresh).  Wonderful :)

This recipe has a lot of flavor if you follow the recipe and use fresh herbs.  A couple things:  I removed the garlic after I softened it up (I find that's about the only way not to burn it), and then sauteed about 1 1/2 cups sliced baby portabello mushrooms.  I removed those to a plate as well, and added both back in once I added the tomatoes and remaining liquid.  The mushrooms add a nice bite and meatiness to the sauce without adding a lot more unneccessary calories.

This was DELICIOUS! 
I added a bit more garlic, a bit more basil and parsley just to boost with a bit more flavor. I also did what another cook said to do - and that was not to pre-cook the shrimp. Just cook them near the end of the "simmer" of the sauce. They came out just perfect that way. 
I will definitely make this recipe again!

I used a lot more garlic because I love it, especially on italian dishes. I used 3 cans of 14 oz tomatoes. 2 - 28oz would have been way too much in my opinion. Very good and fresh tasting pasta dish. I served with with a caprese salad.

Boy was this good!  I did double the garlic, & added about 1/4 tsp. of crushed red pepper flakes, but otherwise made it as written.  This was fast, easy and impressive looking when plated.  Garlic bread and a green salad rounded out the meal.  Dessert was cut fresh fruit with vanilla yogurt as a topping.

My husband, the Newfoundlander, loved this.  As suggested by other reviewers, I decreased the oil to a few tablespoons, added red pepper flakes and mushrooms.  I also added about a lb of bay scallops and doubled the shrimp.  I used fresh parsley from my garden and it was great.  For the non fish lovers, I think this would be good with italian sausage or without any meat or seafood at all.  The flavours of the herbs are distinct and robust - awesome.  I aslo added fresh ground black pepper

I can't say enough good things about this house favourite, which is both delicious AND quick to throw together when you'd really rather be watching Doctor Who than cooking. If you're not using fresh herbs, you're doing it wrong, because half the MMMMfactor comes from the bright popping green colour and the incredible smell they give while they cook. I'm not much for wine, like, at all, so I used chicken stock instead. We also like to use jumbo shrimp. My husband asks for this all the time, no matter what pasta I use with it.

easy and delicious!! would make more sauce next time - you can definitely be conservative with the oil- it's not necessary in the pasta and you can hold back on using all of it in the pan- Great idea that someone suggested to use it for company- i'd be impressed if someone served it to me! Great! - added a splash of cream at the end before adding shrimp and didn't cook the shrimp- just basically tossed it into the sauce then all of it onto the pasta

I made this dish for a romantic dinner with my fiance and we both just LOVED it!  It is even better the next day.  I may even try adding a little heavy cream to the sauce next time.  THANK YOU!

Yum! Yum!  We loved it!  We started with less of the tomatoe sauce but realized we needed more so ended up adding the listed amount.  We also did everything on the Weber grill except the pasta.  It was yummy and we have leftovers for tomorrow.  Thanks for sharing!

Simple to make, and awesome.  At the end I added just a bit of half n half to give it a tiny bit of "creamy" consistency, but not too much.  For those who say 2 28-oz cans of diced tomatoes was too much, did you remember to drain them as the recipe called for?  It was by NO means too many tomatoes.  Fresh grated parmesan is imperative to the flavor, I think.  Also, tasted 10 times better the second day as leftovers, after all the flavors had a change to blend.  Will definitely make again and again.

Holi canoli. This dish was wonderfully beautiful :D  i exchanged the wine for chicken stock and i added about half a small can of tomato paste to thicken up the sauce, but other than that, i stuck to the books and it couldnt have been better :D  TWO THUMBS UP.

This meal was quick and tasted like restaurant quality. The longest part was peeling the shrimp. I too just added the shrimp to the sauce instead of cooking them in Step 2 but I did let the sauce cook for longer on low heat to let the flavors get friendly with one another before I added them. Omitted the basil because the store didn't have any fresh basil on hand and didn't wanna use dried herbs or drive all over town for one ingredient. Will definitely use next time. Excellent recipe overall, STRAIGHT UP!!!

I made this last night and it turned out okay...nothing exceptional! I did have to substitute the dry white wine for a Riesling. I'm sure this altered the taste a bit. I'll try it again using a dry wine next time.

It's goood. I need to write this review so that others will not make the same mistake as I do. I cooked this twice, the first time it's awful. I got an ordinary standard american diced tomato, forgot to drain, Sav.Bl,turned out way too acid. The second time, I follow everything to a t, got a real italian canned diced tomato, drain, chardonnay instead of Sav.Blan, seared the shrimp with the garlic in the beginning as directed, turned off the heat and add the shrimp back. I would say it's as good as any real italian restaurant. I will not suggest other to reduce the portion of canned tomato, since there will not be too much tomato left if cook for 8-10 mins to reduce the wine to half.

Double the garlic.  Try adding a 10oz package of spinach to the tomato mix.  The spinach wilts and just adds a lot to the dish.

Not bad, if you use 1 can of tomatoes.  I added more garlic and put salt & pepper in the sauce after it reduced.  Very quick and easy.

I am Superdeb's husband. I made this dish on Valentine's day istead of going out and it was awesome.As most of the reviews suggested, I cut the tomatoes in half. I upped the ingredients to 6 servings and added more shrimp because we are shrimp lovers. It was much more appreciated than reservations at the local steakhouse. I am sure we will both fixing this again soon.

Was good. I didn't put two cans of the tomatoes in it, one was enough. I used the garlic, basil and oregano seasoned diced tomatoes. I salt and peppered the tomatoe mix when it reduced, squeezed a lemon wedge into it and tossed in the shrimp. I also did not use a lot of olive oil. Didn't put any in the pasta pan and just a splash to the bottom of my saute pan. Came out really well. Will make this again.

very easy to make and my 4 year old even loved it! Instead of putting the sauce just on top of the pasta, next time I will throw the pasta into the skillet with the sauce for a couple minutes so it soaks up the flavor.

This has become a staple in my home!  I keep all the ingredients on hand (shrimp in the freezer) and have whipped it up for unexpected company a couple of times, always to rave reviews.  The only changes I make is doubling or tripling the amount of fresh basil......I always keep a good big handful back to add at the last minute (the fresh taste of basil is too wonderful to scimp on).  This is an absolute winner!

It was a bit bland to me.  Seemed as if it was missing something but I just couldn't figure out what.  I might add a little heavy cream (like another poster suggestion) if I should make this again.

Love this recipe.  It's become a go to recipe for me when I'm having people over.  Very easy to make a lot of it.  I use a lot more garlic than the recipe calls for, as well as more basil.  I also add a splash of cream to the sauce to make it a creamy tomato sauce.

I was really disappointed in this recipe - to me it was just a little "blah."  I followed the recipe exactly and found the end to be slightly bland and I really did not like the texture of the diced tomatoes.  I would recommend the Fra Diavolo Pasta with Shrimp (from this website) instead.

This was delicious and easy to make! I didn't drain the tomatoes so it took a bit longer, I also added 1/4 cup of heavy cream. I added the fresh basil at the end with the shrimp (I used frozen shrimp), about 3-4 minutes before it's done. Will definitely make again!

My picky husband liked this very much.  I was very skeptical when making this dish, thinking it was going to be bland but it was the opposite.  I used only 1 can of diced tomatoes since I'm not into tomato 'chunks'.  My advice is to rinse the diced tomatoes, not just drain, so the wine sauce can cling to the shrimp and not get lost in the tomato sauce!

Wow! ! !  I love this recipe.  The first time I made it for 2, I cut the recipe in half which is so easy to do here.  I also added and sauteed 1 small onion and 1 small can of sliced mushrooms in addition to  tsp. lemon juice and 1/2 tsp of red pepper.

Am having company this Friday and will make the whole recipe as written.  I will definitely make this again and again.

Wow, this dish is outstanding!!!!  I took the advise of other reviwers and added about 1/2 pint of heavy cream, which was great!  I didn't have the seasoned diced tomatoes so I added plenty of italian seasoning plus garlic.  I am making this for the second night in a row.....even the three kids loved this!!!

Excellent recipe!  My husband called this one a "keeper" - and before we ate, he had expressed his apprehension about the meal, since he's not a huge shrimp fan.  It might have helped that I doubled the garlic, doubled the wine... I also decided to use only one can of tomatoes (undrained), since I didn't want it to be too "tomatoey"... but it was superb!  Clean-up was also a breeze - only a pasta pot and a sauce pan... and nothing that sticks!  I will certainly be making this meal again and again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Such a good recipe as is, but I added some veggies like mushrooms, sauteed onions, spinach, and advacado just to be healthy. It was even good reheated.  
I don't think you can mess this dish up.

Delicious--and so easy and quick! I've never cooked with raw shrimp before--don't know what I was afraid of! Overall, this is a flavorful and forgiving dish--it was OK that the pasta sat around for a few minutes. It was OK that the shrimp sat out for a few minutes. In the end, I just dumped the drained pasta into the sauce, stirred it up, and served it nice and hot! I followed the recipe with a few tweaks, as suggested by others. 1) No Italian tomatoes on hand, so I used regular diced tomatoes + a little dried oregano and thyme. I also used only 2 (14-oz.) cans, undrained. 2) No oil in the pasta water - helps eliminate the sauce-sticking problem. 3) Tossed in a handful of sliced mushrooms during last 5 minutes of sauce-cooking time. 4) Used linguini instead of angel hair - a personal preference. This recipe is a definite keeper.

This is a great recipe! I used bay scallops instead of shrimp because we already had shrimp for dinner this week. The scallops turned out great. I used minced garlic and sauteed the scallops until they were a golden brown. The hubby was happy with this one. We'll make it again. Thanks!

This was absolutely the best recipe I have tried on here in quite a while. I did not cook my shrimp with the garlic or in the sauce because my little ones would be eating it. However I sauteed them until they were cooked set them aside and then reheated them in a pan sprinkled with a little salt pepper and garlic powder. I also didn't use the italian seasoned tomatoes. I substituted 2-14oz cans of regular and added some dried oregano and basil. Oh and I didn't drain the tomaotes and would maybe not let it cook down as much because there were some rather dry spots in the pasta. 
Thanks for a great recipe.

I gave this a four out of five mostly because I think the ingredient quantities are off, and the sauce doesn't have a lot of stick as others have said.  The flavor was great.  I made these modifications:  Precooked shrimp, 14 oz of whole wheat spaghetti, beer instead of wine, and dried herbs instead of fresh.  Also, I used one 14.5 oz can of tomatoes, and while I think you could go to two, four would be a ridiculous amount.  Thanks for the recipe, I'll be making it again!

I didn't read carefully and bought 2 -14 ounce cans of tomatoes instead of 28 ounce cans.  But, there was already more than enough tomatoes, so I probably would not buy the bigger cans next time either.  My sauce did not stick to the pasta either, but the dish was still good together.

This was very good!! The kids even liked it!! It was also SUPER easy too! I think next time I will give those flavored diced tomatoes a try. The only ingredient I did change was instead of using Parmesean cheese I used Pecorino Romano! FABULOUS!

Edible but not fantastic.  It just seemed to  be missing something.  I added salt and extra garlic in hopes of bringing out the flavor but no luck.  I did like the fact that it wasn't a heavy meal.

Ok, but not great. It wasn't as flavorful as I would've liked and I am not sure I liked the shrimp with red sauce. I think I prefer cream or butter sauce for pasta & shrimp dishes, but figured I'd give this a whirl. I most likely won't make this again, but thanks for the recipe!

This was very good. It was also easy and quick. It was definately a nice change for shrimp. I would just recommend adding salt.

Unfortunately, I did not think it tasted as good as everyone else said. I am not a huge fan of tomatoes so I only used 1 14 oz. can. My sauce didn't stick to the noodles very well and the shrimp wasn't flavored enough. Sorry.

Following many suggestions...I added zuchinni, green onions, portabella mushrooms, lots 'o' garlic, 28 oz plain diced tomatoes, not drained (then adding dried oregano and basil to make it "Italian") and 7 oz tomato paste.  I added extra wine to dilute to desired consistency.  I also used higher protein Angel Hair pasta.  It was exceptional, sure doesn't need any sugar.

Way too many tomatoes, and it sort of had an off sweet taste to the sauce (yes, I did use DRY white wine).  Unfortunately, I will not make this recipe again...not terrible, and yet not great.

This Recipe is great. The reason why some members say that it is bland is because the recipe does not include salt or seasoning.
By adding salt according to your taste it comes out great.
Will definately make this one again.

Awesome... although I have to say, what I made turned out much different than the recipe b/c I didn't have fresh basil, so I comprised by adding dried basil, 1/2 chopped onion, 1/2 chopped green pepper, extra garlic, marjoram, oregano, red pepper flakes, S&P, 1/2 can of tomato paste, and only 28oz total (I think the recipe is a typo) diced tomatoes plus italian seasoning.  I also didn't cook the shrimp first and just added it in to the rest of the ingredients toward the end.  Very yummy with garlic bread!!

I used more garlic than called for, let the tomatoes and wine cook down to make the sauce a little thicker. You will need to add salt for sure. It is a recipe worth saving.

Very good, I used large scallops instead of shrimp this time.  I will make this in the summer when my fresh herb garden is blooming.  I added a dash of garlic powder to enhance the fresh garlic.  I used fresh grape tomato cut in half.  Thank you

delicious. I'll use a little less basil next time (it was a bit overpowering) but overall, a very good, quick recipe. My only modifications were that I chopped the tomatoes in my food processor and added a touch of fat-free half-n-half for a change. yum.

Wonderful !!!!!!!!!! This dish is so easy, so fast and so good. I came home from soccer practice and needed to get my 3 kids and husband dinner before leaving in 60 minutes for ice skating. I prepared, served and cleaned up with 10 minutes to spare. A good homemade, heathly meal for a family on the go.  I did use less canned tomatoes and added fresh plum ones and also added black olives along with Italian sausage.

This recipe was ok.  I cut the amount of spices in half and the flavor was still overwhelming.  After I ate, my plate was still covered in remaining spices.  I'd make it again though.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I used precooked frozen shrimp and it was so quick and easy.  The fresh basil and fresh shredded parmesean cheese is the key to this dish.  I will make this again, even though my kids did not like it.  They can eat buttered pasta!

THIS RECIPE WAS AMAZING!!  I made this for a dinner party and everyone said it tasted just like it came from a fancy Italian restaurant!!  It really was very delicious.  I plan on making it again and again.  I live in a smaller town and have to travel about 30 miles for the shrimp, but it is sooooo worth it!!  Thank you so much Pat!

Wonderful recipe!  I will *never* be buying canned pasta sauces again!  I left out the shrimp because I didn't have any (long story) and added a little red pepper.  I also only used 28 oz. of tomatoes, but if you are serving several people you should probably use it all.

Mmm..this was a really simple, but delish shrimp pasta recipe!  It was easy to make and I had all the ingredients on hand.  My husband loved it...Thanks!

This recipe was excellent. If you can't make it Olive Garden this is a perfect substitute.  I have prepared it twice.  My husband and children loved it.  The youngest gave it a thumbs up. I cooked it the second time because they asked me to.  This has become a permanent recipe for me.

thanks.

I didn't like this recipe.  The sauce tasted fine (I had to add a generous amount of salt), but the shrimp taste just didn't go well with the sauce, im my opinion.  I won't make this again...at least, not with shrimp.

Made it for 6 people and they all loved it.  I added mushrooms, green/red/yellow peppers, green onions and more garlic.  doubled the recipe except only used 3 cans diced italian flav. tomatoes and didn't have the wine.  My wife's new favorite.

I made this for my husband last night for Valentine's Day.  We both really enjoyed it.  I only had 3 14.5 ounce cans of diced tomatoes, and I used already cooked shrimp (I used the shells to flavor the sauce), and it still turned out great.  It was so light and flavorful, we will for sure make this again.

This is terrific, though I changed a few things.  I sauteed onion, red pepper, and green beans in olive oil, garlic, and 1 cup white wine ~ I added only ONE can of tomatoes to this and cooked everything until it was warm and tender.  I added 1/2 cup of heavy cream and 1/8 cup of grated parmesan cheese at the end.  I served the whole thing over bowtie pasta.  It was the best meal I have ever made and my family went crazy!  The other changes I would recommend are MUCH less olive oil and much more garlic.

I increased the garlic amount and sauteed fresh mushroom slices and quartered zuccini slices with the garlic.  Otherwise I think it would have been quite bland.  However, I did use dried basil and parsley.  I used only one 28-oz. can of plain diced tomatoes as two would have been too much.  I also combined about 1 tbsp. flour mixed with about 1/3 cup cold water and stirred it into the tomatoes and wine mixture as it boiled to thicken it.  But my husband, brother-in-law, and I thought it turned out very good.  Parmesan is a must.  Will definitely make again.

takes too long to reduce by 1/2, at least 45 minutes.  Also, too much tomato, add more spices to liven up the recipe.

I made this for an intimate dinner with friends and it was a big hit! 4 cans of tomatoes was too much though and you have to make sure the sauce comes to a boil for awhile before it will reduce. If you follow the receipe sans 1 can of tomatoes you will have a great meal!!

This dish was kind of dissapointing.  The sauce was very liquidy so when I tried to take a bite of the pasta, all the sauce would drip off. So every bite was almost just plain pasta. It had a fairly good flavor but I don't think I will be making this again.  On a scale from 1-10 my husband gave it a 3.

This one I will definitely make again!  It went well in every respect.    The one thing I would change is the idea of draining the pasta and then running cold water over it.  I am assuming that is to wash the starch away so the pasta does not stick.  It didn't work for me.  By the time the shrimp and tomato mixture was done the pasta had cooled into one big lump.  I had to give everyone their serving using a set of kitchen shears.  What I normally do with pasta is drain it, return it to the pot with a small pat of butter and stir until all the pasta is coated and it guarantees no sticky pasta.

This recipe is going to be going in my recipe box for sure!

This was ok, not a great deal of flavor. I may try again with some changes.
Second try with increases of garlic and basil, added 1/4 cup chicken broth before pan reduction of the tomato mixture and truffle salt added near the end...and I'm  still underwhelmed.

I thought it was good.  My husband loves pasta and especially with shrimp.  I seasoned the shrimp when I sauteed them with a sprinkling of red pepper and white pepper.  In cooking the tomato sauce I added  maybe a fourth of wheel of brie cheese because that's what I had.  Could have had more.  It thickened the juice and added a lot of flavor.  My husband thought it was great!  Jeannie

I never add oil to boil pasta. I always use generous sea salt I never rinse pasta. I always save a little of the drained water to thin an overly thick sauce. I like to hand crush fresh, peeled San Marzano or Plum tomatoes for the recipe. I like to use wide, flat pasta, gnocchi, or homemade is even better! 
Bon Appetito !

Made this tonight & it was DELISH!!   I used 16 oz. of pasta & there is little
left.  Did not use wine white as I did not have it.  Did NOT put shrimp in on
Step #2.  Added shrimp at the end of Step #3 just for about 3-4 min. This is a keeper.   Dee NJ

Excellent meal!  I followed it exactly as given (I added a bit more shrimp) and it was delicious.  Very quick, easy and filling. Be sure to really drain the tomatoes so it's not soupy.  Will definitely make again - maybe with broccoli or spinach next time.

I made this recipe exactly as posted except used tomatoes from my garden, added a little red pepper flakes and oregano and extra EVOO. It was fantastic! I will definitely make again.

I had my doubts, didn't think it would have much flavor. It was excellent! I didn't have italian tomatoes, so I made my own, a large can of petite diced tomatoe, added onion, celery, bell pepper, and dried basil.  Simmered for 15 min and then followed the recipe as written.  Family loved it too.

I did make a couple substitutions for this recipe to work for my home and what was on hand.  I did use 2 large fresh roma tomatoes diced in place of the 2 cans of stewed tomatoes, I thought this was a great change to keep it more garden fresh.  Also, instead of 1/2 c. of white wine, I used 1/4 c. EVOO and 1/4 c. white wine vinegar.  Amazing dinner, will make this again!

I was disappointed in this dish, rating it 3 stars because I thought it needed more jazz.  It was bland and could use more seasoning for my tastes.  However, my husband thought it was good and gave it 4 stars.  Too bad for him I'm the cook.

Easy, adaptable, delicious! I used 1 -14.5 oz can of stewed tomatoes and my basil-parsley proportion was probably opposite but this was delicious. I decided not to use as much tomato just based on my preference. I might try adding the basil & parsley later next time just to keep them brighter and perhaps tastier. I also added a pinch of salt and about 1/4 teaspoon of agave syrup in an effort to reduce the acidity but I would definitely make this again.

After reading the reviews, I made the following adjustments: 4 cloves of garlic, 1 Tb fresh oregano, thyme, 1/4 cup basil, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp fresh ground pepper, sauteed in oil with 28 ounces of diced Italian seasoned tomatoes. Add a dash of sugar.  Simmer for 15-20 minutes, adjusting spices as needed. I like a little red pepper flakes.  Then add the raw shrimp, cover, and simmer until shrimp is  done, about 5 to 6 minutes, stirring frequently.  Very good over pasta.

This was so delicious. Made a few changes. Used Rice penne pasta which is much healthier. Also used grape tomatoes cut in half instead of the canned tomatoes. Instead of Parmesan cheese, I added a 1/2 cup of pesto. So yummy! Will def make again.

I really loved this recipe.  I used my homemade canned spaghetti sauce rather than the Italian diced tomatoes.  I let it simmer for longer than what the recipe called for- anyone want my homemade canned spaghetti recipe let me know!!  Thanks for this great dish.

The ingredients look basic but this dish is very flavorful and delicious.  I would reduce the pepper flakes by 1/2 next time.  It will still carry the zing and spirit of the recipe, but it won't be overly spicy to the point where it interferes with the flavor by numbing your taste buds.

It was delicious! I used half the tomatoes than the recipe called for. I also cooked the shrimp in the sauce for 4-5 minutes instead of cooking beforehand. Easy to make and a few simple ingredients make this a go-to recipe! P.S. the hubs said it smelled like Olive Garden and tasted better!

Didn't like this. I probably did something wrong, but the sauce never reduced and the cooking times seemed way off (about 1/2 what was required).

So simple and oh, so very delicious with lots of garlic and fresh basil. We doubled most ingrediants; used only 3, 28oz cans of tomatoes and it made plenty for dinner, and several take to work lunches. Rarely does food qualify as an experience for me, but this dish did. Absolutel fantastic.

My family and I thought this was really great but I think it needs a little kick. I will make this again but probably add a little bit of red pepper flakes. I used fresh tomatoes and fresh basil from my garden. It was a tasty and light pasta dish for a hot summer night.

I ended up sauteing onion and green pepper with the garlic, then figured what the hay and added celery as well.  At the point I realized I was making shrimp creole, so added hot sauce, pepper flakes and cayenne.  I did not serve it with Parmesan.  I gave it four stars, even though I basically made a different recipe, because it gave me the idea of what to do with shrimp and diced tomatoes.

Great foundation for a great recipe.  I always add my own ingredients, but for sure the key here is the fresh garlic.  I added capers and lemon to the shrimp during the first cooking, and I also added artichoke hearts during the final simmering.  My family loved this dish and said it was a 5 star restaurant meal. So pleased :)

This is one of my favourites! It's easy and tasty! You can make it using dried basil too (like in the winter when fresh is hard to come by), but sooo much better with fresh. When using dried basil I think I put about 1tsp. Thanks for the great recipe!

first time i tried this did not turn out too well but i had tasted the promise and the second time i did it was perfect! the other reviews were right on -add the shrimps last when the sauce is simmering-that way, you do not remove the garlic with the shrimps if you follow the original recipe and the shrimps come out soft and succulent. and using fresh herbs is the key. i also added 2 pieces of jalapeno peppers since i like 'em hot. i am good with 2 (28 ounce) cans of tomatoes so you can simmer it longer without the sauce drying up. this is such a delicious pasta dish -comparable to what good restaurants serve. definitely a keeper!!!thanks for this treasure in my recipe box.

I followed the recipe exactly except I doubled the pasta...fantastic!  The only change I would make would be to add more garlic.  Very easy recipe and a crowd pleaser!

Excellent.  My boyfriend told me that this was the best dish I've ever made for him.  I did add some mushrooms and a little cream and Romano cheese give the sauce some body, but those are the only changes I made.  This is a very "fresh" tasting sauce.  I'm making it again tomorrow.

5 star without a doubt.  For those of you who say to halve the tomato, I think you're crazy!  For me the objective of the dish isn't to be shrimp overload, but rather a culmination of a lot of different fresh ingredients.  I would suggest using the full amount of tomato and adding a little flour while reducing to thicken the mixture.  I think I used 1/8 to 1/4 of a cup to get it to the consistency that I like.  I served this dish in bowls since it still had a fair amount of juice after reducing and adding the flour.  To make it aesthetically pleasing, I clumped the pasta in the middle of the bowls and topped with the shrimp and larger tomatoes in the mixture.  Then, I poured a small amount of the thinner over the top and around the edges. Finally, I added the noted parmesan, some freshly ground pepper, and a very small amount of lemon juice over.  Overall, a very solid recipe.  I would highly suggest to any beginner to moderate chef.

I cannot stress how delicious this is.  I made it just as written, with the exception of no parsley on hand.  Use good quality white wine and fresh basil.  Sweet and savory, light meal for summer!  DELICIOUS!!

I made this dish last night and my family really enjoyed it. Along with the fresh herbs and wine called for, I used 2 lbs of shrimp, one 14 oz can of Italian style stewed tomatoes (diced and not drained), 3 Roma tomatoes from my garden, and 1 lb. of sliced mushrooms to give the dish more body. It seemed to make the correct ratio of sauce to pasta and was light enough for a perfect summer pasta dish. Thanks!

Not too bad. May cook the tomatoes longer next time or cut in half. Had a lot of extra sauce. Also, if you live in the Midwest like I do, and fresh shrimp is hard to come by, and have to use frozen, you could probably skip the first cooking of the shrimp and just warm in the tomato sauce at the end.

Hi everyone! I'm new to the website. Last week I found this recipe for some shrimp that I needed to cook. Not only did the recipe turn out great and is now a family favorite, but the tools and information for the dish were easy to use. I'll be using this sight again and promise to mention this site to my family and friends. Thanks so much.

This tasted just like at an Italian restaurant we frequent.  I made a few minor modifications and it turned out very well.  I only used 1 28 ounce can of diced tomatoes and kept all the other measurements the same.  I also let the shrimp marinade in the fridge for an hour in an olive oil/garlic/white wine/parsley mixture.  It was easy to prepare and tasted great.  The only problem was that we didn't have enough of the sauce or shrimp for the amount of pasta.  Next time I'll use 2 cans of diced tomatoes and double all the other ingredients and keep the pasta the same.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was very good.  All three of my kids liked it which is saying something.  I made a few minor changes.  I increased the garlic to about 1 tablespoon.  I used three large cloves of garlic.  I also added about 1/2 teaspoon of italian seasoning as per another reviewer's suggestion.  Also, instead of using cans of diced tomatoes I peeled, seeded and diced 15 small roma tomatoes.

Something just doesn't seem right with the recipe. I followed some of the recommended changes, added italian seasoning, etc. and it still came out bland. I will stick to the "Best Marinara Sauce yet" recipe and just add shrimp to it.

This dish was a hit in our household.  I did take into consideration previous recommendations and decreased the tomatoes to 1 can and added a little extra garlic.  Next time, I'll add more shrimp as it felt like it needed a little more.  The hub and I loved it and we'll definitely be making this one again!

Just made this tonight.  I only used a 28 can of regular diced tomatoes, added Italian Seasoning, then used a 14 oz can of cannellini beans.  Didn't have the wine, so just used the juice from the diced tomatoes.  Really really good!   Even my picky teenagers thought it was great! Very simple and had all the ingredients out of my pantry.

This recipe will go into regular rotation at my house. Both kids and my husband liked it, AND it was super easy to prepare (nice for a weeknight). My changes were: I used 16oz pasta (rather than 8oz), increased the garlic from 1 tsp to 2T, and cut the tomato by a little (used 1 28oz and 1 15oz can of diced toms). Thumbs up all around!

Finally a TASTY pasta recipe that isn't full of dairy products.  This was really easy to make - Just a few ingredients and about 30 minutes. My fiance and I both enjoyed it. It's just too bad that there aren't any leftovers. I was hoping to take some to work tomorrow for lunch.

This was excellent!!!  Many reviewers suggested cutting back on the tomatoes.  I would not do this.  I would use the amount of tomatoes suggested in this dish but make a whole pound of pasta.  The flavors were awesome!!!  I would also not cook the shrimp as long as recommended.

While the sauce was good it was not thick enough. Adding some tomato paste or sauce would be far better. Good flavor but the noodles couldn't hold it.

This was very tasty, but the wine can be omitted because it gives hardly any flavor and it was an expensive wine. I cooked the shrimp first then added the garlic for less than a minute so as not to burn it. Also used multi grain pasta which I added to the shrimp mixture since it was cold because it had been rinsed first.  Yes I will make this again.

Unbelievably good, unbelievably easy.......unbelievable!!!!! I too added red pepper flakes with the tomatoes. I thoroughly tossed the pasta with the sauce and shrimp, ensured it was hot again, served it and distributed the shrimp evenly amongst guests.  MAKE THIS!!!!!!!!!

5 stars because all of my children ate it without complaint! I used tomatoes I'd frozen from the summer - diced and pureed. Basil I'd pureed and frozen from the summer, some oregano, parsley, garlic and a dash of salt/pepper and season salt. Simmered until some of the water evaporated then I added the shrimp right at the end. Served with grated romano cheese - Delicious! I can't wait for leftovers tomorrow!

This is a really good recipe but it did require some tweaking.  We doubled the recipe to serve 8 people but we only used (2) 28 oz cans of diced tomatoes anything more than that would have been just WAY too much!  We added in a only about 1/4 cup of white wine, a splash of lemon juice and a can of chicken broth.  I also seasoned the shrimp with crab boil seasoning before sauteing to add more flavor.  Next time I would like to wilt some fresh spinach in with the garlic and olive oil to add to this.  Very good recipe which we will make again.

While I have made many "internet recipes", this is the first I have reviewed.  It was wonderful!  I made it for a quick Christmas Eve dinner and it was highly praised.  I didn't drain the tomatoes and added 2 pounds of shrimp and extra garlic, parsley and basil (all fresh).  It was delicious.  
Merry Christmas!

Totally enjoyed the patties. Though my husband and I ate all of the recipe for one meal. Changes made added 1t Old Bay, then sprinkled with paprika after first turn. Served with the dipping sauce another reviewer recommended. Will keep this recipe for future use!!

This was fantastic and easy.
I did not have fresh parsley, so used dry instead.  The fresh basil was key I think.  I used one clove of garlic and cut into 4 pieces and sauteed in the oil (we did not want to consume alot of garlic).  I made extra pasta and used only 1 can of tomatoes.

i gave it 4 stars because i tweaked it a bit, but it turned out great.  i used chicken instead of shrimp, because i already had it.  also i added about 1/2 cup of heavy whipping cream and some of the diced tomato liquid for more of a sauce.  i seasoned the chicken with a bit of cajun seasoning and added a sprinkling of red pepper flakes to the sauce.  it was phenomenal!  and tasted even better the next day.  thanks for a great base recipe.

This was great! Made it for 10 people and it came together nicely. The sauce is great, and the leftovers were lovely as well. I'll definitely make this again, but with garlic bread sticks!

Surprise surprise, this quick and simple recipe has become my husband's favourite dinner.  He perks up immediately no matter how his work day has gone when he hears he's getting this for supper, and usually takes any leftovers with him to work the next day.  Which is great for me, since I can make it while doing umpteen other things at once because it's such a snap.  After making it so often, I've made a few changes to suit our tastes, but the original still holds well:

- I usually do about four cloves of minced garlic added to half a bulb of chopped onion, left to sweat in a pan for a few minutes before I add anything else.
- I add a 1/3 tsp of Hungarian Hot Paprika to the sauce.
- Because we like a thicker sauce, I usually add one 8 oz can of tomato sauce to the diced.
- Fresh herbs absolutely make all the difference, so if you can, always opt for that over the dried stuff for this recipe.

After draing the tomatoes, I thought it was a little dry, would not completely drain them the ext time, but very good otherwise.
Quick, easy and tasty, would definitely make it again.

YUM!  This was very good. As others suggested, I added a little cream to the sauce.  I also used the blender to mix the spices, tomatoes and cream.  This chopped up the tomatoes and made the sauce smoother.  In addition to the shrimp, I added a half pound of small scallopes. To make it just a bit healthier I used whole grain pasta.

This recipe is very good. I did not put the olive in the water while cooking the pasta. Adding the oil it stops the sauce from sticking to the pasta. This info. came from a Italian Cook Book.  I also added more garlic... because we LOVE the stuff. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I thought it good. Easy and fast dish. But a little bland. I like bland, but my two guest didn't. The annoying part was I had to evenly divide the tomato and shrimps to each dish.

I was really excited to find this recipe, but after trying it out I had to deduct two stars.  First, the sauce didn't blend or mix with the pasta.  I had to make certain to scoop some sauce with every bite of pasta.  Secondly, it was kind of bland.  I try adding more garlic salt and still tasted too much tomato.  Oh well, lesseon learned.

This was an easy and delicious dish to prepare.  The only thing I did differently was to use fresh tomatoes instead of canned.  The taste was light but still had a rich flavor.

I improvised based on the other recommendations and it was superb! I made the recipe with a lemon zest, fresh tomatoes, 1/4 cup of heavy cream and 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes and added 2 more oz of wine.  Delicious and light.  I used fresh med. shrimp instead and it worked out perfectly.

This is a recipe that I would say is very tasty -- but not exceptionally so. I cooked the recipe as written, to get the full experience. I think the bulk sodium in the canned tomatoes took away from the freshness and flavor of the herbs. I also felt that, while the shrimp were really delicious, the overall dish lacked a "wow" flavor/ingredient. 

I will certainly make the dish again, but I'll use fresh tomatoes, pepper, extra herbs, more wine, and some lemon zest to draw out the flavors.

I am rating this one middle of the road...I didn't make any changes except to use dried herbs (last minute decision to make it and couldn't run to the store), but was not impressed with the dish as is.  However after making it, I then read some of the reviews...(I know I did it backwards), and think that this recipe is a really good base to start with.  Many people thought the sauce did not stick to the pasta and I think that not adding olive oil to the pasta water would help that and others suggested adding a little cream to the tomato sauce.  I think a little something is needed to kick up the sauce...cayenne pepper, oregano, mushrooms, spinach...the possibilities are endless.  So basically I gave it a star for possibility, a star for ease, and a star for shrimp & pasta - my faves!

I thought this was really good.  I didn't have fresh basil so used teaspoon measurements instead of tablespoons.  I forgot the parm cheese to put on top but it was still good!  And it smelled great.  Used fettucine instead of angel hair and leftover grilled shrimp from a Friday night barbeque.

Not as good as good as I hoped based on other reviews, but still a solid dish that's very easy to prepare.  I didn't think there were enough tomatoes or garlic, so next time I will add more!

Based on past reviews, I tweaked the recipe by sauteing onion along with the garlic.  I also added fresh baby spinach and a splash of cream at the end.  Nice recipe that came together very quickly.

This is a really good recipe that can easily be adapted to suit your own tastes.  I've made it before as written, and tonight added some mushrooms, more garlic than called for, and used linguini.  Easy, tasty, and healthy. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this today for lunch and it turned out Excellent! Since it was just me I reduce the serving size to 2. I didn't add olive oil the pasta. Just used a little less than 1 tablespoon to cook the garlic in. For my own personnel taste I used fresh garlic and about twice what the recipe called for. Was a quick and easy meal that is perfect for us singles who need things in smaller portions.

Tasty! I like my dish more shrimp heavy so I would suggest cutting back on the pasta a little. I'll definitely make this again.

Yummi!!This recipe was very tasty.  I made a few changes with the ingredients that I had in hand.  I used penne instead of angel hair pasta.  I also didn't have italian diced tomatoes so I just used regular canned tomatoes and added italian seasonning with oregano.  I didn't use wine nor did I use basil.  The recipe still tured out amazingly good!  Make sure not to overcook the shrimps or they will become chewy.

This meal is awesome! It is so simple yet delicious enough to serve to guests. I did add a tablespoon of tomato paste, used only two cans of the 14 ounce tomatoes, added extra garlic and used the fresh basil. This is a definite keeper.

This recipe is awesome!!! I made it twice within the last week and it was great both times, even though tonight I added diced tomatoes with green chillies by mistake! It had a bit of a bite, but my toddler still gobbled it up.
The only thing I do differently is to puree the diced tomatoes a little, since I prefer my sauce less chunky. This one is a keeper!!!

I made this a few nights ago in an attempt to beat back the tide of seafood my husband keeps bringing home.  (He IS aware we only have one freezer, right?)  I used fresh herbs from my garden, which makes a world of difference -- the smell as soon as they hit the sauce was amazing, and brought my husband sniffing out of the computer room to investigate.  I used Vermicelli instead of Angel Hair because -- well, because it was what I had.  Speaking of what I had, I had no white wine, so instead I used -- wait for it -- vanilla extract.  Just a tablespoon.  Those of you who mention the lack of flavour may want to look into Kosher Salt -- it has bigger flakes and gives more bang for it's amount.  I did add some lemon juice to the shrimp -- before I cooked them -- and some cayenne powder to the sauce.  My husband raved about it, but I think it would be greatly improved by the addition of fresh tomatoes (grow, my garden, grow!) as well as the half cup of heavy cream other people have mentioned.  It's an easy dish to make that looks fancier than it really is.  Just make sure you use fresh herbs for this, because dried just won't cut it.

4 stars (because i like this dish, especially the way i make it).  but what happened to the rule of not adding grated cheese onto a seafood dish...it overwhelms the subtle taste of the seafood...in this case, shrimp.

This is such a delicious and easy recipe! I used 2 14-oz. cans of petite cut diced tomatoes with garlic and olive oil, and added a bit of red pepper flakes. I'm amazed that a dish this easy and quick to prepare can be SO delicious! I will definitely be making this often. Thanks  : )

I cooked this the other night and did use the recommendation of others and cut the tomatoes in half.  I also used cooking sherry instead of the wine.   I also used scallops along with the shrimp.  Absolutely delish.  This is so good, like something that most people would order out in a restuarant.   Thanks so much for sharing this great recipe with us.

really great meal and very simple to make. I've made it a few times exactly as the recipe calls for using shrimp, and also recently made it using boneless skinless chicken breasts instead and adding mushrooms and onions at the same time as the garlic. It's turned out delicious every time!

This dish was absolutely delicious!! I used (3) 14 oz cans diced italian tomatoes (drained one) I then added 1/4 cup of heavy cream, 3 tablespoons tomato paste, red chili flakes and salt and pepper to taste as another reviewer suggested. This was easy to prepare and tasted like gourmet italian. Awesome, will be making this again and again.

I thought this recipe was quite boring and had nothing special to it. I can make a much better pasta when just thrown together. I thought the parsley was over powering and the sauce had no substance to it, as it would not stick to the noodles. If you want good pasta try the Cajun seafood pasta recipe!

Following the suggestion of others, I used frozen pre-cooked shrimp, 28 oz. of diced tomatoes (undrained), added 1 cup heavy cream, red pepper flakes (which really "took this recipe to the top", according to my husband), and italian seasoning. I also used 3 garlic cloves (yielding about 2 tablespoons of chopped garlic)and dried parsley. (All other ingredients followed the recipe.) I simmered the sauce for at least 20 minutes to reduce the liquid and served on a bed of angel hair and it was fabulous! This is a definite "keeper" and I'll be making it again very soon.

This dish was tasty and super easy to make.  I used crushed tomatoes instead of diced, because my husband likes a smoother sauce and I also added crushed red pepper.  Next time, I will add more garlic.

Fabulous!! I accidently forgot to drain the tomatoes, but a little extra simmering solved the problem. I left out the white wine and took another reviewers suggestion and added 1/3 c. of heavy cream. I used all dry herbs, added extra garlic and some italian seasonings. I really think that it was the cream that put this dish over the top. It was a nice texture and stuck to the angel hair well. I also thought that some cut up asparagus would taste nicely mixed in. Perhaps next time... whatever you do, I don't think you can go wrong with this wonderful recipe!

My Dad and I really enjoyed this, my younger brother wasn't too keen on the tomatoes or the shrimp, but he did like the taste of the pasta. The only thing that I changed about this recipe was to use fettucine regate instead of angel hair. This was great with garlic bread, and I can't wait to make it again!

Awesome recipe.  Very fast and easy to make. There are only two of us so I scaled the recipe down to 2.  And, I used an entire 12 ounce bag of frozen, cooked shrimp.  I defrosted the shrimp in water and then threw them into the sauce the last 3 minutes it was cooking just to warm them up. I used Linguini instead of the Angel Hair... The sauce stuck to it really well.   Use the italian style tomatoes, adds a lot of additional flavor! Enjoy!

Excellent, quick and easy.  This will be a regular meal in our household.  Garnished with additional basil it's impressive enough to serve to guests with a nice bottle of wine.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This Pasta was delicious - I have made it several times allready.  I did not have fresh parsley or basil on hand so I used dried parsley & basil and also added a Tablespoon of Italian seasonings since I only had plain diced tomatoes. Have also served the sauce with fettucine.  A real keeper!!

This was so delicious that I want back seconds. I added a pound and half of shrimp and extra teaspoon of fresh garlic. I will definitely add this one to my menu lineup for Sunday Dinners.

This dish is easy to prepare and tastes great.  The tomatoes were a bit much.  I think next time I make it I will only use half the tomatoes and add some fresh zucchini and yellow squash.

Very healthy & good.  Had to use frozen, cooked shrimp (all we have in our area) so I thawed them & added them after sauce was done.  Also had to use dried basil, about 1 tsp.) I pureed the tomatoes instead of draining them just cooked the sauce down till the correct thickness.  Thank you for that recipe.

Very good recipe.  I added 2 Tablespoons of tomato paste and wish I hadn't.  Made it out of things on hand, instead of wine I added some tequila and although it smelled sorta bad cooking it wasn't bad eating.  It needed more zing, maybe some lime?  Probably would have been better with wine.  Easy and fast, I will make again.

I think it's the wine and the fresh herbs that make this taste like it came from the kitchen of a fancy resturant! I loved it.  The aroma of this dish was fantastic.

Wow! This dish is amazing. I didn't think it would be this good since the ingredients seemed kind of simple but it was terrific. I definitely recommend using raw shrimp instead of previously cooked or bagged frozen shrimp. Make sure you don't overcook it too. When shrimp is cooked just right it tastes so much better and has that nice crunch when you bite into it. Use a dry white wine as recommended too. This recipe was perfect. We just added a bit more shrimp and I had the leftovers for lunch the following day.

I don't know what all the hype is over this recipe. I thought it was very boring and bland - I even added a ton of extra garlic and salt. It looks a lot better than it tastes.

I definately have to say that this is a fantastic dish! I had some fresh herbs and was looking for a recipe and this caught my eye. I doubled the garlic and use 1 28oz. can of tomatoes and it was awesome! My husband and I loved it, especially with the fresh grated parmesan cheese. I never deveined shrimp before which is quite a process,  but besides that very easy to make! Thank you!

Yum, this was such an easy and healthy meal! (my favorite kind to make) The only change I made was adding chicken broth instead of wine (I was out). It still turned out great. Will make again.

Unbelievable! Out of all 3 kids, each one of them LOVED this recipe!! The youngest even said "you need to make this more often". I substituted the alcohol for chicken broth and only used two (14 oz.) cans of diced tomatoes. What a great find!!

We thought the shrimp was great, but the sauce was bland.

As best as I can remember, this is my absolute favorite quick, delicious, meal-in-minutes recipe from this site. In a hurry, I use previously cooked shrimp, and throw it in at the end. Doesn't even make a huge difference in the taste. I don't even think my hubby has a clue as to how very quickly I make this!

This recipe was jolly good.  There was a couple of things that I changed. I added more Garlic and Shrimp.  I also put less tomatoes and added tomato soup to thicken it up more.

Delicious!  Wish I'd read the reviews before making the recipe, though -- because I would have cut the tomatoes in half.  There is definitely a misprint; one 28 oz can or 2 - 14oz cans is what is needed.  So I had too much tomato, but it was still wonderful.  Definitely a keeper.

This was a very simple & delicious dish!  I had to scale it back to one serving but it was still delicious!  I added crushed red pepper & substituted spaghetti squash for the angel hair pasta (get some veggies in there & low carbs).  Yummy, yummy!

I thought that this was delicious.  Next time I will probably use just one can of the italian diced tomatoes, and substitute either tomato paste or crushed tomatoes.  The sauce just wastn't thick enough for us even though I simmered it for about 15 minutes.  You can also omit the basil if you really don't like it.  Overall I thought the flavor was excellent, but would have liked to see a thicker sauce.  Thanks Pat!!

I subbed the wine with rice vinegar for a non-alcoholic dish.  The flavor of the shrimp was exquisite. I used 3 cloves of minced garlic.

This was OK. I think it had waaaay too much basil and parsley. Maybe adding lemon juice and butter,and cutting down on the parsley and basil would help. I will probably make this again with the changes suggested. ***Note...do not used dried basil! Go for the fresh kind found in the produce section!***

This was really good, I took suggestions and added my own. I used diced roasted garlic tomatoes with the juice, cut down on the olive oil,added onion powder and garlic powder to taste, and flour to thicken the sauce. very tasty.

Delicious and simple to make.  It was done in less than a half hour.  
Pretty suitable for even the pickiest of eaters. 
Makes enough to feed 4 very hungry people.
I doubled all the seasonings for extra taste.

I can't figure out why this recipe got so many rave reviews. I'm a big shrimpa and garlic fan so it sounded good and it was okay but nothing spectacular. I might try it again, though, and make some variations.

Easy and yummy!  Used Romano instead of Parmessan (and doubled the amount of cheese).  Also used fresh tomatoes instead of canned.  I think the fresh tomatoes and fresh spices made a big difference.

I did not care for this recipe at all.  It was way too shrimpy for my taste.  (However, I am willing to concede that the shrimp I purchased from the grocery may not have been the freshest).  At any rate, I was less than pleased with the result and will not be taking any chances by attempting to make it again.

This recipe was easy and good, perfect for an 'after work day' meal.  I added a small can of tomato sauce as we prefer 'saucier' pasta.  All in all, a success.

What a wonderful dish to prepare for company!   The flavors of the shrimp, tomatoes and basil compliment each other so nicely. This dish is also a treat for the eye as it is very colorful, and looks like it came off the cover of a cooking magazine. Thank you Pat for making me look like a gourmet chef.

This was fantastic!  I couldn't find fresh basil, so I used freeze dried instead.  I used 2 14 oz cans of tomatoes instead of 28 oz cans, and that was plenty for 2 of us.  I will definately make this again!

I just finished making this recipe for my son and I.  When I brought it out to the table my son said "Wow, that looks awsome"  he then proceeded to devour the entire plate. I myself thought that this was an excellent dish that didn't take very long to make.  I didn't have the white wine so I substituted a little red.  I used precooked shrimp but next time I will use fresh shrimp.  I think this is a meal you could serve to company with a side salad and some garlic bread and everyone would be very impressed.  Thanks Pat for a great recipe.

This was very tasty and so easy to make.  I didn't drain much of the juice off the tomatoes.  I just let it cook down a little more.  Gave it a nice tomato taste.  I would recommend using nearly a lb. of pasta, there just didn't seem to be enough to go around.  Also, I would cook the pasta up last, while the sauce is thickening.  I prepared it first, like the recipe stated, then it sat around for at least a 1/2 hr.  Got a little gummy.  Definitely a keeper, though!

Excellent - wouldn't change a thing.  But we did add extra garlic (4 cloves) & it wasn't overpowering at all.

Delicious!!  I used mexican style diced tomatoes because I like the heat from the chiles.  The sauce was a little watery...it didn't really reduce like it was supposed to.  I think next time I'll drain about a cup of the juice from the diced tomatoes and add some mushrooms!!

I didn't use wine.  Instead of fresh herbs I used dried.  I also used soybean oil instead of olive oil.  This dish still tasted excellent.  The best shrimp pasta dish I've every had.  As for the sauce being runny... Just simmer longer, it will reduce.

This was a very delicious recipe.  I used baby shrimp (cocktail shrimp) for this however.  I think next time i will add in a can of tomatoe paste, I like a thicker sauce with this recipe.  Yum!

I made this for our friends and get this..one of them doesn't like cooked shrimp and the other doesn't like fresh tomatos.  (I didn't know) Well, they both decided to try the meal and wouldn't you know it...They loved it and actually asked for the recipe.

My husband said this is in the "TOP 3" best recipes that I have ever made!  My neighbors loved it too!  I added a little heavy cream as well.  Also I added a tablespoon of flour to a little cold water, mixed it and added it to the sauce in the end, thickening it.. We had to make sure we enjoyed this right down to the last drop!!

This recipe was awesome.  The fresh herbs and wine certainly make the recipe.  Be sure you DO use fresh parmesan cheese.  This dish is not only great it's relatively light and healthy.  The olive oil is good for you and if you don't eat too much pasta this would be a good healthy dish for a dieter as well.

This recipe was awesome!  I added an onion, used shell pasta and used shrimp that were already shelled and cooked. I just added the shrimp to the sauce at the very end.  The sauce was just right for the shrimp--not too heavy or overpowering.  I will definitely make this again!

This recipe is totally great!! I LOVE to cook, and am very picky when it comes to recipes... but this was awesome!!!  I used 3 (14.5) cans of tomatoes, added some oregano and dried basil to them, also added some portabello mushrooms and 1/2 each of red and green pepper sliced in thin strips.  Made an herb parmasan bread to go with it, served with salad with dill vinagrette dressing (also listed on here) over a mediterranean salad mix.... served 6 people... and got RAVING reviews... was totally awesome!! PLEASE try this recipe!  Add to it, it's great, I also added a few crushed red pepper flakes on top of each plate once served... loved it!  Thanks so much!

Very yummy!  My husband liked it as-is, but it was a little too tomato-y for me.  Next time I will either double the shrimp or reduce the tomatoes.  Delicious and easy none-the-less!

I found this dish to be nothing special.  I did use the recommendations made in other reviews.  I think the sauce might've been a little heavy for shrimp.  Regardless, the flavor just didn't blow me away.

This was a very tasty recipe and the smell while cooking was delicious.  I used two cans of diced tomatoes and half a can of tomato paste to thicken it up a little.  I added some extra garlic as other recommended and also added some mushrooms and added a dash of red pepper flakes.  Makes tons.  Great!  Everyone loved it!!!

Excellent recipe.  Easy to make, and the whole family enjoyed it, everyone from age 2 to 84.  I had to use a bigger pan for the tomato mixture though.  Thanks for submitting this recipe.  Excellent.

This was a delicious and very quick meal. I used whole tomatoes, which I chopped, packed in tomato juice. I only used about 1/4 of the juice. I substituted about 1/4 cup pesto for the basil and parmesan, and sprinkled a little fresh parmesan on top. Wonderful!

I used 2 regular diced tomatoes for the 4 stewed tomatoes and it was plenty.I
also did not use all the oil , 1 T. in pasta, and two T. in saute pan, also plenty.
Excellent flavor, would be equally great w/o the shrimp.

While this recipe does deliver an excellent taste and quick prep, the four (4) cans of tomatoes could be substituted with two (2) cans of recipe ready chopped tomatoes.

The 4 cans of stewed tomatoes (which seemed to be too much to me from the beginning but I decided to follow the recipe), watered the recipe down and made it less flavorful.  Also, the liquid in the recipe did not cook down (as was stated) and made the final sauce runny.  It was fairly tasty, but I'm sure I'd make it again - at least not without some changes.

I made this meal for my parents the other night and they loved it. I used 1 can of stewed tomatoes and about 7 or 8 fresh 
tomatoes. I used more fresh basil and parsley than was called for and instead of putting the shrimp into the sauce I put them on top of the pasta and sauce after they had been served so that their flavor really stood out from the rest of the dish. The parmesan was a definite plus!

We love shrimp and pasta and so this was a fantastic combination!  I marked "Kids Love it" even though my kids are grown, but I think if your kids enjoy shrimp they will love this.

Quick & easy. Nice, light meal with good flavors.  Increased minced garlic (x3), and added chopped onion, mushrooms and Greek olives (all sautéd lightly in olive oil). Also added extra spices (dried Italian spice, thyme, salt, black pepper). Didn't  have wine, but substituted red wine vinegar and a little sugar. Would have rated recipe a 5, but it was a bit bland without the additions.

This dish has become known as “Christmas Eve Pasta” in my home because 5 years ago I made this dish, and everyone was crazy about it. Simple, fresh ingredients, and so easy to make: don’t let the simple nature of this recipe make you think it’s not a dish for special occasions. Exactly the opposite! My family likes to serve feta cheese at the table to add if you want, instead of, or in addition to, the parm cheese. We also make seared scallops as an option to add to the dish & serve at the table (because thats my Moms fave seafood). Thank you to whoever shared this recipe....it’s become a Christmas tradition, along wih a nice salad, crusty toasted sourdough bread for mopping, and if you have picky kids (like I do) I just make extra pasta & serve them simple spaghetti, noodles with butter and parm or noodles w/ a store bought fettuccine sauce.

This was excellent and so easy!  I accidentally used a can of crushed tomatoes because I didn't read the recipe right!  Anyway, it turned out great!  I added Italian seasoning, and a teaspoon of sugar, salt and fresh ground pepper.  I halved the recipe.  Delish!

VERY good recipe. The flavors were well balanced and vibrant. Fresh herbs are an absolute with this recipe. The only things I changed was due to personal preference--I added more garlic and I didn't cook the shrimp as long as the recipe called for as they get rubbery, in my opinion.  My family will enjoy this one over and over.

Left out the tomatoes, added lemon juice, asparagus, no brocolli and some garlic and herb cream cheese to the sauce, was delicious.   Added canned 2%milk to the sauce instead of cream.  Used a 2 pound package of very large shrimp .  Will make this dish again

I followed the recipe exactly plus I added 1/2 cup of half and half before adding the shrimp back into the tomato sauce - just to increase the richness of the dish.  It was delicious!  Thanks for the yummy recipe!

I made this exactly as the recipe stated but other than the fact that it is fast and easy to make, I didn't find the taste that good.  It was OK but certainly didn't live up to the reviews that some people gave it.  I think if I had used fresh tomatoes it would have tasted better but then it would not be as fast!

Delicious! Followed the recipe exactly but for the tomatoes -- if using less than a pound of pasta you will only need 1- 28 oz can of tomatoes.  I used 2 -14.5oz cans - one was "fire roasted," which I definitely recommend.  Hubby & I loved this... it's a perfect, 'quick & easy' midweek meal.

It was wonderful!  . I omitted the white wine and used home made chicken stock. I also used fresh grape tomatoes instead of canned diced... only because I didn't have any canned on hand.  And I added an 8oz grilled barramundi.  I will definitely be making it again.

This was delicious and easy to prepare.  However, I felt that a little more liquid was needed to coat the pasta since you are using chopped tomatoes rather than sauce.

I was glad shrimp was on sale at my local grocery store because for my family this can be kind of pricey.  I have 4 boys and myself so I had to triple this recipe.  I had to buy a who basil plant as well because my grocery store was out of fresh cut basil.  With that said, My family loved it.   The flavors melded wonderfully and I will be making this again but just for me and my husband.

Liked the dish a lot. Next time I'll reduce the suggested amount of parsley as the heavy dark color reduced the presentation appeal. Otherwise easy enough to prepare but needs additional seasoning.

Nice, light dish that isn't overpowered with sauce. I actually didn't have basil so I improvised and used fresh cilantro. It turned out really well.

Great recipe i made it almost exactly to the provided recipe. I added just a little more garlic, salt, black pepper, and some red pepper. I also through in a pound of mussels. Im glad i did because because 1 lb of shrimp is not enough. If you do not want to add mussels i would recommend 2 lbs of shrimp because there are alot of tomatoes. Otherwise, its excellent.

Wow! I didn't expect it would be this good. I used bucatini, instead of angel hair, and I used one fresh tomato, diced, and a can of diced tomatoes. Just perfect!

This was excellent, but I did make changes out of necessity and choice. Used chicken stock instead of wine because for once I didn't have any. I sauteed some mushrooms in butter and olive oil and added after sauteing garlic. Used one can of Rotelle tomatoes because I didn't have any Italian style. Increased basil to 1/4 cup and parm to almost 1/2 cup. I used 1/8 cup dried parsley.  Put shrimp in for about 3 minutes after cooking down the sauce. Will definitely make again and I apologize for rating based on all the changes.

Made this dish because our basil was ready to use.  It was delicious!  The only change I made was I used one can of tomatoes instead of two.  28 ounces is plenty for this recipe.

This recipe was a delicious and quick weeknight dinner!  After sauteeing the shrimp, I used the wine to deglaze the pan first,  then added the tomato sauce.  I also waited until the very end to add the fresh herbs, and sauteed the pasta with the sauce.  Turned out great and I will definitely make it again!

This is awesome. "Better than a restaurant', was my boyfriends opinion... As other reviewers advised, I used just one can of tomatoes, and added the fresh parsley and basil at the very end. I also added just a shake of crushed red pepper flakes. I didn't reduce it quite the amount of time it indicated, but we like things a little 'soupy'. Also added mushrooms because we like them! Really really good!

I really enjoyed this and have added it to my favorites. I only used half the diced tomatoes (which was plenty for me) and no Parmesan. Next time I'm going to try it with fresh tomatoes for an extra healthy dish.

Simple but delicious meal.  If you like straight forward Italian food this is a must have.  I only made enough for my wife and I but I can see this would be a great dish to whip up for a crowd.

The first time I made it as listed. It didn't have enough flavor. So the second time I made it I added fresh oregano and less fresh parsley. It came out great and was a big hit with my guests. I will make it again. I may add fresh thyme next time

Made it exactly to the recipe and found it a little unexciting. Slightly bland, and if I make this again I will  pump up the spices a bit and omit the shrimp as I didn't enjoy them so much in this dish. Just MEH.

I used 2 pounds of shrimp, one 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes with basil garlic and oregano, a cup of fresh basil, sliced mushrooms, a lot of garlic and a bunch of fresh yellow pear tomatoes.  Didn't have parsley, followed the rest of the directions and ingredients.  It was yummy!

Will definitely make again. . Added a few extra spices since the recipe seemed a bit bland (Emerils essence and a dash of italian seasoning ).  Doubled up on the garlic but I also marinated the shrimp in diced garlic to let the flavor soak even further.  As for the tomatoes, I only used a can and a half. Nice and light recipe! Thanks for the great dinner idea!

I made the recipe as written, except cut back on the tomatoes based on the reviews. Wish I hadn't because the sauce doesn't stick to the pasta. Next time I will try it with a basic marinara sauce. Shrimp was yummy

Could not give this 5 stars as the amounts listed were just too crazy.  Overall the flavor was delicious. Cut back on tomatoes (like 1 can), added some sauce I had in the frig, and cut the parsley and basil in half.  Then it was tasty. Someone mentioned spinach. I think that or arugula may be quite nice in it too

I started with a garlic butter wine sauce previously presented on Allrecipies, then added basil and parsley. I let that simmer for a few minutes then added the tomatoes. Delicious and I will make it again.

This is very tasty. I'm not sure if the recipe meant for two 28 ounce cans of diced tomatoes or two cans equaling up to 28 ounces but I did just one can.  I think two cans would have been way too much. We really like shrimp so I will add another ounce or two of it when I make this recipe again.

I was so disappointed with this recipe.  With the wonderful ingredients it should have been quite tasty, and it was actually rather bland.  I even added a little extra garlic.  It might have been okay without the pasta to dilute it.  I won't be trying it again!

Loved this recipe!  I used 3-14oz cans of tomatoes instead of 2-28 oz cans.  I doubled the amount of shrimp and added salt, pepper and a little onion powder.  Delicious!  Will definitely add this to my go-to meals!

Saute a small chopped onion in the EVO until transparent, then add approximately 5-6 sliced fresh garlic.  Cook for approximately 1-2 minutes.  Add less canned tomato (whole canned tomato broken up and squeezed). Then add wine, parsley, basil and a pinch of cayenne pepper.  Cook all together for about 20-30 minutes.  This change makes it more Italian.  Don't forget a good grated cheese if desired.  (Although you are not suppose to put grated cheese on Seafood.)   Do NOT add olive oil to the pasta water.  That is so wrong.  Just add a good tablespoon of salt.  The sauce need to adhere to the pasta....not slide off.  Do NOT rinse the pasta.  OMG!!

I never rinse the pasta..and the only thing I put into the water besides the pasta is a bit of salt....doubled the garlic and tomatoes.. And toss the pasta right into the mix at the end....add a little of the pasta water.....(ya don't toss it down the drain)..to make it a bit creamier....

Mmmmmm, so good!  I used two 14 oz cans of tomatoes and that was plenty. Really good flavors in this, thanks for sharing.   Oh, and I didn't drain the tomatoes.  I think that's a misprint.

Tweaked the recipe just a little. Used 2 pounds of shrimp, 2 15 oz cans of fire roasted tomatoes, undrained, added 2 scallions and some red pepper flakes. Did not put shrimp in until last three minutes of simmer and added them straight to the sauce. Was wonderful. Will definitely make this again and again.

Wonderful! I made this for myself, thinking my husband isn't much on pasta unless it has a meat sauce (homemade).  He did taste mine and loved it.  So, I had to share.  I did use only half the amount of tomatoes and added red pepper flakes.  So good!

This was ok really just about sums it up.  For some reason my "sauce" seemed a little on the sweet side, and I wasn't really a fan.  It was super easy and quick to make, and I did love that part of it, but I probably won't make again.

This recipe needs a lot of work. Strangely enough, even with the parsley, garlic, wine and basil it was so bland. My family gave it a 1 out of 10 and my son said: "Sorry mom, I'm going to suck it up and eat it, even though I hate it." And he did eat it, but only after I smothered it in Parmesan.  I give it a 3 out of 10 and I'm being generous only because I think it has potential. It's a pretty dish, but it needs more flavor.

OMG! 
this pasta was amazing!! 
(& I am a huge pasta maker & lover) 
and boy, I did not think it was going to turn out as well as it did! I only used 3 cans of the Italian tomatoes, and put more garlic in the pan with the shrimp than called for, we usually make our shrimp with butter and garlic so I knew that they would turn out great with more garlic. I had never tried the Italian tomatoes, but I think that's what "made" the recipe! the tomatoes were so full of flavor, the pasta went perfectly with bbqed moscato wine chicken and grilled squash veggies! 
thank so much for sharing this, my family loved it!

Tasty, although not a ton of flavour.  May try serving over spaghetti squash instead of pasta next time.  Added yellow zucchini (corgette) and red pepper with the tomatoes when simmering and some spinach about 2 minutes before serving.  I had cooked the shrimp with a little lemon juice - probably won't do that next time (or would add milk at the end to cut the acidity).  Served with hot sauce and freshly grated parmesan cheese.

My family loves this pasta (especially during the summer). I have made it many times. I used dry basil as it is hard to get fresh basil where I live. I used white cooking wine because we were out of the kind you would drink. Omitted the shrimp and served it as a side to other seafood dishes although it's great with the shrimp too. Tasted great. Very light and flavorful.

I love the flavors in this dish, and my whole family loves it.  I shared it with other family members, and they have raved about it, too.
It's a great alternative to the higher calorie pasta dishes that use heavy sauces.
I first saw this recipe years ago, and have made it many times.  It's also great cold the next day!

I am a beginner cook and this was a great recipe. I followed other revieweres suggestions and added more shrimp, substituted dried basil for fresh (in case you don't have any) and add more diced tomatoes if you are "saucy". I like red pepper flakes to season when it's done as well.

Hubby loved this one!  I only used one can of diced italian style tomatoes bc that's all I had on hand, but it worked out fine.  I am definitely a beginner cook, and it was easy enough to throw together pretty quickly.  I also agree with other reviewers that 8 oz of pasta wasn't enough for the amt of sauce.

Awesome! I followed the recipe to a T, except I doubled the garlic and added about 1/4 teaspoon of chili flakes. The entire family, including the picky eating kids, gobbled this up. Will definitely make again.

I had to change a few things about this recipe.  I tasted it as is and had to add more garlic and red wine.  I would recommend to double, or even triple, the garlic, and substitute red for white wine.

cut tomatoes in half and still a bit much.  more than doubled garlic = perfect.  added a little bit of heavy cream (under 1/4 cup).  hubby loved it.  kids ate shrimp w/o sauce over pasta.  Made a second time with no cream, 3 cans of 12 ounce tomatoes and extra garlic.  yummy

Excellent and very easy to make.  Very good with some red pepper flakes to spice it up a bit.  Watch out because if you make 4 servings, it will really make like 8.  HUGE servings!

I wouldn't have tried this recipe on my own...the thought of tomato sauce and shrimp didn't appeal to me.  But I tried it out because of the high reviews and the fact that I had all the ingredients on hand.  It was fantastic!  The fresh herbs really made this taste fresh.

Very good! I did use less oil and more garlic than called for. I think the amount of tomatoes could be reduced a little; I used 3 14.5 oz cans and still found it to be a bit much. Love the flavor from the fresh herbs. Thanks :)

Easy to make with items in the pantry and freezer.  A little fresh basil and it's done.  I skipped the parsley and reduced oil to 2T and it was plenty.  Oil in the pasta is not necessary.  Just added a spoonful of sauce to the pasta after drained to keep it from sticking.  1 T of evoo has about 150 calories.  Why add it when it's not necessary.  My kids loved it!

My son and husband enjoyed this more than I did.  I found it to be a little bland.  I only had three 14.5 oz cans of tomatoes so that's what I used and I think that was plenty.  I will make this again and just try adding some spices to the sauce.  Also, any italian will tell you that you NEVER put cheese on seafood pasta dishes so I skipped the cheese.

This dish is so flavorful and is a nice change to doing just the same old tomato based pasta dish.  This is a great dish for people to feed their family of picky eaters.

Very good!  I didn't have fresh basil, so I used 1 Tbsp. dried.  I realized that I bought 14.5 oz. cans of tomatoes, instead of 28 oz., but it stilled turned out great.  Just enough tomatoes without overpowering the shrimp.

Very good recipe.  I make macaroni & sauce every Sunday so I was looking for a little something to liven it up.  The white wine was an excellent addition.  I used crushed tomatoes though, only 1 can and it was more than enough.  I also added parsley and a chopped onion.  I cooked the shrimp at the same time the pasta & sauce were cooking because I didn't want them getting overcooked.  I can't wait to eat the leftovers today!

This is an excellent base of a recipe. I didn't have dry white wine, so I tried Balsamic Vinegar instead and it was great. Added some Romano cheese and onion, and it took me a bit longer to cook then suggested, but all-in-all it's wonderful.

This dish was okay. It didn't have as much flavor as I thought it would with the basil and parsley. I'd be willing to give it another try with some adjustments.

My wife and I found this one quite delicious. We are expecting our second child right now and this was one of those recipes that fulfilled my wife's cravings. I fekt it could have used another pound of shrimp as well but otherwise we found it quite tasty. Really hit the spot!

Fantastic recipe! Thanks!  Some tweaks: I used a whole small bulb of garlic, 2 lbs of shrimp as suggested by another reviewer, doubled the basil, halved the parsley, used a 1/2 cup chicken stock instead of wine as suggested by another reviewer, user only one can of diced tomatoes as suggested, and I added a bit of cilantro (

This was really good.  I didn't change a thing, except I added the raw shrimp at the end and cooked it for a few minutes.  It was perfect.  Thanks.  Will make this again.

Have made a similar recipe to this for many years but never use Italian style tomatoes because I find it is better to season my own.   This is personal taste. Have never served with angel hair pasta so will try it, but have served it with rice.

This was so delicious. I doubled the recipe for my family of four as they are all big eaters, and was afraid after I made it there would be alot of leftovers because it was ALOT of food. However, not one drop was left!!! Even the most picky member of our family said that I could cook it anytime, after he got his third serving. I used two bags of medium frozed shrimp instead of large, and instead of italian style tomatoes I used diced tomatoes with green chiles to give it the perfect kick. SO SO GOOD!

YUMMMY! I only used one can of tomatoes, and it was plenty. I also added in a 1/4 cup of cream. I added in the shrimp while the sauce was reducing and it turned out perfect.

Delish!  I used 3 cans of Italian tomatoes (drained 2), 5 cloves garlic, 2/3 lb pasta, and a pinch of red pepper flakes.  Big hit for my parent's anniversary dinner.  Will be making again:)

Exceptional! Very good recipe. Have made many shrimp and pasta dishes and I think the addition of the white wine makes this so good.  The wine seems to take the "bite" out of the tomatoes.

No doubt my hubby would have given this one 5 stars.  He adored it.  I thought it was good, but not great.  I only had two 14.5 oz. cans of diced tomatoes, so I used those along with a 28-oz. can of traditional spaghetti sauce.  I thought the tomato flavor somewhat overwhelmed the garlic and basil.  Wish I had added more.  That said, I do think I will make this again.

This was a nice meal - easy to prepare, looks nice, satisfying taste. I did add additional seasoning - more basil, some oregano, and more garlic. Definitely will make again, but need to work on thickening up the sauce. Mine was a bit watery, which might have been a function of not draining the tomatoes enough.

Loved this recipe! I used two 14oz. cans of diced tomatoes and didn't add the (pre-cooked) shrimp until the last step as suggested by other commenters. I also added some dry minced onion and, about five minutes before serving, a 5oz. package of fresh spinach. Delicious and tastes so fresh!

I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and I doubled the pasta, garlic and shrimp.  I also did not add the shrimp during step 2, I added it to the simmering sauce in step 3.  Overall this recipe was quick, easy and tasty!  Thanks PAL  :)

This was fantastic. I used 2 large and 1 very small clove of garlic, pressed.  Only 2 15 oz cans of diced tomatoes, plain, undrained.  Only used a sprinkle of shredded parmesan on plated servings.

This was very tasty; I did not add wine and instead, did not drain the juice from the cans of tomatoes.  I also added some snow peas and used dried basil since I did not have fresh and it still was very good. I will make this again.

Made this last night for dinner, we absolutely loved it. I am always looking for an easy, fresh pasta recipe. The only thing I changed was used bow tie pasta. I would not exclude the white wine, I actually just used the rest of some pinot grigio I had in the fridge and in my opinion it makes the dish as delicious as it is. Wish there were leftovers!

I couldn't believe how good this was considering it was so easy to prepare.  I used already cooked shrimp and added it at the end and also halved the amount of tomatoes and added red pepper flakes as other reviewers suggested.  It was delicious!

Wonderful recipe!  The whole family loved it, including a 2 year old a 4 year old and a meat and potatoes husband. Better than my usual shrimp and pasta recipe. I did add 1 tsp crushed red pepper flakes to the garlic and a Tablspoon of lemon juice to the sauce. Cant wait to make it again.  Delicious.

I was excited about this recipe due to the reviews. I like the way the recipe is put together, we didn't find it to be very flavorful.  I followed the recipe although I used 2 14.5 ounce cans of "Italian Recipe" stewed tomatoes.  I will try again and spice it up a bit.

This was good and tasty.  I gave it four stars though because 1) I added a little salt and pepper to taste and 2) I ended up adding back the tomato liquid to the reduction.  I thought it was too dry as it was cooking for our tastes (I have two kids (and a husband) who wouldn't just eat the chunky tomatoes -- they need sauce).  But fresh parsley and basil and extra garlic, as other reviewers mentioned, made it very flavorful.

My husband has declared this his "favorite" recipe! I cooked the shrimp and garlic as instructed, and then put everything in the crockpot on low for about 6 hours. I also added a little heavy whipping cream at the end to thicken it up a bit. It was delicious!! My husband even took it to work and one of his co-workers ate it and loved it! Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful and easy. I added a ton more garlic, red pepper flakes and a couple of tablespoons of lemon juice.  I didn't use the tomatoes, and we did sprinkle some parmesan on top before serving, even though normally Italian seafood dishes don't have cheese- we just love it!  The fresh basil is what makes this dish!

I wish I'd read the review first. Made this for the 2nd time and thought it a bit bland and watery..again. It might be my fault, because i used dried basil instead of fresh.  And added garlic fiesta seasoning and cream in addition.  It was just OK. Didn't keep the leftovers. Would really benefit from the hot chili flakes and more seasoning to kick it up.

I don't eat shrimp and was looking for a recipe to make for my husband. This was relatively easy to make. I made it just like it said since I don't care for shrimp I couldn't taste it. My husband  loves this and now even shares it with our 4 yr. old. Thanks for the recipe!

GREAT! Made as instructed but added 2 tbs tomato paste, a tbs sugar, 1/4 cup marinara, and a dash of salt and pepper.  It was a big hit!

Everyone in my family (including ages 8 and 5) liked this recipe. The only real work being to snip the parsley with poultry shears and chop a bit of basil, I found this an easy recipe for the outcome. Liked it done the way the recipe reads, but will also try some of the other suggestions (adding cream; trying the sauce with chicken; adding some spicy spices). Thanks for the great recipe.

This was the easiest pasta dish I have ever made.  My husband loved it!!! I did make some alterations, not a big garlic fan, so I used garlic powder to give the shrimp flavor, I also added some chicken. But overall, it was a big hit.

This is simply delish.  My partner and I love spicy food, so I added pepper, chili flakes and sweet paprika to the tomato mix.  These gave a nice bite to the sauce.

This recipe is fantastic! I had to make dinner in less then an hour and this was a definite winner. I added garlic salt to give it a little more flavor. Don't be afraid to add a little bit of salt and pepper at the end according to your taste. It was a definite 5 stars! Thanks for sharing!

Really liked this recipe, easy to do. Followed previous comments, used (2)14 oz. cans of tomatoes, and lightly drained. Also was very careful about quick cook time with prawns.
Also did this with a half recipe, and used pre-cooked frozen shrimp. Cooked them about 1 minute in the garlic, pulled them, added the tomatoes, etc. and let that step really warm them up. Preferred un-cooked shrimp, but if you keep cooking time to a minimum, pre-cooked can work in a pinch. Fresh basil adds a lot of flavor!

This was very good and super easy to make! I used only two 14.5 oz cans of tomatoes as many others recommended and dried basil because I didn't have any fresh stuff.  I also added red pepper flakes and Italian seasoning to give it more flavor.  I then used whole wheat linguini and the sauce stuck fine.  Make sure to let the sauce reduce by half so it's a little thicker, that way it will stick to the pasta better.  My husband loved it and went back for seconds.  I will definately make this again!

Fabulous! A gourmet meal for a Monday night.  The delicate flavors amazed even my husband, a picky eater at best. A single can of tomatoes  will do, there was at least a single can leftover on the serving platter. I advise all the other reviewers to try the recipe by the book.  It left my husband and daughter fighting for the last shrimp!! A must try, Thanks Pat.

This was very tasty, it had more flavor than I expected.  I used what I had at home, so I used one can of plain diced tomatoes and chopped up two small tomatoes then seasoned them with oregano, salt and pepper.  I also used dried parsley and basil and pre-grated parmesan.  Very quick and easy, it will go in my recipe folder for sure.

Tasty and easy!  My rating is based on a few changes.  Used linguine.  For tomatoes, used 1 28 oz can, 1 14-oz can and a can of tom paste.  Threw a tbl. of Italian seasoning  and 1/2 tsp of garlic salt in because mine weren't seasoned toms. As another suggested, put fresh basil in late with shrimp. Enough sauce for 6 easily.  My hubby finished his and asked, "Is there MORE?"  Enough said!

Made this for dinner tonight.Although the sauce didnt stick to the pasta, the pasta suprisingly still had good flavor. After reading the reviews i decided not to use any oil in the dish , thinking that was the reason why sauce didnt stick to pasta (that ended up NOT being the case)However i was pleased with the results. I poured the tomatoes in pot,added garlic to the tomatoes,and simmered with other ingredients.I put the raw shrimp into the sauce last 7 mins or so and end results were great.

This is just what I was looking for.  I didn't have italian tomatoes. Instead I used 2 cans of regular tomatoes and 2 cans of Rotel.  It added a little spiced, which I loved.  The only thing I would do different is add more shrimp.  That is just my own taste though.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing it! :)

Very good and easy to make...I added red pepper flakes to spice it up and used already cooked shrimp that I just threw in at the last minute to save time.

I loved this dish!  I only made half the recipe substituting the white wine with chicken broth.  I used a can of petite diced tomatoes with basil and garlic.  I also used spaghetti instead of angel hair pasta.  Served with a Caesar salad on the side.

I made this for a baby shower and it was a big hit!  We did a theme w/ the shower of serving food w/ "baby" in the name, so I used baby shrimp.  When I was cooking it at home, my husband was so jelous that I was going to be taking it to the shower, that I had to make some for him as well.

This dish was delicious!  I'm not a huge shrimp fan, but my husband loves them so I thought I'd give this a shot.  I was thrilled with how quickly it cooked - I was in and out of the kitchen easily in 30 minutes.  And the flavor was really delicious!  I probably used a little extra garlic on the shrimp, but otherwise made it exactly as directed.  A great meal for a busy weeknight.

This is an great dish.  The only problem is that it can be dry.  To fix this I increased both the olive oil and the wine by 1/2 cup each.  
Left overs are great!!

This recipe was fantastic!  My boyfriend is a bit picky sometimes but he really liked this one.  I used wheat enriched pasta to make it a bit healthier.  It was a great dish that we will definately have again!

Like some others, I added a few seasonings of my own but all in all it is a good recipe I'll be making again and again.

I loved this because it is so light.  It is in fact a light, healthy meal.  Something is definitely needed to make it a bit more tasty, though.  It's rather boring as it is, but I do believe it has potential.

It had been awhile since I tried this, and I don't know why I waited!  Even my kids were looking for 2nds!  Next time, I'll add a bit more shrimp, since that's always devoured before all the pasta.  Agree with others that there doesn't seem to be enough sauce, and too many chunks of tomato off to the side.

This recipe reminded me of something that you would order at an italian restaurant.  I loved it. I doubled the pasta to a pound so there wouldn't be so much sauce and I also addes 1/2 pund of sea scallops.  WONDERFUL!

This recipe was ok. I too used only one can of tomatoes since I don't like them that much, and previously frozen cooked shrimp. I was worried about there not being enough flavor, so I added a bunch of red chili pepper flakes and salt. My boyfriend who doesn't really like shrimp seemed to enjoy it and was surprised that there was so much flavor with such little sauce. Overall, this was pretty good. Thanks!

This was a good and healthy meal that I got compliments for.  Didn't have the white wine and used an extra 2 cloves of garlic.  The Parmesan cheese added just enough saltiness not to be overpowering.

This was a huge hit even though I didn't read the directions correctly.  I didn't saute the shrimp, but rather simmered them in the tomatoes until done.  It was still wonderful.  I also added about 1/3 cup of home made pesto in place of the basil, and omitted the parmesan cheese, since it was in the pesto.  YUM!

This recipe was very good!  It was very easy to make.  My 10 year old daughter did most of the work with this meal and she ABSOLUTELY loved it!  I am not a tomato fan and will usually eat around anything that has tomato in it.  But with this meal I was able to eat everything.  A great meal and I would definitely make it again.

This was very good. Based on other reviews, I did not add the full amount of tomatoes (just one 28oz can) and I only drained about 1/2 of the juice. I added a tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken it and it was great. I also added mushrooms. Very good recipe. Thanks!

I only give it 3 stars because I changed the recipe a lot. I was going to follow the original recipe but it tasted somehow acidic and bland at the same time, so I added a bit of Red Thai Curry paste, cream and more seasoning. It was very enjoyable but nothing extraordinary

I loved the recipe.  I have never liked tomatoes, but this was great.  My husband is the same way and totally changed his mind about tomatoes.

Definitely one to put in your recipe box!  Great basic sauce that you can personalize by changing pastas and adding additional veggies.  Tastes great and is easy to pull together once you get all ingredients.

Oh so good.  Used our own garden vine tomatoes which gave it a tangy taste.  It was light and satisfying.  Will make it again and again!

Instead of using canned tomatoes, I used fresh Roma tomatoes and used more garlic and a 1 tbsp. of sugar and a little salt to the pasta.  I only used 16 oz. of tomatoes but could have used more next time.  Will try again.

this was very good. a nice change from regular tomato sauce. i didn't rinse the pasta though. i just drizzled a little olive oil on it so the noodles wouldn't stick. i also used chicken stock instead of wine. it would be nice to try this with fresh tomatoes.

Wonderful!!!  This was a hit with everyone.  Even the 5 and 4 year old.  I was a bit nervous about cooking it as I am new to cooking shrimp so I used some previous sugestions and used precookied shrimp and just let them warm up in the sauce. I also used chicken broth instead of wine and increased the garlic(you can never have too much garlic). This is a big winner in our house.  Thank you for the recipe.

This was wonderful! This was such a nice change from your normal red sauce. I doubled the recipe and it turned out great. I have two children who do not like red sauce but they loved this. The fresh herbs really give it a great taste. We will make this over and over. Thanks for the great recipe.

I never rate recipes but felt compelled to tonight. This is an outrageous recipe. I did make a few changes but is a wonderful base, and you can change it up as you like. I tripled garlic, used extra large shrimp, cooked just till it turned pink. The sauce is where variation comes in. Used 1 28 oz. can tomatoes with italian seasonings. 1/2 can tomato paste and all fresh seasonings. Threw in some red pepper flakes, salt, sugar, pepper and a bit of Fat-free-half in half. Served over fettuccini with ridges......outstanding! Company loved it and asked for recipe. I would say fresh herbs are imperative! Thanks so much for this dish!:)

Everyone loved this recipe. I added portabello mushrooms, green onions, yellow bell peppers, and a can of tomato puree. I (as other readers did) used only half of the tomatoes listed in the recipe. I added lots more garlic. I will make this again.

Wow!!!  This recipe is incredible.  Even my 9 year old daughter can make this, and is a whole meal ... just add salad!  My friends often call my daughter to ask when she's making this recipe again.  I have shared this recipe with many friends because of it's simplicity and wonderful blend of flavors.

I really wanted to try this recipe last night but was short of some of the ingredients that it called for. I substituted the fresh herbs with dried, used regular cans of diced tomatoes instead of Italian style, and used prepared shrimp (decreasing the cooking time). It still came out great and my husband immediately gave it a 5. Next time, I'll definitely make it with the listed ingredients.. I can only imagine how much better it must be!

This is a decent recipe.  We like it much better when we add a bit of crushed red pepper and top w/ feta cheese instead of parmesan.  Kids won't eat it either way though.

This recipe was so good. I only added two 14 oz cans of tomatoes.  I forgot to drain the first can but drained the 2nd. All I had was the plain diced tomatoes so I added some Italian seasoning. I used fresh basil and fresh parsley from my garden. Also, I put this over Barilla tortellini. It was delicious!

This was a simple recipe and a big hit with my boyfriend.  It was a little bland, so I added some sugar,garlic powder and onion powder to give it a little more flavor.  My boyfriend said that it would be good spicy, and suggested that I add some red pepper next time.  And easy recipe to add/remove things to make it your own.

Delicious!  Light and perfect for a summer night in Texas!  Made as is except with only one can of tomatoes (it was all I had)  and twice as much garlic!  Wonderful.  Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent! Used 2-14 oz. cans of tomatoes and that was just perfect.  It's easy to make, the flavors are magnificent and it even tasted good heated up the next day.  This dish is a definite keeper!  Thanks Pat.

This recipe is now the favorite around my house! I even change it up a little and use chicken or different noodles but the flavor is incredible and it is sooo easy if you buy the pasta already made.

It was pretty good. It was a too bland for my taste, with the sauce consisting pretty much just tomatoes. It was easy enough to make, although the pasta should be cooked towards the end, so as to be ready when the sauce is. All in all, a good recipe though.

This was a very flavourful, light dish that was a big hit with everyone! My only suggestion to others would be to make sure you ration the amount of pasta to the amount of 'sauce.' I added a little too much pasta, which made for some dry pieces at the end of the bowl.

I thought this was delicious, although my husband doesn't like tomatoes and picked them all out.  So next time I will probably cut down on the tomatoes.

My husband and I both loved this.  I used precooked shrimp and added it at the end to heat through.  I also used vermouth cooking wine and did not add the parsley because I didn't have any. I forgot to add the cheese at the end and we did not notice, but I will add it next time.

I made this recipe with a friend and his partner when I was at their house one evening for dinner.  Neither of them cook much, and they said I could come and cook at their house anytime.  I added extra shrimp, and extra basil.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was excellent. Any who loves to cook will love this recipe. It was fairly easy to prepare and the ingredients were simple and the taste was unbelievable. The presentaion of this pasta dish was beautiful. I would serve this in a large authentic pasta dish with the shrimp and cheese gathered in the center w/ a couple of large leaves of basil for garnish. Ohh and make sure you have italian bread on hand for dunking!

My husband & I really enjoyed this dish.  The only changes I made were reduced the olive oil and I doubled the garlic.  I used fresh basil and fresh grated parmesan, and I think it made a huge difference  I'll definitely make this again.  Thanks Pat!

Awesome recipe!  I used 2 cans of 14 oz. tomatoes instead of 2 cans of 28 oz. tomatoes. One was jalepeno style, which gave it a good spicy kick.  Also, parsley was not necessary.  GREAT recipe, served it with BBQ chicken and salad, everyone loved it!

This is a dandy recipe.  Very easy to make, nice presentation and tasty as heck.  I used three 14oz cans of diced tomatoes, (a little less than called for) and I added a pound of fresh sea scallops.  Wife and guests were impressed.

This was good, however I found the sauce to be a little runny.  If I make this again, I make try to use some flour to thicken up the sauce.

Easy and elegant, I really enjoyed this dish.  The sauce reduces nicely and has wonderful flavor. My husband is not a big fan of shrimp, so I might try substituting scallops next time.

Very nice.  I added the juice along with the tins of tomatoes and just cooked longer to reduce juices.    Will definitely make again.

Used huge mexican shrimp (more like oversized prawns) and served this up with a mix of oyster & black trumpet mushrooms sauted in olive oil & white wine and a salad. It was superb! Makes alot, though. Guys, this is one to make for your honey on Valentines Day!

I used one 14.5 oz can of the diced tomatos and used a half a jar of Emeril's Roasted Red Pepper Pasta Sauce. This gave it a little extra kick and my husband loved it!

Very tasty and it was not complicated to make.  My husband loved it, my four year old liked it, my 2 year old picked out the shrimp and ate the pasta.  I will definately make this again.  Thanks for the tip on the time of deveining and cleaning the shrimp - it reminded me to ask the meat person to do it for me at the store.

really good meal...I added more veggies but other than that followed the recipe exactly, and it was perfect; great combination of flavours.  Oh also I used a combination of fresh and canned tomatoes because that's what I had on hand.

It was a little too much parsley and basil. Ease up on it a little! Overall, really good! I used the small shrimps so I wouldn't have to devein them, it worked better, however they were too small.

This dish was awesome and easy.  I read the reviews before trying it.  I doubled the garlic, added mushrooms, and used 1 can of diced tomatoes.  Also, using the freshest ingrediants really made a difference!  I made it last night and have already sent the recipe to friends!  It looked and tasted like it came from an Italian restaurant!

The taste of this dish was wonderful!  It was rather complicated, deveining all the shrimp and shelling them, but it was definitely worth it.  It was a meal I would make again.  It is an excellent dish to serve company.  Very impressive.

Delicious!!
I only ised a little olive oil, 1 can of the diced tomatoes & half tomatoe puree, I also added apple juice instead of the wine. I couldn't find fresh basil so I added a healthy dash of dried pizza (Italian) herbs & a dash of dried garlic. It smelled lovely while I was cooking it!! & my husband & toddler loved it. I tried it a few days later without the shrimp just as a pasta side dish. delicous!!

I thought this was a nice meal but it was a little lacking in the sauce. I think if more of a sauce was added or possibly a pesto them Id give it 4 or 5 stars

Very very good,I agree however that a little more garlic is called for. I used S & W Itialian tomatoes and the chunks were a little large so I used my hand blender to chop them a little smaller. I also added a little fresh oregano and it was delicious. A little crusty bread and olive oil on the side...What more can you ask for.

I unfortunatley added too much salt, so to fix that I simply added some fresh tomatoes, summer squash, and zuccini.  This added quite a bit of color to this recipe.  I might actually do this from now on.  Otherwise, this was a fantastic recipe  and the people I served it to loved it.  Thanks for sharing.

The only difficult part is peeling the shrimp-the sauce is a snap with very few ingrediants and LOTS of flavor!  I make it for company because it is simple and elegant!

I agree that this recipe might benefit from a little tomatoe paste to thicken it up. Other than that, it was delicious!  My company raved about it, and went back for seconds.  I also used Linguine noodles, which may have made it difficult for the sauce to "stick".

Yummy!  Next time I'll get shelled and deveined shrimp, but other than that it was real quick!  I used Rotel because I didn't have the tomatoes..and dried basil since I didn't have fresh...and no white wine.  I added lemon juice right at the very end and it was delicious.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!  :)

This recipe was worthwhile...the basil added a nice touch.  However, I would double the garlic and reduce the tomatoes by half.

I liked the recipe, but not enough spice in it for me.  If it make it again, I will add more herbs, maybe oregano, and tomato paste for thickness.  Otherwise, great!

Excellent flavor! I substituted 2 cans of chopped tomatoes for stewed, I think this is why my sauce never reduced even after cooking for 45 minutes. So I added about 2 tablespoons of italian seasoned tomato paste and it thickened right up to perfection! My husband raved about it! I may try it with chicken too!

My children loved it as well as my dinner guests.  I used medium sized already peeled and cooked shrimp and they worked just fine.  The fresh basil and parsley are what really make it.  Very easily, elegant, and delicious.

This was a very tasty recipe!  We don't get to go out to eat much these days, so this tasted as good or better than going out to eat. Make sure you use nice fresh shrimp and you are guaranteed success with this recipe.

I loved this recipe.  I used only three cans of tomatoes, which was the perfect amount.  The only thing I will do differently next time is to use another type of tomato, the stewed flavor overpowered the shrimp.  It heated up well in the microwave.  Thanks for this great meal.

I made this with half the tomatoes and reduced it for much longer than called for to make the sauce more substantial.  A definite winner.
