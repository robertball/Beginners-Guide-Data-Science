I tried o make this recipe.  The dough never got firm and when I tried to bake it, the cookies all melted so that you only had one big cookie sheet covered with dough. I had to try a different recipe.  I would never use this recipe again!

This recipe turned out to be a sticky mess.  In the morning, the dough was as soft as it was the night before.  I followed it to a tee, and still it was a mess.  Not sure I will try it again.

Wonderful flavor but when I was making this recipe, the dough was way too soft to shape into a roll. I had to add a whole cup of flour before it was firm enought to shape.

Very good!  don't make though unless you are committed to the time to follow the directions.  Trust me...they turn out as a pan of Goo otherwise.  I did salvage my pan of Goo as "Recovery Cookies" but then I also took the rest and put it in the fridge like the directions say to do.  They came out great when I followed the directions!  Be patient - they are worth it!

one big gooey glop on the cookie sheet, taste good but not worth the effort
