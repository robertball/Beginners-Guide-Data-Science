This is good but tastes even better if you add a package of Lipton Onion Soup Mix.

This is a great basic soup. While it is a bit bland, it lends itself to many seasoning opportunities. I added half a bag of frozen hash brown potato cubes near the end of the cooking time, because my kids like potatoes in their veggie soup. Also, some hot pepper sauce added lots of flavor.

I thought this soup was REALLY good! Like the previous reviewer, I added Lipton Onion soup because I like onion in my soup. I will definately make this again. You can't beat it for its quickness and flavor!

I have made a soup similar to this for years but I use browned stew meat (cut into smaller pieces) instead of the hamburger.

This is a great recipe.  I use browned stew meat instead of ground beef.  If you want more flavor, try using Spicy V-8 Juice.  Mmm-mmm!

This was so much better than I had anticipated. I figured it would be so easy but not so good. I used tomato juice and seasoned with cajun seasoning, lemon pepper, and S&P. I definitely will use this recipe quite a bit since it's so economical and delicious.

I made my soup by putting a can of sliced potatoes, 2 12 oz pkgs of frozen veggies, 1 lb. of ground beef and a packet of onion soup mix in my crock pot.  Then I poured as much V8 in as would fit (not quite the whole container).  I thought that this was great considering it's about as basic a soup as you can get.  Next time I'll brown my beef with some Montreal Steak Seasoning for a little more flavor.

One of the easiest and tastiest recipes ever.  The first time I made it exactly as written and it was excellent.  I have made it with several alterations/additions since, and the best we've had yet is to keep the original recipe but use 1 1/2 pounds stew beef in lieu of the hamburg.  It makes the recipe even simpler; no need to cook the beef first, just toss everything in the slow cooker, leave it on low for eight hours and it's perfect.  Great reheated the next day too.

This is a no-brainer to make. Just brown the meat and throw everything in the crock pot. It turns out great every time. I add a can of diced tomatoes and some spices to jazz it up a bit. Great comfort food on a wintry evening, and the leftovers freeze great!

I've made a meatless version of this for years but I really like the addition of beef. I used  round beef that was packaged in strips for stir frying. I cut the strips into bite sized pieces and then browned the meat in a little olive oil. The package of onion soup mix adds the needed flavor but I've also used various herbs(thyme, basil, or marjoram).I only use 1(16oz) bag of vegetables and any leftovers I have in the refrigerator. Serve with bread and salad and you have a meal!

Great starter recipe! The recipe by it's self is very blah, but I sprinkled in a decent amount of beef bullion, a large helping of diced onion, some cumin and a little green bell pepper. Turned into a very nice and hearty soup. Best part was it was extremely easy!

This was really good! I used stew meat and browned it a little bit first. I also added a can of beef broth and a packet of onion soup mix on other reviewer's advice. I also threw in some pearl onions for more flavor. Very easy, very tasty!

Great recipe! So simple. I had left over beef chunks from dinner the night before so I cubed them and added onion soup mix along with some Sazon packets and garlic. YUMMY!

I also thought this was a little bland at first. I used stew meat instead of the ground hamburger. I also added the beef broth, dry onion soup mix, and garlic powder. In addition, I added a can of Campbell's condensed cream of celery soup. SO YUMMY!!

I agree with other reviewers when they say that this makes a great base for the soup, but is bland as is. I added the following ingredients to the base slow cooker version of the recipe, and got a hearty, tasty soup: 

1 can of beef broth
1 can of diced tomatoes
1 can of Goya red beans
1 tsp each of basil, oregano, and parsley
Salt, pepper and hot sauce to taste

I would never have thought to use V8 as a soup base! It's a great idea, and it's very healthy.

This was certainly easy, but lacked flavour for my family, so I changed it to suit our tastes. I added oriental vegetable mix, onion soup mix, garlic and a can of tomatoes. Thank you for a great base recipe!

I only thought this was okay but DH and Granpa just raved about how good it was so I guess its a keeper. I used canned mixed veggies (all I had on hand), added some shredded cabbage (had an enormous head to get rid of), used some garlic and additional salt and pepper. It froze really well as I made it last week they ate it this week for dinner and I had some leftovers today for lunch. I will probably make this again since it is so easy to throw together and freezes so well.

I can't say I liked it.  I started out with the recipe as is...  but it lacks seasoning!  It is what it is, a quick substitute for vegetable beef soup.  I tried to save it with the onion soup mix, but that wasn't enough.  I ended up adding thyme, oregano and basil, and it was edible.  I'm going back to a broth based soup, sorry guys---- and ground beef in a soup? Noooooooooo!

I have been using this simple recipe for years. It's a great way to get kiddos to eat their veggies!  You can make this in a slow cooker.  Just saute some onion and garlic in a skillet then add lean ground beef and brown. Drain beef and transfer it to the slow cooker. Add frozen veggies and V-8. I usually use part beef stock to replace half of V-8 as it can be quite sour otherwise. Often times I'll chop up cabbage (fine) and throw that in with the veggies as well. (YUM!)  Bay leaves and some added herbs (your preference) will add some flavor. Cook in crock pot on low for 7 hours or high for 3 to 4 hours. Enjoy...

This recipe is good for a soup base. It was a bit bland. I too added a package of onion soup mix. In addition I added a couple potatoes, garlic salt and pepper. My husband and kids added more salt and pepper to their bowl. My husband thought it was "ok", but he is very picky. Good recipe to experiment with and very healthy. Boy did the house smell good all day!

Made this recently for a sick family member - put in bags and in the freezer so they can heat and eat.  Was very good.  I did make a few changes - only 1 bag of soup veggies, added a can of tomatoes and added a can of corn.  Good and hearty.

Definately a good base for soup.  I used extra lean ground beef instead of hamburger. I cooked some onion with the ground beef, drained, and put in crockpot.  I added remaining ingredients, and also added a can of beef broth, a can of petite diced tomatoes, and a pkg of onion soup mix. I let it cook for about 8 hrs on medium heat. My husband and I ate it for lunch for 3 days, and there was still enough left over to freeze for later.

This recipe was very easy and tasty. I did add 2 cups of beef broth because I like things more beefy than tomato tasting, and I used left over shredded beef brisket. it was easy, fast and delicious.

VERY easy, VERY good. I used ground turkey and low-sodium V8 so I could add tastier/healthier sea salt. Added tabasco sauce, one can of beef stock, and one can (undrained) of diced tomatos. One beneficial accident - only frozen veggies I could find were PictSweet brand "Old Fashioned Vegetable Soup" mix. They were a more interesting blend of veggies than the normal, cut much larger, and with a seasoning mix already on them. A truly great addition, if you can find it!

This is so easy and so good!  Definitely a keeper.  The flavors are even better the next day as leftovers.

Next time I might add some chopped potato or even frozen hashbrowns for something a little different.  Thanks for this recipe.

I've been making this for years and everyone loves it!  I saute an onion while browning the meat then add a can of sliced potatoes along with frozen veg and V-8.  The only spice we add is salt and pepper.  It is delicious!  Truth:  I pick out alot of the green beans.

Maybe I will try suggestion of adding onion soup mix.  Pros: Quick, easy, inexpensive.  Cons: tasted flat, needed oomph.

I'm rating this soup as 4 stars because it's healthy and the easiest recipe possible, with just 3 ingredients.  Having said that, I did find the recipe bland.  I'll try it again with the onion soup mix that other reviewers have recommended.

I used this as a base, minus the mixed veggies. My family doesn't like everything that comes with them, so I just add what veggies we like. This was oh so good after I did that.  Thanks, especially for the idea of using the v-8 as a base.

Ack, the v-8 made it to "tangy" so I had to add a can of beef broth and onion soup mix. It was so-so after wards.

This recipe is so easy and very tasty.  I've used different kinds of frozen vegetable mixes and they all seem to work equally as well.  The only thing I've done differently is to add salt and pepper.  It's a very good working mom's recipe.

I was looking for an easy way to use ground beef with limited ingredients and I came across this recipe. I seasoned my ground beef with garlic powder and It’s a Doozy seasoning and browned it on the stovetop. I only had 1/2 a bag of the onion soup mix, so I added that to the V8 juice in the slow cooker. Added the cooked and drained ground beef, 1 16 oz package of frozen veggies (because that’s all I had on hand), garlic powder, 1/2 a bag of red lentils, and borrowed another reviewer’s idea of 1 can of beef broth, 1 can of diced tomatoes (with green chiles), 1 teaspoon of basil, 1 teaspoon of oregano, 1 teaspoon of parsley, and some black pepper. It did not need any additional salt. I cooked on high for 3 hours because I had limited time, but the lentils probably could have gone for another hour. I’m already looking forward to making it again because it’s so easy and tasty!

I  followed some other posts and added a pack of onion soup mix also put spicy montreal steak seasoning on the beef added celery cabbage baby carrots and canned veg all because I ran out of frozen. 5 min before it was done I added 2 palmfuls of brown minute rice and some green onions. the soup still needs lots of seasoning I will add some bullion next time.thanks for posting.

This soup as written was not that great.  Would I eat it?  If I had to, I would.  When I added lots of spices and some Worcestershire sauce, it improved greatly.  I hate to say add lots of extra ingredients, because the simplicity of the recipe was what attracted me to it, but it's just not that good unchanged.

This was a great soup. I've made it twice and will make it again. Five stars for being easy, and pleasing my husband and children. I tend to throw in some plain macaroni with it, but that is all. Yummy!

Really easy, reallyy good. I didn't add anything like soup mix or broth like other reviews. I used low sodium V8 and I sub'd the ground beef with stew meat and I sautéed an onion with about 6 cloves of garlic and added to it. It's great.

Next time I am going to asd some celery and perhaps try the spicy V8.

Like others, I have done a similar soup using regular V-8 juice, ground chuck, frozen mixed vegetables, but also frozen onions...salt and pepper to taste.  The onions really make a difference, and frozen ones seem to do better than fresh for some reason.

What a great base for anything you have in the pantry. I like simple recipes that inspire a cook's imagination. I sautéed chopped garlic then added 20 oz of ground turkey. Once the meat was browned I added Campbell's tomato juice, a can of chicken broth, a can of chopped tomatoes with green chiles, one can of black beans, frozen corn and a packet of McCormick's Mexican Fiesta Marinade (fajita seasoning would probably work too). After reaching a boil, I simmered for 25 minutes. I served topped with chopped cilantro and cheddar cheese. Even better the next day.
