This is good.  I don't use sour cream , used plain Greek yogurt. (I always use Plain Greed yogurt if a recipe calls for sour cream)  I added about a tsp of Dijon mustard.  I don't like to measure my salad dressings --I always make my own. Added more Blue Cheese and garlic powder.  I am a taster and this tasted terrific.  Will do it again

This was pretty good.  I did scale back the amount of mayonnaise, sour cream and milk and left the other ingredients about the same.   I love blue cheese so I made sure to add the full amount.
