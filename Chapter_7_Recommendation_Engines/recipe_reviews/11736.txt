This is a really good recipe and WOW! Does it make ALOT! I must say it is a time consuming recipe (I mean, there is chicken, ham, beef etc..) but the result is tasty.  Instead of using 2 lbs of ground beef, I used only one and then used a lb of italian sausage.  Very good.  I would recommend to any one esspecially if they are serving a large crowd (family reunions, graduation parties and so on) it feeds alot and everyone is sure to partake and enjoy!

This is my husband's most requested item from his catering menu and this is the recipe he uses - of course he's a dumper, not a measurer - but this is his guideline.  People absolutely love this stuff!

A great base recipe.  I found it by doing an ingredient search to use up some things around the kitchen.  So, here is how I put it together.  I roughly halved the recipe.  I used red pepper instead of green, 10 oz. sliced fresh button mushrooms instead of canned, and when I was near done sauteing the above ingredients I made a well in the middle of the pan and cooked three raw chicken tenders thawed from my freezer.  I used 1.25 lbs ground beef, 25 low-fat turkey pepperoni slices (layered in groups of five and sliced in quarters), instead of ham I used 4 oz. chopped kielbasa (did not cut amount in half).  I threw all the sauce ingredients together and simmered while preparing 8 oz. Whole Wheat Rotini pasta.  For the layers, I used some open red sauce from my fridge to coat the bottom of the pan,  then pasta, sauce, cheese (used about 10 oz mozzarella and used the whole 2 tbl of parm).  A perfect dish to leave for your family to reheat when your away!!

Some recipes require a good deal of preparation time with little pay off.  To the contrary, this Cavatini offers an exceptional reward for the time invested.  Though it takes some time, there isn't anything particularly difficult about it.  As others have done, I cut the recipe in half and still had a heaping mound of food.  It came out of the oven piping hot with a golden brown topping.  I received rave reviews from my family.  We didn't even need a side dish ... just a little Italian bread and butter.  For kids and adults alike, for a hearty, unbelievably tasty meal - check this one out!!!

Gave this a "4" ONLY because of our personal preferences (felt it needed more pasta, some garlic and the chicken was lost in the final results).  But still totally enjoyable and a great base to "tweak"!  Thank you.

This was very tasty, I thought the combination of the meats seemed very strange but to my surprise was delicious.  As others said it is quite a bit of a time consuming recipe to prepare but does make a lot.  The only thing I changed was I added more pasta & sauce, it just didn't seem like enough pasta for all of the meat involved & I used fresh mushrooms rather than canned.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  It was so rich and cheesy.  My little girl didn't think much of it, but 7 year old children can be pretty finicky.  This is a definite keeper!!!

This makes a ton of pasta.  I swear I 1/4'd this but still ended up with a full 9x13 pan of pasta.  It's a good thing we liked it and it's serving as our lunches this week!  I didn't put in ground beef but instead used some chopped kielbasa.  It's hard to get the pasta out of the pan in the layers, so next time I'd skip that layering step and instead just mix it all together, plus add 1 cup of water to the pasta sauce and just cook the pasta in the pan with everything else (you just have to cook it longer this way--about twice as long as the original recipe).  That's the lazy way of making baked pasta and usually my go to.  :)  This is very meaty and cheesy.  I used wheels because that is what I had on hand.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a HUGE hit!  I used Ragu Green Peppers and Onion sauce, turkey pepparoni, cooking spray instead of butter, and reduced fat cheese and my meat and potatoes husband was none the wiser.  We have to sneak the healthy things in when we can, girls!

I recently catered my son's wedding and made this dish for 150 people. I only used rotini pasta in mine as well as ground sausage and ground beef. I wasn't quite sure about the recipe first, so I made a batch and sent it to work with hubby, the guys absolutely loved it and they finished the whole batch! When they say this batch makes a lot, they're not kidding! But in my case, that was a good thing. It also freezes and reheats well.

Imagine your favorite pizza with all the toppings you love. Got it? Ok, now double the cheese and take away the bread. This dish is fantastic. Hope you have counter space for all the ingredients because there are a $#!*load, but if you can manage enough room, MAKE THIS DISH. You won't regret it.

This was a lot of work for what turned out to be pretty much an "italian casserole" of sorts. My husband was unimpressed, and although the flavor was good, it was just too much effort with too little pay off.

full of flavours.  Go ahead, make two and freeze one.  You will want it again soon.  Even though it is easy to make, it is great to un-freeze on a busy night.

This sounded so tasty that I made enough for an army! I wasn't disappointed. I didn't change anything about the recipe other than doubling it.   This is one of our new family favorites. This freezes very well and keeps the same delicious flavor.

So yummy! Wasn't sure if I would like this - considering all the meat (made for hubby Valentine's Day) but the flavors all complement each other beautifully and it's not too much! Has moved to one of our favorites!  While browning the hamburger I grilled the chicken on my Foreman to make things easy.  I use Newman's Sockarooni spaghetti sauce - it's the best!

Actually, I more used this as a very loose guide and took considerable liberties with the ingredients.  I did not use the beef, ham or chicken.  I did use thick sliced pepperoni cut into cubes (8 ozs) and sliced smoked sausage.  I had smoked mozerella on hand so I used that as well (it was delicious!)  I only made about half of the recipe and baked it in a deep oval dish.  I still used a whole onion and whole green pepper. The convience of the jar sauce was a plus, but I wasn't satisfied with the overly tomatoie/acid taste.  Maybe I will use a different brand or even make my own sauce next time.  I think next time I will cut the pepperoni down to 4 ozs and used ground italian sausage.  I definately think this is worth tinkering with and making again

Great recipe! I used this for a very large crowd and everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. I did make some slight changes with the recipe, I left out the turkey/chicken and used Il Trullo Fusilli. (1 1/2" long flat pasta) Overall it was very tasty and easily made ahead of the occasion.

Excellent recipe - it took a while to make, so I made double and froze the extra. I agree with another reviewer in that it tastes even better when the flavors had time to meld.

A delicious casserole! Ground turkey was used in place of ground beef. Next time for a variation, Italian sausage will be tried.
After freezing part of this, we ate it later, and it was even tastier,after the flavors blended!Cindy H.

My husband and I really enjoyed this hearty dish!  I modified it slighty, and simply 
used the pasta that I already had on hand (tri-color spiral), and used fresh 
mushrooms instead of canned.   The meats all were nicely balanced, with no 
single favor overpowering the other.  It was simply wonderful!  The meat and 
vegetable topping would make an incredible topping for a pizza!!

Great casserole! My family loved it!  I used fresh mushrooms and added extras, this will only work for the little one if they are vegetable eaters.  It's a heavy meal, but so delicious.
Sorry I only made 1 pan of it on the first go around.  Thanks for another great recipe.

My picky kids loved it! I was skeptical of the ham, but it was very good. Great for using up leftovers! Definitely going into our menu rotation.

I made this for a friend and they loved it (I also snuck a bite) but her family did say they wish that there was slightly more sauce.  Would definetely make again.

OK, I'm the only person that didn't "RAVE" about this that ate it.  I prefer less sauce and I thought the pepperoni made it a little too greasy.  I think that is what made everyone love it!. Lots of meat and not too much pasta and TONS of melted cheese. Got asked to make it again and also for the recipe, so it gets 5 stars!

I just made this recipe last night for a Valentine's dinner for my fiancee and myself.  After one bite, he told me to hold on to this recipe.  It was extremely flavorful and could feed an army!!  I omitted the mushrooms because neither one of us likes them and cut down on the mozzarella, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  For my taste, there was plenty of cheese.  Great recipe!  Thanks!

This was very good!  My whole family liked it.  A little bit of work, and a lot of ingredients, but worth the effort!  And the bonus is that you have an extra one in the freezer for another day!

This was really good! I liked all the flavors combined together. I didn't make quite as much as the recipe called for and I used wagon wheels as one of the pastas. It is good for leftovers too. I used leftover chicken. This is a keeper!

Didn't make nearly as much as it said it would, which is fine, because we didn't like it all that much.  It made a 9x13 pan and an 8x8 pan.  Tastes better after a few days in the fridge.  Didn't like the ham in it.  Might try it with sausage.

I served this for a progressive dinner at our house and it got rave reviews.  The next day friends came over and we served it to their two kids and they really loved it.  It really is a good recipe.
