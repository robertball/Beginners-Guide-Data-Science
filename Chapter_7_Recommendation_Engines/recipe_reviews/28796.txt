This recipe is sometimes called Eskimo Cookies. But this seems to have less sugar & butter.  I made this with my 7th grade Home Ec class.  During exam week I had an extra period with one class. I needed something fun, yet educational & could be done in a regular classroom.  This was a perfect recipe!  I changed the yield to 18, so the recipe would use 1 stick of butter (we used margarine).  The only change I would make is reducing some of the sugar.  Many students liked the recipe as is, but since I changed the yield,the sugar measurement is a bit wonky (1/2 cup + 1 Tbsp). I would take the 1 Tbsp out and see how it works out.

For teachers: 90-min block with a lunch period in the middle. I chilled the cookies during the lunch period, but there is plenty of time even without. If I had a 45-min period, I would (or have the students the previous class) pre-measure the dry ingredients so all they have to do is dump it in a bowl, add wet & mix. Then put in freezer for 10-15 min & eat.
I used this as an example of something to do when baby sitting children (not too young & always ask the parents).  It is a good recipe because it is has some redeeming nutrition (fiber- but we also discuss the high sugar & fat content), has no peanut butter (since many kids have allergies), doesnâ€™t need heat (oven or stove) & kids can use hands to mix ingredients.

I didn't have powdered sugar ... so I used 1 C of granulated sugar in the mix and reduced the cocoa powder by 1 T.  Then, I rolled in cocoa powder.  I was running short on time, so I threw them in the freezer to chill.  So yum!  And even better after they sat in the fridge over night. 

Thx!

These weren't very good.  It tastes too much like butter and the cocoa powder gives it a somewhat bitter taste.  If I ever try making these again I will use half the butter and add some peanut butter, but I think I'll just find a different recipe next time.

Way too buttery!  If I make these again I will cut back on the butter and add a little more sugar and cocoa.

Satisfied my sweet tooth without having to turn on the oven (which I HATE to do in the summer)!  Was looking for a no-boil, no-peanut butter recipe that used things I already had on hand, and this one fit those criteria perfectly. I wanted to cut fat and sugar, so I subbed in light butter and about 1/4 c Equal.  The cookies still set up perfectly and taste great.

I thought this was a good recipe.  I halved the cocoa and added 1 1/2 T. Soy Butter (Peanut Butter alternative).  I also didn't add the powdered sugar and I didn't think it was lacking.  It was plenty sweet without it. An easy tasty cookie.

With my modifications I would give this 5 stars.  Super fast and yummy.  I used only 1 stick (1/2 C) of butter.  I also added 1/3 C peanut butter- heated slightly to make a little runny.  DELISH!  They taste a little like a "puppy chow" (made from chex mix) cookie.  These are wonderful!

I'm glad these are being made for kids. Way too much sugar! Thank goodness I only have these kids for an hour tonight. They're for my Wed. night church class so at least I get to send them to their respective homes AFTER they eat them. ROTFL!

Well, I made these by accident. I had two recipes pulled up, one for these and one for baked oatmeal. I started putting together the ingredients and realized I was making the wrong thing. I couldn't go back so I went ahead and made them thinking that they wouldn't be all that great. I did sub brown sugar for white (only 1/2 cup, not packed) and 1 tsp vanilla or more (I use a lot because it always adds another dimension to the taste, and since I make my own, it's not expensive). I melted the butter so I had to refrigerate a bit before rolling, but I could mix it with a spoon so it made less mess. Lastly, I did not roll them in the confectioners' sugar, since I've been trying to cut calories. I have to admit that I did not have high hopes at all, the recipe sounded good but didn't seem like anything special. Well, after chilling, I've had 5 so far and they are addictive. Kind of like no bakes but with more of a candy bar texture. I'm planning on making truffles for the holidays this year. I'm wondering how they would be dipped in chocolate, maybe with a pecan in the middle. All in all, these were a nice treat. My kids love 'em too!

Easy to make but no one in my household liked the powdered sugar on it. It took the chocolate taste out of it. It seemed to dry it out to much and was messy.

Way to much butter! It coats my mouth after I eat it. I would definitely suggest cutting out some of the butter and putting in some peanut butter or something. Will not be making again.

This was a good recipe!  I also only used 1/3 cup sugar and 1/2 c. butter and added 4TBSP peanut butter!  Yummy!  I rolled most in the p.sugar and a few in p.sugar and a little flax seed and a few in raw sugar and a few in more cocoa!  They were all awesome!  Maybe gonna try dipping them in melted chocolate next time!

I wish I did not make these, I can not stop eating them! I used maple and brown sugar instant oatmeal instead of the reg. oats. I also only used 1/2 cup of sugar. I did not use the coco as well because I felt it to be a bit bitter and the maple from the instant oatmeal gave this a nice taste. Also I only used 3 tbs of butter and replaced the rest with peanut butter. If you have a sweet tooth then this is a cookie for you. not only is it good but it is very easy to make and clean up is a breeze!

I used this recipe and modified it due to no powder sugar and no cocoa. which I do not have in the house due to parrots in home.   in place of cocoa I used 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 2 tbsp of honey. I rolled in white sugar and chilled and they came out good. next time I will decrease the honey as it made it a tad to moist.

easy and delicious.  Didn't have the vanilla so used vanilla coffee creamer instead of the water and vanilla extract. Ran out of butter so used half butter and half butter spread.  flattened into pan and patted confectioner's sugar on top.  My husband loved them!

I give it a 4 stars only with a few alterations.  I didn't have cocoa powder, so I melted one square of semi-sweet baking chocolate into the butter.  I also reduced the butter to 1/2 C (one stick).  To make the cookies stck together, I added 4 Tbs. of peanut butter (I like crunchy, but you can use any kind).  I loved the end result!!

Too dry... There was no stickyness to keep the cookies together.  I added peanut butter for that reason (and it made it tastier!)  Rolling in powdered sugar made it much too sweet.  I wouldn't use this recipe again.

I just LOVE this recipe! ! ! I let my 2 year old daughter and her friend make these cookies for their tea party and they had so much fun mixing this with their hands. these cookies didn't make it to the fridge the girls were eating them as fast as they could roll them. thanks for sharing this easy quick recipe.

It was quick and easy, but very messy.  It took some work getting the "dough" to roll into the balls. Everyone did enjoy them.

These are great! I swapped cinnamon for the cocoa powder and added raisins for an oatmeal cookie taste. I also used turbinado sugar which is coarser than regular granulated sugar so these came out grittier than I expected. Next time I'll either use the food processor on the sugar for a finer grain or use white sugar as the recipe calls for.

I've made a lot of recipes from this website and among deserts my husband says this is his favorite along with no bake cheese cake and the pear cake. I generally always follow the recipes as are and this one is no exception.

I've made this recipe twice....with a couple adjustments! I skipped the water altogether. I also added about 1/2 - 2/3 C of creamy peanut butter, tho crunchy would work as well. I've also added about 1/2 C of mini chocolate chips. Mix all together before scooping into balls, then 1 round of rolling in powdered sugar. I refrigerate for about an hour, then a 2nd round powdered sugar. And don't ever skimp on the real butter! Quite yummy!

Made this with a base of peanut butter and honey, left out sugar and butter. Loaded up with rolled oats, all all the types of nuts and seed I had on hand, cocoa and cinnamon, mixed well and rolled into 1/2 inch balls - perfect snack to get you through the mid-day slump or late night sweet craving!

I made these to take to work and, when I went to get them from the refrigerator the next morning they were gone. Needless to say, my family loved them and even asked to have them at Christmas.

Made the recipe just as it says and it wasn't dough-like and the form wouldn't hold very well. We added some peanut butter to act as a glue and they were amazing! we also flattened them to be more like a real cookie. They were great! Especially since we didn't have milk! Thank you!

Yummy for the whole family. I cut out the white sugar completely, and rolled in wheat germ instead of confectioners sugar for some added fibre and protein. They are just sweet enough and the chocolate taste really stands out.

I read the other reviews before starting this recipe and have made it twice over the weekend. I really enjoyed this dessert, but made a lot of changes to alter the taste to my preferences and to help complete the dessert. Instead of making balls I poured the batter into an 8x8 baking pan, sprinkled with conf. sugar, and chilled in the fridge for about 30 minutes. I am giving this 3 stars b/c I had to change how much of each ingredient I used in the recipe. Overall, this is a great dessert to play around with.

Taking others' advice, I reduced the amount of sugar and butter, but had to add a bit of butter at the end to get the crumbs to hold. A nice easy recipe to make with my 2 year old.

I'm very glad I only halved this recipe, because then I was only out the cost of 1/3 of a stick of butter.  Not very good at all.  It ended up being thrown out.

Great!! I guess to like it, that just depends on your taste. I changed some things though. Instead of putting 3 tablespoons cocoa i put 3 tablespoons peanut butter. Also, I fully melted the butter. To me and my family this tasted great!!

This was really really rich.  If you are having a MAD choco craving this will do, but I love sweets and these were a bit too much. More of a concoction than a cookie.

These were very easy to make and okay for taste.  Nobody else ate them but me though.  I don't think I'll make them again - unless I'm having a real sweet craving.
