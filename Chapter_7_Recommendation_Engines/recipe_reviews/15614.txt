Good flavor, great for beginning cooks or cooks who are like me and able to manage to mess up almost anything (even basic spaghetti!) Quick and easy!

Perfect!  I needed a quick recipe for chicken to go with some rice.  My husband & I really enjoyed it.  And, it was so quick.

Simple to make. Not bad. Not a lot of flavor. Maybe if it marinated. I chose to bake it rather than microwave.

This sounds wonderful. I give it 5 stars based on the recipe and plan to give it the same after I try it. I love these flavors. I might try switching the amounts of soy and Worcestershire, because I love Worcestershire sauce! And I am looking for chicken microwave recipes.

I really liked this recipe and my picky eater child did too! She even had second helpings. I modified the recipe for 4 servings. I used granulized garlic, low-sodium soy sauce, and 1 Tablespoon of dried oregano. I mixed all the sauce ingredients together, and then added chicken and tossed.  I also added some fresh ground black pepper to taste.  Cooked it in a pyrex dish for 15 mins, then turned the oven off and left the chicken in there for another 10-15 mins while the sides cooked.  It was delicious and not dry at all. It's going in my virtual recipe box.

This was super simple and actually pretty good for something cooked in the microwave. It was a bit salty as I thought it would be so I think a low sodium soy sauce would work better.  I juiced the lemon over the chicken mix before the final 5 minutes of cooking. Although this will not replace some of my favorite recipes for chicken stir-fry, I will use it when time is short. Thanks!

We used sea salt and pepper on the chicken first and placed it on tin foil in a metal baking pan. Then in a bowl mixed all the ingredients together but I used real minced garlic instead of garlic salt and lemon juice instead of the slice. Brushed the mix on both sides. Then baked all of it in the oven,. With the left over liquid after baking we put it on jasmine rice! Lots of flavor.

Very good, simple recipe that provides a good amount of flavor! I made the oven version. I probably used more than what the recipe calls for with the Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce.
