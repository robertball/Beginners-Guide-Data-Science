I did this recipe without the shallots and used smart balance instead and it tasted great. My wife doesn't eat fish often and I put this sauce over pan fried sole parmesan. It was awesome.

Okay, this is NOT a diet recipe, but it is DELICIOUS.  My husband made this and served it over panko-breaded, sauteed chicken tenders and it was marvelous.  Just the right blend of lemon and cream.  THIS is a keeper.  Great for "company" or when you want to treat yourself like company.  Easy too.

It was good.  I've been craving lemon everything since I've been pregnant, and this did the trick.  My husband actually made this.  He didn't use shallots and we made half the recipe (note to those that do the same - use a SMALL sauce pan.)  We'd make it again.

I made recipe but also used Smart Balance Spread instead of butter. I added roasted garlic and a bag of spinach (squeeze out liquid first), cooking another 5-7 minutes on medium low. During the last 7 minutes of cooking, I added 4 filets of Talapia fish. Once time is up, remove fish to a plate,  serve sauce over a bed of Angel Hair pasta, then place a filet of fish on top.  Garnish with diced Roma tomatos and finley choped parsley for color.  SoooooGooood!!

This sauce turned out just like at Carrabas.  Very good with sauted mushrooms, too.

This sauce was absolutely delicous. I grilled salmon and used this as a marinade and pasta sauce.  I made it for a dinner party and received awesome reviews.

This was sooooo good. We all enjoyed it very much. We put it over salmon and also over the broccoli. We also cut the butter to 1 stick. It doesn't need 2.

I would not recommend this recipe.  I could not bring myself to eat it or even serve it to my family.  I found it to be very overwhelming with butter and lemon (2 things that we actually like) and not velvety in the least.  Not at all like I had imagined it would be....very disappointed!

This was so tasty. The only changes I made were I increased the amount of lemon juice. I didn't measure it, but I used the juice from an entire lemon, and I'm pretty sure that's more then 4 tsps. Also, I cut the amount of butter in about half as a cup just seemed overkill! Again, didn't measure just added as much as I though would taste good, and it did! I served this over chicken breasts on a bed of garlic buttered fetticuini noodles. So good! My boyfriend had nothing but wonderful things to say about it. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This recipe is very tastey.  I added 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper for a little extra zing.  The only problem I encounteered is that I served it over broccoli and it got a bit clumpy after the broccoli started to get cool.  I'm guessing it's because vegetables get cold quickly and this wouldn't happen if served over hot meat.
