Thank you... I wanted to make a sugar pie for my husband that was as good as my mother in laws. I think I did! It worked well with the Best Ever Pie Crust recipe from this site!

Followed directions precisely and this pie turned out dry and caky.  Would not recommend this recipe as it is.   It might be better with far less flour and more heavy cream
