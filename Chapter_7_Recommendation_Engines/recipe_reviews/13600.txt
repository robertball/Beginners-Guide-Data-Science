This needed something.  Made again and added garlic powder to the potatoes, used sharp cheddar, grated, and topped with crisp bacon pieces.

Didn't read the review before I made, and then made again like the other reviewer.  I liked much better.  The American cheese just doesn't do it justice.  I added roasted garlic along with the green onions and mozzarella instead of cheddar.  Thanks for the base.

tasty, albeit high in fat.  i threw in some green beans and chicken broth, which gave it some additional texture.  i made this extra-quick by using the packaged refrigerated carton of mashed potatoes!

Needed seasoning.  Used cheddar cheese instead of American.
