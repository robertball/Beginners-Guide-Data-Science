Wow. This was so YUMMO.  I had two kids go back for 2nds and 3rds AFTER dessert. I added a bunch of chopped green onions that I needed to use up. Just threw them in with the chicken (rotisserie) and cilantro.  I’d make this again without the chicken too. The flavor is great! I did have to add a bit of milk  at the end to loosen it up because it got a bit too thick. I’ve made a bunch of SLN’s recipes and I’m always left happy.
