This is super delicious good! I used Trader Joe's Cornbread Mix so I had to double the recipe with the exception of Green Chiles, I only used 4 oz, but could still taste the hotness.  One extra thing that I do when I make waffles is fold 1 egg white beaten until stiff after everything is blended together. This action tends to make my waffles crisp.

Honestly, I was expecting more flavor considering the pepperjack and cheddar cheeses as well as the green chiles.  This is a very filling and somewhat dense waffle, but it was tasty topped with chili, shredded cheddar and sour cream...a full meal, for sure.  This recipe served two this evening, and I'll try the other two with some butter and maple syrup tomorrow morning.

Buy a box of pre-packaged corn muffin mix is hardly a "recipe." Maybe a dinner idea, but that's it. Very disappointing. Is there an "open a can of Spaghettios" recipe in the Italian foods section? Jeez.

This was a nice twist on chili. My whole picky family loved them-- which is saying something. We left out the chilies because we were serving to kids. The 3 and 5 yr old ate them with syrup. Mom and dad added sliced jalapeños before they cooked, then topped with chili and sour cream. Delicious! We'll definitely make this again.

I used a 6.5 oz corn bread mix. Added a tablespoon of chopped fresh herbs ( sage, rosemary and thyme). I thought these waffles had good taste and had no issues with them sticking in the waffle iron. This recipe made 10 square waffles. Will make these again. Thank you.

I will make these again as it was a fun twist on traditional corn bread. Served them along Mexican Chicken Corn Chowder (on this site).  Thanks for the recipe!

Made no changes. Had some problems with sticking, so I pre heated the waffle maker to a higher temperature. Had to watch closely as not to burn them Served chili over the waffles and my wife and I found it  was a enjoyable dinner.

Used homemade chili on top of the Cornbread Waffles.  I think the waffle's taste was lost a little under the chili.  Next time I might just use the waffles on the side instead of under.  The crisper they are, the better they are.

Awesome waffles! I used corn meal and flour instead of mix(adding the baking powder and salt as in directions on the box.) I also used 2 eggs and split the whites to beat separately and fold in at the end. I increased the milk to  1 and 1/4 cup.

I don't use cornbread mixes, so I just mixed the dry ingredients together as instructed on my bag of cornmeal. I did add about 1-¼ cups milk instead of ¾ cup. As for cheese, the first time I made these, all I had was some Gouda and Jarlsberg, so I grated them and use them in the waffles. Second time, I used a Cheddar and Monterrey Jack shredded cheese mix. I will say the Gouda and Jarlsberg had more flavor. Either way, I this is recipe is a winner. Delicious just on there own as a snack or served with chili or bowl of pinto beans. Yum!

I made them according to the recipe and they were delicious.  I served them hot topped with homemade chili, shredded cheese and a dollop of sour cream.  Wonderful!  gave my guests copies of the recipe.

Sorry, they didn't last long enough to take a picture.

Took out the pepper jack cheese and the bacon.  Added fresh jalapeno chopped peppers.  I first tried I tu like the picture, put under chili,  used it like crackers, very good.  Nut the best was, had some cold waffles and used then for sandwiches.  Great for a ham and egg sandwich with sliced tomatoes.  Bacon and egg with sliced tomato was good also

Tasty.  The cheese made the first waffle a little sticky in the waffle iron, but a more generous spritz or oil made subsequent waffles pop out clean.

A group of ladies and I won "best presentation" with these waffles topped with chili at a mock Iron Chef competition. It's a unique and tasty way to enjoy chili and cornbread on a cool, winter evening.

Luscious!  A great twist on a grandkid favorite here.  I add shredded carrots and shredded cheddar to Jiffy mix because our grandson wouldn't eat meat or veggies when he was small but he loved waffles.  Sneaky and delicious.  Now the 5 year old does the peeling and shredding (in the food processor) and mixing.  All I get to do is deal with the sharp knife and hot waffle iron.  As soon as she can do those things I'm out of a job.
