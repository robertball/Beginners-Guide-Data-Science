If you're looking for a way to use up green tomatoes, this is a great recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  Next time I would probably add garlic while cooking the onion.  The flavor is wonderful, and I think it would be great tossed with pasta, not even using the fish.  This will definitely be a go-to recipe when I have green tomatoes.

I made this tonight with sliced chicken breast instead of tilapia. I followed the recipe, but added 1/2 diced jalapeño. I served it over buttered jasmine rice. It was delightful. When the hubby was finished with his second serving, I said, "so you like green tomatoes of they are with red tomatoes?". The look on his face ??. It was a hit!!

This was a good recipe -  I had fresh plum tomatoes and green tomatoes so I used those with a little cherry pepper - Next time I would kick it up with a little more heat with maybe a little jalapeño and a little garlic -  over all though , it was very good

I made it with fresh green and red tomatoes with fresh sweet banana peppers and enjoyed this over pasta.  We liked the tart, bright flavor and look forward to trying it again with fish.  Thanks for a nice recipe to use with the abundance of produce that must be be picked to save it from frost.

Very tasty! Only change I made was omitting the onions.  Nice combination and I will make again!
