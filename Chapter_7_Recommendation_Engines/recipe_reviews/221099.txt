As written, I did not care for this recipe. I went back and doctored it the next day.  Keep in mind that most of the flavor in this dish comes from the pasta sauce as the only seasonings added are garlic and red pepper flakes, so definitely use a quality, flavorful sauce.  Also, the time listed in the recipe to cook the veggies is really not enough to combine flavors and cook down the veggies enough to work with the pasta.  Reheating the leftovers and adding salt, pepper, oregano, rosemary, basil, and fresh parsley and cooking it down a little really helped.

If you want to get a nice well-rounded meal in a little over an hour, then this recipe is great! My family and I loved it. I added salt, black pepper, and Cajun seasoning to the chicken before cooking it, and added some cayenne to my pasta sauce for an extra kick. Otherwise, I liked that minimal spices let the flavor of the chicken and vegetables really stand out. I'll make it again, for sure. Thanks for a great recipe!
