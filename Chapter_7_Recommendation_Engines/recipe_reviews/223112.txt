Formula could be used instead of breast milk. Some blenders work better than others. It is ok to keep adding more liquid until  you get the consistency your baby likes. If you make it too liquidy, you can always add rice cereal or oatmeal after thawing it.

I use this method to make all of my homemade baby food. Freezes very well! I used the cooking water instead of breast milk to thin out the peas. I just do not have that much breastmilk pumped at the moment. The cooking water contains some vitamins and nutrients which have been leached out during the cooking process. Excellent post for new parents!
