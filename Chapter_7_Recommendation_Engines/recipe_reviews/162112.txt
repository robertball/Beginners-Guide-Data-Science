I loved this, as did my kids. My husband did not. Too bad for him. I did add two tbsp. of honey to thicken up the marinate a bit and I used just-squeezed lime juice. I let this sit in the marinate in a shallow baking dish all day. Intense flavor. I suggest you scrunch up the rosemary a bit with a mortar and pestle(or do what I did and use a bowl and the bottom of your ice cream scooper) to bring out the flavor more.

great recipe!  i had no fresh lime juice or garlic cloves on hand. So, i substituted lemon juice and garlic powder (to taste) and it was fabulous! my 4 chops marinated for 3 hours. I baked in pan a little with olive oil and remaining marinade at 375 for about 25 mins, basting periodically. JUICY! DELICIOUS! also, its a tad spicy, not for the kidos.

this was yummy but I added olive oil, little bit of water and some sugar. It was too pungent and sour so that's why I altered it

1/2 cup of lime juice was a bit too much for my tastes.  Next time, I'll try it with 1/4 cup.  Otherwise, very tasty and nice way to dress up pork chops.  I wish I had a way to give this 4.5 stars.

I used this recipe as someone suggested to marinate pork prior to making the stuffed pork tenderloin. I marinated it overnight.  The flavor of lime was a bit too strong for my liking, but since the pork was stuffed, it evened out the strong taste.  Next time, I might just marinate it for a couple of hours.

My wife really enjoyed this one. It has a citrus like flavor which works really well with pork. I worried that the cayenne pepper, left to marinade for many hours, may make the meat too spicy hot. Turns out, it was fine. In fact, I might add more cayenne pepper next time I try this; we could barely taste that ingredient.

Very good, but could use more depth.  Perhaps something sweet to offset it a bit?

Wow what a great recipe.  Made this as written with no changes.  Roistered on the BBQ.  Meat was tender and full of flavour.  Yes there was a lime taste but to us it was not over powering.  Will be making again.

I thought it was okay, hubby did not like at all. It was, as others have mentioned, too limey. I think that I will try it again-and on chicken, I think it would be better-without as much lime juice.

This was an easy to make, tasty marinade, and I halved the recipe for use on three pork chops. I used fresh rosemary, doubled the garlic and while I did use dried ginger (it is all I had on hand) will try fresh the next time.  Thanks for the recipe, Cara.

We marinated some 3/4" boneless pork chops in this for about 4 hours.   Really delish.

Great recipe, though I modified it a bit.  Since I didn't have lime juice, I used orange juice.  Doubled the recipe and marinated 6 pork loin chops for about 6 hours, then grilled. They were yummy, flavorful and tender, though I think I will probably use about half the rosemary next time.  It was a bit overpowering for our taste.

The pork chops came out so tender and juicy. The reason I gave it a "4" is that the lime was overwhelming. It may have been that I marinated the pork cutlets for too long -- about 6 hours -- or that I was using a thin cut. Next time I will either cut down on the time or use it on a thicker cut of meat. This is a keeper, especially for those looking for a low calorie way of preparing a different tasting, flavorful pork recipe.

I cut the lime juice to about 1/4 cup, and added a little more rosemary. I added the pork country style ribs to the bag and froze them. When ready to use, I removed the bag from the freezer in the morning to defrost and marinade the meat. I then grilled the pork. It was absolutely delicious. Everyone, including my grandson who likes things “plain” asked for seconds. The citrus flavor was not at all overpowering, since I cut down in the lime juice. Will make again.

This was so tasty! I was a bit surprised by the slight kick at the end of each bite but I am loving it. It is just the right amount of flavor. I will definitely use this marinade again.

I liked it fine.  My wife didn't.  She found it too spicy.  I thought is was delicious.  I was only able to marinate for about 45 minutes.

This was a delicious recipe! So, so, so much flavor! I marinated pork tenderloin for about 6 hours and grilled outside. While grilling my husband basted the meat. My dinner guests raved about it.

Hubs really enjoyed this and commented about the great flavour. We don't like lime so subbed lemon for the lime. Otherwise I made this as written. Next time, and there will be a next time, I will use fresh ginger in place of the dried. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

UPDATE: i'm putting my update first b/c i actually followed the recipe this time! only thing i added was 1 3/4 tsp of salt because i was marinating 1 3/4 lbs of pork chops.. it was very tasty and not overpowering in any sense.. i marinated for about 7-8 hours.. glad i gave this another try.. ty for the recipe.. ~~ORIGINAL: this was a nice start for what i ended up making for a marinade.. i used 1/4 cup each of lemon and cider vinegar, 2 tsp each fresh thyme and ginger, and left the pepper and garlic amounts the same.. also added one tsp of kosher salt.. i really enjoyed the kick of the cayenne and i'm sure we would have loved the lime.. i worry that using so much ground ginger would be overpowering but we'll see if there's a next time to try it out.. ty for the recipe

I did add 2 T honey as someone suggested and I subbed red pepper flakes for the cayenne.  Marinated about 8 hours. But it worked out well and tasted great!  I'll make this again.

Very good. My daughter made this for us, everyone liked it but my husband thought the lime and rosemary were too strong but then he likes things fairly bland :)
