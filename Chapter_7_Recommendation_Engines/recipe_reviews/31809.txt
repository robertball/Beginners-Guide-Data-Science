I don't know if some of the other reviewers expected gourmet results (from buscuit dough?), but this isd the basis for a quick tasty, light meal. Pre-baking the flattened buscuits with the egg wash and seasoning was key for us. Then, we just added whatever toppings each person wanted and it was great. My daughter selected BBQ sauce instead of the traditional marinara - and it was tasty. We skipped the more exotic ingredients (feta, pepper flakes) and stuck with combinations of sausage, cheese and sauce. This was sooooo quick and easy! Thanks for the idea!

I really liked this concept and I can't wait to try it exactly as it was posted. However, I did NOT bake the recipe in the manner it was stated in the recipe. My five year old and I just used it to make mini cheese pizzas. (So base my rating on the concept of this recipe more than the actual ingredient list.) It was great and he really enjoyed making them. I took the advice of another poster and prebaked the crust part for five minutes. I did sprinkle the dough with garlic and italian seasonings prior to baking. I then baked for five minutes. Then added the sauce and cheese and toppings and baked for about ten minutes. Fun, Tasty, and easy!!!!!

These were so fun to make, and very delicious.  I used the smaller can of bisquits (7.5 oz).  Instead of flattening them with a 4" cup, I actually flattened them out with my fingers.  I covered the dough with the egg mixture, sprinkled some garlic salt over each, and pre-baked the dough for about 5 minutes.  I then pulled them out of the oven and added the sauce and mozz. cheese.  I also sprinkled some classic Pizza Seasonings with hot pepper over all.  Delicious!

The kids loved these! I had a hard time pressing the biscuits out and never did get them out to 4 inches.  It was also hard to get a rim around them, but I will probably make them again.

Very yummy - interesting taste with the hot sauce and feta cheese.  Took longer to prepare than what was indicated, but that was ok.  Very heavy meal.

I liked these and they were easy to make. My kids did not like the biscuit dough as a crust. They felt they would like the mixture on something that was more like a pizza crust. They told me not to make them again.

Followed the directions except that we made them vegetarian, omitted the feta, and forgot the egg wash. The children topped their own and loved them! They are already asking to make them again.

I wanted to fix pizza but did not want to make my own crust.  I was so impressed with this idea.  My kids loved it!  I will definitely make this again, especially when my son has his friends over.

This was Great. Added Bacon instead of pepperoni and diced bell peppers. I used the bottom of a large coffee cup flatten dough worked perfect flattened middle and made a rim for the crust.

Didn't have any pepperoni (don't care for it anyway).  Added some fresh mushrooms to several of the pizzas. Teenaged daughter complained she couldn't taste the feta enough... I'm inclined to agree.  Otherwise, quite good, fast and tasty!  Also used Grands brand flaky biscuits.  Rolled them out on board with rolling pin and pre-baked them for 5 minutes.  Worked well.

I didn't have ground been so just used pepperoni slices. Left out the feta and used mozzerlla (more kid friendly).. I decided to flatten my buscuits into muffin tins. Turned out great!

I followed the recipe exactly, it was ... just off. Too salty due to the biscuit dough and the worcestershire, pizza sauce and the peperoni. We won't be trying this recipe again.

i made these for the kids for lunch today using 2 uncooked leftover biscuits.  i scaled down the rest of the ingredients to make it work, and combined some other leftovers to make things easier.  they seemed to really enjoy them - they both ate theirs entirely so that's a good sign.  the biggest plus is how quickly you can make them and serve them.  thanks!

We loved this idea. I did not have some of the ingredients on hand so I improvized. I cooked the hamburger with green peppers and onions. After it was cooked i ground up the meat mixture in my magic bullet before adding the sauce. i did precook the biscuts for 5 minutes first but i forgot about brushing with the egg untill it was too late but it came out really really good and the kids loved it cause they couldn't see the veggies

The kids especially loved this recipe, since it's sized just right for them.  The feta cheese may sound odd, but it blended in and lightened up the dish and made it lest greasy.  I think the title is misleading since they are definitly NOT the greasy cheeseburger flavor stuff.

These were absolutely fabulous!  They did take a little longer to prepare than it says and I did not worry about making the lip in the dough.  It did not seem to matter and everyone loved them.

This recipe was really easy and my kids loved them.  I substituted ground italian sausage for the ground beef.  That seemed to work really well because i didn't need to use as much seasonings.

I REALLY LIKED THESE. I DIDNT USE THE FETA CHEESE(PERSONAL TASTE)AND DIDNT BRUSH WITH EGG YOLK. THEY STILL TURNED OUT GOOD. WOULD BE A GREAT APPETIZER.
