They do take quite a while to make, but so worth it!  I made them a little different and don't refidgerate for 2 days either.  I make a coconut filling, but without nuts and refidgerate.  Make the chocolate cookie part and put in the freezer for 1 hour, after that roll flat between two pieces of wax paper and lay flat in the refidgerater for 2 hours or freezer for 1/2 hour more.  After chilling time cut the chocolate into circles (I used a glass).  Put about a tablespoon of coconut mixture in the center and fold up the cookie around it.  Flatten the bottoms and put on a cookie sheet.  Continue with the remaining dough and then refidgerate for another 1/2 hour or so.  Then bake until set.  So yummy!  I never have leftovers.  They take a while to make and are involved, but are soooo  worth it!

This turned out nothing like the chocolate macaroons that I remember from childhood ... these are more like soggy centered cookies rather than the old fashioned chocolate coconut clusters. Having to refrigerate the dough for 2 days was a real disappointment to my 13 year old daughter who started out making them. Definitely would not recommend them!

I wish I understood the physics for having in the refrigerator for two days, but I did as instructed, although I question the necessity.  The cookies didn't have a lot of chocolate flavor but it was still a tasty cookie that we enjoyed.

These are good-the 2-day wait is a little off-putting, but they are really tasty!
