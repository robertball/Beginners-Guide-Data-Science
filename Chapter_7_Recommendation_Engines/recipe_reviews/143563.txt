This recipe is great!! A lot better then the other I had which was a bit too much sugar, and instead of the heavy cream I used 1  8oz container of coolwhip and the whole jar of cherries plus a few handfuls more of marshmallows. A very good dessert to take for a dish at an outing. A different kind of fruit salad.

I had this once at my sister's house and she called it Frog Eye Salad.  It was a great way to get the kids eating fruit.  It is a little sweet and it yields a lot. Great for potlucks.

Woooow, don't double the recipe!  I do not have a bowl big enough to hold the doubled recipe.  I should have looked at the serving size.  One cup of this salad would be pretty heavy.  Made it with real whipped cream, yummy!  I added the fruit to the pasta and custard to help keep the mixture from sticking together.
