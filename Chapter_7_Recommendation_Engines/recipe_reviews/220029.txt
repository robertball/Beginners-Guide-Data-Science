To make it a main meal I added hamburger with a bit of taco seasoning in it. Otherwise a quick easy dish that is not to bad. I might add a bit more milk next time tho. I like my cheese a bit more creamy.

This was simple yes, but I didn't care for it at all. It was a little bland which I was surprised by. I'm not really sure what I could add to it to enjoy the taste, which is a personal thing. Some might like this, I just didn't.

This was just gross. It had no flavor at all! I even added taco meat and it just wasn't good.
