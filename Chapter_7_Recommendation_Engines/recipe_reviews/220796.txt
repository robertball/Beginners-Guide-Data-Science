Since we live at a high altitude, the box directions suggested  I add 1/2 flour and 1/3 water, instead of 1/4.  I also added an extra egg (3 total) to make the brownies more cake-like.  This recipe suggests baking for 20 min.  I had to keep putting them back in the oven for 30 minutes.  Still some were a little gooey.

The kids really liked these! I think I may have over filled mine b/c they seemed to bake over, but the kids didn't mind. They said it was like the 'ice cream' was melting, lol. I put out some toppings and let them decorate their own cones...they had a ball! I would make these again...Thanks for sharing. :)

Sorry, won't make these again.  They didn't rise and were really hard.  I probably overcooked them, but still, they just weren't good.

I made these just as directed, except I also ended up baking them for longer.  In all, I baked them for about 35 minutes.  It was well worth it!  They taste like a brownie flavored ice cream cone, only they're not cold on your teeth when you bite into them!
