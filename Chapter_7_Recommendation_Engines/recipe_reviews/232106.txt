After laying the potatoes on the baking sheet, I noticed I should've sprayed it. The fries I was able to scrape off were excellent! This is my new go to for fries!! Just spray your pan!!

I'm kind of a recipe snob... what I mean by that is I usually make recipes that several hundred people have tried and loved. These potato wedges don't have that many reviews yet, but it's well on its way! Seriously. These are delicious and need no modification!

These were amazing!! Before I put them in the oven, I gave a little bit of a sprinkle of salt, and an extra shake of Cajun Seasoning (we like them spicy).

I recommend spraying your cooking sheet with non-stick spray. Other than that, these are the bomb.com! I was a little heavy handed with the seasoning and also added smoked paprika but that is the beauty with this recipe, it is open to changes.

Full of flavor, I made half of the recipe and it seemed like it was too much oil. 
Definitely I recommend greasing the pan before cooking them because even with the oil from the recipe they still ended up sticking to the pan. You can also use a silicon pad. 
After 20 minutes in the oven, I rotated them and sprinkled with additional salt.

Easy to make!  Salt is not needed!  Bakes in about half the time!  Great taste!  What's not to love about these?

These are delicious! And sooo easy - shake n bake! We cut the oil in half to save calories & fat.  We also used “Slap Ya Mama” (hotter mix) for the cajun seasoning.  We mixed some of this seasoning in with our ketchup too - plan to do this regularly as it really adds a nice flavor to boring ketchup.  We plan to make these again and again and again and....

I picked up some "Slap Yo Mama" Cajun seasoning in Louisiana, and used it for this recipe. Family and friends loved it! This will be made again for sure.

Loved these! I used less oil than the recipe called for and microwaved my fries for 5 minutes first to reduce oven cooking time. Besides that I followed the recipe and the flavor was wonderful! Paired these with some quinoa black bean burgers, yuuuuum!!!!!

These turned out perfect!  Followed the recipe exactly and took other reviewers' advice and used parchment paper so no sticking to the pan.  So good!

I made the recipe per the instructions however I  was not impressed with its outcome. I may try one more time and not bake quite as long since I found them to taste a bit overdone.

I scaled this down to 2 servings and was afraid the seasoning would not be enough, but it was perfect! Lots of flavor.
