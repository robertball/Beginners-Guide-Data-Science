These little treats are a favorite of this family. When I make them, I use all beef hot dogs. This is also really good with Lil' Smokies. I like to serve them with a sauce made of chili sauce and grape jelly to dip.......as if they weren't already sweet enough. ;)

What a fun little appetizer for a casual cookout.  Let’s be realistic – this is heart attack food, but one or two pieces won’t kill you.  They take no time to put together, and I cooked them on the outdoor grill before I put on the hamburgers.  Very easy and fun.

Made this several times. I use cocktail weiners - sometimes smokies sometimes the ones with cheddar. If you want one don't turn your back on the plate at my house... they disappear quickly!!

Hot dogs wrapped in bacon came out pretty well. Brown sugar & butter ended up being more like caramel than a sauce. Kind of disappointed.
