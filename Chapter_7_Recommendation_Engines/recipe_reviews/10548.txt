I really wanted this recipe to work but I just could not get these cookies to "roll" for me. When making this recipe make a double batch of the cookie dough so you have enough to play with until you get it right and unless you have help make only a few at a time because they harden to fast.

This cookie was good but you have to move very quickly to get these rolled-which you must do as soon as they come out of the oven so you constantly burn your fingers. I found after several batches to make sure when you spread the batter its not too thick or your cookies will crack as you try to roll them. Also I found that the chocolate filling it called for was not enough I needed to make more.
