Wow!  What a fabulous recipe.  I feared the maple flavor would be too strong and these would taste like pancakes- but that wasn't the case at all.  I used the real maple syrup (not pancake syrup) and the end result was a rich, cinnamony sweet cookie.  Fantastic.  This recipe is a keeper!  I've made these cookies several times now and I had to make a few changes to the recipe.  I really like my cookies to be soft and cinnamony, so I used 3 tablespoons ground cinnamon in the dough, and instead of 1 cup of white sugar I changed it to 3/4 cup white and 1/4 cup brown sugar for the dough.  I also used crisco butter flavored shortening sticks in place of magragine, as shortening doesn't spread as much.  I also never use all of the flour mixture- I blend in enough to make sure the dough is soft, not sticky, and I end up throwing about 1/4 cup of it away.  This has happened everytime I make them- if I use all of the flour, the cookies turn into dry 'rocks'.

Make sure everything is blended REALLY REALLY REAllY well and do NOT OVERBAKE- I take them out as soon as they look like they're hard enough on top but still "wet" in the middle.  If you slice a cookie open right after I take it out of the oven, it doesn't look done in the middle, but if you wait until the cookie cools to take it off of the cookie sheet, it sets up and the result is a cookie that stays soft for DAYS.  Thanks again for such a wonderful recipe! :)

MmMM!!! That was ooone good cookie. This is my snickerdoodle recipe now. I didn't have maple sugar so rolled the cookies in 2 Tbsp. of sugar mixed with 2 tsp of cinnamon. The best snickerdoodles I have ever tasted. Chewy and soft. Even my fiancee who hates cinnamon thought it was delicious.  Didn't give me three dozen, only two. But then again I make my cookies kind of big. Enjoy the recipe fellow bakers!!

Love these!  The maple flavor is nice, but not overpowering.  Following the advice of others, I added a few extra glugs of syrup.  I didn't look for maple sugar, just used a regular sugar and cinnamon mixture.  I think next time I will make the effort and look for the maple sugar.  As soon as they cooled I froze them, so I'm not sure how chewy they stay yet.  They're really great warm, though! **REVISED NOTE- This year, I made the effort, and found the maple sugar.  It was EXPENSIVE, but the difference it made in the taste of the cookie was so pronounced it was worth it.  Fantastic!

This recipe is one of those happy surprises - even though you think it's going to be good or you wouldn't have made it in the first place,  it actually exceeds your expectations. These are pretty little cookies, chewy and soft both. Buttery good, not too sweet, and nicely spiced with just the perfect amount of cinnamon.  But it is the maple syrup (I used Grade B for boldest flavor) and the maple sugar that truly make this an  exceptional cookie.  The dough, too, is beautiful and cooperative - it's easy to work with and does just want you want it to.   Other than substituting butter for the margarine I followed the recipe as written and found it produced a perfect cookie.  Hubs, who typically prefers very rich desserts, loved these.  He also never rates any recipe  five stars - but he did with these.  I love it when we both agree!

Yummy! I was afraid of an overwhelming maple taste or too sweet but these are delightful! I couldn't find the maple sugar so I put a few drops maple extract in a sealed container with 1/4 cup white sugar. I shook it for about 15 minutes. Then I poured in 1/2 cup white sugar. There were a few lumps and it was wet sugar until I added the white sugar. I only shook that unitl just mixed.  I'm sure it's not as good as maple sugar but it'll do in a pinch. I think these'll be a staple of my Christmas cookie baking!!

Awesome cookies! I made these because my chocolate chip cookies are famous at work. A co-worker asked if I could make Snickerdoodles as well as I could chocolate chip. I have never made them, so I searched and found this recipe. They melt in your mouth with a satisfyingly crunchy outside. I did not have maple sugar so I used a mix of white sugar, brown sugar and a small amount on cinnamon to roll them in. I also stirred about 1 tsp of pure maple syrup into the sugar mixture. Not sure if it helped, but it worked! Also, I do NOT use margarine for anything, so I just used the same amount of melted butter. I always use melted butter in recipes - it's the secret to soft cookies!

Awesome! I will definetly make these again!

This was a wonderful treat!  Soft, chewy, so tasty!  I was looking for a simple, soft cookie and this is it!  I didn't have the maple sugar, so I rolled the cookies in a basic cinnamon/sugar mix and they turned out perfect!  I took some to work the next day and everyone loved them!  Thank you Linda!

This recipe gets an A+ from my family. I bake a lot as well, and am quite critical when trying new recipes. I used real unsalted butter in place of margarine, added 1/2 tsp. real vanilla extract, and 1/2 tsp. maple extract. The cookies baked beautifully and tasted delicious! Thank you for sharing this recipe!!!

I found this recipe just in time for a bridal shower that I was hosted as I was looking for an easy cookie to package as favors.  This recipe was my choice as there is no milk used in the batter.  One of my guests was milk and corn allergic so I used a soy based, corn absent "butter".  VERY EASY to make and no fuss since I was also making a lot of other more complicated dishes.  

The first test batch I made I thought that I did something wrong as the cookies were so moist on the insides that I had a hard time removing them from the cookie sheet.  Each batch afterwards I chilled the dough for an hour or so before baking as I felt without it, it would be a bit to sticky for me to get a dollop off my fingers and onto the tray!  This, I feel helped out greatly and I realized that the joy of this cookie is the slightly chewy middle!  This recipe was a HUGE success!  Despite the fact that only one person at the shower had ever heard of a Snickerdoodle, more than half the guests have requested this recipe even with the soy products that I used!  Just Yummy, pure yummy!!

I never give a rating or review for a recipe that I changes a lot while making. However, I was out of all of the dairy needed for this recipe and ended up using veggie oil in place of margrine and arrowroot powder in place of eggs. The cookies turned out to be absolutly incredible! I will make these again many times! My picky husband couldnt keep away from the crisp, doughy goodness on the plate and they were gone in less then an hour!

I am the owner of this recipe and have modified it even more for perfection every time:

3/4 cup butter
1/4 cup shortening
1-1/2 cups white sugar
6 Tbsp GRADE B maple syrup (it's worth it!)
2 Large Eggs
3 tsp Baking Powder
1/2 tsp Baking Soda
2 tsp Cinnamon
3 cups Flour (less if too dry, more if too sticky)
1/2 cup Maple Sugar (or cinnamon sugar or a combination of both, which is what I use)

This recipe doubles beautifully! Don't overbake!

This was quite as easy recipe to follow. I love the snickerdoodles from pepperidge farm and was hoping these would be as soft and tasty.   Read reviews before making and was prepared for dough to be a little dry and to cook them a little longer than suggested, other than that...no problems. I will definitely  make them again. Oh yeah, I didn't buy the maple sugar, too expensive and none of my stores had maple extract so I used the maple syrup in the sugar and tasted fine to me! TASTY, they are! I took them to a cookie swap where there were at least 12 other cookies and at least one person liked these the best!  Is there a tweak to make them stay soft and chewy like when they come right out the oven?

The only change I had to make was not to use maple sugar as I didn't have any.  These were terrific without it.  I just rolled in cinnamon/sugar.  We could definitely taste the maple flavor in these.  They were a little crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.  Perfect alternative to the usual snickerdoodle.

Definitely worth a try; however, I will stick to the traditional Snickerdoodles recipe.  I used all butter, half white and brown sugar, added a 1/4 tsp of salt.  To roll the dough into the sugar mixture, I used half white and brown sugar and some cinnamon.

Made these using Grade B maple syrup and butte instead of margerine.  They came out great!  I also used a  1 tbls of maple syrup and mxed it with the sugar to roll the cookies in and it turned out great!  Gave a nice crispness for the top of the cookies.  Will be making this recipe a lot in the future!

Unfortunately I couldn't find maple sugar, but I liked the idea of maple snicker doodles and decided to try and make them work.  I instead cooked down the maple syrup to concentrate the flavor, and substituted a mix of white and brown sugar.  They were fantastic.

These cookies were just the right sweet to take to a Christmas party - no one else had made anything like them and they were a big hit.  I doubled the recipe and had put some away for our family to eat later, but they were best eaten within 3-4 days.  By day five, they were too hard for us to eat.  These are especially yummy right out of the oven!

These cookies taste good but they do not have enough maple flavor for my taste, they just taste like snickerdoodles, and i followed the directions, and used real maple sugar and syrup but still found myself craving more maple.

My husband loves Snickerdoodles and my family makes homemade maple syrup which he also loves, so I thought I'd try this different recipe. They turned out great! I had to bake them a little bit longer than 10 minutes but not much longer. The edges get a bit crispy but the majority of the cookie stayed soft and chewy. The taste and texture were great!

Great taste but had problems cooking them.  The cookies didn't spread like I expected and remained as little "lumps".  Also had a hard time judging if they were cooked.  I will try again with less flour, and hopefully that will make them excellent.

These are REALLY good.  I had no maple sugar, so I just rolled them in cinnamon sugar.  Only issue I had was that I had to push them down with a fork and then cook them for longer than it says, but I wonder if it's because I live at a higher altitude?  Very good cookies!

these come out great. instead of margarine I used regular butter (salted) and it still comes out good. 
another time I didn't have maple syrup and just skipped that and it still was a good snickerdoodle cookie recipe! 
these are extremely sweet though I have to say. if you want them to be less sweet especially when you're using the maple syrup cut out some of the sugar but not too much.

I have made this recipe many times and it is much loved by the kids. Great texture of crispy on the outside and soft and chewy in the middle but for me it is too sweet and the sugar kills the flavor of both the maple and cinnamon. I read all of the very helpful reviews posted here and made three batches today. Here are my changes: drop the sugar down to 3/4 cup, add a pinch of salt, up the baking soda to 1/2 tsp, weigh the flour making sure you only have only 9 oz and add it by hand, use butter and make it an extra large egg. I rolled the cookie in 5 oz of white sugar mixed with 1/2 tsp cinnamon (this could be reduced as I had a fair bit left over). Only cook for 8 minutes in a very well pre-heated oven. The cookies will not look done but will set nicely and if you turn them over they should be quite nicely browned on the bottom. They will puffed up when cooked but will sink as they cool. This recipe usually gets me around 30 - 32 cookies.

These were really great, and my family gobbled them up.  I added 1 tsp. maple extract along w/ the maple syrup. (It made for a more pronounced flavor).  For the maple sugar coating I added 1tsp. of maple extract to the 1/2 cup of white sugar.  Placed it into my mini food processor to incorporate well.  These cookies are warm and homey, and I will add to our family favorites.  Thank you for such a lovely recipe.

For the coating, I could not find "Maple Sugar" at the local grocery store, so with substituted with 1/4 cup white sugar + 1/2 tsp Imitation Maple Extract and mixed it together until all the globs were broken up, and then added the extra 1/4 cup of white sugar (instead of the 1/2 cup suggested) & it made plenty for the coating. Don't worry about the balls being too sticky, they're easy to work with once coated. Since I don't like getting my hands all sticky, I dipped a 1/2 TBSP measurement spoon into flour each time before scooping up that amount of dough, then tossed it in the sugar coat mix. I practically scraped the bowl, and to my surprise, yielded exactly 36. I baked for exactly 10 minutes, no more & no less, and I let it cool on stone plates. They are very soft when you bring them out, but once cool, they're so soft on the inside! I & the roomies loved them! I've baked only a handful of times & these came out so wonderful! Thank you, thank you, thank you for the great recipe!

To MAIREAD2: I used the eHow food (www.ehow.com/how_6530742_make-maple-sugar.html) directions for how to make the maple sugar, reducing the volume from the 2 gallons listed down to 1 cup in a 1qt pot.  After cooking to 255 degrees and then stirring it 5 min to sort of a fudge consistency, like it said to, I pressed it flat onto a silicone mat to cool.  After I chopped it up with a spatula, I had a little less than a 1-qt jar.  This amount seemed reasonable for the home cook, and doesn't cost too much. Hope this helps!
UPDATE: made these exactly as written and found the maple flavor too subtle (only had grade A, though), underdone at 10 minutes, and waay too sweet.  Will try again, subbing some maple sugar for the white in the dough, reducing the white sugar in the dough too, cutting the cinnamon down a little, and maybe rolling only in maple sugar.

I don't really have anything new to add, but these are truly delicious! I used a cinnamon+sugar mixture instead of maple sugar and they still turned out great. I added 3 extra maple syrup globs because the dough seemed a bit dry. They taste great with the littlest hint of maple syrup. They took about 15 minutes to bake, but I think it's because of the extra syrup and the fact that the balls were slightly larger than in the recipe.

Simply Great!  My husband, being Canadian, I am always on the lookout for maple this or that.  With my cookie scoop, this recipe made two dozen.  I followed the recipe, making on change, using butter instead of margarine.  I "made" the maple sugar by mixing in 1/4 t. to the rolling sugar and this worked out just fine.  I think the amount used for the rolling sugar is too much and can be cut in half!  I will use the excess on something I am sure, but I have lots left over.   With the larger size I baked these at 350 for 12 to 15 minutes.  This recipe, for sure, will be part of my rotation!  Many thanks for sharing!

I wish I could give more than 5 stars.  This recipe is everything you want in a recipe. It is accurate, easy to follow, and the end product is even better than you think it is going to be when read the ingredients for the first time. Just follow as written and this recipe is a great update to a classic Snickerdoodle.  Snickerdoodles were the first thing I ever made without adult help when I was a kid and I fell in love with them.  This recipe marries the best of what I think a classic Snickeddodle is with a great update.  The maple syrup and maple sugar add a great earthy sweetness.  It is worth the time and expense to fins good grade B maple syrup and maple sugar...as Alton  Brown says..."your patience will be rewarded".

I've been looking for a snickerdoodle recipe that did not contain shortening.  I used butter instead of margarine.  My husband said they were better than his mom's so I know this is a keeper recipe.  I thought the maple was subtle and enhanced the cookie without overpowering the cinnamon.  I used my 1 1/2" cookie scoop and got 36 cookies.  There was also alot of leftover coating mixture so you might want to cut that in half.  I'm just going to save the leftover sugar/maple sugar mixture for the next batch which, by the looks of the cookie jar, I'll be making very soon.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I loved these cookies! However I changed them quite a bit. I used butter instead of margarine, mainly because I just don't like margarine and almost always sub butter. I also omitted the cinnamon, added 5 T of maple syrup instead of 3, added 1/2 tsp maple extract and 1/2 tsp vanilla. I didn't have maple sugar so I just took all white sugar and shook it in a plastic baggie with a couple drops of maple extract. The dough was very soft so I made it into balls and rolled in sugar placed on cookie sheet and put it in the freezer for about 10 minutes then directly in the oven. Baked for about 12 minutes as my cookies were bigger then stated, the recipe only made about 18 cookies for me. I removed when the centers were still kind of soft but edges lightly browned, let sit on cookie sheet for a couple minutes before transfering to a cooling rack. This method always returns a soft cookie for me. The cookies were crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside with a slight maple flavor even with the additional flavoring. Yummy! I might try rolling in colored sprinkles next time since my kids would love that.

These were a big hit at a cookie swap. It was hard to tell when they were actually done, and my first batch I cooked a little too long, but still good. Great flavor and although I did not have the maple sugar, I added a drop or two of maple syrup to the sugar before rolling the dough in it and that seemed to work well.  I would make them again!

Ohhhh Yummmmm..... these are awesome.. i baked them a few min longer because i prefer a little harder to dip in milk. Dont be fooled if they look to puffy when you take them out-- they settle and harden as they sit!  Sooo good. Thanks for the recipe!!

Great recipe. I never use margarine - trans fats are terrible, and butter tastes better = easy choice. :)   Since they were maple cookies, I used maple syrup instead of the white sugar.  It made the batter more rich, and the cookies were wonderful with perfect texture.  You can make your own maple sugar by boiling down your pure maple syrup, pouring it out on parchment paper or a candymaking mat and letting it cool.  It will make crunchy/breakable sugar pieces.  But frankly, if you replace all of the sugar with pure maple syrup, it leaves a nice maple flavor already.  I end up usually using cardamon sugar mix for the top (organic evaporated cane juice, cinnamon, cardamon).  You want your batter to be too sticky to make a ball with your hand at first - this make for the chewy texture after baked.  You use a few spoons to scoop out batter, and drop it into the sugar mix.  You pinch a little sugar mix ontop of it, then you can roll it around in the sugar without half the mix ending up on your hand.  Just keep dropping in the dollops and coating with sugar.  If your dough is easy to roll balls before you coat with sugar, its probably too dry =/

I added an extra egg before spooning onto the cookie sheet, because I felt it was too dry and crumbly.  Overall, I really liked this, but would cut back on the sugar next time...I felt they were a bit too sweet.  I'll definitely try this one again.  I think it would go great with some vanilla ice cream!

Loved these cookies!  Wished the recipe made a bigger batch because 3 dozen just wasn't enough.  Addicting and so simple. I did add some vanilla oil to the dough though.  I'll double the recipe next time.

Good flavor. I used butter and rolled cookies in a cinnamon, white sugar, brown sugar mix. Think I need to soften the butter more, as mine didn't spread much. Also, I based for 12-13 minutes - 10 left mine way too wet in the middle.

So delicious!  It was a little too sweet for me, so maybe next time I'll cut down on the sugar.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly!

Very subtle maple flavor, which is nice.  You can tell there is something "special" or "extra" but it's not like a maple slap in the face.  The texture is perfect as well.  I'm not the biggest Snickerdoodle fan, but I love these cookies.  Thank you for sharing them!

I was attracted to this recipe because of the very maple-y ingredient list. I was also intrigued because I'd never heard of maple sugar and was curious to try it. (I found the maple sugar at Whole Foods market, by the way. I also used real maple syrup, as the recipe instructed.) I was disappointed that the recipe said only to use the maple sugar for rolling the dough balls in, so instead of 1 cup of white sugar for the dough, I put 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup maple sugar. Despite that, there still wasn't enough maple flavor for my taste. If I hadn't made them myself, I wouldn't know there was maple syrup in there, let alone maple sugar. And the cookies were way too sweet for my taste. One reviewer suggested the addition of salt, which I think would help. The texture (crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside) was perfect, though, so I think I might try these again, next time with the salt, less white sugar, and more maple syrup. And less cinnamon, too; I think it overpowers the maple flavor.

Although these cookies were "okay" they were too sweet.  I think one thing that could make them better would be to add 1/2 tsp. to 1 tsp. of salt.  They also didn't keep for very long.  They got dry and hard.

I have made these cookies about 10 times now, know the recipe by heart, and tell all of my friends to come get it off of this site...these cookies melt in your mouth, are easy to make, and the maple makes them so much better than regular snickerdoodles!

Just made this recipe for the second day in a row-- It's easy and absolutely delicious. I used the natural, Spectrum brand shortening and used coconut sugar in place of Maple sugar because I did not have Maple sugar (which I'm sure is delicious). But even so, the cookies turned out beautifully! Having the dark and light sugar crystals on the outside of the cookie looked really nice. The bake time worked perfectly for mine-- they remained soft. My daughter took them to her youth group, and she said the kids went "nuts" over them :)

excellent. I did not have maple sugar but did have maple flavoring so I made the maple sugar by mixing 1/2 cup raw sugar and 2 t. maple flavoring-used mixer. Other changes I made because I had the ingredients on hand were butter instead of margarine and raw sugar instead of white.

Gorgeous! I wasn't really sure what to expect as i have never had a snickerdoodle before but they were delicious. The maple and cinnamon were there but not overpowering. I rolled them in vanilla sugar as I was not really sure what maple sugar is. I will definitely be saving this recipe and making again.

I was not crazy about this recipe.  It was way too maple-y, I couldn't taste the cinnamon at all, even after coating the cookies in cinnamon-sugar since I didn't have any maple sugar.  They also did not spread at all and baked as balls that were set and crisp on the outside and raw in the middle.  It was not the yummy chewy kind of softness that you want in the middle of a cookie, it was raw and gooey.  Fortunately, this didn't make too many.  Probably will not be making again.  Sorry.

Stumbled across this recipe while looking for something else. I had all the ingredients (with the exception of maple sugar, I used cinnamon/sugar instead) so I decided to give them a try. I was making cookies for our high school volleyball team, 25 girls, so I used them as guinea pigs. They loved them! These will definetly become regulars in our house.

Used this recipe as well as another to come up with the perfect snickerdoodle. I used half butter and half shortening, cream of tartar, and added cinnamon to the dough. My dad loves snickerdoodles and anything maple flavored so I was excited to make these for him, and he loved them!

Ive made this twice now the first time with butter and using real maple sugar. Those were great! The second time with margarine and an addition of maple extract. I have to admit I like them better with real butter.. In the end either way I love them!!

Scrumptious cookies!  I didn't have maple sugar so rolled them in brown and white sugar mixed together and they turned out delicious!  Really quick and easy to make; a definite new favorite.

I made these according to the original recipe, except using 1/2 brown & 1/2 white sugar and 6 tbsp of good maple syrup. They are tasty and my husband likes them very much. I think I'd like them even better if they had a stronger maple flavor.

This recipe would be 5 star if it weren't for the incorrect ratio of wet to dry ingredients. Like another reviewer said, DO NOT add all of the flour mixture at once. Mix some in and add more if needed, otherwise you'll end up with dry cookies that barely spread. I didn't see that review until after I had mixed everything together and could tell there was no way my dough was moist enough. I was able to salvage it by adding another tablespoon of maple syrup and about 3 tablespoons melted butter.   Once I had fixed the problem, the cookies baked up beautifully and they tasted divine. Perfectly mapley without being overwhelming. Don't skimp on the maple sugar and whatever you do, don't use fake syrup.

Everytime I make these cookies, they turn out better every time! I luv the combination of the flavors cinnamon and maple in a cookie. the texture of the cookie is soft and chewy, with the extra delight of a maple sugar coating! These cookies taste great with a cup of coffee, a scoop of ice cream, or even your favorite flavor of afternoon tea! I like they are low-fat, too.

I just opened a jug of grade B maple syrup and wanted to make cookies. These looked easy enough and I had all the ingredients. The dough came together quickly and the cookies cracked beautifully (much better than my snickerdoodles.) However they are very sweet. Next time I'll cut down the sugar and I believe they'll be perfect.

The best cookie ever!  I get request for these all the time.  Every Christmas I bake cookies as gifts, and these are always included.  Only change is I use brown sugar instead of maple sugar to roll them in.  For some reason they always remind me of cinnamon pop tarts :) , but way way way better.

We made our own maple sugar.  I put about 4 tbsp of pure maple sugar and a bit of vanilla in 1/2 to 3/4 c sugar and baked on 175 for about 30 min stirring often!  Turned out great.  This was a great recipe to make with my daughter.  She loved rolling the cookies in the sugar!  Yum

Wow this was a good cookie!!! I used 1/4 cup of maple syrup instead of 2 tbsps, and I used a mixture of white sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg for the maple sugar mix since I didn't have any maple sugar. This cookie is so delicious!!! I'll definitely make it again.

I made these for a party after seeing that the recipe had five stars and it was a huge success!  Everyone loved them and several asked me for the recipe.  A real crowd-pleaser.  I substituted granulated brown sugar for the maple sugar but it tasted absolutely delicious.  Everyone thinks I'm a good baker because of this recipe;)

These are the BEST!!! I usually stick with chocolatey cookies, but I decided to try something different, and I'm so glad that I did.  These were amazing!  Instead of rolling them in maple sugar, I used cinnamon sugar, and they turned out great. I also used butter instead of margarine, and I replaced some of the sugar with extra maple syrup.  They were easy and had a great texture.  I usually have a hard time getting cookies to spread out in the oven, but these worked perfectly!  Everyone that I know loved these, and I even gave them as gifts.  They were great!

Amazing cookie--I went out to find neighbors to try them because they were so good! I was more than a little generous with the maple syrup in the batter; I think I may have put almost 4 tablespoons in. They were mapley enough for me. It's important to remember that most pure maple syrups have a very subtle flavor, so it won't have a strong "maple" taste if you're using the real thing instead of imitation stuff. But there's nothing better than the real thing, in my opinion. I didn't have maple sugar, but took an earlier reviewer's advice of just using cinnamon and nutmeg, and I felt like I didn't lose anything. I also cut the amount of sugar in half that I used to roll the dough balls in, 1/4 cup is more than enough. Such soft cookies! Definitely a make-again.

I bake a lot but these cookies turned out really sweet, way too much sugar in the recipe.  My boyfriend wouldn't even eat them and he eats anything!  I would cut down on the sugar or something.

Really nice cookies! I made 1.5 batches and got 61 cookies with my 1 tbsp scoop, baked for 10 minutes on Silpat lined sheets, I only needed 2 tbsps each of white sugar and maple sugar for rolling, I did add 1 tsp vanilla to the batter and used lactose free margarine for my friend who is lactose intolerant.

Excellent! Like many others, I didn't have any maple sugar, and couldn't find it. So I used the cinnamon sugar to roll them in. They turned out delicious! I'm going to find some maple sugar for the next batch!

Delicious!  Instead of the sugar/maple sugar coating, I drizzled them with a maple glaze by melting 1 Tbsp unsalted butter and 2 Tbsps real maple syrup in a small saucepan then whisking in 1/2 c powdered sugar until smooth.  I will definitely make these again!

Amazing! These cookies were the perfect combination of sweet and subtle, crunchy outside and chewy inside. I can't stop eating them. I couldn't find maple sugar, but brown sugar is fine as a substitute. Nor did I use actual maple syrup, but the regular (cheaper) syrup works just as well. Absolutely delicious!

I thought these were great.  I think I cooked them a little long. I followed the directions, but they were a little  crunchy.    Next time I will shorten the bake time by a few minutes.

I mostly followed this recipe- just upping the cinnamon to about 2 1/2tsp and making a cinnamon-sugar mix in place of maple sugar since I did not have any on hand... very good! I brought them in to work and they got great reviews! It helps to chill the dough before rolling them in the sugar mixture for it to hold its shape.

these were one of the best snickerdoodles I've ever had! The dough did seem a bit dry, and the cookies dried out in a day or two. These were good though so perhaps I can find a way to add a bit more liquid to the batter.

These cookies are very delicious. They really need to be watched when baking them though because if you over bake them then they come out crispy, which I prefer my cookies chewy. I even underbaked them in hopes they would continue cooking on the pan, didnt work out so well. The trick is finding the perfect baking time for your oven, bake them until they look like you want to give them just 1 more minute, slightly set in the middle. Remove them from the pan right away and cool. These cookies only hold up for about 2-3 days. They taste best warm!

I made exactly as written and they are amazing. We wanted to rename them, French Toast Cookies. We snuck a few when they were still warm...oh dear, they're addictive. This recipe went into our "favorites" file! Only thing different is they took a couple minutes longer to bake but I still kept them under-cooked just a bit. (that's the secret to a perfect cookie)

I am a pretty forgiving reviewer but I found these cookies just so so. I had to mash them down or they would not have flattened on their own. They were subtle. Like a shortbread cookie, not tremendously sweet. They needed a longer cooking time than listed. I'm at sea level. I made these for kids. I'd make them for adults for a tea cookie next time. I wonder if a bit of maple extract would impart more flavor. I'd try that.

Great recipe. It was delicious.  It doesn't need as much sugar mixture to coat, I ended up having a lot left over. These were gone in less than 24 hours. I will make these again.

YUM!  Like many other reviewers, I did not have maple sugar.  So, to compensate, I use all white sugar with a tiny bit of maple syrup mixed in.  If you add a small enough amount (about 1 tsp to a full cup of sugar) and mix it thoroughly, you can end up with a crumbly sugar mixture that has the maple taste, but is still powdery enough to roll the cookies into.

Definitely not as mapley as I thought it might be w/ the name being what it is. But that's a good thing for me. This recipe was simple and turned out great. I didn't use the maple sugar though. For the last step I just mixed about 1/4 cup of brown sugar, 1/2-3/4 cup of white sugar and some ground cinnamon (made 2 batches). Definitely not as mapley as I'm sure it would have been with the maple sugar, but still a good cookie.

I really wanted to like these...they sounded amazing. However I could not taste the maple AT ALL!! I used 6tbsp real maple syrup and the maple sugar combo, reduced the cinnamon hoping the maple would shine through...and couldn't taste maple. Really bummed. Otherwise the texture was good, I used the authors modified version of the recipe that she later posted. One other thing...real snickerdoodles have cream of tartar and it is missing from this recipe. These ended up being kind of bland for me. I might try again using maple extract.

Maybe it was just me making the cookies too big, but I had to cook them several minutes longer since they were raw inside at 10 min. And much more fluffy than the picture.  I did what was suggested...rolling them in sugar, brown sugar and Cinnamon..very tasty!  I was surprised at the batter being very powdery...I had to spray Pam on my hands to keep it from sticking to my fingers...just a tip ;-)

Fantastic! They were a bit sweet for me the first time so I changed it a little the 2nd. I cut the sugar down to 1/3 brown sugar and 1/3 white sugar. I also added a 2nd egg to make them a bit fluffier and used real butter. A favorite! Bringing them to the in-laws this weekend. They should stand up to her amazing desserts without a problem.

This was my first experience making snickerdoodles. I used pancake syrup instead of maple, which seemed to work fine, I think it's a matter of preference. These were okay, not astounding, but I never had a snickerdoodle I was fond of anyway. My problem was that they were hard and chewy, not tender and soft. I did the minimum time amount, so if I did this recipe again, I would try baking for 1-2 minutes less.

I'm not too sure about these yet. I'm going to have to make them again. My first batch turned into little cinnamon rocks. Chewy on the inside but didn't spread at all. I'm wondering if this has something to do with my using HFCS free Log Cabin Pancake syrup... not sure if it counts as real maple syrup. Also didn't have the maple sugar so I substituted brown sugar and added a little cinnamon to the mix. I'm going to cut out 1/4 cup of flour as someone else did and try these again in a full rather than half recipe. Hope they turn out.

These are absolutely the best snickerdoodles I've ever had. I didn't have any maple syrup on hand (the proper stuff is pricey here in England) so I used maple-flavored golden syrup, which seemed to work just as well. Good tip for any brits out there! I also used sillygirl1's tip of taking the cookies out of the oven when they still looked a little bit underdone on top - worked a charm!

These cookies were disappointing. I used maple sugar and even added additional maple syrup, but the maple flavor was not especially obvious. Worse yet, the cookies were too floury and dry. I won't make these again.

These were very good, but the batter was gooey, so I kept having to add more flour to get it to a thicker consistancy.Could not roll the dough in the sugar still so I just sprinkled it on.  Still had a great taste.

Wonderful!!  I used the maple sugar/sugar blend, but substituted splenda in the cookie part.  I cooked it for exactly 8 minutes, ended up with 2.5 dozen.  Incredibly yummy--this will be a staple in my fall baking.

These are pretty good.  They taste more like a spice cookie than a snickerdoodle.

I only used 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and added 1/4 tsp. maple extract in this recipe. Everything else I kept the same. I didn't have maple sugar, so I rolled it in plain sugar. The flavor of these cookies is phenom, BUT I didn't care for how dry they were. If I were to make these again, I'd double it, use half butter/half margerine or shortening and cut back the flour by a half cup. Then, they might be more my speed.

These cookies were great!  I didn't have real maple syrup, so I used pancake syrup.  I also added about 1 tsp vanilla extract.  I rolled them in cinnamon cugar.  They were lighty crispy on the outside and wonderfully chewy on the inside.  After rolling each new batch, I did put the dough in the fridge to help with stickiness.  Great cookie that I will absolutely make again and again.  Next time I will use real maple syrup or maple extract.

I was a little hesitant with this recipe because sometimes the recipes i choose result in sloppy cookies, but these were really good! I used 1/4 c of cream cheese instead or 1/2 c butter to make them extra moist, and it made them super yum yum. great taste, great texture, wonderful cookies!

This recipe was wonderful!! I had to cook the cookies a little longer then called for, but thanks to the hints I knew they were done when they started to crackle.
Note: I did not find any maple sugar to use so I substituted 1/2 brown sugar and half white sugar and added a 3 tbsp cinnamon.

+1 point good idea
+1 point effort

These sounded great and were a huge disapointment, they are too doughy for me.

I made the recipe verbatium and found the dough a bit dry and hard to roll. Cooked for 7 min at 350 like a standard snickerdoodle and some spread into a mess others didn't change shape at all. So I double checked the recipe and tried a second batch (pressed down some) for 10 minutes- still doughy/raw in the middle. Third batch I didn't press down and baked for 10 min again. They didn't change shape in the oven very much- just big lightly browned dough balls. 
They hardly taste like maple and the dough is a bit too sugary. Some salt, maybe another egg, a lot more maple, less sugar might help (I will admit I didn't use maple sugar and that that would certainly add to the maple flavor.) 

Think I will use a tried and true snickerdoole and add maple (or in a basic shortbread). I probably won't try this recipe again but the idea has is great. Thank you Linda for the inspiration.

Delicious cookies with all the qualities of the perfect cookie--great flavor of cinnamon and maple syrup along with the perfect chewiness to them!  I mixed maple syrup with sugar to roll the cookies in and they were very good, but the sugar and syrup tended to clump together making it harder to roll the dough in it.  Next time, I'll use a cinnamon/sugar mixture, and I'm sure it'll be just as tasty.  Thanks, Linda.

These were delicious fresh out of the oven, but they didn't stay soft until the next day.

I substituted the maple sugar with 2 tablespoons of sugar mixed with 2 teaspoons of cinnamon like someone else suggested. Still tasted delicious.

great, simple recipe...ended up with super soft cookies!  i may lower the amount of sugar next time though...the cookies were a bit too sweet for my tastes.  also, next time, i'll add some nutmeg and ginger to try a spicy cookie variation!

Over all a very good cookie, moist and chewy but not that over the top maple flavour. However, I did not roll the cookies in the maple sugar and that may have made the difference, so next time I will definitely hunt down some maple sugar!!!

I have my own recipe for Snickerdoodles, but wanted to try this one because of the maple.  The flavor of the cookie was good, but I like my Snickerdoodles alittle chewy.  You do that by taking them out from the oven a tad early.  It didn't work with these.  If you like crunchy cookies/Snickerdoodles than use this recipe, if not, move on or try adding maple to your own recipe.  I am.

My family loved these cookies.  They're very easy to make also.  I'll make them again, but with a couple changes.  I would like to have had more maple flavor, so I'll change the proportions of the sugar/maple sugar mixture.  I also had quite a bit of the sugar mixture left over, so I think 1/4 cup of each is plenty.  I also think I'll cut back a little on the cinnamon to bring out more of the maple taste.  It's a great recipe as written.  The texture is perfect and the taste was a hit at my house.  I would just like to experiment with it next time so we can taste the maple flavor more.

Very good, but I think they might be improved with the addition of an 1/8 teaspoon of salt to balance out the sweetness.

This is a fabulous spin on Snickerdoodles; I'll never make regular ones again.  I always use butter instead of margarine and I put the dough in the frig for a while before rolling balls - I prefer my cookies chewie instead of crunchy.  After rolling them in the sugar and putting them on the cookie sheet, I flatten them slightly with the bottom of a glass.  I find the sugar mixture for rolling is way too much - I use a quarter (2 tblsp sugar, 1 tblsp maple sugar)and I still have a little leftover.  I put it in my maple flavored coffee.

Easy to mix, did find that the wire rack didnt work for me as they were so soft they fell through on the ends! ha!  Also was a bit concerned that it didnt call for cream of tartar.  As a kid making the Betty Crocker recipe, it was included.  Will do some research and quite possible adjust this recipe a bit.  Thanks for sharing!

These are heavenly...   Next time I think I'll use all maple sugar for rolling the balls in, I'd like more of a maple flavor...The only change I made was using all butter as I never have margarine in the house... this is probably why mine turned out more crispy than chewy... overall great flavor!

I made these for a work "food day" and they were a hit.  I did use real maple syrup but my closest grocer didn't stock maple sugar so I went with the sugar/cinnamon topping.  They were still worth five stars, so I can't imagine how great they would be with maple sugar!  The cookies were done after 8 minutes even though they looked a little doughy, so I suggest taking them out even if you feel unsure.

Just wonderful! I didn't have any maple sugar so i just used regular sugar for the outside and upped the cinnamon and maple syrup in the batter. I used lard instead of margarine because that's what i had handy and the cookies were a glorious success.

I made a few changes to the recipe. First I didn't have any baking soda so that wasn't added I also only used 1 tsp of cinnamon in the dough and used the other 1/2 tsp for the sugar mixture also did not have the maple sugar so I used a combination of sugar brown sugar and cinnamon to roll the dough in. It came out tasting like oatmeal to me but at the same time tasted really good!

Needs more of a distinguishable maple flavor, but I didn't have maple sugar (I used brown instead), so that's probably a big part of the problem.

most likely one of the BEST cookies i've ever made. they stay moist and chewy. make sure to cook them for the full 10 minutes to get the fluffiness. i found after 8 minutest, they rose and then went flat, but still tasted good!

I could not have been more disappointed. Maple Syrup and Maple Sugar are very expensive and my cookies had NO maple flavor at all! I had 8 friends and family do a what flavor is this taste test, not one of them guessed maple. The only reason I gave this recipe a 2 rating is because they were really easy to make and everyone liked the soft consistancy of the cookie . I'll try the recipe again but with some good maple extract.

I didn't use maple sugar, but the taste was very good. However, my didn't spread out and stayed in tiny balls, so they looked kind of weird.

Tasty!  I also ended up using sugar & cinnamon instead of maple sugar.  I was disappointed that I couldn't track down maple sugar in time for the holidays.  But, these still turned out wonderful.  Thank you for sharing!

Loved these!  I used butter instead of margarine b/c I don't buy margarine.  I did not have maple sugar so I just rolled them in white sugar.  You could taste both the maple and the cinnamon (I used Saigon cinnamon) but neither were overpowering.  I brought them to work and they were a hit!  I thought these were fantastic and I will make these again and again.

Don't know what happened, but my cookies came out kind of dry and crumbly. I also had to press them down before baking, otherwise they stayed in a ball, and did not really spread out and crack like they were supposed to. Did not remind me of the snickerdoodles I had as a kid. Won't make these again.

oooh, so yummy! Very much like your favorite snickerdoodle: buttery, tender, slightly chewy treat...with a hint of maple. Amazing! I found maple sugar for $14 at Whole Foods, but was MUCH more than I needed. Ended up finding/buying at a small farmers market. It adds a nice light crunch, a little texture, and nice extra hit of maple. If you really can't find maple sugar, at least sprinkle with Turbinado or Sugar in the Raw. Next time I might do more maple syrup in the batter; I love maple! Enjoy!!

This cookie rocks without maple sugar, so I am guessing when you have maple sugar it goes off the charts. I really want to try it with the maple sugar. This is a great holiday cookie.

I made these gluten-free, used egg substitute and used brown sugar because I didn't have maple sugar.  They were a little dry but tasted good.

These cookies are amazing!! My husband and I couldn't stop eating them. The only change I made was using all but about 1/4 c. of the flour mixture to keep these soft and moist and also took them out of the oven when the edges were just beginning to set but the middle still looked underdone. The cookies are still soft, moist and chewy today.

Good cookies!  I did not have the maple sugar to put on top, but I did a cinnamon sugar mix and it was good.  They were nice and soft, even the next day!

We love snickerdoodles, so this seemed like a recipe for us to try. However, this was just okay for us, and, frankly, I think the regular snickerdoodles are better. This one is very sweet, so you might want to cut down on the sugar some. I used real maple syrup, so maybe that had something to do with it, but I really don't think we'll make these again.

My kids loved these snickerdoodles.  Too bad I let the second batch burn by accident.  Ever since I made them the first time they've been asking for more.  I like that I can bake and leave all the additives and perservatives behind in the store-bought cookies.

These cookies were really good and super easy to make. I would add more maple syrup next time just to give them a bit more punch. I also used brown sugar/sugar/syrup to roll the cookies in. These cookies are best in small sizes...making large versions of these cookies would loose the effect. Overall great recipe and I can't wait to see if the guy I'm making for likes them!

Awesome!  My husband declared these "the best snickerdoodles ever."  I didn't have maple sugar, so just used turbinado.  I also used half whole wheat pastry flour and half white flour with great results.  Next time I might add a little maple extract just for an added maple "oomph".  But these are great as is. :)

AWESOME cookies! This is my husband's favorite cookie. I am not much of a baker but I made these and they turned out perfect.The only think I did different was use a sugar & cinnamon blend instead of maple sugar. Don't forget to have a yummy glass of cold milk.

I used artificial maple syrup as I really like the flavor. The flavors were still subtle and bit chewy and doughy. I don't like doughy cookies though. May think about making this one again.

I love these cookies! They are chewy and sweet, my boyfriend once said they are his favorites and he will never again eat storebought cookies. As I don't get Maple sugar in Germany, I mixed some fine brown sugar with a tsp of maple syrup and added sugar until it wasn't wet anymore.

These cookies are great!  I also made the frosting from the "Frosted Maple Cookies", and spread them over these for an extra sweet kick. :-)  Next time, I'd cut down on the sugar, because I prefer to frost my cookies.  Also, I used the suggestion of a few others who combined cinnamon and sugar as an alternative to the maple sugar.  Worked great for me!

Fabulous and then some!  I wanted a quick cookie to make since today is the first day of summer vacation and the kids are around.  These took absolutely no time to make and came out great.  I didn't have maple sugar so I just added maple syrup to sugar and a little cinnamon and stirred that up and rolled the cookie dough in it.  I baked them for a little longer, about 12 minutes and they are going to be gone in no time at all.  Thanks!

Thanks for the recipe.  I'm the cookie person in my neighborhood and these did not disappoint.  I used maple extract to flavor table sugar for the coating.

Realized I was short on the flour and used rolled oats for the last 1/2 cup.  This recipe blew me away.  Just amazing flavour.

First time ever making a snickerdoodle!  Turned out pretty good.  Decent consistency and chewiness.  The dough was really wet though so I had to refrigerate for about 15 min before I could even attempt to make a ball and roll in a cinn/sugar mix.

These cookies were pretty good just what I was in the mood for!  The only thing I would change is not use so 1/2 cup sugar to roll the balls in, I ended up throwing about 1/3 of it away after I was done rolling all the balls.  I think they are delicious.

This recipe was the ultimate recipe of anybody who is a fan of maple syrup.  The texture of the cookie was wonderful, it was soft and chewy and kept that way for a few days or as long as they lasted. The only thing different that I did is that I added toasted coconut and a tablespoon of corn syrup in wich I add to all my recipes.  This is a keeper.

A great snickerdoodle recipe being that I didn't have any cream of tartar.  My husbands new fav cookie.  You will not taste maple in this cookie, just the right amount of sweet.  Also used cin/sugar to roll in b4 baking. yummo

These cookies are soooo good. My kids ask me to make them all of the time.  I've found that if you take them out of the oven when they still look a little wet, then let them set up a couple minutes the texure is much better.

They were all right... not the best I've had, but also not the worst. I don't usually have REAL maple syrup on hand, so I used pancake syrup and rolled the dough in regular sugar. Thanks for the recipe, but probably will not make again.

Fabulous cookie! I rolled them in raw sugar crystals instead of regular granulated sugar - yum. I had packed half away to give to a friend, but my kids sniffed them out and finished the lot before I could give them away. Next time I will double the recipe!

They were amazing.  All my friends loved them.  I by accident added all the sugar in stead of rolling the balls in the sugar and they turned out yummier than just rolling them in the sugar.

These cookies are pretty good if you arn't in a nut or chocolate mood. I accidently added 1 1/2 tps of nutmeg as well thinking it was the cinnimon and then before mixing the dry ingredients w/ the butter and sugar reilized my mistake. Still they came out lovely. If you want a nice and spicy cake i sugest putting in some nutmeg and mayde just a pinch of salt

Mmmmmmmm...eating one warm out of the oven right now and they are great.  I only put 1 tsp of cin. and put a few more glugs of maple syrup in.  You can adjust the flour if they are too wet, but I didn't need to.  The 1 & 1/2 cups of sugar to roll them in is excessive, halving  that would be sufficient if you aren't going to use it elsewhere.

My roommates adored these! I didn't have maple syrup on hand, so I used regular low-cal syrup, and although you could taste the hint of it, there were no complaints. I also added a litle molasses just for a kick, and rolled the cookies in brown sugar.

Don't listen to anyone about changing the recipie.  It is perfect! They've never failed me!  Make sure you take out when recipie says- they will be perfect! My son loves them and he hates every other cookie we have ever tried! I make them and set them out when friends come.  Even if someone is in a hurry and just grabs one on the way out, they never fail to stop and come back to compliment me on them.  I have rolled in both a cinnamon sugar mixture, and in white sugar with a few drops of maple syrup.  Thank you Thank you for this recipie!!

excellent-I too did not have maple syrup in the house, so I subbed the corn syrup and added maple extract.  Also added the extract to the sugar used for rolling the cookies in.

Went over very well in philosophy class as a presentation motivator. The entire bag was completely eaten up. Since I did not have real maple syrup or maple sugar around, I used pancake syrup and brown sugar and it still tasted good.

These were fantastic! I will probably make them again in the fall. I ended up with 32 perfect cookies.  They were nice and "plump" and had a great texture. My husband loved them! They are a bit spicey from all of the cinnamon but it adds to their overall appeal. I wasn't sure what maple sugar was, so I used light brown sugar instead - mixed with the white (to roll the dough balls in)and they were fine.

I was hungry for snickerdoodles one day, and decided to give this recipe a try due to the reviews it received.  I didn't have maple sugar, so I used the cinnamon/sugar suggestion of a previous reviewer.  My kids helped by rolling the dough in the cinnamon/sugar mixture before dropping them on the cookie sheet, and they had a blast!  My family loved these so much, I decided to make them as holiday gifts for friends.  They were a hit, and I will use this recipe year round--thanks!!

i've tried other snickerdoodle recipes from this site..i think one was called 'snickerdoodles VI'...or something like that...it came out all crumbly and had no taste at all....although THIS is the recipe i've been searching for....i didn't have any maple syrup so i substituted the same amount of corn syrup instead, and i didn't have maple sugar either, so i used regular sugar...it came out really good...although i think i cooked it longer...and it was still soft the next day! thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

These cookies were good, but not what I had in mind.  DOn't get me wrong, they were good cookies, but they did not seem a hit with other people.  I might make these again.

Snickerdoodles are one of our favorite cookies.  The maple flavor is a nice twist on a great cookie.  Enjoy!

I made the recipe for Ultimate Maple
Snickerdoodles and they were delicious!
They had a wonderful combination of
flavors of Butter, Maple, and Cinnamon.
I would highly recommend this recipe.

really easy,  I didn't use maple sugar since I really don't like maple but I did use the syrup in the dough.  This is also a good size recipe, just big enough for an afternoon treat without tons of leftovers.

I made them 2x , taking them out when they are still soft on top is important. 1st batch too hard. 2nd batch just right!

Absolutely love it! If you're feeling exceptionally Canadian, try substituting the marg with equal parts bacon grease. Highly recommend trying half substitute to start, just to get a taste for it on the first batch, and go with your preference from there. Could add bacon bits for extra flavor and crunch as well.. sounds like a weird twist, even I was questioning my sanity, but it's actually pretty decent, bacon adds a little salty taste to even out the maple.

Only negative thing was that the maple sugar mixture had way too much, tons left over.

Like someone else, I used a couple drops of maple flavoring in regular sugar as it is hard to find maple sugar in the store. Great recipe.  We like snickerdoodles anyway, but the maple is extra good.

Loved these! They came out perfectly. The texture is nice and gooey without tasting undone. Made them for my boyfriend as maple is one of his favorite flavors, and he ate 6 in a minute hahaha.

I hesitated in writing this review because in the end I didn't follow the instructions (but not on purpose). I mistakenly put 1/2 of the sugar in the bowl that was to be reserved for the dusting. I added a 1/2 an extra egg and a touch more maple syrup to wet the dough and cooked them up. The result was a great tasting cookie, but it didn't spread as much as I would have liked. 

So, for the next batch I put in the other 1/2 of the egg and about a tbsp more maple syrup. They spread beautifully and had an even better taste. 

I only write this in case someone makes the same mistake. Don't fret. This seems to be a no-fail recipe.

The cookies are delicious.  I didn't have maple sugar so I rolled them in raw sugar.  They didn't become flat cookies, though.  they stayed very rounded, but tasted great.

Love these cookies. Didn't have maple sugar. So I used sugar and brown sugar. Will definitely try cinnamon next time.

Live in a small town and the best I could do for pure maple syrup was Log Cabin Natural.  They were very good but I would go for an even stronger flavor.  Intend to get some pure Grade B syrup off of Amazon next time.   Very good though, turned out perfect looking cookies .  I used 1/4 c. white sugar and 1 t. cinnamon to roll them in.

This may be to some people’s taste, but I found these to be relatively flavorless.I did make it following the recipe exactly, even going so far as to order online the very expensive maple sugar.  I’m guessing that adding some cinnamon to the maple sugar and white sugar mixture used for rolling the dough balls would add what I’m missing.  I may try them again, but doubtful, since I’m a huge fan of traditional snickerdoodles. What a disappointment.

This got incredibly difficult for me. I ended up with the stickiest batter EVER. It was so sticky that so much batter was wasted from being stuck to my hands and a spoon and anything else I was using. I had added an extra tablespoon of syrup, so maybe that was it, but even before then it seemed an abnormal texture. I gave this a 2 because the taste came out fine, even though the texture was more of a muffin top. I will try again, following the recipe exactly, to see if this can go any better.

The cookies are good, but not quite the snickerdoodles  I expected.  The recipe.does not have cream of tartar, maybe that is what is missing.

Pretty good snickerdoodles. I just used butter instead of margarine & didn't have maple sugar so used sugar+cinnamon instead. I baked mine for 11 mins. Texture was crisp on the outside & very soft on the inside. Beautiful cookies but lacked a lil something for me. I think I'll add in vanilla extract next time or even maple.

It came out lovely, but the cookie didn't flatten in the oven, so I would suggest flattening them yourself. Also, I replaced the maple sugar with brown sugar, and the cookies tasted fine. Thank you so much for this recipe!

My boyfriend and I are OBSESSED with these cookies. We could not stop eating them...despite the fact that the recipe uses too much flour, so our first sheet came out like rocks. We only baked one sheet at a time, so we were able to add some sugar to rescue the rest of the dough (they still came out slightly hard, but better than the first batch). Next time we'll be using less flour.

I used 2 tbsp of cinnamon and 1/4 less of flour, and butter instead of margarine, and brown sugar instead of maple sugar. I also changed the 1 cup white sugar to 3/4 cup white and 1/4 cup brown as another suggested. I cooked these for 10 mins exactly and left them rounded in the ball shape. Doing this and using butter causes them to not spread very much, so you're left with a crispy on the outside, but soft on the inside absolutely delicious maple snickerdoodle! :D will be making again!

Wow, just, wow. I didn't expect them to be so delicious, soft and easy to make. My brother gobbled half in one sitting and I could hardly resist munching on them during the day. I lowered the amount of sugar as I do with every dessert recipe and I still found it a bit too sweet, but that's just my personal preference.

Fantastic. I used butter instead of margarine. I found out after I'd made these that my husband had never had a homemade snickerdoodle. He's hooked. This was the best recipe for his first time. Outstanding.

Yummy!  Easy, soft, and tasty.  Used butter instead of margarine.  Didn't have maple sugar (and misread the recipe) so I mixed maple syrup with sugar for the coating, which made a neat sort of glaze after baking.  A bit extra sweet so next time I'll try reducing sugar in the batter a little.

These cookies are yummy!  I didn't have any margarine so used butter flavored shortning instead.  Cookies didn't spread at all...  I don't know how much difference it would have made if I used margarine... The maple flavor is very nice.  I cooked maple syrup and cooled.  Then grind it in a coffee grinder to make maple sugar since I didn't have store bought maple sugar.  I made a half batch as cut out cookies and filled with some maple butter cream filling.

Very basic and tasty. The maple was fine but I love maple and may add a bit more next time.

Just finished making a batch...made them exactly as posted and they are delicious!  The only thing I would change next time is the amount of sugar called for to roll your cookies in....I was left with half the amount of sugar (so I'm making another batch). The maple sugar was too expensive to waste! Also, I got almost an extra dozen from my batch so I guess they were a little smaller than they should have been. I think 1/4 cup each of white and maple sugars would have been enough for the recipee!

I only like snickerdoodles in the fall, so this being October I prolly rated these on the high side. That being said, the maple syrup brand I used was Roger's Golden Syrup. It's got more of a "molasses-y" flavor. As with all cookies I bake, I spread the batter in a 9 x 13 pan and bake, then cut into bars. Vastly easier for this busy mom than rolling into balls and baking pan by pan all afternoon.

I was a little nervous these might be too sweet. Living in Vermont, we know a thing or two about the taste of maple syrup.  However, it is very subtle but tasty, similarly to the taste of chocolate chip cookies without the chocolate. If you are looking for a strong maple flavor, be sure to add more syrup than the recipe specifies.

My family loves this cookie. So good and sugary. I used butter instead of margarine and cinnamon sugar for rolling in instead of maple sugar. Absolutely fantastic. So chewy and good.

A GREAT COOKIE! My husband asked for a "coffee type cookie" with maple, and immediately, I tried this recipe. The per portions were great, just enough cookies, and the taste was nicely sweet, not too bad. As always, the second time through I cut the sugar to 3/4c, and it worked fantastically! You don't even need the maple sugar to make this cookie. Thank you so much for the recipe!

I can't completely rate this recipe as I didn't have real maple syrup or the maple sugar. I did like everyone else and used sugar and cinnamon to roll my dough in. The dough was real sticky and it had to be put in the fridge for about 20 mins. and then even after that I never could get my into balls. I just dropped it into the sugar mixture and then made my balls. I would recommend cooking for at least 1 to 2 mins longer as my were still alittle doughy. We ate them anyways but would prefer them to be more done. I never could taste any maple in it, but as I said I didn't have the 2 main ingredients and just used pancake syrup. But still it was a good recipe.

I like this recipe, but I did not follow it 100%. I used brown sugar instead of white and couldn't find maple sugar to roll them in so I used white. These were very good, but a bit too sweet... rolling them in sugar was over-kill for me. But my friends 6yr old loooved them ! I give this recipe a 3.. the kid gave them a 5 !

These look and taste great! I've made them twice already, albeit with pancake syrup, and they were wonderful. I'll have to buy maple syrup one day to find out how much more wonderful they can be.

This has become my new go-to recipe. Love it! I didn't have maple sugar so I combine cinnamon, white sugar and some of the maple syrup until I can roll in it. Makes it slightly crunchy with a soft inside--YUM! Thanks for the recipe! Its a hit!

These are pretty good, and easy to make. Nice change from the choc chip cookies I usually bake. The taste is good and similar to the sugar cookies from Quiznos (love those), but the texture is a little hard and dry. My boyfriend tasted them and said "They're good, but something is missing." I agree with him. Maybe I'll try to figure out what that "something" could be.

Easy and tasty recipe!  I also used cinnamon sugar instead of maple sugar.  My family loved these cookies, so I'll be making them again.  I probably will add a bit more maple syrup next time, and maybe some vanilla too.  They were nice and chewy and didn't last long at all!

Like other reviewers I didn't have maple sugar, but made my own by mixing a few drops of maple extract with granulated sugar.  These were great and everyone loved them - very soft & chewy, even after a few days.

i don't even *like* snickerdoodles, and these won me over! the cinnamon-maple combo makes them just the right amount of sweet, and the portions make them just the right size (as opposed to some overwhelmingly large 'doodles i've seen). i added half again the amount of cinnamon on a second batch, and it was scrumptious. and brown sugar seemed to work just fine in place of maple sugar. thanks again for such a great recipe!

The people who liked these.. really liked these. The people who didn't like them .. really didn't like them. And we're big maple fans and I used real maple syurp. I did notice the maple flavor and even sprinkled alittle more of the maple sugar on the cookies when they came right out of the oven but not everyone was a fan. But it was a easy recipe to try and I'll probably make it again since my hubby was one of the ones who REALLY liked them. :)

These were a yummy alternative to common snickerdoodles.  I used butter instead of margarine and rolled the cookies in a mix of 1/4 cup white sugar, a couple of drops of maple syrup and dash of cinnamon.  
I do agree with other reviews, these cookies are quite sweet, so next time I may leave out a bit of the sugar when creaming the sugar and butter.

Luv these!  To make them even more special:  Make a bowl of maple icing (I make a regular buttercream but add a bit of maple extract and a few tbls of pure maple syrup) then make maple cookie sandwiches by smothering one cookie with icing and toping with another. 
A decadent fall treat!

This is a great cookie!  I used 5 Tbsp of maple syrup and rolled them in 2 Tbsp of sugar mixed with 1 tsp cinnamon.  Of course they were amazing right out of the oven, but they also stayed nice and soft since I stored them in a tupperware container.  They bake beautifully and looked like they were store bought.  I don't normally like snickerdoodles and was making these for my family, but this is a sure winner!

I was pleasantly surprised by these cookies. I didn't have real maple syrup so I just used regular pancake syrup. I also used half brown sugar half white sugar in the dough, but next time I think I will just use white sugar. I can't wait to try them with real syrup. The husband loved them!

Overall not a bad cookie (the kids gobbled them right up) but I was disappointed with the lack of maple flavor.  I decreased the cinnamon and added a bit of maple extract (about a teaspoon) but they still weren't all that "mapley". Good cookies though! Thanks Linda.

Great Cookie!! I didn't have maple syrup on hand, so used pancake syrup- worked out fine, although I'll try the real thing next time.

I made these dookies and they were gone in just a few days!   I like them dipped in equal parts cinnnamon and sugar instead of rolled.  Use colored sugar for a holiday effect!

These cookies are delicious!  I like them much better than the regular snickerdoodles.  I did not know where to get maple sugar, so I added 1/4 tsp. maple flavoring to 3/4 cup sugar and mixed thoroughly.  Worked great, but did not need that much sugar; 1/2 cup would have been fine I think.  Thank you Linda for the recipe.

DELICIOUS!   I didn't have maple sugar so I used a combo of white sugar and brown sugar. I brought these to work and everyone LOVED them.  I will definitely make again.

This was a great find late one night. I liked the sweetness of the maple as a nice change of pace.

These were easy to make and turned out perfectly, but they were not totally to my taste.  I thought the maple flavour was almost non-existent and definitely overpowered by the cinnamon.  I am probably just not used to this type of cookie however.  Next time I make them I think I will leave out the cinnamon completely.  I think the basic dough would be good with vanilla extract added and toffee chips, and then rolled in vanilla sugar.

YUUUUMMMYY!  I was lucky enough to have the maple sugar and the "real" maple syrup due to my husbands recent trip to Vermont.  These are delicious and so moist! Only change I would make is the same as pp, change the white sugar/maple sugar ratio and also not use as much, like pp 1/3 cup of each should be enough.  I ended up throwing a bunch out afterwards. Kids and Husband loved these as well.

Delicious!  A new take on an old favourite.  Only change I made was mixing the rolling sugar 1:1 with the maple sugar (i.e. 1/4 cup of each)

Good but as a maple fanatic I thought it needed alot more maple flavor! And that's even with using the real maple syrup and maple sugar.

Snickerdoodles are my husband's favorite cookie, and maple is another of his favorite flavors.  I made these cookies and the whole batch was gone in less than 24 hours!  Absolutely delicious.  I also did not have maple sugar, and just used cinnamon and granulated sugar.  They were marvelous.
