We loved this shrimp! Five stars for great flavor, five stars for super easy to make. I followed the advice from the review by Saveur, and marinated my shrimp in the mayo mix ahead, for about two hours. I did add in some good shakes of Old Bay Seasoning to the mayo mix, fresh minced garlic instead of garlic salt, and added in some shakes of Parsley also. We grilled over a wood fire just until pinked up, took about two to three minutes each side, so watch your grilling time  depending on shrimp size and fire temperature.

Wow-wee!  Loved this shrimp.  I just mixed the mayo (low fat) and lemon juice, galic powder, and lemon pepper togther, and marinated the shrimp for a couple of hours before skewering.  Moist and delicious, one of my fave ways to prepare shrimp on the grill.  Served with "Island Fried Rice" for a taste of the islands on a blustery fall day in Ohio.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR.

These were tasty treats - they could use more garlic for my taste - maybe mixed in with the mayonnaise.  They do not take  5 - 10 minutes a side - more like 5 - 10 minutes total.  If you are using wooden skewers - don't forget to soak them in water before threading the shrimp.  Thanks for sharing your fun and easy recipe.

We loved this recipe.  Made a few changes, by adding Cajun seasoning to the mayo.  We cooked under the broiler, 2 minutes on one side then 3 on the other.

after reading other reviews, I ended up over seasoning ..  still excellent, but next time I won't be quite so heavy handed..  I added some Old Bay Seafood Seasoning and it definitely added flavor.. Served with Pineapple Fried Rice and there was nothing left..  The original recipe as written would be very good, but cooking for my family requires a little extra seasoning..

Added some minced garlic, 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/4 teaspoon onion powder, 1/2 teaspoon parsley and 1/3 teaspoon cilantro. My picky hubby said it could be a recipe in a restaurant.

I must say this is one of the best shrimp recipes that I have ever found.  I will make all my shrimp like this from now on.  I used a little Cajun seasoning (family preference), and threw them on the grill.  I served them with angel hair pasta.  It was delicious and devoured by all.  Thank you for your submission.

These turned out really good. I was skeptical of the mayo but they turned out quite yummy. I did add some lemon juice to the mayo and I will add more next time.

This was so delicious.  I broiled it (3 min each side).  I mixed mayo, lemon juice, fresh garlic, and the cayenne together and let the seasoned shrimp (garlic pepper) hang out in it for about 20 minutes.  It was like the most delicious shrimp scampi I ever had.

FABulous! I did add a little Old Bay and fresh garlic to the mayo, and grilled on a stovetop grill pan. Added a bit of freshly chopped parsley at the end. Could have used a bit less mayo...
Everyone asked for the recipe!

This shrimp is delicious. Have made it 2x.  I marinated shrimp in mayo, cajun seasoning, lemon juice, black pepper and a pinch of cayenne for about 30 minutes before grilling.  They were moist and flavorful.  My new favorite way to grill shrimps - quick and simple. Thanks Roxiemaui.

Made for the first time tonight.   Loved it. Followed recipe exactly except for the cayenne pepper. didn't have any so I use McCcormick southwest seasoning.  I mixed everything into the mayo all at once and marinated the shrimp 1 1/2 hrs. brought to room temp. then placed on gas grill set on med. cooked ABOUT 3  1/2 min. per side.  I fix shrimp at least once a week so will be making this quite often.

This was a simple yet very tasty recipe. I was a bit skeptic on flavor at first but it did not disappoint. I will make this again, probably tomorrow!

Followed this recipe exactly and it was fantastic! I'm sure you can add seasonings like Old Bay if you don't want to, no worries, its super tasty just as written. I did marinate the shrimp for about an hour beforehand however. I couldn't believe how mayo can bring flavour to shrimp like this. Everyone at the table raved. Will definitely make this one again and again. Thank you for a great fast recipe that makes me look so good.

I followed the recipe including the cayenne.  Very easy and my husband said he thought it was about the best shrimp he'd ever had.  We've had some very good shrimp through our years together so - wow.  Plus it kept all the heat of cooking outside!

I did use about a tablespoon of Old Bay in the Mayo mixture.  Marinated the mixture  by itself.  Also, I Broiled the shrimp with the mayo and Old Bay mixture  spread over the shrimp.  It was fabulous!  My hubby didn’t want to get the grill going, had a long day, so the broiling was great!

This shrimp was amazing! The family devoured it. The only thing I did different was add Old Bay Seasoning to the mayo mixture. I threw all the shrimp and marinade in a gallon size ziplock and let it marinade for 30 minutes before I skewered and grilled it. Great recipe if your prone to overcook shrimp. The mayo keeps it moist.

Probably some of the best tasting shrimp I ever ate.  Only thing I did differently was sprinkle some Old Bay over it before grilling.  It was a very easy recipe to make and had a lot of flavor.  I will definitely keep this in my favorites.

Delicious.  I may have put a bit more garlic salt, I didn't measure, but it was perfect for my taste.  I also used Siracha instead of cayenne (didn't have any) which I mixed into Light Mayo.  I also cooked on an indoor grill, no skewers.  Came out amazing.  Easy and delicious.

This was so simple and delicious. I added cajun seasoning and sprinkled over shrimp and it added a lot of flavor. This was a big hit at at a little family cookout.  Cooks fast, is easy to make and skewer can be placed on grill after everything else is cooked and ready.

Wow this was great!!  My husband loved it too.  Normally he likes his shrimp pretty plain, but this was gone quickly!    I left off the hot pepper, personal presence, but the flavor  and presentation were good.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious. Didn’t have exact seasonings at rental condo we’re staying at.  I substituted cajun seasonings & garlic powder.  I also added a couple TBSP of OJ to the Mayo for citrus.  I’ll do exact recipe at home but this shrimp was outstanding!

Kids wouldn't eat this stuff....my husband and I weren't too impressed either...this recipe was included as a quick meal to prepare on a school night....waste of food and time.   We had hot dogs instead.  Some of those other recipes that were included I know my kids won't eat either...don't send any more suggestions if kids can't eat it.

Used a large clove of fresh minced garlic and juice of a freshly squeezed lemon in  this recipe. Made ahead, let it sit and then coated the large shrimp ( prawns) and BBQ ... Wowie!!!

This was absolutely perfect & easy.  We've never made such moist grilled shrimp!  I mixed it and left in the fridge for a little while before grilling.  Dashed in a tad of cajun seasoning I had, and fresh garlic instead of garlic salt.  Very happy!  I would have never thought to use mayo!

I loved this recipe! However I made some changes as we like a lot of spice. Instead of garlic salt  I added a teaspoon of garlic. I also added a teaspoon of old bay, chipotle pepper instead of cayenne and hot pepper flakes. Over medium heat it only takes 3-5 minutes per side. I also added a few scallops!

I would have given this a five star but I had to change a few things as I didn't have all the ingredients on hand. I used fresh garlic and Cajun spice. Turned out great.

I was really skeptical of this recipe at first but I have other things cooked with mayo and they have been good so I tried.  So glad that I did.  I only used 12 oz of shrimp since that is how I had the package in the freezer and my husband and I polished them off.  I used garlic powder instead of salt and added a touch of Old Bay.  Perfection!!!

I was attracted to this recipe because of the fun name.  We liked this recipe a lot.  I followed the suggestions of fellow reviewers with the following changes:  fresh minced garlic instead of garlic salt (mayonnaise is already salty) and the addition of Old Bay seasoning to taste.  Also, I marinated the shrimp for a few hours before putting them on skewers to to grill.  The basic recipe idea was good but needed a little tweaking.

This is a very easy and tasty recipe, but we would prefer just a little more pizzazz.
