This was tasty.  I did have to cream it quite a bit to get rid of the granular feel from the powder mix.  I omitted both the nuts and the olives since my husband doesn't like them.  I used the leftover mixture to make quesadillas later, and it was great there as well.

This is a delicious snack and perfect for game day!  Instead of pecans I used a nut/dried cherry trail mix and it looked very "pretty" as well!

This recipe tastes great but is too stiff for softer crackers. I added some sour cream to make it a little softer. I also added some jalepeno peppers.

Made this without the olives, and rolled it it in crushed sliced almonds because it was what I had on hand. I made one small cheese ball, one big one. We used the small one on our bagels in the morning. It was fabulous. Served the big one as an appetizer on Christmas Day, and everyone loved it. Kids told me to make sure I save this recipe.

5 Stars for this recipe! I had a Halloween party to attend last night. I tried another recipe from on here and it turned out awful. I am so glad I came across this recipe..it was a huge hit!! Everyone loved it and loved how I shaped it into a pumpkin. This recipe is a keeper. I plan to make this for most get togethers. Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe! PS I also didn't use the pecans.

This is delicious! I didn't have any green onions or olives so I left them out. I make my own ranch dressing mix that has chives & minced onion. This has fantastic flavor, thanks!

I thin it out with sour cream and use it to make party sandwiches, of ocurse skipping the nuts. Thin  even more with some milk and it's a food dip for veggies or plain chips.

I think I'm just more of a "dip" person, as I don't care all so much for the nuts on the outside, and I'd prefer a softer texture. Maybe adding 1/2 cup actual ranch dressing, rather than a dry pkt? Plenty of flavor, but I added 1/2 a pound of bacon, not just 6 strips. It's all about personal preferences, so don't be skeptical about giving this a try. Thanks for the recipe.  : )

This has a good flavor, but it salty, and that is w/o the black olives (didn't have those).  I can't imgine how salty this would be with the addition of the olives.  I wonder if using 1/2 pkg. of the ranch would work

Love this cheese ball! Next time though, I think I'll add another slice or two of bacon and a touch more shredded cheese. I did leave out the olives, since we're not big fans. It was a HUGE hit with my family. So, so good

I made this for our Christmas Eve Party  and it was a hit! Followed recipe exactly as listed, except I forgot to add the package of buttermilk ranch dressing, but it was still delicious.  When I make it again I'd probably add only 1/2 a package as  others have suggested. Super Yum.

you really can't go wrong w/this recipe.  I halved it because I am taking it to a smaller function.  I even used the pre-cooked bacon for convenience and used 4 slices, since they are usually smaller.  green olives w/pimento subbed just for added color.  sort of tastes like a loaded baked potato.  did add a bit more cheese because, well...u can never have too much cheese.  toasted the nuts for an added level of flavor.  thanks for this surefire easy, peasy recipe that tastes so good.

I had never made a cheeseball before this and it is one of my favorites!  I make it for every holiday!  I omit the olives and usually the green onions and instead of rolling it in pecans, I roll it in crispy bacon!  Delish!

This is very tasty. I would make two smaller balls because the one was way too big. I didn't add olives but it was still good.

This was a big hit at the Holiday party! I just tweeked it a bit. I combined the dry ranch mix with about 3 TBS of sour cream before adding to cream cheese to better blend it in. I also used sliced almonds instead of the pecans, just a preference. Delicious!!

I've never considered myself to be much of a cheese ball fan but after trying this one that my friend made at a recent Christmas party, I'm a convert!  Delicious flavor all around.  Everyone else loved it as well so I will certainly be making this on my own for future parties.

Always a great hit for every crowd I have made it for.  One time I did not put in the bacon and used chopped hard salami.  Still, a big hit!

Good recipe!  Of course, I cheated a little and used packaged bacon pieces.  I made 1 cheese ball just like the recipe.  The other half, I added some sour cream to make it creamier and stuffed cherry tomatoes.  Both were a big hit!

I've made this delicious ball of cream cheese about 8 times, and its disappeared every single time! I love pairing it with buttery crackers or garlicy triscuts. Fantastic recipe!

If there were more stars I would totally give them.  This was the biggest hit ever, everyone wanted the recipe.  We have a nut allergy in our family so I rolled the ball in bacon.  YUMMIEST cheeseball ever.

So great! Let it refrigerate before you have it, because it needs the time to marinate in the flavors. I don't add the nuts because hubby is allergic but we don't miss it!

Love this recipe! I omit the olives, use real bacon bits rather than cooking bacon, and roll it in bacon bits and more shredded cheese rather than the pecans and it is delicious! Thank you!

Perfect...I made this with almonds for Christmas Dinner and it was a hit!  I expected to have some left over for the next day but that didn't happen.  Even with trying to pace the people that were eating this cheese ball, it was gone within a couple of hours.  I just made this again tonight, except without the olives.  We'll see what happens.

I followed the recipe almost exactly. One reviewer suggested adding sour cream and I did. I saved some time by using real bacon bits (One slice of bacon = 2-3 t. Real bacon bits). I was making this for an October gathering and loved the photo since it looked like a pumpkin so I wanted to do this, too. It wasn’t a very orange looking so I rolled it in more cheddar cheese after refrigerating and skipped the pecans. The stem in the photo looked like a zucchini  but the ones in the store were too large so I used a stem from an artichoke. I got several compliments and two requests for the recipe! BONUS: There was some left so I’m having grilled cheese for dinner tonight!

This is a GREAT cheese ball! So easy to make and so delicious. I am never able to find a 1 ounce packet of buttermilk ranch dressing so I just use regular ranch and it tastes great! I roll it in walnuts but that's just my personal preference :) Also cheese balls need to be refrigerated for at least 24-48 hours and should be served at ROOM TEMPERATURE not chilled. I read a few reviews that it was 'too stiff' but it's not when it is served correctly!

I didn’t have the powder, so I subbed ranch dressing and it  worked fine. I also regularly use Neufchâtel cheese in lieu of regular cream cheese.  What I like about the recipe is that it can be easily modified to reflect your preference(s). Rather than rolling it into a ball, I served it in a holiday bowl with bacon crumbs as a garnish on top.

I made this for Friendsgiving this year and it was devoured in no time. I did not use the pecans or olives. I put all 6 slices of bacon in the cheese ball and then I fried up 3-4 more slices for the outside.

Everyone enjoyed it! (I omitted the pecans.) I mixed the ingredients in a bowl, then dumped it onto plastic wrap to mold it into the shape of a pumpkin and used a piece of bacon for the stem. It was cute and yummy!

This was VERY good.  My 11 year old daughter, Hannah, made this for a football party.  Everyone LOVED it!  We didn't use onions or pecans and used pre-packaged bacon bits.  It was very good with Wheat Thins.

I love the sharp cheese in this recipe, but I like using the bacon bits from Costco.  It is a much better choice for me than cooking strips of bacon.  Also, we don't like olives so they would never get near my cheese balls ;)

I made this for Super Bowl Sunday, so it was easy to just shape it as a football- I think it turned out cute. I didn't add green onions because i didn't have any and I still think it was very tasty. Great on crackers or celery. I think I will buy some bagels to try it on next as suggested.

I was looking for a simple cheese ball to take to a Fall work function. This was delicious! Instead of rolling it in pecans, I pressed shredded cheddar on the outside after I shaped it like a pumpkin. I recommend not serving it straight from the refrigerator so it's easier to spread but it's so good! Even my 13 year old daughter liked it.

This was my first cheese ball. No need to look further for another recipe. used green olives and halved the ranch. Easy to make and the outcome is fabulous

I used Uncle Dan's ranch dressing packet and I found it very salty, with the bacon and all. I also used Hormel bacon bits to make it easier. I hope my guests like it because it's a big cheese ball!
