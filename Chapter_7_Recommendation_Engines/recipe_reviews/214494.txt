Oh my! This is so good! The first time be prepared to get a little frustrated with the prep. Every time it gets easier. I add. a little more chili and a dab of the BBQ sauce inside. Take your time, slow cook on the outside/cooler portion of the grill. We turn them one time, mop with sauce, then once more before pulling to serve. Amazing how one of these will fill almost anyone! Again, Oh So Good!!! Serve with the grilled Mexican corn and the meal is complete!

Decided to try this to wow my menfolk but it didn't go over so well. I think the chicken has to be thinnner than called for, it didn't cook on the inside until the soaked skewers were turned to ash. The texture in the middle was "weird" where the chili met the chicken meat. They did love the bacon-y, chicken, bbq sauce flavor combo. I think next time I'm going to just make the chicken and bacon part, and serve the chili and cheese on the side.
