Smells heavenly when it's baking!  I replaced the oil with applesauce (made no difference in taste and of course, it's healthier) and only used choc. chips in the one loaf.  Also, my oven time was 60 min. and they came out perfect.  It was the first time I'd used zucchini so I enjoyed the new experience......our garden is (as most gardeners who grow the veggie) being overrun by the things!  Happy baking!!

This was the 1st recipe I ever used to make zucchini bread.  It's the last one I'll make.  Absolutely divine!  P.S.  I made it without chocolate chips.

Fabulous cake-like texture but I find draining/drying the grated zucchini first is essential to keep the bread light. The recipe is not specific about how to 'prepare pans'. Buttering and flouring seems to work best for me. Just buttering or oiling doesn't allow the cake to fall out of the pan. I love this one with added vanilla and lemon zest - not crazy about the chocolate chips.

My family loved this recipe, so much that I've already made it twice in a week. It is really easy and yummy. Based on some of the other reviews I cup the sugar down by 1/2 a cup. I still felt it was too sweet (and I generally like sweet things!) So, I agree with a some of the other reviewers to cut the sweetener down. This next batch I cut it to 1 cup sugar & 1/4 cup maple syrup... it's much better. Also, I found that the bake time was a lot shorter than the recipe called for... my stove has a thermometer in it so I can't explain why I only needed to bake it for about 40-45 minutes? I'll keep this one as a favorite!

Great recipe!  I followed some ideas on other reviews--I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 2 cups white, and only 1 1/2 cups sugar, and only added chocolate chips to one loaf.  I liked the chocolate one better, but I do have an addiction, so it may not work for everyone!

This bread is delicious! I made it for holiday gift-giving and everyone loved it. The chocolate chips in this bread are a nice touch, and I think the sour cream adds a tasty sort of moistness to the bread.

This was awesome!  I am an "easy" cook - as long as it's easy I'll make it.  I made this and everyone that tried it couldn't say anything but how great it was.  Definitely a keeper!!

The chocolate chips didn't mesh well with the rest of the flavor of the bread.

I like this recipe because the bread turned out very moist, not too greasy like some recipes, and almost cake-like. I think next time I'll cut back on the chocolate chips or use raisins though because the chocolate kind of overwhelmed the zucchini flavor. But I think the sour cream really made this bread a winner!

This bread tasted great both me and my husband loved it!  The only changes I made are less sugar 1.5 cups instead of 2 and I also added some ground flax seeds.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and for me it took 70 min to bake.  The reason I gave it 4 stars is that it came out moist but very crumbly, I couldn't get the slices out of the pan without it falling apart.  Maybe I didn't give it enough time to cool down, I am hoping it will be less crumbly once it cools down completely.  I will freeze the second loaf for later.

Being my first zucchini bread try, I skipped the chocolate chips.  Next time I will do one loaf with and one without.  I also took the lead of a few others and did 1/2 cup apple sauce and 1/2 oil.  I think I also did the sugar 1/2 white and 1/2 brown since I really like brown sugar.  It turned out fantastic!  I was able to give away a few pieces away before I ate it all but if I had had more zucchini on hand I would have made a second batch.  The sour cream really moistens and adds just the right flavor.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

Exceptional flavor--a keeper.  I would recommend several things:  be sure to grease and flour the pans well otherwise the loaf will crack in half coming out of the pan as mine did!  Secondly, the chocolate chips sink to the bottom of the loaf.  To prevent this, I tossed them in flour before lightly folding into the bread dough, and that helped.

I love this recipe.  I followed some of the reviews and cut the sugar down to 1 1/2cups and omitted the chocolate chips.  I think squeezing out the zucchinis helped make this bread very light. I also baked them in mini muffin cups as I don't have a bread pan and baked it for 20 minutes.  It turned out perfect and delicious.

After reading other reviews I adjusted to: 1/2 cup oil, 1 cup sugar, 1 cup sour cream.  I also didn't add the chocolate chips because I didn't have any.  I would make this again for sure!

This bread is awesome! I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and I'm sorry I did. I should have made it just as it stated with 2 c. sugar. I also baked it in 2 different types of pans. The one in the metal pan was done in about 45 mins. and the one in the PC stoneware was done in about 50-55 minutes. Great rec...love the choc chips!

Very, very yummy! My husband agreed. Although, I accidentally altered the recipe. I halved it for just one loaf and added 1/4t. salt (both intentional adjustments), but then failed to half the amount of sour cream.  It baked so beautifully and was so tasty that now I'm afraid to make it with the listed amount!  But I may just so that I'll know the difference.  Great recipe!

Really good BUT I thought it was a little too sweet. Next time I will cut back sugar maybe 1/2 cup. I thought the choc chips were essential. Only change I made was unsweetened apple sauce instead of oil. My husband says 5 stars.

I'm enjoying a warm piece of this delicious bread now!  I used this recipe as a starting point, and made some adjustments, 1/2 cup oil, 1 cup sugar, 1 cup sour cream, 1/2 teaspoon lemon extract. Left out cinnamon and chocolate chips.  It turned out really moist and flavorful!  Lemon and zucchini are a great compliment to each other, who knew?

All I can say is WOW!  This is absolutely the BEST ever.  I couldn't find my bread pans (bread pan thief in the house???) so I used a bundt pan.  Cooked for 60 minutes.  PERFECTION.  I took it to work since I work for a company that is ALL MEN and they (the ones that "tried" this) just kept saying mmmmmmm - and ooooooooo - it was hysterical!  The whole thing was gone by noon... The only thing I changed was I used 2.5 C. of zucchini and no choc. chips.  Sooo moist!  If you didn't tell anyone that zucchini was in it - they would never know!

The first time I made this recipe I forgot to add the sour cream and it was still delicious.  My kids think it is the greatest and I have made it many times just leave out the sour cream. I also bake it in 13x9 pan for a lot less time .

One of the best zucchini bread recipes I've had. I did decrease the sugar a bit (still plenty sweet) and substituted apple sauce for half of the oil and used 1/4 whole wheat flour. Often times when I do this, quick breads can be a little dry, but this was still fabulous. Oh and I added a teaspoon or two of vanilla extract.

I am known for my zucchini bread, so I always veer from new recipes, but I always love the sour cream in breads because it makes things so moist so I tried it.  It was delicious!  I think my bread is slightly more flavorful, but this is more moist at first!  I did 1/2 of the oil with applesauce and peanut butter chips for the chocolate chips.  Also, we are at a higher altitude and the cook time was still cut down to 25 minutes uncovered and 35 min. covered with tin foil! (60 min. total)

This was good!  I skipped the chocolate chips and added craisins instead.  My husband and I ate it all.  I might also add some nuts next time.

Was good but as suggested by another review, the cook time for me was half the time listed.  Infact, I cooked for 45 minutes before checking which was about 5 minutes too long.

This was a wonderful recipe! My husband has never had zucchini bread and was a bit skeptical until he tried this. I did make some changes, based on what I had on hand and personal preferences. I used roughly 3/4 c white and 3/4 c brown sugar- which made it plenty sweet enough. I used almost 3.5 c zucchini and it was not too much (even for the zucchini-hating hubby). I didn't drain the zucchini and it worked just fine. I used 1/2 c berry flavored applesauce (no regular on hand) and 1/2 c oil... perfect texture! I didn't have choc chips, so I used about 1.5 c of orange-flavored cranberries and about 1/4 c pecan pieces. It was sooooo good! Mini muffins baked in about 20-ish minutes and medium loaf in about 45 minutes. It's been requested for when the in-laws visit :-) Thank you so much for a wonderful and obviously adaptable recipe!

Made it exactly how it's written, and it came out perfect. This was my first time making zucchini bread and it was great. My Hubby ate the second loaf all by himself. Next time I make it, someone made a suggestion to add applesauce instead of veggie oil. I want to try that. Maybe add some dried cranberries or raisins. It's a easy recipe to manipulate. Thanks!

I followed this recipe exactly.  It is very good.  I think I might try to do applesauce instead of oil next time so it is a little healthier and skip the chocolate chips.

The house smelled so good while I baked this bread. It was delicious. The crust seemed a bit overcooked. I will try 70 minutes next time. I used only 1.5 cups white sugar and it was sweet enough for me.

My husband said this was the best zucchini bread he had every had!  I  used the applesauce instead of the oil like one other reviewer had mentioned.  I added the chocolate chips (milk chocolate) and some crushed up pecans.  I also put a vanilla icing on top.  It took this from a bread to a cake.  So delicious!

I made this with no alterations to the original recipe. It came out a little dry and cakey which I should've seen coming when I saw how thick the batter turned out. It also had almost no zucchini taste to it. Next time I think I will try to put 3 cups of zucchini instead of 2 like the recipe lists. Good flavor overall though.

I used half the batter to make a bread, and made muffins with the rest.  It is a good recipe, but I thought a little sweet so will reduce the sugar next time.  I also used 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil.

This was an okay recipe- perhaps I'll try tweaking it to fit what I wanted. It was a bit too sweet and the texture was a little bit different than I was looking for. I did like the sour cream and chocolate chips, and my 4 year old likes it... so it'll be a keeper for now.

My bread turned out to be VERY moist, but I took the suggestion of other reviewers and cut the sugar in the recipe in half and I was sorry I did.  It just wasn't sweet enough. I also skipped on chocolate chips - so that didn't help.  It did not take as long to bake as recipe suggests.  I started checking at 40 minutes and kept checking every 5 minutes until toothpick came out clean.  Probably 55 minutes total.  Definitely worth trying again - this time with suggested amount of sugar.

This is the best zucchinni bread I have ever made! It is so moist! Children love it and gobble it up! The only changes I make is I put a dash more of cinnamon and cut down the sugar to 1 cup. Has anyone tried subbing the oil for applesauce yet?

Nice basic recipe that can be tweaked.  I used 1 cup of chopped walnuts instead of the choco chips.  I also added 1 teaspoon of salt, which I was surprised is not in the recipe.  A little salt boosts the flavor in any baking, I've found.  80 minutes seemed really long, so I checked it at 50 and it was almost done.  I took it out at 60 and they were fine.  Also, with any of these breads, I like to make them look prettier.  While they're still hot from the oven, drizzle a light coating of confectioner's sugar glaze.  To about 3/4 to 1 cup of confectioner's sugar, dribble a little water in just until you get a smooth glazing consistency and drizzle it on top of the loaves.  If you have to, use the back of a spoon to get it to spread out over the loaves.  When it all cools and the glaze dries, it just leaves a pretty and shiny top which looks nice.

I will have to admit, this wasn't my all-time favorite zucchini bread, but it had massive rave reviews from everyone else that tried it!  I brought some to our national night out party and they couldn't get enough!  My family loved it as well!  I did listen to other readers and cut the sugar by a 1/2 cup, and that was one of the most frequent comments I got, was that it was great because it wasn't too sweet.  In one of the loaves, I added dark chocolate chips, which I really liked.  The only other change I made was to use applesauce instead of oil.  But as it is zucchini season, we will be making this recipe many more times I'm sure!

Fabulous bread!  I tried it a second time and substituted applesauce for the oil and I think I used too much and came out very spongy.  But, the first batch, made as the recipe is, is wonderful and thank you so much for sharing!  It will be a summer family tradition!

Easy recipe but a bit too sweet for my liking. Next time I will use less sugar and substitute nuts for the chocolate. Also, my loaves were completely baked in less than an hour. Luckily I set my timer for 50 minutes. At 80, they would have been burnt.

I hate to take off a couple stars, because the taste was good, but I felt the batter was too liquidy (I should have squeezed the zucchini out?) and I didn't realize this until after I had added the flour in. Because the batter wasn't very thick all of my chocolate chips sunk three quarters of the way down into the bread. Also my bread was well done after 65 minutes.

This was a very good recipe!  I omitted the chocolate chips, as I like the taste of zucchini bread and I didn't want it overpowered by the chocolate.  I didn't have any sour cream and so I substituted the sour cream with yogurt.  This made the bread very moist and it was quite delicious!  It was devoured!

I used Best foods olive oil dressing in place of the oil and white choc chips, only because I did not have the other two items and it turned out GREAT!  It only took 50 min to bake, important to note as 80 min. would have been way too long

EXCELLENT.  I made this and took it up to the Moose Club a few times and the women there raved about it and they all wanted the recipe.  And most of them can cook quite well. Made exactly as per the recipe. Only one person said it was too sweet so I tried with 1/2 of the sugar replaced with Splenda. It was good like that too. Am going to try with raisins instead of the chocoate chips too.

This is not a bad recipe at all, but it just didn't wow me, either. For me, the baking time was right on. It was a surprisingly wet batter, so I think that's why. I think that was because I did not strain out the zucchini, unlike some other folks per their comments.  Our family likes this bread, but no one was totally sold on the chocolate chips, plus they all sunk to the bottom. (Afterward, I vaguely remembered a tip that if you are going to put chocolate chips in a quick bread or thinner-type batter that you shake the chocolate chips in about 1/4 cup flour and that will help them keep from sinking.)  I still think it could use a little more spice, maybe some nutmeg and clove or something, in my non-professional opinion. Thanks for sharing this recipe. Give it a try! See what you think.

This was great!  I used Chocolate Chunks instead of chips and cut the sugar by half cup.   I've never made zucchini bread - I usually make banana breads.  So, this was a bit on the dry side compared to what I'm used to ...not sure if it was something I did or if that is just how a zucchini bread is in comparison.  Either way -- it was a big hit with my family and I loved it with my coffee this morning!

Wonderful! I left out the chocolate chips though. I packed it in my husbands lunch and the one day I forgot it he came home asking how soon I could make it again because he really missed it. I also made a few loaves for friends as gifts and they went over great. This will be in my recipe box for life!

Great recipe!  I took other's suggestions and reduced sugar to 1 1/2 cups, skipped the choc. chips and baked for only 40 minutes.  I have never grated Zucchini before and wasn't sure about removing seeds.  I took for granted that I should.  I also rung out the extra juice which really lightened the weight of the loaves.  The bread came out very moist and didn't fall apart like some others that I have eaten.

FANTASTIC!  Due to lack of groceries, I made a couple of changes - applesauce for oil, no choc chips.  And instead of 9x5 pans, I used 8x4 pans.  They only had to bake 45 mins, plus an extra 5 mins with the heat off & oven door cracked.  The loaves turned out beautifully!!  We used zucchini freshly picked from the garden, and this recipe will be used often I'm sure... we have LOTS of zucchini. LOL

Nice and moist. I made 12 muffins and 1 loaf of bread. The muffins took about 35 minutes to bake. I only used 1 cup of sugar and it's still plenty sweet due to the chocolate chips. I'll definitely be keeping this in my recipe library!

When my kids saw the monster zucchins my neighbor gave us, they freaked out. I made this recipe, my son loved it and my husband thought it was excellent! My coworkers devoured it and I've been given 2 more giant zucchinis since my husband told my neighbor about this bread.  Vey good, moist and yummy.  I followed the recipe as it was written.

If any of you are curious about substitutions, I used the 2 c white flour/1 c wheat flour and the 1 c sugar/1/4 c maple syrup substitutions that other people suggested, and I also switched it to 1 c light sour cream and 1/2 c oil to cut down on the fat. Worked great--plenty moist and very light.

I loved this.  I didn't use chocolate, but used raisins instead. I also used low-fat vanilla yogurt instead of the sour cream.  Came out light like a cake.  Will definitely be making this again.

It's too yummy. Ate the whole loaf in 2 days...hard to share it between the family. Will make it again and freeze a bunch of loaves...hope it freezes well! Made it with mini choc chips and they didn't sink to the bottom. Baked up perfectly in about 50-60 minutes. Absolutely my favorite. Have a ton of large zucchini so I tried 3 different recipes...this one is the winner with the whole family. Thanks!

This recipe is delicious!  It will be the last zucchini bread recipe I search for -- by far my favorite, and I love the addition of the chocolate chips and sour cream! YUM!     I made 1 loaf, and 3 mini loafs.  My big loaf cracked in half, and the bottom was left in the pan, so following the advice of another reviewer, next time I will better grease and flour my pan.  Also, I only baked around 1 hour.

Very good.  I took an idea from another zucchini bread recipe and added cocoa.  For the two loaves I added 6 tbsp. of unsweetened cocoa.  It was very good and moist.  I added the cocoa to half the batter and then poured half the cocoa batter in each pan and did the same with the plain batter.  You can take a utensil to make is marbled if you like. EDITED to add:  Also made this with summer squash this summer.  I still do the cocoa adding too, since we love chocolate.

This was good...not too dry, not too moist.  I think maybe I'd either leave out the chocolate chips or leave out the cinnamon, but not put both in at the same time in the future - but it was still very good bread.  Thanks!

This recipe is fantastic!  My husband, who thought i was mad for putting courgettes (zucchini) into sweet bread, can't get enough.  I did reduce the sugar by 1/4 c per loaf, as I was using milk chocolate chips rather than semi-sweet.  I also made a loaf with chopped walnuts.  Yum yum!

I've been making zucchini bread for many years.  I'm always looking for something a little "healthier", and even though this isn't really any healthier, it is most delicious!  The sour cream adds a nice touch.  I didn't add chocolate chips or raisins, just omitted them from the recipe.

My husband likes it and a few loaves have been shared with friends.  I think you will like this recipe!

Followed this recipe to exactness, just omitted the chocolate chips. The bread is very tender and moist while the outside crust is perfectly crisp. Great texture in both areas. 

Before adding the grated zucchini I put it in a colander, salted it (this will make it sweat) and let it drain for a bit. Then I squeezed all the water out of it to avoid too much extra liquid in the recipe. This is THE recipe I will be using for zucchini bread from now on. Thanks!

My 10 year-old daughter loved it, even though I told her it has "Zucchini" in the name -- and, therefore, zucchini in the batter. Me: "You won't even notice it." Her: "I will." Me: "Triple-dog-dare you." Her: "I LOVE THIS STUFF!" It was a hit, despite the direct veggie connection. I didn't even use the chocolate chips! Thanks for sharing.

Really yummy bread! I also used less sugar (1.5c), applesauce instead, and did 2c all purpose and 1c wholemeal.  My cooking time was also 60 min and it probably could have gone 5-10 min less.  My only issue is my bread turned out a little too dense and flatter than I hoped for. Any ideas why? I am not a huge baker so I'm not sure.

this was outstanding!  I couldn't get enough!  I did reduce the sugar by 1/2 cup, and made one loaf with the chocolate chips, and one with walnuts and 1 tsp vanilla.  They were both amazing.  I couldn't figure out which one I preferred.  Rave reviews from all my picky family members and friends!  Can`t wait to make this again.

This bread was awesome! The onlt thing I did different was I didn't add the chocolate chips. I figured it was already sweet enough with the 2 cups of sugar. It was amazing!! Will make again!!

My gf gave me this recipe, and I made it last week following it exactly, cooking time and all. Here I am, not quite a week later, making it again. Kids love it. The spouse loves it. I love it. Moist and tasty. I think I will try reducing sugar and using applesauce as some have suggested just to try to be more healthy, but the recipe as it is is perfect too.

you really have to drain the zucchini or else you will have a rubbery bread like mine. also, i think mixing in the flour before the zucchini will work and combine better. otherwise, this is a really great recipe.

Really fantastic recipe.  My first time making zucchini bread. You DO NOT have to peel the zucchini, by the way! (I had to google)  I replaced the veg oil (because I was out of it) with 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup canola/olive blend.  I also omitted the choc chips. I gave the recipe only 4 stars b/c you'll need to watch the bake time. I took it out 10 minutes early and it's perfect.

Excellent bread with the suggested modifications of less sugar and some maple syrup as well as the wheat flour. Also I did dry the zucchini, used milk chocolate chips, and decreased the baking time. Its my new bread recipe - can't wait to try it with bananas!

Wanted to sneak some veggies into the kids snacks, so this looked like a good choice. I substituted 1 cup WW flour and reduced the sugar to 1 cup and skipped the choc chips. Turned out ok, a little on the dense side, maybe due to the WW flour? The kids love it, though, hence 4 stars.

The sour cream in this recipe makes all the difference. Loaves are moist, dense, and bake beautifully. I've omitted the chocolate and added dried cranberries which was out of this world. Look forward to experimenting with other add-ins. This is by far the best zucchini bread recipe I've found. You can't go wrong with this one!

This is a great bread recipe! I opted to make mine a tiny bit healthier. I used all whole wheat flour. Like other reviewers had done, I used applesauce in place of the oil. For sugar, I used 1 cup white sugar, and a 1/4 cup agave nectar. Which made for a perfect sweetness. I also added craisins along with the choc chips, which adds a nice tang with the sweet chocolate. Next time I will try and substitute yogurt for the sour cream. Deeeelicious!! =)

I made this bread last night. We had it for breakfast this morning. My kids all really liked it. I put chocolate chips in one loaf and left the other one plain. I made it just as the recipe called for and it came out great. I will make it again.

Yum!  This bread was so moist.  Next time I will heavily grease the pan though as mine stuck to the bottom a bit.  Also as a helpful tip, try tossing the chocolate chips in a bit of the flour so that they don't sink!

This was the first time I tried to make zucchini bread, and this recipe is wonderful.  It is very moist...I used milk chocolate chips not semi-sweet (my preference).  However, I did use a whole bag, which was way too much but it was still delicious.  Next time I will use either smaller chips or chop up the big ones so they don't sink.  I did save some out of the bag and place them on top before baking which evened it out.  My fiance wasn't crazy about the chocolate chips in it but next time he can make it.  Thanks

Awesome recipe.  There was a definite need for a bit more sugar, and cinnamon, and cut out the chocolate completely.  Otherwise, this is a great stepping stone for people that are new to making zucchini bread.

This was a good recipe. However I am not partial to either rasins or chocolate in my zucchini bread, so I eliminated that part and added about 1/4 cup of buttermilk, and just under the 1/2 cup of sour cream. It turned out so well, this will definitely be added to my favorite recipes. Thank you Linda for such a good recipe.

Very yummy recipe.  I halved the sugar.  The original recipe was a bit to sweet.  
We also add chocolate chips or raisins when desired.  
Great recipe!

Healthier options for a this great recipe. You can cut the sugar dose in 1/2.  40-45 minutes to bake, not 80.  You can use greek yogurt or kefir instead of sour cream.

Made this recipe today - Excellent. Quick and easy as a starter recipe that can be easily tweaked to your personal preference.

I did make a couple of changes -
1- I didn't add the chocolate chips.
2- I did strain the zucchini like someone else had commented on doing, but I kept the juice
3-used the juice to replace half of the oil (1/2cup zucc juice, 1/2 cup oil)
4-I only have one bread pan, so I lined mine with parchment paper for quicker transfer of bread/batter. 
5-As someone had mentioned that it turns out quite sweet I used 1cup of white sugar, and 1 cup of brown sugar. 
6-I also added a 1/4tsp of Vanilla.

This worked perfectly. Still came out perfect brown, with just a little crisp on the crust. I also needed only 60 mins of bake time; however, - I have a convection oven. 
Just had a piece and it is tasty, and moist :-D I will be keeping this recipe. 
The next time I'm going to try adding walnuts.

I found that 80 minutes was too much time.  I took the loaves out after 65 and they were very dark on the bottom.  I think 55 minutes in my oven would have been better.  So watch your temps and trust your nose.   Also, I subsitituted the sour cream for lemon Greek yogurt and, even though it's a bit over done, it is delicious.

As others suggested, I added lemon oil and used applesauce in place of oil.  I also added dried cranberries and chopped walnuts in place of choc.  Great results.

A good, moist bread. I followed the directions as given except traded out pecans for the chips. We didn't notice the sour cream flavor but enjoyed it.

Was a very good and easy recipe.  I did NOT have two pans therefore put the entire recipe into one which made the bread slightly heavy as I had to cook much longer but I was surprised that it turned out as good as it did despite having done that.  I also did NOT add chocolate chips instead added walnuts which I thought tasted amazing...I also used 1 cup white flour and 2 cups whole wheat as I had ran out of white and actually prefer the whole wheat for the health factor.  I would make again but would likely use an alternative for the sugar next time.

Delicious! Did not adjust this recipe at all, and that's unusual for me. I had made another recipe from one of my standby cookbooks and it came out dry on the edges and undercooked in the center.  
This was enough to make one 8x5 loaf pan (cooked 80 minutes in silicone pan) and 8 mini loaves (40 minutes in nonstick metal pan).  Very moist and although the chocolate chips ended up nearer to the bottom of the loaf, when you cut a slice, you still get it all.  Used two average sized zucchini, not those gigantic ones that are all over the markets this time of year, and it was just the right amount. This is definitely a keeper--thanks GAF55!

A good zucchini bread recipe is a must for most gardeners. I found this one simple and yummy but next time I think I am going to make it with walnuts instead of chocolate chips. I found that the chocolate and sour cream kind of clashed. Also I made mine with apple sauce instead of oil.

Awesome...moist...delicious!  As a variation, and to cut down on the calories, I used half the oil and half the sugar.  I added an extra cup of zucchini (3 in all) and added 1 cup of plain yogurt instead of the 1.5 cups of sour cream.  I also added 1 cup of chopped almonds (or your favourite nuts).....yummy!  Try adding some chocolate chips!  My kids overlooked the zucchini content when they heard there was chocolate in it!  By far, one of my favourite recipes because it is an easy, no-fail recipe.

Myself and my kids really liked this bread!  I made it with the chocolate chips.  I cut the sugar in half and used 2 cups white flour and 1 whole wheat flour.  I doubled the cinnamon and next time will add vanilla.  Very easy recipe and delicious!

Wonderful recipe with a few tweaks!  1st I strained the water from the zucchini, only added 1 1/4 C of sugar. Added 3/4 C of craisins instead of chocolate chips, 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract and a pinch of salt. I baked 1 loaf for about 40 minutes or so and the rest of the batter I made into cupcakes which only took 20 minutes. Wonderful recipe!

I made three loaves and they were awesome.  I made one with raisins, the other with chocolate chips and the last one with dried cranberries.  The raisin and chocolate chip one didn't turn out as well as the cranberry loaf.

This IS thee BEST zucchini bread recipe ever.  When I make it - everyone asks for the recipe.  

I DO NOT recommend squeezing out the zucchini...it makes for a dryer bread.

Moist is what I'm all about and I add the larger sugar crystals on top to give it that crispy topping.

To die for.  You will eat all of the loaves yourself.

I used the recipe but did add a tablespoon of vanilla and a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon.  When I put them into their loaf pans, I added some chocolate chips to one per my grandchildrens request.  Both loaves didn't last a day.

Excellent!!! Love this recipe. I have made four loafs already! Very easy. I chopped up the zucchuini in tiny pieces instead of shredding. My husband never had zucchini bread before and he couldn't stop eating it.

Great recipe.  I've made it twice and it comes out moist and delicious.  I use apple sauce instead of oil and add cream cheese chunks to the batter.  I bought some zucchini bread at a market in D.C. and it had the cream cheese baked in.  I couldn't imagine making eating it without the cream cheese.  It is so yummy!

I ended up putting a few extra chocolate chips in it, since I love chocolate, I also cut the baking time by ten minutes, just to be on the safe side, and it seemed like the perfect decision as it was just right.  Really good and you wouldn't even know there is zucchini in there.  Good way to get your veggies in and enjoy a tasty treat.

Okay, I always get a wee-bit annoyed when people give five stars to a recipe, yet change the heck out of it. BUT...let me share my changes.  My daughter is away at college and she begged me to make her some chocolate chip cookies. Oh wait. No, zucchini bread. Mmm. Let me see what I can find. Thus I stumbled on this. Went to the store and got the zucchini and started the recipe.  My first change was to swap out one cup of cake flour for the AP just for the heck of it. I used 1-3/4 cups of sugar and 3/4 cups of sour cream. And, added a teaspoon of vanilla. I also sqeezed the moisture out of the zucchini, but the batter was still too moist. I added an additional 1/4 cup of flour. Consistency was perfect. Then to add the chocolate chips.   Wups, forgot to get them at the store. It's a few days before Halloween and of course, I have lots of candy. So I "borrowed" ten bars of Nestle Crunch and chopped them up and added them to the batter.  Sixty-five minutes in the oven. Perfect texture. And absolutely WONDERFUL. A tad sweet for my personal tastes, but for my sugar-monger college-aged daughter, this will be perfect.

We had a bunch of extra zucchini from our garden and so I tried this recipe, not having made zucchini bread before, and the first batch came out wonderful. I followed the recipe to the letter except I left out the chocolate chips. Also, it only took 60 minutes to cook in a convection oven. I also took and made up 7 other batches resulting in 14 more loaves. I wrapped them up with Press-N-Seal and Ziploc freezer bags and froze them.

This was the yummiest Zucchini bread I have ever made.  It came out very moist.  I added dried cherries along with the chocolate chips, it made it even more wonderful!

first time making zucchini bread. like everyone else i altered this recipe. i halved the recipe because i only had one cup of zucchini. i switched out the oil for chunky applesauce, substituted half the white sugar with organic raw sugar, added a teaspoon of vanilla and half a teaspoon of salt. the cooking time was way off (even with the substitutions) and i'm sure, had i left it in the full 80 minutes, my bread would have been incinerated. but in the end even the slightly-too-dark edges were still delicious, just make sure you add some salt to your recipe!

Excellent zucchini bread! The only things I somewhat changed were the baking times, I only baked it for 60 minutes, used a little less sugar and no chocolate chips. I served it warm and it was a hit!

Made with 1c cinnamon apple sauce in place of 1c oil and 3/4c of Soy flour in place of part of the white flower.  Decreased chocolate chips to 1/2 cup.  Recipe was very moist and good over all.  Next time I think I'll add a bit of orange zest - 1 teaspoon to increase the flavor.

Made one loaf with chocolate chips and one raisins. The kids loved the chocolate chip one but my husband and I thought there was too much chocolate in it. I froze the second loaf. Good, moist recipe though.

Really liked the bread. Had a hard time getting it out of the pan even though I greased it pretty good. Next time I will flour the pan as well. Will make again.

The bake time was way too long.  The bread came out rather dry...could be my oven.  However, my son did like it, and that's about as close as he'll come to eating a "vegetable" (of course, I just told him it was quick bread - didn't mention the zucchini)

I've never made zucchini bread before, and I don't think I've ever had it...so I wasn't sure what to expect. That said, I thought it was pretty good. Kind of crumbly, but otherwise good. However, my husband LOVES zucchini bread and hated this recipe. I guess I won't be making this again.

This recipe is awesome. Used 2c. whole wheat flour and 1 c. white and unsweetened applesauce also omitted sugar and used splenda to accomadate diabetics in family. omitted chocolate and used Hershey's cinnamon chips, and added a dash of nutmeg and ginger. Also tossed in a handful of chopped cashews. Very moist and flavorful. Family who doesn't norally eat zucchinni just love it.

This is a great recipe that I made with some substitutions for dietary needs/preference and it was perfect. First I cut the recipe in half because I only wanted one loaf. I used organic whole wheat pastry flour , and like another reviewer I substituted applesauce for oil. (A single serving 1/2 cup of organic no-sugar-added applesauce, because again, I was only making one loaf). I reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup especially since the applesauce added sweetness too. I also left out the chocolate chips. I checked on it after 50 mins and it was perfectly done. So very tasty and goes very well with coffee.

I followed the recipe exactly, including the chocolate chips and it was a big hit.  I doubled the recipe because I had a lot of end-of-summer zucchini to clear out of the garden.  One of the cups of sugar I substituted with brown sugar.  I think that it enhanced the taste. So good!

This is delicious. The changes I made were: I used 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil.  1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. 1 cup of semi sweet choc chips and I baked for 1 hour. Do not bake for 80 min like the recipe says.

I made this for my husband (I am on Keto) so am going buy what he says. VERY. GOOD was his response.
I made it as it was written but did also find it only took an hour to bake.  I will make this again. I may make them into muffins for easy freeze and grab snacks for him and my Dad.

Only baked for 50-55 min, per some reviewers suggestions. Made just like the recipe for 1 batch & another gluten-free by substituting gluten-free flour mix. Batter seemed to need more liquid, but it turned out fine.

Wonderful recipe! I kept everything the same for the chocolate chip option except the oil which I replaced with apple butter. (Its a common replacement for applesauce in my house.) I needed pre-portioned sizes for my kids who eat and run so I did muffins. Baked up perfectly in only 35 minutes at the existing 350°.

This was fabulous!  I only used a half bag of mini chocolate chips as that is what I had on hand but followed the rest to a 'T'!  Not a single bite of either loaf was left!  My ten year old son has hoarded his to make it last longer!  Thanks!

We made this recipe as written, but only put chocolate chips in one loaf.  I loved it!  The best zucchini bread I've had in a long time and I liked it both with or without the chocolate chips.  My two oldest kids also loved it.  My husband hated the loaf with the chocolate chips, but liked the other.  I plan on trying it with raisins next time.  Also, 80 minutes was about 5 or so minutes too long for our oven, so keep an eye on it once you get past an hour baking.  Will make again!

I made half the recipe because I had only one pan. It was fantastic! Hearty and moist. I’ll use this recipe again.

The recipe called for baking 80 min . I set the timer for 70 min and it was still a little overdone.  Not the best I have ever made.

I don't know if there is a "quality" of zucchini but this didn't have much flavor. Going to try again with a few additions. It has good texture and very moist, but bland.

This was a really good recipe but it needed salt.  I’m not sure why it didn’t call for it but next time I will probably add 1/4-1/2 tsp of salt.  I also only needed to cook it for 1 hour.  I think my oven cooks hot but just FYI

I had really high hopes for this recipe. I was looking to make zucchini bread with new zucchinis because my kids of been craving it for a while. I put the bread in the oven for us said one hour and 20 minutes.   at one hour cook time I went to check on the bread and it was completely done and smelling a little bit burnt. I was super disappointed by this because I have done everything exactly as the recipe said I even tried out the zucchini a little bit as one of the comments had said Brad would be light and fluffy. When I took it out they wouldn’t even come out of the pan the sides were so burnt. My nonstick pans that I greased with butter were completely ruined. I would definitely recommend not cooking as long and setting the oven at maybe  320 so this bread does not get overtime.

I expected my zucchini bread to be more sweet, like the classic recipe. This was savory and just not my kind of food. Wouldn't say it was bad, but I did not enjoy it.

I made 2 Loaves yesterday and this  is KILLER...I am making more today...Hint...1'4 cup honey and 1 cup sugar. This is so moist and delicious. I didn't have nuts for the first 2 but it was still awesome. The next 2 will have Walnuts :-)))   Great recipe, Thank you: Amended 8/8/17...Forgot to say thanks for the applesauce idea, no difference, honey and molasses and 1 cup sugar makes it even better, and with walnuts this is off the hook...worthy of 5 stars all day long

Really yummy. I used half coconut oil and half butter instead of oil because they didn't have any. I also made muffins instead of loaves. They were light, fluffy and tasty!

I made this bread today and it was terrific. Just go easy on the chocolate chips. With this recipe, less is more. Make sure you peel the zucchini first and after grating, squeeze the liquid out with a paper towel. NO SEEDS!!!

I followed the ingredient list, leaving out chocolate chips and substituting pecan pieces. I set the timer for 60 minutes instead of 80. Glad I did. It was already overdone at 60 minutes. It would have been ruined if I'd cooked it the entire 80 minutes. It still has a great flavor, just incredibly dry from overcooking. Next time I will check at 30 - 40 minutes.

The measurements for this recipe are way off. I greased two 9x5" loaf pans as instructed. I measured all the ingredients exactly as the recipe says. I usually double check to make sure all my measurements and ingredients are correct and they were. The trouble started when I spooned the ingredients into the loaf pans. There was only enough to fill each pan about 1/3 to the top. So in disgust, I scraped all the batter into one pan. It made a big, beautiful loaf and didn't overflow. The flavor was good, but overall this was a big disappointment.

I made this a few days ago.  I did substitute the oil with applesauce.  We thought it was good, it was very moist.  I didn't add the chocolate chips.  I made 3 smaller loaves so I could freeze two or give them away.  I think if I make this again, I would probably add a bit more cinnamon.  Overall it was good!

I substituted the eggs for 3/4 c silken tofu and the sour cream for a vegan alternative. My staff loved them! I would however add 1/2 a teaspoon of salt to the mix, then brush with melted butter when they are hot.

This is the best Zucchini Bread I've made!  I did add 1 tsp. ground cloves and it was yummy!  I'd also add more walnuts next batch that I make.  My husband says this is the best Zucchini Bread I've ever made.  I'm happy with it!

My grandkids LOVED it! I did decrease the sugar 1/2 cup. Baking time was 60 minutes. 2 cups of zucchini is about 2 medium squashes.

Made this because everyone raved about it. I would say it's wayyy to sweet, but that's just my preference. I would cut the sugar down to half maybe and try it again.

this was a good recipe but I think it needed more chocolate chips and maybe a splash of vanilla.  I made half of the batter into a bread and half into muffins (12  muffins - baked for 32 minutes)  I also replaced the oil with 1/2 C applesauce and 1/2 C butter.

I skipped the chocolate chips, and used 6oz of Tillamook Wild Huckleberry Yogurt instead of the Sour Cream. It was awesome.

For Muffin tins, I only cooked them 30min, the cake pan the whole time.

Great recipe.  Very moist and has a great flavor.  I would recommend adding 1 tsp of salt for more flavor.  Although the recipe turned out great, a little salt would have enhanced the flavor.

I used raisins and 1/2 tsp baking powder instead of 1/4. I also used one regular sized loaf pan and one small loaf pan because I like it to puff up nice and big. Both loaves came out beautifully and taste awesome!

This is the only zucchini bread recipe I ever use. It's great that it makes two loaves because it goes so quickly, one isn't enough. Everyone always says it's the best zucchini bread they've had, and I've been asked for the recipe numerous times. Definitely one to add to the recipe box.

I used others suggestions and used 1 1/2 C white sugar, 1/2 C brown sugar. I also added 1t vanilla and 1/2t salt. On some recipes, I sub'd applesauce for the oil. Used light sour cream. We did like with raisins but even more so with the chocolate chips. I even made one in a bundt pan and frosted w/ cream cheese icing. I also buttered and floured pans 1st

This is my new favourite quick bread. I have a bumper crop of zukes that I am looking to do something with, and this was a huge success. Even my veggie adverse toddler gobbled it up. I will make this again and again. I tried it with applesauce instead of oil, and it tasted even better.

Dilicious, light snd very yummy.  I used zucchini from our garden. I added more than the recipe called for .  I used more cinnamon and one with dark choc chips, one without. Only recipe I use now but will try apple sauce than all the oil.

This recipe is one of the best Zucchini Bread recipes my wife and I have ever tasted. I did a few minor changes and the results were fantastic for our household. I dropped the chocolate chips and raisins, added walnut bits and pieces and added 1/2 tsp. of fresh grated nutmeg. Today I will be making our 3rd batch, only this time it will be a double batch. Christmas is coming so in the freezer some will go. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I've made this 3 or 4 times now.  Shred the zucchini on top of paper towels and push down on top of the zucchini with additional paper towels.  Get as much of the moisture out as possible.  Also (i have a gas stove) it worked better for me cooking them for 60 minutes.  Delicious!

Like other reviewers, my bread came out kind of dry, kind of bland- not much zucchini flavor. It was "okay". I tried one loaf in a metal pan and the other in glass to see if that made a difference - both were done after 60 minutes, not 80. I also put chocolate chips in 1 and left it out of the other after some reviewers said the taste "didn't meld" well. I thought the chocolate chips added a little flavor, so I'd keep 'em. Not a terrible recipe, but okay.

Great, quick and easy recipe!  I followed original directions but baked entire recipe in a bundt pan.  Spray heavily with Pam.  Bad for 1 hour and cool upside down.  Bread slid right out.

This is by far the best one I've done.  The sour cream made a big difference to me.  Even my kids liked it....and they don't like anything!

I made it exactly as directed and it turned out wonderfully! Moist and very flavorful! I would say to oil the pans immediately before pouring in the batter, otherwise it seems to stick. Also, the chocolate is the dominant flavor, and the chips will sink to the bottom of the pan and stick, so may want to reduce. I've gotten nothing but compliments on it so much that I'm experimenting with it now! Butterscotch chips are a big hit, I'm going to try lemon and vanilla next! Good luck and enjoy!

Mmmmmm!! So delicious!! Couldn't figure out why no salt. I do kind of wish I added it. I did add a little vanilla, and a super ripe banana, just because I had one. Baked in a very large loaf pan for 80-90 minutes. Then I rubbed a pat of butter on the top right when I took it out. It was so beautiful, I wish I took a picture. We were just too excited to cut into it. It's definitely a big hit, and I'll be adding this to the lineup! Thanks!!

This was the best recipe I've ever come across for zucchini bread.  I liked that the bread wasn't overly sweet.  I did accidentally double the sour cream (I put in a cup instead of a half cup - I'll wear my glasses next time but it ended up being a happy accident). I also used coconut oil in place of the vegetable oil. It was perfect!

Delicious, moist, and light!!!

Things we altered:
1. Made muffins instead of loaves (recipe yielded 3 dozen- cook time= 22min)
2. Exchanged 3/4 of the flour for cocoa powder so they were chocolate chocolate chip muffins :)
3. Substituted coconut oil instead of the vegetable oil (I do this in everything I bake)
4. I put the zucchini in my bullet blender instead of grating it. I also did not use the very interior area of the zucchini because mine was so seedy. 

Notes: the chocolate chips make these very decadent and delicious!! If I wanted to make breakfast muffins next time instead of dessert muffins, I would omit the chocolate chips. I think you could substitute blended bananas instead of zucchini when it's out of season also! We put sprinkles on the tops before baking and they came our of the oven so cute!

Really liked the overall taste and texture! I didn't put in the chocolate chips but added dried cranberries instead. I followed the advise given and only used 1 1/2 cups of sugar.  My bread only took 35 minutes to cook because I used a 9x13" pan since all my bread pan were still packed somewhere after our move!  :)

Made this recipe tonight. Read at least 15 recipes from Pinterest to here. Followed a comment from somewhere that suggested to use a vegetable peeler, then after grating, put the grated zucchini in a colander to get as much liquid out as possible. I also sifted the dry ingredients to add to the wet, used parchment paper in the bottom of the pan. My husband, who doesn't like zucchini, loved this bread. Made 2 beautiful loaves. I didn't use chocolate chips but substituted chopped walnuts instead. For 2 cups of grated zucchini I grated 2 medium zucchini. When drained and measured I had more than 2 cups but used only the 2 cups called for in the recipe. Great recipe. Easy. And the house smells delish. The bread took about 70 minutes in my oven. Thanks for a great recipe.

When I made the bread I substituted raisins for the chocolate chips and applesauce for the oil.  I also only cooked the bread for 60 minutes.  The bread turned out great.  I think next time I will use less raisins because they were a little over powering.  I also plan on using walnuts instead of raisins at some point.  Everyone I shared the bread with loved it.

I changed it just a bit...used 3 1/2 C flour,1 tspn Salt, 3/4 tspn baking soda, 3/4 tspn baking powder,3 tspn Cinnamon, 3 eggs, 1 C vegetable oil, 2 C white sugar, 3 tspn Vanilla extract, 2 C grated Zucchini, 3 very ripe mashed Bananas, 1/3 C water. Follow basic recipe except it will take more like 1 1/4 hours to fully cook through. 

I call it Bana-Zinni Bread

This bread was decent...nice and cakey, but lacking something (kind of bland somehow).  I was hoping it'd be much tangier due to the addition of the sour cream...I always make my banana breads with sour cream and they turn out great, but this was just so-so.  It could be because I didn' use either the raisins or the chocolate chips and instead substituted about a half cup of canned (drained) chopped pineapple instead.  The result was a bread similar to a carrot cake, but next time I might try and find a way to add more sour cream or maybe some salt or vanilla might help.  Not sure, but I'll have to experiment...

Really really good but very glad I followed the advice of others and lowered sugar.  I used about 1 1/3 cup and it was still sugary.  Overall it was my first time making zucchini bread and I loved this recipe.  I didn't add chocolate chips or raisins either.   Mine was cooked in 50mins.

I Adore it soooooooooooo much it tastes very yummy ( i love zucchini and eat it everyday pretty much) . I didn't add chocolate chip and raisins because it was already sweet. If i did it wouldn't have tasted sooo good and zucchini and chocolate together I thought were a bad idea.

One bite of this (baked as muffins- without any changes to the recipe) and my picky husband said," you did good with this one". We made it again this morning, but substituted apple sauce for most if the oil, and it is even better! A bit harder to get out of the cupcake paper, but the flavor is beautiful! I DO suggest grating the zucchini fine, or you end up with green worms in them.... Which my six year old thought was cool!

This was a success for me! I cut the recipe in half since I only have one loaf pan, and I did make some substitutions. Since I didn't have half an egg, I used one egg and one half banana. I also used reduced fat sour cream, and half white sugar and half brown sugar (I do this for most of my baking.) 

The bread was moist and delicious. It only needed to be cooked for 55 minutes in my Bosch oven. Based on other reviews, I started checking it at 45 minutes to make sure I didn't over do it. 

I liked the chocolate, and the zucchini taste still came through. I will make this again.

Didn't love the flavor of this bread, though I do admit I substituted the oil for applesauce. Not sure if it changed the bread significantly but that was the only change I made.

I think the bread will be delicious with a shorter cooking time. I think the estimated time was grossly overestimated and both of my loaves were burned on the edges and the nuts on top were darker than desired. Always trust your gut, I've been making zucchini bread for years and something told me that it was too long but I gave it the benefit of the doubt since I've never used as much oil or sour cream in any of my recipes.

Used leftover grated zucchini and carrot mix with  a handful of milk chocolate chips, a handful of white chips, and a handful of  pomegranate flavored crasins.  Nice with a cup of tea and a little orange marmalade.

This was delicious, but I had to tweek it.  I didn't have sour cream, but I did have Greek plain yogurt which I used instead, but I goofed having put in a cup instead of half a cup.  It turned out to be perfect and I think had I used just half a cup, it might have been too dry.  It was such a hit, I made a second batch the following day again using the whole cup of yogurt and adding in dried cranberries.  It was really yummy and a wonderful use of the leftover zucchini and/ or yellow squash pulp that I had from coring for a large batch of stuffed zucchini.  I don't know which was better, the smell of it baking or the actual taste of the bread.  They were both wonderful.

Made as directed, minus chocolate. I am looking for a good Basic Zucchini Bread recipe. This was bland and too sweet.    Would I order the finished bread at a cafe for $... No.
