OK...I admit that I did not make the recipe just as described, but what I made was reviewed by my husband as "the best soup you've ever made."  Very high praise indeed!!  I browned fresh onions (instead of dried) and peppers first, then added the potatoes to brown as well.  To make things even easier on myself, I used half a sack of those frozen cut up potatoes that are meant to be for hash browns.  Then, instead of the brats, I used two packages of sliced Hilshire Farms smoked sausages (they are already cooked, so that speeds up the time).  The rest was cooked as indicated.  EXCELLENT FLAVOR!!!  I will definitely be making this one again!

My husband and I really enjoy this. I like to use brats that we grilled the day before, because it gives the stew a wonderful smoky flavor. For those users who complain that it's too greasy: Do not stir in cheese until the end of cooking. I usually add it in the last 30 minutes and turn the crockpot to high. You can also use half cheddar and half american cheese (which melts and incorporates better). That way, the cheddar flavor comes out, but the stew is rich and creamy. Hope these suggestions help!

I wasn't sure what to expect with all the differing reviews.  We enjoyed this, it was a bit like comfort food on a cold winter night.  My "tweaks" were chicken stock in place of water (only because I had a container opened already) and I added one can of cheddar cheese soup since some reviewers said there was not enough liquid.  Our stew was a touch soupy, but I prepared for that with a large hunk of crusty bread to soak up the sauce!  Please keep in mind that even after 4 hours on High, the potatoes were still a touch hard, but not enough to stop us from eating dinner then. It was nice to find a recipe for bratwurst that was different, yet tasty.

This came out awesome! I have a fairly small slow cooker and I filled it to the very top.  My mom makes a noncheese stew very similar to this, but she uses sausage not brats so I did the same because I know it tastes good._____________I used 28oz of Johnsonville smoked sausage, 3 potatoes, fresh green beans, a little bit of chopped bell pepper, almost 2 cups of shredded cheddar, 2 cans cream of mushroom soup, 2 cans cheddar soup, 1 packet onion soup mix, and some garlic powder.___________I mixed the soups/cheese/spice in a bowl, then I alternated pouring it and the meat/veg into the cooker just so everything would fit. Cooked overnight ~10hrs on low, then switched it to warm mode till dinner. I was worried it would be too cheesy, but I think it came out great. It was nice and thick, I didn't use any water. Will def make again thank you!

We loved this!  The only changes I made were that I left out the red peppers (didn't have any, or I surely would have added them), and I used new (red) potatoes and left the skins on - yum!  I didn't read the other reviews before making this, or I might have used the cheese soup, too (probably in addition to the cream of mushroom, because I was wishing there was more sauce/liquid!).  I didn't precook the potatoes as some other reviewers suggested, but I did set my crock pot on low and cooked for 6-7 hours.  It came out great - we will definitely make this again!

This sounded like a foolproof recipe, what could go wrong with brats and cheese?  Since my slowcooker only has 2 settings,  I decided to cook all the ingredients on low for 6 hours.  I fully cooked the brats and used 1/2 italian and 1/2 hot italian brats.  I drained them on paper towels to cut down on the grease. After cooking, the potatoes were not yet done, as they still had a hard-waxy texture.  The dish was also rather salty, but that may be due to all the canned ingredients.  The finished product was also very runny, I had been expecting more of a creamy soup, not a cheese broth.  A can of cheese soup or maybe nacho cheese would have really helped.  Additionally, there was just too much bratwurst in this recipe, I'd probably halve it.  Lastly, I think that some roughly chopped kale would be excellent in this.  I might try this again, but only with these changes.

When I came across this recipe, I thought for sure I had found a winner since we love brats, cheese and potatoes.  What we ended up with was far from that.  The potatoes were barely done, the "sauce" was greasy and thin and it didn't really taste anything like cheese.  I'm not sure if our expectations were too high or if I am just too new to the slow cooking world and I didn't know enough secrets to fix it up like some of the reviews I read afterwards had listed, but I seriously doubt I will be making this again anytime soon.  Why waste perfectly good brats when we can grill out?

Absolutally wonderful!!  I wasn't sure how it would turn out, but it was great. I didn't have red peppers, but turned out great without.  Also I didn't measure the cheese (could have been more or less), but wonderful.  Will definately make again!

We liked this one overall.  We added half of an onion instead of minced and eight brats instead of six b/c we had two pkgs of four.  We had to cook this dish for almost five hours before the potatoes were done but that's okay.

OK, lol...so I reallllly went out on a limb here...I had the brats but not potatoes but had some Walmart potato soup in the can.  Yes, I did the unthinkable!  I took the brats out of their casings in big chucks, fried it up & added 1 c chicken broth scraping up the bits.  Then added the can of soup, some dried onion, then some angel hair pasta.  OMGosh!  Amazing flavor!  Topped it with some shredded cheddar & voila!  Enough for a family of 6...have fun & experiment...that's what it's all about, right?

I don't like bratwurst. But I thought this would be good for a potluck and appeal to many, so I gave it a try. I think it turned out great! I don't like to review recipes that I've tinkered with, but I don't think what I did changed it appreciably, except for the cheese. I used turkey smoked sausage, fresh, chopped onions and a whole container of sliced mushrooms. I forgot to add the cheese, but I thought it was great without! Using the turkey sausage it probably could use more seasoning, but I'm not one for using a lot of seasoning, so I liked it fine! Thanks.

I loved this. It was really hearty and flavorful. Yes, it feels like you have a brick in your stomach if you eat too much, but this is comfort food, don't expect to feel like you ate a celery stick. =) I added a whole sautéed onion and 2 garlic cloves. I also had to add more than 2/3 cup water because it was a little to thick.

I had to change this to suit my family's taste but it was really good! I used cream of potato instead of cream of mushroom. I also used cheddar cheese soup and subbed corn for green beans. I still added the shredded cheese about 20 minutes before serving. Whole family loved it! Thanks for the starter! :-)

I substituted a few things, first we got spicy brats, fresh brussel sprouts, red bell pepper, jalapeño, and onion. I used a quarter cup of the chop onion and seeded the jalapeño and chop in small pieces. We also got frozen roasted red potatoes and a can of fiesta nacho cheese soup along with the cream mushroom soup and chicken broth to sub for water. I sautéed all the fresh ingredients and cup up brats then added everything in the crock. I'm also going to finish it off with some cup up crispy bacon when it's ready. It's not done cooking yet but I taste tested it and it's going to be amazing!

The potatoes need to be cut very small or it will take maybe 5-6 hours to cook through. Added a can of Campbell Cheese soup, en extra cup of shredded Gruyere cheese to thicken the sauce. I also replaced water with German  beer. Minced one shallot instead of the powder. Adding garlic won't hurt as well. Overall pretty good.  Next time I would cut the brats into even smaller pieces.

I wasn't too thrilled with this recipe.  I did eat a little bit.  My 6 yr old triplets either wouldn't touch it or took a bite and told me their tummy hurt (ie: I'm done).

Quite good.  The prep time was well worth the effort.  If you have a little extra time over a weekend, this is a great one to try.  I'm super-busy and go for the quick prep times, so this was a "maybe" for me at first, but now is a definite keeper.

Greeeeat! My husband asks me to make this all the time! I do add way way liquid though to make a larger batch. I also spice it up with hot sauce too. Wonderful and easy peasy :)

Pretty watery and SALTY!  Had to add milk to cut the salt.  Edible, but not a repeat.

This recipe was really good.  I did make some changes but not because I thought the recipe wasn't solid but because of our personal likes.  Here is what I did differently.  I added 1 can each of cream of celery soup, cream of potato soup and cheddar cheese soup.  I used one package of beef stock.  I sprinkled in some garlic powder and rosemary to taste. I added some broccoli and cauliflower and left out green beans.  I browned all veggies/lightly cooked all veggies before putting all together to help with cook time.  I did cook it in a regular pot rather than the crock and that was a mistake.  It was definitely better the second day and I think that's because it missed out on the blending that happens while cooking slowly together.  Crock pot it will be next time.

I loved the idea of this. Left out the bell pepper and subbed cheddar cheese soup for the mushroom soup. Cooked this on low in my Dutch oven on the stove. Added a little extra cheddar cheese at the end. Overall very good and filling. The green beans should not be left out, they really add to this.

This is a great meal! I will say that it takes longer than 3 hours to cook potatoes in the crock pot. Learned that the first time I made this. Second time, I just cooked on the lowest setting (10 hr) and everything was great. If you didn't want it to cook all day, you could probably boil the potatoes for a few minutes first. I also use 2 cans of the soup because just one can plus the water weren't enough. Also, I doubled the bratwursts to 12 because I buy the pre-cooked ones and 6 just isn't enough. Overall a great cheesy meal especially on cold days!

I made this for a family "soup-a-thon" and everyone raved!!  I doubled the recipe and cooked the onions with the brats! I think I may try this with shrimp and instead of cream of mushroom (which I used less fat and no one knew the difference), use cream of shrimp.....

I used fresh onions and corn instead of green beans.  My family said it was good and we ate it all, but they did not rave about it, so I only gave it 4 stars.  This is an easy way to use leftover brats.

I used Johnsonville Beer Brats, chicken stock for water, frozen green beans instead of canned, and left out the red pepper. Per other reviewers' recommendations, I also added a can of cheddar cheese soup, and added the shredded cheddar in the last 30 minutes of cooking. Cooked on low for more like 9 hours, while I was at work. My daughter (who is not a bratwurst fan) found it acceptable, and the SO said I could make it three times a week and he'd be happy. :)

Very yummy! Easy to put together, the worst part is having to smell it cooking for a few hours before you get to eat it! I left out the green beans though, I'm not a huge fan of them. :)

I've made this a few times and it's fantastic.  My husband especially loves this on cold days.  I have to make sure I cut my potatoes small enough though.  If they're too big, they take too long to cook.  Thanks for this one! It's a fall/winter staple in our house.

We thought it was good. With my crock-pot it was done in 4 hours. HOWEVER...I am a bratwurst purist, being from Wisconsin (in Arizona now)the only way to cook JOHNSONVILLE BRATS is to boil them in beer for about 20-25 minutes and then grill them until they are browned and crisp. Contrary to what some people say you do NOT prick them with a toothpick or fork first. I will make this again, but I'll use different sausages.

This was a great way to use up leftover brats. I didn't think there was enough moisture in the crock to make a stew, but the end result was what I thought was a perfect consistancy. I think the potatoes need longer/hotter cooking time: I gave it three and a half hours on high and thought they still needed some more. I also substituted cream of cheese for the mushroom soup and a can of beer for the water: being a native, it just seemed like the right thing to do and I really loved the extra-cheesy beer goodness. My boyfriend did find the flavors a little bland, though: red pepper flakes next time will probably do the trick. Thanks very much for sharing!

Good idea though i have to say i strayed a bit from the recipe by adding some leftovers. i added left over rice and broccoli. i didn't feel there was enough water to cook the potatoes so i added a cup instead of a third of a cup. It came out good though 3 hours was definitely NOT long enough to cook the potatoes. Even with the extra water, it took closer to 5 hours to get them tender!

Pretty good!  I left out the bell pepper and used 2 cans of cheddar cheese soup instead of the cream of mushroom per other reviews.  It came out cheesy and thick.  We use soft french bread to dip into.  Next time I think I might try flavored brats, like smoked, to give it more taste.  I will be making this again!

This turned out Awesome!! I used this recipe more for inspiration.  I used the basic ingredients but improvised with what I had on hand.    First I substituted cream of mushroom soup with cream of celery soup + 2 cans of water.  I used 1/2 a medium yellow onion & sauted a medium red pepper in 3 tbsp. of olive oil.  I used baked season french fries cubed instead of regular potatoes.  I used Italian Style Green beans & used only 3 grilled bratwurst.  Added 1 tbsp. of regular cream cheese, 1/4 cup of italian mix shredded cheese & used only 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese.  I had no problems with the cheese sticking, as my crockpot was on the low setting after the onions were clear.  After all ingredients were combined, cook for one hour or until red peppers are soft.    Goes great with crusty italian bread & beer.

Wow!!!!  I took others advice and used chedder cheese soup. Also I used a soup can of water and about 1/2 soup can of milk (to make it a little creamier). 
 I will admit.....When I got all of this in the crock pot I wasn't sure about it. It didn't look or smell good to me. 
 Let me tell ya something.....This by far is the BEST Brat stew ever!!!!
 My Hubby and 4 y/o LOVED it!!
 Next time I will double it though...It really doesn't make much...My family of 3 didn't have any leftovers!!

I thought this was awesome!  I made it on the stovetop instead of crock pot - as per other reviewer's suggestions, I boiled the potatoes about 10 minutes (until they were mostly cooked, but not entirely) while browning the sliced brat.  I drained the potatoes and threw them and everything else in the pot, plus a can of corn and a sprinkle of garlic & thyme, let it simmer over medium-low for about 10 minutes, then stirred in 12 oz of cubed Velveeta and simmered again until it all melted.  Dee-licious!

This recipe was extremely easy and for a cook all day, slow cooker recipe, was surprisingly good.  It's probably more appropriate during cold weather, but we enjoyed it nonetheless.  I did not use the red pepper, because we didn't have any on hand.  I recommend this as an easy, but tasteful recipe.

I've only recently started cooking in the crockpot, so I followed the recipe closely. After 3 hours, the potatoes were still quite hard, and the pepper and beans were mushy. As there was virtually no gravy, I added another can of soup. It came together in the end, but it was rather a lot of effort for pretty mediocre results. I can only imagine how it would have turned out if I'd left it unattended for 3 hours...

This is a good recipe, but my cheese turned it a bit too oily.  There were no complaints from anyone in my family, even my picky 9 year old.  My husband and I added some jalapeno slices and it gave it zing.

This was OK.  If I make this again, I will sub in beer for the water as one reviewer suggested.  It needed more flavor.

Awesome!  I used pre-cooked brats, so no need to brown them.  I also used 2 cans of soup and added some garlic.  I do agree with other posts that 3 hours is NOT long enough - I did 5 hours on high and it worked out great.

This stew was so much better than I thought it would be!  But I had to make the following modifications (not because I wanted to, but because it's what I had on hand):
Cream of Mushroom soup with garlic (instead of regular cream of mushroom)
5 smoked brauts and 4 slices of bacon (both browned)
1 bag frozen green beans (no bell pepper)
1.5 cups cheddar cheese (instead of 2)
About an house before it finished cooking, I added another can cream of mushroom soup and some water - and I am glad that I did!  It was really creamy.  I also cooked it for 6 hours instead of 3 (mostly on low, but about 2 hours on high).  We ate the soup with bread.  I was a little worried that my 4 year old wouldn't go for the garlic (because garlic cream of mushroom soup just doesn't taste as good as real garlic) but she liked it!

I don't know what this officially tastes like cooked according to the recipe, but I think that I'll make it again and not be afraid to add whatever I have available - just like I did today.

This was absolutely awful.  My husband, who usually compliments - and eat - everything I make, came right out and said this was horrible and asked me to go out to dinner with him instead.  I think there were too many onions which gave it a strange, unpleasant type of 'fragrance'. Normally, fried or sauteed onions smell and taste good, but the slow-cooked ones just end up stinking.  Sorry I couldn't give a better review. I'm glad some of you enjoyed this dish.

I had purchased the ingredients for this and did not have time to get it in the crock pot, so I fixed it on the stove top.  Wonderful flavor! I par-boiled the potatoes prior to adding them to the rest of the ingredients, did not drain the green beans and substituted milk for the water. It was done in less than an hour on the stove top.  Thanks.

A stick-to-the-ribs  use for brats when the grill is snowed in.  I sautéed some fresh onion with them while they browned, used Trader Joe’s condensed mushroom soup, fresh green beans and a about fourth of a yellow bell pepper.  I reserved some of the cheese for people to sprinkle on top of their own servings. Very happy that I could return from errands to a dinner  that smelled great and the men of the house had no complaints about! (Cooked on high 3 hours)

Instead of brats,  I used beef hot links (I did not brown them) and nixed the red pepper because the links were spicy. Also, instead of 2/3 cup of water, I just added a can of water.
So the prep time was less than 10 minutes.

Because I only have two settings on my cooker, I set it to high for 2 hours 45 minutes; most of the ingredients were already pare cooked to begin with.  

I made some garlic bread with it and it made a great meal!! It was delicious!!!


Note: I always cook the day before so the sauces can thicken and the flavor can steep

I changed a few things, but just to adhere to my diet and taste, not because I think it needed to be changed.
Replaced potatoes with cauliflower, water with low sodium chicken broth, and cheddar soup in place of mushroom. I also didn't have the dried onion soup I used fresh, chopped, and sautéed it while I browned the bratts. We all loved it, next time I'm going to try adding some fresh garlic just because we love garlic!

I've made this a few times in the last two months and decided I really enjoy it. I made some slight changes. I chopped a fresh onion instead of a minced dried one and I added a can of black beans.

I found this to be a great recipe. I did add the can of cheese soup as others have suggested and of course substituted beer for the 2/3 cup of water. A nice hearty meal for the slow cooker, excellent over some large yeast rolls.

Didn't follow the recipe exactly as I don't like bell peppers and hubby will not eat green beans. The rest of the recipe gives you a great base to make your own soup. We had some onions which I saute in garlic, threw in some carrots and use cheesy brats but you can use whatever you want.

This stew was very easy, and it was very delicious.  I doubled the recipe and made a few changes.  I used a can of mushroom and a can of cheese.  Also, instead of water, I used half dark beer and half beef broth.  I substituted carrots for the green beans and used fresh onion.  I used red potatoes and left the skin on.  Finally, I added a jalapeno.  As other reviewers suggested, I added the shredded cheddar at the end.  I let it cook on high for about six hours, and it was perfect.  Rave reviews.

This was obviously not as good for me as it was for some...  This took alot longer than the recipe stated and ended up cooking something else for lunch.  To top it all off, it wasn't great or really even very good.  It was more of a soup than a stew and didn't have much flavor.  If you make this, do yourself a favor and either make it on the stove top if you want it done within the 3 hour time frame as suggested in the recipe.  Also, if using canned green beans and shredded cheese, don't add until towards the end of the cooking time.

I wanted a brat recipe that was different from the traditional beer n brats and saw this.  I think it is an awesome start to a great recipe.  I read all the reviews and tips that everyone had left before I made this and ended up with something wonderful....a crowd pleaser!  For starters many people commented that the potatoes were uncooked after three hours.  Since I didn't have anything but canned/diced potatoes I used 2 cans and they were perfect.  I broiled 8 brats and cut them into small bites as suggested.  It was also noted that in some cases the stew was too greasy. For this I used one can of cheese soup and two cans of cream of mushroom.  30 min prior to eating I added one cup of shredded cheddar.  It was not soupy or greasy at all and had a wonderfully cheesy taste. (I wonder if some people had greasiness because of poor quality brats.) I used a teaspoon of minced garlic, 1 whole onion, and 1 red pepper sauteed together prior to adding to the stew. I used one can of green beans, 1 cup of frozen corn and it was suggested that I add broccoli however, I had none on hand.  I am so glad there are left overs!!!!

Not for our taste I should say but I also used beer instead of water maybe that is why. Could of had a different taste if I followed the directions that is why I am giving it 3 stars

This was a great stew. My husband loves it and that's saying something. I, like a couple other reviewers add the cheese at the end, much better that way. Also I had some mushrooms(canned or fresh) which ever I have and a little curry powder. What good flavor! Thanks for the recipe.

This was very good, everyone liked it. 
I also waited until before serving to put in the cheese and I used 1/2 cheddar and 1/2 velveeta.
I substituted the green beans for corn only because everyone likes corn at my house. 
I used red baby potatoes and didn't have a problem with them being done when we were ready to eat.

This did not turn out like a stew at all.  I followed recipe exactly except for the fact I turned my crock pot on high, and even after 4 1/2 hours the potatoes were still a little crunchy.  The consistency was thin and very greasy from the brats.  I won't cook this again.

It was actually really good.  I stated making it before I read the reviews, then I started tweaking with it.  I used (instead of regular brats) Cheese flavored ones.  I realized that I didn't any cans of green beans, so I used a bag of frozen one.  I didn't have any red bell peppers, so I just substituted a green one, and I also added a pound of Velveeta and it seemed to thicken it up alot more than I thought it would.

This didn't quite turn out the way I had envisioned it in my head when I printed out the recipe. I thought it was going to be thick and cheesy, and it actually turned out kind of thin, and the cheese separated into little globs instead of just melting into the stew. I think I'll make it again, but I'll follow the suggestions in other reviews and use Velveeta instead of cheddar. Other than the fact that I had assumed it would look different, this one was pretty good. A little playing and tweaking and it could become "a regular."

My husband and son RELLY liked this.  I used beer brats, and replaced the water with beer.  (ny husband likes beer)  I actually used probably a whole beer, adding while it cooked.  I will make it again, but probably use velveeta so it's not a oily.

My husband enjoyed this, I didn't care for it at all.  I par boiled the potatoes and they got really mushy. Next time, if my husband asks me to make it again, I won't par boil the potatoes.

This was easy to make and very tasty but it was incredibly rich.  My boyfriend and I could only eat a little bit.  The next day when I warmed it I added more water and a can of evaporated milk to cut down on the thickness and that helped a lot.  I will make this again but I will remember to thin it a bit.
EDIT: I made this again with quite a few changes and it was delicious. I browned the potatoes, kielbasa, half a chopped onion, a green pepper and a teaspoon of minced garlic before throwing everything in the crockpot. I added enough homemade chicken stock to cover and cooked on high for 3 hours or until the potatoes were tender. When the potatoes were done, I made a basic cheese sauce with butter, flour, milk, broth from the crockpot and lots of cheese which was added to the soup. I seasoned to taste with lots of black pepper and the result was a non greasy, delicious stew that had plenty of rich, thick broth. Forget the canned soups and you won't be sorry.

This was really good. I just changed a few things to suit our tastes. I used fresh onion, that I chopped and sauteed in a little bit of beer. Then I just used a small jar of roasted red bell peppers, since I didnt have fresh. And left out the green beans, just didnt seeem important to me. Didnt have cream of mushroom, so I used cream of chicken instead. But would also try it with cheddar cheese soup. It was a little greasy, so I just skimmed it. Maybe using velveeta instead will help. Also replaced the water with beer, and just used the whole can, because I felt it need more sauce. I did need more than 3 hours to get the potatoes soft, but that was fine, 3 hours for a crock pot meal is pretty short. We had ours in sourdough bread bowls, with a cold beer, GREAT combination, and watched Ohio state beat Oklahoma! It was a great football meal. I will make this for superbowl.

This was a gender-specific stew: the men loved it, the women hated it. I cooked the brats first in beer, & should have listened to another's advice & cooked the potatoes first. They were NOT done! Probably won't make this again unless the guys ask for their own batch.

Wow, this was even better than I expected, and I already thought it would be good!  We did boil the brats in beer before putting them in the crock pot.  I also boiled the potatoes just a bit.  We then added 1/2 a can of beer to the crock pot.  Cooked for about 4 1/2 hours and it was perfect - very, very good!

Potatoes need to be diced fairly small to cook in 3 hours.  (Mine took longer.)  Didn't have brats, so used coarse ground hot dogs.  No complaints from my family.

we thought this recipe was very good.  The base tasted like scalloped potatoes.  ours was not greasy at all, however i did pre cook the potatoes because i've never had them get done in 3 hours in the crock pot.  we had left over brats from camping, and this was an excellent idea.

The potatoes do not cook in the slow cooker in 3 hours.  I waited until they were soft (approx 6 hours on low) and the soup and the fat from the sausage mixed to make a very greesy base.  The potatoes need to be boiled first before going into the slow cooker.

I only had 4 brats, and I used unpeeled chopped redskins (which I boiled for about 10 minutes before adding to the slow cooker).  My husband grated the cheese, so some extra might have accidentally found it's way into this dish.  This was NOT greasy.  Ours came out nice and creamy.  I'll make this dish again.

This stew may seem pretty basic but when you have been out all day, it is a good meal to come home to. Great with rolls!! Seemed slightly salty due to the sausage, but not overpowering.

Made this did  not have all the ingredients for this but it was still good but next time I make this will definitely have to make sure that I have all the ingredients for this but I think I will double the amount of sausage or maybe just add so ground sausage and put it over rice .  I think that's sounds really good right now

My mother originally got this recipe from a package of brats about 30 years ago and it is a family favorite. This recipe is not exactly the same but quite similar. Here are the differences: Use 1 cup diced Velveeta cheese, 1 can cream of chicken soup, 1 cup water, 1/2 pkg. frozen French cut green beans (added during the last 10 min).

I used shredded carrots instead of green beans and added a jalapeno and habanero pepper finely minced for a beautiful kick.  A gift to single dads everywhere (and the kids they feed).

I had all the ingredients on hand for this so I decided to give it a try.  I only had 1 lb (3 links) of chicken brats and I still needed to add another 1 1/2 cups of chicken stock to have enough liquid to accommodate all the ingredients.  I used a combination of half cheddar and half  Velveeta to produce a better consistency and steamed the cubed potatoes in to microwave for 5 mins first.  Overall this is cold weather comfort food, but I thought I lacked a lot in the flavor department.

I made it and it turned out just as described.  I live alone so it provided me with dinners for some time.  it was very easy and didn't require much work.  I am not sure I will try it again as there are so many other slow cooker recipes to try.   This one is just one of the many.  I liked it and I had the all the ingredients in the cupboard.

I was no to impressed with this recipe.  I have made several recipes from this app although this is the first one I did not like. I guess I will stick to beer brats on the good old grill.

I did not read the reviews before I made this for a church fellowship.  I will make this again, but next time I think I will  precook the potatoes.  I, myself, thought it was salty, but I don't usually eat salt.  Everyone else who had it said it was good.  I look forward to trying this again.

It was okay. It was pretty runny and the potatoes were not done. I also added extra bratwurst and it was a little overkill.  If I make this again, I'll be tweaking it.

This was excellent with all the changes suggested by other reviewers. I added a can of corn, can of cheddar cheese soup, half bottle of beer, can of beef broth instead of the water, a few dabs of hot sauce, sprinkled some red pepper flakes. Onion powder only because I personally hate real onions. Added half the cheese for the last half hour and sprinkled some cheese on top of the soup itself before serving. Cooked on high for 4 hours. It was even better the next day and I'll be making it with my additions often. Husband approved too.

I've made this twice now and it's been great. I did add 2 cans of soup and milk instead of water though. One can wasn't going to be enough to cover everything. I used cream of chicken and broccoli and cheese soup. Was great and got rave reviews

Good recipe. I did make some changes, increased the potatoes to 6 and then small diced them so they would cook faster. I used green bell pepper along with the red. Fresh onion instead of dried and used hillshire farms smoked cheesy brats. I also added some chicken bouillon to bring out more flavor and increased the amount of liquid so that everything was just barely covered. In all this was a nice chunky soup with nice cheesy flavor that I would make again because the whole family loved it, you know it's a hit when a picky 2 year old asks for more.

Yummy! Warning-this is heavy. I could only eat a little of it-but that may have something to do with the witches hat cookies I made!  I have a small slow cooker, so I followed the recipe except I only used 2 potatoes, used onion powder instead of minced, and I put in an extra can of cheddar cheese soup. I put it in at 830am on low and we ate at about 5.  Added the cheese maybe 10 minutes before we ate. It was pretty thick-I added about 2/3 cup water and may add more.  Delicious-even my 8 year old who hates soup and stew liked it.  It is a little salty with 2 canned soups-fortunately I like salt.

I forgot to get onions and replaced the ingredient with minced garlic. It came out really well, though I expected it to be a little thicker than I ended up. Left overs got mixed with pasta for a really nice meal :)

I made this wonderful stew today.  I put in the slow cooker at 9am, left came home at 5pm added the cheese...mmm delicious. Thank you for sharing, will make this time and time again. The potatoes were cooked not mushy but husband likes em more tender so next time Ill make the cubes more smaller. I changed nothing in the recipe followed every step except adding the cheese before I dishes out this delicious stew. So flavorful, being fourth of July weekend original johnsville brats were gone so substitute with the cheddar brats still great. Picture is what was left....not much we enjoyed bowl fulls

This turned out amazing and my husband and 4 year old loved it! I omitted the red pepper and beans and used 2 cans of cream of chicken instead of mushroom. I simmered the brats in half a bottle of Uinta Golden Spike Hefeweizen then dumped the rest of the bottle in the final mix instead of water. This was the perfect meal for a cold snowy evening and I will definitely make it again. :)

This recipe was great! My husband and I both love it. The only changes I made were that I put it all in the crockpot and cooked it on low for 6 hours. Also I left the skin on the potatoes. And I added about 3/4 cup of chicken broth for extra flavor and so that it would have a bit more liquid.

Turned out pretty good!  Made a few modifications I added chopped carrots, canned corn & celery.  Used a carton of WI cheese soup instead of shredded cheese.  Used additional spices/seasoning & added bacon pieces/bits.  Mixed all together in the crockpot and let it go all afternoon.  My 2 yr old LOVES it!  I did add 1 c of mexican shredded cheese and 1 cup mozzarella at the end just to give it some more cheesy flavor.  Overall really good.

Made it once.  Made it twice.  We keep making it again and again!  This is now a family favorite!  Even my kids like it!  Only thing we changed was waiting until like 30 minutes before soup is done to add our cheese!  SOOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOD!

I have not made this yet but I can tell from reading it that it will be delicious. I would, however, substitute Progresso Cream of Mushroom soup for the condensed soup and water. I've done this with green bean casserole and the difference in flavor was amazing.

This is my husband's new favorite food.  The only thing I've had difficulty with is the green beans--no matter how much I stir, they always sink to the bottom of the crock pot and stick to the sides.  Next time I'll add them at the end or omit them.

This was a GREAT starter recipe.  I read the reviews first and took some of the tips.  I used Velveeta in the last 30 minutes in place of the shredded cheddar. Also used one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cheddar cheese soup. I cooked the brats ahead of time and par boiled the potatoes before adding them.  It was thick and YUMMY!!!!  I'll be making this one again for sure.

Requires more cooking time.  At least 6 hours on low, 4-5 hours on high.  I left the skins on the potatoes.  Giving it four stars, because it is pretty bland.  Add some spice if you are making it.

I thought this was just ok.  I probably wouldn't make it again though.

Very good soup for a chilly fall day.  I made some minor tweeks and was very pleased with the outcome: Browned and almost fully cooked bratwurst then sliced; browned about 1/4-1/2 cup each chopped onion, celery, and carrots in 2 tbsp. butter, then added the mushroom soup, one can chix broth, and about one cup milk.  Added my very small-ly cubed potatoes and bratwurst; then added some pasturized processed cheese slices and some real cheddar.  Boiled all for about one hour (didn't use crock pot).  Turned out great!!

This is great football food!  We have made it several times and guests always rave over it.  I tend to boil the potatoes until they are half done instead.  Otherwise it takes nearly 6 hours in the crockpot.

A little bland. I took some of the previous reviewers advice and added garlic as well and the corn, I didn't put the full 2 cups of cheese.  Will make again, but need to come up with a way to give it more flavour.

I will admit like some other reviewers that I varied from the recipe.  I added plenty of extra ingredients and made it my own.  I am quite thankful for the general idea though and that it gave me a base to be creative.

Family loved it. I did not have time to make in the slow cooker, so I just made it on my stovetop. I also have no idea how much cheese I really added. I used fresh onion, and sauted with brats and drained grease before adding rest if ingredients. My husband was leary at first, but had thirds. It was a hit, will definately make again.

My husband & I really enjoyed this! Being from Wisconsin, we figured we couldn't go wrong with brats & cheese! Haha. I didn't add the red pepper as I didn't have any & I substituted the beans for corn. I rated it 4 stars because I would probably make changes next time; i.e. cut down on the brats used, add a can of cheese soup, use chopped onions & cook on low for a few hours more so the potatoes get a little more done.

Very good recipe.  Great for cold weather.  I changed a few things around (because I can't NOT change things around).  I added a cup of milk as well as about a cloves worth of minced garlic.  I substituted red potatoes for russets and it really kicked the color up a bit.  All in all, a very good recipe.

Our family really liked this, and I made it on the stovetop in about 40 mins.  I peeled and cubed the potatoes and nuked them for six minutes.  While they were cooking, I removed the brats from their casings and browned them with the onions.  I, too, used frozen green beans instead of canned and beer instead of water.  Since I didn't have a pepper, I added a few dashes of Tabasco -- just enough for zip.  Brought it all to a slow bubble before I added the cheese.  A yummy, family-friendly Fall supper.

This was very good. I did as others had suggested and used cheddar cheese soup in place of the shredded cheese. I also used a spicy bratwurst, which gave it a lot of flavor. Oh, and I did precook the potatoes a little too make sure they would be done in 3 hours. Will make again!!

We loved it!!!  Yummy Yummy.  I used  cheddar cheese soup and some velveeta instead of what the recipe called for the cheese part.  I also added just a little corn starch to thicken it up just a bit.  I put it on high in the crockpot for 3 hours and it was ready.  I had no problem with my potatoes, they were done perfectly in 3hrs.  I cut them up in small cubes.  Thank you for a great recipe.

It was a four star recipe until the next day, when the leftovers reheated to be just as good as the day before! I followed the other reviewers in using frozen hashbrowns instead of fresh potatoes (3.5 cups). I put in 1/3 c more water and about a dozen sliced fresh mushrooms, and only added the cheese in the last half hour, but otherwise left the recipe as was. Wonderful! Thank you!!

My husband and I completely disagree on almost all food.  He doesn't like any soups or stews or pot roasts of any kind.  Now we  agree on one item, this stew!!  I thought I would try it on him because it contains two of his favorite items, cheese and brats.  I added a little corn and carrots for me because I like veggies.  Put it all in the crock pot and forgot about it.  I loved it, he loved it and my in laws loved it, I had nothing left.  I will be adding this to my weekly list of dinners!  Thank you soooo much!

This turned out pretty well but took quite a while for the potatoes to soften.  I turned the crockpot up to high for a couple of hours and then reduced it to low for 4 more hours.  I also made a few other changes.  Removed the casings from the brats and added a diced onion while browning.  Also added a soup can full of water rather than 2/3 c, didn't drain the green beans and still worried about not having enough liquid.  So during the last hour of cooking I added about 1/2 c milk.  Just before serving I added the cheddar and it turned out great.  Not greasy at all...and pretty thick.  Definitely stew-like.  I don't think I'll rush to make it again but we all thought it was pretty good.

I orginally got this recipe when we lived in Wisconsin and lost it in a move. My family loved it so much that there was never any leftovers!The only change that I make is to leave out the red bell pepper. It sooo good to have it back and enjoy it yet again. Especially this winter!! LindaK

We enjoyed this stew.  My rating isn't entirely fair, since I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  Based on other reviews, I browned a whole chopped onion and the chopped potatoes along with the brats in a little olive oil.  I feel like this brought out extra flavor in the vegetables, but I can't say for sure since I didn't try it without.  I also used cheese soup in place of the cheddar and cream of onion soup instead of cream of mushroom (I don't like cream of mushroom much.)  I added 1/2 bottle of dark beer instead of the water.  And I added the red pepper and green beans (about 8 oz. frozen, not canned)in for the last 30 minutes of cooking so they wouldn't get soggy.  With these changes, we thought it was very good.  It still could have used a little extra flavor - maybe some cheddar cheese stirred in at the end, or some hot sauce, or some garlic sauteed with the potatoes and onions?

This is a great basic recipe.  Like others, I made some modifications.  I used 1/2 bag of frozen hash browns and omitted the red pepper (doesn't fly with the kiddie).  From experience I didn't want cheese lumps, so I didn't use shredded cheddar cheese and instead used one can of Campbell's cheddar cheese soup. I also substituted 'reduced sodium' cream of chicken soup to cut back on the salt.  Also, if your soup isn't thick enough, try adding instant mashed potato flakes a bit at a time to thicken it up.  This soup with the modifications is such a hit in our house that I make it every other week.  It's pretty frugal too since you can buy the brats in bulk or on sale.

My husband LOVES this. I've made it a couple of times now, at his request. He rarely asks for anything, so he must really like this!

I rated in four stars only because I changed so many elements - and there is no 4.5 rating :-).

After reading the other reviews, I used sliced Velveeta, boiled the potatoes before peeling them, and cooked the stew in a pot on my stove. 

This last time, I did not have enough brats, so I used half brats and half mild Italian sausage. I took them out of their cases, chopped them up and precooked them. I did not have a pepper, so I skipped it. I chopped some onion and added it (instead of minced dried onion) to give the stew texture. Simmered all for an hour and voila. (I forgot to wait to add the cheese, but even that turned out fine, thanks to the magic of whatever Velveeta really is :-). )

Wow!  Everyone loved this with only minor modifications.  Sorry -- it's a bad habit of mine to tweak things as I make them.  I didn't add the cheese until the end of cooking time and I probably used 3/4 cup. shredded sharp cheddar.  I cooked the bratwurst, sliced them, and put them in the crockpot with diced onion, some chopped frozen tri-color peppers slices, fresh garlic, the green beans, a can of chicken mushroom soup, and the potatoes.  As it was cooking, I was afraid that it looked a little bland so I added fresh baby carrots.  My son tasted it and said it tasted good, but I knew I needed to do something about the seasoning.  I added about 1/2 jar of banana pepper rings and that seemed to do it.  My husband loved it and said I could probably add even more veggies. Served it with bread from my bread machine and it was a hit.  I will definitely make it again.

Was excited to use this as a new way to use leftover already-grilled brats, so I didn't have the grease issue - however, it was VERY thin, even after I added quite a bit of Velveeta - more like a soup than a stew.  Used beer instead of water, but it still needed some oomph, so I drained some tomatoes and chilies and added those.  That helped quite a bit.  Husband and I did a no-no and mixed starches - served this over rice, and it wasn't too bad, but I doubt I'll make it again.  Would rather just warm up the brats and make some cheese fries.

This was really tasty!  We added fresh mushrooms, which were good, but then it became a little soupy, so I think we won't add as much liquid next time.  Good flavor though!

A very good and easy recipe.  If you crave a German-tasting dish, then I recommend cooking this one.

Coming from the bratwurst capital, we used ground bratwurst, and it was a big hit at the family gathering.  We will make it again....and again.  Thank you

In all fairness, I think, like some other reviewers suggested, if I'd have used Velveeta or (even better) cheese soup, it would have turned out better.  And SIX brats!!  You're brats must be the size of Little Smokies!  Three - tops.  I might try to make this again using our left-over grilled brats.  That should cut down significantly on the grease factor.

The brats were good (bc they're brats!) and the potatoes were okay (I did boil them first), but the rest of the stew was only so-so.  My husband (who is from the midwest, and maybe that matters) rated it a four, but I probably won't be making this again.  If I want brats, I may just stick to having them on buns!

I was all set to make this and then -BAM- I didn't have all the ingredients. So this is how I made it:
I only used 1-1/2 potatoes
I used 115 grams of Velveeta
no red pepper, although that is a shame (mine had to be tossed)
Campbell's Pepper Jack soup
fresh onion
1 can of corn (I didn't have gr. beans - thought I did)
instead of bratwursts, I used Bratos (pork & tofu) 

This is fabulous - really, really good. I browned the Bratos in a skillet and then put them in a saucepan (did I mention I didn't use a crock pot). Then I put the water in the hot skillet to get the browned bits from the brats. Honestly, it was by and large the same recipe! Very flexible. I served it with Irish soda bread.

Great hearty soup recipe.  I would suggest precooking the potatoes before.

This was very good! Next time I will use cheddar chees soup instead of the cream of mushroom. It could be cheesier.

Good concept overall.  I like the whole flavoring, but I wish it had a kick of some sorts.  Definitely a repeat recipe, however.  I recommend boiling the sliced brats in beer until evaporated.

This recipe was only average. It wasn't good enough to become a permanent part of our recipe box, but we finished it. It just needs some sort of kick.

I make a recipe that's almost identical to this on the stovetop, except that it calls for kielbasa and omits the cheddar cheese.   It hadn't occured to me to throw it in the crockpot, but I'll try it- thanks!

Excellent recipe for a quick meal.  We like cheese so we added an extra 1/2 cup to the recipe.
