I used to make this dip a long time ago and lost the recipe. THANK GOD Ingrid submitted it here!  I do one thing different which is very good as well.  I do not cook the ingredients.  I add everything in a bowl and let it sit overnight (much better the next day). I also do not add the picante sauce when I do it this way. TRUST ME this is a winner!  I brought it to a Holiday party and it was the first thing gone and everyone asked me for the recipe.  I will have to try it Ingrids way of cooking the ingredients but I am so happy with the way I make it by keeping everything fresh.  It's delicious!

Easy to prepare and a nice taste. I used 1 Cup of med. salsa instead of the picante sauce and tomatoes.  I also used cheese with jalapenos for more kick!

This is so good!  I've made it several times with a few variations.  I used homemade beans; either black beans or black-eyed peas or a combination of each.  I used raw purple onion and chunky salsa in place of the picante sauce.  Rather than the cumin & chili powder, I used homemade taco seasoning mix - also from this website.  We've tried it with and without cheese, warm and cold.  It is wonderful any way it is served.

Very tasty.

I made these changes but these are my personal preference.

I added 1/4 teaspoon salt (only because the tortilla chips i used have salt on them, otherwise add more salt) and 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

I used a little over half a cup pace picante medium salsa.

I also mashed the beans more than half-way through because thats how i like them.

I followed the recipe exactly how written other than the changes above.

Also, do not add the lime juice, cheese and cilantro until ready to serve. Very important.

I will keep this recipe

This is so good. I used Southwestern Black Beans and Hot Pepper Cheese. It was so good that it was hard to put away but I had to, this recipe makes so much.

This is the best bean dip recipe I have found.    Best if served and eaten while still warm.

This was AMAZING.  It also made a fabulous enchilada filling.  I adjusted the recipe a little.  I had a giant 32oz can of beans, so I used that, an entire can of corn, and a jar of spicy organic black bean and corn salsa.  I had some chipotle chili powder and that added a nice smoky flavor.  I used one of those bags of 'Mexican Blend' cheeses and I added extra cheese, but it was delicious without the cheese.  It also makes a really filling meal served over rice and it makes great quesadillas.

Wow - this is yummy!  I used no oil and added a little extra reduced fat Mexican cheese, and extra cilantro and lime juice.  As a result, mine was probably a little runnier (and also, my can of black beans had more water than beans!  I was thinking of adding more beans, since once I drained the liquid, there was less than 1/2 the can of actual beans, but didn't).  This dip is refreshing and very flavorful!  Oh, funny - now that I went back to read the recipe, I didn't follow directions at all - ha.  I didn't cook anything - just blended all the raw ingredients together, and it was still good!  I'll try following directions the next time to see if it's even better. :)

This rocks.  I didn't have any fresh (or frozen corn), though, and I took a risk... I substituted with creamed corn.  It was awesome!  I added jalepenos and hot sauce to balance the sweetness of the corn.  Good stuff!

so good.  be sure to serve hot.  Once it gets cool it's hard to dip tortilla chips.

This was yummy and fast.  I went to the cupboard to get some refried beans and found I was out.  But black beans I had.  So I made this up to go into tacos.  It was GREAT!

Very tasty. Very good! I roll it up in taco sized flour tortillas to make mini burritos...about 30 of them...bake at 425, 7 min. each side. They get nice and crispy on the outside. I freeze some (already cooked), let thaw, and cook in toaster oven at 350, about 5 min. each side. Easy, super yummy, homemade convenience food.

Good, but needed a bit of livening up. I would add a touch of salt, use a medium picante rather than mild and add a bit of the lime zest. Best served warm for sure, but easy to heat up gently in the microwave if needed. This is a versatile dip that also makes a great filling for tortillas or taco shells.

I tripled this recipe, and it still worked well. It was delicious! I made it for a "dish to pass" wedding and it was LITERALLY the first thing to go.

I wanted a smoother dip, so I threw everything in a blender to puree before simmering the mixture. For a spicier version, use hot salsa instead of picante, add a chopped jalapeno, and add a few dashes of hot sauce. The blended version kills the heat, so you might have to add a lot!

This was a very good dip, and a great choice for a low glycemic index diet (though you need an alternative to corn chips to dip).

A big hit with both kids and adults. To make it healthier, I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and I halved the cheese to 1/4 cup. The dip was just the right amount of creamy vs. chunky.   To make it spicier, I added a dash of cayenne pepper and I used pepper jack cheese instead of Monterey Jack.  The dip was even better the next day (more flavorful), so next time I think I'll make it a day in advance and keep it in the fridge overnight.

I've made this dip so many times now and it never disappoints! I absolutely love it. I always get compliments on it as well. 
I follow the recipe exact, however I never use the full amount of cheese. I find about 1/8 cup or less to be enough.

Yummy!  Have used this occasionally for supper.  All pantry ingredients, at least after I made some substitutions.  Used canned tomatoes, salsa, frozen corn, and left off the cilantro (though I'm sure that would make it even better, I just don't usually have it on hand).  Healthy and delicious!

This is good!  I only had 1/4 cup of onion and added about 1/4 cup of yellow bell pepper that needed to be used.  I used hot salsa instead of the tomatoes and picante sauce and pepperjack for the cheese.  Add a big dollup of sour cream and eat it with blue corn tortilla chips.

Super easy and delicious!  I wanted to make a dip but only wanted to use what I had on hand.  So, I had to skip the corn and cilantro.  Also, I didn't have picante sauce, so I threw in an 8 oz can of tomato sauce and some green Tabasco sauce, and it worked out perfectly!  I ended up adding in more Tabasco and more cumin.  It's delicious!

Solid recipe just not our thing I guess. I think the corn throws it off and I almost left it out but didn't want to rate the recipe with a big change like that. I did use pepper jack cheese instead of monterey jack to spice it up a bit, but it was still just so-so. Some of my guests enjoyed this dip, but my hubby really didn't like it so I'll probably not make this one again. Oh well, I love black beans so back to the drawing board for me!

I should also add that I used black beans made from scratch.  I didn't use canned.  That might also make a difference.  Still an awesome recipe!

Super easy and super tasty.  I don't follow the recipe exactly, but you can add and subtract what you want for a great dip.

Great recipe! This is definitely a chunkier bean dip, though, so I instead of using chips to dip, I spread it on a tortilla and made a lunch outof out. I didn't have any picante, so I pureed a can of tomatos w/ green chiles and used that instead, seemed to work fine. We do like ours a little spicier though, and will probably saute with a ltitle more garlic and add more cumin.

Loved this dip...served at Fiesta Party for friends in Florida along with one of their favorites some homemade guacamole. Don't know which they liked the most.  Like AMIRIS12000, I did not cook ingredients.  I used frozen corn, so thawed it before adding.  I DID add the picante sauce and let it sit over night.  I didn't add the cheese until party time and then I heated until warm in the microwave.  No one seemed to care if it was warm or had cooled.  Will share recipe and serve again.

Excellent bean dip, amenable to variations.  I usually make it without the cheese and use it for pack lunches.

Absolutely delicious and so easy!  I altered a bit by omitting the picante, cheese and lime, and using a 15 oz. can of diced tomatoes in place of the chopped tomatoes and a bit of dried cilantro in place of fresh.  I served it warm with homemade whole wheat garlic pita chips.  I will definitely make this again.

Am I the only one who followed the recipe exactly?  I think so. I love all of the creativity the members share with tweeks they come up with!  I will try some of them in the future but for now this was a hit as is. I did have to take some out for myself before adding any cilantro as I am allergic to it.

My family loves this! I keep the black beans whole and use a can of diced tomatoes with green chilis (store brand rotel). Instead of picante sauce I substituted a 1/2 cup of salsa. Have used both canned and frozen corn with good results. Ingredients don't have to be exact-this is a very forgiving recipe.  Perfect for a party or potluck!

This is absolutely fabulouse and people are crazy about it.
This is now one of my treasure recipes and I have made it 4 times.
I didn’t cook the ingredients.
I used 3 cloves of garlic and 2 Tablespoons of lime juice.
I used canned corn.
Best made the day before so the flavors can meld.

Pretty good and easy to make. I think I will put the cheese on top next time along with some extra cilantro...it sort of gets lost in the mix. Also think I will serve in a crock pot next time.

Delicious!!  Very easy recipe to play around with.  I added chicken broth and a little liquid smoke to simmer.  I also used rotel for the tomatoes and then a 2nd can of beans.  Also, pepper jack cheese.  Spicy, but SO flavorful and great texture.  FUN recipe!  Get creative!

Yummy and my husband loved it as well.  He says it on his top list of dips, just about as good as the good ole' 7 layer dip.  My only suggestion to all is to use spices to your tasting and not necessarily follow just what is listed here.   I sauted onions, garlix etc., but I also added onion powder, garlic powder etc.   I like my stuff more flavorful and this just needs a small boost more of taste.    I used organic black beans and it was wonderful.    I would Highly reccommend having a side of sour cream.  Get your tortilla chip, swooooooop up the black bean dip and then add a dollop of sour cream   :-)    ha ha- but yum yum   ya mon- jamiacan style.

Another hit. I took this to a large Christmas party and almost everyone asked for the recipe. I personally like things a bit spicer, but this was perfect for a large group of people with a variety of heat tolerance. It just has a great flavor to it.

Everyone at the table enjoyed this dip!  I was told I must make it again.  I cooked dried beans instead of using canned and I used Velveeta pepper jack for the cheese.

Yummy and refreshing.  I skipped the oil and onions.  Blended all other ingredients (along with a tsp of salt) and topped with more cilantro as a garnish.  Didn't cook a thing.

This is a great recipe!!  I add a cup of salsa (Jack's) instead of picante sauce.  We also add a little hot sauce or canned jalapenos....HOT!  I love it stuffed in a tortilla!!  Great tasting, fast recipe.  I recommend keeping the items on hand for a quick dip for guests!

Took this dip to a dinner party just last night -- everyone gobbled it up!  I had to add about double the picante sauce as it was cooking because it got so thick, and because the picante already had cilantro in it, I didn't add any more.  Turned out just right.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow!  I really enjoyed making this, and eating it, too! It was so easy.  I thought about using the tip from one woman who made it ahead and didn't cook it, but I actually didn't have time.  I made it just before the party, mostly as the original recipe called for except that I "nuked" frozen organic corn instead of fresh corn and used a pre-packaged cilantro paste I found at ACME, and the dip was so delicious!  I can't wait to make it for Christmas.

It was great even though I omitted the corn, tomatoes, and cilantro because I didn't have any. It disappeared in seconds at my dinner party!

I made it the fresh, not cooked way and used 2 teaspoons homemade taco seasoning, green onion and chipotle salsa, no raw tomatoes, no raw garlic, and BAM!, fresh and tasty!  No need to let it sit overnight.

This also comes out great using dried beans that have been prepared ahead of time, using cheddar instead of jack cheese.  I also place it in a small crock pot to keep it warm when serving at parties.

Made the recipe as written.  Put it in flour tortillas then rolled and chilled them to cut later into pinwheels as snacks.  Tasted great.

Good flavor.  Good texture.  Served with lime tortilla chips as a vegan and gluten free starter, but we just didn't find any wow factor in this dip.  Maybe a little more picante sauce for a slightly looser texture and a bit of heat...

This was excellent! I didn't cook on stovetop, rather mixed all ingredients and refrigerated all day. Heated up in oven for about 30 min or so. Was gone in minutes. Will make again!

Just made this and HAD to leave a review! This is the BEST bean dip that I've ever had. My husband even loved it and he's usually a pretty picky eater.  Followed the recipe exactly except I added a little more of the spices, used olive oil instead,  and cooked half the onions and left the rest raw for a little more crunch (plus we love raw onions). It makes a lot but it is so hard to put down.  Definitely a keeper!

Made this for a little gathering-guests are dairy-free.  Left cheese out and it's still delicious.  Added a few drops of Frank's hot sauce which made it even better!

Quick, easy and delicious. I followed the recipe except for the cheese (didn't have any and don't generally eat it), and it was exactly what I'd been hankering for. I served it topped with a bit of homemade salsa and blue corn tortilla chips.

Awesome dip recipe.  I did dice up a jalapeno pepper for extra spice and added an extra garlic clove.  Since I was taking it to work, put everything into a slow cooker to keep warm.  So yummy!!!!

Terrific dip and good to make ahead and heat up later! Made the dip in the morning and kept in fridge until party, put in a crock pot- then added the cheese and cilantro.... I tripled the recipe, and didn't have much leftover. I used frozen corn, and roma tomatoes with the seeds removed and mashed the beans again after every thing was in the fry pan.... added more cumin and chili, and salt. Always add more cheese and picante throughout the night, keeps it moist.
Good recipe!

The flavor was okay but the texture was way too thick.  We love TexMex but this just didn't do it for us.  I'm going to try some of the other black bean dips.

The fresh corn in this is great!  I ended up using a Mexican cheese blend instead of the Monterey Jack, because that's all I had on hand (making tacos).  By the way, instead of refried beans, this would be super fantastic on tostadas!  Make sure to serve it warm! YUM YUM YUM!

Simple, but very near perfect.  I added lemon juice instead of lime, 1/3 c red bell pepper and 1/4 c cuban pepper.

It was delicious! I did change it a bit though.  I used purple onions instead. 
Also I added some ground coriander, ginger, red pepper flakes, and red cayenne pepper.  

I did not use picante sauce or tomatoes... instead I used my homemade salsa.

Also... I sauteed the garlic, onions, and corn together and added a few serrano pepper slices.

Instead of monterey jack cheese I used velveeta cheese.

Everyone loved it.

I doubled the beans and left out the cilantro (husband doesn't like) and this was the best we've ever had!  Thanks :)

Everyone loved this dip.  Next time I would add a couple of jalapenos to increase the heat.
