I read the reviews n made a cpl of adjustments. But I LOVE this recipe!! Oddly I like quiche but don’t love too much egg, so I added lots of stuff so they were barely held together by the egg. I used broccoli, mushroom, onion n ham. To hold everything, I used about 1.5 of all ingredients. 6 eggs because they were small for being called large, and someone else said they might use 4 next time. And 1.5x the cheese, milk, spices, etc. I only had almond milk so that’s what I put in. I also added the 1/8 tsp cayenne that another person suggested. These were delicious, I’ve told my mom about them, n I’ll definitely make again!! Thanks for sharing the recipe!!

Doubled the recipe and made it in a cake pan (3 qt).  Did not use the blender and  cut out the cottage cheese and increased the shredded cheese. Added a package of green giant spinach cooked and drained, chopped mushrooms , baked at 350 for 30 min or so.  Very good and makes an excellent make ahead breakfast. Freezes well too.

Made this recipe today and enjoyed it immensely.  I followed the recipe exactly but next time might use four eggs.

Believe the reviews - these are really good - the only addition I made was to add about 1/8 tsp of cayenne.  These are delicious and so easy to throw together.

This recipe came out great! The only change I made was to skip the blender step, since I didn’t want to dirty any more dishes than necessary. I’ll definitely make it again.

This recipe is easy and changeable for your personal taste.   I had a can of green chilies and added that to the mix!  Delicious & easy.  No fuss for multiple mini quiche's that were used for breakfast all week.

I just made this, thinking it might be something I could make for my elderly parents, but not really expecting much. Wow - what a surprise. Really light tasting and delicious. Now I can't wait to make it again!!!
