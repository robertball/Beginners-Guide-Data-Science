I needed much more water than 1 Tbsp. At 10 Tbsps, I stopped counting. In the end for this recipe, as written, I needed approx. 1 cup of water. I added an extra Tbsp of oil as well. This is a nice gluten free way to have a pancake to use as a wrap, but they do break a bit. Large pancakes don't flip well so pay attention to make the right size, enough to accommodate your spatula. The taste is simple and tastes like a rice pancake so it won't over power what you are eating. Having said that, I used this for crespelle filled with ricotta and spinach topped with b√©chamel, it didn't hold up to having sauce poured over it and then baked. This would be a perfect pancake to use as a wrap or "tortilla" replacement. Leftovers baked well to form a taco shell or chip. Thank you kim for sharing your recipe.

The recipe as is has little to no taste.  I am going to try again; but, will add milk instead of water (needs way more moisture than the recipe calls for), and will add honey to give it more flavor.
