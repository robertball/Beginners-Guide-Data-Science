I omitted the nutmeg only because I didn't have it. These cookies are simply addicting. I only had to use one tub of frosting to cover all the cookies.

So I made these cookies with my class. The cookie dough was delicious. When it came time to frost I followed the directions and they did not frost well. So we opted to spread with a knife and let frosting harden. But painting them was a disaster. We made the Flavor Paints and the paint ran on the cookies.
