Made these again for a Super Bowl Party. This time, I propped them up in a glass dish by making a wall out of aluminum foil, so the peanut butter stayed in better. Then I put them under the broiler for a few minutes to get the peanut butter crusty before lying them down in the dish to roast at 375. They're still great.  First, I have to say that the entire office was skeptical of these. Some wouldn't try them when I made a few dozen of them. Those who did unilaterally were pleasantly surprised at how 'not awful' the results were. This is a terrific alternative to cheese-stuffed peppers and should be tried before judged. Super Bowl Sunday seems like a good time to experiment.  Also, try sticking them, uncovered, under the broiler. I did them both ways and preferred those done under the broiler to those roasted in foil.

LOL...okay...I admit..I looked at this recipe and was like..no way...but I made them and they are actually really good. The peanut butter takes on some of the taste and heat from the peppers. It reminds me of the peanut sauce you make for chicken saytay. Try it...different but good.

I couldn't bring myself to try it, but my guest who loves peppers ate them all.  They were kind of messy to make, next time I'll put the peanut butter in a small zip lock and cut a small corner off and squeeze it into the peppers.

I just had to make these--so good!  Then I thought why not put some chocolate in with the peanutbutter. Used a Hershey Bar cut in little peices. Baked for 30 minutes and then salted with sea salt. That really hit the spot with me and my husband. Will make again!

Consider and try this addition: Wrap each peanut butter filled pepper half with a half slice of bacon ..tip for the bacon getting crisp is I precook just slightly, where its not done, but still limber! I promise, you have to try it to believe the taste! I prefer the chunky PB, also and cooking under broiler as one review suggested

I made these for a party and they were a huge hit! I was a bit nervous heading in as it is such a unique combination. I am so glad I took the chance because not only did they make a great ice breaker, but they were a huge success! In fact, we are making them for another (much larger) party at my husbands bosses house next weekend. 

One quick note about the heat. I made about 20 peppers, and some were really hot, some were milder. The smaller ones seems to have the most kick! So, if you don't like the heat, my advice is to get the bigger peppers and make sure you scoop the seeds out really well!

I was expecting a surprising flavor here, but it ended up just tasting like warm peanut butter held in a tasteless jalapeno shell.  Roasting made the peppers wilty, and the flavor and spunk just weren't there.  Needs more spicing, ingredients, or something.

Really great if you like peanut butter, which I do!  My sister's face was priceless when I served them, but she ended up enjoying them as much as I did. I roasted them in the foil, then threw them under the broiler for a couple of minutes.  A keeper!

My DH loves poppers, so i decided to surprise him.  I didn't want to do all PB; so i did some colby jack and cream cheese too.  He loved the PB.  Reminded him of peanut thai.  I will make these again.  I used chunky PB, it was all I had.

Our preferred way to make these is NOT to cook them- just use a fresh jalapeno, mindful to remove seeds and membranes.  Reminiscent of more-traditional stuffed celery, but with some real FIRE!  Not for the faint of heart!

I don't know how, but I think I managed to get the mildest jalapenos on earth.  As a result the peanut butter had no heat balance it out and it ended up tasting like just peanut butter.  I'll try again with some spicier ones and update.  In the meantime, here's a pic of what I got.

I brought these to a Super Bowl party and they went over pretty well. Everyone that tried them approached them with skepticism and seemed to come away pleased.  I used organic all natural peanut butter which was a bit to liquid so made putting the jalapenos on their side difficult.  Once in the oven though they seemed to hold together well.  This is as you would expect, very spicy, but the peanut butter is a really nice contrast to the hot.  Good party food that will get attention.

my husband eats these all the time, usually fresh (not baked) but baking them makes the peanut butter even more creamy and gooey than it already is. I add a few tablespoons of honey to the peanut butter most of the time... it adds a nice touch of sweetness!

I did not care for this recipe. 
There are much better things to do with both ingredients.
 I was hoping for an intriguing taste and got- well, 
peanut butter and jalapeno peppers, neither of which complement
one another.

We had a bumper crop of jalapenos so I looked up jalapenos on allrecipes and found this, we were game to try them and loved them:) We found it was a great alternative to fried stuffed peppers.

Maybe it was just that my jalapenos were not spicy enough, but I was VERY disappointed in this recipe. I had a friend with some dietary restrictions coming for a party, so I thought I would try these as a fun alternative to some normal party dishes. They just seemed very lacking. I might try them again, but I would need to make some serious adjustments.

WOW. This sounded so crazy I HAD to try it. I can't believe it, but they are delicious! My two 11 year old kids loved these. These are a great "conversation starter" appetizer.

I wanted to try this just for something different.  Because I wasn't sure about it, I only used 2 jalapenos.  I was a little afraid of them being too hot, so I did use extra peanut butter.  BIG mistake!  I liked the little bite from the jalapenos, and ended up scraping half the peanut butter out!  I will definetly make these again.

Great concept, but maybe some more coaching would be beneficial. Mine were scorching hot, so the second batch I cooked a little more and came out tolerable but a little too sweet. I suppose the key is in finding the happy middle ground, but I doubt I'll be investing the time. Perhaps battering and frying might add some good texture?

Made this for a dinner party and it was a hit.  Feedback was that it was not that hot surprisingly.

We've made these for years but we do not like ours cooked, and we use crunchy peanut butter for another layer of texture. I always wear gloves when I slice the peppers and deseed them.  then fill with crunchy peanut butter and chill before serving. You'll find the peppers are not nearly as hot when baked.

Ooh man these were so good and I'm glad I gave them a shot. I used both crunchy and creamy peanut butter. When they finished cooking I thought they tasted like green bell peppers. I did have to talk my 12 year old into trying them and she was the only one who ended up with a spicy one. I will be making these again but I'll make sure to leave some of the seeds or a sliced pepper on top for those who like them spicy.

Very bland. Couldn't taste the jalapeño at all, as some other reviewers said. Just tasted like warm peanut butter. I'll stick with stuffing them with cream cheese and wrapping them in bacon.

I thought I would try this recipe because my husband and I love stuffed jalapenos and thought it would be fun to try something new plus we like peanut butter.  The peanut butter did take some of the hot out of the chili which made it easy to eat. However i thought it was too much peanut butter taste. Maybe if there was something else mixed in with the peanut butter to give a little different taste. I think next time, i'm going to do as someone else suggested and use pieces of chocolate.

I tested these out on my coworkers & everybody liked them. I'm moving to Mexico in a few days and will test them again down there. How to know the heat of a jalapeno pepper is the more curve on the stem the hotter the pepper.

We smoked some jalapenos before stuffing them, so my results will be different than others.  These were fantastic.  I was surprised that there was still a good heat from the jalapeno and the peanut butter really went well with it.

I tried this after reading the reviews and thought this would probably be a very tasty treat.  Unfortunately I was not impressed. I tried a couple different ways including putting them under the broiler to see if that improved things.  It did not.   I would not recommend this recipe to anyone.

This was definitely one of the strangest, simplest, and most intriguing recipes I've ever seen.  We made this recipe on New Year's Eve and everyone loved it. You can't imagine the results until you try it. Yum!

My bf and I didn't love these.  I thought I'd love them since I love peanut butter and I love spicy food, but this didn't really hit the right spot.  Next time I'll make a spicy peanut sauce -- I knew such a simple peanut/spicy fix was too good to be true.  I gave this three stars because there's nothing inherently wrong with the recipe, and I did eat it, but I won't be making it again.

These really just tasted like warm peanut butter to me.  However, my peppers did not seem to have much bite, so that may have played a role.

Good for jalapeno lovers, but they were still quite hot. This may be because the jalapenos I used had also aged for a little while.

These are good, but still pretty hot!  Maybe they should be cooked a little longer than what the recipe called for...

Excellent combo. After grabbing some fresh jalapenos from my garden, I split them in half and removed the seeds, To tone down the heat of the jalapenos, I sprinkled some Equal (sugar substitute for my diabetic household member) on the jalapeno halves. Then, after filling them with peanut butter, I sprinkled a little more Equal on top. The Equal worked like a charm rendering just the right amount of hot pepper kick. Love these things and will definitely make them again!

Surprisingly delicious!! I wasn’t sure exactly what to expect.. I subbed (prepared) powdered peanut butter to cut down on the fat, and it tasted delicious! Will make these again for appetizers, for sure!

It does all depend on the jalapenos you get, no way to tell by size, shape, or color. Have made these several times in the oven and over live fire. For the oven I cook bacon then crumble it fine and mix it in with the peanut butter. I skip the foil, just chuck them in a cass. dish or bake pan. 15 min or so @ 350 pop under broil min. or so till I like how they look. Good eats in my book!

I made 1/2 with bacon and 1/2 without. I didn't care for it.

We are not into the hot peppers but these are really good and easy to make.   I first had some by accident. Thought it was something else than  Jalapenos and ate some and thought it was good enough that I got the recipe and actually planted some Jalapenos just so I could make these

I liked it, but the chile lost most of it's heat in the cooking and maybe I put on too much peanut butter.  I may have cookedit too long.
Will try again, broiling without wrapping and see what happens.

Loved it!  I broiled them first like Seattle Dad recommended.  Great, healthy alternative to the cheese poppers which I love so much.  I used 3 peppers with this recipe, fully planning on having leftovers for a snack later as I was cooking for one, but I swear these are addictive.  I ate all of them.  And I want more.

These get some credit for ease of preparation, but we much prefer the sausage stuffed jalapenos on this site.  I keep thinking we could add something to the peanut butter to liven it up a little, but haven't tried anything yet.  Maybe cayenne or Tabasco?  Or how about making it as peanut butter cookie dough, the kind that has no flour?  I have found that these work about the same if you leave them uncovered and bake them 15 minutes in a 425 oven.  This made them compatible with the sausage ones baked on the same cookie sheet.  I will probably make them again, especially if there are vegetarians around.  Two spoons make filling them easy.

We also enjoy the same snack, but without cooking them!  They are always a hit.
