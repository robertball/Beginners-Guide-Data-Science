I cooked this for my Husband who just started the keto diet. I prepared it as written & everybody in the family enjoyed it.  It's a good taco shell substitute.  It's not as hard as a hard taco shell but not as soft as a soft flour tortilla either. Consistency is somewhere between the two.  Thanks!  I will make this again.

I was a bit skeptical at first. Once I made it , it was absolutely delicious and our family loved it. I would just add a touch more of the taco seasoning, other than that, it was like eating real Mexican tacos.  The shells are so flexible it shocked me but just so good

This was so easy and delicious! I didnâ€™t even miss the tortilla. My husband liked it also. I will definitely make it again.  I may fry pork or beef too.
