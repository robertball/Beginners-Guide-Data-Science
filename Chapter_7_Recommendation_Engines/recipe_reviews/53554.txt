These potatoes were great. Sealed them in 2 & 4 portion sizes. Froze them and used them when I needed a side dish. These were excellent and no one even suspected that they had previously been frozen and reheated. Excellent recipe

velvety and delicious- followed recipe to a "T" - was done early- kept in oven for 1/2 an hour while rest of dinner finished- they still tasted perfect and were very pretty as a side item to the meat.

You can not go wrong with this recipe.  What could be better than chives and sour cream with mashed potatoes.  I make roasted garlic potatoes on a regular basis, and this was a great change to our usual.  Will definately make again.  Thanks for the post.

I have always made our mashed potatoes this way. Sooo good! I use the sour cream occasionally but not all the time. I also add about 1/4-1/2 cup melted butter in which I sautee the green onions in for a few seconds. MMmmmm!

Great alternative to standard mashed potatoes!  Followed the recipe exactly but added some butter and they turned out wonderful.

My entire family loved this recipe even my husband who had to eat it reheated.  It was sooo creamy and delicious.  I added 3 Tbsp butter and used dried chives instead of fresh.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

A very good variation on an old standby.  This dish tastes excellent as is and lends itself to experimenting by adding garlic, parmesan cheese etc.  The dots of green chives added some nice contrast to the white potatoes.

These are good potatoes.  I used yellow Finns instead of Yukons (store didn't have Yukons), light sour cream and 1% milk, but not as much as called for.  I loved the fresh chives in these.  Make sure to add a little salt and pepper- it really brings out the mild flavor of the chives and sour cream.  Had these with Savory Garlic Marinated Steaks (this site) and it was such a delicous meal!

Yum Yum Yum!!! Followed recipe to the T except I added a little sprinkled cheddar cheese on top at the end.  Looks, smells, and tastes delish! Very easy.

I was looking for something different to do with mashed potatoes.  I mixed the milk, sour cream and chives together in a measuring cup and let it "blend" while I peeled the potatoes and cooked them.  Cheese on top wouldn't be a bad idea.

It was just ok... nothing to get excited about. Honestly, it was rather bland ... the sour cream didn't add any additional flavour

Great basic recipe.  I keep the skins in (for the vitamins) and add an 8 oz brick of cream cheese into the mix, when I whip the potatoes.

Excellent Lauren! Nothing is more yummy than sour cream and chives and the combo added a wonderful flavor to the spuds. I used lite sour cream and it worked well in this dish. Thanks a heap!

I made this recipe exactly as the recipe called for and thought it was just okay.  It was actually a little bland and almost too creamy with the milk and sour cream.  If I made it again I would add garlic salt and reduce the amount of milk and/or sour cream.  Let's put it this way...everyone ate it, but no one "oohed and ahhed" over it.

These were delicious!  A great way to spruce up your regular mashed potatoes.  I whipped some butter into them also.  Mashed potatoes arent mashed potatoes without the butter!  These are going into my recipe book.

These were okay, but you have to really like the flavor: of "sour cream and onion!" I used reduced fat sour cream and low-fat milk. And, for the onions I used dry chives. The bottle said 1tsp dried=1Tblsp of fresh. They were fine with a beef dish I made tonight, but they couldn't be a regular, because they have such a distinct flavor, in my opinnion!

I love homemade mashed potatoes, and this is a great easy to make, from scratch recipe. I used russet potatoes instead but yukon would have probably tasted best. I added a little butter as well, just because, butter makes everything better. Fast, easy and yummy!

Good recipe! I like anything that takes the  'plain' out of mashed potatoes. I do this but to make it easier (and just as tasty), make whatever amount of potatoes you need. When I make potatoes just for the two of us, I just whip in any leftover sour cream dip we have. Bacon/horseradish is really good. If making more spuds, just use the whole tub. Keep in mind the salsa-type don't work.

Yummy potatoes!  I used red skin potatoes, boiled them for 25 minutes and then used my hand held mixer to make them smooth.  I added the fresh chives last...very good.

Mm, these were good! I was worried going into this recipe that the potatoes would have too much of a sour cream-y taste, but it was really quite mellow. It ended up being the chives that dominated the flavor. I heated up my milk and sour cream together before adding it to the potatoes. (Adding cold liquid to hot taters can make them gummy! Ew.) All in all, I don't know if I'll make them again. I won't be getting up in the night for them. But they were decently tasty, simple to make, and were a change from the normal 'plain' potatoes. Thanks.

I definitely didn't think these were anything great.  I had some Yukon gold potatoes to use up, which is why I chose this recipe.  They were dry and more lumpy than anything, so I added about another 1/4 cup milk and then I was able to get them smoothy and creamy.  I should've added more sour cream instead as they were pretty bland.  Too much pepper in mashed potatoes just seems weird, and I didn't want to have to add more salt for flavor, cause I already eat too much of it.  The only redeeming thing is that they look nice, and could be served with other things that have more flavor.

These potatoes were excellent. I didn't have Yukon gold, so I used regular baking potatoes. I also used a mix of chives and green onions from our garden, and it was fantastic!

This is a great super easy recipe to have! It's wonderful for those times you want mashed potatoes, but don't have meat juices to make gravy to go with them. The proportions of everything are just right...the potatoes came out flavorful and super creamy, with just the right amount of chive flavor. I'll be making these again for sure...thanks for sharing the recipe!!!!

I thought these mashed potatoes were kind of bland, as did my husband.  They were lacking flavor, but the chives gave it some color and made them look pretty. They were ok, not sure I'd make them again.

The sour cream and chives provided a great twist to a classic dish.  I made this and the Green Bean Bundles of Joy as side dishes to the Spicy Oven Fried Chicken from this site.  It was a great meal!

These were pretty good!  A little bland, DEFINITELY add salt, pepper and butter to make it better.  I used whipped cream cheese with chives instead of sour cream and chives...and I sprinkled fresh chives on the top.  It turned out great!

This is a simple but tasty recipe for mashed potatoes.  I was looking for something slightly different from traditional milk and butter mashed potatoes, but didn't want cream cheese type heavy potatoes  so when I found this I had to give it a try.  I'm glad I did.  Delicious!

YUM!!!  I just made these mashed potatoes to go with dinner tonight.  It wasn't this exact recipe because my brother was online so I couldn't come to this website, but I did exactly the same thing except I used about 2 1/2 tablespoons of reduced fat margarine and as much light sour cream as seemed good.  The sour cream really makes these different from other potatoes and like the other poster said, the chives look nice and also lend an additional good flavor!  Mmmmmmm

For a spicy variation: add raw onion slices / dice em I guess to the hot mash, the onion softens up a bit in the heat and then toss in a finely sliced green chilli !

I don't usually follow a recipe for mashed potatoes but thought I would follow this recipe exactly for kicks (I did use scallions). It was fabulous! Just the right mix of ingredients. I served this with Slow Cooker Turkey from AR and had very little left!! Thank you! So simple but worth following!

I loved these mashed potatoes.  So easy to make and delicious.  This is the first time I did not use an entire stick of butter in my mashed potatoes.  I am sure the Yukons had a lot to do with that.  I left a little bit of the peel and they turned out fantastic.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  I will use it everytime I make mashed potatoes!

Good as is, better with a couple tbsp. of butter. I come from the school that potatoes without butter just aren't done. A good pair with meatloaf.

I have used this recipe for years.  It is the same I used for twice-baked potatoes. However, I add grated cheddar cheese.  For the amounts given in this recipe, I would use 1/4 cup.  I also like to put in a casserole dish and heat by baking at 350 until hot.  Wonderful recipe!

These were great.  I didn't have enough potatoes so it was a little too soupy.. but it didn't matter cause they still tasted really good.  Next time I will make sure I have enough potatoes cause it would have been even better if I could have made it right.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made these potatoes for a dinner party I held last night and they were pretty good (but not incredible).  The proportions of milk/sour cream/potatoes was just perfect.  I felt that the potatoes could have used a lot more chives though - like double the amount called for.  The sour cream flavour was definitely there as a background note, but not at all overpowering, so if you're looking for more flavour in that area, I'd sub out some of the milk and add more sour cream.  I may make these again because they were good and they looked nice on the plate with the little flecks of green.

I thought this was really tasty considering this is my first time making any sort of mashed potatoes. Although a lot of my guest didn't like chives, I'd recommend offering those seperate because some don't want it in there. Otherwise very good with yukon gold!!!

This was a great recipe - easy to follow and delicious!!

I made one slight change, because I didn't have any fresh chives - so I used french onion dip instead of plain sour cream - it worked great!

There was nothing great about this recipe. I think it needs butter.

The kids who love mashed potatoes did not like these all that much.  Sorry but I have to agree.  Got them to eat by putting on a ton of gravy.  Would probably not make again.

My wife and I really like this recipe. I used one green onion (don't use too many green onions because they can overpower the potatoes. I like my mashed potatoes a little more creamy that my wife, so just use enouth milk to make it the consistency you want.

I thought these were very good but it seemed like something was missing. My family liked them but weren't overly excited. I think I will try them again but will add a couple T of butter for a bit more flavor.

Excellent taste and easy to prepare. Was the perfect sidedish to go along with a pork tenderloin and olive dish I made (see reviews). Instead of milk, I used heavy whipping cream and upped the butter.

These were really wonderful, creamy potatoes!  The whole family enjoyed them; I will definitely make them again!  
(I made the recipe as written, except that I used dried chives instead of fresh, because that's what I had on hand.  You can use an equal amount of dried chives as fresh.)  My only note: Some in the reviews complained that this recipe is bland.  The recipe says "salt and pepper to taste."  It DEFINITELY requires salt, and I really rarely use it.  But once you add that salt and pepper to taste, it really is not bland at all.....  just creamy goodness :)

Been doing this type of mash potatoes for 9 years. The family prefers it to the regular/buttery/garlicky kind for Thanksgiving dinner. I now only use Russet because Yukon gold came out gooey one year so I became paranoid (although I'm sure I did something wrong). One thing I learned from 2 disasters is to mash the potatoes (with a ricer or large fork if you have the arm strength) right away after boiling when they're piping hot or else it's extremely hard to avoid lumps. This of course means dealing with hot items but...the things we do for a great meal! I also recently started to add butter for extra richness. I've used fresh chives and freeze dried chives; both work equally well but scallions do not IMHO. The taste is just not the same when paired with sour cream.

These were very delicious.  We didn't have any chives, so we left them out.  Next time we will try it with the chives.  I can't wait to have leftovers tomorrow!

I had to adjust the size a bit, as my local grocery store doesn't sell this kind of potatoes in the right quantity. To compensate, I first put in the amount of sour cream that the recipe says, taste tested it, and then added until I was satisfied that it was  good ratio. Everyone thought it was delicious (and my family includes hardcore dieters who refuse potatoes usually.) I'm definitely going to make it again, this time I plan to make an even bigger batch as it saves so well for leftovers! (Seriously the small bit left over last time tasted totally fresh.)

Update: I have made it with 5lb of potatoes a few times now with the same procedure and same results except now we had amazingly still fresh mashed potatoes for a couple weeks!

I enjoyed it. I added a half  stick of butter. The potatoes  were very smooth ( no lumps)  after using my mixture. Next time I will not get them as smooth for more texture. I like to taste some of the potato lumps if this makes sense. 

Make sure you try the fresh chives. The chives is what made this recipe awesome. For people who like a bit more spice may have to add more. I could see someone thinking they may be to bland, but I don't like salty foods. This was perfect for me. 

lastly, I used dairy free sour cream because of my allergy to dairy. This is a great dish if you are into Sunday dinners with the family. It was a hit at my table.

i can't find the recipe i originally used. maybe this is it. i don't know. but if you want more flavor....boil the potatoes with some garlic cloves (whole peeled cloves)- then after the potatoes are drained, just mash the soft cloves along with the potatoes...don't put too much milk or it dilutes the flavor. and make sure to slather on tons of butter afterwards. i get demands for these every thanksgiving. it's always a hit.

My husband LOVES Sour Cream and Chive mashes potatoes, but always got the instant stuff (grooosssss!). I made this for him and he as thrilled :) 
I added 1/4 cup extra sour cream and used green onions in place of chives. Huge hit, awesome success. This is definitely going on the regular menu!!

These were good, but nothing special.  My BF said they were "awesome" so Im compromising with 4 stars.  I used fat free half and half instead of milk and light sour cream.  I couldnt find chives so I used green onions.  Easy and fast so I will probably make again.  Oh and I used a ricer to get the potatoes creamy before I mixed in the other ingredients.

I think the recipe is as good as it can get. Unfortunately, it wasn't as tasty.

Nothing all that special about these tates.  The chives does overpower the dish in my opinion, so next time I'll use just one tablespoon for 4 servings (instead of two).

These were great, I really liked the chives and sour cream flavor.  I boiled the potatoes the night before Thanksgiving and then mashed them and did the rest the next day. So the potatoes were warm, I thought I'd warm up the milk and sour cream before mixing in.  The sour cream looked nasty after warming, so I ended up just adding that in cold after all.  So in order to make them hot, I put the fully mixed potatoes into a casserole, covered with tin foil, in the oven for 10-15 min on 350 (had something else cooking at that temp, so just put this in along with the other thing).  That worked well, as the potatoes weren't dry when I took them out.  I added a lot more chives to the potatoes than called for b/c I really like chives.  I cut them with kitchen scissors (works great so long as the chives aren't wet) and mixed them with the potatoes when I added the sour cream.  I then also garnished with a few remaining sprigs when I took the potatoes out of the oven.  I think next time I may try adding a tbs of butter just to see how that tastes, but otherwise, I think these were great.  Everyone at my Thanksgiving liked them a lot!

These were good - but not GREAT.  I added quite a bit of pepper to liven them up, and then even a little garlic powder. Hubby said he shouldve put butter on his, but we ate them plain. I would probably stick with my other favorite mashed potato recipe on here, Garlic Mashed Potatoes Secret Recipe. Thanks!

I fed several people on these but of course had to more than double the recipe in order to do so. The only change I made was I left the skins on the potatoes. Scrubbed them really good with my veggie and fruit wash, chopped them up to boil just like normal and I used my hand held electric mixer to blend them. They were a huge hit. I served them with chicken cordon bleu, the sweet rolls from this site and asparagus. Topped the meal off with the berry shortbread dreams cookies from this site also. All were wonderful and well worth the work!

I LOVE this. I will never eat plain mashed potatoes again. I did take others advice and sauteed the chives in butter, then added it to the potatoes. I didn't want anything "crunchy" in my mashed potatoes other than the lumps...I love the lumps. Thanks for the recipe.

These were good. I needed way more sour cream and milk to make it creamy than the recipe called for. Maybe next time I'll throw in some cheddar cheese. Will make this again!

Instead of mashing the potatoes with a masher or a fork I mix all of the ingredients with the cooked potatoes and puree them in a BLENDER... it makes them smooth and extra creamy! Delicious!

I loved this recipe! The first time i tried it I made as instructed and loved them, but my little boy was not so fond of the little green "bugs" so now i just leave them out. They are still so wonderful, I love the sour cream flavor, and it makes the potatoes so much tastier!

Good but pretty basic.  I expected this to have more flavor-- wouldn't recommend serving it with a bland entree.

It is useful, however, as a way to dress up refrigerated mashed potatoes.

These have really become a household favorite.  It's similar to a recipe I've used before with sliced green olives.  I used scallions, light sour cream, and yukon gold potatoes. Seemed funny not to use butter, but it was not missed.  Thanks for sharing!

Yumm!!! I didn't have chives, so I used some very finley minced yellow onion instead. I also added a couple cloves of minced garlic. Oh ya, and I cut down the amount of milk and added some butter to make them nice a creamy. Very tasty!

Very good, simple, and hearty side dish.  Because there are so few ingriedients though, you must use top quality items.  I used non-fat sour cream, and old-ish russets, and it did not quite live up to it's potential.
