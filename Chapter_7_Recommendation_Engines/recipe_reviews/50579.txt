My husband and I went to heaven the night we made this!  We had never had flank steak before so this was something new.  Now we'll be making it all the time.  I used 1 tbsp. veg. oil (didn't have any olive) and 1 tbsp. sesame oil since since the rest of the reciple had an Asian theme to it.  I also added about 1/2 to 1 tbsp. hot red pepper flakes.  It certainly didn't add any spice but it may have added to the flavor so I'll do that again next time.  I marinated it for two days, grilled it med. to med.-rare and sliced it real thin against the grain.  Superb!  IMPORTANT:  You must slice this cut of meat thin and against the grain otherwise it won't be tender.

This is an amazing marinade.  I left it for 24 hours on a tougher piece of meat....and it came out wonderful.  Thank you for such a wonderful recipe.

Yummy!  And so easy to make.  I used a flank steak, scored on both sides, and marinated for about 24 hrs.  Great taste and it came out surprisingly tender, for a flank steak.  Next time, I will try to marinate it even longer.  This marinade would work well with any cut of beef.

Great marinade.  To keep the marinade low carbs, I used 3 packets of Splenda instead of the brown sugar.  Also, I served the steak on a bed of the oriental cabbage salad featured in the South Beach Diet.  It was delicious.

The recipe is 5 star because it's soooooo delicious. I marinated a 1 1/2 lb. flank steak for about 7 hours, and grilled in the oven 5 minutes on each side. It was fabulous! My 3 boys ages 8, 6 and 5 raved - now that's a miracle that all three loved it - especially the little one who never likes anything. A keeper - they asked to eat it once a week!

Very delicious marinade. Used it on a ribeye steak marinated for about 8 hours then grilled on the George Foreman grill.

Excellent recipe! I've made it several times now, and as I like to make the marinade into a sauce to serve with the meat, I now reduce the soy sauce to 1/4 cup and add 1/4 cup of red wine vinegar. Otherwise, the sauce is so salty that it really has to be worked with to make it usable.

I actually was going to broil an oyster cut London Broil and wanted a new marinade so I tried this.  Quick and easy to make and it added a nice flavor to the beef.  I would definitely use it on a flank steak which is much tougher and let it marinade overnite.

My husband and toddlers gave this recipe a thumbs up!  It's easy to make and it gave our meat a lot of flavor.  The only thing I might change next time is a little less soy sauce (personal preference)

Great marinade - kids loved it.  The flavors were subtle yet seemed to soak all the way through the steaks, and smelled great while cooking.

I made this recipe exactly as stated, no changes.  I did double up.  I used 2 London Broil cuts of meat, about 2 pounds each.  I left the marinade on the meat for 3 days before cooking.  I grilled one cut over charcoal, and broiled the other in the marinade in the oven.  Seven minutes on each side on the grill, and 10 minutes on each side in the oven.  Both methods were AMAZING!!!  The meat was tender, juicy, and had amazing flavor!!!

We absolutely love this marinade! Anytime we make Flank Steak now we use it. I have never used ginger in the recipe though. Tastes great without it so I've never bothered to adding it.

I don't know why this is a five star recipe.  It did nothing to make my steak tender, and the flavor was mediocre. Don't waste your time on this one.

This is so good.  I used this marinade with top round steak and it turned out great.  I marinated it for 24 hours, which I think, made a big difference.  I used 1/2 of the requested oil and a little more lemon juice.  Will make this a regular!

Just awesome! I could eat this every day! My favorite meal along with grilled asparagus. I marinate for 24 hours and leave out the pepper and add about 1/4 cup brown sugar. I also have reduced the oil to 1 tablespoon and didn't notice a difference of course. Another one of my attempts here and there to reduce fat and calories when my jeans get tight. Just fabulous! I think this could flip a lifelong vegan into a born-again carnivore! : )

This was a good recipe.  I really enjoyed it although it did turn out slightly too salty.  That's probably my fault since I used really thinly cut top sirloin which probably shouldn't have been marniated over night.

If I were looking for an Asian marinade this would be a really good one.  I rated it 4 stars only because it was so salty.  That can be remedied by adding a bit more brown sugar.

Delicious marinade!  I use it on flank steak that I cut up and serve over a big salad with orange sesame dressing.  The flavor combination of the fresh vegetables, steak, marinade and dressing are out of this world!

This is a great marinade.  I add about 1/4- 1/2 C. orange juice.  I also cook under the broiler for about 4-5 min per side then wrap in foil for 10 min. for meat to soak all juices back in.

My husband really enjoyed this; I thought it was a little too salty which is why I gave it 4 stars.  I will make it again but I will cut down on the soy sauce.

This was good a little salty. My boyfriend is an A1 man all the way so he didn't get the full flavors. Next time I think I will cut down the soy sauce or add a little water. Otherwise this is really yummy.

My husband loves this stuff... I think it's just okay. I've made it a few times, and have started using slices of fresh ginger (about an inch of gingerroot, sliced into 6 or 8 pieces) in place of the ground ginger.

My family LOVES this.  Seriously, they cannot get enough.  And I have teenagers, whose tastes (as I'm sure many of you know) can change on a whim and often do!

I like to make the marinade in large quantities and use my vacuum sealer to package and freeze it in batches.  This way, if I need something I can do quickly, I just throw the vacuum-sealed bag into a pot of hot water and presto--no having to make it on the spot!

Very yummy!  Out of necessity I had to make a few substitutions.  I ran out of soy sauce so I made up the 1/8 cup difference with worcestershire sauce, instead of lemon juice I used lime juice, and in place of the ground ginger I used whole allspice.  I also added about 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes which added a nice flavor, but not much spice.  The steak turned out very tender and delicious.

This was by far the best flank steak marinade I've ever had. The steak was so tender and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly as is. We used the leftovers on a pizza with tomato and onion and it was delicious.

I marinated my flank steak for 48 hours, and it turned out delicious.  I forgot to add chopped garlic, so I sprinkled some garlic powder into the plastic bag (plus meat tenderizer because this was my first time making flank steak and I was nervous it'd be chewy).  I'm going to slice up the leftovers, add some fresh lime and spices, and have fajitas tonight.

I really enjoyed this marinade and thought it tasted delicious. It tasted a little like Japanese shogayaki. My husband on the other hand is a big meat fan and complained about the marinade completely covering the flavor of the beef. So for those of you who enjoy actually tasting the beef, either dont let it marinate too long, or dont use this recipe.

I didn't plan ahead and really couldn't wait a day for this to marinate, but wow, did this ever do the trick! I marinated the flank steak for only about 4 hours and it was tender, juicy and very flavorful. This is one recipe that I will turn to over and over again.

We had this today for Memorial Day. I made it just as described except added a little less soy sauce so it wouldn't be overly salty.  To prepare the meat, I scored the meat before marinating overnight, then grilled 7-10 mins each side, covered with foil and let rest 5 mins.  Juicy yummy meat that everyone loved, including my 2 year old!

FABULOUS!!!! We don't eat steak very often(& tho I consider myself to be a good cook, I can't seem to cook a tender piece of steak)....Trying flank for the first time, I used this marinade, & my hubby, who's sworn off red meat, couldn't say enough (around mouthfuls of delightfully tender, flavorful meat). My mom-in-law was quite impressed as well, & I began watching the sales on flank because I COULDN'T WAIT TO MAKE IT AGAIN!!!! I made it again tonight, & the only thing I've changed is using fresh ginger( I also marinated for 24 hrs as well) THANK U SOOOOO  MUCH!!!!!

Fantastic!  I agree with other reviews that the longer it marinates the better!  We cooked this on the George Foreman for 5/6 minutes and it turned out PERFECT!  Will be making the marinade for pork chops next!!!

I used this on the London Broil I made for my husband's birthday yesterday.  It was quite good.  As I was reviewing the ingredients to see if I had changed anything, I realized that I had forgotten to add the pepper and ginger!  And it was still a great marinade, lol.  The top round I used was quite thick.  I marinaded it for almost 24 hours and grilled it about 10 minutes per side and served it with baked potatoes and shoe-peg corn.  For dessert we had the Golden Lemon Cake also from this site and also delicious.  My husband said it was one of my best meals ever!  Thanks G!

This marinade is SO good.  We used it on New York Steak.  The soy sauce is a little strong.  Next time we'll use a little less.  Otherwise, it is a great marinade that we'll definately use again.

Great marinade!  My family loves it; however, I had to cut down on the soy sauce because we use an authentic one from Asian supermarkets (which is much saltier than the Americanized Kikkoman one).  I had to cut the measurement of soy sauce to almost half as well as the olive oil to compensate.  Also, instead of ground ginger, I grated fresh ginger into the marinade, and this made such a big difference in flavor.  Still good, nonetheless.  It's great with ribs, too!

My husband loved this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly and the steak was moist and tender.  I put the steak in a 9X9 square glass dish and marinated it 6 hours because I forgot about the recommendations to marinate it overnight but it did not seem to matter.  I did not use low sodium soy sauce and I personally did not find it salty.  I thought it was a really good marinade and I will use it again!

This recipe has potential...as written (and I followed it exactly as it's written here), it's just way too salty.  I think I'll take some other reviewers advice and cut back on the soy while adding some kind of juice like pineapple or orange juice.

I added a few splashes of Worcheshire and some cayenne pepper to add some spice.  It was very good, but I don't think I will use the full amount of brown sugar next time.  We like things more spicey and not so sweet.

This marinade was used with a lean flank steak, allowing to to sit refrigerated for 5 hours. The steak was grilled until the internal temperature was 155 degrees. The resulting meat was delicious, albetit a bit salty. I plan to redo this recipe, cutting the soy in half, and replacing the lost liquid with some sort of juice (orange, apple, tomato, grape, wine???). I may even use low sodium soy. But overall, give it a try. I did like the basic premise of the marinade. Recommended, highly.

Marinaded some Rib Eye steaks in this for about 24 hours and then grilled. Best steaks ever. The meat was flavorful and tender. I sent this recipe to all of my siblings.

This seemed pretty bland and just wasn't that great to us, even after marinating for 22 hours.  I followed the ingredients exactly.  It wasn't terrible but I won't be making it again, it wasn't a memorable meal at all for us.  I expected more after reading all the great reviews.  ETA:  ha! this was so unmemorable that I stumbled across it again and decided to try it, not realizing that I already had.  I marinated a ranch steak in it for 6 hours this time.  It was okay, but still not a favorite for us.

This came out really really good.  Since I was cooking this for only two people I had leftover steak. I cut the leftover steak in very thin slices and served it on deli rolls from the bakery.  The steak has so much flavor it made terrific sandwiches.

Awesome. I am not sure if this recipe intended for freeze-dried onions, but I used fresh, and allowed my flank steak to marinate for about 7 hours before grilling it outside. SUCH good flavor! We will be making this again, soon!

WONDERFUL flavor!  I added a bit of Sesame Oil keeping with the whole asian theme.  I let my flank steak marinate for about 24 hours and then threw it on the grill..never had flank steak taste that good..so juicy and tender!  Definitely a keeper!

We've tried a couple of different steak marinades this grilling season and so far this one is the best. I used fresh ginger instead of ginger powder and low sodium soy sauce. We'll be using this one again.

Really, really good!  Marinaded overnight and grilled for 7 mins a side.  Great recipe because I typically have all the ingredients on hand.  I may cut back a little on the soy or switch to low sodium soy.  Some bites seemed a little salty.  Thanks for a winner!  Will definitely make again!

It is so hard to find recipes for tougher cuts of beef so I was really excited to find this marinade.  I used this with an undershoulder cut and let it marinade in the fridge for 6-7 hours.  We don't have a BBQ since ours recently broke so I braised the meat in the over with a mixture of marinade and added chicken broth.  Cooked at 325 for 1 hour 15 minutes and it came out perfect!  Tender and full of flavor.  I even threw in some carrots and potatoes to braise along with the meat.  I will definitely make this again.  Kudos on the great marinade!

WOW!  I made this for a large BBQ crowd and everyone raved about it!  I used petite sirloin, marinated for 2 days and cooked it on the grill.   I boiled the leftover marinade and served it on the side.   The steak went very well with Jamie's Cranberry Spinach Salad and Mushroom Rice (needed to be spiced up a bit) from this site.
Thank you - it's definitely a keeper!

This is a great marinade but I use a mixture of teriyaki sauce and oyster sauce because I find soy sauce to overpower other ingredients.

This was great!! I was a bit unsure how I would like the flavor of the soy sauce with the steak, but altogether it was great! Can't wait to use this recipe again. I used it on ribeye steaks and my guess is that it would be good with any cut of steak.

Great recipe. I planned on this dinner but plans changed so my flank steak marinated for 1.5 days. The taste was awesome. I will definitely make this again.

This was fantastic!  I followed the recipe exactly, although I could find flank steak and had to use London broil.  I let it marinate for 2 days, then grilled it to medium rare, @ 5 minutes per side.  Excellent!

This has to be one of the best marinades i have ever used! 
I too used only 1 tbsp of olive oil and 1 tbsp of sesame oil, i also added an extra tbsp of Lemon juice to try to cut the salt and doubled the ginger because i only had crystallized ginger, and it isnt as strong of a flavor. It tasted so good that my picky two year old ate half of my steak as well! I'm very pleased, will definitely make it again. :-) Thanks

Delicious!  Everyone loved this one, even my 3 yr old had seconds.  My only change was adding about 1 teaspoon dried rosemary and I left it in the fridge for 2 days, wow.  For a 1.5 lb flank steak I grilled for 5 min each side for a nice medium rare.  The edge pieces were done a little more for the kids.

Wow!!!  this was wonderful (a little salty, but that is fine with me).  we used a flat iron steak and it turned out sooooo tender and moist.  i made it per the recipe (which I like to do the first time), but I think i will add a little red wine next time to cut the saltiness, but it is wonderful as-is.

This marinade is absolutely delicious!  I didn't change it a bit.  I marinated 3 flank steaks for 24 hours, and cooked on the grill.  The flavor was immense, and my husband flipped over it.  Even my 18 month old kept saying "bite! bite!" for more.  The next day, we sauteed some of the flank steak w/ onions and melted mozzarella and made our own version of philly cheesesteaks.  Great recipe!  Def. a keeper!

I have made this marinade 5 times now.  It is FABULOUS and sooo easy.  Everyone raves about it. I've tried it on flank steak once and 4 times with flap steak.  It is great on the flap steak.  No need to adjust anything in this recipe, except I add a little more diced garlic.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

My wife came home with a tough cut of meat for me to grill (chuck steak), so I found and tried this marinade. Worked great! After 20 hours of soaking the chuck in this marinade, we had a very tasty and juicy steak off the grill. Of course we still sliced it across the grain. Only changes I made were: 1/2 Tbs onion (I'm not an onion fan), low-sodium soy sauce (that's what was in the fridge), and freshly ground ginger (we keep a root in the freezer). Probably didn't make a difference in the end. Flavors were not too strong or salty.

It wasn't bad, it was more "oniony" than I expected. I thought the onions completeley covered up the taste of the beef.

I didn't have 6 hours to let this marinade, but it didn't matter!  My friend and I thought this was fantastic for bbq flank steak.  I had everything in the kitchen (although I did substitute 2t of fresh minced ginger for the ground ginger)so it was a bonus for the impromptu patio dinner party.  Love it!

Delicious! I made exactly as written. I used a large 2 1/2 lb. top round London broil and marinated overnight in a ziplock bag. I did not alter the recipe even though I had a larger cut of meat and it was fine. Grilled 7 min on each side on a very hot preheated grill  and let the meat rest for about ten minutes before slicing thin. It was perfect! Thanks for the great recipe!

OMG this is so amazing!!!!!  I made as written but didn't have fresh garlic and was too lazy to mince onions.  Used garlic powder and dried onions.  Marinated about 24 hours.  It was to die for!  Thanks for sharing!

This is really really tasty!  I followed the recipe to the T.  I was skeptical when I saw that people said, "my kids love it"  My 6 year old used the word "amazing" to describe this..I didnt even know he knew the word!!!  If you are reading this, You should make this!

We made this for both Mothers Day & Fathers Day meals since it was soooo good.  This adds the perfect flavor to this boring meat, careful not to overcook it!

Delicious.  I make it often.  Usually I use onion powder instead of onion cause I am really lazy.  But everyone who has tried it loves it.

I didn't care for this marinade and neither did my daughter.  She said it was too salty and I agree.  The soy sauce flavor was overwhelming.  I will not be making this recipe again.  It seems that the different seasonings and flavors didn't go together well.

My husband loved this recipe!!  I will be making it again.  I grilled the steak on med-high for 5 mins. on each side.  I took the marinade and reduced it in a saute pan.  It made a great au jus.  I cut the steak very thin against the grain and served it over rice.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This was delicious!!!  We used this & made fajitas, but I think next time, we will just eat the meat by itself since it was sooo tasty!  Could easily be used on many different meats.  We marinated for 2 days... YUMMY!  Definitely a keeper!

Had this tonight, and my 5 year old - who rarely likes beef declared it "best...meat....EVER!" The rest of the family devoured it too. I doubled the marinade (because we had a big flank steak) but I didn't need to. The recipe made plenty as written.

I was looking for a great marinade for my flank steak.  The only changes I made were using garlic powder and onion powder instead of the actual garlic and onion (chalk it up to being lazy).  I marinated my partially frozen flank steak for 9 hours and cooked it under the broiler in my oven.  It came out SOOO good, by far the best I've had.  Even my VERY picky kids enjoyed it.

I am not sure how I have gone so long without grilling a flank steak...  this is delicious.  Easy too.  I knew when I was mixing up the ingredients for the marinade that it would have a teriyaki flavor.  Yummy!  I used low-sodium soy sauce and didn't feel any extra salt was needed.    I marinated the steak for about 10 hours.  My husband and I felt it had plenty of flavor.   The flank steak wasn't expensive and considering the left-overs - it is a good deal and something I will make again.

This was fastastic! I marinated a large flank steak for 2 days and it came out so tender and delicious. I am going to try it out on a top round steak and see if it comes out as good as flank steak. I followed the recipe exactly as written.

I used this as a marinade for rib eye steak and it was truly delicious...maybe just a bit salty so I'll cut back on the soy sauce a little next time.  I'm planning on using the leftovers as steak strips for a mixed greens/tomato salad.

This is delicious!  I used 1 Tbsp. olive oil and 1 Tbsp. sesame seed oil, following another reviewer's suggestion.  Mine was a very large flank steak, so I cut it in two and grilled the first half after soaking in the marinade for 7 hours.  Tonight we'll enjoy the second half which has been in the marinade for two days.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  It's a keeper!

I followed this recipe exact with no changes and  did not care for this much. The marinade itself does not taste bad and the meat was very tender but it completely covers up the taste of the steak. The soy sauce is too much. I don't really enjoy the asian taste when i eat steak. If you enjoy that type of flavor you will most likely enjoy this marinade. I may try this for an oriental steak stir fry but not on a real steak. Thanks for sharing though

Wow ! I marinated 7 Lbs. of flank steak in this marinade for almost 2 days for my Mexican themed dinner. It was fabulous ! Really... don't use anything but fresh garlic, onions and grated fresh ginger. Flavors are more pronounced, and makes a big difference.  Everyone now wants the recipe !

love the recipe. i left out the lemon juice and also used round steak. i cut it up like fajita meat and marinated it for an hour and then fried it in a bit of olive oil and served it on beef fried rice. we loved it so much we made it 3 times the first week. it was like chinese food without going to the restaraunt.

Very good.  A bit salty and I used not quite 1/2 cup soy sauce (like other people recommended).  Next time I will try low-sodium sauce.  Also, instead of 2T olive oil, I used 1T olive and 1T sesame oil.  For the T of minced onion I used the whites of two green onions because I needed to use them up.  Other than that I followed this recipe as written.  Oh, and I fried it in a cast iron skillet instead of grilling it.  It was delicious and I will definately make this again.

I really enjoyed the flavors in this marinade, but found it too salty.  Next time I think that I will make it with reduced sodium soy sauce to see if that helps balance out the saltiness.

I've been using this recipe for years, or almost this recipe.  Instead of brown sugar, I use homey and in place of lemon juice, vinegar best for me. It's wonderful and I call it my "company" steak.  Everyone thinks there is something magic about it.

Thank you for submitting and I think I did something wrong...I think I may have just wasted two bacon wrapped filets on this marinade.  I made it exactly except for the onions.  I think the onions might have added some necessary sugar that my marinade lacked?  It was sooooo soy saucy.  Should you only use this on tougher cuts?

This was an amazing marinade. The only one in the family that didn't like it was the dog, because there wasn't a scrap of steak left. Excellent job.

We didn't care much for this marinade.  I marinated it for about 24 hours and the meat was very tender. However, even though I used reduced sodium soy sauce, it was still way too salty for our taste.

Umm... not so good. It was overwhelming and had too much soy sauce. I like to taste the actual steak when eating it. Better find a different marinade.

I used this with a flatiron steak.  I let it marinate for about 8 hours, and I could really tell where it had soaked in.  It made for a very tasty steak, but as the description suggests, I'd let it marinate for a couple days next time to allow the flavor to really soak in.

This was a yummy marinade, and is best if you let the meat sit in the marinade overnight in the fridge.  Be sure not to overcook the meat though!

The first time I used this marinade was on London Broil.  I marinaded overnight and it was tasty but the London Broil was not tender.  The second time I marinaded Flank Steak overnight and oh what a difference.  The Flank Steak was not only tasty, but sooo tender.  Will be using again and might try Skirt Steak for a change.

This is EXCELLENT. Used to marinate a couple of flat iron steaks. Incredible flavor, and we only had time to marinate for about 4 hours.
Highly recommend!

I put this in the broiler and it was delicious.  It would probably be even better on an outdoor grill, but we really liked this marinade.  My daughter loves flank steak, and I am no longer intimidated to make it.

Great Marinade.  This will go in the recipe box.  Unforunately, I decided to make this last minute and only marinated the steak for 4 hours.  This ended up being a good thing because it gave it the perfect amount of flavor  great job!

Good basic marinade, nothing spectacular.  I didn't make any changes and my flank steak turned out flavorful and moist.  It was a little salty, and I did use light soy.

I’ve been making this flank steak recipe for years. Finally taking the time to review it. It taste best with at least 24 hours to marinade up to 48 if you have the time. It’s very flavorful, tenderizes the meat and is delicious! I usually grill it on the grill and serve it with grilled asparagus and brown rice. It’s a hit with the whole family and in regular rotation for our weekly meals.

This was so good, I tried two recipes, because I had two steaks, this one , was perfectly flavorful, cooked to perfection over a hot grill for 4 min per side. I will make again. When you use a recipe that calls for wine (not this one), so often it is the quality of the wine that makes or breaks the marinade, but when you eliminate  it, no worries. I love this recipe.

This is a great flavorful marinade as is.  The thing that you must remember when preparing flank steak is that it really doesn’t require long marinades.  Score the meat, marinade as you would any other cut of meat.  Cook on high heat to no more than medium to medium rare.  The key is in the slicing as was discussed in another review. You need a sharp knife and you must cut at about a 45 degree angle against the grain and slice in about 1/4 inch slices. It will be as tender as can be.  We love flank steak.  We cook it on the grill, in the frying pain and in the Instant Pot (especially good for tacos or fajitas). It is part of our weekly rotation especially if we can get them at a good price.

Delicious, but need to plan ahead for time to marinate. I left it for 24 hours in the fridge. Family all loved it. Will make again. As others had suggested, I cut back on the soy sauce (only 1/4 cup) and added 1/4 cup rice wine vinegar. Otherwise followed recipe as written. I boiled the marinade while steak was resting and reduced it slightly to thicken. Drizzled the sauce  over the meat. Yummy!

Love the marinade. I usually don’t measure ingredients for this one. I also use flat iron steak. This steak can be used for Fajitas, salads, quesadillas, or as a snack when sliced thinly across the grain.

So good!! I didn’t have time to marinate the steak but I made this sauce & cooked fresh mushrooms in it for ~8 minutes, then cooked the steak dry with salt and pepper, on high, 4 minutes each side. Poured the marinade and mushrooms over the steak.... amazing.

This is a keeper.  Made exactly as the recipe called for and everyone loved it.  Chose this recipe because of its simplicity and availability of on-hand ingredients.  It was a good choice and I will definitely use this recipe again.  I specifically searched flank steak since it was my first time preparing this cut of meat.  I marinated for a day.  Maybe next time, I will try marinating a little longer, only out of curiosity and comparison.

Good marinade, but a bit salty for our tastes. I made the recipe without changes, but next time I would add another liquid to dilute the soy sauce.

Hands down, this is my wife and my favorite flank steak marinade. It calls for six hours, but we usually stretch it out to eight hours for best results.

I made this recipe as instructed and thought it was outstanding!  I did let it marinade over 2 days and the flavor was intense and delicious.  We use to buy a marinaded flank steak from our local butcher, not any longer! I've continued to make this and have expanded to using it on pork loin and even chicken...it's both amazing and versatile!

Very good marinade. Followed recipe closely, merely using dehydrated onions instead of fresh. Marinated 2 -1/2lbs 48 hours. Flavorful and juicy. My three-year-old loved it too.

I am sad to say that I used this Marinade tonight on fresh salmon. I was not overly happy with it. I will try it again but with more brown sugar or may use maple syrup instead.

Great marinade! Try using a slow cooker which eliminates the marinade time.  Double the marinade, trim the steaks, cut steaks into 2 inch cubes then put them in the slow cooker. Stir in the marinade, making sure the meat is covered.  Heat on LOW for about 3 hours or just until meat is really tender.  Serve over rice, noodles or potatoes.

I looked for a flank steak marinade but did not want to go to the store.  I had everything on this list and so I gave it a try. It was easy to make and everyone loved the flavor.  I marinated it for about 10 hours.

I made this with only one change: I used 1/2 a packet of dry onion soup mix instead of minced onion. It was fabulous. I marinated T-bones for about 8 hours and then broiled them. I will definitely use this recipe again.

I used this marinade with pork chops - I doubled the recipe, marinaded them for 2 hours, then baked at 400F for 1 hour and at 300F for another hour.  They were the best ever!

I sometimes substitute red pepper flakes for the pepper, lime juice for the lemon, add about a 1/4 cup chopped cilantro, and 1 tbsp fish sauce for a Thai twist.  I also use G's recipe with Skirt Steak and Brisket.

This turned out AMAZING, I didnt use minced onion because I simply didnt have any. However it was fabulous, I used it on Ribeye, marinated it for six hours and broiled it for about 6 mins on each side...the end result was so juicy and tender there was no need to dip it in anything! Trust me that means A LOT coming from me, I dip everything!!!

Happened to have all of the ingredients for this recipe and took a chance.  I was only able to marinade the steak for an hour and a half but it still did not disappoint.  We ended up grilling naan and pairing it together like a sandwhich...it was wonderful.

Delish! I was skeptical while making the marinade, I thought it would be like a teriyaki, but it wasn't. The soy imparted a lovely flavour along with the other ingredients. All the flavours balanced nicely for a delicious flank steak. This will be a staple for my flank steaks.

This was a good recipe. Be sure to marinade a few hours so the steak receives the full flavor. If you don't love ginger consider taking it out so the other flavors will be stronger.

SO good...  made my butterflied flank steaks tender and delicious.  i substituted the ginger... i only had nutmeg.  i marinated for about 24 hours and broiled in on an open hearth/roaster for v-day, and served them with some blackened green beans.  we definitely will be making this again.  thanks for a great recipe!

Very good! I used this for a top round London broil and let it sit in the fridge for 2 days. I cooked the meat on my cast iron grill pan on the stove and it turned out really well. I used fresh ginger and dried onion flakes but other than that followed exactly. Thanks - I'll use this again!!

My husband and I have never had flank steak but decided to try it with this marinade. We were both so pleased with how tender it was and the flavor was so good. I did marinade it for two days and used veg oil. We carved it real thin and enjoyed every bite. Thanks Tim!

What a great marinade! Absolutely delicious. The whole family loved it. I did this very last minute, and only had enough time to marinate for about 2 hours, and it was still very flavorful and tender! (Note: slice thin and against the grain.)

This was fantastic. We ordered a quarter cow and had a few cuts of meat that we weren't sure what to do with them. This had a great flavor and left the meat so tender. Thanks for the great recipe!

OK marinade--reminded me a bit of a teriyaki marinade I used to love that a local restaurant carried years ago before it closed, but overall, it wasn't anything special. We used a low sodium tamari sauce after reading the reviews about too much salt, added more brown sugar, and marinated it 18 hours. May still make it again, but am looking for something better.

This is my husbands favorite steak marinade. It seems like the longer it marinades the better the steak is. It is always so tander and we never eat a steak without it no matter what the cut is!

Excellent! Was looking everywhere for a good steak marinade that didn't include liquid smoke (we prefer our smoke flavor to come from actual wood). This was perfect! Will definitely use again and again during grilling season!

I marinated the flank steak overnight and it was delicious and tender.  Just don't make the mistake I did and salt the meat before grilling, it has plenty of salt already so just use pepper. I will always use this when I make flank steak, great recipe.

I used this recipe to marinate flank steak for 2 days.   Wasn't a huge fan of the cut of meat.  May try it again on a thicker cut of meat, had good flavor overall.

The only reason that I put 4 stars is that I used only half of the required soy sauce, and if I had used all of it, I'm afraid this would have been a one-star meal.  But there was just enough soy sauce and it was simply DELICIOUS!!!  Next time I'll double the quantity of everything - meat and all, it was that good - and add dried raisins to  the marinade.  Yummy.  Thanks a lot!

I've been using this recipe for a while and have been meaning to rate it. This is the only steak marinade I'll use anymore. I like to cut steak (any kind)  for skewers and marinade the veggies along w/ the meat. YUM!

If I could, I would rate this 6 stars!  This is the best steak I have ever served or eaten.  Everyone of my skinny, health-conscious, athletic friends (who are normally suspicious of red meat) asked for seconds.  I prepared the marinade as described and set the meat in it for 24 hours.  We grilled the steaks to the liking of each of our guests and sat back to enjoy the praise they lavished on the meal.

Wow is this good!  I marinated a London Broil for about 9 hours and then put it under the broiler for 10 minutes on each side.  It came out rare, juicy, and delicious.  Definitely my new London Broil marinade, nothing else has been this good.  Wouldn't change a thing about it.

This was a great marinade.  I used it for some NY Strip steaks today and the guys loved it.  The only thing I didn't add in was the ginger because my husband doesn't like it. His buddies commented on how juicy and flavorful the steaks were and wanted to know what was in the marinade.  I will use this again! Thanks for a great recipe.

Yum.  Had a big BBQ event w/ friends.  Marinated the flank steaks almost 2 days exactly as recipe states.  Grilled up for approx 7 mins on each side over medium heat and had fabulously tender med-rare steaks that just melted in your mouth!!!  I also used the recipe (minus the lemon juice - 1/2 teriyaki,1/2 soy) on chicken breast and it was delish!!!

Delicious!  I got my flank steak a day ahead and marinated it overnight.  Six minutes per side and it was juicy and flavorful.  This was my first flank steak and it was good!!!!

I didn't have time to marinade the entire time and only did it for 3 hours.  Other than the time I followed it exactly. 
It is the first recipe that my husband has not altered after it was cooked.  He loved it.  AMAZING!!!

I love this recipe. I have been making for a long time.  I always use it for our port tenderloins.  I marinade it over night and serve it with white rice.  My kids love it.  Even my husband who is a picky eater and does not like soy sauce loves it.  Thanks for sharing!

Made this tonight and only had an 1 hr to marinade. I used meat tenderizer to speed up the process. It was very good and flavorful, however, it could have stood to marinade a bit longer which may make it a 5.

Very easy, very tasty marinade. Although I have eaten many (good and bad) marinades on meat... this is first one I chose to make. Used flank steak, turned out wonderful. Made in broiler... about 6 minutes on each side. DO NOT overcook. Suberb!

We used dark soy and I think it would have been better with regular, but still very tasty.  Makes a cheap steak much much better

So good, and tender.  I only marinated for the six hours and was glad I made dinner at home instead of giving into the temptation to go to Sizzler.  The first meal my husband has cleaned his plate over in a long time.  I used lime juice instead of lemon.

Great flavor!  My husband, who is not a steak fan, loved it.  After making the marinade, I put some of it aside and  brushed it on the steak while it was on the grill.

I used this recipe on a piece of Sirloin tip cut into kabob size chunks, marinaded it for approximately 6 hours. Absolutely delicious after skewered with my veggies and grilled. This is definitely a keeper!  Only thing is next time I will save a little of the marinade (save before mixing with the beef) for basting. I had to resort to another recipe, soysauce, brown sugar, all spice and water to keep everything moist.  DELICIOUS! Thanks for a great recipe, we LOVE to make kabobs!

I loved the overall flavor of this recipe.  The only thing I changed was to use low sodium soy sauce.  Other than that followed recipe exactly.  The recipe calls for the flank steak to be marinated for, "at least 6 hours".  I marinated for about 11 hours.  Next time I will only marinade it for about 6 hours as while the flavor was wonderful it was a little strong.  Also, I had never tried flank steak before and it is pretty good.  I will definitely buy flank steak again and use this marinade.

Yummy, but as others noted, pretty salty.  I'm looking forward to trying this again w/low sodium soy sauce and maybe a little extra brown sugar.

Used this for a London Broil which we marinated for about 30 hours.  Halved the olive oil and the ginger, and used low sodium soy sauce.  Perfect!  Thank you.

Used a beef skirt steak.  Marinated for 9 hours.  Grilled on my George Foreman grill.  Excellent flavor and very tender.  I didn't find it too salty as some other reviews stated.  Thought it might have a strong Asian flavor since it had soy and ginger in the marinade.  Not a strong flavor at all but would be good with Jasmine rice.  Tonight we sliced it up and served on toasted rolls (like Philly steak sandwiches).  Thanks for the recipe.  I will definitely use again.

I used a beef cut I hadn't heard of before-flap steak. Got it from my local warehouse store and was absolutely thrilled with it on the grill. Tender, juicy, and a hit.
