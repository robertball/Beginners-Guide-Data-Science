It SOUNDS very tasty, but there is no clear explanation of what is meant by pomegranate pulp.

If it does not include the "nut" in each seed, the dessert would be runny.  However, a lot of people do not like to eat the seeds - are they left intact? crushed?  pureed?

Just  not clear enough.

Simple, delicious and refreshing. My only concern is labeling this recipe a dessert. Many Mideast cultures eat fruit for dessert (I assume that region is the inspiration for this dish) and I certainly enjoy it as one, but for those with a major sweet tooth, they might find the recipe unsatisfying as is. If I were presenting this to guests I would either a)serve it as an appetizer instead (it's light and really cleans the palate) or b) serve it as a dessert with a twist. I love it atop rich, dark chocolate ice cream, but it can also be good on gourmet ice cream flavors like cardamon or rose. Next time, though, I plan to utilize it as a pomegranate shortcake - i.e. spoon some of the pomegranate into a glass, add a small slice of pound cake, top with whip cream and a drizzle of honey. Can't wait! Oh, two tips: 1) Remove pomegranate seeds over the sink. It's a messy procedure and the juice easily stains. 2) I've only been able to find rosewater in Persian/Arab stores (it comes in a bottle.) You really need it for this dish, so make the effort to find and buy it. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I built this recipe entirely in the blender, blending the fruit first and adding the rest of the ingredients after. I imagine a blentec or similar high-end blender could get this dreamily smooth. It tastes excellent, but I only made a half batch, having only one pomegranate.

i eat a lot of pomegranates so i just wanted to find another way to eat them. this is obviously so simple! i just never thought of putting these ingredients together. Just adding sugar and lemon juice is what did it for me.
