I was very unsure of myself with this recipe, which I tried bc I needed to bring finger foods to a grad party that was vegetarian.  These turned out to be very easy, and well recieved at the party.  I don't care for olives and when I tried these, I thought they were very good.  I used white bread and also a whole grain bread, make sure your breads are dense and not overly soft, as this makes the sandwiches easier to assemble and easier for guests to eat.

We loved these.  I did not put as much of the olive mixture into each sandwich as they indicated so I made about 10 sandwiches and I think that kept them from being overwhelming.  I also put cream cheese on both sides of the bread.

Ok, I screwed up....LOL...what I thought were sun dried tomatoes were actually roasted red peppers, but I used em anyways.  I really did like this recipe, although it is strong tasting....not for everyone.  I would definitely make these again....for a party, as I am always looking for new, unique ideas.  I also used whole wheat bread as that's what I had and put the cream cheese on both sides.

Very good but extremely powerful.  You can only eat so much.  Also very filling.  Would probably be better if fresh veggies were added.
