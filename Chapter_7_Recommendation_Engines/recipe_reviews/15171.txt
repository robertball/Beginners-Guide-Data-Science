I LOVE this recipe!  I've made this recipe several times, and my favorite way to make them is to double the recipe, press the peanut butter part in a 9 x 9 glass pan, pour the melted chocolate over top, refrigerate, and then cut into small squares when thoroughly chilled.  It saves the time of forming each ball and dipping them.

I made this for the Ohio State football game last Saturday.  I read most of the reviews and here are my tips.  Only use 3 cups of powdered sugar if you don't sift it.  Only add 1 cup at a time.  The first cup you can use with a spoon, but the second and third cups use your hands it is so much easier.  Then after you roll them into balls, put the tooth picks in and then put them in the fridge.  I just melted the chocolate in the microwave (in a plastic container with a lid setting on top) because it is so much easier and quicker.  Just do it 30 seconds at a time until melted.  Then you dip the balls in the chocolate leaving a little of the peanut butter showing at the top so it looks like a real buckeye nut.  Do not cover the entire ball with chocolate.  If you don't like the tooth pick hole showing, just smooth it with your finger.  But honestly these are so delicious, who cares if there is a tooth pick hole.  Hope these tips help.  Thanks

Wonderful but don't do as I did and make the mistake of not knowing that 4 cups of "sifted" sugar is much less than 4 cups of actual sugar right out of the box. I had to double my other ingredients to make it come out right. Stupidity on my part! But they turned out great!

This is perfect!  Here's the scoop on them being dry.  You need to very carefully measure your ingredients.  What I do is put all the powdered sugar except for the last cup.  Mix it all together and slowly add the last cup of powdered sugar if needed.  This will ensure that you get the perfect rollable texture each and every time!

This is a great recipe.  But I did cut the sugar down as suggested. I also upped the Peanut butter by a 1/2 cup for a more peanutty taste. I have made these every Christmas for the past 10 years.  I also roll them place them on a cookie sheet and then stick the toothpick in the middle and freeze them.  When the milk chocolate is melted, easy to dip, and to cover the toothpick hole, I dip my finger in water and rub over to hole.  Seals up very quickly.

These were Awesome! Anyone that loves peanutbutter will love these! And they are relatively easy to make.  Can be a little time consuming having to roll each one however, i've made far more time consuming candies that don't taste half as good as this.  This is a really simple recipe to follow also.  

After I rolled them into balls, I froze them for about 30min and they were very easy to dump a few in a time into my bowl of melted chocolate and fish out with a fork. I then froze them again to get them to set and packaged them up in their containers and now they sit in my frigerator ready to be given out.

All I can say is WOW!!!!!  These are the best I have ever tasted!!!  Even better than the bakery down the road that is noted for them(Just had one yesterday so I would have something to compare it to).  I did change a few things though, I did decrease the 10x sugar to three cups like some other reviews had suggested, and I used milk chocolate instead of semi sweet.  I also decreased the shortening by half and used a full pound of chocolate. Better to be safe than sorry!!!
Thanks Allison!!

Why didn't I listen???  Four cups (sifted) was way too much sugar. Mine were very dry and crumbly. I used Jif and blue bonnet if that helps anyone. I'll definitely try again with 3 cups of sugar.

Speed it up: A cup and a half of peanut butter is about one 16 oz. jar.  No need to measure. 6 oz. of chocolate chips is a cup.  Unless you're trying to please someone from Ohio, save time and effort by spreading the peanut stuff in a 9 in. pan lined with parchment paper, and spread the chocolate over.  When chilled, lift out by the paper, and cut into about 36 pieces. I reduced the sugar to 3 cups and they taste great.  Might try half Splenda next time. Might try cutting into little hearts for Valentines.

These turned out absolutely perfect. I used my small cookie scoop to make uniform balls. I froze my balls for an hour or so before dipping them in the melted chocolate. Very simple for me to make with little hands and the boys can't keep their hands off of them. They tell me this is their new favorite recipe. Better than Reese's.

By far, these are the BEST sweet treats of the Christmas season!  Living in the "Buckeye State" of Ohio all my life, these have been a staple in our Christmas kitchen.  This recipe is nearly identical to the family recipe I'm used to.  The nice addition of vanilla is the only difference.  It helps if you add the powdered sugar about one cup at a time.  That way, you can control how stiff the dough gets;  you won't have to worry about adding too much powdered sugar and scrambling to add more peanut butter or other ingredient.  Don't try to mix the dough with a spoon, because you'll break or bend it (plus mixing with your hands is fun!)  Buckeyes always impress friends and family, and homemade ones are much less expensive than store-bought ones.

For the p.b./chocolate fan these are great.  Just a note, as a time-saver, the peanut mixture can be pressed into a pan with the melted chocolate poured over and served as a bar.

I loved this recipe and made it twice as written and it tasted like sin (VERY good). My family raved and wanted the recipe. I saw where many people complained about the sugar amount etc..and dryness. Well I will say that firstly, confectioners sugar and peanut butter are two things that are temperature and/or humidity sensitive.  The sugar is sensitive to moisture and as we know..peanut butter is totally different at different temps. So maybe that's why different people had different experiences?..who knows. Anywho...I made this recipe as stated and wouldn't change a thing or reduce the sugar, because if I'm going to eat sweets I go big or go home!

These came out wonderful. Smooth, light and creamy filling and a chocolate mixture that is easy to work with. I made my balls smaller and ended up with about 48, so I had to double the chocolate mixture. I also recommend adding the powdered sugar slowly, because you might not need as much the recipe states.

Wow, what a difference trying these again made. I broke down and bought a non-natural peanut butter this time(Peter Pan-reduced fat) and followed another user's step by adding two tablespoons of water to the peanut butter mixture to aid in forming balls. The water additon made all the difference and I was able to use every single bit of the mixture with no crumbs left over. I only used about 3 1/2 cups of the sugar and added it cup by cup (except the last cup which i sprinkled in until I felt it was enough), mixing in thoroughly each time. Also, I made sure my butter was just softened so that it was the same texture and consistency as the peanut butter.

I had never heard of these before, but wanted to give them a try.....glad I did!!  They were so good, I followed recipe exactly and then after dipping in chocolate, I rolled half of them in toasted pecans, and some in chopped peanuts.  Both were a big hit! Thanks so much!

I cannot begin to tell you how satisfied I was with this incredible recipe.  I took the time to do it right and it was more than I ever expected. Sure you have to take a little extra time mixing all the recipe calls for so you get a creamy and smooth mixture to form balls. I used hershey bars instead of chocolate chips. Friends, the time you put into this will make your mouth beg for more and the hit of any party, holiday or otherwise. Great for Easter...Just shape into eggs and after dipping, decorate. I could not believe the quality and flavor. Just like a genuine old country candy shop. Thank you Allison.

This recipe is great!  I used a cookie scoop to make the balls instead of rolling each one by hand.  The scoop made the perfect shape and each ball was the same size!

These really are fabulous and easy. But be careful about the amount of powdered sugar. I put all 4 cups in and it was too dry. I saved it by adding 1/4 cup more of peanut butter. Try 3 cups, then judge if you think it needs more or not. =)

I'm a transplated Ohioan and I love my Buckeyes at Christmas.  I've had good luck with this recipe but I do drop the sugar to 3 cups sifted (about 14 oz) and I do add 1/8 tsp. salt to the peanut butter mixture.  This takes care of the "too sweet" problem and makes the pb mixture a nice counterpoint to the sweet chocolate (I use milk chocolate) coating.   Now, if anyone can offer a good way to get rid of the big toothpick hole in the top I'd be forever grateful!

I would NOT recommend making these into bars as a reviewer suggested.  I did and they were extremely difficult to get out of the glass pan.  If the bars aren’t really cold, they fall apart.  Even when you serve them, you can’t keep them that cold and they become messy to eat.  The chocolate shell around the peanut butter ball helps hold it together and is easier to serve.  If you do try to make these into bars, a 9 x 9 pan is way too small for a double batch.  Great flavor though.

The only substitution I made on these was to use 14 oz. of chocolate melts instead of the chips and shortening but that did not yield enough chocolate to cover the peanut butter balls.  I found that by freezing the peanut butter balls they were easier to stab with toothpicks, dip and place on the sheet.  I used the back of a spoon, sprayed with cooking spray to eliminate the toothpick hole.  Really cute and very tasty!!!

I added an extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter.  I also wanted to dip them like cake pops so I melted a bag of chocolate chips (11.5 oz) with 2 tablespoons of shortening at 30 second intervals in the microwave on high.  Yum!  :)

An easy way to remember the ingredients is 123 - 1 Lb. butter   2 Lbs. peanut butter and 3Lbs. conf. sugar.  Makes about 100-150 cookies depending on size).  Also instead of shortening mix a half a bar of wax in with the two packs of chocolate chips and it stays on the cookie really well.  If you have extra chocolate it's great to dip fruit in to it.

These couldn't be easier to make! I made a batch last night, we ate one each, and put the rest in the freezer for Christmas. These taste almost as good as a Reese's peanut butter cup! I'll have to say that this is one of the few recipes that I followed and didn't deviate from. It's absolutely perfect as written...5 stars from our RV!

I like a many others found that the mixture ended up being very crumbly and difficult to roll and dip. Freezing them before dipping them in chocolate really helped! I also wished that there was more of the peanut butter flavor. Maybe I should have used less sugar....

Probably not a fair rating, but THANK YOU for this recipe... had a batch of FAILED peanut butter fudge, and in looking to not waste it came across this recipe... followed the chocolate part only and used PB "fudge" rolled into balls, then slightly froze.  DEFINITELY pop these babies in the freezer first.  And I was able to cover mt toothpick holes with the old "double-fisted-toothpick method," one hand is the "spearer" the other hand is the "smearer," and you need to use the smearer to slop a tiny glob of still-melty chocolate over the hole... some of them the chocolate on it will be enough, some you'll have to glob a teeny bit more on from the pan.  Worked for me though.  And these should ship well too, which is what I wanted the PB fudge for to begin with... happy accident I guess!

Delicious!  I ended up only using 3 cups of (non-sifted) powdered sugar....and added a tad more peanut butter.  I did use 1-1/2 c. chocolate chips.   Definite crowd pleaser!

These are awesome!  I changed the recipe only slightly - I used a tad less confectioners sugar and added a 1/2 c. of graham cracker crumbs (from the Buckeyes II recipe - another great one).  My b.f. and brother love the texture that the graham cracker crumbs add (almost like Reese's).  These are delish!!

My husband helped me make these...definately a time-consuming recipe so having someone to help is great!
I meticulously measured but the peanut butter and sugar mixture turned out very dry and crumbly. In order to make smooth and perfectly round balls, I added about 2 tablespoons of water before rolling into balls. The mixture was also so thick that I had to use my electric mixer (with dough attachment).

**These are SO rich. Next time, I will definately make these much smaller.

Only reason I did not give 5 stars was I did as other reviewers and reduced the sugar.  I discovered that 1 box (or 1 lb.) is the perfect amount.  That comes to about 3 1/3 cups.  I don't see how one could use 4 cups, my dough was almost too dry.  But, they turned out beautifully!  My first time making buckeyes, so I am excited!  Thanks for the recipe, Allison.  I will use for my buckeye (or peanut butter balls as we say here in Tennessee Vols country) recipe from now on!

I had to make a little change to this recipe. There was way too much powdered sugar and not enough peanut butter. I ended up using about 2 extra cups of peanut butter. Everybody loved it. It was a big hit.

Delicious and easy recipe!  The ONLY reason this did not get a five star rating, is because the 6 oz. of chips (& shortening) was not near enough to cover the balls.  And no, I did not make huge balls.  Next time, I will definitely use a bigger bag of chips.  I followed the directions to a T.  I highly recommend this recipe.  It's simple, fast and delicious.  But do yourself a favor before making these: Go ahead and buy the next size up of chips.  You'll thank me later.  LOL!

These were really good, but so rich... Next time I make these I will make them smaller so that they are less intimidating. "Golf Ball" size is a bit much ;)

I took the advice of others and only used 2 cups of powder sugar. I also used almond bark to dip in. They turned out GREAT, I now have to make more the holidays.

These taste soooo good! Make sure you sift the confectioner's sugar. I didn't and had to add more peanut butter and butter because it was too crumbly. Also, I would recommend doubling the chocolate and shortening amount. The more chocolate in the pan, the easier it is to dip!

Like others, I used only 3 cups of sugar and then sifted it.  I also use a whole jar of reduced fat pb AND reduced fat butter, and they still turn out wonderfully! After freezing them for 30-60 minutes, they are easy to coat with chocolate.  For the chocolate, I use butter flavored shortening and melt it and the chips in the microwave. I also like to double dip the pb balls to add an extra chocolate layer. This recipe is really easy, and since there are no weird ingredients like graham crackers or anything, these come out silky smooth and not gritty at all. :)

When making the balls, it is so much easier using a small cookie scoop.  This way all the buckeyes are the same size and it takes a fraction of the time.  Trust me, it is worth the $5 to invest in one.
Cookie scoops come in all different sizes, and I use them when making all my cookies.  Depending on the cookie depends on what size scoop I use.

Very Dry, I recommend listening to other reviews and cut back 1 cup of sugar. I ended up adding extra peanut butter and vanilla so I could roll the balls.  Otherwise a good recipe.

Wow! These were great! I used only 3 cups of sugar (because that's all I had) and the dough was not dry or crumbly. So, I would suggest to use only 3 cups of sugar. They turned our perfect! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

Growing up in Ohio (the Buckeye State), these were a favorite Christmas treat. Being disabled, cooking isn't easy for me, so I was pleasantly surprised at how easy this is to make! The balls are even better the second day!

I made these yesterday for the first time and they turned out fantastic.  However, I made a few changes based on the previous reviews:

I used an entire 18 oz jar of peanut butter because it was barely more than 1 1/2 cups. I also only used 3 cups of powdered sugar (but I didn't sift it - oops). And I also used an entire bag of chocolate chips (12 oz.) even though I had a bit of chocolate left over. 4 tbsp of shortening of course.  6 oz definitely wouldn't have been enough. I think they turned out perfect.

Very good recipe!  I used 1/2 chunky & 1/2 honey roasted peanut butter.  I also had to double the chocolate, BUT now that I have properly read the recipe, I realize that you aren't supposed to roll the ball in the chocolate, but dip it (ahhh flip the switch & the light goes on).  The kids loved them & I already have to make more to give to my siblings on Christmas!  Thanks Allison!!

I love these little peanut butter snacks!  I didn't sift the powdered sugar, just used 3 cups right from the box.  I only used 2 teaspoons of crisco instead of tablespoons and used more chocolate.  The toothpick method of dipping didn't work too well for me, so I used a fork and scooped some of the peanut butter balls out.  The fork did leave some "dents" in the chocolate as it hardened, so I drizzled the leftover chocolate over the candy and it made them look very pretty.  I will be making these again!

These were pretty good, but they were a little bit too sweet on the inside for my tastes.  After you dip with a toothpick, you can take your finger and cover up the little hole just by smoothing it over.

We have the nut allergy in our house, so I've learned to tweek many recipes, this being one.  I used Sunbutter in place of the peanutbutter.  I used 2 tsp of vanilla. I also used all 4 cups of confectioners sugar as directed.  I read many reviews and they almost all said that was too much and made the mix much too dry.  Knowing that Sunbutter was much thinner than peanutbutter, I was confident that 4 cups would be perfect, but still mixed in the first three, then added the last cup. After rolling the balls and placing them on wax paper, I put them in the freezer for more then an hour to assure they were chilled.  I melted an entire bag of Nestle milk chocolate chips, no butter and dipped completely.  I then drizzled with butterscotch chips.  They taste delish and look beautiful:)

I made these for a friend from Ohio that helped us plan a trip to Ohio. I only had one cup of peanut butter so the dough was a little dry and crumbly but the turned out fine!

Love these! After rolling into balls I stick toothpicks into them and freeze before dipping in chocolate. Then remove toothpick and put a dab of chocolate over the hole.  I also put them in individual foil cups to make them fancy.

So easy!  I'm not great at coating things in chocolate so I cheated a little - I melted chocolate in a zip top bag, then put a small dot of it onto a piece of parchment, topping it with a Buckeye - thus, the bottom is coated.  I put it in the fridge to set, and when chilled I used the same zip top and covered it from the top, letting the chocolate roll down the side of the Buckeye - I did have to use an offset spatula to smooth it out a bit, but it worked fine.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have to give this 5 stars!  They tasted just like the peanut butter cups you get at the store.  I bake A LOT during the holidays, and there are a lot of things to choose from, however these were the first to go!  I got the recipe a couple weeks ago and I have already made 4 batches.  The only thing I did differently was once they were in the fridge, I just spooned the melted chocolate over them on the cookie sheet.  I found that to be much easier, instead of poking each one with a toothpick and then trying to fish them out later.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Do not be fooled by this recipe.  We were very ecstatic about this recipe, but then it drastically let us down when the peanut butter mixture crumbled in our hands.  We were supposed to be bringing this to a holiday party, but now we have to find a quick alternative in time for the party. The peanut butter mixture was way too dry and extremely sweet.

This was the worst recipe I have ever tried.  It was way too sweet.  Just a little taste made me sick to my stomach.  The dough was very crumbly, I could not make balls out of them.  I had to throw it away before I even dipped it in chocolate.  These are not the buckeyes I know.

This recipe is very quick & easy, and the result is so yummy! I did add an extra teaspoon of vanilla extract because the dough was a little too stiff. I also melted 6 oz. white chocolate with 2 tbsp. of shortening and drizzled over the tops for a professional, beautiful look. I received rave reviews!!!

These were so good!  Worth the time it took to make them, for sure!  Everyone kept asking where I got the recipe for Resse's peanut butter cups!
The one thing I will do differently next time is to double-dip the balls in chocolate - I found they needed more chocolate.  But they were devoured very quickly, & the recipe was handed out several times!

My mother made these when I was a child. Her recipe called for parafin wax instead of shortening. Parafin wax was hard to find but I ran into a wonderful product. I used Ghiradelli Candy Making & Dipping Dark Melting Wafers. Simply melt the wafers in the microwave and dip your buckeyes. The shell dries and hardens quickly. I also used the tips and only used 3 cups of sifted confectioner's sugar! They turned out AWESOME! So much easier than my mother's recipe.

These were fantsic! The only thing I did different was put my chocolate and shortening in a small crock pot on warm while the buckeyes were chilling. Stir every once in a while. It worked great! I didnt have to worry about the chocolate mixture solidifying before I got all the buckeyes dunked. And FYI make a double batch. they go fast.

only use 3 cups powdered sugar...keep hands wet to keep balls from sticking.  Used Ghiradelli chocolate and did not use paraffin (used mixture of dark and milk chocolate).  turned out great.  Would be good with all dark chocolate.

I've made this recipe several times and they taste delicious!  A few tips that I have found that make it easier are; insert the toothpicks before placing in the freezer.  If you leave them in the freezer longer than 30 minutes the toothpicks DO NOT go in, resulting in broken toothpicks and frustration :) Also there is absolutely no need to mix ingredients with your hands.  Although it may work for some, I'm all about clean and quick.  I use the small pampered chef scoop, which gives you the perfect bite sized buckeyes!

"THIS IS AWESOME"
 TIP- I used a hobart mixer with the dough hook attachment. I put the four cups of sifted confectioner sugar in first,followed by Peanut butter,butter and vanilla.
Turned mixer on one then slowly progressed to higher speeds scrapping sides of bowl while mixing, stopping once to mix in sugar in bottom of the bowl.This works really well!!!

These were really good. Since I love Peanut Butter I decreased the powder sugar to 3 cups like someone else suggested and they were fantastic. My BF loved them and he is not a big fan of sweets. Making a double batch today.

So yummy!  I used the 3 cups of confectioners sugar unsifted.  I also sprinkled a little course sea salt on the chocolate coating of the buckeyes before putting them into the refrigerator.

I have made these types of treats since I was a kid. This recipe is different than the one I always used because it calls for more sugar and butter. I was a little concerned because the consistency was so different when rolling into balls, but I think I have found a new recipe because these were just decadent. Thanks!

These came out pretty good, but even after only adding 3 cups sugar and adding in more peanut butter, the dough was a little crumbly.  I was able to roll them up okay though.  I put them in the freezer for about an hour, then dipped them in the chocolate, completely covering them, like truffles, instead of having the top show.  The flavor is pretty good, but I almost think it needs a little more sugar, but if I would have added more I don't think they would have rolled up nicely.  I might make again and play around with the recipe some more.

Very delicious buckeye balls.  Easy to make too!  The only problem i had was that I didn't realize the recipe called for sifted confectioners sugar.  I added extra peanut butter to make up for the dryness, and they turned out great except that occassionally I find small clumps of the sugar in the peanut butter.  Next time I make them they will be perfect!

This is the first review I have aver posted on this site. These were so easy to make and so yummy!! Even my 3 yr. old helped. I made them as stated the first time and they were great. I do agree that more chocolate is needed to coat all the balls. Second time I upped the peanut butter to 2 cups and then they were perfect.

OK I have not made them yet, but this coming weekend I plan on making them and doing what I do best..!! Be creative and unique like always.. I plan on instead of using the toothpick, I'll use pretzel sticks and coat them with the chocolate..!! At the tip of the pretzel will be clear and then chocolate all the way down.. not only that, I may just use white chocolate to dip them in.. :)

I made these today, tasted great. Made a few alterations... I added 3 cups non-sifted powdered sugar and a whole 18oz container of Jiffy creamy peanut butter. If you use the 1 1/2 cup of peanut butter then don't use all the sugar it will make the mix to dry and it will crumble. I also use Almond Bark (for all my chocolate coverings)instead of morsels. Melts down great and has a nice sheen when dry. Best of luck!

I followed it exactlly. Only needed 3 c sugar. These are better then reeses cups. I took the same recipe and added mini choc chips at end. Press mixture into lined swallow pan. chill and cut into small sqares. dip each sq into choc. place on wax paper to harden. you might need more choc. Only use 1tbl of shortening. makes choc thicker. These make the best pb, choco chip melt aways.

I tried the ideas shared by others to increase the peanut butter and decrease the powedered sugar and had horrible results! So, I went back and made them according to the recipe and they were terrific! I used almond bark to coat them, very easy. I also stuck a toothpick in each ball and froze them before dipping them in the melted chocolate. They keep very well in the freezer. That's my hiding place! Great recipe, thanks!

A little time consuming, but worth it. Be sure to let the peanut butter balls chill before dipping or you will have a big mess. Gave these as Christmas gifts and they were a big hit.

These were good, but there is too much shortening in the chocolate.  It made the buckeyes tacky to the touch unless they were kept in the refrigerator.  I would use half the shortening (or maybe even none at all) next time.

I think this recipe is good, but it was more work than I had anticipated.  Definitely make the balls on the small side and work the dough by hand.  I have a commercial mixer and it was too soft even after chilling the dough.

Added an extra quater cup of peanut butter and beat the mixture on high for 2 minutes to make them extra creamy and fluffy. Also, it took me 3 cups of chocolate chips!

Recipe was very easy and yummy!  I followed others' suggestions and froze the balls for 30 minutes with toothpicks already inserted. After dipping, the toothpicks came out easily with a quick twist, and the holes covered up easily with water. I used 3 1/2 cups of powdered sugar.

I add a little more peanut butter than what's listed and just work it alot wit my hands to absorb some of the extra oil. It makes it tastes stronger and is easier to shape, otherwise I find the "dough" gets dry

This recipe works great.  I think it’s fool proof because I only had 1-1/4 c of peanut butter and it still turned out.  I only used 3 c of powdered sugar (packed).  I have never made candy or worked with melted chocolate before, so this was more time consuming than I was prepared for.  I also burned myself on the chocolate a million times and made a mess.  I made my balls small because I thought a big bite of sugary peanut butter might not be delicious.  A couple tips: if your chocolate isn’t sticking to the balls or it seams too thick, make sure your chocolate is hot enough (the warmer it gets, the thinner) and your peanut butter is cold enough (it starts to sweat if it gets warm and that makes the chocolate less likely to stick well, definitely stick ‘em in the fridge for at least a half hour before dipping them in the chocolate.) I used toothpicks for dipping; the holes annoyed me.  I had to use a gazillion chocolate chips because of how small I wanted my balls. I actually ran out of semi sweet chocolate chips, so I used milk chocolate for the second half.  I like how they look with the 2 different chocolates.  BIG TIP!!! ~ Don’t leave the toothpicks in the balls when you refrigerate them.  When I tried to pull them out the next day several broke, leaving half the pick in the ball. Don’t be discouraged by all my complaints, the recipe is really good, I’m just impatient and not really detail oriented enough to enjoy the intricacies of chocolate dipping.  ;)

Good recipe. Instead of making calls, I spread the PB mix into a pan, then made a layer of chocolate above and served as squares. Less time consuming than the balls.

The ABSOLUTE best!!!  I used one cup less of  UNSIFTED confectioners sugar and I cheated by doubling the recipe, flattening out the dough with a rolling pin, refrigerating the flattened dough, pouring the melted chocolate on top, refrigerating again, then using a pizza cutter to cut individual servings.  So much easier, less messy, and quicker than rolling individual balls and just as good!!   Thanks for this recipe!!!

I made these yesterday for the upcoming holidays; however, I agree with previous reviewers...definitely sift your powdered sugar and only use 3 cups...I used four and it was too sugary tasting. Also, I used 12 ounces of chocolate versus the 6 ounces stated...and just added almonds to the leftover chocolate for a quick slab of chocolate almond bark for hubby since I wouldn't let him have any of the Buckeye Balls til Christmas!

Turned out great with a few changes: as past reviewers have said, 4 cups of confectioners' sugar is too much- I used about 3 cups; also, there is no need for shortening...the chocolate will stick just fine without it; this works best if you can keep the chocolate melted over a double boiler. Yum!

I LOVE buckeyes, so I used this recipe as a Halloween idea.  After rolling the peanut butter into balls, I stuck 4 pretzel pieces into each one to make the legs of a spider.  Then I froze the balls before dunking the whole "spider" in melted dark chocolate.  After that set, I used red gel to add eyes.  The combination of salty pretzels and sweet buckeyes is awesome...I'm not sure if the spiders are going to last until the party!

They were very good, but too crumbly. Next time I make them I think I will back off the powdered sugar by at least a cup and make sure my peanut butter mixture is smooth and not crumbly.

These are really good with one modification. I did take everyones advice and only used 3cups of powdered sugar. It was plenty sweet enough so I think 4 might have been too much. I didn't find these too awful time consuming and they were really easy. The mixing with your hands gets a little messy, but I don't think it would've been possible with a spoon alone. These are definately a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

These are sooooo good!  The PB center is just the right consistency and none of those "weird" ingredients like graham crackers!  I followed other reviewers advice and reduced the 10X sugar to 3 C.  I also increased PB to 1 C and will probably add still more next time.  These were a little time consuming and my presentation isn't the best, but I'm sure both will improve as I continue to experiment w/this recipe.  I melted my choc chips in the microwave (45 sec, stir, 30 sec).  The first time I used 1/2 bag of milk choc chips w/the shortening.  Next time, just the chips.  Finally, semi sweet mini chips (yes, all 3 "batches" of choc covering for 1 batch of balls....about 1 1/4 bags of chips and I used it all).  This made about 86 smallish balls for me.  Thanks for a great recipe!  I made the balls and then placed in freezer for 30 min, consistency was fine for dipping.

WONDERFUL! A huge hit - they were gone in a flash!  I didn't use any shortening and the chocolate set up beautifully fine. I also used dark chocolate per my own preference.  These will be a holiday staple for many years!!!!

Yummy!  These were easy to make, but be prepared to let the mixture set for several hours in the refrigerator before rolling- even overnight if you have time.

These were good but should of followed others suggestion to cut back on sugar because they became very crumbly and difficult to roll into balls, i ended adding more peanut butter and a little vanilla to bind them a better.  The next time i will definately cut back on the sugar by a cup.  Thanks for the recipe it is a great starter!

I am a Buckeye (Ohio State!) and made these for the big game tomorrow! There is absolutely nothing I would change about this recipe. They are SUPPOSED to be sweet like that, so I think the 4 cups of sugar shouldn't be altered. They are very yummy and take me back to my childhood. Thanks so much for the great recipe.

YUMMY!!!  Creamy and smooth were the first thoughts that came to mind when I ate one of these "pieces of heaven".  My sister and I made these for the upcoming OSU/Michigan Game (GO BUCKS!) and have also made them for our cookie trays at Christmas time.  Always a hit with everyone who eats them!!

The dough is much too crumbly to work with.  The chocolate sauce measurements aren't correct for the amount of peanut balls you get.  It isn't enough.  Very displeased with this recipe!

These are excellent!  Quick and easy, and a great taste!!  I shortened it even further by using dipping chocolate I found at the grocery store.  These will become a staple around here!!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent recipe!  I did add a little extra peanut butter (the 1 1/2 cups used almost a whole small jar of peanut butter so I just added the remaining peanut butter); I also put toothpicks directly into each ball and put them in the freezer to harden before dipping . . . I would advise using a little extra chocolate - the 6 oz. was EXACTLY enough - none to spare. Great recipe - will make again

Okay, so the only reason I gave this 3 stars is because it was TOO MUCH SUGAR! 4 cups, I thought, was out of control. Next time I will reduce to @2 1/2 cups....I guess I like more peanut buttery taste. Took these to work and they were gone fast. Will make again.

Made these for Christmas treats.  I thought they were a little too sweet however everyone that I gave them to loved them......especially the young adults in my family.  Next time I will make them a little smaller in size and maybe they won't seem so sweet.

These are a little too rich for my taste, but my son eats them one after another.  They took a very long time to make.  I felt that it was worth the effort, though, because they are so impressive-looking.  I suggest doubling the chocolate-dipping portion of the recipe.  I ran out half way through the dipping process.  I also melted the chocolate and crisco in the microwave in a glad tupperware container, covered loosely with the tupperware lid.  Micro for a minute on high and then stir.

easy to make,but too sweet.
these were more like a very sweet candy than a cookie.
dipping them in chocolate with a toothpick didn't work,they fall off.
Also they didn't harden in the fridge,I had to put them in the freezer.

WONDERFUL! I've tried other recipes and this is  
the BEST. Great taste.  I used  1/2 creamy and 1/2 crunchy peanut butter, my family loved it. 
I only used 3 cups confectioners sugar.

I've been looking for this recipe for years.  It didn't disappoint at all.  It was a little time consuming, sifting the sugar and rolling & dipping the balls.  However, the end result was worth the time.  It is much more of a candy than a cookie, in my opinion.  These are ALWAYS a huge it at holiday parties.

I had to add a little extra peanut butter and butter to get this dough to come together, but it was a FANTASTIC outcome.  I had to rush a pan to the freezer to save them from my family.  I like the shortening better than parafin in the chocolate because the coating doesn't come out waxy.  Set aside an evening when you have nothing else to do, though, because these are a little time-consuming ... but worth it.

I've  made Buckeyes for many years.  This year I saw the review/comments by "Ali"(?) stating she made them in a 9X9 pan.  I thought this was a great way to not have to make them into all those "buckeye" balls.  However, following her suggestion - I would do this differently next time....A) Either DON'T DOUBLE THE RECIPE in a 9X9 .....(X?) 9"X9"X2" glass pan. B) I will use a larger glass pan - rectangular 9"X13"X2".  They taste great - but the smaller pan, w/a doubled recipe.......makes the treat deeper and "too much" for such a sweet treat.  It's really helpful to any of us when we want to use someone's "GREAT IDEA" that they give us enough info and it does make a difference in the finished result.  We all "learn from our experiences" - so I hope this helps the next person that doesn't need to make buckeyes LOOK like buckeyes but still a superb holiday speacialty dessert.

Super easy and delicious!  Although, it's important to follow the instruction to use "4 cups of SIFTED powdered sugar." If you don't, you'll end up at least doubling your batch, which is what I did.  By the time I got that kink worked out, I had added quite a bit of extra peanut butter.  The balls would have held their shape better with less peanut butter, but they were amazing.   I will probably always add at least a little extra.

Turned out just like my mom's!  I made it a little easier on myself and just put the toothpicks in every ball and suck them in the freezer till the cooled. About 15 minutes.  Then I dipped them in the chocolate and removed the toothpick.  I will be making then again next year!

These were surprisingly easy to make and I'm a pretty lousy baker so I was pleased to have something cutesy to take to holiday dinners.  I took a picture of mine, they are on the blue plate (you know, that ubiquitous china pattern) so you can see that they turned out quite pleasant looking.  Some of the pictures appear like the buckeyes were made by savages and I was concerned cause usually my stuff looks worse than all the pictures but, nope.  Pretty easy and good payoff.  They are ridiculously sweet, of course.

So yummy!  I followed the recipe exactly but didn't sift the powered sugar.  Turned out great. At first, they seemed a little too sweet.  But once the balls were in the fridge for a couple of days it seemed the refrigeration helped with that.  I'm expecting these to be a crowd pleaser this evening for Christmas Eve dinner.

I've made several versions of buckeyes before, and this was my least favorite.  It just wasn't very  peanut buttery. Too much powdered sugar and butter, too little peanut butter.

Excellent recipe!  Not too sweet like some other buckeye recipes I've tried.  Be sure to sift the powdered sugar first.  I also creamed the butter and peanut butter well before adding the powdered sugar.  I like to make my peanut butter balls small (3/4"); then I freeze them for about 20 minutes before dipping them.  This makes them much easier to handle.

For the sugar problem: 4cu sifted = 3cu unsifted. But I suggest you continue to add the sugar slowly to gain a good working texture. Up the  peanut butter by 1/2cu. If you are adventurous, cut butter to 1/4cu and add 1/2 cu honey. This will take you very close to Reese Cup flavor.

OMG SUB ALMOND BUTTER FOR PEANUT BUTTER!  The butter version is very delicious, but the almond butter version is definitely the favorite.  It is so freakin' good!  I make a vegan version substituting Earth Balance for butter and using an organic palm oil shortening.  This recipe is also naturally gluten free (so rare to find a vegan and gluten free dessert that is SO GOOD).  I also added a little bit of sea salt to the almond butter mixture.  Genius recipe!

I used this recipe several years ago, and have had rave reviews!  The first time I made them too big, but the men in my family love that, because they are "man-sized"...I make some in different sizes each year, so I need to melt more chocolate.  This year I am adding some rice crispies also.  So easy and delicious!

These are little balls of heaven! I do modify it just a bit but feel that they would be great regardless. I use unsalted butter as I like to decorate the top with drizzled chocolate and coarse sea salt they look really elegant that way. I also use about 3 cups of the sugar and about 1 3/4 cup of peanut butter. I think that they hold together better that way. Lastly I add 3 cups of crisped rice cereal because I like the texture that it adds. The end result is deeelisssshh!!! ENJOY

I just made these for the first time and used this recipe. They turned out SO well! I did follow the instructions and used about four cups powdered sugar, but I did sift it first. While I was rolling out the balls I felt like and more sugar and the mix would've been too crumbly so I thought maybe next time I might use a little less but when they were finished and we tried them, they were PERFECT!!! I did find that I had to double the amount of chocolate to have enough. Probably 1.5 times the chocolate would've been enough. I will definitely use this recipe again!!

I made this recipe for Christmas and many family members liked it. I had made Buckeyes the year before, using a method and ingredients I recall using when I made them as a child, but I thought I would try someone else's recipe this time. This recipe seemed more "professional" and, while it was still good, the recipe I used the year prior seemed better to me and my family members. I don't recall what I did differently, though I know I didn't use shortening. The only thing that really tasted different was the chocolate. Maybe it was the shortening that changed the taste, I'm really not sure. I can't quite put my finger on it, to be honest. I think this recipe will be good for people wanting to try it for the first time. People did like it.

Buckeyes are amazing.  This recipe needs tweaks to make amazing buckeyes, which is why I've docked a star.  First, I cut the powdered sugar from 4 cups to 2 1/2 cups.  I honestly think these would be inedibly sweet with four cups.   Second, if the peanut butter mixture in your buckeyes are typically too soft try a "natural" peanut butter.  They are thicker and less creamy (even when using the "creamy" variety).  For years my buckeyes had to be kept in the fridge to be stacked or they would smush down the lower layer.  Switching to a natural peanut butter solved it!

These were so delicious! I sifted the sugar and did as other reviewers mixing in a little at a time, using my hands to achieve the right consistency.  I used natural peanut butter and used less confectioners sugar. Also used mini chips melting in microwave, stirring every 30 seconds. Served them in candy liners.

Classic recipe.  I used chunky freshly ground PB, mixed it with a dash of coconut oil, added confectioners sugar until right consistency, and froze until chocolate ready.  Did not use shortening for chocolate, used store brand semi-sweet chocolate chips with double broiler.  I like chunky PB, Buckeyes were more peanutty. Didn't really measure anything.  Turned out wonderfully to my tastes.   I live all Buckeye balls

I have to say I was not impressed at all with this recipe! Sorry! I tasted like pure powdered sugar coated in Chocolate, and very dry. I first followed the recipe to the T, I then made it a second time and increased the peanut butter to 2 cups and reduced the sugar to 3 cups. I would then rate it a a 4.5 Truely this is way way way to sweet!!!

I have made these numerous times and absolutely everyone loves them, I used 1 3/4 cup peanut butter otherwise they come out too dry.  One thing that I have done to kick them up a notch is to add 1 tsp of orange extract to the chocolate mixture BIG hit if you want to mix it up a bit.

My Husband loved these, he however is in love with anything peanut butter and chocloate.  The only thing that I didn't love was making the balls.  It is such a large recipe that I found myself making big balls just so it didn't take me forever to get through the dough.  They got too big and where hard to eat.  I would make half the recipe if you are doing more baking invest in a mellon scooper if it becomes a family fav.  It will be added to Christmas baking in our house forever now!

What a great recipe.  I have found ways to make this an easier method.  I start with the PB mix in the stand mixer and add the butter and vanilla until it's all creamed, then start adding the sugar.  I go until it's starting to get hard to mix, then I use my hands to finish.  I definitely use 3 and a 1/2, sometimes not quite 4 cups.  You need to get used to what the proper amount feels like, rather than measuring it all out.  It should feel like stiff play-doh that doesn't crumble.  I usually work with the mix divided in half to make my balls, so if I do add too much sugar I can take from the other mix still waiting to be made into balls.  Then I freeze the balls on cutting boards covered in wax paper.  It's important to get everything flat, which will make things much easier.  Then I mix 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips and 1/4 bar of Gulf Wax, melted.  I dip all the balls in the chocolate with tooth picks and return to the freezer.    After I make sure to smooth over the toothpick holes so they look like real buckeyes.  These are amazing!  They are requested every Christmas.

Mine made more than 5 dozen which was nice and they were so easy to make. Maybe I made them too small but I think they were the perfect ratio of pb to chocolate.  So easy and so yummy.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I used almond bark as the chocolate and did not use the shortening. I had no complaints as I used these for Christmas gifts. This made plenty of buckeyes, I ended up giving half to a friend to use as gifts. It was very good. Easy to make. I'm sure I will use again in the future. The almond bark hardened quickly. It was not as soft as using something like regular chocolate chips, but was more conveninet.

This recipe is so good I decided to make buckeyes as gifts for my exteded family this year.  I did not shift my powered sugar so I had to cut it to 3 cups.  I also creamed the butter, peanut butter and vanilla together before adding the sugar.  That seemed to make them smoother.  I rolled the buckeyes into about 1" balls, which gave me about 4 dozen, so I had to use 1 1/2 times the chocolate mixture to cover them.  All in all a very easy recipe that I know will become a family favorite!

I did what others said about reducing the powdered sugar 1/2 cup and adding 1/2 cup of peanut butter in it's place.  Rich and creamy and full of peanut flavor!  I dipped in melted 60% Giradhelli chips (my favorite), made 100 little balls and put them in festive paper cups for gift giving.  Thanks for the recipe!

Good Recipe...one note of advice though, don't make in hot weather. peanut butter balls will start to develop condensation on the outside which will repel the chocolate when you dip it.

These are fantastic!  They're so creamy and smooth and peanut buttery.  I'm planning on making Buckeyes every Christmas as a new tradition.  I agree with reviewers who said these would be way too crumbly with the full amount of sugar though and am giving the recipe 3 stars because I don't believe it would have turned out well that way..  You either have to cut back the sugar, or add more peanut butter.  I opted to add more peanut butter :o)  Also, I used chocolate that is made for candy dipping instead of the chocolate chips and shortening.  It was very convenient that way because the chocolate came in a microwavable tray and I could warm it up again when it started getting firm.  Leftover chocolate was used to make dipped Oreos and pretzels (with crushed candy canes on top).

Wonderful! I did not use as much powered sugar as what the recipe had called for, because the dough would have been to dry. Other than that these were lovely. Thanks for the recipe.

Very easy and good.  I did the bar version since I lacked the time to roll out individually.  I also used 2 cups of peanut butter.

I really love buckeyes and this recipe was really easy to make. The flavor is fantastic, though I will make only 1 tbsp balls next time as the 2 tbsp balls are pretty big. I found that the chocolate that was needed for dipping didn't leave me with as much as I would have liked, so next time I will melt more. Additionally, I needed extra butter (instead of the shortening) to thin out the 6 oz that was called for. This is a new favorite of mine and will be used again and again! Thanks for the recipe!

I don't know how anyone could get 4 cups of confectioners sugar to mix into this recipe! I got 2 cups sifted in and ran out, but it was just enough. Anymore and I would have had to add my peanut butter and everything else. 2 cups is just fine!!! They came out perfect! So yummy everyone loves them.

These are real good. I cut down on the sugar to our preference, I only used 3 cups. and I also added 1/2 cup of graham cracker crumbs. Which gave them a nice texture.

I love this recipe. Made many different buckeye recipes and this might be my favorite yet. I HATE doing the chocolate with paraffin wax, so this one is great for me. My only change to the recipe was instead of butter i used a half cup of margarine which made for creamier peanut butter balls. Greasier, yes, but YUMMIER!

This recipe was AMAZING! Better than the buckeyes and the recipe for them that I paid for in Ohio! Definitely decrease the powdered sugar amount as others suggest, but other than that, perfect recipe and stayed on the toothpick when dipped in chocolate too.

A permanent fixture on my Christmas cookie/candy list.  I made a TON of these last year and they went fast!  I think I actually like these better than Reese's!  A bit labor intensive and messy (anything involving me and powdered sugar is messy), but absolutely delicious.  Freezing the peanut butter balls, as I read on someone else's review, would be a good idea, since they do tend to get soft while dipping.  Storing them in the fridge is good too, since they soften pretty fast at room temperature.

These are so yummy!  I doubled the recipe, and I wish I had frozen the peanut butter balls before dipping them in the chocolate, because by the time I finished they were soft and kept slipping off the toothpick back into the chocolate.  If you move slowly, you may want to only remove a dozen from the refrigerator at a time or freeze them.  Also, I found the sugar to be just right after it was sifted.

These are really good.  I used chocolate almond bark instead of the chocolate chipe and shortening.  the almond bark gives them a more mild flavor and gives it a little more solid chocolate coating.

These are AWESOME! The recipe is perfect! I followed the recipe to a tee, except I actually only needed 3 full cups of confectioner's sugar. I thought because of the humidity in Florida I would use more but they turned out perfect. I did reheat the chocolate 10-15 seconds halfway through the dipping process, stirred and finished dipping. They were a hit! Everyone asked for the recipe and requested them for the next get together!

I'm so sad I tried this recipe.  I've lived in Ohio all of my life and grown up eating these buckeye candies, but this was by far the worst recipe I've ever tried for them.  The dough was so crumbly that when I'd try to roll it, it would fall apart in my hand.  There's too much sugar and not enough peanut butter, I guess.

Yum!  I used 3c powdered sugar and it was plenty.  I also used crunchy peanut butter which gave them a great texture!  The mixture was a little dry when rolling them so I added 1 Tbsp of milk at a time to make it a little easier to handle.  I haven't gotten around to dipping them in chocolate and I may not have a chance to because my kids keep eating them!  The rolling is time consuming but they are very tasty so I know I'll make them again!

Loved this recipe!  I did like a few others and microwaved my chocolate for 1 minute, stirred, then another minute.  These were a big hit at work... will definitely make again.  Thanks for the recipe.

These buckeye balls were very tasty!  The recipe doesn't say how long to refrigerate - and we were in somewhat of a hurry - so we decided to put them in the freezer for about an hour.  That seemed to do the trick as they were relatively easy to manage while dipping in chocolate.

Absolutely delicious!!  Per others reviews, I added 1 T. of water to the dough and it was a good consistency.  I should have mixed it a bit more so it would be smoother, but that was my fault.  Also, just melted choc/shortening over low heat, stirring constantly (not over bubbling water) and it was fine.  Thanks for the yummy recipe!

Yum! Made these at a friend's request and they sure were good. I had to add some extra peanut butter, as they were a little dry as is.

Very time consuming with rolling the little balls and all...but well worth it!  My husband took a majority of them to work and said they were gone in 30 minutes...and that was at 5 in the morning!  Thanks for the excellent recipe!

I love these buckeyes! They are alot more simple than the recipe i usually use. They are really good when you cover the whole thing in chocolate, but thats hard and i guess they wouldnt really be called buckeyes. Very simple and makes alot! I made at least 40 medium sized ones.

I had high hopes for this recipe after reading so many 5 star ratings.  However, I found them to be WAY too sweet to the point of losing the peanut butter taste. I even added extra peanut butter than the recipe called for.   Big disappoint; I won't make these again.

This has got to be the best combination of chocolate and peanut butter ever!! I have also made these several times and have never altered the recipe, because they turn out perfectly every time. I have been tempted to take the easier route of the 9x9 pan, but I can't bring myself to do it since they look so amazing in ball form. Last time I made them, my fiance and the best man ate the entire plate and said,"these are like Reese's only ten times better."

These had a great flavor. I followed the advice of others and wend easy on the powdered suger. I added 1/2 the amount and then added more as needed. Really awesome!

I have never made buckeyes before, but I made these for Christmas this year.  They were a pretty big hit among my family.  They are a little time consuming, but well worth the effort.  I did refrigerate mine before dipping them in chocolate.  Make sure you leave time for this step.  It seems like it would be much more difficult if you skip this step.  Thanks for the post!  I will  add this to my holiday cookie and candy collection of recipes.

These are wonderful. I wouldn't change a thing. The peanut butter/confectioner's sugar ratio is just fine and putting these in a pan and cutting them up into squares is a contradiction to the name. They are called Buckeye balls because they are supposed to look like Buckeyes (the nut). My husband is from Ohio and he absolutely loved these along with my kids and everyone else I gave them out to. My co-workers look forward to my sweet treats during the Holidays every year and this is the first year I made these. Everyone loved them. They will be a staple for our Holidays from now on.

Turned out great! I too cut back on the powdered sugar. My boyfriend ate these like popcorn! I made them a little smaller than suggested, so I got a ton out of one batch. I used my electric fondu pot to melt the chocolate then used a toothpick to dip them in it. Will make again soon. Thanks!

We made this candy for Christmas and it was a HUGE hit! I cut the amount of powdered sugar like the other reviewers said to do, and it worked perfectly. I made balls that were about 1/2 inch across, and dipped them in the chocolate mixture. I've been dipping chocolate for years, but I never tried mixing a bit of shortening in, and it made the chocolate so smooth and easy to work with! In my opinion, Nestle Tollhouse semi-sweet is the best melting chocolate there is. We've tried lots of kinds, and it melts the smoothest. But maybe with shortening other kinds of chocolate work well too. Anyway, these were a huge hit (both to make and to eat) and we'll definitely be making these again!

Even though I made a double batch, I don't know how many of these are going to make it to Christmas, as I keep seeing my boyfriend sneaking toward the kitchen.  I melted my chocolate in a mini crock-pot, which worked out well as I had to keep putting the balls back in the fridge after dipping a few.  As they came to room temperature, they didn't stick as well on the skewer (I used a skewer instead of a toothpick, which worked really well, as the longer stick gave me more leverage).  I smoothed the hole over with my finger, and these things look *almost* as good as they taste!

I made around 250 small balls out of a triple batch.  I cut the sugar as suggested by another, and was glad I did.  I did need 2 batches of chocolate because of all the extra surface area, one I made with butter- big mistake BTW, and one with shortening after much cussing and frustration.  The butter-melted chocolate is thick, gloppy, grainy, and difficult to work with.  The shortening melted MUCH smoother and creamier.  I didnt even need to reheat it while dipping 2/3's of my total candies.  There was no flavor loss I could taste.  The chips were high quality, and on the bag it even says to use shortening, which is a little less than what the recipe calls for.  
I found that partway through, some of the balls were going soft on me :P  I laid them single deep on paper plates and stacked on top of each other in the freezer so I could pull out small batches quickly which really helped out a lot. 
Good recipe, just watch the sugar!

I cut the confectioner's sugar down to 3 cups, increased the vanilla to 2 teaspoons and substituted chocolate almond bark for the chocolate chips & shortening.  I melted the almond bark in a large coffee mug in the microwave (30 second time periods - stirring after each - until melted) and this recipe became the easiest, best new candy recipe in my arsenal!  I'm going to gain a thousand pounds with recipes like this around!  :)

I love these!!  I add crushed Rice Crispies  to the peanut butter mixture and then coat completely in chocolate a couple of times to replicate the way my grandmother used to make them at Christmas.  I have to give them away immediately though or I will eat several of them a day until I gain a visible amount of weight.  Nevertheless delicious though.

I made these Buckeye Balls for the game tonight.  They were pretty easy to make, just a little time consuming forming the balls and dipping them.  I remember making these with my mom growing up.  I changed it just a little based on what I like.  I used 2 cups of peanut butter and 3 cups of rice crispies.  I like having a crunch but don't really like nuts.  Everyone seems to loves them!

This is my husband's favorite Christmas treat and these turned out great! Definately have to increase amount of chocolate to dip and therefore increase shortening to keep it smooth. Also, I tried first just to heat the choco in the microwave and it didn't work. Def have ot use the double broiler/bowl over water to keep the chocolate melty and easy to coat.

These are very good...I too had to have extra chocolate to dip in, especially since I prefer having them covered completely in the chocolate.  I wish the hole from the toothpick wasn't so prominent...

I thought these were way too sweet.  I know they are supposed to be sweet but they made me sick to my stomach.  I made them with 2 cups of peanut butter and the normal amount of sugar.  If I ever decide to make these again, I would reduce the sugar instead of adding more peanut butter.

I didn't listen to the others and used all 4 cups of 10X sugar and the dough was way to dry, so I added 2-3 tablespoons of milk and it made them wonderfully creamy.  My boyfriend can't keep his hands off of them.  I am going to have make more for my cookie trays!  He says they aren't in his hand long enough to know if the chocolate melts in your hand or not.

These were great!  I used all 4 cups of sugar but added a 1/4 c. more peanut butter and they were perfect!  I also used 8 oz. of Baker's semi-sweet squares, which was a perfect amount.  My husband, a diehard Buckeye from Toledo LOVED them (so did I)!  I will definitely be making these on January 8!

I thought 4 cups of sugar sounded a bit much, so I followed the other reviews and added 3 cups.  I should have used 4.  They were not easy to roll because they were too "wet".  They'll be fine if they get eaten straight out of the fridge, but I'm not going to be able to put them out on my cookie tray.

This recipe is a life saver.  Several friends ask me every year to make buckeyes for them & this recipe makes it so easy.  Last year, using this recipe I made 50 dozen buckeyes!  Making 5 dozen at a time kept me from going insane.  Thank you for posting it.

These were good. My friends and hubby both liked them a lot.  I used 3 cups of powdered suger instead of 4 like others recommended.  I think I might use even less next time.  They were still a bit too sweet for me.  But very creamy!  Good!

Absolutely yummy.  I took them to a family Christmas party and even the "non-sweets" people loved them.  I did reduce the sugar to just over 2.5 cups and I replaced the shortening with 1/4 piece of parrafin (like my mom used to do).

Mmmmmmmm! I took another cook's suggestion and added 2/3 c. Rice Crispies. I used over a pound of chocolate, half semi-sweet and half milk. The filling needed about 2 1/2 c. sugar. Then, I couldn't get the buckeyes to come out looking quite the way I wanted, so after the first dip dried I coated the tops. They came out looking phenomenal and I ended up with about 80. Time consuming but worth it.

I made these last Christmas and gave them as gifts to family and friends. Everyone loved them and asked for more! I did follow the previous suggestions and decreased the icing sugar to 3 cups (sifted)and also didn't use any shortening (b/c I didn't have any). This year, I'm going to try the rice krispie and drizzle chocolate suggestions.

Theese taste very good, the only reason I didn't give 5 stars is b/c the rolling of the balls is quite time consuming. If you dont roll easily they will crumble. This recipe makes alot of balls, so call a friend over to help and sit down with some patience, they're well worth the time.

Loved them.  I was trying to make some similar to a local pastry shoppe's, so I added chopped pecans and coconut.  Also added paraffin to the chocolate and it became much thinner and coated more evenly.

The filling is smooth and melts in your mouth.  Do not use the Almond Bark Dipping flavored chocolate!  I used it and found it didn't have a chocolate flavour at all - way too sweet and waxy.  Next time I'm using real chocolate.  These would be great for a cookie exchange party.

EXCELLENT! I have never made these before, but always wanted to. I lucked out with the first recipe I tried! The only change I made was using about 3 cups of confectioners' sugar and milk chocolate chips (the whole bag).

Just like the ones Mom used to make when I was little! I agree on needing more chocolate- I used a 10 oz bag, and 3 tbs shortening. Do measure the confectioners sugar, 4 cups isn't even close to a whole 32 oz bag (LOL).

Wonderful recipe! Now that I live in Chicago, I miss the buckeyes we would have every Christmas in Ohio. I asked my mother for the "family recipe." Somehow it gotlost in the shuffle. This recipe was so simple and so much like the buckeyes I always ate. So, this is the new "family recipe!" Thank you! :)

I wonder if I am the only one who thought 4 cups of powdered sugar was an entire 32 oz bag?  I followed the recipe to a T using a 32 oz bag of powdered sugar.  It was WAY too dry and crumbly.  I could not possibly form balls.  I ended up having to double the rest of the ingredients.  Once I did this, it was perfect, and I began to suspect that I should have measured or just used 1/2 bag.  Also, I agree.... use a bit more chocolate for the dipping.  

They are delicious!

This recipe was WONDERFUL!  I took a bunch into work and as soon as people caught on as to what they were, they were gone in no time.  I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe, but just make sure the dough is cold- it makes the balls easier to shape and to dip in chocolate.  I also used a wooden kabob skewer to dip into the chocolate- they are longer and more sturdy.  Thanks so much for sharing this- they will become an annual Christmas goodie!

I've been making this recipe for at least 18 years now... I am ALWAYS asked, yearly, if I'm making Buckeyes again for Christmas :) I used to take 15 DOZEN to a company Clam Bake each September where I used to work & there was never anything left when I'd go pick up my dish :) It was a small company with only 13 to 15 people working there... The ONLY thing I changed on the "ingredients" was the chocolate... You can either purchase the little cups of chocolate wafers in the baking isle in grocery stores (I get them at Wal-Mart normally) OR look in the "craft dept in the isle with candy & cake baking supplies, they should have bags of chocolate wafers in that isle too... Just follow the directions on the packaging to melt the chocolate wafers & you'll be all set :) I've been able to dip about 10 to 12 "buckeyes" in the chocolate wafer cups I get from the baking isle when I'm making these, it all depends on how large you roll the "dough balls... If anyone choses to go this route, with the. chocolate wafers that you melt in the microwave, then you can "delete" the chocolate chips & shortening from the ingredients list in this recipe :) I can thank my nephew for asking me to make him Buckeyes for his 5th grade class years ago... That nephew of mine will be turning 29 years old in a couple weeks now :) This is the recipe I used all those years ago & will never try another :) Thank you for an awesome recipe!! :)

Not bad.  I used to  buy these at a Snack Bar in my high school cafeteria a few years back.  They were the best!  These weren't quite the same...a little too sugary and the dough was very stiff.  I will make them again but use 3 cups of sugar instead of 4.

This recipe was pretty good, my only suggestion is to make sure that you get a fairly decent kind of chocolate to melt like Lindt or Ghiradelli because Hersheys and Store Brand don't taste very good. The peanut butter part was so sweet, you could tone it down a bit with less powdered sugar, or peanut butter that is all natural.

Great.  The kids loved them and had me make a second batch the next day.  I did have to add about a tablespoon of water to the dough.

This is my first try at these.  They turned out great.  I did make a few changes.  I used 3 cups of powdered sugar right out of the box.  I do not have a sifter.  I was afraid this would make the texture a little grainy but it did'nt.  They turned out very smooth and creamy.  I just made sure to knead the dough really well.  I doubled the chocolate and used half milk chocolate and half semi sweet.  I melted it in the microwave with the shortening.  I dipped the entire ball in the chocolate and used the extra chocolate to drizzle the tops.  They turned out very pretty.  I made these for gifts if I can keep my family out of them!  They are a little time consuming but well worth the effort.

This was a great recipe and very easy.  I mix everything and then put it in the fridge while I made sugar cookies.  Then I made the balls then put it back in the fridge and made some fudge.  

I made one change that made it much easier for me.  I always seem to burn the chocolate in the double boiler so this time I microwaved the chocolate chips with the shortening and then mix it.  I then dip the balls into the chocolate and it was wonderful and so easy.

May 2003 *These are absolutely delicious!  I made them as part of a mother's day gift for my mother and my mother-in-law.  However, my brother, husband and father-in-law kept sneaking some for themselves.  We ended up having to hide the rest from them! Great recipe!

edit March 2019 * I made this recipe again, but I only used 3 cups of confectioners sugar instead of 4 cups.  I  would think it would be way to sweet and possibly more crumbly if I used 4 cups.  This recipe is a keeper.

What a *heavenly* treat for a Christmas gift, or for that matter anytime of the year.  I made them a bit smaller, that way you can have a few extra without as much guilt!

These were excellent, and easy.  Loved by all.  I tried melting the chocolate chips in the microwave, but overdid it.  I'm going to try it with Hershey bars next time, for a different chocolate taste.  Thanks!

These are quite good.  I would also recommend doubling the chocolate dip.  I found them a little too sugary, perhaps I didn't knead the dough long enough.  Still, they disappeared at work in no time, and they do make a nice presentation.

try putting the rolled ball on top of a mini pretzel. They fit well, easier dipping and taste great. Just hold on to the pretzel at the base. Don't dip the pretzel though.

The perfect recipe for peanut-butter balls. Maybe make a little extra of the chocolate dipping sauce so you don't have to use it sparingly towards the end. Extremely tasty.

I made these for Christmas and they were my family's favorite!  I dipped some of them in white chocolate, too.

Did not give full rating because I did tweak the recipe somewhat, using 3 cups icing sugar, and a small drizzle of vegetable oil in melting the chocolate.  I also needed to double the chocolate to finish the full batch.  At first I found the recipe much too sweet, but after refrigerating the finished product overnight, they had mellowed and were perfect by the next day.  I dropped the balls 2 to 3 at a time in the chocolate and rolled to coat completely before removing with a fork.  Family and guests over Christmas have loved them!  Definitely a new staple of cookie trays each year.

This was SO easy!  I needed something sweet for a holiday party. They were a hit!  I did alter and use Ghiradelli melting chocolate which was super easy but, just as tasty.  This is a new definite for the holidays!

DEFINITELY use less sugar!  Good but not creamy like they should be.  Good recipe if you use 3/4 - 1 c less sugar.

These are amazing! I made them for a thanksgiving party. They were gone so fast and I got a ton of compliments on them. I did cut the recipe in half and even then only did 1 1/2 cups of sugar. Will make these again next time; they were delicious.

I suggest very small bites to help absorb so much sweetness.

Can't go wrong with peanut butter and chocolate. This recipe tastes wonderful. A couple of things I'd change: use 3 cups of sugar, not 4. I did not sift the sugar and it seemed to turn out okay anyway. Dipping the balls in chocolate was a bit challenging due to how shallow the chocolate sauce was. I recommend adding more chips to deepen the sauce so it's easier to dip the balls.

These were great, but next time I would make the traditional ball form buckeyes. We were running short on time and went for the sheet pan version. We used chocolate melts to cut down on the chocolate work. What I didn't count on was the entire chocolate crust breaking into bits when we tried to cut into it, but that's because we used the melts, which harden considerably. The taste was not affected, however. Loved by all!

We doubled the recipe and put it in a 9x13 pan.  I can't imagine how thick it would have been if we had put it in a 9 inch pan as suggested.  We did not like the chocolate at all.  Too much shortening.  If we made it again, I would use half the shortening or less.  Maybe use butter.  Probably will not try this again.

I made these with my kids a week ago. They were wonderful & super easy to make! Both of my children loved them just as much as they loved making them. (Being it is advised to combine ingredients by hand; I would highly suggest having a little helper or two to do this part... ??)

I used to make these years ago and forgot the recipe.  Took the advice of another reviewer and cut the powder sugar back to three cups (unsifted). I also found that 6oz of chips for dipping wasn’t enough, in my opinion, so I melted 12 ounces. Turned out great, love these decadent little morsels.

Like other reviews, I attempted to use the four cups of sugar and found that the resulting dough was too dry. I supplemented with additional peanut butter to restore the expected balance.

Instead of toothpicks, I used chop sticks to pick the balls up which worked very well! This was especially helpful as I wanted to completely coat them in chocolate instead of leaving a bit of exposed peanut butter dough.

Finally, I also used a silicon sheet instead of wax paper. They seem to work just as well without the waste.

Soooo good. I followed others' recommendation on using 3 cups of confectioner's sugar since I'm lazy and didn't want to sift. I also melted my chocolate in a small crock pot on low... it was easier and also safer for my daughter to help with. She touched the sides of the crock pot a few times and I didn't have to worry about burns or hot steam from a double boiler. Will definitely make again, we have a new Christmas tradition. Thanks for the keeper :)

I do two batches one with crunchy peanut butter and one with smooth.  I also don't use shortening in my melting chocolate, but use butter instead. These are great for holiday parties just label the one with nuts.

This was my 1st time making buckeye balls, and I'm happy to report they turned out wonderfully. The amount of confectioner's sugar was overwhelming, so I reduced it by almost 1 1/2 cups. I added 3 tbsp of maple syrup in its place, but 2 tbsp would have been sufficient. I slightly warmed the peanut butter, maple syrup, and butter so it would be pliable instead of a stiff ball (my wrists ache after kneading tough dough for too long). The dough was a little tougher than cookie dough and not at all dry and crumbly. I also used milk chocolate melting wafers in place of chocolate chips and shortening; it's a smoother and more decadent chocolate taste. I drizzled the tops with the extra chocolate to cover the toothpick holes. They sweat a bit when you first put them out, but they sat out on my table for 2 hours without melting or losing their shape.

Love this recipe. SUPER easy.
I made a few adjustments.
- Substitute dark chocolate for semi-sweet.
- Make the balls 1sp instead of 2
- Drizzle chocolate over the top to cover completely
- Sprinkle with coarse salt after final chilling

These were good but strongly recommend making the PB balls smaller and making about 3x the chocolate. I could only coat half the treats. The ones that were coated were very peanut buttery, too much in my opinion. This is why I suggest making them smaller so the chocolate to PB ratio is more palettable.

This actually makes about 70 Buckeye Balls and the chocolate only coats about 60 of them. However, GREAT recipe!

Disgustingly sweet, this recipe has far too much confectioner's sugar which overwhelms the flavor. They also get very "gummy" and stick to the roof of your mouth. I won't make these again.

A good basic, buck eye recipe.  I omitted one cup of the sugar and added another scoop of peanut butter, give or take a half cup. I needed another 1/2 more chocolate and shortening than called for.

I loved the taste of this recipe. I followed the suggestion of a couple of the other reviewers and made this the lazy way by pressing the peanut butter mixture in a container, then pour the melted chocolate over the top. It's so much quicker and easier to make, but the next time I will make the balls because when I cut up the 'cake' into squares the chocolate chipped everywhere and it didn't look very good. I even tried to cut through the chocolate with a hot knife. 
Balls are the better option if you want a good-looking result.

It's good except we all thought it was too sweet. I think I'll lessen the sugar next time by a cup and sub milk powder. I bet that would be really good and stay together nicely as well.

Made this recipe for Xmas and it was pretty good.  I do think it had too much of the powdered sugar taste to them though and needed more of the peanut butter to shine through.  The peanut butter mixture was very dry and crumbly, while forming the balls, than what I'm used to.  It was a nice easy recipe, so thank you!

The peanut butter ball turned out perfect. Personally, I did not care for the shortening in the melted chocolate. It was a little waxy. Otherwise, great recipe!

Awesome recipe! Make sure and sift your powdered sugar. They are delicious in taste and very easy to make. I just microwaved the chocolate chips and shortening in 30 second intervals, took about 90-120 seconds.

Made this for our Christmas gift trays. People raved about these.   I made the recipe base exactly as written but I use Merken's chocolate for dipping. These were not dry or crumbly as others said. Nice and creamy.

I didn't read the reviews prior to making this so used the full amount of sugar. They turned out great anyway probably because I used natural peanut butter that is a little oiler than a typical peanut butter and also doesn't already include extra sugar or corn syrup.

I love these for the holidays. I don't use the chocolate tho, I use almond bark instead. Really quick to make as gifts. One thing the recipe calls for butter, don't use margarine the peanut butter will be too runny.

I made these tonight and they are fabulous! The other reviews helped because I made a different recipe last year and it was very dry. I added the 3 cups of confectioners sugar and used salted butter. These are creamy and not too sweet. Love these and thanks.

Forgot to sift the confectioners sugar so I had to add another 1/2 cup of peanut butter and butter and 1 tsp to the batter. Other than that,  they came out great.
Also, the recipe says it yields 30 but it doesn't tell you it's 30 large buckeyes taken down from 60. I wanted 60 smaller size buckeyes so I doubled it. Ended up with almost 100 large buckeyes...some of them golf ball sized lol. 
Family loves them and we will be using this again. Just sift it next time and not double it.

I made a Valentine's Day version and also melted white chocolate with food dye to decorate! They turned out super yummy and delicious! I also wanted to add that for the perfect size a 1/2 tablespoon measure is PERFECT to measure the balls of PB mix! They're not too big or small and taste so great! I'm trying to add a picture now! Enjoy!

Too much confectioner's sugar or too little peanut butter. I added peanut butter to mine and they turned out fine, but if you don't your peanut butter mixture will crumble and fall apart. I've used better recipes in the past for this.

The thing with this recipe is that it takes like a recesses. What I did was this... first melt the butter then put in the freezer, i then added 4 cups of powder sugar. The chocolate was mixed with butter flavor crisco. My kids said that I have the secrets to recesses!

I have made a few buckeye balls recipes.  I would like to keep this one as my favorite.  I used my small scoop to gather up the batter for the balls.  I left the balls in fridge for about 20 minutes.  The balls keep their form and set very well for dipping in the chocolate.

I used 2 cups confectioners' sugar, 1/8-1/4 cup Gran marnier, 1 cup flour.  OH SO GOOD, and not sickeningly sweet.  Could still cut down sugar by more - try only 1 1/2 cups sugar next time, maybe add cream cheese.

As with other reviews I cut down the sugar and added 1/2c more peanut butter. Although I did find it a little crumbly to work with, I found that mashing the ball in your hands first (reheating the peanut butter with the heat from your hands) made it very easy to roll.  I did however make two batches, using  the shortening in one batch and one without. The one with  the shortening made the chocolate thin but gave it a longer working time. The one without made the chocolate much thicker but you have to work fast.  Also I double dipped a batch, once in chocolate (then refrigerate) then dipped them half way up in white chocolate....waiting from my favorite taste tester to tell me how those taste!  GO BUCKEYES !!!!

Followed the recipe and it was way too crumbly.  I tried adding more peanut butter but still didn't work.  I then looked at similar recipes and found that their proportions were 1 1/2 cups peanut butter to TWO sticks of butter...not one.  Once I added another stick of butter, it was fine.

I halved this recipe. It was wonderful! For the last few scoops of peanut butter, I added a small amount of rice cereal. The next time I make these, I will add rice cereal to the entire batch because they were really good with the additional crunch!

Read the reviews (very smart) and agree wholeheartedly with the other that did NOT use 4 cups of sugar, three was enough if not sifted...

Just finished dipping! I didn't follow the recipe exactly, I added 2 sticks of butter and measured out a pound of powdered sugar on a scale. I melted 12oz of chocolate chips and 2 oz of paraffin together and used a 1\2 tablespoon scoop. perfect!

These took effort and time to make.  The ingredients never came together as a dough but instead were crumbs.  I had to hold a bit in my hand and smush together to get a ball.  Dipping in chocolate did not work well either.  The ball did not want to stay on the toothpick.  Finally, I tasted the final product and it was way too sweet.  I couldn't even taste the peanut butter.  I have had buck eyes before and liked them but I did not like these.

Perfect, exactly like I remembered them as a kid! The hardest part is the ratio of chocolate to fat. Too much fat and the chocolate will harden up. Not enough, and you can't dip the balls very easily. Make sure you have a consistency of thick oil, and your buckeyes will come out perfect! Also, I only use Peter Pan, it has the best peanut butter taste and mixes the best with the confectioner's sugar.

This is recipe is wünderbar! I used 4 cups of unsifted sugar and my dough turned out crumbly, so I used a mini ice cream scoop packed it full of dough and then released the dough onto my hand. I then kneaded the dough in my hands and this made a very solid ball. I did this for each ball and had not further problems with crumbliness.

what i do is starting adding the sugar and then when it looks like it forms well in a ball i dont add anymore i add what i think it needs sometimes you have to do that in recipes make them your own and they come out great i use about 2 to 2 1/2 cup sugar

Very easy to make and very tasty!   Based on other reviews I started at 2 cups of powdered sugar and added gradually until I reached the consistency I liked.  I ended up using a little over 3 cups.  I will be making these for years to come.  Thanks for the recipe!

I found it too sweet (even accounting for the sifted sugar) and the chocolate was impossible to work with. It wouldn't stick to the dough. I tossed the first batch of chocolate and was able to struggle through with the second batch. The chocolate wasn't nice and smooth as in my past experIence, so the buckeyes were rough-looking. Disappointing results. Maybe I should have used more peanut butter? I will try a different recipe next time.

Loved these!  Using toothpicks to dip them into the melted chocolate made it so much easier.  Also, may try adding Rice Krispies in the peanut mixture next time to add some crunch.

Perfect! This recipe is so easy and so perfect! The only thing I changed was doing about double the chocolate sauce b/c I poured sauce over the balls after dipping them to get chocolate all the way around. PERFECT :)

Came out just like the picture. We didn't think they were too sweet, and regarding the moisture: they were crumbly when we began balling but softened up as we worked them. Great holiday treat!

I just made these wonderful Buckeyes and I followed the recipe along with a few of the suggestions in the reviews. Having said that, let me tell you what I found.  4 cups of sugar is WAAAAY too much for this recipe!  I used 3 cups as per review suggestions and it was perfect.  I also melted the chocolate chips in the microwave (as I always do) but I added 1 tablespoon of shortening to keep it smooth and flowing.  This recipe worked out great for me with only a couple of minor adjustments.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good. I would reduce powdered sugar a little just to enhance the peanut butter flavor. Another idea is after dipping balls in chocolate (while chocolate is hot) have some roasted crushed pecans ready and sprinkle some of those on top of the chocolate. A little extra crunch and it can hide imperfections.

I've been making buckeyes since I was a kid.  I now use organic coconut oil instead of shortening.  I also pat out the peanut butter mix and cut into the appropriate  number of pieces (5 rows of 12) and roll them.  It takes less than 10 minutes to cut and roll them all.  Now if they would just chill faster!

Great recipe!  Just slowly add the confectioner's sugar (4 cups is way too much) because it really effects the taste and consistency if too much is added.  I think I used about 2 or 3 cups.

I would recommend 2 Cups of Peanutbutter, 1/2 cup butter, 1# of confectioners sugar. I also do NOT use shortening..I use 16 oz (2 cups) of Ghiradelli's dark chocolate chopped up and 1 cup of Ghiradelli's milk chocolate chopped uo and then temper the chocolate...I also make my own peanutbutter...makes it much healthier and better tasting

Sift the sugar before measuring or reduce it.... I reduced the shortening to 1 tablespoon and double dipped the balls. A fan favorite.

Too dry at first, had to add more peanut butter and butter. However, after that they were great. Really easy to make, best when kept in the fridge. Everyone loved them.

This was my first attempt at making buckeyes, they turned out great. I bought chunky ( smart balance) peanut butter by mistake but was very pleased with the results. The simi- sweet chocolate was a nice contrast to the sweetness of the peanut butter and the chunks of peanuts gave it more interest. Will use this recipe again for sure.

I just made this recipe.  I doubled the ingredients and used 25 ounces of sifted confectionary sugar.  I made 135 buckeyes.  They are delicious!

I made a batch of these last night and they are excellent (and I don't care for peanut butter!) - I, too, cut the powdered sugar to 3 c. and it was perfect - chilled them in fridge for about 45 minutes before coating - perfect!  Husband has requested another batch  :)

I think these are 5 stars the way that I made them.  I added 3/4 teaspoon of maple extract, like another recipe on here that I could not find again for some reason.  I used natural peanut butter, and they were awesome!

Perfection! First of all, the peanut butter/chocolate combo is to die for. Second of all, make these small enough and you can just pop 'em. Which atually is bad if you don't have stretchy pants on hand. :)

I made about 35 of these and barely any of them did the toothpick come out clean.  I even put a tad of milk in the chocolate mixture to make it a tad waterier and the toothpick still kept falling out, making the hole WAY bigger.  I also had them fridge for about 90 minutes before i dipped them.  Tasted wonderful, and you also need a very small chocolate melter, or else you'll be keeping the ball in there too long and the PB will get soft and it'll fall right out and you have to scoop it out with a spoon.

i want to make these but i want to use butter instead of shortening and the peanut butter ball falling off the toothpick concerns me too, would it help if i used a small glass flat bottom bowl and only fill it about 3/4 of the way up the ball with chocolate???  thanks for your help...

These taste great. However, I listened to other people's tips about only using 3 cups of confectioner's sugar and my dough did not have the right consistency.  It was too soft to roll into a ball and it wouldn't stay on the toothpick when dipping in the chocolate.  Next time I will follow the recipe exactly and see if it woks better.  The tip about putting the dough in the freezer definitely helped.

I made these after having my mother in law's for years.  I knew when I melted the semi-sweet morsels that this would be different than hers.  I believe she uses the almond bark for her coating.  THESE ARE TONS BETTER!  Tastes just like a peanut butter cup.

These turned out perfectly! I used a whole bag of milk chocolate chips (I don't care for semi sweet chocolate chips) and I just had a tiny bit extra. They will keep sealed in the fridge until I need them next week!

I thought these were super delicious!  I wanted to make it a bit more healthier so I used organic peanut butter from Trader Joes and I added organic coconut which was awesome!  I only used 2 cups of powered sugar.  And I added another 1/2 cup of PB.  I'm under the impression that you may not need 2 tbsp. of shortening, but maybe one.  I could sorta taste it a quite a bit in the chocolate and thought maybe 1 tbsp would be sufficient.  These were nice and moist and perfect!

Granted, this was my mother and I's first attempt to make buckeyes however, they did not turn out well. We followed the directions exactly as written and noticed while mixing the peanut butter mixture, that it seemed dry and crumbly and we debated on adding more peanut butter but decided it against it & to follow the directions instead. They turned out not having a good peanut butter flavor and I also agree that there is too much confectioner sugar. So far, 4 people have tried them & no one has liked them. I will try another recipe next time.

For some reason I always thought buckeyes are hard to make and very time consuming.  These are not hard or time consuming!  They were amazing. I plan on making them again next week!

The only thing I didn't like about this recipe was that wax wasn't used in the chocolate so it melted faster when in hand.  I do think the longer the balls sat in the fridge they tasted better, not sure why.  It was really easy to make, fun, and very good.

I'm a big Ohio State Fan as is my whole family but i didn't grow up in Ohio because i left when i was 5 years old.  But my husband who is born and raised in Ohio has always loved buckeyes!  My husband gives this recipe 5 stars because they taste just like he remembered as a child.  great recipe!!

This is very yummy.  I think that you need more than 6 ounces of chocolate in order to dip every ball fully.  You can use the left overs to make some delicious hot cocoa.

These are delicious. Didn't use all four cups of sugar - about three cups is good to maintain a more peanut rather than too sweet taste. Also had to refridgerate longer to get the chocolate to harden well. Overnight is good. Will def. make again next Xmas.

I followed recipe exactly and ended up with darn near a hundred of these little buggers! I may have made them slightly small than suggested but I prefer a single bite size candy. I had to work the dough a bit after using the mixer when I was making the balls but the end product was well worth the effort.

Flavor was OK - texture not so much. The peanut butter filling had a nougat-like texture (kinda like the center of a 3 Musketeer's bar) which I felt took away from the peanut butter taste. The filling probably requires too much powdered sugar.

Love this recipe! If I dont have time to sift, I just use 3 and a half cups of sugar. These always get raves. I also have found a dipping bar chocolate by Ghiradelli at Sam's club. About $7 for 2.5 pounds. Just melt in microwave and dip. Yumm!

These are really wonderful! Remember to make them small - the first time I made them they were too big and the wonderful thing about these is that you are supposed to be able to just pop one in to your mouth - no biting it all up. I learned that lesson! Also, I had to add more melted butter and peanut butter to get the right consistency. The recipe as is was too dry and powdery. Otherwise, delightful!

They are really good!!  I covered the whole thing with chocolate  and only used 3 cups unsifted sugar.  I also used about 10 ounces of chocolate instead of 6.  I had to dip half and then put them back in the refrigerator and let them get cold again and then do the other half.  Took some time but hey, that's part of it :)

This is the perfect buckeye recipe if you only use 3 cups of sifted c. sugar.  I've made buckeyes many times, and these were creamier and plenty sweet.  I always end up using more chocolate chips than the recipe calls for, so I'd recommend having extra on hand.  One last note, let the buckeyes sit for a few minutes before you pull the toothpicks out.  My husband was a bit heavy handed in pulling the toothpicks out and smoothing over the hole and some of our buckeyes had pools of chocolate arount them and peanut butter peeking through on the bottom. Waiting a bit and using a gentle hand solved the problem.

Good!  I don't know if I added as much powdered sugar as it called for, I just go by texture and taste.  I added a little more peanut butter too.  I didn't add and shortening to my chocolate chips, and I microwaved them instead (I've not had good luck w/ chocolate and a bowl over water, I always ruin it!).  Didn't have a single problem w/ the chocolate using the microwave!  They turned out great and my only complaint is that they're gone (I didn't get very many!).

I had been hunting for a great buckeye ball recipe and this didn't disappoint. The flavor was amazing. My only issue was that when. I had chilled them and went to remove from the wax paper some of them stuck to it and I lost the chocolate from the bottom of some so I had to chill them longer. They still tasted amazing and my husband loved them!!

Fantastic! A little labor intensive (as far as all the rolling, and the dipping seemingly takes forever!), but definitely worth it! Just knowing every ingredient in the candy that you're putting in your mouth is enough reason to make this recipe. Oh yeah, and it tastes good, too!!

These are great!  Due to my son's peanut allergy, I substituted Sunbutter (made from sunflower seeds) for the peanut butter, and it worked fine.

Great recipe!  Very easy.  Some mentioned the dough was too dry?  I just added a couple teaspoons of milk and it solved the problem wonderfully.  
I used Gharadelli chocolate baking bar for the coating...very good :)

I made these for a cookie bake-off at work, and I got rave reviews.  Very good and simple to make.

These were great. I grew up along the Ohio-Kentucky border, so these are a staple around Christmas and Thanksgiving. I only used 3 cups of sugar (didn't sift it) and it was plenty... anymore and I would have had dry crumbs. Thanks for sharing!

Very good.  Definitely a dry crumb mixture, but roll it in your hands long enough and it will stick together.  I used double the chocolate chips and added parrafin wax (1/4 block) to help it go a little farther.  I covered the entire ball with chocolate.  Great!

This recipe came out perfect. The only thing I changed was that I did put about a 1/4 cup more of peanut butter and I also doubled the chocolate. Make sure you sift the powdered sugar.

Very good! Everyone has loved this one. Rolling the PB balls took awhile, so turn some good music on while you work. I came out with 43 buckeye balls myself, a little more than I needed. Also, I "cheated" and used the microwave to melt the chocolate so I needed less shortening. However, as a holiday gift or treat this one is a keeper. Thanks!!

These are always delicious!  I made these for several tailgates this year, and though the chocolate melted in the southern heat, they were still gone by gametime!

love love love. I knew I would like these because I'm a peanut butter freak! lol. They were very sweet. Will use only 3 cups of sugar next time. I always thought sifted meant to not pack it in. Oh well. They taste great right out of the freezer!

A gluten free cookie recipe!  Yea!  I have a sister with Celiacs disease, so these are a perfect and absolutely delicious cookie that she can enjoy at the holidays.  The rest of us gobble them up, too :)  Great recipe and super simple - I heat the chocolate/shortning in a glass bowl in the microwave, just giving it additional zaps when the chocolate starts to harden up.

These were pretty good. I have one complaint though. They were very very melty. Though yummy. Although that problem could have been caused by the fact that i only used 3 cups sugar as other reviewers recomended. Otherwise pretty tasty

These were fast and tasty. The kids loved them and I thought they were really good too. The rolling them and dipping them is kind of a pain though, so I'll probably stick to bar form.

I read all the reviews, and tried to cut back on the amount of sugar in the recipe like others suggested.  I found that it made the "dough" not firm enough to roll into balls.  I used the full 4 cups, and it was perfect!  I also added a little paraffin to the chocolate, which made it shiny and perfect.  YUM!

Better than the receipe I have been using for years.  More peanut butter and less butter made them easier to shape and they stayed firmer.

I made these with a few modifications this afternoon.  I used natural peanut butter instead of regular and as suggested by another reviewer, I reduced the amount of sugar to 3 cups (which was perfect IMHO).  I melted the chocolate in the microwave, and I used a large bar (about 5 oz) of Hershey's "Special Dark" chocolate bar and a small Hershey's milk chocolate bar along with the shortening.  I think these would be tastier with 'regular' peanut butter...but they were still very good and slightly healthier with the natural PB

I love buckeyes being from Ohio. I have found that you can also use a fondue set to dip the balls in the chocolate. It works very well.

These were delicious, but very very sweet!  I'd definitly classify them not as a cookie, but as candy.  They were a little too sweet for me, but they are still great!  Also, they were a bit time consuming to roll & dip.  I think next time I will just try bars instead.  (But they were fun to make.)

I was a little dissapointed in these, as they are not quite the recipe I was looking for.  They were pretty wet when they were out of the refrigerator for any period of time.  However, they are chocolate and peanut butter, so couldn't fail to be pretty good.  But next time I will try a different recipe.

Made a half batch this evening. I think the ratio of powdered sugar to pb might be a tad off. Mine came out very dry and crumbly. They are good though! I also added a 1/4c of rice crispies for some crunch. (The dough was dry before adding the cereal, so I know that wasn't it.)Used Ghiradelli Milk Chocolate and Jif PB. A big hit here at our house!

Too sweet!  I tried the suggestion of making a double batch & putting the peanut butter mixture into a pan & then pouring the chocalate over it...what a mess!  The peanut butter mixture stuck to the pan...I ended up throwing it all out.

Buckeyes are my husbands favorite treat so I decided to make them for his birthday tomorrow. This recipe is easy to make and delicious. I doubled the chocolate and melted it in the microwave for just shy of 2 minutes. Worked perfectly!

These are easier than the ones my mom made growing up.  I use chocolate almond bark to cover and warm it in the microwave to save time, and besides that made exactly as written.

These just did not work for me. I got frustrated because the chocolate coating was just not looking very nice and the dough gets unmanageable quite quickly. I stuck them in the fridge for 12 hours or so before attempting to dip the rest of them and I finally just gave up. I guess I was making them right because mine looked just like the pictures, but I didn't think they looked nice enough to put on my cookie trays. My boyfriend loves peanut butter and he couldn't eat more than a bite of these because they are so rich. Thanks anyway.

I agree with the others. This recipe needs more peanut butter and less confectioner's sugar. Besides those tips, one other thing I did, since I'm not counting calories (yet), is freeze the buckeyes once they had been dipped in chocolate. Then, I redipped them in chocolate again! Served with a glass of milk, they're not too unhealthy because only two or three will have your sweet tooth fufilled!

I grew up with these and this is the best recipe. Don't skimp on the confectioners sugar, the second time I made these I used less sugar and it hindered the results and look of the peanut butter. Sift the sugar, very important. I prefer skippy peanut butter and Hersheys chocolate. If you melt the cholate in a pan on the stove as I did, you have to add butter for it to melt enough to dip the peanut butter. It was way too thick, but butter did the trick. Thank you for this wonderful recipe, now I can have a little of home whenever I want.

We made these last night and they turned out perfectly.  I adjusted the recipe to 2 cups of unsifted confectioners sugar because any more than that would have made the too sweet and they would have begun to crumble.  I was able to make 80 balls.  My fiance likes his without the chocolate, so I did half of mine without the chocolate.  Had I decided to cover the full batch I would not have had enough chocolate.  I was slightly disappointed that the chocolate wasn't a little thicker around the balls, so hopefully I can find a way to remedy this next time.  Overall, these were great and I'm sure they won't last long.

i didnt have anything to sift my sugar with, i dont know if this was the cause or if it was something else, but i had to add and extra 1/2 c peanut butter because it was way too dry. 
I also had to use more than 6 oz chocolate, but i'm thinking that was because i had to add more peanut butter. 
Turned out great and I will deffinatly be making these again. Much easier than my old recipe. Thank you!

This is a really good simple recipe!  I followed what the previous reviews said and only used about 3 cups of confectioners' sugar...it makes the balls creamier.

This was the first time I've made these and they are amazing if you love peanut butter!  Very rich, but so good.  I did find it to be a little dry so I added about 1/2 cup more PB and a dash more of vanilla, turned out perfect.

I used natural crunchy peanut butter and added graham cracker crumbs to the middles to add texture. Otherwise I think these would have been too rich or too sweet, but these turned out fine! I also didn't bother using a double boiler, I just stuck the chocolate in the microwave with margarine for a few seconds.

The taste was very good. I followed the recipe almost exactly and had no issues with it being crumbly. The only thing I had to do extra was melt another 3oz of chips and 1 tbsp of shortening. I didn't have enough for dipping. Since this recipe was better than the other recipe I had for Buckeyes, I'll continue to use this one. Thank you!

I only wound up using 3 cups of powdered sugar because the dough was just starting to crumble and not hold together, plus I thought it was by far sweet enough. I use milk chocolate instead of chocolate chips (personal preference), and the toothpick method is really easy. These may be the easiest candy to make. I'll definitely do this again, but with some modification to  the amount of sugar. Thanks!

These aren't quite as good as my aunt's recipe.  The mixture was rather stiff/crumbly to work with which made them difficult to roll into balls.  There wasn't enough chocolate to cover them all - I got about 40 balls.  I also did not like the toothpick method.  Overall good but needs some perfection.

These are very good but a little goes a long way. I think I forgot the butter and they were still good. I bet they are even better when the recipe is followed. Make sure to make them small. I thought mine were small but they ended up being two bites each.

Such a good recipe, it reminded me of the ones my Great Grandmother used to make! I even yielded 45 buckeye balls with this recipe. I also made some with Milk Chocolate and prefer that to the Semi-Sweet. I also added paraffin to the chocolate with gives the chocolate a pretty sheen and dries faster as well.

Following advice of other reviewers I added 1/2 cup of peanut butter.  I also added a few Christmas colored sprinkles on top after I dipped the balls in chocolate (I used milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet). These were really easy and pretty tasty.

my family loves peanut butter and chocolate and this recipe didn't let them down. My son calls them peanut butter truffles. I had to add more margarine to the chocolate chips to get a smooth chocolate to roll the dough in but it could've been my chocolate chips.

Overall an excellent recipe!!!  Super easy to make.  I only used 3 1/2 cups of powdered sugar.  The peanut butter dough was crumbly like some reviews had mentioned, but honestly you just needed to press into a ball and THEN roll to make smooth.  I was skeptical if the recipe called for enough choc., but I had a perfect amount with very little waste.  End result is awesome.  The easiest and most delicious Buckeye recipe I have tried.

Good job on this one. I used my big Kitchen Aid Mixer and it comes together real well. I used the suggestion of less sugar, I used 3 1/2 unsifted. To cover the toothpick hole, I just smear the hole a little. Go Bucks!
ps-they are really sweet-they are candy!

I drizzled extra chocolate to cover the toothpick holes as suggested by another reviewer.  This made them much prettier and of course these are yummy!

I love any combo of chocolate and peanut butter, and these were no exception. However, it's essential to follow reviewers' advice and cut the confectioner's sugar to three cups for the consistency to be right. Even with the cut, the balls still tasted a bit too much like sugar and too little like p.b. for my taste.

Very easy, very good. Husband and friends really like them. I drizzled some of the leftover chocolate on top to cover the toothpick holes. Will definitely make these again.

I used only 3 cups of sugar like others but still it was way too sweet. Next time, I probably will only use 2 1/2 C and mix the semisweet choco chips with bittersweet ones. It's better to also just put in 1 TBSP of shortening instead of 2 TBSP per 6 ounce chocolate chips.

Oh my goodness!  These were mouth watering, creamy, beautiful, yummy goodness.  I dipped mine all the way in the chocolate and then dotted a little snow man on top to cover the toothpick hole.  The snowman was made of simple white chocolate piped on with a baggie.  These really looked and tasted like a candy from a professional candy shop.  Everyone was surprised that I had actually made them!

Thought these were great! They do taste just like a peanut butter cup. The dough is dry when mixed, but once you use a small scoop and mold the dough in your hands it goes into a ball quite nice! Will make them every year. Great recipe to do with kids!!

I followed other poster's advice by using only 3 cups of powdered sugar since I didn't sift it. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly!Phenomenal! My husband took them to work & everyone raved.

These were terrific!  I used reduced-fat peanut butter, which I would not recommend, because when the dough solidifies, it is very dry.  So, it was difficult to shape the dough into balls. I managed to do it by adding a little extra butter, and the taste was still fine.

I have never made buckeyes before. Me & my daughter made them. They were very easy to make and they were a huge success at my husband's work. We are making candy for all the men in my family for 
Christmas. This recipe will be a definite keeper.

These are SO good! I followed the recipe to a "T" but cut the entire recipe down to 2/3rd -- surprisingly, I was still able to turn out 34 balls using my 2tsp cookie scoop.  I did, however, need to double the amount of chocolate indicated to dip all of them.  I did not find the dough to be too dry or crumbly as other reviewers had commented.  This recipe is definitely a keeper! :)

This is the first time I've made Buckeye Balls, and these tasted pretty good, but were kind of hard to work with.  They softened quickly when removed from the refrigerator, and consequently fell off the toothpicks when dipped in the chocolate.  I also added Rice Krispies and used chocolate almond bark instead of the shortening and chocolate chips.

Yep....the peanut butter mixture was too dry.  I wish I had read the reviews before I started to make these.  They also tasted a little too sweet....my next batch will be made with only 3 cups of sugar.

I found the peanut mixture to be crumbly.  However, if you just have a little patience, the warmth of your hands will melt the mixture a little just enough to roll it into balls.  Next time, I will decrease the powdered sugar as others suggested.  Great recipe.  Reminds me of my grandmothers Buckeyes!  Thanks.

These are really cool treats to add to a Christmas goodie platter.  The taste is a lot like a peanut butter cup, but the size and shape makes them less messy, as you can pop the whole thing in your mouth at once.  The only concern I had with this recipe was with the texture/consistency of the peanut butter mixture.  Following the recipe exactly, it was kinda crumbly and coarse, making it a little difficult to maintain balls, but just with a few of them...not the entire recipe.  The other thing that the consistency made difficult was removing the little hole made in the top of the ball by the toothpick.  I would definitely use this recipe again...and again, and again! Thanks for sharing it with us! :)

These are very good, but watch out! These make a LOT of balls. I didn't have the patience to roll out all the candy so a lot was wasted. I should have read the other reviews before making these. I definitely recommend cutting the confectioners sugar to 3 cups. The dough is crumbly and stiff otherwise. But they still turned out great.

Excellent recipe, but somewhat time consuming. My family & co-workers really enjoyed these treats, they are very similar in taste to Reese's peanut butter cups, but I think better. I used Laura Scudder's all-natural peanut butter, which worked excellent.

Great recipe--my only complaint was that it didn't make very many...or maybe I made them too big.  Anyway they were gone in a flash.  I think next time I will make them smaller and double the recipe.

This is a good base for making something I never have maded before. However I will use only half shortening next time because the chocolate was a little too soft and came off some of the balls of peanut butter. Also I think 3 cups of confectioners' suger would be better.

I LOVE this recipe.  I change it by using a little chunky peanut butter as well as creamy and add some rice crispies.  Anytime I make them they are gone in a flash.  However, I also have to make more than the amount of chocolate to dip them in than the recipe calls for.  I double it and it seems to do the trick.  Yuuummmyyy!

Just like I remember having as a kid, the only change that I made was to use natural (unsweetened) peanut butter otherwise it's way too sweet for my liking.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were great.  I doubled the recipe and I still couldn't keep these around.  I still have over a week till Christmas and I only have a few left.  I did make a few modifications, however.  Even though I doubled the recipe, I only used six cups of sugar.  Additionally, after I mixed all the ingredients together, the dough was quite sticky.  Refrigerating the dough for a half hour made it much more manageable to roll into balls.

My mom used to make these when we were kids, and we called them peanut butter balls.  They are very very rich, but taste just like a peanut butter cup.  I used dark almond bark instead of chocolate chips and shortening, because it is easy to melt in the microwave.  You can also add a cup or so of rice crispies for a an excellent crispy twist.

This recipe was a hit at the office.  Several people requested the recipe.  Being from Ohio, I grew up with Buckeye candies.  I like this recipe because it did not call for parafin wax like my grandma's does.  Because of this, it is best to keep these refrigerated until serving as the chocolate begins to melt in your hands as you eat them.

Yummy. These are delicious. They are a little more work than most cookies, but they are worth it. I highly suggest that people double the chocolate for the coating in the end, as other's suggested. I didn't, and I needed to make more. Which meant, I had to go to the store and buy more chips (since I bought the 6oz pack). So save yourself the trouble of doing it twice.

I didn't read that it was to be sifted sugar and so it seemed dry, so I added a little more butter and they worked out fine. I dipped the entire ball into the chocolate for the first batch. I made these for my students, but other teachers loved them too. I didn't have time to put chocolate on second batch but my sister needed something for her work Christmas potluck. I sprayed the 2nd batch with veggie spray and put them in a bag with confectionary sugar and shook. They were devoured as well.

They tasted like unbaked cookie dough, too sweet and filling.

The balls were flaky and some fell apart because of all the sugar, and I had to add extra butter to the chocolate to make it dippable.  But the end product was nice-looking and tasted great.

Awesome cookie! This was a lot of fun for the kids to make. We added rice crispies into the recipe and loved it more.

These were a big hit among my co-workers. Me, I found them to be sugar bombs. Way too sweet however, they do look nice on a tray of desserts for the entertainer.

I made these to take to a shower and they were devoured. These were very easy to make also. Everybody loved them and so did I.  Thanks so much for sharing.

These were a HUGE hit. Young and old alike LOVED them. I'm quite sure I'll get requests every Christmas from now on to make them.

I had a lot of trouble getting the dough to "come together".  Finally I added a few TBSP's of water and it started to form a dough.  I will not use this recipe again.

These are terrific!  Melting the chocolate over a double boiler didn't melt it fast enough and thin enough for me so we just used a regular pan on low heat and that worked fine.

These taste fantastic!!!
They are a pain to make, they take a while and are very tedious.
