I used cilantro instead of parsley.  I love the garbanzo bean flour and the herbs for flavor!  This recipe made for a great breakfast!  I'll be making this again!

Wow are these good.  They defiantly do not have the taste of a traditional pancake for sure but DH and I really enjoyed the flavour and uniqueness of them.  Will be making again.

I think I would increase spices by 50% next time and add a dash of cayenne pepper.
