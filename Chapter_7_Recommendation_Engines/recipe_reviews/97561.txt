This bean dip will turn out runny and soupy if you don't make changes to it. I've made it about four or five times now for parties and the last time I made it, it came out great. I only made a few changes, mainly just in the way it's preped.   STRAIN THE SALSA AND JALAPENOS. Canned and jarred salsa and jalapenos have a lot of water in them. I found that by taking some cheesecloth and a strainer and geting the majority of water out of the salsa before putting it in really helped. I also strained the jalapenos, maybe I was supposed to be doing this all along, but the first few times I didn't and the dip was soupy. (I was using canned jalapenos)  Even if you use chunky salsa it's still runny. For awhile I thought the runnyness was from the melted sour cream, but it's not. It's the salsa. So strain the salsa before adding it if you're going to use something store bought. Also this dip is really good if you get it all layered, and then put it in the fridge overnight until you need it. I usually make it the night before a party and cook it the day of the party, right before I leave the house. Just add about 15 minutes to the cook time if it's been in the refrigerator all night.   Also I haven't tried it, but I'm sure this dip would be good cold too. As in not cooked at all.

Great recipe, everyone loved it. I used diced green chilies instead of the jalapenos and didn't add the whole 4 oz as I don't like things too spicy.

I just made this dip and it came out great! I had just made a batch of refried beans without the refry (found on this website also!) and black beans. I was looking for a bean dip  and decided to try this. I added some taco seasoning to the bean portion, and I didn't drain the salsa and mine didn't come out runny. This will be a family favorite since I am always making pinto and black beans!

Great dip! I drained the salsa and jalapeno peppers as others suggested. I added half a packet of taco seasoning to the bean mixture. Delicious:)

Thanks for trying my recipe! I just stopped by to read the reviews and wanted to clarify how I make this yummy dip :). I drain the jalepeneos or use peeled roasted green chilis (which we buy in the fall and keep frozen on hand) or substitute canned mild green chilis to tone it down.  And I almost always prepare this the night before and keep it refrigerated until cooking.  Hopefully that will help y'all make it not so runny!

This bean dip works as a great base, but ultimately it needs something more. I was looking for more flavor and more spice.

This is a really good recipe. I also subsituted green onions for the pepper. Also try adding 1/2 a pack of taco seasoning to the sour cream.

I really loved this recipe!  I did follow some of the suggestions in the reviews.  I drained the salsa and the jalapenos, and I also added half a package of taco seasoning to the sour cream.  The only other changes I made (personal preference, and I had the ingredients on hand) were I added lime juice and chopped fresh cilantro to the bean layer, and chopped green onions to the sour cream layer.  I don't know that those changes were necessary, or that they improved the flavor of the dip.  I just thought I would try it.  I think the dip would be wonderful as is. However, as one of the reviewers said, the dip is a great base for experimenting as well.  I will definitely make this again.

AMAZING!!!!! This recipe is great with or without its spicy/hot elements. I did substitute Zoi brand plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream. It did taste a little bit salty (everyone else said it was fine). So I would recommend, if you can, to make your own salsa and re-fried beans to control the salt.
Also I used a 2-quart cooking dish (since there isn't one defined in the recipe) and had to use a little bit more than the measurements.

A-1!  Went over great at a pot-luck and was one of the first empty dishes.  That's always a good indicator.  I used the olives on top and a little extra salsa and cheese.  My favorites.

This was very easy to make and quite tasty.  I did not have the problem of others where it was too watered down and I followed the directions as written.  My co-workers enjoyed and said that it wasn't too spicy, but I don't know that I used a full 4oz of jalapenos.

This is a good recipe that you can adjust to your liking (or ingredients on hand).  Omitted the black beans as I didn't have any.  Used 1 can of Rotelle tomates with green chilis (drained) for the salsa.  Was excellent and quick and easy.

I guess I’m in the minority on this one, but didn’t care much for how the overall dish turned out. The bean layer on the bottom was entirely too heavy, and actually took away from the remaining toppings & flavors. Putting a layer of sour scream in the middle prior to baking was the biggest flaw. Sour cream does NOT cook well as a layer like that! It comes out separated like you have milk chunks floating around in the salsa that becomes runny after baking. My suggestion: mixing cream cheese w/ the bean layer to mute the overwhelming flavor & make it more creamy. Layer remaining ingredients, leaving the sour cream & salsa for the very last. Bake PRIOR to adding the sour cream & salsa. Add those two, very last w/ a decorate scoop of guac. Making this as written- it was the one dish that didn’t get much attention at our taco-themed potluck. I understood why after I tried it. It’s a good concept, but not the way I would opt to make it again. It was too heavy & the flavors didn’t do much to compliment each other the way this is put together. Hindsight: I knew sour cream shouldn’t be baked in a middle layer like that! Lesson learned.

I added hot sauce to the bean mixture and made it the night before.  It turned out pretty good and my guests loved it but I thought it needed some more flavor.  Next time I will use hotter salsa.

Loved this dip! I didn't really measure the sour cream, salsa, jalapenos or cheese. I just added until it looked like a good layer. Probably twice the amount of cheese as called for, but hey, is there ever too much cheese!

Tastes good but the sour cream made it look curdled and it was watery. I followed the recipe so I'm not sure how it happened.

Excellent!  I added some of Penzey's Taco Seasoning to the sour cream, to taste, and left out the jalapeños.  Leftovers made incredible burritos the next day, wrapped in tortillas, covered in Frontera Enchilada Sauce, and baked at 350 for 30 minutes, then to 250 to keep warm until ready to serve.  :)

I didn't have black beans, but used extra refried beans.  This was a big hit because it is so good looking.  I sprinkled some chopped green onions and tomatoes on top.

Just made this for a last-minute quick meal. Substituted a small can of diced tomatoes with jalapenos, drained, for the salsa, and used drained banana peppers in place of the can of diced jalapenos (used ingredients I had on hand). DELICIOUS! I probably could have drained the tomatoes and the banana peppers more thoroughly, as I had a bit of juice in the bottom of the casserole. Will definitely make this again!

I make this for every potluck dinner we are invited to. We love spicy so I use fresh jalapenos and hot salsa!

This was really good, however next time I wont add the olives.  I love olives, but not sure they were needed with this.
