A very light and refreshing salad. I noticed that it didn't call for oil and thought I might add it in the end but it really doesn't need it. The flavors are spectacular as is the color. I added some strips of fresh zucchini and added red and yellow bell pepper. Mint and rose water are delicate but make this salad, they hook you from the first bite. The only thing is I doubled the dressing because my tomatoes and my cucumber were quite large. This served nicely on crostini as an appetiser, like a bruschetta. I'll bet this is wonderful with light white fish. Thanks carol fromsweden for sharing!
