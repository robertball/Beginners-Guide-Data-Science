The concept was good, but I do have some criticism of this recipe.  Suffice it to say olive oil is a better option than cooking spray, fresh minced garlic preferable to garlic salt, and the Parmesan tossed with the asparagus before roasting rather than sprinkling it on afterward much tastier.  I found 10 minutes was adequate, and didn't bother turning it mid-way.  A little drizzle of fresh lemon juice and a light sprinkle of grated lemon zest make this particularly fresh and lively. Small changes easily elevate this to a 5-star rating.

This dish turned out very well even though the power went out while baking and I finished it on the gas stove top.  The frying pan produced small chunks of fried Parmesan which was a treat as well.

Roasted asparagus is always a winner!  I increased the temp to 450 when I realized I'd overestimated how much time I head before the rest of dinner was ready.  As I was cooking this while camping, I also simply shook parm from the can on, rather than measuring a T.  No complaints here; thanks for the recipe, Zerkovich!

A good recipe, however, you may want to kick up the amount of seasonings to add the necessary flavor.  Instead of garlic salt, I used 3 cloves of minced garlic and a dash of sea salt.  Also, I used olive oil instead of cooking spray.  Olive oil doesn't have the chemicals found in cooking spray.  Finally, I added diced red onions and sliced mushrooms to the asparagus before baking everything.  This side dish was great with my baked salmon and white rice.  The soft red onions and mushrooms oozed into the white rice which added flavor to the rice.

No, I didn't change anything. I had never cooked asparagus before. I and my family loved it. You don't know how it burns me up to see people critize a recipe, then change it. If you know so much why bother looking for a recipe?

Hard to mess this one up.  Simple and delicious.  If you want to kick it up a bit, try a bit of greek seasoning or maybe Slap Your Mama seasoning.  :)

So yummy! I brushed them with olive oil and used fresh minced garlic and fresh grated Parmesan. I think this is the only way we will ever eat asparagus again! I also like to add sliced mushrooms if I have any. Yum!

I took the suggestions of others...I used olive oil...drizzled it on...and put on some chopped fresh garlic...I also spinkled a little garlic pepper salt...cooked on 400...6 minutes...then turned them...cooked another 6 minutes. Other than the fire alarm going off (why I'm not sure!) they came out delicious!!  I will be making these again...and again...and again!

Delish! I followed another reviewer suggestion and added sliced mushrooms and thinly sliced onion when baking. Otherwise prepared as directed. Great healthy option, will be using this recipe again.

I did it exactly how it said and it still came out kind of hard. Everyone else at the table liked it but me though so maybe it is just my taste preference but I think it needed cooked longer. Also, I added bacon bits and some shredded mozzarella cheese to the Parmesan and spice and it was very good...

Fabulous.  Succulent.  Fresh from the Farmer's Market.  Served that day.  Love.  Watch the amount of salt though.

I used this recipe with my own little substitutions and additions. Instead of garlic salt, i used garlic powder and added a little regular salt. I also added some black pepper to the mixture. This came out great!

Excellent!  I did use olive oil instead of the spray.  I had a bunch of Asparagus so I doubled the parm and garlic salt.  As a side note, I was tempted to add a little more garlic salt since I love garlic but I'm glad I didn't, it was a perfect blend.  Can't wait to make this again!

Drizzled with olive oil and then seasoned with salt and pepper.  Since I had the oven set to 375 for another dish, I increased the cooking time to a total of 14 minutes.  When finished baking, I used a microplane with a block of parmesan for an added flavor.  Everyone loved this.  So easy!

Not quite al dente at 9 mins total.  Maybe an extra minute or two next time.  I covered the bottom of the stalks with thick slices of tomatoes from the start and that was a hit with my guests.  Flavorful.  Will make again.

Easy peasy and tasty! What more can you ask for! I tossed the asparagus in garlic infused olive oil (I hate cooking sprays) and salted before baking. Then topped with cheese! Yummy!

This was such a nice change compared to just the traditional garlic salt and olive oil recipe. Everyone loved it! We did however use a light drizzle of olive oil instead of the pan spray.

This was quick, easy, and Good.  I added Tony Chacheres and garlic powder seasoning for extra ump in seasoning but was overall really good. I cooked on 350 because I had something else in the oven, for about 35 minutes. Sooo good and soft,  Yum!

I think adding just a sprinkle of lemon juice to the asparagus definitely helped and using fresh minced garlic!

Super fast and just enough flavor without overpowering the asparagus. I used garlic powder instead of salt.

We have made it twice already and the recipe is fabulous (despite some minor things that are just our personal preference). We didn't use cooking spray, but we just lightly drizzled some olive oil on top of the asparagus instead of using it because we prefer to not have cooking spray on our food.

I followed the recipe to a t except for how many asparagus I added ( which was more), and I baked for 7 minutes on each side instead of 6 minutes. These came out AMAZING, and it was honestly my first time making asparagus. Very easy!

Excellent !!   Made this tonight and the husband who doesnt even eat veggies loved it.  I did use olive oil but the parmesan (I used a combo of shaved and grated) and garlic made a great flavour!  super easy (and elegant) side dish that takes hardly any time, thanks!!

Very good! I've marinated and grilled asparagus but this was super easy and just as good.  I skipped the mixing bowl, drizzled olive oil over asparagus and rolled in roasting pan.  I used asiago cheese and forgot (skipped) the lemon.  Delicious

I turned to this recipe mostly for temperature and roasting time, but was still very pleased with the turn out. I tripled this recipe in order to feed my family of five, used olive oil cooking spray, garlic powder and just a little table salt, since I couldn't find my garlic salt, skipped the parmesan cheese, and seasoned to taste. Tasted wonderful. I was very pleased at finding a tasty way to serve this vegetable and keep it healthy.

This is the best recipe ever!  It doesn't even make a big mess in the pan!  My husband was so excited about it, we had it two days in a row. The idea of sprinkling on the parmesan mixture after the baking would never have occurred to me, but worked very well.  This is my favorite recipe for asparagus! Thank you for sharing!

Did the recipe in a frying pan because I don't have an oven, and it still turned out great! I used a salt free garlic seasoning because my roommate hates salt and just measured the parm by eye and let it melt for a few moments before serving. Turned out amazing and everyone loved it.

Simple is better when cooking asparagus and this is perfect and quick. You can adjust the amount of cheese and seasoning as you prefer b

Instead of cooking spray I used coconut oil. Also instead of garlic salt I used sea salt and fresh garlic finely chopped and sprinkled that over the oil drizzled asparagus. When I flipped them over I sprinkled the Parmesan cheese and then put it back in the oven. They turned out super delicious I should've made more on my first time around!!

Amazing recipe. I absolutely loved it! With a few minor changes that had been suggested. Instead of garlic salt, I minced one clove of garlic but didn't add any salt. Instead of cooking spray, I used about 1-1/2  Tbsp. Of olive oil, added lemon zest and some lemon juice. I did add parsesan cheese, after about 7-8 minutes in the oven, I also topped it with some feta cheese and cooked it fir about another 5-6 minutes and it came out PERFECTLY. This is definitely a recipe I will use for now on with the few adjustments.

This was very good. I didn't use garlic salt, instead I used garlic powder. I wouldn't cook 6 min on each side. I would cook it about 8 minutes total. Very good!

It was okay, but it's much better if you prepare it the same way and then grill it.

Great recipe. Best asparagus I've ever made. I used a bit more Parmesan and added some more halfway through along with some lemon pepper. Simple and delicious, couldnt get enough.

This came out perfect. Used fresh grated Parmesan and Garlic powder and sprinkled with a little sea salt while backing,delicious.  6 minutes on each side gives you great results.

We really liked this recipe.  The only difference for us was we put the asparagus on the grill.  I used Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb along with olive oil.  After it cooked half way through, we added the parmesan (had them in a shallow aluminum dish) so that we could grill them with the parm.  Turned out really good.  We will be making this one again.

Made this a month ago or so and accidentally put the Parmesan cheese on during baking instead of after. It was REALLY good. Made again last night, but made it correctly according to the directions and sprinkled Parmesan after taking out of the oven. We all liked the crunchier baked on Parm better!! Will definitely be making this again and again...but my accidental way instead!! Sooo Yummy!!

I loved the recipe though I did add fresh cut bacon to them and I added the fresh Parmesan and baked it with these things on the asparagus. Yum
