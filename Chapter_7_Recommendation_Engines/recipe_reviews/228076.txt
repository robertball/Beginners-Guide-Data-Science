This has long been a staple among my appetizer recipe collection and everyone always loves these, especially the men!  I add 1/4 cup of sour cream to the ranch/cream cheese mix to add more depth of flavors.  The great thing is, you can make the cream cheese mixture a couple days ahead of time and the flavor blends really nicely together.

I make these sandwiches on those tidy little sandwich squares of rye bread, my favourite.  I don't, however add the dried ranch dressing - not to my taste.  Great summer tidbit.

I didn't have rye bread so I used regular sandwich bread. Also, didn't have dried dill weed but used fresh from garden. Simple and tasty.

A perfect cucumber sandwich! I used my homemade wheat bread rather than rye.

A super hit at summer parties!!!!   That look when people taste one and their eyes open wide with that OMG look is the best.   So simple and tasty.

Wonderful light summery sandwich.   My family was very skeptical when I said I was making cucumber sandwiches for lunch, but their frowns turned to smiles once they bit into these tasty treats.   I did use whole wheat bread instead of rye, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.   I will be making this again and again.

This recipe is perfect as is! Don't skip the dill weed. I've been eating this all summer.

Even my son liked it! And asked for more!  Mom said they were so light  and loved them.  I forgot the dill though-next time will add dill into the mix, not sprinkle it.

I've used this recipe without the dill (didn't have any) and they taste delicious!!! Perfect for tea/ school parties.

Absolutely delish.  The kids asked for thirds.  I used sourdough due to rye allergies.
