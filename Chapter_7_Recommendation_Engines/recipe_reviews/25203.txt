I know I'm just another in a long line of reviewers, but I enjoyed this recipe just as much as everyone else! I didn't read through all the reviews, but from most of them I gathered modifications, which added up to a winning recipe!
- I only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar.
- I added 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to the ketchup/brown sugar mix.
- I used 1/2 cup of milk and 1 egg.
- I added 2 cloves of garlic to the meat mixture.  Plus, I love celery, so I chopped up some of that and added it in.
Finally, I used a cup of season bread crumbs instead of the crackers.

Being impatient and hungry, I followed another user's idea and made mini-loves in my muffin pan.  I put the ketchup/brown sugar sauce on bottom, cooked for 30 minutes at 350 degrees, then spooned the rest of the sauce on top and cooked another 15. This was so delicious, I can't wait to make it again - this time in actual loaf form.  Yum yum!

I think the brown sugar and ketchup should be on top of the meatloaf, not in the bottom of the pan. When I sliced the meatloaf, the brown sugar/ketchup mixture remained in the bottom of the pan, so I tried to invert the pan so that the mixture would drain into and flavor the meatloaf.  This was a disaster - the sauce splattered all over the kitchen.  I just don't see the point of having the brown sugar/ketchup in the bottom of the pan as it didn't flavor the meat much.  It should be on top.

Delicious. I did make one alteration though. I don't like to make meatloaf in a loaf pan as i find the meat just sits in the grease. I formed my meat loaf, put it in a large casserole dish and put the glaze on the top. I was able to drain the grease 3 or 4 times during the cooking process. The glaze remained in tact and the meat came out moist and delicious.

Very good. I placed two slices of bread in the bottom of the loaf pan. (I saw this on Foodnetwork)The bread absorbs the grease. Then I placed the meatloaf on top of the bread. I mixed the brown sugar and ketchup and spread it on top of the meatloaf and placed 4 thick slices of good bacon on top. I turned out very good. Thanks. Joyln

This recipe was fabulous!!!!  Instead of spreading the ketchup and brown sugar on the bottom of the pan I mixed them together and used it as a glaze on top of the loaf and it came out beautifully.  I won't be using any other meatloaf recipe again!

Yummy!! Best meatloaf I ever made. I did use onion soup mix instead of the chopped onion and only 1/4 c. milk, thought the mixture was moist enough and didnt want it to be too mushy. I also took the advise of other reviewers and used only 1/4 c. of the brown sugar and a few splashes of worcestshire with the ketchup and spread this on top of the meatloaf. Very tasty....thanks for a fabulous recipe, Starbuck!!

This was excellent!  I took reviewers' suggestions and used only 1/2 cup of milk, and added garlic and 1 tblsp worcestershire to the beef.  I used about 1/4+ cup of brown sugar, the catsup, and yes, a tbls of worcestershire to the glaze.  Outstanding, and rave reviews.

I am not a meatloaf eater, but I found this recipe to be absolutely wonderful! My husband agreed (and he's a picky eater).  I did have to tweak the ingredients a little.  I used 1/3 cup of brown sugar instead of 1/2; ground turkey instead of ground beef; 1 packet of onion soup mix instead of a chopped onion; and 3/4 cup of bread crumbs instead of saltine crackers.  I also mixed the ketcup and brown sugar into a glaze and used it on top of the meatloaf.  I let the glaze cook on the meat for the last 15 minutes of oven time. It was great!

This is very close to a recipe my mom made often, the only difference being she added some mustard(dry spice works nice) and worchestershire to the brown sugar/ketchup mixture. (We put it on top too.)  That might add some zing for those that found this recipe a lil bit too sweet.  I also add garlic to the meat as another reader did, as I'm a Garlic-holic myself. ;)

I increased the recipe to feed 12 & then cooked most in the called-for loaf pan & the rest in a mini loaf pan. Per reviews, I made the following changes (I gave 4 stars to the recipe as written but w/ the help of the other reviewers this was 5 star).... I only used 1/2 cup of brown sugar & I did add a couple tbp. of worcestershire to the sauce. I added a pkt of onion soup mix & used half chopped onion. Decreased teh milk to 1/2 cup (remember I have increased the recipe by half) & I only put a little bit of the sauce on bottom, using most of it on top. I also used half ground beef & half ground turkey. This was moist, flavorful & hubby said it beats out his recipe. Thank you Starbuck & fellow reviewers! I served it w/ roasted sweet potatoes & onions & a salad....cherry salad (from allrecipes) for dessert.

My husband is a meatloaf conneisseur. I, on the other hand, can't stand the stuff. However, his arrival home from the war in Iraq prompted me to make this as his homecoming meal: good old-fashioned, USA comfort food. Meatloaf and mashed potatoes. The only problem is, I didn't have a recipe for it. I searched on allrecipes.com, read the ratings and reviews for each recipe, only wanting to make the BEST for my dear hubby. Alas, I picked this recipe out of all the others and made it. My very first attempt at making meatloaf! It was easy to follow and my husband almost fainted when he realized what he was getting for dinner! He LOVED it and even more amazing, I (the world's biggest anti-meatloaf person) loved it as well. This is our new favorite dinner, and I really want to thank you all for rating this, which drew my attention to it-most of all, I want to thank Starbuck for posting this recipe!!!

Very Yummy. I did what others did after reading ALL of the reviews. (yes it took me a long time lol) I mixed the ketchup and brown suger together with a dash of worstechire sauce and placed on the bottom and the top of the meatloaf. I also used onion soup mix instead of raw onion. Added Worstechire sauce and garlic to the meatloaf mixture. Lowered the brown sugar to 1/3 cup. Lowered the milk to 1/4 cup.  Used bread Crumbs instead of cracker crumbs. AND I cooked it 1 1/2 hours. I like my meatloaf well done with no pink. Seems like a lot of changes but after reading the reviews this is what I felt I needed to do. YUMMY!!!!

I don't know how I missed reviewing this!  I HATE meatloaf.  I can't stand it.  I LOVE this recipe!  I did make changes based on everyone else's reviews.  Here's what I did:
1.) I cut the brown sugar in the sauce in half
2.) I added a Tablespoon of Worcestshire sauce to the sauce.
3.) I put the sauce on top of the meatloaf.
4.) I only used 1/2c. milk, not 3/4c.
5.) I used seasoned salt instead of table salt.
6.) I used 1 package of dry onion soup mix instead of an onion.
7.) I used Progresso Italian Seasoned Bread Crumbs instead of cracker crumbs.

With these changes, I made the BEST meatloaf I have ever eaten (and like I said, I don't even like meatloaf!).  This has become a weekly request.  Thank you!  I am so happy I found this recipe!

I've made this a number of times now and I have learned a few lessons: First use a flat jelly roll pan, it gives you more delicious crust and glaze and keeps the loaf from stewing in its own fat.  Second, line the pan with aluminum foil, otherwise you will have a sticky mess that you cannot soak off.  Third, put the brown sugar glaze on top, it flavors the loaf more.  Fourth, use coarse ground chunk, lots of flavor and the coarse makes it easier for you to mix the loaf lightly.

I wasnt exactly impressed with this recipe for the simple fact that I have been topping my meatloaf with equal parts of brn sugar & ketchup for years. The meatloaf its self was pretty boring and I think I was looking for some umph. So I made it a second time added kc masterpiece BBQ seasoning, garlic worcestershire, and some italian bread crumbs, chopped green pepper, red onion, paprika, oregano, basically I kept adding until I had the smell I wanted . Turned out better with more zest to match the topping. My family thought it was spot on. Save yourself the hassle mix the brown sugar and ketchup and just top your meatloaf halfway through. So much easier with the same taste result. So I will continue to make with these changes and that vaults this into a 5 star in my book. My 8 and 5 year old boys ate more than I did exclaiming how I should make it again. BBQ seasoning in the meatloaf is a must! Make in cupcake pans and top with mashed potatoes that have been died with pureed beets for the perfect April fools dinner.

My favorite recipe from Allrecipes! Most meatloafs taste like hamburgers but this one is better. I used 1/4 br. sugar, 1 egg and omitted the milk. I added 1 garlic clove, 1 TBL worchester sauce, packet of onion mix instead of raw onion. The cracker crumbs could also be replaced with seasoned bread crumbs. We sure to put bread end pieces on the bottom to soak up the grease plus it's helpful if the meatloaf is overcooked, the bread prevents the bottom from being burnt.  I don't bother doing layers, it is easier to mix everything with the ground beef and it still tastes great!

The key to making this recipe AMAZING is to listen to the most helpful reviews. If you do what the top 5 most helpful reviews say to do, then this meatloaf can't get much better!! For convenience, here are the recommended changes:

1. Use the brown sugar and ketchup as a GLAZE instead of putting them on the bottom. Use 1/4 cup of brown sugar instead of 1/2 cup, add 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, mix these 3 ingredients separately, and pour it on top of the formed loaf evenly (I recommend putting some on the sides of the loaf, too).

2. For the meatloaf mixture, use 1/2 cup of milk instead of 3/4 cup, and use 1 egg instead of 2. Also add in 2 cloves of minced garlic.

3. Use a 9x9 casserole dish (or bigger) instead of a loaf pan. Form the meatloaf so that there is at least 1/2 inch of space on all sides. Not only does this allow the glaze to be applied all around the meatloaf, but it also makes draining the excess juices easier.

4. After 30 minutes of cooking (halfway through), drain excess juices, let it finish cooking, then drain again if need be.

5. OPTIONAL: Add strips of bacon on top of the glaze before cooking. When you take the dish out to drain after 30 minutes, flip the bacon strips. Flipping the bacon in the glaze may seem awkward and messy, but it turns out beautifully when the cooking is finished.

My wife, who normally hates meatloaf, LOVED this.

I was very surprise by this one .I fellow the recipe just as its written .So I will rate it.as so   4 1/2 Star .texture was very nice ,ginger did a lot for the taste. Sauce was sweet and very tasty .I use lean beef but if you do the sugar and sauce on the bottom I would recommend very lean beef, because you are not able to drain any fat off as the recipe is done .For taste this is a 5 star for me but if you have a savory loving person in your home they may not care for it as much as my family did . Milk and saltine may need to be adjusted to get the right texture but it was very close to perfect .Next time I make this I will put brown sugar and sauce on top, So that I can drain off the fat if it is too much  I  may even heat some ketchup,  Worcestershire sauce and brown sugar in a pan to serve on the side as a sauce  to use on the  meat loaf. Hope this help and thank for a great and differ meat loaf

This is the best meatloaf I have ever had or made. The brown sugar is what does it! I ran out of ketcup so I ended up using half BBQ sauce/half ketchup and it was fantastic. I may just do that on purpose next time! For those reviewers who didn't like the idea of the sauce on the bottom, you are mistaken! The sauce on the bottom marinates the meat almost thoroughly because its melds with grease (necessary for juicy meatloaf) and keeps the meat moist and flavorful. Putting the sauce on top only allows the oven heat to dry it out. Trust me. Don't change anything about this recipe! I will never use another meatloaf recipe again. Oh and one last thing, I always serve with mashed potatoes!

This is a really sweet version of regular meatloaf...I loved it.  Instead of putting all of the brown sugar at the bottom of the pan, I mixed it up with the meat.  Gave that sweet flavor to the entire dish.  It was great.

This meatloaf is excellent!  My entire family loved it!  I didn't follow the recipe exactly as directed.  I forgot the milk, and did not add ginger as I did not have any.  I did not think the recipe was too sweet, although we do enjoy sweet foods.  Instead of layering the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom, I mixed it together, and combined about 2/3 of the mixture in with the meat mixture, then brushed the remaiming sauce over top of the meatloaf before cooking.  It was excellent!  After taking his first bite, my 4 year-old said, MOM, THIS IS AWESOME!!!  :)  This is definetly a keeper!

My family loved this recipe, and I have requests to make it again.  We have a gluten allergy, so instead of saltine cracker crumbs, I substituted gluten free crackers.

If you put the ingredients into the loaf tin then place upside down onto a baking sheet, bake for 15 mins then remove the loaf tin you have a perfect loaf right side up, then brush the ketchup, brown sugar (I add half teas dry mustard to it) then continue baking.  I also add teaspoon of dry mustard and 1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture.

This was really just okay for us.  I made as written, except that I too put the glaze on the top of the meatloaf the last 15 mins of cooking.  It was just a tad bit bland for our taste.  We added ketchup to it on our plate, which helped some, but still wasnt a favorite.  Thanks!

Excellent meatloaf!My whole family loved it.My husband took a bite and said "You did something different to the meatloaf."I told him "Yes, it's a new recipe."He said "It's better".Everyone asked for more.The only things I changed about the recipe was to divide the brown sugar and ketchup between the top and bottom instead of putting it all on the bottom.I didn't use lean ground beef and used a little more salt and pepper than the recipe called for, but not much.The meatloaf turned out very moist and yummy.There were no leftovers and they were all fighting over the last piece.If you are NOT using very lean ground beef, do NOT add as much milk as the recipe calls for because it won't need it. Great recipe! A real kid and husband pleaser!

I used less ketchup and sugar and it was just dandy. Also used equivalent amount of quick oats for the saltines. A keeper.

Great base recipe but like some others mentioned - needs a little more flavour.   Have been making this similar recipe for decades.  I use a packette of dry onion soup mix in with the meatloaf - cheating but it does add such flavour.
And use more ketchup and put the ginger in with the brown sugar and ketchup.  
Put the meatloaf in the pan and cook it for 30 minutes then invert it onto a tray with sides and apply the ketchup sugar combo as a glaze.  This way the grease can drain off and the glaze gets a nice caramlized texture.

Jokes abound in our family regarding my attempts at making meat loaf.  If you are as meatloaf challenged as I was, try this extraodinary recipe!  Following other's advice I put the ketchup sauce on the bottom of the pan along with the top.  I would make extra of the sauce next time just so we would have more topping.  This is a wonderful recipe thanks to you Starbuck!

Following others advise, I mixed the brown sugar and ketchup together, then put an equal amount on the bottom and top of my loaf. It was perfect.  Not too sweet, just juicy enough, one of the best meatloafs I have ever had.  YUMMY!  Thanks Starbuck.

I thought this recipe was great!  I did make a few change though...1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup milk, and pouring the ketchup/br.sugar mixture on TOP instead of under the meatloaf.  You can also layer it on the bottom, middle and on top (which I will try next time).  Also, I found that the 1 hour requested cooking time was TOO early for me.  When I took it out after 1 hr, it was still VERY pink on the inside. Anyway, I left it in for 1.5 hours and it was P-E-R-F-E-C-T!!! Juicy & moist with a hint of pink...DEE LISH!! Enjoy!:)

Hubby requested meatloaf for his birthday dinner, but this wasn't one of our favorites.  Hubby usually loves all meatloaf but to him this was just okay.  I am not a big meatloaf fan and found this way too sweet for me.

the basic recipe is fine, however, the ketchup and brown sugar need to be put on the top not the bottom. I added a stalk of diced celery, 1 diced beef tomato, 1 shredded carrot, and half of a red pepper, diced to the meat mixture.  I also lined my bread tin with bacon and then top off with the meatloaf mixture and then top with the ketchup and brown sugar and then more bacon!

OK, here I go.  I'm going to be "That Person" who reviews a recipe after making a bunch of changes...sorry. Some changes were made because they seemed like good ideas...other changes were due to a lack of certain ingredients.  I have a feeling it would be a four or five star recipe if I had made it (mostly) as written.  I am writing this review because I do want to make it again, and I want to remember what I did and what I didn't so I can make it closer to "tangastar's" recipe next time.

Changes: 
1. I put the ketchup/brown sugar mixture on top of the meatloaf as suggested by other reviewers (this I would probably do anyway, as the thought of it sitting and mixing with the beef grease at the bottom of the pan grosses me out.  Maybe it adds a nice flavor, but my heart thanks me!).  I added 1 TBS. Worcestershire sauce to this mixture per another reviewers reco, but I think it cut the sweet...not such a good thing.  Next time, I may try to add it to the meat mixture, but not as the sugar/ketchup topping, IMO.

2.  I cut the brown sugar to 1/4 cup, but next time I will keep it at 1/2 cup. It should have been sweeter, but maybe it was cut by the flavor of the Worcestershire sauce.

3. I used bread crumbs instead of Saltines - all I had.

4.  I added garlic (very important).  I do love me some garlic!

5. I didn't have an onion, so I used onion soup mix (also based on other reviews).  I think this made it too salty.  Will definitely use the onion next time.

My whole family LOVED this! I used Italian bread crumbs instead of saltine crackers as I did not have any on hand at the time and I also put the ketchup and brown sugar on top as well as on the bottom as instructed. I use ground turkey instead of ground beef. It came out beautiful and my children ask for it at least twice a week.

the glaze is supposed to be at the top of the meatloaf.  this recipe has been around for years.  I have been making it for a long time.  Use yellow mustard, brown sugar and ketup.  also instead of the cracker crumbs, use seasoned bread crumbs.  so much more flavor.  so good.

Best meatloaf I ever made.  My picky family loved it!
This will be a staple in our home going forward.

Instead of a loaf, I used a muffin pan for 12 individual loaves.   (Serves 5)
Made the following tweaks...
Used 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef 
1/2 cup of milk 
1 egg.
2 tsp of minced garlic to the meat mixture. 
1 cup of season bread crumbs instead of the crackers
ketchup/brown sugar mix:
3/4 cup of ketchup 
1/4 cup of brown sugar. 
1 tablespoon of Worcestershire
Spoon ketchup/brown sugar sauce on bottom & on top.
cook for 35 minutes at 350 degrees.
I put the muffin tin on top of a foiled cookie sheet to catch any drippings for easy clean up.

I love meatloaf and have tried many, MANY recipes from books and cooking sites. This one is really, really good. I sauteed the onions with a clove of minced garlic and added about 1T. worstestershire to the meat mixture. Also added a tsp. of spicy brown mustard to the sauce (spread on top). Don't use a loaf pan - just form the meat mixture into about a 5"x9" mound on a lined cookie sheet.

I reviewed this recipe before I made it by telling how I’d do it in a Microwave Oven.  I have since done it and will tell you the results.  First, I used ground buffalo but only 1 lb.  I used oatmeal instead of cracker or bread crumbs.  Big mistake, will try bread crumbs next time.  I reduced the water, another mistake, as you need to use more in a microwave.  I used barbeque sauce instead of ketchup and mixed it with the brown sugar and put it on top.  I also used the onion soup mix instead of an onion.  I’ll try the onion next time.  I will also save out some sauce to put on the meatloaf when eating.  I cooked it for 20 minutes in the microwave.  That was too much time.  It was done but the top got kind of hard.  Hope this helps anyone who tries the microwave method.

All in all, very good.  I did think it was a little too sweet so next time I'll cut down on the brown sugar just a tad.  I did like the glaze on top.  I also used bread crumbs instead of crackers since I had those on hand.  Very good and will make again.. just cut back on the brown sugar a little. Thanks for the terrific recipe!

This is how my mom makes it, the only difference is she adds Worcestershire to the ketchup mixture and instead of saltines she uses crushed ritz crackers, which gives it a more buttery flavor. This recipe is great.

Great easy meatloaf. I follow the recipe except for saltines were "Ritz type" crackers, and my ginger was fresh for the topping. I also used a splash of Worscestshire sauce ( a bit of both in the meat and in the topping), and pulverized a half of a onion in my food processor. The onion used that way, really increases the flavor and adds to the moistness. I have made this before and still agree the sauce needs to be on top. It saturates the meat, and if you are real lucky even get carmalized edges due to the brown sugar. I serve it with mashed potatoes, green beans or peas, and dinner rolls. I have even divided up the meatloaf mixture and made separate meatloaf muffins, using my muffin tin. Once in a while I will throw a chunk of cheese in the center of each muffin tin mixture. Family loves it. Today I snuck in finely chopped mushrooms, celery, and carrot. It is in the oven as we speak, we will see if the picky kids notice.

very tasty, more so than another brown sugar meatloaf recipe i found on this website. i used only 1/4 c of brown sugar as recommended by several other reviewers. i also mixed in about 1 tbsp of worcestshire sauce with the ketchup. i wasn't sure how to pack the meat in the 9x5 pan w/o disrupting the brown sugar/ketchup layers. as someone else mentioned, it was difficult to turn over because the sauce splattered. also the loaf was quite lopsided---not attractive! i will definitely make it again, but i will mix the brown sugar and ketchup, and will pour it on top of the loaf.

THANK YOU for sharing such a good recipe!!!!  I have made meatloaf for my husband and he never really cares for it---this time he couldn't stop saying how much he liked this.  He said it tasted like baby back rib sauce on it.  I took out the onions because my husband & daughter arn't huge onion fans, and we all ate until our stomaches were hurting (lol).  It did look a little mushy while making it, but it came out delicious!!!  I made it with mashed potatoes & corn---yummmmyyy.  The leftovers I had for lunch the next day, and they tasted great. The second time I made this my daughter helped me--we used small loaf pans, and I added the onions to mine, and she added cheese to hers.  She really got a HUGE kick out of making her own, and she ate more than usual. :)

The kids call it sweet meat! They love it but it is on the sweet side. I reduced the brown sugar just a bit. To those who question why it is in the bottom of the pan: it allows the flavors to steam into the meatloaf and not dry it out. You are supposed to remove it from the pan by inverting it onto a plate to serve and then your sauce IS on TOP! Simple and yummy!

This was Okay. I normally dont add milk to my meatloaf...I added eggs, bread pieces (didnt have crackers) bell pepper, garlic, onion powder, S&P, milk. I added ketchup/brown sugar on top, this was a good recipe, maybe needed a bit more flavor for me.

This was the second meatloaf recipe I tried. It was good. I read some of the reviews and took some comments into consideration. Like others I thought that it called for a  bit too much milk and it came out a little too mushy. I also put the brown sugar and ketchup on the top instead of the bottom. It was a good recipe. I will definately try this one again but alter the ingredients a bit. It was very simple!

If you're looking for a different meatloaf recipe, try this one.  It's original in flavor.  I added sauted bacon pieces to the mix to "kick it up a notch" and incorporate another element of flavor that paired well with the brown sugar.  This also tasted *wonderful* the next day for lunch.

I did make a little more of the sauce then what's called for and put it on top of the loaf the last 10-15 minutes of baking.  To the sauce, I added worchestershire sauce, dijon mustard, and garlic powder.  

p.s. If you don't like your meat sweet, then don't try this one.  Or don't try this and rate it poorly.  It is "brown sugar" meatloaf.  If this is you, try the Rempel meatloaf (also on this website.)

I've been making my own excellent meatloaf for over 20 years, so I did not use the actual "meat loaf" ingredients, what I did do was make the ketchup/brown sugar glaze.  I did not put it on the bottom, but put it on top of the meatloaf.  It was so tasty that I will never make my meatloaf again without this glaze.  With the leftovers I made sandwiches and I couldn't help but lick my fingers!

Want to make this one even better?  Substitute a 1/2 lb. of the beef with regular Jimmy Dean Sausage... I have converted non-meatloaf lovers over.  It has been a staple in our house for years now.

Good basic meatloaf recipe-good as written or you can add chopped green peppers to meat mixture.  I personally don't care for the ginger. I agree with many others that the brown sugar and ketchup needs to go on top of the loaf. And one more trick to pass along-when I make meatloaf I always place a few slices of bread( end crusts work best but any bread will do) on the bottom of the pan and then place my meatloaf on the bread slices -bread soaks up all the extra grease that cooks out of the meat and makes for a less greasy -bottomed meatloaf!!

Yes, there are so many ways to make meatloaf. I have to say, love this one. Everyone always ask for the recipe. It's so easy, has just the right ingredients. I too put the ketchup and brown sugar on top while cooking. I also add fresh ginger, about 1 Tbl, instead of dry ground. Thank you for the great recipe. :)

The only reason this got even gets three stars is because my 6 year old liked it. I added soy sauce and garlic to offset the sugary sweetness. The meatloaf itself was incredibly bland. My kid ate the top w/ the sauce and then smothered the rest of the meat w/ ranch dressing. With my changes, the topping was pretty good, I just wish there was some on every bite. All in all, this recipe was a failure. I might try the topping again on a more flavorful meatloaf

It was a little too sweet for me, wish I would have tried the dry mustard, as suggested by a reviewer. I did try the Worsechester sauce- which was fine, but I prefer my meat loaf with garlic powder, bell peppers and plenty of salt and pepper. Wont try this one again, but may borrow the topping (sauce) for my own meatloaf recipe. Wasn't too impressed. :/ Darn it.

This is a great meatloaf recipe. It has a really nice flavor. 1. I found that 3/4 cups of milk a lot. I added it a little at a time and found that 1/2 a cup was plenty. 2.I also added about 3 tablespoons of soy sauce to enhance the pepper flavor and give it more kick. 3. Instead of making it in one big loaf I rolled it into 1 cup size balls, pushed my thumb down in the middle and spooned the ketchup/brown sugar sauce into the hole in the middle. (I like to make mini-meatloafs so that I can easily freeze them and they are also in serving size portions.) If you do it this way turn the heat down a bit since they are smaller they will cook faster.

To make it GLUTEN FREE I added 3/4 cup of crushed up tortilla chips in place of the crushed up saltine crackers.

I had panko crumbs to use up instead of crackers.  Also, I was out of brown sugar so used a little turbinado sugar with a drizzle of molasses.  My family was in need of some comfort food, one kid had actually asked for meatloaf.  This recipe was the best I've tried.

I add bacon bits and finely chopped white onions. I put italian bread crumbs and the brown sugar mixure in the middle and on top.
I get request for this all the time. My largest meat loaf so far is 8 lbs.

THE best meatloaf!  I have been making this recipe for years since I found this recipe and everyone agrees that they have never had better.  I use the meatloaf mix of veal, ground beef and pork from the grocery store instead of just ground beef, and substitute the crackers with italian style bread crumbs instead.  The ketchup and brown sugar on the bottom of the pan absorbs into the meatloaf and there is plenty to pour over the meatloaf once you take a slice.  I also have never used the ginger in this recipe.

This recipe is great.. I really liked the meatloaf :) 

After reading other users' reviews, I decided to make some changes. I used 1 medium onion instead of a small onion, I reduced the amount of brown sugar to 1/4 cup. I also added some drops of worcestshire in the ketchup. In addition, I substituted 3/4 cup egg matzohs for 3/4 cup soltine cracker crumbs. It turned out to be great. I will make this meatloaf again :)

Great recipe.  I followed instrutions and put brown sugar on bottom and compacted it followed by ketchup.  Because some reviews said it did not add much flavor, on the top I added equal parts brown sugar and ketchup and blened them into a paste and used it as a glaze on the top. It got nice and brown.  
I also substituted onion soup mix for onion and added steak sauce as recommended.
Kids loved it.

I've been making this recipe now for about a year and it is one of our all time favorites! I've found that I like to mix the brown sugar and ketchup into the meatloaf mixture better than packing it on the bottom of the loaf pan.
The sweet and tangy flavor makes it into every bite! A real winner!

Doubled the recipe and left out the milk as it was moist enough. Added a bit more mustard powder. We are not big meatloaf fans but I had some ground beef that needed to be used -- We were very impressed.

Absolutely delicious meatloaf.  We made a few adjustments: only 1/4 cup of brown sugar to keep the sweetness down, only 1/4 cup of milk because the mixture had plenty of moisture and we added 1 teaspoon of garlic powder.  Per the suggestion of other users, we also spread the brown sugar/ketchup mixture over the top.

Excellent.  Made this for the family and my two teen boys had another friend over for dinner.  Those boys each had about 3 huge slices of the loaf and ate nearly the whole thing (and I used 3 lbs of meat).  I made the sauce and added some yellow mustard to create a sweet, sharp taste.  They tore into the sauce too.  This gets a A++ in my book.  I was hoping for leftover meatloaf sandwiches the next day, but my older son sot to the leftovers first and finished it off :-)  This is a keeper.

I just made this meatloaf for a group of 10 and everyone absolutely loved it.  I am not a fan of meatloaf but loved this recipe.  I doubled and used two loaf pans.  I also put half of the ketchup, brown sugar mixture on the bottom and the other half on the top.  I had to cook about 30 minutes more for a total bake time of 1 and 1/2 hours.  I also added about a 1 1/2 teaspoons of dales sauce or worstishire.  Excellent!  My husband loves meatloaf anf he could not stop raving about this recipe!  Loved this!!

I LOVED the ginger in the meatloaf.  I wouldn't call it bland or ordinary at all.  I took advice of a previous reviewer and used 1/2 the brown sugar ketchup on top and 1/2 on bottom.  Too good!  I won't go back to my old meatloaf.

My husband really liked this meatloaf, although I thought it was WAY too sweet!  If I make it again I'll definitely cut down on the brown sugar!  Also, I thought the meatloaf part itself was pretty bland and needed some spices or something to "zip it up" a bit.  In addition to adding extra spices, I think some chopped green peppers might also help to give it a little more flavor.  I also thought that using a whole chopped onion was way too much -- even a small one.  I would use half that much if I ever made it again.  In fact, I think if I ever made this again I would probably use my own meatloaf recipe and then add the glaze to it, making sure to reduce the brown sugar down to 1/4 cup or less.

I have used this recipe several times and actually alternate my meatloaf dinners between different recipes. I think the meatloaf stays moist, by putting the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom I think the flavor melds through the meatloaf and adds an element of surprise to the consumer. I use a good grade or 90 - 95%% fat free ground beef so I never have a problem with meatloaf or anything I make being greasy. This recipe is very tasty and not your every day meatloaf recipe but a nice alternative. It makes great leftovers for sandwiches too!

I have used this glaze for meatloaf for a long time.  I actually add a few shakes of red wine vinegar to the ketchup and brown sugar.  It just adds another depth of flavor to the glaze. You need to adjust to taste.  I also put the glaze on top of the meatloaf, because my loaf pan has another pan that sits inside it with holes for the grease to drip away from the meatloaf.  I use my own meatloaf recipe (in my head), but the glaze is what gives it the flavor.  Awesome!!

Amazing. Like whoa amazing. The only changes I made were that I used seasoned bread crumbs and panko bread crumbs in the meatloaf because I like the carbs :) I also doubled the ketchup and brown sugar mix and mixed a little into the meatloaf too. i wish i had put the bread slices on the bottom because there was a lot of grease, even though I used very lean ground beef. Am going to try turkey next time. i think it is the ginger that really makes this recipe delicious. Try it in a sandwich with a little cheddar cheese and the brown sugar ketchup mix. i know it is probably the most fattening thing ever but i kept eating it after i was totally full. that is how delicious it is!

I use ground turkey in place of the beef and use Ritz crackers in place of the saltine crackers. Always turns out great!

This is my favorite! I didn't change a thing I do put the ketchup and brown sugar on top. I also put some bread slices on the bottom to soak up the grease so the meatloaf doesn't sit in it. Delicious! Thanks for sharing.

I like a mix of sweet and savory, but this was wayyyyy too sweet. I used less sugar and otherside did everything according to the recipe. It was yummy, and i will make it again probably using turkey to make it low fat. Also, i like to put it on top of the meatloaf instead of underneath.

If I could give this no stars I would. This is bland but achingly sweet. There is more than enough sugar in everyone's diet without making our meat entrees sweet also. Just look at the nutritional breakdown and see how many carbohydrates are in this! This was not to our liking.

I have been using this recipe for many years - my mother passed it on to me.  Same recipe as this one, only after baking 1 hour at 375 deg., turn meatloaf upside down to serve. That's the trick!

My whole family loves this one, especially the wife because she has a sweet-tooth. My favorite meatloaf recipe to date. Putting the brown sugar and ketchup in the bottom of the pan makes all the flavor cook into the meatloaf making every bite amazing, definitely the way to go!

I agree with many others that the glaze should be on the top. I also don't put my meatloaf in a bread pan,I take a cooling rack and cover it with foil and poke some holes in the foil and put the rack over a cookie sheet and the grease drains thru the holes.

Before making this I read through a few reviews and made a few changes, which made this a totally awesome meatloaf.  I managed to bribe my 2.5 year old to eat all her cauliflower by telling her she'd get another slice, so it's a winner for me.  My changes: make the sauce less sweet by adding mustard and paprika, use BBQ sauce instead of tomato, and add a drop of honey to help it glaze, and add more flavour to the meat by using italian bread crumbs, using a shallot instead of a white onion, and adding some chili powder.  I also took the suggestion of putting half the sauce/glaze on the top.  Result = YUM

Too sweet for my taste. I only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar, and I added Worcestershire sauce, and it was still too sweet. I also only used 1/4 cup of milk, and I'm glad I did. The consistency was perfect, and I imagine it would have been pretty mushy if I had used the amount of milk that the recipe called for. I used bread crumbs instead of cracker crumbs as well. I also put half of the Worcestershire, ketchup, brown sugar mixture on the bottom and half on the top. Overall this was not my favorite recipe. Not sure I'll make it again.

This ended up too sweet. I put the ketchup on top because that's what I'm used to, but even with ketchup it was too sweet. I ended up adding a lot of salt and pepper to it after it was cooked. Also, when I made it in a loaf pan, all the drippings were drowning the loaf. I would form it into a loaf and then bake it in a 9x13 pan and drain it a few times during cooking.

I love meatloaf and this is a great recipe! Cooked for 1 hour, put the sauce on top, and cut the brown sugar to 1/4. I also followed the rec of another reviewer to use only 1 egg, but when I cut into the loaf, it started falling apart, so next time I will stick w/ the original recipe and use two. 

I didn't drain the grease periodically while cooking, as one reviewer suggested, and next time I definitely need to do that - there was a lot of leftover fat/oil collected at the end! (I used 85% lean ground beef)

The sauce is what makes the meat loaf so good. This is a keeper!

I made this meatloaf last night exactly to recipe and it turned out delicious. I let it sit for about 30 minutes before serving. In the loaf pan it was sitting in the meat, sugar and ketchup juices so what I did was plated the meatloaf on a serving dish, sliced it and then poured the juices over the meatloaf before serving. I had two slices and my boyfriend ate the rest completely by himself, he loved it. I am making it again Sunday night for guests, I am thinking of making three pans of it because I know we will want left overs. Thank you so very much for the best meatloaf recipe I have ever came across, this will now be the meatloaf I will make for now on.... ** Just an update, since making this recipe I now make it every week, we absolutely love it! Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This was the best meatloaf ever. Made it tonight and daughter never wants to eat meatloaf and she loved this. Had it with red skinned mashed potatoes and green beans. My boyfriend and our daughter and me couldn't stop eating it. I did double the sauce and put the sauce on top instead of bottom for last 15 minutes. I also put two slices of wheat bread on bottom to soak up grease and it gives a nice flavor that tastes great with the sugar in the sauce. I also did as others suggested and I added a tbsp. each of Worchestire sauce and liquid smoke. Will never make another meatloaf recipe ever!

Amazingly good! I doubled the recipe and made 2 loaves. I also sauteed the onion and 4 cloves of garlic and then added it to the meat mixture. For the topping, I added about a teaspoon of worchestershire sauce o the ketchup and brown sugar. It was so delicious, even my picky 5 year old loved it!

This is probably the best meatloaf I have ever made.  The smell permeating my house was intoxicating, making it very difficult to wait for the meatloaf to cook all the way through!!  I decreased the brown sugar to 1/4 cup, added worcester sauce to the glaze (which I put on TOP of the meatloaf), and sauteed onions and garlic before adding them to them to the meat.  Also, I read this great tip about placing slices of bread on the bottom of the meatloaf pan to soak up all of the extra fat...worked like a charm!....Strangely enough, I caught my Hubby eating the grease soaked bread after dinner (..weirdo), defeating the entire purpose..go figure! :~)

This was so freaking good I had to stop myself from eating out of the pan when I put it away.  I don't think I'll ever make meatloaf any other way again.  It required more cook time, and I used a meatloaf pack that had pork as well as beef.  I am quite fond of meatloaf in general, but this was by far the best I've ever had.  I thought that the liquid would be too much, but it kept the meat very moist and combined with it well.  I also used regular bread crumbs instead of saltines.

This is a good basic meatloaf.  I didn't have saltines, so I subbed Panko breadcrumbs.  I added some garlic and a few dashes of worchestershire sauce.  I also put the ketchup/brown sugar mixture on top instead of the bottom.

I thought the recipe was great!  I made the changes most people did where I reduced milk to a 1/2 cup and reduced brown sugar to 1/3 cup.  Instead of saltine crackers, I used Italian herb bread crumbs and instead of onion, I used a Lipton onion soup mix packet.  I also used about 1 tsp chopped garlic and added about 2 tsp mustard to the  ketchup/brown sugar mixture.  Next time I make it, I will reduce the brown sugar to about 1/4 cup and will let the meatload refridgerate overnight (without the sauce) for the flavors to sink in more.  I would also reduce the salt to about 1/2 due the salt in the soup mix.  I thought it was super tasty, had great texture, and made the house smell amazing.  I would definitely want to serve it to guests due to its simplicity and how perfect it turned out!

My daughters share an apt while away in college and discovered this recipe. They loved it so much that they cooked it for me when they came home for Summer. I was blown away!! Really moist meatloaf, definitely a keeper. A week later I asked them to make it again... ;-)

The ginger gives this a really neat flavor. Here's what I did: used 1 egg, less milk, garlic salt (vs. reg. salt), Italian breadcrumbs (vs. saltines), minced onion (vs. fresh). I made extra of the ketchup/br. sugar mixture, and put it on top (vs. the bottom). I took off the foil for the last 10 min. Thanks for a yummy recipe!

I've been making this recipe for a couple of years now.  It's like the meatloaf my mom made.  I love the combination of ingredients and think they are right-on.  However...I think it's better and easier to place the meat mixture in a baking pan (like a 9 x 13 oblong cake pan), form the meat into the shape of a loaf making the top a little concave.  I mix the brown sugar and ketchup together and put it on top of the meat.  Than I bake it as directed.  After baking, I let it stand a few minutes.  Then, I pick it up by the help of a metal spatula and place it on a serving platter.  It's easier to control the appearance of the loaf and sauce this way.  I don't know...it works better for me this way.  Great recipe!

Just made this recipe tonight. Without a doubt, the best meatloaf both my husband and I have ever had, anywhere! DELICIOUS!! I used 2# gr.beef,italian bread crumbs,1/2 c milk,2 TB worsteshire, mixed together the catsup & brown sugar and put half in the bottom of the (silicone,never sticks)meat loaf pan and the remaining on top.(just minor adjustments for what I had on hand) Baked at 350 for 1 1/2 hr..let rest 15 min...Sliced perfectly. GREAT JOB!

This is by far the BEST meatloaf I've ever tasted,and my family agrees. I did change a few things. I added about a TB of worshestire sauce and a tsp. of yellow mustard to the brown sugar mix. I also added a TB worshestire sauce to the meat and a half cup of extra chopped onions and a medium chopped green pepper. Also added a few cloves of garlic to the bottom of the pan halfway through along with some sliced red peppers. YUM!!! I'd give this more stars if I could.

I made the recipe as written (based on 4.5 stars from thousands of reviewers). The only change I made was to decrease the amount of brown sugar. I still found it to be too sweet, to have too much liquid on the bottom, and to have too much chopped onion (I used a small onion, as written). Others have made great suggestions for improvement, but frankly, I think that constitutes a different recipe. My mother's 50-year old recipe called "everyday meatloaf" is way better than this. Sorry...will never make this again.

Husband and kids loved this!  My only meatloaf recipe now.  For kids I use muffin pans and can then serve individual portions easily.  Everyone requested I put more brown sugar and ketchup on top as well.

This is THE BEST meatloaf I've ever had! Only thing I do different is keep the brown sugar-ketchup mixture on top of the loaf. I tried it both ways, and it's just a personal preference. Serve with a baked potato, some peas or green beans, & you're in business!

Sooo happy with this recipe! My mom, who has never wanted to let go of her old recipe for meatloaf, liked this a lot and even had me make it twice in one week! I did make some changes to it, however, so here goes: first, skipped the ginger; next, I sauteed 1 onion, about 2 celery stalks, 1 green pepper, and 2 cloves of garlic in oil before adding to meat. I did add closer to 2 lbs of ground beef, as well. Also, besides the veggie saute, I add lots of Worchestire sauce, some steak sauce (just a little), and I use bread crumbs instead of crushed crackers. Also, I pour a little steak sauce on top of the ketchup at the bottom of the pan. I just like the zing it gives. Anyway, seems like a lot of changes, but I still have to thank this recipes for serving as a base. I was very skeptical at using the sugar and ketchup at first, but now I make my meatloaf with it everytime. It just gives it that awesome glaze at the bottom. Cheers to Starbuck for providing this recipe, it's the best.

Very good--but a little too sweet.  Next time I make this (and there definately will be a next time), I will reduce the amount of brown sugar to 1/3 a cup.  I may also try tomato soup as opposed to the catsup.

I did make a couple of changes on this first try:  1) used a packet of lipton onion soup mix instead of chopped onion; 2) used Italian style breadcrumbs in place of saltines; 3) added worsteshire sauce (1 tbl) to sauce; 4) mixed 1/3 of sauce in meat mixture, and 1/3 on bottom of pan, and 1/3 on top of meat mixture.

Served this with mashed potatoes and corn mixed with red and green peppers.  You need to serve side dishes that are spicy to offset the sweetness of this loaf.

All in all, a great recipe.  Thanks!

This is a really good meatloaf recipe. I've also made the hamburger mix up, shaped them into patties and then placed them in a baking dish of the brown sugar and ketchup mix to make really tasty burgers.

This is so good!  My son ate 3 pieces, everyone liked it.  This will be the meatloaf recipe I use from now on.  After baking, I let it set for awhile, then inverted it.  All the yummy sauce was then on top.

Sorry, I didn't think this was good at all.  My kids wouldn't eat it after the first couple of bites,neither would I.  My husband thought it was good and said he would eat what everyone else didn't eat for lunch the next couple of days.  
I think it was the ginger that added to the "funky" taste.  I won't be making this again.

Very good!  I also reduced the amount of brown sugar & added extra seasonings.  I used Italian bread crumbs instead of bread.  The whole family really enjoyed this meatloaf.  My oldest son (who doesn't like meatloaf at all), said it was good!  Thanks for this recipe!

I followed this recipe to the tee with two exceptions: (1) I took the advice of reviewers who recommended splitting the ketchup and brown sugar on the top and bottom of the loaf (good suggestion!) and (2) I used fresh grated ginger instead of ground ginger. I'm convinced that the ginger is what makes this meatloaf taste outstanding. I *highly* recommend using fresh ginger!  Regarding the sweetness of the loaf: I was somewhat concerned that the meat was going to be *too* sweet after reading some of the reviews; however, I found the flavors to be well-balanced. Another recommendation: Use lean ground beef.  An 80% lean will have your loaf floating in grease after an hour baking.  Spend the extra quarter and get 90% lean.  I really enjoyed the flavor of this loaf, but my teenage son said that he prefers my traditional Swedish meatloaf recipe.

I thought that this was pretty good. The kids however, thought that it was too sweet.  My husband is on what I call a "traveling spurt" (he travels on business every week tuesday-thursday for about two months in the beginning of every year) so I scaled the recipe down to 3 & cut the brown sugar from 1/2 cup to 1/4 cup (and they still thought it was sweet).  The meat itself was very tender & tasty.  Thanks Starbuck!

This is a good meatloaf, A little sweet though. I also added ketchup in the meat to cut the sweetness(2tblspn). Secondly I added 1tblspn garlic powder. Thirdly I substituted the crackers for plain bread crumbs. As a cook I know next time after reducing the amount of brown sugar in half this will be one of the best meatloafs around. Enjoy, easy and quick, but definately restaraunt quality!!

I tried this recipe, but used the onion soup mix instead, and added a bit of dry mustard to the brown sugar/ketchup.  Everyone in my family commented on how good it was.  That's the only time anyone in my family commented on my meat loaf.  I've been trying to find a good recipe.  This one is definately a keeper!!!!

Made it first time last night - the taste was such a pleasant surprise!  This has replaced my "ol' favorite" meatloaf recipe forever!  One suggestion - when turning the loaf over do it over the sink - the sweet topping splashes a bit.

this was absolutely DE-Lish!  it tasted so good and was very easy to prepare.  i used onion soup mix instead of chopping a small onion and i did keep it in the oven for an additional 15 minutes.  Wonderful recipe...2 thumbs up!

I thought this was the best meatloaf I've ever tasted. Just make sure you use lean ground beef, otherwise 3/4 cup of milk the recipe calls for it makes it too moist. I also had to cook it a little longer. This is a keeper!

The main reason that this dish didn't turn out is due to my own lack of experience making any sort of meatloaf before. It's not because it is a hard dish to make but I have learned through this what I should (and should not) do next time. I used 2 lbs of meat, which needed longer baking time and even then, there was still parts that were uncooked. By accident, I added some ketchup to the mixture instead of placing it on top of the brown sugar, which resulted in parts that were mushy. So, the lack of success is my own fault (not the recipe's) and I may make this again because parts that were done were good and the brown sugar really is a sweet touch.

No, no noooo..brown sugar did not agree with me!  I couldn't stand the sweet flavor, though my husband thought it wasn't too bad.  The meat mixture itself was okay, but the sauce ruined it in my book.  Never again.

I've made this recipe exactly as stated.  Loved it.  I don't quite understand someone reviewing a recipe, giving it say 5 stars, and then stating "I used this instead of that, this much of this and changed this to that".  That would be a review of your meatloaf, not the printed one.  I have nothing against changing a recipe but don't review it unless it's as made as stated in the recipe. After that change it to your hearts content and enjoy! Sharyn

This meatloaf recipe is by far the best I have ever eaten.  I also took the suggestions of using only 1/2 cup milk, and placed the brown sugar/ketchup sauce on top.  The brown sugar/ketchup helps make the meatloaf, and I just didn't want the extra grease mixing in with it.  Awesome...recommend!!!

I'll start by saying I hate meatloaf! BUT, this is a pretty good recipe. My husband, who loves meatloaf thinks this is an awesome recipe. So for us this one is a keeper. I did follow the recipe exactly except I did add a bit of garlic. FYI - Grate your onion into the mixing bowl. You won't have to sauté them first and the juice from grating it go right into the meatloaf as well.

Made this tonight with mom's paprika potatoes. It was great! I sautéed the onions with celery and it added flavour and a nice bit of crunch to the meatloaf.

This recipe was amazing!  BEST meatloaf I have ever made.  I went through the reviews and tried a few suggestions. The best idea was to put bread in the bottom of the pan to absorb the fat/oil.  I did that and it worked perfectly.  I added some garlic, a of cloves or so but my meat was about 3 1/4 lbs.  I also added some Worcestershire to the brown sugar/ketchup mixture as well as the meat.  I did Italian breadcrumbs instead of crackers. I did a package of onion soup mix and a half an onion as well.  We are garlic/onion lovers!  I tend to eye and not measure when I add to my recipes. Putting some of the glaze on the top of the bread in the bottom of the pan, then coating the top and sides of the meatloaf really flavored it. Thanks for the great recipe! Thanks to all the reviewers too! =)

Very good!  I made some modifications: 1/2 C milk, 1 C plain bread crumbs instead of crackers,  added 1 T Worcester sauce, only 1/4 C brown sugar, only 1 egg, added the following 3 cloves minced garlic, added 1t oregano, 1t dried mustard, 1t garlic powder, 2T tomato paste.  Maybe this is another recipe entirely?  My family loved it with baked califlower on the side.

My family and I have made this recipe at LEAST a dozen times. It is now a staple in our home for a monthly dinner. The whole dish is just old school Meatloaf. It's unbelievably good. We double the sauce and serve the dish with homemade mashed potatoes.

I made this recipe for my husband. I don't eat beef, so I didn't try it, but he LOVED it. Like many others on here, I mixed the brown sugar and ketchup and poured it over the top of the loaf. I also did not use a loaf pan but shaped it and cooked it in the middle of a large casserole dish. Will definitely make this again!

My family loooooved this recipe!
I tweeked it a bit, I sauteed some onions,red and green bell pepper and mixed it in with the rest of the ingredients. I didn't add teh sauce at the bottom of the pan, i found it kinda pointless. 
as the meatloaf was cooking i was basically braising it with the sauce, it was delicious!!

I put the ketchup and brown sugar on top of the meat. It gave it great flavor. The meat was not cooked all the way in the middle after an hour, so I had to put it back in the oven for another 10 minutes. Then it was great. Thanks for a great recipe!

Good recipe. I always put a couple bread slices on the bottom of the pan first and put the meatloaf on top. I totally agree that the catsup mixture needs to go on top and in the pan. Some runs off to the bottom in cooking.  I switch with saltines or breadcrumbs but we like the saltines the best.

This was so tasty! I like many others put the brown sugar and ketchup mix on top of my loaf as opposed to under. I also added 2 tsp of Worcestershire sauce in the ketchup mix. I had to cook mine about 30 extra minutes though. Still tasty!

I always remember needing loads of Ketchup when my mom made meatloaf. Not the case here. This recipe is seasoned to perfection. This is my husband's favorite and it floors me whenever he specifically requests meatloaf for dinner. Who REQUESTS meatloaf? Apparently those who make a meal with this recipe.

I've made this twice now, and it is an excellent recipe. I like the idea of two pieces of bread underneath to absorb the extra fat and it worked really well. Someone also suggested adding the glaze on top near the end of the cooking time, so I tried that, but it ended up as more of a sauce than a glaze, so next time I'll put the glaze on top when the loaf goes in the oven.  But for sure this recipe is a keeper!

Great recipe, very simple, great basic recipe that can use some personal touches.  I decided to: 1. Made a brown sugar/ketchup glaze and added few splashes of hot sauce. I spread it atop the loaf, 30 mins after it went in the oven. 2. Used a 2:1 ground beef/pork mixture. 3. Half an onion and 1/2 chopped green bell peppers. 4. Instead of baking in a loaf pan, I used the pan to form the loaf, then cooked it in a cookie sheet. It lets the fat run off and crisps the bottom and sides, as well as the top (thanks Alton Brown for the tip)! One last note: only needed 1/2 cup milk, I like my loaf a bit drier than the one in the video.

This is an easy meatloaf to prepare with great results. No leftovers after this meal. Didn't change anything. Served this with white rice for a simple weeknight meal.

Great Meatloaf Basic but I added garlic instead of ginger also oyster sauce and Italian bread crumbs 1/2 cup milk and 1/3  Italian sausage Baked in a Meatloaf Pan with holes that sits up above the bottom of pan so its an insert loaf pan that  holds the juices away from the meat and it came out lovely

Great taste!  Would cut milk down to 1/2 C next time as there was lots of juice to pour off.  Used 1/4 C brown sugar, but I think 2 tablespoons might be enough.  I also used Italian bread crumbs instead of saltines for the added seasoning, and I added a splash of Worchestershire to the topping.  I put the sauce on top this time, but might split it half on top and half on the bottom next time.  Mine took 1 1/2 hours to bake, but I'll try it in a shallower baking pan next time.  Moist and flavorful.

This is the BEST meatloaf recipe ever!  It is the only one I use in my house!  Sometimes I add a little more brown sugar, because I like it sweet.

By far the best meatloaf recipe. It's so simple yet tasty. My son and I enjoy every morsel of it every time I make it! The leftover makes a great meatloaf sandwich.
I have made this in a muffin tin, topped with mash potatoes, into a loaf pan, etc. 
Once I added chopped fresh ginger instead and that added nice tasty crunch.

This meatloaf is so tasty!!  I do make several adjustments though.  Instead of onion, I add about a half of a green pepper finely minced.  Also, only 2 tbs. of brown sugar.  The combination is fantastic.

I tried this recipe looking for a new meatloaf one and I only make it now. Everyone loves it. The only thing I did differently is I mixed the brown sugar and ketchup in a bowl and put it on top.

Delicious. I added shredded carrots and chopped celery too. Reduce sugar to only 1/4 c!  And used ground turkey. Add 1 T worcestershire sauce to the sauce and to the filling as well.

I was in the mood for meat loaf, but didn't have a seasoning packet, so I came here. It was delicious! The only thing I did differently was top it with Sweet Baby Ray's hickory brown sugar bbq sauce because I don't like ketchup on meat loaf. This was so good that my husband completely finished it off! Also, great tip about bread on the bottom of the pan to soak up the grease.

I do like this recipe, a lot. I've made it according to the recipe and I find that the amount of grease depends on the ground beef you use, obviously. I cook mine on a cookie sheet with sides. I shape it and place it on a few pieces of bread on a cooling rack in the pan. The bread absorbs grease and keeps the meat from falling into the spaces. If the bread is thin I'll put some foil under it, making sure its the size of the loaf so the grease drains off. Everyone loves my meatloaf. I do add a good bit of onion and garlic powder now since I decided it made it even better. All in all, it's a really solid recipe. I just tweaked the method.

I made this recipe exactly as listed..not a single change and it was fantastic!!! I loved this sweet meatloaf but can understand if some would prefer it less sweet...no me. It was yummy. I even put the sugar and ketchup on the bottom and so many reviewers questioned this but let me tell you... it was my favorite part. It created a sweet sauce at the bottom of the pan that was soaked up into the meatloaf and that I used to drizzle over my meat and potatoes. No side of ketchup needed with this meatloaf...YUM!!! Maybe try it once as is before you start making all the unnecessary changes.

This was tasty and the family enjoyed it. I would have to agree with the reviewers who said to put the glaze on top, it worked out just fine the way it's written, but inverting the pan was a but messy. I would also use less salt, but I used dried chopped onion, so maybe that is why.  So, for me, less salt, more onion and glaze on top is what I'd do next time. It's good as written though! :)

Thank you Tangastar!  I love finding a really good recipe and tweaking it to my family's tastes.  I followed another reviewer’s great tip and put sliced raw potato in the bottom of the loaf pan to raise the meatloaf out of the oily juices.  To the meat mixture I added a green bell pepper - 1/4" dice (because me Mum always did) and a clove of garlic put through a garlic press; reduced the milk to 1/2 cup and used 1 egg.  For the glaze I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup, added 1.5 tsp Worcestershire (because I don't LOVE Worcestershire, but miss it when it's not in the recipe - this amount was perfect for me), added several shakes of Cholula hot sauce and put the glaze on top.  YumEE!  I’m looking forward to trying this with Ritz Crackers or breadcrumbs to find out which binder we like best.  Both Hubby & I LOVED this and we haven’t said that about meatloaf in a long time.

This was really good! I didn't make any chanages, I added the sugar and ketchup to the bottom of the loaf pan. I do however have to agree with some reviewers that using this size loaf pan makes the meat sit in the grease, I would use a bigger dish next time when cooking. I also had to cook longer than stated, it seemed like forever for this meatloaf to get cooked all the way. But on the bright side I WILL be making this again with some minor cooking alterations.

I am not a meatloaf fan..but my husband is...so I tried this recipe and I am proud to admit that I too now eat meatloaf :)  The only change I made was to use Italian seasoned breadcrumbs instead of the saltines. Great and easy recipe.

Added chopped celery, green pepper and lots of garlic. No ketchup so used chili sauce on hand, added generous shot of worcestershire sauce, cut down on brown sugar. Yummy glaze. Limited time so shapped into big hamburger patties.  Coated with glaze last 10 minutes. Baked on on top of broiling pan sprayed with Pam.  Grease went through slats so "burgers" were not sitting in it. Total baking time 45 minutes. Could use a bit more zip, next time will add some dijon mustard. Everyone very happy. Definitely a keeper.

I have never liked meatloaf before, but we had unexpected company one evening and I had all of the ingredients on hand, so I thought I'd give this a try.  I am glad I did!  Everyone loved it (including myself!)  I only changed one thing.  I didn't have any saltine crackers, so I substituted Ritz crackers.  But I will definitely make this again, and so will my guests who requested a copy of this recipe.  Thank you!

It's super-duper if you like a sweeter, ketchup-y meatloaf.   I used the opportunity to add some more veggies, worcheshire, wheat germ, and some other sneaky mom things to make it healthy.  I took others' advice and made some in cupcake tins, then froze for my husband to take to work, and made and froze a large one for dinner another night.  It's in the oven right now.

I mixed all the ingredients together and lined my pan with a narrow rectangle of parchment paper to make removal from the pan easier. I followed cooking instructions and it was wonderful, moist and yummy. My whole family loved it and it made great leftovers!

I have made this several times and its a big hit!  Make sure you use lean ground beef and not regular meat as the extra fat will make the meat loaf watery.  Its great!

This was a good basic meatloaf but I guess because of so many reviews I expected something with a real "wow" factor.  The brown sugar/ketchup mixture is how my mother always made it when I was growing up so this wasn't anything new or special to me.   Just due to experience I knew to 1) soak the breadcrumbs (I chose to use instead of crackers) in milk before adding to the meat mixture 2) saute the onions in olive oil vs. adding raw onion (I added garlic to saute too)  3) sugar/ketchup on top, not bottom with less sugar than the recipe calls for and 4) do not put in loaf pan; meatloaf is best when formed into a mounded loaf shape and placed on foil on top of a sheet cake/jelly roll pan.  This meatloaf was not as good as the one I make with salsa that creates a very moist and tender meatloaf.  It was nice to try a new meatloaf recipe but I think I will keep looking for one that does provide the "wow" for my family.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This recipe was "ok". We did not care for the super-sweet topping at all. It was almost like a dessert rather than a meatloaf. Even with the prepared mustard it was still too sweet and I only used 1/4 cup sugar. I normally just use a plain ketchup topping. Ketchup has quite a bit of sugar in it already so I reduced the br. sugar. Altho it was too sweet, it *will get eaten! :) Hubby, sweetheart that he is, will eat practically anything that I cook (other than peas and squash) and he always compliments how "good" it is....no matter what...(grin) but after all these yrs I know when he *really likes it...vs when he's just being nice. I do not think we'll be using this one again but thanks for the new experience! Oh, I had left out the ginger because I've never even bought ginger...but otherwise I followed directions as written except for using less sugar.

The first time I made this I added onion soup mix. It was good. ~~~~ This time around I added a half package of onion soup, and a half package of stove top stuffing mix instead of the crackers. Still yummy and I'll keep making this recipe every time I want meatloaf for dinner.

A great meatloaf recipe. I made the following modifications: only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar. added 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to the ketchup/brown sugar mix. used 1/2 cup of milk and 1 egg. add 2 cloves of garlic to the meat mixture. used a cup of seasoned bread crumbs instead of the crackers.

These were the best! I made these in a muffin pan to have easy quick individual servings. Cooking time was 20-25 mins. I also used fresh ginger and put the brown sugar/ketchup mix on top. Wonderful! My husband thought it was a cranberry topping. It was sweet but not a bbq taste at all. Great!

I just made this recipe for the first time tonight for dinner - we were sick of the same old meatloaf (which was dry).It was excellent!  I did make a few changes, though.  I used 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 ground chuck(3/4 pound) and 1/2 ground sirloin (3/4 pound), 1/2 cup milk, 1/2 packet of Lipton Onion Soup Mix (my family doesn't like onions), and substituted Ritz crackers for the saltines.  My family couldn't get enough of it.  I have a husband and two hungry boys (14 and 20) and they all loved it.  I've been making various meatloaves for over 25 years now and this one will definitely be my new favorite.  Thanks for sharing such a winner.

This was excellent.  The saltines gave it a nice flavor, I don't generally like the flavor of the breadcrumbs so it was a nice alternative.  Mixed the ketchup with the brown sugar, dijon mustard and some worshteshire and put it on top.  I wouldnt really add too much more to change.  Was really good.

I made this last night with fresh ground beef from the butcher . This was fantastic. I do do some subsitutions, 1 bunch of scallions instead of onion and I added 1/2 greeen pepper and 1 jalapeno.
Made to glaze with less br. sugar and put it on top. My husband and i thought it was the best I have made ( I have been cooking a loooong time )Don't forget to drain the grease at least 3 times . needed over on hour to cook

An excellant tasting meatloaf!  The only change I made to the recipe was, I only added 1/2 cup of milk, which I think was more than enough liquid.  Be sure invert meatloaf onto a large platter over the kitchen sink when ready to serve, as the sauce and excess grease does splatter somewhat.  Thank you tangastar for this wonderful tasting meatloaf recipe.  It was very good!!

I found this recipe while looking for something that would allow me to recreate an old family favorite from my childhood that my Aunt Jinnie used to make. I followed this ingredient list, but I (a lover of sauces and anything sweet) made the brown sugar and ketchup mix on the bottom of the pan, added the meatloaf (with one green bell pepper chopped up mixed in - like Aunt Jinnie did) and then covered it with the same amount of brown sugar and ketchup. I also measured out the cracker crumbs and added them to the milk (using a little less milk)to soak while I rounded up the rest of the ingredients. It seems as though this step with the crumbs makes the meatloaf a little more moist throughout and it's effortless. The ginger lends an amazing flavor to the meatloaf that is subtle but would be missed if you left it out. The peppers help to add great color, flavor and (for me) a needed texture in the meatloaf. I make this often and my visiting family members who frequently raid my refrigerator for leftovers grabbed what little was left. As soon as the tupperware was opened, they knew EXACTLY what I had made just by the sweet smell of the sauce. This really was a special find for me and my family. It's like Aunt Jinnie is here having dinner with my husband and I and our children (5,3 and 1) while I tell them stories about her over one of their very favorite meals. She would be proud. 

Also - to custom suit our very different family of 5, I make "mini meatloaves with whatever likes a

I thought the flavor of this recipe was outstanding! My entire family asked for it again, and we had it twice in one week! I did do one thing differently: sandwich bread instead of saltine crackers. The substitution didn't change the taste at all, which is the most important part of the recipe, but I think it lent to making the loaf moist. I also put the glaze on the top AND bottom of the loaf.

My family liked this meatloaf. I made a few changes. Because the hamburger meat I had on hand was ground with bacon I molded the meatloaf in a loaf pan then dumped it onto a cookie sheet so that it would not be as greasy. I also split the topping using 1/4 cup of each brown sugar and ketchup on the top and bottom. Because a few people said it was a little bland I  used a mixture of regular ketchup and jalepeno ketchup. Into the meatloaf itself I used fresh grated ginger instead of powdered, added a dash of wostershire sauce, swapped out the onions for onion powder (I was out of onions) and added a spoonful of minced garlic. I decreased the milk slightly, used town house cracker crumbs, and upped the meat to 2 lbs. The result was a yummy meatloaf, neither too dry or too soggy. It is a good recipe and I will make it again.

I love this recipe, it's so easy yet gives such tasty results! It is unlike any other meatloaf and I believe it's because of the ketchup/brown sugar layer at the bottom. Most meatloafs have just plain ketchup on top but this recipe kicks it up a notch by allowing it to sweeten and cook into the meat at the bottom. It's so good and a family favorite now! I wouldn't change a thing!

An excellent meatloaf.  It has become my meatloaf of choice.  I have made this several times.  I mix the brown sugar and ketchup together first and place on top of meat.  Line pan with foil and it makes it easy to lift out.

I've been looking for a good meatloaf recipe and this is it.  I used both crackers and italian bread crumbs.  Also added 2-3 T of dijon mustard to the sauce which I put on top instead of the bottom.  My husband asked what I put in it and then grabbed 2 helpings. He even said this is so good it doesn't need ketchup.  Will definitely making  again.  I served with green beans and twice baked potatoes.

This was an incredibly simple meatloaf to prepare.  I opted to swap the crushed saltines for oats instead -packed in more nutrients and couldn't tell the difference.  I left out the onion also, and added some essence, and worchestershire sauce, and garlic to the meatloaf.  I also added worchestershire sauce and essence to the glaze, which made it yummy.  I didn't put the glaze on the bottom, but on top, and all I can say is that I'm impressed, even my husband who hates meatloaf ate it.

Oh..my..goodness!  This is absolutely the best meatloaf I've ever tasted!  I made a few changes, however.  I changed the serving to yeild 4 instead of 8.  I used 1 pound of ground turkey, only 1/4 cup milk, 1 tsp of onion powder, 1 tsp garlic powder, (did away with the ginger), and 3/4 cup of Italian bread crumbs.  I mixed the brown sugar and ketchup together, mixed in 1 tbsp in my turkey mixture, spread half in a 5x9 rectangle on the bottom of a metal casserole pan and put my meat mixture over it, shaping it to fit.  Then I put the other half over the top.  It only took one hour for it to cook, mainly because of the lack of grease.  It was DIVINE!  I can honestly say it will be the only meatloaf recipe I use.  Every five-star rater is telling the truth!

Loved it! My husband doesn't like meatloaf, but he liked this "okay." :) Like others, I made changes to the meat portion: 1/4 cup milk, onion soup mix instead of an onion, bread crumbs instead of saltines, no ginger, 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce, and 2 cloves of garlic. For the sauce I used 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup ketchup, and 1 tablespoon Worcestershire. Because I couldn't spare the oven for more than an hour to cook this, I used a 12-tin muffin pan - greased, with a little sauce on the bottom - instead of a loaf pan. I cooked it at 350 for 30 minutes, then topped it with the rest of the sauce and cooked it for 15 minutes more. Made "meat muffins," as my sister said. Delicious!

I have made this meatloaf a few times and my family LOVES it.  They haven't liked all of my previous attempts - had to be the recipe, not ME :-)  I forgot the milk and it still turned out perfectly.  I mix the brown sugar and ketchup together & pour half on the bottom, half on the top.  Made excellent sandwiches the next day.

I was never a big fan of meatloaf (seems like it's just molded flavorful hamburger patties to me) but I thought with these reviews it might be different.  The ginger gave it a nice flavor that was different, but I didn't like how the sugar/ketchup glaze was on the bottom.  I couldn't find my loaf pan so I made it in a pie pan, which reduced the baking time and made it more like a meat pie.  THe edges were the tastiest b/c the brown sugar carmelized.  The rest of it was not as flavorful.  Not too bad, but wasn't enough to convince me that meatloaf is anything more than seasoned hamburger.

I have made my own version of meatloaf for 30 years, and today I tried this recipe. My husband declared it the best meatloaf he's ever had. I followed the recipe ingredients, only adjustments were to use instant onions, ½ hamburger and ½ ground turkey, and I had to use steak sauce to make up for my lack of ketchup (about ¼ cup); Like Latinacook I mixed the brown sugar and ketchup mixture and poured a little in the pan and the rest over the top of the meatloaf, then I was concerned about the amount of milk, so I only used ½ cup, and even though the mixture seemed a little too wet, the finished product was finely textured and so flavorful. 5 star keeper!

This was very tasty, not like my regular "mushloaf".  I added about 3x the ginger, two cloves of garlic, and 1/2 chopped green pepper. and maybe a few more crackers. No ketchup on top. I cooked it in a foil lined pan so that when it was done I drained the grease and flipped it over to have a yummy crust on top.  I bumped up my heat after one hour to 450 and cooked for an additonal 20 minutes to brown.  It was firm and moist, not mushy at all!!!:)

Great meatloaf! I made a few changes, which I always do on this site after reading the reviews of others. I put half the sauce on the bottom and the other half on the top as a glaze. I added a bit of Worcestershire to the glaze, as well to the meat. Reduced the amount of milk to 1/2 cup, used bread crumbs, added one minced garlic clove to the meat, and grated fresh ginger instead of using ground ginger. Will definately make again!

Ok after reading all the reviews, I was confused where I wanted to put the sauce.  I ended up putting it on the bottom and it turned out beautiful!!  I used an 80/20 fat meat, And i didn't find it too greasy, I also turned it over onto a serving plate.  I added worch. sauce, little garlic, and used bread crumbs instead of crackers.  I also only used 1/2cup of milk for fear it would be TOO moist, or mushy, and it turned out wonderful.  I had been using a meatloaf recipe similar to Boston market meatloaf,but I have found a new winner. THanks for the recipe

Good recipe, but after a bit of "tweaking" it came out GREAT!! I added worchestershire to sugar and ketchup. Plus I used fresh ginger (it makes a world of difference!) and garlic, then added about a 1/2 cup finely diced bell pepper. The amount of milk is a bit too much so I cut it down to about a 1/4 cup.  I shaped the meatloaf into little individual meatloafs (it cooks faster and looks a little prettier!) then put the sugar sauce over the top. Turned out great!!  I've made for company a couple of times now and always get rave reviews!!

This just lacked flavor except for sweet.  I used this recipe as a base the next time and made several changes.  I omitted the milk and added a can of Rotel tomatoes instead, which added plenty of liquid.  I also omitted the ginger and added garlic powder.  As for the brown sugar and ketchup, instead, I just used 2 tablespoons of brown sugar mixed with a small can of tomato sauce and spread it on top of the meatloaf.

By mistake I added the brown sugar and ketchup with everything so I didn't have the bottom  sweet layer as instructed but I think it made it perfect. I think the glaze may have been too sweet on its own along the bottom, My opinion it was better mixed in with all the other ingredients to even out the likely overpowering sweetness of the brown sugar. Will keep as meatloaf recipe for us.

This will become my new standard meatloaf recipe - very yummy!  I will use less milk next time, though, because my family prefers more "stiff" meatloaf.  Other than that, the flavor was excellent!

This recipe was good.  A nice change from regular meat loaf.  I however did find the ginger flavor a little over powering and would decrease it next time.  Also, I added 1/2 the sugar to the meat mixture and 1/2 to the sauce.  Final change was I used 1 lb. beef and 1/2 lb ground pork.

I really enjoyed this meatloaf, it was moist and flavorful.  I cut down on the amount of brown sugar after reading the reviews, and still found it to be on the sweet side.  The onions were not fully cooked, and were a bit crunchy, so it may be a good idea to precook them before putting them in to the mix.  Also, all the juices mixed with the ketchup and brown sugar at the bottom, which was quite messy.  I think it would be better to put the ketchup/sugar on top of the meatloaf for a nice glaze.  Overall, though, this is an excellent recipe.

This was an absolute failure. My family loves meatloaf and I've tried several recipes, but this one was soggy and too sweet.  No one would eat more than one bite.  Sorry.

Absolutely perfect.  My husband who doesn't care for meatloaf, was absolutely impressed by this recipe.  He had thirds!  I will make this my permanent recipe for meatloaf.  It was delicious because the sugar and ketchup blend very well with the beef's natural juices and this made a wonderful gravy-like texture that was easily poured over the meatloaf slices.

This was a really good meatloaf.  I took the suggestions and used a 1/2 c. milk, used dark brown and halved the sugar, and added a few spashes of worcestshire sauce to both the beef and the ketchup.  We were out of crackers and bread crumbs so I used oats.  Still put the sugar and ketchup on the bottom and inverted it on a platter.  Everything was great!  Wife loved it.

Hate to say it...but, this is the worst rating I've given on this site so far.  The recipe was WAYYYYY too sweet and we love sweet stuff.  There was also too much sauce and it is hard to pair up a sweet meat with other side dishes.  After trying this recipe, I don't think it is a good idea to make meatloaf sweet at all...so, I wouldn't even waste your time by cutting the brown sugar in half.

This meatloaf was very moist.  I misread the recipe and only used one pound of lean ground beef, and the same amount of the remaining ingredients.  It was soo moist though! I loved the ginger taste, very different for meatloaf.  I also would suggest to mix ALL of the ingredients together in with the meat so that the flavor is throughout the meatloaf instead of real sweet at the bottom where the brown sugar and ketchup were.

I liked this recipe, although I thought it was too sweet. Next time I will use less brown sugar. I also used seasoned bread crumbs instead of saltines (what I had on hand), worked great. My 1 year old and 3 year old devoured it (which is a feat at our house!).

This recipe was a waste.....it was way too sweet.  I even added 1/2 of the sugar that was called for.  If you like sweet it may be a winner, but I will stick with my tried and true meatloaf before I would ever make this one again!

This took a lot longer to cook then the recipe called for, about an hour and half, so keep that in mind while you're preparing your side dishes.  
The flavor was awesome though, my husband rated it a 10. :)

What a wonderful meatloaf. I did make plenty of changes but the ketchup and brown sugar glaze was AMAZING. I used half sausage meat / half mince, added a grated carrot, grated clove of garlic, fresh grated ginger, splash of tabasco, 1/2 teaspoon of thyme and used breadcrumbs instead of cracker. Made great sandwiches the next day!

This was a very good meatloaf!  I haven't made one in years and even my picky 9 year old at it.  I did omit the onions, because of the 9 year old, but did add a tablespoon of onion powder for the flavor.  Thanks for the recipe, will be making this one again!

This is a very good recipe and we enjoyed it immensely.  However, I did vary it a little bit.  I used melba toast instead of saltines, pinch of celery salt, and a dash of worcestershire sauce.  I also divided the brown sugar/ketchup glaze so I had half on the bottom and the other half on top.  I waited until it was almost done, drained off the liquid and then added the glaze to the top.  I didn't want the sugar to burn.  It tasted great, was moist, and it didn't fall apart.

Excellent Meatloaf! It stays together & not fall apart even when just out of oven! Brown Sugar gives it a wonderful flavor! Hubby says it's the BEST he's ever eaten & could eat it several nights a week! Coming from him,who happens to be a very good cook himself, that's great! Thanks for sharing it!! Ginger B.

We really enjoyed this meatloaf. We served it with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans. I added extra ginger; however, I couldn't taste it. The next time I make it I will put a layer of cheese in the middle.  It made wonderful meatloaf sandwiches the next day.

This was an excellent meatloaf!  I did half the brown sugar & put it on top mixed w/ ketchup as suggested by others and that worked out great.  Will definitely be making again.

WOW!!!! This is amazing meatloaf! I followed the recipe almost exactly, only changing out the onion for onion flakes.  It's delicious!  We're going to make this all the time.  Next time I will try to put the brown sugar and ketchup on top, but the taste couldn't be better!  Thanks!

Delicious and very simple to make. I used wheat crackers instead of saltines.  My family argued over who got the last piece.  Next time I'll cut the brown sugar in half.

My husband loved this recipe!  I didn't have ketchup on hand once and used some Yoshida's original marinade and it was really good!  The two mixed to make a delicious sauce.  We have tried it with BBQ sauce and teriaki sauce too and loved them all.

Very good recipe as is. I read the other reviews, but I wanted to try both ways so I made 2. I found cooking the meat on top of the brown sugar and ketchup made its own glaze that is not as sweet as putting it on top. The juices from the meat made it a delicious sauce/gravy more so than a sticky glaze. Cooking the meat on top of the ketchup and sugar added a lot more flavor into the meatloaf too, it wasn't as dry. The other meatloaf was very good too, just sweeter. I like more savoury things personally, so it depends on your taste preference.

Good recipe. I only had 1 egg left, little milk and forgot the ginger and still Turned out great. I added the topping to the top and next time I will minimize the brown sugar as it was a little too sweet.

Best meatloaf I ever made. I used to top it with just ketchup or tomato sauce. Adding the brown sugar on top made all the difference in the world.

It was a great meatloaf - very moist when baked to exactly 160 degrees internal temperature.
Made a couple changes such as putting the brown sugar and ketchup mixture on top, reducing the milk to 2/3 cup, adding a dash of worcester sauce, and increasing the saltine crumbs (as it was very wet). Next time I'll also decrease the sugar by a lot. It was way too sweet for our liking and didn't feel comfortable letting our daughter eat any of the topping.

This was really good. I made it exactly like the recipe said. The only change I'd make next time would be to use half a small onion instead of a whole onion and chop it into a very small dice. It was a little too oniony with a whole onion. Also, the topping came out perfectly when I turned the meatloaf out of the pan.

For everyone stuck as to why the ketchup and brown sugar are on the bottom, it's for this reason: it was designed to be inverted like an upside down cake. :-) It's a vital step that has been left out. We make this all the time at our house, and we let it cool for two minutes, then invert it onto a serving platter or baking sheet. Wha-la!

Good recipe. Very easy to make. I put the sauce on top. I'm not understanding the sauce on the bottom. Seeing the bread trick on the bottom to soak up some of the grease on these reviews, I tried that. It worked out well. Just make sure you don't serve part of the bread when slicing up the meatloaf. Per reviews, I only used 1/2 C of milk and 1 egg, especially, since I used only 1 lb of ground chuck instead of the 1 1/2 lb. That was perfect for the 1 lb of meat. The next time I make this recipe I may try waiting to put the sauce on till closer to the end of cooking time because some of the grease rose to the top of my sauce so when I spooned that grease off I lost part of my sauce. I will probably make it again. (I have other meatloaf recipes that I like just as well.)

Wonderful meatloaf.  Excellent hot as well as cold for a sandwich.
I wouldn't change a bit of this recipe.  It was just right the way it was written.  The only thing I would say is next time I might try
putting the brown sugar and ketchup on the top of the meatloaf, not
that I think it would really matter.

Loved this and it was so easy. Even my picky kids ate it and asked for seconds. Next time I might add some honey and shredded carrots.

I made the recipe exactly as it called for.  It was way too sweet for my tastes, but my husband loved it.  If I made it again, I would not put as much brown sugar as was called for and maybe add some lemon juice or something to cut the sweetness.

It was really easy, I'm not a brown sugar fan but it was delicious. I'll just use less brown sugar next time. But over all I'll deff make this dish more octet :)

I use fine bread crumbs instead of crackers and add a heaping tablespoon of flour and no milk. I don't put the brown sugar-ketchup mixture on the bottom. I cook it for a couple of minutes in the microwave and add it to the meatloaf for the last 10 minutes of cooking.  This way I have extra for my son-in-law to add to his when I serve it. I rate this high for flavor but not for the way the topping is included.

Great tasting meatloaf! I read a ton of reviews and took most all the advice. I kept the milk about the same, upped the bread crumbs to 1 cup, added several cloves of minced garlic, 1/2 c chopped onions and a whole packet of onion soup mix as well. I laid bacon strips across the top of the loaf, baked for about 20 mins, then slathered the sauce on top. I thought the sauce as is was a bit flat, so I added some Worcestershire sauce, 2 tbs yellow mustard, cayenne pepper, chilli powder, and some paprika - I like it to have some kick and a more full bodied barbeque like taste. It turned out fantastic, and I saved some sauce to eat with the meatloaf. Next time I will probably double the sauce, as I only put about 1/2 the sauce on top of the meatloaf to cook and I like lots of sauce :) Will definitely make again!

After reading the reviews, I followed  the recipe with some minor changes. I used turkey instead of beef and when it was done, I poured off the juice first and then inverted the meatloaf onto the serving dish, then poured the juice over the meatloaf. It was my first time ever making meatloaf and it's almost gone! So very good, thank you!

Hubby loves when I make this. Awesome as is, but I also add a bit of garlic to the meat and a splash of worcestershire sauce to the ketchup mixture and pour over top.

There is nothing worse than meatloaf cooking in grease.  I place a metal rack in any casserole dish or pan I use for meatloaf.  Spray bottom of pan.  Cover the rack with a sheet of aluminum foil and puncture several places with tip of knife.  Place meatloaf on top of foil....add about 1/2 inch of water in bottom of pan.  All grease will drain from meatloaf thru foil to bottom of pan.  Easy transfer of meatloaf to serving platter n super easy cleanup.

I make this kind of meatloaf for my family all the time.  Except I do put the brown sugar on top as a glaze. I mix it with the ketchup and a little musturd to give it a whang taste.  I learned this from my mom once you eat it like this you want to use it all the time gives it kinda sweet taste and not dry

I HATE meatloaf, but my son has been wanting to make some.  He & my husband are big meat eaters.  My son made this recipe himself & made a few minor changes after reading some of the reviews.  I was only going to try one bite, BUT, ended up eating a whole slice AND another slice the next night!  It was SOOOO good.  He added 1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce to the meat mix.  He also added about 2 Tbsp yellow mustard to the ketchup/brown sugar mix and put the whole glaze on TOP of the loaf.  I like the idea of putting 2 slices of bread on the bottom of the loaf pan to soak up the grease.  Will do next time.  Also will add garlic next time.  Recipe as is:  VERY good, but add some mustard to the glaze.  Oh, and he used 85% lean ground beef.

This meatloaf rocks! I split the brown sugar ketchup mixture and placed 1/2 under and 1/2 on top of the meatloaf.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  Only changes I made were to reduce ginger to 1/8 teaspoon and double ground pepper to 1/2 teaspoon.  I was actually surprised my husband liked it because he typically doesn't care for anything sweet (especially his meat!), but he raved on and on about it.  Definitely a keeper recipe!  Thanks for posting!

After 47 years of marriage, I found out my husband doesn't like meatloaf, thanks to this recipe! That's actually a compliment because he said, "I don't really care for meatloaf, but this is great!" It made more sense to me to put the ketchup mixture on the top but that's the only change I made. Thank you.

I did the tweek thing like other reviewers and cut down on the milk and sugar and put the sauce on top. I sauteed my onions and garlic and celery before adding. Then I sliced up some potatoes and carrots and put them around the loaf and they come out incredible with all the meatloaf flavors!!! And I used bread crumbs!

I gave this recipe 5 stars -  it was fabulous!  Before trying this recipe, I had made meatloaf for my family for more than 25 years, without any complaints (and with many compliments).  But, I wanted something a bit different and this was great!  TRUST the recipe - I was a bit put off by using ginger and milk in my meatloaf, but believe me when I say, this is great. 

The only change I make on a regular basis is the serving size, since it's for just my husband and I.  I use 1/2 of everything except for the brown sugar and ketchup - using the regular amount of those keeps a wonderful sauce for the top of the meatloaf.

After reading the reviews I went with the following substitutions: onion soup mix, half brown sugar/ketchup on the bottom of the pan and half as a glaze, and seasoned bread crumbs and loved it...Thanks for your input, fellow reviewers!

Good basic meatloaf.  To zing it up I always use garlic and quite a lot of black pepper.  But the brown sugar and ketchup should be on the top of the meatloaf.  I usually bake the meatloaf and when there is about 15 min. left, I mix the brown sugar and ketchup (and I add 1 Tbsp. mustard) together and spread it all over the meatloaf.  Continue baking till done.

I read some of the other reviews. I tweaked  it a little by adding to the ingredients. I used onion soup mix, Worcester sauce, garlic and instead of putting the brown sugar and ketchup at the bottom of the pan I mixed it into the meat. It turned out fabulous. Thanks for sharing.

Not sure how to rate this, because if you made it "as is", you would have a disaster on your hands.  It is not edible without draining the fat, and I cannot imagine why you would put the sauce on the bottom.  Made as it is written, you have a hunk of meat sitting in a soup of fat and brown sugar/ketchup sauce....Yuck!

My .02 cents would be to cook JUST THE MEAT MIXTURE for 45 min and drain as much fat as possible.  THEN, add the sauce ON TOP - mixed with 1 tsp. of nutmeg (my secret), and cook for an additional 30 min.  

Also, I place half a slice of bread at each end of the meatloaf after I drain the fat.  This helps to absorb additional fat while cooking for the last 30 min (discard these slices after cooling).

Is it just me? Doesn't anybody else add hardboiled eggs to the center of the meatloaf before cooking? Each slice has a slice of hard boiled egg in it.

I found this recipe on Allrecipes.com about 10 years ago.  It's been a staple in our family, ever since then.  My husband is not a big fan of meatloaf, but absolutely loves this one!  :)  The only alteration I have made over the years is that I buy plain bread crumbs (pre-packaged)...just as a time-saver..but, tastes just as good. :)  Fantastic recipe..so glad I found it on Allrecipes, all those years ago. :)

Delicious!  I also used 1/2 cup milk as suggested by others and it was plenty.  I also added a pinch of garlic powder.  This recipe is my new favorite meatloaf.  Oh and I also baked in a larger dish and added the brown sugar and ketchup to the top instead of baking on the bottom.

Not sure what I did wrong but this came out a runny, oily mess.  I tried putting the ketchup/brown sugar mix on the top like some of the other reviewers mentioned but it did not come out well at all.  The overall mixture was very runny.  Maybe I should have cut down on the amount of milk.

The meatloaf was very tasty, however, I would recommend extending the cooking time by an additional 30 minutes.

This is absolutely the best meatloaf I've ever had. My entire family loved it and my husband (who is very very picky) said it was better than his meatloaf. I made some minor modifications but the recipe would have been great as is.  I used breadcrumbs instead of crackers and I baked it for 40 mins at 350 then finished it off at 400 degrees.  10 mins prior to it being completed, I put extra ketchup/brown sugar mix on top.  Delish!

This was a huge hit in the house including my 4 year old son who ate as much as the adults and he usually eats barely anything. I made it the way the recipe indicates (sugar and ketchup on the bottom) and it came out fine.

What an excellent recipe. With the 1.5 pounds of ground beef, I reduced the # of eggs to 1 and the milk to 1/4 cup. I added 1 tbsp of Worstechire to the beef and the brown sugar/ketchup and I coated the meat instead of layering the meat on top.
Also, I sit the meat on a rack in a cookie sheet so the heat circulates the whole loaf and it's not sitting in the fat. I would only use a loaf pan if I were using 93% lean beef or turkey chop meat which also, I would increase the milk to 1/2 cup and use 2 eggs. I think the amount of flavor in the brown sugar/ketchup/worstechire marinade would make up for the lack of flavor in leaner meat.
I thank the creator of this recipe for sharing.

I put bread underneath to soak up grease and put the brown sugar and ketchup on the top per the reviews. Also, from the tips section, I added one shredded carrot to sneak-in some vitamins.

I loved this recipe. It's a little different than the meatloaf recipe I usually use, so I liked changing things up a little. I followed the recipe exactly as written and it makes a very sweet tasting meatloaf. I wasn't sure about the ginger at first, but you won't even know it's there once the meatloaf is cooked.

I read in the reviews that some people thought the brown sugar and ketchup mixture should be placed on top of the loaf, and not under it. I will say that yes, the mixture is pretty runny when the meatloaf first comes out of the oven, but if you remove the loaf and put it on a serving platter and let the sauce sit for a while, it thickens and makes a very nice sauce to pour over the top of the meatloaf slices.

I made this meatloaf tonight.  I did take the suggestion of another reviewer and put the ketchup/brown sugar glaze on top as opposed to the bottom.  Next time I make this, I will reduce the amount of brown sugar.  It was too sweet as another reviewer suggested.  I will try this again and report back.

This was soooo good!!  Only changes I made were to put 1 tbsp  dijon mustard, a dash of worcestershire and balsamic vinegar in the glaze.  (Didn't put the stuff on the bottom, but on the top)  Also used bread crumbs instead of saltines.  Threw in 1/2 cup of greek yogurt to the meat mixture and it was soooo moist!!!  A WINNER!!

Very good! I love the flavors. I did not do the brown sugar and ketchup crust. I did what the others said, and mixed the brown sugar and ketchup to make a glaze. Bake it, but for the last 15-20 minutes add the glaze. If you put the glaze on the whole time, it gets a bit rubbery/chewy. I made it for my family, and it even beat momma's recipe! =)

This was FABULOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Even those who turned their head and said, "I don't eat meatloaf CLEARED THEIR PLATES!!!!!!!  Those of us who were meatloaf lovers were just amazed!!!!!  I'd give it 100 stars if I could!!!! Thanks so much for sharing :) __________________________________________ ETA: I made this the second time tonight. I doubled the recipe and used a larger loaf pan.  The additional cooking time for my oven and pan was 20 mins!  Came out perfect and delicious again :D  This recipe stirred up quite a frenzy at my house :)

INCREDIBLE!! My husband loved this so much, we had it again a few days after finishing leftovers!  It smells divine while cooking, and I really like the texture - much more homogeneous & less crumbly than your average meatloaf.  Wrapped four mini-loafs (not circular) in two pieces bacon around the sides; used full tsp fresh ginger; placed sliced bread under loaves during cooking (so the loaf doesn't fry in the bottom of pan in fat); used 3 slices of bread, chopped fine, instead of saltines; added 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce to topping & poured on loaves as directed.  Simple, fast, beautiful!  Thanks so much, definitely a keeper!!

Meatloaf isn't eaxctly my favorite food, but my husband loves it and it's a easy meal.

Outstanding recipe. I did make changes the second time I made this. I omitted the salt as the saltine cracker crumbs had plenty of salt. I added 1/4 cup Old Fashioned Oats ( uncooked ) and only 1/2 cup saltines. I added 2 TBSP of finely chopped green pepper and reduced the milk to  1/2. I put the ketchup and brown sugar on top along with some thinly sliced onion. The most heavenly aroma filled the house while this was baking. Thank you tangastar for sharing this recipe.

This was amazing - everyone was looking for more!  I  made some adjustments too.  Actually H2OSMILES review was terrific.  The only thing is I used half seasoned bread crumbs and half potato bread cubed w/o crusts.  I sauteed garlic and onion in EVOO and then added it to meat mix.  I mixed brown sugar, ketchup and worchester sauce together and put in bottom of muffin pan, meat mix, ketchup mix on top and topped that with those crispy onions.  I also used 92% lean ground beef so there wasn't much grease. Put muffin pan on top of tray and baked for 1/2 hr.  OMG, so so good!

My husband loves this recipe and requests it if it's been a while since I made it.  He even made it for me once as a surprise!  I form the meat into a loaf, and set it on a couple of pieces of bread in a glass baking dish that I've lined with foil.  The loaf keeps it's shape.  I spoon the liquid once in a while back onto the meatloaf while cooking as suggested.  Perfection, and easy to clean up!

I'm not a fan of meatloaf but my fiance loves meatloaf as long as it stays together but isn't dry. I used several variations of what others uses such as 1/2 C of milk, 1 C seasoned breadcrumbs, packet of onion soup mix and worchestershire sauce in the brown sugar mix.  It was amazing!!  Thank you for the recipe!!

This is the first meatloaf that I've cooked, well the second the first shall never be spoken of.  This was such a great dish I'm really happy with the way it turned out.  The only thing I changed is the onions, I've never liked onions in meatloaf much so I substituted onion soup mix.  The only think I have to figure out next time is a gravy.  Gravy makes everything better.

Great meatloaf. I've make it several times. Even the kids eat it up. The only thing I do differently is that I mix the brown sugar and ketchup together and put it on the top, rather than on the bottom. I've done it both ways and I prefer it on the top. I also add a little extra ginger, being careful not to use too much since a little goes a long way. Another 1/8 t is plenty. Make sure to use ground beef that is low in fat. I use 90% lean. This eliminates the need to drain off the excess fat. I also make extra topping to put on the table. The hubby likes to dip his in extra sauce. Great recipe. Thanks for sharing.

Excellent meatloaf! I've made it several times now, with a few changes. I use a lb of ground chuck and a lb of ground pork. I saute the chopped onion and some chopped celery along with 2 tbs of minced garlic from a jar in a little olive oil as I like the veggies softer in meatloaf, instead of crunchy. Instead of saltine crackers, I use a mix of crushed onion crackers and toasted bread crumbs. I add a dash of ground mustard, a tbs of dried parsley flakes, a pinch of tarragon,  use seasoned salt vs regular and add an envelope of Golden Onion soup mix. I also put the brown sugar mixture on top, but I use 1/4 c Ketchup, 1/4 c Chili Sauce, a squirt of honey and a tbs of Worcestershire. Putting the sauce on the bottom makes it too greasy, in my opinion.  I then bake it at 350 for 1 1/2 hours and let it rest for about 10 min before slicing to allow the juices to permeate the loaf. Guess I changed it a lot, lol! But I think most cooks do to suit their tastes and those of their family.

This recipe was delicious! I added the ketchup/brown sugar sauce on top as opposed to on the bottom and it came out fantastic!

I thought this was very ordinary tasting.  Maybe I was expecting more since it's 4.5 stars.  I followed the exact recipe.  Why do people rate something 4 or 5 stars when they didn't follow the recipe?

Thank you so much for this recipe! I took the advice of others and put some bread on the bottom of the pan to soak up the grease (worked perfectly!) and I put the ketchup/brown sugar on top.  I also used a beef/pork/veal mixture that I found at the grocery store already mixed, added some garlic powder to the meat and the topping along with some worcestire sauce in the meat and topping as well.  My boyfriend took one bite and said "WOW!!" - one of the best responses I've gotten for all of the meals I've made for him.  This is definitely a keeper, I can't wait to make it again.

This was fantastic. I made it with ground venison. I marinated the venison in milk overnight to remove the game taste. I agree with other reviews that the ketchup and brown sugar should go on top of the loaf instead of in the bottom of the pan. I used my food processor to make the onions finely chopped. I added 4 minced garlic cloves.This turned out fantastically well. I would add a bit of Worcestershire sauce too.

Made this the other night and it was soooooo good. I had read some of the reviews and altered the recipe alittle: used 1/2 c milk instead, poked holes in the uncooked meatload and poured the sauce on top instead of the bottom,also placed 2 slices of bread on the bottom of the loaf pan to soak up the grease. This is a keeper.

I was skeptical after reading all the reviews, but I made it like it was written and it was great! Sauce on bottom and all! You get a nice crispy top, but it's still moist and you get good flavour from the bottom. Not your typical with the glaze but very delicious! Thank you for sharing

Like other reviewers, I put the brown sugar and ketchup on the top.  I made this in muffin tins with 96/4 beef, low fat milk and only 1 egg.  I like my meatloaf crispy on top so I baked the muffin tins at 350 for 1 hour.  GREAT fun and tasty!

WOW  I really dont like meatloaf, but this was fantastic.  Family loved it, even our 3yr old who doesn't like anything "hamburger". Would even serve this to company - really that good!  I did add a few things to the meatloaf according to our tastes (including some of the glaze - which is a must) I did lighten up on the brown sugar a little and probably would again next time I make it (used 1/2 cup not packed brwn sugar - again would go alittle lighter next time).  used bread crumbs in place of crackers, added garlic, omitted ginger.

Waaaay to much brown sugar in the glaze, but the meatloaf itself was perfect. I use ground turkey for my meatloaf so I used the amount of eggs and milk called for in the recipe because turkey meat tends to dry out. Forgot to take other reviewer's suggestions to cut back on the sugar and add Worcester sauce to the glaze, which I think it would have benefited from.  I also substituted 1/2 tsp. onion powder for the onion since hubby and I don't like onions in our food. Ended up pouring the glaze over the top of the meatloaf to keep it moist per other's suggestions. Next time I make it, I'll make the changes to the glaze and see how it comes out.

This was very good... we really enjoyed this recipe!  I changed it slightly.  I didn't have eggs, so I omitted.  We didn't notice that it really needed them.  I used crushed croutons instead of saltines.  I also added 2 small cloves of garlic, as another reviewer mentioned.  I also put the glaze on top and covered with foil partway, and then removed the last 1/2 hour.  I found it needed to be cooked longer than it said.  I baked at 400 for about 1 hr and 10 minutes (and I only used just over 1 lb of beef).

I did not make changes to this recipe. I noticed all the 4-5 star ratings came from those who did make changes. This meatloaf is bland, and putting the sauce on the bottom causes it to be dry. I think the meat:crackers:milk ratio is way off. I had to cook it for 1 -1/2 hours before all the pink was gone. And, with just a hint of ginger, this meatloaf had no flavor. Because of the ingredients I had on hand is why I made this recipe tonight and not my favorite. The Mini Meatloaves by Tonya Swope is my family's absolute favorite!!

I have made a meatloaf similar to this for years. I always put the ketchup and brown sugar mixture on top of my meatloaf. Makes more sense to do it that way to me. Very tasty!

This is the best meatloaf ever!!! I have been using this recipe for along time. My husband won't eat any other meatloaf. What I do that is different is I put the brown sugar,ketchup, some onions and lots of garlic on the bottom along with 3-4 stripes of bacon. Then put foil over it until half way done. Then take the foil off and then mix a small amount of the brown sugar, garlic, onion and ketchup in a bowl and then spread on the top and finish baking. The bacon really topped this recipe off.

This recipe was a big hit! I tweaked slightly however. Reading other reviewers comments, I reduced the amount of brown sugar to 1/4 cup, and mixed it together with the ketchup, also adding a tbs. of minced garlic to make a glaze that topped my meatloaf before sticking in the oven. I also didnt have saltines, but Ritz crackers seemed to work very well. Came out awesome!

I love this recipe as does my fiance. I used 1 egg, 1/2 c milk, 1/4 c of bread crumbs, seasoned to taste, and a tbs of minced garlic. For the mixture (added garlic powder to it) I added it to the top! ( I am not a meatloaf person because people add tomato paste and or ketchup and I dont enjoy that. But this glaze is yummy)

Very nice meatloaf.  The family enjoyed the sweetness with savory.  I will definately be making again.   I added garlic as suggested and put on a rack (from turkey pan) and let the grease drip out.  I would normally use gr sirloin or round, but I had chuck (its what was on sale) I put sauce on top and did not mix in.  Thank you! 
Thank you for submitting this recipe

This is now one of our regular meals. I have tried the brown sugar mixture both on top and bottom of the meatloaf and we love it both ways. I make it with venison if I have it in the freezer.

I have tried just about every meatloaf recipe out there; and have never found one everyone in my family likes; until now. This meatloaf may not be fancy, but everyone from my husband to our youngest daughter just loves it. It's flavorful, moist, easy to put together, and inexpensive to make. Thanks for the great recipe :)

Loved it!  The only thing I will do different next time is use very lean meat or cook it so that it can drip some of the fat out.  I used lean beef, but still ended up fatty at the bottom.  There is enough fluid with the milk( I used soy milk ) and the glaze that you should use the leanest meat you can to avoid excess fat.

We thought this was really good meatloaf! I know people get mad when someone rates a recipe that they tweaked, but I am anyway since that is what cooking is all about! The only things I did differently was a little less sugar (1/3 c) and I did not have crackers so I used about 1/2 c of McCormick Crusting Blends (Italian Herbs & Cheese) and about 1/4 c lemon pepper panko crumbs. We really did enjoy this and the glaze is fantastic!

This was the first time I ever made meatloaf and I think it came out great! My only issues were that there seemed to be a lot of grease even though I put two pieces of bread underneath to help soak up some of the grease. It was also a tad dry but it could have been because I overcooked it? Either way, great recipe!

Very delicious!  I used Buffalo ground meat and a more fancy cracker (JJ Flats Everything Flat Bread) instead and a casserole dish which made it cook faster (40 min. instead of 60).  I added the brown sugar and ketchup on top instead of the bottom.  I also broiled it for 5 min to set the glaze.  For reheating, I simply sprinkled brown sugar and squeeze enough ketchup to cover, reheated it and broiled it again.  Thank you for this very delicious simple recipe!

Wow. Seriously awesome. Used bread crumbs instead of crackers, added a splash of Worcestershire sauce to both the sauce and the meat mixture, and added a tinge of chili powder. Also used garlic in the meat. Outstanding!

Agreed with the other reviewers - glaze should go on top instead of bottom, and added a bit of worchestire sauce to the mix.  Also put the bread at the bottom to soak up the grease, and it turned out great!

I would give it 5 stars but following the recipe to a T is only 4 stars.  After reading other reviews, I made the following changes: cut back on the brown sugar/ ketchup mixture (too sweet for a sweet tooth!) and make sure you put it on top of the meatloaf before baking.  Also, I substituted milk......using evaporated milk instead.  Bread crumbs work great (who really wants to take the time to crush saltines anyway?).....and lastly, maybe my onion was on the bigger side of small?  It seemed like a lot of onion, so make sure it is really small or just use 1/1 an onion.  I will definitely make this again!  An excellent meatloaf with a little modification!!

This was great. I didn't have the crackers, so I substituted quick oats and also put about 1/4 cup bread crumbs in there also. In addition, I added a can of green chiles, garlic powder, and salt and pepper as desired. I put the ketchup and brown sugar on top of the loaf and placed bacon on top of that and sprinkled brown sugar again. Cooked it covered for about 45 minutes and removed the foil for the last 30-40 minutes (mine took longer than an hour to cook). It was remarkable. Thank you for a nice base to build upon.

Amazing how ratings can be different - my girlfriend gave it a "7*", I was a little less enthusiastic with a "4*" - I just didn't find the taste/texture really any different from other meatloafs I've tried.  Changes I made based on others' input:  1/4 c brown sugar, added 1 Tbsp Worstershire to ketchup/brown sugar mix. 1/2 C milk & 1 egg. Added 4 cloves of garlic to meat mixture. Chopped some celery into it. Added bread crumbs instead of crackers. Made mini-loves in muffin pan. Put sauce  >on top

Not a fan. All I tasted was salt from the crackers and the meat wasn't very moist. I've had much better meatloaf!

Very moist and the texture was perfect. I had to cook a little longer by about 20 minutes. It was a little too sweet for my family so next time I will use less brown sugar. I did follow another reviewers suggestion and added worchestire sauce to the ketchup and used half brown sugar and ketchup mixture on bottom and spread other half across the top of the meatloaf. Next time I will add on top only. I also used butter crackers rather than the saltines. Oh yeah, had to add fresh garlic because we love it! Great recipe. Family liked it. I will make again. Thanks so much for sharing.

very tasty meatloaf... However, I made a few changes... I used a sweet onion, replaced the ginger with garlic, used 3/4 cup of breadcrumbs instead of crushed saltine crackers and put the ketchup and brown sugar glaze on the top. Next time I will probably use a little less milk as well...

Thank You!  My method of eyeballing the ingredients for my meatloaf was not working anymore.  Somewhere I got off track and this recipe makes a GREAT meatloaf!  I followed everything except I used bread crumbs instead of saltines.  Thanks again!

Agree the ketchup glaze goes on top! I put the meatloaf in a perforated wok and cooked it in my smoker with hickory for smoke. Applied the ketchup glaze about 30 minuts before it was done. Grease drains as it cooks and the glaze really takes the smoke flavor. Very nice!!! If you have never had smoked meatloaf yer missing out big time!

LOVE this meatloaf.  The change I make is simple.  I mix the ketchup and sugar in separate bowl and spread to the top of the loaf instead of spreading on bottom of pan.  Made this twice now and husband also LOVES it!

I made this meatloaf twice, first as written then I changed what I needed to. I never measure milk and breakcrumbs so i eyeballed that and the meatloaf its self was ok, I put the sauce on top but just found that my family would still need to put a load of ketchup on it so the next day I made it again and doubled the glaze mixing half in to the load and the rest on top, MUCH better!

Very tasty.  I only rated this a 4 because my meatloaf turned out a bit soggy in the middle.  I think I will put a tad less milk in the next time I make it.  The flavor you can't beat!  Great recipe!

next time I will use less brown sugar, and ginger. I love brown sugar in my meatloaf, but this lends more sweet, not sure if that is from the ginger or the lack of onion....

I thought this was good but not great. I doubled the recipe for 2 loaves but ended up only needing half the glaze. No way I could or would want to put on that much glaze. I did decrease the sugar in the glaze and thought it was still too sweet(FYI I am a huge sugar fan). Tastes like saltine crackers. I decreased the milk slightly and it was nice and moist. I would make again but the kids like my other recipe better.

Made this following the exact recipe. It was great. I used 85% lean beef and used a disposable aluminum loaf pan that I poked a few holes in the bottom. I then placed the loaf pan inside a glass casserole dish so it would catch the excess oil. Great dish!

I loved this recipe, I hadn't made meatloaf in a long time, but I think I'll make it more often with this recipe. The only change I made was to use bread crumbs instead of saltine crackers, which I don't usually purchase. I also made it in a mini-loaf pan. Yummy!

OH - MY - GOD! This was fantastic! The meatloaf part itself is pretty standard but the glaze was phenomenal. My husband and I loved it! I made some alterations - first, based on others' recommendations, I mixed the brown sugar and ketchup and then poured the glaze on top of the meatloaf. I also used a baking dish and formed the "loaf" in the middle of the dish (instead of using a loaf pan). This helped remove excess oil. Third, instead of saltine crackers, I used seasoned breadcrumbs. Finally, I also added some dashes of red pepper flakes to add some heat. I served it with garlic and chive mashed potatoes and a spinach tomato mozzarella salad. I'm so excited because there's plenty for leftovers. Delish!

This was good. I did opt to put the ketchup and brown sugar on top of the meat loaf however. It just seemed like the right thing to do lol.

my family absolutely LOVES this recipe... i did tweak it a little. Instead of onion I used shallots, i don't use the ginger and I add i small clove of garlic.  Combined with the fabulous brown sugar and ketchup sauce, which I put on top, not on the bottom... its definitely a favorite in my house.  Top it off with some potatoes, carrots and celery...even better! ^_^

This was very good.  I only altered the ketchup brown sugar topping.  I didn't put it on the bottom as was suggested by others, I put it on top.  I also added a tablespoon or so of balsamic vinegar to the topping mixture.

Great meatloaf, my boyfriend loves meatloaf but myself have never been much on them till now! I cut the sugar in half and that was plenty sweet for us. I also put the ketchup on top. ~UPDATE 10/23~ As great as this meatloaf was on it's own it. I made a couple changes I was out of saltines so I used club crackers. still used half the sugar I also used Johnsonville four cheese Italian sausage! Delish and the BF has already asked for it again!

Changes: We used crushed Cheez-its instead of saltines, added a tablespoon of Worschestire sauce, 1/4 cup of brown sugar, mixed ketchup and brown sugar and used as a glaze, cooked meatloaf in a casserole dish. It was delicious with these changes.  Definitely will be making it again.

I gathered all the ingredients, went to moms & whipped this together. By the time we finished eating, this was moms NEW meatloaf recipe. A great recipe as is, the only thing I did different was put my ketchup & brown sugar on top.

This was really delicious! I followed another user suggestions, and used a tablespoon worcestershire in the ketchup/brown sugar sauce (which I mixed together). I also used italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of the saltines. Used sea salt, and soy milk. And also just one egg. Also added garlic. I feel garlic is just essential in meatloaf. I also followed a users suggestion for putting the sauce on both the top and bottom, which I will NOT do again next time. It came out WAY too sweet that way! It was overwhelming. This is a good recipe, but with a few tweaks, it is great. I will only place the glaze on top next time.

This is an excellent meatloaf.  I agree that the ketchup/brown sugar/(Worcestershire) mix should go on top, because this doesn't cook that long, especially if you use too big of a loaf pan and the resulting meatloaf is rather thin, although still delicious.  I also added a little garlic, just crumbled up some stale bread, and only threw in a splash of milk to hold everything together.  End result, post-modifications, was lovely.

Holy cow, this was good!  The only thing I did differently was I used a combination of ground turkey and pork for the meat.  I flipped the meatloaf over onto a plate to serve.  It had the perfect crusty texture on one side and the yummy topping on the other.  We loved it!!

Easy tip for lowing the fat content of your meatloaf and not having to constantly drain your loaf pan:  Once all of your ingredients are stirred together in your mixing bowl, mash them down into the bowl to create a solid mass of meat.  Then turn the bowl over onto a broiler pan with a little water in the bottom layer of the pan.  The bowl shape creates a nicely shaped round loaf of meat that will not fall apart if you compacted it well.  Spread the brown sugar and catsup on top.  As it cooks, all the grease from the meat will drain into the bottom of the broiler pan and the top will come out delicious.  It is still moist, but not greasy.  And you can slice it like a pie for a nice presentation.

This is now my husband's favorite meatloaf!  I do reduce the sugar and add more hot sauce - a bit too sweet otherwise.  Marvelous!

O.K., with this many ratings no one will probably ever read this one.  But just have to say, this recipe was great!  We have an ongoing competition in our house to see who can make the best meatloaf.  My husband was having a hard time conceding last night even after I found him eating this for a 'midnight snack'.  Made the recipe exactly as is, no variations and it is awesome!!

Delicious!!! I'm not the biggest meatloaf fan, but my husband and I absolutely loved this :-). He ate leftovers for breakfast this morning, and took the rest with him to work for lunch. I took the advice of other reviewers and made a few modifications-     I had 1.15 lbs of meat- I added 1.25 cloves of garlic to meat mix. I used bread crumbs instead of crackers. Only half a cup of milk, and one egg. I added 4 shakes of worchestershire to the glaze mix, and only used 1/4 cup of br sugar. I didn't put glaze on the bottom, but baked for 30 minutes, added glaze on top, and baked for an additional 30 minutes.      Served with garlic mashed potatoes and gravy. Soooo yummy. Thanks for the easy recipe!

I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions like using half the brown sugar and using bread crumbs instead of crackers and putting the sauce on top instead of on the bottom. I also ground up some veggies in there and you couldn't even taste them. I'll be keeping that secret from the hubby though! A great meatloaf!

I didn't have a good time with this recipe.. I followed it exactly and it seemed very moist when I put it in the pan... It cooked quickly enough.. but the brown sugar and ketchup fused to my (pre-greased) pan, and the meatloaf stayed pretty mooshy. If I made this again, I'd use way less milk, and put the sugar/ketchup on top.

I don't even generally LIKE meatloaf. Just listen to the name of it 'meat-loaf'. Loaf of MEAT. Ugh. Nothing about that sounds appealing in the slightest.. I tried this recipe only because it had such great reviews and because my fiance is a meatloaf-enthusiast. Well-- let's just say that I am SO GLAD that I did! It was absolutely the best meatloaf I have ever had. I did like many other reviewers, and made 'mini-loaves' in a cupcake tin. Baked at 350 for about 25 minutes. I also put the brown sugar/ketchup mixture on TOP, rather than on bottom. These were moist, FULL of flavor and so so filling. My fiance brought the leftovers for work, and sent me a text message at noon expressing how glorious this meal was the second time around. Well done!

The recipe itself is so easy to follow that my five year old son did almost all of it following my instructions.  It has a good flavor...but it is the only meatloaf recipe I have ever had to drain.  If I used this recipe again, I would put the ketchup and brown sugar on top.

This is a moist, flavorful meatloaf like no other I've ever had. I've been making this meatloaf for almost a year now and it was the first one I ever tried to prepare at home. We never get tired of this and it ddoesn't last long between my guy and I alone!  PS- I have used Ritz crackers in place of the saltines several times for this recipe since I usually have those instead, and it's still awesome.

We all loved this.  I used onion soup mix instead of the chopped onion just for a change.  Used just a half a cup milk and subbed panko breadcrumbs for the saltines cause I love the way they taste.  Also, a great glaze for meatloaf is 3T ketchup, 1T honey, 1T worcestershire, and 1T brown sugar.  Yum!  I added this on top, not bottom.  On the bottom of my loaf pan I put a few pieces of sandwich bread to soak up the grease.  Worked great!

This is the best meatloaf recipe out there.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception that I put the ketchup mixture on top, and it comes out perfect every time.  I have passed this recipe on to so many friends I have lost count.  Everyone raves about it.

My hubby raved about this one,it is one of TWO fave meatloaf recipes we are keeping! I have never liked meatloaf ever,until now. Kudos to the member suggestions of laying slices of bread in the bottom of the pan to absorb grease(also keeps the bottm from overcooking). We also love to cook the brown sugar/ketchup mix on top and sides of the meatloaf with small holes poked in to let the good stuff cook right in!

I made the recipe with some slight changes as mentioned by other reviewers, and after making it will make 2 more changes.  Hmmm... after all these changes, it almost becomes a brand new recipe.  Anyway, this is what I did:  1. I added 2 slices of bread to the bottom of the pan (before adding the meatloaf mixture in) to absorb the fat while it baked.  I just tossed the bread afterwards as the other reviewer mentioned.  2. Instead of cracker crumbs, I used 3 slices of bread, which I cut up into tiny pieces.  3. I used 1/4 cup of milk as others mentioned, but did use 2 eggs as the recipe called for.  4. Added 1 tbsp. Worcestershire sauce to the meatloaf mixture.  5. I made the glaze using: 1/2 cup ketchup, 1/4 cup brown sugar, and 1 tbsp. Worcestershire sauce.  I added this to the top of the meatloaf about 30 minutes into baking, so that it would glaze over nicely without overcooking it.    The result: The glaze was awesome, and the meatloaf was good.  I thought the meat was a little tough.  I used extra-lean ground beef and I wonder if there simply wasn't enough fat.  Perhaps next time I'll try something slightly less lean.  Another thought was that I only used 1/4 cup of milk instead of 3/4 cup as the recipe called for.  Perhaps bringing up to 3/4 cup of milk would help.  One of the biggest changes I would make would be to fry the onions in a bit of olive oil prior to adding it to the meatloaf mix.  I added the chopped onions raw (per the recipe), but they didn't cook all the

This is THE Meatloaf recipe!! I followed other reviewers advice and put the ketchup/brown sugar on top and it turned out perfectly. I gave it 5 stars because the meatloaf itself can not be improved.! I felt the topping was too sweet and needed salt...which it probably would have gotten if the meatloaf had sat on it to bake. Will add a little salt to the topping next time but every thing else will stay just the same. I am not known for making good meatloaf, finally my DH didn't shake his head this time. He was too busy eating!  Thanks tangastar!

This was amazing! Loved the glaze!! All the glaze went on top. Used 2 lbs burger. Reduced brown sugar to 4 TBSPs, reduced milk to 1/2 cup, used only 1 egg, added chopped celery, added 2 TBSPs Worcestershire sauce in the burger mix and another TBSP in the brown sugar/ ketchup mixture. Used home-made breadcrumbs instead of crackers. Formed into loaf and baked in a 9X13 casserole dish. Didn't have a grease problem; I only had to drain once. Again, this was incredible!

My husband hates meatloaf so I've been trying to find a recipe he might like and I had high hopes for this one...sadly it was a failure.  The recipe calls for to much brown sugar and ketchup, only 1/4 cup of each is needed and should be placed on top not the bottom.  I also sautéed the onions in Worchester sauce before adding them to the meat mixture, which added a nice texture.

I'm not a meat loaf fan, but I love this recipe!  I use bread on the bottom of the pan to absorb the grease.  I put the 'sauce' on the top.  I bake at 375 until the juices run clear, about 40 minutes or so.  It comes out perfect every time.  Smells wonderful quickly!  You'll love it.

I've made this recipe quite a few times now and my husband and I both love this recipe! I decrease the amount of both brown sugar and ketchup used in the bottom of the pan (too sweet and runny for our taste) and use 2lbs hamburger meat instead (either 93 or 96% fat free, so it's not greasy at all). In addition, I also season the hamburger meat generously with garlic and onion powders and add a couple tablespoons of worchestershire sauce as well. After assembled in the loaf pan, I then spread a very thin layer of the ketchup mixed with a little brown sugar on the top and it always comes out perfectly. Excellent comfort food!

We really enjoyed the flavor of this meatloaf.  Even over cooked.  :)  Forgot to set the timer.  I absolutely LOVED the glaze, my fiance still added ketchup... but I think he did that out of habit.  I doubt he tasted it before he slathered the ketchup on.  Followed some reviews like putting sauce bottom and top, making it in a casserole dish to be able to drain a couple times and so on.  Very good.  Thank you!

I've made meatloaf for years by memory (always have made it like my moms) and decided to get some ideas and tried this.  With some alterations I can honestly say it was the best and most moist meatloaf I've ever had!  I added about 1/2 cup of ketchup to the meat and mixed it in.  After I had the loaf set I covered with aluminum foil (to keep in the moisture) and baked for about 25 minutes.  I took out the meatloaf and placed the ketchup and brown sugar on the top (only used about 1/4 cup of brown sugar) and placed the foil back on for 15 minutes and for the last 20 minutes I took the foil off so it would st better!  This was so moist with great flavor!

This is delicious! One thing I do differently is mix the brown sugar and ketchup and put that on top.  I use make-shift foil handles and pull out the loaf that way and the topping stays put!

This is so good!  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  Next time I will not use as much sugar, though. Update:  I did use less sugar the second time and tried it as other reviewers have with the glaze on top instead of the bottom.  The sugar and ketchup are meant to be on the bottom!!  It is so much better that way.  I don't know why that makes a difference, but it does!

I hate meatloaf and I love this one. This is the only meatloaf that I will eat and this is the same meatloaf recipe that I grew up with, except 2 changes. 1) We always added chopped green pepper. 2) We put the ketchup and brown sugar on top. You can make more of the brown sugar/ketchup mix and have it on the side for people who like extra (me). And you can adjust the brown sugar to your taste. It really is only there to take the edge off the ketchup and add a little sweetness and maple-like flavor. And the great thing about meatloaf is that it is a great dish to use up leftovers. Sometimes, when we have lots of leftovers in the fridge that need to be used up, we just throw a little bit of everything in. Peas, corn, carrots, mashed potatoes- adds a really creamy texture, gravy, almost anything goes well in meatloaf as long as you like it in the first place. Hope everyone else enjoys this recipe as much as I do!

This is a very good meatloaf recipe (after some modifications).  I took the suggestions of others.  I reduced the milk to 1/2c, the brown sugar to 1/4c, added another clove of garlic, onion soup mix to the meat instead of the chopped onion, and putting the glaze on top instead of in the bottom of the pan.  I also added a kick to the glaze with 1 tsp asian chile paste.  It was a good blend of sweet and spicy!  It also makes very good meatloaf sandwiches.  Thanks for the recipe and the suggested modifications.

Good basic meatloaf recipe...AND...as I read the other reviews I couldn't help but wonder...if you want the brown sugar and ketchup on top why not do as the recipe calls for and flip it over?  I am pretty sure that was how it was intended. That way you have a nice carmelized topping.

INCREDIBLE!!!!  I read the reviews and used 1/3 cup sugar and a splash of worsteshire (spell check) sauce and bread crumbs instead of crackers.  I also put the sauce on top of the meatloaf.  My husband and I LOVED this.  Great recipe, the brown sugar is the key!!!!  UPDATE: My husband and kids request this once a week.  This is definitely my husbands favorite meal of all time.  I often forget the ginger, but no one can tell.  This is probably the best recipe in my recipe box and it only takes about 15 minutes to prepare.  Thanks again for this incredible recipe!!

Excellent recipe...my husband said he rated it 100 stars:) I, like some of the other reviewers put the sauce on top of the meatloaf and I also added about 1 T of BBQ sauce,and the flavor was great. Next time instead of baking it in a baking dish,I'll use a rack to get the meat up out of the grease and juices. A great recipe to keep and make over and over.

This is WONDERFUL meatloaf!  I made it with the exact ingredients listed with just the alteration of 1/2 cup milk instead of 3/4, and I did put the brown sugar/ketchup mixture on top instead of on the bottom.  My husband LOVED this recipe!  I will definitely make it...in fact, this is "THE" meatloaf recipe for me now!  GREAT JOB Tangastar!!  And thank you!!!

This is the first meatloaf I have ever made.  I changed some things.  I added 1 whole garlic crushed.  I used a medium size onion.  I used 1/2 ts of ginger puree in addition to the dry. I added 2 tbs of Worcestershire to both the meat and the sauce.  I put the sauce on top and bread on the bottom I also used only 1/2 cup of milk but added 2 tbs of Ranchero liquid seasoning plus an extra 1/4 tsp of pepper.

I use this recipe all the time.  It's simple, tastes good and is a great way to use up any hamburger laying around.  Putting the brown sugar mixture on top of the loaf is a definite plus.  Last time I didn't have milk so I used some left over sour cream instead - it turned out just fine.

I LOVE this recipe.  It went over well with my family & we will be making this again!!  I do agree... Sauce mixture on top (I put a drizzle on bottom of pan, 1/4 cup in meatloaf & the rest on top) Of course I doubled the sauce. Also, a dash of cayenne & worcheshire in sauce. Very finely chopped celery, carrots & green onion really add to this (My son didn't even notice the additions! I guess I chopped well.)  Either add bread on bottom or be prepared to drain some grease off!! The taste is great, a little sweet, but if you only add half the sugar it also works! Yay!

This is probably my husband's favorite dish.  I double the ketchup/brown sugar glaze so there's plenty of sauce.  You have to cook 15-20 minutes longer this way, but there's a lot of yummy gravy.  Keep the ginger in the recipe.  I took it out at first, since I don't love ginger, but it really adds to the overall flavor.

Very good. I used quick rolled oats instead of crackers and it really turned out nice...very moist and not too sweet. I also added a little crushed red pepper to balance the sweetness. I'll make this one again for sure.

FOR VEGETARIANS: Since I was successful in adapting this recipe, I wanted to share my hints.  My vegetarian boyfriend could not remember the last time he had had meatloaf.  He LOVED it!  I am not a vegetarian, and I thought turned out pretty close to the original recipe :-)   I substituted 1 1/2 packages veggie crumbles (each 12oz package = 16 ground beef) for the ground beef.  I am familiar with Morning Star Grillers Vegetable Crumbles and they worked well.  I browned the veggie crumbles in vegetable oil until they were crispy and oily, giving them the texture of hamburger.  Otherwise they may have become mushy.  I also greased the sides of the pan well to prevent sticking.

I really wasn’t impressed. The brown sugar and ketchup were waaay too sweet for my taste. Thought it had too much onion, and I cut back to ¾ of an onion, but it was still overpowering. The ginger gave it a funny taste, and on top of everything it was kinda cardboardy- dry. Disappointing, I don’t get why it’s so highly reviewed.

I followed several of the other reviewer's suggestions (reduce qty of milk, swap Onion Soup Mix for Onion, Brown Sugar/Ketchup on TOP, etc.) - and this turned out to be the tenderest meatloaf I've ever had (though this would be the SECOND time I've ever made meatloaf) ;);)

I finally found a meatloaf that my family will eat! I did what most of the reviewers suggested. I only use 1/4 cup of brown sugar and I put it on top with the ketchup. I used one tablespoon of dry soup onion mix. It was very good!

Add 1/2 can of jelled Cranberry sauce to ketchup mix! Leave the brown sugar/ketchup sauce on the BOTTOM OF THE PAN! TIP: Put a piece of aluminum foil over the top and fold over the edge of the pan. This keeps the mixture on the loaf and not all over your kitchen. This way the sauce stays "saucy" and not cooked on the loaf. It also mixes with any juice that cooks off and makes it extra yummy (Don't cut the brown sugar for this reason)! :P Plus, it makes wrapping up any leftovers and clean up a breeze. For the loaf, cut the milk to 1/2 a cup, use about 2/3 package of saltines, 1 tsp. minced garlic and 1 tsp mustard seed. Not like Mom's... BETTER! Something great for my kids to strive for in the future! :D

Suburb meatloaf!

This is an excellent recipe that we will use again and again! I did put the ketchup / sugar mixture on top, and I didn't bother measuring the ketchup as I could see how much I needed to coat the top. I used plenty of brown sugar, as I love the sweetness of the topping, and I used a half cup of milk, which I may cut down on by a hair next time. 

I used a slightly deeper pan, so I found it necessary to up the cooking time and I cooked it for over an hour. I seasoned the meat mixture with dried minced onion as well as garlic powder. Next time, I will add salt to the mixture, as I felt the meat wasn't quite salty enough as is. Also, the fresh chopped onion really added to the texture as well as the flavor....I know some other reviewers used onion soup mix, but I personally would not leave the fresh onion out. It needs to be there.

By the time it came out of the oven, the whole house smelled so terrific that I couldn't wait to dig in! This is a fabulous recipe that I will make again. Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely the best meatloaf I've ever had! It has a wonderful flavor & texture. Don't change a thing. (Except maybe using onion soup mix in lieu of an onion) 

Putting the brown sugar & ketchup on top makes it too sweet. Let it mix with the juices in the bottom of the pan.

As far as meatloaf goes, this isn't the one the Connor family dreads on Roseanne reruns.  Every ingredient is sure to be in your pantry.  It smells fabulous, spicy and savory, as it cooks, and dances that sweet and sour dance on your tongue.  You'll want seconds, and maybe even thirds!

Great recipe - just like my mom always makes. I am surprised at the people who said the topping was too sweet - mine almost had a sweet and sour flavor which was just perfect to cut through the dense taste of the meatloaf. This is a good family recipe that will remain a keeper.

Thought this was great!  I did take the suggestions of others and used 1/3 c brown sugar, 1/2 c milk.  I also cut the salt down to 1 tsp and used 3/4 of an onion, and used 1/2 c oats instead of crackers.  I needed this in a hurry and cooked it in 40 min, by preparing it in muffin pans.  It filled two pans, and since I was only cooking for two, I froze the other one for a quick dinner though the week.

Easy! Kids will love it; a basic, pedestrian meatloaf. Here's what I recommend: sautee the onion first (I don't like crunchy things in a soft meatloaf - the onion didn't soften much even after an hour of cooking). I used Town House reduced fat crackers; worked fine. 3/4 cups quick cooking oats will do the trick too in a pinch. This is a sweet meatloaf, so I'd limit amount of garlic, green pepper, etc; might clash too much with the sweet. You could very easily do away with one egg in this  recipe. Next time, I'll mix brown sugar, ketchup & worchestershire to form a paste & then spread on top to prevent oil from pooling on top. Chili sauce in place of the ketchup would work well here too. Be sure to use a 90% lean ground beef or better. I used 80% and it was literally swimming in grease when done. The brown sugar top is the key here -- you can change up the rest to suit your taste and still get the "Yum" from the topping.

This was one of the best meatloaf recipes I have come across! I made a few adjustments. I used half ground beef and half ground turkey. I omitted the onions and salt and used dry onion soup mix(didn't want to risk being too salty!). I subbed honey garlic bbq sauce for the catsup and added 1tbsp worcestershire sauce to the brn sugar mixture. I put of a couple slices bread in a 9x13 baking dish to absorb the grease. i brushed the bread with the mixture and put the loaf on top of that. i also brushed the loaf with the mixture and basted every 15 min. while cooking. Wonderful with garlic mashed potatoes..will definitely be making again...thank you :)

This is a great recipe. I've cooked it several times. The only thing I change is the sauce. Instead of cooking it with the meatloaf I cook it in a pot and pour it over the meatloaf after it's cooked then broil it for about 3 minutes to caramelize it. My family loves it!

This was delicious - even subsituting non-dairy creamer (Ick!) for the the milk because we keep kosher.  

The recipe leaves out the fact that you need to serve this inverted on a serving plate.  

Also, I think next time I will add some ketchup to the meat mix for flavor and color.

Very good, I added all the ingredients together instead of putting the sugar and ketchup on the bottom, then covered the top with BBQ sauce.  Very good, very moist!

This is an excellent recipe and I get requests for it all of the time.  The brown sugar and catsup at the bottom of the pan (in my opinion)is to get the full flavor of the juices. If it's on top my guess is it will be dry. I use a nonstick loaf pan. When I flip out the meatloaf, I make sure that I use an oval platter and I keep the loaf pan on top while doing so. Just like with layer cakes. This eliminates the splatters and if the catsup stays in the bottom of the pan, just scoop it out and put it back on the meatloaf.  It's so good that nobody cares anyway.

This is a wonderful recipe full of amazing flavor! My husband said it was the best meatloaf he has ever had and I enjoyed it as much, too. A couple things that can help: I'm amazed that no one knows the simple little trick to get rid of the grease in meatloaf. It must be a secret trick and I didn't know that it was! So I'm going to share the trick with you. Use a large oven bowl and place a mug on the flat bottom of the bowl upside down. Make sure that the mug is FLAT on the flat bowl or it won't work. Then place the meatloaf around the mug. Glaze it and place it in the oven and bake as usual. When it is done, take the bowl out of the over and let it sit on the counter to cool for 10 minutes or so. As soon as you take it out of the oven it was look very greasy, but you have to let it sit and cool. During this time the mug in the center will begin to suck in the grease. Once the grease is all in the mug you cancut it and eat the meatloaf, but be careful not to break the suction of the mug or the grease will come right back out. Another neat little extra ingredient is cheese. Put about 3/4 or 1/2 of the meat mixture in the bowl around the mug, top with cheese, and then cover the cheese with the remaining meatloaf. Glaze and bake as usual. Yum! Hope this helps those who don't like grease!

I was extremely dissappointed with this recipe. I have tried two other meatloafs in my lifetime that I thought were delicious. This one sat in a pool of grease. It was moist. I did like the glaze but the actual loaf was just boring and didn't even have a nice beef flavor. Added some garlic powder. I think if I try this again I would add the sugar and ketchup to the inside. I also might sub bread crumbs for the saltines. Probably will just add a similar glaze to my own meatloaf recipe. Will not make again as is. BIG LETDOWN on flavor.

This was the first time I made meatloaf and it was a very simple and easy recipe to follow. Although, I followed other reviews and only used 1/2 cup of milk and 1 egg. I also just mixed the ketchup and brown sugar to my liking and put half on bottom and half on top. This is great for first time meatloafers! : )

I am a bachelor and do all my own cooking,and had this hamburger meat in the fridge. I go online and find this recipe with the most positive reviews and decided to try it. It was awesome, and everybody was licking their fingers from the brown sugar and onions. It's worth trying!

Ok I'm not much of a meatloaf person...I think I only made maybe 5 in my life.  So I decided to try again and I made this tonight but with a few alterations and it still worked.  I changed the servinngs to 6, so that the meat would measure up to about a lb (that's all I had on hand).  I also added about 1/2 cup of basmati rice, a few fine chopped mushrooms, crumbled whole wheat crackers, 1 tbsp of wheat germ (extra vitamins always a plus!), 3 cloves garlic minced, 1 egg and a dash of Mrs Dash.  For the sauce I used half ketchup and the other half Cattleman's Sweet Honey BBQ sauce, a splash of worcestershire sauce, a tsp or 2 of dijon mustard and about 1/3cup plus 1 tbsp of the brown sugar.  I did put some on the bottom of the pan and the rest on the top.  I saved some of the glaze so I could reapply later.  I baked for 1 hour uncovered cause well I don't think it specified.  I put the rest of the glaze on the top and sides of the loaf and stuck it in the oven for about 10-15 more minutes while the rest of the sides were finishing up.  Finished product was interesting.  I expecting to see this pool of sauce on the bottom of the pan from the beginning, but it was absorbed into the meat.  Very good meatloaf.  My 3 yr old gobbled it up and guess what we're having for lunch tomorrow.. meatloaf sandwiches YUM!  I will try this recipe again, tweaking it to my tastes and textures along the way, oh and definitely doubling it.  THANKS

Yummy! This will be the only meatloaf I make from now on at home. I used ritz instead of saltines, but everything else I used the same! It is a little sweet, but that is why it is called brown sugar meatloaf. If you don't like sweet meatloaf, don't make it and give it a bad review! :) It was very good, mine just took a little longer than the recipe states to bake it.

I will never go back to another meatloaf again! This was the best ever! I used egg beaters instead of eggs and used bread crumbs instead of crushed crackers. (had to add 2x the amt of bread crumbs as crackers though to soak up the milk, but it was worth it! Very very good! I put the sugar/ketchup mix on top, next time I think I will make double that mix and put it on top and bottom- will definately make again, maybe next week! every week!

Awesome meatloaf.  The ginger and cracker crubs are something different.  I will cut the sugar in 1/2 nest time as it was pretty sweet.  There was none left.

Excellent...everyone in my family loved. I followed the suggestion of others by cutting the sugar in half, using half the sauce on the bottom and half the sauce on the top, and add 1 tbsp of worchesire sauce. I also cut down the milk to about a 1/4 of a cup. It came out perfect--moist and didnt fall apart. I also added a bit of garlic salt to it, but probably didn't make much of a difference.

I mixed the ketchup with brown sugar and poured over top then backed it. I also used oatmeal instead of bread crumbs. My husband LOVES this dish and it smells amazing while it is cooking. Oh, I also only use about half the onion powder packet mix because it is really strong. I recommend this!!

This is the best meatloaf I have ever had in my life!  I make it frequently and we just love it!  I would never dream of making it any other way again.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! I changed it up by using 1 pound ground beef and 1/2 pound pork sausage to add a little zing and added half an hour to the bake time (I do this with my usual meatloaf) and it was wonderful! I was worried I'd lose the glaze when I had to drain off the fat, but it stayed intact under the loaf. Serves up great with brown sugar-glazed carrots and pumpkin pie for dessert. Yum! Thanks for the recipe!

Shoot!  I thought I had already found the utlimate meatloaf recipe on this site under, "Sweet and Sour Meatloaf".  Well, I think this one is the winner!  It's very easy to make.  I acutally mix up the meat mixture in my Kitchen Aid.  This way my hands stay nice and clean.  I would suggest that you leave it standing after you take it out of the oven for five to ten minutes as this allows the sauce to thicken up.

This is really great meatloaf!  Kids had thirds.  If you like the sweet tomato sauce on meatloaf, you will love this recipe!

Very good recipe. If you don't like too much sugar, don't add it. The art of cooking is to adapt food to your liking. For this recipe, I used 1/2 the brown sugar and ketchup. I put some on the top of the loaf and some on the bottom. I also used half group turkey and half ground beef. I omitted the ginger. It was fabulous. My boyfriend is still talking about it.

This meatloaf is very delicious.  I did not have saltine crakers so I used 3/4 cup of toast(crushed it in the food prosesor.)  In stead of beef I used low fat ground turkey.  The brown sugar and katchup  mixture is the best part.

We did not like this one. Too much sugar! I guess we just don't like sugary meat. Reading the reviews, this seems to be a recipe people really, really liked, or they absolutely hated it.

this is my favorite meatloaf recipe. only add one is extra pinch Ginger, salt and pepper. when no saltines available I substitute bread crumbs. this recipe is fabulous on it's own. the only thing I did was substitute and add(I do all recipes I use) extra seasoning. BUT to be frankly honest this recipe is perfect without modifications. thanks for this wonderful recipe

This is a good base recipe but after reading reviews I changed it quiet a bit. I omitted the ginger and my boyfriend isn't crazy about sweets so I reduced the sugar. I only used enough sugar to make a thin layer at the bottom of the pan. I also added chopped green and red peppers to the meat in addition to the onion and seasoned it with worchester sauce, garlic powder basil and plenty of salt and pepper. I also noticed it took longer to cook, close to an hour and a half. Another change I thought was good was that in addition to the ketchup on the bottom I also added ketchup tot he top during the last fifteen minutes of baking. With all my changes this turned out really delicious and my boyfriend loved it! He has been asking me to make it agian and I just made it last week!

I have tried many, many meatloaf recipes over the years and quite enjoyed this one.  I didn't find it too sweet, as others readers have, but did find the texture to be just a bit too moist.  I would agree with other reviewers to slightly reduce the amount of milk.  I would also agree that the brown sugar & ketchup mixed together would be better placed on top of the loaf.

My husband absolutely LOVED this recipe.  He said it was better than his mom's-which is pretty darn good.  I have to stress that using very lean beef is important or else you'll battle grease.  We have made this at least 3 or 4 times and it turns out great every time.  Adding a layer of cheddar cheese in the middle makes this a little more delicious, but it's not necessary.

Mmmm.. perfect comfort food. At first, I wasn't sure if I should bake it in a loaf pan or shape it in a loaf and bake it in a bigger pan.. I did the latter and I'm glad I did so that the meatloaf wouldn't swim in the fat/juice. I took the suggestion to cut down on the milk to 1/2 cup, cut brown sugar slightly, and spread ketchup on top. If you squirt the ketcup out from the bottle in a criss-cross design, the loaf looks more appetizing. Overall, I loved it.. the brown sugar on the bottom was a great touch. Thanks for the recipe!!

This was great, I added fresh diced garlic and green pepper and added garlic powder in place of the omitted salt.  My husband has to cut back on salt intake.  This still came out great.  Thanks so much for the post.

I followed the recipe and halfway through cooking I needed to drain the fatty juice from the pan. Lucky I checked it. This is my first time trying meatloaf. As an Australian we never have it, we usually do the most fantastic rissoles and I assumed that the meatloaf would be very nice. How wrong can you get?  There was nothing of interest in the meat. It needs tomatoes, capsicum at least to cut through the plainness.

Loved the sweet taste of this meatloaf.  I whipped the ketchup and brown sugar left in the bottom of the pan and drizzled over cooked meatloaf.  It was very easy and very good.

This is the BEST meatloaf I have EVER tasted.  My family said this was their favorite new dinner!  I followed the recipe to a T with the exception of the ginger, which I omitted.  The amount of seasonings are perfect and the rich sauce that is transformed from the brown sugar and ketchup is DIVINE!  There is enough sauce by putting it in the bottom, you don't need to add more.  Check it that way first or it may be too sweet for you.  I baked it in a silicone baking pan and inverted the loaf after cooking onto a serving platter and the sauce covers the entire top of the loaf.  This is one recipe I will be making OFTEN.  The ONLY think I may do next time is to add a touch of green pepper.

This came out great! I wasn't sure if I should put the brown sugar/ketchup on the bottom, top, side after reading the reviews so I decided to follow the recipe to the letter and I'm glad I did! I think if you put the "sauce" on the top and bottom, it will be way too sweet. On the bottom, it was just a nice glaze. I used a 90/10 meat, and I drained it at the end of cooking. Not greasy at all. I used bread crumbs in place of the crackers, and I highly recommend cooking the onions first or just using onion powder because otherwise they will be too crunchy. This is AWESOME, and will be my meatloaf recipe from now on :)

I was not impressed with this. I used lean beef and it was still greasy. Also the brown sugar/ketchup topping got runny from the grease pooling in the bottom of the pan. I will not be making this again.

im not rating this recipe cos i made too many changes to it - i used bread crumbs instead of cracker crumbs, and i added worcestershire sauce, johnnys garlic seasoning, cajun spices, cayenne pepper, parsely, and i put a thin layer of brown sugar at the bottom of the pan, and spread a layer of ketchup on the top. i also used my finger to poke some holes in the top of the loaf to allow the juices to seep in. very very moist meatloaf. my husband was askin me to get my friend's recipe, but after tasting this, he said that she should ask for mine :P he said it was perfect. :) yay for me. served it with herb pasta and roasted baby carrots, cherry tomatoes and zucchini.

Well, I'm definitely in the minority here. My husband really liked this recipe but I didn't care for it at all. I guess I just don't care for my meatloaf with sugar. Thanks though.

Everyone who has tried this has absolutely loved it.  It has become my signature recipe at home.  Great with good ole mashed potatoes.  I add a little of my favorite barbecue sauce in with the ketchup to just give it a little more spice to it.

Superb! We loved it! Just the right combination of flavors! I used a diet lean ground beef with good results. In place of the saltine cracker crumbs I substituted wheat-free bread crumbs (allergy) and it turned out just fine and no one noticed! It still got lots of raves! Great post!

I am the odd man out here.  I hated this recipe.  It was so sweet I could not eat it.  Even though I used very lean ground beef the grease mixed in with the ketchup and sugar and was really nasty.  Oh well. :)

This did not set up for me at all. It was raw and "loose" after nearly twice the cooking time. The other reviews are so great I don't know what happened. The only thing I can think is I did make it in advance and so it went from several hours in the fridge to the oven. Could that be it?

I have to admit this is probably the *best* meatloaf I've ever had.  I pulled this recipe and my wife put it all together.  If we would change anything in this recipe, I would maybe try to add a little minced garlic to the meatloaf itself.  The brown sugar & ketchup makes a phenominal 'glaze'.  I recommend this to anyone new to cooking...it is simple, but great!

I adapted this recipe to fit in a smaller loaf pan and it worked out perfectly.  What I did: used 1 lb ground beef, 2 eggs,1 cup cracker crumbs,1/2 c milk, and 1 onion.  I cut the amount of seasonings in half but used full recipe of brown sugar and ketchup.  I cooked it for the full amt of time.  It was moist and held together great.  Will probably add a little mustard to the "sauce" next time to make it more like my mother's recipe.  This is our family's new favorite.

I made this meatloaf tonight for dinner, the first meatloaf I've ever made, and my husband loved it!  I'm a vegetarian so I can't comment on the taste, but the preparation was very easy.  I used bread crumbs instead of crackers and also added some worcestershire to the glaze mixture which I put in the bottom of the pan and on top of the loaf.  I also reduced the milk to 1/2 cup like some others suggested.  The texture of the loaf was perfect, not too loose and not too firm.  I used 90% lean beef and it wasn't greasy at all like some reviewers experienced.  I will use this recipe again and again.  Thanks Starbuck!

If you are a person who likes sweet things (sweet and sour sauce or honey mustard for example) you will LOVE this.  It is a quick, cheap and easy way to use ground beef.  LOVE IT!!

This meatloaf was yummy!  I used minced dried onion instead of fresh, a little powdered beef stock, Italian bread crumbs instead of crushed crackers (too much work) and a shot of worchestershire.  I also lessened the brown sugar and ginger but next time a will use the full amount of brown suger as I loved the tiny taste I got! Also, my loaf pan is two layered with drip holes in the top to get rid of the fat, but I also lost a lot of the yummy glaze so next time I will use a regular one. The best part? The next day, slice the leftovers thin, quick fry and make a sandwich with melted cheese. Heaven!

Absolutely wonderful. I’ve never big a big fan of meatloaf, but the brown sugar and ginger in this recipe added sweet twist that my family enjoyed immensely. The leftovers made marvelous sandwiches.

Ok.....this is quite different then a standard meatloaf.  I wasn't convinced it was for my taste buds at FIRST, but but but after the second slice I decided it was delicious! I'm sure it will be even BETTER the second day as is the nature of most meatloafs.  If you're not a "sweets" person it might be a bit much, but I wouldn't change ONE thing about the recipe! I served it with rice, and steamed corn. We drizzled the broth from the pan over the rice.  Wow..... for sure 5 stars!

Kids love this variation - Put the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom of muffin tins, fill with meat mixture, bake 45 min. Spoon suace on top after removing. Makes 12 individual loaves.

A decent basic meatloaf but the topping was a bit too sweet for us.  If I made it again, I'd cut back on the sugar.

This is great.  My husband loves meatloaf and this is his fav.  I cut the brown sugar to 1/4 cup and put most of the glaze on top rather than bottom and added the rest of glaze the last 10 min. of cooking.  Turned out great.  This is the only way I make meatloaf now.  Thanks!

My husband gave me the "thumb's-up" for this recipe!  He is not a big meatloaf fan, but I think I have changed his mind!  It was easy, and very moist and tasty.  I think next time I might add a little garlic or garlic salt in place of the salt... otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing.  If you don't like it so sweet, you could probably replace the brown sugar and ketchup for just about anything.
Thanks for this great recipe!

After reading all of the wonderful reviews, I was very disappointed with this recipe. It was just TOO sweet. Unless you love sweet food, I would not try this meatloaf. The flavor just did not go well with meatloaf. I also had to cook this for at least 20 minutes more then the directions said because the middle was very mushy and not fully cooked.

After reading some of the reviews, I decided to update my own review of a couple of years ago.  I notice that folks are putting the sauce on top of the loaf before or during cooking.  This isn't necessary, and I think it takes away from the recipe a bit.  By cooking the loaf in the sauce (on the bottom), you are basting it in the brown sugar flavouring.  With this method, at the end of cooking, you can see the bare top of the meatloaf and ensure that the juices are running clear.  With the sauce on top, it is harder to check for proper doneness.    As for removing the loaf from the pan, just take a couple of spatulas on each end, lift it out, and place it on a serving dish.  I usually slice it at this point so that each slice has more sauce on it.  With the sauce still in the loaf pan, use a turkey baster to suck out the fat like you would do with gravy.  Then stir the sauce for a minute or two to blend it with the pan drippings.  Pour this over the slices of meatloaf and you're done!  The presentation is much nice this way, because you don't have that goopy "ketchuppy" layer on the top of the loaf.

What an AMAZING meatloaf!  My friends (L&D) and I made this for a big party we put them in individual disposable loaf pans (quick clean up!) in two of them we put soft boiled eggs.  Using sour cream and onion dry soup really makes it moist and delicious (Deb's tip) and basting it with it own juices while its cooking (Lam's tip) really helps. It was a huge success !!

I wish there were 20 stars to give to this meatloaf!!  It was fantastic and very easy.  My boyfriend and I both think this is the best we've ever had, and he's 56 and I'm 45!!  Thanks sooo much tangastar for a wonderful recipe, I'll never make meatloaf any other way again.  ****  
12 years later, I still love this meatloaf.  The only thing I do now is put the ketchup & brown sugar on top instead of the bottom.  I like it better that way.**** now in 2019, making it for dinner again because it's the very best meatloaf I've made in my 62 years!!

I was all excited after reading the great reviews for this meatloaf, and was bitterly disappointed. It was a sweet meatloaf, nothing special, not incredible, just...sweet meatloaf. I cooked it to it's exact specifications, and it must not be all that bland because my husband and father-in-law loved it. I couldn't taste the ginger, and not that meatloaf is the most beautiful thing inthe world, but with no topping in the dish it looked really ugly. A good experiment, but don't make it with company in mind until you've tried it!

Best meatloaf ever!  The brown sugar gives this the most wonderful flavor.  My husband loved it and usually hates meatloaf.  I did alter slightly by making 2 smaller loaves rather than 1 large as some reviewers said the inside wasn't getting fully cooked.  I will most definitely make this again and again!

My family loved this! A couple alterations, but still great.  I only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar. I added 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to the ketchup that you pour over the sugar. I used 1/2 cup of milk and 1 egg.  I added 2 cloves of garlic to the meat mixture and some bell pepper.

OK, for those who don't like the catsup and brown sugar on the bottom of the pan, here's what you do instead. Pour half of your sauce mixture into the meat mixture and the remainder over the top once you've made the loaf. This flavors the meatloaf throughout and keeps it moist. BTW, I prefer using an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce instead of catsup and bread crumbs rather than saltines. Don't think it needs quite that much sugar. One-fourth cup is sufficient and a dash of worchester in the sauce is good as well,

I agree with the reviewer who said to use a casserole dish instead of a loaf pan. My tip: cover a meat rack with aluminum foil and poke little wholes in the foil with a knife to drain the grease. Place the meat rack in the casserole dish and put the meatloaf on top. Then,I love to use brown sugar, ketchup, and 1 tsp of dry mustard as a glaze over the top. I put it on as I place it in the oven.Turns out moist and delicious!

This was awesome and moist.  I do think there is a little too much milk, I had to add breadcrumbs so it wasn't so wet.  I did add a package of onion soup mix instead of an onion.  I also added about 3 cloves of garlic.  I mixed together the ketchup and brown sugar and added just enough to the bottom of the dish to cover it.  I put the rest on the top.  Next time I make this I will slightly reduce the amount of sauce, it was a lot.  But overall this was delicious (with the changes I would give it a 5) and I will be making it again.  I dinged it a star just because I thought the package of onion soup mix was a fairly significant change.  It did cook perfectly in a glass loaf pan in 1 hour and the juices at the bottom were great on potatoes. *Update:  I made the leftovers as a meatloaf sandwich for the BF with onions, tomatoes, a good sharp cheddar and garlic aioli on toasted sourdough and he said it was amazing.

This was easy peasy to make and my 9 year old had two helpings and took some in his lunch the next day.  I made with red potatoes and Green beans.  I would maybe cut back the sugar a little next time or maybe do a BBQ version

My wife never liked any meatloaf recipe... which was a problem, because I like meatloaf  (and I am the primary cooker).   Anyway, she LOVES this one.  And its very quick, and easy.

As with any meatloaf recipe, feel free to experiment with ingredients as you see fit.   I enjoy the brown sugar and ketchup "gravy" that coats this meatloaf after inverting onto a serving platter.  Looks nice, tastes great.

This one is in my recipe box, and is a recipe that get used regularly in our house.  Thanks for posting it.

I made only two substitutions, simply so I could use what I had on hand. I subbed panko breadcrumbs and a little extra salt for the crackers and two tablespoons of minced dried onions. The verdict? Delicious meatloaf with an overly sweet, completely unnecessary glaze. The kids liked it, but my husband and I scraped it off and enjoyed the real star of the recipe--the meatloaf itself!

This was such a delicious sweet meatloaf! I took out of oven after 1 hour and let it sit in the juice for about 30 min and I think that helped with the juice soaking in the meat. I did not have a problem with it falling apart. Only thing I did different was use bread crumbs instead of crackers.

I loved this meatloaf recipe.  I read through some of the comments and these are the changes I made:  instead of the crackers, I use rolled oats and I put my sauce on top.  Added a dash of Worcestershire sauce and voila.  The best meatloaf ever.  My partner told me that he hates meatloaf but this is now one of his favorite dishes.  Yum!

This is my go-to meatloaf recipe now! As I hate raw onions I sauté them in a little bit of olive oil until just before they caramelize. I also spread the brown sugar/ketchup mixture on top. I don't know why, but it does require a full two hours in the oven. Even with that much extra time, it never comes out dry. This recipe is just plain awesome!

Although this is a really good meatloaf, I still thinking it could deserve some good tweaking. The meatloaf is also a little too sweet for my taste. However, my husband loved it! I did as others recommended and put the ketchup sauce on top of the meatloaf then cooked it. This is really good to pair w/ mashed potatoes and green beans!

To be honest it has potential the sauce was great so taste was there however the meat is way to moist and wet in my opinion and would have much rather enjoyed a drier meatloaf.  I will try the sauce combo but use my old recipe for the meat.  If texture is a big deal for you I would caution on trying this one.

This was awesome, followed some advise for revision from others and my husband actually asks for it! He was not a fan before this! What I did was only 1 egg and a half a cup of milk, added 2 cloves of garlic, added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to the sauce and of course put the sauce on top! and half of the sauce on top before you put it in and the other half for the last 20 min or so and perfect! also another great thing you could do is use seasoned bread crumbs, they do make a great difference but I did not have any and it was still awesome!

I made one basic change and that is I put the brown sugar on top.  I wish they would have said why they put it on the bottom.I wish I had added more ginger and garlic.

Awesome! For the simple ingredients, I'm amazed at the flavor they create. I was skeptical that it would be anything more than ordinary, but it turned out just delicious! Mine wasn't pretty....but we'll see what I get next time.

I wholeheartedly agree with several other reviewers that the sauce should be on top of the meatloaf instead of the bottom of the pan.  When making the sauce topping, add about 1 tsp. of yellow prepared mustard to the brown sugar and ketchup.  I suggest waiting until the last 15 to 20 minutes to spread the sauce over the meatloaf.  Otherwise, the brown sugar will either burn or caramelize.

great meatloaf , but we put down 4 pieces of bread in a 8 x 8 casserole dish at the bottom to soak up the grease. Also, did the brown sugar / ketchup on the top , not the bottom.

This was my 1st meatloaf & it was delicious! I'm usually not a fan of ginger, but it went very well with the brown sugar. After reading the reviews, I made a few modifications to the original recipe: I used a little over 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup milk, a packet of onion soup mix instead of the onion and I mixed the ketchup + brown sugar together & added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to it.  I didn't have any crackers in the pantry so I used plain bread crumbs. I poured the ketchup mixture on top of the meatloaf & added a few strips of bacon to the top. Sooo good! Thanks for a great recipe!

This is the best meatloaf ever! I did make quite a few modifications after reading the reviews, plus some of my own, which I will list.
1. I only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar and added worcestershire sauce to the glaze. 2. I only used 1/2 cup of milk and it was plenty 3. I substituted one packet of Lipton's Onion Soup mix in place of the onion 4. I used crushed Ritz crackers vs the saltines. I felt that it needed two eggs to bind the meat, plus added more protein.

I put a small layer of the sauce on the bottom of the pan and put the rest on the top of the meatloaf and it came out perfect.  Smelled and tasted delicious!

My family loves this recipe. I followed other reviewers advice and used 1 egg, 1/2 cup of milk, 1/4 cup of brown sugar and added 2 cloves of garlic and 1 tbl Worcestershire. I also substituted the bread crumbs with oatmeal(a family thing). I put the ketchup mixture on top of the loaf instead of on the bottom.

Very very tasty meatloaf! I put bread slices at the bottom of the loaf pan and instead of putting the brown sugar mixture at the bottom, it was placed on top. I cooked it for one hour uncovered, came out super moist and good. Oh and I used breadcrumbs instead of crackers (didn't have any) and omitted the onions (don't like them).

Hubby really liked it. I did take other reviewers suggestions  I added 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to the ketchup/brown sugar mix. - I used 1/2 cup of milk and 1 egg. - I added 2 cloves of garlic to the meat mixture. Finally, I used a cup of season bread crumbs instead of the crackers. Thanks for the recipe.

Best meatloaf I've ever had and my family agreed! I read through the reviews and looked at the pictures... it seems like almost everyone suggests to put the sugar and ketchup on the top WITHOUT even trying the actual recipe instructions. I was hesitant as well (we all grew up with sweetened ketchup baked on top of the meatloaf), but I went for it anyway. So glad I did! Instead of just the topping that you always wish you had more of, the sugar and ketchup make a marinade for the entire meatloaf but doesn't make it soggy. I would probably use a little less sugar than called for but that is just my taste. I will make my meatloaf with the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom from now on!  The ginger was a nice zing to the meat also, I've never added that to meatloaf before.

Wonderful! I found out this works great in muffin tin pans and cook for 20 min at 350 degrees. That speeds up cooking and makes just the right serving size for young children. This will become a regular since my 3 year old loved it. Thanks so much for the great recipe.

Made this it was awesome. Put the brown sugar ketchup glaze on top instead. Basically I patted the brown sugar on top, then spread ketchup over that before baking. I also layered the bottom of my pan with bread to soak up the extra grease. (I had a package of hairdo  buns that were ready for the ducks so I used those for purposes of making less greasy, we did not eat the bread..it worked like a charm). This meatloaf was irresistible! My husband & kids ate it for days! Just the perfect mix of ingredients not too many different tastes, which made this awesome.

I've been making meatloaf with brown sugar for a long time.I started doing that to get my kids to eat it.I thought I was the only one! Mine is a little different.Sometimes I wrap the meatloaf in bacon. I mix ketchup,a little mustard or Dijon mustard WITH the brown sugar and spread that on top a few minutes before the loaf is done.I make sure to put enough on it that it drizzles down the sides.I have a teen daughter who usually doesn't like  meat and she even eats it.I don't use anything like ginger or onion pieces in mine or my kids would definitely not eat it! I sometimes use a meatloaf mix(anything cheap)I cook for 4 kids/2 adults so on a budget.I don't understand why sometimes people who write these recipes throw stuff in that your average parents at home doesn't have.Ginger is not something we use and def not running out to the store for some just for meatloaf.If I don't have a mix on hand I use salt,pepper,bread crumbs,eggs,milk and I always tear apart a couple of pieces of bread to go in it.If ya want more grab whatever is on hand.I've used seasoned salt and steak seasoning before!I also toss in a little Worcestershire sauce or  steak sauce when mixing it up.I use whatever ground beef is on sale.My family eats it so fast I always have to make 2 or more.If ya want kids to eat something just adding the brown sugar may noty do it.Keep it simple when mixing it.I've added soy mix before and the fam didn't even notice.Doing too much with the ingredients most kids won't eat it

Good quick and easy meatloaf.   I cooked it in a meatloaf pan that catches the grease below.  A lot less greasy.  I put the brown sugar on top as well as the ketchup.   I also mixed in one packet of meatloaf seasoning packet.  Good texture and great flavor.  I will make this again.

Although the flavor of this meatloaf was tasty, it didn't turn out the way it's pictured - the sauce remained on the bottom.  At least it permeated the meat, though, making for a very juicy meatloaf!

However, I did increase the ingredient quantities for a larger loaf, using 3/4# ground pork instead of more beef, so that may have been the reason, as well as cooked it at a lower temp, since I was roasting potatoes alongside the meatloaf.  I would make this again but I think I would mix the b sugar and ketchup and top the loaf instead.  Oh, and cut down on the sugar qty as it was a bit too sweet for my taste.

Hubby and kids loved it regardless of my gooofs, so that's what counts in the end :D

I think I will try the ketchup and brown sugar mix on top of the loaf next time.  We used ground pork and it was delicious.

This is my families favorite dish! This is always my "go to recipe" when making dinner for company. Usually, when I tell people my meatloaf is "sweet tasting" they look at me like I'm crazy!...until they try it! The first time I made this recipe, I followed the recipe exact and it turned out great! But, here recently, Ive been putting my own spin on it! Which is also great! After reading some other reviews, I started putting the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom AND the top. I also mix ketchup and BBQ sauce together and make extra sauce mix.  I always use Ritz crackers. Sometimes, I even add a pack of onion soup mix to the meat mixture! Like I said, this recipe is a 5 start with or without my alterations! You will not be displeased!

This was just OK.  It didn't wow me at all.  The meatloaf was very bland.  I took other poster's advice & added garlic & Worcestershire sauce.  Maybe I didn't add enough.  It definitely needs something more.  I did take the advice of putting the sauce on top of the loaf instead of the bottom & think that's a good suggestion.  I don't understand the raving about this recipe.

My family loves this meatloaf! I also have made a few changes to it. I didn't use Ginger and I used seasoned bread crumbs instead of cracker crumbs. I have made it with the glaze on the bottom and on the top and prefer it cooked on top. I also do not use a loaf pan but cook it on a broiler pan so the grease drips off of it into the bottom of the pan.

Fantastic! It's best done in a loafpan to help drain the grease. I made a few changed due to lack of ingredients. I used the onion soup mix instead of onions, no milk, and I mixed the brown sugar in a bowl with the ketchup and lathered it on top. This is by far the best meatloaf I have ever made. Kudos tangastar, this was fantastic.

Another review after a ton of modifications were made (mostly due to what I had on hand).  No loaf pan, so used a foil lined large casserole (which kind of prevents putting the sauce on the bottom).  One lb ground beef, to which I added a couple dashes of Worcestershire, garlic salt, onion salt, one egg, 1/4 tsp black pepper, about a 1/4 of the sauce mixture, and 3/4 cup panko breadcrumbs.  Nothing else (onion allergy).  For the sauce I used a scant 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup honey chipotle BBQ sauce, 1/4 cup ketchup, and a couple of squirts of yellow mustard. I formed half of the meat into a loaf shape in the casserole, and smeared on about 1/3 of the remaining sauce.  Layered the other half of meat on top of that, and smeared another 1/3 of the sauce all over the loaf.  I reserved the remaining sauce to use as a dip.  Baked at 350 for an hour with two baking potatoes (oiled and salted), and everything was done after the hour.  The meatloaf needed salt (I only added garlic and onion salt, and not enough of those), and was a tad mushy (due to the panko, I think), but neither was the fault of the recipe.  Great base recipe to make your own, since the meat IS a bit bland.  But what a great jumping off point!  I'll try again, as per the recipe, sans the onion, and continue to experiment until I find MY perfect meatloaf.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Love this recipe!  I amped it up a bit by adding half cooked bacon to the top of it before putting it in the oven.  Just cook bacon until it is no quite done, drape the slices over the top then cook as usual, gives good guidelines for slices the meatloaf too (one piece of bacon per slice)- soooo good.

This was a great meal we paired with corn, cottage cheese and beets. The brown sugar and ketchup was put on top instead of on the bottom, and we added more pepper and took the ginger away. I used buttered crackers, they taste better to me. Overall very well taken by the family.

It was awesome!!  Very simple, inexpensive and tasty.  I also used the onion soup mix.  Ketchup and sugar and Worcestershire sauce on top...in a casserole dish.  The only other thing that I have always added to my meatloaf dishes is lima beans around the outer perimeter of the meatloaf about half way through the cooking process.  The beans soak up the savory seasonings and tend to get a little crispy on the outside due to the juices.  Very yummy.  I've had some strange looks, but once it was tasted always happy mouths.  =)

I also agree the brown sugar needs to go on top. I know its not the same but I made a few other changes. I used buttery round crackers and mixed in 3/4 pint of homemade pasta sauce.Also I recommend using a disposable pan. The brown sugar baked in is hard to clean.

Recipe was great. Meatloaf was moist and delicious.

To anyone who said the sauce/glaze should be in top.... You should flip the meatloaf out if the pan so it's upside down and the sauce is on top.

I made some changes and it came out amazing! No leftovers whatsoever! I made a sauce out of brown sugar, tomato sauce, salt, pepper, and worchester sauce. I poured a little of the sauce in the meat mixture. Formed the loaf cooked it then poured some of the sauce on top of it and cooked it for a few more minutes :)

YUM! Go to recipe for meatloaf and never disappoints.  Follow the recipe exactly except form a loaf in the center of a 9X13" pan and smear the glaze on top.  Tip the pan and scoop out grease a few times during cooking.

My husband who doesn't really care for meatloaf liked this recipe. The kids and I really enjoyed it as well. I have to agree that the brown sugar and then the grease do make a mess so maybe put something under the pan so it's easier to clean up but other then that this recipe it a keeper for sure in our house!

I really enjoyed this recipe! Instead of crackers I used 1 Cup Of seasoned bread crumbs, 1Tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce in a small bowl and mixed the ketchup brown sugar together. I added 1/2 cup of milk, 2 eggs, 2cloves of garlic with 1/2 to 1 cup of celery to the meat. This was the best meatloaf that I've had!

This was a pretty good recipe. I quite liked it, but the rest of my family thought it was a bit too sweet, and would've liked a more savory glaze to it.

Out of this world delicious! Made it just as called for, but can see that it would be very simple to put in additions such as some bell pepper. This is a new weekly favorite!

The only changes I make is to substitute Ritz crackers for the saltines and I add the brown sugar and ketchup to the top during the last 15-20  minutes of cooking. This recipe is amazing, I found it a couple of years ago and have been making it since then. The kids love it too!

I've used this recipe as a base for meatloaf 50+ times.  I would be able to give it more stars if I didn't have to alter so many little things about it.  It's a great base and allows for a lot of flexibility.  I put the ketchup and brown sugar mixed together on top, used breadcrumbs instead of crackers.  We omit the onion due to allergies, but that's about it.  Will always use this recipe for meatloaf.

The topping was delicious! We did, however, feel that there was an "off" taste to the meatloaf. The only thing I can think of would be either the saltines or the ginger. I typically use ritz crackers or milk soaked oats in my meatloaf & have never used ginger, altho I typically really like it. Weird.

This is a real comfort food at our house.  I use the recipe to make the meatloaf itself but I put a couple of pieces of the stale bread into the bottom of the pan also as another poster suggested and put a nice deep trough into the top so that the glaze can pool in it and drp over the edges as it bakes.  I have been making meatloaf this way for over 45 years and still look forward to it with mashed potatoes and fresh green beans.

I tried this out for my parents and little sister and they LOVED it. I had to make it four days in a row because my little sister craved it. My mom made me make her a deit verson because she really liked the sweetness. The sweetness of the sauce is AMAZING and the meat came out extremely soft and juicy. It was easy to make and delicious

I love this meatloaf recipe!! I made it for my in laws and husband last night and THERE WERE NO LEFTOVERS! lol I did tweak the recipe like some of the other people. I added 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to the ketchup/brown sugar mix. - I used 1/2 cup of milk and 1 egg. - I added 2 cloves of garlic to the meat mixture. Plus I chopped up 1 stalk of celery and a half a carrot REALLY FINE and added it to the meat mixture. I put half of the ketchup brown sugar mixture on the bottom and then 15 minutes before the meatloaf was ready I put the remaining mixture on top. Also I found that an hour wasn't long enough, I found at an hour the middle was still very very pink. So I popped it back in the oven for another half an hour. Finally, I used a cup of seasoned bread crumbs instead of the crackers. The original recipe plus these couple of tweaks made the best meatloaf i've ever had. I am looking forward to our next meatloaf night!! :-)   Thanks Allrecipes.com and everyone for your great ideas.   Happy cooking :)

This recipe was very easy to follow!  If gave me a basic idea of what I should do. However it was a little to plain for me! I read the reviews and added Worcester sauce to the ketchup mix I also used Celery and green bell pepper to the meat mixture I used Italian bread crumbs instead of the cracker. It turned out really good! Me and my husband loved our and will Def. Be making this again!

This was pretty much a perfect meatloaf except for the part about putting the brown sugar and ketchup in the bottom of the pan... Just use it as the topping like most other meatloaf recipes say to do. Otherwise a terrific recipe!!!

I did as most suggested: adjusted milk, and used onion soup mix instead of an onion and to my family's taste, more filler. I couldn't believe how much they loved it! Even the next day, my 8 yr old was asking if we had any more of that "meat stuff with the red on it". Thank you,  tangastar for satisfying my pickiest of eaters!

Great meatloaf with a tasty zing.  FYI...I did tweek it a TINY bit per other reviewers.  I reduced the amount of brown sugar to 1/4 cup and the milk to 1/2 cup, put the ketchup and brown sugar on top of the loaf and 2 slices of bread on the bottom of the pan to soak up the grease.

I tried this as written, with the exception of using seasoned bread crumbs instead of saltines, I also had a little more than 1.5 pounds of ground beef, so I used it all. I thought it was really good with the brown sugar/ketchup on the bottom, one because I've never been a lover of putting ketchup on the top of my meatloaf, and also I thought that it raised up the meatloaf so it wasn't really sitting in the grease, although I did use lean ground beef so it didn't have much grease. Then you have the option of whether to spoon the mixture on the bottom if you want to use it and I could still taste the sweetness even with the sugar/ketchup on the bottom.

I'll definitely be making it again, a great change from standard meatloaf!

I made a few changes like I used butter garlic ritz and season salt instead of a loaf pan I used a  glass 9/13 baking dish so you can pour off the grease.And instead of the onion I used onion soup mix.I also put the ketchup brown sugar mixture on top of the loaf.  My family loves it now

It was good and easy to make. Not very appealing visually. My husband thought the the brown sugar and Ketchup at the bottom of the pan looked gross. I would prefer it on the top so I just dribbled ketchup on the top to make it more appealing. The bottom was super sweet.

I rate this recipe 5 stars because it tastes good AND it is incredibly simple to make.  I liked the different flavor that the brown sugar added.  I followed the directions exactly as is.  I had a glass loaf, so after taking it out of the oven, I got two spatulas and flipped it over so that the juices, sugar, and ketchup could soak down the loaf.  I then left it in the fridge overnight and ate it the next day.  The entire loaf was picked through before I could even serve it for dinner!  Big hit.

Absolutely delicious!
Of course I'm cooking for a family who eat all organic/gluten free/dairy free, so some substitutions had to be made.

I substituted coconut palm sugar for brown, organic ketchup, almond milk insead of milk, and gluten free panko crumbs instead of saltine crackers. 
5/5 and I will definitely make it again.

great recipe! I mixed brown sugar and catsup together and used it as a glaze on top and put a thin base on the bottom. next time will only make 2/3 as much sauce

I love this recipe, but I did change a few things. I like using bread crumbs instead of saltines(same portion) and I mix the brown sugar and ketchup into the entire mix. It gives every bite the same delicious taste! My kids love it and even a father in-law(who doesn't like "sweet" meats fell in love!)This is a total family pleasure and will be one you'll want to make again!

Do NOT put the sugar/ketchup mix on the bottom of the pan...  It ends up swimming in the grease from the hamburger.  Use it as the topper for the meat loaf.  For the hamburger portion itself, cut back on milk to 1/2 cup, 1 egg, 2 garlic cloves, and 3/4 cup seasoned bread crumbs.

I agree the ketchup and brown sugar should be on top.  When I sliced the meatloaf the sauce was on the bottom and all I had was plain cooked meatloaf.

Made this yesterday and it was so yummy.  Per some suggestions I did adjust a few things: 1) 1/2 cup milk and was a great consistency for us, 2) used the leanest type of ground beef available at the market, resulting in less fat drippings, 3) for the glaze I mixed the Ketchup and brown sugar together, and added Worcestershire sauce to taste, 4) spread glaze on top of the loaf before cooking vs. placing on bottom, 5) 3/4 of a small onion chopped well with my chopper, folded into meat mix, 6) used fine plain bread crumbs vs. crackers, 7) used a small glass casserole dish vs. a loaf pan and it cooked perfectly.  So very good and looking forward to making it again soon!  Thank you for this recipes and to everyone sharing their adjustments!

What a delicious and moist meatloaf! Very good flavor, and the brown sugar/ketchup "topping" added the perfect flavor. Everyone loved it, my mother-in-law asked for the recipe to make it herself. I used only 1/2C milk and put the brown sugar/ketchup on top, where it definitely belonged. Not on the bottom. My favorite meatloaf recipe for sure!!

Tasty, I think the next time I will try this I will do it with the leanest beef available. I used 85/15 next time I will try 93/7 to minimize the fat drippings.

Awesome!!!! Made it a couple of times to rave reviews. I do add a layer of ketchup on top about 15 min. until pulling out of oven. Thanks so much for the recipe.

I absolutely loved this recipe! My meatloaf in the past has always been just ok but this was a big hit with my family and myself included. The only thing I did different was used fresh ginger and I added chopped fresh parsley. I will be using this recipe many more times! I''m actually looking forward to my lunch tomorrow since it will be a leftover cold meatloaf sandwich.. Mmm.

I did as others suggested and put bread on the bottom. I used ground chuck so there was no grease. I cut back on the milk and egg also. I doubled the sugar and mixed the ketchup, and ginger with it to make more glaze. I put that on top of the loaf. After the first half hour, I put a few slices of bacon on, with toothpicks, and more glaze. Cooked another half hour then glazed again. Upped the temp to crisp the bacon and oh my goodness it was delicious!

We loved it. I took reviewers suggestions and used half a packet of onion soup mix instead of chopped onion and only half a cup of milk. I too put the "sauce" on top before baking.

Delicious!!
I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers:

1/2 cup dark brown sugar
1 egg
a pack of dry onion soup mix instead of the onion
No ginger
3/4 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of cracker crumbs.
I added a few squirts of Worcestershire Sauce to the ketchup/sugar mix

I added some of the ketchup mix on the bottom of the pan, and on the top of the meatloaf. 

It was SOOO good.  My husband was practically licking his plate!
Thanks for the recipe!

I've tried many meatloafs, including one stuffed with cheese and wrapped in bacon, and this is the one I chose to review. It was fantastic! I think I put too much milk as it wasn't very solid, but the brown sugar and ketchup at the bottom was such a nice change. Will make it again and just try to make it more dense.

This turned out really good but the brown sugar mix was a little much for me. The next time I make it I will be cutting down on the brown sugar.
Update 4-20-2013 & 5-20-2013:
I did make this again with out the brown sugar mix and it turned out great. 
The only change I made was when I made it recently and did a 2:1 ratio of meat. So I did 2 lbs of ground beef to 1 lb of pork and it was so yummy!

With a few small changes, this is absolutely the BEST meat loaf I have ever had! After reading other reviews I put the ketchup and brown sugar on top of the meatloaf, baked it in a 9 by 13 disposable pan, and (accidentally)left out the ginger. I will definitely be making this in the future!

I thought it was great. My husband said it was the best he ever had. I also thought it was odd to put the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom but it turned out fine.  I used the Splenda light brown sugar and used Panko crumbs instead of cracker crumbs.

I tried the recipe with one significant modification, as per the advice of other reviewers.  I put the meatloaf on top of a slices of bread to absorb the grease, and I spooned the brown sugar and ketchup sauce over the top, NOT the bottom.  All that grease going into the sauce did NOT sound like a good idea to me.

I read the reviews about this recipe and because it got so many great reviews by people who did not tweek the recipe, I decided to try it.  I'm so glad the I didn't make any alterations because it is wonderful just the way it is.  It is going to be my recipe of choice for meatloaf from now on.  Thank  you so much for sharing it. It's nice and moist. Some complained about the sauce not being on top. I didn't find that a problem. I just ladeled it on after taking the loaf out or the pan. Great recipe!

Like other users, I added worcestershire sauce to both the meatloaf and sauce as well as garlic powder to the meatloaf. I think next time I will add a dijon mustard to the sauce so it's not SO sweet but has a little tang and spice. Other than that, it is very tasty.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe for meatloaf!  The brown sugar and the ketchup give it just the slightest hint of sweet tangy flavor which is very tasty.  I will try it next with the glaze on top instead of at the bottom.  I have made it with the top and the bottom glazed too.  Any kind of potatoes and a lettuce with corn salad makes this a great dinner.  Kids love it too!

Oh so YUM. Only thing I would do to make it 5 is to put the "glaze" on top not on bottom. This way you don't lose it's yumminess - It bakes up gooey and oh. so. delish. I add a dash of worchester to my glaze. Oh...and minced garlic to the meat mixture. But we use garlic like CRAZY at our house :) Have made this OVER AND OVER AND OVER...... 

EXCELLENT with venison :)

Another keeper! We share recipes for what we cooked for dinner the night before and many were amazed when I told them I used brown sugar and ketchup in my meatloaf. Super easy to make :) Thanks for sharing!!

Made with turkey, brown sugar fell off top so maybe mix with ketchup. Will experiment with a few more spices though.

I thought this meatloaf was very flavorful, even though I did not include the ginger (didn't have any on hand).  I substituted rolled oats for the crackers because I think it's a better choice for anyone who needs extra fiber.  I took the advice of others and put two slices of bread in the bottom of the pan to obsorb the grease and found that this worked well.  I also mixed the ketchup and brown sugar together and poured over the top half way through the baking time.  It was moist without being greasy.  Even my picky husband, who has always turned his nose up at the mere mention of meatloaf, thought it was great.  With the changes I made I would give it 5 stars.

SOOO good!! i put the sauce on top and followed the reviews to use less sugar and add Worcestershire sauce, i still thought it was too sweet so i added a few squirts of low sodium soy sauce. I put a couple pieces of bacon on top of it to help keep the sauce in place as well. i also added a packet of McCormicks Meatloaf seasoning to the beef mix to add more spice flavoring and used less of the milk as said in the reviews. no problems with dryness absolutely yummmy

it was absolutely delicious, but the sauce should go on top because of all the juice that is left by the meatloaf, that way you are able to remove some of that liquid.

Great recipe however do not follow the directions. Do NOT put the brown sugar on the bottom of the pan, mix it in with the meat mixture. Run a spoon or your thumb over the meat once in the pan, then put the ketchup there.

This a family favorite.  I have made this so frequently I now do it by memory and don't even bother measuring anymore (although I did follow it to a tee the first time).  The only thing I do differently now is drain the grease about 1/2 way through the cooking and spread ketchup or bbq sauce over the top.  Sometimes I put a squirt or two of bbq sauce in while mixing it as well.  Either way, its an easy flexible recipe.  The brown sugar is the key ingredient, mix it, put a layer on the bottom, even sprinkle it on top, trust me, you can't use enough of it.

Very good recipe!  I also put the sugar/ketchup mixture on the top -- the idea of it sitting in the fat at the bottom of the pan skeeved me out.  I used bread crumbs instead of crackers because that's what I had.  Also, I put stale bread at the bottom of the pan to absorb some of the fat.  That worked great!

My husband and I loved it... the only thing we would change is before we actually begin eating it, we want to pout out some of the juices (aka fat). But not enough to waste the brown sugar/ketchup goodness. 
Excellent though.

We thought this was really good but a little too sweet for us. We decided that even though my husband and I liked it, we were going to stick to my original recipe that we enjoy more. If I was to make it again I would add less brown sugar and put the sugar and ketchup on top.

this was the BEST meat loaf ever! Bursting with flavor! I made a few of my own adjustments I doubled most of the recipe because I use a cake pan and my family are big eaters lol. I didn't quite double the milk though and I used a lot of saltine crackers. I don't usually measure everything. I just throw it in. Also instead of doubling the eggs I used 3. I added fresh mushrooms and green peppers... Even without my own touch I feel this meatloaf would still be fabulous!! Great recipe, thank you for sharing:)

For some reason, I had been having a craving for meatloaf. I chose this recipe for two reasons. The first reason was the number of great reviews, and the second reason was that it included brown sugar, so it seemed interesting to me. I made this tonight, and it is great! The prep was easy, and I put it in the oven for exactly one hour. I followed the directions and ingredients listed, and I was amazed. The meat was flavorful, juicy, and the addition of the sweet glaze made it all come together. I cook for a family of picky eaters, and they liked it. I'll definitely be using this recipe again!

I first made this meatloaf about 3 years ago. I loved it then and I love it now! I feel guilty for not rating it before now. I follow the recipe with one exception. When I use ground turkey instead of ground beef, I use less milk because of the moisture content in the turkey. I also sneak in a little extra ginger, just because I love it! Thanks for the great recipe...it's a keeper!

Loved this meatloaf! Even those in my family who don't really care for meatloaf liked it.  I make it in a casserole dish with the sauce on top, bread in the bottom to soak up the grease.  Also added extra garlic and some worcestershire to the meat.

Making it into meatballs and baking them on a rack over a baking sheet lets the fat drip out instead of pooling in the bottom. I've tried the bread-in-the-bottom-of-the-pan thing and it still looks gross to me afterwards! The recipe flavour is good, though.

Was really looking forward to this, but for me it was just okay... I followed the suggestions to cut the eggs and milk. I cut the brown sugar in half put the glaze on top - I did like the way the glaze turned out and may use that in the future.  

In the end, it just didn't have that much flavor. 

Leftovers were better, but not up to expectations. Next time I will make the spicy cajun meatloaf recipe from this site again. :)

I made this with 2 lbs of ground turkey, one egg, and added beef broth, Worchestire and garlic. It was fabulous. The brown sugar/ketchup mixture was perfect. Even my picky 3 year old gobbled it up. Will definitely keep on the regular menu.

My daughter just couldnt get enough of this meatloaf!! Nearly perfect. Only thing I would change is that I will be using about 1/2 the sugar. It was a bit too sweet which was probably why she loved it. :)

I made this last night.  My family loved how moist it is.  It does come out a little sweet.  I recommend using 1/4 cup packed brown sugar or less.  I will be making it with chilies next time.

The meatloaf taste was great, but I think next time I'll do as some of the other reviewers did and put the ketchup/brown sugar mixture on the top. It just blended in with the grease on the bottom of the pan, which I didn't like.

One of the best meatloaf recipes I've ever tried. The only thing I did diffrently was I used a 9x13 pan instead of the loaf pan. Cooked up perfectly, and smelled great in the process. Will deffinitly have this again.

This recipe was good. Mine turned out a little bit watery (not as gross as it sounds), but I didn't let it set before I cut it (we were way too hungry) so that is probably why, the next day it was fine. I agree with others that the mustard powder should be cut down, it's pretty spicy, I'll do half the mustard powder next time and see how it tastes.

This has been my families favorite meal since I found the recipe several years ago. When using less than 85% ground beef I put the ketchup/brown sugar on the top but otherwise its best on the bottom. It can also go in the crock pot on low for 5-6 hours with the sugar and ketchup on top. I will never use another meatloaf recipe other than this one!

This meatloaf was absolutely the best I have ever made. My husband is a VERY picky eater and he said to put this on our repeat list. The only changes I made was to use ground turkey, bread crumbs and as others had suggested put the ketchup and brown sugar on top. Thanks for this great recipe.

This was very good and super easy to make.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and put the ketchup/brown sugar combo on top, instead of on the bottom.  My husband liked it but thought I could cut down on the brown sugar a little bit next time, which I will.

This was a good meatloaf. However, I think I would add some ketchup and Worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture just to give it more zing. I did like the "gravy" the brown sugar and ketchup made.

I've never been a fan of meatloaf, but my husband loves it so over the years I have tried many many versions.  This one is by far the best we've had and will become the standard.  My only changes were to use panko bread crumbs instead of the saltine crackers and to spread the brown sugar mixture on top of the loaf instead of the bottom.  Delicious, easy and makes both of us very happy!

This is a flavorful meatloaf!! 
I used 2 lbs of beef, 3 T  worchester sauce, pkg. of onion soup mix, 1/2 c chopped onions , 1/2c milk, & 3 eggs, 1 C seasoned breadcrumbs.  I packed the 1/2c brown sugar onto the top and drizzled alittle(approx 1/4c) mustard and then covered it with 1/2c  catsup.  I feel with the sugars and sauce on top it bakes into the meatloaf and doesn't sit in the juices.   Baked for 1 hour at 350

This is a really good basic meatloaf recipe.  Nearly like Mom's....You could add & subtract from this for your family's tastes with no problem.  I am still on the hunt for my family's perfect meatloaf....but I would make this again, as everyone loved it.

This was awesome, I cant wait to make it again. I used regular ground beef, not lean and  I put extra ketchup and brown sugar on the bottom. Mix it and then taste it so you know if its too sweet. This is a gooooooood recipe!

I never thought I'd be giving a meatloaf recipe five stars!!! I was a bit apprehensive about this because of the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom, but don't worry! The brown sugar melts and bubbles up around the loaf as it's cooking to form a delicious sweet glaze. Just be sure to use super lean ground beef. To make it gluten-free, we tried GF cracker crumbs in place of the saltines, but they didn't absorb much of anything - I'm still new to GF cooking. :) So we ended up adding a bunch of GF bread crumbs, which worked better. Despite those complications, the loaf had a very nice texture and was so surprisingly good! Hubby said he'd definitely have this again. If you have any doubts, just try it! You'll be so happy you did! Thanks for such a great recipe!

I have used this recipe at least 5times. I usually do 2 things differently I put the ketchup/brown sugar mixture on top and I use pinko bread crumbs instead of saltine crackers. One time I substituted the onion for garlic because that's what I had on hand.

I'd give this six if I could.  My family isn't real big on meatloaf but we barely had any left!  I had to use onion soup mix because I didn't have an onion but it was great.  Adding this one to the rotation.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Loved it. Easy to make. Sweet, but not overly sweet. My 3 year old actually ate his entire serving. That's a rarity!

I loved this meatloaf!  A little too sweet for our tastes, and I reduced the brown sugar to 1/3 to begin with.  Next time will reduce even further.  We baked it in a casserole dish as others suggested and put the brown sugar and ketchup on top.  Also, I used bread crumbs because I didn't have saltines.  I thought a bit of ginger would be good with the sweetness of the brown sugar, so will try that next time also.  Thanks for the recipe!

Use 1/4-1/3 of a cup of milk. Ginger was alright, but I'm going back to garlic and celery next time. Glaze on top too.

Delicious! I followed some other commenter's recommendations. Only used half an onion, and added worcestershire to the ketchup. finally, I put the brown sugar top then covered with the ketchup mixture. This was really good!

Loved, loved, loved this recipe. I added a layer of ketchup/mustard mixture over the top of the meatloaf before adding it to the oven. The cracker crumbs made the meatloaf sooo moist. I will definitely try this meatloaf again and again.

This meatloaf recipe is a favorite in our family. I've been making it for a couple years now. I like it because it is sweeter than meatloaf recipes we've grown up eating. I usually don't have ginger on hand, but I do add about 2 teaspoons of mustard to the ketchup/brown sugar mixture to give it a little kick. For a family-friendly meal in under 30 min. I shape the mealloaf into small individual rounds or scoop the meatloaf into a cupcake pan. Makes great leftover sandwiches if you can keep your family from eating it all!

Never made meatloaf before, but MY GOODNESS.  This was perfect as is.  My biggest complaint with ANY meatloaf is that its either too salty or to sweet, but this was a perfect! 
I did something the combinded two peoples ideas:  I lined the bottom of the pan with 2 slices of bread, then I used foil to line the entire pan, then I poked a few holes so the fat would drain through the holes and the bread would absorb, made cleanup easy.  I also think I may add a few slices of bacon on top next time for just more yummy deliciousness!

I did not like this so much, too sweet if I remember right. I enjoy the taste of beef and felt the beef was overpowered by the brown sugar. Also, something about the texture did not appeal to me. Not gross, not good. I ate it, but will not make it again.

I wanted to try a new meatloaf recipe and am glad I did.This is by far the best meatloaf I have ever tasted. I made is exactly as the recipe states and it turned out great! This is a simple recipe you can easily throw together after work with ingredients already in your kitchen - This one is going right into the recipe book and the old meatloaf recipe is going in the trash!

Very good! I did everything pretty much the same except added about a tbsp. of worcestershire sauce to the ketchup mixture and put it on top of the meatloaf. I added some garlic and Italian seasoning to the meatloaf as well along with two pieces of bread on the bottom to soak up any fat or excess moisture.

I hate meatloaf. My husband, on the other hand, LOVES it. This recipe has made him a very happy man, and I have found a meatloaf I can actually eat. 
He RAVES about this meatloaf to everyone who will listen. Thank you!

amazing meatloaf! This is my new go to recipe for meatloaf now. The only change I made to the recipe was to put the ketchup/brown sugar mixture on top and I also omitted the ginger because I didn't have any. This recipe is a must try!!

My husband LOVED this meatloaf..says to never make meatloaf another way. I put the bread under the loaf to soak up the grease too(eventhough I used lean ground beef) and the bread stuck to the loaf. I just cut it off and enjoyed. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this for the first time the other night and I could not be more happy with the results! So easy, yet so delicious! I dislike when people do this, but I did add a little A1 to the meat and to the brown sugar/ketchup layer. I wanted a little kick! Thanks for the recipe!!

Wonderful. Even my husband who hates meatloaf, lived this. I made it as directed with one minor change - I added a little shredded cheese to the meat mixture. It is slightly sweet, but in a good way. I think the ginger is what gives this a flavor edge. The ginger flavor is subtle but really enhances the flavor of the meat and balances out the ketchup flavor. I made this with mashed potatoes; I had made mushroom gravy as well, but didn't really need it as the meatloaf is so juicy. This is simple to make, a definite keeper for the weeknight rotation.

This meatloaf was fantastic.  I put the glaze on both the top and bottom, and made it in four mini loaf pans.  I used beefy onion soup mix and bread crumbs in place of the onion and crackers.  I also cut back on the milk and added worcheshire sauce as others suggested.  Will most certainly make again and again.

Delicious right out of the oven and as leftovers.  I made an extra serving of the ketchup/brown sugar sauce and spread it on a bun with a slice of meatloaf for a yummy sandwich the next day.

My sons do not like me to change my meatloaf recipe. This was a big hit. My youngest (24) ate half the meatloaf!!! I did as others suggested and put the brown sugar & ketchup on top of the meatloaf. I put on half and then near the end of cooking I put on the rest. As another reviewer stated, I do not like cooking meatloaf in a pan as it does sit in the grease. I form the meatloaf and then cook it in my NuWave oven. Absolutely delicious! Thanks so much for sharing.

Best meatloaf I've ever had. I added a packet of Lipton Onion Soup Mix, worcestershire sauce, nutmeg instead of ginger, and italian style panko breadcrumbs instead of saltines. I also baked the meatloaf in a mini loaf pan of 8 loaves and put the glaze on top for the last 15 minutes of bake time. I will never make another meatloaf again. Simply amazing, the glaze makes it! Thanks for sharing!

One big change, I use ground turkey instead of beef and I think it makes a world of difference in this particular meatloaf.  I also use fresh bread crumbs instead of crackers.  So yummy.  Thanks for the recipe!

The ONLY thing I changes was a few dashes of Worchestershire sauce in the ketchup and garlic powder to the meat.  I cooked it at 325 for 1:15 min.  It was delish!  My insanely picky eater had 2 servings.  Will absolutely make again!

Delicious.  I left the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom.  Halved the amount of brown sugar.  Added about a tablespoon Worcestershire sauce and a splash of liquid smoke.  Amazing!

This was superb! I followed others helpful hint of using just 1 egg, 1/2 cup milk and I used panko breadcrumbs instead of crackers. I also added the worcestershire sauce to the glaze, which I brushed on top of the meatloaf. Used a parchment lined low sided pan and placed the meatloaf in the center (did not fill pan). I knew it was a good meatloaf when my husband only said Mmmmmmmmmmm" when he took the first bite. This was perfect! Thanks for sharing!

When I first read this recipe, it sounded kind of dull, but I decided to give it a chance, and now it's the only meat loaf recipe I use. I use half ground turkey breast and half lean ground beef, and I also put the glaze on top. To liven up the turkey base, I add a splash of Worcestershire and smoke flavoring to the meat along with minced garlic and Italian bread crumbs in addition to the regular recipe ingredients. Like many others, I add 1T. Worcestershire to the glaze and another splash of smoke flavoring. This always comes out moist and flavorful!

This was super tasty! I made several meatloaves, cooked them and froze them. When I want one, I thaw if for 24 hours and then cook it until the internal temperature is 165. It still tastes delicious!! I just make a little extra sauce to top if off with...

Makes a very moist and tasty meatloaf.  I used 2 lbs ground chuck and increased the ingredients accordingly; didn't have any ginger (which I'm sure is a tasty addition), so I used 2tsps seasoned salt in place of the table salt and ginger.  I didn't have any saltines so I used bread crumbs instead, and instead of a bread pan I shaped the meat mixture into a loaf, placed it into an 11x7 baking dish and poured the ketchup mixture over the top.  It was good, got good reviews from the family, and was the moistest meatloaf I've ever made.  Will make again.

I've made this exact one a couple times.  Very good and easly.  I combined this recipe and another on here and it is better.  On this one, I left off the crackers, and used Italian bread crumbs (1.5 cups) and folded in 1lb of cubed colby cheese.  Once the loaf was in the pan, I added a couple tbs of wisticher sauce (spread across the top), then a layer of brown suger and then a layer of ketchup.  Turned out great.  Kids said it was the best so far.

I made this for dinner tonight.  This review is mainly for the glaze as this recipe is for a basic meatloaf, I never measure and kind of did my own thing, but it came out great.  I usually just use ketchup on the top, but this time I made the brown sugar/ketchup glaze, but I added a couple of squeezes of sriracha chili sauce to give it a little zip.  I like the sweet/hot combination.  Also added a small squirt to the egg, seasoning mixture.   Turned out great.

This is a great dish! Even better with some garlic added in and the glaze added on top with 15 minutes of cook time remaining.  Excellent as left-overs.

Best meatloaf I've made!  Only thing I changed was to put the brown sugar and ketchup on top of the loaf, rather than the bottom.  Also, I made it in a loaf pan, and though there was a lot of grease, I just poured it out of the pan after it was done, so it only sat in it while actually baking.

This is not the tradition meatloaf recipe, but by far the BEST!! I would suggest putting the brown sugar and ketchup glaze on the top of the loaf, in order to keep the glaze from sticking to the pan.

I read some of the other suggestions for this recipe and I also used 1/4 c of brown sugar with the ketchup for the glaze and put it on the top fifteen minutes before taking it out. For the mix itself, I used 1/4 c. of milk, and 3/4 bread crumbs instead of the crackers as suggested by others. I used 1/2 plain bread crumbs and 1/2 Italian style. I threw in a few drops of Worcestershire sauce as someone else also suggested. The bread on the bottom was also a good recommendation. Very moist and very good. I will continue to make this recipe

I was so disappointed ~ I tried to 'mix it up' by varying from my standard recipe and this was such a let down; extraordinarily bland meatloaf with a candy-like syrupy bottom. My BF sat down to eat before me and promptly brought his plate back with the simple request; "please don't ever make this one again", after tasting it myself, I must agree. :( 
To note,  I made the recipe exactly as stated, it was only after I tasted it that I went back to other reviews to read exactly what others thought was so 5-star about this dish & then I saw custom modifications up the wazoo ... maybe that may have made it better? Regardless, this one is not getting a second chance in my kitchen.

I thought this recipe was really good. It's a keeper for me. I didn't have saltine crackers so I ended up using crushed croutons instead. I also used ground turkey and added garlic. I've never added milk to meatloaf or made the sauce in the bottom of the pan but it tasted great. And after dishing it up I put the extra sauce over the top.

Great recipe.  Following some of the recommendations I put the glaze on top of the meatloaf.  I also sauteed the onions, used 1 lb.ground turkey and 1/2 lb of ground beef and I left out the ginger.  Made great sandwiches the next day.  This will replace my old meatloaf recipe.

Really good. I changed the serving amount to 16. I had no onion on hand but I did have onion powder, I used 2 tsp of that. Also 2 tsp of garlic powder (we love garlic). I used 1 cup ketchup, 1 cup dark brown sugar, 1 cup milk, 2 large eggs, seasoned bread crumbs instead of crackers, and added a few dashes of worcestershire sauce to the meat and sauce. I used the ground ginger but I don't think it was the whole amount called for because I hardly had any left. I cooked it in a pan with slotted grates so I didn't need to worry about grease.
We really enjoyed this, kids included! Will be makes this recipe many times again, thank you for a new spin on our family's meatloaf :)

Great recipe! I did use recommendations from other users. I did the following: I only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar. - I added 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to the ketchup/brown sugar mix. - I used 1/2 cup of milk and 1 egg. (2 eggs might be okay too, mine tried to fall apart when I cut it) - I added 2 cloves of garlic to the meat mixture. Sub. 1 cup breadcrumbs for the saltines. Put the brown sugar/ketchup mix on top of meatloaf. This turned out very delicious and made great left overs!

I too read through reviews and made modifications.  I made the glaze separate from the meatloaf: just over 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup ketchup, 1 Tbsp worcestershire sauce, and a dash of bbq.  I mixed this and set aside to use as a glaze on top of the meatloaf as well as heated up the remainder as a dipping sauce.  I used Lipton's onion soup packet in place of the onion and only 1/4 cup of milk for the meatloaf.  This recipe is soo good!  It smells great and tastes even better!

Loved it!  I made a few changes due to previous reviews and based on my tastes.  I added worcestershire sauce, generous splashes, to both meat and topping.  I used muffin tins with topping on top.  Added 1/4 slice bacon, uncooked, to the top of each muffin before adding sauce and before cooking meat.  I added ground mustard, 2 cloves fresh garlic, both crushed saltines and bread crumbs to meat, probably a little more than recipe calls for but I did have a little more ground meat.  Also, added about a teaspoon of ground mustard to the topping.  Usually I use Martha Stewart Mom's meatloaf recipe but this was a great change that I will definitely make again!  Yes the topping is a little sweet but I like it that way, if you don't then reduce the amt of sugar.

I don't even like meatloaf that much, but this is one of my favorite meals now! It was super easy to make, just leave enough time to cook for more than an hour. I highly suggest trying it for yourself.  P.S. It doesn't really need ginger.

Awesome.  I did put the ketsup/brown sugar on top of the meatlof instead of the bottom.  I agree with the other reviewers in that the mix should be placed on top, so you can drain the grease off.  I also added some minced garlic, black pepper & a dash of worstester sauce to the top mixture.  Delicious recipe!! Will make again & again!

I made this recipe it was easy to make but it didn't have a lot of flavor and the catsup and brown sugar kind of disappeared into the grease.  I wasn't real impressed.

Had a craving for meatloaf but rather than resort to my original recipe (which is actually pretty good) I went looking for a different one. So glad I landed upon this one! I made some of the adjustments others recommended: mixed together the brown sugar and ketchup and added 1 T Worcestershire; replaced the onion with a packet of onion soup mix and the ginger with a tablespoon of minced garlic; replaced the saltine crumbs with panko (just because that's what I had in the house), put the glaze mixture on top instead of on the bottom. In my oven it took exactly 1 hour plus 10 minutes sitting and it was -- and is -- SOOO good!

This was very good - I don't like the grease from meatloaf so I always use a casserole dish with a rack in it so I don't have to drain it during cooking either. I did feel this was a very "wet" meatloaf and added way more crackers crumbs (townhouse) then called for - I will still cut down on the milk a little next time. My husband LOVES meatloaf and he was a big fan. I'll definitely make this again.

Great recipe!  I took the advice of other reviewers and mixed the ketchup and brown sugar and put on top of the meat loaf.  The only other changes I made was to use evaporated milk and buttery round crackers instead of plain milk and saltines and I doubled the recipe and used 1 lb. each of ground pork, lamb, and bison.  Baked until reached 160 degrees internally. Came out fantastic - will use again - Thanks!!!!

This is the best meatloaf ever!  I'm not a fan of meatloaf but this is great.  From my husban'ds view...anything with brown sugar and catsup has to be good.  I only substitued dried minced onion for the chopped onion as I don't like big pieces of onion in my meatloaf.  And it's great as a leftover

This sounds just like the one my mother makes omiting the milk in the meat mixture and we use oats instead of crackers. We always add worstthenever sauce (as my son calls it) a bit of soya sauce and dry mustard to the glaze and it always turns out beautiful!! We make extra sauce as my family loves it warmed a bit on the stove in a pot then places over their potatos and carrots. Thanks for sharing this i will be trying my meat mixture with a bit of milk next time i make it.

I thought the topping was a little too sweet. Next time I'll cut way back on the sugar or omit it all together. The meatloaf itself was very moist.

I am giving this a 4 star--the average of my 3 and hubby's 5.  While it wasn't the best meatloaf I've ever had, it certainly wasn't the worst.  It was too sweet for my taste, although I did like the subtle ginger flavor.  On the other hand, hubby said he loved it, something I have never heard him utter about meatloaf.  But he is a "sweety," so all that sugar was right up his alley!  It was easy to make except for forming the loaf and then trying to pick it up and put it in the pan.  I served it with onion roasted potatoes and salad.  Will make again because hubby likes it.

I love this recipe!!!  The only thing I do is add Italian bread crumbs instead of the saltine crackers.  Very yummy!

My family loves this meatloaf!  I make this pretty close to written with the exception of mixing the ketchup with the brown sugar and putting it on the top rather than the bottom of the meat loaf.  Excellent!

Absolutely awesome! One of the best meatloafs Ive ever tasted! The only thing I do dif, is I bake it free standing to the fat drips off, and I add the sauce 5 mins before I take it out of the oven.

We loved this meatloaf.  I made it in a meatloaf pan and it turned out perfect.  I did make a few changes.  I made the sauce with 1/4 cup brown sugar.  I put the sauce on top of the meatloaf, not underneath.  I also added garlic as some reviewers mentioned.

It's very easy to use too much brown sugar. The less you use, the better it tastes.

I have made this a few times now. The first time I put the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom. Ever since then I have put it on the top. I love the sauce and I don't think you could have too much of it. My kids absolutely love this recipe! 5 stars all the way!

Excellent.  What makes these recipes so exciting is one's own experimentation.  I agree with the glaze idea as superb.  I read others found the meatloaf mushy and somewhat bland for them.  So I used seasoned stuffing mix instead of crumbs or crackers.  This gives it flavor & absorbs excess moisture.  Also I added a can of drained Mexicorn.  That just makes it pretty.  I put the loaf on a baking trivet inside an aluminum foil-lined casserole dish so the grease would drain and cleanup would be a snap.   Great recipe.

Divine! I took the advice of some reviewers: fresh garlic, 1/4c brown sugar, and sauce on top. I omitted the onion. No crackers, so I made my own breadcrumbs, I toasted them in the oven while it was preheating. Added bacon on top. This is so good, I can't wait to eat more.

Update... I've been making this regularly for years now. I use sprouted grain bread for the breadcrumbs (just put 2 slices in the food processor and then throw them on a pan in the oven that is heating up. They are ready when you smell toast). I use onions, got lazy and don't use the garlic, still use 1/4 cup brown sugar. I cover with foil for the first 30 minutes. This is delicious and my family still loves it. Top with bacon for a treat.

This is a good meat loaf recipe, but with a few tweaks as mentioned on other reviews, it becomes a GREAT meat loaf recipe. I added three cloves of chopped garlic to the meat mixture, as well as a little dash of soy sauce. I added dry mustard and Worcestershire sauce to the ketchup mixture, and I did not put sauce on the bottom of a loaf pan - I formed my loaves and placed them on a foil-covered cookie sheet and then spooned the ketchup-brown sugar sauce over the tops for the last 15 minutes of baking. Also, it took more like 1-1/2 hours to bake, not an hour. For all of these reasons, I gave it four stars.

Awesome!  I just made this tonight and I had to review regardless how many others have written reviews.  I thought I had a good recipe however this was excellent.  I did use a meatloaf mix of beef/pork, 1 slice of bread for the crumbs and just 1 egg and still came out soo good.  It was a bit greasy however I drained it while it was cooking.

The best meatloaf hands down.  It always gets rave reviews no matter where I take this.  I make extra glaze and put about a cup into the meat mixture before forming a loaf.  Delish!  You can improvise but don't forget the ginger.  That's the secret.

Very Good.  I did a little less milk and mixed the brown sugar and ketchup and put half on the bottom of the pan and the other half on top of the meat during the last 15 minutes of baking.  My son in law said he wasn't much of a meatloaf person, but he gobbled it right up.  Also, I had my 4 year old grandson help me and he loved getting his hands in the meat to mix it.

I made this tonight and after being a longtime user of this site, I finally registered just so I could write a review! It was soooo good, and my bf agreed! I've never made meatloaf before and actually have only eaten it a few times ever... years ago when my mom would make it for us growing up. So I was a little scared at how it would turn out. Well, I was scared for nothing! It was super simple to make. I veered from the recipe slightly, based on recommendations from other users: I added some garlic powder to the mixture (no measurement, just a couple good shakes of the container), I added some worcestershire (I just poured a bit over the top once it was in the pan before I added the brown sugar), and I put brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom AND top (more on top).   The meatloaf came out so moist and SO flavorful, and the onions added a great texture. Will definitely be making again!!

I had never made meatloaf before and made this for my sister and husband who just had a baby.  They LOVED IT!  And have requested me to make it again once the leftovers were gone. I will admit I tried it (not a meatloaf fan) and thought it was very yummy...not to mention it made the house smell heavenly!  I took the reviewers advice and added the mix to the top.  I didn't add onions or ginger, but that is just because my sister didn't want it.  EXCELLENT taste, simple receipe....definate keeper!

Two syllables. De-lish. My husband went back for seconds. I looked forward to having it for lunch the next day. Based on reviewers feedback I changed only three things. - I used the glaze on the top of the meatloaf. - I used only 1/2 cup milk. - I used ground turkey instead of ground beef.  This recipe will be a regular dinner rotation at our house.

By far my favorite meat loaf...and my family agrees. We line the bottom of the pan with bread slices to soak up the grease...and we put the brown sugar/ketchup mixture over the top while baking. I also omit the ginger. It's fabulous! We make it regularly!

SO YUM!  Served for my family (7 people) + extended family (4) and had several "this is the BEST meatloaf I've ever had".  I made a full 2 pounds worth of meat and adjusted the other ingredients accordingly.  Due to the volume I had to serve in an 8x8 square pan, but the cooking time was only extended by about 10 minutes.    As per a lot of the recommendations, I inverted the brown sugar/ketchup mix and put it on top instead of on the bottom.  This will definitely be going into rotation at our house!

This is outstanding!  The sauce created from the brown sugar and ketchup is wonderful.  I didn't have a loaf pan so I just used a square one and upped the brown sugar so I could cover the bottom of it sufficiently.  Everyone loved it and my four year old niece, who is not a a big eater, ate a full portion of it.

I make this all the time. It is delicious! The mix of the savory meat with the sweet brown sugar sauce is a hit in this house. It's a staple. My only suggestion is to saute the onions before mixing with the ground meat and other ingredients.

Loved this recipe. I did use bread crumbs as that was all I had on hand. I also added a dash of garlic powder. I used half the brown sugar and ketchup mixture on top and the other half on top. If you do not use lean meat this will produce a lot of grease, just drain it off. Great recipe, thanks!

I would give this 5 stars, but I feel that it needs a little bit of tweaking to be perfect.  This is my go-to meatloaf recipe, but I always add chopped green pepper, minced garlic and some Italian seasoning blend.  I also never measure out the salt and pepper, but rather just eyeball what I consider to be the right amount.  Like others, I put the topping/sauce on top of the meatloaf.  I personally like the sweetness, so I would not cut back on the sugar.  I think if your loaf is well seasoned and salted, the sauce does not come across as overly sweet.

Love it!! I always make in a cupcake pan, so that way the servings are personalized. I also followed H2OSMILES tip and mixed worcestershire in with the ketchup and brown sugar and put that on top of the meatcakes and bake as directed!

Very flavorful meatloaf!  Next time I make this recipe, I think I will follow the advice of other reviewers and put the brown sugar/ketchup sauce on top of the meatloaf instead of the bottom.  I also think that I will saute the onion or use dried onions because some of the onions were still a little hard even after baking.  Otherwise it's an excellent recipe and makes great leftovers!

Gotta tell ya, I made the adjustments that many said. cut the milk, added garlic, bread on the bottom to soak up the fat, the meat was ok.  but everyone in my family scrapped off the ketchup/brown sugar sauce.. waaay to sweet... recipe just ok.

I followed H20Smiles' modifications, as they seemed to be widely used.  Still, my family thought the meatloaf was a bit bland.  The next time, I kept the following modifications: used only one egg and 1/2 c milk.  However, I doubled the ginger and pepper, and almost doubled the salt.  Also, I did not decrease the brown sugar, and to the ketchup topping, I added 2T of Worchestershire instead of 1T.  My family liked the recipe a lot more this way.

I too followed a lot of the others, in that I didn't use a loaf dish, and I put the sauce on top.  I also used 1 tsp onion powder and not the diced onion as that's my wife's kryptonite.  Perfecto!  Lot's o meatloaf recipes out there, we like this one a lot.

It was really good! My husband loved it. Mine came out a little watery even though I only used a 1/2 cup of milk like the reviewers mentioned. Also, didn't have ginger so I just omitted that..still came out sooo good. Would make more sauce next time for sure...used Worcestershire in the meat and sauce mixture and it came out really good :) Only gave it four stars for the wateriness.

A little bit too sweet for my taste...but it was still savory. Next time I'll use a lesser fat content beef. I found that the regular ground beef I buy apparently made the meatloaf a bit "too greasy."

My husband LOVES this recipe.  It's a very good, slightly sweet basic meatloaf recipe.  While I alter most of the recipes on here slightly to suit my needs, I followed this one to a 't' and it turned out great.

I follow recipe exactly, except I pour 2/3 sauce into meatloaf mixture and mix. Then after 1 hour of baking I drain grease , then add rest of sauce as a glaze.....cooking for 10 more min. This is a family favorite!

The best meatloaf I've ever eaten (including Grandma's)! I used two pounds ground beef (because I had 2 one pound packages) and didn't adjust the amounts of the rest of the ingredients after reviewing others comments. I used onion soup mix instead of the onion and put it in a 8x6 casserole dish. I mixed the glaze adding Worcestershire and put it on top. It caramelized perfectly in about 1 hour 15 minutes. (Next time I may use a little less sugar.) So good!

This one is something that I never used to eat when I was growing up. My boyfriend loves meatloaf and so I wanted to try finding one that we could both enjoy and this is definitely a hit in our house! There's never any left! :-)

This drew rave reviews from not only myself, but the wife and a super picky 2 1/2 year old! Its really good! I used a 9X9 pan instead of a loaf pan-and the ketchup topping is just enough! Excellent recipe and will continue to make again and again! May fudge the sauce here and there-ie make it hotter or maybe add some different things...:) LOVE IT AS IS THOUGH!

"YUM" - I used muffin tins since I was short on time (took 30 mins. in the oven instead of an hour!), and I halved the BS (brown sugar, that is). ;) Paired with homemade mashed potatoes and some green beans, husband said "You outdid yourself." The best part was, this meal was more simple to make than most!

Loved it. Followed recipe pretty closely with a few exceptions: added Worcestershire sauce to ketchup/brown sugar glaze, only used 1/4 c. brown sugar, 1/2 c. milk and used regular saltine cracker crumbs. I was really nervous to use the ginger in this recipe but it was great. To help some on the grease at the bottom of the pan- I have bought  pans specifically for meatloaf. The pans each come as a set- where the top pan has holes in it and the bottom pan collects the grease. My meatloaf has always come out great. Thanks for the recipe.

My family loves this meatloaf and I've made it several times.  The ginger gives it a wonderful flavor.  The one change I recommend is to sprinkle the brown sugar on top of the meatloaf, over the ketchup.  It makes a very nice topping.  Delicious!

I made this a while back and I must say...... this is some good meatloaf!!!  I didn't leave it as is though, I added diced tomatos, chopped celery, chopped bell pepper to the mix.  I also amped it up a little with some finely chopped garlic and some celery salt. Like everyone else, I added the brown sugar and the ketchup to the top and it was FABULOUS!  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good meatloaf.  I altered the spices to the meat per my family's tastes.  As other reviewers suggested I cut down on the milk in the meat alittle and added the sauce to the top prior to cooking.  I added a splash of worcestershire to the meat mix and the sauce.  I also used panko bread crumbs instead of saltines.  Next time I will double the sauce - it is that good!  Will make again.  Thanks!

In no way does this remind me of the meatloaf my mother used to cook, which is a VERY good thing!  My picky 10 year old always wants at least seconds.  I actually leave out the ketchup (cause I don't like it) and the rest of the family just adds it when it's served.  This is a must try.

These were simply wonderful!  I used lean ground turkey to cut the fat.  I also mixed the brown sugar right into the meatloaf mixture, then spread the ketchup on top.  It gave the entire loaf a wonderfully sweet flavor that I think would have been missing had the brown sugar just been on the bottom.  Awesome recipe!

WOW!!! This was my main dish...and I absolutely loved it. I had visitors who were only here to say "Hello", and could not help themselves and they had more than one helping. Even my children ate it, and they really do not eat meat. I slow cooked it for 3 hours and added brown sugar to the meat as well as the pan, DELICIOUS!!! This is a permanent Christmas tradition for our family now.

Good meat loaf recipe but I did as the others and put the brown sugar and ketchup mixture on the top rather than the bottom.

Great recipe, but I agree with a lot of the other reviews in tweaking it a bit.  I used 1/4 cup ketchup and 1/4 barbeque sauce to suit my family's tastes, and I would probably cut back on the salt a bit.  Still, this is the best recipe for meatloaf I've tried yet!

I loved it! Super easy to make and tasted great. I didn't have saltine crackers so I used 3 slices of bread brocken into pieces. Also used 1/4 c. brown sugar  instead of the 1/2 c. and put the glaze on top. Totally forgot to put the milk in but I didn't notice in the end result. Cooked a little longer also. Easy dinner even for a busy weeknight!

I wish you could give 4.5 stars.  I really liked the meatloaf. However, I thought the ketchup on top was too sweet.  My son thought this was perfect and I couldn't keep him out of it.

The Ketchup and sugar have to go on top or it just doesn't work as well, but otherwise it is a very good recipe!

this was soooo good! i would have given it 4.5 stars if i could. i did like the others suggested and added 2 teaspoons of worcestershire sauce. the taste was perfect! the meat was delish, the ONLY thing i didnt like was that there wasnt enough sauce. my husband said to put this on the menu so next time i make it ill double the brown sugar and katchup (and worcestershire sauce). thanks for a really great recipe, im sure this will be one that my own kids will ask for when they are all grown up :)

Best meatloaf I ever had. I did not use the ground ginger because I didn't have any and substituted dry onion soup mix for the chopped onion. There wasn't any leftovers, but my husband asked if there was. I liked the sauce on the bottom because it mixed with the meat juices and made an excellent sauce to add over top of the meatloaf.

My ma-in-law does this without the ginger. I suggest leaving out the sugar (replace the ketchup with home made if you have time - store bought is at least a third sugar), adding worcestershire, quadrupling the amount of pepper, doubling the onion, and you don't need that much milk - none if you use not-so lean beef. As long as the beef you are using comes from a half-way tasty cow, you will find that this is delicious. I give it one star because my mother-in-law likes it, but it baffles me. The bottom line is that if your meatloaf is any good, that much sugar will ruin it. If it isn't, you don't want it anyway.

We couldn't stop eating this, the whole meatloaf was gone in one family meal.  Usually we have a few slices left over for sandwiches the next day but not in this case.

This was very good. I made it just as written, except that I had to add a couple of extra crumbled crackers because I used skim milk and the mixture was a bit too loose. I liked putting the "sauce" on the bottom of the pan. It usually burns if I put it on the top of the loaf before baking but this did not. I used my turkey baster to remove the excess fat before I turned the cooked loaf out onto the serving plate. Delicious hot and also cold in sandwiches. Definitely a keeper and we will be making it again.

My meatloaf kind of fell apart...may have been something I missed. I love onions but also agree with the previous reviewer that a whole onion is too much. I like the sauce added to it.

If I can make a meatloaf and have the "I don't like meat" husband wanting seconds and thirds -- it's a winner. Absolutely delicious! I know some folks didn't enjoy the meatloaf roasting in it's own juices, but when the juices mix with the ketchup and brown sugar - it is absolutely amazing on top of the meatloaf and mashed potatoes! Yum!  The only changes I made -- I added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce and I sauteed 3 cloves of garlic with the onion before adding to the meat mixture. Absolutely fabulous!

Easy to make and really yummy.  i put in half of a cauliflower (puree)in with the ground beef and 1/2 cup of milk.  there were lots of liquids at the end so next time i might not put in the milk.  it was really moist.  great way to hid some veggies for my family

I loved this meat loaf recipe! Simple to follow and do. As recommended in the reviews below I too reduced the amount of milk to 1/2 cup, only used 1/4 cup brown sugar (next time I will use a little more); and added worcestershire sauce 1 T. In addition, I whisked together the ketchup, brown sugar and worcestershire sauce to make a glaze and poured it on top of the meatloaf prior to cooking. I also drained the grease about every 15 minutes. This meat loaf was juicy and the sweet top made the perfect combination. THANKS!

Very good! Made a sm. (I 1/2'd the recipe) meatloaf for my fiance & I last night. I've tried a few "mediocre" meatloaf recipes lately, and never liked any of them enuf to justify saving the leftovers. B/c of this, I decided to make exactly what we'd eat in one sitting rather than having to toss what was left (assuming this recipe would also not be to our liking). Boy was I wrong!!!! I SOOOO wish I had leftovers (darn!). My fiance thought this was so-so, but he prefers savory meatloaves, not sweet ones. I thought this was perfect, but only b/c of the adjustments I made. I added 1 lg. garlic clove to my meat mix. & 1/2 T W sauce (remember, I 1/2'd the recipe) / 1/4 t dry mustard to my glaze for a little zip. I also ended up mix. all of my glaze ing. 2gether as opposed to placing both in the bottom of my baking dish (which, btw, I shaped my loaf & then placed it in a greased, 9x13-inch baking dish instead of in a loaf pan). I used my WS digital thermometer to gague the doneness of my meat (didn't set the clock; just cooked to an internal temp. of 160 deg. F). Note: you will eliminate most of the greasiness by doing this AND using the leanest meat possible. Served w/ garlic mashed potatoes, cauliflower/broccoli & dinner rolls, this was a very tasty AND filling meal. My only other ch. for nxt. time (and there WILL BE a nxt. time!) will be to add a bit of chopped celery (I love the stuff!) if I have it on hand. Thx. for sharing your AWESOME recipe, tangastar :)

Took others advice and reduced the amount of milk as well as brown sugar and put the glaze on top instead of in the bottom of the pan.  It was good, but seemed a little bland.  It needed something with more flavor...I think I will try the onion soup mix next time and see if that does it.

Changed to five stars from four after I discovered the secret: Fry or caramelize your onions! It makes all the difference in the world. Otherwise, they tend to be rather crunchy and unappealing. After being fried and then put in with the mix, it's much better! This is now my favorite meatloaf!

Ok so I like to take pride in my various meatloaf concoctions....I can use just about anything kicking around and make it tasty. But I had time to try someone elses recipie so I gave this one a try. My husband said at the end of the meal that he has to say " that is the best meatloaf you have ever made" I used bread crumbs instead of saltines and like some of the other reviews I prefer my meatloaf to bake on a cookie sheet so that the edges are nice an crispy and not sitting on the grease. I put the glaze on top and it was awesome!!!!

I followed the recipe almost as written except I added a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce and I used 1 lb of lean ground beef and one pound of ground turkey. I also added an extra 1/2 cup of oatmeal in addition to the crushed crackers. After it cooled for 20 minutes I flipped it out of the pan so the bottom was now the "top". It had a nice glaze and was very good.

Oh my goodness!  Knock your socks off good!!  The meat was tender and moist, the glaze was yummy and sweet.  This is my new meatloaf recipe.  I added a bit of worcestershire to the hamburger and glaze, cut back on the milk a tad, and used garlic instead of ginger because I didn't have any.  My husband loved the ketchup glaze on the top, so that's how I'll do it from now on.  Mmmm Mmm, good!

I gave this a 5, even though I made some changes. Instead of saltines, I used one sleeve buttery crackers (Ritz). Also, I put bread on the bottom of the loaf pan to absorb most of the grease. I also changed the spices to fit my family's taste. Instead of putting the brown sugar mixture on the bottom, I put it on the top and minimized the amount of liquid to keep it a thick paste to spread. It oozed wonderfully during cooking without losing it to the bottom of the pan.   Overall, this is a fantastic starter recipe. The best I've found that makes a nice, sturdy meatloaf that can be used for meatloaf sandwiches the next day.

My husband liked it. I only had 1/4 cup of ketchup so I used 1/4 cup of smoked hickory BBQ sauce. I took the recommendation of other reviewers and placed 1/3 sauce on the bottom of a casserole dish. After 30 min. I added the remaining 2/3 to the top.  I also used 1 lb. of Morning Star Farms Vegetarian Ground Beef. I didn't have to drain any juices because the Veg. ground beef tends to be a bit dry. The dish came out with amazing flavor and a semi moist texture. next time, i'll probably use egg whites and a smaller onion. If anyone uses the MSF Veg. Ground Beef, note the recipe calls for 1.25 lbs but the 1 lb of MSF Veg. Ground Beef worked perfectly fine.

My children love this meatloaf. We never have leftovers. I increase the amount of meat to 2 lbs. ground chuck, substitute 1 cup oatmeal for the bread crumbs, add a dash of Worcester sauce, and 1/4 cup grated cheddar cheese. I divide the meat in half and bake in 2 loaf pans.

Served with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans

this is exactly how I remember the way meatloaf is supposed to taste.  I didn't alter anything except the time for cooking.  I had to cook it an additional half hour.

Yum! Only changes I made were (based on some of the most popular reviews) to mix the ketchup and brown sugar and pour as a glaze on top near the end of cooking time, add a bit of Worcestershire sauce to the glaze and the meatloaf, and add about fresh minced garlic to the meat. Will definitely use this recipe again!

I've made a similar recipe for meatloaf for years.  I love the idea of the ginger!  I wish I could say that was my idea.  The topping is to-die-for.

This tastes great made exactly as written.  I have added oatmeal (1/4 cup) in place of 1/4 cup of crumbs and it was still delicious.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Made it just its listing and this meat loaf is to die for.  Its like eating candy meat, maybe two things that shouldn't be combined for health reasons, but wow when they are put together they taste great.

This meatloaf rocks the house! It is very easy to make, and even though I was unsure about some of the steps (ketchup on top of brown sugar, really???), I followed it to a T and it came out AWESOME. My husband even made it for us for dinner and he managed to make it perfectly (and that is saying something!). This will remain a family favorite for us. Thanks tangastar!!!

I really liked this.  I pressed it into a bread pan, but next time I think I will make it a log instead.  Then the caramelization can get all over the whole thing and not just the bottom (top-when you flip it over).  I also would decrease the sugar just a bit.  It was pretty sweet.

This is the only way I will eat meatloaf. Instead of putting the sauce into the bottom, I mix half of the sauce into the meatloaf before I shape it into the pan, then top the meatloaf with rest. Its delicious!

I thought this was OK. I like the Rempel Family Meatloaf on this site better. The problem is the ginger. I just didnt care for that flavor in the meat at all, and it kept me burping all night.  Not good. anyway, would be great without the ginger, but that's just my opinion.

This is basic recipe my family has used and loved for years.  I have good news to add - it microwaves.  I use a microwave safe bundt pan - so there's no raw center.  I also say sauce on top, because there is always liquid grease to pour out at the end.  I've always used bread, but will use crackers tonight for fun change.

This recipe has been in my recipe box since 2004, just waiting for me to get around to trying it. Well--I did--and now I wish I'd gotten to it sooner! Hands down the best meatloaf I've ever eaten! I made a few changes but mostly as to method. I made mine into a loaf shape by hand and placed it on a roaster pan (the kind with holes so the grease drips through and another pan attached to it catches the grease up) and covered it with the ketchup mix, making sure to get all exposed areas ketchupy. The only other thing I did differently was to microwave my diced onions for about 2 minutes prior to mixing them in because I absolutely *loathe* crunchy onions. I did not use all of the milk either--maybe used a half-cup total before my mixture was really too damp to risk more liquid (but then my onions were juicy from the microwaving). All in all this produced a tender, flavorful, aesthetically appealing meatloaf that held together REALLY well! The husband had 6 slices and I had 1 but that was an accomplishment to be sure :)

This was excellent. My husband who refuses meat loaf based on childhood memories of a dry, tasteless meal loved it and asked for more. I'm making it again tomorrow. Only difference to recipe is I put the glaze on top and added Worcestershire sauce as recommended by another reviewer.

This is the best meatloaf I've ever had! I did alter it a bit. I put the glaze on top, which I made with Sweet Baby Rays barbeque sauce, a little ketchup, black pepper, and about 1/4 cup of brown sugar. I also put some onion powder and black pepper on the top before I added the glaze.I did cut back on the milk a little. I just didn't think it needed that much. And, I added crushed garlic to the meatloaf mix. Wow! What a great meal! Very easy to put together.

don't worry about the ginger...it is a subtle undertone yet makes such a difference! i added a TBSP. of worsterchire sauce and a huge heap of crushed garlic! i inverted it on a platter before serving it so that the thick, glaze-like sauce would drip down the sides of rather than puddel underneath it! a new family favorite!

This recipe is so close to my mother's meatloaf. I have a few suggestions. 1.)Use only 1 lb. ground beef and substitute ground turkey for the rest. This will make the meatloaf less greasy. 2.)Definitely put the ketchup mixture on TOP of the meatloaf. 3.)I like the additional of 1 shredded carrot to the ingredients. 4.)I do not add any milk and use 2 eggs. The meat is juicy enough. 5.)I also like rolled oats as opposed to crackers or breadcrumbs.

This turned out really well, and my boyfriend loved it!  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef, but I followed several reviewers' advice and substituted seasoned breadcrumbs for the crumbled saltine crackers.  I also split up the brown-sugar/ketchup glaze and placed half on the bottom of the pan, and then added the other half during the last 15 minutes of baking, which worked really well.  I also tossed in 2 chopped stalks of celery which gave a nice crunch to the texture.  Overall, I will definitely make this again...quite a hit.

This is a very sweet recipe, I used 1/3 cup of the brown sugar and it was way way way too sweet.  I think it's a good base recipe to change up to your liking but will take a few tries to get it to your tastebuds I imagine.  Next time I would reduce the brown sugar a lot, maybe use 1/5 cup and see if that will be better.

Very good meatloaf. My husband who doesn't care for "baked hamburger" even loved it.  Will definitely make this again.

Meatloaf was really good. I made it exactly as the recipe called for. The sauce on the bottom was great when dumped on top. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because personally I don't like meat that's this sweet. I prefer the savory types.

WOW----- you gave me faith in meatloaf again!  Love this!  I followed the recipe to the T except I did NOT have GINGER. I sprinkled in some nutmeg and it was fine.  I read the one review that mentioned maybe putting the brown sugar/ketchup layer on top so it seeps down and that wouldn't be a bad idea, but I spooned out some of the juices and drizzled them on top just before serving!  Very sweet, what a treat!    Thanks for sharing!

This was a very moist and tasty meatloaf! I made it in 13x19 baking pan, and put the ketchup glaze on top of the meatloaf instead of the bottom. It was so yummy! My family really liked it. I made one small change to the glaze as well; I added about 1/2 tsp. of worchestire sauce. This addition made the meatloaf glaze taste wonderful! Thanks for a yummy recipe!

Always a favorite for last minute dinner ideas. I actually didn't have crackers, so I used Italian Bread Crumbs, and it tasted great.  Quick and easy how can you go wrong?

Absolutely delicious! The sweet taste of the brown sugar + the lovely taste of onion makes this an amazing meal I'm going to make very often. Following the advice of other members, I used only 1/4 cup of brown sugar, mixed it with the ketchup, mix on top of the loaf - it caramelized slightly and just made for an awesome glaze. I used a large onion instead of a small (only had large ones), 1/2 cup milk instead of 3/4, chopped 2 garlic cloves, and bread crumbs instead of the saltines (seasoned bread crumbs since, again, that's all I had on hand). I served this with mashed potatoes and wow did we stuff our faces in delight!

Fantastic! Thanks so much for sharing this great recipe! I did use less brown sugar and added a bit of prepared mustard to the sauce (which I put on top). I also did not have any ginger on hand but used minced garlic instead and it was awesome...we are garlic lovers around here! My boyfriend loved it and even ate some for lunch the next day....will make again for sure...probably this week!

This was the best meatloaf recipe I've ever made and was even better the next day as a meatloaf sandwich! I did make a few tweaks, the biggest of which was that I used ground buffalo instead of beef. Another reviewer gave the helpful hint of putting 2 slices of bread in the bottom of the pan to absorb grease - what a simple yet brilliant idea! As others suggested, I also mixed the brown sugar and ketchup together, added worchestire sauce and put the glaze on the top, rather than the bottom.  I also used onion soup mix, rather than fresh onion, and italian seasoned bread crumbs, rather than crackers.  Delicious!

Very good. I followed others advice and put the ketchup and brown sugar on top and used less of the brown sugar. I also used onion soup mix. Turned out excellent, everyone loved it and had seconds. I will make this again.

Great recipe.  I made two: one with super low fat turkey breast and one with Recipe Crumbles vegetarian ground beef substitute.  The turkey one suffered from anemic coloring, but that was not the recipe's fault and it tasted delicious.  With the veg one, I bet I could have served it to the staunchest, most die-hard meat eater and they would not have know the difference.  

This will be a staple.  Cold leftovers in sandwiches the next day were divine.

This meatloaf is amazing!  I made it early this morning to free up the oven for a full day of Christmas baking.  It was supposed to be tonight's dinner.  However, it's gone and it's only 12:15.  At least now that it's gone, I can keep everybody out of the kitchen. It is full of flavor and just the right consistency for slicing.  Leftovers would be perfect for sandwiches, if there were any leftovers. I had to use oats because we were out of saltines, and I put the ketchup and brown sugar on the top and sides, as I doubled the recipe and had to cook it in a roasting pan. I used the juices to make a mushroom gravy, poured it over the slices and back in the oven for a few minutes.  I'll use this recipe a lot, but from now on wait until closer to dinner.

This was really very good. Just the right amount of sweetness and the about the moistest meatloaf I've ever had.  I had to make one slight modification due to not having the right ingredients (instead of 3/4 cup crushed saltines I used 1/4 italian style breadcrumbs I had in the cupboard and I crushed up 2/3 cup Club crackers to make up the rest) and I took another user's recommendation and layered the bottom of the pan with half the brown sugar and ketchup and used the other half on top of the meatloaf and it turned out perfect.  My husband has always loved meatloaf and couldn't stop talking about how good this one was.  I will be making it again and again.

I hardly ever make meatloaf as it's not a big favorite for my family or as I found out last night it was MY meatloaf that wasn't such a winner.  I made this exactly as per recipe (only with the brown sugar and ketchup on top.  Everyone one was VERY happy with it except our dog Boo... sadly there was none left for him! Delicious!

This came out very dry. Followed the directions, with the only change being the Saltines. I didn't have any so had to use breadcrumbs. I don't think this would make a drastic difference in the outcome. Did not have a brown sugar taste, in fact there was an overpowring flavor of the ketchup on the bottom of the pan. I feel my meatloaf is better. sorry.

I used pork instead of beef as that is what I had on hand but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  It was perfect, the best recipe I have ever used for meatloaf.  I lined my meatloaf pan with parchment paper before adding all the ingredients and then just waited for it to cool a bit before inverting it carefully onto a platter so the sauce was on top, this worked great.  I didn't like the idea of adding the sauce ingredients to the top of the meatloaf as some suggested because with the meatloaf cooking uncovered I felt that maybe the sugar topping would start to burn before the meatloaf was cooked. The texture of the finished meatloaf was really good, it was solid enough that you could slice thinly if desired without being too dense, definitely we'll be using this again, thanks for sharing the recipe.

Yummo ! :-)  I have been making this meatloaf for years.  But 2 things I do differently. 1, is that I carmelize the onions in a fry pan and then add them to the meatloaf mixture...more flavor. :-) And 2, (I learned this from Paula Dean from the Food Network)...put 2 to 3 slices of bread in the bottom of the pan to soak up the grease as it is cooking.  And then just throw away the grease soaked bread after it is done cooking. Happy Eating ! :-)

I followed the recipe very closely.  I did add two cloves of minced garlic, used flavored breadcrumbs instead of crackers, and I only needed 1/2 cup of milk.  I used 1/8 cup sugar and a few dashes of worcestershire to the ketchup and put it on top instead of the bottom.  It took a tad bit longer to cook, but this is one amazing meatloaf.  My whole family really enjoyed it.  I'm sure I'll make it again sometime.

I do agree with another poster, I think the brown sugar and ketchup mixture should be on top.

Really, really good!  I love the sweet flavor of the glaze and it looks appetizing too. Easy, fast, stays together well (my meatloaf usually ends up being more like a "meat pile" on the plate.  Great leftover, too, IF you have any left.

I was looking for a cheap way to cook my ground beef and stumbled upon this recipe.  I never liked meat-loaf (I think it's the name - loaf of meat.) but this one is amazing!  I also get really annoyed at recipe alterations, but because I didn't have saltines, I stumbled onto something amazing!  I substituted 1/2 package of dry Stove-top dressing mix as it was available.  It worked great and tasted awesome.

This is by far my favorite meatloaf! I have tried a bread crumbs and saltines crushed in it, but my favorite is crushed Ritz crackers.
Thank you for sharing this recipe! I love it!

I really liked the taste of this meatloaf due to the sweet taste that the brown sugar gave it.  I did decrease the milk to a 1/2 a cup and added a dash of Tamari sauce as others had suggested.  The down side to this recipe is that I did end up pouring off at least 1/2 a cup of drippings and it actually looked terrible when i pulled it out of the oven.  I actually thought I had done something wrong and that it would taste horrible but I figured I would give it a try anyway and it actually had a really good taste!

I doubled this recipe making a full size meatloaf and 8 mini meatloafs.  All turned out great.  Per other recomendations I put brown sugar and ketchup on top.  I added 4 cloves of garlic.  I don't cook with salt unless it's bread so used Mrs. Dash instead of salt.  It turned out great.

Excellent twist on an old favorite.  I doubled the recipe and froze another meatloaf for a later meal.

This recipe is great as is, that being said I did add a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce to the brown sugar and ketchup for the glaze which I added to the top of the loaf about 20 minutes before it was done. I did add some garlic into the meat mixture. I love this recipe. It has a tangy sweetness that goes great with mashed potatoes and vegetables. Everyone will love this recipe, my family certainly did!

I follow this recipe almost exactly. I do double the sauce. I mix the ketchup and brown sugar together. (That just makes more sense to me) I put less than half on the bottom of the pan and the rest on top of the meat. I do add a splash or 2 of Worcestershire to the glaze. I also cut back on the milk...I only add like 1/2 a cup of milk. I also omit the salt. I think the saltine crackers provide enough salt. I made this recipe for the second time tonight and my husband said, "Aren't you glad you found this recipe" And my son said, "I wish this stuff (glaze) was all over the sides." The glaze is sweet, so if you don't prefer the sweet taste you could cut back on the brown sugar. This is a keeper for us. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Best Meatloaf Recipe I have ever used!

My Modifications: 

-Used ground beef rather than sirloin 
-Add 1/2 medium green bell pepper finely chopped
-Use Oatmeal in place of Bread Crumbs/Crackers
-Use only 1/4 ketchup and brown sugar (divide this - 1/2 on the bottom and 1/2 on the top of the meatloaf)
-Bake 45 mins on 350 degrees, remove from oven, dump excess juices, and bake another 15 mins.

I have made this recipe probably 15 times, and it is amazing!I have gotten so many compliments, and one of my friends doesn't even like meatloaf and has actually requested this a second time after trying it the 1st time I cooked for her!

I accidentally left out the ginger.  Next time I make it, I'll be sure to put that in to get the full flavor of the recipe.  I liked having the brown sugar and ketchup on bottom.  It seemed to cook up through the meatloaf and make it moist.  I did have to cook this much longer than the recipe stated.  But, Good flavor!

WOW! This was sooo good. I followed the recipe exactly. The ginger added a nice flavor. My husband told me to throw out the old meatloaf recipe and use this one from now on (the old one was his mothers)!

Delicious.  I have made this a number of times already.  My kids love it. Instead of putting the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom, I mix half of it into the meat mixture and them put the other half on top of the meat to give it a nice glaze.

This is an excellent recipe! I followed the directions with the exception of a few changes. I used top sirloin ground beef added about a tbsp of minced garlic and used italian style bread crumbs instead of saltines. I also mixed the brown sugar (1/2 cup) and kethup together and spooned over the top of the meatloaf prior to baking. Fantastic!! You'll want to place loaf pan on a baking sheet for the juices to overflow onto. I drained the loaf pan about a third of the way through baking to cut down on fat. Everyone loved this recipe!!

I did not make the meatloaf according to the recipe fully because I did not have two ingredients on hand at the time. I made it without ginger & used bread crumbs instead of saltine crackers. I accidentally mixed the brown sugar & ketchup in the mix as well. This recipe was still yummy. My husband enjoyed it even more. Next time I will not miss a beat when preparing it...lol.

I made this for my husband and I last night, and it was wondeful.  It has replaced my last recipe for meatloaf.  I combined the two recipes however, and now I use this recipe and put equal amounts to a 'muffin tin' that has little loaf shaped containers.  It takes only 20-25 minutes to cook!!!

My husband just told me "I think this might be the best meatloaf I've ever eaten."  It is really yummy.  I did need to decrease the milk to 1/2 c.  I also put bread slices on the bottom & the sauce on the top.  The ginger tastes great in it! Never would have thought to do that! Thanks!

This was a great recipe and the suggestions of 1/4 c brown sugar with 1T Worcestershire sauce made a yummy glaze.  We will be making this again.

I really liked the brown sugar ketchup on the top.  I didn't like the ginger in it at all.  I really don't like ginger, but thought I would try it. I decided that 1/4 tsp can't make that much difference.  All I could taste in the meat part was the ginger flavor (only because I don't like it, I'm sure).  My husband who is a big meatloaf fan didn't say he liked it, but he didn't complain either.  I may make it again without the ginger to see if we like it better.

We love this recipe! I belong to a Supper Club where a whole bunch of women get together each month to prepare meals to take home and freeze for later use. This recipe gets requested more than any other recipe we've done! The only thin we change is that we double the recipe... we made it as is one time, and the only complaint we got was that there wasn't enough of it!

Fantastic meat loaf!! I used rolled oats instead of the saltine crackers and topped the meatloaf with the brown sugar ketchup (+worcheshire)  mixture. If you like sweet and savory dishes you will love this!!

I agree with the others about putting the brown sugar and ketchup mixture on the top. It was much better that way! I also placed slices of bread in the bottom of the pan first as suggested and it worked like a charm! Not near as greasy as regular meatloaf. This was a really good recipe and easy too!

I have been making this meatloaf for quite awhile, now. My family loves it. Anyway, I made it the last time and realized I had forgotten to put in the brown sugar and ketchup. So, instead, I sprinkled sugar (less than what is called for) and spread the ketchup on top, and it was even better.

This recipe was great. I left out the ginger since we don't care for it. I would double the sauce and add some to the meat mixture to give it that wonderful taste all the way through. This meatloaf wasn't greasy which was great, it came out perfect. We had enough left overs to make meatloaf sandwiches the next day. Thanks for the recipe.

The glaze & ground ginger give this meatloaf it's distinction. However, I made a few changes: I used only 1 lb of ground beef & substituted 2 cups of cooked lentils for the 2nd lb.; I used oatmeal instead of bread crumbs; I added some chopped green pepper; & lastly I put the glaze on top the last 15 min. as suggested by another reviewer.  MY changes are the reason I gave it only 4 stars.

Good recipe. I used a onion soup mix and added about 1/4 tsp garlic. As previously suggested, I added 1 tblsp worcestershire sauce, the brown sugar, and ketchup on top of the meatloaf. To soak up the fat, I used 3 thin slices of homemade Amish bread.

as far as taste goes, AWESOME! This really has a great taste and I am certain I will be making this again and again. My only issue is the brown sugar/ketchup mixture on the bottom of the pan hardens in some places and becomes chewy and hard to eat or even get off your spoon/fork. I used ground beef b/c it was all I had and I knew it would create more grease so I added extra bread crumbs and it turned out great. VERY EASY To make as well!

This is an excellent recipe.  I know when someone says they modified the recipe in their review, it's quite annoying.  I only added.  Put the ketchup/brown sugar mix on top AND bottom.  Putting it on the bottom really surprised me and I was a little iffy at first, but it was really freakin' delicious.

What a disaster.  Even after cutting the milk down, I ended up with hamburger soup, with a slimy sugary bottom.

I have never made meatloaf by hand before and my husband loves meatloaf. I usually by the frozen one in a box. So, I suprised him one day.  Now I have to make it once a week! I am not much of a meatloaf lover and I liked it too, but not as my hubby.  Thanks for the recipe!

This makes a really great meatloaf. I always use the cracker crumbs with any meatloaf recipe and they always turn out great. I don't like a very sweet glaze so I cut down on the brown sugar to 1/4 cup which was just right.

Holy ...this is some awesome meatloaf. The only thing I did differently is use "meatloaf mix" instead of straight ground beef. The stuff on the bottom of the pan seemed weird at first, but I found that it created this delicious mix with the juice from the meat...so I had a gravy to pour on the potatoes.

This was amazing. I made a few alterations based on reading some of the reviews. I used ground turkey instead of ground beef, and only used 1/4 cup of milk.  I replaced the saltines with plain bread crumbs.  I added diced green peppers and a few dashes of worchershire sauce.  I added the ketchup and brown sugar on to the top of the meatloaf when it had only 15 minutes left to bake.  

Superb!  I got rave reviews from everyone!

Delicious!  My DH has been asking me to make him meatloaf for a long time, I thought i didn't like meatloaf (childhood memeory) but I loved this!  My husband was very happy as well. I used ground Turkey, used onion soup mix, omitted the salt, and I added a squirt of worchestershire to the glaze, and spread on top. This sweet glaze really makes this meatloaf tasty.  Yum!  Next time i'm going to make double and freeze one.

This was pretty good.  The ginger gave a little bit of a different taste, but we liked it! I also put the ketchup/brown sugar on the top of the meatloaf.

I made this for the first time on Friday night for dinner and before I could even get it on my plate my husband’s comment was “This is good!”  I was a little unsure of putting milk in my meatloaf since I had never done that before, but I figured I couldn’t go wrong since the recipe had very good reviews.  I followed the recipe as is minus the onions since hubby won’t eat them.  I used CAB ground round for the beef and I did add one teaspoon each of onion powder and garlic powder. I combined the ketchup and brown sugar and put it on the top of the loaf in the pan and when it was done baking I put it under the broiler for about two minutes to caramelize the topping.  The meatloaf had a good texture and was moist.  However, the topping was a little too sweet, maybe next time I will cut back a bit on the sugar.

This recipe was really easy to make.  All of us liked it. I did make some changes on this recipe.  I did not add ginger.  I also mixed the ketchup and brown sugar together and put this on top of the loaf.  I alos used a 13 x 9 dish and mounded up the meatloaf in the center of the dish.  It made it easy to slice and the slices were not huge.  I would make this again anytime!!

This was so good.  My extended family said that it was "Restaurant Good".  Instead of making loaves, I make these into muffins, squirt ketchup on top of each, then spoon a 1/2 tbsp. of brown sugar on each.  This made about 18, the perfect serving size for the waistline ;)...  Next time I think I will do half ground beef, half ground turkey.

i guess it's already been said... good basic meatloaf! I will try it next time with bbq sauce instead of ketchup for the extra flavor. Real chopped onions and worchestire sauce are a must in my opinion. Also cut back on the milk. We had it with just plain bread and mayo... a simple, delicious combo!

Great taste!  But make sure you throughly mix the salt with the eggs and milk before adding the meat I had some really salty and then really bland parts (my fault)  I also put some of the brown sugar and catsup mix on the top....thanks.

This is the BEST meatloaf I have ever had!! I took other reviewers advice and put the glaze on top instead of the bottom, I used 1/2c milk and omitted the ginger. It was the first meatloaf I have ever made and I was wonderful. Even my picky 5 year old ate it!

My husband loves this. I use Ground Turkey and I don't measure any of the ingredients, but I always use at least 1 T. of Ginger. It tastes a little different each time, but it's still really good. I serve it with Sour Cream Mashed Potatoes

I reduced the brown sugar to 1/3 cup, added worchestire sauce and didn't have any ginger.  After the reviews about ketchup mixture, I just put a little on the top and on the bottom, and it was great!  Just the meatloaf recipe I was looking for.

The sauce is simply wonderful! I did mix the brown sugar and ketchup together, then spread it on top. This helped keep my pan clean, and keep the great sauce with the meatloaf (making it easier to serve.) This was very similar to how my mother used to make meatloaf with ketchup on top, but he extra brown sugar really makes an awesome difference. The ginger is a really great addition, too! I upped the amount of ginger I used the second time around, and even added to the sauce. My 12-year-old, little brother keeps asking for meatloaf every week!

We really liked this recipe.  I changed a couple of things, like others, by putting the brown sugar and ketchup (mixed) on top 1/2way through cooking, and only using about 1/2 the recommended amount of sugar.  I also used 2 pounds of bison (instead of 1 1/2 lbs) and cooked for just under 1 1/2 hours.  I used oats instead of crackers or bread crumbs.  It was really good and I'm sure we'll make it again!  :)

This meatloaf is REALLY good. Thanks to the other reviewers, I was able to tweak the recipe to make it really good. I used 1/2 cup milk, 1/4 cup of brown sugar (I could not imagine using 1/2 cup, that'd be too much), 1 tsp salt, 1 envelope of onion soup/dip mix instead of the onion, omitted the ginger, used 1 cup of saltine crackers, and added a tbsp of Worchestire sauce to both the sauce and the meat mix. I did add 2 tbsp of minced onion to the sauce mix though. I also poured the sauce over the meatloaf instead of putting it at the bottom of the pan. Finally I used 1.3 lbs of pre-packaged Italian-seasoned ground turkey (Shady Brook brand works really well). I was a little worried about being able to tell that it wasn't beef, but you could NOT tell the difference, the turkey was AWESOME. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed it, though he said it was a little salty, so next time I might try using unsalted Saltine crackers instead.

Yum-oh! I sauted chopped onions and added it to the meat mixture; for the sauce, I added some BBQ sauce as well as the ketchup and brown sugar.  Next time, I will try adding Worcheshire sauce.

This is great with a few changes; I used only 1/4 C brown sugar and 1/2 C milk and added worchestershire sauce as other reviewers suggested.  I also added chopped fresh garlic and ground mustard to the glaze for a bit of zip.  I cook meatloaf without a loaf pan; I line a jelly roll pan with tin foil and place a cooling rack on top of that.  Then place the loaf on the rack; the fat just ends up dripping off the loaf.  I also "baste" with the glaze a few times during cooking.  Thanks for a nice recipe I will use over and over!

Yummy!!! Brother-n-law who never liked meatloaf, loved this one! My sister took the recipe. Changes I made, (as by some suggestions) was sauteed the onions in olive oil and garlic. Used less milk, crushed Ritz Crackers, dash of Worchester Sauce, and sprinkled in Cayenne pepper (although next time will add MORE b/c the sweet and spicy taste was great!!!). Also did brown surgar/ketchup on both top and bottom.
Yum Yum Yum!!!

Yummy! I made this recipe for my dad. It is very simple. Like others. I reduced ketchup and brown sugar to 1/4c. I used dark sugar btw. I added 1 tbsp. worcestershire sauce to beef mixture. Probably could have put a little more. Used less milk and agree that only 1 egg is needed. I used whole wheat ritz and whole wheat saltine mix. I made mix of the ketchup and brown sugar in a seperate bowl and added a few splashes of worcestershire sauce then brushed mixture on top of loaf. I did had to make extra sauce after baking for my dad to spread on (he's a sauce kind of guy). AS OTHERS HAVE STATED USE BEEF HIGHER THAN 80/20 unless you love grease. Although after a few hours after serving, the meatloaf absorbed some of the grease and other moisture and turned out even better than it was immediately served. I think is a great second day meal!! This is sooo easy and quick to make. Beef selection is the most important.

This was a good meatloaf.  We used bbq sauce instead of ketchup (this is just our preference)  I would also suggest to put a baking sheet under your loaf pan, I did when I read other reviews and was glad!  It did spill out even with brownsuger/bbq sauce mix on bottom.

Oh man was this good! I have to admit I've always been afraid of meatloaf recipes because just the thought of adding ketchup to something like this didn't set right with me. But I plucked up the courage and boy am I glad I did! It was delicious! I only made 2 tiny changes. I followed other suggestions and spread the brown sugar and ketchup mixture ontop of the loaf instead of on the bottom and I used golden bread crumbs instead of cracker crumbs. Thanks so much for sharing!

So good. I put the brown sugar and ketchup on top instead of the bottom. My husband thought it was a little to sweet but my parents and I thought it was perfect. Great recipe!

My husband was not a big meatloaf fan until I made this recipe.  I did double the sauce and glad I did because we agreed it was the sauce that made it special.  My new meatloaf recipe.

This turned out great, but I made quite a few changes based on everyones comments - less milk , less brown sugar, glaze only on top. I also threw one carrot and one zucchini along with the onion into my food processor and chopped it all finely. My kids couldnt even tell there were veggies hiding in there. Amazing. Thanks!!

I love this recipe!!!  I have made it twice and my family eats it up every time.  The only thing that I do different is make a sauce using the brown  sugar, 1/2 ketchup, and 1/2 BBQ sauce, and put some on the bottom and on the top  once it is out of the oven. It is very delicious and even the most pickiest of eaters gobble this up !  Thanks for such a wonderful recipe!!!

Great!!  I used b-bque sauce instead of ketchup because I am not a fan of ketchup, also used bread crumbs instead of saltines because I was out.  Besides that everything was the same and it was Yummie!

The reviews from other members really help! I took the advice of others and used less milk,sugar and used Ritz crackers. Instead of ketchup on the sugar I used hot barbeque sauce on the bottom. Cooked for 40min, drained off some of the grease, brushed some sauce on the top and cooked another 30min. Before cooking I mixed the beef with small amounts of spicy brown mustard and steak sauce. I covered it and let sit in the frig for 30min. Came out great and not too sweet with the spices.

This was wonderful!  The only changes I made were to use 1/2 cup of milk, 1/3 cup brown sugar (all I had, but it was the perfect amount) and italian seasoned bread crumbs--perfect.  I used one medium onion and added about 1/2tsp of onion powder as well.  I cooked it in a gas oven at 200C for 1 hour and it was perfect.  I made this for 6 people (3 adults and 3 children) and everyone gobbled it up!  Will definitely be making it again!

WOW! I've always stuck with my usual meat loaf recipe because it's good and everyone loves it... but I think I'm going to proudly ditch my recipe and use this from now on! It was absolutely delicious! Due to many others saying it's "too sweet," I decided to use 1/3 cup of light brown sugar instead of 1/2 a cup as called for. The end result was perfect; not too sweet at all! My entire family loved it and I thank you for posting it. 5 stars for sure!

WOW!  My husband and I love this recipe!  I use the leanest meat I can find, egg substitute, and nonfat milk (Simply Smart) to make it a bit healthier.  I also use granulated sugar, but if you do this, go easy on the liquids as it will make it very juicy.

This is an awesome recipe!  I have made this meatloaf several times and it comes out delicious everytime.  

The only substitution I make is I never have saltine crackers, so I use plain breadcrumbs instead..comes out great.  My whole family loves this one!

This was very good and easy to make. I put the glaze on top of the meatloaf as others suggested. WhenI pulled the meatloaf out of the oven, it looked a bit unappetizing, sitting in tons of grease.  I'm not sure if that's the case with all meatloaf recipes though.  Next time I will mix half of the glaze into the actual loaf and then pour the rest on top to flavor the entire loaf.

Oh my gosh! The best meatloaf ever! I also mixed up the ketchup and brown sugar and put it on top.UPDATE: I took the leftover meatloaf, sliced it and layed in a pan. Topped it with a drained can of green peas and topped them with 1/2 cup cheddar cheese. Topped that with leftover mashed potatoes and baked till potatoes were browned. WONDERFUL 2 great meals and it didn't seem like we were eating leftovers.

This recipes is delicious. The wonderful flavor of the brown sugar and the catsup really made my family enjoy it. However, after making it several times I have decided that it comes out best when you put the brown sugar and the catsup in the middle of the loaf. On the bottom it gets lost in the juices from the meat, on the top it ends up crispy and unenjoyable, but in the middle it seems to be just right. Try it and see what you think.

This recipe was great. I used 1/2 packet of onion soup and 1/2 of a sweet onion. Took the advice to put a small layer on bottom and a layer on top as well. Used Ginger and Garlic. Cut out Salt and pepper. Added the worsetshire sauce to the mix as well. 

was a hit. 

will make over and over again

GREAT! I used ground turkey for the first time in a meatloaf, it was great, not too greasy and couldn't tell it was turkey and not ground beef.  Due to other reviews, I reduced milk to 1/4 cup and brown suger to 1/4 cup.  But I added an additional mixture of 2 TBSP each of brown sugar and ketchup and put on the top of meatloaf the last 30 minutes of baking, and total baking time was one and a half hours due to others reviews.  It was perfect! I also did not use ginger because I didn't have it. Can't wait to make again!

I used less milk, seasoned bread crumbs, worchestershire and garlic. I used just 2T brown sugar, 1/2c ketchup, 1T worchestershire & 2T lemon juice. I placed this on the top of the meat loaf for the last 15min. Will make again.

I forgot to mention that to make it a bit healthier, I used a pound and a half of ground turkey instead of ground beef. It was just as flavorful as can be - and better for you to boot!

I didn't think I'd find a meatloaf I liked better than mom's, but I did!  I used less milk and cut the brown sugar by almost half and used seasoned dry breadcrumbs, at the suggestion of other reviewers. While the ketchup/sugar thing made a tasty gooey sauce in the bottom of the pan, I think next time I will put all of the mix on the top.

This was amazing! For a none meatloaf lover, I was relly impressed. My boyfriend thought it tasted like General Tso's sauce and loved it. I made this with ground turkey and egg beaters and it turned out perfect. Will become a staple. Thanks!

This was AWESOME! My 2 year old ate almost an entire slice of it!

I pretty much followed the recipe exactly except
~ I put half the ketchup/BS mixture on bottom and the other half on top.
~ I also added a little bit of garlic
~Used only 1/4 cup milk
~Used Ritz Crackers, I had no saltines

Im replacing my moms recipe with this one for sure!!

The very best meatloaf I have found so far.  I did as past reviewers suggested and added a dash worcestershire sauce to the ketchup and brown sugar.  I only used 1 pound lean ground beef so I cut back on the amount of other ingredients just a touch and used only 1 egg.  I saw no need to grease the pan and I used half the sauce on the bottom of the pan and the rest on top of the meatloaf.  This was a very moist flavorful loaf and we did not find it too sweet at all.  Will definetly pass this recipe along to friends and family.

Like this recipe a lot. The sweetness is not too overpowering. Only used 1 egg. I poured out a lot of fluid when done baking. Thought it was grease even though I used extra lean meat. Turned out not to be grease. Might have influenced the flavor even more if I had left the fluid in. Maybe I should cut back on the amount of milk and add the other egg. The loaf was nice and firm. Crushed up some Ritz crackers in my food processor instead of using saltines. Baked at 350 for 45 minutes and 45 more minutes covered in foil.

I followed everything exactly but didn't use onion. I didn't like the brown sugar and ketchup at the bottom of the pan, it made the meatloaf mushy. I do like the idea of using brown sugar in meatloaf, but on the bottom is not the right place for it. I will try this recipe again but change some things up: use only 1 egg, 1/3 cup milk, 3/4 cup crackers, a bit brown sugar in with the meat and on top.

This is definitely the best meatloaf recipe I've tried in a long time. I didn't think I would like the sweet flavor because I usually make savory meatloaf but the brown sugar really works!!  I only had a lb of ground round so I converted down to 5 servings which was just under a lb & like alot of other people did, I mixed the ketchup and brown sugar together & spread half on bottom, a little bit on top and then basted a few more times during cooking.  This is a definite keeper!

My son in law told me to keep this recipe as he loved it. It was just okay for me. Maybe I shouldn't have used a glass baking dish. Seems like I lost all the brown sugar ketchup mixture from the bottom of the loaf. I thought I was going to end up with a nice sweet crust underneath. I also put half the b.sugar and Ketchup on top. It was very moist. I think I will add a little less bread crumbs next time because the texture was 'bready'. Also I had to leave the ginger out since I didn't have any. All in all a decent meatloaf. Thanks

My husband and I LOVE this recipe!  It is one of the first ones that I have taken from allrecipes and I have made it so many times...I even made a quadruple recipe to split up and freeze for when our first child is born (which is any day now) so that we'd be able to just defrost, heat and serve it when we won't have much time to cook.  I highly recommend this recipe.

Wonderful. I only placed 1/2 the Brown Sugar/Ketchup on the bottom of the pan, the other 1/2 on the top. Added some of the left over onion slices to the top. It was wonderful. Also used bread crumbs instead of crackers.

If you like pepper as I do, add equal parts pepper and salt.

I absolutely love this.  It's so yummy.  Like everyone else, I mix the brown sugar and ketchup together.  I also add just a splash of worcester sauce and some garlic.  Instead of onions in the meatloaf, I add an envelope of onion soup mix.

This was delicious.  I am not a meatloaf fan and like many others loved it.  I have forwarded this to many of my friends.  I put about half of the sauce on top and saved the rest for dipping but the meatloaf was so moist it didn't need any additional sauce.  I also put 2 slices of bread on the bottom to absorb the grease.  It works wonderful.  Used garlic and Tony's creole seasoning as suggested by others.

My husband said it was excellent and he isn't a barbecue fan and my 8 year old who has been so pickey lately had seconds.  

This will definitely be a repeat at our house whenever I'm feeling selfish!

Delicious!  I followed other reviewers' advice and put half the brown sugar and ketchup (to which we added a couple of splashes of Worcester sauce) on the top.  I chopped the onions pretty small, and reduced the milk by about half.  I was going to make meatloaf sandwiches the next day, but my husband had eaten every last bit at dinner the night before!

I have made this recipe on multiple occasions and my family always loves it.  I put the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom and it turns out great.  I must admit that I don't use cracker crumbs, I use italian bread crumbs.  My niece loves it so much i had to make a personal one for her and hubby at their wedding

I made this for my boyfriend with a few modifications. I used half the amount suggested for onions and replaced it with green bell pepper. Also, instead of cracker crumbs, I used french fried onions. He said "It was the "best meatloaf I've ever had!"

I only used about half the milk and also used italian bread crumbs instead of the crackers.  I put a little bit of the ketchup/brown sugar mixture on the bottom of the pan and spread the rest on top of the meatloaf.  Next time I think I'll put it all on top, as it just kinda spread out over the pan (I used a round stoneware pan and flatten the meatloaf out so it will cook quicker.  I loved the hint of ginger in the meatloaf.  Thanks for sharing!

I have been using this recipe since 2003 and my wife and I really love it!  We actually enjoy more of the sweetness (we call it sweetloaf) and therefore apply 1/4 cup ketchup and 1/4  cup Brown Sugar on the top in addition to the 1/2 cup ketchup and 1/2 cup brown sugar in the bottom of the pan.   We entered it in a friendly meatloaf competition last night and won 1st place out of nine entries! Starbuck is a legend!

This is a very good meatloaf recipe, I added a packet of onion soup mix as well. It's five stars as far as meatloaf goes but meatloaf isn't really a five star dinner:)  Good combination of flavors.

I always thought meatloaf was so so and I only fixed it on rare occassions til I found this recipe. I doubled all the ingredients and used home made brown sugar instead and everyone loves it. Also, if the milk turns out to be too much for you just add a little extra crackers to soak it up. My husband even compliments this meatloaf and that is rare for him. I sent some over to my neighbors house and he took some over to his friends house and said "You have got to taste this meatloaf!" The leftovers are great on a slice of bread and a little mashed potatoes on top.

I didn't have any ginger on hand and I cooked it for an hour but probably could have left it in a little longer. No matter--it still turned out DELICIOUS!!! Will DEFINITELY be making this again!

I made this for my mother-in-law and she kept saying it reminded her of the wonderful meatloaf that her mother used to make.  It's a really good nostalgic dinner for a cold and rainy day.Be sure to toss one onion soup mix packet into the meat.

This is the best meatloaf we have ever had. Both my family, and my day care kids love it! I have made it both with the onions, and without (sometimes I'm out of onions), and it still comes out the best. It is a part of our regular rotation and has been for several months. Thanks for submitting it!

Good recipe for meatloaf. My husband and I decided over this dinner that we like a more savory meatloaf, so no more brown sugar for us! Tastes like a bbq.
My only real con is that the sugar mixture was very hard to get off the pan!

Wow! This was fantastic, simply the best meatloaf I have ever had! I only made a few changes. I only had 1 lb of beef so I adjusted a few ingredients. I used 1/4 cup of milk initially but then added a little more into the mix later. I used a little less than 1/4 cup of packed brown sugar, putting about 1/2 on the bottom (with a little "zig zag" of ketchup on top of it) and the rest on top (with another little "zig zag" of ketchup). I also substituted about 1 cup of bread crumbs for the saltine crackers. The last change was to sauté the onions in butter before adding them to the beef mix. All the other ingredients I left the same as portioned for 1 1/2 lbs of beef. Great recipe - thank you for sharing it!

I have been making this meatloaf for quite some time and it turns out perfect every time.  I started making it in  individual portions using large muffin tin since I usually double the recipe it makes leftovers easier to pack for our girls to take home since it is one of their favorite meals!! or if they let us keep it can be frozen and used for single serving.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

WOW!  This is the first time I have ever eaten meatloaf and LOVED it.  I've tried many many recipes and none have touched this one.  I was delicious!  The only thing I changed was the amount of milk.  You definitely don't need 3/4 cups as it would make it to mushy.  I barely used 1/4 and it came out perfect.  The brown sugar sauce/glaze was delicious.

The best meatloaf recipe on this site so far. I decreased the brown sugar to 1/3 cup based on other reviews that it was too sweet. I'm glad I did, I think it was perfect this way. I didn't have cracker crumbs so I just used 1 cup bread crumbs. Mine was not too moist, possibly because of the change to breadcrumbs? My husband loved it and we will definitely use this recipe again. Thanks!

Very tasty...reminds me of a sweet and sour meal at a chinese restaurant. I think it's for that reason that I would reduce the sugar and katsup next time. With the amount there is in this recipe you can't taste the flavor of the meat itself.  Anyhow, other than that, loved it!
I made this again and cut the topping in half and ommited the milk. Much better all together!

This meatloaf turned out delicious! The second time I made this I added 1/2 cup of creamed corn and omitted the ginger. The result was a softer creamier texture. Equally delicious.

There was only one problem with this recipe... my husband ate half the loaf in one sitting! :) He said it was "even better than Mom used to make!" I'll be making meatloaf this way from now on. Thanks!

This is my first time trying brown sugar with meatloaf. Everyone loved it. I used 1 lb ground turkey, 1 egg, onion and garlic powder, and omitted the milk. Also I mixed some of the glaze into the meatloaf. It was fabulous. This is my new staple recipe for meatloaf.

This meatloaf creates the best-tasting juices!  Serve with garlic mashed potatoes and a fresh vegetable for a well balanced meal.  Pair up with some bread to make a great tasting lunch the next day!

I'll definitely try again. I used onion soup mix instead of the onion and salt, bread crumbs instead of crackers and 1/2 ground turkey and 1/2 lean ground beef. I don't cook meatloaf in a loaf pan, just form it into a loaf and put it on a baking sheet (the fat drips away then). Even my picky 4 year old liked it!

A bit too sweet for my taste - but I guess that's to be expected. I followed the other reviewers advice and placed half the sauce in the bottom, also added suateed veggies to the meat, and the cut back on the sugar - still too sweet. Hubby LOVED it though...

We made the recipe exactly as written after seeing it in the Allrecipes Cooknik sample. It was one of the best meatloaf recipes we've ever had, and is now "the" meatloaf recipe for our family. Perfectly moist and oh so tasty.

Have made this many times now, and everytime it comes out amazing.  And I only tried it cause hubby loves meatloaf!  Lo and behold, this is now one of may absolutely favorite recipes--the flavor and texture is superb.  The only things I have changed is the put some sauce on the bottom per the recipe, but the rest I use over the top as a glaze.  I use Italian breadcrumbs instead of saltines.  

Thank you so much for this recipe!

This is by far the best meatloaf I have ever tasted and my husband & daughter just love it. I try to mix everything the night before so when I get home from work all you have to do is pop it in the oven.

How could anyone rate this a 1*?  It's fantastic!  My hubby says he can start to learn to like meatloaf when it tastes like this one!  I double batched it.  I put the sugar/ketchup on the bottom, as well as on the top.  I NEVER USE GREASY ground beef, so there was not much in the pan.  EXCELLENT-EXCELLENT!  Thank you STARBUCK! :)

Can I echo the "BRAVO" below me?  this meatloaf was FANTASTIC - my hubby says it was the best he's ever had, and he deserves the best!  I used ground turkey instead of beef (never will use beef again, the flavor in ground turkey was outstanding) an onion soup mix packet instead of chopped onion (laziness ;) and added a bit of worchestshire and cut way back on the milk.  This is basically the same stuff a lot of reviewers did.  Also used Ritz crackers instead of saltines, and mixed the brown sugar and ketchup together before spreading on TOP of the loaf.  I don't know why you would ever put the glaze on the bottom??  Doesn't make sense.  Anyway, thanks for the recipe Starbuck (love the name by the way, my fave coffee), I will be sure to use again and again.

I LOVE this recipe. I looked for two days for a good meatloaf recipe. I keep coming back to this one. It had so many good reviews I had to try it. I did only put in half of the brown sugar, I didn't want to make it to sweet. I had none left they ate it all. They wanted more. I will double the recipe next time I make it. I'm glad I saved me a piece for my lunch the next day. This one is a keeper for sure.

This meatloaf is excellent!  Yum!  However, only 4 stars because as written it is only so-so.  After reading the reviews I cut the brown sugar in half and am very glad I did - the meatloaf was plenty sweet and I may use even less next time.  I mixed the brown sugar with the ketchup and added a bit of worcestershire sauce, then spread this over the top of the loaf (heeded the warnings of others about spattering :)).  I used oats instead of the saltines and ended up needing to add ~1/4 c. more.  I only used ~1/4 c. milk and that was plenty - the mix was soupy enough without the extra.  I also used ground turkey, just a personal preference (and it's what I had in the fridge).  But, at the end of the day, this meatloaf is FABULOUS.  It comes out moist and delicious.  My husband has requested that I make it much more often.  Yum :)

this was a "sweet" meatloaf. My husband ranted and raved over how excellent it was; I personally could cut back on the brown sugar layer by half and still be completely satisfied.

My goodness this was good!! Not the traditional taste--much sweeter. Nonetheless, my family couldn't eat it fast enough! My husband wasn't too excited when I told him we were having meatloaf for dinner, but boy he was pleasantly surprised. I chose to use ground turkey  instead for a 'lighter' taste--turned out yummy.

Made this twice and made only few adjustments 2nd time around.  Used breadcrumbs as no saltines available.  Substituted 1 pkg. onion soup mix for onion (personal preference).  Added 1 TBSP worcestershire sauce to ketchup/bsugar mix for a little Zing.  I only put this on top during the last 10~15 min (after draining any grease from pan).  Made a great glaze....can also broil  1-2 minutes to carmelize.  Yummy!!!!  Thanks for sharing!!

Easy and unususal way of making the glaze on the bottom. Very tasty meatloaf. My husband thought it was too sweet. I'll give it 4.5 stars. Will make it again (with a little less brown sugar for hubby). Son loved this recipe.

I don't like meatloaf at all but I must admit, this recipe was good.  I took advice from other reviewers and put the brown sugar/ketchup mixture on top of the meatloaf.  I also omitted the chopped onion for a packet of Lipton onion soup mix.  I only used 1/2 cup of milk.  I cooked the meatloaf for 1 hour and 25 minutes and the middle was still pink.  It was delicious though.  I will make again.

This was tasty and I'd make it again.  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and used onion powder in place of onions (to get the flavour without adding something for the kids to object to!) and put the brown sugar and ketchup on top.  As the loaf shrank with cooking, I drained the fat that was collecting at the sides.

i unexpectantly bought 2 lbs. of nice looking meatloaf mix (about 60% beef/40% pork) at my grocers, then went online to allrecipes looking for a good recipe & found this one. the only changes i made were by slightly rounding up the spices & onion to accommodate the additional amount of meat, using club crackers instead of saltines (what i had on hand) & baking the meatloaf for 1 1/2 hours. afterward i carefully poured off the excess fat from the bottom of the pan. that wasn't too difficult since it has risen to the top of the delicious brown sugar-catsup sauce. this had a nice kick from the ginger too. my family devoured every bite! many thanks starbuck!

This is a fantastic meatloaf recipe! Everyone in the family loved it. I did substitute ground turkey for the ground beef and oatmeal for the saltine crackers. I mixed up the brown sugar and ketchup and put that on top of the loaf as many have suggested. I know I'll be making this again and again....thanks so much Starbuck!

This is perfect as written.  I've made this for a few years and we never make any changes.  This is a sweet meatloat so it's great way to get kids to eat it.

My husband LOVES this meatloaf.  Instead of cutting up an onion though, I add a flavor packet from Lipton..it's just as good (and you don't have to cut up the onion.) I also use regular breadcrumbs.

This was a very good recipe. I made three loaves for a large crowd and cut the meatloaf up like you would bread, because I thought it would be cool to have meatloaf sandwiches (yummy), but no one ate it in that way (smile), but they loved the meatloaf just the way it was. The first day I made it I did think the brown sugar was over-powering.  However, I let it sit for a while and the over-powering sweet flavor diminished during the day.  The next day the leftover meatloaf was devoured by my entire family and everyone kept saying they liked this meatloaf better than the previous days meatloaf and I had to practically swear on a bible that it was the same meatloaf.  I would say that similar to the American Lasagna on this site, this recipe is way better the next day and I would suggest making it ahead of time if you can.  Thanks for a great recipe Starbuck and I will definitely make it again.

Though I don't eat meat, my son LOVED this meatloaf.  I'm replacing my old recipe with this one.  Zero modifications...apparently, it's perfect as is!

I first tried this recipe about a year ago.  I have had a tried and true meatloaf recipe for almost forty years but just felt like trying something new.  I made it one Sunday morning, just for my husband and me, and set the oven for it to cook while we were at church.  We ended up inviting a couple from church over for "meatloaf surprise" at the last minute.  I hadn't prepared much in the way of side dishes, but the meatloaf was delicous and a big hit.  And I must add that the smell of it cooking was a nice welcome home.  It is not all that different to my "old" recipe, but I think the addition of the brown sugar and catsup in the BOTTOM of the pan (and perhaps the ginger?) really "made" it special.  It is now my new favorite meatloaf recipe.  Thanks so much for sharing.

This is a delicious recipe that I make all the time.  I usually double it and make it in a 9x13 pan so I can have more of the sugar/ketchup sauce on the meatloaf.

It took me a second time making this to really like it.  The second time, I did as others suggested and put half the brown sugar sauce on the bottom and half on top and I liked it SO much better!  Definately a keeper.

Although I changed the recipe, slightly, we really enjoyed this meatloaf!  I used Jalapeno salt and Lime pepper.  When I found that I was out of catsup, I substituted Seafood Cocktail Sauce.  (That may have cut down, a bit, on the sweetness that a few reviewers objected to.)  I spread the brown sugar mixture on top of the loaf, which made a nice glaze when baked.

I made the recipe exactly as directed.  My family loved it.  Even my ten year old, who, when finding out we were having meatloaf said, "Ewww!" loved it.  Just be warned that this is a VERY sweet tasting meatloaf.  My taste buds weren't prepared before I took my first bite.  It made excellent sandwiches the next day.  One suggestion that was not mentioned in the cooking instructions:  After you take the meatloaf out of the oven let it sit for five minutes.  Then cut it into slices.  Use tongs to move the slices from the baking dish to a platter.  After all the slices are removed use a wisk to blend the meat juices with the brown sugar / ketchup mixture and then pour this over the meatloaf on your platter.  Excellent meatloaf.  The only thing I would do differently would be to cut back on the brown sugar next time.  Thanks for sharing!

I changed the recipe for one l lb of meat, used a little less milk and more crackers as others suggested, and put a bit of the sauce on top.  It was amazing - my husband swears his moms meatloaf is the best in the world and he rated this one above hers!

We LOVE the ginger in the meatloaf. It doesn't work for me to put the topping in the bottom of a loaf pan. I freeform the loaf on a broiler pan and poke holes through it for fat to drain. I bake the topping on top of the loaf for the entire baking time and it comes out great.

My husband, who has never liked a meatloaf I've cooked, actually liked this one and much as I did! I only used half the amount of sugar and ketchup and added some worcestershire sauce as advised by others.  Next time I may try using same amount of sugar/ketchup but split it and put some on top and some on bottom like others suggested. Otherwise it was fabulous. Will make again!

I am a novice in the kitchen and I was looking for something simple, yet tasty.  This is definitely it!  My husband couldn't stop raving about it.  I didn't have any ginger, but it still had lots of flavor and a wonderful sweetness to it that is unexpected in a beef recipe.  I will make it with ginger next time, but my husband didn't see how it could be improved.  Thank you for the recipe!

This is really good!  My family enjoyed this meatloaf a great deal.  I used a little less onion and I did put some ketchup on the top during the last few minutes of cooking.

Great recipe!!  The only thing I did differently was use about 1/2 a small onion.  Next time I'll try grating the onion (my husband's suggestion) so my picky 3-year old won't spend her time picking them out!  My husband is a chef, and he thought this had really great flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

The meatloaf to end all meatloaves! This is the best recipe I've EVER tried! I have made this many times now and always omit the ginger (never have it on hand) and it is the best you will ever try. No meatloaf compares to this one. The cooking time is always much longer than the recipe says though.

I thought this was pretty good and would make it again.  My kids all liked it.  I also put the sugar and ketchup on top which I'm glad I did because there was a lot of grease on the bottom that I had to pour out.  I also added to meatloaf a squirt of mustard and a shake of worchestershire sauce.  Thanks for the recipe.

Awesome!!!  My meatloaf used to turn out dry and tasteless...not after I came across this recipe.  I used oatmeal instead of saltines and added a bit of KC Masterpiece to the meatloaf mixture, but I am sure that if I would have followed the recipe exactly as printed I would have still had wonderful results.  I loved the idea of putting the topping on the bottom of the pan...somehow that technique seemed to add the flavor that I was looking for and it seemed to keep the meatloaf moist, not just after I cooked it...but the leftovers as well.  My 15 year old son used to turn up his nose when I said that I was going to make meatloaf for dinner, but not after I found this recipe...he can't seem to get enough of it when I make it.

This recipe is EXCELLENT!!  I fed a large group of people (7 adults & 6 kids) that were hungry from working outside, so I adjusted the reciped to use 5 lbs of ground chuck (which is convenient since my grocery store sells it in a 5 lb roll).  I cooked it in a 13x9 pan for about 1 1/2 hours.  It was DELICIOUS!  Everyone had second helpings, so there wasn't much left.  I served it with mashed potatoes, gravy, corn, and coleslaw  and had a Carmel Pecan Pie for dessert (another recipe found on this site).  Everything was simple to prepare and was perfect for a chilly day!

I used half ground turkey, half beef, with slices of turkey bacon on the bottom.  The sauce juiced up the turkey flavor, and my picky husband gobbled it up!

This recipes is excellent!  I've made it a few times already and every time I make it I get great compliments for it.  Last night I made it again and added a packet of lipton onion soup and it was delicious.  I don't use the saltine crackers though, I use regular bread crumbs which to me tastes a lot better.

After reading a lot of the reviews and taking several of the other peoples advice( put bs on top, add garlic, use onion soup mix, add worcestershire sauce... I made this recipe. It smelled so good cooking. When it came time to eat it I was not impressed. Surprisingly!! I really thought this recipe would be amazing. My usual recipe is better. My whole family didn't like it. And we were hungry. I can't understand why this recipe is so raved about. Sorry, just disappointed

This is just soooo very sweet, the sweetness really overpowers the overall taste. I put half of the ketchup and brown sugar on the bottom and half on the top and it still didn't work for us, although, I think that it did taste better this way. Also, I omitted the milk and that worked out well. I can't imagine milk in this! This did seem rather loose going in the pan but set up nicely. Also, if you are wondering how many saltines make the 3/4 cup it is approximately half a sleeve. Sorry, won't make this again.

Good! Even my husband, who doesn't usually like meatloaf, liked it. I left out the onions, and used bread crumbs in place of the cracker crumbs. The ketchup & sugar does make it sweet (and the ginger adds a nice sweetness to the meat), which I liked. Very easy, too. Will make again.

I needed a meatloaf recipe in a hurry.  This recipe was so simple to make - - most people should have the ingredients in their pantry.  I loved the brown sugar and ketchup glaze on the bottom.  The meatloaf just seemed to soak up all those flavors.  We had a wonderful dinner tonight!

Just tried this tonite, and I thought it was very very good.. Yes, it is slightly sweet, but, I liked the taste very much.... I would use the sauce mix on top and bottom of meatloaf the next time... 
I was uncertain mixing up the meat mixture initially it seemed very loose, I did add a half an egg more and a bit more cracker crumbs just in case and it was perfect. 
Thanks, will cook again!!!!

MONTHS LATER.. I use this recipe all the time, family loves it... 
This is one of those.... TRY IT, YOU'LL LIKE IT!!!

My husband came home and was not too excited to find out we were having meatloaf.  He took a bite, and said "Oh my God!"  I thought for sure we would have leftovers, but it was so delicious, there weren't any!  Three of us ate the whole thing.  This is the BEST meatloaf EVER!  I didn't change a thing in the recipe.

This recipe turned out great!  We used a tbsp of onion powder in place of the onion.  The only thing I would change is maybe reduce the amount of brown sugar.  The sauce was a little too sweet for us.  Overall, this was a terrific recipe.

I made 1 ½ recipes to accommodate the number of guests. Mixed the ketchup and brown sugar together. Blended the remaining ingredients in my Kitchenaid mixer to avoid getting my hands dirty. Used bread crumbs vs crushed saltine cracker crumbs because it was what I had on hand. Added a bit of prepared minced garlic from a jar. Placed it in a greased 12 x 9 inch pan, shaped it into 2 mounds and topped with ketchup and brown sugar mixture (as suggested by other reviewers).  It’s easy to prepare and delicious. Everyone loved it. One guest had 3 helpings! It's different from other meatloafs in that it’s a little sweet. If it’s too sweet for your taste … just adjust the amount of brown sugar you use.

This was the best meatloaf I have ever had.  I thought the sauce gave it a lot of flavor.  However after the recommended cooking time mine was still pink inside.  I would leave it in the oven for an extra 5 to 10 minutes.

This was good enough for five stars because it was easy, didn't require pages of ingredients and it was tasty too. I wouldn't say it's the best I've ever had, but it's good. Kind of wierd, the part with the brown sugar and ketchup in the bottom of the pan. I did take another reviewers advice and baste a few times so some of those ingredients actually made it onto the meatloaf.

This is wonderful!  I agree, it is a 'special' meatloaf and not for everday.  I made it as the recipe states-- and its good, but I usually make just my ordinary Lipton Onion Soup Mix meatloaf  with the ketchup and brown sugar on the bottom of the pan.  Turns out the same.  I love this and look forward to making it now that the weather is turning cool.  A keeper!!

I think this recipe is excellent!  I shared it with 2 picky eater coworkers today and they liked it too.  I added a little chopped green pepper and used garlic salt instead of regular salt.  I mixed the brown sugar and ketchup together before putting half on the bottom and half on top.  I actually made more of the sugar and ketchup sauce (additional 3/4 cup) and added it to the top, because I like this sauce so much.  If you don't like sweetness in your meatloaf, this is NOT the recipe for you.

I have made this a couple of times and each time it has been great. I do make some changes....I use double the meat and eggs,used one cup of milk, onion powder instead of onion (daughter is 4, she has a thing against crunchy onions), butter cracker crumbs and bread crumbs(I dont measure, I just throw then in until it looks right), and I mixed Worcestershire Sauce in with my katchup and brown sugar. I used a 9 by 13 pan, so I put a little of the brown sugar mix on the bottem and the made a "loaf" with my meat and then spread the rest of the glaze on top. THEN.....I placed bacon accross the whole thing (6 pieces). Bake for one hour, make up a little more glaze and put over bacon and bake for another 45 min to 1 hour. The bacon should  be perfect and it gives the meatloaf an added flavor! GO PORK FAT! This is not for the light eater! This was a good recipe that I addd to and made my own.Thanks

I made this last night and my mother couldn't stop raving about it and my husband made a sandwich with the leftovers for breakfast.  I was told to get rid of any other meatloaf recipes.  I did make a couple of changes; cut the brown sugar in half but will try it as stated next time, glazed the top as my meatloaf pan has bottom drains and added a dry onion soup mix.  Loved the ginger!!

This meatloaf was excellent and was a big hit with the family.  My 4 and 6 year olds enjoyed the brown sugar taste.  My wife who doesn't usually like my meatloaf (because my usual meatloaf she has dubbed bachelor meatloaf), was raving about it.  Only thing that i didn't have on hand was the ground ginger, so the next time I make it I will make sure that is added.  Also like some other reviews suggested, I added only a 1/2 cup milk.  Thanks for the great recipe.

THE BOMB!!! This was so easy and delicious! The entire thing was gone before bed! Everyone loved it. I followed the advice of less brown sugar and was still a little sweet. The best though, no doubt about it!

THE BEST! AWESOME!  I only made this recipe to break in a Pampered Chef loaf pan ... and it was the best meatloaf I've ever had.  After reading some of the reviews, I divided the sauce and brown sugar, putting half on the bottom and half on the top.  Then to the meat mixture, I added 1 tsp of Worcestershire Sauce and left over Bell Pepper I had in the fridge to what the recipe called for.  Very, very good.

My dad makes an amazing meatloaf, so I never imagined that something I made could ever compete.  When I tested this recipe out on my boyfriend, he said that his two favorite foods were now meatloaf and meatloaf. (My Dad's and this one!) I only changed two small things when I made this. I added some chopped green pepper, and I put half of the sauce on the bottom of the pan and half on top.

My sister tried this recipe and raved about it, so I had to try it!  It was great!  I didn't have ginger, so I used pumpkin pie spice in it's place and it tasted really good!  The brown sugar really added a nice sweetness to the meat.  I'll make it again for sure!  Thanks!

I'm writing this review in between bites of the little bit my boyfriend and I didn't inhale last night, and it may even be better today.  So yummy and filling, we laid lifeless on the floor after dinner.  Thank you so much.

Excellent!!  I already had a favorite meatloaf recipe of nearly 20 years, but this was was just as good I do believe.  I enjoyed the lightly sweet flavor that the brown sugar gave it.  I will make this again and again!  Thanks for such a winner!!

8/10/2003: This recipe was awesome. Since I was out of onions I used one packet of Lipton French Onion Mix and used 3/4 cup seasoned bread crumbs. Keeping in mind other reviews stated it was really sweet, I cut down the brown sugar to 1/4 cup. It came out great and my fiancé loved it. UPDATE: 6/9/2018 – Updating rating/review to be more accurate of our opinion…3 stars instead of 5 given in 2003. We’ve made this recipe several times over the years, as written and with slight modifications, but haven’t made it in 4-5 yrs. Tonight, my husband forgot to do a few things. Reduce the brown sugar in half otherwise the glaze is just way too sweet! It’s also better to put the glaze on top of the meatloaf. The meat itself is ok, but we feel it's on the bland side as written. For our tastes, it needs more seasoning like garlic and maybe a little Worcestershire. Definitely prefer using an onion soup mix instead of just the onions (ex: Dry Onion Soup Mix by Faye Watkins is great in meatloaf). For those with food sensitivities or allergies: To make it gluten free (GF), we use GF plain bread crumbs (Italian seasoned works well and adds more seasoning if you have it on hand) or GF Table/Saltine crackers. For lactose free, I’ve subbed milk with unsweetened coconut or almond milk cup for cup with no problems. I omit the eggs for egg free now and have no problems with meatloaves falling apart. 3 stars for a good basic meatloaf, probably a 4 star if the glaze wasn’t so insanely sweet.

This was a pretty good meatloaf recipe, definately sweeter than most, but I liked it.  The meat itself was a little bland to me, might add some more spices next time to give it a better flavor.

This was some very good meatloaf. I used ground turkey and buttermilk instead and the whole family loved it! I will be making it this way from now on.

I thought my kids would like this sweet meatloaf, but even they found it too sugary.  I found it tasty but will reduce the sugar if I make it again.

I tried this meatloaf with two kids who really like meatloaf, they weren't too sure about it. Making the recipe was easy enough and I used some other tips from other reviews written... I put half of the ketchup and brown sugar on both top and bottom, added a garlic clove and used 1T Worchestire sauce. It came out on time but it was very juicy and while I was cutting it the loaf fell apart. The top was a bit too sweet and the center was bland. My family ate it but we weren't thrilled with it, I expected it to be a lot better with all of the great reviews written. I think we will continue to look for a better recipe. Thanks!

This recipe was good, but the brown sugar was a little much, even after reducing it to 1/4c.  Next time I make this recipe, I'll try only a couple TBS brown sugar. I've made this recipe with the ketchup mixture on top of the meatloaf as suggested by many, and on top and bottom, and it's better only on the top.  I reduce the salt to 1 tsp, use dried chopped onion, add 1 tsp garlic powder, and use either butter crackers or hot dog bun crumbs instead of saltines.

I thought this was very good.  I mixed the brown nsugar and ketchup in instead of putting it in the bottom, and also drained the fat using a trivet. Definitely will make this again.

This recipe is the *one* for us.  There are never leftovers.  Company have requested a print out of it and husband LOVES it.  I put the sugar & ketchup on the bottom.  Its also great to prepare a day ahead, and then you pop in the oven when you're ready to go.

Excellent!  I used a "meatloaf pan" from Williams-Sonoma...all the fat dripped to the bottom.  I substitued 4 slices bread crumbs for the crackers.  I used a medium onion instead of small.  I also added one garlic clove - crushed.  I left everything else the same.  I let the meatloaf "sit" for only a few minutes and it was delicious to eat right away!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

In an effort to help with our family hectic activities,  I am now preparing Wed. evening meal
and picked this one out of the blue.  While, the rating suggested 6-8 servings, Our family consumed this dish in one sitting.  Even our 6 yr old had a 2nd portion which is unheard of.  I have added this to my new recipe book and look forward to several others listed throughout your site.  Thanks to whoever listed it. it was great.

I scaled the recipe to 5 servings.  My mom absolutely LOVED this.  She is a celiac, meaning she cannot tolerate anything with wheat in it, so we substituted her gluten-free crackers in place of the saltines, and it worked wonderfully.  I used a little less onion and even then, it was a little too much, but still quite good.  The sauce was slightly watery as well, but that's nothing that couldn't have been solved with extra cooking time. ^_^ A definite make-it-again!

This is a good recipe.  I scaled this recipe for 5 servings (and 1 lb ground sirloin)  I used half a package of onion soup mix vs. the raw onion and it was quite good.  I did not use the ginger and I put the sugar/ketchup mixture on top and bottom.
I make this again.

Very good, but put the brown sugar/ketchup mixture on the top instead of the bottom (or both).  It's the best part of this dish.

This was the best meatloaf my husband and I have ever had! It was easy to make, too. The amount of brown sugar was perfect for us. I, too had trouble getting it to cook through and I don't think my oven runs cool. Next time I will bake for 1 hr, 15 min.

This is an awesome recipe -- who would think that my boyfriend would request meatloaf??  I just made a few changes.  It's a little too sweet for us, so I cut the brown sugar in half.  I also use grated potato rolls or bread instead of canned bread crumbs, and right before putting the meatloaf into the oven, I spread three strips of raw bacon on the top of it.  I make this all the time -- YUM!

This was very good meatloaf. The brown sugar gives it a nice kick. Maybe it's just me, but I couldn't get it to cook all the way. The middle was still raw after an hour. We had to cook it for 2 1/2 hours. Still very delicious though!

This meatloaf was GREAT.  I made it for my family before making it for my church dinner that I cater each month.  They all raved about it.  The sauce was so tasty...the 50+ members of my church that I served also said it was the best they had ever had.  Even the children loved it...  I made extra sauce to pour over the top.

This was really good.  I put the glaze on the top of the meatloaf as well as the bottom.  It was a little too sweet for me but my husband loved it.  Next time I think I'll just put the glaze on the top!

I have been wanting to try to make a meatloaf for a long time but all the recipes I've seen have had way too many ingredients.. didn't seem worth it.. when I found this one, I decided to give it a try and I definitely was not disappointed!! It was excellent.. I think my search is over!

VERY TASTY!! My four year old was determined to get every bit off his plate. I did make a couple of minor adjustments. I made the meatloaf exactly as the recipe calls. The only thing I did different was pressing the meat into the pan FIRST, then sprinkled enough of the brown sugar to cover the top then spread the ketchup on top of the sugar. I drained off whatever fat had formed after it was done cooking. Thanks Starbuck....this one was a keeper in my book :o)

Delicious!  I made this meat loaf using ground round.  There was very little sauce due to the lean meat, but it was very good and I thought it was a rather healthy meatloaf!  I substituted the 3/4 milk with 1/4 cup skim milk, 1/4 cup soy sauce, 1/4 cup worcestorshire sauce.  Then I deleted the salt. Will definitely make again because my whole family ate it up!

Fantastic! You'll need no other meat loaf recipe than this. I followed some of the other reviewer's advice and put half of the brown sugar mixture on the top, and baked for a little over an hour... perfect.

A definate winner at our table!!!  We loved it!  The only minus to it I guess you could call it, would be that the top layer was a bit dry for some and the bottom was very juicy.  My husband suggested maybe next time I should add a little ketchup to the top of the loaf or something so that it's evenly juicy.  I thought it was great - and as other reviewers have said, I probably wouldn't make any alterations except for maybe the little bit of ketchup over the top of it as my husband suggested.

A great idea! Who would have thought brown sugar! Destine to become a classic in my house. Add about 1/2 hour to time in the oven for perfection.

I wasn't completely sure about this recipe at first, because I had never heard of brown sugar and ginger together with meatloaf, but I loved it!I didn't have the right size loaf pan, so I used two 8" aluminum loaf pans. The only thing I did different was that I added a chopped green pepper, and it came out great!

This recipe is awesome! I took the advice of another reviewer and put half the brown sugar on top and half on the bottom (along w/ the ketchup). Very, very good!

I have enjoyed this recipe over & over again and finally now I MUST take some time to let everyone know NOT to use ANY OTHER MEATLOAF RECIPE!  This is as far as you need to go!  There is no greater compliment than when your significant other tells you that your food is "Better than my mom's!"
Thanks so much, Starbuck!

This was good, but it's hard not to deviate from the meatloaf recipe and chuck your own stuff into it as well...so basically I made my own meatloaf with a brown sugar sauce...I also cut waaaay back on sugar...less than 1/4 cup.  I like it better with just BBQ sauce or ketchup on top.  It was still sweet but not unbearably so.

The best meatloaf ever!!  I was hesitated to make this at first.  Brown sugar didn't sound too tasty for some reason but I was so wrong!  It's very easy to make and is now my favorite recipe!

I don't care for meatloaf, I usually make mine with a brown gravy or sauce and cheese topping because that's the way my family likes it, so I was excited to try this! I just didn't use the onion and split the sauce to cover the top and bottom. I thought it was one of the best meatloafs I ever made but my 2 grown children and hubby didn't like the sweetness. Daughter wouldn't eat it after a few bites and my son and hubby said they liked the old way better.It's so hard to please everyone,even though I thought it was really tasty,I probably wouldn't make again because the family wasn't crazy about it.

YUM.  What else can I say?  Oh, I add a little more onion and some garlic powder.  We're garlic freaks and it helps make it a little more savory and not overly sweet.

This meatloaf recipe was great!  The addition of the brown sugar and ginger made it taste a little different (in a good way) than the standard variety- I also split the ketchup/brownsugar on top and bottom, used seasoned bread crumbs instead of crackers and added green pepper.  Easy to make and very good!

I used venison instead of beef and it was wonderful.  I couldn't detect any "wild" 
taste usually associated with venison.  
I did cook it about 15 minutes longer.

Very tasty meatloaf!  It was very juicy and flavorful. I put half the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom and the other half on the top and it came out wonderful!  I'll definately be making this recipe again!

This really hit the spot when I was in the mood for meatloaf.  I added some garlic, but next time I might add some chopped carrot, too.  I used a meatloaf pan with 2 parts, so I had to put the sugar & ketchup on top, but it was very moist and tasty.  Will make again!

My husband and I love this meatloaf.  It is very easy to make and a grat comfort food.  The second time I made it, I used 1/4 cup of sugar which we liked a bit better.  Either way, a great recipe!!

I thought this was pretty good! It had a nice sweet flavor and I didn't have to drown it in mustard or ketsup like some meatloaf I have had. My husband liked it too, but he didn't think it was THE BEST meatloaf he has ever had. We just got done having the leftovers for lunch and it was pretty yummy. I'd make it again.

I just made this for my husband's family and they all asked for the recipe and said it was the best meatleaf they ever had! I did DOUBLE the brown sugar and ketsup for EXTRA sauce. It was REALLY GREAT!

After reading the other reviews, I had high expectations for this meatloaf.  It was good, but not "to die for".  Per another review, I added mustard and worcestshire sauce to the ketchup mixture, and cut down the brown sugar.  I'll play around with the recipe to get that "zip" that I'm looking for.

This is the best meatloaf I have ever tried.  I did mix the ketchup and brown sugar together first, but 1/2 in bottom of pan and poured the remaining 1/2 on top.  It turned out great.

I only gave it a four cause we are not big meatloaf lovers.  However, this is the best meatloaf I have ever made.  I cooked it a little over 1 hour.  Love the sweetness of the glaze.  After cooling it for about 5-10 min I flipped it over on a serving plate and the glaze was on the top.  Looked great.

WOW!!!! My boyfriend (who hates meatloaf) ate almost the entire thing in one sitting. I really enjoyed it, as well. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I cooked it for 15 minutes longer than indicated (per a previous review). This has become a definite keeper at our house! Thanks for the terrific recipe!

I have never been very successful at making meatloaf but, this turned out great!  I did however, mix the brown sugar and ketchup together and spread on top of the meatloaf.  My 10 year old daughter even liked it.

It was a good meatloaf, although a little too sweet for my familys taste.  Next time I think I will cut the amount of brown sugar by half.

I tried this recipe and it was a little to bland for me. Next time I'll use lawry's instead of salt
more pepper and definetly garlic salt or powder. I did like the the difference the brown sugar made.

I thought this tasted aweful, too sweet and...just strange. The sweetness did not go well with the meatloaf flavor. With all the great reviews, I was expecting a much tastier dish, but was disappointed. I did make changes to the recipe, using Italian seasoned bread crumbs and BBQ sauce, as suggested by many reviewers, instead of crackers and ketchup. I will try again though, since many people did like this recipe, and try using less sugar and with ketchup and crackers as stated in the recipe.

I thought that this was great. Even my 23 month old had 3 helpings. I did however grate 1 potato and carrot into it to add more veggie. It is one that I will make from now on. Thanks

Oh My!  Just when I thought I had been making the best meatloaf all these years, here comes a recipe that is even better!  We all loved the brown sugar and catsup that cooked into the bottom.  Would have made great sandwiches if there had been any leftovers!  I added green (bell) pepper for added flavor.

My family loved this recipe-I was skeptical of the brown sugar...thought it would be too sweet, but it gave it a great bbq flavor, super moist too!  I added a pkg of Lipton Onion Soup Mix to the meat mixture to add more flavor, I mixed the brown sugar, ketchup and 1 TB of worsteshire sauce together and poured it over the top instead of putting it on the bottom.  MMMM-definitely a keeper!

Best Meatloaf I have ever had.  Made this for my husband and my mother-inlaw and they both loved it!  Very moist and was a little nervous from reading some of the other reviews that it would be too sweet.  Not so - I thought it was just right.  I did add a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce to the mix and cooked the meatloaf for about 10 minutes longer.

Great meatloaf with a somewhat unconventional taste. I love the "sweet-n-sour" taste of the brown sugar/ketchup glaze. I will definetly share this recipe.

I am not sure if there is a date on these recipes but this has to be among the first to be posted to allrecipes. I have been making this specific recipe since around 2000.  It is so easy and everyone loves it.

I have been reading through some negative reviews and I realized a lot of them complain that that the sauce is on the bottom. It seems pretty obvious to me but it does not say in the recipe that you are supposed to FLIP THE PAN OVER AND TURN THE MEATLOAF OUT WHEN IT COMES OUT OF THE OVEN. I am not sure if the recipe can be edited or if the original poster can make the change but it should be added as the final step.

I absolutely love this recipe. It’s my go to meatloaf! In my opinion it’s the best I’ve had. It always gets rave reviews! Depending on the amount of hamburger I use, if I add a half pound or so, I just add an egg and a little more ingredients to even the recipe out. It’s a true winner in our household! The meatloaf sandwiches it makes as leftovers are also to die for! Thank you!

So delicious!  The reason I gave it 4 stars rather than the 5 is because of the ketchup and brown sugar placed on the bottom of the pan, meat loaf on top.  When done the meat loaf was nearly floating in (delicious!) juices and I wanted that "topping" on top!  A  mess.  Next time I will  put it on top as usual.

My paw paw asks me to make this just about every week since i started using this recipe! I like to mix the ketchup/brown sugar mixture in the meatloaf rather than putting it on the bottom of the pan; it just adds a little extra flavor in my opinion!!

It was OKAY. Other than the brown sugar, I didn't think this recipe had much flavor... Though based on the 6k reviews, I'm wondering if I did something seriously wrong, or if I expected too much from a loaf made of meat?

Absolutely delicious, made with a mix of chuck and pork, with a bit of anchovy paste and low sodium soy sauce, but other than that and putting the ketchup glaze on top instead of bottom it was made per the instructions. Definitely a staple meal.

This is hands down the BEST meatloaf ever. It is up there with one of the best recipes I have made from this site. I don't care for meatloaf too much but I have made it twice within the last week and plan on making again this weekend. I did make changes as others suggested. I used all of the brown sugar required for the glaze but instead of all ketchup, I used 1/2 sweet baby rays barbecue sauce. I also added 1 tablespoon of worcestershire sauce and 1 teaspoon of dry mustard to the glaze. I also added all of the ingredients of the sauce by sight to the actual meatloaf. I used 1 cup of breadcrumbs instead of crackers,  1/4 cup of milk and 1 egg, more garlic than stated and garlic and onion powder.  I took other reviewers suggestions and did not cook this in a meatloaf pan, I used a large baking dish and did cook it on top of two slices of bread. I also put the glaze on the top and sides of the meatloaf. I really think that makes all the difference in the world. Both times the taste was incredible and it was so moist. I highly recommend this recipe. Yum!!!! Thanks!

My husband loves to cook this recipe and won't even let me help! Love, Love, Love it. He only used 1 pound of hamburger but didn't change the amount of any other ingredients ( unknown to me!).  After baking 1 hour, he placed a plate over the loaf pan and turned it out onto the plate making every slice covered in the brown sugar/ ketchup sauce. Delish! We often make 2 pans, doubled recipe, for meatloaf sandwiches because the first pan disappears at dinner!!

I followed the recipe as is except put the ketchup and brown sugar on top. We really liked it a lot.  We had it as a sandwich the next day and it was still very good.  Will make it again.

I love this recipe. I tweaked it and I use 2lbs of hamburger and I sometimes will put bacon on top of the meatloaf, glaze on top of that.

Was easy to make and really good. Did as other reviewers suggested, and put the ketchup / brown sugar mixture over the top of the meatloaf.  I used a cup of bread crumbs instead of crackers. Only had plain bread crumbs, so seasoned them myself with thyme and rosemary. Turned out to be a great combination. Chopped and added a couple of cloves of garlic in addition to the onion. Took longer than an hour to cook, and used a meat thermometer to make sure it was cooked through. Will definitely make this one again.

Very good..  My family loved that and that is saying something  since we all have different tastes and very rare when we all love the same recipe. 

I made the following changes I read from other reviews.
 I only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar. - I added 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to the ketchup/brown sugar mix. - I used 1/2 cup of milk and 1 egg. - I added 2 cloves of garlic to the meat mixture. Finally, I used a cup of season bread crumbs instead of the crackers. Also I didnt put the sauce on the bottom of the pan and placing the meatloaf on top of it.. I felt it would just burn away. instead I apply to the top of the meatload on the last 15 minutes of cooking.

One of the best meatloafs I have had in a long time.  I read other reviews and tweaked the recipe.  I only used 1/2 c of milk, added 1/4 tsp of ground ginger, heaping spoonful of minced garlic, and 1 Tbsp of Worcestershire sauce in the.  I also added 1 Tbsp of worchestershire sauce in the glaze as well. I also cut down on the glaze and only used 1/4 c of ketchup and brown sugar (with the worcestershire sauce).  I put the loaf on two slices of bread to soak up the grease.  I also put bacon on the top and put the glaze on top of that.  I will put the glaze on the top of the loaf, then bacon, then more glaze next time.  The glaze really does make the meatloaf.  My husband and I LOVE this!

I did not change any of the ingredients. I did put half of the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom of the pan, and half on top of the meatloaf. It was a hit with the whole family! Very tasty.

I am a beginner cook of about 2 weeks and this came out AMAZING...the only changes I made were....I used  3/4 cup ketchup and 1/2 cup brown sugar and since our family usually eats ground turkey instead of beef, I used half turkey and half beef. I like my meatloaf crispy so I cooked it for 40 minutes without glaze, then glazed it and cooked it for 30 more minutes, then sliced it and laid the slices flat on a baking sheet, glazed one side then baked for another 20 minutes.

Mine turned out amazing! I did the recipe as directed except I used organic grass-fed  ground  beef. No grease at all. Ketchup and brown sugar mix worked out perfectly because of it. My Son and I loved it! I will definitely make again.

I agree with the post about putting the ketchup and brown sugar on bottom. the second time I made this put the ketchup and brown sugar on bottom and then made a mixture of ketchup and brown sugar to put on the top. Delicious.

This was a different way to make meatloaf. I always made mines accompanied with brown gravy. So when I saw this recipe I was obliged to try it and I'm glad I did. My family enjoyed the switch as well. So yes I will make this again. Although I did add bread crumbs instead of crackers and I added 1/2 cup of chopped green peppers. I also put the brown sugar and ketchup on top because it made more sense.

I didn't understand the purpose of putting the Catsup and Brown sugar on the bottom so I put it on top. I too cut back on the milk to 1/4 cup (due to mild climate) and used quick oats because I didnt have bread crumbs handy. Other than that it turned out pretty tasty. The best part it didnt fall apart. I hate when that happens.

This is a great recipe! I didn't read the reviews before I made it the first time, so I put the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom, and it turned out fine! Did make a ton of grease, though.

I followed the instructions but it didn't turn out at all. I cooked on 350 for an hour but it still wasn't done so I uped the degrees to 400.  When it was finally done in the middle I took it out and let it cool. It was extremely runny & fell apart. It didn't taste good either. It either had too much milk or not enough bread crumbs. It was just gummy. I found a recipe on yummly a while back that the family likes so I think I'll stick with that one.

Use aluminum at the bottom of the loaf pan to speed up clean-up. Place plain bread on the aluminum, then spread meatloaf on top, so that bread absorbs grease. Lastly, smooth the sugar/ketchup glaze on TOP of the meatloaf- don't put it on the bottom where all the grease is going to be!

Made this today and actually forgot to add the eggs and milk, lol. This STILL turned out GREAT.  This worked WONDERFUL with the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom.  The meat just marinades in it and absorbs the sweetness.  Served with Garlic Mashed Potatoes and "Grandma's Creamy Carrots" . I'll add the recipe for those soon.

Very good meatloaf recipe. I have never done a Brown Sugar Meatloaf so I was pleasantly surprised. My husband, son, and boarder all ate so much they were uncomfortable. Slight changes I made were: I added minced garlic, garlic plus season mix and Club House's Blazin Pepper Bourbon spice to the meatloaf. I also used only 1/2  cup milk and only 1 egg. I mini loafed them and mixed the brown sugar and ketchup and added a teaspoon of worcheshire sauce. I then put half the mix on the bottom, cooked for 25 min., added the rest to the top and cooked for another 10 min.

I have not tried this recipe yet but, I fully intend to.  Speaking from a Meals specialist perspective, a recipe is nothing more than a guide to making something. Making adjustments by adding or subtracting from it makes it your own.

After reading other reviews I made the following adaptations: 1 egg, 1/2 cup milk, 2 cloves of garlic and 3 tsps. of Worchestshire sauce to the brown sugar and ketchup which I put on top. The big change was to add hot Italian sausage (2 links with casing removed) to the ground beef (total still 1 1/2 lbs.). Was really spicy which is how we like it so may want to adjust the amount of hot sausage if you want less spice. Fabulous moist meat loaf with a kick!

This is my go-to meatloaf recipe and it always gets rave reviews! I make it as written with the only real exception being the onions. We don’t like them so I substitute 1/2 package of dried onion soup mix instead. My family doesn’t mind these and you still get that onion flavor which I actually like. Some tips I’ve learned are to  ALWAYS put the brown sugar/ketchup mixture on top and I prefer to use butter crackers (Ritz) instead of plain crackers. I’ve had people that despise meatloaf come back for seconds! Thank you for sharing this family favorite!

As is, I thought it was bland and too sweet. Tasted a lot better after reducing the sugar to 1/4 cup, reducing the milk to 1/3 cup, adding more pepper, adding minced garlic, adding Worcestershire sauce and substituting seasoned bread crumbs for the saltine crackers. That's too much tweaking though.

I always get great compliments on this meatloaf. I make it with ground turkey, and substitute wheat toast for saltines. I also add oregano and Dijon mustard. I flip the pan over to serve and spoon the juice back over the top. Don't overcook!

made this last night, it was very easy. The flavors were good. My 21 year old son devoured it. I made it exact but next time I will tweek it a bit. I prefer buffalo because it is leaner and less grease mixed with ground pork. maybe add in garlic and basil for a bit more flavor and omit the milk. thank you for sharing. Loved the topping, I might get creative and put it in the middle of the loaf since it seemed to absorb into the loaf anyway.

I made this tonight and it was great.  I watched the video because I was skeptical with the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom.  It worked great.  I lifted my meatloaf out and sliced it on a platter and the sauce was amazing.  I drizzled it over the top and served. I used 2 lbs. of ground sirloin, green onions, and plain bread crumbs because this is what I had. Everything else was the same and used the same measurements.  Thanks for the great recipe, family loved it!!!

Meatloaf is tricky sometimes. I put two slices of bread in bottom to soak up grease and only added 1/4 cup of milk. Was wonderful!!

I used 1 lb. of meatloaf mix and 1/2 lb. ground beef. I put the brown sugar and the ketchup on the top and doubled the amount called for. I cooked it for and hour and fifteen minutes. It was delicious. My husband really liked it, said it my best effort yet. He even enjoyed it again a few days later!  It's a keeper!!

I am not a cook by any sense of the word, but man was this recipe good. I always hated meatloaf but this was delicious, even as a leftover. I placed two pieces of white bread underneath to soak up the grease and it made for a swifter cleanup. I also spread the ketchup/brown sugar glaze on top rather than the bottom. Next time I will layer it top and bottom.

I'm a big game eater up here in Alaska so I had to try this with some moose I harvested this fall.......BOOM! I followed the advice that was given by everyone and wow! The flavor was a amazing! Not to mention my wife kept coming back for more! I was worried that it would be dry due to game meat not have a ton of fat in it but it just came out a moist as any other meatloaf I've had or made! Very pleased!

I really like this recipe. I took some of the alterations suggested in the reviews, adding a bit of Worcestershire to the glaze, using only 1 egg, baking it in a glass baking dish so I could drain the grease (there was a fair amount of it), and I saved some glaze to pour over the top (baked for 45 min, added glaze to the top, baked for 15 min longer). Next time, I'll add more spices to the actual loaf. Another reviewer suggested garlic, I would recommend spicing it more than what the recipe calls for. Nonetheless, it went over very well and the glaze was delicious.

One of my husbands favorite dishes. I know a lot of people say that they put the brown sugar on top... No need to do that. The meatloaf sucks up all the sweetness through the bottom as it cooks. Makes is like meat candy. ;) the only change I make is not greasing the pan. I find all the natural juices keep it from sticking at all. Love this recipie!!

It was good but we did not care for the ginger in it. I also had to reduce the amount of brown sugar and add Worcestershire sauce to the glaze. I also added garlic. If I wouldn't have made those changes it would be a 3 star. I loved how it held together and how moist it was, though.

I didn't read the reviews before making this or I would have done the brown sugar ketchup (piquant sauce) on top; normally I browse them but I was kind of in a hurry to get dinner started; I only had a 1-lb chub of GB so I went with less of everything; I used onion powder because of picky eaters and added a few dashes of Worcestershire and paprika, salt, pepper, garlic powder; I moistened with the 2 eggs and enough ketchup (didn't measure just squirted) and skipped the milk because I like firm meatloaf not squishy... Flavor was good and the family ate it... ;)  Thx

Exactly as written I'd rate it 4 stars.  It's a very good recipe and so tasty.  My complaints are, and may just be personal taste, but the brown sugar and ketchup bottom is a little too sweet for my taste (an easy fix with less sugar next time) and the mix was very wet (again an easy fix with more cracker crumbs or bread crumbs or less milk next time).  Definitely something I'd make again with only a few modifications for our taste.

Followed others advice and put the ketchup and brown sugar on top. I also put a couple slices of bread in the bottom to soak up the grease.

I took a suggestion from another reviewer and made the mini meatloafs. I put the brown sugar mixture on the bottom of the tin and when it came time to pour some of the mixture on top, all I saw was grease bubbling up and all over my oven. I put a cookie sheet underneath and baked them the rest of the time. I have to say tho, despite all the grease and what little sauce was left, they were very good. I don't understand what happened but the next time I make it I will definitely make a loaf.

I have made this recipe repeatedly. It is exactly what I wanted when I was looking for those good old fashioned nostalgic meatloaf flavors. I always add a little Worcestershire in with the meat. Thank you to whoever recommended a meatloaf pan. My husband begs me to make this!

As written, this meatloaf recipe did not work for me.  Cooking it in a loaf pan meant that it was cooking in its own grease with the resulting being a very mushy and very wet loaf.  The spice mixture was also unimpressive.

This is a household favorite... Although we have made a few changes. We omit the brown sugar and use a Sriracha based top. Then we serve it with rice and a fried egg which gives it a decadent Hawaiian twist.

Simply the best meatloaf recipe. We now use ground turkey instead of hamburger. I've added to the cooking time in order to get the loaf to 170 degrees internal temp. I've added a little extra milk to keep the loaf moist with the added time. So good!

I should have followed the recipe to the T, but i have made a similar one and knew it needed a bit more. I added one pack of onion soup mix, one carrot shredded, one onion, one stalk of celery chopped very fine. 3/4 of a cup of oats as I didn't have crackers, Montreal steak spice, 3 cloves of garlic. For the sauce I used catsup, steak sauce, a bit of bbq sauce and some dried mustard. This was the best meatloaf I have ever made. I also reduced the amount of milk to 1/2 a cup

Well I kind of didn't read the cooking instructions thoroughly and made the mistake of mixing all the ingredients together including the catsup and brown sugar. It was pretty darn good and everyone had seconds. Go figure! I would do it all again next time except cut back on the sugar to 1/3 or 1/4 cup. 
Thanks for the recipe. Came in handy!

I had never made meatloaf before, and this recipe was easy to follow! I scooped the raw meatloaf mixture in to muffin tins to make minis, and topped them off with a dollop of mashed potatoes for an instant classic! Unlike so many other recipes here, this one was perfect as is and I don't recommend adding anything, though I did top off the meatloaf with the sauce instead of placing it at the bottom

HI,
Cooking---I do little of! Microwave ovens ---I love!
The Brown sugar meatloaf piqued my interest--so I just finished baking it this afternoon.
Very different--very good! I also made a few changes after reading the reviews. Only a little "sauce" on the bottom--rest on top. I added some red pepper flakes AND some Chili powder,too. ( maybe a bit too much!!!)

Will make again only less chili & pepper flakes. Would also cut back on the brown sugar. Other than that---I enjoyed. As a non-cook---simple is good.

Thanks,
John B

Yum! This is the best meatloaf I have ever made. I mixed the ketchup, brown sugar, and a dash of Worcestershire sauce together, put a little in the bottom of the pan and the rest on top of the meatloaf. My hubby loved it too!

Awesome! But I did make a few changes - I used ground turkey instead of beef.  I combined the sugar/ketchup together, added garlic powder, worcestershire and crushed red pepper flakes and spooned it on top of the loaf. Instead of baking in a loaf pan, I shaped it like a loaf and baked it in a 8x8 greased dish which I think cooks it more evenly and cut down on the cooking time (aprox 40 min). I will def make this again!

This turned out delicious.  Like some other folks, I added a couple cloves of garlic and used1/2 cup of milk and one egg.  I also added a teaspoon of Worcester and some ketchup to the hamburger.  I topped it off with a little ketchup and brown sugar before I put it in the oven.  I will be making this one again.

I made it exactly as written thinking my kids would like the sweetness of it, but we didn't like it at all.  Mom's Best Meatloaf (on this site) is much better and is now our go-to meatloaf.

I have the pickiest boys ever and this is the *only* meatloaf recipe I use. They like it so much, that I make two loaves, just so there is a chance at leftovers. I don't put the sugar/ketchup in the pan though.. I mix a couple of Tbsp into the meat and then spread the rest on top instead. Yummmm!!!

I have made some changes. I use bread crumbs and onion soup mix instead of crackers and onions. Then I put the meat in a 9x13 pan and then add ketchup and brown sugar. I've been making this for a long time and my husband loves it. I used to bake it but since I bought my husband a smoker I smoke it for 45 mins then put on the ketchup and brown sugar. I don't measure those just eyeball it cause the sugar the first time was too much.  My family loves this!

Made this exactly as the recipe states, except I used a beed, pork, and veal mixture and I cooked it in a 13x9 pan.  It was yummy

I have never been able to make a good meatloaf.  This recipe is great.  My meatloaf turned out wonderfully.  HOWEVER, I have to say that I have since altered it somewhat.  I now use 1/3 C. brown sugar (the original a little too sweet for me). I also use ground turkey and egg-beaters instead of the whole eggs.  This reduces the calorie content somewhat.  Also, I have used salsa instead of ketchup giving the meatloaf a snap.

I accidently mixed the ketchup and brown sugar in with the meat first and then added all the rest of the ingredients, I had to add another 3/4 lb of burger because the base recipe with my mistake was to soupie. The extra burger firmed it up like it should be.  I used cupcake tins and spooned a dent in the meatloaf ball then filled it with BBQ sauce. Baked for about 45 minutes, served it with mashed potato's, corn and rolls. My family loved it.  My experience with making meatloaf has always been to throw everything in and mix it up.  This recipe was excellent the way I made it.

Amazing!! I always used to put the ketchup and brown sugar on the top but with this recipe having it on the bottom is great!! While it's cooking the mixture boils up into the meatloaf making it so sweet, moist and amazing!!!

I followed the instruction and this was ok. The glaze was good but the meatloaf lacked flavor. Could have used more salt, pepper. Needs garlic and celery. Will try again adding more seasoning.

As a college kid struggling with cooking, I must say.. This is extremely easy to make and even more delicious to taste! The tweaks I made were: adding worcestershire sauce to both the meat and the glaze, cutting the brown sugar and milk by about half. oh and using breadcrumbs instead of the saltine crackers.

Excellent meatloaf!  I took the recommendations of others and cut the amount of milk to 1/3 of a cup and also put the brown sugar and ketchup on top.  In addition, I mixed the brown sugar and ketchup together with 2 T. of Worcestershire sauce.  Next time, I believe I'll chop up a bit of jalapeno and mix in with the meat mixture.

I substituted Italian Bread crumbs instead of crackers. Bring the brown sugar and ketchup up the sides of the meat loaf dish, you get crusted goodness.

Loved this recipe. I as well added only 1 egg and a quarter cup of milk. I added Worcestershire sauce once I combined the ketchup and brown sugar together.  However, I layered the sauce. Instead of putting the mixture on the bottom, I put half of the meat mixture down first, half of the sauce mix, the other half of meat mixture and then finished it off with the remaining sauce. Excellent recipe!

Very good, very tasty.  I followed the recipe to a T, and mine came out a little runny for my liking.  Don't get me wrong, still very tasty, but I must have required more time in the oven - and, I went over about five minutes to get the internal temp up to where it needed to be.  The next time I do it, I will likely go with the brown sugar and ketchup on top instead and see how that does.  Thank you for your recipe!

This meatloaf was amazing!!  I needed comfort food on this rainy day and picked this recipe based on the reviews!  The only thing I changed was splitting the brown sugar sauce by layering half  the mixture on the bottom of the pan and pouring the rest on top over the meatloaf.  What was nice is that you had the taste of the brown sugar sauce in the meatloaf  when it was done.  If you wanted a little more flavor you could pour the gravy mixture that forms on the bottom of the pan over the meatloaf and mashed potatoes (which goes so well together) along with a nice glass of red wine!!   Make sure you don't omit the ground fresh ginger....it adds that extra flavor!!  I will definitely be making this dish again!  The family loved it even my two pugs got a taste ha!!  Thank you!!!

This was yummy! Based on reviews I decreased the milk to 1/2 cup and the brown sugar to 1/4 cup. The last time I made it, I added chopped green pepper. I also subbed in bread crumbs because I didn't have the other ingredient.  It is really great and easy to make. My daughter, who normally doesn't like "sweet meat" had two servings.

This was definately a great starter recipe. I agree with a lot of other reviews that this was just missing something. I'm going to experiment and see if I can figure out what I could add. Also, the glaze of brown sugar and ketchup was great! (I like mine a little sweet) but I didn't like it being on the bottom. I lost a  lot of the glaze due to the fat drippings mixing in. Overall a good recipe, and I will make it again with some adjustments.

Thought this was a wonderful tasting meatloaf.  I did not like the mixture on the bottom as I personally like the glaze on top; which I will try next time.  BUT I DID add some back slices on the top & then sprinkled brown sugar on the bacon & the flavor from the bottom and top made such a great taste.  Good!  Will use again in future for a different flavored meatloaf.

First time using cracker crumbs in my meatloaf....I've always used bread crumbs.  The crackers made it very good ...I did however mix the ketchup and brown sugar and spread across the top......my usual topping for all meatloafts.I also added ground sage and mustard powder to the meatloaf. Very good.

I have rooked this recipe neuromuscular of times, and I love it! Super easy to prep, and the over does the rest. I will have to say, if you don't cook it long enough, the brown sugar and ketchup will no stick to the meatloaf. I cook it for about 5-6 mins extra just to be safe. This recipe is my favorite to cook, and everyone loves it! I'm cooking this tonight for me and my guest!

This has become my very favorite meatloaf recipe. My husband and 3 boys all love it and it makes for great meatloaf sandwiches the next day. I have made it exactly as the recipe calls and loved it! I have also modified it a few times and it is just as delicious not matter what I add. 
Mod 1: Wrap it in bacon and put the ketchup/sugar on top.
Mod 2: Add mushrooms
Mod 3: Mix the brown sugar and ketchup and coat the whole thing before baking.

I will never make another meatloaf recipe!

I used this recipe twice. It's a good thing I reduced the sugar the first and second time because it would've been too sweet. This is a wonderful recipe though! My family loved it!!! Thanks for sharing!!!

I made this with 80/20 ground beef, 1 1/2 dried hamburger buns instead of crackers, 1/2 c. milk, garlic salt instead of salt and a shake of Worcestershire.

The sugar/ketchup should definitely be on top.  The meatloaf was very juice and flavorful.  I'll make it again esp. with 93% lean.

I have made this meatloaf several times for my family. The flavor has always been wonderful, although a bit too moist, as is. This is my favorite meatloaf recipe and I used to HATE meatloaf. This time around, I did make some changes as other reviewers have suggested. Less milk, less brown sugar, couple dashes of worcestershire sauce, and Ritz crackers instead of Saltines. Also, seasoning salt instead of regular salt. I wanted to at least put my two cents in because I am awful about posting reviews, but felt this one deserved 5 stars, even without any alterations.

This was delicious, I did make a few changes by using 2 lbs of lean ground beef, adding about a tsp of minced garlic, using more saltine crumbs &ketchup IN the meatloaf mix, and lightly rubbing the top with brown sugar/squirting ketchup decoratively across as well! I took it out of the oven three or four times to baste and drain juices and it came out wonderful, the whole family loved it...even my picky four year old said it was her favorite!

I haven't tried it yet but I have it in the oven and I tweeked it a little. I doubled it, 2 lb3/s ground beef and 1 lb pork sausage. I ran out of bread crumbs so I used half ritz, half bread crumbs. I didn't have ginger, so I used allspice. I used onion soup mix, 1 and 1/2 packages, and 1 and 1/2 tsp of salt and 1 cup milk. I mixed the sauce to put on top of the meatloaf for the last 15 mins or so, I used 3/4 cup brown sugar and one cup catsup and 2 tbls worstershire sauce. We'll see how it tastes later!

Like others I made some modifications. We like a little kick so I added half a jalapeño finely chopped and for the sauce I did 1/3 saracha with the ketchup. Like others, I put the sugar and sauce at the top vs the bottom. I only used 1/2 cup of milk. I also added cumin, oregano, 2 cloves of crushed garlic and parsley to the meat and used bread crumbs instead of the crackers. It turned out great with lots of flavour!!!

Added 1 packet of instant oatmeal 1 chopped mini sweet yellow pepper and 2 chopped tomatoes and a little garlic powder. Also added a tablespoon of mustard and bbq sauce to ketchup and mixed the brown sugar with it to make a sauce I didn't use a loaf pan I formed it and put it in a case role dish and brushed sauce on top of it. So awesomely delicious!  My husband absolutely loved it. 5 stars with these additions.

This lacked flavor.....In addition to the onions, I added chopped carrots, green and red peppers. For the seasoning I added some garlic, and cayenne pepper. Finally for the sauce I added some mustard for a kick plus extra of my altered sauce to the milk egg mixture. The flavors popped and my husband is now a fan.

I do NOT like meatloaf most of the time and neither do my kids (2 boys, ages 4 and 11), but I decided to make this anyway because all I had defrosted was ground beef.  We are also not hamburger sort of people and I get so sick of making tacos, too.  Boring.  I am leery of making meatloaf because every recipe I have tried, it turns out just gross.  But again, I tried this recipe anyway to mix things up and WOW......it turned out GREAT!  I loved it, my kids loved it, my boyfriend loved it (you see the pattern lol).  It may have been better if I had all the ingredients, though.  I didn't have onion or ground ginger and for the crackers,  I only had Ritz, so I just used that.  Anyway, it was still really good.  There were NO LEFTOVERS!  That has never happened before.  Best meatloaf recipe ever.  I will double the brown sugar and ketchup next time.  The loaf itself wasn't dry or anything, I just love the sauce so much.

Absolutely love this recipe and so does my family.  They were asking when we were having it again the first time I made it ;)
The 763 mg of sodium per serving was alarming to me so the ONLY changes I made were omitting the 1.5 tsp salt, using low sodium soda crackers, and low sodium ketchup.

We had this for dinner this evening,  I changed it up a little. I combined the brown sugar and ketchup in a separate bowl and put half of it on top before putting it in the oven. Then the other half about 10 min before it's finished. Yum.

Both my picky 6 and 8 year old absolutely loved the taste of this meatloaf. I made this in mini loaf pans and I came out with eight perfect sized loaves.  I would recommend mixing the brown sugar and ketchup with a Tbsp mustard and glazing the top of the meatloaf with it rather than using it as a base.  Otherwise fantastic flavor!  My husband was actually disappointed when we were out of leftovers!

Very delicious! You could definitely taste the brown sugar and it tastes so sweet and delectable! Since I didn't have any saltines I used Ritz crackers instead, worked out perfectly!

I loved this meatloaf! It came out juicy, and a bit sweet. 
The prepping stage was quick and easy. Also, I covered the baking pan with aluminum foil during the baking process to keep the meatloaf from getting dry 
As the other reviewers may have mentioned , I also recommend adding the glaze on top the the meatloaf.

My husband and I had bad childhood experiences with meatloaf, but wanted to try.  We followed the instructions, except substituting 20oz of ground turkey for the ground beef (healthier) and using breadcrumbs instead of crackers (easier).  It was delicious.  Our daughters asked us to make it again.
We put the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom (as the direction showed) and after lifting the loaf from the pan, collected the sauce and placed it on the table so everyone could help themselves.
MyFitnessPal shows the recipe as having 216 calories, 7g of fat, 17 protein, and 24 carbs when we divide it into 8 servings, which was good.  Definitely going to repeat this recipe.

Loved it.  I used venison.  I mixed the ketchup and brown sugar together  first and added about half of it to the meat mixture and poured the rest over the top before baking.

I also am a person who doesn't love meatloaf, but my hubby does so I wanted to make it for him. I used the mods that other reviewers suggested including less milk (1/2 cup), less sugar (1/4 cup), 1 egg, added worcester to both glaze and meatloaf, added garlic, and I always use extra lean beef. It came out pretty good but the onion, garlic, and ginger did not cook and soften enough so next time I will sauté them in a pan first. I used the bread at the bottom of the loaf but with extra lean ground beef there wasn't much fat to drain off so it wasn't needed. Next time I will put half sauce on the bottom and glaze the loaf with the rest. I also made more sauce on the stove to serve on the side and added a tablespoon of maple syrup for extra depth in flavor. My hubby loved it, he ate half the loaf! I also enjoyed it but will like it better next time when I sauté the garlic/onion/ginger.

VERY IMPORTANT - SOAK SALTINES IN MILK FIRST!! It seriously makes ALL the difference. We love this recipe, I do add a packet of onion soup mix, free-form the loaf on a parchment-lined jelly pan, and put the ketchup mixture (with a couple dashes of Worcheshire) on top. Both my husband and I LOVE this recipe!

This recipe is super good. I followed another review to bake it in muffin tins... My children call them meatballs...i doesn't matter, as long as they eat them. I use panko seasoned bread crumbs instead of crackers... yummi :)

I agree with some that the sauce needs to be spread over the top...like in the picture.  Otherwise the sauce soaks in with the fat and is not pretty.  I also use a couple slices of bread in the bottom to absorb the fat.  Its still a once every 2 week must have at our home in Southern Oregon. Thanks for sharing!

I think this is going to become our meatloaf standard.  Gone are the days of meatloaf with oats.  Saltines are awesome!  Made a free form meatloaf in a 9x13 pyrex dish then covered with the ketchup followed by the brown sugar.  Loved it!  Not a bit leftover for this family of 6!

I really enjoyed this recipe and followed it exactly but did add some worcestershire sauce to the top about 1/2 thru cooking. However, the  "telling" may be in the leftovers, LOL. 
The next time, I will include garlic and a little less milk and I like the idea of using bread in the bottom of the pan to soak up grease. I removed the grease from the brown sugar/ketchup cooking juice and it made a sweet topping for mashed potatoes etc.

Outstanding. Ginger takes it over the top. Mixed the brown sugar and ketchup and put it on the top. Other than that followed the directions as written. Will try it on the bottom next. I don't think it matters.

This was quick and easy to make. I added 1/2 of a chopped green pepper.  Used seasoned Italian bread crumbs in place of the crackers. Used BBQ sauce in place of the ketchup.  I did put the BBQ sauce on top then sprinkled the brown sugar on top of the BBQ sauce. When finished I drained the drippings and made gravy with it.  It was delicious with the meatloaf. Served with mashed potatoes and peas.  I did have to cook about 10 minutes longer.  Excellent dish.

My family loved this recipe but I did alter it a bit by increasing the ingredients: used 1 1/2 cup of oatmeal instead of crackers; increased ginger to 1 1/2 teaspoon; large onion; 1 teaspoon garlic powder; 1 teaspoon of red pepper flake and also used ground turkey instead of beef. In all, pretty good.

This was amazing! I did use some of the other suggestions. I did 1/2 cup milk and 1/3 cup br. sugar. I put the sauce on top of the meatloaf after 30 min in the oven. My husband said it was the best meatloaf he's ever had! This is a keeper!

I have been using this recipe for about a year now, and my family thinks it's the ONLY meatloaf there is.  Have tried a few others, but keep going back to this one.  (My husband took one of my metal loaf tins, and drilled holes in the bottom of it, and I sit it inside a second one with the meat loaf in it, to catch any excess liquid and grease.  Skim the grease off, and use the liquid over rice!)

This recipe has been in my family for generations. We use 15oz can of tomato sauce instead of ketchup, mix tomato sauce and brown sugar together pour 1/2 cup of tomato mixture with loaf mix instead of milk, mix well, form into loaf pan cook 40 minutes or until juices run clear then pour remaining tomato sauce mixture to make a glaze the last 20 minutes, also you could add 2 teaspoons of vinegar and 1 teaspoon of yellow mustard instead of ginger. Optional

Very good and will definitely use this recipe again. Loved the overall sweetness. Used Italian bread crumbs instead of saltines. My husband said it was maybe the best hes ever had and my picky 4 year old cleaned his plate.

I agree that the brown sugar/catsup should be on top.  Also, I add honey & some cayenne pepper to it. It makes a zingy crispy glaze. I think the honey makes it crisp up.

I also add honey and cayenne pepper. Also put the glaze on top.
The honey makes the glaze get a little crisp.
Everyone I serve this to loves it and asks for the recipe.

Let me start by saying, I hate meatloaf. It's a big boring slab of ground beef with ketchup on it. With THIS recipe though, I love it!! 

We followed the ingredients but we added some Worcestershire sauce to the meat and the glaze. Then added the glaze to the top of the meatloaf instead of the bottom.

I also read a tip about putting bread under your meatloaf so when you cook it all the grease soaks up - and it worked great!

This will be a new staple in our home!

Amazing!  Mixing the brown sugar and ketchup with a bit of Worcestershire sauce was the only edit I made and it was the best meatloaf I'd ever eaten!

Tried the recipe as is and it's good kid friendly. But I free form my loaf on cookie sheet so it's not swimming in grease (youtube alton meatloaf) and the brown sugar/ketchup glaze can go all around the loaf....yumm

I made this recipe for my husband who loves meatloaf... he said this was the best dish I've ever cooked for him. He ate 1/2 the pan all by himself! Really good. For me it was a little too sweet but still good. I also put the brown sugar/ketchup on top and not on bottom.

This was practically inedible to me.  I used half the amount of brown sugar and it was still too sweet, and waaaaay too much onion.  Didn't like it at all.

We loved this!  My boyfriend said it was the best meatloaf he ever had! I enjoyed it too!  I did not have the ginger, but added a little Worcestershire instead. We both do not like onions, so I added 1/2 red pepper (chopped) and 1/2 cups of thinly sliced celery.  I also put the ketchup and brown sugar mixture on top.  Delicious!

My family LOVES this. They call it "The Meatloaf". I did follow the suggestion of a few other raters and put the ketchup/brown sugar on the top before cooking. It is absolutely delicious.

I love meatloaf and this is my new favorite recipe. Used a round casserole dish to bake it and the sugar mixture divided between the top and bottom. Added garlic and Worcestershire to the meat mixture. Served with mashed potatoes and it was the BEST. Make it--you'll like it!

This is a great meatloaf recipe. I added about 1/4 - 1/2 teaspoon of minced ginger, minced garlic and a few dashes of worcestershire sauce. I also put the ketchup and brown sugar on top instead of the bottom. It turns out awesome every single time!

Meatloaf has always been a comfort food to me but my husband HATES it. I made this one night and didn't tell him until it was done. He tried it w a cringe in his face and LOVED it! Now I can actually suggest meatloaf for dinner and he's happy to have it. The only difference I made was that I put the mixture on top instead.

We really liked this, but it left a TON of grease in the pan. Next time I'll probably place a couple of slices of bread down in the pan. Also, I added one tablespoon of worchestire sauce to the ketchup, and put that and the brown sugar on top of the meatloaf instead of underneath. I used a cup of Italian bread crumbs instead of crackers, only a 1/2 cup of milk, added chopped garlic cloves and omitted the ginger. I would probably make this again.

It was delicious! I read some reviews about the bottom of the loaf coming out hard, and not very tasty. So I baked mine in a glass pan, it boiled the sugar and oils from the meat, and spread the flavor throughout! And the brown sugar makes it sweet, but not to sweet!

Very delicious!! I mixed the brown sugar and ketchup together in a bowl and placed on the bottom of 12 muffin pans, put the meat in for 30 minutes, then put the rest of the glaze on top for 15 minutes. Came out delicious!

Love, it.  I, too, opted to use the brown sugar and ketchup on top vs. on the bottom and I would add a green bell pepper next time - an ingredient my mom always uses in her homemade meatloaf.  :)

I love this recipe! It has been my go-to recipe for over 7 years, and I always recommend it to people. I do put a little extra ketchup on top of the meatloaf. If I'm running short on time, I used dried minced onions for flavor. Also, I use a mixture of crackers, bread crumbs, and/or oatmeal instead of just crackers.

4 stars because i adjusted some things. First off i put the brown sugar coating on top no bottom. To the brown sugar mixture i added 1tbspn worceshtire sauce and only 1/4 cup brown sugar. Also i only cooked it for 40 minutes, 1 hour will make it dry. The smart thing to do is pat the meat together,make it into a loaf and put it in a bigger pan than the actual loaf. That way, every 15 minutes you pour the grease back on the meat. It will be extra juicy. The brown sugar glaze is so delicious. Enjoy.

I made this recipe exactly as it was written, adding only 1 TB Worcestershire sauce.  It was fabulous - a cross between meatloaf and barbecue.  My daughter said, "Mom, you have outdone yourself - again.".  Need I say more?

I have saved this recipe for a long while and have been making it for about a yr now. (It was so easy, I made it as a novice new wife). My husband likes it better than his mom's (YES, he actually said that!) and he asks me to make 2 loaf pans, so I double the ingredients. (That way, he has 1 whole loaf pan to himself). I make it as is and do not alter a thing.

Followed other recommendations to cut the brown sugar and put the sauce on top. Also used the onion soup mix and put the bread slices in the bottom of the pan, which kept a nice even consistency. I'm not a big meatloaf person and I enjoyed it but still looking for that perfect recipe. Husband loved it.

This meatloaf is outstanding.  It is reminiscent of what my mother made when we were children.  The ground ginger makes it especially delicious.  Even my picky ones love it.  We have one baking now, and the aroma is delectable.  (addendum:  I keep coming back to this recipe and make it again and again.  It is exceptional.  Only thing needed to change in this recipe is that I put the ketchup and brown sugar on top as opposed to the bottom.)

This is my go to meatloaf recipe. I do it as is except I do not add the onions because I usually don't feel like going through the trouble for something I'm not overly fond of. The meatloaf is still really good. The only other modification I've ever made was when I didn't have my loaf pan, I just formed the meat mixture into a loaf shape and put it on a cookie sheet then mixed the ketchup and brown sugar together (since I could not put it on the bottom this way) and actually it came out better.

I really like this recipe. I am not an experienced cook, but when I made this my boyfriend said it was the best meatloaf he ever had. I have made it a few times now and it is really yummy every time.

I have made this meatloaf for years, however, mine has a few alternations: I mince one potato and add it to the mix.  I also mix in the brown sugar verses placing on the bottom of the pan.  I make it with or without ketchup depending on the audiences preference...additionally, I use this mixture for the stuffing of bell peppers and get a million raves.....

Overall a very good meatloaf, however it was missing something.  As the mixture sat in the bowl, I couldn't pick up an aroma of seasoning with my sniffer.  I tossed in a heaping tablespoon of parsley, a teaspoon of sage, and a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce.  These additions made all the difference for a savory loaf.  I would suggest to others that you put the brown sugar and ketchup mixture on top, rather than on the bottom.  I'm not sure why anyone would want to have a pool of fat draining down into those ingredients.  Definitely their meant as a glaze, which I didn't add until about 10 minutes before the meatloaf was done.  Boost the oven temperature to 375 degrees and you will get a beautiful caramelized topping that glistens and adds to the overall experience of sweet and savory.  I give this a solid five stars with these changes.

In a separate small bowl, I mixed 1/2 cup ketchup and 1/4 cup brown sugar ( with a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce ); was used to cover the TOP of meatloaf the last 15 minutes of baking--proved to be a good call. Scaled down milk to 1/4 cup, too; another good call!! 1/3 cup chopped onions / 1/4 cup bread crumbs ( just to be safe ). Remember to PREPARE ( use Pam spray )your meatloaf pan. The using 2 bread slices on pan bottom is a time honored old-school trick that works ( still had plenty of pan drippings, though . Even if my family didn't care for that idea, it didn't stop them from happily raving how good THIS meatloaf recipe is--and they hardly ever compliment on my cooking!!

As a child, meatloaf was served for dinner so much that I avoided for many years as an adult. I believe I tried it again at Boston Market and I loved the flavor. Wanting to make a meatloaf similar in flavor at home was a long-time consideration but I never found a recipe that I would work.  This one is it!!! I questioned the ketchup and brown sugar glaze but it was a perfect compliment to the meat. I added a bit of onion powder, garlic powder and white pepper.  My husband and kids loved it!  Making it again tonight!!! Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

Very good meatloaf.  I tried the hint of placing bread on the bottom of the pan before adding meat mixture. This really absorbed the fat and was no problem taking loaf out of the pan. I crushed herb seasoned stuffing mix to equal  3/4 cup instead of crackers and reduced the amount of ketsup and brown sugar to 1/4 cup each.  I put this on top but not until the last 20 minutes.  I still had leftover sauce.  This is a keeper. We both liked it.   Abbagran

reviewed other people's suggestions (thanks for sharing) and was pretty successful the first time, but it was a little too sweet and salty for our taste.  after more tweaks the second time, it was on point!

mix:
added Lipton onion soup mix.  used only 1/2 tsp salt (since using soup mix).  KEEP fresh onion.  use Progresso garlic and herb bread crumbs instead of saltine crumbs.

sauce:
1/4 cup brown sugar instead of 1/2 cup
1/8 cup ketchup, 3/8 cup of spicy UFC (Filipino Banana Sauce), 2 tbsp of Worstechire, and many good squirts of Sriracha (adds a nice, slow kick).

cook:
use 4/5 of sauce IN MIX (you don't need much to top it later on).  bake 50 min.  then DRAIN the grease (i'm surprised this wasn't suggested that much.  tried using slice bread at bottom but you end up with gooey, soggy mess of grease at the bottom you have to remind people NOT to eat.  better just to drain it out).  added rest of sauce on top and let it drip down to cover the side of the loaf (should have shrunk by now).  bake final 20 min to get nice, almost caramelized crust on top.

There isn't anything special about this meatloaf.  It's rather bland with only onions and breadcrumbs to flavor the meat.  I wouldn't make it again. Also, it didn't hold together.

I made this for my mother and myself and loved it, put the brown sugar/ketchup mix on top instead of on the bottom. I think the next time Im gonna but it on the top,bottom and sides because the mix is the best part also put less onions then stated.

Very good. I put 2 slices of bread in the bottom of the loaf pan (great idea)Put the glaze on top. Used onion soup mix which was very good I would not hesitate to do it again but I would have preferred green pepper and onion. Reduced the milk to 1/2 cup(perfect). Next time I will line the pan with foil. The glaze was very very sticky and I had to soak the pan.

Loved it! I've been on a mission to find the perfect meatloaf and this comes very close! I am going to add about two tablespoons of spicy mustard to the glaze (which I poured on top of a formed loaf in a baking dish) to make it more tangy, less sweet.  Very moist and delicious though!

This just didn't do it for my family.  Even though I cut down on the brown sugar and ketchup, it was still too sweet.  And the onion taste was a bit too overpowering.

This meatloaf was delicious.......I, also, put ketchup mixture on top after 30 minutes of cooking.  I used ground venison so I had no grease to drain.  Yum....I will be using this recipe for a long time to come.

Great! I chose this to try for my kids. I should have diced the onion more into smaller pieces or browned them. I loved the taste but my kids noticed the onion.I didn't have brown sugar so I used white sugar and added a bit of maple syrup, cinnamon and clove/all spice. I also didn't do the sugar on the bottom. I put the mixture into a muffin pan and put a bit of the ketchup (didn't use the full amount in the recipe) on top.

Super meatloaf! I got a little overzealous putting ingredients into the bowl and before I knew it, I'd mixed the brown sugar, ketchup glaze into the whole she-bang. Oops. Oh well. It still came out beyond delicious. I stuffed it into green bell peppers and baked for an hour. I did reduce brown sugar to 1/4 cup and milk to 1/2 cup per other reviews. Will definitely be making this again. As a side dish, I made the sweet potato and onion recipe from this site. Fantastic all the way around!

Really really good basic meatloaf.  Used 4% fat hamburger and egg substitute for a lower cholesterol meal.  Left out the ginger and the brown sugar for a really basic one that my father and boyfriend really loved.

This was really yummy, but I think on the bottom of pan would have been a mess. So I did as reviewer suggested and put brown sugar and ketchup on the top of the meatloaf. It was delish - Thank you for sharing your recipe !!

Usually don't like meatloaf, but tried this for a change and it was the bomb.  Everyone liked it.  I didn't have any ginger, but added 2 tsp of worcestershire sauce.

I didn't love this one as much as my husband did.  I have made it several times cause he'll ask for it on occasion. The brown sugar definitely makes it a little different, but in a good way!

Yes, and it does taste as well as it smells!!!, I just added the Italian seasoning and 1/4 cup of bbq sauce to my ground beef, and replaced the crackers with bread crumbs...oh and instead of ketchup I used bbq sauce it was great!

I've made this for my husband 4-5 times now and he loves it!  I always put the ketchup and brown sugar on top, but besides that, I make this recipe as is!  Even I like it and I'm not a huge meatloaf fan.

Grandson loves it, and he's not a fan of meatloaf. He asks for it every time he comes for visits. I did add a clove of garlic and used 1/3 cup of ketchup. Everyone who has tried it loves it, not your typical run of the mill loaf.

Sorry, the concept of brown sugar in a meatloaf intrigued me but I cannot use ketchup in meatloaf.  I prefer a good barbeque sauce instead.  I omitted the milk completely and used a package of stuffing mix instead; crumble the bread crumbs right in the packet before opening and putting in the meat mixture.  Adds a great flavor and texture.

Loved the ginger in this recipe. It made up well & I think the brown sugar/ketchup is better on top, but that seems to be somewhat of a personal preference. This recipe is a great basic meatloaf recipe. Only due to my family's tastes (& trying to get my kids to eat more veggies) I added garlic, 1/2 cup celery and 1/2 cup bell pepper. I like to have the leftovers so I make it with 2 or 3 pounds of meat  and increase all other ingredients accordingly and make it in a casserole pan.

This was the best meatloaf I've ever had! My 14 year old son almost hurt himself because he kept going back for more. Little note though: Put a catch tray under your loaf pan to catch grease as it cooks. I almost had a grease fire in my oven making this.

With over 5,000 reviews, this recipe had lots of ideas on how to make it.  One change I did was to put the brown sugar and ketchup layer on the top, rather than the bottom of the pan.  I increased the recipe to using 2 lbs. of ground beef as I wanted to freeze a ½ lb. loaf for my MIL.  I mixed all ingredients, except the crackers and then pulled out one-half pound of meat.  To that portion I added the crushed saltine crackers, formed, added the topping and froze before baking.  To the other 1 ½ lb. meat mixture I added ‘Alabama Firecrackers’ a hot flavored saltine cracker recipe from AR.  I had a bunch of the spicy crackers to use up and my family likes things spicy, they worked GREAT in the meatloaf recipe.  In fact, my DS who is not a meatloaf eater, tried this meatloaf and not only liked it, but asked that I make it again.  My DH liked it hot, but loved it as cold leftovers, so he could make a meatloaf sandwich.  I served this with ‘Irish Champ’ potatoes from AR.  This is a great meatloaf recipe, and one that I will be making again.  Thanks, tangastar for sharing your recipe.

I put mayo instead of eggs and added liquid smoke (about a tbsp). For the glaze I did everything the same, but added Worcestershire sauce, a lil of liquid smoke and about 2 Tbsp of Sweet Baby Rays Chipotle bbq sauce to it... nom nom nom!

I did add change it a bit. Added 1/4 cup of brown sugar to meat mixture. I added 2table spoons of minced garlic. 1 tsp of cinniomon. I also increased the ginger to 1 tsp. Thought it gave it more flavor and a kick. Thank you for sharing this.

Really good.  Easy to make.  One of the few things that the kids rave about - maybe it's all the brown sugar involved?  :)  The wife and I enjoy it also.  I followed the recipe as stated for my first iteration and a few weeks later I substituted 1/2 the crackers w/ bread crumbs.  Couldn't tell much difference.  Both variations were great!

I actually made this recipe about 4 years ago. To this day, my family still rates this as my one and only culinary failure. I followed the recipe exactly as written. The flavor of the sweet brown sugar and the lean ground beef was just not a flavor any of us cared for. I am sorry for the bad review!

This was good.  I substituted seasoned bread crumbs for the crackers, dry onion soup for the onion, and cut the brown sugar to 1/4 cup.  I used 2lbs of ground beef, and kept the eggs and milk amts the same.  I added a tbsp of Worcestershire to the ketchup and brown sugar, and just added the glaze to the top for the last 15 min of baking.  Meat loaf is probably never going to earn 5 stars from me- it just is not that exciting.  But this was a good, solid recipe I will use again.

Growing up as a kid, I never really liked meatloaf.  So as an adult, I never cooked it. Well, I found myself without any brown gravy for hamburger steak this evening. So, as I pondered on what to make, I figured I'd give my adult self a chance to not like meatloaf. I found this recipe that seemed to have all the ingredients I liked, so I figured I'd give it a whirl with a few minor changes suggested by another reviewer. I used only a 1/4 cup of brown sugar, 1/2 c of milk, 1 c of seasoned bread crumbs and I added some worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture. It turned out great and my kids loved it!! I will definitely be making this again!!

My husband loved it! which is a rare occasion. He even said it was better than his mom's! I prefer to put either Ritz or Goldfish crackers and I also add 1/4 cup of bbq sauce. I also prefer to put it on a tray with bread underneath to soak up the grease.

I LOVE this but the only thing I do is like every 10 minuets I take juice from the bottom and inject it in the meat and it makes it so less dry. I use Ritz crackers also just adds something to it. My family makes me make this every Holiday too.

VERY TASTY! I've never really eaten meatloaf before, but I really enjoyed this. The thought of ketchup on my meat scared me, even though I love ketchup. Love the sweet taste from the brown sugar!

I did use panko breadcrumbs instead of crackers.
I also put the sauce on top.

I'm not a huge meatloaf fan but was asked to make one. Loved it the first time I made it, but since I have put the brown sugar/ketchup mixture on top. I own a catering business and have made this particular recipe several times and have had several people tell me how much they like it! It's a keeper! :)

I made this recipe and well i put a different spin on it. I had to use 2 lbs of ground chuck so I kept the milk and eggs the same but instead of onions i added Liptons Beefy Onion mix, left out the salt and ginger and I cut the crackers to 1/4 cup instead. For the glaze I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup. I didn't use a loaf pan because just the thought of it cooking in it's own fat makes me squeemish. So I mixed the ketchup and brown sugar in a bowl first then added it on top of the loaf.

Finally, a meatloaf recipe my entire family enjoyed!  Very easy, super quick with a tasty outcome.  I used the recipe as written and did not alter it.

This is the only way we have meat loaf now.  I put the glaze/sauce on top though.

Excellent! Easy! Family loved it! I eliminated salt from the recipe and it was great.  I had to bake mine 15 minutes longer than the recipe called.

This has become my go-to meatloaf. I put about a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce in it and I use Italian breadcrumbs instead of saltines. I also put in a splash of Texas Pete's hot sauce and about 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes for a bit more flavor. Love the addition of the ginger and the brown sugar/ketchup top is really tasty. Adult and kid friendly.

This is the first time I have ever made meatloaf that wasn't my Mom's recipe. As much as I love Mom's version, this slightly sweet version was absolutely delicious.  The only change I made was using an envelope of onion soup mix because I was out of onions and I added a green pepper.
So yummy.  I will make again for sure.

Great!  Used an envelope of onion soup mix instead of chopped onion (omit salt), and used Ritz crackers as others suggested.  Also, used 1/3 cup red wine in place of milk (to use up a bottle of wine).  This was delicious, will make again!

This was so good!  I really like the ginger in it. I made just a couple of changes like using Onion Soup mix instead of the onions.  I used Ritz crackers instead of Saltines.  I mixed the ketchup and brown sugar and put it on top of the meatloaf. I might just replace my regular meatloaf recipe with this one!

I am not allowed to make any other kind of meatloaf,  once this was tasted that was it, end of story, the best hands down we have ever tried.  The topping of brown sugar and ketchup is sweet and savory but even without the topping the loaf itself has a great flavor.  Combining the top with the loaf just knocks it out of the park.  Putting the topping on the bottom of the pan to bake and letting the juices from the loaf to bake down into it creates this wonderful baked on crust when it is inverted for serving.

I'm 63 yrs old and have made meatloaf MANY times over the years & thought my recipe was good til I tried this one! I made this recipe according to the directions and it turned out perfect. Even my non-meatloaf loving friends rave about it & want the recipe. Try it. You won't be sorry. One note: if you are using a 2 piece meatloaf pan you will have to put the brown sugar & ketchup on top. Its still delicious. I have also divided the mixture  into a muffin tin putting a little brown sugar & ketchup in the bottom of the cup. Delicious too.

Bland and unremarkable.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It took longer to cook than it says (1 hour 20 minutes before the meat thermometer read done), but other than that I followed it to the letter.  The only thing I taste is sugar and ground beef.  I'm very disappointed.

i like the sweetness, but my husband doesn't. To compromise I just sprinkle enough brown sugar in the pan to cover the bottom lightly.

My favorite meat loaf recipe ever! I did put two slices of bread under the meatloaf (throw this away when finished cooking) and the ketchup and brown sugar on top of the meatloaf - just a personal preference of mine. It was delicious!!

I thought this was a very good recipe. I added 1/2 of a Hatch chile to the onion mixture, and a Tbl. of Siracha chili sauce to the glaze. It was a nice contrast to the sweetness of the sauce. BJ

Decrease milk to 1/2 cup, 1 egg only. Add garlic to the onion. Mix ketchup, brown sugar, a bit of ginger and 1 TS Worcestershire sauce and spread on top of the loaf.

Thank heavens for this recipe!!!  I had almost despaired of ever cooking a decent meatloaf in my life.  My  mom's was so good, but I never got her recipe.  Then I tried the onion soup version and it was tasty but made my stomach "bubbly" :)  So, when my husband said he was craving meatloaf, I came out to my favorite recipe site and found one of my new favorite recipes.  I love this just the way it is.  Use all that extra sauce in the bottom of the pan to pour over your mashed potatoes!  What a great combination of sweet and tangy!!

I thought this was an awesome recipe!  I did a few tweaks following the recommendations of others.  I didn't put the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom, I put it on the top with an added Tablespoon of Worcestershire.  I also used only a 1/2 Cup of Milk, and 1/4 cup of Brown sugar.  I added a 1/4t of garlic powder, a couple drops of Worcestershire in the meatloaf mix.  I didn't have just beef, I had a meatloaf mix with pork and I think it added to the flavor.  Definitely saving the recipe to do it again :)

The best meatloaf I've ever had. My husband loves it and it is very easy to make. It tastes wonderful!! I put the brown sugar and ketchup on top not the bottom,I don't use the ginger it calls for and lastly I don't use all the brown sugar it calls for either. I guess I change it quite a bit :) Oh and I don't use a loaf pan lol.

I give it 4 stars because my husband and preschoolers loved it. Personally, my teens and I thought it was too sweet, so next time I may cut down on the brown sugar and try an onion soup mix to make it a little saltier....Definitely worth making, but also definitely needs tweaking to make it your own.

Very good!! My husband LOVES meatloaf and he said this was the best he has ever had! I did follow the suggestion of putting the bread on the bottom to soak up the grease and I put the sauce on top. The only other change I made was adding some garlic and some Epicure Meatloaf Seasoning.

I made this exactly as directed with the exception of adding the brown sugar and ketchup on the top instead of the bottom and it baked up splendedly!!  It was perfectly moist and just beautifully cooked.  It was a bit too sweet for me so I may take some of the other's suggestions to cut down on the brown sugar and maybe add a little worcestershire sauce to the ketchup.

My boyfriend and I love this recipe. Second time around I added less brown sugar because it was way too sweet for me. I also added 1 tbsp of worcestershire sauce to the beef as recommended by another reviewer. It was delish. 
Thanks so much for sharing!

This recipe is so easy to make. It comes out good if you use oatmeal, too, but you have to do the oatmeal by feel. I usually use about 2-3 cups for the basic recipe.

I am not easily impressed with any meatloaf, but this was delicious.  I doubled the recipe and made it in a casserole dish.  Ideally, i know now I probably should have made two loaf pans instead of one big casserole dish.  It was too big to invert after cooking.  However we sliced it in the dish and served the yummy sweet gravy that remained in the bottom of the dish over each serving.  I will definitely save this recipe.

Loved it... A new favorite. However I listened to some of the other reviews and put the sauce mix on the top of the loaf instead of the bottom and I added green and red peppers.

Thank you!!! My very picky kids LOVED it!!! I told them that it had a secret ingredient in it.  When I told them ginger, I got 2 big thumbs up.

After it was cooked, I placed a wire baking rack on a shallow dish and turned the loaf pan over.. (poured most of the juice out first) Voila! The brown sugar/ketchup side was up!!!

It was very good, however dare I say a hair oniony. Didn't expect it to be, as I love onions, but for whatever reason it was certainly very potent. I added 1 carrot which was nearly a purey from a food processor. Added extra moisture. Cooked @350 for 1.5 hours, came out amazing. Cooked it in Chef John's Mushroom gravy sauce. Quick and easy way to do it, just melt 1/4th cup butter in oven safe pan on stove top. Cook 1 8 oz package mushrooms (Whatever you have, shitaki is best, but I also tried white) until tender, not mushy or slimy. Add 3 tablespoons flour. Stir to cook for a minute. Then add 2 cups of chicken or beef broth (both work great). Stir until thickened. Then add half cup of cream. Stir and shut off heat. Pop meatloaf in the pan, don't put any of the gravy on top yet. Cook for 1 hour, THEN put the gravy on top  throwing several mushrooms on top too. So good! Serve with mashed potatoes.

Amazing!  As my family agrees, meatloaf is a comfort food, and this meatloaf was astounding!  It was sweet and meaty with an onion flavor that complimented the main flavors wonderfully.  I actually might add a bit more onion next time.  There was one change I made, I used Quaker Oatmeal instead of the saltines, it didn't compromise flavor at all.  Thank you for sharing!

This meatloaf is great! I only did a couple things different. Instead of saltines I used club crackers. Also I added 1/4 cup more Ketchup. After it was molded and in the pan I coated the top with a thick layer of ketchup, and thin layers of honey and corn syrup. 

It really came out delicious.

Change this recipe up a little and add the ginger to the ketchup and brown sugar topping. This is a show stopper meatloaf recipe. It's perfect if you want to wow company or impress your family at a reunion.

The best meatloaf ever. I do a couple things different: 1) use italian style bread crumbs in place of the cracker crumbs and 2) put the sauce on top while its cooking. Delish!!

I tried this for the first time tonight with a few of the suggested modifications & my own - one egg, seasoned bread crumbs, 2 slices of crumbled White American cheese, a tbs BBQ sauce, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp ground ginger,  1/4 tsp lemon pepper, pinch sea salt, and green, red, and white onions (~1/2 cup total), all in the ground turkey meat (less fat), and a tbs Worcestershire in the brown sugar and ketchup sauce, which I pored over the loaf at the beginning of cooking (1 hr). It was great!

Very good..and simple steps.. To those who didn't feel the ketchup and sugar should be on the bottom, when you remove the meatloaf simply flip the pan upside down so that the bottom becomes the top... And voila.. Ketchup and brown sugar on top. Yummy

Absolutely fantastic! But instead of putting the sugar and ketchup in the pan, I mixed it and poured it on top of the loaf.

Easy & Yummy recipe!
I loved the simplicity of this recipe! I used breadcrumbs instead of the crushed saltines, and I also added a splash of Worcestershire sauce & added minced garlic to the meatloaf. I also put the brown sugar/ketchup mix on top of the meatloaf instead of the bottom. I loved this! It was my first time making a meatloaf & I was so proud of how it turned out! Thanks for the great recipe! I now have a new way to use ground beef :)

Hands down, this is the best meat loaf receipe I have found in years. This is now my old standby. 
After making it a few times following the receipe exactly, I took the advice of other reviewers. 
I reduced the milk to 1/2 cup. I also added an additional 1/4 teaspoon of ginger to the ketchup. Like other reviewers, I wanted the sauce on top (but I also wanted it on the bottom!) So I doubled my gingered ketchup. I put the ketchup on the bottom as the receipe states and then at the end I brushed it on as a glaze. The remainder of the gingered ketchup was served tableside in lieu of regular ketchup.  (And fyi, this is so good, I always double this recipe.)

Wow this was so yummy!! I followed other's advise and put the brown sugar and ketchup on top and reduced the milk to 1/2 cup. I also added worchestershire sauce to the ketchup. I used ground turkey (2 lbs) instead of beef, and I had to cook it an extra 25 minutes before it was done. I didn't use ginger, and I used ritz crackers instead of saltines. This was a very delicious meatloaf!

I have been making a version of this for a while and it is my BF's favorite meatloaf- I have it tweaked to the way we like it.  I use ginger from the tube (gormet spice blend), instead of an onion I use a packet of onion soup mix (I ran out of onions one day and did that and he loved it), and I use breadcrumbs just because it's easier.  I also mix the ketchup and brown sugar sauce separate (not on the bottom) and add tomato sauce  and Worcestershire and use it as a glaze.

This was great! I used bread crumbs instead of crackers, put the sauce on top, and topped it with three slices of smoked bacon. My boyfriend who didn't really like meatloaf says it's the best he's ever had! It's been a week, and I've been asked to make it again already.

I love this recipe, and I use it quite frequently.  The first time I saw it, I thought it wasn't going to be that good. haha. BUT it's AMAZING!! I tweak mine a little. I add brown sugar, sauteed onions and garlic, and chili powder to the meatloaf mix. Also, I use cheddar cheese and garlic flavored croutons that I grind up in the food processor, instead of crackers.  Also, I mix up soy sauce, ketchup, and brown sugar in a bowl, and coat the bottom of the pan and the top of the meat loaf. YUMMMY! :)  (**And as a side note, I usually use a muffin pan, because it makes the perfect portion size!!)

This is delicious! I agree with other posters, you should put the ketchup and brown sugar on top. I also added some cheese to the middle of the meatloaf, I make it on a regular basis. I definetly recommend this recipe!

This is an awesome meatloaf. Even my picky husband loved this one... I exchanged regular brown sugar with brown sugar Splenda because we have to watch his sugar intake.

I made this for my boyfriend on his Birthday with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. He and I both loved it. It was really easy to make especially on my first time ever cooking meatloaf! I highly recommend it.

Easy, and tastes OK.  I don't like the mushed crackers in it, gives a texture I don't like.  It also comes out very sweet.

very good!  made a coupe of tweaks so that i wouldn't have to go to the store, but it turned out great!  only had 1lb of ground, so made a bit smaller loaf in a 4x8 pan and changed out the milk for about 3/4c sour cream.

I tried this last night. I didn't have any ginger so I substituted with garlic salt. I also used seasoned bread crumbs rather than the saltine crackers. Like other reviewers, I put the brown sugar & ketchup on top and spread it over the loaf. It had a very good taste!

Made this last night for dinner and it was so delicious. My husband is very picky and told me that it was excellent! He went back for seconds so I know it was good. I read the reviews and added some worcestershire sauce. I also put half brown sugar/ketcheup on top and bottom. Thank you tangastar for my new go to meatloaf recipe.

I'm not usually a fan of meatloaf, but this was pretty awesome.

Just a couple adjustments:
I put the glaze on top.
I substituted fresh ginger, minced.
I substituted seasoned bread crumbs for the saltines.

Thanks, tangastar!

So delicious everyone loved it even my dad who hates meatloaf used panko breadcrumbs instead of the saltines and cooked it with the sauce on top not on the bottom. Make this meatloaf it will change your life!

The Recipe is So Simple and With the Brown Sugar/Ketchup on the bottom of the pan, the Meatloaf stayed SO Moist and Delicious!! A+++ This is a Major Keeper!! Thanks so Much!

My first meatloaf and it was wonderful.  I didn't have ketchup so used some BBQ sauce.  Didn't use milk or ginger.  So easy and flavorful. 

- thank you for a great recipe.

This was a great recipe. Like others I put the brown sugar ketchup on top. In the meatloaf I mixed  3/4 teaspoon of (Staceys hamburger spice) from this site.
I form in a 5x9 loaf pan but I removed uncooked and put in a 8x12 pan to catch the grease. I will make again!!

I didn't think that it could really be that easy and turn out real good. I was wrong. It was perfect and the taste was wonderful. Next time I think I will add a little pineapple for a little extra taste.

I made this meatloaf for dinner tonight and it was great! Before I made it, I read a lot of  reviews for some good tips. I used ground chicken meat, bread crrmbs, added 1/4 tsp. garlic powder. Also spread the ketchup and brown sugar sause on top and baked it in a casserole dish lined with foil. Came out very moist with good flavors. This'll be added to my favorte recipe box. Thanks so much for sharing!

It was so easy to make and so good to eat.  My neighbors came over and helped themselves to seconds.  I did add a few more finely chopped veggies to make it a bit hardier and I followed the other suggestions and topped it with the ketchup and brown sugar since TO ME that ketchup'y aspect is what I love so much about meatloaf.  Making again in a couple of days for the guys at work! 
***Update:Guys at work loved it***

Delish! I haven't had meatloaf with brown sugar before, and I'm used to the ketchup being on top. I followed the recipe exactly, and I think it is a great recipe as-is.  Thank you for sharing!

Update: I've been substituting the saltines with Panko breadcrumbs for years, and my husband and I love it that way. Tonight instead of using a loaf pan, I used a muffin pan (lined with foil), it made perfect portions as well as easy clean-up.

I never met a meatloaf I liked...until now! I did as a lot of other suggested and used bread crumbs in place of the saltines and onion soup in place of the chopped onion. I then added the suggested garlic and Worcestershire sauce (2 Tbsp to the ground beef mix and 1 Tbsp to the ketchup and brown sugar). I also put the glaze on top and then 10 minutes before it was done, I spooned on more glaze (I used about half the first time). Next time I will cut the sugar as it was too sweet for me, but the whole family gobbled it down, which is a rare occurrence. Yum!

I was afraid this would be too sweet but everyone enjoyed it.  I changed the servings to 10 so I could use up 2 lbs of meat.  I chose 1lb ground turkey and 1lb ground chuck and it still came out great.

Great recipe I added a layer of banana pepper rings on top to spice it up a bit.

Fantastic! So easy. The only thing I changed was that I poured the ketchup/sugar glaze over the top before baking instead of putting it in the bottom. It seemed like a lot of glaze, but I used all of it and it was the perfect amount. Will definitely make again! Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good! I also but the sugar to 1/4 cup, added a little Worcestershire, and used bread crumbs instead of crackers.  My husband raved and wants me to make it every week!

I used very lean ground beef and just a tablespoon or two of brown sugar and cooked it much longer than suggested (probably 90 minutes). It was great!

This was a really good meatloaf.  It was unbelievably moist.  Like other reviewers, I used the brown sugar/ketchup sauce on top and also added a splash of Worcestershire sauce to the mix.  I had run out of saltine crackers so I used Ritz crackers instead.  I think the buttery flavor of the Ritz added a little additional flavor to the meatloaf, I highly recommend trying it.  Thanks for the great meatloaf recipe!

Great recipe! I followed some suggestions from other reviewers. I cut the brown sugar and ketchup down to 1/4 cup each, and added 2 tb Worcestershire to that mixture, and put that on top rather than the bottom. 
I only used one egg, and added a tsp of garlic powder, and used Ritz cracker crumbs. I was going to use just 1/4 cup milk but forgot it. It was still nicely moist, but the milk I think would have made it perfect! I will definitely use this as my default meatloaf recipe from now on.

I am not a meatloaf fan, as I find most recipes make a very dry meatloaf.  This is the only meatloaf I will eat!  Juicy, tasty, and the brown sugar makes a sweet juice that is delicious on mashed potaoes.

We liked this meatloaf and made it into sandwiches.  My husband thought it was too sweet and so next time I will use less brown sugar, perhaps 1/4 cup.  I also mixed it with half ground chicken and half beef.

Unbelievably delicious!  Used 3/4 cup of ritz crackers and 2.5 lbs meat.  I added an egg and baked for 1 hour 10 minutes.  I haven't made meatloaf in 30 years but with this recipe I will be making this at least once a month!

It was good, but dense. I loved the ketchup/brown sugar topping, one thing that I will do differently next time is use the diced onions rather than what other reviewers suggested with the onion soup packets.

My first time making meatloaf.....LOVED IT!!  The topping got stuck in my teeth though....too sweet?  No such thing in my book!!  I forgot the milk in my recipe so I can't fault the recipe for it being "stiff."  All in all, I will be making this again before I try any other recipe....with the milk.

OMG!!!  Im so impressed with this recipe being my 1st time having & making meatloaf. I followed the recipe as stated with the only options of tossing a package of Lipton beefy onion mix instead of chopping an onion(no need for the tears) and lining a square baking pan with foil and shaping my loaf. I also eyeballed a fair amount of brown sugar, sprinkled it on top and drizzled ketchup on top and VOILA!!!!!...TO DIE FOR! the sweet caramelized combination and onion mix is HEAVENLY!!!! this is served tonight with homemade mashed potatoes,Brussel sprouts and parmesan asparagus. THANKS for sharing

Awesome meatloaf recipe but maybe a bit too onion-y. I used a reviewer suggestion to use onion soup mix instead of chopped onion. Next time I may just follow the recipe provided, although I did reduce brown sugar to 1/4 cup and used one egg (instead of two) and half cup milk. Perfectly moist. A keeper for sure!

Very dissappointed in this recipie. Onion still tasted raw, ketchup/brown sugar mix was WAY too sugary (even with half the sugar!) and the texture was very off. Too bad!!

I followed this recipe almost exactly only I added the ketchup and brown sugar on top. I also did not have a loaf pan so I just used tin foil on a cookie sheet. Turned out perfectly!  Highly recommend this.

Delicious! My husband asks for this for dinner, and the kids like it too. I add a little honey mustard to the sauce, and put it on top for the last 10-15 minutes (rather than cooking the meatloaf on top of it).

I thought it was good but it was different because I've never used brown sugar. I think I used too much or something, cuz it was a bit sweeter. Either that or I am just not used to it. But still really good!

Loved it like most folks...my version though is much lower in salt...I use unsalted top saltines, no salt ketchup, dried chopped onions and split the ketchup and brn sugar between the top and bottom...is amazing.  Serve with egg noodles mixed with some unsalted butter, garlic and Parmesan cheese on the side.

I know I'm just another in a long line of reviewers, but I enjoyed this recipe just as much as everyone else! Used 2 # ground beef, 1/2 onion, 2 cloves garlic, bread crumbs not crackers. Being impatient and hungry, I followed another user's idea and made mini-loves in my muffin pan.(It made 16!) I put the ketchup/brown sugar sauce on bottom, cooked for 30 minutes at 350 degrees, then spooned the rest of the sauce on top and cooked another 15. This was so delicious, I can't wait to make it again - this time in actual loaf form. Yum yum!DELICIOUS

I loved this recipe and did very little in modifying the ingredients. I did modify how I put it together. 
I love garlic but enjoyed allowing the ginger to step up and not be outweighed by it. I added a small dash of garlic powder and an egg, probably more out of habit.  Because the texture was so moist I formed two loafs and baked them on a metal grate/rack, sprayed with cooking oil. I applied a little of the ketchup and brown sugar mixture to the top lightly then put a strip of bacon across each loaf. This allowed the bacon to add flavor to the meat but all the grease to drip down and away from the meatloaf. Just before it was completely cooked I added the remaining ketchup/brown sugar glaze and put it under a low broiler to let it really adhere to the loaf and darken it just a bit at the edges. 
Any family member I have made this for has requested the recipe. At times I have added or subtract the garlic and egg and occasionally have added the Worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture. Honestly it has never received any complaints and is probably winning more honors from my kids on the second day when it slices so nicely for meatloaf sandwiches on rye, with a small dab of mustard.
Thanks for the recipe tangastar.

I am an old woman cook. Old family recipes and good southern cook who always tries new recipes. It was just ok. Nothing special but a good basic recipe you might find anywhere. Nice recipe for new cooks.  I forgot - when one adds a sugar glaze, there goes the dripping for gravy - too sweet. I prefer no glaze so I can use the drippings for gravy. Just mix up some cornstarch and water, add to the drippings and you have gravy. I add some au jus mix or Better Than Bullion beef, maybe some mushroom gravy mix. It's an ok recipe though. Nice and firm; just like it should be.

Best Meatloaf I ever had!
Did not have saltine crackers, used leftover stuffing croutons and also mixed in 1/4 cup Roasted peanuts. 
Substituted with fresh Ginger and also added sesame seeds.  Yum!

Very good base, but I made a few changes. I used lean ground turkey. I omitted the crackers and put two slices of bread at bottom of pan.  I added chopped carrots with the onion.  I also added worsetschire to ketchup and brown sugar mixture that I put on top of the loaf, and in the meat mixture. I think next time I could cut the brown sugar in half.  A little bit too sweet for me even with the changes.  It is called brown sugar meatloaf, but I like to follow the recipe the first time and make changes according to preference.  This will be a go to recipe with those few small tweaks.

VERY good! I added more crushed saltine crackers to the loaf. I also topped the loaf with the brown sugar and ketchup instead of having it on the bottom. I used more ketchup and brown sugar than listed. Turned out delicious!

My husband said not to make meatloaf any other way from now on. I always deviate from the recipe a bit so I added crushed Italian croutons instead of crackers and I added cinnamon as well as the ginger. It was fantasic!!  Great recipe!

This is delicious.  I adjusted the recipe slighty...I mix ketchup with dry mustard and little bit of brown sugar and then brush it over the meatloaf before placing it in the oven. I half the amount of brown sugar in the meatloaf as well.

The thing I like best about this recipe is that the loaf holds nicely together.  It is nicely seasoned as well.  Further, it is a great base to add more seasoning of your choice.  It is a keeper.

I added only 1 egg and around 1/3 cup of milk to the meat. I also threw in some brown sugar and a sprinkle(literally) of ground cloves to give the meat some more flavor. Italian style bread crumbs worked just fine too. Since I do not have a loaf pan, to make the glaze, I mixed the sugar and ketchup together and added a dash of ginger and a little sprinkle of ground cloves. The meatloaf came out so flavorful and moist. This is about the 5th time I've made this and my most recent time came out PERFECT. However, I think I may add a bit of diced carrot next time for some crunch.

This is the best meatloaf I have ever made. I have people ask me to make it all the time. I have never had a problem with the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom. And I have made this 20+ times. It gets flavor just fine. I think putting it on top it would burn and make it mushy. I just drizzle it on top of the pieces after they are cut. I would not change a thing about this. I do use cinnamon instead of the ginger if i an out.

I followed the amended recipe given by H2OSMILES who helpfully compiled what others had suggested.

I thought it was moist and tasty. But too sweet. Even when reduced to 1/4 cup, the sugar overpowered the tomato in the glaze.

Next time, I'll try these modifications:
In the ketchup glaze, 1/8 cup of brown sugar with a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce and a dash of cayenne pepper and black pepper (the glaze really needs something to balance the sweetness). In the meatloaf: 1/2 cup of milk and 1 egg, 2 cloves of garlic to the meat mixture and 2 tablespoons of chopped celery, the onion, 1 cup of seasoned bread crumbs instead of the crackers. I think I'll add more ginger because I couldn't really taste it with 1/4 teaspoon. Next time I will try with the glaze on top from the start.

This is extremely good.  I only tweaked the seasonings.  I always do because my family like a lot of flavor.  I added ketchup, salt, garlic salt and pepper.  I have man eaters at my home so I used 3 pds of ground beef -- lol!  The brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom took this meatloaf over the top.  Defintely will make again.

I used only 1lb hbg, but added 4 hot italian sausages removed from cases and mixed in with hbg. I also sprinkled some Montreal Steak Spice lightly over mixture.  I did not grease the pan before I put the brown sugar and ketchup in. I was worried there was too much milk, but the meat loaf had lots of juice, which I poured off at the end and thickened with corn starch in the microwave. I poured it over the meatloaf and popped in the oven till everything else was ready. It was a hit. the italian sausage added just the right kick. YUM!

This meatloaf was delicious! It was super moist.. I did the recipe as instructed than made an additional glaze of 1/4 cup brown sugar 1/4 cup ketchup and put it on top of the meatloaf for the remaining 15 minutes. My family loved this.. will definitely make this again!! 

It made great left overs as well.. stayed very moist.

Great recipe, used others' recommendation to lessen the brown sugar, place bread at the bottom of the pan, and use the ketchup and sugar on top rather than on the bottom - will definitely make again !

Great go-to meatloaf recipe! I did tweak a few things to suit my family's taste. I omitted the milk, added 1 tbsp. worchestershire, 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1 tsp. beef bouillion, & italian bread crumbs instead of the crackers into the mix. For the glaze I used 1/4 cup catsup, 1/4 cup packed brown sugar, 1/4 cup honey, & 1 tbsp. worchestershire. Delicious!

This was a very good recipe! I have had a hard time finding one that I like as much as my Grandma's and this is the best. I did what most other people did and put the sauce on top. I also used butter crackers instead of saltine and I think it added a better flavor.

Mix the brown sugar and ketchup together. Do not put it in the bottom of the pan. Place meatloaf in oven, pour ketchup mixture over meatloaf for last 20 or so min of cooking.

I've never made meatloaf before, so I wanted to pick a highly rated one. This one came out amazing. I took some other reviewers' suggestions and mixed the brown sugar and ketchup and spread it as a glaze on top of the loaf. It came out moist and absolutely delicious. I also substituted the onion for onion powder and left out the ginger as I had none. I will definitely be making this recipe again and again.

I wanted to take the day off from cooking and so I asked my husband to take over. He'd been wanting meatloaf and so I promised to find him a good recipe for it. The end result was, after I'd spent years trying to find the perfect meatloaf, my husband -- who rarely cooks -- hit a home run with this. My grandmother said it was the best she'd ever had, and she clearly meant it. Great flavor and smelled delicious while cooking. He followed the recipe exactly -- I think he was afraid not to.

I don't even like meatloaf, but this is delicious and I make it all the time.  I always just use some Lipton onion soup mix in the beef vs. cut up onions because I am lazy and don't feel like dicing up onions.  I also suggest putting some bread slices under your meatloaf to soak up the grease and putting your ketchup/brown sugar mixture on TOP of the meatloaf.  This works wonders!

Try cooking Meatlaof in the oven on a broiler pan. It is so much easier not to have to keep draining the grease. I love this recipe, but when i make it i like to mix brown sugar and ketchup on the top then lay a couple of slices of bacon over the mix then reapply more mix over the bacon half way through. It comes out great!

Delicious! I tweaked this recipe as well by adding minced garlic to both the meat and sauce. I also added crispy fried onions on the top 5 minutes before pulling it from the oven.  Yum!

This was hands down the best meatloaf my family and I have ever had! The flavor was excellent! Some reviews have said that they had issues with the sauce being on the bottom, I actually preferred it this way. Putting the ketchup or any other sauce on the top kind of gets pasty, having the sauce on the bottom made so moist and flavorful! Thank you for the great recipe, making again for the third time tonight!

I have made this many times and my whole family loves it.  My husband requests it.  I use bread crumbs instead of saltines and I usually add red or green peppers and a few tablespoons of worcestershire sauce and pour out the extra grease towards the end of baking. Delish!!!

Me: "how many stars should I give this?"
Husband: "FIVE."

We used half an onion, and used Ritz brand sour cream & onion crackers instead of saltines, then crumbled some extra crackers onto the brown sugar/ketchup mixture at the bottom of the pan to help soak up the oils.  Amazing! 

The brown sugar was perfect, but not overpowering.  it was sweet, but subdued.  It was delicious.  Even our 23-year-old housemate who 'hates meatloaf' loved it so much, he wanted some of the leftovers the next day (which make great sandwiches with a slice of your choice of cheese on any bread- we used biscuits).

Normally, we eat really strict, so this was a great treat.

I modified this recipe by adding worchestire sauce after reading other reviews. If you're not a fan of slightly cooked onions I suggest sauteeing them prior to adding them to the meat mixture. I also suggest placing the loaf in the center of a large glass baking dish rather than a small loaf pan. While my husband said that this was the best thing I've ever cooked the loaf sat in its own grease which would have been avoided if the loaf was islanded in a larger dish.

Great recipe. However the liquid was too much so I had to drain it out and continue cooking. The sugar and ketchup at the bottom went with the excess liquid so I reapplied the mixture on the top. Thanks for sharing!

I put the brown sugar mix on top of the meatloaf. Other than that, I made it exactly as stated and it turned out wonderful. VERY moist. Very tasty. We had just a small piece left over and I used it mixed up with eggs the next morning for my husband's breakfst (minus the brown sugar topping). Thanks for sharing!

Delicious!  Wow...this is good!  I made just a few changes, mostly out of necessity though.  I used some garlic and herb flavored breadsticks instead of the crackers.  I was out of eggs, so I tried using 1/2 cup of whole fat yogurt, and it turned out great!  I also sprinkling a little more brown sugar and ketchup to the top.

Fantastic!!

I give this 4 stars as is, but 5 stars if you add the brown sugar/ ketchup mix on top instead of the bottom. This is the only meatloaf recipe my 3 picky eaters will eat!!! The ginger gives it a nice subtle flavor.

When I pulled this meatloaf out of the oven, it looked overcooked and it was floating in the grease.  I wasn't expecting much, but it was FANTASTIC and was perfectly cooked.  My husband said it was the best meatloaf he had ever had.  Next time, I will put bread under the meat to soak up the grease like another reviewer suggested and I will mix the brown sugar and ketchup  and put on the top.

This is our favorite meatloaf.  This recipe was given to my mother for a wedding shower 50 years ago and it is called Upside Down Meatloaf.  The brown sugar and ketsup is in the bottom of the pan because you turn the meatloaf over and  serve it on a plate.  It is cooked "upside down".  I use a butter knife and slide it around the edge of the pan to loosen any stuck areas before placing a plate over the meatloaf pan and flipping it over.  First I use a baster to remove any grease so it does not splatter.

Hubby and I are not big meatloaf eaters, but thought I'd give it a shot. It was pretty good! I made some modifications based on other users' reviews. 1. Used ground chicken. 2. Chopped a little yellow bell pepper and sauteed it with the onions before adding to the mix. 3. Added about 1/4 cup of packed brown sugar and 1/4 cup ketchup into the mix. 4. Increased cracker crumbs to 1 cup. Everything else I left the same.

I expected so much more from this meatloaf. I did the basic meatloaf and added Lea and Perrins plus the bread on the bottom.  Thought it was bland and think I will stick with my tried and true recipe.  But I am glad that I did try it because you never know when you strike gold!  My favorite you ask? The recipe on dried onion soup box plus crushed cheese-it mixed in.

I didn't have ginger or crackers. I used bread crumbs. Made it for Father's day and it was a big hit. I made 2 pans full and it's all gone! Thanks for the recipe. Also, I had no problem flipping it over and the sugar top stayed on top. I creased both pans first with oil. Yummy!

The best meatloaf we've ever had!!  I didn't read the instructions before I started making the loaf and just mixed everything together.  I had to add more bread crumbs than stated.  I also made more of the ketchup brown sugar mixture for the top.  Yummy in the tummy!!

I have been making this for probably a year. My husband loves it and so does his meat eating family. I have never actually tasted it myself as I am not a fan of beef but they all love it. I serve it with good ol' mashed potatoes and a veggie. I do as others suggested and drain the grease and add the ketchup during the last 10-15 minutes of baking.

I HATE meatloaf. However my husband loves it so I decided to make it for him. WOW am I glad I chose this recipe. It was outstanding! Best meatloaf ever. I took the other reviewers advice and substituted seasoned croutons for crackers but other than that I made as stated. I originally cut back on the sugar as others suggested but it was to “ketchupy” so I made it as it was called for and loved it. I actually like my sauce a bit sweeter. But even taking the sauce out of the equation the meat with all the flavors was truly outstanding. Served it with mash potatoes and green beans cause we were in the mood for some comfort food. LOVED LOVED LOVED it! I’m changing my mind about meatloaf!

Best meatloaf I have ever made.  Simple and delicious. I added a 1/2 tsp. habanero chili sauce to the ketchup & brown sugar mixture for a spicy punch.  I also smeared the sauce on top of the meatloaf instead of under it.

Very easy quick recipe. Kids liked it too! I used ground turkey, bread crumbs, added a little garlic powder and only used 1/2 c milk. I sprinkled the brown sugar on top and topped with ketchup. I used three mini loaf pans and cooked at 350 for 45 minutes.

I discovered this recipe on the Alertsons.com website.  It's really good.  I've also made it with half ground turkey and half ground beef.  This recipe is so good.  I've turned a lot of people on to this recipe and everyone gets a good response when they make it.

This is a version of meatloaf I've always made, but like the idea of the brown sugar (less) AND Worcester sauce added to the ketchup--always on top of the meatloaf.  Adds to the appearance and flavor.  I can't imagine the thinking behind putting it on the bottom.

loved this one!  meat is juicy and flavorful!  i tweaked it as prior reviews suggested and used onion soup mix and added a little bbq sauce to the brown sugar and ketchup and put the sauce on top instead of the bottom... instead of one big meatloaf i used a cupcake pan and made kid size mini-loaves.  this way i cut the cooking time in half!

I prefer my own recipe for meatloaf but I've been using the glaze since I first found this recipe some time ago.  I put it on the bottom and on the top!  I often bake my meatloaf in an iron skillet as we really like the 'crispy' edges.  This glaze is a great addition and everyone loves it and begs for more.

This is a really good meatloaf! I used the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom of the pan and on top of the meatloaf. I think the meatloaf itself needs a bit more flavor. I tried adding some ketchup/brown sugar and garlic to the meatloaf but it still didn't have much flavor.

I've made this a few times and everyone really enjoys it! I altered by making a free-form loaf with the brown sugar/ketchup glaze on top. It comes out perfectly! One thing I adjusted was spicing up the glaze, adding tons of black pepper, a bit of cayenne, garlic powder and wochestershire...cuts the sweetness a bit and adds a little zing to the crust of the meatloaf.

1) You should not have to change a recipe so much to give it high ratings. 2) Way too much sugar, even if you cut it to 1/4c.

Great taste and easy recipe.  I too put the brown sugar and ketchup mixture on top instead of underneath.  Next time I think I will make a little extra in a sauce pan.  The brown sugar mixture really is the key to this recipe.  There wasn't enough sauce to spread, and I'm use to making it with gravy.  So, extra sauce for us.  My kids loved it.

I had never made meatloaf before, mainly because I didn't like my mothers.  I only decided to try because I needed a cheap recipe to utilize when ground beef went on sale.  I am happy to say this is a great dinner.  I will be rotating this one regularly.  Even better is the recipe works great when you utilize bulk buying and freezer cooking.

SO good-everyone loved it. Instead of cracker crumbs I used a mixture of italian panko and italian bread crumbs and eliminated the ginger. As suggested by other reviewers I also added some worcestershire and dry mustard to the glaze, which I spread on top instead of on the bottom of the pan. This will be my go-to meatloaf recipe.

Good recipe.  I just added garlic steak sauce for more spice. And I added the glaze on top the last 15 minutes.  Also, I always layer the bottom of the dish with sliced potatoes. This way the fat stays on the bottom.

I didn't have enough ketchup so I used some store brand BBQ sauce I had lying around.  I also used onion soup mix out of laziness and omitted the egg out of forgetfulness.  I shape my meatloafs on a double pan so the grease can drain and glaze the top. It turned out really nice

Outstanding and such a nice change of pace. I didn't change a thing and we really enjoyed it. It was like an upside down meatloaf. Make sure you let it sit for a few minutes. Otherwise, the ketchup, brown sugar layer will taste like straight grease. Once it's cooled and settled ... YUMMY!

My husband doesn't like meatloaf, but I made it anyway.  In the end he had seconds and all my children loved it.  My children being 6, 4, and 2.  The only change I made was putting the brown sugar mixture on the top. Wonderful, thank you!!

A great, simple meatloaf with excellent flavor.  This has become our standard meatloaf.

As a number of others have commented, I do not use a loaf pan, instead I put the ketchup and brown sugar on top.  Often I replace the topping with some sort of BBQ sauce.

Addition: I have begun shredding a carrot or two, and chopping some celery, if I have any.  I then sweat the carrots, onion and celery and add it to the meatloaf.  Makes the texture a bit lighter and adds some more flavor.

I like this recipe as is but I think it is even better with a couple of changes. I used 1 lb. ground beef and 1/2 lb. ground pork. Decreased the milk to 2/3 c., used onion powder instead of chopped onion, added garlic powder, worcestershire sauce, chopped parsley, and Ritz instead of saltines. Also, I spread the ketchup/brown sugar on the top of the meatloaf. I really liked the ground ginger in this recipe. I would have never thought of adding it but it compliments the meatloaf nicely.

This was too sweet for me. I think I would reduce the amount of brown sugar next time and mix it in with everything else.  I think I would also add some barbeque sauce or smoked seasoning.

My whole family loved this! Even my picky kids. Next time I will double the sauce though. The only alterations I made were using less brown sugar and adding wors. sauce as suggested by others. I also put the sauce on top and but bread on the bottom to absorb the grease. Worked great!

Turned out awesome!  I gave it 4 stars because I followed other reviewers advice and used the brown sugar mix as a glaze on top.  This turned out excellent with 90/10 beef in cupcake molds.  I took them out and put them on a cookie sheet for the last 10 minutes after reglazing once more.  Out new favorite way to eat meatloaf!

Cut back on brown sugar and ketchup sauce. Meatloaf was awesome!!! So moist! Used Almond milk instead of milk, also used 1 cup bread crumbs instead of saltine crackers. Try with less brown sugar, adding worstershire sauce.

One day, I made a meatloaf - not just any meatloaf, but a life changing meatloaf.  I have no idea how I did it.  I have not been able to recreate that heavenly dish in 4 or 5 years!  This came pretty close.

This was a big hit in my house. We were tired of the same onion soup meatloaf. So i decided to try this my 5yr old son ate every bite he is not a big meat eater instead on crackers i used season breadcrumbs and canned milk and season it to my taste. As soon as i put it in the oven it smelled delicous. This meatloaf went great with my creamy mac and cheese excellent comfort food. this didnt lasted until lunch time the next day. Will be making this again

Very Good!  I used 1 egg, 1/2 cup of rice milk and 1 cup of plain bread crumbs and put the sauce on top (used only 1/4 cup brown sugar and added 1 tbsp worcestershire)--also added some finely chopped green pepper and about 2 tsp jarred garlic.  Because I was running out of time--I cooked at 400 for the last 30 min. and tented with foil for 15 minutes.  Thank you.

Boy was I expecting more.  The consistency was great, the glaze was great (on top, not on the bottom of loaf), but other than that...onion flavored meat.  Total disappointment.  Will absolutely not make again.

This is an easy recipe and a great way to use up ground beef (if you are like me and it has been sitting in your freezer for 6 months).  I made some adjustments due to lack of ingredients but still thought it turned out alright.  To cut some of the calories in this recipe, I used splenda brown sugar, low sodium ketchup, soy milk, and planko bread crumbs in lieu of the crackers.  Yeah yeah....to most that changes the whole purpose of meatloaf but I was snowed/iced in so I couldn't get out to get the proper goods.  Oh - and I also mixed the brown sugar/ketchup into the meatloaf and then used what was leftover as a glaze on top (although I did add a bit of maple syrup to it to naughty it up a bit).

The recipe was delicious, the ginger flavor really made it distinct. Like many other reviewers I reduced the amount of sugar to 1/4 cup and that was more than sweet enough (I might even use less next time). That aside, I totally recommend this one!

I thought the brown sugar was extremely overpowering. My husband and I could barely eat it because it was just way too sweet. I just prefer a more tomatoey meatloaf though. I should have known from the name of the recipe. This just wasn't for us.

This has become my staple meatloaf recipe, very good. I often add balsamic vinegar to the brown sugar/ketchup sauce and some ground mustard. Last time I made it into meatballs and my family actually liked it better in that form.

This was one of the best meatloaf recipes I have ever made.  I made a bit more of the ketchup brown sugar topping.  I used oatmeal instead of cracker crumbs for a bit of fiber.  I used half ground turkey breast and half lean ground sirloin to cut the fat.  My husband loved it and so did I.

Very delicious!  I too baked the meatloaf in a regular 13 X 9 glass dish, placing the sauce on the top, and the brown sugar on last.  The other changes I made were to add a tsp. of low sodium Morton's Nature's Seasoning, a few more cracker crumbs, and  1/2 cup of mild chunky salsa to the meatloaf.  And instead of using ketchup on the top, I substituted it w/the same mild salsa.  Very good meatloaf, and I will make again!

This is really the best.  My husband doesnt care for meatloaf but said this is the best he has ever had. I took suggestions from others and mixed the brown sugar, ketchup worchestershire  and used garlic in place of the ginger. Also cut the milk to 1/2c.  1 hour was perfect!

My boyfriend and I absolutely LOVE this meatloaf! The only thing different I did was I used elk instead of beef. Its much of a leaner meat than beef. I also cut down the brown sugar, and i put worcestershire sauce in both the meat and the sauce.

I make something similar. I love the idea of a glaze-bonus flavor. ALong with the tons of brown sugar I use, I also add lemon juice, worstecherchire sauce, ketchup and a little bbq and honey. Its super thick and sticks to the meatloaf.

This was fabulous! I used 2 stalks of celery, 1/2 an onion and 1 tbs of minced garlic. Placed in a food processor (to trick the picky eaters in the  house). Instead of crackers, i used 1/2 c breadcrumbs and 1/4 c wheat germ. after reading other reviews, used 1/2 c milk and 1 egg. as well as worchestire 1/2 tsp with the brown sugar and ketchup. Baked in 350 degree oven in muffin tins. I may add cooked 2 carrots the next time in my food processor ;) .yummy and moist. wow thanks

Made this last night for the first time.  It was REALLY good.  I followed the recipe exactly as stated and my husband said it was the best meatloaf he has ever had.  He actually asked me this morning to make it again tonight.  I think what made the recipe successful is baking it in the 9"x5" loaf pan and putting the brown sugar & ketchup on the bottom and then flipping it over on the patter, so in reality, the glaze IS on top.  I think these two things are what help kept it moist.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used ground turkey instead of beef and I used seasoned bread crumbs instead of saltines.  I formed a loaf in a casserole dish and pressed the brown sugar on top of the meat mixture and poured the ketchup over the brown sugar. This was a nice change to my usual meatloaf recipe.

Very moist and delicious. Like other reviewers, I chose to just put the brown sugar glaze on top of the meatloaf before cokking instead of on the bottom and top. I also used a 1/2 cup of ground oats instead of the crushed saltines, as I was cooking for someone with a gluten allergy.

I never thought that meatloaf could taste this good.  I never liked meat loaf but I think if I was served this recipe during my childhood it would have been one of my favorites.  I substituted 3/4 cups Italian bread crumbs for the saltine crackers, added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to the brown sugar and ketchup mixture,and substituted a packet of onion soup instead of an onion.  I also put the sauce on top of the loaf (I wouldn't change any of the other ingredients though).  Turned out perfect.  It was so yummy that I had my kids comment on how much they liked it.  Thank you for the recipe.

I also added the brown sugar and ketchup to the top. My family loved it. My son (24) said the only thing he would change is to add the cheese in the middle from the Cheeseburger Meatloaf. Both recipes were big hits and good comfort food for this snowy weather.

Loveddddd it! I'm husband said he would eat it every other day if I'd make it :) he's crazy about meat loaf in general as you can tell. So yummy, did everything as said but added worchester to the bottom part and used bread crumbs instead of saltine crackers because I was lazy :) delicious!

I'm a meatloaf lover and I love this! I never thought anything could be too sweet for me, but even I'll cut it back a little next time. I didn't have any saltine crackers so I used bread crumbs and I saved the milk for last to see how much I would need and I only needed 1/4 cup. Very moist!I will be makeing this again!!!!! PS I made this with turket burger and took it to a meeting, no one even thought about it and everyone love it, one of the first things to go!

=)  def. the best meatloaf I've ever had, and my boyfriend loved it too!  I did mix the ketchup and brown sugar together and put it on top for the last 15 min. of cooking.  Only because I seen others did.  Turned out really good.  Loved this also because its really simple and I'm new at cooking for more than just me!  Thank you!

The meatloaf itself was very tasty as-is.  My husband and I both found the topping to be far too sweet, though, even with the amount of sugar reduced by almost half.

This is the very best meat loaf that I have ever tasted. I did use the brown sugar mixture as a glaze on top of the loaf and never have tried it on the bottom of the loaf pan. I also added a touch of yellow prepared mustard and a splash of worcestershire sauce to the brown sugar mix. This will most likely be my only meat loaf from now on.

We loved it! I will be making this again! ~3/4 cup crushed saltines come to 15 of them, next time I will just put 15 in a ziplock bag and crush with rolling pin. ~I left the salt out since saltines & ketchup have enough salt for me ~I also put the ketchup & brown sugar mix on top. I use the double layer pan with the holes to drip the fat off and did not want the sauce to drip down the holes.

Delicious!  My husband who doesn't even eat his grandmother's meatloaf has already asked me when I'll make this again!  Just a suggestion, if you add the onion soup mix as one person suggested, you can leave out the extra salt.  I'll be keeping this one in my recipe box to make again!!

Made this exactly as described and it was perfect.  Used 85% lean and everyone loved it.  Cook time may be more like 1 hr 25 min though.  Checked with thermometer after hour and it was only 120.

Yummy. I put the ketchup mixture on top though and put provilone slices in the middle. Husband and 6-year-old liked it. I like the idea of using bread underneath to soak up the grease though. We have our own beef and some of it is pretty fatty.

Browned diced onions and mushrooms in butter and shiraz.  Added 1/2 cup of milk and one egg. Added more pepper, less salt than recommended.  Added Kashi 7 grain crackers. Added 1 tbsp of worsh. sauce to brown sugar/katchup sauce as recommended.

I would have to say the name should be changed to BBQ Meat Loaf.  I am a busy mom so i did change a couple things and that was i made them like hamburgers so they would cook faster and then added the sauce like someone else had mentions over the top.  It did turn out really good.  But the only thing is that i have 2 that are not big fans of BBQ so they did not like it.  But if you do like BBQ this is really good.

Delicious! This is the best meatloaf recipe I've found. I put my sauce on top rather than on the bottom of the pan. I prepared it with 1/2 cup ketchup, 1 tbsp. of worcestershire sauce, and 1/4 cup brown sugar. I also reduced the milk to 1/2 cup and used only 1 egg. I used Italian bread crumbs rather than crackers. I added 2 cloves of garlic and a about a cup of chopped celery. I also added another tbsp. of worcetershire to the meat. Fantastic! 4 stars because I heavily modified this recipe from the original version.

There is nothing that can be done to make this recipe any better! I make mine with 2 pounds of beef (more leftovers!) so it takes about 20 minutes extra to cook. I have made this 10 times, and it's my husband's favorite meal. The brown sugar seeps into it and makes it very juicy.

Truly great home cooking!!  Adjusted ingredients only for the following:  Used just under 1/2 c. brown sugar, just under 1/2 c. milk, no ginger, a sprinkle of onion powder and 1 tsp. dried minced onion instead of the onion and only 1 tsp. salt. Turned out really really really good!!  It's a keeper, thank you.

AMAZING!!!  The brown sugar and ketchup mixture is fantastic.  People were trying to guess what all the secret ingredients were. Little did they know this recipe is super simple!! Only thing I did different was that I made the loaves and spread the mixture on top.  It formed a nice crust and looked so appetizing.  You must try this meatloaf!

I tweaked this recipe a bit. Instead of putting the ketchup and brown sugar mixture at the bottom, I put it on top. I also added about a tablespoon of mustard to the mixture and about 2-3 tablespoons of brown sugar to the meat. Turned out delicious!!! Wonderful recipe!!!

I'm not a big meatloaf fan but,I love this recipe! I also put a little of the brown sugar and ketchup on bottom and poured the rest over the top after the loaves (I made 2 smaller instead of one big) had cooked for about 45 minutes. Returned it to the oven for 15 more minutes. I served it with mashed potatoes. My only complaint was that there were no leftovers for my lunch the next day! Thanks for a great recipe!

Succulent is the best word to describe it. It turned out juicy and my husband loved it. The only CHANGE I did was to pu the brown sugar and ketchup mix on top of it so that is got all the flavor.

LOVE LOVE LOVE, you will wake up at 3am to nibble this recipe as a snack!!! HOWEVER I made some changes that made this recipe a knockout which was I ID NOT put the brown sugar on the bottom but added it to the ketchup and put on top! AND instead of bread crumbs I used CRUSHED seasoned Stuffing! Ugh so good! This is my 6th or 7th time cooking this and its in the oven right now!!!

I made this exactly as is.  The only issues I had with it were when molding the loaf it was too runny to pre make the loaf, so we just put it in the pan. I would recommend skimming the grease off throughout cooking, when we took it out it was at least two inches of grease on top. My family complained that it tasted a bit too much like brown sugar so i'd probably cut the sugar in half next time.

My kitchen smelled yummy and my Family loved this! they ate the entire thing!!! I used the entire recipe as written except for onions and added: Onion soup, garlic salt, ground red pepper...  I did cook in a loaf pan, I treated the pan with baking spray and when the food was ready I drained the liquid form the pan and then was able to invert the pan and it easily came out --looked  great!  After dinner both my husband and son asked when would I make this again!

i have made this recipe for years. this is actually the first time i have seen the recipe on this site. sometimes i use ritz crackers and it is just as good. i always make two because one is never enough. i also like to use the pork/veal/beef mix - it is very moist. this is my family's favorite!

I love this meatloaf, tastes exactly like my mother in law's, which I love, and it is easy and quick to make. Note: Be carfull when serving this meatloaf as there tends to be a ton of drippings and sauce in the bottom of the pan and it can get messy when serving.

My family absolutely loved this meatloaf.  My stepdaughter said before dinner she hated meatloaf (due to having had a very gross version at her moms) but she said she would try it.  She went back for seconds and finished up the last of it later that night.  That's a huge compliment.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

Really disappointed with this recipe since it had such great reviews. Made it almost exactly like the recipe, except I didn't have saltines so I used breadcrumbs. Took 2.5 hours to FINALLY cook and it was WAAAAAAAAAAAY too sweet. Couldn't taste anything but the sugar. Will be trying something else from now on.

Very good recipe.  A little sweeter than what I hoped though.  I did add a little cheese through the meatloaf and on top which was nice and crusty after baking.  I would totally make this again, but with less brown sugar.

My husband loves meatloaf.  My daughters (10 & 5) not so much.  The husband thought this was the best, better then his mothers. I liked it as well.  My daughters thought it was o.k. that means it this is a keeper!

Tastes great, although I prefer to have the ketchup on on top of the loaf instead of at the bottom.

Excellent!  I did follow some of the recommendations in the reviews.  I put the ketchup and brown sugar on the top and only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  I also added a little garlic powder.  My husband liked it a lot and I thought it had great flavor.  This one is a keeper.

Simple and tasty. Followed some other reviewers suggestions and used 1/4 cup of brown sugar, and added worcestershire to the glaze. Also put the ketchup/brown suger mixture on the top. I will make this one again!

My fiance would not stop raving about this! He even said it was better than his mom's meatloaf!!! I did, along with a lot of others, put the brown sugar and ketchup on top. I also broiled it for the last 15 minutes so the ketchup crisped up. Delicious!!

Love this.  I follow the directions and it was perfect.  I tend to like things on the sweeter side.  A suggestion...put your meatloaf pan on a cookie sheet with foil.  This is an easier clean up.  Learned the hard way.

This was delicious!  As suggested. I didn't put the ketchup/brown sugar on the bottom, but on the top so it could cook into the meatloaf.  I skipped the salt, as I figured it probably had enough sodium in the recipe from the saltines and ketchup.  I did add a hearty shake of garlic powder (granulated garlic), because I love garlic and really couldn't imagine a meatloaf recipe without it!

Great meatloaf recipe.  I did not put it in the loaf pan but rather on a baking sheet and poured the ketchup mixture on top.

My entire family enjoys this meatloaf.  I make it at least twice a month, if not more!  We usually do not have left-overs but if we do my husband loves a meatloaf sandwich for lunch the next day.  Great recipe!

I doubled the recipe and made one with the ketchup and brown sugar glaze (on top as reviewers suggested) and one with spicy bbq sauce on top (1 cup).  I also added 1 tablespoon of worcestershire sauce to the liquid  before mixing it into the meat.  I also used the reviewer's suggestion to put pieces of bread down first.  I like the bbq sauce one better, but I like savory, not sweet, when it comes to meatloaf.  The brown sugar one will be more to one's liking if sweet meatloaf is your thing.  Great recipe though!  Definitely going into the rotation!

We thought this was very good.  A little too sweet though, so next time I will reduce the brown sugar a bit.  I didn't saute the onions as others suggested, but I did make it ahead and it sat in the refrigerator for 24 hours before I baked it, so it was all very moist and the onions were fine. It did take longer than the 60 minutes indicated to cook thoroughly (I use a meat thermometer to be sure).  Overall a great recipe.

I'm a vegetarian so I have to rely on my husband and son's comments. They enjoyed this very much! I did some changes as per other reviewers. Used 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs instead of crackers and only 1/4 cup brown sugar. I mixed the BBQ sauce and sugar together and then spread it on top of the meatloaf prior to baking. Next time, however, I'll lightly fry the onions before adding it to the meatloaf mixture. Even though the loaf cooked for an hour my son complained about the onions, but he doesn't mind them if they're fried first - personal choice. Also, I used ground turkey to make it healthier. Thanks for sharing!

Excellent Recipe. So simple to make and tasted delicious.  I have a 5 yr old and a 31/2 yr old and they both had several helpings. (which is unusual for them).  Definitely becoming one of my staples.

This is my very first allrecipes recipe!  It was awesome, easy to make and delicious!  I used the bread on the bottom to soak the grease (thanks reviewers!), used the mixture of ketchup/brown sugar on the topping and did use worscestershire in the topping (a splash) and a splash in the mix.  I used more brown sugar (because I like it sweet) than the recipe called for and used ritz crackers like somebody else used.  Awesome!!!!  I hope this recipe doubles well because I'm gonna need it to feed my 4 kids and my husband!   Thanks soo much Tangastar!

Excellent! I used a baking dish rather than a loaf pan, and put the glaze on the top -- 1/2 at the beginning and 1/2 at 30 minutes. Recommend increasing the temp to 400 and decreasing the time to about 45 min. This will set the glaze a little better. Needs to rest 10-15 min. before serving.

THIS IS THE BEST MEATLOAF- I found this recipe 2 years ago and it is the only one i use. You can switch the ingredients based on what you have. I took other reviewers suggestions and add garlic, no ginger, 1/2 c milk, 1 egg and 1 tbsp of worchestshire added to the 1/2c ketchup and 1/4 c brown sugar glaze that I add at the end. Is great with ground turkey as well

This was FABULOUS.  My husband said it was the best meatloaf he has ever had.  My 2 year old had 3 helpings.  My best girlfriend, a picky eater, had 2 helpings.  The ginger was a great touch. I used 2 pounds meat, and increased everything a little bit.  There were no leftovers between (3) adults and (2) kids.  We will 100% make this again.

Very good recipe! My husband doesn't typically like meatloaf and he really liked it! I did too. Will make again. Very small changes: I put the sauce on top and a tiny bit less b.sugar.  (I bake it on a steak broiling pan so the juice falls below.) Thanks!

For a person who never liked meatloaf, I have been making this meatloaf for 7 years and it has never failed!  I do cut the sugar in half and I preseason the meat with chopped parsley, cilantro, thyme and green onion (instead of onion) and a couple dashes of soy sauce.  I also use lawry's seasoning or Tony's cajun seasoning instead of salt.  Yummy!    For a less sweeter taste, you can add mustard to your sauce.

Just made this recipe tonight and my family loved it, and went for seconds. I formed the meat loaf in a baking dish, in order to drain during cooking, and put the sauce on top which stayed nicely. I would probably add adtl seasonings in the meat next time, and a bit less brown sugar in the sauce. But over all it was delicious!

YUM! I too put the brown sugar and ketchup on top of the meatloaf.  Since I'm not a big fan of onions, I also substituted the onions & ginger with a onion & mushroom soup mix and added a couple tablespoons of barbeque sauce into the meat mixture.  This is now one of my husband's favorite dishes!

loved it! I took the advice an made the meatloaf in a cupcake pan. It was perfect, so my husband knew how many he could have and they cooked much faster I did add some extra spices, and peppers. My husband did not like the sauce on bottom & top, so I would just make a few with hot sauce on the top for him.

This recipe produced a delicious, moist meatloaf. Better than another recipe I tried (from a cookbook). I followed some of the other reviewers recommendations in that I put the sugar and ketchup on top as I was making a freeform loaf, rather than it being in a tin. I wasn't too keen on the ketchup, a little too sickly for me. But the rest of the meatloaf was great, I'll make it again with a few changes.

Delicious every time. I spread the glaze on top of the meatloaf as suggested by other reviewers - it just makes more sense. Definitely tastes better with fresh ginger, but dried will do in a pinch.  I made a meat cake using this recipe for my boyfriend's birthday, and he loved it! I doubled the meat recipe and spread between 3 foil pie pans (easier clean-up), and spread the glaze on two of the layers. When they were done I stacked them up, trimmed the sides, and covered in instant mashed potatoes (they're creamier and easier to spread than homemade). He didn't even realize it wasn't a dessert cake at first, then when he cut into it, he was even more excited that it was meatloaf! Thanks for this great, great recipe!

Let me just say WOW! I have never in my life had homemade meatloaf. Ive only had it at the school cafeteria when I was a child. Needless to say, I was blown away by this recipe and can't wait to make it again and pass it on to friends and family. Thank you for posting it! (96)

I was looking for something to throw together for dinner, and this came out great. I did have to make some changes based on what I had in the house. I used potato flakes instead of saltines, and reduced the milk to 1/2 cup. I added a TBsp. of Worsteshire sauce to the ketchup/sugar mix, and put it on top instead of in the pan. I also put two slices of bread in the bottom of the 5x9. It was awesome, but next time, I think I'm gonna try it the way it's written. The sauce was really, really sweet, but the hubby loved it so we're good!

This is delicious...I won't be using another meatloaf recipe again.  However, I think placing the brown sugar and ketchup on top of the meatloaf is a much better way to get all of the great flavor.  This is great...thank you for a wonderful dinner choice!

If you put the sauce on top instead, this recipe is awesome.  I usually make tomato based meatloafs and was skeptical about one that did not even call for tomato paste but this was great.  Even my kids ate it!

Very good recipe.  I followed other reviewers ideas and used only 1/4 c of brown sugar and some worcestershire sauce, and dry mustard.  Only change I would make another time, is to cut back further on the brown sugar.  It was very sweet.

Giving this 1 star because the amount of liquid called for is WAY too much.

UPDATE: Added worcestshire sauce to meat and sauce, decreased milk to 1/4 cup, used onion soup mix instead of onion and omitted the ginger because I couldn't find it. Also used panko instead of saltines because we didn't have any. Still love the flavor of this recipe and gave the stars back with my tweaks.

As the recipe is written this has too much milk which made it mushy. It is also very sweet.  Of course if you make the suggested changes it may be better, but i will not even try this one again.

I really enjoyed this meatloaf.  I had to buy the ground ginger to make this, not sure that really made any difference in the taste, but I got it to use now.  Will make this again.

The recipe I found for this brown sugar meatloaf suggested that you butter the loaf pan well.  Then when it is finished cooking, let it sit on the counter for a few minutes, drain off any fat and then turn it upside down to serve.  That way the brown sugar/ketchup glaze is then on top.  The easy way to do this is to place a large platter over the loaf pan and flip over carefully -- worked for me!

Wow, thanks for this recipe! My husband, 12yr old and 9yr old all gave it a thumbs up (and these are picky kids!). I did do a few modifications after reading reviews, but I'm betting it would be just as good as is :) I had 1 1/4 lbs ground beef, so I lowered the brown sugar just a tad. I did add a tsp of Worcestershire sauce to the brown sugar and ketchup mixture. I don't do meatloaf in a loaf pan, it's not my thing, so I formed a loaf in a casserole dish, mixed the brown sugar, ketchup and Worcestershire sauce together and used it as a glaze on top. I added onion powder and garlic powder to the meat (I don't like onions in meatloaf). I used 1/2 cup plain bread crumbs instead of saltines (just easier). 1/2 c. milk and 1 egg instead of how it's written.

Delicious! I used Splenda brown sugar and did a bit on the bottom of the pan AND as a glaze w/ the ketchup on the top. It was quite tasty. For some reason my meatloaf wasn't very loafy though. Not sure if I had too many liquids or not enough meat.

Just needs a little extra seasoning. I had some parsley in the fridge so I chopped that up and threw it in and the herbiness was nice. I also put the glaze on the top as other reviewers suggested and it turned out well.

This is awesome!!! I did put the brown sugar and ketchup topping on top mixed with a little mustard and horseradish to taste. The meat need a little more salt and black pepper. I put 1 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper. Use more. Make extra ketchup topping for dippingand only use 1/4 cup brown sugar. Jeff liked it too!

This was a really yummy meatloaf and popular with my kids due to the sweetness.  I did use turkey burger, as we don't buy hamburger often, and subbed crushed Wheat Chex for the saltines to sneak in a little fiber.  Really great!

One of my favorites from this site along with the Rempel family meatloaf.  The only change I make is too put half the brown sugar & ketchup on the bottom and the other half on the top.

I've got this baking as I type...This is my first attempt at making meatloaf EVER, due to my dislike from having it when i was younger.  But i figured, why not try something "new" seeing as we had ground beef to use tonight.  Since it was just the two of us, I halved the recipe.  Reading the reviews and following suit, I added the brown sugar/ketchup on top instead of on bottom.  For the meat - 1lb ground beef, 1 egg, no milk, kosher salt, fresh cracked pepper, 8 smashed saltines, Onion Soup Mix, Worcestershire, liquid smoke, about 2tbs of bbq sauce, tabasco chipotle, ancho chili powder, and about 2 1/2tbs of garlic.  Mix well!  I lined a loaf pan with foil and put 2 slices of bread at the bottom to soak up the grease..(thanks to the reviewer who saw that tip on Food Network!) It works like a charm!  Top with Brown Sugar, Ketchup, a few shakes of the chipotle tobasco, and some more bbq sauce.  Smear over the top. Baking at 350 for 50minutes.  **Update with star rating**  Well, it had TONS of flavor, but was a little on the dry side.  I kinda had a feeling that 50 mins would be too long for my 1lb meatloaf.  I'm going to have to adjust the cooking time and possibly add a touch of the milk, but the Fiance says the recipe is a keeper!

I always use Cook's magazine version of meatloaf but it takes several steps.  This meat loaf was a wonderful and easy change.  The ginger is a nice flavor changer.  The glaze on the bottom gave a nice flavor all through the meat and I basted with it the last 20 minutes for a glossy top. Every one suggests adding this or that but then it is an entirely different dish.  This is nice and light tasting just as it is.  I did use ground pork and beef though because that was what I had on hand.  I'll save all the ketchup, worcestershire and steak sauce for the old recipe.

My husband made me rate this as 5 stars the first time I ever made it.  I also put the brown sugar and ketchup on top of the loaf. I use Ritz crackers and garlic in place of the onion.  I've never had a bad loaf with this recipe yet! Even the kids love it!

While I am not the biggest meatloaf fan, my husband and daughter love the stuff. This is my go to recipe when making that big hunk of meat! I have been making it for years and everyone loves it and even I, not a huge meatloaf fan , like it. I do have a few alterations though when making the glaze.  I halve the brown sugar, add about a Tbls. Lea and Perrins, about a tsp of dry mustard, 1/8 tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp garlic powder and 1/2 tsp Red Devil hot sauce. It's a sweet, spicy taste that everyone loves.

SO YUMMY!!! My boyfriend absolutely loves it when I make this.  The first time I made it he asked if we could have it for dinner 2 days later!  The glaze is so easy to make and I like to cook some in a sauce pan to serve along side the meatloaf!  I did however follow the crowd and put this glaze on top of the meatloaf after mixing all the ingredients together.  I didn't use milk either because I never use milk in meatloaf and 2 eggs will hold it together! The only other change I made was that when I make meatloaf I use 1lb of ground turkey and 1lb of ground sausage! Its a bit healthier and a lot more tasty!

Fantastic as is. This is my go-to meatloaf and everyone - even non-meatloaf types - love it. I've been told this is the only one I'm allowed make. But here is a substitution: Oatmeal for cracker crumbs. Really, you can use any filler or filler mix - crackers, bread crumbs, oatmeal. But that oatmeal is a great way to sneak in some extra fiber. Another technique tip I picked up is that after it's all blended kind of pick up the mass and drop/throw it down. It's fun and it helps ... condense ... for lack of a better word the meatloaf. My family likes it that way, but YMMV (your mileage may vary).

Delicious!!!!  But the topping is rather sweet. (I put the sauce on top) I halved the brown sugar the second time I made this and it turned out much more balanced though my husband thinks I could still reduce it.

YUMMY! I have made this recipe a few times now and just love it. I have always put the sauce on the bottom, but I think I will try it on top next to see how it works. I crush garlic and mix it in with the meat and add red pepper flakes to the sauce to make it a sweet/spicey combo - excellent!!!

Really good.  I think I will put the ketchup and a little brown sugar on top rather than the bottom.  I don't make meat loaf often, but I was surprized how much juice poured out when I was finished.  Thanks.

This meatloaf recipe was to die for.  I have never made a better meatloaf my whole life!  The menfolk loved it, and I was hoping there would be leftovers for sandwiches, but there wasn't any!  I wanted to follow the recipe to a T, but I didn't have saltines, or an onion.  So I used those buttery club crackers, and I grated 3 carrots.  I also added some dried sweet basil.  It was delicious.  I am asked to make this every weekend now.

My boyfriend and mother LOVED this recipe (and that's a high compliment from the boyfriend, who usually hated meatloaf). Also, this recipe reheats great in the microwave, so there is no wasting leftovers.

This is the go-to meatloaf for my family. Tastes awesome. Brown sugar and catchup glaze is simple, yet the key ingredient. A few changes for my preference: only one egg, half cup of milk, skip ginger. Thanks for the recipe!

This meatloaf was delicious.  My husband loved it and asked for it again in the near future.  This was easy to prepare and I cooked it for 1 hr 15 mins.  Changes I made per other reviews are:  1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup milk, 1 T. Worcestershire sauce and minced garlic.  I also used Panko Italian breadcrumbs.  I also added the brown sugar/ketsup mixture on top of the loaf.  Next time, I will double the sauce to use some when serving the pieces of meat.  YUM.....

I'm 54 and have been looking for the perfect meatloaf recipe my entire adult life.  This was sooooooo good.  I did make a couple of adjustments, based on reader reviews and personal preference.  I reduced the milk to about 1/2 cup and used dry onion soup mix.  I did not put the brown suger and ketchup on the bottom because I love my own topping.  I mix one cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup ketchup and one lbs. worchestershire sauce and spread on top last 15 minutes of baking.  Wonderful!

A pleasure!  I added some Worcestershire to the sauce (which went on top, with some left over) and some diced celery in with the onion as well.  It turned out beautifully.  Thanks for sharing this yummy meatloaf!

I make this meatloaf all the time and everyone that tries it loves it!  I just add a little mustard to the ketchup before spreading it on the brown sugar, add green and red bell pepper to the meat mixture, and use Ritz crackers instead of regular saltines. Yum!

Very good meatloaf.  I used Italian bread crumbs instead of saltines.  I also added a little worstishire and A-1 to the brown sugar mixture.  Last I didn't pack the brown sugar real hard, I didn't want the glaze to be to sweet.  It turned out awesome, probably the best meatloaf I've ever had!

Eh... not that great. Nothing special and a little too sweet even after cutting back on the brown sugar. I'll stick with my recipe. Check out my recipe box for a really great stuffed meatloaf with mushrooms, onions and cheddar cheese. Yummy

Wow, this was great.  I wasn't too thrilled to make meatloaf, but since my husband got a deer this year, I've been exploring different ways to cook up the meat.  I didn't have high expectations at all since I don't care for deer meat, and am not a fan of meatloaf.  I used the 1/2 c. brown sugar modification for the topping & a tbsp. of worchestire sauce.  For the meatloaf I used italian bread crumbs instead of crackers, and 1/2 c. flakes onions instead of cutting up one (my husband hates onions).  I did add 2 cloves garlic and took the advice of using 1/2 c. milk and 1 egg.  It was AMAZING!  I had seconds even!  My husband loved it & my kids at it up too.  Yum!  I finally found a way to cook the deer meat that I not only can tolerate, but actually like!  Thank you for sharing a great recipe!

The boys loved it! I used 1/2 cup milk, 1 egg, saute the onion and add a teaspoon of worcestershire to both the meat and sauce. I baked it on a broiler pan as someone suggested; just shaped the meat into a loaf....No grease on the bottom of the loaf!  Oh, and I used bread crumbs... the sauce makes this delicious! I really think you could use any meatloaf recipe and just add this sauce.

This was excellent - best meatloaf I ever made and I've tried many recipes. The kids loved it. Didn't have any ginger, so I took a risk and substituted cinnamon - loved it!  This is a keeper.  Thanks tangastar!

I made one minor change to this meatloaf, I used turkey burger, simply because I didn't have beef.  I did not make any other changes.  I even resisted the temptation to put the ketchup on top.  It was fantastic meatloaf.  The bottom got this amazing texture and flavor - much better than ketchup pasted on top like traditional meatloaf.  In addition, the ketchup and brown sugar made a great sauce to spoon over the cuts of meatloaf.  It is true that the sauce is very sweet - so you could adjust as others have suggested.  This is how I will make meatloaf from now on.

MMM yummy! Usually I make a more "italian style" meatloaf with lots of parmesan cheese, but I was out of parmesan today and tried this as an alternate. My kids LOVED it, thank you for posting it.

I followed ideas of others with 1/2 cup of milk and 1 egg.  I added green pepper and 1/2 cup of salsa to the meat.  I also added about 3 tablespoons of salsa to the ketchup and brown sugar mix. It turned out wonderful.  My children and husband ate it all.

Have I had better meatloaf, yes.  Is this a good simple meatloaf, yes.  I used a meatloaf ground meat mixture from the butcher that consisted of 1/2+ lb beef and 1/2+ lb pork.  Neither my husband nor I enjoy beef only meatloaf.  I still followed the recipe and the ingredient measurements despite the fact I had only a lb+ of meat and not 1 1/2 lbs as the recipe stated. I suppose that's why my meatloaf didn't form into a loaf nicely that I could cook in parchment paper as I'd have liked. I did up my cracker crumbs to 1 c., however. I also shredded my onion (instead of chopping) with 4 carrots and added to meat mixture.  I divided my meat mix into 2 pans to make 2 small meatloafs, as there are only 2 1/2 (17 month old!)of us eating! Like other reviews I opted not to put the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom of the pan. And instead mixed together and spread on top of meatloaf when it was done, putting it back in the oven to warm.  I did not cook my meatloaf for an hour but instead to 165 internal temp.  With the smaller size of my meatloaf this took maybe 30 minutes.  It was actually finished cooking before I expected!  I'd have liked to spread the sauce on with cooking time still remaining to "cook" the sauce up a bit on top of the loaf.  Oh, well!  It was OK.

This was fantastic.  I did make some changes based off of others reccomendations in the reviews.  I put 2 pieces of bread on the bottom to absorb the grease.  I decrease brown sugar to 1/4C, used 1/2 C of milk and 1 egg.  I also used onion soup mix and spread glaze over the top.  I also topped with 3 slices of bacon.  Great meal!!

I thought this was too sweet. I would decrease the sugar next time. I also added a variety of vegtables - corn, broccoli, tomatos and carrots - to add flavor as well as a variety of spices. I used 2 tsp of pepper, 1 tsp of cumin, 1/2 tsp of chili pepper and 2 bay leaves. Next time I would also add garlic.

A change to the normal tomato based topping, this recipe was simple to make and delicious.  Followed to the letter.  No leftovers untouched.

Thie is a keeper.  It is not your typical recipe.  I just pour the brown sugar & ketchup on the top.  I also add 1t. of worcestershire o the meat to balance the sweetness.  I substitute 1 pkt of onion soup mix for the fresh onion & I use bread crumbs instead of crackers.  It is very easy & delicious.

Moist, flavorful, delicious! I didn't have bread crumbs, so I used 3/4 cup of quick cooking oats. I also didn't use a loaf pan. I mixed the ketchup and brown sugar and spooned about 1 tbsp of the mixture into the bottoms of a 12-muffin tray, then made the beef mixture into balls and placed them into the muffin tins. I reduced the bake time to 45 min, and the little meatloafs were perfect! My husband and I ate just about all of it. Will make over and over again.

My family LOVES this recipe!  My husband is very picky, but he absolutely loves the sweet glaze on this meatloaf.  I have to admit, I think it's the best meatloaf recipe I've ever found.  I follow the recipe exactly and it's awesome every time!

A big hit. I cooked this for my husband and some friends and they couldn't stop talking  about it. The sweetness of the brown sugar and pairs well with the tang of the ketchup and ginger. Defenitely keeping this recipe around!

Great basic meatloaf recipe. I added a teaspoon of garlic powder and a tablespoon of worstershire sauce to the mixture, also used only 1/2 cup of milk and used seasoned bread crumbs instead of cracker. Like many reviewers, I put the brown sugar/ketchup on top. Be careful -- the brown sugar makes it pretty sweet, so cut it back if that's not what you're looking for.

This made a pretty good meatloaf.  I put the brown sugar and ketchup on top as well and it was good.  We'll probably be using this recipe again.  My husband and I have different preferences in meatloaf.  He enjoyed this recipe a lot.

It was after only one bite that the hubby starting raving.  Fantastic meatloaf.  I found it took some of the sweetness down by adding 1/4 cup of mustard to the ground beef mix.  I followed the others advice and put two slices of bread at the bottom to absorb the grease and mixed 1/4 c of the ketchup with the brown sugar for the topping.  Great recipe.

This recipe is so good! I baked it with the ketchup/brown sugar mix on top, as was suggested by one of the other reviews. I also added 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon. This was a big hit in our house. I'll definitely be making it again.

I use ground turkey or hamburger-whichever I have on hand.  The ketchup mixture makes a great glaze, and bread on the bottom of the pam soaks up the grease. If you are short on time, make meatloaf muffins.  My fiance always jokes about them, but has no problem finishing them off!

As is, the recipe is just ok.  With the following additions, it's pretty good:  2 slices cheap bread in bottom of pan to absorb fat; 2 cloves garlic, minced; 1 tsp. cumin; dash cayenne pepper.  As other cooks, I mixed the brown sugar and ketchup and used it as a glaze.

This recipe is delicious!!!! My husband loves it and when he eats leftovers that means it MUST be good. I put the ketchup and brown sugar on the bottom but when there is 20 minutes left I put a mixture of ketchup and brown sugar on the top as well. That makes it covered! It tastes really great!!

A very moist and delcious meatloaf - our favorite, I haven't tried another since finding this recipe!  Only change I've ever made was to use crushed croutons instead of the crushed crackers - just simply yummy!

Best meatloaf recipe ever.  Easy to prepare and a winner everytime I make it.   The only thing I do-is instead of adding a small onion, I use French's -French Fried Onions instead.  They add wonderful flavor and disappear when cooked.  The kids never know they are in there but adds great flavor.  I also omit the giner.  Try it, you won't be disappointed.

We halved the glaze and put half on top and half on the bottom, but we found it a little sweet. I think next time we'll use half the brown sugar. We also used bread crumbs instead of crackers and overall it came out delicious. Super moist!

Great flavor and easy to make with basic household ingredients. My kids and dinner guests loved this! I'd recommend doing half of the brown sugar and ketchup (1/4 c each) on the bottom of the pan and the remainder as a glaze on top. I added a Tbsp of Worcescershire to the glaze on top and it added a nice kick without being overpowering. I also used bread crumbs instead of saltines and it turned out really tasty!

As suggested by others, I used onion soup mix, Tb brown sugar, and 1/4 brown sugar.  Also, I put the sauce on top.  Very good.

Everybody seems to love it, so I tried it, but it wasn't for me. I'm more of a hamburger consistency meatloaf lover (like mama used to make), and this was not it. I mixed just enough to blend the ingredients, but it was smooth, like I over did it... I'm used to BBQ sauce on meatloaf, and I wish I would've gone with my gut and did it, because the brown sugar & ketchup sauce was weak.

I thought this meatloaf came out great! I also spread the ketchup mixture on top (and following the recipe, I had a lot - didn't use it all). I placed a slice of bread in the bottom of the pan to soak up grease. Also, I was short on bread crumbs so I used 1/2 cup bread crumbs and 1/4 cup old-fashioned oats. I also laid 2 strips of bacon down the top. Loved it! Was still tasty as leftovers too.

OMG, this was SO good!  Per another reviewer's suggestions, I only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar, and just 1 egg.  Also, I added 1 tbsp of Worcestershire to the ketchup before putting it in the pan (on the bottom, which I think is genius, btw!  Ketchup on the top bakes into a weird "skin" that I hated on my mom's meatloaf as a kid), and 2 cloves of minced garlic to the beef.  This came out moist, flavorful, and absolutely perfect!  I think I'll try adding some crushed red pepper flakes for a bit of a kick next time, but this will DEFINITELY be one of our dinner staples!  Thanks!

Husband said this was the best meatloaf he has ever tasted. Said he would pay $20 for this in a restaurant. Like other reviewers I put the brown sugar and ketchip mixture on top of the meatload. I also added worschetire sauce to the ketchup. Excellent dish, and even better the day after.

This was very good! I also put the glaze on top of the meatloaf. It didn't burn at all and it came out nice and shiny. Also used Ground Turkey instead of Beef. It was very tender, not too sweet, and very good!

I'd never had Brown Sugar Meatloaf, so I decided to give this a try. I just pulled it out of the oven...First of all, it smells heavenly!  Second of all, it tastes so good that I can't stop picking at it!  I didn't follow the directions to a T, though.  Instead of crackers, I used oatmeal.  I omitted the salt and ginger, and decided to throw in some crushed garlic.  I also crumbled up black-peppered bacon (i fried it first) then mixed it in with the meat.  And like a lot of other people, I put the glaze on top of the meat, not the bottom of the pan.  Luv it!!!!

I think this recipe is a fantastic base. I omitted the milk and also brushed the sugar/ketchup mix OVER the meatloaf because it just makes more sense to me to do it that way :o) I also made a "bread bed" for the extra oil. All in all a keeper, just add your own flavor and kick to the meat!

Followed another reviewers suggestions: I only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar. - I added 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to the ketchup/brown sugar mix. - I used 1/2 cup of milk and 1 egg. - I added 2 cloves of garlic to the meat mixture. cook in muffin tins. I double the ketchup/brown sugar mix and put on bottom and top of each mini loaf. I always make it with ground turkey.

My husband never liked Meatloaf until I found this recipe.  Umm good.  I mixed cayenne pepper along with the brown sugar into the ketchup and poured it on top of the meatloaf.  I also used the advise of putting bread down in the bottom of the casserole dish to absorb the fat.  I also added a little finely crushed bell pepper and a tablespoon of worcestershire.  Thanks for sharing.

Great Meatloaf!  I skipped the Ginger, b/c I didn't have any!  I was a little unsure about the Brown Sugar.  But my husband loved this dish!  Will definitely make it again.

amazing. however, LINE THE PAN with non-stick foil or your going to have to wash the pan multiple times (can't stress this enough)..also definitely add the worcestershire sauce to glaze and meat; i put bacon on top, and no salt needed...

My husband and kid loved it.  I made some changes though...1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 tbsp of Worcestechire, and spicy ketchup for the topping.  Then 1/2 cup milk, 3/4 italian style breadcrumbs instead of crackers, 1 egg, and I also sauteed an onion and some garlic and let it cool before putting it in with the rest of the ingredients.

My husband rated this a 4 1/2!!  We are always looking for a great meatloaf recipe.  This was a good one!  Used a mix of ground beef & pork.  Cooked the onions a bit in a little butter before adding to the meat mixture.  Also cut back on the brown sugar as many recommened.  It still was a bit sweeter than I'd like.  Added a squirt of mustard to the glaze...and added that to the top of the loaf.  I placed a couple slices of bread in the bottom of the pan to absorb the grease.  Great trick if you haven't tried it!  Used Italian bread crumbs, as that's what I had on hand.  Very versatile recipe!!  Next time, I will make 2 loaves....so there is plenty for sandwiches the next day!

3397 people can't be wrong! Like others, I decreased sauce brown sugar proportion and topped sauce to the meat mixture instead of on the bottom as originally called for. It's truly a super-quick and fuss-free winning recipe and WE (hubby and I) will definitely make it again… again… again and again!!!

I modify most recipes as in my 35 years of cooking it is difficult for me to have a set recipe because I try new things. Because I have kids that do not like certain vegetables I continuously place the veggies in the meat. So along with the garlic and onions, I also placed in one small carrot. Also I have always added some ketchup and dark mustard into the meatloaf to add flavor. For the top sauce I add a 1/4 cup of bourbon to spruce it up a bit. The kids eat it up.

Too sweet. Per others' suggestions, I cut the brown sugar in half, but still found it to be too sweet. The texture & moistness of the meat were outstanding, so I'll use the meat part of the recipe again, but use a different topping.

As a newlywed, I made a terrible meatloaf. Due to my husbands reaction to that, I've waited 15 years to attempt meatloaf again. If this one wasn't good, I would never make meatloaf again.  Well, this recipe was delicious and more of this meatloaf will be in our future.  I put the sugar/ketchup mix on top of the loaf instead of at the bottom.  It came out perfect.

This is my husbands favorite meatloaf. Every time I make a meatloaf I use a different recipe,when I made this he said "That is the ONE!" The only thing I did different was use bread crumbs instead of the saltine crackers.

This is one of the quickest and easiest recipes for meatloaf.  I've made it several times and it's always a big hit.  I substitute seasoned bread crumb for the crackers. A++

I'm rating this 5 stars because I found it great after making a few additions.  I added garlic powder and celery salt for the spices.  I added chopped green pepper with the onion.  You could even add shredded carrot and chopped mushroom for more veggies.  I took the advice of others and added lemon juice and worchestershire sauce to the mixture as well as putting the glaze on the top after I poked a few holes into the loaf. I would definitely make it again!

Loved it!  From the reviews I made the following changes: Formed into a loaf and cooked in a casserole dish on top of sliced bread to soak up the grease, put glaze on top of loaf, included:  garlic and dry mustard in meat mixture which consisted of 2 parts ground beef to 1 part ground pork. I also added 1 1/2 tsp of worchestershire sauce to the glaze.  Very tasty!
UPDATE: This is now in the monthly family rotation.  In addition to the above changes, I also use 1/2 a package of onion soup mix in place of the onion. I also use 1/2 C milk instead of 3/4 C.
A potato masher works well to mix everything together and save your hands from the mess.
Another good glaze:
ketchup, honey and worchestershire
Enjoy! You can't go wrong with this recipe.  Thanks, tangastar!

5 Stars!  I have had a meatloaf recipe that I had for years and my husband does not like to try new recipes however he loved this.  I used breadcrumbs instead of crackers.  I never have any leftovers.

I was very skeptical of this recipe since I usually don't like sweet things, but I ended up loving it! I will make it again. It didn't have crackers so I used 2 cups of breadcrumbs and some salt and it turned out great.

Used BBQ sauce instead of ketchup.  Also, added 1/2 pork sausage and a tsp dry mustard.  Skipped the milk, too.  The loaf was beautifully placed on the brown-sugar BBQ sauced and baked @ 1 hour.  Husband was reaching for MORE!

This was really good.  The only thing was it was a bit too sweet so next time I will use less brown sugar, I also mixed the brown sugar and ketchup together and put it on top.  I added 1 tbls worchestshire sauce to it and I think the next time will add 2 tbls.  I didn't even notice the ginger that went into this so maybe next time will make it without it and see if I notice anything missing.  All in all a great recipe that makes a very moist meatloaf.

Took the advice of other reviewers, used seasoned bread crumbs, celery and baked them in muffin pans and put worchestire sauce in the mix. It came out very juicy and tastey!

was very easy to make, i didn't have ginger but it didn't make a difference. i also added bread crumbs and sprinkled them on top before baking. my only suggestion is to add some salt. the brown sugar makes it very sweet. this is a wonderful simple dish and i will make it again for sure!

The brown sugar adds a tasty touch to the meatloaf. I cooked the mini loaves and my husband ate two before dinner was ready. He really loved it!!! The kids normally eat a one serving helping-well not this time. They went for seconds!!!! Thank you-I only made a few adjustment after reading the reviews. I used 90% lean beef and I did not have to pour any liquid off. I used the Lipton soup mix instead of the onions. I put the ketchup glaze at the bottom and top. Other than that It's delicious!!!!

Fantastic recipe! I use a special meatloaf pan that elevates it off the bottom so that the meat doesn't sit in the grease. I also glazed the top with ketchup and added a few slices of bacon. Yummmmy!

Excellent recipe! I put the brown sugar & ketchup on top so the flavors would seep down into the meat rather than just sit in the bottom of the pan. Also excellent for cold meatloaf sandwiches the next day!

This was very good. Next time I will make it as another reviewer did and not use the loaf pan and put the glaze on top. Definitely a keeper.

Thanks Tangastar Quick and Easy just the way I like them.  My wife liked it also.  I use a meat loaf pan with a lift out.  I first line the pan with aluminum foil covering the lift out.  Then once baked I just poke a couple of holes in the foil to dry out the meat.  Then use the remaining sauce with a little flour for a quick gravy.

I am not a meatloaf fan, but this was WONDERFUL!  Super easy to make and the flavors belnd so nicely together.  I mixed 1.5lbs ground beef with 1 egg, 1/2c milk, 3/4 cup crushed rice krispies (needed to get rid of them) 4 cloves garlic, small minced onion, salt, pepper, and ginger.  I used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1 Tbl worsteshire sauce in the ketchup mix. Instead of placing the glaze on the bottom, I poured it on top. Cooked it covered for an hour in a loaf pan and it was scrumptous!  Next time, I will pour the glaze on the meatloaf after 45 min of cook time so that I can drain the grease without the slaze trying to drain off as well.

This is a keeper!!! I followed everyone else's suggestions by putting the glaze on top. Also decreased the brown sugar to 1/4 cup and added worcestershire sause. I substituted the onion for minced only because of a dislike in the family. Next time I'm going to try someone else's suggestion of placing bread on the bottom to soak up the grease...had to drain it many times. If that works then it is worth 5 stars for sure!!! :)

Thank you--Tangastar!!!! I up it to 12 servings and mixed in 1 pound of sausage along with small redskin potatoes (8) and a whole large sweet onion copped. Also put some sauce on bottom of roaster and rest on top of meatloaf. All who ate it gave me high praise. PS. it made a great late night cold sandwich--Johnflag

Wonderful! This dish was eaten up in a flash. For my first attempt at making meatloaf, it was a simple recipe. I followed others and split up the brown sugar/meatloaf mixture evenly between bottom and top (would add more on top next time). Also added worchestershire sauce. Didn't have ginger, so added cinnamon and allspice instead; didn't notice a difference. Will definitely make again!

Normally I make turkey meatloaf and was looking for a change but never had any luck with a beef loaf but this one was nearly perfect. The only thing I did different was put the ketchup and brown sugar on top. Next time I will use less sugar, it was a tad bit too sweet.

So yummy! It got rave reviews from my boyfriend, who has never had meatloaf. I followed what some other reviewers recommended and used 1/2c milk and 1/4c of brown sugar instead of the full measurements. I also put bread in the bottom of the pan to soak up the grease.  So soo good! A new favourite!

This is great recipe. I did make a few modifications. I added minced garlic, and onion to the meat, only 1 egg, 1/2 cup milk, and 1 cup of cracker crumbs. Put the glaze on top. turned out great. Will make again.

My first time cooking meatloaf and holy cow how easy was this.  Dont forget to throw some bread slices in the bottom of the loaf pan to soak up the grease.  Also, dont put the sauce on the bottom put it on top right from the get go.  I have never had upside down meatloaf and no need to change things.  Excellent recipe.

We loved it.. I have already made it so many times and we have enjoyed it with different side dishes... I did follow other suggestions though.. I used 1/4 cup brown sugar and put the ketchup/brown sugar sauce on top...

This meatloaf is outstanding!  I put the glaze on the top and added a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce and hot sauce.  I also used dried breadcrumbs instead of crackers but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The texture of the meatloaf is towards the smooth side.  I prefer a more "meaty" textured meatloaf so next time I'll adjust the milk/breadcrumbs ratio.  I served it with oven-roasted new potatoes.  Thanks tangastar!

easy and tasty.  the brown sugar and ketchup on bottom boils up through the meat and makes it moist and leaves some good juices at the bottom as well!

This is the best meatloaf recipe. I use  ground turkey instead of ground beef. You can also cut down on sugar and it's still good.

This recipe was okay, but I've been making the Tantalizingly Tangy Meatloaf (found on this site) for years, and that one is much better.  Like others, I added the sauce to the top of the loaf, rather than the bottom.  It was definitely moist, but maybe a little too much so.  I think I'll stick with the other, superior recipe from now on.

I've made this many times and it's been delicious.  The last time I made it, I didn't have enough ketchup, so I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce...that was some good eating(I put the b.sug and bbq sauce on top). I also added W sauce like others suggested and I use quick oats instead of crackers...yummy! Thanks for the recipe.

My whole family loves this including myself and I'm not a big meat eater. I do change a couple things. I only use ground turkey meat. Also, I use a combination of crackers, oats, and/or bread crumbs (whatever I happen to have or feel like), and increase it to 1 cup. Delicious!

Fast became a staple in our house, and my kids don't eat meatloaf!  It's the most requested meal in the house.  I poured through the reviews and made a few adjustments based on what I read:   To the meatloaf mixture, I added 2 cloves of minced garlic, a tbsp of worcestershire sauce, used 1/2 cup of milk instead of 3/4, and I used bread crumbs instead of cracker.  To the glaze: I added 1 tbsp of worcestershire, and reduced the ketchup and brown sugar to 1/4 cup.  I did not like the glaze at the bottom of the loaf.  My pan has drain holes at the bottom, and it made a mess.  Using a regular loaf pan, the bottom comes out mushy.  To get around a spill over, I took a spatula and made a small "ditch" between the pan and the loaf, and spread the glaze over the top and into the ditch.  That works wonderfully, and the glaze is always perfect.  Definitely a keeper in the recipe box!

This was one of the best meatloaf recipes I have ever ate. I wouldn't change a thing in this recipe. Majority of the time when I do follow recipes, I do some minor changes, but I was reading some of the other reviews and they all said they wouldn't change a thing, so I kept it original. I plan on making this meatloaf for dinner with friends and family. I'm defiantly keeping this and sharing this recipe to many people.

This is THE BEST meatloaf!!! I was skeptical at first, because I wasn't sure I would like the sweetness, but it was AWESOME. The only two changes I made were swaping out the saltines for panko, and wisking the brown sugar and ketchup together, then pouring over the top. So good!

I followed the advise of others for the changes. It was ok but would not make again. I think when you have a good meatloaf recipe stick with it, and my own recipe out beats this.

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe. I did not think the meatloaf would have much taste, due to the few ingredients -but it did. I do not use a meatloaf pan - I form my loaf on a rack on a  foil covered baking sheet..the fat collects below and the meatloaf comes out perfect. Other than NOT using a meatloaf pan, I did not alter the recipe - it is very good. I have used this recipe twice, and will probably continue.

Oh my goodness, I love this recipe! It really is the best meatloaf I've ever had. The only change is that I use Club crackers instead of saltines. The texture is just a little bit nicer with club crackers.

ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS! I've modified the recipe a little bit according to the previous recommendations: 1. put glaze on the top - 1/4 cup of  brown sugar + a few splashes of Wostersh. sauce + 1/2 cup of ketchup. 2. sauteed the onions in Wostersh. sauce before adding them to the meat mixture. 3. use less milk - 1/2 cup. 4. add bread crumbs instead of crackers.  My husband said he had never tried a meatloaf that was better than this, even his grandma's!! And usually he is very reserved, but today he praized me after the first bite!

i have never made meatloaf before, but i decided to try this recipe with the garlic mashed red potatos i also found on the site. AMAZING. I did use a few reviewer recommendations - added bread crumbs instead of saltines and i also used a loaf pan and layered the meat mixture with the ketchup and sugar mixture, in a napolean style. it looked great and tasted even better! also loved the addition of celery and used minced onion instead of the soup mix or powder. GREAT! keeping in my "personal" file :)

This was so juicy and YUMMY!! I put half of the glaze on bottom and the rest on top. I covered with aluminum foil for 50 min. and uncovered for 10 min. I did use bread crumbs and also put some oats in mine. My three year old picky eater ate two helpings in no time. That is a winner for me!!!!!

I followed this recipe as-is, and it is perfect.  It is the best meatloaf I have had.  The brown sugar and ketchup at the bottom make this saucy, gravy-like mixture that tastes sweet.  It goes perfectly with the meat.

I followed the advice of others and put half the glaze on bottom and half on top, added worchestire sauce to the glaze, used a large onion, and substituted oatmeal for the cracker crumbs. My husband is a gourmet and usually won't have anything to do with meatloaf, but he raved about it. His brother, who is afraid of anything besides plain cheese pizza and burgers with no toppings also loved it.

This recipe was GREAT, I like meatloaf now! My Mom used to make meatloaf all the time and I HATED IT, so I never cook meatloaf just because of that experience. However, money has been tight and ground beef is cheap....I got sick of taco's so I decided to make meatloaf. I'm going to put this recipe in my regular rotation of meals. I made alterations to the recipe though; instead of 3/4 cup of milk I used 1/2 cup. Also I didn't have crackers on hand so I used dried bread crumbs. I also put 2 large cloves of garlic in the meat mixture, and instead of putting the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom I put it on the top. I'm not sure if my alterations made much of a difference but it works for me.

Great recipe! I, too, made some minor modifications to suite my preference, however. I added 3 crushed garlic cloves to the meat along with 1 tbsp. worcestershire sauce and a dash of Emril spice. The biggest change though was that I used ground turkey instead of beef, which made the texture a little too soft, but the taste great. Very, very yummy recipe!

This meat loaf is increadible. I tried it with the sauce on top and on the bottom.I found that the sauce being on the bottom actually gave a very good flavor. I enjoyed this way the best.

This recipe was wonderful.  I do not like chunks of onions, so I subed in dryed minced onion one time and the other time I used onion soup mix.  Both turned out great.  I did the brown sugar/ketchup glaze on top instead of the bottom as others had suggested.  Also to help eliminate the the meatloaf sitting in the grease, on the bottom of the pan I add one or two slices of bread and it absorbs the grease right up.  Thank you so much for a true dinner pleaser for my whole family.

I loved the recipe.  I put the glaze on the top instead of the bottom.  I also added carrots and bell peppers (about 1/4 a cup of each) to add more flavor and textures.  I really do think the ginger is what adds the specialness in this recipe.  Oh, I also used Ritz crackers as that was all we had in the house and it held everything very well.  Thank you!

This dish was tasty. Glazing was a little sweet for my taste even though I already reduced the ketchup and sugar by half. Next time I will reduce them by a little bit more. Next time I will use 2.5 TBSP brown suger, 5.5 tbsp of ketchup, and 1 tbsp worcester sauce. For the Meat load, I also added 2 tbsp of worcester sauce, 1 tbsp of garlic, used 1 egg, used 1/2 corn flakes and 1 tbsp of bread crumb instead of 1/2 of bread crumb. As other readers suggested, I put slices of fajita bread on the bottom of the pan to soak up the grease, spread 1/4 of the glaze on the bottom, fill in the meat load, then put the remaining glaze on the top. I baked it for 1 hr. It was juicy and tasty.

This one is definitely a grand slam! I made it as is with the only change I made was to put the sauce on top with a small splash of worstershire sauce in the mix. This one was definitely knocked out of the park. I used really lean ground beef, and still spooned off any excess greases. This recipes is a great submission. My hat is off to the poster. :)

AMAZING! I have made this recipe at least 8 times. My husband, VERY VERY PICKY 2 year old, and I LOVE THIS! The only thing I change is I put the sauce on the top and not the bottom....don't know why they recipe says to put it on the bottom of the pan, kind of odd. Anyways the flavor is so good and it is easy to make as well. Thank you for the recipe

As written this recipe was great!  However, I made some adjustments which turned out DELICIOUS and moist!  First of all, in the preparation of the meatloaf I use bread crumbs instead of crackers, I added about 1/4 cup of cheese (I added Mozzarella and Provolone shredded), I cut the eggs in half and only added one, I also reduced the milk and added only 1/4 cup, then I added half of a tomato (diced really small) and a splash of worcestershire sauce.  Last, I added 2 cloves of garlic (crushed through my garlic press), baked as the recipes says.  I also added the sauce (with 2 splashes of worcestershire sauce) to the top of the meatloaf.  Half at the beginning and the other half for the last 15 minutes of cooking.  This came out so goooooood!  My hubby LOVED it!  Took it to work the next day and everyone in the lunch room kept asking him what he had because it smelled so good!  Thanks for the recipe!

I substituted dry onion soup mix for the onion and put the brown sugar and ketchup on top of the meatloaf like others suggested.  I didn't have saltines so I used TownHouse multigrain crakers instead. It was a very dense meatloaf but moist and good.

This is the best meatloaf recipe that I have ever had.  My husband and my kids love it!  Like others, I also use a little less milk than what it calls for.  I think I am going to try it with the brown sugar and ketchup on the top next time.

I have tried many meatloaf recipes and I have to say this was great! I usually don't write reviews on the recipes I try but this one is worth it. I made it exactly as the recipe was written (except I put the ketchup mixture on top) and it came out great. My boyfriend agree's it was the best meatloaf he has ever ate also, from now on this will be our recipe for meatloaf. The only things I will change to suit our taste is to add a little celery salt to the meatloaf mixture and increase the ginger (we love the taste of it) and with the topping I will reduce the amount of brown sugar and add a few splashes of worchestershire sauce.

I really liked this recipe, but my bf thought it was too sweet...maybe put in less brown sugar.  We also put the ketchup mixture on TOP of the meatloaf and used crushed Trader Joe Everything crackers instead of bread crumbs.

Very good & simple recipe.  Meatloaf was moist and generated a lot of juices.  You can definitely put the brown sugar and ketchup/bbq on top as well.

I would give this a ten if I could!  This is an absolute must have recipe.  I add about a tablespoon of steak sauce just for some flavor and I put ketchup on top.  My hubby asks for this at least once a week...great leftovers!

I have made the original recipe and loved it. Usually I chop up whatever vegetables I have at hand and add those as well for extra vitamins. The garlic is lovely as well and I do put the sugar/ketchup on top.

I made a few alterations, added garlic, green pepper and celery to the meat mixture and cut the milk to about 1/2 cup.  Also added about 1 tbsp. of worcestershire to the sauce mixture which I poured over the top.  With these alterations it turned out perfectly!

I too glazed with brown sugar/ketchup since my meatloaf pan has inner pan with holes to easy out loaf and drain juices to make gravy. I nixed the onion and added nutmeg as well. It's a very good recipe as is or varied.

Worked out pretty well. I used a ground beef and ground turkey combo, used breadcrumbs instead of crackers, added chopped parsley. Based on other reviews I put the glaze on top instead of bottom, and cooked it on slices of bread to soak up some fat.

I do not care for meatloaf, but this was better than any I can remember and my family loved it.  We, too, put the brown sugar and ketchup on the top and also added about a tbsp of worcestershire sauce to the mix.  To get my kids to eat veggies I diced bell pepper and carrots really small and added them to the meat.  Nobody even noticed!

I LOVE THIS RECIPE. I have made it twice and it is great. I have made a few changes but it is so good. I use turkey meat instead, I chop up fresh spinach (1c), and use a mix of old fashioned oats and the saltines. I also add some garlic and parsley to the loaf. Other than that all is the same. So Good. My family and I love this recipe. Will become a staple.

I would givew this 10 stars if I could! It was super yummy. I changed it up a bit. I added garlic pepper seasoning ans sauted the onions for 5 minutes and added worcheshire sauce to it. After I added the onion mixture to the beef and added italian seasoned breadcrumbs b/c I did not have saltines on hand. I also added the brown sugar about 1/4 cup to the ketchup and brushed the meatloaf with that. It was so good. The family loved it!!! I served it with gratin potatos and steamed asparugus with olive oil and lemon. The meatloaf was very juicy and moist. Thank you so much!!

My husband loved this meatloaf.  I made it exactly as stated in the recipe except, as suggested by others, I placed the brown sugar/ketchup on top. It was moist and the flavor was right on, which is great if your family isn't enthusiastic about highly seasoned food.  I, too, liked the light hand with the seasonings, which is unusual for me (hotter, spicier is my thing).  I gave it only four stars and, perhaps, it's my fault because I believe I packed the meat too tightly; I prefer a less dense meatloaf. It will be great for meatloaf sandwiches...with REAL mayo, salt, pepper, and white bread! Yum! My husband ate it for dinner, lunch, and then dinner again, so I will continue making this recipe:-)  I'm certain it will be five stars next time since I now know to use a lighter hand when mixing the ingredients.

This worked beautifully and was delicious! I wasn't sure about putting the glaze on the bottom of the pan, but I noticed that while the meatloaf cooked the juices rose up and saturated the meat with the flavors. Then after I drained the grease and poured it onto a serving dish, everyone was able to taste this excellent recipe. I am now replacing my mother's meatloaf recipe with this one for our family!

We have added this to our regular menu schedule. All 4 of us loved it and it was pretty quick and easy. I used an idea from another meatloaf recipe and prepared this in a cupcake pan which actually sped up the cooking time and made these perfectly portioned and evenly sauced.

This was AMAZING!! I have been cooking the same meatloaf my grandfather taught me how to make for over a decade. I wanted to change things up and tried this one based on the reviews. My husband and I LOVED this. I think it was the sweetness of the brown sugar that made it nice.  Definately give this one a try!

This is the only meatloaf recipe that I will ever make.  I follow the directions closely, but put the ketchup and brown sugar on the top.  Perfection everytime, my hubby can't get enough and now dislikes other meatloafs!

It's Valentine's day and I made this meatloaf in the shape of a heart.  It looked beautiful and tasted wonderful!  I added a little celery seed and dried parsley.  I halfed the cracker crumbs and added oatmeal for the rest.  The brown sugar and ketchup on the top of the heart made it look so festive!

Fantastic meatloaf that my kids can't get enough of! I used panko crumbs as that is what I had on hand, and added onion soup mix and Worcestershire sauce to the beef. I put the sauce both on the bottom per the recipe and also on the top as many suggest. Awesome!

I've never made meatloaf before, but for some reason I decided to try this one!  I loved it, and so did my husband!  Will definitely make over and over again.

This recipe is great!! I agree with the "author" putting the brown sugar and the ketchup on the bottom is the best! I am going to double the brown sugar & ketchup next time but other than that I wouldn't change a thing!!

I am proud to be the 3,000rd person to review this product!  I made the meatloaf with 2 eggs, 1/2 cup milk, 3/4 cheddar crackers, fresh onion, salt and pepper and 90% lean ground meat.   I mixed the brown sugar and ketchup together and put it on top. I put two pieces of bread underneath, like the reviewers suggested, to stop the grease.  It was pretty mushy when I put it in the oven and I was nervous it wasn't going to come out right.  About an hour and 16 minutes later, it was ready and it was good! The sauce on top was a little too sweet but the meat was moist and everything was delicious! My mom was impressed since this was the first meatloaf I have made.  I will definitely be making this again. Although I will say this dish creates quite the mess in the pan...but most good foods do!  Definitely worth trying, although I will not add so much sugar next time. I didn't even add all that much. Ketchup naturally does the trick.

We had this meatloaf for dinner last night, it was fantastic. The meatloaf was juicey and tender. I served this with asparagus on the side. I came across a number of meatloaf recipes, but this one is the simplest. Didn't change a thing at all. This is a keeper. Thanks!

Best meatloaf my family has ever had!  That includes a husband who generally doesn't like meatloaf and a picky 20 month old.  Only changes I made were to put the ketchup/brown sugar on top and add worchester sauce.  Also, substituted onion soup mix for onion.  Adds great flavor.

I only give it 5-stars because I took the advice of others and added onion and garlic. I used 1/2 c. of milk and 1 egg only.  I lined the bottom with bread and topped off the meatloaf with cheese. I will be making this more often! :)

My husband and I loved this meatloaf!  He is from Oklahoma, so he claims that he "knows good meatloaf"!  It was very moist and flavorful.  An easy, tastful choice for any day of the week!

This is excellent.  The ginger is such a nice touch.  This is a guaranteed hit if you're making it for anyone who already likes meatloaf.  I am usually somewhat indifferent to meatloaf, but this one is really nice!  It is by far the best one I've ever had and I will stick to this recipe in the future.

This was the second time I had made this recipe. The second time turned out much better than the first.  On the second time I only used one egg and about 1/2 cup of milk.  I also used 2 pounds of hamburger.  I put the glaze on top for the last 15-20 minutes.  I also let my cooked for an extra 10 minutes.

I made this last night and was amazed that I actually made meatloaf that I enjoyed!  It was so moist and flavorful.  I was actually afraid that the mixture was too wet, but it turned into a perfect meatload.  I combined several people's suggestions and made some changes.  I added beef onion soup mix rather than onions.  I also used regular bread crumbs instead of the crackers.  Then, I mixed the brown sugar and ketchup and added it to the top in the last 15 minutes.  I'm glad I did it.

So good and so easy! Like others mentioned I only added 1/4 cup of milk and onion soup mix. In addition I mixed the ketchup and brown sugar together and used as a glaze on top. My husband litterally scrapped the loaf pan clean of the sauce. Will make again! Thanks for a great recipie!

This is a nice moist meatloaf.  I made it according to the recipe with the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom.  I also used the 5 x 9 inch loaf pan.  It was perfect.  When you take it out, flip it over and the brown sugar/ketchup is on top.  When I spooned some "gravy" on a piece it was too sweet, so I'm glad I cooked it the way I did.

Very good! Followed others suggestions and reduced milk to 1/4 cup - it was plenty. I also mixed together the brown sugar and ketchup for the topping. Used meatloaf mix (beef,pork,veal) instead of just beef. Will make again.

I've used this recipe a few times now.  I have never used saltines but use either ritz crackers or oatmeal in place of.  It's the only recipe that reminds me of my mom's meatloaf.

Holy-moley this is good! I ate with Curried Spinach Soup and it was such a treat. I did tweak a bit- added worchester sauce to the top and put the sugar/katsup mix on both the bottom and top of the loaf. Also, I had more meat than the recipe called for so I added a bit more of most of the ingredients. Also, I added a mix of fresh and powdered garlic and instead of using powdered ginger I used fresh. Make sure to use the sugar because it really brings out the flavor of all the other ingredients! (I made one without just to test, and it wasn't nearly as good). Oh, almost forgot- I didn't have any bread crumbs so I used crushed Cheerios. Delish!

wow, it's rare that I like meat loaf... the only other ones I like is my dad's and mother in law's. After making changes to this to fit my tastes, this is now my fav! Even my husband claimed it as his fav and that it beats his mom's recipes, and her's is pretty dang good! What I did:
I used about 2 lbs ground beef, I didn't have any eggs so I just added a bit more milk, used seasoned bread crumbs instead of crackers, added 1 1/2 tsp garlic, didn't have onions so used onion soup mix, and as far as the glaze... I mixed the ketchup and brown sugar together and also added 1 tbsp worcestershire sauce and about 1/4 cup medium salsa; I then spread about 1/3 of the glaze on the bottom, let the loaf bake for about 35 minutes, then spread the rest of the glaze ontop of the loaf, and then let it bake for another 35 minutes... PERFECT!! Goes WONDERFULLY with the roasted red potatoes and asparagus side dish also found on this website.

My wife doesn't like meatloaf generally, but she loved this.  I think next time I think we should try to make meatballs with the same recipe...

Great meatloaf recipe!  The only thing that I would change is decrease the amount of onions in the loaf but that is a personal preference but besides that this has a great sweet taste to it and the kids will love it, minus all the onions : )

Best meatloaf I've ever had.  I may never try another recipe again. Delicious as written- even better with 1/2 the sugar/ketchup mixture on the bottom and 1/2 on top.
I keep coming back and making over and over.

This was only okay.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce and 2 cloves of garlic, but it was still too bland and overly sweet for me.  It's not foul by any means, just a very "blah" meatloaf.

This was good but not fantastic, my fiancé loved it and wants this in our regular dinner rotation.  I will admit that this has been one of the juicest meatloaves I've had in a while.

Really good meatloaf.  I used Ritz crackers and replaced the ketchup with BBQ sauce because I hate ketchup.  Also didn't add the glaze to the top until the last 30 minutes.

This was great! I hate re-heated meatloaf (too dry!) and I had a lot left over so I made a great casserole out of this. I broke up the remaining meatloaf with a fork until it looked like browned ground beef. Then I mixed it with some Ragu meat sauce and spread it on the bottom of a casserole dish. I made some mac and cheese (the kind with the cheese sauce- not the powder) and I spread that in a layer over the meat. I sprinkled the whole thing with cheese and baked at 350 until hot. It was really good with that yummy meatloaf meat!

This will be the only way I prepare my meatloaf.  My family loved the sauce.  I read the reviews and made some of the suggested modifications.  I put the sauce on the top instead of the bottom and I used onion soup mix instead of chopping a onion.  I forgot the milk so it was a little dry, next time I will add some milk.  I also used bread crumbs instead of the crackers.  This is a wonderful meatloaf.  This is a keeper.

This is the best meatloaf recipe ever! I have never had good luck with other meatloaf recipes. Either the meat was to dry or fell apart. I do substitute ground turkey for ground beef. I actually like the ground turkey better. I also use this recipe for homemade meatballs. My family likes me to put the brown sugar and ketchup mixture on the top of the meatloaf.

My family enoyed it!! I'm glad I read the reviews. I only used 1/2c of brown sugar, added some garlic, used the union soup mix. Since I used the saltine crackers I only used 1/2tsp of salt. Added some worcestire sauce to the brown sugar mix. Also did the bread on the bottom of the pan!! Really soaked up the grease!! Is in my box for keeps!

Easy and flavorful. I made one small change. I used leftover cooked white rice instead of the crackers. I've been using rice in my meatloaf for years, it soaks up the flavor so you don't need to use the bread on the bottom of the pan. For two pounds of meat I use 3/4 to 1 cup of cooked rice.

Easy recipe!  Yummy too!  I made the same changes as some of the other reviewers.  Sauce on top, bread on bottom to absorb some of the grease.  It was my husbands favorite dinner in a long time.

This is a kick a** meatloaf.  Some reviewers talk about putting the sugar and ketchup on top, don't when is on the bottom the meat juices mix up with the topping, just turn it over when is done.  It's fantastic, you will love it.

I did put the glaze on top of the meat loaf.  I also used advice of a previous poster and put two slices of bread in the loaf pan.  It was amazing.  My husband loves this and keeps on asking for it again and again.

My meatloaf-loving boyfriend thought this was 'delicious!' It was nice and tender and had alot of flavor, however I couldn't get the glaze to turn out right, it was kind of runny.  I will definately make it again, only try it with the sauce/glaze on top.

This recipe was delicious!!!  I only added a little bit of marsala wine to the recipe actually.

My boyfriend told me I won his heart all over again with this recipe and that it's WAY better than his mom's meatloaf (which is a HUGE compliment)!  Love the recipe and adding it to my book of keepers!

My family loves this meatloaf!  I make into smaller loaves on a jelly roll pan and put the sauce on top so I can control the portion size and they cook faster.

My kids (14,13, 12) now make it themselves and serve it to guests as well.

This is a great 5 star recipe.  I have fixed it many different ways, and it always turns out great.  I have made it with lean ground beef, I have made it with ground turkey, and I have made it mixing 1/2 pound ground pork in place of some of the meat.  I have never added the ginger (I don't personally care for ginger) but I've eaten it with ginger in it and didn't mind it at all.  I usually cut the brown sugar amount.  My whole family loves this recipe.  Good, good food.

I played with the ketchup/brown sugar mixture and put some on top and some on bottom...I also add more onion because my hubby and I love onion...everyone who has had this loves it. I've made it several times and it's always a winner.

This recipe was very simple and very delicious. I did as others and did not put the sauce on the bottom but rather it was spread on top. I followed the rest of the directions as is and it was super moist. Hubby loved it and our finicky 15 mos. old did, too!

I didn't read the reviews a head of time... so there are a few things that I migt have done differently (i.e. put the sauce on top)...BUT it did still turn out okay.  My boyfriend thought is looked "interesting," but after he tried it he thought it was suprisingly good.  Also got a thumbs up from our 3-year old. =)

I have made this twice. The 2nd time (as others suggeted) I put the ketchup/brown sugar & splash of worchester sauce on top instead of bottom & I did like it better that way. I felt it would be too watery so I just added another 1/2pd of meat & left all the measurments as is & it was really moist, the flavor was good, but I can't say it was really great. I will keep looking for a keeper. Thanks!

With some minor adjustments this could be fabulous.  It's a bit too sweet as is.  Next time I will use even less than 1/3 cup brown sugar, and add more dry mustard and worshershire sauce.  Didn't need  whole 1.5 lb of meat.  I cut back on the milk, added celery and bread crumbs.  Next time I will place bread under my meatloaf to collect some of the grease.

When I make a recipe from this site, I don't change a thing.  The kids and the husband loved this as it came off the site.  

If there was a 4 1/2 stars, we'd give that to this. (very, very few have made it to 5 stars - very picky family!)  Easy to make, easy to eat all down.  I've put it in my recipe box if that tells you how much we liked it.

While I really liked the taste, I had some problems with this meatloaf and all the leaking of meat juices.  Next time I will follow other reviews and put the glaze on top after it has cooked most of the way and I have had the opportunity to drain the meat juices off.

This meatloaf was AWESOME!  My husband said it is the best he has ever had!  I did make a few changes...I added two links of hot Italian sausage (for flavor), a bit more milk, some garlic, and mixed the saltine crackers with Italian style bread crumbs.  I also did as others suggested and split the brown sugar and ketchup on the top and bottom of the meatloaf.  Thanks for this recipe!  I will never make it any other way!

This meatloaf was really good.  My daughter said she could eat it every night of the week.  I made it according to suggestions although I did add about a tablespoon of barbeque to the ketchup mixture and decreased the brown sugar to 1/4 cup.  My husband called it "restaurant quality" meatloaf.

Wow! This was my first attempt ever at making meat loaf and it turned out fabulous! Note that we do prefer a sweeter meatloaf. I did include the ground ginger and also put 1 tsp. worcestershire sauce in with the meat mixture. Added 1/2 tsp. worcestershire sauce to the glaze. What a wonderful recipe. Thanks for posting it!

Can't go wrong with this recipe.  I've made this one a few times, as well as tried some others from this site (Rempel Family Meatloaf, Glazed Meatloaf I, The Best Meatloaf)...my bf and I agree that this one beats all the rest. I only made a few changes, I used less milk, and also put the glaze on top.

I liked it, but was a little too sweet for me. Next time I'll cut down the brown sugar. I didn't mind the "sauce" on the bottom.

This recipe was delicious! I took the suggestion to reduce the amount of milk & used seasoned bread crumbs instead of saltine crackers. I put the sauce on the top before baking and it turned out wonderful. My husband described this as the best recipe for meatloaf he ever tasted. Thanks!

I had to rate this a 5! I am not sure how I got a craving for something I don't like. So I took the advice of others and put the glaze on top and added celery in the meatloaf. I think the best idea is to shape your meatloaf and put it in a 13x9' pan, but I was able to drain some of the grease while it was cooking. This was so good!

This was excellent! Very tastey and the perfect amount of ingredients. The only change I'll make next time will be to put the brown sugar and ketchup on the top of the meatloaf. After scooping the meatloaf out, the mixture didn't seem to stick or absorb into it. I added bacon slices to the top also, which gave it a sweet taste.

So good! I followed the recipe as stated but omitted the onion and added in a package of onion soup mix like other reviewers. I noticed towards the end of the cooking time, the ketchup/brown sugar mix at the bottom had turned to juice. I didn't like that, so I poured out the juice, mixed up another k/bs mix and spread that across the top. This is definitely the way to go. My fiance hates ketchup and turned his nose up at it. I made him try it and he absolutely loved it. Thanks for the recipe. I will be eating this leftover for lunch today.

I made it with the glaze on top and without the ginger because I didn't have it on hand, and it still turned out great! It was quick and easy to make (stir together and put in pan) and the family loved it. It needed about an hour and a half in the oven for the glaze to caramelize, but it didn't seem to hurt the meatloaf, which stayed juicy.

Awesome, super tasty recipe !  I used a shallot instead of an onion and also added some Frank's Hot Sauce for a little kick.  Everything else, I kept that same.  It was moist and flavorful -- DH loved it :)

I made this last minute, as I thought the Heavenly Potatoes and Ham wouldn't be enough to satisfy him.

I took some of the other reviewer's advice and added an envelope of onion soup mix. I also added some garlic powder, worchestershire sauce and a tiny
bit of steak sauce. 

My husband loved it, but I thought it was too sweet.

Used 1lb ground turkey and 1lb ground pork.  Used 1/8cup brown sugar, few splashes of worchestire, and ketchup.  Used 1 packet of beefy onion soup mix.  It was a winner with my daughter and I.  My husband was on the fence (he prefers beef) but he ate all that was on his plate.  2 out of 3 isn't bad!  I loved it and will make again!

if you want to keep the grease from saturating your meat loaf, put 2 or 3 slices of bread in the bottom of the pan-this will soak up the grease--then you take it off the meatloaf as you serve it or when you put the meat loaf on a platter to serve--it really works great.

this is by far the best meatloaf i've ever made...a absolute keeper (and share dish!). i didn't follow the directions perfectly, making a few changes: i used half ground beef and half ground pork. i forgot the salt and onion (whoops!). i threw in extra ginger (about twice what it called for), and about a tablespoon of italian spice. it cooked in the same amount of time despite the fact that i used pork and the juices and flavors were absolutely overwhelming!

I have made meatloaf for alot of years.  This is the best.  I never thought of adding brown sugar, but it is great with it on top.  Only change I made was I added some mushrooms.  Thanks for a great recipe, it going in my recipe box.

This is a great recipe!  I followed the suggestions made by SLJ6 and they are right on.  Sort the reviews by most helpful and the review is at this time the second one to appear.

11/22/10 just use half pack of onion soup mix.  Full pack too much.

I'm not a big meatloaf fan but this recipe was wonderful. Definitely put the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom to avoid it getting mixed in with all the fat that comes up through the top even if you use extra lean ground beef which I did. I added red pepper flakes to add some kick, 1 clove crushed garlic, green bell peppers, splash of werstershire sauce, Ritz crackers (that’s all I had), and cut back on the milk to ½ cup. VERY YUMMY!

This meatloaf recipe was excellent. Like others, I put the brown sugar and ketchup/worcestershire sauce on top instead of on the bottom. It made a great flavor with the meat. I will make a lot more of the sauce next time. Otherwise, I usually put a can of stewed tomatoes on top during the last 15-20 minutes of cooking time to add a little more health to the meal. Thanks for the variety of meatloaf though. It's a great one!

Yum!  Listened to others and added the worcestershire sauce and the lipton onion soup mix.  Also mixed the ketshup, worst. and brown sugar and spread on top of meatloaf. Wonderful. All four kids loved it. I made double batch for left over sandwiches, well the down side of them loving it so much-- no leftovers! Will make again.

Excellent!  This is the only meatloaf I've actually LOVED.  I did use ground pork for one third of the meat, added Worcestershire to the glaze mix and put it on top instead of the bottom.  Absolutely love it!  In fact, I think I'll go have another piece right now....

This is the best meatloaf I ever made.It was very moist and have good flavor. I followed other reviews and cut down the sugar to 1/4 and mix it together with the ketchup.Put it on the bottom of the pan and left a little bit to put it on top. Anyway it was a little too sweet for our taste. Next time I'm going to use less sugar and add a little more salt to balance the flavors. But overall it was delicious.

I made a few modifications to this recipe.. the biggest one was probably using ground turkey instead of ground beef. I also added some Worcestershire sauce to the sauce AND to the meat mixture. It was amazing! So, so good! I have never even liked meatloaf before - I just made this for my boyfriend because it is one of his favorite foods. We both loved it. He said it could have used more vegetables in it - I'm not sure what that means, as this is the first meatloaf I have ever made (or enjoyed for that matter). I thought it was absolutely delicious, and I can't wait to make it again!

This was absolutely delicious. I've been trying to add to my kitchen knowledge with new recipes. I cam across this and decided to try although I had my own recipes...this has replaced my own! Reluctant at first because of sweetness but it was a great flavor. Very moist and tender. MAke extra brwon sugar sauce and put on top of meatloaf though. This is one of my all time favorites!

I really liked this recipe.  I used the onion soup mix instead of the onion as others did so my kids wouldn't 'see' the onions.  It was very moist.  Next time I will use more ketchup and less brown sugar for more of a tomato taste.  It was very easy to whip up too.  Thanks for another keeper Allrecipes!

Well.. being a complete moron in the kitchen. I forgot to add the egg and the milk! Still turned out GREAT! I used a whole (small) onion, put the brown sugar mixture on top (and some in the meat). Using the crackers was great. I crushed 1/2 cup and used 1/4 in the recipe and used the rest on the bottom of the pan after reading the reviews on sogginess. (Forgetting the milk solved that problem) Everyone enjoyed it.. even the picky eating princess!

I absolutely LOVE the ginger in this.  I also added green bell pepper to mine and let it sit covered in the refrigerator for a few hours to allow the flavors to all blend.  I don't care for the brown sugar ketchup mixture being on the bottom, however, hence the 4 stars.

As a college student, this is probably one of the greatest things to ever happen to me.  I say that with a small warning that I vastly changed this recipe, partly accidentally, but the idea was dead-on and it was SO GOOD.

First and foremost, I literally forgot the crackers...whoops.  I also used ground turkey instead of beef. Other than that, I used 1/3 cup buttermilk, 2 TBSP W. Sauce, 1 small raw onion, and 1 tsp of Nutmeg in the meat.  For the sauce, 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1/3 cup ketchup, and a few dashes of W. sauce.  The product was incredibly moist and juicy, the glaze was wonderful but not overpowering, the onions were well cooked, and everything together was awesome.  I will make this over and over again!!

This was really good.  The ginger added a nice "something" that most meatloaves just don't have.  I followed another reviewers idea and made the ketchup/brown sugar mix as a glaze.  Since we are diabetics, that allowed us to keep the sugar down.

Good base recipe. Too sweet to serve with mashed taters, but the family loved it. I wont use as much sugar next time and it should be fine. Thanks for an interesting change to a classic.

My family LOVES this recipe. We have made it hundreds of times. I usually add some grated zuchinni and carrot to get a few more veges into my picky children. it is also good with a little ground ginger in the mixture. Best served with a large pile of creamy mash and your fav greens. Enjoy.

I love meatloaf and thought my meatloaf in which I have been making the same way for years was the best.. I thought why mess with perfection. I was looking for something to do with ground beef when I came across this recipe. My husband and kids raved over it and I don't think I will be making my meatloaf for a long time. This recipe is now my favorite way of making it.. The only change I made was I use Splenda for my sugars. So I cut the called for sugar in half and use the Splenda brown sugar.. Thank you for sharing this recipe..

My husband claims this is the best meatloaf I have ever made. I did use gound turkey, added worchestire sauce to glaze and put glaze on top of meatloaf instead of the bottom. This is a great recipe! Thank you!

Made the meatloaf and did as others suggested:
-put the glaze over the top, not in the bottom of the pan
-only used 1/4 cup milk
-used onion soup mix instead of raw onion
-added a couple splashes Worcestershire sauce
-we are garlic people so I added a little garlic powder

My husband RAVED, it was moist delicious and not overyly sweet as I had feared, and so easy to put together.  It was even better the next day. 

Last night I decided to make hamburgers and used this recipe (without the glaze) and they were amazing!  held together really well on the grill, stayed very juicy, and the cracker crumbs made the grill marks kinda of crunchy, in a good way.  
It made about 6 burgers, grilled on each side for about 5 mins.

We like this meatloaf--even my toddler! It works much better to put the brown sugar and ketchup on bottom, though it seems like it should go on the top. But it's much tastier the way it's written.

I've made small adjustments: I use half ketchup/half barbecue sauce, a little less milk (or else it's too mushy), and bread crumbs instead of saltines. 

It works out very nicely. It's become a staple food in our home.

My husband never met a meatloaf he liked until this one. This is now my staple meatloaf recipe, each bite got better and better. I used corn flakes instead of saltines because that is what I had on hand but other than that followed the recipe exactly. I recommend leaving the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom as the recipe suggests. When the sauce mixed with the juice of the meat the flavors really permeated the entire meatloaf, plus the top got a nice crisp layer on it that was perfect for texture. Thumbs way up! Thanks!

It was really good. I was very skeptical because brown sugar is not something I would associate with meatloaf. It's easy to make and defenitly something different that's yummy. I followed the reviews and added less milk, added worchestshire sauce and put glaze on top and bottom. I will make this again

Yum I love this recipe! I've made it about 4 or 5 times now. I use less brown sugar because it is too sweet with the amount called for. I also have always used bread crumbs instead of saltine crackers, because I usually don't buy those. I put ketchup on bottom and top, on top about 1/2 way through, and put it on broil for a few min. if it needs to be glazed more! Thanks for the recipe!

Very good, moist meatloaf.  I reduced the brown sugar by half and added some worcestshire and garlic.  I used bread crumbs instead of saltines.  I put a small amount of the glaze at the bottom of the pan and spooned the rest on top.  Next time, I will reduce the milk to 1/2 cup, as it was a little too much, and also cook the meatloaf in a casserole instead of a loaf pan to better drain the grease.  Yum!

I am long overdue to review this recipe, as my family (especially husband) absolutely adore it!  They will accept no other meatloaf at this point.  The only change I make is I puree a 1/4 cup onion and a 1/4 c. bell pepper for a little more nutrition and taste.

Add me to the chorus of believers - this rocked! I made it in a mini loaf pan and got 4 small loaves. My only sub was using almond milk instead of dairy and oops, I didn't measure the ginger and probably used twice what was called for. A winner .... so much so that the pickiest of child eaters asked for seconds and thirds.

This is the FIRST meatloaf that I have gotten my 3 year old to eat...Not to mention that I loved it too! The only thing that I did different was to mix the ketchup and brown sugar together and glazed the top of the meatloaf instead of the bottom. Great recipe!

This is great! Love the flavor the ginger adds. I made a few changes as previously suggested; I mixed the brown sugar, ketchup and a little bit of worcestershire sauce and used it as a glaze on top of the loaf. Also added a little bit of worcestershire sauce to the meatloaf, and used a meatloaf mix instead of ground beef. Very delicious!

This was sooooo GREAT!  I invited my parents over for dinner and they loved it also.  It is a favorite in our house.  
I took reviewers' suggestions and used 1/2 cup of milk, and added garlic and 1 tblsp worcestershire to the beef. I used about 1/4+ cup of brown sugar, the catsup, and a TBSP of worcestershire to the glaze.

This was very very good. I stuck to the spirit of the recipe, but did add extra "Stuff". I had small portion of ground turkey breast, lean ground pork and lean ground beef to use up so I used that mixture instead of all beef. I cut back a little on the milk and instead of crushed crackers I used crushed pretzels. I sauted the onions a bit first, added minced garlic, a shot of worchestshire sauce, some dry mustard and lots of chopped fresh spinach. I topped this with a mixture of ketchup, brown sugar Splenda and a dash of tabasco. I baked this for an hour in a loaf pan. Just wonderful.. cold or hot!

This meatloaf was great!  It was so moist but without being greasy.  The sweet taste of the brown sugar was perfect.  It wasn't too much as I think it would have been if it had been mixed into the meatloaf.  The brown sugar and ketchup ended up being like a glaze.  My kids even loved this.  My twenty-month old, who is very picky, loved it.

I used one pound of ground beef and a half pound of pork sausage.  I also added a tsp of Worcestershire's sauce as some others recommended.

I have been using this recipes for a couple years now. I love it. Everyone always asks for the recipe. I add a amidge of worcestshire sauce to both the sauce and meatloaf. I only use a 1/2 cup of milk and I put the sauce on top, but i have tried it your way and its good too! I do want to tell everyone it is much much better with lean ground beef. I am cheap so I dont always but the lean but it is so much better with it.

Made this recipe for the first time last night and will be having leftovers tonight.  My husband and I both enjoyed it.  I used 93% lean ground beef and also put the sauce over the top of the meatloaf.  I was afraid the sauce would dry out on top of the meatloaf, but it stayed moist.  Glad I put a drip pan under the loaf pan, because the sauce did run over the side of the loaf pan and would have been a mess to clean up had it fell on the oven floor.  Overall, a good recipe.  Would make this again.

I've made this several times now and by far it's the best meatloaf I've come across! The only change I made was baking it longer than one hour. The meat was still quite pink in the middle after an hour.

Well just like everybody else, I made some changes.  I'm certain they enhanced this recipe!  I made sure to pre-soak the milk and saltine crackers.  I chopped the onion very fine, beat the eggs, and mixed everything together rather than making the layers.  Most importantly, I substituted an acidic, vinegar-containing bbq sauce (Prosser's brand) for ketchup.  It tasted spectacular!  Also I would recommend using nonfat milk and very lean beef, otherwise this is one fatty meal!

I always make this. It is amazing. Of course, over time I have altered the amounts of the ingredients, and then I began just putting as much as I felt like, but either way - really really really yummy. No reason to make any other way. Good with just beef or with beef/pork mix. Also, even if you don't have the ginger it still comes out great. Extra sauce is helpful cause then it is extra yummy, but I noticed that when I do that the kids tend to want more sauce and I feel its too much sugar for dinner.
Try this recipe out! It's very good.

I wanted to give this 4.5 stars really.  I give it 4 stars for the actual meal part and I give it 5 stars for leftovers. Best meatloaf sandwich I have eaten in a long time!  Only additions were I added 1 tbsp dry mustard powder and 3 drops of worcester sauce.

I thought this was very tasty, and loved the aroma in my kitchen while it was cooking. I took the advice of others and cut back on the brown sugar using only 1/4 cup. I, too,also added worcestershire sauce as recommended and put the Brown sugar and ketchup glaze on top of the loaf. I substituted the saltines with herb and garlic breadcrumbs. Yummy!

My family loved this meatloaf. The only changes I made was I didn't have any ground beef, so I substituted ground venison and I didn't have any saltine crackers so I substituted club house crackers. It turned out perfect. This is our new favorite.

This recipe tastes really good, even better the second day.  I followed a couple reviewers' tips and added 1 T worcestershire to the mix and a few splashes to the ketchup, minced up three gloves of garlic, and used 1/4c of brown sugar.  I put the brown sugar and ketchup on top and used 93/7 lean ground beef and it turned out great!

A good "comfort food" type recipe. The sweetness added by the brown sugar is a nice change. Everyone loved it. I've made it several times this winter.

WOW! So stinkin' good! My husband really enjoyed this dish. I substituted garlic for the ginger, and as per other reviews put the brown sugar on top. It was wonderful! Will definitely make again.

OK, I'm not a huge meatloaf fan but I must say that this is by far the best meatloaf I've made.  I tried a barbecue meatloaf recipe from this site but the kids didn't really care for it.  This was really easy to make.  I will definitely make it again.

This meatloaf was actually very good.  I just don't get putting the sauce in the bottom of the pan.  Also, the Sauce is WAY TOO SWEET.  I made it a second time, decreasing the brown sugar to 1/4 cup and keeping the ketchup to 1/2...and I put it on top...I was the Best Meatloaf I've ever made.

This was delicious. I would recommend using regular ground beef instead of lean. The lean meat made it taste a little dry.

This is the ~BEST~ meatloaf I have ever ate in my entire life. My whole family agrees. After making it for my fiance I decided to see how my family would like it, and they loved it. I even have some in the oven right now for our church dinner this evening! Try it, You'll Love It! You won't be disappointed...   =]

My family enjoyed this meatloaf. The brown sugar gave it a sweet taste that was not overpowering. The sugar and ketchup melted and was really good spooned back over the meatloaf.

I had a little over 2 lbs of ground round tha thad to be used - I made this recipe and it was great! (scaled to 12 servings) Hubby loved it!I did add garlic powder and used Mortons Nature seasonings for the salt. This is now a family favorite and most requested by co-working when we have a pot luck. Thank you for the recipe

Liked the meatloaf, hated the glaze.  I guess I like more of a tomato taste with my meatloaf, rather than pure sugar.  I'll try the meatloaf again - I added garlic and liked the crackers - not usually what I make it with, but it was a nice change other than the syrup on top.

Delicious and I don't even like meatloaf. I really wanted to try this recipe though after reading the reviews. My husband and I actually got in an argument, because he didn't want me to make it, but he loved it! Kept everything the same, but put the brown sugar and ketchup mixture on the top and bottom. Yummy!

Very good! I loved how compact the texture was. My usual recipe ends up very crumbly. Next time, I don't think I'll use as much brown sugar in the top (and I did use it on the top rather than the bottom) as it was too sweet. But, overall, a great recipe. Family liked it!

I'm not a huge meatloaf fan (I find it so bland!), but I decided to give this recipe a try. After reading several other reviews, I added some MAJOR changes. I did cut the amount of brown sugar to 1/4 c. (I cut the ketchup to 1/4 c. as well). I only used 1/2 c. of milk, and I substituted bread crumbs for the crushed crackers. My biggest fear was that this was going to turn out either super bland or super sugary/ketchupy, so I threw in a tbsp. of Cajun seasoning, 1 tsp. of Worcestershire sauce, a handful of fresh cilantro (the way I see it, you can NEVER have too much cilantro!) I also added half a green bell pepper. As other reviewers suggested, I glazed the top with 2 tbsp. brown sugar and 2 tbsp. ketchup about halfway through the cooking process. The end result was ok. The consistency was great, but it was still too bland for my taste. I'm sure I'll be making this again, but in the future I will use more cajun seasoning, and maybe a bit more ketchup to glaze the top as it cooks. Overall, it was ok for a quick, home-cooked dish.

OMG this was awesome! I made a few alterations based on reviews... brown sugar spinkled on top, then the ketchup on top of that. I accidentally omitted the milk but it was still delicious and juicy. Instead of saltines I used Ritz and wow it was sooo much better than using bread crumbs! This will be replacing my old meatloaf recipe.

GREAT!  I am officially a meatloaf hero and this was my first time making one. My mom was the master. After Reading other reviews I reduced the brown suger to 1/4 cup.  I also added an additional mixture of 2 TBSP each of brown sugar and ketchup and put on the top of meatloaf the last 30 minutes of baking,  and increased the baking time to an hour and 45 minutes. It was perfect! There was total silence around my table while my family dove in again and again.  Luckily I doubled the recipe for leftovers.

My family has been complaining about my regular meatloaf lately, so I decided to try something different.  This was delicious!  Everyone loved it!  It was very sweet, so I may try to reduce the brown sugar just a little bit next time and see how it goes.  Thanks!

I made this a couple weeks ago and it came out pretty good. Not the usual meatloaf. The only thing I did differently is that I baked the meatloaf without any sauce on the top or bottom.  Then, with about 15 mins of cook time left, I put the sauce on top of the loaf and finished baking it.  Came out fantastic.

Good flavor but a little too wet.  Could probably get by with less sauce and I think the sauce would be better on the top, not the bottom

Great recipe!  I also used 1/4 cup of sugar, 1/2 cup of milk, added some worchesterchire sauce to the beef along with some parsley and oregano.  Also substitued panko breadcrumbs instead of the crushed crackers.  Really delicious, made the kitchen smell so good.

This is the best meatloaf I have ever made.  My husband enjoyed it as much as I did.  I took other reviews advice and only used 1/2 c milk bcause I thought any more than that and the meatloaf would be to soggy and not hold together. I also did add about 3 shakes of worcestershire sauce and only 1/4 c brown sugar to the ketchup mix and I put the ketchup sauce on top of the meatloaf.  I think the slighly sweet topping and the ginger added to the meat is what made this recipe worth 5 stars.  I will be making this one again.  Thank you so much for submitting it.

The meatloaf itself was good. I tried the ketsup and brown suger on the bottom. It didn't work for me , it was a gooy mess. I'll try it on top next time.

This is the BEST meatloaf I've ever made!  My husband couldn't get enough and couldn't wait to eat more for lunch the next day.  He confirmed it's the best meatloaf he's ever had.  The brown sugar and ketchup combine to make a really tasty glaze and seems to flavor the meat well.  You need to bake this in a LOAF PAN.  Do not try to make it on a cookie sheet or jelly roll pan.  When it comes time to take it out of the loaf pan, place the serving plate, inverted, on top of the loaf pan and then hold the two tightly together as you flip it.  Be prepared to spill some juices in the process but it's not as messy as some have made it sound.  The key is to flip quickly.  I used less brown sugar (about half the amount called for), only 1 egg and only 1/2 cup of milk. I added about 1/4 cup of BBQ sauce to the hamburger meat. My husband said he DEFINITELY wants this to become a regular!

by far the easiest meatloaf i have ever made! i only had 1 pound of beef, so i scaled the milk, eggs and crackers down a bit and it still tasted excellent. I followed the tips of other users and put the brown sugar/ketchup/worcestershire sauce both on the bottom of the pan AND on the top as a glaze. Flavor was excellent!

My husband did not like my meatloaf and so I was in search  for a better recipe and wow was this the best one I have ever had. My mini-me (15 year old daughter) loved it, we love cooking together. Thank you very much for another great one

YUMMY!  I made five mini meatloaves and put them on top of the ketchup/brown sugar mixture in a 13x9 inch baking dish.  Cooked 350 for 45 minutes.
The last 10 minutes of baking I added more ketchup/sugar to the tops.  LOVED IT!  I was scooping the glaze off the bottom of the dish every bite.
Instead of saltines..I used mostly oatmeal and crushed up some butter crackers as well.  Also added in shredded carrot.  That's all the small changed I did.  Will keep this recipe for future use.  THANKS!

This was great! I did change some things though. First I didn't cook it in a loaf pan I cooked it in a 13x9 pan because I don't like it to sit in the grease. I put the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom of the pan, made the meat loft and shaped like a loaf and placed on top of the sugar/ketchup. I then mixed up some more brown sugar/ketchup and glazed the top of the loaf with about 20 mins left to cook. I love the ketchup part of meatloaf so it was great to have it on the top and bottom. My hubby and kids couldn't get enough!

This recipe overall was okay, I followed the recipe exact. The ginger didn't really please my husband he says it was overpowering but the loaf came out really moist. It also lacked to leave me satisfed with that comfort food feelng.

Our family LOVED this recipe.  My husband who is just as picky as my kids said it was awesome and that I needed to make it again.  I doubled it and put it in a 9x13 pan.  I also put the brown sugar and ketchup on top.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

A little too sweet...almost like candy.  It really needs to be sweet AND savory...maybe cut back on the brown sugar and add Heinze steak sauce and/or worchestishire sauce.

This is my only meatloaf recipe now, I've made this so many times I've lost count. I do add fresh parsley to meat mixture and use more ketchup/brown sugar than called for...we like lots of sauce, oh I leave out ginger, not a fan of it.

My husband loves meatloaf almost any way it is fixed. This is one of his favorites. It is somewhat on the "sweet" side, but you should expect that. We really love it and make it often now that the kids are gone.

I've been making this for a few years, and thought I'd comment.  I mix it all in a ziplock bag, and cut an end to pipe it into a disposable metal bread pan.  I usually drain some of the fat off while it cooks.  It usually takes about an hour & half for me in my oven.  I also put the topping on the top.  I serve it with mashed potatoes, it's one of my husbands favorites.

This was good butm, a little too sweet for me even when I cut the brown sugar.  I much prefer the Rempel Family Meatloaf on this site.   Very easy, though.

This meatloaf is amazing. Meatloaf is our favorite comfort food, and I have been making good meatloaf for years. The saltines along with the milk and egg produces a texture that is so wonderful!   This is THE recipe for meatloaf for us now. The catsup and brown sugar melt into a gooey yummy glaze. My family of 3 finished off a whole meatloaf at one sitting; my 6 year old had 3 slices! Simple and perfect recipe for the ultimate "American" style meatloaf.

This recipe was excellent!  I made the recipe as given, added some minced garlic into the meat.  I did put the sauce on top of the meatloaf and it turned out well.  Will be making this one again, thanks!

I was not a big meatloaf fan when I came across this recipe, but wanted to try something different and decided to give this a try. It was wonderful! My husband (who is a self proclaimed meatloaf hater) LOVED this meatloaf so much I had to cook a double batch the next day so he could have it again then take the leftovers to work. 
I did change a couple things because I didn't want to have to run to the store. I did not using any ginger and I used cheez-its instead of saltines. It was perfect just like that and I will do it that way everytime! We poured some of the leftover "sauce" from the bottom on top of ours and liked that little bit of sweet it added.

Made with ground turkey. very moist but there wasn't much flavor. it's very easy to make which is a plus, but "kim's ultimate meat loaf" on this site is much better.

This was terrific, my first meatloaf, I did use oatmeal instead of the crackers, the onion soup mix intead of the onion and I added 1 Tbl. worchister sauce. Oh, and I too, put the topping on top, not on the bottom.

I used to hate meatloaf until I tried this one.  Only used one egg, used reduced fat Ritz crackers instead of saltines (1 package).  Mixed the brown sugar, ketchup and added worcestershire to make a glaze for the top of the meatloaf.  Put the brown sugar at the bottom of the pan with ketchup on top.  Wouldn't recommend that...it burned on the bottom of the pan and I had to throw it away!  Meatloaf was still great.

I've been making a variation of this meatloaf for years. Everyone who tries it (even self-proclaimed meatloaf haters) LOVES it! I get constant requests to make this over & over. I use the leanest ground sirloin I can find. Instead of saltine crackers, I use Italian bread crumbs. I add about a tbsp of worcestershire & a tsp of minced garlic. I only use 1/4-1/2c of milk. After I shape into a rounded-top loaf in the pan, I sprinkle a light layer of brown sugar & do a squiggly of ketchup over the top. I bake for 45-50 minutes at 375.

In response to KIMAR's review regarding the brown sugar being in the bottom of the pan - not only does this provide flavor, but it prevents the meatloaf from getting dry. This meatloaf should come out very juicy & tender because of the brown sugar juices in the bottom of the pan.

Because everyone knows you have to drain the grease off of the meatloaf, I chose to put the brown sugar and ketchup mixture on top which proved to be a wise choice. But I waited to put it on after the meatloaf was done cooking and then popped it back into the oven after I'd turned it off already. There was still enough heat in the oven to make the glaze warm and gooey good. This was the BEST meatloaf I have ever put in my mouth, I did add green peppers to it which made the flavor POP!! The whole family raved over this meatloaf saying ti was by far teh best they had ever eaten and I agreed. It was super moist and flavorful, could not have been better. THIS IS THE BEST .... you HAVE to try this!

This was a great meatloaf.  I love the brownsugar glaze.  I put it on the top but next time I'm giong to try the glaze on top and bottom per husband's request. I used seasoned bread crumbs (bc that's what I had).  With garlic mash potatoes from this site, and corn..it was a fantastic meal!

This was an excellent meatloaf.  I put the ketchup mixture on the top, but I can see why you would need to put it on the bottom because it bubbles out over the top.  I guess you could make it in a pan so that doesn't happen.  My husband said it was the best meal he has ever had.  That's saying a lot, as he has confessed to not liking meatloaf!

I love this one. My daughter raved about it, and she NEVER comments about anything. I was truly shocked at her reaction. I did adjust a little. I substituted the saltines for a mixture of oatmeal/cheerios/crackers, in a zip lock bag,rolled into crumbs using a glass spice jar.. less salt, and the oatmeal always seems to help the meat be moist in a meatloaf. I also added about 1-2 T. brn. sugar to the meat mixture. Unlike some other cooks, I did use the full amount of milk. I used the full amount of sugar on the bottom of the pan, but only squirted catsup over the sugar till it was enough to spread over it completely. Most likely about 1/2 C. The sugar caused more juice than the meat would have produced on it's own, so about 3/4 through cooking I scooped some of the juice out of the pan. This was a fantastic meatloaf! I did spoon some of the juice from the pan onto the top, which was nice to have the sugar/catsup mixture on top AND bottom. I made a double batch, using a baking pan rather than a loaf pan, and when I took it out to spoon off juice, I cut it in half to allow the middle to cook well. Just myself and my daughter, who eats like a bird normally, and once for my granddaughter, and in 3 days, the entire double batch is GONE! I'll definitely be making this one again soon. Thanks for posting this one.

I made this a vegetarian meatloaf and used burger crumbles instead of meat. I thought it was OK. I couldn't eat a while lot of it but I have never had meat loaf before so I can't say if it was the recipe or if meatloaf is just not for me. I gave it 4 starts because my fiance LOVED it. He said it wasn't as good as his grandmother's but a close second.

I made this the other night and it was good.  I think my mess up was using 80/20 ground beef.  It was VERY greasy.  I also put the ketchup/brown sugar on top of the loaf. I added 1 1/2 tbs. of worstershire which gave it a little kick. Will def. be a keeper.

This was very different then any other meatloaf I have ever had.  I didnt like it at all.  But it could just be that I like savory meatloaves and not sweet meatloaves.

A wonderful recipe. To adjust for our own personal tastes, I did add a little bit of green pepper and celery, diced small. I also reduced the brown sugar to 1/4 cup, mixed it with and equal amount of ketsup and spread it on the top of the meatloaf. It made a wondeful glaze. I was sure that I would prefer to have the glaze on top rather on the bottom of the pan, floating around in all that grease.  I also reduced the milk to 1/2 cup as it seemed to be too wet. Yum! Thank You tangastar!

Best meatloaf I've ever made, one of the best I've ever had. I only sprinkled a little brown sugar and a little ketchup on the bottom. 1/2 cup of each seemed too much to me. Next time I'll put a little more than I did this time.

This was not one of my favorite meatloaf recipes that I have tried.  Hubby liked it, so I will probably make it again sometime.  I did forget to put the milk in, but I wouldn't think that would make a huge difference, but I will try it again.  I also cut back on the brown sugar.

I loved this recipe.  I usually use my own meatloaf recipe but this was good too.  I used cheese flavored breadcrumbs instead of crackers and added the following: a tsp garlic powder, about a Tbsp of Italian seasoning, a Tbsp of crushed red pepper, a little more black pepper, and Worcestershire sauce in ketchup sauce and in meatloaf.  Also, I put the Ketchup sauce on top as recommened by other members.  So, yummy with mashed potatoes on the side.

I tried this recipe tonight. My husband really likes meatloaf, but it's not my favorite dish. WOW!! This was seriously the best meatloaf I have ever had. I've tried so many different recipes and most were ok, but this one really stood out. My husband raved and said now I have to make it every week, lol!
I took some of the others advice and made some changes using only half the brown sugar. I put half on the bottom and half on top. I used a half packet of onion soup mix and added a little Worcestershire sauce. Also used regular bread crumbs as I had no crackers on hand.
Don't hesitate to try this recipe. I will make this again and again.

This recipe is wonderful!  I made it exactly as the recipes calls but I doubled it because I was going to have a large group.  It was fabulous!  By the time I filled my plate, there was only one piece left for me, and I'm sure it would have been gone if I had been any slower going through line.  My kids and my husband have talked about it all day.  I will definatly be adding this to my favorites file.

My husband and I love this recipe.  It is so easy and so good.  I actually bake it in a 9x13 pan, still shaped like a loaf, but it keeps the grease out of the meatloaf. It is still juicy and tastes wonderful and much less fattening!  I also put the ketchup mix on top.

First time ever making meat loaf. I forgot the bread/cracker crumbs so mine fell apart a bit.  It also came out a little on the sweet side for meat loaf I think.  All in all, a great dish!

This recipe was easy to make, and was a hit with my husband. I changed the recipe a bit where I cut the amount of ketchup in half, and substituted the rest with BBQ sause. In addition, when the meatload was complete, I drained the gravy and sauted it with mushrooms. It was a great hit, and will definately make again!

This is the best meatloaf I've ever had!!! I use a package of onion soup mix instead of onions, and I also put the ketchup mixture on the top & bottom of the meatloaf. We have this once a week!! IT'S THAT GOOD!!!!!

I also put the sauce on top of the meatloaf, which worked out well. I used breadcrumbs, like someone suggested and reduced the sugar. My husband and daughter enjoyed it. Be sure to mix well! I got bites of salts when I ate it. I think I'll omit the salt next time.

Try it with BBQ!

This recipe is so great- and simple! When I went to make it I found I forgot to get Ketchup, so I substituted BBQ sauce - delectable!

Ok, this was my first attempt at making meatloaf.  I think it turned out pretty good (my husband loved it), but next time, like many other reviewers mentioned, I will definitely back off the sugar.  I like to try recipes as is for the first time, and adjust from there.  I will also, most definitely, season the beef itself much more.  I felt it needed quite a bit more pizzaz.  Overall, a good recipe, but now I know what I'll do to make it more to my liking.

This is an awesome meatloaf.  I use 1/4 cup brown sugar and ketchup and mix it in with the other ingredients, then I sprinkle brown sugar on top and add ketchup to that.  My mom who is a meatloaf fanatic loved this.

Absolutely 5 stars!! BEST meatloaf I have ever had- and my hubby loved it (and he cringes at meatloaf!)  I followed the recipe, except used breadcrumbs instead of saltines, added a tad more ginger and only used 1/2 cup milk.... Also, following other reviews, I added Worcestershire to the topping and put mixture on the top. FANTASTIC!!

This recipe was good. My hubby liked it which is pretty much amazing unto itself.I cut down on the milk to 1/2 c. and added grated carrots, and Worcestershire sauce. Also put glaze on top instead of the bottom after 45 min of cooking and then cooked another 30 with the glaze. Excellent though.

Best meatloaf ever!  I think I enjoyed it so much because it was noticeably different from any other meatloaf I've ever tasted.  I ate a whole loaf on my own (to test it out before serving it to others)!  Thanks a lot!

This meatloaf was excellent!  I did make just a few changes.  Instead of the cracker crumbs I jused dried seasoned breadcrumbs.  I also followed another contributor's advice and made mini meat loaves on a jelly roll pan lined with foil.  This made clean up a lot easier.  I added a couple of dashes of worcerstershire to the topping and spooned it on during the last 5 minutes of baking.  The smaller loaves cut the cooking time by almost half.  My husband loved it and so did I!  Thanks!

I was skeptical about the crackers.. I thought, why? Why shouldnt I just use italian seasoned bread crumbs instead.. I am SO glad I used the crackers, the loaf came out fantastic!! The only thing I changed was I did not add milk. It makes me ill. But everything else I did as directed and we had a beautiful meal. Thank you.

This recipe is off the charts! I did take others advice and simply mixed the brown sugar and ketchup together and applied it to the TOP of the loaf. We now eat this at least once a week.

I used 1/2 cup milk and 1/3 cup brown sugar. After reading other ratings I also mixed my brown sugar and ketchup with 1 TBSP of worcestershire and placed a small amt on bottom and the remaining on top. Very tasty and simple. Would definetly make again.

I make this all the time, especially when family comes over. Some things I change though are I double the amount of crackers, and I half the amount of brown sugar. Also, it helps to divide the meatloaf into two loaf pans to cook more evenly and quicker. The cooking time will need to be around 1 hour and 15 min or the middle is still pink even when separating the meatloaf into two loaf pans.

This turned out really moist with a lot of good flavor.  We thought it was a little too sweet, so will use half the brown sugar next time.  It was also a little too moist, so will use less milk next time.  We liked that the sauce was on the bottom.  It stayed saucy so you could spoon it over the meatloaf instead of it being dried on the top of the meat.

It was a little watery the first time I made it, but I added more cracker crumbs the second attempt. I also added a layer of brown sugar/ketchup in the middle of the meat. It was very good the second time around. Will definitely keep this one!

This is definately a keeper! I added the sugar to the top also, but it only gets 4 stars because it was REALLY watery when it was done. Not sure why as this has never happened before with my regular meatloaf. But will make again.

My husband LOVED this recipe.
I used onion soup mix, half&half, a dash of worcestershire and garlic powder. I prepared the meatloaf as stated... brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom. Oh yeah... I added some dry mustard to the glaze. I will try it again with the brown sugar on top, just because of the reviews. He gave this a 5... but if I'm going to make a sweet meatloaf, I prefer the Amish recipe. Hence the 4 star rating. Thank you, Starbuck!

I make this a lot, and the brown suger/ketchup mix is the key.  I sometimes use oatmeal as filler instead of crackers and I always add a few dashes of worstechire (sp) sauce.

Great Recipe.  I used ground turkey instead and breadcrumbs (didn't have any saltines).  I actually like the sugar/ketchup sauce just at the bottom.  If you like it sweeter you can pour some sauce over and if not it gives just the right hint of sweetness.

To make this a bit healthier, I used 1/2 cup egg substitute for the eggs and Quaker oatmeal instead of the crackers. I followed previous reviewers advice and cut the brown sugar in half and added 1 tbs. Worcestershire sauce to the ketchup mixture.  I put half on the bottom and the rest on top.  The meatloaf itself tasted great, but both my hubby and I thought the glaze was still too sweet.  (Next time I'll cut the brown sugar to just 1/8 cup.) Thanks for a good recipe!

I took the suggestions of adding less milk and putting half of the sauce on the bottom and half on top.  This is a great meatloaf, all my "kiddos" ate it and some asked for seconds.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I've never made meatloaf before (and have never been called a good cook), but my father-in-law is a "meat and potato" kind of guy and gave his seal of approval... except it was too sweet. Next time I'm cutting the brown sugar by half, to 1/4 cup (and on the top, 'cause it just sticks to the bottom of the dish, otherwise). I also took other reviewers' advice and added the worcestershire and garlic. For meatloaf, it had a nice flavor and consistency. Thanks for the recipe and reviews!

Excellent!  I put half the brown sugar & ketchup on the bottom of the pan, the other half on top of the meatloaf as suggested by others.  Needed to cook a little over an hour.

My husband is a huge meatloaf fan and he loved this recipe. It was a little too sweet for my daughter and me, next time I will use less sugar. Overall we liked how moist and flavorful it was, and I will be making it often!

This meatloaf is great! I made a few changes, put in onion soup instead of an onion, only 2 eggs, and 1 cup of crushed crackers. I didn't like the idea of putting the sauce in the bottom of the pan, but figured there must be a reason for it, so i put half on the bottom, and the rest on the top. I did find the sauce a tad too sweet, so next time i'll cut down on the brown sugar. All in all, this is a great meat loaf!

This recipe is awesome.  All three of my children, under the age of 7, love this meatloaf.  I only change two things on a regular basis which is I use the beef, veal & pork ground meat and I add more ketchup to the top before cooking.  At times I have cooked and mashed veggies, such a cauliflower, broccoli, or carrots, then add them to the mix again before cooking and the kids are none the wiser and they gobble it up.  I don't have leftovers when I make this recipe much to my husband dismay :)

Meatloaf has been a staple at dinnertime my whole life, and it still is now that I am the one that prepares meals.  This is the first time in memory that no one has put ketchup on their serving!  This was delicious!

I used Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce with this and it was AMAZING! I also could not find the pinneapple preserves but used apricot and did not add the brown sugar. I think that would have been a little too sweet with my BBQ sauce brand. I loved it and will make it over and over again!

If you want classic meatloaf, make this.  I did use 1/2 pound ground pork and 1 pound lean ground beef, which probably helped make it more moist and less healthy :-p  Otherwise followed recipe to a T and it was delish.  In future, I might use a bit less ketchup.  It would be easy to substitute part of the ketchup with BBQ sauce or hot sweet sauce for a different flavour, or to add some cajun spices or chili powder to the meat mix if you want zip.  Serve with standards like mashed potatoes, rice and a simple veggie...great winter meal.

Great meatloaf! I followed the recipe except I used 3 egg whites and one yolk, no ginger, and used 1% milk to help cut down on the fat and cholesterol.  It turned out great and  absolutely no extra sauce is needed! Thanks for the recipe!

After reading the reviews, I combined the ketchup & brown sugar & put half on the bottom/half on top. I had crushed Ritz crackers left from another recipe so I used those & a little garlic powder. The meatloaf itself turned out super-moist & flavorful. The sauce I could do without. It was just too sweet for our tastes. Duh! I don't know what I was thinking it is a brown sugar meatloaf. I will probably make this again, but skip the sauce. If you like a little sweet with your savory go for it.

DELICIOUS! Only changes I made were to put the ketchup/brown sugar on top (with some Worcestershire sauce ) and also some Worcestershire sauce  added to the meat mixture.  Great with a side of homemade mashed potatoes!

Haven't made meatloaf in forever since it was never anything to write home about (sorry mom!).  So glad I decided to try this recipe.  It's delicious!  The ginger is the "secret" ingredient.

I really enjoy this recipe and used to make it often. Instead of packing the sugar, ketchup and meat into a loaf pan, I form the meat into a loaf shape and place it in the bottom of a glass baking dish.  Then I mix the brown sugar and ketchup together and pour the glaze on top of the meatloaf.  Make extra glaze and serve for dipping. Unfortunately, my kids are now at a stage where they won't touch such a thing and hubby is watching his weight.  As soon as this passes, I'll be making this yummy meatloaf again!

I had never eaten meatloaf before let alone made it. My husband is a meatloaf lover, so I wanted to find a good recipe to make for him. He loved it!!! He loved that it wasn't even remotely dry like meatloafs have a bad rap for. The brown sugar gives it a unique flavor. I definitely recommend this recipe.

I was a little nervous about making this meat loaf. It turned out great! my daughter does not like meatloaf but ate all of her serving! i couldnt believe it! We do not like ginger so i left it out and used the regular pack of meatloaf seasoning and the brown sugar and ketchup. loved it!

This is a winner! I do add a tablespoon of curry powder to the meat mixture for an added flavor and also I put a layer of cheddar cheese in the middle of the loaf. I've made this many times with rave reviews.

Substituting molasses and granulated sugar for brown sugar will give this meatloaf a nice, mild caramel flavor.

My daughter and I have never been a big fan of meatloaf, I rarely make it for dinner.  This meatloaf has changed that, it is the best I've ever had.  It is now in our regular rotation of meals. I only made one minor change to the recipe, increasing the brown sugar and ketchup to 3/4 cup each.
 Thanks for the great recipe!

WOW, this has got to be one of the best recipes I've found on this site.  I made it pretty much as instructed except that I used breadcrumbs and found I didn't need to add any milk.  Wasn't sure about the ginger and had to resist the urge to add more spices to the loaf.  Added a little kethup to the top and cooked at 375 for 70 minutes.  I have to add that while it was cooking my 9 year old son whined "I'd rather starve than eat meatloaf"  Anyhow, when all was said and done, a very flavourful glaze was left on the meatloaf and the ginger was a perfect compliment.  My son went on to eat all of his portion, said it was yummy and that the sauce was really good!!  My 4 year old also had seconds...and I had thirds!!!  Some may find it too sweet but we have sweet tooths and really loved it.

This recipe is fantastic!  The first time that I made it, I did the exact recipe.  The next time I added green peppers to the recipe which only added to the flavor!  I will not make meatloaf any other way from now on! Thanks for a fantastic recipe!!!!!!!!

This was a great recipe.  My husband and son kept coming back for seconds and thirds and so did I. I added a little customization like chopping some fresh garlic, adding a little ketchup and worcesteshire sauce and onion soup mix in the meat mixture.    I also used Townhouse butter crackers in lieu of bread crumbs. I took the advice of others and mixed the ketchup and brown sugar and added it on top.  The end result was a very moist meatloaf and tasty topping.  It was easy, quick and tasty.  Great recipe!!!

Overall, it was good.    A few things i would change though.  I felt there were too many onions or they needed to be chopped finer.  Also, i used less brown sugar and it turned out to be great.

This turned out great.  The seasoning inside wasn't exciting...adding something might be nice next time...but overall, this meatloaf was very much so enjoyed.  Adding the brown sugar/ketchup on top was great.  Also, this needed to be cooked for about 1 hour and 20 minutes.  Cooking this in a loaf pan is best...an hour into it, drain out the liquid and put it back in to cook.  The liquid makes a wonderful gravy if you mix it with cornstarch/flour and a little water over heat and mix for awhile.

Since my kids were little they have always teased me about making lousy meatloaf...and I tried many...tonight I tried this recipe, putting sauce on top and adding little garlic powder...My daughter had dinner at my home and liked it and brought some to my son...he called me to let me know how good it was and why I didn't send more...this is a real keeper!  My 13 yr. old granddaughter said she doesn't like meatloaf, but this she ate!  Thanks Starbuck!

Let me start by saying it was moist and had a great flavor. It might just be my opinion but I found it to be too sweet. I will cut the brown sugar in half next time I make it.

Yum-my! Made a few changes...used only 1 egg, italian bread crumbs, worcestershire in beef,veal,pork mixture.  Mixed the ketchup & sugar together w/about 5 dashes of tabasco and spread it on top.  Nothing on bottom.  Cooked at 375 for one hour.  Perfect! I swear the sweetness permeated throughout the meat ever so subtly!  Thank you!!

I tried the recipe, followed the advice of other readers and put half the sauce on the bottom, other half on top.  Changed nothing else and it was very good.  I have to say, I almost didn't make it as the picture posted to the recipe looks quite unnappetizing and looks nothing like meatloaf!  I went with it because of the number of reviewers.

The best meatloaf recipe ever! I changed the servings to 16 and make it in a 2.75 qt pyrex dish that goes from the oven right to the fridge for leftovers that you will want to enjoy!

It was really good, it would have been better with a little more spiciness.

excellent, my husband and I were both skeptical about this one, but we absolutely love it. I have made it several times for just us and for company and even the pickiest person, my brother, loved it.  Thanks.

My husband is not a big meatloaf fan but I decided to try this recipe. I substituted 1/2 lb of the ground beef with hot Italian sausage and it was great. My husband loved this and will definitly eat this again.

WOW. I was on vacation visiting my son's family, and needed a recipe. I chose this because it had 5 stars. Everyone said it was the best meal I had cooked during my whole stay!  My husband even liked it better than my own recipe!! I did omit the ginger because I do not like it personally, but otherwise followed the recipe. Thank you so much.

I don't really like meatloaf and I hate ketchup. That being said, I thought this meatloaf was great! I was truly surprised that I liked it. I wanted to make this for my boyfriend as he likes meatloaf. I would definitely reduce the sugar. It was a bit too sweet for me. The ketchup/brown sugar layer came out jellied. Another option may be to add some chopped green peppers mixed in with the onion. The cooking time took longer with my oven too. Overall, it was fantastic. My boyfriend raved about it!

This is my family's favorite meatloaf recipe!  Never any leftovers...even when I double it!  Perfect seasonings for our taste....and we LOVE the ginger.  I do use onion powder instead of the chopped onion (family preference)and plain breadcrumbs when I'm crunched for time.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

No the best I've had but pretty good. I also mixed the brown sugar and ketchup to make a sauce and poured it on top of the meatloaf. The one thing I did not like is the amount of liquid it was floating in at the end. I've never had a meatloaf come out that way. However, you can keep this liquid and make more sauce out of it, like a gravy. It was not fat, just liquid. As always, I used extra lean ground beef.

I'm not a huge meatloaf fan, but this came out so good and really moist. I even left in the oven for over an hour by mistake, and it stayed moist (my bad). Cut back on the brown sugar by using only 1/2 the amount and threw in a tblspn worsterchire sauce. Perfect amount of sweetness. Delish.

This was so delicious!!  My family ate the whole thing in one night.  I didn't put as much brown sugar it it as the recipe called for since my husband doesn't like sweets.  Overall, it was perfect!

This meatloaf was AWESOME. Don't leave out the ginger - it adds really good flavor. I had to cook mine about 10 minutes longer than called for because I don't like the slightest hint of pink in my beef. Many people mentioned that it was too sweet for their taste but I thought the sweetness was perfect. My boyfriend took one bite and said "WOW." I will definitely make this again.

My whole family enjoyed this meatloaf, I would call it Teriaki meatloaf.  It has good flavor, the only thing I might add the next time I make it is a tablespoon of Soy Sauce (Shoyu).  The saltines did bring salt into the meat but not enough to balance the brown sugar.

I followed the recipe verbatim.  The sauce was a little too sweet for me, but my husband and kids really enjoyed it.  The meatloaf needs a little something to enhance the flavor.  I'll keep this recipe and tweek it based on other reviewers comments.

I agree the meatloaf is tasty, especially with the brown sugar. But like other rewiers' results, it became a little soggy. I added chopped tri-color bell peppers for a bit of texture as well as hot sauce to spike the flavor.

Unfortunately, my entire family thought this was a bit too sweet.  I like sweet, but this just didn't do it for me.  I'm thinking that we just don't like meatloaf, because I've had lukewarm reviews about other meatloaf recipes we've tried!  Thanks anyway!!!

I have to agree with everything the highest rated review said..I had the same experience.  I like more flavor in my meatloaf and did add some spices and a little worcheschire..still didn't help...I really like the flavor lipton onion soup adds and should have used this instead of just onion. My husband liked it very much...I'll go back to my own recipe and difinately add any glaze to the top of the loaf...prettier and has a much more carmalized texture and robust flavor.

This was great.  The only changes I made was using quick oatmeal instead of crackers, since I didn't have any crackers and then of course adding a bit more salt since I lacked the crackers.  I did add a little less than 1/2 brown sugar as suggested, but I do think I could have used the full 1/2 and it would have been fine.  Wonderful recipe! Thanks so much.  I will make this again.  My family is already asking again for it.

I'm sorry ... I know everyone loves this meatloaf, but I thought it was terrible.  The brown sugar sauce was like goo and was sickening-sweet.  The meatloaf itself fell apart.  I will not make this again.

This is an excellent recipe.  I followed the recipe except I used a 1/4 cup of brown sugar instead of the 1/2 cup.  It was still a bit on the sweet side, but excellent. I've never thought of doing a meatloaf this way. My family loved and I will definately cook it again, real soon.

This was a good meatloaf.  It's actually the first one I've ever made.  I wouldn't rate it "outstanding", but it was good, and I haven't eaten a lot of meatloaf in my life, so I'm kind of speaking from inexperience.  I made the recipe as directed.  My boyfriend thought it was a little sweet, but I liked that aspect of it.  Also, the uncooked loaf will seem very wet.  That's OK.  It bakes up just fine, and is nice and moist.

My sister recommended this recipe to me as her favorite meatloaf recipe and I am glad she did.  It is very delicious!  I used meatloaf mix (beef, pork & veal) and plain bread crumbs instead of ground beef and cracker crumbs when I made it.

The meat loaf turned out great but these are the changes I made based on the reviews:
1/2 C milk, used montreal steak seasoning instead of salt and pepper, loosly packed 1/2 C of sugar, put two splashes of worcestershire sauce to the glaze and put the glaze on both the top and the bottom.  I think next time I will try oats instead of crackers.  People talked about the ginger but I didn't taste it at all.  The loaf came out too "wet" for me so I think I will use less milk next time too.  But great flavor.

This was wonderful, you would never think that sweetness in a meat dish would be so good, but it is. I have made this twice, once I didn't have any crackers so I used rolled oats and it worked great also.

I went with the reviews and made a few changes.  Used no ginger, reduced to 1/2 cup milk, added a dash of garlic and worstershire into the meat mixture, and mixed a small amount of A-1 in with the ketchup.  I am not a meatloaf fan, but made it for my hubby.  He said it was AWESOME!  He ate a big helping at dinner and made a sandwich later that evening.  My 19 month old would not eat it.  I was not thrilled, but remember I am not a big fan.  I wish I had left out the garlic because it seemed to take over the dish.  Hubby wants it cooked again so it is a definite hit for people that like meatloaf!

My husband was getting sick of my same old Lipton meatloaf recipe, so this was this first diffrent one I tried.  This was the absolute best meatloaf I have ever tasted.  My fussy 2 year old son ate 3 helpings!  We won't go back to that old recipe anymore! Thanks for sharing it!

It was awesome!!!  I put the brown sugar on top and the ketchup on top of that.  I also used the Beefy Onion Mix by Lipton.  Tastiest meatloaf I have ever had!! My boyfriend thought it was a little sweet, so next time I might half the sugar, but it was still so yummy!!  Held together very well.

This recipe was so easy!  I followed the advice of others and used less milk...I think next time I need to use just a little more.  I backed off on the brown sugar.  I used Lipton Onion Soup Mix instead of onions.  I used 1 lb of ground beef and 1/2 lb of turkey.  This was the best meatloaf.  I rated it four stars because it was a little salty for me.  I did put 1 tablespoon of worcestershire so I should have backed off the salt a little.  Excellent flavor!

The whole family raved about this meatloaf, hubby requested more ginger, so I made it again. 2nd time, I forgot to add the milk and I only had 1 egg. We also doubled the meat and it was still great. Added extra ginger, minced garlic and worstechire sauce. This and the Rosemary Turkey Meatloaf from this site will be all I ever make again.

I have had this before, one thing that you can add to this is layering the top of the loaf with peppered bacon!  Just take uncooked peppered bacon and overlap them on the meatloaf prior to baking.  Mmmm, very moist!
cook at same temp and time

Oh my goodness, can I just say BRAVO!!! I used about 3lbs. ground beef (I just new this had to be good) so I doubled the brown sugar/ketchup mixture, I also added a little worchestishire,and a tad dry mustard. I like the sweetness!!  As others said in their review I added some to the mix and the rest on the top. I had to drain the grease a few times. I also had the oven on 375 because I was going to throw some cookies in afterward and they required 375. It didn't affect the outcome at all. I have never had such a fabulous meatloaf. It almost reminded me of Claim Jumpers meatloaf. I will never make another meatloaf!!!

This is the best meatloaf I've ever made. That's what my husband said. He raved about it. It is delicious. I also used 2 pounds hamburger, halved the brown sugar, and put some of it on the bottom, in the middle and the top. I also sauteed the onions, used Italian bread crumbs instead of crackers,and  omitted the salt and the ginger. These are all suggestions that I read in the reviews. I used a 13x9 pan instead of a loaf pan, and kept it covered while it was cooking. Excellent! Thanks for this one!

Really good recipe. I added a packet of onion soup mix to the meat, a bit less milk, 1/4 c. br. sugar, 1/4 c. ketchup and placed four strips of bacon on top. Was the right amount of sweet. Husband loved it. Thank you

My husband took one bite and declared this meatloaf "delicious!" This was my first time making a brown sugar meatloaf, and from now on this will be the only meatloaf recipe I'll be using. Because I used jumbo eggs I omitted the milk, and I put four strips of bacon on the top, other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it was REALLY good. Thank you for the great recipe!

This was really good. All of the guys at my house loved it. I did make a few adjustments, per the other suggestions on this site. I cut the brown sugar in half, which was still a little too sweet for me. Next time I will use less. I also added some worscheshire sauce to the ketchup and sugar mixture. I spread a little on the bottom of the pan, then poured the rest on top. I also used breadcrumbs, rather than crackers cause that is all I had on hand. I also cut the milk in half, cause it was definately too mushy. I actually had to add about another 1/4 cup of breadcrumbs to get the right consistancy. Definately will make this again!!

This meatloaf is great; awesome sauce.  I just don't like the meatloaf too dry, so I layered the brown sugar/ketchup underneath, in the middle, and above for a more juicy meatloaf.

Excellent Meatloaf.. I used BBQ sauce instead of ketchup & mixed it together with the brown sugar before lining the pan.  I shared the recipe with my mom & she loved it too.  (she added bacon to the top & said it was delicious)

This has become a huge hit...my husband and family loves this recipe.  The only changes I make are 2 lbs of meat, a dash of ginger, a few more crackers and I put the brownsugar on top and the ketchup on top of the sugar.  After an hour of cooking I dunp the fat juice out and mix the sugar/ketchup together...

I made a few changes to this recipe when I made it.  I added ketchup to the meat mixture as well as put it on top of the brown sugar. I also omitted the ginger because I was out, and cut the amount of brown sugar in half.  Next time I make this I will omit the milk and use less crackers as it was a bit mushy. My family really enjoyed this. Thanks for the recipe.

This is the best meatloaf ever!!  Thanks for submitting.  I omit the milk and add a few splashes of soy sauce and a clove or so of minced garlic, just adds a little extra flavor.  I use 1 lb. of lean ground beef and 1/2 lb. of ground pork.  This is now a family favorite.

This was very good! There were no leftovers. The only changes I made were minor. I added the mustard to the glaze and added some red and orange sweet peppers for color. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. Had great flavor and very easy. Will definitely make again!

I don't have a official Meat Loaf recipe so I am looking for new options.I read the reviews and made the following alterations: I omitted the ginger and added Onion Soup Mixwith a little extra milk to the meat mixture for more flavor. My husband and I liked the extra sweetness of the sauce on the bottom my daughter did not. That part is optional but the consistency of the meat loaf from the mixture recipe was very nice.  I will make it again

This is exactly like my favorite meat loaf, with one exception.  I blend the brown sugar and ketchup with 1 tsp. of dry mustard.  The result is wonderful, both sweet and spicy.  I will also use bread crumbs when I don't have the saltines.

My husband and I didn't think this was all that great.  Kids like it because it's a pretty mellow dish in terms of lack of "yucky i don't like that ingredients".  The funny thing was i thought it tasted better left over then the first night we had it.  I don't like sweets much.  Next time i would probably add some cayenne/hot sauce to balance the other flavors.

This is so good! The brown sugar and ketchup go so well and the ginger gives it such a subtle unique taste. It definately replaces my old meatloat recipe. My husband says that with some mushrooms it will be absolutely perfect.

This is the best meatloaf I have ever had! I thought the sweetness of the brown sugar to be perfect, however my husband wanted there to be a little less sweetness. I have made this recipe twice and plan to use it many more times in the future!

Great recipe.  Leftovers make great sandwiches!  I actually really enjoy stuffed meat loaf, but nothing beats the simplicity of this recipe...quick.  Uncooked loaves freeze very well, too.

This is the best meatloaf I've ever had, and it is perfect as is.  Mmmm.  So delicious. Perfectly sweet without being overbearing.  The brown sugar and ketchup works great on the bottom, so as to not make the flavor on top too sweet.  Then you can pour some of the sauce over the meatloaf to your liking.  This is one of the best recipes on this entire site--- it was FABULOUS!

I have never liked meatloaf but this was amazing.  I substitued onion powder since my boyfriend isn't a fan of veggies (and a VERY picky eater) and he loved it.  The meatloaf is very moist and the spices and brown sugar sauce give it a great taste.  You won't be disappointed!

I followed the recipe to the letter and it did not turn out for me.  After 1-1/2 hours of cooking, it was still raw in the middle.  I had to finish it in the microwave to make a decent dinner time...  Also, it was not a very flavorful meatloaf.  It had a bit of a sweet taste, but was just not what my family enjoys.  I have tried other recipes that I prefer to this one.

It's a good recipe. ALthough I add a lot of spices to make it spicier. Such as I addd 3 tbs of chopped garlic, add some dry mustard, add green peppr to, also sprinkle some parsley and oregano.

Truly delicious.  I only had 80/20 ground chuck, so I made it the day before and refrigerated it overnight.  The cold hardened the extra fat in the 80/20.  By morning it was easy to pick the fat off the top of the sauce (I used a teaspoon, but you could use anything including your fingers)  The fat was orange like cheddar cheese.   Followed the recipe almost exactly with a reduction in brown sugar to 1/3 a cup. Also used 2- 1/4 pounds of beef as that was the size package I had.  I had to cook it a little longer - just waited until the internal temp was 160 degrees. Really the best meatloaf I ever made - tender and juicy,

My family loved this recipe!  I omitted the onions and used onion powder instead because we don't like the crunch and also used Ritz cracker crumbs instead of the saltines.  It turned out wonderful.  We love the sweet taste!  This is my new meatloaf recipe!

This was the first time I made meatloaf, so I was surprised when it turned out really well!  I loved the sugar/ketchup combo.  Also, after reading other reviews, I used extra-lean (96%) ground beef, and the meatloaf was really moist without being greasy.

I did, however, cut the salt by half and increase the other spices a bit, since that's what we're more used to eating.  Delicious either way.

But when I make this next time, I may brown the onions some first -- they were still a little too crunchy.

I or my family couldn't really get into the sweet taste of the meatloaf.  I would use at least half the brown sugar when making it again.

This didn't work well for us. It was like plain hamburger, with a nice glaze. Made it again, this time mixing in the glaze/topping part but it was overall too sweet. We will try it again, but cut down on the brown sugar.

I am a new cook with a new gourmet kitchen and trying to figure it out.  This is one of my first attempts at anything and it was incredibly easy and we all loved it, I dont care for ginger so I subsituted it for garlic powder. Awesome and easy and I think I found a new hobby, I actually like cooking

My husband and I love this recipe!  We do use about half of the recommended ketchup and brown sugar and add a bit of steak sauce an garlic salt to the mix.  Great as left overs.

My entire family loved this recipe.  I didn't add the ginger and I mixed all of the ingredients together and it tasted great.  Next time I would cut down on the brown sugar some so it wouldn't be quite so sweet.  I also cooked carrots in the pan with it.

This is my wife's FAVORITE recipe.  If we don't have this dish at least once every 2 weeks, I'd probably be divorced.

I have to say, I really enjoy the dish as well.  I love the sweetness from the brown sugar.

I made this for my sister, and she said it was the best she had ever had. I agree...
The only thing I did different was add 4 slices of bacon on top and cover with ketchup. Moist and Juicy!!!!

This was very good!  I made this for 5-6 servings using one pound of meat (I have actually purchased a 2nd pan so I can make 2lbs next time).  I like things sweet so I thought I would give it a try at full strength - wow! - was that sweet!  Next time I am going to try it with about 1/8 less sugar, I still want it sweet but I would like to take it down a notch so I will keep taking it down till I get the right meat to sugar ratio.  I also split the sauce putting 1/2 on top and 1/2 on bottum - came out nice and juicy!  This is now a family favorite and yet one more thing to do with ground beef!

Yeah, the ingredients are wierd...BUT it works really well. I follow the directions as written, and the result is fantastic. I hate to rank it as the "best" meatloaf ever, because I don't think it's so easily categorized. The flavors here are different than most meatloafs... but they are wonderful...

Make it and come to your own conclusion...I found it to be truly unique and wonderful...and on a grading platform of "great food" as opposed to "great meatloaf" I give it 5 stars.

I have used this recipe several times and I would suggest that if you make this, to use 93% or above lean ground beef.  The first time I made this, it turned out runny and messy because I didn't use a lean enough beef.  Now that I have figured it out it has been perfect!  The flavor is excellent and my family loves it.

I was looking for a basic meatloaf recipe when I found this.  Since I'm not a fan of the brown sugar/ketchup combination, I omitted that and the ginger.  I doubled the reciped (it doubles so easily!) and used garlic and herb breadcrumbs instead of saltine cracker crumbs.  Instead of using a loaf pan, I formed the loaves in a baking dish so that the fat could drain off.  It makes for firmer meatloaf that way - great for leftover meatloaf sandwiches the next day.  My 7 year old turned his nose up while I was making it, but was asking for seconds later on!  He even asked for it the next day, too.  The second meatloaf was put in the freezer for another day.

I used half of the ketchup/brown sugar mix for the bottom, and the other half for the top. This is very very moist and juicy. Next time I will decrease the amount of brown sugar (maybe by half).

Quick and Easy!  Yes, my first instinct was to put the ketchup/brown sugar "topping" on the TOP! However, it was simple and when I popped it out of the pan onto the serving plate, it was beautiful and evenly colored with no brown/burning spots from the sugar.  Thanks!

I made this for a family night at church.  I changed the servings to 137 so that the ground beef would come out to be 5 pounds for shopping purposes and 27 servings (I think) for 5 pounds for the preparing.  I made the meatloves in 5 batches, one onion and 1 1/2 sleves of crackers, everything else was to the mesurements.  The onions really do need to be chopped tiny.  I put the loaves on huge baking sheets, mixed the brown sugar and ketchup together, poured on top, Make sure it all gets covered or it will be dry and crunchy in the area.  Baked for 1 1/ hours.  VERY YUMMY!  got lots of great feedback even from those who did not know I was the cook!  Thank-you Wanda!

This was a delicious meatloaf. I used 2lbs. of ground beef and I put the brown sugar/ketchup mixture on the top. I also made an extra batch of the brown sugar/ketchup mixture (1/2 cup of each) and baked it in a small baking dish for the last 20 mins. or so.

Great meatloaf.  Like many others, I changed it up a bit, but not much.  I used 2 lbs of meat b/c that is what I had thawed.  I decreased the sugar by half.  And I did not have any ginger so I just left it out.  My mother in law claimed it was the best meatloaf she had ever tasted, and requested the recipe for the future.  Thanks for a good recipe!

I like the ginger added to this meatloaf.  It changed just a regular meatloaf into something with a little more zip.  The first time I made this, I followed the directions exactly and it came out a bit dry.  When I made it again, I lowered to 325 and cooked a bit longer.  I also added a bit of dry mustard to the sauce mixture to give it a little more flavor (a tip my grandmother used to hand out).

Definitely good.  I am not to crazy about the sweetness though, thought it may have been a bit much.  But I will say that it is very different from other meatloaf that I have tried.  Very easy to make, very filling, but not "the best."

A very simple recipe, but quite possibly the best meat loaf I have ever eaten.  The various flavors come across perfectly.  My wife loves this one too.

Loved It!!!!!  My whole life I have grown up not eating meatloaf because of the awful one my mother used to make.  I gave this one a try one night and have not regretted it.  The ketchup and brown sugar work wonderfully together.  My husband requests it all the time and I don't mind appeasing him.  It is one of the few things that he will eat for the following days until it is gone.

Whoever thinks a meatloaf is a meatloaf is a meatloaf....hasn't tried this recipe!  So simple but so good.  My house still smells like this meatloaf (normally I don't like residue cooking smell) which inspired me to leave this review.

Way to sweet as is & taste like a cheap restaurant meatloaf. I'm going to try once more, but using half the sugar & ketchup. Also, only 1/4c milk & 1/2 the salt. Maybe 1/2 tsp ginger. My husband said to combined the ketchup & brown sugar & put on top of the loaf. We like our meatloaf to be firmer & not mushy when handling.

THIS MEATLOAF IS SO YUMMY AND SO EASY TO MAKE.  MY HUSBAND REALLY LIKED THIS.  I LOVED THE BROWN SUGAR/KETCHUP GLAZE.  I DIDN'T HAVE ANY GINGER SO I USED GARLIC INSTEAD.

Being a rookie cook, I've only made meat loaf a few different ways. I made this for my wife when she came home from work and she gave this recipe a rave review. Personally, I like this recipe as well as any meat loaf I've ever had wheather made by myself or anyone else.  I gave it five stars!

This was very good - DH loved it.  I had subbed breadcrumbs for the cracker crumbs, but next time I will use oats instead (that's just the texture I prefer).

definately a 5 star classic...but the idea of cooking in a loaf pan and being able to just flip and serve is pure brilliance.Use those non stick loaf pans and it makes that glaze clean up sooo easy.Loved it-thanks.

I can't tell you how many people I've shared this recipe with. People who have never liked meatloaf and now consider it their favorite meal (my husband included). I absolutely love this recipe. Fantastic comfort food with mashed potatoes/gravy with a side of carrots. It's perfect every time.

This meatloaf was fantastic. I was worried about not using my usual glaze but this recipe kinda reversed the glaze. The bottom turned out to have the best sweet flavored glaze you could imagine. The only change I made was that I used Ritz Crackers rather than Saltine since that's all I had in the house. Thumbs up from all 4 of us here. I'll be making this again for certain!

I followed other reviewers advice and used half the brown sugar and put the glaze on top. Also added 1Tbls  worchester to the ketchup mixture. It did take about an hour and a half to cook completely. Really good! No leftovers. This is going to be my main meatloaf recipe from now on. Next time I make it, I'm going to try doubling the sauce and mixing some in with the meat. I am also going to make it in a larger pan to decrease cook time and cover more of the meat with the sauce.

This recipe is wonderful. I've made meatloaf before, but never like this. I used a red onion instead of a regular onion and it was VERY good!! My husband really enjoyed it also. I even called my mom and told her about the great new recipe that I found!!!! Two thumbs up.

This recipe was great. I don't usually like meatloaf because it is bland, but this was a knockout. It had loads of flavor. I have given the recipe to several people who also think it is wonderful. I didn't change a thing.

My family does not care for meatloaf.  I made this recipe because of its 5* rating, and the need to make something different.  I am soooo glad I did!  It was a hit!
Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this with ground turkey and it turn out great.  I used less brown sugar.  It will still have a sweet flavor if you cut the sugar in half.  Also, don't skip the ground ginger.  The little bit of ginger flavor actually makes a big difference.

Pretty good. Very quick and easy to make.  The topping part is quite yummy, but the main loaf was a little less seasoned that we would prefer. I will definitely make this again, but will add some worcestershire sauce to see if we can kick it up a notch!

We didn't like this at all.  My 3 year old, who loves meatloaf, wanted no part of this.  I made the recipe exactly as written (probably should have followed some of the rater's suggestions).  It was far too sweet, and the cracker crumbs made it too salty.  And while it seems to be a contradiction, it was also too bland.  I won't make this again.

Wow!  I am not a big meatloaf fan, but this is really great.  My husband said it was the best meatloaf he had ever tasted. I substituted barbecue sauce for the ketchup. Really tasty!

My husband and I really enjoyed the brown sugar and ketchup glaze on the meatloaf.  I suspect that it really should've been made in a loaf pan.  I didn't have one, so I shaped the meat into a loaf and put it in the casserole dish I usually use for meatloaf.  It was very moist and since it was sitting on top of the ketchup and brown sugar I had placed on the bottom of the dish, the hamburger had a hard time keeping its shape.  I cut some potatoes and put them around the meatloaf which helped hold it together.  The only other mistake I think I made was that I crushed the crackers way too much which resulted in having too many of them in the meatloaf.  The crackers didn't dry it out, but theirs was a predominant flavor in the dish.  Thanks for sharing, Starbuck.  I'll definitely try it, again.

Fantastic, though I did change a few things from the original recipe.

I used just a bit less of the brown sugar.
I added just a bit of bbq sauce to the ketchup mixture.
I used a pack of onion soup mix instead of an onion.
And I put just a little bit of worch. and A1 sauce into the meat mixture.
I didn't even add any ginger. 

And about five minutes before it was done, I put a little extra ketchup on top. It was delicious.

VERY good but VERY sweet. I used the recommendations of others and put 1/2 of the brown sugar / ketchup on the bottom of the pan and the other 1/2 on the top of the pan.  I also reduced my brown sugar to 1/4 of a cup and it was still very sweet.  I added a splash of Wosterchire sauce to the ketchup.  Overall the meatloaf was very tasty and my husband and 15 month daughter both loved it.  I used ground turkey.

This was the first time I've ever made meatloaf. It was delicious! I followed everyone else's advice, putting only 1/4 cup sugar, and divided the sugar/ketchup mixture on the top and bottom of loaf. I only used 1/2 a small onion and only added 1/2 cup of milk. I used bread crumbs instead. It didn't turn out too sweet, it was just perfect. I used lean ground beef (not extra lean) and it didn't turn out too greasy. Will definately make again! Thanks!!

My boyfriend said this is the best meatloaf he has ever tried, and he gave 5 stars. I used good quality Extra Lean Angus Beef which created very good beef taste. Meatloaf tastes so good even without gravy. Highly Recommended!!!

I LOVE this recipe!  Since I usually buy cheaper ground beef that isn't as lean, I mixed the brown sugar with the ketchup and put it on top.  At the end of the cooking time, when I poured off the fat, I didn't lose all of the sauce.

This is the very best meatloaf I have ever made! My husband who does not like meatloaf even loved it and asked me to make it again. I did not have beef so I used ground turkey instead. It turned out delicious, too. I know I will make this again and again and this will be the only meatloaf recipe I will use. Millions of thanks to you for sharing this great recipe.

I have made this recipe several times.  It comes out perfect everytime.  I think this is the classic meatloaf recipe, and while I continue to try different meatloaf recipes just for the variety I think this one sets the bar.

This was my first meatloaf attempt ever, and that being the case, this was decent.  My boyfriend liked the sweet flavor (I could hardly taste the brown sugar, but I did use only 1/4 cup as recommended).    I used super lean beef, so it was not too greasy... actually, it was a bit dry for my taste.

I really changed this recipe per other raters advise.  I used 2 lbs. 15% fat ground beef, not lean, keeps your loaf more moist and put in an 8x8 pan.  I didn't add any liquid due to higher fat in the meat.  I omitted the salt, pepper and onion and replaced it with onion soup mix and some Worcestershire sauce.  I also added half the glaze to bottom and half to top.  The top was really sweet, but the bottom much better.  If you're using a loaf pan and adding glaze to the top I can see how this recipe would be really sweet.  If you want a sweet loaf put the glaze on top if you want milder sweet follow the recipe.  I just love cocktail meatballs and next time I think I will use chili sauce and grape jelly instead of ketchup and brown sugar.

I did not like this meatloaf.  I thought it tasted too meaty.  For those who want to try it, I would suggest adding alot more cracker crumbs or adding bread cubes instead.  The brown sugar topping, however, was good, and I might try it with another recipe.

This is an awesome meatloaf recipe.  I never liked meatloaf until I came across this one.  My mother's was always dry and had no flavor to it.  This is the best, hubby always requests it, and I have no problem making it!  Delish!

This recipe was terrific! The ginger and brown sugar add a great taste to boring meatloaf. The only small changes I made was I used 2 slices of fresh bread instead of breadcrumbs, added some worcestershire sauce and a little ketchup to the meat mixture. My picky eaters ate it up!

This meatloaf is super delicious and my guests loved it.  It was a bit too juicy though.  I cooked it much longer than 1 hour and the juices were still not clear.  Next time I'll reduce the milk.  Thanks!!

Yes, it's really good.  I wondered what the ginger would be like in it, but I didn't think it stood out as a flavor at all, so it must have blended in well.  I put the sauce on top AND on the bottom.  It was good enough that I had a meatloaf sandwich for breakfast the next morning. (Sick, I know!) :)  Slurp!

This was great!  I did change a few things.  I used oatmeal instead of saltines and put the brown sugar and ketchup on top.  Excellent!

I never really liked meatloaf as a kid, but this intrigued me...what a surprise!  The brown sugar and ketchup is wonderful together!  This hit the spot on a cold day.  It was even better the next day!  I will make this again!

I'm new to cooking and had never made meatloaf before.  My boyfriend, who's been only moderately enthusiastic about my attempts at dinner thus far, was thrilled with this meal and ate two servings in 10 minutes!  I loved it too.

Bland and dripping with fat.  A few bites had a bit of sweetness, but the brown sugar/ketchup "topping" turned so soupey that it was hardly noticable.

Very Good.  Both me and my husband like meatloaf so it was nice to have something different for a change & good!  This was easy too.  The best part was that my kids who won't eat my regular meatloaf did eat this and wanted seconds!

The meatloaf was very moist.  The only suggestion I have is to make sure you use lean ground beef.  I tried to save money by using less lean ground beef and I ended up with a lot of grease in the bottom.  It was still very good!

This recipe was very good - but very sweet.  I used only one pound of ground beef, 1 egg, 2/3 cup of saltines etc, but I used all of the brown sugar and ketchup.  The flavour was absolutely delicous, but I think we would have been better to cut down on the sauce ingredients.  This is a definite keeper.

I grew up HATING meatloaf -- or rather that gross green pepper/ketchup laden glob that mom used to make -- but THIS meatloaf is divine!  My husband thought he hated meatloaf too until he had this.

p.s.  My kids still won't touch it.  That's okay -- leaves more for us!

I love meatloaf and attempted to make a meatloaf recipe from the back of an onion soup mix once, and it came out horribly.  Finally, five years later, I decided to give it one more try.  The only modifications I made were: 1) used 2lbs. of hamburger, leaving the rest of the ingredients as is 2) putting the brown sugar and ketchup on top due to the amount of grease that would accumulate on the bottom of the pan.  The meatloaf itself was very good.  My boyfriend didn't care for the brown sugar on it.  I also thought it was a bit too sweet and would cut way back on the brown sugar next time.  Overall this was a good meatloaf.

This was delicious.  I made a couple of changes while making it though.  I put the ketchup/brown sugar glaze on top of the meat, I omitted the ginger and i added some of the ketchup glaze into the meat.  We started the meat in the microwave for 10 min. stirring every once and a while so we could cut down on the cooking time.  then we cooked it in the loaf pan adding the glaze on top and cooked it for 30min.  great with baked potatoes! thanks for the recipe

I accidentally mixed the sugar and ketchup, but it still tasted okay.  I followed everyone else's suggestions and put it on top, using only 1/4 c of brown sugar + 1 Tbsp. of worcestershire sauce.  It was really watery.  I also prepared everything the night before and baked it the next day.  But overall I was quite impressed.  So easy to make, and my guests liked it too.

I enjoyed the sweet taste of this recipe.  I used brown sugar substitute instead of regular brown sugar (I accidentally bought substitute instead of regular).  I added ketchup and brown sugar sub in the meat mix in addition to just laying it on the pan.  I also mixed in some bread crumbs as well as a slice of bread in addition to the crackers.  The ketchup and brown sugar on the bottom really helped make the bottom of the meatloaf juicy.  Usually, I add barbeque sauce on top of the meatloaf 15 minutes prior to the end of the cook time to provide a juicy taste - both together make a juicy meatloaf. A sweet tasting meatloaf.

If you're wanting meatloaf, try this recipe!!! It's moist and has just the right amount of sweetness. I used plain bread crumbs rather than cracker crumbs and we really enjoyed it. Looking forward to leftovers as meatloaf sandwiches tomorrow!

This is so terribly yummy.  The only problem I had was that I used cheap beef which produced alot of grease.  When I poured the grease off alot of the ketchup and brown sugar went with it.  However...I used this to make gravy and poured it on top of the meatloaf which we ate over onion rolls.  Delicious.

The brown sugar/ketchup mixture was very very tasty.  I didn't have any crackers so I just used bread crums which worked good too.

This is delicious!  I did have to pour off quite a bit of the extra liquid that all of the milk makes.  I wonder why it calls for so much?  Other than that, it was a hit with the family.  Thanks for sharing!

This is the best Meatloaf recipe that I have come accross.  I'm always asked whan I'm going to do Meatloaf.  The brown sugar and ketchup blends well together. I usually do enough for 30 people.  Alittle extra work but well worth the trouble. One note though, I used little less milk.

Made the following modifications:  eliminated the salt and pepper; substituted onion soup mix for the onions and italian bread crumbs for the crackers; added 1 t prepared mustard and some garlic powder; decreased milk to 1/2 cup.  Baked loaf for 30 min without the brown sugar/ketchup mixture.  Drained fat.  Added 1/4 c each brown sugar and ketchup to the top and finished baking 30 minutes.  Used ground chuck.  Excellent!

I used half the amount of brown sugar it called for and it turned out great.  I also baked it in a glass pirex baking dish on the bbq on low heat which get's to about the same tempature as the oven and it's a lot cheaper to use..  Plus it has that outdoor bbq flavor... Great stuff..

This is a really good recipe!!! I have made this before, using it from a cookbook. The thing I do with mine is, after cooking, let it sit for few minutes and then tip loaf pan over on plate. That way all of the brown sugar/ketchup glaze will drip down sides. Very yummy!!!

This recipe is amazing. My husband and I LOVE it -Since Ive found this recipe, I never make meatloaf any other way. Only thing Ive changed is I saute the onions before adding to the meatloaf mixture - gave it fabulous flavor - I dont care for the crunch of onions in my meatloaf. Thank you so much for this! I never liked meatloaf before trying this recipe!

I used onion soup mix instead of onions, and then skipped the extra salt.  I put the brown sugar/ketsup mixture on top and bottom.  It was a hit!  Not too sweet at all but very moist.

My new favorite meatloaf.  I love sweet anything, so this was great.  My husband liked it but it was to sweet for him.  Kids still wouldn't eat meatloaf, but I have made it several times. Put the brown sugar on top.

This was the very first recipe that I tried off this site.  I've never been a fan of meatloaf, but my bf asked that I make one.  I gotta tell you, it was FANTASTIC!!  I put the sugar/ketchup mixture on both top and bottom.  Thanks!

This meatloaf is amazing. I used seasoned bread crumbs instead of the saltine cracker and added roasted red peppers. This has become a family favorite, we make it every few weeks. I made the same mistake as others, mixing the ketchup and brown sugar in with the meat. I've also tried it as just a topping as the recipe suggests, andI prefer it all mixed in together. Thanks so much for sharing!

I didn't get to eat any of the meatloaf. I didn't feel well and went to bed. But my husband and 2 friends eat all of it with the rest of the meal. They told me the next day it was very good. I did some of the changes only 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 ketchup. Put it on top. Added 1/2 powered mustard, seasoned bread crumbs 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder. Also added some green peppers chopped. Hope I get to taste it next time. Husband wants me to make again.

I absolutely love this recipe.  My only variation is I add just a little brown sugar to the meatloaf and I put a mixture of brown sugar and ketchup on the top.  I made this for a friend of mine and my daughter who both hated meatloaf.  Now they both eat meatloaf...but only if it's made this way.  I make it with mashed potatoes and use the leftovers in shepherds pie.  It is just fabulous!  Mix a little cheddar cheese in with the left over mashed potatoes for a little extra something special.

This recipe is good, I have this EXACT recipe in a cookbook I bought on vacation in North Dakota.  The title of the cookbook is "Best of the Best from the Great Plains"  and the recipe is called 'Upsidedown Meatloaf'.

my 2nd time making it and once again, my hubby and brother LOVED it! I agree with reducing the sugar to 1/4 cup and reducing the milk also to 1/2. Also added green onions to the meat mixture along with some minced garlic...YUM! Definately will be making this alot...

Maybe it was something I did wrong, but my sauce was "runny".  I like a meatloaf with a thick sauce.  It was tasty however and I will try again to see if I can modify it.

Although we ate this two nights in a row, we've enjoyed other meatloaf recipes much more.  This one was a bit too sweet and nothing about it stood out as extra special.  We did, however, enjoy the second day leftovers more than the first time around.

When even my mother asked for the recipe, I knew it was a winner! I especially love it the day after on a sandwich. Since I live in Germany and have a hard time getting saltines, i substitute dry bread or crumbs and that tastes just as good. Thanks!

This is very much like my family favorite recipe.  We put the glaze on top (as mentioned by others) and add a dash of mustard to the ketchup/brown sugar mixture...adds a nice tang to the glaze.  We also add mustard(either jarred or powered)and tomato sauce (or ketchup, tomato juice-whatever you have on hand) to the loaf mix.  Always a hit!

Best meatloaf I've ever tasted!! I took others' advice and used bread crumbs instead of crackers (that's all I had) and put half of ketchup mixture on bottom and other half on top.  Make sure you use VERY lean beef, or it will be too greasy.  My husband said it was better than Cracker Barrel's meatloaf, and that's a big compliment!!  Great with mashed potatoes and fresh snap beans!!

I thought this was very good meatloaf- although it is a little on the sweet side. My husband said he preferred traditional meatloaf. I will defintitely make this again but it will not be our staple meatloaf. Did follow recipe except put half sauce on bottom and half on top. It did make an excellent leftover.

While I appreciate the idea for this meatloaf, my family wants me to stick with my own regular one.  My daughter was the only one who kind of like it, and she didn't even finish the whole piece.  Thanks anyway!

THIS IS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC! I PUT 1/2 OF THE SAUCE ON THE TOP OF THE MEATLOAF BEFORE PUTTING IT IN THE OVEN, THEN ADD THE REMAINING SAUCE (ON TOP AGAIN)10 MINUTES BEFORE IT COMES OUT OF THE OVEN. I ALSO ADDED 1&1/2 TSP.WORCESTHERSHIRE TO THE SAUCE AND ADDED ONE PACK OF LIPTONS DRY ONION SOUP MIX TO THE MEAT MIXTURE, I ALSO USED GREEN ONIONS. MAKES WONDERFUL LEFT OVERS FOR SANDWICHES!

Way to sweet!  Definitely only use 1/4 of a cup of brown sugar!  Other than that it was good.

Excellent!  I followed another reviewers suggestion and put the Brown Sugar and Ketchup on top of the loaf instead of the bottom before placing it in the oven.  I didn't have any crackers so I used about 3/4 cup of bread crumbs and it came out just great.  It definitely passed the husband and kid test in my house.  I served it with buttered peas and roasted potato wedges...yum!

This recipe was good but a bit too sweet. I put half the brown sugar on the bottom and the other half on top. Next time I make it I will used less brown sugar. I also substituted oatmeal for the cracker crumbs.

This meatloaf is soooo yummy and easy to make.  I always leave the ginger out though because it just sounds weird.  My hubby asks for this at least once a week.

Very good and easy recipe!  I made this recipe about a month ago.  I used a mixture of bread crumbs and cornflake crumbs (my family has always liked meatloaf made with cornflake crumbs!) instead of the cracker crumbs.  I added a little Worchestershire sauce to the meat mixture.  I too, put half the brown sugar/ketchup mixture on the bottom and half on the top.  My husband really liked this and told me to save the recipe.  Guess what's for supper tonight?

I've found my new meatloaf.  Previously I was using "Ann's Sisters Meatloaf" and was pretty happy with this, but now that we've tried this one we may never make that one again.  I love the glaze, and the texture is perfect as well.  I've never been a fan of meatloaf, and just made it for my husband.  Now he's going to have to share with me.

I really, really liked this recipe. I put all of the brown sugar mix on top of the meatloaf, not the bottom. However, my husband scraped the top off because he thought it was too sweet and he prefers ketchup. My advice - If you are cooking it for someone who LOVES the ketchup on top, don't make this recipe. If you are open to change, make it, I loved it.

I would have rated it a 5 ("the best!") except that I haven't tasted all meatloaves.  It's certainly the best one I've ever tasted.  Brown sugar and onions make just about anything taste great.

I followed this recipe exactly and was very impressed with the results.  The only thing I would do differently next time is to saute the onions a little bit before adding them to the ground beef mixture.  Also, I will be sure to use very lean meat, since the sauce was a little greasy (granted, the ground beef I used wasn't very lean).

This was very good for meat loaf. No one in our family is a huge meatloaf fan, but we all ate this. I did use ground turkey intead of hamburger. Turned out pretty good. Next time we have meat loaf I would use this recipe again.

This was good. The only thing I'll do differently next time is decrease the brown sugar. The glaze was just a tad too sweet. I also decreased the milk to 1/2 cup, added a shot of worcestershire sauce to the ketchup, and used breadcrumbs instead of saltines. Next time I make meatloaf I'll use this recipe. Thanks Starbuck!

Not great, not bad either.  My hubby preferred "Ann's Sister's Meatloaf" available on this site.  If I were to make this recipe again, I would definitely put the ketchup and brown sugar in with the other ingredients.  I only used half of the amount of sugar and ketchup and it was too much for just on top (too sweet, and I like sweets).  The texture is nice though (I did have to use lowfat Ritz, all I had).  Could use some more spices, a little bland/flat tasting.

Awesome!  I'm very picky when it comes to meat loaf.  This was easy to make and tasted delicious.  One of the few meals where everyone at the table asked for seconds, including a picky 5-year old and 3-year old.

Instead of baking in a loaf pan, I shaped the meat into a loaf shape and brushed the brown sugar glaze over the top.  It was delicious.  I think I'll make it again tonight. Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

This really is a great recipe.  Not your same old everyday meatloaf.  The brown sugar and ketchup crust, I think, is really the secret to this one.  I love this recipe just as written.

There are not enough stars to rate this recipe.  This was by far the BEST meatloaf I've ever had.  The only things I did differently was to put the ketchup mixture on top of the loaf and to add bell peppers to the meat mixture.  A+++ recipe!

This recipe is simple yet exceptional.  Usually I like to try new variations every time I make something as routine as meatloaf but this tangy, juicy meatloaf is so great, my husband requests it over all other types of meatloafs I have made.  It has a great flavor.

This was an easy, good meatloaf.  We doubled the recipe and glazed the bottom, top and sides.  Cut back on the brown sugar about 2/3.  I added a dash of teriyaki sauce to the glaze, which was a nice touch, and we used green onions.  Yum!

Every time I make a meatloaf it always come out bland and way too soggy.My husband loves this meatloaf, and its not too soggy.I used the brown sugar and ketchup as a glaze, and my tip to you is make sure if you  use it as a glaze to make the sugar even with the ketchup especially around the edges.Its the best meatloaf I ever made and the best Ive ever eaten.

In the event that I may have done something wrong, which I doubt, this was pretty mushy. Not altogether that flavorful.

I made this meatloaf twice, the first time I thought it was too sweet so I reduced the Brown sugar by half, it was wonderful.  My husband loved it!!

This meatloaf was pretty good. I made it for lunch one day when I really didn't have anything in the house. So I decided to try it. I liked the sweetness of it, but it did start to get kind of...runny, I would say. That's probably not the best word to use...but anyway, I think that only happened because I'm not used to making meatloaf and I don't really think I put it together like I was supposed to. Overall, it was good and I think whatever was wrong with it was my fault.

I've made this recipe twice.  The first time I tried sprinkling a little cinnamon on top of the meatloaf.  It was good, but I thought better the second time without it.  Also, I found that rolling my meatloaf (not mentioned in the directions) in saran wrap made it's presentation much more attractive.  Thanks for sharing this one!  Everyone gave it rave reviews!

I did not have any lean ground beef to use, so I used the higher fat, and formed into a loaf shape, baking on a foil lined broiler pan.  All of the fat drained off, and it was delicious!

Instead of crackers, I use bread crumbs.

YUM YUM YUM! This will be my meatloaf recipe from now on! To make it "mine", I used buttery round crackers (didn't have saltines)and we like our meatloaf firmer so doubled the crumbs, 1T worchestershire, and used the suggestion of 1/2 sauce on top, 1/2 on bottom.  Yes, extra-lean meat is best to avoid tons of grease mixing in w/the sauce. Tonight I'm trying 1/2# ground pork and 1# beef.  Can't wait!  Thanks for a great recipe! MMMMMMMMMMMMM! (Can you tell I liked it :)  ?)

delicious. easy preparation, even with a 3 year old helper. Every one who eats meatloaf with ketchup on it would love this, it needs no extra sauce because it is yummie by itself!

This was pretty tasty is you like sweet.  My roommate said it was the best meatloaf ever!  I followed other reveiwers and used 1/4 c br sugar & ketchup on bottom.  I took the remaining sugar & sprinked it on top,  then brushed on remaining ketchup.  Will probably make again, but prefer cajun meatloaf!

This is by far most the best meatloaf. The best part, is I always have the stuff in the house. I usually make 2 (1 with onion and 1 with out for the kids). I just add a little more spice (pepper, garlic & basil). Great the next day for lunches too. This is a keeper.

Made recipe as written. The ketchup & brown sugar sauce is very tastey. The meatloaf itself is very moist but also very BLAND. Will not use this recipe again, it needs too much help in the taste department!

Good, quick and easy.  Nothing special and it was actually very liquidy as the meat was surrounded by quite a lot of grease.

I am a meatloaf lover, so I saw all the fantastic reviews for this and tried it.  It was quite bland, I had to season it quite a bit to want to eat it.  Not an awful dish, just lacks taste.

This was ok, and my Husband and (meatloaf hating) kids liked it.  Which is a plus in my book.  For that reason alone I will probably make it again.  I like to try the recipes exactly as posted the first time I make them, but I do wish I had put some of the brown sugar and ketchup on top as some of the other reviews mentioned.  Good basic meatloaf with no bells or whistles.

Oh wow! This is great meatloaf.  My husband didn't care for it (he didn't like the sweetness).  So he scraped off the glaze and ate it that way.  (Make sure you use extra lean meat or all the fat will be sitting in with your glaze at the bottom). Serve with pita bread...yummy!

Very moist!  Great flavor.  Excellent recipe.  My first meatloaf since 'dryloaf' as a kid.  Split the brown sugar and ketchup top and bottom, and it needs nothing else. Even the ketchup junkies won't need it for the second bite.

I was impressed with the texture of this meatloaf but that was about it. I found it to be quite bland aside from the taste of ginger which I didn't find to be very appealing in meatloaf. I would use this recipe as a base only to achieve the nice texture again. It just need's something more.

Delicious!  Best meatloaf I've ever had.  I added 1 Tbs. worcestershire sauce and substituted 1/2 cup soy milk for the milk.  Still tastes great and was very moist.

Our family is split on this one. My husband said it's his new favorite, but my son and I didn't care too much for it. You really do have to get the leanest ground beef you can get. The bottom was also too sweet for me. I'll try again since my husband loves it, but will definitely cut down on the glaze.

I was disappointed with this recipe.  It tasted just like an ordinary meatloaf to me.  I couldn't taste the ginger at all, and the glaze was way, way too sweet.  I didn't like it on the bottom either, it was strange.  As other reviewers said, this recipe takes much longer than an hour to cook.  I used the suggested pan size, but at an hour it still looked raw.  I bumped up the heat to 375 degrees, and was able to serve it at an hour and a half, but it wasn't exactly hot in the middle.

One word - EXCELLENT!  I would probably bake it a little longer though.  I like my meatloaf to be very dry.  Also, the sugar and ketchup on the bottom was awesome!

Very disappointing.  Brown sugar didn't add a thing to the taste.  Very dull even for meatloaf.  Won't make again.

I was having 20 for dinner last night, and wanted something that I could prepare a little ahead, but have cooking as people were arriving.  This recipe fit the bill perfectly, and with 499 positive reviews, well.... I scaled the recipe for 24 people and put it into a much larger pan.  The only thing discrepancy between the recipe and the actual preparation, would be that when scaled, you of course need to allow more prep. time, and the cooking time was longer because of the size of the pan.
My guests loved the meatloaf - all had seconds, and everyone asked for the recipe.
Thanks to Starbuck  - a real winner!!!

I mis-read the  recipe and it was still superb.  My  mistake  was that I added ketchup to the meatloaf mix (feeling that it was 'not right' when I did) and the mixture was a bit too fluid.  The ketchup also made it difficult to discern if the meat was cooked well enough.   Well, even with such an error, the meatloaf was great.  The brown sugar added a rich sweetness that  I did not get when I used to glaze my meatloaf with a ketchup/honey glaze.  (I might try adding onion soup mix rather than onions the next time for more seasoned flavor).  Great recipe, Starbuck!

This is the best meatloaf recipe I have ever tried!  I used 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 ground venison.  I had my in-laws over for dinner and they loved it!  I didn't think my husband would like the sweetness, but he loved it too.  Super easy, too.

This is the first mealoaf I've cooked and it was excellent. I put half the sugar and ketchup IN the meatloaf and mixed the remainder together and poured it over the TOP. I went to the fridge for a quick lunch the next day and my hubby had taken ALL the leftovers to work ... always a good sign. Will definately be making it again and again.

My husband says this is the best meatloaf he has ever had. Even my PICKY brother in law liked this. The only change I added was some chopped onion and green bell pepper, just because thats the way mom makes hers :).

My husband hates meatloaf but really enjoyed this.  The sauce that the ketchup and brown sugar make is really good and makes the meat really moist.  Superb sandwiches too.

This one is a sure keeper. I followed recipe as printed here only decreased brown sugar to 1/3c. Try this for dinner if you like meatloaf, you will be glad you did.

Excellent! What a great flavor! I love meat loaf and have tried a few different recipes that I consistently use, but I'll be using this from now on, and I didn't even have the ginger on hand. The family raved about it. thanks for this recipe

All my life I hated meatloaf.  I only made this because my husband had been requesting meatloaf.  Even after reading the great reviews.. I was apprehensive.  Now I can only say, I wish my mother had this recipe.  I am about to make it for the 4th time since I first made it 4 months ago.  It has become not my my husband's.. but my favorite!!!  Thanks

I have never been too crazy about meatloaf.  It was just something else to make out of ground 
beef, but this recipe is definitely an exception.
It is very flavorful and moist.  I did as another person suggested and put the glaze in the bottom of the pan and also on top of the meatloaf.  Fantastic recipe.  Thanks for sharing this one, Starbuck!

This is the only meal we ever remember my six year old asking for seconds. We've made it over and over again. Tasted great with just half the brown sugar. Also appears more appealing to kids with ketchup and sugar on top rather than the bottom. Presentation can mean a lot. Watch out for the ginger as a little goes a long way with the kids(found out once the hard way).

We love this recipe!!! Even my picky two year old has been known to eat this one.  I use ground turkey instead of beef to cut the fat.  My husband wants me to make this for his Mother...imagine that! ;)Thanks for sharing a great (and easy!)recipe!

Excellent! I haven't had meatloaf in YEARS...probable since I was little. Was even better as leftovers. I added some Jimmy Dean sausage (the kind in the tube...looks like ground beef) and this added additional flavor.

My Husband and I both loved this meatloaf. We were never crazy about meatloaf before and I gave this recipe a try. It's definitely changed our view of meatloaf for good. I wasn't sure if we would like the brown sugar in it, but it gave it a pleasurable sweet twist to meatloaf that you usually need to drown in ketchup in order to eat. Overall, very good...

The best meatloaf recipe I have.  I have made this to take to families when my mom's club delivers meals.  Always complimented.  A classic with cornbread, green beans and tomatoes, and of course, mashed potatoes.

My favorite meatloaf! I have made it for others numerous times and it always gets a hearty approval. The sauce is wonderful. Makes excellent cold meatloaf sandwiches! - if there is any leftover.

Everytime I attempted to make meatloaf it always came out soggy. I decided to give it one last shot and this turned out great! My husband (who is very picky about how he likes his meatloaf) loved it. I won't use another recipe again!

I made this for my family last night and everyone loved it.  The brown sugar and ketchup really make it scrumptious!
We all picked at the cold leftovers, too.

My husband and I really loved this meatloaf recipe.  I have tried many, usually making it up as I go along.  This was so good I'll actually go by the recipe each time I make it now.

FABULOUS.  I had finally decided that meatloaf was just nothing to get excited about.  I have several good meatloaf recipes but no one is ever really looking forward to it.  What a fun change this recipe is.  The kids all liked it and ate very well.  (Ages 14, 6, 2, and 1)  Will definitely be making this, my new favorite meatloaf recipe, again.  THANKS!

This was the best meatloaf.  Even my picky 8 year old loved it!!  I also divided the ketchup and brown sugar and put half on bottom and half on top. I'll definitely make again.

The best meatloaf I have ever tasted.  Even better than Moms!!!  I did not have milk so I used beef broth.  My husband and I finished a serving of 7 by ourselves.  It was that good!

This is a great recipe! My family just loves it!
I had to change it a little bit because I was out of crackers. I added an everthing bagel instead to replace the crackers and that gave a great zing to an already great recipe! Thanks!

This is a DEFINITE keeper. So delicious and wonderful texture. It is a litte sweet (and I have a sweet tooth). I didn't even use the full amount of brown sugar. I took a touch out. So some of you may want to cut the brown sugar in half. 

I really enjoyed the flavor of this recipe. The use of ginger is unique, but it's not an ingredient you can readily identify. I think that maybe using the saltine crackers adds a special flavor that you can't get with the use of plain bread crumbs. 

My husband LOVED this recipe and I'm pretty sure we'll be making it again. Thank you.

This was really easy and kind of fun to make!  I halved the sugar, mixed it with the ketchup, and poured it on the top as well as on the bottom of the pan.  I used a meatloaf pan that drains the liquid, and I put the whole thing in my toaster oven.  I cooked it for 1 hour and 15 minutes.  The top burned a little bit, but it still turned out great!  Next time I'll use the regular oven.  My boyfriend and I enjoyed this recipe very much.  Thank you!

If this recipe were a movie, Siskel & Ebert would give it two thumbs up, a high five and a pat on the back! My boyfriend and I devoured the meatloaf in one weekend. We added a teaspoon of garlic powder for an extra kick, but really this recipe stands all by itself! Well done and thanks!

Okay, this is THE best recipe I have gotten so far from this website.  It was sweet and juicy and simply DELICIOUS!  And, I've never made meatloaf before but this was so easy.  My husband who hated meatloaf actually enjoyed it, and my picky son cleaned his plate!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good.  The ketchup and brown sugar glaze was a little messy...but had a great flavor. I used Stove Top cornbread stuffing instead of crackers and baked for 1 hour and 10 minutes.  I served with garlic mashed potatoes! Yum! I'll definitely make this one again!

This was the first time I made meatloaf, and everyone loved it!  My family was skeptical about the brown sugar in the recipe, but the sweetness it added really went with the other ingredients.  I'm going to use this recipe whenever I make meatloaf from now on.  I'm already craving it again!

Was not very flavorful.  Didn't care for the super sweetness of the brown sugar.

POSTSCRIPT:  I ate the leftover meatloaf and it was very good.  Next time I'll make it in advance and then just eat it as leftovers.

The meat part was good but the brown sugar and ketchup sauce was way too sweet. I usually use brown sugar and ketchup for my topping but not as much. Hubby didnt care for it because of the sweetness. I will make this again but with only a small amount of brown sugar.

I threw away my old meat loaf recipe! This one is great!  I have been searching for a meatloaf recipe to rival one a local restaurant makes. Their "grilled meatloaf" is very similar to this recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

Very tasty and easy meatloaf.  It was only the second meatloaf I have ever made, and it generated a huge amount of liquid which needed to be drained before serving.  Otherwise, absolutely wonderful - my picky husband loved it, as well!

This was a delicious meatloaf that even my husband liked-- and he usually hates meatloaf!  I used 93/7 lean ground beef and skim milk, and it was still very moist and flavorful.  I thought I used a small onion, but next time I won't use quite so much-- maybe half.  I will definitely make this again!  Thanks!

I was a bit skeptical of this recipe at first glance, but am glad that I gave it a try. I omitted the onion & added a tsp of onion powder instead. My picky kids and husband thought this was wonderful. Thanks for a great recipe!

I'm usually not a fan of meatloaf, however my wife insisted making it.  To my suprise it was delicious.  She slightly changed the recipe by using oatmeal instead of crackers and sauteed garlic with the onions and ginger.  It turned out really good.  We plan on using the leftovers for meatloaf sandwhiches.

This is absolutely the BEST meatloaf I have ever had.  The brown sugar and ketchup make a great glaze (it was even great as a gravy for the mashed potaotes)  This recipe is a definite keeper.  Thanks!

I tried this twice. The first time it was good but the brown sugar burnt on the bottom. So the second time I the b. sugar and ketchup into the meat mixture. I also used bread cubes instead of crackers. Then I mixed some ketchup, mustard, and brown sugar and coated the top of the loaf. I also added some mozzarella layers.

At first, after reading this recipe, I was a bit concerned about it being too sweet. I followed the recipe exactly except I used all the meat I had defrosted (3 lbs) And seriously, while it tasted wonderful, I think following the recipe to the letter would have made for a more flavorful, and not too sweet creation. My horribly picky new hubby loved it! (Finally!)

This was a very good meatloaf.  I had never tried using brown sugar, and I was pleasantly surprised.  On a scale of 1-10, hubby rated it an 8.  I guess I'll keep looking for that 'perfect' recipe, although I will keep this one too.

Ok I have to admit I made quite a few changes to this but is was outragously wonderful!  I used Jack Daniels BBQ sauce instead of ketchup (did not have any) I also used Minute Rice instead of crackers...same reason...  In addition I added 1TBSP chopped garlic, 1/4 cup bacon bits and 1TSP Oregano.  I always add 1/2 can of cheddar cheese soup the the mixture and the other 1/2 can to the top.  (family recipe) you can omit the milk if you add the cheese soup!

This meatloaf was way too sweet.  Also, using a whole onion is overkill.  Maybe use less sugar and onion soup packet instead?  I probably wouldn't make this meatloaf again.

I've made this recipe half a dozen times and everyone has loved it.  The sauce is the difference (so you may want to increase the ketchup and brown sugar), producing a rich moist meatloaf.

A wonderful meatloaf. I substituted Italian bread crumbs for the crackers. I also mixed up some ketchup and brown sugar to put on top of the meatloaf the last 20 minutes of baking. Fabulous!

This has become a family favorite and is frequently requested. The only modification I make is to add cheesy style crackers rather than just saltines.

This really is a wonderful meatloaf.  My husband has been begging me to make meatloaf for 7 years, and this is the first one I've ever made and he LOVED it!
I did make a few changes -- I used half Italian sausage and half ground beef, substituted seasoned bread crumbs for the saltines, and added 3 slices of bacon on top of the meatloaf.
But definitely a recipe I will make again!  :-)

This was very delicious, and yes, it is sweet.  I am going to invert the meatloaf onto a platter next time I make this.
Husband liked it too, but now he says he will not know what to expect when I say "meatloaf for dinner"!  He was surprised by the sweetness!

I am not a meat loaf fan - but I am now!!!  I have only made meat loaf a couple of times and it turned out dry and not very flavorful - the kind of meat loaf that you have to pour a gallon of ketchup on in order to eat.  This is not one of those recipes.  I ate every morsel on my plate without dipping it into some sort of sauce.  My husband even said it was the best he's ever had!  It was so moist and tasty and very easy to make.

I have never cooked meatloaf before. I have never liked meatloaf before. My boyfriend begged me to make him this dish and I found this recipe, cooked it up and was so surprised by the great flavor. It was so easy to put together, we both had 2nds and I highly recomend this to anyone. I added tomatoe sauce to the meat mixture, as well 
as well as 1 tsp. worcester sauce, and omitted the ginger, on advice from some other reviewers. 
I also used breadcrumbs instead of the crackers. Perfection!!

*Really* sweet. I prefer a spicier meatloaf: I would make the sauce part again, but with my own meatloaf recipe, to balance the sweetness. ~~UPDATE~~I tried the sauce with my own meatloaf, using 1/4 cup brown sugar. It was still too sweet for us.

Very tasty!  My husband and son loved it, and so did I.  I left out the ginger, added some garlic and Worchestershire sauce.  I used Progresso dried bread crumbs because I didn't have the saltines.  My husband commented that the meatloaf was a little on the sweet side, but that's what keeps you coming back for more!  Thanks

I reduced the amount of brown sugar the second time that I made it and it made it a bit less sweet.  I also added a teaspoon of worcestershire sauce.  This recipe is awesome!! And it makes wonderful leftovers as well.

This was an awesome meatloaf. I thought I was doing something wrong it was so easy. The only thing I added was a little granulated garlic and I cut back on the salt as I thought it would get enough from the crackers. I love meatloaf and have tried to find the perfect one and I think this is it.

Absolutely fabulous!  I always wanted to make a "brown sugar meatloaf" ever since it was mentioned by Meryl Streep's character in Bridges of Madison County.  The consistency of the loaf, the sweetness of the glaze-heavenly.  Not much left over for sandwiches!!!

I am a beginner at cooking and have to have a recipe to follow.  This was a great recipe for me because I have never made meatloaf before.  It was super easy and really delicious.  The only thing I changed was I used a hotsauce ketchup mixture(because that is what I had instead of plain ketchup) and it was awesome, turned out perfect.  I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did.

Found this one based on everyone's reviews and I have to agree with the bunch...  This is a great recipe!!!  Very moist and I love the sweet glaze created when it's done.  I've never had meatloaf like this before, and my Mother the cook has even asked for the recipe!  Thank you!!!

I am usually not a big meatloaf fan, but this recipe was great.  I was a little skeptical about the brown sugar, but the sugar and ginger add a nice twist.  It didn't take much time to prepare and ingredients are such that they're ususally on hand. Overall, a big hit in my opinion.

This was a yummy, easy meatloaf. I took the meatloaf out of the loaf pan after it was done, and was really nice looking with the ketchup/brown sugar mixture cooked into it. It also made into great meatloaf sandwiches the next day. (I did use a bit narrower loaf pan than called for).

I made my wife make this for me, she does no cooking.  It turned out GREAT.  One of my kids thought it was too sweet.  The other one grabbed it off her plate and devoured it. Have already passed to to several others looking for a good meat loaf recipe.

This meatloaf is now a favorite in my house.  My family begs me to make it at least once a week.  It is so good, I even like it, which is strange because I always hated meatloaf.  This is by far one of my favorite recipes.

I don't know what to think about this. I dont have much of a sweet tooth. My husband loved it. The sauce was really good on top of green beans. My husband said he definitely wants me to make it again, but he does not want me to scratch my normal recipe either. Two different tastes of meatloaves. If you like sweet things, then you will probably love this.

Very tasty!  I made a few variations.  I used crushed Cheese Nips and about 1 tablespoon of the "fresh" ginger that comes in the little bottles.  I also added two cloves of garlic because we just can't eat any sort of meat at my house without garlic!  It was so flavorful and moist.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I was really diappointed in this recipe. It sounded wonderful and tasty. My family didn't care much for it.  The part of the loaf near the ketchup/brown sugar was tasty, but once you got away from that "crust" we thought it was rather bland.  Not one I would make again.

I found this a little dry but I like really saucy things.  The topping was tasty, though.  My picky husband who usually doesn't like meatloaf enjoyed it.  Next time I might mix the brown sugar and double the catsup and mix it with the hamburger mixture.

This is a great and easy recipe!This is a great and easy recipe!This is a great and easy recipe!
I used Turkey Ground instead of beef and didn't have Saltines so I used italian style breadcrumbs(same amount).  This was an outstanding recipe!!!  I don't think I'll ever use my old recipe again!!  Next time I am going to make a little more of the sugar and ketchup sauce to spread over when it's done.  My whole family even my 21 month old daughter loved it!  Thank you!!!!

Only change was that I used ground turkey instead of beef.  My son said it was the best meatloaf he’s ever had in his life.  I would agree.  Thanks for this awesome recipe!

I sliced some sweet potatoes and red potatoes into thin wedges, mixed them with olive oil and ‘whatever ‘spices’, then popped them in the oven while the meatloaf had 40 minutes remaining.

This meatloaf recipe was fantastic.  I made it with venison and doubled ( to use on the side )the ketchup mixture and added 1 tb of Worcestershire sauce,   Added garlic, used onion soup mixture instead of an onion to the meat mixture.  Placed two pieces of bread in the bottom of  pan to  absorb the grease from meat.  Will definitely make again.

This was good - put slices of bread on the bottom of the loaf pan per another reviewer.  Added the sauce about halfway through the baking.  Was good.

This is a great recipe with a savory twist on classic meatloaf! Like many others, I made some adjustments to the recipe including less milk (1/2 cup), less brown sugar (1/4 cup and I could have honestly gotten by with even less), less eggs (1 egg) and added 3 stalks of chopped celery and 2 cloves of minced garlic. I also made cupcake/muffin sized loaves and baked them in a cupcake pan for 50 minutes. Prior to baking, I generously glazed the tops with ketchup and brown sugar. It made 15 baby loaves for me which was a week and a half’s worth of lunches!!! Great deal if you ask me ;) lastly, I didn’t have any crackers or bread crumbs but had some old textured vegetable protein. It worked without a problem.

I do think that it is a good recipe but it could use some more in the meatloaf like soy sauce and some veggies. I have also use bread crumbs  mixed in the meatloaf.  I think it will taste fine but just ketchup on the top of the meatloaf is not fancy to me I would  like to put more taste in the topping of the ketchup o top of the meatloaf where is the recipe for that on the meatloaf. Thanks though it is a okay recipe.

Read all the reviews and followed many of the same changes , which makes this recipe 5 star! Mix the ketchup and brown sugar together with a dash of Worcestershire sauce and placed on the top of the meatloaf. Use onion soup mix instead of raw onion. Added Worcestershire sauce and garlic to the meatloaf mixture. Lower the brown sugar to 1/3 cup. Lowered the milk to 1/4 cup. Used italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of cracker crumbs. AND I cooked it 1 1/2 hours.

This is the only meatloaf I or my husband will eat. All others pale in comparison. We usually make them in muffin tins so that they are portion controlled and cook faster. I usually cool them for about 25 minutes and browned on top. Another change I made us that I do the ketchup and brown sugar in top instead of on bottom, which just makes cleanup easier and usually gets a bit crunchy.

This is a great meatloaf. We followed the advice of some reviewers and put the ketchup sauce on top. Delicious!

This was certainly a pleasant surprise. I couldn't understand how the sugar and ketchup worked on the bottom but hey, I just flipped it bottom side up on the serving plate and the juices ----yummm. This is a KEEPER!

I didn't have time to cut up fresh onion so I used minced onion flakes.  It was quite tasty but didn't have a crispy bottom as I expected. The ketchup and brown sugar mixed together nicely to give it a good taste without being too sweet.

My family of four absolutely devoured this recipe. Followed as written except used onion soup mix instead of onion and reduced the salt because my husband doesn't like the texture of chopped onions.

So you know a good recipe when you do something wrong and it still tastes amazing.  Not sure what I did but mine turned out nothing like the picture.  But the taste was amazing.  Juicy full of flavor.  One of the best meatloaf recipes I have ever tried....

So I started this recipe after reading a lot of the reviews and honestly, following the recipe the way it’s written I thought it came out AMAZING. The only thing I did differently was sauté the onions in butter before adding them, but that’s because I’m not the biggest fan of onions and wanted to make sure they were completely cooked! A lot of the reviews mentioned that the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom didn’t come out when you cut a piece out, while this was true I found that if you spooned the juice out at the end and drizzled it over the top that the result was just as good. This was my first time making meatloaf and I will never use another recipe!

This is absolutely the best meatloaf I have ever made or eaten  The genius of putting the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom is that it permeates through the meatloaf as it cooks leaving the entire dish perfect.  I have made it three or four times and get raves each time.

My husband loved it. I only had 1# of ground beef (very lean), so I decreased the amount of all ingredients: 1/3 c. brown sugar, 1 egg, 1/3 chopped onion, etc. I mixed the brown sugar & ketchup together and put half on the bottom, half on top...plus a little more that I served on the side. Also, I used bread crumbs instead of crackers, and I added a little Worcestershire and a pinch of garlic salt to the meat mixture. It smells SO good when cooking! I served it w mashed potatoes and green peas. Delicious, and perfect for a “meat &  potatoes” kind of guy. I was able to save just enough meat loaf to make a sandwich for my lunch tomorrow. Yummy!!

Was to sweet. The brown sugar and ketchup was overbearingly sweet. Threw out half of it. Even the dogs didn’t like it. Plus it soaked up the grease on the bottom of the loaf. Will try again with little to no sugar and use BBQ sauce instead of the ketchup. Pour the grease off after removing from oven.

I used lean ground beef and the grease from the meat mixed with the  sugar/ketchup  mixture at the bottom to make a soup. I had to pour it out and the sauce went with it. Will not make this again.

Our family loved it. In fact we are having it again tonight. However, no one liked the fact that the onions were still crunchy and I had to bake it for an additional 15 minutes.  We do live at high altitude so that could be why. Tonight, we are sauteing the onions 1st and cooking it for 1.25 hours.  Yummy!

This is my absolute go to meatloaf recipe. It’s delicious every time and smells like heaven while it’s cooking.The only changes I make is to use a ground beef and ground pork mixture instead of all beef. I also use Ritz crackers instead of saltines. Lastly, like many other reviewers, I do not put the brown sugar and catchup on the bottom, but instead put it on the top where it makes the most sense.

I made the recipe and followed the directions of other 5 star ratings. Definitely put the brown sugar and ketchup on top for more flavor. This is one of my favorite meals my mom used to make for me, and I got to taste a bit of home when I made this meatloaf myself! :)

It was good, but not the best meatloaf. For starters, the mixture was too runny before cooking. It might be wise to add less milk, eggs, or maybe more cracker crumbs? Secondly, I didn't really appreciate the ketchup/brown sugar placed on bottom of the pan. In my opinion, these two ingredients are some of the best parts of a good meatloaf, yet they get washed away by the juices that are produced during cooking and become relatively insignificant in the dish. I'd advise to put the brown sugar/ketchup mixture on top of the loaf itself. Finally, I thought the loaf had just a bit too many onions in it (and I'm an onion fanatic!), so this was somewhat of a turn off for some of the more picky eaters in my family who don't care as much for onions as I do. Overall, the loaf was moist, flavorful, and simple, but I would just change the recipe a tad.

Magnificent :)

I just made it for the first time; I'll probably do it with a little less brown sugar in the future, but this is going to be my go-to meatloaf.

The ginger and brown sugar complement one another perfectly.

Great starter recipe. My tweaks were adding 1/4 c green pepper, 1 1/2. Tbsp garlic powder, 1 tbsp  worcestshire sauce, and using garlic bread crumbs instead of crackers. I also put the glaze on top during the last 15 minutes. I added a tbsp of yellow mustard and garlic powder to the glaze. ( I am a garlic - oholic) lol  yummy!

my family loves this, it's our go-to meatloaf recipe. Instead of saltines I use club crackers, and after it's done baking I flip it upside down in a casserole dish so that the ketchup/brown sugar is on the top.

I made this a few times already and it's delicious. I add sweet peppers to the meat and steak sauce to ketchup mix.

I removed all my other recipes.  This is the only one I will use from now on for meatloaf.  The changes I made were to put the glaze mixture on top.  I also put the bread on the bottom to collect the grease.  I think it worked pretty good, but we did not take out the meatloaf to remove the bread.  It looked pretty disgusting, so next time we will definitely remove the meatloaf to a platter and remove the bread.  Thank you for this good recipe.

Cooking for 1, I cut the ingredients in half, except used a 1 lb. roll of ground beef. Left cook time of 1 hour, though. Turned out used too much brown sugar, and had difficulty with egg, but was still great tasting.

Great recipe! Only chances I made were to add some bell peppers to mine because I hadn’t some to n hand and hubby likes them a lot.  I also lined my dish with aluminum foil for easier clean up.  I put some fresh garlic in mine also.  Put the ketchup mixture on top and bottom and also put some wright brand bacon on top.   The recipe is a keeper !

The meatloaf was so yummy, but I would reduce the amount of brown sugar by double. The ketchup \brown sugar sauce was way way too sweet. I will totally keep this recipe on hand

I love this recipe. I use turkey ground meat instead of beef.  I add a packet of Lipton Savory Herb with Garlic soup in the mixture.  It is so flavorful with this added ingredient.   I cant see myself making the meatloaf without it.  After the meatloaf is done I flip it over so the brown sugar and ketchup mixture is on top.  Try it!

Been making meatloaf this way for years.. What I do is mix the ketchup with brown suger and lay on bottom of the pan save enough to put a little on top. Cook at resturant and this would sell out with baked beans and mash tators!!! We went to large muffin pan worked amazing !!!!

This recipe is wonderful. I mixed the brown sugar and ketchup. Put half of the mixture in the bottom of the pan and the rest on top of the meat before cooking. The family loves it. I also stuffed bell peppers and that turned out wonderful.

I used 2 pounds of a beef/pork blend. I also increased the amount of seasoning due to the extra meat. I added 2 tbsp of Country Bob’s steak sauce and 1 cup of oatmeal to hold it together. It was the first time I’ve been able to make a meat loaf that had both great flavor and texture! I’m definitely making this again!

Loved it! Did added a tablespoon of worcesteshire sauce and the same amount of salt i added for the ginger and black pepper. Took out the onion for my son and divided the ketchup and sugar mixture for some on the bottom and the rest on top. And used aluminum foil for easy clean up and sprayed it with oil spray. Turned out amazing my husband and son left plate clean.

Make sure to drain and if you add any sauce at the top make sure it is in mediation - this is a smaller serving.  I would have had to make two loaves to feed all my boys.  The ones who ate it loved it.

Delicious!! I bought the wrong loaf pans so didn’t do it upside down but it was still delicious. I covered with aluminum foil to keep from cooking the top too hard.

Usually not a big meatloaf fan. But found this recipe and decided to try it.  It was really good. My family actually ate it too and complimented it.  I  did put the brown sugar and ketchup on the top and it caramelized .  It was really good!

Perfect!!! Added WAY less brown sugar and more ketchup and spices, and used 1/2 cup of milk and two eggs. Baked in a muffin tin for 30 and brushed with brown sugar ketchup mix and then baked for another 15 and it was PERFECT

I tried this because I had all the ingredients to make a meatloaf excluding breadcrumbs but a horde of saltine crackers. I am now known in my family for my meatloaf, and I mist say that it tastes amazing. I have tried it with ground Turkey, as my family is on a slightly restricted diet, and it tasted alright. Best taste is with the beef.

There is no reason to use both eggs one works fine. If you use two non egg lovers will tell and not like. Plus top with bacon. Delicious.

I made enough for 6 servings (1 1/4 lbs. lean ground beef).  I, however, made enough sauce for the recipe as originally written.  I read reviews and elected to amp up the sauce with mustard (prepared and dry), worcestshire sauce, etc.  I also used some of that sauce to stir into the onions I elected to cook on the stovetop prior to incorporating it into the loaf.  I made my own bread crumbs with 5 day old italian bread dried out in the oven.  I cooked the loaf to an internal temp of 165-166 then let the carryover cooking finish it off. I elected to put the sauce on the bottom of the meatloaf pan and then put sauce on the top about 40 minutes in.  No need for extra sauce to drizzle over sliced meatloaf at all.  Moist and so flavorful.

I love this recipe.  It's the only meatloaf I ever make cause my kids like it so why change?  I would be careful with the ginger, I added way too much one time and in my opinion it ruined it, but no one else seemed to notice.  sometimes I throw in some chopped peppers.  tonight I added parsley and garlic.

My first time making a meatloaf of any kind. I was skeptical of the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom of the dish but holy cow was it good. 10/10 would make again, thank you.

I made the meatloaf exactly as the recipe suggests, however I mixed the brown sugar and ketchup together and spread it on top of the loaf, because I didn't want it mixed in with the grease that always collects in the bottom of the pan.  It was delicious!  Everyone in my house loved it and we'll definitely make it again.

Easy.  Put the Brown sugar mixture on top.  Use two slices of bread underneath the meatloaf to catch the grease. I also added garlic to the mix.

I used Panko instead of crackers because I had it on hand, and I put the sugar and ketchup on the top instead of the bottom. I absolutely loved it! When I made the leftovers I used some of the fat to sauté it up and it was very moist and yummy! I will make this many more times!

So good!  Instead of saltines I used breadcrumbs and added garlic powder.  I put worchestershire sauce in the ketchup/brown sugar and used 1/4 cup brown sugar.  When baking I put the ketchup/brown sugar/worchestershire sauce on top.  I will definitely make this again!

this was an easy and tasty recipe. Only modifications where frying the onions before mixing in with the meat & covering with foil while baking (kept in moisture since there was no "toppings"). Next time I'll add ketchup to the top of the meatloaf in addition to just the bottom.

I have made this recipe many times since everyone in my family loves it. And that’s rare to find something that everyone enjoys. I use 1/2 cup milk, I leave out the ginger, I use 1 row of saltine crackers so I don’t have to measure them. And the one thing I haven’t heard mentioned in other reviews is the use of a silicone pan—mine is red and I just love it. The meatloaf doesn’t stick to the pan and the edges do not get over done. I even carefully cut the meatloaf in the pan.  I also use this pan for banana bread. Give it a try if you haven’t already.

Family favorite.  Made it over a dozen times.  I make as written with the exception that my local supermarket offers a 'meatloaf' blend containing of beef/pork/veal rather than just ground beef.

My husband loved it, and so did I!  Will make it again.  With a baked potato and a salad you've got the perfect comfort meal.  Per some other commenters I added some diced garlic to the meat, and a tablespoon of Worchestershire sauce to the catsup.  Also used 1/4 cup of brown sugar, not 1/2.

Wow, so yummy!  I, like most folks, added a couple things after reviewing other reviews.  I added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to the sugar mixture.  I also used a half cup of sour cream instead of milk.  And I added some minced garlic and celery.  Delicious!

I have probably made this recipe 50 times over the last 5 years. It is my go-to recipe for meatloaf, and if I don't have saltine crackers, I usually substitute bread crumbs or oatmeal- it has still turned out great! Have also substituted barbecue sauce for the ketchup- but the key is to keep it on the bottom of the bread pan and use the brown sugar. I have 6 kids, and they all devour this. I usually have to make 2 pans at a time. I have also used ground turkey when I don't have enough ground beef on hand, or have mixed turkey and beef, but personally I prefer beef, although the turkey turns out okay. This is one of our family's favorites!

The reason the ketchup and brown sugar are on the bottom is so you can turn the meatloaf out and the mixture will be on top.  Someone needs to address this in the recipe.  It is best to let the meatloaf sit for at least 15-20 mins for juices to return, then turn out.  I personally think it works better putting the topping on top like the others.  I thought it was a great idea in concept but did not look as good as topping out the other way. But the taste was really good!

I use Keebler Club House crackers and I add additional seasoning to my meat (onion powder, garlic powder).  

My kids love the sauce so I will make extra on the stove top (1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 ketchup) and place on the top of the meatloaf once they cut their slices. 

This is a great recipe!

This was really good, and my BF said it was hands down the best meatloaf he's ever had.  I did make a couple simple changes to the recipe; first, I used garlic powder instead of ginger, and second, I added the brown sugar and ketchup to the top of the loaf.  Adding it to the top of the loaf created a nice "crust" of flavor.  So yummy!

I went ahead and used the whole 2 pound package of ground beef, added a little oatmeal, and baked it in a 9 x 13 inch pan so it would be done quicker.  Everyone liked it and I even had a request for the recipe.

Very good meat loaf, I like it just as it is but hubby thinks it’s too sweet with the brown sugar and ketchup.  I cook for large groups of people from time to time and I make this meat loaf as is and a different one for those who do t care for the sweetness.  I also put the ketchup and brown sugar on top of the meatloaf.

I'm really not a big meatloaf fan (as a result of growing up with dry, bland meatloaf).  But a friend requested meatloaf as his  comfort meal when going through a tough time so I made this with all the comfort food fixins and he plowed through it!  I really liked it as well - love the interplay of flavors.  I will say I tried the bread thing on the bottom and I didn't feel it work - next time (yes! there will be a next time) I make it I will just use a turkey baster to remove excess oil.
Thanks to original poster!!

Made this 3 times now. It’s excellent! I only use 1 lb ground beef and adjust ingredients accordingly. I do decrease the amount of milk and brown sugar. I also mix half of the glaze in with the meat and put the other half on top. Bake to temp. Delicious!

Very Yummy! I was intrigued by the ginger ingredient and decided to try. Delicious! The ginger was very subtle and gave the loaf a nice twist.  I did like most and put the brown sugar and then ketchup on top.  Did not want the flavor to be lost in the grease.  The other change is I used townhouse club crackers as I did not have soda crackers on hand.  This was a 5 star for me and am looking forward to the meatloaf sandwiches in my near future!

I made it this evening. I did do two slight changes. I put the ketchup and brown sugar on top vs the bottom in the pan and the crushed ritz crackers and used those vs saltines. My son said it was the best meatloaf I’ve ever made!! Next time I will use less onions as there were too many onions for me.

I made a few adjustments...1/4 c brown sugar, a splash of Worcestershire, garlic about 4 cloves, garlic breadcrumbs, almond milk, 2 T. of minced ginger, used 2 slices of bread on bottom of the loaf pan to soak up the grease.  I also used the meat thermometer to 160* which was sooner than cooking directions  I was feeding 10 people and all of them wanted my recipe.

I will make this my forever meatloaf recipe! So amazingly moist, and delicious. I didn’t chance a thing besides put a little brown sugar and ketchup/bbq mix on top the last 15 or so minutes. Thankyou for this recipe, my husband and I LOVED IT !

I made this exactly as the recipe very disappointed took over 2 hours to cook. I should have read the reviews and did adjustments. I would recommend not using a loaf pan, cut the milk in half and only 1 egg. I will probably try this again but making my own tweaks to it, but sadly this original recipe needs to be corrected.

Personally it was a bit too sweet. Next time I will probably use less brown sugar and ketchup. I also took the recommendations of putting the brown sugar and ketchup on top of the meat loaf in a casserole dish. I mixed the brown sugar and ketchup together as well before putting on the top. Other than using less brown sugar, this was really good! And pretty simple to make.

This recipe is great!  I do either ground turkey or ground beef,  saltines or breadcrumbs, and I do Tony Chacheres instead of salt and pepper when I make it. I have made multiple times, sticking to the recipe.  You have to bake uncovered and after cool down you can flip it over.  I usually cut in pieces,  flip with spatula into a container and spread the left over topping on the left over pieces.  I have not experienced mush.  I had my son,  who was 15 at the time,  make it by himself and it still came out perfect.  Don't know why some people are having issues.  This recipe always serves me good.

This is a really good and easy recipe to make. I was kind of thrown off by the name brown sugar meatloaf cause I thought that you put it in the actual meatloaf but it’s in the sauce which I’ve always made it that way. Family really enjoyed the reactor, thanks!

Awesome meatloaf, I added Garlic Butter Ritz instead of Saltines, a package of onion soup mix instead of minced onions but I have to say the the Brown Sugar and Ketchup sauce makes the Meatloaf.  It’s definately a keeper.

I just made this and actually thought it was really good, I made a few adjustments like others suggested, decreased the brown sugar to 1/3 cup, mixed it with the ketchup and put on top. Someone recommended bread layered on the bottom of the pan, perfect idea, it soaked up most of the oil. I also added onion soup mix in place of the onions and thought it flavored it nicely. Will make again.

Gave it 4 stars because I had to modify it based on reviews I read.  I added 2 slices of bread to the bottom of the pan to absorb the grease;  cut the milk portion to 1/4 cup; cut the brown sugar portion to 1/4 cup; added about 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to the ketchup/brown sugar.   This was DELICIOUS!  My husband who never eats leftovers (and is a super picky eater) ate this the next day and loved it.  Will definitely be making this again.

Best meatloaf ever!
Not a meatloaf fan but tried it after reading reviews. Awesome!
I only used 1 lb ground beef and changed portions accordingly. Also used the glaze on top rather than the bottom. I sauted onions and added garlic to the mixture. And a splash of worchestershire and prepared mustard to the glaze. It wasn't very glazey but the entire meatloaf was packed full of flavor!

Great meatloaf recipe. Very flavorful. I did as other reviewers said and decided to put the topping of brown sugar and ketchup on the top of the loaf instead of the bottom of the loaf pan-turned out great and the ketchup brown sugar mix made a prefect glaze over the top of the meatloaf! Highly recommend this recipe!

Did not change anything and it turned out absolutely delicious! The brown sugar mix at the bottom of the loaf makes it!  This is the recipe I will use from now on.

This recipe turned out amazing!  The only things I did differently was I didn't add ginger and I mixed the ketchup and brown sugar together and put it on the top of the meat loafs. I made two instead of one big one. I served it with rice and green beans! So yummy!

I made the brown sugar meatloaf and it was delicious. I made it upside down, with brown sugar and catch up on top. My family loved it. I will make this again, a new twist to a Family favorite.

i didn't have saltines so I substituted panko bread crumbs. mine turned out very good. i covered with foil when baking so it was a little too juicy. I don't think I would cover it again as it also took longer than an hour to cook . loved the flavor and will definitely do again.

I do not like meatloaf, but my husband does. So occasionally I will make it for him and gag on every bite. I've tried several different recipes and still didn't like it. I came across this recipe and I am surprised to say that I LOVE IT! It is the best meatloaf recipe that I've have ever made. I followed some of the other reviews and put the sauce on the top and added Worcestershire sauce. My husband is happy to report that I will be making meatloaf more often thanks to this recipe.

Cooked easily and well! Not particularly flavorful, but I added rosemary, thyme, and some basil leaves and it was much improved! Not at all time fav but definitely a comforting one-time dish!

I made this the first time to the T! It is delicious as is! I’m thankful for this recipe as a starter as well! The next few times I made this, I mixed in onions and bell peppers, golden onion dry soup mix, Italian seasoning, and homemade breadcrumbs. I omitted the egg always because we have an egg allergy in the house. The breadcrumbs do the job just perfectly!

Awesome every time I make this meatloaf. I prefer the brown sugar glaze on the top of the meatloaf too. I like to slowly add the milk so the mix doesn't get soupy.  A casserole dish works perfect so the loaf can cook on all sides without all the grease. I like to use a mix of beef & pork.  This dinner pairs well with some fresh green beans & mashed potatoes. Yum!!

What a really delicious meatloaf.  I took notes from everyone’s reviews and ended up using the onion soup mix instead of the onion and I added minced garlic as well. I substituted the crackers for Italian bread crumbs. I also added the ketchup and brown sugar mix on the top of the loaf not the bottom.  I would definitely make this one again.  Yummy.

1. Use the brown sugar and ketchup as a GLAZE instead of putting them on the bottom. 
 2. For the meatloaf mixture, use 1/2 cup of milk instead of 3/4 cup, and use 1 egg instead of 2. Also add in 2 cloves of minced garlic.

 3. Use a 9x9 casserole dish (or bigger) instead of a loaf pan. Form the meatloaf so that there is at least 1/2 inch of space on all sides. Not only does this allow the glaze to be applied all around the meatloaf, but it also makes draining the excess juices easier.

 4. After 30 minutes of cooking (halfway through), drain excess juices, let it finish cooking, then drain again if need be.

I mix the sugar (I use less sugar) and breadcrumbs in the meat mix and cover with a little of sweet baby ray before putting it in the oven.  I process the fresh onion in a blender. Double the batch as it freezes and reheats wonderfully for another meal!

I LOVE THIS RECIPE! I probably make it once a month! My kids ask for it all the time. I have six kids (five growing boys) so I actually triple/quadruple the recipe because they want leftovers! LOL!! I use ground turkey and meatloaf mix instead of straight beef and I use two to three 9x13 baking dishes. I have never put the ketchup and brown sugar on the bottom; I put it on the top. The ketchup and brown sugar flavor will run through the entire meatloaf!!

Best meatloaf ever! Very easy to make and comes out with spectacular flavors! I actually doubled the recipe, added splashes of Worchestershire sauce to meat, used Italian style bread crumbs, Lipton Onion Mix and poured ketchup/brown sugar mix on top.  I personally like to cut the meatloaf into slices after an hour of cooking and then add another 15 minutes to brown a bit more. If you haven't tried it, I highly recommend it.

I used this meatloaf recipe as part of a cooking lesson for my grandkids.  They followed the recipe exactly.  It turned out delicious with no changes needed.  Best meat loaf I have had in a long time.

Absolutely love it!  I modified it to make a healthier and less greasy meal.  I did this by using ground turkey in place of the beef, 1/4 c. cracker crumbs and a little bit less milk ( about 1/3 c.).  I also added about 1 t. of garlic.  Best part about using the turkey is that you can then use the non greasy drippings as gravy on mashed potatoes.  I love this recipe, I've made it half a dozen times and it doesn't get old!

Made with beef but switched to ground turkey.  Both are great, been making for years now, but I like the texture of turkey better. I don't even measure anything anymore. Love it. I tip it over onto a cookie cooling rack to let the fat out. I eventually replaced cracker crumbs with italian bread crumbs because it's easier and more flavorful.

Amazing!!!!!!    but I do it a little different.  I mix all ingredients together.   I also add 1/2 pound of sausage and 1 pound of maple flavored bacon.   I also use ritz crackers vs saltines

Reduced milk to 1/2 cup, used 1 egg, subbed dry bread crumbs for crushed crackers, and poured the sugar/ketchup glaze over the loaf,  as others have suggested. I also tried putting two slices of bread in the bottom of the pan to absorb the grease, as another reviewer suggested. That did not work out so well for me. Don't think I'll waste my bread next time. The meatloaf itself was delicious- very moist. The glaze was a bit too sweet for my taste. I should have listened to those other reviewers who said to reduce the amount of sugar.

I've made this multiple times now and while I'm still tweaking it a little to make it my own, very flavorful and moist meatloaf.

I made some changes but didn't stray too far from the actual recipe. 

I changed the servings to 5 (it's the closest to using 1 pound of meat), so when I reference a measurement keep that in mind. 

The meat mixture used 1 lb of meat, 1/3 cup milk, 1 egg,  almost 1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs, a packet of onion soup mix, 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic (I used the stuff you buy in the little jars), and the ground ginger as directed. I tried using bread slices on the bottom of the loaf pan to soak up grease as a previous reviewer mentioned, I've never tried that before and it seemed to work with no adverse consequences, so I think I'll do that again going forward. I also use a more fatty ground beef (I think its 75/25 lean), so while I know that means more grease, I think it helps to contribute to flavor and avoids dryness.

The ketchup mixture, I feel like I dont usually have enough with what it tells me to use when adjusting servings. I make the full recipe's worth (as if I was making for 8 people). That's 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup ketchup. I add a tablespoon of Worcestershire.  Mix together and i put it on the top. 

I pair with oven roasted veggies (today was broccoli, asparagus, and sugar snap peas).

Excellent flavor, even the insanely picky 7 year old had seconds.  I can find nothing even marginal to say, the whole family raved.  This is definitely going to be a dish made again.  I’m looking forward to trying the leftovers since I was able to pour the brown sugar gravy over the remainder to soak overnight.

Yet another great review.   I left out the ginger and added diced green pepper, celery seed, and Worcestershire sauce.  Love the ketchup and brown sugar, but used it as a glaze which I slathered on the loaf the last 10 minutes of baking.  Next time, I will make a much larger loaf to have left overs for sandwiches the next day.

So good!! I also made the adjustment like so many other reviewers suggested. 1/2 cup milk. Added Worcestershire to both meat mixture and the sauce mixture. I did not use onion soup mix as I don’t have and and I believe the salt content on it is too high. I chopped up onion and lots of garlic and added a few dashes of garlic salt .... The ginger is a stand out ingredient in this recipe. It gives a wonder flavor.

I love this meatloaf. Very flavorful. Instead of putting the ketchup and brown sugar on the bottom, I put it on the top because it didn’t taste that good when having it on the bottom. I also substituted crackers with plain breadcrumbs witch taste better in my opinion. Very good recipe.

I have been struggling for years to find a meatloaf recipe that didn't fall apart out of the pan and that hubby could make sandwiches with for lunch the next day.  This was it!  Although after I put the milk in the bowl I was leery. It was really slurpy. But I used italian seasoned breadcrumbs and that seemed to firm it up.  I put the glaze on top like most everyone else did and I did not use a loaf pan but rather followed another reviewer's suggestion to use a jelly roll pan and shape it to a loaf.  Worked perfectly!  This will be my go-to meatloaf from now on.

Divine!  Not huge substitutions but: 1) onion crackers instead of saltine crackers, 2) formed a loaf on a sheet pan and brushed sauce across top. Have made this at least once a month for a few years. My kids beg for it.

Love this! Of course you can adjust ingredients as wish.  I add ketchup, garlic, worcestershire and put the brown sugar and ketchup on top and not the bottom.  My family only eats this meatloaf.  Guessing it's the sugar.

Definitely will make again!  I put enough brown sugar to just cover the bottom, but it was less than recipe.  I didn't measure ketchup, just squirted some on, less salt, about 1/2 cup onion.  It was very moist.  My oven required a little over an hour.  It was great!

I LOVE MEATLOAVES because there are so many ways to do them.  I could never stick to “just one recipe”.  That being said, this was a very easy and tasty meal.  Followed the recipe as written except that I put the glaze on top since I always use the NuWave oven for meatloaf so all the fat drips out.  It was nice and moist but rather sweet tho not unpleasant.  Not sure if I will make it again. (So many other recipes to try) but I am glad I tried it.

I happen to love this meatloaf recipe.  I usually use ground turkey instead of beef.  The crackers make a great change to the recipe, but if you don’t have any crackers, you can use breadcrumbs or I used Panko crumbs the last time I made it.  Since ground turkey usually comes in 1lb packages, i cut the ingredients just slightly.  I serve with brown sugar glazed carrots.  Yummy.

Wow... My husband and I  loved it.... He said it was the best he ever had...  I out did myself  :).. It was sweet and yummy... He definitely liked the brown sugar topping...  I added 1 Tbs of Worcestershire sauce to the ketchup and mixed them together and 1/2 cup brown sugar on the bottom. For the Meat I added 1 Tbs of Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, 1 small onion, little bit of salt, and black pepper,  2 eggs, and added 1/4 cup of milk.  Love this Meatloaf.....

Meatastic! This recipes is always a hit at my house. I add a glove of garlic to it and I put the brown sugar/ketchup combo on the top and not the bottom. I always serve with green beans and oven baked potatoes. YUM!

I liked the recipe but made some changes. I didn't have saltine crackers, so I used panko bread crumbs. Instead of using ketchup I used barbecue sauce. I mixed it with the brown sugar and brushed it on the top. It was good and I would make it again.

I made two smaller meatloaves - one going by the original recipe and one going by reviewer suggestions. Both versions tasted about the same, and neither were, in my opinion, good. The overall flavor went from grossly sweet and unbelievably bland. I will not be trying this recipe again.

Family favorite! I sauté the onions before mixing them in. Like others, I form a loaf in a casserole dish and spread the glaze on top of the loaf.

I didn't think I liked meatloaf. I was wrong. I cook this a bit longer than the recipe calls for but the first time I made no changes and it was great. Now I add dry onion soup mix to the meat with a little worchestershire. So good!

I made the meatloaf in a 13x9 pan and just formed a loaf in the middle so the fat would not pool underneath. Also I listened to the other reviewers and put the ketchup and brown sugar on top.

I've made this meatloaf exactly per the directions, many times.  It always goes over well.  I hate how messy it is, though, and trying to get the meatloaf out of the pan with the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom and all the grease was annoying.  I searched for a different recipe.  I found this one (link below), which (according to the link at the bottom of the recipe) was adapted from this recipe.  Everyone RAVED over this version.  I will add that I ran out of regular ketchup but had a bottle of Whataburger's spicy ketchup, so it was half regular, half spicy, lol .

I have never cared for Meatloaf, until this recipe.   I spoon the mixture over the Meatloaf instead.  I drain some of the juices off, after about one hour of cooking time.  I also cover the Meatloaf with tin foil and bake for 2 Hours.  It's become a huge hit in my home.  Thank you so much for this delicious recipe!!  :-)

It was a little on the sweet side for my taste but my family (kids included) loved it.  They all commented that it was their favorite of the various meatloaf dishes I have made over the years. I will definitely be making it again.

I have used this recipe a half dozen times and it seems to get better each time I make it. It is wonderful all by itself but the last couple of times I have made it I have added 1 1/2 tsp Worchestershire sauce in the brown sugar and ketchup, and I usually spread that on the top. I love the hint of ginger in this recipe. Like I said before, it is wonderful all on it's own. Thank you for sharing!

I've made this several times. The only thing I do different is I use maple syrup with the ketchup and pour it on top then bake it. So good. I made 2 batches as there are 6 of us and it is never enough. Love it.

Delicious!! - I'm gonna try this person's recommendations : " I only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar. - I added 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to the ketchup/brown sugar mix. - I used 1/2 cup of milk and 1 egg. - I added 2 cloves of garlic to the meat mixture." ...and put the glaze on the top instead of the bottom.

This is the best meatloaf recipe I've ever found! I did take the advice of another reviewer and used dried bread crumbs instead of crackers. I also substituted one-half of the ketchup with jalapeño ketchup. I'll definitely make it again!

My husband and son are not meatloaf fans so I made it for me. Excellent recipe! I made a few changes. I added 1 Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce and 1 tsp. ground mustard to the glaze and reduced the brown sugar to 1/4 cup.  To the meat mix I added 1 stalk celery and 1 bell pepper finely chopped.

This meatloaf was a huge hit with everyone in my family.  I added about a cup and a half of chopped fresh spinach to the recipe just to get some extra health into my family.  Other than that I didn't change anything.  This recipe was super easy and delicious.

I followed the recipe, except I added 2 cloves of garlic and a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce. The meatloaf was moist and flavorful. As I live alone and work all week, it was nice to have enough left over for about 5 more meals.

This recipe is easy and so yummy! I've made it in the oven and my instant pot. I will say it's rather soft and doesn't keep a loaf shape well...but I won't use another meatloaf recipe. So good!

Love this meatloaf! I used panko breadcrumbs because that is what I had at home and it still tasted great! I also put the brown sugar and catsup mixture in the bottom of the pan and on top of the meatloaf.

This was so easy and my husband loved it!  Yummy.  Then I made it again and brought it to a friend that had surgery.  Her family loved it.  This is especially good for those trying to stay away from tomato's due to inflammation.

As a vegan I loved this dish, but of course I had to change a few things. 
First, I substituted milk with  rice milk. Then I omitted the beef and did not add any substitutes.  Making it a sweet, saucy dish!

I usually don’t make meatloaf because it is always so dry but this wasn’t.  And the brown sugar really added something.  I used croutons instead of crackers

Everyone loves this.  I mean, who wouldn't?  Its steeped in brown sugar.  I use half pork, half beef.  I find that I usually have to add almost twice the amount of bread crumbs to firm it up.

I made this once and it will be the last time. The outside tasted like a barbecue sauce on it, while the inside was not as flavorful as my regular meatloaf tastes. Really, I have leftovers that I will eat, because I don't want to waste food, but I'll never prepare it again.

I was a bit skeptical but after reading all the reviews I decided to give it a go and I am so glad I did.  This meatloaf was so yummy-this will probably be my go to recipe from now on.  I did make a couple small modifications based on others' input.   First I put two slices of bread in the bottom of the pan to absorb the grease.  I also substituted Lipton Beefy Onion soup mix for the chopped onion, reduced the brown sugar and milk to 1/4 cup each, and mixed a tablespoon of Worcester sauce in with the ketchup/Brown sugar sauce.  I applied most of the sauce to the top and baked it at 350 for 55 minutes.   I then applied the rest and broiled on high for just a  couple of minutes to get the sauce to thicken and caramelize.  I served it with boxed au gratin potatoes.  It was an awesome meal of good old fashioned comfort food.  Thanks for sharing!

I swapped tomato sauce for the ketchup in this and sprinkled a little parsley on top after baking for a pop of color. Otherwise made as directed. Whole family enjoyed it.

This was a big hit with everyone. I made it once and the second time did the following which was even better. Now it's perfect. 
I added dry mustard, worcestershire  sauce, onion salt to the catsup mixture and placed half in the meatloaf and the other half on top (the last 15 minutes of baking) rather than the bottom . I also placed 2 slices of bread at the bottom to absorb the grease. I substituted bread crumbs instead of ritz crackers, and onion soup mix instead of chopped onions. I also added a handful of bacon bits, 2 cloves of garlic and only 1/4 cup milk to the mixture. Very easy to make ahead of time. I made two and froze one for another night.

This was absolutely perfectly delicious. It was honestly really easy and cutting the onion was the only thing that really took any time!!

I found this recipe on this site several years ago.  Everyone that I have made it for gives me so many compliments saying it’s the best meat loaf they’ve ever had..

My family does not need more sugar in their diet. Grandkids took one bite and stopped eating. They wanted to know if I had forgot how to cook. Try the meatloaf recipe from Marth Stewart’s mother. It’s 50% purée vegetables and the kids love it if you don’t tell them it’s good for them.

This turned out great.  We did substitute chili sauce for the ketchup and we added worchestershire.  We were doubtful it would be good, but we loved it.

I make this all the time and it turns our great!  It's my family's favorite meatloaf recipe so I don't even try to make a different one.  The only changes I make are 1) I put 2 slices of bread in the bottom of my roasting pan to soak up all the fat drainage; 2) I place the ketchup and brown sugar mixture on top of the meatloaf (I have no idea why this recipe calls for it to be in the bottom of the pan when that's where all the fat juices run) and 3) I double the ketchup and brown sugar for the top; its the best part!

5 stars with my modifications.  Took suggestions & did 1/2c milk but kept 2 eggs. The due to our family's need to be gluten-free, instead of bread crumbs I used 1/2 c crushed g-f glutino crackers and 2 rounded T g-f quick oats.  I also made the night before & was out of fresh onion so I subbed 2 rounded T dried minced onion for the fresh.  Put in an 11x7 foil-lined pan (allowing about 1/2-1 inch all the way around (can drain any pooled grease easier that way), covered w/cling wrap & put in fridge until ready to bake the next night.

I used a meatloaf pan that holds the meat off the bottom of the pan hence I topped the meatloaf with the brown sugar mixture.  It was a hit here. So good but not to sweet.  By topping the meatloaf with the brown sugar topping the flavor was all threw the meatloaf.

So good. Have made exactly as recipe states and also adding garlic and celery and using bread crumbs vs crackers. I have also followed others suggestions with milk and egg rations and with the ketchup sauce. Honestly, any way I have made this has been a winner. Its great as is but so flexible that you can personalize it to your tastes.

I follow the recipe. The beef I used was ground sirloin and as I feared the grease took off a lot of the glaze.  I will go back to putting my glaze on top.

Like many reviewers, I reduced the brown sugar to 1/4 C and added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to both sauce and meat. I did saute the onions before mixing them in and added some additional spices (thyme, paprika, garlic powder) to the mixture, used Panko. I lined the pan with foil (easy clean-up), put a slice of bread on the bottom (what a great tip!), sauce on top and baked it uncovered. It was delicious! I have been making meatloaf for 50 years and I think mine had just gotten out of hand, but the best tip was to cook it only an hour. All my life I had been cooking it for an hour and a half.

i believe the author forgot to mention it's an upside down meatloaf. I just thought, why would glaze be on bottom so I flipped it after about 5 to 10 minutes and it was great. The glaze was actually a little gooey, kinda sticky. Was very nice.

This was not terrible, but lacked flavor and easily fell apart.  I will stick to my Better Homes and Gardens recipe book recipe, which is much firmer and more flavorful.

I love meatloaf and this one was delicious.  I will make again very soon but will reduce the amount of milk and brown sugar.  I added some of the catsup mixture to the meatloaf and put the rest on top.  Smelled wonderful while cooking and tasted delicious.  I'm looking forward to a meatloaf sandwich!

Oh my goodness! I fused this recipe with another Allrecipes one for Cheeseburger (cheese filled) meatloaf and WAM! That is a winner. Followed everything else exactly from this recipe apart from the process to roll the cheese inside the loaf.

I thought the idea of putting the bread on the bottom to absorb the grease is a good idea.  The sauce on top...I mix catsup, mustard and brown sugar.  I also add diced  jalapeno peppers (the ones in a jar in vinegar) (to taste) to meat mixture, garlic powder and onion powder. I used Panko instead of crackers.  I did not use Ginger.

We really liked this meatloaf and will use it now as our basic recipe. I only changed the topping, putting it on top and added about a half tablespoon of Dijon mustard and a little Worcester.

Out of all my "lazy night" meals this is my favorite. The ingredients are so readily available at our home and it is easy to prepare when my daughter is napping and then toss it in the oven when it's time to cook. I personally double all of the seasonings because we like our food with extra flavor.

I like others made some changes instead of crackers used bread crumbs, and instead of onions used onion soup mix. Left all other ingredients the same and It turned out delicious!

Love this recipe- it's super easy and I just sub bread crumbs in for the saltines and put ketchup and brown sugar mixed and over the top of the meatloaf. The bottom does get greasy so just drain it out every so often and you should be good. If you are feeling crazy be sure to put about 4 strips of bacon over the top of the ketchup/brown sugar mixture and enjoy!!

Yum!!! I am gluten free, so I used oats instead of cracker crumbs. Delicious! I put the meat into a flat-ish log on a 9x13 inch pan, and covered it with the ketchup mixture. I also added 1 teaspoon garlic powder.

If 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire was added to both the sauce and meat mixture...I would give this a 5 Star! Also key, Combine all ingredients for the sauce together; the ketchup, brown sugar, and Worcestershire Sauce, divide it in half. Spread one half to the bottom of the loaf pan,  and the remaining to the top of the meat loaf.  I also cut 4 slits into the top of the meat to let the sauce absorb while cooking. The moistest Meat Loaf ever! Great Meatloaf Recipe with a sweet twist!  :-)

What I did was mix everything together including the brown sugar and ketchup inside the meatloaf itself. Then when there was only about 15 minutes left before it was done I placed a brown sugar ketchup glaze on the top. This is a huge hit with my family. My mother even asked for it as I Mother's Day gift this year and I made it for her.

Great recipe! Followed first reviewers changes except I doubled the recipe for 3 lbs. of meat. I then had to double the suggestions of the reviewer. Used only 2 eggs and 1 c. bread crumbs and 1 c. Milk.

This is a great recipe!  I did not make any changes this time.  Maybe next time will add small amount of red pepper flakes to the catusup.  Yum!

I know it's kind of unhealthy, but it was really savory. With copious amounts of ketchup, if I don't watch myself I'll eat too much of it!

This was really good.  I put bread on the bottom to soak up the grease, and put the ketchup/brown sugar on top instead.  I'm not really a meatloaf lover but I really enjoyed this.

This meatloaf was delicious! My boyfriend felt like eating all of it and I just followed the recipe as it is.  I let it stand for 10 minutes after bringing it out from the oven to let it set.  But it was perfect.  And do add the sauce in this recipe on the loaf, because it is delicious and gives it an extra kick.  Regarding onions, I didn't cook it beforehand and it still turned out perfect.

Finally!  A meatloaf I can be more than proud of!  I made it exactly per the recipe with only one change:  I added Adobo seasoning instead of just salt and pepper.   It didn't fall apart, wasn't dry at all, and was not tasteless as all my other meatloaves have been.  My Hubby and I  loved it.  Very easy recipe and I will be making this again!

I made this recipe with only a few substitutions / modifications: 1) I added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce and also 2 cloves of garlic. 2) I reduced the amount of milk from 3/4 cup to 1/4 cup. My loaf came out very moist and not too greasy or runny. (I did place bread slices at the bottom of my loaf pan, however, I think I will invest in a loaf pan with an colander insert). 3) I also added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to the brown sugar and ketchup mixture. 3) I spread the brown sugar, ketchup, and Worcestershire sauce mixture on top of my meatloaf. Everyone loved the meatloaf tonight. I paired it with Honey Roasted Red Potatoes recipe. Dinner was a big hit tonight. ????

This just tasted like onion. I even cut the onion down to 1/2 small one. Can't really taste much else in it. Meat was moist but nothing special. The sauce I doubled it was good we put it on top of the meat to cook and just before it was done added more. Also added Worcestershire in the sauce. Used 9×13 pan.

This recipe ended up in our 'keeper' file. We substituted 2/3:1/3 venison/pork as our hamburger mixture, tomato paste for ketchup and gluten-free bread crumbs for the crackers. Makes a nice leftover meal when reheated on mashed potatoes in the microwave. Our 18-yr-old son commented that he liked the brown sugar tomato paste on the bottom more. We agreed. Not at all fatty because of the lean venison and spiced up just a bit with hickory steak seasoning sprinkled on top.

I made the recipe with 1 & 1/2 lbs of beef and 1/2 lb of gr pork. I also added a little more salt, pepper and ginger. Next time though I will mix the brown sugar and ketchup together and pour it over the top while baking instead of on the bottom as the recipe calls for. I do think it is a very tasty recipe and will definitely make it this way from now on!!

Perfect!  Be sure to crush crackers VERY FINE. Consider sautéing onions before adding them. Put ketchup/brown sugar on top. Baked 1 hr 45 mins at 350.

I like this recipe and its one of my go to's but I find that putting all the milk is makes it too loose. I prefer to leave the milk out.

This is EVERYONES favorite meatloaf! I don't modify the recipe at all, although now that I've made it several times I'm loose with measuring the brown sugar and ketchup base, I just layer the bottom of the pan evenly. I've shared this recipe so many times!

Great meatloaf recipe. I put  brown sugar and ketchup both top and bottom and not just all on the bottom. Other than that i kept this recipe the same. I haven't had a better tasting meatloaf than this one.

Absolutely the BEST meatloaf ever!! I made it with 95% fat free ground beef and it was so moist and delicious. We had leftovers and it was wonderful for a second night.  It will be the only meatloaf recipe for me from now on!

I doubled the recipe and used two loaf pans so I could bring it to a pot luck dinner, hoping it would be good but a little doubtful. I added a bit of Worcester sauce, garlic and substituted a little burger spice and Knorr bullion for salt. I also kept the liquid from the pan and put it in a gravy dish to pour on top, as desired. There were huge lasagnas and many other dishes there but people were standing in line for my meatloaf for seconds and thirds. It was gone before I could get back to it for more. Yuummmy!!! Great Recipe, Thanks!

This was the best meatloaf I have ever eaten!  The glaze was yummy!  The only change I made was I substituted crushed Ritz crackers for the saltines because that's what I had on hand.  I will be making this again for sure.

Love this recipe! It’s my go-to for meatloaf now. Here are my changes to make it dairy and gluten free: use 1/2 cup dairy-free milk, use 3/4 cup oats instead of crackers, add 1/2 tsp garlic powder, add 1 T. Worcester sauce. Put the topping on top, but change the brown sugar to 1/4 cup and add 1 T. Worcester sauce. Bake about an hour or until done. Drain off whatever grease you can. So delicious!

I've made this meatloaf many times and each time it comes out great.  However, I may replace the crackers  with bread crumbs add green peppers then maybe add a few red pepper flakes. Thumbs UP!!!

If you put the brown sugar on the bottom, invert onto a platter for serving. If you don't use a loaf pan then put the brown sugar mixture on top of the meat mixture.

I made this like regular meatloaf.  just put sauce on the top, and it turned out great.  My family loves the sweet taste of this meatloaf, and asks for it at least twice a month.

I doubled the meat so that there would leftovers.   I used a couple of stalks of celery chopped along with the onion.  Instead of crackers, I used Italian bread crumbs.  I also agree that the ketchup and brown sugar should be on top.  I mixed it with a couple dashes of Worcester sauce.   This is my go to recipe for great meatloaf.

My kids love this meatloaf! I took some suggestions and I did put the ketchup and brown sugar on top of the meatloaf, I poked holes in the meatloaf so that the ketchup mixture could seep into the meat.  I made the ketchup mixture tangy by adding mustard. Making meatloaf as a kid, I was required to use "bug juice" as I knew it, really Wostercher Sauce, so I added that, just a dab.  I've made this three or four times and my kids eat it up ask for second servings each time.

Best meatloaf ever. I tried the suggestion about putting bread underneath to soak up the grease. Then I put the glaze over the top, instead of at the bottom. I also used breadcrumbs and onion soup mix which was easier for me. Was perfect.

Great recipe! I did make a few changes after reading the reviews- I used Italian bread crumbs instead of saltines, I used 1/2 cup milk, and I added Worcestershire sauce and a little BBQ sauce to the glaze. I put the glaze on top rather than on bottom after cooking meatloaf for about an hour, then put it back in the oven for an addition 10-15 mins. Turned out great! Will definitely make again.

4 stars on its own. 5 with my revisions. My mom always added yellow mustard to make the sauce tangy too. So I added 1 1/2 tsp to the sauce. For the meat I also used vegetable crackers for the crumbs - which gives a lot of flavor. I would also recommend sauteing the onions so they are soft. This was one of the first meals I made for my husband as newly weds and we both loved it!

Had a great flavor and easy to put together with items on hand.  I did not put the ketchup/brown sugar mixture on the bottom (as I made this on a broiling pan) but on top and it turned out great.

Very easy, tasty recipe, thank you! We don't have saltine crackers in the UK, and I'm allergic to wheat so I used oat cakes. I added Worcestershire sauce to the Tommy k and mustard and garlic to the beef. Utterly yummy!

To save time and create pre-portioned pieces that are easy to drop into a freezer bag for later (or lunch for tomorrow), I divide this recipe up into a 12-cup muffin tin. Bake at 350 for about 40 minutes and you're good! I replaced the saltines with buttery ritz crackers instead, then doubled the ketchup mixture since everyone always wants more glaze. I didn't grow up with meatloaf but this recipe is SO easy that I look forward to making it on the regular since even my picky kids love the simplicity of it.

I made this meatloaf exactly the way it's written.  My husband is a deer hunter  so most of the time I use half ground beef and half ground version.  Everything else is done the same.  This is the best recipe for meatloaf.  We love it.  I don't even look at other recipes for meatloafs because it is so delicious.  It's even good the next day cold for a sandwich.

Very good!   I did use oats instead of crackers, and added a little worchester sauce to the sauce.

I've made this many times now. Absolutely love it.  Sometimes I add red or green chopped pepper with the onion (I saute my onion and pepper in butter or margarine.)  Sometimes I substitute quick cooking oatmeal for the bread crumbs.  And, sometimes I add 1 tablespoon flax meal to the mix and reduce the recipe to 1 egg.  I also like to form my loaf in a 9 x 13 baking dish on top of sliced bread.  When I do that I baste the meatloaf with the ketchup/brown sugar topping in the last 10-15 min of baking to prevent the topping from burning.  Also, I omit the salt.  Usually I'm adding a tablespoon of Worcester sauce and there is plenty of salt in that as well.

It was good, changed the mind of my family who always hated meatloaf.  I lessened the amount of brown sugar and ketchup to 1/2 and added and 1 tablespoon Worcestershire.  I put it on top as some reviews suggested and bread on the bottom, used 85/15 beef but there was still a lot of grease.  I'll try the 90/10 next time.  I also added 2 tablespoons of Worcestershire  to the meat.  Definitely recommend softening the onions and 2 gloves of garlic.

My family and I LOVE this easy recipe! The glaze on top is PERFECT and so easy! This recipe is great as is but sometimes my kids prefer a little less onion and it is still great with less onion as well!

I pretty much stuck to the recipe, although I added 1 teaspoon of Italian seasoning, and used panko breadcrumbs in place of the crushed saltine crackers. It turned out beautifully.

REALY GOOD  This has a great sweet flavor. My mother made this except she made a sauce of equal parts brown sugar and ketchup heated and drizzled over top. I tried this to see the difference. Grease is going to be the obvious difference, but 
wanted to try . I was surprised. My moms is a cleaner tasting meatloaf with sweetness added. This is moist , sweetness filtering through the meatloaf and is very good. I will make
it this  way again. There is the grease factor to deal with however.

Very good recipe, my husband kept making himself meatloaf sandwiches with the leftovers.
Next time I make it, I'll substitute the chopped onion with the onion soup mix and will use leaner ground beef as, for my taste, not my husband's, the loaf was too greasy. I used 80/20 ground beef.
Thanks for the recipe!

Recipe was great, I did like other reviewers suggested and put the ketchup brown sugar mix on top instead of the bottom.  I also added a green pepper so i could use it up and 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce. Used bread on the bottom to soak up a lot of the grease.  Will make this again!

This is the first meatloaf my kids like.  My oldest daughter likes meatloaf, but she loves this one and my oldest son, typically does not like meatloaf period really enjoyed this one, and finally my third child said this is way better than grandmas which is worthy of 5 stars for sure!

Mine was a little wet, so I might subtract a little milk next time. I added two ingredients that I think improved it: 1 T Worcestershire and 4 cloves minced garlic. I make this sauce for the top (instead of the ketchup and brown sugar in the bottom of the pan): 1/2 c ketchup, 2 T yellow mustard, 2 T brown sugar, and 1 T Worcestershire. An excellent meatloaf!

A great meatloaf putting the bread on the bottom to soak up the grease was a good idea. I did not put the ketchup mix on the bottom just on top. In had Zucchini to use up so I grated into the meatloaf and I believe it made for a super moist loaf.

I cannot tell you how fantastic this is!  Family members who don't even like meatloaf LOVE this!  I do add in some Rotel tomatoes to the meat mix and then some on top as baking.  I also stuff the inside with a cheese mixture of Parmesan cheese or any type of white cheese; not too much.  Lastly, I add in a couple of teaspoons of A-1 to the mix.  We are A-1 people, it adds some spice since we are not "onion" people so for us, this makes it perfect.

I THINK THIS IS THE RECIPIE THAT MY MOTHER MADE, DON'T KNOW FOR SURE.  WISH I WOULD HAVE READ THE COMMENT SECTION BEFORE I MADE IT. NEXT TIME I WILL CUT DOWN THE BROWN SUGAR  TO 1/3 CUP, IF THAT'S NOT ENOUGH  I'LL CUT IT TO 1/4. NEXT I WOULD CUT THE MILK TO 1/2 CUP, IT DID COME OUT LIKE BBQS, SO I BAKED IT AN ADDITIONAL 1/2 HR. SOMEONE HAD MENTIONED ADDING 1TBSP  WORCESTSHIRE SAUCE,  I ADDED IT AFTER IT WAS ALREADY IN THE OVEN A FEW MINUTES. (THAT'S WHEN I FELT I HAD THE RIGHT RECIPIE) MOM WOULD EITHER USE CRACKERS (21=3/4 CUP) OR LIGHTLY  (DRIED) TOASTED BREAD CRUSHED UP, MIXED ALL INGREDIENTS TOGETHER, INSTEAD OF BROWN SUGAR AND KETCHUP ON TOP. (IF IT WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR MAMA IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME). MAKING THESE CHANGES, I THINKS IT WILL BE AS GOOD AS MAMAS, HOT ) FINALLY AFTER 3,015,487,523,694 DIFFERENT RECIPIES I THINKS I GOT IT!!!!!!

My family raved over this! Like a lot of other reviewers, I put the ketchup/brown sugar on top instead of the bottom. I didn't have a loaf pan, so made it in a casserole dish. Also, I don't like onion, so I used an onion dip packet. I will be making this again! Yummy!

I've made this recipe a few times now. I'm always shocked how this recipe can make the lowly hamburger meatloaf taste like it belongs  in an uptown restaurant and that I'm making meatloaf without tomato sauce. I'm never going back. It's the favorite meatloaf recipe now and it gets doubled at our house. Oh, I now add a garlic clove  and a pepper.

Because I hate to review a recipe until I've made it EXACTLY  as written, I did ( except put the sauce on top so it could be a topping) ...and it was delicious, our favorite meat loaf so far. . Next time around, I  combined some ingredients from my old standard meat loaf mix, adding some ketchup to the meat mix, some Worcestershire sauce,  a bit less milk, and Panko crumbs. I just added ingredients to get a moist loaf before it cooked.  It all worked great with the brown sugar glaze and the Worcestershire actually balanced the sweet glaze  also wanted this to be a complete dinner in one dish so I added thin sliced carrots and cubed potatoes BEFORE I added the glaze on top ( (about 1/2 through cooking time) and it was perfect. .As noted, the standard recipe is very tasty too. If you want less fat, put bread slices in bottom of cooking pan and cook the potatoes and carrots in foil with a bit of water and dab of butter.

One of my favorite recipes! It needs a lot of tweaks.  By itself, it's a watery mess.

Quick and easy... I doubled ingredients, finely processed onion in mini food processor.  substituted half the milk for tomato puree, added a splash of Worcestershire Sauce, and 1 tsp garlic powder.   I put half the mix in the pan and placed 6 cheese sticks , using 2 groups of 3 to cover the length of the loaf - then the other half of the meat mix.  (hard boiled eggs are even better - but I was pressed for time).  Then I mixed brown sugar and ketchup and spread it on top and baked 1 1/3 hour.   Impressively tasty considering such few ingredients!

I followed the recipe, except I used ground turkey.  My very picky 15 year old actually had a second helping!  It was moist and the brown sugar flavor was delicious.  I was concerned it would stick to the pan but it easily pulled away.

First off, I hate when other reviewers change the entire recipe and than they rate themselves.  One thing I found helpful is put the loaf pan meatloaf in a water bath -- this helps the underlying coating to penetrate the loaf -- also, I agree about running off some of the grease and for God's sake, let it REST before turning it out of the pan.  It was good. I added some Italian seasoning -- the only  diversion from the recipe.

Very delicious. My family is still raving about this meatloaf! It's by far the best I've ever had! I used Progresso Itailian breadcrumbs instead of saltine crackers. I put the brown sugar/ketchup mix ontop of the meatloaf 15 minutes before it was done. I used 1 egg and 1/2 cup of milk. I cut up an onion, 2 cloves of garlic, and bell pepper in the meat. I cooked the onion, garlic, and bell pepper in the pan with the meat to add more flavor: So delicious. 
Used seasoning from this website

Wow, I enjoy meatloaf, have since I was a kid! I followed this recipe but diced the onions, added minced garlic, Italian bread crumbs and some Worcestershire sauce and I used less milk and into the loaf pan. I followed the instructions for the glaze but did add Worcestershire to that as well. I'll make this again for sure!

I actually hate meatloaf and made this for my husband who misses eating it.  Next time, I'll cut the onions smaller since my 3 year old doesn't like seeing onions in her food.  And I might put a glaze on top in addition to the bottom.  The glaze on bottom was very soupy, but tasty.

Love this meatloaf recipe. Really easy to make. I just make a sauce with the ketchup and brown sugar that people can put on it after they get their own piece. First time I made this recipe I put the sauce on top when I baked it and it just ended up being a big mess (but still a tasty mess (: )

We love this recipe and have made it over and over again for several years now. We like to add red, yellow and green bell peppers and if I don't have saltines around, I have used breadcrumbs and it's turned out just as good. You can really add any ingredient you like. I enjoy reading the reviews periodically to glean new ideas. It's an easy recipe to make ahead and keep in the freezer for those nights when you don't have a plan for a fresh-cooked meal.

Instead of 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef, I combined 1 lb each of the beef and a lb of ground pork. The aroma filled the house and we had a hard time waiting for dinner. My son who doesn't eat meatloaf dived right in. Will definitely make again in the future.

I basically hate meatloaf. Grew up eating it and always found it to be totally awful. My kids have begged me to make it well for a long time I dug my heals in until I found this recipe. This has changed my opinion of meatloaf. It's very good. I love to make it in the fall with mashed potatoes and salad.

Great simple recipe. The brown sugar adds a bit of sweetness to the savory and it's a perfect pairing. I always make it with the ketchup and brown sugar on top rather than under, as I've simply found it serves better this way.

I don't typically like meatloaf but I absolutely love this recipe.  I have made it for friends and family and they loved it too!  Definitely will continue to make this crowd favorite.  I have substituted ground turkey in the recipe before and it was still delicious.  A definite winner in my book.

I really liked this recipe! I through a lot of the other reviews and changed a few things.
I added some bbq sauce to the ketchup/brown sugar then also put put it on top instead of the bottom.
I was meant to put bread in the bottom to soak up any fat or anything but forgot! Ha! Luckily it was fine without the bread. 
I added Worcestershire sauce, garlic  and chilli. I had it in mashed potato! It was so good!
Will definitely make this again but with the following changes
More sauce!! Someone else suggested going  mince - sauce- mince - sauce. Such a good idea!
More Worcestershire!
Maybe using French onion soup mix  instead of onion!
Can't wait to have it again !

I gave this recipe to a friend who is "cooking-challenged."
They turned out one of the best tasting meatloaf's I have eaten recently.  Moist, done to perfection, and absolutely delicious.  An exceptional test, strong,beefy and pleasant. Made  a few small changes:  Used 1# ground beef and 1# ground turkey.  Used Ritz crackers rather than saltines.  Added 1/4 cup more milk to account  for the extra meat.

I am sure that following the receipt exactly would produce superb results..

This will become my go-to recipe for meatloaf.

Excellent tasted great but like others I put glaze on top and also added worchester sauce to the ketchup and brown sugar.This allowed me to drain the grease during cooking.The price of hamburger these days doesn't allow me to use a better grade of hamburger that has a low grease content so using regular ground beef just has to much grease to have the ketchup mixture on the bottom. Other than that this recipe is fantastic.Thank you for posting it.We will be having this again soon.

For a leaner meatloaf I like to cook my meatloaf on a rack inside a pan so the grease will drain. Then I mix the ketchup and brown sugar together and I wait to spread the mixture on the meatloaf until the last 20 minutes of baking. I also add extra spices we have around the house to the meatloaf to add more flavor.

Love this as is. Made it several times as it is my son's favorite.  We prefer it with bread crumbs over crackers.  I also put 1-2 tablespoons of brown sugar in the mix.  Leave the brown sugar on the bottom of the pan with ketchup on the top last 30 minutes.

I prefer it with less brown sugar, but overall a good recipe! I always add in a couple other things like soy sauce, bread crumbs, Worcestershire sauce, and some spices. Its hard to mess up meatloaf, so I change it up almost every time...but this is a great starting point.

First meatloaf I had ever made, pretty good, sweet sauce. I personally like spicy meat as well as my family, but it was pretty good.

I have never been a fan of meatloaf but I fell in love with this recipe. I had seconds which I have never done with meatloaf before. Even after seconds I wanted more.

Really good!  I think this may have been the best meatloaf I've ever made.  I did make modifications, but this wonderful recipe and the suggestions of others were certainly my guide.  I'm sure it would have been delicious without any changes.  Here is what I did.  Added:  1 mild Italian sausage (removed from casing), 2 cloves of minced garlic, a few shakes of Worcestershire, 1/2 tsp. of dry mustard, and a hefty squirt of ketchup to the meat mixture.  Used 1 egg, 1/2 cup milk, 1/2 cup Italian bread crumbs instead of cracker crumbs, 3/4 tsp. seasoned salt instead of regular, and upped the ginger to 1/2 tsp.  I also used 2 lbs. of 80/20 ground beef.  I think the higher fat content makes a big difference in a meatloaf.  The last meatloaf I made I used 7% ground beef and it was a little dry.  I use a meatloaf pan that drains the fat into a bottom pan, so It's not like being stuck with all that fat since it melts away into the bottom.  However, the end result is a moist, flavorful, and delicious meatloaf .  With the extra meat in the recipe, 1 hour and 20 minutes was perfect in the oven.  Oh, yes, for the topping I reduced the ketchup to 1/3 c., added 1 Tbs. each of BBQ sauce and yellow mustard to the ketchup and reduced the brown sugar to 3 Tbs.  Stirred it all up and spread on top prior to placing in the oven.  Whatever you don't skip the ginger in the meat mixture; it's key to the flavorful outcome. And the flavor blends well with the topping.

I found this recipe to be different when it comes to its preparation. Putting the brown sugar and catsup on the bottom of the pan makes it difficult to take out of the loaf pan. I turned the loaf upside down on the plate when it was done  and that is the answer to serving this meatloaf, if not, the catsup and brown sugar would stay in the loaf pan. Three stars for the way it is prepared four stars for the taste. One must pour out the grease before removing it from the pan or else you would have all the grease going onto your serving dish. Next time I will put the brown sugar and catsup on the top of the meatloaf and see how that works.

They only difference is I put slices of white bread on bottom to soak up the grease. Otherwise, every else was great with brown sugar and ketchup over the top. It came out excellent. It was awesome!!

For just the two of us  - I used muffin tins to bake the meatloaf and cut down on the brown sugar.   Other than that, I enjoyed the recipe.

This is an amazing meatloaf recipe & my husband went nuts over it. Like others, I put the brown sugar & ketchup on top, & put bread slices on the bottom to soak up the grease. I found some brisket ground beef, & was curious how that would work out. Figured it would make the recipe or otherwise not. It was amazing! I've never seen brisket ground beef before .I'll definitely be making this recipe again.

This is my go to meatloaf recipe, well the sauce is. I make the meatloaf a little different and stuff it with mozzarella cheese. I also form the meatloaf and put it in a 9x13 pirex so it doesn't cook in the grease also I make my meatloaf pretty huge to feed my family of 7. I double the sauce and put half on before putting it in the oven then put the remainder on when there is abput 15 mins left. My entire family LOVESSSSS when I make this meatloaf. Thanks for the recipe

This is my family favorite meatloaf recipe. I have been making it for the last several years. I have made only minor changes. First I use just only  a little  bit of brown Sugar in the bottom of the bottom of the pan mixed with a little bit of ketchup just enough to coat the bottom.  I also use seasoned crumbs instead of saltine and extra onions. Last, 20 mins before it is ready I add a thin layer of  ketchup to the top. A helpful hint... Make a double recipe and freeze one pan. Defrost in the morning and bake in the evening soooo easy!!!!

Wonderful if you follow the directions! I cooked it the first time as written. Then the second time, I tried what the popular reviewers suggested and put the sugar and ketchup on top. It was too sweet and just not that impressive.  It is MUCH better if you follow the original directions! The sweetness is all the way through the meat and not too strong as some of it stays in the 'gravy' in the loaf pan.  Well done:)

I made only a few changes. I sautéed the onion until caramelized, substituted breadcrumbs for the crackers as I didn't have them and forgot the ginger. I mounded the meat into a loaf shape and baked it that way using half the sauce in the first half of the baking time and adding more sauce every few minutes.

This is on my favorite list. This is my go-to meatloaf, the only thing is that I do not include the saltine crackers, I use seasoned bread crumbs it comes out tasting delicious! When it's all done I turn over the loaf pan upside down to get the meatloaf out, all the melted juices of the brown sugar spill over the meatloaf & the ketchup turns into the glaze & it's just mouth watering.

I've made this several times and it's our favorite meatloaf! The first time I made it I sent half to my son and his roommates. They fought over who got the last piece. The next time I made it I had to make 2, they wanted their own meatloaf, they loved it and none of them are meatloaf fans! I followed the recipe exactly and just flipped it over onto a cookie sheet like a pineapple upside down cake. It worked perfectly. This is the best meatloaf I've ever eaten and the brown sugar ketchup "sauce" is outstanding!

My family LOVED this meatloaf! The only changes I made was: used 1cup of seasoned bread crumbs instead of crackers and put the ketchup/brown sugar/worcestershire sauce mixture on top of the meatloaf instead of the bottom. Will definitely be making this again.

I've been using this recipe for years. Love it. I add brown sugar to bottom and on top with lots of ketchup on top as well. The only challenge I have is determing when the meatloaf is cooked all the way through. Seems as if I always need it to sit longer than 1 hr in the oven. Anyone have the same issue with 1hr being to short on time or maybe the oven temp needs to be higher? Pair it with green beans and mash potatoes. .yummy!

I recommend using crumbled Ritz Crackers instead of crushed saltine cracker crumbs, and leaving off the brown sugar and ketchup topping.  Serve with mashed potatoes and ketchup.

Tip for the topping. I use less brown sugar. I hear it with a little butter in a pot then add the ketchup. I also put in 1 can of diced tomatoes. Then add more brown sugar if needed. When the loaf is about 15 minutes from done I uncover it turn up the heat to 400 and add the topping and then let it finish cooking. Comes out perfect.

A friend made this for me and it was so good I searched so that I could make as well. I do make with one alteration based on her guidance...I mix the ketchup in with the meat mixture. I made it both ways but my family seems to like it better this way and you don't have to try to scoop it out of the bottom this way either.

Turned out really good, but I would only use 1 egg and 1/4 cup milk or it gets too runny. Used bread crumbs or Ritz crackers crushed and added Worcestershire sauce in the glaze and the meat mixture.  Put the glaze on top the last 15 min of cooking.

I made this but a little differently (my mom's recipe doesn't have ginger or onions) and I bake mine for 75 minutes at 350. I also save some of the brown sugar/ketchup mixture to drizzle on top, making it both on the bottom and top.
 
This meatloaf is and has always been a HUGE HIT in our home (2 adults and 3 children).  It is almost unheard of to have a main dish that all of us love.  I actually have 2 of them in the oven right now--one for dinner tonight and one for lunches during the week.

What a great recipe! I made a few little changes- cut the brown sugar to 1/4 c, decreased the milk to 1/2 c., 1 egg, and 1 tbsp Worcester sauxe to brown sugar/ketchup mix, I also used 1/2 the sauce for the last 20 minutes as a glaze on top. Delicious!!!!

This was quite good.  Very tender. Tasty sauce. Only thing I did different was use dried minced onions (hubby doesn't like fresh) and Townhouse crackers rather than Saltines.

We put the brown sugar on top, lessened the milk and added garlic like most of the other reviewers suggested. The group said the thickness and consistency was nice, but the meat itself was rather bland. I think we'll use the saltine and milk in another meatloaf recipe we tend to use more.

Because of another reviewer I did the following:
"Used 1/2 cup of brown sugar. - I added 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to the ketchup/brown sugar mix. - I used 1/2 cup of milk and 1 egg. - I added 2 cloves of garlic to the meat mixture. Finally, I used a cup of season bread crumbs instead of the crackers."

I have ALWAYS made terrible meatloaf, so I quit trying. But, my son asked why I never fixed it after eating some at a restaurant. I tried a few other recipes that turned out dry and nasty, but this one turned out great! Thanks for sharing.

I made this and love it! We made a few adjustments to the recipe: 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup milk, 1 egg, instead of ginger we used 2 garlic cloves and instead of saltine crackers we used 1c bread crumbs. We added the glaze to the bottom of the loaf pan and glazed the top :) I made some extra glaze.

I've made this dish several times before. This time I did a mixture of ketchup, mustard and brown sugar and poured it on top of the meat before cooking.  Even my six year old was pleased with this dish.

Just put the sauce mixture on top.  Also used traditional meat loaf of  1/3 veal, 1/3 beef, 1/3 pork.  Gives it much more flavor.  Also if you don't want the grease in the bottom, get a meat loaf pan from Williams-Sonoma.  Inexpensive and well worth it.

Read through some reviews so I put the brown sugar and ketchup on top and on bottom. The family thought it was pretty tasty. My only issue is that even though we each had about 1/3 pound of beef in each of our servings (plus 2 sides), we ended up hungry again after just a couple hours.

Very moist, and not too greasy, especially if you drain some of the juice when it's about 3/4 of the way done. Definitely making this again!

Really easy and delicious. You can pretty  much do anything you want with meatloaf. I added dill/garlic cheese curds, Italian bread crumbs and used hamburger buns on the bottom to soak up the grease. Ended up eating the buns with the meat....so yummy and I'm NOT a big meat eater.

This was the best meatloaf I ever had in my life and first time making it.

Instead of seasoning, I threw a packet of French Onion Soup powder mix in it (still added chopped onion)

I mixed the Ketchup with bbq sauce put that on the top and wrapped the sides of the meatloaf with bacon. (I had some left over from the weekend).

The only other thing I did was dice up sweet potatoes and add them + baby carrots to the casserole dish I was cooking my meatloaf in. 

After cooking the meatloaf + veggies for 1 hour I broiled it to get crispy.

Now I'm sitting at work wishing I had brought leftovers for my lunch.

Made this meatloaf last night, and it was a HIT! The only thing changed was I added the brown sugar and ketchup on top instead of the bottom of loaf pan.  This meatloaf will go in my recipe file as EXCELLENT.  Thank you!!!

Great with a couple of changes per the other reviews. Add a little Worcestershire sauce to both the meatloaf mixture and the sauce (1 Tbs. each). Used seasoned breadcrumbs instead of saltines. Added 2 big cloves of garlic minced. Cut back the milk to 1/2 cup. Cut down the brown sugar to 1/4 cup. I free formed the meatloaf and placed in the center of a 9x13 baking dish. Added the sauce on top 20 minutes before taking out of the oven.

Delicious and easy! I substituted ground turkey, and modified the recipe by decreasing the milk to 1/4 c, using only one egg, and adding about 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1 tbsp worchestershire sauce to the brown sugar & ketchup mixture. The meatloaf came out extra moist and flavorful.

My go-to mealoaf recipe! So easy to make, yet so juicy and delicious!
I followed others' advice and placed the brown sugar and ketchup on top of the meatloaf. They melt down in the oven and give the meat an amazing taste!
It was a bit sweeter than I prefer, so I'll cut down on the brown sugar next time.

A real winner for the family. I've made it twice so far. Once as written and once with Ritz crackers due to what was in the pantry.
Be careful when you flip it out of the pan because the top is liquid.

I used oatmeal instead of crackers.  I omitted onion and added garlic. I doubled ginger and added about two tablespoons of kale powder. My three kids loved it (6, 4 and 3).  The sauce was to sweet. We scraped it off and used Kinder's BBQ sauce.  My husband and I enjoyed it too.

This is a huge hit with my family. However I never have 1 1/2 lb. of ground beef available.  It's always in 1 lb. sections. I cut down the ingridents to 1 egg, no milk, and use 1/2 cup of gluten free bread crumbs.  I also put the glaze on the top.

Glaze on top, not on the bottom. Added garlic and Worcestershire sauce to the glaze. Omitted sugar. Added saltines, so I omitted the salt. Added onion powder and beef bullion cubes to mimic onion soup powder. Used only one egg and cut back on the milk a little. This is a staple in my house. We have it twice a month. Very good recipe.

Not a bad meatloaf recipe but the brown sugar made it way too sweet.   I also agree with some other reviewers that the ketchup/brown sugar should be baked on top and not on the bottom of the meatloaf.  Will try it again with less (or no) brown sugar and ketchup on the top.   UPDATE:  Made it again with the ketchup and brown sugar on top.  We liked it more that way.  Will probably cut down the salt a little next time.

Yummy! Better than any meatloaf I've ever made.  Took advice of other reviewers and topped the meatloaf with the glaze. also used bread crumbs and garlic to the meat. Really tasty!

I will never use another meatloaf recipe!  This is flavorful, moist but firm enough to cut beautifully. I did sauté one stalk of finely diced celery with the onion because I like it that way, and I put the ketchup/brown sugar mix on top instead of the bottom. Otherwise, there is no need to change Anything!  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

This is a great base recipe! Like other reviewers I put the brown sugar and ketchup on top of the meatloaf. I cook with what I have on hand, so tonight I added a clove of garlic, three tbs of wosechire, and a tbs of Mccormicks garlic and herb seasoning. When I have it, sometimes I'll add red, yellow, or orange peppers. I'm normally not a fan of meatloaf, but the brown sugar makes all the difference!

My whole family loves this.  We have a 5 1/2 year old and 3 3/4 twins.  Everyone always finishes their supper  when we make this :)  I'd cut back on  the milk by about 1/4 cup as it's pretty moist and not always firm when cutting even after letting it sit.  I add 2 tbsp worcestershire sauce too.

Left out the saltines, milk, and ginger. Added diced carrots, celery, oregano, Italian bread crumbs, and minced garlic.   

Applied the glaze about half way through cooking and everything came out perfect.

Everyone absolutely loved it! Credit to SLJ6 though for the alterations, since I did use their changes to the glaze. I cut back the brown sugar to 1/4 cup and added Worcestershire sauce to the mix before pouring it on top.  It turned out so moist and savory, everyone went back for seconds and I will definitely be making this again soon!

One of the reviewers complained about the brown sugar and ketchup being on the bottom instead of the top of the meatloaf.  Well, any sensible person serves meatloaf turned out of the pan and thus the toppings are on the top.  I love this recipe and have made it for years.  It's easy and delicious.

I love this recipe and I make it some times. I change it a bit though. Instead of layering the sugars with the ketchup, I mix it together with a bit of mustard and brush it on. I also use a mix of corn,peas and paprika in the mince together with 1/4 cup milk and half a cup of heavy cream.

Love this! Personally I do prefer to put the ketchup/brown sugar mixture on top rather than on the bottom but it works either way.

For the people saying the brown sugar and ketchup should be on top Ive made this lots of times now and after I take it out of the oven and let it sit for about 15min then put a large plate over the top and flip it over. Then all the juices and the brown sugar ketchup mix soaks in! If it has a lot of juice I drain some into a cup before I flip it then pour it back over it. The juices are very hot so you have to be careful! I also use plain oatmeal instead of saltines! Everyone loves this meatloaf! Tonight I am trying half Splenda and half brown sugar because my boyfriend is diabetic. Hopefully it turns out good!

I have to agree with the reviewers saying the brown sugar and ketchup should go on top.  Since the fat gathers in the bottom of the pan, this just ended up being a watered down soupy brown sugar and ketchup combo.  I made it and while it was cooking and double checked the recipe to make sure it DID say put it on the bottom.  Like the recipe, but do not put this mixture in the bottom of the pan.

Very good recipe!  I didn't make any changes to the ingredients, I did prepare a little differently. Made loaf put it in a casserole dish and put the sauce on top, instead of on the bottom.

My wife calls this "fancy meatloaf" and hates it, but I love it! The ginger flavor and sweetness of the glaze really stand out; before you even bite into it the smell tells you it's not a traditional loaf.

I add grated carrots and minced garlic for flavor. Chopped bell pepper is also a good way to add a little color. I mix the brown sugar and ketchup together and put it on top of the loaf after it's in the pan. Pressing it into the bottom of the pan just gives you a nasty, greasy, useless soup. You will still get some of this soup, since the sugar is going to melt and run during cooking, but this will flavor the sides of the meat and you'll be left with a nice little sweet glaze on the top of the loaf.

Really good and my family loved it.  
I might try using some Italian seasoning rather than ginger the next time, but the ginger was fine. 
Also, I used low salt Ritz crackers instead of saltines.

I think next time I'll use less milk or maybe more meat. It was a bit soft and kinda fell apart. As other reviews said, the ketchup and brown sugar didn't stick. I like the glaze idea though and think I'll try that next time.

I love this recipe! Try using a tobasco or sriracha ketchup for a sweet and spicy twist.

My fiancé loves sweet :)   We made this for Thxgvg instead of Turkey. Used elk meat and made our own cumin-apricot ketchup.  Made as directed with sauce on the bottom and it was  perfect.

I've made this several times and it's awesome. I followed the recipe exactly the first couple of times and then started making my own changes. I add mustard to the ketchup and brown sugar sauce and pour that on top of the meatloaf. I also use about 4 fresh garlic cloves and chili pepper to taste and sometimes add chopped carrots.

I loved the recipe and the flavor of the sauce. When I first made it the sauce did not stick to the meatloaf so I made some more sauce, completely covered the meatloaf, and put it back in the oven on a baking sheet rather than the meatloaf pan and cooked it another 15 min. My wife thought the glaze was to sweet but I loved it and so did the kids. I didn't chop the onion, instead I threw an onion in my blender and completely pureed it into a sauce (the kids think they hate onions but they don't, they hate the texture) other than that followed recipe and will be making it again!!

Best Meatloaf I've ever made! Everyone loved it and ate leftovers for lunch the next day. I also put brown sugar and catch-up on top. I love how the brown sugar cause the catch-up to form a bright glaze on top.

I think this is the best! I didn't use the ginger, but instead I add a half of packet of roasted garlic and herb seasoning from www.gourmetcreations.net. 
I also added in 1/2 of red pepper chopped. 
So delicious even the kids love it!

This is the best meatloaf recipe I have ever made!  I see comments that the brown sugar and ketchup should be on top but I put it on the bottom they way the recipe says and I think it is much better because you can then spoon it over the meatloaf when done. It also seemed to "pull" the flavor in instead of just sitting on top. I will definitely be making this again soon!

Make it all the time for our family of four. Even use ground turkey and just as good. Usually add a little more ketchup and brown sugar so theres a little more sauce/gravy to drizzle over the top after slicing.

I have never reviewed a recipe before - this one simply ROCKED!....I followed several of the review suggestions (divided sugar mix in 1/2 - 1/2 on bottom balance on top last 15-20)  Omitted milk, used two eggs, added sweet turkey sausage, both bread crumbs and saltines (ran out of italian bread crumbs) also used onion soup mix ...My husband and I love meatloaf - this was simply fantastic.

This recipe is hands down the best meatloaf period! My family, nor I are much of meatloaf fans but this changes everything. It's the perfect balance of flavorful and a little sweet. I try to make this once a month or so, and every time my family and guests rave about it. I've tried many variations to add or change this recipe, but always wind up coming back to the original.

I usually don’t rate a recipe unless i follow ingredients and directions as written. I will this time as i added onions which i think go hand in hand with meatloaf. I also didn’t like the idea of having the brown sugar mixture mixed with grease so i did as others said and put it on top. I drained the grease half way through cooking. Really turned out great. My go to for meatloaf.

Delicious! Made it for my family of picky eaters and everyone loved it. A few modifications I made were putting the brown sugar and ketchup on top of the meat instead of the bottom of the pan, I also only used 1/2 cup of milk, and added some garlic. It was tasty and easy to make

A++Amazing! I've attempted meatloaf before and it was always to moist or greasy or dry. This was perfect! Put the ketchup/brown sugar mix on top, added a dash of Worcestershire and ground mustard. (underneath makes no sense) Cooked it in a larger pan so that if there was grease I could drain it. At first I really questioned the amount of milk but decided to follow the recipe, the loaf was very moist putting it in but turned out perfect. I did turn up the oven to 400 for about half the cooking time, not sure if that helped with the moisture, next time I'll try cooking it at 375.

I made this last night for my husband and sons...they loved it!  I made the glaze and baked it on top the final 15 minutes as previously suggested.  I generally pour a large amount of grease off of my meatloaf and I couldn't picture how it could possibly turn out with the glaze on the bottom.

Fabulous.  Made just as listed.  I found that making it in a square pan was better as in a loaf pan, the middle sometimes didn't get all the way done.  The taste was remarkable and I never liked meatloaf because it was also so dry.

The whole family liked this including my 8 year old daughter who only ever wants to eat noodles.  I used turkey meat, whole wheat Ritz crackers (on hand) an put the glaze on top.  Baked in Pyrex instead of loaf pan.  This was delicious!!

As written, fantastic recipe!  It is the best basic meatloaf I've ever made.  I used a Pyrex loaf pan and drained the grease while it was still hot, then turned the meatloaf out like a cake, so the sugar/ketchup on the bottom was on top.  With minor additions, this meatloaf can be practically anything.  Definitely not boring.

I have made this several times and we like it.  I never measure the ingredients and use this recipe as a blue print. I have made several variations depending on what ingredients I had on hand.

I liked this enough to share with friends and family, but I did add worchester and prefer the sugar/ketchup on top.  I've made it a few times now. Will try adding a bit of garlic and may try putting half the sauce in the bottom and half on top and see how that goes next time.

I altered the recipe a little. I used 1 lb. hamburger and 1/2 lb. of sausage. I just mixed in the ketchup and brown sugar. I added a little Worcester sauce and used Italian breadcrumbs instead of saltines. I also sauteed the onions in a little butter before I added them to the mixture.

I added minced garlic (2 tsp), degydrated/minced onion (instead of fresh), and a pack of french onion soup mix.  After 1 hour, I removed the tinfoil, added brown sugar & ketchup to the top (I did the bottom, too), baked for 20-30 more minutes, and voila! A perfect meatloaf!!  I'll make it like this very time now! Yum!

Fantastic recipe with some very minor changes. My husband doesn't like meatloaf and loves this one. Here are my changes that make all the difference: 1. Form into a loaf in a 9x13 pan and bake instead of a loaf pan so your meat doesn't sit in the grease. I place a couple of slices of bread around mine to absorb any grease. 2. Place the ketchup/brown sugar on the top. Not the bottom. 3. Not a change, but make sure you use Lean ground beef, 7 percent fat or less. I love this recipe for it's ease and it's so delicious!

The meatloaf was delicious!! Had the ketchup/brown sugar on the bottom this time around, but would put it on top from now on. It was easy enough to scoop and spread onto the loaf, but got mixed with the grease and that was kind of icky. Once the sauce was on the meatloaf I devoured it in roughly 30 seconds. It was. So. Good. Going to be using this recipe again very soon!! :)

Delicious! I added celery, cooked it in a 9x13 baking dish, put ketchup and browns sugar mixture on top, and surrounded with baby yukon potatoes that I preboiled for about 5 minutes. So juicy and delicious!

Really great meatloaf. My kids love it! It's like an upside down cake though, you have to turn the meatloaf out onto a serving Platter to have the sauce on the top.

This was a very simple recipe and very yummy, except the only thing is I think it has too many onions in it. It was a little over powering for me and my boyfriend. I will probably be making it again except a whole lot less onions.

I made this for my boyfriend and I. I didn't overly care for it. To me, the brown sugar made it too sweet and had a different taste that I didn't care for. My bf loved it though. Would I make it again? Yes, but I will back off the brown sugar.

I used more brown sugar and lots of worchestershire mixed with the ketchup to glaze the top instead of putting it on the bottom, I also cut up celery and carrots..... the carrots i would leave out next time though because they didn't soften up enough.  Overall very good meatloaf!  I also used seasoned bread crumbs instead of saltines, and added a tablespoon of minced garlic to the loaf as well.  Very easy simple recipe.

Absolutely amazing. This was the best meatloaf I have ever had.
 My wife and I ate a larger pan in 2 meals back to back, it was great reheated. The next time I would like more of the sauce as it was perfect; in my opinion.
This recipe is definitely a keeper....

Best meat loaf I've made in a while.  I used a casserole dish and poured the brown sugar and ketchup mixture on top.  I didn't have any saltines so I used some vegetable crackers that I had.  My 6 year old grandson is a picky eater and looks have a lot to do with whether he will try anything.  He tried it and liked it. I will make this again.  I love leftover meat loaf for sandwiches.

I tried this recipe the other night for dinner. My 5yr old definitely approves. I never thought about brown sugar and putting it on the bottom. We used muffin pans instead of a loaf pan and it worked out wonderfully. Great recipe!

This meatloaf is a FAVORITE!  I wouldn't change anything about it.  Be sure to follow the recipe exactly as is.  Of course you can change the servings and increase and decrease the ingredients but do not add more or less than what it says.  PERFECTION!

Such a great and tasty recipe! My wife says it's the best meatloaf she's ever had. Like many other reviewers I put the ketchup mixture on top. I also used canned breadcrumbs instead of saltines and didn't add the ginger because I forgot about it. If you grew up eating a meatloaf with sweet sauce (my mom always made her own sweet BBQ sauce to top her meatballs) you will love this recipe.

I used 1/4C dried onions. Popped the mixture in a foil lined pan. Let it sit for about 40 minutes then carefully flipped it over onto a plate. Perfect with some mashed taters and veggies!

When i make my my meatloaf in a loaf pan, I flip it over when I'm done. Not much unlike my pineapple upside down cake. I throughly enjoyed it just as directed.

This was delicious. I left out the milk because the eggs already made the mixture wet enough. I didn't have breadcrumbs so I crushed up 6-7 whole grain crackers.

LOVED LOVED LOVED!!!  I followed the given directions other than once it was finished, I placed it upside down on a plate to drain off a bit of the juices for those that don't like juicy meatloaf... if they like juicy they would spoon a little of the juice on their slice.   I tripled the recipe and everyone was happy to eat the left overs the next day (we normally don't like left overs)

Since I love things with a sweet 'n' sour tang -- and my meatloaf with a piquant sauce -- this recipe is perfect in my book!  I've made it several times, always to raves from friends.  The only changes I've made are to add a thin layer of brown sugar and catsup to the top of the loaf before baking, and I also add a small amount of water (about 1/4 cup) around the loaf prior to baking as well. When I made it the first time, = the brown sugar/catsup layer on the bottom underneath the meat loaf didn't make enough sauce.  But this is one of my favorite meat loafs ever, and I highly recommend this recipe!

This has become a staple at my house. I guess I make it about 1x a month and just love it. My husband likes it too, and he usually disdains meatloaf. The sugary bottom is to die for.

I will definitely be making this again!  It was absolutely delicious, and my 2 year old loved it as well, which makes me very happy!  I made just a few minor adjustments that probably didn't alter the taste too much, but made mine with ground turkey, did as the other reviewers recommended by putting the brown sugar and ketchup on top, omitted the ginger because I don't care for it, and used regular bread toasted and crumbled instead of saltines (didn't have any).  I think next time I may put the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom AND the top, as that was the best part (I have a sweet tooth being 38 weeks pregnant).   Best meatloaf I've ever tasted!

I made it exactly as written, with one exception. I mixed the brown sugar and ketchup together, then put them on top of the meatloaf before putting it in the oven. It turned out wonderfully.

I added a tablespoon of Worchester sauce to the brown sugar and ketchup mixture, too.  Also, to make it moist I soaked the cracker crumbs in the milk and eggs before adding them to the meat.  It went over very well!

It was not bad, but it was missing something.  I might make it again and add a package of onion soup mix. Even my family thought that would be better for more flavor.

Delicious! I accidentally mixed the brown sugar and ketchup with the rest of the ingredients instead of putting it on the top, but came out tasting great! My husband loved it

I have made this meatloaf many times, as written, and it's delicious! I never liked meatloaf before making this one! The only thing I do different is I put the brown sugar/ketchup on the top and not in the bottom of the pan. 
TIPS: 1.Don't over mix or it will be a strange texture.
2. Feel free to substitute the cracker crumbs with bread crumbs, dry oatmeal or even cooked rice.

I make mine the same way....almost.  I season my meat with  minced garlic and diced onion. I also put the ketchup/brown sugar mixture on top after meat is almost done to "candy" up on it...kinda like bbq sauce on chicken.  My entire family LOVES it.

I do the same as others and put the brown sugar and ketchup on the top rather then the bottom, but it's now the only meatloaf my family will eat! (also tried it in stuffed peppers)

I have been making a version of this meatloaf for over 20 years from a very similar recipe from the old red plaid BH&G Cookbook.  The main diff is my recipe calls for using the ketchup & brown sugar mixed together as a glaze added in the last 10 minutes of cooking (many tried this on their own anyway from the other reviews).  I tried the method described in this recipe for a change and find that, for my taste, my old recipe justs tastes better and all the glaze isn't stuck in the bottom of the pan.  I also prefer to use a baking pan and shape my loaf so that I can easily drain the grease off durng cooking so that my meatloaf doesn't just sit in grease for an hour.

I will try it, but I'll put the glaze on top, instead of letting it mix with all the grease that drains off. Also, I always cook onions before adding them to meatloaf.

I've made this for years! One of my family favorites. I use a loaf pan with astrainer in the bottom so the meatloaf doesn't sit in grease. I always double the brown sugar topping, put 1/2 on top when cooking, then add the reamaining 1/2 about 15 minutes before done. So, So good!

I have made this meatloaf for as long as I have been married which is 63 years.  In addition to the ketchup and brown sugar I add a good dash of nutmeg and some mustard, and put it on top of the meatloaf during the last 10 minutes of baking. Yum, Yum, good.

I made some tweaks adding cheese and peppers but this is hands down some of the best meatloaf I've ever had. This was easy recipe and I've already made it twice since stumbling upon it.

Put sugar & ketchup on top instead of under the loaf. If not using  fat free meat put a couple pieces bread under the loaf be baking.

Delicious! I made it just as written. DH and I loved it, kids thought it had a few too many onions. I might cut them up smaller next time.

It's a standard at my house. I put the ketchup on top. I also add about a tablespoon of mustard and use dried chopped onions and oatmeal. No matter how you make it though, it's delicious!

My family LOVED this recipe and before dinner was done they asked me to make it again. It was very moist and tasted great! The only thing I did different was use 1/2 C breadcrumbs as I didn't have any saltines. I also inverted it onto a platter after cooking so the glaze was on top when cutting.

I just served this meatloaf up and I'm very impressed, so is everyone else. I followed the recipe but instead of putting the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom, I mixed the two and made it a glaze for the top like another reviewer suggested on here.... Sooooo amazing and I hate meatloaf! I'm happy I tested my luck on this recipe!

I have made this recipe several times and it’s a staple in our house.. I do not but the brown sugar in the bottom because it makes it unbearably sweet.. I mix the brown sugar, ketchup and Worcester sauce together and apply to the top only..

not bad. I used bread crumbs instead of saltines and added 1 tbsp of worcestershire sauce. I prefer to add the (very sweet) sauce 1/2 way through the baking.

It was okay. I will try again though, adding more seasonings. Also the meatloaf was undercooked so I will definitely crank up the heat next time.

Loved it, but made the following changes.  I used 1.5 lbs extra lean ground beef, 1 lb ground pork, and increased the other ingredients proportionally.  I used about 3/4-1 teaspoon of Montreal Steak Seasoning in place of the black pepper, and I added about 2 tsp. to 1 Tbsp. of Worcestershire sauce to the mixture.  I slightly more than doubled the amount of breadcrumbs because it was so wet.  I made two loaves with this recipe and spread the glaze on top, instead of in the bottom of the pan as described.... It was wonderful!  Even with extra breadcrumbs and extra-lean meat, it was plenty moist.

i read the reviews and my family really enjoyed this meatloaf.  I did following some adjustments and I would like to make a recommendation.  I did the recommendation of 1/4 milk, 1/3 brown sugar, bread crumbs instead of crackers, 1 1/2 tbsp of worcheshire sauce and onion soup mix - all good.  I also prepared the meat loaf in a jelly roll pan with three sheets of aluminum foil for easy clean up.  Thank you all for those recommendations.  Yet, I would recommend if you use the onion soup mix - DO NOT USE ANY SALT.  I also added six slices of bacon on the top for flavoring and ended up cooking the meatloaf for about 1 1/2 hours at 350.   The bacon was not crispy so maybe use the broiler for a bit to crisp it up then the sauce at the end.

The kids loved this and even ate a second serving. I did follow the advice of others and spread the glaze over the top of the meat vs. under. It came out great. Quick and easy to prep, so it was a good choice for an evening after work. Simple and yummy!

This is a great recipe.  It's a favorite around here - I may start making two loaves so as to actually have some left over.  t's just like my mom made for us growing up.  The only alteration I make is to put the brown sugar and ketchup on top.  That's how I've always done it, and it works great here.

We really liked this recipe so it's going into the "make again" binder!   Just a few changes...I added celery and sauteed w/ onions until tender, then added to meat.  I was worried the onions wouldn't be done enough since my husband hates any onion that isn't completely cooked until soft.

I have tried this recipe; I absolutely love it. I add a few extra thing to it, and it's even better. the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom!!  I use it as a gravy to add on top of my mash potatoes.  I also mix the brown sugar and ketchup together and when the meatloaf is almost done, I uncover it and pour it on top and bake uncovered for about 5 to 10 minutes.

Very tasty!  Following some suggestions from the reviews, I added 1T Worcestershire to the glaze and spread it on top of the meatloaf as well as underneath.  I used a 9X9 pan rather than a loaf pan.  I cut down on the milk to 1/2C.  Also, I used a meatloaf mix (beef, pork veal) because that's what I had on hand.  I used bread crumbs rather than cracker crumbs.  I baked it for 1 1/2 hours.  My husband asked if this was a new recipe and wanted to know what I did differently.  He said, "From now on, make this one!"

I love this recipe.  Have made it with low-fat ground beef in the past.  I recently made it with 98% fat-free ground turkey.  I actually like the ground turkey version better.  Everyone loved it.  It was very moist and the flavorings were wonderful. I used a loaf pans and mixed the brown sugar and ketchup together and poured it over the top of the meatloaf and let it bake as directed.  Delicious and I will be making this again this weekend.

I made this the other night, and it was a huge hit with the family.  I didn't have any plain breadcrumbs, and had to substitute Italian, but I don't think it changed anything. This was delicious! I would definitely make this again.

I made this recipe with the ingredients listed; however, I did not grease the pan and I mixed the brown sugar and ketchup with the other ingredients.  It was absolutely wonderful.  For everyone that doesn't like the grease in the pan they have meatloaf pans that have an insert with holes in it so the grease drips down into the bottom pan.  This takes care of most of the grease.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

Delicious.  Do add Worcester sauce to meat and sauce....and sauce on top, not bottom. It'll be too greasy if on bottom.   In regards to brown sugar, use less.  My picky eater husband loves it!  This recipe is going on my rotating menu!

First time making meatloaf!!! Super yummy and easy to do. Made a couple of revisions... Added worchester sauce to ketchup and brown sugar on the bottom of the pan, 1/4 tsp to the meat and 1/4 tsp to a glaze I placed on top of the meatloaf by taking 1/4 cup of ketchup and 1/4 cup of ketchup. I used 3 tablespoons of chopped onion flakes instead of cutting an onion and the used 3/4 cups of Italian bread crumbs instead of crackers. So tasty!

Definitely a great meatloaf recipe. I made it per the instructions, and there's only one thing I would change... The ketchup disappears into the juice (and that's with the 96% lean beef) that is created on the bottom, so I'll be spreading the ketchup over the top next time.

Turned out ok for my first time. I used 1/2 the brown sugar and ketchup. I wasnt sure what to do once it was cooked, so after and hour I took it out of the pan and cool on a plate.

LOVE this meatloaf!!!  I have 4 kids... ages 5-11. They ALL LOVED it! My boyfriend loved it, too. I made the recipe as it was written, except I used garlic and herb breadcrumbs only because that's what I had in my pantry. I don't think it changed the taste. I used the amount of milk the recipe called for... it made the meatloaf so tender. Honestly, I can't wait to make it again.

This was the best meat loaf ever. I'm not a fan of meat loaf and neither is my wife. But we both loved it. Definitely will be making this again and again

I think if people were actually reviewing this recipe, instead of the one they are creating with onion soup, worcestershire sauce, less sugar, less milk, etc. ...which in the end barely resembles the actual recipe we are supposed to be reviewing, it would receive far less positive reviews.  This recipe is too sweet, period.  It took a lot longer to cook than one hour.  Aside from that, it's edible.

Don't change a thing, follow the recipe. Its sooo good. If u want to change to bread crumbs, add W sauce, etc, maybe u should try another recipe. I really liked that this recipe was different, thats why i made it and i am very glad i did. I will admit though that i did not add ginger because i was out, but definitely will next time.

I added slightly more hamburger (about 1/4 pound more), reduced the brown sugar to 1/4 cup, and increased the chili powder to 1-2 tbsp, depending on the heat you like.  I don't like to add additional salt, so I left it out.  Because I had them on hand, I used bread crumbs instead of the croutons, and put in a whole large yellow onion and half a green pepper.  I mixed this entire set of ingredients together, as opposed to dividing them into sauce and loaf, and baked them in a draining meatloaf pan.  For a topping, I mixed ketchup and Heinz 57 sauce and covered it.  I have always loved this recipe and have just tweaked it here or there to make it the most delicious for my family.  I think this version is the final one, everyone adores it!

i don't give less than 3 stars unless it was a total disaster…. so id say this one isn't worth making again.it wasn't a disaster because I personally thought it was ok, and edible, but i have three kids and none of them would eat a single bite. so i guess it was too sweet or something.  sorry, i really wanted them to like it!

This is almost exactly the Uncle Ben's Corn Stuffing Recipe.  It's always been a favorite in our house.  The only difference is you use the seasoning packet and bread crumbs from the box.  Add a little bit of French's mustard to the ketchup.

We, as a family, are tired of turkey for Thanksgiving Dinner.  I made four of these beauties/tasties and it was such a hit!  No more wonderful meal than one with a great meatloaf as entree and three sides, oh, and rolls.   OMG!

I made this recipe yesterday and thought it cam out really great. I did do one thing different, and that was put the brown sugar and ketchup mixture on top versus the bottom. Because it was a little sweeter then I like is the only reason I give it 4 stars. Next time I will make this with most likely 1/4th of the brown sugar.

This tasted great!  I only changed a few measurements based on other reviews to get closer to our taste, but kept all ingredients the same.  The whole family truly enjoyed this and we will be making it again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for a very very tasty meat loaf base and sauce. I say meat loaf base, only because I had to adjust certain ingredients to my daughter's low iodine diet (she has cancer and has to be on it for 14 days). Anyhow, for anyone on this low iodine diet, this is the changes I made to this recipe: I used coconut milk instead of milk, egg whites instead of eggs, non-iodized salt, replaced the ginger with dry mustard, replaced the crackers with Quaker Oatmeal, grounded up fine in the Nutri Bullet, and used Heinz no salt ketchup and mixed it with the brown sugar to put on top. It was fabulous- two meatloafs, gone that night- none left over for sandwiches in the morning- boo hoo!

I do plan to make the original recipe after her low iodine diet is done, as I bet it tastes great, too! We can't thank you enough for a wonderful recipe- even if I had to adjust it so she could eat it, it still was delicious! I can't wait to try the original, though!

It was simple to make but the taste of the meat itself was bland. There were way too many onions for my liking. The only best part of the meat loaf was the brown sugar which I put on top instead of the bottom. If I use this recipe I will alter it and add more flavor with less onions.

update: I made this recipe again but added some garlic powder, brown sugar, and cinnamon inside the meatloaf. I also cut the amount of onions to just 1/4. It was delicious!

I tried this recipe yesterday and it was delicious! The only thing I did different was I used ritz crackers (only because that was all I had)...I forgot to put the bread in the bottom so halfway through I poured the juice in a reserved jar, put the loaf back in the oven. After it cooked I took it out to let it rest, then sliced it and poured the juice back over it for some extra favor and moisture (the fat girl in me), which really wasn't needed. then placed it back in the oven for ten minutes or so.

Very yummy. Sweet glaze. Put the glaze on top instead of on bottom. Had to cook about 30 minutes longer than suggested. Was worth the wait though.

This recipe is fine as is. Just keep the top of the loaf flat and flip it over on a plate so the juices flow over the meat. If you use a lean ground beef it will not have a ton of fat.

Best meat loaf i have ever had, keeping this recipe. meatloaf came out so moist but still held together, sweetness of brown sugar was not over powering the flavor of meat.

Was very tasty as meat loaf goes... only one person of the three did not like the brown sugared tomatoe sauce topping...she'd rather just have tomatoe sauce...(NOT ME)  I loved the topping.

This was a fantastic base for a meatloaf recipe! I followed some of the other suggestions but putting the ketchup/brown sugar mix on the top of the loaf rather than the bottom, as it seaped through more nicely.
I would defintiely recommend - it's also easy to add your own favourites into it.. I added a bunch of garlic!

Great flavor!  I really like the onion in the meat, I chopped mine coarsely.  Ginger really added a little something extra, just perfect.  I put ketchup and brown sugar on the top as well in the last 15 minutes of cooking, for my husband who has to have tomato on the top of his meat loaf.  This will be my new meat loaf recipe.  Thank you!

This recipe was awesome! I also used 1/2 cup milk and 1/4 cup brown sugar.  Another person suggested putting half of the ketchup/sugar mixture on the bottom, then placing the rest of the mixture on top when there was about 20 mins left of cooking and it came out great! My boyfriend also loved this recipe and I will for sure be making this again!

This recipe was great!Even my 11 yr old nephew went back for seconds and he 'HATES' meatloaf. I did as others suggested and placed the sauce over the meat and the bread underneath the Loaf in the pan made a huge difference! THANKS!

This is, hands down, the best meatloaf I've ever made.  And don't tell her, but it's better than my mothers.  I did take some other reviewers' advice and added Worcestershire to the sauce, which I put on top of the loaf.

This is our family favorite.  We always have this for our family Christmas dinner.  We like that we can make it a day ahead of time, and all you have to do is throw it in the oven.  The leftovers make another family favorite,,,,,,, meatloaf sandwiches,  We put the ketchup and brown sugar on top before it is cooked.

Made tbis WINNER for dinner tonight.  Best meatloaf we ever ate.  The only thing I changed was the amount of milk to 1/2 cup.  Added a few more saltine crackers.  We were dancing in our seats!

Tasty recipe!   However, I modified it by adding garlic and oregano.  As far as the sauce, I combine ketchup, brown sugar and yellow mustard then pour it on top of the meatloaf during the last 20 minutes of cooking.   The mustard in the sauce gives it a bit more tang.

This was quite  surprise. it was delicious. i did make a few changes…one out of necessity (no milk on hand). i used a pirex baking pan instead of a loaf pan. i substituted milk with half and half because that was all i had. i increase the temperature to 375 degrees. i covered the meatloaf with foil for the 1st 30 minutes. there was alot of sauce from the bottom so i just spread that on top when i served it….

This is a wonderful recipe.  I also use the brown sugar & ketchup as a glaze.  I also add a little yellow mustard.  Each time I make it my husband asks what different I did with making it.  This is the only way I make my meatloaf now. - Janie

Great sweet flavor.  Husband and one child loved it, picky child didn't but its just a texture thing.  Will make this again.  I halved the ketchup and brown sugar on top and bottom. Used less liquid because i only used 1 lb of beef.

I always use the ketchup and brown sugar on my meatloaf. As for the meatloaf I add Green pepper chopped fine. I also add stovetop stuffing in place of the crackers crumbs. I use bacon or top of meatloaf.

I have been making this recipe for almost 30 years and it's always a hit. My recipe is called "Upside down meatloaf", once its baked you flip it over so the brown sugar/ketchup is on top. I like the other suggestion of mixing the brown sugar ketchup together and putting it on top so you don't need to flip it over.

Great Recipe!! I used half ketchup and half sweet baby rays honey bbq sauce and Since all the reviews said put the sauce on top i actually split it, I spread it out on the bottom then glazed the top with the rest. I also added 1 chopped bell pepper, italian breadcrumbs and equal amount of ground sausage with the ground beef. This was my very first meatloaf and its better than any other ive tried, great recipe

Made two of these and the only thing I did different was bake in a two-piece pan so the fat would drain.  Consequently, the topping went on the top instead of the bottom.  It was delish!!!

I don't normally like meatloaf but I needed a new recipe as I'm also not a master chef! (Ha!) This recipe is amazing! My fiance' is not a fan of big meals so it's hard to get him to eat, but he keeps going back for more every time I make this. Thank you!

My husband and i didn't like this at all but that was probably my fault. I'm a newlywed and just started becoming more domestic and interested in trying new recipes for dinner. I didn't know there are special meatloaf pans designed to separate and catch the grease :( so silly me - I used a regular loaf pan and the meat just bathed in its own grease. It was WAY too greasy and fatty and my poor gallbladder-less body.. Well... Let's just say the meatloaf never stayed down. Learning though! I might make this again in the far future WITH correct pan! Oh, and I would use less onion. Recipe calls for a bit much.. :)

By far the best meat loaf I've ever cooked. I did take the advice of fellow posters and added the sugar and ketchup to the top of he loaf instead of the bottom. Wouldn't change a thing in this recipe.

This is the best meatloaf recipe I have found. I followed the recipe as written except I put the brown sugar and ketchup mixture on top. It is moist with just the right balance of sweet with savory spice.  My very picky BF loved it.  He has requested it over and over.....

I've never made meatloaf before and this recipe was great!! I did follow suggestions and put the sauce on top the last 10 minutes of cooking. I also added a tad of prepared mustard and worshisher sauce to the sauce.

I halved the sugar and it is still much too sweet!  I thought that the sweetness would make it kid-friendly, but my toddlers who usually love meatload wouldn't touch it.  The sugar brings out the onion flavor and makes it very onion-y.

Its good, but a little sweet. I'm thinking of placing the brown sugar on top of the meatloaf & only using 1/4 a cup. But other than the sweetness it was good.

My husband loves this meatloaf, which is saying a lot from a previously non-meatloaf-loving man.  I make the recipe completely as is with the exceptions of- I saute the onions prior to adding them into the mix and add part of the salt to them as they cook.  Without doing this the meatloaf had bit too much crunchy onion for my taste.  Also I cut down the ginger to a pinch, since, for me, the ginger was overpowering otherwise.  This is an awesome recipe that has become a staple in our household!

Ok so I've made this recipe for my family 4 times already, and they LOVE IT! I did add a few things. I out the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom as instructed, but I made a glaze with honey barbecue,ketchup, brown sugar, and a hint of Worcestershire sauce and it makes all the difference! It makes it so much more moist. And as for the meat loaf itself, I added some Worcestershire sauce also. This is definitely a must have in my house once a month.

Meatloaf is my husband's favorite food (I know!!) and this is his favorite meatloaf.  I make it exactly as the recipe states EXCEPT, I put the brown sugar/ketchup mixture on the top of the loaf.

Wonderful meatloaf, loved it! But definitely use more meat than the number of serving sizes you wish for, because it shrinks when it bakes.

Excellent meatloaf!  Makes a bunch, and I think I cooked it a little longer.  I also basted it a few times to  make sure it stayed nice and moist.

I am giving this recipe a 5 for the simple fact that it turned out exactly how it should have, and shouldn't be rated less because of my families taste buds. The meatloaf was way too sweet for my family, but I wanted to try something new. I will not be making it again.

Very Good!  Made a few changes - used 1/2 packet dry onion soup mix (instead of chopped onion), 1/4 C milk, dash Wrst'chire sauce, ketchup/br.sugar mix on top.  Also, put bread slices in bottom of pan to absorb grease.

Good :). Yes I tweaked it but the clincher is the brown sugar/ketchup topping which I never would have come up with.

This is the only meatloaf that I have found that I actually LIKE! It's so good and the whole family loves it. I make modifications as well, I add the 1/4 cup of milk, I omit the minced onion(onion powder in place)  and the ginger. Then I mix the brown sugar and ketchup together and I add salt and chili pepper for I little bite, then I put the bbq sauce on the bottom and top. Super Yummy!!!

I've never had a meatloaf cook in an hour.  This one took 1 hour and 20 minutes.  I used dry oatmeal instead of crackers.  I used the dry onion soup mix instead of real onion.  I do not recommend using the onion soup mix.  I felt this meatloaf was missing some spices.  If you pour the milk in slowly/stir/pour/stir then the milk isn't "too much" as others had stated.  It's still missing a few spices, but other than that, it was thick and tough like a great meatloaf should be!!  Next time, maybe I'll put some of the ketchup and brown sugar IN the meatloaf!! I bet that would be good. 2nd time: I put the brown sugar and ketchup on top and it made the brown sugar crunchy.. not sure what to do with this topping.  I like the loaf though.

I just placed the brown sugar and ketchup sauce on top
This also works great on oven baked chicken.
Just spoon on when the chicken is almost done.

the trick to getting the meatloaf out of the baking tin is to put the serving plate on top of the tin and invert the whole lot. a family favourite now.

Followed some suggestions: Used 1lb, 1/4 milk, 1 egg, 1/2 onion, 1/4 cup crushed saltines, used soy sauce instead of salt, added 1 tbsp of minced garlic, forgot the ginger (will add it next time), added garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, chili powder, and dry mustard. Used 1/4 brown sugar and added 1 tbsp of worcestershire sauce to the ketchup mixture and put it on top of the meatloaf.

This was a delicious meatloaf and the aroma was amazing.  My husband said he couldn't wait to try it and loved it.  I only used 1/4c of milk, which was enough and I should have used 3 eggs.  I added chili powder and used onion flakes because I didn't have fresh onion.  And a touch of Ole Bay Seasoning.  I forgot to take a photo and it went fast!

It was great! I added shredded carrots and spinach to add a little veggies. It was moist and delicious. Even my picky eater 3yr old ate it!

TOTALLY delicious and modifiable.

Brown sugar mix is on top (I use hot BBQ sauce like Lucille's instead of regular ketchup).

Mix 1/2 of the meat with spicy pork sausage.

Have a box of Ritz Crackers sitting around, so used those instead.

Leave out onions (I don't like them) and always forget the ginger, but no loss.

I always make a double batch and freeze one for later.

This is a GOOD recipe and my husband, who like me isn't a big meatloaf fan, loves it!

The only meatloaf my family will eat!  It has changed their response to having meatloaf for dinner from groans to cheers. The omission of mustard from the glaze makes all the difference.  As many reviews suggest, I do not place the glaze under the loaf, but make extra and smother the top.  The only other change aside from various fillers and seasonings (to what I have on hand) is to cook the loaf on top of two pieces of white bread.  This really cuts out the meat simmering in its own grease.  I wouldn't dream of cooking it without foiling the pan first.  Otherwise the sugar-ketchup sauce would be impossible to clean.  Thanks for sharing!

I took the advice of many reviewers--only 1/2 c. milk, added worcestershire sauce to glaze. Added sauteed celery,onion and shredded carrots/butternut squash and 1/2 lb. ground pork/1 lb. ground beef.  The bread in the bottom of the pan to absorb grease was GENIUS!!  Will definitely make this recipe again.

Just another meatloaf.  The ketchup and brown sugar was lost in the fat at the bottom of the pan.  It will be good for sandwiches but it's nothing special.  I'll keep on looking for the "perfect" meatloaf recipe.

Neither my husband nor I have ever liked meatloaf, until now! This was delicious. Loved H2OSmiles compiled list of reviewers' modifications and used them, except for celery . I used 1/4 c Brown sugar and next time I will use less. It was a little too sweet.

Great meatloaf recipe.  The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly.  Some changes I now make are: use 1/3 cup chopped onions.  A whole onion is way too much!  Also, do not bake this in a regular loaf pan!  I learned this the hard way.  The fat has nowhere to drain off to, so the loaf will end up baking in its own fat and it will turn out too greasy.  Use a special meatloaf pan, or form it into a loaf shape on a broiling pan.  Using the leanest meat you have available will also help.

My 6 year old loved it!!!!!!  Now if he likes it...this is definitely a winner.  The only thing I will do differently is cut the brown sugar to 1/4 cup.  I did use onion soup mix and I chopped up some green peppers.  Other than that this recipe was very quick and easy.  The kind I like.  Definitely making this again.  A busy working mom needs quick and delicious meals!

I made this Gluten Free with a few small tweaks and it has become a regular on our table. First we use ground turkey meat 93/7 (this is only because I prefer turkey over beef), and made it per the recipe except we substituted potato flakes for the crushed saltine crackers, and in lieu of the onion I used a package of onion soup mix.  I also added a tbsp of Worcestershire sauce to the ketchup/brown sugar sauce and put it on top of the meatloaf.  My kids also love making mini meatloaves with this recipe, just divide into 6 equal mini meatloaves, pop them on a cookie sheet and cook at the same temp for 45 min.

This was great! First time ever having a meatloaf not turn out dry! My husband and son both loved it! I did make a couple changes, first, I didn't have any crackers or eggs, so I substituted 2T of ground flax seed mixed with 6T water for the eggs, nothing in place of the crackers, and I added some shredded zucchini, diced red pepper (only because it was in the fridge and great way to get the guys to eat veggies), added some garlic powder and put the glaze on top. Delicious! So happy I now know how to make a moist meatloaf!!

First time making meatloaf. I used (broken up) bread pieces instead of crackers, omitted the milk, salt, and ginger, only used 1/2 cup of chopped onions and added 1/2 cup of green peppers. I'd omit the onions and green peppers when I try this again, though ~ too crunchy. Sauce on top was fantastic! Put 1/3 of ketchup and brown sugar mixture in meatloaf and added the rest on top after cooking and heated for 10 minutes more.  Did not put any at bottom of pan.  Served with peas and carrots and mashed potatoes.

Loved this recipe! I had only 1 pound of ground beef, so I mixed it with 2 eggs, 1/2 cup skimmed milk, 1/2 cup bread crumbs, crushed one low fat chicken stock cube (instead of using salt), 1/2 tsp black pepper, 2 tsps onion powder.. I skipped the ketchup and sugar as I decided to make them in the form of burger patties on the stove. It was extremely delish! This recipe is definitely a keeper.. Thank u :)

I love this recipe!! I've been using it for years. I'm not a big fan of ketchup so i prefer Heinz 57 sauce, I believe it cuts down on the sweetness and gives it a bit more of a kick.

This was the best meatloaf I have ever eaten!  The flavor is delicious.  I only improvised two things.  Instead of a regular onion I used a shallot and I mixed in very small pieces of mozzarella.

I've tried many different meatloaf recipes and this is by far the best. It is also the only one my husband will eat. haha I made some slight changes to this recipe however. I typically use a flavored cracker like Ritz Sweethome crackers and I replace the ketchup with a basic BBQ sauce (nothing super sweet/tangy. I also throw in some basil and minced garlic, the amounts for both vary depending on how much I want in the meatloaf. Overall this is a delicious recipe that is made quite often in my house. :)

I'm a new cook and I made this easily and it was very good.  I look forward to making it again.  I halved the recipe and wish I would have made the whole thing!

We LOVED IT! I actually just finished mine and it's my favorite meatloaf recipe from this site so far. I followed the recipe exactly as written with one minor change. About 45 minutes into baking, I drained as much grease as I could out of it and topped the meatloaf with a mixture of A1 sauce, ketchup, and brown sugar for a glaze on top. Even my super picky 5 year old (who, before I even started cooking it, told me he hates meatloaf) asked for seconds. This is definitely a keeper! I've put a layer of bread on the bottom of the pan to minimize the grease in other recipes, so I may try that next time. The grease is really my only complaint, but that's with any meatloaf, really.

This was ssssooooo good.  My family absolutely loves this.  The sauce that the ketchup & brown sugar makes combined with that bit of ginger in the meatloaf is awesome.   The only thing I did differently was cooked it about 25 minutes longer (so almost 90 min vs 60 min).  Thanks for a recipe that's a keeper!

Really really good.  I have made this a few times and it is my go to recipe for meatloaf.  I add shredded carrot and pepper as well as the onion, and I also add a little garlic powder.  I don't use the milk and actually had to use more bread crumbs as the extra veggies make it moister.  Love this meatloaf!

Like this easy recipe. I followed some reviewers' suggestion that put the glaze on the top; tuned out there was lots broth coming out and mixed with the glaze during baking.  I tried to pour out the extra broth and the glaze just mixed with it and slid down.  Besides the mixture of the bloody broth and glaze were just disgusted.  I ended up took all the mixture out and poured the brown sugar/ ketchup mixture on the top of meatloaf in the end when it almost done.

as the plethora of reviewers before me, I added 1 tbs of Worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture along with two cloves of garlic, subbed 1/2 cup of bread crumbs for the saltines, used 1/2 chopped onion and half onion soup mix, and added a liberal amount of oregano and italian seasonings to the meat mixture. I left the brown sugar- ketchup ratio as is (I personally love sweet meat) and thought it was great! Very quick assembly that led to a delicious dinner.

Delicious meat loaf.  Made exactly as per the recipe, except that I ended up putting the brown sugar and ketchup on top.  One reviewer referred to the milk making it too mushy - any meat dish needs about 10 minutes to set.  This meatloaf was a perfect consistency for dinner.  And was perfect for great meatloaf sandwiches for lunch the next day.

This came out great! I took the advice of other reviews and made the ketchup and brown sugar into a paste and put that on top of the meatloaf. I was also feeling lazy so instead of using an onion I just put in the equivelant amount of onion powder. It was moist and flavorful, I will definitly make again.

We love this Meatloaf.  I did not care for meatloaf until I tried this one and it is definitely a 5 Star at our house.  I did make some changes after reading other comments. I put the brown sugar (1/4 cup), ketchup and 1 T Worcestershire on top of meatloaf.  I use an 8 oz can tomato sauce instead of the milk and instead of crackers, I use 3/4 cup Progresso Italian Seasoned Bread Crumbs.

SO, I just made this...and left out the milk!!!! I could not tell though, I got rave reviews, very good.  So if you do not have milk (which we often don't)you should be fine!  When I was mixing the ground beef mixture with everything in it, it was already very moist.  Very good recipe!  
Thank you!

It was good but I like my recipe better. In my recipe I add dry mustard and usually pat the meat mixture out into a rectangle and put shredded cheese in the center, then roll it up and put in pan.  By the way KIMAR; you are supposed to invert it onto a plate, then the brn sugar/ketchup is on top!!!

I have to admit, the ginger was a little puzzling when I read the recipe, but it actually added a nice touch to the meatloaf. I grated some fresh ginger, added some minced garlic, and only used about 1/2 the milk called for. And as others have noted, I made about twice the ketchup/brown sugar mix and put it on top, making more of a glaze. I think it would have dripped through the 2-part loaf pan if I had done as written.

The brown sugar and ketchup glaze is very good and I put it on both the bottom of the pan and the top as I think the glaze on top seeps into the meat for more flavor. This was the first meatload recipe I ever made that called for milk and it's something I will be omitting in the future, it made it a little too mushy for my liking.

I put the brown sugar and ketchup on the top. The only thing I would change is cutting down on the sugar to half what it called for. It was a little too sweet for us.

I really enjoyed this recipe - and I typically hate meatloaf! I was told it was the best meatloaf my boyfriend and his mother ever had! I know it was the best I've had. The one thing I did different, as suggested by other reviewers, was to put the sauce mixture on top of the meatloaf too. The sauce on the bottom didn't stick to the loaf; I guess because of the grease? The next time I make this ill place the sauce on the bottom And TOP of the loaf. Bottom line, This recipe was great!

I made this for a big family gathering. Everyone was raving. I added green peppers, onions and garlic sauteed in butter to the mixture. I also took others' suggestion to add a tablespoon of worchestershire sauce to the ketchup topping. I used the ketchup sauce as a topping instead of putting it in the bottom. Thanks for the recipe!

This is the best meatloaf I have every had. I normally am not a big meatloaf fan, but decided to try it out. I definitely prefer this to other meatloaf recipes and appreciate the sweeter taste from the ketchup and brown sugar. Howver, I do agree with other reviewers that you should put the brown sugar and ketchup on top because I had an issue with it sticking to the bottom of the pan when I was trying to serve the meatloaf. Overall, great recipe.

Very tasty and simple to make. I am not a meatloaf fan but I do like this recipe. The only thing I changed was to mix ketchup and brown sugar together and poured it on top of the hamburger.

Great recipe! Quick and easy. Instead of putting the ketchup and brown sugar at the bottom, I mix it together and glaze the top of the meatloaf. The kids and hubby love it!!!

I tried this recipe.Left out the ginger and added a little chopped celery.I also added a little season salt.I put two slices of bread on the bottom of loaf pan as suggested in another review and put Sweet Baby Ray's Honey Barbecue sauce on the top.I did not put any ketchup or brown sugar in the meatloaf itself. Very good, will defintely make this again! Husband thought it was very good.

Love it. The family loves the taste of this meatloaf. I only made one small change. It is still the same ingredients but I miss then all together instead of layering it. I tried both ways (layering and mixing) and like the mixed better. Great Recipe.

I think this is the best Meatloaf recipe ever!!!! This is now my only meatloaf recipe! I give this recipe a 5 star rating just the way it is! I can't stand it when others end up adding a boat load of other ingredients to a recipe and end up changing it completely. The recipes should be rated as written! And with that Thank You so much for this fabulous Meatloaf, I'm making it again tonight!

This meatloaf was very bland. I cooked it in a casserole pan and not a loaf pan. I spread the brown sugar and ketchup mixture all over the top of the meatloaf. I had concerns about this meatloaf from the beginning, because the mixture is way too wet for my liking. I modified the mixture by adding additional crackers to suck up the wetness. The highlight of this entire dish was that the brown sugar and ketchup coating reminded me of baked beans.

We make a similar meatloaf with brown sugar in the bottom of the pan, no ketchup. We mix about a table spoon of BS in with the meat mix, then cover with plan ketchup and bake. I have a meatloaf mix that I swear by so did not follow the recipe here for the meat mix. We can't get enough of this. Not sure why such bad comments.

I've tried a few meatloaf recipes, and this one is the best! I am no longer searching for new ones. We loved it, even my husband and my niece, who don't even like meatloaf in general! Thank you for sharing.

We make the loaf in a glass dish and then put the glaze on top. Save some for sandwiches its that good! Also, we double the recipe. I like to add extra ginger to the glaze as well. Fantastic

This meatloaf smelled SO good while in the oven!! My dog was literally going crazy because of it. Instead of putting the ketchup and brown sugar on the bottom, I put it on top of the meat loaf. If you don't have saltines on hand, like I did, Ritz crackers work really well. As for the taste, it is very similar to many other meatloaf recipes, but it tasted really good and my family enjoyed it.

Followed directions as close as I could with what I had. Didn't have ginger so didn't use that, and used Stove Top in lieu of crackers. I put the brown suger and ketchup, and added Worcestershire sauce to the bottom of the pan as well as the top of the meatloaf. Also added cooked onion and green pepers. HUGE hit with the family!

WAY too sweet for our tastes. Well, except for my 5 yr old...he loved it. Meatloaf itself was good but need to adjust the amount of brown sugar next time. Thanks for a good idea...

I became a memeber because of this recipe. I was so looking forward to sweet and savory. Like another user suggested, I mixed the ketchup and brown sugar mixture directly into the meatloaf. BIG mistake! I had to use other ingredients to give it some spice but the sweet was overpowering. I am giving this one more star because it was better the next day. However, my kid loved it!

Best meatloaf I have had in a very long time. I used ground turkey and did not have any eggs on hand. I also did not want to us crackers, so I crumbled about three slices of wheat bread, I also took others tip of only using 1/2 cup milk and onion soup mix in lieu of fresh onion. I also put a little brown sugar in the meat mixture along with some ketchup and worchestire sauce...turned out excellent! Yum!

This was delicious, Im not  big on meat loaf but I will be making this again, my family love the taste. I read the reviews which helped. I placed brown sugar and ketchup on top of the meat loaf so when it cooked the brown sugar melted into the meat.  At first I wasnt sure how brown sugar and ketchup would taste. together it was a delightful surprise !

A hit with my 4 boys & husband! I changed it by putting the ketchup/brown sugar on top - and reduced the brown sugar to 1/4 cup ... I may make it a couple tablespoons next time. I also added Worcestershire to the meat mix. Good stuff!

Wonderful recipe! I had no problem with flavour absorption from the bottom of the pan. Very sweet and tasty. "To die for" says uncle. incredibly easy to make; ten minutes and youre done. Great recipe thank you!

It was pretty good. My step-dad's meatloaf is better but I think he adds a few things this recipe is lacking. Not sure what. My husband really liked it regardless though.

Great recipe. I added diced green peppers, used bread crumbs and used ground meatloaf mix (beef, pork & veal). I also added 1 tablespoon of worchester sauce in the meatloaf as well as 1 tablespoon in the brown sugar/ketsup sauce. Yumm!

First time in years I did meatloaf... and this recipe was wonderful.  I did check some of the reviews and made my own changes... 1/4 C br sugar instead of 1/2, spaghetti sauce instead of ketchup, 1/2 C of milk instead of 3/4 and I added worchester sauce and Dijon mustard.  I also used a pkg of dried onion soup mix instead of onion. (I took these tips from some reviews... and because I had them on hand instead of cracker crumbs, I used red pepper crackers... it was delicious and I will definitely do it again... a good recipe for company and it can be prepared ahead of time.  A lot of changes but it was well worth it...Also I put some of the glaze into the meat and put the remainder on top. Thanks

This recipe was absolutely delicious!  I made a few changes though.  I changed the milk to 1/2 cup, added 1 tbsp. of worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture.  I also put the brown sugar on top and let it cook.  I then added the ketchup for the last 10 mins. or so of baking.  YUMMY!!

This was amazing... I only had 1 lb of ground beef so I only added 1/2 a cup of milk and a cup of (whole wheat) saltine crackers.  I also grated about 1/4 cup of baby carrot into it and used fresh grated ginger!  I used Coconut Organic Sugar and mixed it with the ketchup and used it on top instead of on the bottom.  I chose to make them in muffin tins and top with a cauliflower/cheese mash icing! (steamed cauliflower, butter, garlic powder, cheddar and parm cheese). They tasted as good as they looked!!!

We really enjoyed this recipe and will make it again. I tweaked the recipe by adding two cloves of garlic, 1 tsp worcestershire sauc and I decreased the sugar to 1/4 cup. I picked the smallest onion at the store but it was still too much. I had a ton of onion in every bite so I'd cut that down.

Wonderful!!! I put the brown sugar and the ketchup over the top of the meatloaf instead of the bottome as others suggested. It was moist and even better the next day as left overs. I followed the receipe to a T and it worked great. This is now my families favorite meatloaf recipe.

After reading many of the reviews, I made some minor adjustments suggested by others: I baked the loaf on top of two end slices of a bread loaf, which soaked up all the fat; I spooned the sugar/ketchup mixture on top; and I topped with thick cut bacon slices.  My husband said it was the best meatloaf he'd ever had!

I made this today and it was great.  I have been looking for the perfect meatloaf and this is it.  I did change one thing, I used plain bread crumbs instead of saltine crackers.  Flavorful and fast...My kind of recipe!

It was fantastic! Best meatloaf ever. Did what others suggested and put the brown sugar and ketchup at the top and used bread ends to line the bottom of the pan. Yum!

The husband and I loved it. Great flavor! Instead of ground beef, I used the 3-way meatloaf mix, and I also threw in fresh garlic and bread crumbs because I didn't have saltines. Delicious. Would definitely make this again.

This was delicious! My son even ate it and he's not a fan of meatloaf. I read through the reviews and I too tweaked it a bit. I used 1/4 cup of all ingredients,used onion soup mix, 1 egg, added a few splashes of worcestershire sauce and I used seasoned bread crumbs instead of crackers.  I also added spinach to my loaf and spread the glaze on top.  I served it over yellow rice and it was yummy!

I am making this for dinner today!  We have had it twice before and it is delicious!  Everyone saying that the ketchup and brown sugar should be on the top truly need to try it the way the recipe calls for.  It comes right out of the pan and is just delicious!  I will never make another meatloaf again, only this one!  And then I make sandwiches for my husband's lunch the next day.  And then it's pretty much gone!  Delicious!  I serve it with AuGratin Potatoes and Salad.  Can't wait for dinner now!

This recipe was delicious!! I think the ketchup in the bottom was supposed to cook firm onto the meatloaf, but it ended up being a thin sauce I just drizzled over. My meatloaf turned nice and soft with about 1hr 10 min in the oven. It tasted delicious! Loved the brown sugar. I added worcetshire and a couple cloves of chopped garlic. Soooo tasty! Served up with sweet potato fries so it was a "sweet" meal for sure.

Very good recipe. I put the brown sugar mixture on top and used bread crumbs instead of cracker crumbs. I use ground venison and it's sooo good!

I followed the recipe to a tee but we did not enjoy this meatloaf. It was moist but very bland.

This was delicious! I poured the ketchup/sugar glaze on top instead of the bottom, used italian breadcrumbs in place of crackers and used onion powder instead of chopped. It was sooo good, mmmm that glaze!

This recipe is really nice, even my husband and I (who are VERY picky about meatloaf) and a few of our teenagers (who said they didn't like meatloaf) absolutely LOVE it. My husband told me to make sure that I don't loose the recipe. I altered it a bit to satisfy some of our pickiness (scallion onions in place of regular onions, dicing up carrots and potatoes and adding those) really spice it up (and make it a bit healthier)

This Meatloaf turned out Great!!! I read the reviews and did use some of the other ideas.. I used French Onion Soup mix instead of chopped onion, used bread crumbs instead of crackers, no ginger so just didnt use it... Kept the Brown sugar on the bottom.. It turned out perfect.. Would cook it again..

Easy and well suited to adjusting as necessary. It tasted a bit bland but that may be due to not having Saltine crackers and substituting goldfish crackers in their place.

I have made this recipe twice now and just love it.  Of course like any cook, I have changed it up a bit... I put the glaze on top and because I always seem to be in a hurry, I make it in muffin tins. It cooks so much faster and I find the portion control helps me when my self control fails ;). Instead of saltine crumbs, I use corn flakes crumbs. They add a nice twist. 
My kids love it, my husband loves it and the leftovers the next day are yummy!

I love this recipe! It's the only meatloaf recipe I use! I also put the glaze on top adding the worchestershire sauce, and instead of crackers I use panko and add some salt and italian seasoning to the mix. I make mini "mountains" on a cookie sheet with the dough and pour the glaze over the top, cook at 350 for 45 minutes, its less messy than the muffin tins and tastes delicious! thank you so mnuch for the recipe!! Im the only one in my extended family whos allowed to make meatloaf! :)

Yummmm!..this is the best meatloaf we have tried so far. I put the sauce on top and added garlic powder to the meat and about 1 tbs of worcestershire sauce to the meat and the sauce as suggested. It was so good even my picky kidoes liked it. :)

Turned out GREAT! My wife loved it!

The brown sugar-catsup topping was excellent and I recommend doubling it.  The meatloaf itself was bland and uninteresting.  Use your regular meatloaf recipe but by all means do the catsup brown sugar bottom.  I made a 2 1/2 pound meatloaf and baked it in a round springform.  It made a beautiful presentation which I call Upside Down Meatloaf

Love this simple easy recipe.  The brown sugar really sets this one off.  I also apply the ketchup and brown sugar on top of the meatloaf.

I had a few problems with it, mainly it taking an hour and a half to bake. But i made a few modifications: Added two pieces of bread at the bottom of the loaf pan to absorb some of the grease, I added one clove garlic to the meat mixture, and i used only 1/2 cup of brown sugar and mixed it with the ketchup to put on top of the meatloaf before baking it. After it was finally done it had good flavor and texture. next time I will budget for longer baking time and add a full 3/4 cup of brown sugar. Nick loved it more than I did, but after all, it is meatloaf.

This is a tasty meatloaf and very moist.  I only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  The next time I make it, I would put the brown sugar and ketchup on top of the meat loaf not the bottom as they stick to the pan when you slice it.

I made this is was very, very good!  I did what some other people said and put the brown sugar on top of the meatloaf and then the ketcup on top; it was great!  I didn't have enough ground beef so I subsistuted 1/2 pound of sage pork sauage.  I thought that it added more flavor; next time I will use all just beef instead.  Worth making again!

This recipe is my favorite! I usually only use about a pound of meat and bread crumbs instead of saltines, which improves it in my opinion.  I also leave out the onions sometimes--my husband's preference.

This recipe was okay for me.  I didn't care for the ginger taste and it seemed really sweet.  I like more of a burger flavor type meat loaf.  One child liked it and the other hated it but he did eat it so it wasn't that bad.

It wasn't bad, I thought that there should have been more meat and less of the other ingredients.

This was absolutely delicious!  Like others, I did tweak it some.  Plus, we are hunters so I used deer burger instead. :)

Nothing more to add except I tried the recipe "as is" and it was fantastic!  The brown sugar/ketchup/grease from the meat glaze was so awesome! A must try recipe that's as easy as it is delicious! :^d!

This was the best meatloaf I have ever had; my husband and kids even liked it! I made three changes though, instead of tomato sauce I used spaghetti sauce from a jar. I left out the onions since my husband is allergic to onions. Also, I added some garlic powder.

I love this recipe, I have made it so many times and it is always excellent. I use bread crumbs instead of crackers and soak them in the milk first and then add them to the mixed meat. This makes your meat loaf moist. I do not put the sauce on the bottom, instead I put about 3 tablespoons of it in the meat and mix it around. The rest I spoon  on the top of my meat loafs for the last 15 minutes of cooking.  like other reviewers I used a large muffin tin to make individual loafs. 350 for 30 mins and then put the sauce on top and cooked for another 10 to 15 min. Delicious every time.

I have been making a similar topping for my meatloaf for years and hubby loves it.  I follow this recipe but I add a heaping tablespoon of zuchini relish to ketcup and brown sugar.  I always add to meatloaf top in the last 15 minutes........AFTER I drain off grease.  yum

Came up great. As other review suggested decreased milk to 1/4 cup, 1/4 cup brown sugar and a splash of worcestershire sauce into ketchup topping that was spread on top.

The brown sugar and ketchup give the meat a sweet, juicy flavor.  I substituted onion soup mix for the onions and left out the salt and pepper and instead of cracker crumbs, I used panco bread crumbs.  It was a big hit with my menfolk

Easy, Easy, Easy to make! This is exactly the way I remember meatloaf growing up. My toddler loved it he ate two large slices and he's not a meat eater. My husband was very pleased by the flavor and I was pleased by how easy this recipe is to make. Also a very budget friendly recipe.

My husband and I loved this. It was super easy to prep and just toss in the oven. Not to mention quick clean up. He thought it was perfect, I think maybe just a tiny bit too sweet. Definitely will make this again though, but with maybe just a little less brown sugar.

I loved this meatloaf!!!! It was my very first attempt at making a meatloaf.  It was easy to make, I took the advise I read on here, and put 2 pieces of bread at the bottom of the pan and I had zero grease when I was all done.  Also I layered the ketchup mixture, I did half the meat then 1/3rd of the ketchup spread over it, then topped with the other half of the meat, followed by the rest of the ketchup mixture.  My mom has never liked meatloaf, and is the biggest meatloaf critic I know.  She ate it, loved it, and told me to keep the recipe, I am now the "official" meatloaf maker for family get togethers.

The meatloaf part was really good.  That portion of the recipe I will use again.  The brown sugar/ketchup part was way too sweet, and they just didn't go well together.

I loved this recipe! The meatloaf came out SO moist and evenly cooked and was such great comfort food! I added my own little touches though: I wanted to get some veggies in my meatloaf so I finely chopped up an onion, 1 whole carrot and 2 stalks celery. I cooked them in some vegetable oil just until they were nice and sweated down. I cooled the veggies down and added it to the meat mixture with some Italian seasoning and garlic. I also used bread crumbs instead of crackers. With the glaze, I also wanted it to be on top of the meatloaf instead of the bottom. So I just mixed up the brown sugar and ketchup with a little Worsteshire sauce and added it on top of the meatloaf the last 15 minutes of cooking. This recipe is such a great base for adding your own twist to meatloaf!

Great meatloaf. Mine always comes out really hearty like thick, wonder if I over pack (if that's possible). Anyways boyfriend eats almost all of it but claims he HATES meatloaf when I mention making it, so obviously this is a good one. I love it! However I dont put the mixture on the bottom, just the top. Oh and I add diced green peppers because that's how my grandma does it and hers is the best :-)

The perfect meatloaf!  The family loved it.  I didn't have saltines so I used bread crumbs and only had 1/2 the amount of ketchup so used chili sauce and put it on top.  It was excellent!  My family of 4 devoured the entire loaf so I'm glad I decided to double the recipe.  We'll definitely make this again.

I made a double batch.  Substituted 2 cups of oatmeal in place of the 
1 1/2 cups of crushed crackers. I also used more onion. Great recipe.

This was my first time making meatloaf and it was very easy.  Once it was cooked there seemed to be a lot of juice in the loaf pan, but I was assured by my fiance that this can be normal.  It was very delicious and the brown sugar was a nice touch.  I recommend cooking it an extra 5 to 10 minutes than the recipe calls for though to make sure all the meat gets cooked.

My husband and I love this meatloaf. I have made it many times...the first time I followed others' advice and mixed up the ketchup and brown sugar, then put the mixture on top of the meatloaf (instead of spreading it in bottom of pan), and have done it that way ever since. I've also done different things with it, such as added some minced garlic, one time I even added some pepperjack cheese! It's always wonderful. It's a very easy recipe to customize using the basic ingredients listed here.

This was a great recipe, we scaled it for two. It turned out perfect and was so yummy. I saved it and plan on making it again soon!

I made this for dinner and everyone loved it.  I did make a second mixture of the ketchup and brown sugar so I could add it to the top for the last 10 min of cooking.

I am not a fan of meatloaf but this recipe along with other reviewer suggestions have changed my mind. The onion soup mix along with the brown sugar and ketchup on top of the loaf make this meal very flavorful. This is now in my regular rotation of recipes.

Too sweet for me but DH loved it.  I loved the texture though.  Will definitely make again but will not use the brown sugar next time.

DELICIOUS!! I tried this recipe and of course tweeked it like others stated, using ground beef and ground chicken and also putting the ketchup mixed with worchestershire sauce and brown sugar on top and it came out perfect. I will definately make this one again because my family ate it in one serving. I'll double it the next time. Thanks for this one!!

I've made this a couple of times and each time, have stuck pretty closely to the recipe (any changes were insignificant).  This was really good!  Great recipe for the night it's prepared or, better yet, double it and freeze half for another night.  Biggest change made was that I mixed the brown sugar/ketchup and topped the raw meatloaf with it (vs. putting it on bottom).  Very good!!!!!

This is the easiest and best meatloaf ever.  I discovered it here, going on 3 years ago.  It has never failed to be firm (yet moist), delicious, and crowd-pleasing.  No matter what minor variations may have to be made for whatever reason--this is the best basic recipe EVER!  Thanks Tangastar!!

Good flavor, but the topping (I put the brown sugar, ketchup mixture on top) was WAY too sweet even though I reduced some of the brown sugar.

My husband HATED this meatloaf and complained it was too sweet. I on the other hand LOVED it and would make it again in a minute. It was very good. Instead of using crackers, I added some Stove Top stuffing to the ground beef and mixed it up. Sooo yummy!

With the modifications from other users this turned out great. Modifications included about 3/4 cup of Italian breadcrumbs instead of saltines, a tbsp of Worchestershire sauce, and lots of garlic! Be warned that it does leave alot of juices, i think i will try the whole bread at the bottom of the pan, or else your loaf is swimming in juice. Other than that this is a great recipe

This is a great recipe.  I've made it at least 4 times now.  I follow the recipe exactly, except I don't measure the brown sugar or ketchup.  I just sprinkle and drizzle it on.  I have also been making it in two loaf pans instead of just one because it took FOREVER to cook the first time.  Also, I maybe I'm no using a small enough onion, because it ends up with a LOT of onion in it.  I think half an onion is plenty (I use a sweet onion), and this last time I sateed the onion first and thought the flavor was better.

Nice recipe!  I made a few changes as per some previous reviewers:
- used 1/4 cup of brown sugar
- added 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to the ketchup/brown sugar mix
- used 1/2 cup of milk and 1 egg
- added 2 cloves of garlic to the meat mixture
- added some chopped celery
- used a cup of season bread crumbs instead of crackers
I didn't use a loaf pan, but rather formed it into a pyrex dish and coated with the ketchup/bbq/worcester mix.
Yummy and will make again! (even my kids liked it!)

This was a great loaf, but the topping is much too sweet as is.  I had 2 lbs of meat, so I increased everything else in the loaf proportionally (I used 3 eggs).  I didn't have crumbs, so I used oatmeal, and I used fried onions because I had them already.  I baked them as 8 individual loaves (45 min) and 1 larger loaf (1 hr), and they were so soft and moist, just marvelous!  I don't keep ketchup in the house, though, so I used a small can of tomato paste and added onion powder and 1/4 c. sugar.  It was so sweet, I had to cut it with another can.  I know this has sugar in the title, but when I made it the first time (I think with no changes to the sugar), I couldn't stomach the sweetness of the topping.

We've tried around a half-dozen meatloaf recipes. THIS recipe will be the one we make from now on! Very delicious and re-warms great for leftovers. Most other recipes we had tried had a dry onion soup mix packet mixed in and this one does not, which I prefer.
The brown sugar gives it a wonderful sweetness that I love as well.

Pretty good - DD said it was a bit bland though, and she normally only likes bland things!  I'll definitely make it again, but add more seasoning next time.

So good! There is rarely any leftovers! Though I don't do the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom, I make it a glaze on the top so then it's even better!

I use the basic recipe given except I add in place of an onion, a pack of instant onion soup mix, and use seasoned bread crumbs. Adds more flavor I think. And also, put the glaze on the top. My family loves it this way:-))

This did not turn out.  It was way too sugary, crumbly (did not stick together like a loaf).  Meatloaf should not be this sweet.

This is by far the best meatloaf I've ever had. I only used 1/4 c. milk and the consistancy was perfect. I used the brown sugar and ketchup as a glaze on the top and added it during the last 20 minutes of cooking.

"Anything that is called a loaf should not have meat in it" ... that's what my friend used to say, not anymore though!! This is my go to meatloaf recipe and everyone LOVES it.  It is so simple too.  The brown sugar and ketchup definitely belong on the bottom, don't second guess it, just make this recipe, you  wont regret it.

This was by far, one of the best meatloafs I have ever had. I used what I had on hand...Ritz crackers instead of saltines, 1 lb of regular ground beef, and left out the milk.It was delish! My husband almost ate all of it by himself!! We couldn't get enough!!

Best meatloaf recipe ever! Only changes I made were to make extra of the brown sugar glaze and spread it over the top instead of the bottom. Also I prefer to shape it into a loaf in a 13x9 dish so it's not sitting in it's own grease.

Very good with a few changes. I also put the ketchup and brown sugar on top. Added 2 cloves of garlic, minced. I cook my meatloaf on a cooling rack set on top of another pan like a pie plate that way while the meat cooks the fats drip down and it doesn't come out mushy on the bottom, better for you too.

De-lish. I agree with other comments, sauce is needed on top. A little on bottom doesn't hurt, but the topping is where it's at! My fiance loves it when the sauce carmelizes a bit, & had a suggestion from our chef friend: use an 8x8 pan instead of a loaf. More surface area equals mopre yummy saucy topping! Going to try that tonight!

My boyfriend really liked the meatloaf, but I thought it could have more flavor.  Could be my fault.  I tried doubling the recipe, but I think I should have used a little more than double of the spices.  Will definitely make again.

I rarely review the recipes I find on here, but THIS one is just amazing!!  It is the only meatloaf I'll make now, its a huge hit with my entire family, including the kids!  I put the ketchup and brown sugar on the bottom and never have a problem.  I let it sit for a bit before taking it out of the pan though, there tends to be a lot of grease.  LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS!!!

Hubby LOVED this. As with the other reviews, I put the glaze on the top instead of the bottom. I used very little brown sugar in the glaze, probably only about 1/8C, a couple squeezes of ketsup (not much was left), so I subbed with steak sauce and hot sauce, and it turned out awesome! Also, whoever put the trick with the bread at the bottom of the pan was a genius! I had one piece, and it was moist and delicious and not greasy at all.  The rest, hubby ate :)

I, for one, LOVED this. My husband does not like sweet anything on meat, like sweet & sour and the like, so I figured he might not like this much and I was right. I did lower the amount of brown sugar. I will make this again w/o the glaze but regretfully and might have to actually make two, one for him and one for me because I really, really love the flavor and the sweetness of the meatloaf in this recipe and the fact that it's totally moist and yummers. Great thing to make on a cold rainy day like I did. Fills the house with a beautiful aroma. One thing I did though that I kind of regret was use beef that wasn't lean and there was nearly a full mug of beef fat that I strained off from one loaf. I adore the stuff but I'm over 40 and it's not good for me. Next time I'll do as one reviewer did and use part beef part ground turkey. Again, it was friggin' delish but hubby didn't like the flavor but the texture was spot-on.

Great recipe simple and easy although I changed this a little by adding bbq sauce in the hamburger mixture and on top of the meatloaf, it really brings out the brown sugar flavor!!! My husband loves it so much that we made it a weekly dish!

Yum!  I just got done making and eating this recipe and it is amazing!  Moist and delicious! I used a packet of onion soup mix instead of chopped onions.  I'm trying not to eat the entire 1.5 lbs.

I never liked meatloaf before...but I had 2 slices of this!!! It was a little too sweet, needs less brown sugar, and I put the ketchup mixture on the top and used celery in the recipe and put bread crumbs on the bottom of the pan as well. But it turned out great!!

Delicious! I'm a huge meatloaf fan and this one was very tasty. I'm making it for the second time as I'm writing this! The only change I made was following another reviewer's advice and putting a slice of bread on the bottom of the pan to catch the grease and instead spreading the ketchup/brown sugar mix on top of the loaf. It makes a big difference in the amount of grease you have at the end. Very good!

This is the best meatloaf I've ever tasted, but I did do a few things differently. I agree with the other reviewers that the ketchup and brown sugar is better on the top. Also, to make things easier, I used a packet of dried onion soup mix instead of having to chop an onion. The soup mix also has plenty of salt and seasoning already in it, so I didn't need to use salt and pepper. Instead of cracker crumbs, I usually use plain bread crumbs or crushed croutons. One thing I have noticed - I do not taste the ginger at ALL in this recipe. I don't know if it is because I use the onion soup mix and maybe the flavor gets lost in it, or if the recipe should call for more ginger. I've tried making it with and without the ginger and I taste no difference.

I also put the brown sugar/ketchup mixture on top. This is the BEST meatloaf recipe I have made. Family LOVED it. They usually do not like meatloaf, but this one is a true WINNER. I followed the directions exact, with the one exception, just putting the brown sugar/ketchup on top.

This is the only meatloaf I will ever eat. I hated meatloaf before, but this is soo soo yummy! Definitely use less sugar with the ketchup. I put a little sugar and more ketchup in the meatloaf itself. It's always juicy and delicious. There are never any leftovers of this meal at my house!

Normally I don't like meatloaf, but this one was fabulous! I took some user's advice and altered a few things (1/4 cup brown sugar, 1tbsp worcestershire sauce, 1 egg, 1/2 cup milk, and the brown sugar mixture on top).

I was looking forward to this recipe with all of the positive reviews, however it was rendered almost inedible due to the sweetness of the glace. The meat itself was delicious and moist, however we ended up having to scrap off all of the glaze to enjoy it. I would not make this again with the brown sugar.

Love this recipe and make it often!  I use 1 cup of breadcrumbs instead of the crackers and put half the brown sugar/ketchup mix on bottom and half on top.  Delicious!  It's in my oven right now!

Every time I make this recipe there is never any left over!. However I do not put the brown sugar/ketchup mixture on the bottom, I don't want all the fat mixing with it. So I just spoon it on top and it turns out great!!

I was afraid this recipe might be to sweet for my taste, but I loved it. I thought it had just the right amount of sweetness.

Great recipe.  I followed a few reviews - put bread on bottom, it soaked up all the grease.  Put sauce on top instead of bottom.  I also doubled the sauce recipe and adding worchershire to the sauce.  The extra sauce I heated up on the stove and put on the table.  It seemed a bit sweet so I may cut back on the brown sugar a little next time.

I made this recipe today. I thought it was very good. Like others, I put the ketchup and brown sugar on the top. This prevented it from being mixed with the grease.

I tried the original recipe and although it was very good, we felt like it was missing something. I altered the recipe using the following changes and my whole family absolutely loved it!!! 
First I formed the meat mix into meatballs instead of a loaf  and used onion soup mix in place of the raw onions used in the original recipe. I also added 1 tsp of worchestershire sauce and omitted the ginger. I covered the loaf with 1/2c of b sugar and 1/2 c chili sauce mixed together(some family members do not like ketchup) instead of placing it at the bottom. It was absolutely DELICIOUS!!! The original recipe would get only 3 stars for us here, but the revisedc version definately gets all 5 stars!

This is always a hit when I make it.  I've made a few changes to the recipe.  I use ground turkey and since I'm not a fan of ketchup I use tomato sauce.  I also use breadcrumbs in place of the saltines.

Delicious! Took the advise of others...Tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce in meat mix. Sauted the onions & 1-2 minced garlic. Cut the salt a bit because I added a splash of soy sauce. Cut the milk to less than 1/2 cup meat was already moist. For the topping ketchup mix I also added a tablespoon Worcestershire sauce used a little over 1/4 cup brown sugar mixed and pour over meatloaf before baking. Loved it!

We really liked the sauce, but thought the meatloaf itself was sort of uninteresting.  I made extra sauce to dip the bites of meatloaf in and that helped, but I won't be making this again unless I have extra ground beef around and am running short on other ingredients.  It wasn't bad - just didn't catch our fancy with so many other tasty recipes on this site.

I used Italian bread crumbs rather than the spices and saltines. Put the glaze on the top at the end for the last 10 minutes and it worked great. I might cut the onions smaller next time.

This meatloaf was delicious but I thought that 1 1/2 tsp of salt was way too much. And like some of the other reviews I prefer the brown sugar and ketchup on top bcuz I like to put carrots around my meatloaf and they didn't taste very good after soaking in all that brown sugar but otherwise delicious!

Delicious. I left out the onion and ginger simply because I didn't have it. So good and easy to make. My kid and hubby request it at least once a week. I tried another recipe that called for the brown sugar and ketchup to be placed as a glaze on top. I prefer to cook it the way this recipe describes -- on the bottom.

My husband's mom has spoiled him with her cooking. Ever since we got married, he's always telling me how his mom made everything so I can make it like hers. I made this recipe last night, and he said not to tell his mom, but this was the best meatloaf he ever had. This is definitely a keeper! I did put the glaze on top though, and it turned out great!

Well, it was ok. But like many people have said, it is not worth making-once done, cannot be undone. 

Even though I added 1/4 bell peppers, it was still woefully plain. And the brown sugar/ketchup layer I added on top was obviously ketchup. 

I suggest you add your own seasoning in the mix, including garlic, cayenne, mustard, etc. And prob the brown sugar and ketchup in the meatloaf as well. Then a film layer of brown sugar on top to glaze.

This recipe is awesome, I did add 1 red bell pepper to it, and increase the amount of bread crumbs since the red pepper caused more moisture.  The guys at work love it.

I've made this recipe many times. It is the best meatloaf recipe out there that I have found. For all of you venison eaters, it also works well with ground venison. I still use some beef with it so you get a little beef fat in there for taste.  Maybe a 70/30 ratio of venison/beef. Good way to use up some of the ground venison in your freezer! 
Like many other reviewer's I also put the brown sugar/ketchup on the top.

I found this recipe looking for something different to do with hamburger I needed to use. My husband decided he was starving so I didn't have an hour to cook it as meatloaf but I really wanted to try it, so I went the sloppy Joe route. :) I made the meat mixture per the recipe except I left the milk out (not sure if that mattered) and used onion powder instead of chopped onions. I mixed the sauce in a bowl, cooked the meat mixture in a skillet and added the sauce at the last minute. Served it on a hamburger bun, it was good! I will definitely try it in the correct meatloaf mode! My husband put cheese on his hamburger bun, yum!  I will say if you try it this way use the lowest fat content hamburger you can. I already had 93/7 ground beef, but there was no grease to drain in the pan at the end. Yikes! It didn't look or taste greasy at all though. End result it was fast, easy, and good!

I absolutely love the technique of putting the brown sugar and ketchup at the bottom of the loaf pan.  When you flip it onto the serving tray, the sweet juices run down the sides.  I have never had better meatloaf ever!  And I loved the crunchy meat bottom.  Heaven!

I've made this recipe numerous times now and love it. My husband won't let me even try another recipe!  It will be one of those recipes I pass down to my children. Wonderful.

The meat itself tasted good, but I didn't like the brown sugar at all. I don't know if I did something wrong but it melted and invaded the whole meat loaf and became entirely too sweet. Also the ketchup needs to be substituted for something less sweet as well.

I'm not normally a big meatloaf fan, but this was great!  I used BBQ sauce because I didn't have ketchup and heavy cream b/c I was out of milk (and only 1/4 cup).  I accidentally forgot the onion and added about a tbsp of worchestshire to the meat mixture.  I put it in muffin tins and cooked for 45 min.  I added the brown sugar/BBQ sauce mixture to both the bottom and top of each meatloaf "muffin", though I would recommend waiting until the last 15 min or so for the sauce on top otherwise it goes everywhere.  I would also recommend putting a cookies sheet below the muffin tin in the oven if you go this route to catch any grease.  I will definitely make this again!

This was my first meatloaf and hubby now is already plans for the next one, it was that good! The only thing I added was a small apple to the mixture only to help the moisture, but w/out it I think it would have been fine too! Awesome :)

Finally!  I have a meatloaf recipe I can eat!  Mom used to make a similar recipe that was decent.  But I don't like meatloaf.  Hubby loves it!  So to give him a treat since I have been gone on vacation without him for three weeks (he had to work), I made this recipe for the first night I was back.  I did add the brown sugar/ketchup to the top as suggested by another reviewer.  I do not like the soft, mushy type meatloaf, so I usually cook it flatter so it will brown and have less chance to get mushy--more liquids bake out of it.  I greased an 8" iron skillet, put the meatloaf in, spread it flat in the middle heaping up the sides a little more than the middle, mixed about 1/4 cup of the meatloaf mixture in with the brown sugar mixture, and poured it over the top.  (I had to use CheezIt White Cheddar crackers since I had no other crackers in the house.)  The recipe was very, very good.  The top browned nicely, and it was more crispy (like I like it).  The CheezIt crackers did it no favors (made it mushy), and I will plan to use hard crackers next time.  It was excellent, and I actually had a second, small serving (which I never have done with meatloaf in my life!)  I will definitely use this recipe again and again.  Thanks!  

Next time, I think I will try some flavored crackers--garlic, basil or ?

This is the best meatloaf we've ever tasted! I use fresh crumbed bread, a packet of onion soup mix and whatever's on hand- the other day it was a handful of grated cheese. It's always a winner and makes great leftover. My variation is I microwave it for 10 minutes. It's moist, soft and succulent best of all no hard edges - yummy!

I added some additional seasonings to my meat like I was making hamburgers and also put the ketchup/brown sugar on top like others said.  It was delicious! My husband asked for a little less brown sugar next time to make the topping less sweet (but I loved it :)

This is awesome!  My husband has been begging me to make a meatloaf and I was dragging my feet because I have never been a fan.  I made this a couple of weeks ago and I couldn't get enough.  I'm making it again tomorrow!

I made some modifications to this recipe based on other reviews. I cut the milk to 1/4 cup, added a little less brown sugar (around 1/3 cup), and threw in 1 tbs of Worcestershire sauce to the ketchup/sugar mixture, which I applied on top of the meatloaf instead of the bottom. I also added 2 slices of bread underneath the meatloaf to help absorb the grease. It was absolutely delicious!

This is amazing meat loaf! I mixed the ketchup and the brown sugar together and made a glaze with it then spreaded it on top of the meat.

Excellent!!  Added ~1 tbsp of Worchestershire to the ketchup.  Also added 1/2 tsp of garlic with the ginger (could even try a little more of both, maybe 3/4 tsp each)

I agree with a lot of the folks here, the sauce on the bottom is a disaster, but it is quite delicious at the top and it gives the meat a great flavor! This recipe is easily modifiable to add a little of what you like here and there but even just as is (with the sauce on the top of however) This recipe is a great family dinner!

I love that it gave the correct measurements for the brown sugar and ketchup, what i ended up doing instead was mixing those two ingredients together, taking half of the mixture and putting it in the meat, the other half i slathered on top and cooked it. turned out great.

For years I've been searching for that perfect meatloaf recipe.  I think I may have found it!  This recipe has potential,  I followed the recipe to the T and now I shall make it my own....ha, ha, ha.   I believe it needs tweaking here and there but it is near perfect.   The consistency was excellent, the slices did not fall apart.  It just needs more in the spice department.  I did not use lean ground beef so it was quite a process for me,  every few minutes I had pull the meatloaf from the oven to drain grease out of the loaf pan.  Lean ground beef maybe healthy but lacking in flavor and taste.  If you're worried about what's healthy, meatloaf is not your best choice even if the meat is 92/7 or 85/15.  In the end I like to think the tenderness was due to using 85/15 and not the lean as the recipe requests.  Enjoy!

I made this exactly as directed but my oven quit working on me after I had already put this together (minus the brown sugar/ketchup mixture).  I ended up wrapping it in heavy duty foil & pouring the sugar/ketchup mixture over it and cooking it on my grill.  Worked out perfectly & even my picky eater declared it "really good" and wants to have it again!  Thanks!

My husband loves meatloaf but I'm not a big fan so consequently I don't make it often.  I came across this recipe and decided to give it a try.  The only variation I made was with the onions.  My hubby will pick any and all onions out of whatever I make until I recently discovered a trick - shred up the onions and then saute in butter.  I sauteed the onions and added them to this recipe; otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly as given.  IT WAS GREAT - BOTH HUBBY AND I LOVED IT.  I will definitely be making him meatloaf more often.

Easy easy recipe! I used 2 packages of ground beef. I used salt, pepper, basil, and onion soup mix to season the beef. I did as other users suggested: 1/2 cup of milk and 1 egg. I also used about 1 cup of plain bread crumbs. That was the perfect blend. Made the perfect size loaf. As for the glaze: 1 cup of ketchup, 1/2 cup of brown sugar, and and 1 teaspoon of steak sauce. The steak sauce cut the sweetness, making this the perfect glaze.

This is a wonderful meatloaf recipe--the ginger adds just enough zing, and the  sweet sauce was a big hit with my picky five-year old, who ate a whole piece of meatloaf for the first time in his life!

I tried the meat loaf today and I liked it. It was a little on the sweet side and I was not to sure about the ground ginger but I would definitely make it again. I don't really like to cook but it looked good so I followed the recipe and did not make any changes.

I was very disappointed as I have been waiting to try this one. It does smell great but I found it was too sweet. I thought that at least my six kids would like it but none of them did. It is edible but not my favorite or my husband's.

I thought this recipe was fantastic.  I put in Lipton onion soup mix in place of the onions, mixed the brown sugar and ketchup together and spread on top for a glaze and in the middle of the meatloaf I spread a thick layer of stuffing mix!  We loved it!!

I used ground turkey for this recipe. I saw where someone had suggested oats instead of crackers, so that is what I did. I used tomato sauce, and added a little vinegar, since ketchup has vinegar in it. I put some of the sugar/tomato sauce on the bottom and some on top. I left out the salt, since I have high blood pressure, and chopped up about 1/3 of a small jalapeno pepper so it wouldn't be too bland. It came out absolutely DELICIOUS!

This is delicious !  I am a recipe tweaker so with that being said here is what I did.  I used tomato sauce instead of milk; added green pepper and some left over rice.  I left out the ginger did everything else the same.  I spiced it up with garlic powder, onion powder, season salt.  The brown sugar/ketchup really does add a wonderful twist.  Hubby loved it hot and it will make great sandwiches tomorrow !!

This was a great and easy dish to prepare. I doubled the recipe, but after I added the milk, it was too runny.  I added an extra cup of dry oatmeal, not the instant kind, and it turned out wonderfully!

The brown sugar/ketchup glaze is the making of this dish.  I put mine on top (not the bottom) and cooked it in my crockpot on high for 3 hours.  This one is a keeper.  Of course I had to put in a tad of garlic and think next time it will get 1/2 tsp. ginger.

I changed the recipe a little, but this got two thumbs WAY up from everyone in my family.  Here are the changes I made.  I used only 1/4 c of brown sugar, 1/2 cup of milk, and 1 egg.  I used "Beefy Onion" soup mix instead of an onion, and I added 1 Tbs of Worcestershire sauce to the glaze.  I added 1/2 of the glaze to the bottom of the pan and then added the other 1/2 the last 15 minutes of baking.  I also used 1/2 ground turkey and 1/2 veggie crumbles to reduce the total fat.  It was great and I WILL be making it again!  (Especially since my picky kiddos ate it!)

This got mixed reviews at my house.  My oldest son and I who love traditional meatloaf really did not care for this.  But my husband and youngest son who dislike traditional meatloaf LOVED this.  My son even said "WOW, Mom! This is the best meatloaf I have ever had in my whole life!!".

This is a very versatile and forgiving recipe. I used ground turkey and kind of eyeballed the ingredients. I also shaped it on a foil-lined cookie sheet so I could drain off any grease that appeared. I had no ketchup (how in the world did that happen?) so I substituted canned tomato sauce and spread it over top as the loaf was almost done cooking. Then I sprinkled on some brown sugar. SO good. My beyond-picky 2-year-old ate it. That's a glowing review, in my book. Thank you for a great recipe!

I make a few changes - instead of ketchup I use BBQ sauce.  I also add sauted onions and portabella mushrooms.  I like the texture of panko crumbs so I subsitute that for the saltine crackers.  It's a big hit in my family as well as friends who I serve it to.

This recipe is way too sweet for my taste. Also, I think the ginger is over-powering. DH, however, really likes this recipe, so I may give it another shot and omit the ginger and reduce the amount of brown sugar.

I hate meatloaf, but my boyfriend requested meatloaf. I LOVED this recipe. I made it exactly as the recipe says, and it came out wonderful. We will be making changes for next time though, because we think we can make it even better. Next time, we plan to put the sugar and ketchup on top, and add some kick to it. Thank you so much for sharing this! I finally like meatloaf!

The meatloaf itself was ok, but the sauce made it unique. The sweetness was a nice touch. Apparently somebody used all of my brown sugar, so I substituted some organic blue agave syrup, but I can only imagine it tastes even better with the correct ingredient. I've been searching for a family meatloaf recipe and I think this is the keeper :)

Something went very wrong. I followed the recipe as stated excepted used teriyaki sauce as I can't have tomatoes. This boiled over and caused so much smoke that I had the fire department and my alarm company calling me as it set off my alarms. I've made all kinds of meatloaf and never had this happen. Good thing I had a infrawave oven otherwise dinner would have been lost. I was able to finish cooking it in that oven. It was pretty good but next time I will put the sugar on top and add the sauce the last 10 minutes.

I made the common changes people listed (onion soup packet, bread crumbs, glaze on top) but this meatloaf is easy and AMAZING! I love it.

My boyfriend is very hard to please and he didnt say anything when he was eating I asked him if he likes it and he said he loved it. I loved it too! I sprinkled brown sugar on the top and it gave the meatloaf a real nice glaze! On to the next!

I love meatloaf and this recipe is the closest I have found to my Mom's but it still seems to be missing something I can't quite figure out. But this is the best meatloaf recipe I have found so far!!

I always make exactly as directed the first time, to rate it fairly.
This was excellent!  I did have another slice and found the sauce to get a bit sweet.  Next time I may reduce the Brown Sugar to 1/4 cup and add a tablespoon of Worcestershire Sauce.

Thank You for Sharing!

This is by far the best meatloaf I have ever put in  my mouth! My family asks for this one all of the time. Definately place the brown sugar and ketchup on top of the meatloaf and not on bottom as directed. That is the only change that I made.

Very nice recipe.  I left out the ginger, and added garlic powder.  I also put the glaze on top after cooking for 30 minutes.  Tasty!  It's a keeper!

This is the BEST meatloaf I have ever tasted.  The only change I made was putting the brown sugar on top of the meatloaf, then slices of bacon (hickory smoked is good), then ketchup over everything.  The combination of the sugar & bacon is simply delicious!  Everyone asks for the recipe.

I love brown sugar meatloaf. Problem, my husband HATES tomato/ketchup. Never thought to put the ketchup on the bottom, I am going to try this recipe and put parchment paper between half of the meatloaf and ketchup mixture to keep it separated. More goodness for me, none for him!

So good!  I did not put the brown sugar and ketchup in the bottom of the pan.  I used the loaf pan to shape the meat into a loaf.  I then transferred the loaf to a baking dish and topped with brown sugar and ketchup.  It turned out great.  Very tasty dish!

As meatloaf goes, this is good! Like other reviewers, I put the brown sugar and ketchup on top. To make it gluten free, I substituted 2 cups of finely chopped mushrooms for the cracker crumbs. I used a turkey baster to suck the drippings off about 15 minutes before it was done and then again when it came out of the oven. My partner and meat-loving kid liked it and the picky one ate it without too much hassle, which is high praise indeed!

would have given it 5 stars but it seemed like a waist putting the brown sugar and ketchup on botttom. I def agree with other reviews to put it on top.

The best meatloaf recipe I've tried!  I put a small amount of brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom of the pan then a mixture of brown sugar, ketchup, and mustard on the top as a glaze.  My husband thought it was a bit too sweet, but I loved it!  Try this recipe, you will not be disappointed.

DH normally does not care for meatloaf, but says this is the best one he's ever had.  Also, the brown sugar & ketchup at the bottom is the secret...keeps it moist.  If it were on top, we feel it would dry up.

My friends said it was very moist and delicious, next time I want to try the bread at the bottom of the pan thing because it was very greasy!!  I also put the glaze on the top of the meatloaf.

I made a few modifications based on other reviews and this turned out to be a really tasty recipe! 1) used ground turkey instead of ground beef, 2) only used 1 egg, 3) used bread crumbs instead of crushed crackers, and 4) added a splash of worcestershire to the mix. Served with mashed potatoes and corn. Will definitely make again!

topping is awesome but the meatloaf itself was a little bland.  may try it again adding some more spice to the ground beef.

This is the best meatloaf I have ever tasted. Well, it's the only meatloaf that I actually have eaten and love. We used to make this with the onions, but tonight we left them out and you could really taste the sweetness. The ginger adds a very nice touch and the onions tend to take away from the flavor. Also, we use ground turkey instead of beef for a healthier alternative.

This was my first attempt at meatloaf and I don't think there is any need to try a different recipe!! Yes it is sweet but I have had different savoryflavors before, made by others, and this was so much better. I made this (with the usual suggested changes) with mashed potatoes and corn on the side (good classic American meal) and can not WAIT to eat the leftovers! I baked the loaf in my muffin pan (makes 6 large muffins) for mini-loaves. They were the perfect size. The ketchup/b.sugar/worcershire mix was great and I do agree that it should go on top however next time my main concern is figuring out how to cut down the on the grease.

Made this last night and it is really good.   Flavorful, moist and easy.  I did add a couple of chopped garlic cloves and Italian seasoned breadcrumbs (that's all I had) and it will be a new family favorite.  Thanks for the recipe.

We love this basic but delicious meatloaf!  It comes out very sweet and I love that the topping is on the bottom.  I think it could use a little less brown sugar.

SO SO good!  This is by far the best meatloaf I've ever had.  When I make it for company, and they take their first bite, they are always surprised at how good it is.  We love to try to keep some as leftovers so we can enjoy meatloaf sandwiches the next day.  Make sure you keep the sauce and the meat... then the next day mix up what you have left with some mayo (as much or as little as you like), then spread onto a toasted bread for a SUPER yummy( and addictive ) sandwich :)

I enjoyed this recipie quite a bit, but I did make a few changes. I hate biting into raw onion in meatloaf, so I carmelized the onion beforeI put it into the meat.  I also didn't have enough ketchup to coat the bottom, so I mixed 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 bbq sauce instead and then brushed the top with bbq sauce as well. I used mashed potato flakes instead of saltine crackers, and baked it in a glass pie dish insteaf of a loaf pan.  It came out great!

Cooking the loaf in a large casserole dish works great to keep it from getting too greesy. All or some glaze should definitely be on top, putting half on top and half on bottom works well. Add green bell pepper maybe mushroom (sauteed even)!

Put the glaze on top but half it. You can also make the meatloaf in mufin tins to cut down on cooking time. They're fun & kids love 'em (husbands too!).

This is the first meatloaf I've ever made and it came out great!  I even doubled the recipe.  I added some worcestershire sauce to the meat and glaze. I also added a bit of garlic powder to the meat.  Based on reviews, I also put a bit of glaze on the bottom, and most on top.  I reduced the brown sugar and milk slightly.  I used 2 eggs and 1 egg white (instead of the 4 for doubling recipe).  Also, I used 1/2 panko bread crumbs, 1/2 plain since I had no saltines.  I'm really pleased with the results!  Thanks for the recipe!

If you like sweeter meatloaf, like that from Boston Market for example, don't mess with the sugar content on the recipe.  I reduced the sugar as other reviewers had suggested and found that I would've liked a little more sweetness.  The addition of worcestishire sauce is genius, though.

Must try! Best meatloaf i have ever had. Made the modifications that other viewers have suggested. Reduced to 1 egg, 1/2 cup of milk, added 1/2 tbsp of worchestershire, & 3/4 cups of seasoned bread crumbs (instead of crackers) for the meatloaf. For the sauce i added 1/2 tbsp of worchestershire and reduced to 1/3 brown sugar (sauce layered ontop).

Followed the recipe without a single alteration, which everyone seems to think are necessary for this meatloaf. Cooked in a loaf pan with the ketchup and brown sugar on the bottom. The flavor perfectly and completely infused the loaf. This was a delightful recipe.

Perfect as is! I love the sweet flavor of this meatloaf! Only thing I suggest is to check it about 45 minutes through cooking and drain most of the grease out. Other than that, it is just perfect! I have made this several times and will continue to.

I'm normally not a fan of meatloaf at all, but I loved this recipe. I didn't use a loaf pan, and  mixed the Ketchup and brown sugar together before spreading onto the top of the meatloaf. It was a hit with my whole family, and they are very picky eaters.

This was a little too sweet for my liking. The meat portion was great, but the ketchup and brown sugar glaze was very sweet. I would cut those portions in half if I were to make this again.

Awesome!  I took another reviewers suggestion and also glazed the meatloaf, in addition to layering the pan with the ketchup and brown sugar. This recipe is a keeper, next time, I will blend the brown sugar and ketchup to layer the pan.  I did not like the way it separated while cooking.

Very yummy! After reading the reviews, I put the brown sugar and ketchup on top. The only thing I would change about this recipe is that it was a little salty for my taste. My husband liked it as-is, so I guess it's just a matter of opinion. This is a very sweet meatloaf, so if you like it that way, TRY THIS!

The best meatloaf I had so far!!! So delicious and juicy! I made this meatloaf on our anniversary, and my boyfriend loved it very much. Highly recommended to others who wants to make meatloaf.   I modified the recipe though. Below is based on 4 servings. I used 1.33 lb 96% lean ground beef and baked it in a 9x5 loaf pan. The beef was so lean that the meatloaf had so little fat which is great to me. I read other reviews and agreed to put the sauce on top instead of at the bottom (the sauce also kept the beef moist). I put one tablespoon of worcestershire mixed in with the brown sugar and ketchup. When the meatloaf was half way cooked, I mixed and added extra ketchup and a flash of worcestershire sauce on top of the meatloaf. It turned out very delicious because of the extra sauce and moist. One advice is don't drain the sauce (they are not fat). Keep them and put of top of the meatloaf!!! No need to bake the meatloaf for an hour, it may get overcooked. I used croutons instead of crumbs. I put in two 1/4 cup finely crushed crouton cuz of more  beef. I love garlic, so I chopped up two gloves and mixed them in.   The meatloaf goes well with fresh cut corn and garlic mashed potatoes!!  Yummy, I will definitely use this recipe again.   My boyfriend and I finished everything, and now I want more.

This is the perfect Meatloaf! i follow the recipe but change some things: I added some cloves to the meat, garlic powder and chopped celery. To the sauce i added a hint of Worshestire sauce. I mixed the brown sugar, sauce and ketchup. Put a little on the bottom of the pan and the other half on the top of the meatloaf. The meatloaf taste it to heaven!!!  AMAZING

This is my go-to recipe for meatloaf, as it never fails to impress dinner guests. Simply put, it's next to impossible to mess up this dish. Like others, I put brown sugar and ketchup on top of the meatloaf, but I also put some in the bottom of the pan so that it's on both sides. I also use bread crumbs instead of cracker crumbs (only for convenience sake).

THE best meatloaf.  Husband couldn't stop talking about it.  He ate almost the whole thing singlehandedly.  Put the catsup mixture half on below, half on top of meatloaf.  Easiest recipe ever!

I gave this 4 stars only because I agree that the glaze should be on top rather than on the bottom, I have made this recipe trying it both ways and liked it on top much better. I also added 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire to the glaze. So yummy and great the next day too. Thank you.

SO good!  I made this just as the recipe stated, only mine took quite a bit longer to cook.  It tasted wonderful and leftovers made great sandwiches!  Hubby said it was one of the top five meatloaves of all time, which says a lot.  :o)  Thanks!

I love the brown sugar on the bottom.  My mom always used lipton onion soup mix in her meatloaf and so that would be the one thing I would add to it next time.  Other than that it was really good!

I hardly ever made meatloaf because I couldn't get it to turn out just right. That was until I found this recipe. I use breadcrumbs instead of crackers and put a little bit less milk so it won't be as "mushy" but other than that I keep everything the same. My husband LOVES this. He asks for it all the time!

This is the best meatloaf I've ever had!  I am lactose/dairy/wheat intolerant so I subsituted the milk for rice milk and the saltine cracker crumbs with Glutino Vegetable Crackers.  I only used 1/4 of the brown sugar and 1/4 of the ketchup.  It really doesn't need any more than that.

I made this into three smaller loafs and put them in a small roasting pan with the brown sugar on top. The edges got crispier and they cooked in half the time.

Amazing day 1, even better as a reheat.  I added the worcestershire sauce and garlic folks recommended.

I made some minor modifications to this recipe but all in all I really like it.  It is great to make two batches and freeze one.

I just wanted to say "THANK YOU" for submitting this recipe. I've tried other meatloaf recipes and they were okay but this one is by far the best (according to my family). I tried the recipe as is but found it was a bit too sweet for me so I cut back on the brown sugar and did what others suggested. I'm still giving this 5 stars though because maybe you like sweet and if you don't, then you can cut back on certain ingredients. It's still a great recipe to me and my family. Thank you again!

Great taste! I do have a hard time judging when it's done. It will go from almost done to over done in a matter of minutes, but thats my fault, not the recipes!

Excellent flavor!  I, too, put the ketchup/brown sugar mix on top.  My husband just adored it.  This is a keeper.

My family and I all loved this.  I actually used ground turkey, since I didn't have ground beef on hand, and it turned out better than I expected.  I also used a bit of (couple Tbsp maybe) Italian Seasoned bread crumbs.  I served the meatloaf with fresh green beans and a baked potato.  Delicious!

I used this as a base recipe to create a recipe I will use going foreward. I reduced the brown sugar to 1/8 cup, the milk to 1/2 cup, 1 tbsp. of onion powder instead of the onion, panko bread crumbs instead of saltines, and added 2 tsp. Worcestershire sauce to the sauce and spread it on the top of the meatloaf when it was nearly cooked through rather than under the loaf.

This was okay, but not very flavorful.  I've always used a recipe with 1 tsp. of sage and the topping has mustard, ketchup, and brown sugar.

I cook for 4 very picky eaters. (3 kids and a wife)  Everyone loved it.  I was very pleased.  I did not put the brownsugar and ketchup on the bottom.  Like another reviewer, I made it into a glaze and poured it on 15 mins b4 it was done.  PERFECT!!!!!!

Not a bad meatloaf. It was quick and easy to make. The brown sugar was a bit much.  The kids liked it but my husband and I thought it was too sweet. I'll cut it back to maybe 1/4 C next time.

I wasn't a big fan of this meatloaf, mostly because it was MUCH sweeter than I expect in a meatloaf.  I reduced the brown sugar in the glaze to 1/4 cup, added onion soup mix instead of the onion to the meat loaf and increased the ground ginger to 1/2 tsp and was still overwhelmed by sweet.  If you like a sweet meatloaf, you may like this recipe.  Otherwise, I recommend you try something different.

I left out the onion (we don't like them) and added some onion powder, also used bread crumbs instead of saltines because I didn't have any. Very good!

This was absolutely delicious!!! My whole fam raved about it and my picky 1 and 3 year olds ate it and wanted seconds! I used muffin cups for faster cooking and I put the glaze on the bottom and top of the meat. I also left out the saltine crackers (I didn't have any) and it still came out firm but moist. Lastly, I added some worcestershire sauce and garlic powder to the mix. Will Make it again!

Very tasty, but a little too sweet.  Next time I make it I will halve the sugar, otherwise it was great!  Another reviewer said to put the sauce on top, and line the loaf pan with bread slices.  I tried that and it was incredible!  Makes a wonderful crispy crust!

liked it.  after reading some of the reviews, i followed the advice to use only one egg and a bit less milk, and used italian seasoned bread crumbs.  i also put a little of brown sugar and ketchup/worchestershire sauce in the bottom, baked the meatloaf, poured off the grease and then poured more brown sugar/ketchup/worchestershire on top and baked a little longer.  the brown sugar/ketchup on the bottom created a little bit of a "crust" and was delicious!

We love this meatloaf as a nice change from our regular. One tip - there is a lot of grease/ juice on this one - so I drain it completely before slicing and serving.

I took another reviewers suggestion and put bread in the bottom of the pan before adding the meat to absorb the grease, then I also added a Tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to the sugar/ketchup mix and put the it on the top.  The sauce taste like BBQ sauce and was a different twist on meatloaf.  I'd make it again but cut the sugar down a bit.  It was just a little too sweet for my taste.

The meat was good however we thought that the topping was way too much and very sweet.  It was like having candy on my meatloaf.  I just scraped what I could off and enjoyed the meat as much as possible without topping.

My 10-year-old son wanted to make dinner and chose meatloaf.  I never followed a recipe or made it the same way twice.  I searched Allrecipes for a recipe that a beginner could make.  Didn't change any ingredients only where the ketchup/brown sugar was placed - on top.  We all loved this recipe and it is now the ONLY Meatloaf recipe we use/follow.  Thanks for sharing!

I am not a huge meatloaf fan but this one is the exception. I love this stuff. I don't put in the ginger simply because I never have any. And I put the sauce on top but it always turns out and smells amazing while baking.

This meatloaf made just as is without any variations I would give 0 stars but that is not possible. I had high hopes for this recipe because there were so many great reviews but as I was making it I knew it would not taste well. First off it is VERY sweet. So sweet that it puts me off. Also it has a mushy texture & I think it would taste bettwen with bread crumbs instead of crackers. My husband is a fan of almost any meatloaf and his exact words were, "it is a grade below frozen meatloaf." I would just stick to a simple recipe.

I was so excited to try this meatloaf recipe.  It looked very appetizing!  However, after just eating dinner, I am very disappointed with the result.  The texture is good, but the taste - not so much.  The ginger taste is overpowering.  My husband ate it - but he was less than thrilled.  Next time I'll make my standard recipe.

We were pretty disappointed in this meatloaf. I followed a lot of the reviewers' suggestions. I used seasoned bread crumbs instead of saltines, I added garlic and celery to the mix, used a little less milk, added more than the suggested amount of spices. After all this, we still found this to be pretty bland. The glaze was good, but we doctored that up with some of the suggestions too (less sugar, add dry mustard and Worcestershire sauce). My boyfriend put barbecue sauce on it. Not a good sign.

Thank you for the delicious and easy recipe.  As others suggested, I cut the sugar and ketchup in half and added a tablespoon of worchester sauce.   I poured that on top of the meat mixture.  I used 1/2 cup mik, 1 egg, and substituted rolled oats for saltine cracker crumbs.  I also added some chopped celery, carrot, and minced garlic to the meat.  It turned out perfect!!

I'd never made - or eaten - meatloaf until tonight, and this was easy to make and delicious! I followed the suggestions of other reviewers: I used 1/4 brown sugar mixed with 1 tbsp of worchestshire saurce and required ketchup to glaze the top of the meatloaf after 20-30minutes for a total 1.5 hours cooking time. I used 1/2 cup milk (rather than the 3/4 cup in the ingredients list),  also added 3 cloves of garlic and 1 tbsp worchestshire sauce to the meat mixture.  I'll definitely make this again!

I wasn't sure if three people could eat a whole loaf, but we did. This recipe is great! The meatloaf didn't cook evenly, but I just cooked it about 20 minutes extra. Was great!

I added a cup of mushrooms and used a sweet onion instead of a white or yellow, I also used italian bread crumbs instead of the crackers.  The meatloaf itself turned out really tasty, my husband really liked it.  The glaze however, was not a hit with either of us.  It was just waaaay to sweet.  This is a good base recipe but I think I will look elsewhere for a glaze.

My first meatloaf.. it was pretty good! Listen to the other reviewer's idea of using bread to collect the grease! I covered it for half the time and the sugary glaze (I put on top) was delicious! I did use a little more brown sugar b/c my family isn't a big ketchup fan.. Overall an easy recipe for beginners like me!

AWESOME!! My fiance loves meatloaf but I can never find a recipe that he goes back for seconds on...until now. He absolutely loved this recipe. After reading other reviews, I did make some variations: I used 1/4 c of brown sugar and added 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to the glaze and meat; used only 1/2 c of milk and seasoned bread crumbs and put the glaze on top. I can finally make meatloaf and not have left overs! Thank you for your recipe.

I've made this probably 5-6 times - absolutely LOVE IT! Of course, I do change it just a bit - I decrease the amount of brown sugar - about 1/4 cup. I mix the brown sugar and ketchup together and add a couple dashes of worcestershire then spread it on top of the meatloaf. Also I saute the onion with some garlic (and celery if I have any) and add that to the meat before forming it into a loaf and putting it on a baking sheet - this way it doesn't sit in as much grease. Oh and I use 2 egg whites and 93/7 beef. BF loves it as must as I do!

This was delicious! I did as some previous reviewers and only added one egg and reduced the milk to 1/2 a cup. I also added bread crumbs instead of saltines and, a tbls. of worcestershire sauce, and  couple of cloves of garlic and a rib of celery with the onion. Next time I make it I will probably reduce the amount of brown sugar in the glaze, just because my husband thought it was a little sweet (I thought it was great). Will definitely be making this again.

Great recipe and easy to make.  My husband and I love it.  Made a few minor changes though... I substituted quick cooking oatmeal for the crackers, reduced the brown sugar by half, added 1/2 tsp worcestershire to ketchup & brown sugar mixture and did not put it in bottom of pan.  Cooked meatloaf about 45 minutes then spread the ketchup mixture over the meatloaf, return to oven and finish baking.  Wonderful!!  Sometimes I double the ketchup mixture (reserving half of it) because we like to add extra on our plates.

Very nice. Better than mom's, don't tell her;). I stuck with the sugar/ketchup on the bottom and cooked for 50 min in 8x12 inch tray, making it thinner. I I used a very large onion and put a third in the meat, a third on top as garnish and a third in my mash. (I love onions). When it was done I served and dripped the remaining sugar/ketchup/caramelized onion of the whole thing. Comfort food, and the best I've had in a while.

My husband was a little skeptical about the idea of meatloaf,  but was pleasantly surprised when I made this!  We served it with baked potatoes.  Delish!

This is one great meatloaf. I made a few minor changes. I put all the sauce mixture on top! It caramelizes on top when you bake it. Also I added Worchester sauce as well within the meat as well. I added some extra pepper mistakenly…and it was great!

This meatloaf tasted great!  The time needed to bake it was way off!  It needed another 30 minutes in the oven!  I also had to place a rimmed sheet under it to catch all the drippings.

This was awsome!  I tweeked it a little: 1st, I added about 1/4 lb ground sausage for flavor.  Next, I used bread crumbs instead of crakers.  Then, for the glaze, I added 1/4 cup mustard and 2 TBS Worchester sause, and I spread this on top, instead of the botom.  And finally, I placed 2 slices of bread at the bottom of the pan to absorb most of the fat.  Fabulous!!!  Also, if you're short on time, I shape these into hamburger patties, spread the sause on each one and bake at 425 for about 30 minutes.  They make the BEST burgers!  We love this recipe!  Thank you!

Delicious!!!!  Love this recipe!!!  I do agree that the glaze should be on top of the meatloaf though!!!  And one more thing, no need to "lightly grease" the pan.  The oil from the meat sheds alot, so don't worry about the meat sticking because it won't!

I didn't use as much brown sugar as it called for and I added in one chopped green bell pepper and about a cup of shredded carrots. It was very pretty when I cut into it! Probably one of the best meatloafs I've ever had!

I'm not at all a meatloaf fan but this went over very well with the fam.  I used 2 lbs. of ground beef, increased the cracker crumbs and added shredded carrots and cheese to the meat mixture.  I also mixed the brown sugar and ketchup and spread over the top as a personal preference.  Mom always made meatloaf with bread cubes.  I much prefer the taste and texture of the cracker crumbs vs. bread cubes.

Excellent recipe. I made this exactly as the recipe cited except I used a muffin tin to make mini meatloafs. I put the brown sugar glaze on half of the meatloafs and marinara sauce w/ mozzarella on the other half. Delicious!

This is the best meatloaf I've ever eaten!!  I served it to dinner guests at Christmas and they devoured it and asked for some to take home for sandwiches.  I like mine with additional brown sugar glaze..it makes the meatloaf.

I wish I could give this more stars.  I'm a huge meatloaf fan and for years have been searching for the perfect recipe.  This is it.  Like other reviews, I put the sauce on top and used bread crumbs instead of crackers (no crackers on hand).  The only addition I made was to cut bacon into one inch pieces and put it on the top of the meatloaf prior to baking.  My family has been doing this for years and there's nothing better.

SO GOOD! I accidentally over poured the ginger a bit and it was still wonderful. I glazed it every 15 minutes with the sauce instead of putting on bottom so the flavor goes all the way through.

This is a very good meatloaf recipe!  However, the first time I made it, the chopped onion was too overwhelming/too obvious.  Maybe I didn't chop it small enough, because we were getting slightly raw chunks of onions as we bit into the meat.  I just made this for a second time with some revisions, which suited my family much better.  I like my meatloaf to have a little bit of a tomato flavor, and so I added 1/4 cup of ketchup and reduced the amount of milk to 1/2 cup so the meat wouldn't fall apart.  I also substituted 1 tsp of dried minced onions for the chopped fresh onion and 3/4 cup of bread crumbs for the cracker crumbs.  Next time, I think I will also be grating some zucchini and carrots into it in the hopes that I can get my toddler to eat some veggies.  With my revisions, the recipe became a 5 star recipe for my family, and I will definitely be making meatloaf this way from now on!

This is a big hit in my household!  It's very saucy and packed with flavour. I use breadcrumbs instead of crackers and often omit the ginger (if I forget to add it ;) ) and it still turns out perfect.  In addition to packing the brown sugar and ketchup in the bottom of the pan, I mix about a cup's worth in a bowl and drizzle/baste the top of the loaf to give it a little MORE flavour. YUMMMMMY! Thanks for sharing!

I really liked this meatloaf, but the first time I made it, there was too much liquid! So, I only added 1/2 c of milk. I also added some garlic, a pinch of sage and put the brown sugar/ketchup on top. My bf said this was the best meatloaf he has tasted. =D

I followed some of the suggestions, added garlic and worcestershire sauce, and put the brown sugar and ketchup on top, it came out great! The meat was really moist. I also only used 1/4 c of brown sugar, but it's still too sweet for me. I'll definitely make this again with less sugar.

Very good, although the brown sugar topping was a little too sweet for our taste buds.  Went with one reviewers advice and added celery to the meat mixture..was a nice addition, thanks!

I should have listened to the other reviews when they said to cut the milk down to 1/2c. I instead used the whole amount and my meatloaf pre-coocked was soggy. I made 2 mini meatloafs and cooked them in seperate puyrex dishes. I wanted to dry them out a little so I cooked the mini ones for an hour and they came out OK. I also made the glaze of 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 ketchup and 1/4 bbq sauce which I think added more flavor. This was an OK recipe, I think I am going to experiment with other meatloaf recipes before I come back to this one.

Very deliscious!!! I basted it about half way through cooking from the juices in the bottom of the pan (ketchup and brown sugar mixture) and it was perfect!! I also substituted the cracker crumbs with stove top dressing mix crunched up.  EXCELLENT!!

OUTSTANDING!  I have made this same recipie for years only I never used saltines, just regular breadcrumbs and let me tell you the saltines make all the difference.  I also use roughly a tablespoon on worchestershire sauce in the glaze.  The glaze doesn't do well on th bottom so I always put it ontop and it stay put.  YUMMY!

Though the glaze was absolutely delicious (I did add some worchestershire sauce) This was way too onion-y for me.  Maybe using soup-mix instead of the called for small onion would be better.  I didn't taste the ginger at all, either.  I wound eating it as an open-faced sandwich with some spicy BBQ sauce to cover the onion flavour.   Don't know if I'll make this again; may try for a different recipe.

Great meatloaf recipe.  Like others, I substitute onion, salt, pepper and grd ginger with an envelope of onion soup mix and add 1 egg and some of the brown sugar/ketchup mix into the meatloaf with remainder as a glaze.  Great next day fried with onions and left over potatoes.

This meatloaf was delicious!  I doubled up the amount of ketchup/brown sugar/wor. sauce and poured it on the top of the meatloaf, not on the bottom of the pan.  I also just used a 9x13 size pan and it worked out just great.  The leftovers (which werent many!) were just as delicious!  Thanks for such a great recipe!!

What a great meatloaf! This was super easy, and the flavor was fantastic. I had to use a 8x9 glass casserole pan, but it worked out great. I just kept an eye on it. At 350 degrees, for about 40-50 minutes was all it took, as it was much more shallow. I also put the ketchup/brown sugar mixture on top for a glaze, and we absolutely loved it!

I tried this recipe this evening with my family! it was a major hit. I have twins and one of them never eats meatloaf and he just asked for seconds. So i had to come write this ASAP! i added black olives finely chopped and cajun seasonings and i added the brown sugar and tomato sauce on top (I used tomato sauce instead of ketchup)

This was a wonderful recipe!  It takes an old classic and really shakes it up!  The brown sugar blend with the ketchup is fabulous.  I added a little extra brown sugar and ketchup to the bottom of the pan so I would have extra glaze to spoon on top of the meatloaf.  My family finished the whole pan!  Thanks for the great recipe!

If you just put the sauce on top 15 minutes before its done, like everyone else suggests, this is HANDS DOWN the best meatloaf I have ever had! It's tangy, but all the ingredients just compliment each other.

My daughters favorite!  We have fixed it for company and everyone always asks for the recipe.  The only change I have made is to use 1 lb. of ground turkey and a half pound of seasoned turkey.

Very good recipe.  I make this meatloaf all the time.  The only change I make is that I use oats instead of saltines.  I also cook it on a rack in a pan like other reviewers have suggested and spread the ketchup mixture over top (I only use 1/4 brown sugar and 1/4 ketchup). Otherwise, if you cook the meatloaf in a loaf pan, the meat stews in its fat; we used this cooking method when I worked in the hospital kitchen .  Thank-you for sharing this amazing recipe!

love this recipe! I cooked it last night for my boyfriend and his roommate and they both had full bellies but couldn't help but go back for seconds! The only thing I did different was add half a bunch of green onions, and added more ground ginger because i love the taste of it. Yumm! Oh and I also put a ketchup/brown sugar/mustard glaze on top Halfway through the baking.

With all of the positive reviews, I thought I'd give this meatloaf a try - I was not impressed. The ginger gave it a horrible taste and the ketchup and brown sugar never really blended. I'm definitely still looking for that "perfect" meatloaf recipe.

Wow, this was pretty darned good! My other meatloaf recipe will have to be retired. I added a little worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, and ginger powder to the ketchup and brown sugar mixture. I also poured the sauce on top of the meatloaf instead of putting it on the bottom. Although I think it may get more caramelized on the bottom so I'll try that next time. My 3 and 5 year old had seconds - which NEVER happens!

The recipe was a hit. I did however do a tweak here and there and substituted. i put the glaze on top of the meatloaf for the last 15 minutes of baking. I used only 1/3 of both brown sugar and ketchup with a little drizzle of worcesteshire sauce. and for the meatloaf itself i used italian bread crumbs instead of saltine crackers. i used ground turkey instead of ground meat. i used lipton onion mix for the onion. and also added a TBSP of worcesteshire to the glaze and to the meatloaf. Thanx tangastar for the recipe.

I dont like meatloaf, but I make this all the time and I love it! I use 3/4c of italian breadcrumbs because thier already mostly seasoned. But I also add 1ts garlic powder, 2ts of onion powder (we dont like onions in our house), 1ts salt, 1/2ts pepper, 1/2ts ginger, and 1tbs of brown sugar. I use only 1/4c of ketchup and 1/4c of worchestire. I use 2 pieces of bread on the bottom of the pan.I use 1/4 of the sauce on the top not the bottom and cook for 45 mins and then flip it over onto a plate, remove the bread and flip it back into the pand and add 1/4 more of the sauce. Let it cook for 15 more mins and take it out  add 1/4 more let it rest 15 mins, slice it and add the rest of the sauce. This is a keeper!!!

This was the best meatloaf I have ever tasted! Everyone loved this and I plan to use this recipe every time I make meatloaf. The only thing I would change for my personal preference is , decrease the brown sugar just a tad. Mine came out very sweet.. but still very good!

Amazingly good.  Added some Worcestershire sauce to the glaze, added just a bit of Andouille sausage (maybe 1/4 pound if that), and also put the glaze on top of the meat before cooking (half) and then put the other half on again after 40 minutes.  Really, really good.  Since we put the glaze on top, might have used maybe just a bit less brown sugar.

Great!  Didn't have ginger as I had thought, but still turned out very tasty.  As other reviewers suggested, I used only 1/2 cup milk, but did use the two eggs as it didn't seem to hold together otherwise. I had no problems replacing the saltines with bread crumbs.

This was the best meatloaf I've ever had...that's what my son said, and I agree.  My hubby doesn't even like meatloaf, and he said it was good.  I added 1-2 T. Worchestershire Sauce to the glaze, reduced the milk to 1/2c., reduced to 1 egg, redcued the salt to 1/2 t., used seasoned bread crumbs instead of saltine crackers, and added 2 slices of bread iin the bottom of the pan (to absorb the grease).

I've made this a few times, but it never really caught my attention.  This past time, however, instead of a loaf, I followed another cook's suggestion and flattened it into a casserole.  Also, I didn't have enough ground beef, so I tossed in some frozen, bite-sized veggies and reduced the milk a bit.  It was so good that I wish I had more beef to make more!

Simply the Best!  I took the advice of others and used slightly less brown sugar.  I put the sauce mixture on top instead of the bottom and reserved a little to add more the last 15 min of baking. Makes great leftovers too!  Thanks for sharing this one!

This recipe was fantastic! I have tried many different meatloaf recipes and this by far was my family's favorite. The only thing that I changed was instead of adding the 1 1/2 c. ground beef, I used a 1 lb ground beef and a 11 lb of ground turkey. The meatloaf was wonderful and my kids who are super picky asked for 2nds!

I made this recipe EXACTLY the way it is written.  I made 6 mini meatloafs in a muffin tin.  They came our very flavorful, yes sweet but not too sweet in my opinion.  I will make this again & recommend following the recipe exactly.

A family favorite! Even my husband, who normally does not care for meatloaf, requests this. The recipe is perfect as written, however I do make a few minor changes just to speed up the preparation a bit...I use a packet of dry onion soup mix in place of the chopped onion and salt. I use seasoned bread crumbs in place of the crushed crackers. I also mix the ketchup and brown sugar together and pour the sauce over the top before baking. We eat this on top of mashed potatoes. YUMMY!!

VERY sweet flavor. The first time I made it like it calls for and the sauce just stayed stuck in the bottom of the pan.  The next time I put the sauce on top and it was perfect.

FABULOUS!!  I joined just to write about it. While mixing, the ketchup smelled so strong, I kept adding and adding more brown sugar. Well the result was a fantastic sweet glaze that left my guy demanding I make it again - a first!

Yum!  I love this recipe.  I've made it with ground beef, but I actually prefer it with ground turkey (1.25 lbs).  It's moist and delicious.  When I have it on hand, I like to add a zucchini, shredded.

I added about 1 Cup of grated golden potatoes to the loaf and loved this added texture and flavor. I also substituted herbed cornbread stuffing mix for the cracker crumbs and loved it! I've made it three times this month, once for guests even. A great meal.

This was great!  I only made two changes.  I didn't have any fresh onions left, so I used onion soup mix instead.  I also listened to other reviewers and put the sauce on the top instead of the bottom.  Turned out great--Thanks for the recipe!

I mixed the ketchup and brown sugar right into the meat mixture. I didn't add the milk or ginger and used a whole sleave of crushed saltine crackers - this was excellent!

So yummy! This was my first time ever making meatloaf, and I was impressed!  I took some reviewer's advice and used 1/2 cup milk, added a splash of worcestershire to the glaze and the meat. I also put the glaze of brown sugar and ketchup on the top rather than the bottom.  One thing I would do differently next time is cut the amount of brown sugar in half because it is a tad on the sweet side.  But it is so delicious! This will be my staple meatloaf recipe :)

Mmmm this is so good and a staple in my house! It's just as yummy with ground turkey (if you're trying to eat healthier). I also cut back on the amount of milk. The first time I made it with the whole amount listed it fell apart...once I cut the milk in half it turned out perfect!

I really was unsure about how this was going to turn out....But this was AMAZING!  It had a wonderful texture and the way the brown sugar and ketup oozed over the meatloaf, this was a great dish...cant wait to make it again!!!

very good!  I did opt to follow some other suggestions and use a small portion of the sugar/ketchup mix in the bottom of the pan and the majority on top as a glaze.  I think that is my own personal preference.

This is the best recipe ever! I've made it about 6 times now, I did it again last night, but didn't have crackers or an onion so I substituted Italian Bread Crumbs, and half a red bell pepper and 4 large chopped mushrooms! The best yet, still could have used an onion though :)

First off, I would have taken a picture, but it was so good and my family and i ate all of it!! i took some advice from reviewers and made mini loves. It was such a great idea to make mini's. I read it wrong and only used 1lb of ground beef but still same amount of the other ingredients besides the eggs, I only used one(1). It was sooo yummy! i plan to make it at my friends this weekend when I go out of town!

I like this recipe a lot and my husband really likes the flavor of the sauce (he's a sweets lover - ketchup on everything, etc.) Without adding or changing any ingredients I tweaked the quantities a tad as per some of the other reviews and I've made this several times all with rave reviews! Thanks tangastar!

Fabulous recipe. So easy!! I too made some mods to the recipe. But I wanted to offer another option; Diana's Sauce.  You can use almost any flavour of Diana's Sauce as your glaze. It contains all the ingredients listed as well as ones other reviewer's suggested.  We always add sauteed mushrooms, celery and onion tot he meat mixture. It's to die for!!!

mmmm mmmmm yum this was so good. I thought it was weird to put the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom but I decided to make it the way it said to and I am not sorry. It was way good with it on the bottom. I used the juices as a gravy and dribbled it on top of the finished meat loaf.

I don't understand how this recipe got such a high rating. Candied beef is not my idea of a good dinner. All we could taste was the sweet and nothing else. Will not make this again. From now on I will be sure to read the one star reviews first.

Great Meatloaf, only gave 4 stars because of all the changes I made.  I made the meatloaf with minced onions instead of real, only used 1/2 cup of milk and it was too runny so I added more crushed crackers.  I also only put in a tsp of salt.  I put the glaze on top(with 15 minutes left) but I only put in 1/4 cup brown sugar , it was still really sweet next time I'll put in even less.  With all the changes it turned out great!

My first meatloaf and it was good!  I followed the recipe for about 12 and then followed many sugestions.  I used a pyrex 9 X 13 and had the meatloaf sit on top of 4 pieces of bread.  On the bread I sprinkled a little brown sugar and ketcup.  In the meatloaf- I used 1/2 c of milk and 2 eggs.  I bought Lipton onion soup but they had one for beef so I used that one and I chopped up a small onion.  I also mixed in about 1 cup of Italian breadcrumbs instead of cracker crumbs.  I added about 2 Tsp of minced garlic and about 2 T of ketchup within the beef.  I used all other ingredients as indicated in the recipe.  For the topping I then mixed togethter the 3/4c ketchup, 1/2 c brown sugar and T of Worcestershire sauce.  I spread about 3/4 on top and after 40 minutes coated the top with remaining.  It was a hit!!!

This is a wonderful recipe.  My entire family loves it.  I have not made meatloaf for years as it is usually bland, but I ran across this recipes and we were very pleasantly surprised.  It needs nothing else to add flavor to it.

I grew up making the meatloaf recipe from Julia Child's cookbook "The Way to Cook", but think this recipe is even better!

This was a nice change to our normal meatloaf (which is also delicious, just has more savory flavors).  Just as other reviewers, I had to substitute a couple ingredients since I was out.  I used ground turkey instead of beef, oatmeal instead of saltines.  It was quick, easy ans SO tasty.  My husband, who said he wasn't really hungry ended up going back for seconds.  Heated up the next day for lunch, it was still so yummy.

So easy, fast (to prep) and delicious!  I used ground turkey instead and added hot sauce to the ketchup.  Also, I put the ketchup and brown sugar on top of the loaf.  Oh, and I used bread crumbs instead of crackers, but only because that's what I had on hand and it was easier than crushing crackers.  This recipe is also awesome because it uses ingredients that you would have in your kitchen most of the time.

This is okay...My family likes the more traditional meatloaf better. Oh I think the sauce needs to be on top or you wont get much of the flavor:)

I made this for my family Halloween dinner party.  I usually don't use a new recipe for dinner parties for the obvious reason of a possible disaster happening.  Well I had a feeling this one would be a good so I took a chance.  I used 2lbs of ground turkey and 1lb of lean ground beef.  So I doubled the recipe and added Worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture and to the glaze.  I also put the glaze on top of the loaf instead of the bottom.  I cooked it for 1hr 45mins and it turned out GREAT! Everyone loved it and wants the recipe!!!

I have made this before but I guess I never reviewed it. My review is form this time. I made it with 93% Ground Beef for less fat. I also cooked it in a meatloaf pan and i was surprised to see almost no fat underneath (i guess since it was so low in fat in general). Anyway, I added 1 heaping Tbs. of minced garlic to the mix and used Ritz instead of saltines. Since my pan allowed dripping to go underneath (not sit under the meat), I put the sauce on top (which I added some Worcestershire sauce too as recommended). It was done in 50 minutes. I love the meat with the sauce but my only issue is, as is, the bottom is plain meatloaf and the top had the glaze... so if I baked it NOT in a meatloaf pan, I would put half on the bottom and half on top of the glaze. Since I used the pan, next time I might mix half into the mix itself and then put the rest on top... but I do love it!

I followed the recipe exactly other than changing the cracker crumbs to bread crumbs (sounded better to me) and putting the brown sugar and ketchup on top of the meat prior to baking. It wasn't awful, but also wasn't the best meatloaf I've had.

So tasty! My 14 month old won't eat beef, but loved this! Next time I will be sure to use lean ground beef to avoid all the fat in the pan. This was my first time making meatloaf and we don't need to search any more for another recipe!

I thought the meatloaf was a little mushy at first and very sweet. ( I like my a little more tangy) But the next day the meatloaf was amazing and I would make this again. Except add a little more salt or try the worcestershire sauce that others suggested.

Love this recipe because it is so good, super easy and not a big mess.  We used Ritz crackers and put some sauce on the bottom to prevent sticking but most on top.  Good comfort food.

The idea of brown sugar in a meatloaf was genius.  The family loved it so much they licked their plates. Definitely going into the dinner rotation.

We thought this was very very good!  I followed the recipe except I had to use crushed stuffing because I didn't have saltines.  I will make a change or two next time I make it though.  I thought there was too much sugar, next time I will use 1/4 cup of brown sugar, and will add some chopped garlic.  Other than that I will definitely make this again!

Wow.  I am not a big fan of meatloaf.  I was looking for something a little different, and I found it here!  I was skeptical and scared to try the brown sugar and ginger, but I am so glad I did.  I used fresh ginger that I grated...excellent flavor.  I added a tid-bit more salt than it called for because salt adds flavor, and I saw a couple comments saying it needed more flavor.  Moist, flavorful....my only complaint is that I should have made double the recipe so that I could eat more!  I only had enough ground beef for 6 servings...next time I'm making double.  Try this recipe and DON'T skip the ginger....

Very good!  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and cut down on the sugar, the eggs, the milk, and used bread crumbs instead of crumbled crackers.  I also added strips of bacon to the top.  Not as great as my mom's meatloaf, but nothing ever will be. ;)  Will definitely make this again.

I don't know if I was just in the mood for this or not, but it was just wonderful!!  I will totally make this again.  It isn't that different than the "wing-it" version, but it is also nice to follow a recipe to make sure it is good.  Next time I think I will just put the ketchup/sugar mix on top of it, because I like it a bit browner.

Best meatloaf ever!  A few changes.. Don't put the sauce on the bottom.  Save it as a glaze for the top.  Then place it back into the oven to carmelize. Extra Yummy!  Also, make sure to cut the onions small or use the onion soup mix.  Other than that... You will have rave reviews. I will only use this one from now on.

Love this meatloaf!!  I don't put the sugar on the bottom of the pan -- I just use it in the mixture for the topping!!  Also, I use bread crumbs -- for simplicity!  Very good!!

The only things I changed in this recipe was the amount of onion (a whole onion seemed a bit much to me), double the sauce, and instead of saltine crackers I used bread crumbs.  It was really out-of-this-world good!  I've never had much success with meatloaf - I can never get it done in the middle and then wind up baking it for too long as I try.  So for this one, I scooped a little sauce in the bottom of my muffin pans and put the meatloaf mixture in that to bake.  I was concerned about the grease not draining out, so I formed little "wells" in the middle of the meat and scooped the grease out when it was done.  It took about 30 minutes to bake; I took them out and put more sauce on top for the last few minutes. Everyone loved the result!

Pretty good..not much different than the traditional meatloaf that I usually make.  Thought the brown sugar and ketchup mixture would make it different, but since it's only on the top, it didn't go with every bite.

For all the vegetarians out there- I have only used this recipe with soy ground meat (Tivol) and it always comes out delicious. However, I also spread the brown sugar and ketchup mixture on the top and not at the bottom.

I thought this was just too sweet. The meat was okay but it wasn't 'perfect' meatloaf that I have been searching for. Others on this site are better but it wasn't terrible.

Meatloaf was very moist, but not big on flavor other than the glaze, which I thought was a bit too ketchupy.  Would make again but with modifications.

This was a big hit with both my husband and I. I used onion soup mix instead of the onion and accidentally forgot to add the milk and ginger. It still turned out terrific. I did try a tip I saw and added two toasted pieces of bread to the bottom of the loaf dish. This worked wonders in sucking up the extra greese. I also added the brown sugar sauce to the top of the meatloaf rather than the bottom of the dish.

Great recipe!! Changed a couple of things like others had  suggested. Instead of crackers I broke apart 2 pieces of bread added to the egg and milk and mixed in with the meat mix. Family said this is a keeper for our menu rotation!!

This was a good meatloaf recipe.  I did make a few changes myself.  I used Stovetop stuffing right in the mix. The added milk soaked into the stuffing.  I used the chicken flavor. I also used less milk.  I'm not sure how much just eyeballed it.  I didn't care for the ketchup flavor.  Next time I will leave off the ketchup all together.  My family all scrapped it off.  Overall though a very tasty meatloaf.

Only giving this 3 stars because I really didn't like the bits of crunchy onion. Next time I will sub onion powder. I really liked the sweetness from the brown sugar glaze. Put the glaze ON TOP!!

This came out okay.  It had a different taste to it.  But it was my first attempt ever at meatloaf so it could have just been me.  I'm going to give it a second chance but I wasn't overly impressed.

Loved it!  I used ground bison instead of beef and it turned out beautifully.  Also put the glaze on top instead of the bottom.  My boyfriend has been requesting it weekly.

This meatloaf is exceptional.  The only problem is the glaze was a little too sweet for a couple of members of my dinner guests.  Next time I plan to use less brown sugar.

I followed the recipe exactly, except to use the ketchup mixture on top, since that's the way I've always had meatloaf.  My husband took a bite of it and asked what was in it - he couldn't figure it out, took several more bites, than asked me if there was fish in it..!  I assume that was the ginger he could taste, since all the other ingredients are standard to meatloaf.  I will not be making this one again!

This was a great recipe.  I read the other reviews and made a few small changes though...  I only had 1 1/4 lbs of turkey, so I changed the ingredient quantities to make 6 serving sizes instead of 8.  I didn't go down to 5 serving sizes because I added 2 shredded carrots and 2 chopped celery stalks and 1/4 cup of chopped onion.  I soaked the bread crumbs in the milk as suggested.  I only had plain bread crumbs, so I added 2 teaspoons of italian seasoning to the bread crumbs.  I also added a pinch of garlic powder.  I used shredded cheddar and monterey jack cheese because that's what I had.  And finally, I added 1 tbsp of brown sugar to the ketchup.  I only cooked to 160 degrees (which took almost an hour) and let it rest under foil to 165.  The meatloaf was flavorful and moist.  I will definitely make it again.

I am no cook and this was easy, delicious and received RAVE reviews from our dinner guests. My husband and high doubts I could pull this off and all he kept saying through dinner was how good it was, really really good. I did use most of the suggestions to alter the recipe a little. I put the sauce on top only, not in the bottom of the pan, I used bread in the bottom to soak up the grease, used a quarter onion diced and onion soup mix, and adopted a few other ideas too. We paired with corn on the cob and mashed potatoes. It was a treat and I would make it again!

All 4 of my kids cleaned their plates!!  I did onion soup mix instead of onion.  Put bread on the bottom and did the sauce on top.  I did have to pour off grease once, but that was to be expected when cooking hamburger meat.. It is definitely smart to use 93/7 fat.. Otherwise you will have alot of grease!  I made extra of the brown sugar/ketchup/worchestire sauce and my hubby used it like a gravy.  He loved it!  Got to love a meal that makes you look like a Pro!

My 4 year old son, 1 year old daughter and my husband and I flat out dominated this meatloaf and then some. I made it with my mashed potatoes, there were no leftovers. I, too, did the mixture of brown sugar, ketchup and Worcestershire sauce and poured it on top. I put 2 slices of bread on the bottom and gave it a terrific crunch.  My first meatloaf was the best!

My first time making meatloaf and I've only had it a few times... This was really good! I just put italian bread crumbs instead of saltines and put the glaze on top. Yummy :)

This was excellent! I used groud turkey, added 1T worcestershire sauce to ketsup. Next time I might omit the brown sugar all together since I like salsa as the topping.  Will try again!

I used 1/4 cup brown sugar instead of 1/2 cup and 1/4 cup milk instead of 3/4 cup. Also used 1/2 package of onion soup mix instead of the onion. It's so good.

This dish is awesome! I was never a huge fan of meatloaf before I made this recipe but now it something we cook almost every week! Instead of placing the glaze on the bottom we put it on the top before cooking!

This is a great recipe for kids (mine are 4 and 6 and gobble it up). Also really good as leftovers. I added some A1 to the ketchup when I ran out of Worsc. sauce and it was pretty tasty.

This recipe was good.  I followed it exactly as written and although it was tasty, it wasn't to die for.  I don't think I will make this recipe again as it didn't live up to my expectations.

This was very good. However, I agree with some of the reviews that the brown sugar and ketchup need to be at the top. When the meatloaf was fully cooked, all of the grease mixed in with the ketchup and brown sugar.

this meatloaf was the best i have ever had my whole family enjoyed it i did use the onion soup mix instead but didnt change anything else. I put the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom and it did not stick just oil it just right and it will blend in with the meat.

My whole family enjoyed this meatloaf, even my husband liked it (which says a lot).  I would recommend mincing the onion finely and drizzling ketchup on top of the meatloaf before baking. Will definitely make again.

I have never made meatloaf before, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  Following the suggestions of others, I used 1/4 cup of each brown sugar and ketchup and added a splash of worcestershire sauce and used it as a glaze.  I used 1/4 cup of milk, doubled the ginger, and used crushed corn chips instead of crackers.  I also put in less salt and added a splash of soy sauce.  When the meatloaf came out, it looked fantastic and tasted very good.  I found it a bit mushy and there was too much onion for my taste.  I also found the sweetness of the glaze a little overpowering.  I think next time I make this, I'll use less glaze.  It was very good tasting and I found it nice that you can modify it to your own tastes.

Very, very good but very sweet.  Next time I'll cut the brown sugar in half. I used 1lb ground chicken and 1/2lb ground chuck.  Perfect blend. I did have to cook it about 75 minutes because of the chicken (takes longer).  When the meatloaf was done I put it under the broiler for 5mins and it made a nice crusty top.

The best meatloaf I’ve ever made. I did follow others suggestions and put the ketchup and brown sugar on top before cooking.  I made it as directed the first time with the ketchup and brown sugar on the bottom but it kind of got lost in the grease from the ground beef. Everyone  loves it!

Delicious comfort food!  My changes: added 1 t. minced garlic, 1/3 c. red onion, 1/3 c. green bell pepper, 1/3 c. canned mushrooms (drained), 2 green onions, 1 T. Worcestershire sauce, and 2 t. prepared mustard to meat mix; added 2 T. Worcestershire sauce to the glaze; used 1/4 – 1/2 c. milk in the meat mix and 1/4 c. of brown sugar in the glaze; used a little over 1/4 c. Italian bread crumbs and a little more than 1/2 c. rolled oats in place of cracker crumbs; put most of glaze on prior to cooking (on top of loaf), but basted meatloaf with remaining glaze 5 minutes before the end of cooking time.  My husband likes the glaze, so next time I will make some extra so that he can pour it over his meatloaf for use as extra sauce.  FYI: this meatloaf is great with ground beef only, but tastes just as good when 1/2 lb. ground turkey and 1 lb. ground beef are used---husband couldn’t tell the difference and neither could I!

This had a good sweet flavor. I did put minced carrots and celery in along with onion soup mix and put the sauce on the bottom and the top. It came out wonderfully! Will be making this again and again.

This meatloaf came out pretty tastey. The only change I made was the use of club crackers since I didn't have saltines and light brown sugar instead of dark. Mmm, the sause was deelish! Like others suggested, I put it on top instead of the bottom. Make extra cause you'll like it alot. My picky 5 yr old even ate this w/o any issues. It's a keeper, thanks tagastar.

holy moly!  this was awesome and even more awesome leftover!  here are the changes i made...followed the advice of reviewers.  increased ground beef to 2 pounds and kept the other measurements the same.  used onion soup mix instead of onion.  added 2 T worcestershire sauce to the ketchup.  realized i didn't have brown sugar and crackers...so just did without the brown sugar and topped the meatloaf with some chopped tomatoes and onions and used 3/4 cup quick oats instead of the crackers in the meatloaf mix. Leftover, we sliced the meatloaf and grilled it on the grill to warm it up.  I almost think it was better like that. This will become a regular staple in our house.  I think I will replicate my recipe…why mess up a good thing!

This meatloaf was so good. a few changes: 1. I put 1 TBS worchestshire sauce in the meat and the sauce. 2. I added 1 TBS and 1tsp of mustard to the sauce and used 1/4 cup sugar. 3. I sauteed the onion, green bell pepper, and a clove of garlic before I added it to the mixture. 4. I used quick oats instead of crackers (because that's what Paula Deen used) 5. I put the sauce on the top.

Quick and easy to make.  I make this a few times a month.  My husband loves it.  My mom makes it as well and the entire family enjoys it.  I have added some green or yellow bell peppers to this for added flavor.

I gave this four stars because it's not "the best" I've ever had. It's very close though. I'm going to keep tweaking with this recipe and will update as I do. Thanks for a great start though!

This is a very good meatloaf recipe!  I only made a few minor changes.  Instead of chopping up an onion, I used one packet of onion soup mix.  I also put about half the glaze at the bottom of the pan and poured the rest over the top of the meatloaf.  I also put four slices of partially cooked bacon over the top.  Yummy!

This is a favorite recipe for the family - I have made it over and over again.  In additonal to the recipe as shown I add 1/4 cup ketchup, 2 TBS Worsetershire sauce and 3/4 cup shredded cheddar and omit the ginger. Its a winner every time.

I love this recipe!  It's so easy that I almost have it memorized, which is something that I would never have imagined was possible. I am not a natural cook, but with four children, I have to learn, and what a great recipe to add to my growing file.  My kids are so excited when I say we are having meatloaf for dinner.

The taste was exceptional, but the fluids in mine were too much. I couldn't get them to cook down without overcooking it. I'll reduce the amounts next time I make this great tasting recipe.

I LOVED this meatloaf...and I don't usually like meatloaf. The sauce added a nice sweet taste and it bubbled up over the top while cooking. The smell was amazing! Used ground turkey and substituted potato flakes for the cracker crumbs (which gives you a smoother meatloaf texture). Will definitely make again.

This was good, but I think the sauce (Which was yummy) should have been on top.  I don't know why you would put it on the bottom...?  With a few changes I thought it was pretty good...

We love meatloaf and this is the very best one ever.  I didn't have any crackers so used homemade bread crumbs.  It is so moist and delicious.  Will be making this one again and again.  Thanks for sharing tangastar.

I added the Worcestershire sauce as the others suggested. I also put the sauce on top. The meatloaf was good, for a meatloaf. My husband thought it was to sweet though. I might make it again someday when he's not home...

Very good.  Took user suggestions and added 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce and a packet of onion soup mix. My family's consensus was too much flavor/zing.  Next time I will make the recipe as is with no modifications.  Thanks!

This is a very good meatloaf recipe, but I found it to be a little too greasy. Be sure to use the leanest beef possible to avoid the grease! However, a great recipe and family loved it!

I'd been searching for a meatloaf recipe that the whole family would enjoy.  I've found it with this recipe.  In fact, I chose to make it for our Christmas dinner for my husband and I and our 4 small children.  It was one of the few things I could think of that they all loved (besides the basic pizza and spaghetti)!  When my son's friends stay for supper, they devour it, too!  Delicious comfort food.  Thanks!

this was pretty good but a little to sugary for my family's taste. the juices at the bottom soaked up to the rest of the meatloaf and made it taste a little too sugary. i will probably just stick to the "incredibly cheesy meatloaf" recipe from this site.

This recipe is WONDERFUL!! I did follow some of the suggestions in the reviews. I used onion soup mix in place of the onion and added Worcestershire sauce in with the ketchup mix and spread it on the top of the meatloaf. My entire family loves this recipe. We have it a few times a month and I have some pretty picky eaters so it has to be awesome to get an all around 5 stars from my home!

Definitely cut down on the water (1/3 cup for me), and add the glaze on top for last 20 minutes of cooking.  Fantastic recipe though, I'll never make another meatloaf again.

Absolutely fabulous!  I cook for a Christian summer camp and made 14 meatloafs - I've never seen the line for seconds so long!  I didn't use all the ketchup/brown sugar mixture and I just put in on the top of the loaf, not the bottom.  High recommended!

Fantastic! I've made this a couple times now and just have a few changes: half turkey, half beef (less fat/more flavor), the brown sugar and ketchup mixture HAS to go on top to be any good, double the sauce (it's incredible), I used one large onion chopped very finely. IF you haven't made this yet... make it tonite. And add extra garlic too.

This is the best meatloaf I've ever made. I used 1/2 cup of milk and 1 egg. Also added 2 cloves minced garlic. I used 1/4 cup brown sugar and added a tbs of worcestershire to glaze. I also used glaze on tope instead of the bottom.

My family was very skeptical at first because they already liked the meatloaf recipe my mom uses but they seemed to enjoy this version as well.  They all agreed to four stars and they never agree on a rating.  This is definitely my new favorite meatloaf recipe!

Added 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tbsp worchestershire, reduced milk to 1/2 c. Reduced the ketchup and brn sugar to 1/4 c for the glaze.  We have done it with bread crumbs as well as cracker and prefer the cracker.  To soak up the grease/juices, put slices of bread on the bottom of the pan (cut/tear to fit), then add meat mixture on top.  We put the glaze on the top.  Yummy!    Very good recipe that appeals to all 5 of my children.

The flavor of the meatloaf was awesome, but i almost gave it 3 stars because it was just so oily. Maybe i did something wrong (this was my first attempt ever at meatloaf). Instead of using one big loaf pan, I used two smaller ones. The oil that collected on top of the loaves was just... kind of gross, it was A LOT. But maybe that's normal? Anyway thanks for a great tasting recipe.

I give this 4 stars! I loved it, my two yr old loved it and my husband! It was so easy to make. The only thing i changed was putting the brown sugar and ketchup on the top of the meatloaf, and also cooked it in a deep pan instead of a loaf. but shapped it into a loaf and cooked it, it held its shape. and turned out beautiful! Definitly will be making this again. :-) Thank you

This recipe was excellent.  I followed some of the helpful suggestions and put part of the ketchup and brown sugar on top and added Worcestershire sauce.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter.  Very good.

My husband has asked for meatloaf over and over and I have never made it, found this recipe and it was great!  He wiped his plate clean! A little bit salty for me, next time I will not put as much salt as the recipe calls for, used 1/4 cp brown sugar, 1/2 cp ketchup and a little worcestershire sauce for the glaze and put it on top (last 15 min. as suggested by another reviewer).  Also used only 1/2 cp milk like the other reviews.  It was wonderful, Thanks!

There is a reason this has so many 5 star reviews. I must say I was skeptical at first with the amount of brown sugar.I took the advise of other and added half to the bottom and half to the top. I also added worchershire to the sauce and 2-3 cloves of garlic to the meat. The only other thing I would do differently is bake it on a sheet pan for all over carmelization. Otherwise my boyfriend said this is the best meat loaf he has ever had. I will use this as my staple recipe from now on. Thank you so much for the delish recipe!!!

This was the best meatloaf I've ever made!!! I hate to make meatloaf for a few reasons one it takes for ever to cook and two most of the time it just doesn't turn out tasting good to me, now my boyfriend loves it no matter how bad I think it taste. This time was different we both loved it and it actually turned out great. I had to drain the grease a few times but other than that it was amazing. Thank you so much for this recipe I will definitely make this again. I think next time I am going to try making mini loafs as I've read that they cook faster.

The meatloaf is very good. But it took much longer than one hour to get done.  It is to much meat for a 9x5 loaf pan. Next time I will use a larger pan.  I put the catsup and brown sugar on the top.  That is a very good touch.

This was a fantastic recipe! I made some minor changes based on some of the other suggestions.  I added ketchup and brown sugar to both the top and the bottom of the meat loaf.  I also added a couple teaspoons of worcestershire sauce and 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder to the mix.  My boyfriend loved it! Thank you tangastar for sharing this recipe!

Best meatloaf I've ever had. I agree that the brown sugar should be slightly reduced in quantity and that it, along with the ketchup, should be on top of the loaf as opposed to the bottom. However, this recipe is SO GOOD either way.

This was a good basic recipe, but it did need adjusting. Per other reviewers, I reduced milk to 1/2 cup; I would probably reduce slightly more next time. I also reducedt the sugar to 1/4 cup, and that was plenty sweet. I added worcestire sauce to the glaze as well, and put it on top. Don't be afraid of the ginger. It adds that extra something, but you don't actually taste the ginger.

I havent made meatloaf very many times before and so I wasn't expecting any particular taste. I did cut the sugar in half because so many reviews said to do so, and was glad that I did because it was still very sweet. My husband loved it though and said it was some of the best meatloaf he had ever tasted, so it is definitely a keeper.

This is the reason why I love meatloaf.  It's a little sweet and the flavor is fantastic.  The only modification I did was using the onion soup mix instead of an onion.

I have made this lots of times. It is the best meat loaf I have ever made or for that fact, the best I have ever eaten. Sometimes I add some of the catsup mixture into the meat instead of pouring it on top. It is sooooo good. Even my kids like it and they used to be afraid of meatloaf.

This was reeeeally good meatloaf. Moist and flavorful. I left out the ginger for preference and added a few shots of worchestershire. Made more of the glaze too and put on top and the very end of baking.

Can I just say DELICIOUS!!  I hadn't made meatloaf in years until I tried this recipe and so far I have made it at least 3 times in 2 months.  I too put the ketchup and brownsugar on the top it didn't seem to make sense on the bottom.  This last time I decided to put 1/4 cup each of ketchup and brown sugar in the mix also since I do like sweet.  Well it was even better but I will lighten up on the brown sugar next time. It was tasty but a little less will do the trick.

This is the only version of meatloaf my family ever asks for me to make. Then my neighbor, a very fussy eater, tried it. Now I am asked to make extra for her! It's definitely different than a traditional loaf but that sweet mixed with savory meat is exceptional.

My entire family loves this recipe.  Like others, I put the brown sugar and ketchup on top.  I reduced the amount of milk as well.  I used Lipton onion soup mix instead of chopped onions.  And by mistake one day, I picked up curry power and put it in after I thought I forgot the ginger.  My husband actually sent me a text telling me how great it was!

Yum. BUT... DEFINITELY need the LEAN ground beef. If you use regular it's just swimming with grease/fat that couldn't even be drained. I had to blot with a paper towel like crazy and still thought it was too fatty and moist... Oh, used breadcrumbs instead of saltines, added worchestershire sauce to glaze plus sauteed the onions in it, put a bit of glaze at bottom but most on top.

About to make this for the 3rd time. It's so good you really don't need to look for any other recipe. I took others advice though and put a LITTLE of the ketchup/sugar/worcesteshire (oh, I added worcesteshire to the mix) on the bottom of the pan and the rest on the TOP about 20 minutes after putting it in the oven. This is just KNOCKOUT good....maybe too good since you want to eat it even after you are full :(

This is a great meatloaf recipe. I added about 1/4 tsp of ground mustard to the meat mixture and next time I am going to add a finely chopped green pepper. For the glaze, I used about 2 heaping Tbsp of brown sugar so it wouldn't be so sweet. I also added a couple good shakes of worcestershire sauce and some fresh lemon juice to the brown sugar and ketchup. I didn't use the glaze until a half hour before taking it out of the oven. Delish! I think this will be my meatloaf recipe from now on since the others I tried never seemed so good to me.  I used 2 lbs of meat so there would be leftovers for sandwiches. Glad to have this one!!

This was good. I did follow some other reviewers advice and put the ketchup/brown sugar on top. Other than that I pretty much made it as written.

This was easy to make and very good. I followed the reviews of others and cut back on the ketchup and brown sugar. I also put it on the top of the meatloaf. I will make this again!

I made this meatloaf for my husband and  I haven't tried this at all because I don't eat red meat. So accordingly to him this dish was good but it wasn't the best meatloaf. As suggested by other reviewers, I added only 1/2 cup of milk, 1 agg and bread crumbs instead of saltine crackers. I also added a dash of worcestershire sauce to the ketchup mixture and added a few slices of bacon on the top. Instead of using a 5x9 loaf pan I shaped the meatloaf and put in a casserole dish. Baked covered for 45 minutes and uncovered for 15 minutes.

Not being from this country, I have heard of, but never eaten meatloaf. This was my first attempt at making and eating it, and it was fantastic. I did modify it by using extra lean ground turkey, homemade whole wheat breadcrumbs, and added garlic and cayenne pepper because I like my food spicey. I am now a fan of meatloaf! FANTASTIC

This recipe just didnt turn out and I had high hopes for it.  My sister tried it and said that it would work better with ground pork instead of beef since it was too sweet. I think the brown sugar mixture on the bottom was a bad move.  If I ever make this again ill try putting it on top and using the pork.

This was really good, but next time I will cut the brown sugar a bit. It was a little too sweet for me. I used 1 pound of ground turkey and cut all ingredients accordingly except the eggs and onion. Also I used Ritz crackers. Finally..I would make sure to chop the onion very fine and make sure to get a small onion unless you like a lot of onion.

Made this for dinner tonight, with a few modifications.  I used bread crumbs, not crackers; added a few fresh mushrooms.  I also put the glaze on top.  It turned out really delicious, and moist.  The glaze was a bit sweet for my taste and I will add a bit less sugar next time.  Very good recipe overall and will make this again!

My husband loved this! The only thing I did differently was to mix the brown sugar and ketchup to put on top of the loaf before baking. Doing it the way it said in the recipe would have made an awful mess.

This recipe was excellent. Most of my attempts at something different end in hunger and misery, but this was quite the opposite. Followed others great advice and also added diced green bell pepper, about 2/3 the amount of the onion. Boyfriend impressed, and self!

I changed the serving size to 5 and took the suggestions of others;  I used less milk, added one slice of bread to the meat (it seamed to need it) and split the brown sugar and ketchup, half on the bottom of the pan, other half on top. I also didn't grease the bottom of the pan, it didn't need it.  It turned out excellent

I liked this.The topping is very sweet ,but that's the way i like it.But i wouldn't recommend putting the brown sugar/ketchup topping on the bottom of the pan ,it does nothing to flavor the meat and sticks to the bottom of the pan.

I also put the glaze on top like others and don't use a pan...however, I bet it has a nice crunchy layer the pan way-just a different technique...one thing I always do before making meatloaf is saute my vegetables and spices together before I mix them into the meat. This way the spices come alive and my onions are never crunchy. I also add a bell pepper if I have one handy. And sometimes some cooking sherry to the glaze. But without those additions this recipe is still fantastic, I only give 4-stars though because I this it should tell you to cook the vegetables before mixing.

I don't really like meatloaf, but my husband does; so I made this for him a couple of times. Even though he is the pickiest eater you can find, he really loves this meatloaf - says it's nice and sweet and yummy. This is now my go-to recipe for meatloaf - I don't even attempt to make any other or modify this one. I did cut the brown sugar and ketchup layers in half though and put the other half on top - this makes it sweet with the first and last bite. Just make sure not to overstuff your pan with meat - I did that once and the brown sugar mixture on top leaked all over my oven.

I would give this 10 stars if I could.  amazing.  Here's my changes that made it PERFECT.  Even my daughter who is picky and crinkled her nose up at it ate it all and my 3 year old ate 3 servings!  I put a package of onion soup, and like other reviewers put the ketchup mixture on top. I did minimize the brown sugar to 1/4 cup.  It was the perfect recipe.

Excellent. I used 3 pounds of beef. [wanted sandwiches]So I doubled the ingriedents, except for the eggs, kept those at two. Used one loaf pan: so I had to up my cooking time 2 hrs. at 350*. I covered my meatloaf with foil the first hour, I didn't want it to burn. Used a fat seperator and thickened the sauce up a little, that was good, a little sweet for gravy but good.Will make again

This was very tasty.  I did mix the brown sugar and ketchup together and put it on top instead on the bottom as the other users suggested.  I loved the ginger in it! Hubby says this one is a keeper. Will be making again!

Okay, my father is the master of meatloaf in our house, and when I made this, he said it was the best he had ever had!  So needless to say, it was excellent.  I, along with countless others, wondered what good the sauce would be on the bottom...so I formed my loaf and then mixed the brown sugar, ketchup and a dash of worchestershire, then spread over the top.  I put a few slices of bread on the side to soak up the grease, and voila!--the best meatloaf.  It's definately a keeper.

I love this recipe!  I make the recipe as is but instead of making one big loaf, I make this with a cupcake pan and then it doesn't take as long to cook. Just 30 minutes.

This is the first time i've tried to make meatloaf i found this to sweet.I think i should have followed advice and put the sugar and ketchup to the bottom rather than the top. Will do this the next time

simply delicious. if i could eat this all day, every day, i would! i put a couple of slices of bread at the bottom of the pan to suck up the juice/fat when cooking and i doubled the sauce recipe and put it all on top. i then mixed a separate cup of the sauce and put it in the oven to warm up for 5 mins before the meatloaf was done - this way we had even more sauce on hand to slather on top of the meat :)

Definitely a keeper.  I use bread crumbs instead of crackers.  I also baked with glaze on top of the meatloaf.  We make a double batch now because the kids love it and will eat it for snacks!!

Turned out terrible, I have no idea how I messed it up, but I just didn't like the flavor, I prefer traditional flavored meatloaf.

Great Recipe!  I used 1/2 c milk as others had suggested & it was very moist.  Works well with BBQ sauce (in pan & on top of meatloaf) instead of catsup/brown sugar mix.  Family loved it :-)

This recipe takes Meatloaf to a whole new level for me and I love the sweetness of the brown sugar but I would suggest putting the ketchup and brown sugar on top not the bottom.

My boyfriend, who normally will not eat anything that ketchup has been near, loved it! I used Worcestershire sauce with the brown sugar/ketchup mix, and added some to meat and glazed the rest over top.

Awesome and easy!  I did add about 1/3 tsp. dry mustard, (sorry, couldn't help myself) and I would recommend running a knife around the edge of the pan before you flip the meatloaf out on a platter.  Will make again and again!

I definitely enjoyed this recipe. I did make some modifications that others mentioned.  I used breadcrumbs instead of crackers, onion soup mix instead of onions, I did put bread on the bottom of the pans and I mixed ground turkey with the leanest beef I could find. I also put bbq sauce in the glaze and put that on top.  Next time I would add some heat, hot sauce or maybe hot peppers

Yummy, yummy! After 16 yrs of marriage and 3 kids I have made a LOT of meatloaf but this is the best. I followed the suggestions from H2OSMILES on the first page and it was great. Baked it in a cake pan instead of a loaf pan and it was much better!

I thought this recipe was extremely easy.  However, I made some significant changes.  To be honest, I was too lazy to go to the store to pick up ingredients so I substituted quite a bit and it turned out wonderful.  I only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar as other have recommended.  Instead of ketchup, I used enchilada sauce (this was the improv part, but it turned out AWESOME).  I also went with my theme and added corn.  What a delicious dish!  I didn't add milk or eggs (the milk I forgot to add and the egg I didn't have), but I did add garlic.  I also poured the sauce on top instead of the bottom.  This is a definite new favorite!

I would give this 3 1/2 stars if I could. The meatloaf was really good - very moist, but the glaze was too sweet for my taste and my husband's. I would make this again, but maybe halve the brown sugar next time.

not too bad but i think next time i'll definitely take it out of the oven periodically and drain it and i think i'll add the glaze after only it's half-done.  other than that it's pretty good.  i'm not a huge onion fan so i think i'll substitute dried minced onions or onion powder or onion soup mix instead of real onion next time.  it was a bit too firm so maybe i'll also try one less egg or more crackers too.  the ginger gave it great flavor, i thought.

This is a really great meatloaf recipe. I did add about a TBSP of dry Ranch dressing mix and some garlic powder. It turned out great. I like some other viewers baked it in small loaf pans and made holes in the bottom of the pans for the fat to drain and placed it on a baking sheet. Will make again for sure.

Great meal, but instead of ketchup on the top I added a can of tamato sauce and used less than 1/2 cup of brown sugar,also saute the onoions before mixing in, other than that tasted great.

The sauce/topping was a little too sweet, and we wanted a bit more flavor/spice in the meat. That said, we ate every bite! :)

This is excellent. As others have said I am also not a big meatloaf fan, but others in my house are.  So now I can please them and not have to make something I do not like.  I will definitely make this one again!

Son and hubby love this!  I used 1/3 cup brown sugar, mixed some of the ketchup and brown sugar in with the meat and the rest on top, and instead of saltines I used buttery wheat crackers.  Yum.

Good recipe!  Added a little ketchup to the top and also a meatloaf seasoning packet.  If it were a little more moist, I'd give it 5 stars.

I did not like this recipe at all but my husband thought it was pretty good so I decided to give it 4 stars. If I ever make this again, I will put the brown sugar and ketchup on the top of the meat, Maybe it would have given it more flavor. For some reason my loaf wouldn't stay together when I was slicing it so it left a messy presentation. Not sure why this got so many 5 stars. Needs more flavor!!

I made this last night for dinner and my family loved it!  My husband took what was left over to work for lunch today.  I didn't change any of the ingredients, I only changed how it was prepared.  I mixed the meatloaf as directed and instead of putting in a loaf pan, I placed it on a baking sheet and molded it into a loaf.  Then I combined the brown sugar and ketchup and poured in on top of the meat loaf.  It seemed to soak into the meatloaf a little more than placing it on the bottom.  I will be making this again!!

My go to meatloaf recipe! I add garlic but besides that I make no other changes and its delicious! Occassionally i do use italian bread crumbs instead of saltines and its great that way too. Love it! I tried putting the ketchup/sugar on top but it just melts off so i keep it on the bottom.

I followed the advice of other reviewers, and only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar, added at tablespoon of worsterchire, and put the glaze on the top of the meatloaf.  It was excellent, and made great leftovers!!

I've made a few Meatloafs from this site.  This was one of the better ones we tried.  The big change I made while cooking was to cook 4 smaller loafs on a wire rack on top of a drip pan and not in a loaf pan.  All the drippings and grease were at the bottom of the pan.  We dressed the loafs with the ketchup/brown suger mixture twice during the cooking.  All and all, it turned out very well.  Hope this helps.

This meatloaf was perfect.  Added some spices to the ground beef and some of the brown sugar and ketchup mixture.  Everybody loved it even the very fussy ones.

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out absolutely delicious. Moist, and a nice flavor with the ginger in it. My husband called me from work to tell me how much he liked it. He works nights and takes leftovers for dinner so he loved it even a day old. :)Of course with the sugar and ketchup it was a hit with my 3 year old. I will be making this recipe again.

I'm not a big fan of meatloaf but this was okay. I made meatloaf muffins because I didn't have a loaf pan and placed the ketchup & brown sugar mixture on top. My boyfriend is a big fan of meatloaf but not sweets so he liked the meatloaf but thought the topping was just okay and i enjoyed the topping more than meatloaf... but for meatloaf it was good.

Delicious!  I love the sweetness from the brown sugar, but it's a touch too sweet.  Recommend 1/4 c.  I also highly recommend using buffalo meat!  It's very lean and the flavor is wonderful.  Great with "Twice-Baked Mashed Potatoes"

This is a super meatloaf recipe. Hubby said he would give this more than 5 stars if he could.  I debated on whether to put the brown sugar/ketchup mix on the top or bottom after reading reviews.  I usually never make my meatloaf in a loaf pan.  I asked around on the Recipe Exchange and decided to try this as is.  It turned out moist, flavorful and the topping was fine when I turned it out on the platter to serve.  I love the addition of ginger, not overpowering just a little something different.  Thanks for sharing this.

It was okay. Nothing out of the ordinary. I cut the sugar in half, mixed it with the ketchup and added a T of worcestire sauce and poured it on top of the loaf. Next time I will make it with the full sugar amount for comparison. My husband liked it though.

I must be missing something because I found this meatloaf very bland and not worth the 4 1/5 stars that it has. It really had not flavor. I gave it 2 stars because I loved the brown sugar bottom glaze.

Yummy!!! Best meatloaf ever! I did everything exactly as directed, except I put the brown sugar and ketchup on top, and made the loaf in a glass baking dish. My 3 & 5 year old boys devoured this - great easy meal that kids love!!

I gave this 4 stars only because it was the sauce that made this recipe so wonderful! You could really make your own version of meatloaf and use this sauce and it would be wonderful. I did cut back a little on the vinegar. Thanks for the recipe! I will definitely use again!

Yum!  Made this last night for my boyfriend and I and it was great.  I followed the advice of many others and put the brown sugar/ketchup on the top instead of bottom and I think that really helps.  Really easy recipe, will definitely make this again.  Thanks!

I used turkey instead of beef. Personally, I thought this was delicious. My teens didn't like it.  I don't think it was the recipe, I think it was that they just don't like meatloaf.

I made this the other day following the recipe as written and it was good. The next day we reheated leftovers and it was AMAZING!! My husband is never very excited about food but he could not stop talking about this meatloaf. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good. I used quick oates in place of the saltine crackers. I also put the glaze on top of the loaf. Very much like mom's meatloaf.

3/23/09 UPDATE:  My family are very picky as I have stated before, yesterday my husband asked me to make this meatloaf and ate about half of it!!!!  This is truly a great recipe. -----------------------------------------  I made this for my family of picky eaters and my husband said it was a keeper, and the next time we were having or going to a party to make it for that.

I'm glad I read the reviews and made a few alteration.  Loaf - reduced milk to 1/2 cup, and used bread crumbs.  Glaze - reduced sugar to 1/3 cup and added about 1 tsp on Worchesterchire sauce.  Put the glaze on top. Everyone, really enjoyed this one.  This will replace my meatloaf recipe, which is good but not quite as good.

I tend to have issues keeping my meatloaf moist, and with this recipe I had no problems! Very easy and very good. I did add Worchestire sauce to the ketchup/brown sugar mixture. Not an exact amount, I just poured some in. This will be kept in my recipe book for many years. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious, just as it is written!  (I did use half ground turkey, but I dont think it affected the flavor)  This is the first time I've ever made meatloaf and I see no need to try any other recipes.  Although next time, I will cut down on the sugar in the glaze.

I agree with another reviewer in that this came out a little too dense for my taste. I loved the brown sugar topping though. I will continue to keep looking for the best meatloaf recipe. Thanks for the post though!

I used bread crumbs instead of saltines, just because I didn't have any. The texture was fine, but it wasn't very flavorful, and it was very thick and dense. I like my meatloaf a little lighter. Also, my family decided that we don't like cooked ketchup. Every time I try to make something with a ketchup topping, none of us like it. So I've vowed never to try that aspect again. It wasn't a terrible recipe, it just wasn't our favorite. But then again, we don't have a favorite meatloaf....so maybe it's just us :)

You need to understand that I hate meatloaf. The only reason I made this was because of friend of mine who had been eating mush for the last two weeks asked for meatloaf when I asked her over for dinner. THIS MEATLOAF IS AWESOME!!!!! I love it. So simple, so good!

Turkey Meatloaf!!!  Ground turkey and italian seasoned breadcrumbs instead of crackers. I used the leanest turkey I can find. Before serving, when you turn it over on to a serving dish, the bottom of the pan is now the topping.  Don't worry about measuring the ketchup + brown sugar, just thickly coat the bottom of the pan with it, can't go wrong!

This is the most wonderful meatloaf I have ever tried!  My husband loved it too.  I went ahead and put the brown sugar and ketchup on top of the meatloaf instead of on the bottom based on the other reviews. The brown sugar soaked into the meatloaf giving it a wonderful flavor!  The only other thing I changed was that I used garlic Club crackers instead of saltines because that is what I had on hand. I'll do it the same way next time I make it for sure.

This was the best meatloaf I have ever had! It was incredibly moist and didn't fall apart. I made some minor changes; I added 1-2 tablespoons minced garlic, 1 tsp thyme, and 1 tsp rosemary and omitted ginger. Also, I put the loaf in a shallow baking pan and covered it with the glaze. instead of it being on the bottom. It was quickly eaten at dinner- no left overs! Highly recommend!

I thought this meatloaf was great!  I accidentally left the milk out...but I thought that was a strange ingredient for meatloaf anyway.  I wonder what it would have been like with it.  I also put the glaze on top instead of underneath.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've been trying for years to find a fool proof meatloaf recipe.  I've finally found it!!!  I, like other reviewers, use only 1 egg and 1/2 cup of milk.  Also, I add a dash of worchestershire sauce to the ketchup/sugar mixture.  SO DELICIOUS!!!!

I've made this recipe as written but last night I made the following chgs:   ..Added 1/2 lb Italian Sweet Sausage to the ground meat. ..Added 1/2 cup of chopped red, orange and yellow bell peppers and garlic to the onion and sauteed. ..added fresh chopped parsley. ..Used dried bread crumbs instead of crackers. We liked these changes very much.  I've made the changes on my recipe card and this is what I'll use from now on. Yummy!

I don't know if anyone else makes mealoaf from gound pork but this meatloaf is perfect for pork. After reading many of the reviews, I decided to add a packet of onion soup mix and one tablespoon worcestirshire to the meat mixure and another tablespoon to the ketchup. If you add these though, you should omit the salt. I didn't and it was a little salty but still fabulous. I decreased the milk slightly and increased the cracker crumbs slightly(i used Ritz). I put the glaze on top. I don't use a loaf pan as i find meatloaf is much better if it's just shaped and cooked on a baking sheet. I can see why this recipe is so popular. It is fantastic.

This recipe was easy & delicious. I made a few adjustments. I added a packet of lipton onion soup mix to ground beef. This added to the flavor. I also added 2 tablespoons of worcester sauce. being the cheese lover that I am, I also used crushed cheez-it crackers instead of saltine crackers. The end result was fantastic!

I modified using Bison burger which is very lean.  Personally, I liked the sweetness and put 1/2 of the brown sugar mixture on bottom & 1/2 on top...will make more of it to put on next time and try it using venison.    I have never made a meatloaf before I though would be good enough to feed someone not in my family (as they are hostages at dinner time :>)..but this is good enough to bring somewhere and know there will be no leftovers.

Very good meatloaf.  The meatloaf I usually make is not as dense as this one so it falls apart easily.  This one does not.  I took one persons idea of putting bread on the bottom to soak up the grease.  Then I flipped the whole pan over to serve.  It soaked up the grease but also the brown sugar.  I would maybe put the topping on top next time.

Oh my goodness! Best meatloaf ever! (Sorry, Mom!) I did put the ketchup/brown sugar glaze over the top, though. Seemed more logical to me.

This is a wonderful meatloaf!  The only changes I made was to substitute Rice Milk for the milk and ground Gluten-Free Oats for the crumbs.  My family is gluten free/dairy free.  My boys love this meatloaf :)

We loved this! We must be the exception though, cause we wanted MORE sweetness! I only used about 1/4 cup and put it on the bottom as stated in recipe. Next time I'll use the full 1/2 cup. I added some ketchup to the meat and used onion soup mix as others along with plain and seasoned bread crumbs instead of crackers. Used one egg, 1/2 cup milk and no ginger (forgot actually!!) I also had to bake it quite a bit longer, so I'll raise the temp to 365 or 375 next time. This is our new meatloaf recipe! Thanks!

This is the best meatloaf I have ever tasted!!  My kids LOVE it! We press 1/2 of the meatloaf in the bottom, add pepper jack cheese to the center, then press the other half over the cheese...the combination of sweet and heat is amazing!!

My husband loved this! I did make a couple of the suggested modifications: onion soup mix instead of chopped onion, also added dry mustard, Worcestershire sauce to cut down on the sweetness and put some sauce on the top. Delicious!

I believe if I would have read the reviews it would have saved this 3 star rating. This is not a bad recipe but I suggest not to use the 3/4c of milk maybe 1/2c or even 1/4c. I put the brown sugar/ketchup at the bottom...that was the wrong thing to do. It tasted like sugar the whole bottom of the meatloaf. I had to cut the bottom off it was to much. I would only use about 1/4c of brown sugar if that on top of the meatloaf mixed with ketchup and whocestershire sauce. I think the milk made this meatloaf bland. I think this would have been alright if followed some of the reviewers.

Absolutely the best meatloaf i've ever had.  I dreamed of leftover meatloaf sandwiches for two days.  I substituted crushed Annie's Whole Wheat Bunnies for the saltines and used just a little bit of brown sugar and ketchup for the top rather than the bottom.  I also used 2 pieces of bread to sop up the grease at the bottom, which worked well.  Can't wait to make this again, along with the baby dill carrots and a side of mashed potatoes!

Wow! I really loved this. My hubby on the other hand is not a big meatloaf eater. He just said it was good. My daughter who is 2 yo loved it. She gobbled it down and wanted more. She usually doesn't eat meat. So I will definitely be making this again. Also, I did make one change instead of putting it in a loaf pan I made it into a loaf so the fat could drain. It was delicious!

Very, very good meatloaf.  I followed the other's advice and halved the brown sugar.  It was still a little too sweet for me, but I will definitely make it again and just cut down a little more on the sugar.  I also put some extra onion, garlic, A1 and celery.  I kept the ketchup mixture at the base of the pan but brushed it over the top about half way through.  Excellent.

I made this recipe a few weeks ago and it is the best meatloaf I have had.  It has become "the" meatloaf I make and will only use this recipe from now on.  The only thing i changed was I used plain breadcrumbs in place of the crackers because that is what I had on hand.  What a fabulous recipe!

This is a tasty loaf. My husband really likes this recipe. He request it every week. He also insists that I make double the recipe so he can have meatloaf sandwiches for lunch for the week. Needless to say it is a well used recipe in our household.

This is the best meatloaf I have ever had.  I used 2 pounds of beef, doubled the glaze, used more ketchup so it wasn't quite as sweet and I put the glaze on the top and the bottom because it was delicious. The ginger is unexpected and wonderful.  I used bread crumbs instead of crackers because I didn't have any.  Thank you so much for such a great recipe. I will definitely make this again

***** *****  I love this recipe...I double the sugar/ketchup and mix it together and pour it on the bottom....I do not change anything..though I usually don't have 1.5 pounds so I will use 1 pound of beef and keep everything else the same...this is the only meatloaf I like....We eat the entire thing..any leftovers are  used as sandwiches the next day...I have played with the recipe a bit but really only like the original and now won't make it any other way (except for doubling the sauce).  Not too sweet for me I love it and so does my son and my sister's family does now too.

It's not bad, but I really didn't care for it as a meatloaf recipe.  It's a little too sweet for me and I didn't even use as much sugar as the recipe called for.

This recipe is yummy! The only thing I did different was to use a packet of Onion soup mix instead of the onion. Everyone loved it! I will definitely make again, Thanks!

I've made this recipe and handed it out many times. Lessen Brown Sugar to 1/4c and use only 1/2c milk and you will have an extra delicious meatloaf! This recipe is very forgiving as you may add additional spices too.YUM-YUM!!

Best meatloaf ever!  I mixed the ketchup and brown sugar together and spread it on top of the meatloaf.  I also added worcestershire sauce to the meat mixutre and to the ketchup and brown sugar.  Came out excellent.

When I first read this recipe, I thought, that's going to be too sweet.  But then I saw all the very positive reviews and said, what the heck... I may be wrong.  I made this exactly as the recipe is written out, and found myself wishing I had listened to my instincts.  Too sweet for my taste, and I'm not sure I like the ginger in a meatloaf.  That's probably just me though, because I like a more savory than sweet flavor to meatloaf.

Made this tonight for dinner and it was delicious!  Very moist and will make it again.  I made the meatloaf and placed the brown sugar glaze on top.  I did not add the ginger as I do not care for the taste of it. Truly a great comfort food meal with mashed potatoes.

This is a very good simple recipe that doesn't require items that are not on hand to start with. I did cut back on the sugar per many reviews, it was still sweet enough. I did make the recipe upside-down and it turned out wonderful and moist!

This was the first time I made a meatloaf I was willing to eat.  It was very good, although I made a few small changes.  Fist, I halved the recipe as not to make a lot of something I wasn't sure I'd like. I put 2 pieces of bread on the bottom of the loaf pan to absorb grease as recommended by another reviewer. I used a little onion powder and spread the ketchup mixture to the top in the last 15 minutes of cooking.  Was very easy to make and my husband really liked it!

This was excellent, my family loved it! No leftovers, infact next time will ahve to make a double batch!!! Only changes: I used buttered round crackers instead on saltines, package of onion soup in place of the onion, no ginger added as I didnt have any, and the ketchup glaze was put on top rather than the bottom. I did cook in a loaf pan and it turned out wonderful!!! I will make again and again, just double batch next time so we have leftovers!! Thank you :)

Great meatloaf!! Sticks together nicely and has a great taste. I used a dash or worstershire sauce and cinnamon in the recipe as well. I used a baking pan and formed my loaf. I then glazed the loaf every 15 minutes with the topping. My husband loved it! Definite keeper.

FEAR NOT THE UPSIDE-DOWNNESS  There is a trick to this recipe and that is FOLLOW IT. Use LEAN ground beef (I used 93%) and then the juices from the meat mix with the brown sugar and ketchup at the bottom to form the most delightful glaze/gravy. There wasn't even enough grease to congeal on the left overs in the fridge. It might be a tad sweet for some, but we loved it. So trust the recipe - do it as written.

I hate meatloaf.  My husband, however, loves the stuff and finds it annoying that we've had meatloaf twice in the nearly 8 years we've been married.  I made this for Christmas dinner and he loved it, the kids loved it, and even I enjoyed it!!  As others mentioned, I put the ketchup, ect ingredients on top of the meatloaf instead of on the bottom of the pan.  I may start making meatloaf regularly now...

This was pretty good.  I followed a lot of the suggestions in the reviews... used lean ground turkey, dry pkg onion soup instead of onion, put bread on the bottom of the pan to catch grease, mixed ketchup and brown sugar together and put on top of the meatloaf.

I made this exactly as the recipe suggested.  It was delicious.  My husband scarfed it down.  After adding the milk, it does seem like the loaf is kind of mushy - however it cooks up just fine, great texture.  I might mince the onions next time, I did kind of a big chop.  I also like the hint of ginger.  Hard to go wrong with this one.  Thanks!

I read some of the reviews and incorporated  a few of the  changes that were suggested.  It turned out great!  I put the sauce with 1/4 cup of sugar on top, put two pieces of bread in the bottom of the pan to soak up the fat, used onion soup mix instead of onions and decreased the salt to 1/2 teas.,and used 1# ground beef and 1# ground pork for the meat. It took an hour and 15 minutes to cook because of the extra meat but the size was just right.

I was really surprised and disappointed that this recipe has so many high reviews. The part of the meatloaf not touching the ketchup and sugar was absolutely dry and bland.  I took it out of the oven before the hour was up because it was looking so dry.  The milk did nothing for flavor.  I did dare eat two slices of this, and the second one I coated with worchestershire sauce which helped immensely.  So I'll make this again but will add plenty of worchestershire sauce and perhaps canned tomatoes instead of the milk.  The brown sugar with the ketchup IS delicious on it.

Really an easy dish to make.  I modified it by using Ritz crackers,putting a thin layer of brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom and top of the loaf, and I added a tsp of Lea&Perrins.  I also substituted turkey for beef.

I liked this but next time I will use half as much brown sugar, it was a tad too sweet for me.

Mmmmm!  I made a few changes and substitutions to make this dairy and soy free.  I used hemp milk in place of the milk and finely ground pretzels in place of the saltines.  I put half the ketchup/brown sugar on the bottom and the other half on the top as a glaze.  This slightly sweet meatloaf is super yummy!  I will definitely make again and again.

This was delicious, though I made a few changes. I mixed the brown sugar and ketchup and put it on top of the meatloaf. Instead of using an onion, I used dry onion soup mix, and I added french fried onions on top for a little extra crisp. Also, I found if I fill a loaf pan it's much harder to drain all the grease, so I shape into a loaf in a bigger pan. Delicious! Recieved many compliments.

Love this!  Add slices of wheat bread to the bottom of the pan to absorb fat/oil.  Also, put ketchup mixture on the top of the meatloaf.

This was the best meatloaf recipe I have used, and one of the easiest.  I loved not having to make the sauce separate.  My kids devoured it.  Also, it made an excellent sandwich on lightly toasted bread the next day- can't believe I was lucky enough to have leftovers!

This meatloaf is very good.

For this recipe, I made a few minor modifications to adjust to my family's tastebuds.
I used a meatloaf mixture which includes beef, pork, and veal. I chopped and sauteed some peppers and onions. I doubled up on the seasonings and on the sauce. I also included a sprinkle of cumin and corriander. I put the sauce to put some on the bottom and on the top.

Great recipe!  Easy to modify.  Thank you for sharing.

This recipe is delicious!  It is truly a nice change from the usual meatloaf.  I happened to have all of the ingredients lying around my house and was bored yesterday so I decided to finally try it out.  I took other reviewers' advice and sauteed the onions to soften them a bit, as well as mixing the ketchup, brown sugar, and a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce in a bowl and spreading it over the top of the meatloaf as opposed to the bottom.  I didn't have a loaf pan, so I just formed it into a loaf in one of those aluminum disposable pans.  It came out great!  This is going into my rotation, thank you very much!

This was the best meatloaf I've had in years!  I followed others advice and made meatloaf cupcakes in order to speed cooking time (and made it easier for serving to my 2 year old).  I did put sauce on top AND bottom as suggested and I added worstechire sauce to the sauce.

Super yummy!!!  I would leave some of the sauce for dipping.  It soooo good.  The first time I sauteed the onions to soften them because my husband is not a big onion fan but I forgot the second time.  If you do not like crunchy onions, saute them first.  Also, make sure to use ground sirloin.  The second time I used ground round and it wasn't as good.  And I love the bread on the bottom of the pan, it works really well.  I gave it to my dogs as a treat.

I'm not a meatloaf eater, but I've really enjoyed this recipe. My husband loves meatloaf, so I wanted to find something that would work for both of us. This recipe was a winner!

Being a picky eater, I either omit the onions or brown them before adding them. There have been a few times where this hasn't been cooked all the way through, so I leave it in the oven an extra 5-10 min.

This meatloaf is very good, but a few tips: First, when the meatloaf is almost done, put on a baking sheet with the glazed portion on top.  Continue to bake until finished; this will give the top a very appealing look, and will remove it from the grease in the original baking pan.  Also, instead of using crackers, take some white bread slices, run them through your food proccessor (or chop until fine with a good knife on a cutting board) and replace crackers with the bread.  Otherwise, a very nice family dish.

I have made this recipe for my family twice in the last 2 weeks and again tonight due to my family requesting it so much. When I tried this recipe I was looking for a new way to get away from the old boring meatloaf that no one really cared for. My family now loves my new meatloaf.Thank You!

This is a great recipie. The only thing I did differently is instead of cracker crumbs, I used mashed potatoe flakes, because that is what I always use in meatloaf. I love what the brown sugar brought to this dish. meatloaf has always been in our regular meal rotation, and from now on we will always make it with brown sugar.

Outstanding!  After cooking, drain juices, remove fat, invert meatloaf onto a platter, then pour juice over meatloaf and serve as a sauce with meatloaf.

This meatloaf is AMAZING!!  It is most and delicious.  I have been making this recipe for years now and it by far is the best meatloaf I have ever had.  My husband equally LOVES it.  It is also great the day after between 2 slices of bread- makes a great day after sandwich.

This was amazing, it was probably the best meatloaf I have ever had.  I did cook the brown sugar and ketchup / worshister mixture on top instead of the bottom and I also baken in a narrow cassarole dish because its easier to drain off the fat.  I served this with the Families Creamed Spinach from this site, it was wonderful.

This recipe was so easy and my family loved it!  I doubled the recipe and baked in a 13x9x2" glass baking dish. I mixed the brown sugar and ketchup together and poured over the top of the meatloaf before baking. Definitely a do again - thanks!

The recipe was great-although I went with the suggestions that others had made and then made some of my own.  I changed the meat from 1 1/2 lbs to 2 lbs and I added worcestershire sauce to the meat and to the ketchup.  I used oats instead of crackers and mixed the brown sugar and ketchup/worc. mix together and put that on top of the meat in the loaf pan.  I cooked it for 1 hour and it was perfect.

I made this with turkey to be a little bit more healthy.  I added some worcestersire sauce as well as garlic and it came out perfectly cooked and yummy.  Not the greatest recipe for meatloaf but simple and easy to do.

The ONLY reason I am giving this a 4 star is because my 18 month old NEVER eats any meat other than chicken and he ate about a fourth of it lastnight! i cut the recipe down to half because I never cook a whole pound of beef for any meal. As for me I found it WAY too sweet but i probably screwed it up somewhere! I might make it again only for him to eat though. I didnt even offer it to my husband ended up making him soup instead. but thanks again for the recipe my kid ate good LOL.

This is a great Meatloaf. My husband loves meatloaf and had two large helpings and kept telling me how delicious it was. I didn't have the following ingredients and had to sup or do with out. I used onion flakes instead of onion. Used egg beaters instead of eggs. Didn't use ginger and used just the regular bread crumbs and turned out just wanderful. Definitely a make again.

This recipe is so easy and so good!  It is my new favorite not to mention easy meatloaf recipe...the only change I make when cooking it is I used seasoned bread crumbs instead of crushed saltines and I add a fresh clove of pressed garlic...other than that - it's perfect!

This was a complete surprise. I never would have thought of putting brown sugar in meatloaf.  The sweetness from the brown sugar goes through the whole meatloaf and this will be my favorite recipe.

Doubled the recipe and made two loaves for a gathering of 12 people.  It was a big success.  Only a couple of small pieces were left at the end of the evening, and several asked for the recipe!

This is a family favorite, I follow recipe as described, however I also mix some extra brown sugar and ketchup together and lightly coat the upper portion of the loaf, it makes a nice glaze and really adds to the flavor. If you haven't tried this one you are really missing out on a great meal.

This is really yummy...way better than regular meatloaf! I have made it three times now! Some alterations...I make mine by mixing the brown sugar and ketchup right into the meat, using oats instead of crackers, and bake it in my cast iron fry pan. So quick and easy to throw togther...it cooks itself while I write my term papers!

OMG super yummy!! My hubby won't eat anything with ketchup though-so I just mixed it all into the meatloaf. ;) I always cook mine on a cookie sheet at a higher temp so that the outside gets a little crisp. I wasn't sure about the ginger but I'm glad that I left it in. Oh, and out of habit I added Worcestershire sauce before I realized that it didn't call for it. Oops. But very very good!

Absolutely fantastic!  I made this for the first time for guests, and there were rave reviews, and just enough left for me for a meatloaf sandwich for lunch.  I, too, put the glaze on top, and I used 1 egg, Italian bread crumbs, 1/2 c milk.  I think I could have uses a few more bread crumbs, but overall, a very good recipe.  It will be made again.

Very tasty and juicy meatloaf, however just a little too sweet for my liking.  I'd make it again, but next time a whole lot less sugar and I'd put the ketchup on top too.

I followed the directions and the only exception was using Honey Cornbread instead of breadcrumbs.  I had made the cornbread from another recipe on here and it was the only thing that has not turned out properly.  So, I sliced it thin and toasted it in the oven.   The meatloaf is amazingly moist - and I'm not a meatloaf fan but my boyfriend is which is why I made it - and I must say, for once in my life I liked a meatloaf.

Also, I did follow other suggestions I saw on this recipe and mixed the brown sugar & ketchup together into a glaze and put it on top of the loaf rather than at the bottom of the pan.

I asked my husband what he wanted for dinner and he replied "meatloaf".  I made this with a combination ground beef/pork/veal mixture instead of all beef.  Probably only used between 1/4 - 1/2 cup of milk.   Baked in larger pyrex dish instead of loaf pan.  Let sit 20 mins to settle so that I wasn't slicing a loaf of mush.   He liked it.

This is a pretty good meatloaf recipe. I decreased to 1 egg, 1/2 cup milk and 1/4 cup brown sugar. I added some finely chopped celery and a splash of Bragg's Liquid Aminos plus some garlic powder and onion powder. I really think this is on the verge of being too sweet, so be careful with the brown sugar!

I have made this meatloaf dozens of times.  Every time I ask my 14 yr old son what we should have for Sunday dinner, he says meatloaf.  I have made other variations of meatloaf, but none that my family has requested over and over again.  This is a keeper!! Thanks

Absolutely the best, but per other reviewers, glaze went on top.  My husband is not a fan of meatloaf and went back for additional helpings.  This is a winner.

I made this just as the recipe said and loved it.  The sweetness of the sauce is so good, and I like the little bit of difference the ginger gives this recipe.

Excellent meatloaf.  I mixed a bit of mustard with the ketchup and brown sugar and spread it on top about 1/2 way through.

Hubby loved it! And if he loves it, it is worthy! I did change the sauce to the top instead of the bottom, but other than that, went straight by the recipe. Thanks so much for a change on an old family classic!

Our entire family loved this recipe!!  They all said it was the best meatloaf they had ever eaten.  The only change I made was that I used seasoned bread crumbs rather than the crackers.

A solid recipe with good results. Not the BEST meatloaf I've had...but it's good nonetheless. The first time I made it I put the sauce at the bottom just for kicks, and my husband said, "Why not put it on top next time. It's good - but would be better on top!" He was right. I added the sauce to the top and it was delicious.

The second time around, I did use less milk (about 1/2 cup) and I seasoned it with some of my favorite spices.

I made this recipe last night and loved it!  I omitted the eggs, because I suprisingly didn't have any.  Every meatloaf recipe has eggs in it, and the only difference I notice is that the loaf 'held together' a little better.  It didn't seem to fall apart as easily when serving it out of the loaf pan.  I personally liked this factor.  Also, I put the ketchup and brown sugar on the top, instead of the bottom and added it in the last 30 minutes of cooking.  The reason why is because I like to drain any grease from the loaf halfway through cooking and the thought of the grease combining with the ketchup and brown sugar at the bottom kind of grossed me out.

I havent tried this recipe but it is nearly identical to my own meatloaf recipe. I use a little liquid smoke in the sauce(which I put on top not bottom). You can also use oatmeal or bread crumbs in place of the crackers if you dont have any. I only use about 1/4 cup of brown sugar. Otherwise great recipe.

Well I didnt even get to taste this. However I rated it a five because it was truly easy and everyone ate it up.  I took others advice and mixed the brown sugar and ketchup together.  I baked half way through before adding the brown sugar mixture on top.  It was perfect.  Thanks

The best meatloaf ever! I used ground turkey instead- and it still came out so moist.  I also used breadcrumbs instead of saltine crackers, added a couple cloves of garlic.  So yummy. My husband thought the top was a little too sweet, but I loved it. Next time, I'll half the sugar. But the rest was awesome.

I made the meat loaf exactly as the recipe.  It had good texture but not a lot of flavor.  I would had green peppers and worcestershire sauce next time.

My husband always has to put BBQ sauce on his meatloaf........
Surely he is not alone. I fussed at him and said "can't you at least taste it before you hide the flavor?"  He tasted it, I heard yumm coming from the kitchen and saw no BBQ sauce on his plate. It tuned out great! It is a new favorite!!

The brown sugar topping was TOO much. The meat loaf itself was delisous but as for me and my family the sweet brown sugar topping was to sweet. I even cut down the sugar to 1/4c.

I give this one a 4.5.  My husband has never really had meatloaf before (seriously) and he liked it a lot.  He even had sandwiches out of it the next day which he thought were great. My two year old and I also loved it.  Hubby requested it again this week. I too put the brown sugar ketchup with a dash of worschester on the top, not the bottom.

I have always had trouble with my meatloaf to stick together.  This does it just wonderfully.  And the brownsugar and ketchup mix well during the cooking.  When I took it out, I was wondering what to do with the liquid at the bottom of the pan.  Well, scoop it out and drizzle it on the meat.  It makes for the best glaze.  My husband said it was better than his mom's.  That's got to be the best compliment a person could get.  Thanks.

This was absolutely delish! I put a little of the sauce on the bottom of the pan and the rest on top. I also mixed it up the day before and just got it out and popped into the oven the next day after work. Thanks for the great recipe.

Great!!  I also used a little less milk (about 1/2 cup), put the brown sugar/ketchup on top and added a few splashes of Worcheshire sauce.  EXCELLENT!  Next time I'd like to try mixing the ketchup and brown suger before putting on top...otherwise it was wonderful!

On the whole a very good meatloaf recipe! Meat is perhaps a little to sugary for my tastes. Addittionaly I would parrot some of the other reviewers and be sure to put glaze on the top. Drippings mingling with the brown sugar was not that pretty of a sight.

My family loved this. I made one adjustment mixing half ground beef and half ground turkey, but I didn't change anything else. My husband said he could eat meatloaf every week if it was this one! Thanks for a delicious and easy recipe.

This meatloaf didn't have a different taste to me from any other loaf that I've done before. However, I didn't use ginger and maybe that made a big difference. I followed a suggestion to place slices of bread under the loaf to soak up the grease and that definitely worked. I followed the recipe as written except that I put the brown sugar and ketchup on top of the loaf. I spread the brown sugar and then put the ketchup on top of that. The only difference is that the ketchup and very top of the loaf was sweeter due to the brown sugar. This was a good loaf and it was very moist. My family thoroughly enjoyed this meal.

Really easy and great tasting! I made this with the ketchup/brown sugar glaze on top and Lipton's Onion Soup mix instead of the onion. And the portions also cut nicely into perfect size slices for sandwiches later.

I made this for my husband and me, and we loved it. I think it is one of my favorite dinners.  I did use onion soup instead of chopped onion, flavored bread crumbs instead of crackers, and 1/4 cup of milk.  It made a great dinner. Thank you.

I am writing this review while the meatloaf bakes.  I wish I had read the reviews before I put it in the pan.  The brown sugar smells like it is burning,  Hopefully it won't taste like burn't brown sugar. :(  I put one star because I'm afraid I will be disappointed.

This was pretty good. The brown sugar made the one side taste like a dessert, but then the inside was bland in comparison. I don't think I'll be making this again, but it was good for what it was.

Delicious.  I used bread crumbs intstead of crackers and egg substitute.  I also used barbecue sauce instead of ketchup and mixed it with the brown sugar and added a little lemon juice.  That made it so good and tangy.  Yummy!

Fantastic Flavours, i used many of the readers tips, i,e glazing the top of the loaf also because the bottom does produce alot of juice. I also added a layer of chopped boiled eggs to finish it off.

Excellent recipe very similar to my personal recipe.  The only difference, is that I used rolled oats instead of crushed crackers for a heartier alternative.  I put the ketchup/brown sugar as the topping and have been for over 20 years.

The meat was good but the sauce is way too sweet for us.  Would cut back to half of the brown sugar.

We really liked this recipe. Just eyeballed the ingredients and it tasted great. Used breadcrumbs b/c I didnt have saltines. Thanks for the recipe.

I was never a fan of my mom's meatloaf but had a sudden craving so decided to try my hand at making meatloaf myself.  This was super!  I did many of the suggested modifications including using bread crumbs, ground turkey instead of beef, and french onion soup mix.  I also made mini meatloaves in a muffin tin for easy portability for brown bag lunches.

I made the recipe as directed with the following exceptions: (1) I made it in a casserole dish, with the meat on top of a piece of bread to soak up the grease.  (2) I spread the brown sugar and Ketchup on top. **as per other reviews
The meatloaf took longer to cook than directed, and the flavour was a little bland.  Next time I will use onion soup mix instead of just onion, and add more salt.
It wasn't that bad...it's just not really that hard to make meatloaf better.

Good recipe- slightly sweet taste.  I changed the recipe to serve 4 and cut the cook time to 45 minutes and it came out perfect.

I also found that using a whole medium onion increased the flavor instead of using a small onion.

I used this recipe to make mini meatloaves and they turned out perfectly.  I hate overly moist meatloaf, so I changed out the cracker crumbs with Italian bread crumbs (which also added some extra flavor) and then crushed up 10 saltine crackers.  I spooned the sauce over the top of each mini loaf instead of putting it in the bottom of the pan.  The meat was perfectly moist... not too dry and not mushy.  Everyone loved them!

Pretty good. I liked the flavor of the meat but next time i think i'll add cayenne to the sauce so it has a kick.

a hit at my house, even with my finicky 7 year old who took one first taste nibble and declared 'mmmmmmmm! yum!'. i've made it both with the crackers and with substituting bread crumbs.  like it both ways.  i prefer with the sauce on top.  this one's in the top 5 rotation.

I took the advice of some of the other reviews and put the sauce on top of the loaf instead of putting it on the bottom of the pan, and it was a little bit too sweet for me. My fiancee and his brother loved it though, so that's always a good thing for me! I will be making this again.

This was good, though sweet as others have stated. Also, I have one kid who doesn't like ketchup at all. I thought it would be disguised well enough when it all cooked together because of all the other ingredients, into an unrecognizable glaze, but NO! While it was cooking, he kept saying, "The whole house smells like ketchup, I'm going to gag!" A bad sign before it even made it to the table. Still, the rest of us liked it well enough and even the anti-ketchup kid ate everything that wasn't touched by the offending sauce!

I followed this recipe exactly as written--sauce on the bottom, ginger(I did only use 1/2 cup milk, though and had to sub cheez-its for the saltines)...and my family and I quite enjoyed it.  It is true if you put the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom it doesn't really flavor or "stick" to the meatloaf, but that was the genius part of it to me.  Those who wanted it could spoon extra on their portions, those who didn't, well, problem solved.  Yes, it was a very sweet sauce, but I liked it, it was a nice change to what I'm used to.  I also liked the texture.  It was a nice firm meatloaf--I hate soft, mushy loaves.  My only critique may be that it could use a little extra flavor, maybe a squirt of ketchup and mustard and more pepper in the meat mixture, but all in all, a good recipe.

This is just an okay meatloaf. I admit I haven't tried many, but this was just bland. McCormick sells a seasoning packet with recipe on back that is a far more savory meatloaf. I will be sticking to that recipe.

Delicious!  As others suggested, I added a dash of Worchestershire sauce and put the ketchup/brown sugar layer on top of the meatloaf.  I reduced the amount of brown sugar as others recommended.  I sprinkled just a small palmful of brown sugar on top of the ketchup & the sweetness turned out just right!  I also added finely grated carrots to the meatloaf so we could get more veggies in our diet.  Turned out wonderful!

When I saw how many reviews this recipe had received I had to try it.  No wonder.  It was delicious.  The brown sugar and ketchup makes a wonderful barbecue sauce.  One reviewer commented the sauce should be on top, so I prepared as directed and then just flipped the meatloaf upside down when serving.  Great recipe!

Absolutely fantastic. I used 1/4c. milk and 1/4c. brown sugar. It was still very sweet. I took the advice of another reviewer and put the brown sugar and ketchup mixture on top of the meatloaf. I added about 1/4tsp of garlic and left out the onion. Will make many more times.

This was the best meatloaf I have ever made and eaten.  The only thing I did differently was use ground turkey, candied ginger chunks and shredded carrots.  I then paired it with purple mashed potatoes.  Yummy.

This was a really good meatloaf recipe. I didn't use the brown sugar part b/c my wacko husband doesn't like it. But it was still great! I will definitely make it again.

Very moist!  It was also very quick and easy to prepare.  What I liked best was that it used ingredients I normally keep on hand.

This is an excellent recipe, I am not a meatloaf fan but this recipe changed that.  I also put brown sugar and ketchup on top of the meatloaf as well.  This is now a family favorite recipe!!

I hate meatloaf, but this is delicious!  My husband doesn't really like the sweetness, so I use a little less brown sugar and chili sauce instead of ketchup.  I also top it with chili sauce and add a little worcestershire sauce to the meat.

Wow!  Absolutely the best and most moist meatloaf I have ever had.  I substituted the bread crumbs for oatmeal since it was all I had on hand and it was still FABULOUS!  I also squirted about a tbs of ketchup into the mix with a sprinkle of brown sugar.  Yum!

Overall this is a great recipe. Next time that I make it I will change a few things though. I usually make a Mexican meatloaf ( of my creation ) & am use to a more savory flavor. I cut the brown sugar to 1/2c and it was still too sweet for me, although my husband loved it. It also ended up being a huge amount of onion although I used a small onion, next time I will only add 1/2 a small onion. I ended up cooking it in a ring pan and cutting it into small slices. It makes a nice presentation. I also served it with the Home Fried Potato recipe on site and it was a wonderful combination.

I love looking for "spins" on traditional recipes. This was a good one! My personal spin on meatloaf is to spread ketchup in the bottom of the loaf dish before baking and pack the mixture on top of it. I did this with the brown sugar/ketchup mixture and it was quite yummy. :D

I eyeballed everything because I didn't have time to measure. I followed others suggestions and added the brown sugar/ketchup on top. I mixed the ketchup with a few T. of Worchestire sauce and a few T. of honey. My husband didn't like it (he doesn't like sweet dishes), but I did so I compromised and gave it 4 stars.

I cooked it with 99% fat free ground turkey and it still came out great.  I also use Ritz wheat crackers instead.  Very nice recipe.

Great meatloaf! Used breadcrumbs instead of crackers, and put the ketchup mixture on top the last 15 minutes of cooking. Thanks! I loved this even better the next day.

I can't imagine anyone rating this anything but 5*. It is really, really good, and so easy.

I had only 1 pound of beef, so I cut all the ingredients by 1/3 (except for the eggs, I still used two), and it turned out great. I also substituted bread crumbs for the saltines. One last modification was to mix the brown sugar and ketchup together and pour it over the top, like the others.

A definite keeper. It is really, really good. Will become my No. 1 meatloaf recipe.

This meatloaf is wonderful! I use ground turkey instead of beef, and since my husband loves barbecue sauce, I substitute half of the ketchup with bbq sauce. He asks me to make this for dinner almost every other week!

My family LOVED this recipe.  I followed the recipe to a "T" and it was great.  I allowed the meatloaf to set for 20 minutes after cooking and then inverted it on a plate, kind of like a pineapple upside down cake.  The sauce was very good and it made a nice presentation (as far as presentations can go for meatloaf!)
Thanks for sharing this recipe!  It will be a staple in my collection from now on.

I make my own meatloaf all the time so was looking for a change. I usually tweek the recipes on here to my taste but decided to stay true to this one except to put sauce on top. Ive never have had saltines in my meatloaf or put milk. I liked the milk in it but I will Not use saltines again will stick with bread. The sauce I will use that for now on alot better than ketchup:) I do feel like there is a better mealoaf out there but my one friend said he hates mealoaf and liked this sooo thats why I give you 4 stars and for the sauce. thx..Also I usually use salsa in my meatloaf and wet taco sauce for the top...lol sounds weird but its pretty good.

It's like dinner and dessert all in one! The glaze is delicious!!! I do use Splenda brown sugar blend and low-carb ketchup to keep the sugar content down.

I really love this recipe! I was never a meatloaf kind of gal but I was pregnant and got a taste for it so I tried this recipe and it was fabilous!..My husband loves it and always asks when I'm going to make it again. Im actually making again after I post this. I followed what everyone else said and used worcestshire mixed in with the ketchup, used bread crumbs instead of crackers, and put the ketchup and brown sugar on top. I know that the recipe sounds weird to have it on bottom and Im thinking the reasoning behind that is so that you can just flip the meatloaf upside down onto a plate and all the toppings be on top. Anyways Im going to try the bread on bottom this time because last time it was greasy on bottom of pan. I dont know if that is good or not because that was my first time making it. But anyways the recipe was kick butt, I love it and hope everyone would give it a chance. You wont regret it. Look at how many people have made it (over 2555 at the time im writing this) and it has a rating of 4.5 stars!?! cant be that bad right? Enjoy!

This is the best meatloaf that I have ever made or had.  I don't use as much ketchup and I add a little more brown sugar.  I also sprinkle a little brown sugar on the top before putting it in the oven to bake it.

Made this twice, first time as written.  Didn't like the texture of the crumbs (that's a personal family texture issue for us), so we used whole wheat bread crumbs the second time around (or 3 slices).  Also decreased milk by a couple of tbsp and used onion soup mix in place of the onion & salt.  Put sauce on top and decreased sugar by half - it was too sweet for us.

This was a good meatloaf. I just don't understand why one would want to put the topping in the bottom of the pan. Instead, I made a glaze with 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup ketchup and a dash of worcestershire sauce. I added some of the glaze to the meat mixture and put the rest on the top. I sauted and cooled the onion before adding to the meat and I also reduced the milk to 1/4 cup.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. It reminded me of my mom's except for she uses oatmeal instead of crackers. I much preferred the crackers. Next time, I might put the ketchup and brown sugar on top. It was incredibly moist though. Thanks for the great recipe.

I have been making meatloaf for many years, but this is our all time favorite recipe. I put the brown sugar mixture on the top instead of the bottom, but no changes other than that.

I have one cooking in the oven right now and it smells delicious! Thanks for a great recipe.

Ok, I admit I wasn't paying attention to the recipe.  I had 6 kids running around screaming, and my SIL trying to talk to me about SERIOUS FAMILY DRAMA (duh duh duh).  So instead of putting the brown sugar and ketchup down in the pan, I accidentally mixed it all together.  The result was a very wet mix, so rather than putting it in a loaf pan, I put it in a loaf shape on a cookie sheet.  It was thinner than a loaf, so I cooked it about 40 minutes, topped it with ketchup for an additional 10, and then served.  It was a HUGE hit, even though I was worried I ruined it by putting the brown sugar in the mix.  My husband has requested that I only ever make it this way!  (oops!)

I make this recipe regularly.  I also sprinkle a little brown suger on the top as well as some ketchup.  I also used soy milk and egg replacer (instead of milk and eggs), still perfect!  Very Good!

Like others, I used about 2/3 the milk and added just a dab of butter. I served it with potatoes and string beans and rice. Brilliant recipe.

A definate croud pleaser.  I made this meatloaf for a Sunday night dinner with 16 people who never like the same food.  Two of them hate meatloaf.  Everyone loved this dish.  My grandmother who has never asked me for a recipe asked for this one.  It was not dry, and the flavor was wonderful.

I made this for my boyfriend last night and he couldnt get enough! It was absolutley fantastic. I did take the advice of others and decided to use bread crumbs and the onion soup mix insead of the crackers and chopped up onion. I also put the ketchup and brown sugar on top of the meat instead of on the bottom. This recipe is a keeper!!!

This is very popular at my house. Sometimes I put brown rice in it instead of saltines because it's healthier, but this dish is delicious either way.

This is really good! I followed another reviewer's suggestion and put the sugar and ketchup on top because I like my ketchup baked. I also used dried bread crumbs as I didn't have any crackers. My kids who hate meatloaf even asked for seconds!  :)

The meatloaf itself is a wonderful recipe to start with.  We like it very much and I will always use it as a starter.  But the brown sugar mixture is bad.  I followed the idea of some of the other reviewers and put the sugar on top but brown sugar just does not belong on a meatloaf!  My whole family agreed that it is much tastier without the sugar.

This was AMAZING!! I didn't make any changes to the recipe, and I don't think I will be either, this was an amazing dish as is!!! The only thing I MAY change next time is to put a little ketchup on top as well as on the bottom as it all soaked up into the meat, otherwise this was the BEST meatloaf I've EVER had!

I love this receipe.  It is so easy but oh so yummy!  My husband who would not eat meatloaf for years loves this too!  I added the brown sugar and ketchup to the top and bottom of the meatloaf.  I also added some more spices.

This turned out fantastic! The changes I made were 1/4 cup milk, 1/2 of a small onion, Progresso's Garlic and Herb Bread Crumbs --then you don't have to worry about adding garlic. The sauce came out a bit runny, but I was more concerned about that for looks only. I personally liked the contrast between the meat and the sauce and kept the original glaze recipe (on the bottom too). Fabulous meatloaf and EASY!!

We really really loved this!  Some reviews said the sauce was too sweet, but it was the best part!  I would put even more on next time!  I used less milk, added fresh parsley, and used part saltines, part bread crumbs.  I just wish  I had made more-it was a hit! (And I usually hate meatloaf!)

This meatloaf was good, but not my favorite. I added garlic, worcestershire to both the meat and the glaze, and reduced the amount of sugar, but it was still a little too sweet for me.

This was the first meatloaf I've made... it came out pretty good. I think next time I will cut down the milk... there's a lot of moisture when the chopped onions cook out... so 3/4 cup of milk was a tad too much. 

Also, I will reduce the brown sugar next time. It was too sweet and this is coming from someone who loves anything sweet - and who pours sugar into everything (tea, coffee, etc). So for me to say it was a little too sweet... it really was. But, it's a great starter recipe - you can build off this.

Just made meatloaf for the first time with this recipe.  I did modify it using other suggestions.  1/2 cup of milk (might reduce even more next time), half a large onion (will reduce this amount as well in the future), bread crumbs instead of saltines, 1/3 cup each ketchup and brown sugar and added a few tsp of Worcestershire sauce to the glaze.  I also put the glaze on top.  Only giving this 3 stars because of all the modifications that I made.  It tasted great though!

This is a superb recipe and I will definitely make it again. I would use a less onion next time however.

This recipe was an absolute hit with my family! I will definitely make this again. Like some of the other postings the only thing I did different was to put the brown sugar and ketchup on the top. GREAT RECIPE!

I give this 4 stars, because at first, it was REALLY good....but it's one of those things where about half way through, it's starts to not taste good.  I couldn't really peg what it was, but my family completely agreed.  Only change was that I used less sugar.  The amount the recipe called for is way too much.

This is the best meatloaf I have ever had.  My husband and kids agree.  The day after we tried this recipe, I told my mom about it.  She looked it up on the internet and made it the same day.  She has made it twice over a 2 week period.  The second time was at my dad's request!  Great recipe!  Thank you so much!

This recipe wasn't bad but not great. Very easy to make but was just a basic meatloaf recipe. Like others suggested, I did put the brown sugar glaze on the top in the last 15 minutes and reduced the amount milk. With the reviews I think that I expected more.

This is the best meatloaf I've ever made or had. I substituted salt for garlic salt, put only 1/4 c. of milk, and put the brown sugar and ketchup on top. was perfect, sweet, and juicy. will be a staple in my house from now on.

So easy and sooo tasty!  Only used 1 egg (that's all I had in the fridge), onion soup mix instead of onion, decreased salt to 1/2 tsp since the mix already has salt, used 1/3 cup of milk, and to the sauce I added 2 tsp of worschechire sauce and spread the sauce on top.  Will become a staple in our household!

Fantastic!  I took other reviewers suggestions and (1) substituted one package of dry onion soup mix for the chopped onion, (2) reduced brown sugar to 1/4 c., (3) reduced the milk to 1/4 c., (4) spread the brown sugar and ketchup mixture on top and baked in a 9 x 13 casserole dish.

Wonderful!

I have made many meatloaf recipes but this one was the best.  I made it for my husband's birthday dinner because he LOVES meatloaf and others have just not held together well.  This one was perfect.  I also put the ketchup/brown sugar on top and  added some Worcestershire sauce.  Thanks.

This was pretty good. I followed everyones suggestions ( glaze on top, add worchestshire, onion soup mix, and decreased the milk). I didn't care for the onion soup mix. Maybe I should have only used 1/2 a packet. I thought it had too many onions. The glaze was good though. My husband really liked it. Neither of my kids did but they don't normally like meatloaf anyways. I'll probably make this one again just with less onion.

Great recipe! This was only the second time I have ever made meatloaf and it turned out very well. My boyfriend came home in a foul mood the night I made this and it seriously cheered him right up. It was gone the next day. He made meatloaf sandwiches and took them to work for his lunch!

The meatloaf itself was really good, but I thought the sauce was a pretty basic meatloaf sauce.  It was still tasty, but I added a couple dashes of worshire sauce to the the sauce.  I also cooked it with the sauce poured over top, rather than on the bottom of the pan because I'm a poor university student and don't actually own a loaf pan!

Very yummy! I followed advise from some of the readers and did the onion soup mix instead of the chopped onion, and I found that it was a little too salty, so the next time I did the chopped onion, but did cut back on the milk a little. I agree that the brown sugar and ketchup should be on the top. I make this a lot now!

I loved it and I hate meatloaf!  My kids loved it!  My husband not so much, but he doesn't like anything that isn't a cookie.  I made it with the brown sugar on top and used teriyaki bar-b-que sauce instead of ketchup.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  Terrific!

I took reviewers tips, but cutting down the milk and cut the brown sugar in half, also mixed the ketchup and brown sugar and put glaze over the top. It was still TOO SWEET. I did like the taste and consistency of the meatloaf. Will make again but will only put a TBL of brown sugar.

It needed more time and when it came out of the oven the brown sugar glaze was extremely runny.  The flavor was really good, and the glaze got thicker the more time it sat.

I followed recipe exactly.  I have been looking for a meatloaf recipe I could TRUST--where not all of the reviewers made a lot of changes.  This one is it.  The ginger threw me off at first, but I added it anyway and it tasted great.  My husband agreed that it was the best one I've made.  And I've made alot!  Thanks!

Perfect!  My husband loves meatloaf and I've tried many, many recipes over the years -- this one is his favorite.  Based on reviews (and experience) I put the ketchup/brown sugar on top.  I also used dehydrated onions instead of fresh (something I prefer in my meatloaf.)  I also doubled the recipe and it was great.  Sadly, even with doubling the recipe there were hardly any leftovers!

Followed recipe pretty much exact except i took the advice of most people and cut back to 1/4 cup milk and added garlic and put brown sugar/ketchup sauce on top. The consistency and taste was just not for me. I like very few Meatloaf recipes and i had high hopes for this one. Unfortunately this was very disappointing and I wont be making it again.

I have never used a recipe for meatloaf, but decided to do something different the other night. My meatloaf is always a bit crumbly, but this recipe produced a nice dense loaf that cut wonderfully without crumbling! I did think it could have been a bit more flavorful, though. I usually have worchestshire sauce and ketchup in mine. I thought the ketchup/brown sugar glaze was just a bit too sweet for my taste, but my husband loved it. 

Sooo...overall this was a great recipe. I will be tweaking it a bit the next time. Using the base so that my meatloaf stays together better, but, adding a bit more flavor!

This is the BEST meatloaf ever. I am not a meatloaf fan but this one is so easy to make & taste fantastic. I don't use alot of onion, just some cut in really small pieces. Otherwise I follow the exact recipe. Wonderful! We make it weekly.

This meatloaf was super tasty - my husband loved it!  I thought it was too moist and will probably take the advice of other reviewers next time, using less milk and putting the glaze of sugar and ketchup on top.  Also, mine didn't cook all the way through in an hour; it needed at least 10 more minutes.  However, it's definitely a keeper, and I appreciate the yummy addition to our dinner repertoire!

I too cut this down to 1/2 cup milk (on serving for 8).  I also added 1 Tbl worcheshire with the ketchup and brown sugar.  It was "wet" when I tried to form into a loaf but when it cooked it firmed up and was DELICIOUS!  Awesome meatloaf!

This is a husband favorite. What more do I need to say. It's super easy and goes great with green beans and garlic mashed potatoes. Good for busy days when you want to look like you actually made dinner!

We found this to be just OK.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was too moist.  If I make it again I'll use a little less milk.  The taste was good - it was more the texture I didn't like.

This is one of our favorite meals to make, expect I use the brown sugar and ketchup as a topping and substitute bread crumbs for crackers.

I do not like such a sweet glaze and I normaly put tomato sauce, onion and green pepper in my meat loaf.
It was different having the glaze on bottom, that is probably to keep the brown sugar from melting and running off. It was a nice meatloaf, I made it exactly as directed.  I just do not like the sweet taste.

I doubled the recipe, except the brown sugar, just used 1/2.  Also, used 1/2 of the milk.  Used dry onion soup mix, instead of onions.   I used bread instead of crackers.  I added about 4 splashes of Worcestershire Sauce to the mix.  Put 4 more splashes on top of the meatloaf, topping that with brown sugar and ketchup.  Turned out great.  Hubby even ate 1/2 of the loaf, before we all went to bed, and my picky son, liked it.  Hubby told me to keep this recipe.  Thank you, for sharing.

I haven't made meatloaf in forever and this is probably the best I've ever had.  The 2nd time I made it I used the crock pot using the same recipe and it was still awesome.  Just mixed ingredients and put in crock pot on low for 5 hours.  Very good!

This is good comfort food. Besides the slight sweetness, it tasted like a basic meatloaf to me. I wasn't sure about putting the ketchup and brown sugar on the bottom, so I used it as a topping. I only had a pound of ground beef so I adjusted the other ingredients accordingly, including the topping. I added a teaspoon of worcestershire sauce to the topping and a teaspoon to the loaf itself for a little more flavor. Instead of an onion, I used onion soup mix. I didn't have ginger, so I left that out.

this was pretty good. definitely a recipe id use again in a pinch.  i did think the sauce was a little sweet though. i was hoping for a recipe where the loaf itself is good and the sauce is an accent.

This was good.  I listened to reviewers and  added Worcestershire sauce to meat and sauce, I put the ketchup and sugar sauce on top of the meatloaf too and I used bread crumbs.  I also sauteed the onions with some garlic.  This was good - but maybe too sweet?  My husband thought it needed some mustard to cut the sweetness - but he loved it and ate most of it - so there you go!  Depends on your taste.  Definitely not the best meatloaf - but it was easy and definitely better than a generic meatloaf.

This is an excellent meatloaf recipe!  I also put the ketchup mixture on the top of the meatloaf, as others recommended.  In addition, following others' advice, I added a little worcestershire to both the red sauce and the meat mixture, and cut down the amount of milk.  The best meatloaf I've made, hands down!

This was the best meatloaf I've ever eaten.  Even my husband, a meatloaf hater, ate it and liked it.  My kids wouldn't eat it, but then, they hardly eat meat at all.  The only changes I made were using half saltines, half Ritz crackers, because it's what I had. And adding a couple teaspoons of honey dijon mustard to the sauce for the top to give it more of a sweet-sourness.  I also put the sauce on top.  It was perfect and best of all it did not crumble when cut like so many meatloaves do.  This has replaced my old favorite meatloaf recipe.

My husband said this was the best meatloaf he ever tasted (including his mom's)!  I did make some changes.  I changed the servings so that I could use 2 lbs of hamburger.  I added green pepper and fresh onion.  I used bread crumbs instead of crackers.  When I mixed the sauce, I doubled it and added some to the meatloaf mixture then poured the rest on top.  I halved the brown sugar instead of using the full amount.  I also added some hot sauce to the sauce mixture to add a little 'kick' to it.  After baking for a little over an hour, I broiled to give it a charmalized look and taste.  Next time I am going to make more sauce and put it on the top, in the meat mixture, and on the bottom.  After using the recipe off the onion soup mix box for years, I will never go back to that again!

This meatloaf is really quite delicious. Though I did add more seasonings (worsteshire sauce,paprika,soy sauce) and I did use less milk and breadcrumbs instead of crackers. I omitted the ginger  I just didn't think it would work with the ground beef. I think that the brown sugar and ketchup, basically bbq sauce  but a perfectly measured one :) should go on top so it doesn't get lost in all the juices as the meatloaf cooks. I love garlic , so I add a few cloves into the meat. It does caramelize well and you won't get that ugly sticky burnt top if you use enough ketchup. This is the only way I do meatloaf now. You can change it up but the recipe itself is great!   YUMMY!

This was so easy and really tasted wonderful.  I put the sauce on top of the meatloaf and it cooked up beautifully.  Suggestion from hubby, make extra sauce in pan to add onto meatloaf.  Thanks so much who new simple could be the best!

This is my favorite recipe for meatloaf.  I usually prepare as directed and divide in half to make two smaller loafs(perfect for my husband and I), except, I only cook them for 40 minutes rather than an hour as stated. After baking, I use my vacuum sealer to seal the other meatloaf.  Before I leave for work in the morning, I let the loaf thaw in the fridge and then as instructed by the vacuum sealer manufacturer, just re-heat by putting the whole pouch in a pot of water (do not boil) for about 20-minutes until heated throughout and you have a moist, delicious, home-cooked dinner on a busy work night!!

Made this again last night!!  all other meat loaf recipes tastes like meat with katchup! this is full of flavor!! I need a lot of flavor and salt so i added some garlic salt to it and it was great!! my 1 and 3 year olds loved it!! and they dont like anything except mac and cheese! I had a little too much meat though so it had to bake longer than 1 hour!!  My husband, it takes a lot of food to fill hime up and with this he was completely stuffed!!  I was too and couldnt move for a while and i only had one peice!!!  definatly goes a long way!!

Great recipe.  My family turned up their noses when they saw meatloaf on the table, but they all loved it.  The sweetness of the brown sugar sauce is great.  Leftovers are even better.

My husband made this for dinner one night and it was delish!!  I know he has tweeked it here and there which is why I gave it a 4.  I don't think he ever made the recipe as written but used it as a starting point.  It is fabulous and it is the one meat that I know my girls will eat for dinner.  Thanks!

I took  the advice of the other reviews and put the brown sugar and ketchup on top. It was a little sweet so I would cut back on the amount of brown sugar, but it was still excellent! Next time I am going to try Ritz crackers instead.

Delicious!!  I didn't have quite enough ketchup but it didn't matter. I added some worcestershire sauce in the brown sugar/ketchup mix and also put it on top of the meat instead of the bottom of the pan.  It was so moist and had a wonderful flavor.

I thought this was good.  I did as the others suggested and put the brown sugar and ketchup on top.  Meatloaf isn't my favorite meal, but this was a good recipe.

If I could I would give this recipe 4.5 stars, the only downside to this was all the grease at the bottom of the pan.  I've never made a meatloaf before so maybe that is normal?  But I didn't enjoy it.  I put the brown sugar and ketchup on top as well - which I think was the better way since there is so much oil and grease on the bottom.  It was a very tasty dish though, I'd make it again, I just need to figure out how to remove the oily parts.

Not horrible but my favorite by a long shot.  For one, other than the ginger, it doesn't have a lot of seasoning.  Also, the ketchup/brown sugar mix is just too sweet by itself.  I prefer to mix in some dry mustard for a bit of tang.  Also, as noted previously, putting the sugar and ketchup on the bottom has an ick factor for me.  What happened was it turns into watery, fat laden goo at the bottom.  Not that appetizing for me.  I prefer it on the top and will keep doing that from now one.  The loaf had a wierd texture that I can only attribute to the sauce on the bottom combined with it essentially boiled the meat.  Leftovers were not that appetizing.  I like to have leftover meatloaf sandwiches and this didn't fit the bill.

This is an amazing meatloaf!  We make it with flax seed, Panko and soy milk due to DD's allergies.  It is a family favorite.  
We also make one for church each month and get rave reviews!

The meatloaf turned out awesome! The last 10min. of cooking time I drained out the grease. After that i chopped up some onions added it to the brown sugar & ketchup. I put the Ketchup & Br. Sugar on tope like others suggested. Than I cooked up some bacon to where it was close to being done but not crispy (I dont like crispy bacon) and added it to the top of the meatloaf the last 2min. of cooking time. I give this recipes 5 stars

I made this for my boyfriend as my first attempt at being domestic for him.  You really can't mess it up -  and it smells so good and reheats nicely.  I did reduce the amount of milk added a couple more saltines.  I paired it with cooked carrots, with an orange juice and brown sugar glaze that complimented the meatloaf's flavor.

I enjoyed this a lot for the flavor. Meatloaf is meatloaf and doesn't generally have much variety, but some are definitely more enjoyable than others, and this recipe is top notch if you are into meatloaf. Thanks!

This is FABulous meatloaf.  The best I've ever made!  I reduced the milk to 1/2 cup, and reduced the brown sugar to 1/4 cup, plus I added garlic to the meat, and worsteshire to the meat and to the sauce.  SO good.  My husband was all about it.  =)

If I could rate higher than 5 stars, I would! This meatloaf was absolutely delicious. I added a ‘meatloaf seasoning’ mix from the grocery store, but I’m sure that it would still be amazing without it. I also slightly reduced the quantity of milk that the recipe called for. Moreover I added a tiny bit of cinnamon (to bring out the flavours). Before putting in the oven, I spread the glaze on top of the meatloaf, as suggested by other users. It was mouthgasmic! I have to resist the urge to make this meatloaf everyday – it wouldn’t do much for my waistline.

Yummy, but like another reviewer, I used an envelope of dried onion soup mix, omitting the crackers completely, as well as the salt. I added about a cup of chopped green pepper and one tsp garlic powder.Like another reviewer, I also added a good splash of Worcestershire sauce to the glaze. I reduced the milk to 1/2 cup. The soup mix adds plenty of salt to carry the whole recipe. This one is a keeper! Thanks so much!

My husband and my [very-picky] 2 year old loved this!  I followed some of the other reviews and used less milk, less brown sugar, and added worstechire and minced garlic.  Next time I will reduce the onions because my family isn't a big fan of onions.  Definitely a keeper!

my family really loves this recipe. i do modify it a bit by using ground turkey, adding one envelope of onion soup mix instead of the chopped onion, i omit the ginger, i also use about 1/2 cup of milk, and i use 1/3 cup of ketchup and 1/3 cup of brown sugar. i use half of that ketchup and sugar mixture in the meat and use the other half on top of the loaf. this really is a great recipe, thanks for sharing it!

This meatloaf is good, but I'm honestly surprised by the great reviews.  It's really sweet, a bit too much for us - and I generally like things sweet.  I've made it twice, just to make sure I didn't do something wrong the first time, and still wasn't overly impressed.  The texture is also a bit too wet for me.  It cooks in it's own grease, then the grease gets mixed in with the brown sugar & ketchup on the bottom, so very greasy. 

I would give it 3.5 stars if I could, but not quite good enough for 4 stars.

I am giving this 5 stars because I made the sauce on top this time. I will make extra sauce to go on the side and for sandwiches next time too.

Wow! My boys beg me to make this meatloaf. I guess it's not the healthy version, but when you want meat loaf this is it! I take this to friends and always get asked to share the recipe.

I was tired of plain old meatloaf, but this recipe I found to be great! I have been on weight watchers, and I have made this twice already because it is filling and not too many points on the WW! It is a great leftover too... Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was a very nice, basic, meatloaf recipe. I didn't change much; just did the brownsugar/ketchup on top instead of on the bottom and added a small, green bell pepper for flavor. Turned out great. Will keep this as my abse recipe.

This was good. Next time I will leave out the salt, I think the saltines added enough. I added 1/2 cup of milk after reading others suggestions. I also added the glaze to both the top and bottom and this worked well.

This disapeared faster than I could put leftovers away. Two people all but finished it in one sitting. I had slightly less than 1 and a half pounds of beef. I also didn't have enough brown sugar, so I scaled those down to the same amount. Next time, I would add some fresh chopped garlic to the mixture.

Placing the sugar and ketchup on top was a great idea. I was concerned about the serving (I had selected serving for 4) it didn't fill my loaf pan, but it served 2 adults and 1 child well.  Next time I'll choose 6 to serve 4 people.  I didn't have the onion, and it was not missed in the recipe.  Next time we thought some minced garlic would be nice.  My husband is extremely picky, to the point of my frustration and he as well as my kids really liked this recipe.

I followed the recipe as written, but simply found it to be too bland and way too greasy and moist for my taste. I can see why some people who don't like meatloaf like this recipe because it does taste pretty good, simply not what I expect from meatloaf.

I give it a 10! I put the sause in the middle and on the top. I could have put it on the bottom instead of the middle and that would have worked. One thing is for sure the sause was a hit with my husband and I need to have extra made for leftovers. I made the sause just like it called for and it was great!

This recipe is GREAT!!  We've made it a bunch of times and it just gets better and better - it's great as left-overs too!!  We use lean ground turkey instead of beef, cut the sugar in half, reduced the milk by 1/4 cup, and added some Worcestershire in the turkey loaf and the sauce.  We will continue to make this recipe.

I made this for dinner last night, both my Husband and I loved it. I didn't have some ingredients on hand, so I had to improvise. Instead of the onion (which I didn't have) I put in chopped garlic. I didn't have any saltine's, so I mixed in some Italian seasoned bread crumbs. I didn't have any ginger either, so I put in a small amount of cinnamon. 

I would make this again for sure!

Very good, just what I was looking for in a       meatloaf recipe.  I used 2 lb of meat and 1 full sleeve of saltines and left out the ginger.  I also added the brown sugar/ketchup to the top as per previous reviewer suggestions.  It was perfect served with some homemade mashed potatoes!

Based on other reviews I added the brown sugar and ketchup to the top not the bottom of this recipe. I also added a package of dried onion soup. The flavor on this was great and it was very moist.

Changes: used 1/4 c. brown sugar. Half cup was too sweet, although we still gobbled it up with no problem. I also used 1/2 cup milk instead of 3/4 cup. I added some Cracked Peppercorn A-1 sauce for fun as well. 
Even with my slight changes I still give this recipe five stars because it was really amazing and we really enjoyed how moist and delicious it turned out. This really is the best recipe I have used so far and I will be making this many times.

This recipe is delicious, however I would definately cut the milk by half, otherwise a lot of the flavor is lost.

I've been tempted to make this recipe for a long time, but the brown sugar scared me!  I was afraid of the sweetness.  Finally, I decided to give it a try and it has become our new favorite meatloaf.  It really is very good and the sauce (I put it on top during cooking)isn't overpowering like I expected.  Very Good!

We made a few "blow-out edition" alterations to this brown sugar meatloaf by substituting french-fried onions and breadcrumbs in place of onion and crackers and then in the last 10 minutes of baking spread a layer of mashed potatoes on top and another layer of shredded cheddar cheese.  Balanced out with a green salad with balsamic vinagrette, we are heartily satisfied!

This is by far the best meatloaf I have made.  I've made it with and without the ginger and it turns out deliscious either way!!  My whole family loves it.  I will continue making this for years to come.  Thanks for sharing!!!

I make a meatloaf close to this one and it has always been a very big hit. I mix ketchup,mustard & brown sugar to cover the top while it is cooking. I always try new things with my meatloaf but every one in my house agrees that my topping can never change.

This was a big hit at my house everyone loved it.  I have made many different kinds of meatloaf but this is by far my favorite I will make this kind from now on.  I did add garlic and worcestershire sauce like one other review said, and it was oh so good.

First, I have to say, my husband does not like meatloaf. I love it and I wanted to give this a try to see if he would like it.
He loved it! He had seconds and even said, This is pretty good. I found a meatloaf that my picky husband will eat and I love it too! My 3 year old ate it also.
I think just to mix it up next time, I might add some cheese to the meatloaf. 

A Keeper For Sure!

I've tried several meatloaf recipes, and this one was by far the best! I made 5 mini-loaves, and they were just as good as leftovers as originally. Will easily feed a family of 5.

Ok, I hate meatloaf, but this is great. I think next time, I'm only using a teaspoon of salt, maybe a little more ginger, and I'm thinking of combining a little brown sugar with the meat mixture.
Goes great with peas and french bread. Thanks for the recipe!

Too sweet, too wet, too soft, bland & flavorless.  I followed the recipe exactly. Needs more spices, less milk, and less sugar.  We could barely eat it.  I'll keep looking for another recipe.

My husband loved this recipe. I usually make the italian meatloaf recipe from this site but he told me he prefers this one...by far! For me personally it was a bit sweet. I used 1/4 cup brown sugar and only 1/4 cup milk (previous reviewer mentionaed to do this) and a couple splashes of Worcestershire sauce. I placed all the goods on the bottom and had no troubles at all. I also had used a packet of onion soup mix instead of an onion. Next time I will use an onion to see how it differs in taste. Next time I make this I will cut back a little more on the brown sugar. Very good!

I didn't like this as much as everyone else did.  The glaze didn't impact the taste too much.  I also had to bake it for more than 1 hour.  I have a cheese-stuffed meatloaf recipe that I like better! :)

A great, tasty way to change up the "same 'ol, same 'ol" meatloaf.  Only change I made was to add 1/2 of the sugar, not all. Even great with ground turkey~ Thank you so much!

Was looking for a meatloaf recipe similiar to the meatloaf we had at one of the local restaurants.  This one is easy and has a sweet ketchupy taste.  I add other seasonings as we have an addiction to garlic powder to boost flavors.

I loved it!  My family doesn't lke the sweetness, so I only put the brown sugar under half of it, because I made it in a 13x9 glass pan and also combined some of the ingredients from the best meatloaf ever recipe and it was fantastic!

I know this is the classic way to cook meatloaf, but I really disliked it. The topping was too sweet and the insides were too soft. I ended up cutting the top off (the part without sauce) and eating only that - and even that was too sweet. Next time I'm asked to make meatloaf, I'll make a more contemporary one without ketchup

This is the ultimate meatloaf recipe ever.  When I had guest to dinner all 3 families asked for the recipes.  One friend said that she had never seen her kids voluntarily finish meatloaf before.  We do replace the onion with onion soup mix and add more like half a package of crushed saltines.  We also sprinkle a little bit of the ginger powder on top of the loaf after it's in the pan to give it that slight crust.

Excellent comfort food, if you like your meatloaf on the sweet side.  Personally, I like to reduce the brown sugar to 1/4 cup but my hubby likes the 1/2 cup version.  Serve with a side of mashed potatoes and a green veggie and you've got yourself a nice meal.

A really good meatloaf recipe.  I never make the same twice.  My husband said I have made better though.  It was a very easy recipe to make though.  Very uncomplicated

Loved that hint of sweetness to it. Next time I'll saute the onions beforehand- didn't like the crunchy onions. May also substitute half the onion for some bell pepper, and add some worchester sauce.

I always thought my mom's recipe was the best, utnil I found this one as a newlywed seven years ago.  My husband is still asks for it all the time.  I haven't messed with the recipe at all.  It's excellent the way it is!

Absolute Best! This is so easy. Put it together the night before and baked it off for dinner the next night. Very moist and could have been baked longer without a problem. One great recipe!

I'm not a big meatloaf fan but my husband is so I make it to please him every now and then.  I must say, this was the best meatloaf I have ever made.  I've made at least a half dozen recipes and my husband agreed that this was the best.  I don't mind meatloaf so much anymore (although I will never love it) and will make it more often.  Goes great with garlic mashed potatoes.

Outstanding!  loaf stays together.  Brown sugar gives it that little hint of sweetness.  Bake it for about 70 minutes.  Delicious.

I am not a meatloaf eater but my husband loves meatloaf after seeing the many good reviews I decided to give it a try.  My husband said it was fabulous and asked to have more.  I never thought I like meatloaf but I tried it this time and it was good.

The best meatloaf I've ever had, period.  Left out the ginger and put the sauce on the top instead of the bottom. Also added garlic, as I put it in just about everything but cereal.  I will try it next time with the sauce on the bottom like the recipe says as it may be easier to get rid of all the liquid that ends up on the top. Thank you for the recipe!!

I drastically changed this recipe but it was still fantastic.  The topping was the best.  I used Italian Style Bread crumbs instead of saltines.  I used a package of Onion Soup Mix and did not use onion or seasoning.  I have made this twice in 10 days now.

This was wonderful!  I made the following adjustments: only 1/4 brown sugar and 1/2 cup milk, added 1 tbs worcestershire to the ketchup/sugar mix and 1 tbs to the meat loaf, added 2 cloves of garlic to the meat mix and used ground turkey.  I mixed the most of the brown sugar sauce with the meat mix and reserved a little to coat the top of the meatloaf.  Baked it for 1 1/2 hours...it was delicous!

Good recipe! I changed a few things only because we do not eat red meat anymore but my son still loves meatloaf. I used ground turkey, brown sugar substitute and egg whites and it was still an excellent meatloaf! I did follow other reviewers advice and glazed the top instead of placing it on the bottom. Our family will be enjoying this again.

Yum!  This was a nice change from the typical meatloaf recipe I make.  One of the things I liked them most about it was the consistency.  The crackers really blended in with the meat and gave it a nice smooth texture.  The taste was very sweet, and the ginger added a unique twist.  My entire family devoured it!

I loved this meatloaf. The milk makes it so moist, to the point where it's almost falling apart as I'm trying to form it in the loaf pan. I didn't put any ingredients at the bottom of the pan and I instead put the brown sugar, ketchup and some mustard on top of the loaf. I've made this twice already and I will definitely be making it again in the future.

All Loved It!  First time I made meat loaf.  I put the sauce on top in the last 15 min of baking & cut sugar by half.  I used salt free crackers then added Worcestershire sauce and garlic to the meat loaf for pizzazz!  Next time I will add green chili peppers to spice it up.  Will definitely make again!

Very good meatloaf!!!  My two boys loved it:)  I used lipton onion soup mix instead of the onions, and I did put the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom.  I will definately make again.

This was a good recipe. It went over well with all the kids. The sweeter taste was nice and I especially like the ginger in it. We will be making it again.

My boyfriend's mouth dropped when he tasted this! He used to praise his mom's recipe...not anymore! I did everything just like the recipe said except I used ground turkey. I even used the sauce as "gravy" for the mashed potatoes. This is a very simple yet exquisite recipe that any beginner can experiment with (I've only cooked simple desserts before...and I have manage to burn microwavable mac & cheese, so be amazed!).

This would be one of my families favourite meals - especially my husbands. I'm going cut the milk to 1/4 cup and put the brown sugar & ketchup on top - it's ashame to lose all that yummy sauce to the bottom of the pan!

I can't believe I haven't rated this until now.  My family considers this my signature dish.  I usually make it with ground turkey and there are NO complaints.  I have to make two loaves so there are some left-overs for lunch.

This is a fun alternative to a standard meatloaf.  Next time I will put the ketchup/brown sugar mixture on the top because fat accumulated in the bottom of the pan diluting it.

This meatloaf is on the sweet side, but that is how we like it at our house.  Great with mashed potatoes and even better the next day as leftovers.

Very good. I would put the sugar and ketchup on top just after it's finished cooking and put back in the oven. I used less onions. I'm going to add bell peppers next time!

Before I moved South, I thought there was only one kind of meatloaf--wrong. There is this kind with more of a sweet and sour sauce flavor, then a straight up ketchup kind. As far as the Southern Style meatloaf goes, this one is awesome. I do, though, prefer a little more ketchup flavor, and will modify it the next time I make it. I used seasoned breadcrumbs instead of crackers, reduced the brown sugar (thank goodness!), and added worstechire sauce to both the glaze and the meat. I will admit, it is delicious, and I will definitely make again.

It was good. I may have cooked it a tad too long but I would like to try it again with another set of people to get a different opinion. I did not have a "loaf" shape dish so I had to use a regular dish. Also, I would add a little more ketchup.

I really enjoyed this meatloaf dish.  The only thing I would change is cut out the amount of brown sugar (it was abit too sweet for me).  I like how the ketchup sauce just ooze and bubble over the top when it cookes.  The meatloaf was surprising moist and juicy.  But the middle was nearly collapsing as I think I might not have added enough binding ingredient (crushed crackers).  Next time, I may try bread crumbs or oatmeals!  Flavor is very good!

This was excellent!  I took other's advice....substituted onion soup mix in place of onions, used 1/2 cup milk, I used more crackers to get the consistancy I wanted.  Oh, I put the meat in muffin tins with sauce on the bottom and on top.  Next time may just spread on top before cooking though because I ended up having to scoop it out with a spatula before serving anyways.  My 3 boys and dh all LOVED it!!!  Can't mess up this recipe!  Very versitile and absolutely delicious!

This was wonderful!!  I like meatloaf, but this was really, really good.  I added worchester sauce and sauteed the onions like the other reviews said.  I also made it with oatmeal instad of crackers and upped the salt a little.  My husband even said he'd eat it for leftovers!

This was fantastic. I made it the way it states with brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom, I just added a little more ketchup and brown sugar about a cup each. It was so juicy and full of flavor, I am personally not a huge meatloaf fan, usually greasy and kinda bland, this had me going up for seconds, I will never make another meatloaf again.

Considering the fact this is one of this website's all time champions I had to try it. I did reduce the brown sugar a little. I threw everything together since I didn't read directions first. I thought it was perfect.

This has to be the best meatloaf I have ever had!  My husband has been wanting a good meatloaf and let me tell you, we went through numerous recipes until I found this one. Everyone in my family (even my 4 year old) loved it!!!  Don't let the brown sugar through you off, it really enhances the flavor.  The only changes I made were per the advice of other reviewers...I reduced to  1/3 cp brown sugar, added 1 tbs worchestire sauce to the beef, used Lipton onion soup mix instead of an onion, and used oatmeal instead of saltines.  It was wonderful. It's a "must try."

I put the sugar mixture on top as suggested and it was far too sweet for my taste. If I were to ever make it again I would put the sweet on the bottom, as in the recipe. Perhaps this concentrates the flavor to the bottom of the loaf to not overpower the whole dish.

This was really good, I am not a fan of meatloaf and I had seconds.  The brown sugar really gives it a different taste.

Update- Since going Grain Free, I omitted the milk and Crackers, and added 1/8 cup almond flour and 1/8 cup ground flaxseed.  Still a hit in our house.

I have never liked my meatloaf before.  It just never turned out right.  This was very good.  I read some other reviews and decided to do the brown sugar and ketchup layers on the top as well as the bottom.  That was delicious.

I came across the recipe a few years ago and have made it several times.  I have 4 very picky eaters and they rave for this recipe.  My 9 year old begs to have this every week.  I don't change anything in the recipe, except omitting the onions.  I would recommend this recipe to everyone with kids!

I made this meatloaf mostly according to the directions and it came out great.  I cut the ketchup/brown sugar mix in half and added some to the top of the meatloaf.  I will definitely make it again.  Next time though I will add some caynenne or chili peppers to spice it up a bit.

Tasted pretty good...for a loaf of meat. I guess meatloaf just isn't my thing, but I thought I'd try it anyway. Hubby and Mother liked it. I put the brown sugar and ketchup on top, omitted the ginger, and added worch sauce to the meat. I might cut back a little on the brown sugar next time because it was a little too sweet for my taste, but the sweetness did add a nice touch.

Excellent simple recipe.  I actually combined breakfast sausage, ground beef and ground turkey to equal the amount of meat that was needed to give it a little different flavor and it was pretty good.  But I've also followed the recipe as is and it was wonderful as well, I wouldn't change anything from the original recipe.

Four and a half stars from over 2,000 reviews is worth looking in to and I wasn't sorry I did with this one.  Big hit at our dinner table last night.  Made it as written except that I made three mini-loaves instead of one big one.  It was done in a little over half the time.  I put the brown sugar/ketchup on the bottom & then turned the loaves out upside down on a platter.  It ended up with this really yummy barbecue-esque sauce, though I would recommend VERY lean ground beef or your sauce will have a lot of grease in it.  We'll be making this one again!

This meatloaf was the BOMB!!!!!!!!!! It was perfect as is not to sweet and moist as ever. If my daughter whose fav food is potatoes says no to them and wants more meatloaf then this recipe is a keeper.  I wish i could give it 10 out of 10.  The only thing i changed was i used ritz crackers becuase we never have saltines but i did everything as told.  I did pour some of the grease off when finished but when i saw the ketchup coming out i stopped and flipped it on a plate. My husband loved it too.  Best meatloaf ever!!!!!

Love it!  Used other recommendations & split sauce in 1/2 -some on bottom & some on top.  Also used garlic instead. Make sure to "drain" grease before serving. A family favorite!

Just like the rating/numbers show, this is an excellent meatloaf!

I should add that I left out the ginger, and used soy milk instead of regular.

The meatloaf, itself, was good, however the brown sugar was just a tad too sweet for meatloaf.  Both my husband I felt this was not a do-over.

Considering I hate meatloaf I can actually eat this...my family love it! 
I've taken to making at least double of this (once I quadroupled it) then freeze the extra. 
I used to freeze it in foil loaf pans, but soon realized that it took forever to defrost this way.
Now I freeze the mixture flattened out in a ziplock bag - it takes no time to defrost and I can stick in a loaf pan and bake it.

This is my family's favorite meatloaf.  Only change that I made was that I used a packet of onion soup mix instead of the chopped onion.

This recipe turned out excellent. I cut back on the amount of brown sugar used. It still turned out a bit sweet and very yummy!

I have made this for many years. This is an amazing recipe and my family loves it. I did also add brown sugar to the top and some ketchup, that is the only alteration i made. What really irks me is when someone rates and changes a recipe.... Write your own recipe instead of changing everything to something other then the original.!!!!

This was really good. Sweet, yes, but not any than a sweet barbeque sauce. Nice and moist. BF ate 3 huge pieces.

Decent but my family just didn't really enjoy this.  It was very sweet so I would def. cut down on the sugar but even making that change, I don't believe we will be trying this again.

This is a great meatloaf recipe! My husband who is usually like "Ewwww Meatloaf" ate three servings! The only thing I did different was add some ketchup and a few pinches of brown sugar to the mixture. I also added a few dashes of onion powder for flavor. This was delicious and I will make it again!

It was good just bland in the middle.  I also didn't put the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom of the pan instead I put it on top.

Everyone really enjoyed this meatloaf.  I usually have ketchup on my plate to dip my meatloaf in, and with this recipe, there is no need.  It also made excellent meatloaf sandwiches the next day.  Thanks for sharing!

I'm not much of a meatloaf person, but my husband is! I decided to give this a try and this is the only meatloaf that I will eat!  I cut the brown sugar to 1/4 and omitted the ginger and put the sauce on top of the loaf, it came out very moist and flavorful.

This is an amazing recipe. My roomate hates meatloaf- but loves this recipe. It can get very sweet if you use too much brown sugar- but if you follow the recipe you will be very happy. It's a great treat.

I am not a meatloaf fan but I gotta tell you this stuff is so good. I've made it twice and the first time I cut down on the brown sugar and milk and used italian bread crumbs. The second time I made it as written except added some garlic powder and oregano to the cracker crumbs. It was fantastic either way.

This was a great recipe for meatloaf. My family really enjoyed it. I only made a few changes. First off I added less sugar to the sauce and I added it on top. It gave the meatloaf a very pretty look. Also, I added 3/4 tsp. garlic and lots of cilantro! Tasted great!

This was my first attempt at meatloaf.  A great start.  It wasn't pretty, but my meal guests said meatloaf isn't supposed to be pretty.  With mashed potatoes and gravy it was a great meal!  A sort of funny one for July, but this will be a staple in our house this Fall!
UPDATE: I just made this again with the added 1 Tbsp. of Worsh. sauce, garlic and the wet stuff on top. It was great.  Found another great meatloaf recipe!

I LOVE THIS MEATLOAF!!! I put the glaze on top of the loaf instead though, didn't seem right to dig it out of the bottom. There's such little that goes into it but it is SO flavorful. When me and my fiance sit down to eat this all you hear is "Oh my gosh!" it almost sounds like something else is going on! haha TRY IT!

This was really great meatloaf. I added some smoked gouda and bacon and it was better than 5 stars! Thanks for the post and all the comments, as I too cut back on the sugar and added Worchestershire sp? sauce. I also added some onion and garlic that I sauteed! Really Yummy!!!

This is a great meatloaf. I did as other reviewers suggested and put the ketchup/sugar mix on top of the meatloaf, and only used 1/4 cup or less of the brown sugar. Will definitely make again, with twice baked potatoes and a salad- mmm!

I loved this meatloaf and I am not even a big fan of meatloaf! Next time I'll definitely make extra sauce to top it off with...it was very tastey!  I would recommend putting it on top of the meatloaf also, not on the bottom.

I've been making this for a couple years now, so I'm not sure why I have never rated it.  Anyhow, I obviously must think it's wonderful if I've been making it for a couple years!!

My parents freezer broke, so we had to cook up all the meat into meals for the week.  I volunteered to make a meatloaf with the ground beef, and for someone who does not like meatloaf, this was pretty good.

I love this recipe!  I usually hate meatloaf, but this one is fantastic!  It garnered the highest praise from my husband.  He said it was better than his Mom's, and that is indeed an accomplishment.  I added crushed garlic and worcestershire to add a bit of kick.  Also, I use Ritz cracker instead of Saltines.  Wonderful recipe!

My sister came to visit and we wanted comfort food so we thought, meatloaf! I found this recipe and was interested.  I love the basic premise but changed a few things.
1.I added half a green pepper and 2 cloves of garlic
2.no ginger!!!
3. added 1tsp soy sauce, 1tsp worcesteshire sauce.
4.half beef, half pork
I pureed the pepper, onion and garlic (remember family hates chunky veggies.
after reading other reviews, I used only a quarter of the brown sugar.  I ran out of ketchup so I had to mix cocktail sauce with it to put over the sugar.  I had to add about a half a cup of plain bread crumbs, the pureed veggies added moisture. It was awesome!!  got many rave reviews.  loved it, will use it again.

Did not turn out as expected. I think the ketchup/brown sugar needs to be mixed in the meat. Think I will look for another recipe.

This was good meatloaf.  For some reason it was a little spicy, but it was good.  I did put the brown sugar, ketchup glaze on top.  Also, I added a pinch of dried rosemary. I will definitely make this again.

I used 1 pound of hamburger instead of the 1 1/2 called for, but used the same amount of ingredients (with the exception of 1/4 milk and 1/4 brown sugar instead).  I put the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom as called for.  After an hour, it was delicious.  When I flipped it, it came out just like my Mom's... 'ketchuppy' and just plain yummy!

Used ground turkey, Italian seasoned breadcrumbs and added a few dashes of Worcheshire, otherwise made as directed.  Really good, my husband liked it better than the meatloaf I usually make.  Will make again.

Very easy to make and reusable ingredients.

For the cracker crumbs, I found some breadcrumbs panko stuff from the market.  For the small onion, I just got some french onion soup mix powder.

I was a little skeptical about the brown sugar in this as well as the ginger but I love it! I served it with baked beans and a pasta salad.  I will definately make this again.  Instead of chopping the onion and adding salt and pepper, I used a package of onion soup mix.  It worked great!

YUMMY!  I took other's advice and and used Ritz crackers and put some of the brown sugar and ketchup on top.  I made the mistake of putting extra brown sugar and ketchup on top so it came out a little sweet - next time I won't use extra, I'll split what the recipe calls for.  This is definitely a recipe that is going in my books.

My family loves meatloaf and I never did, well I made this meatloaf and I loved it. I am now the one in the family who makes the best meatloaf. I used onion soup mix instead of chopped onions and I added worcheshire sauce. It was great. Thanks for the recipe.

I also took other reviewers' advice and changed some things. I used Ritz and added the ketchup and brown sugar glaze to the top as well as the bottom. It got rave reviews. It was perfectly tender, buttery, sweet, and held together quite well. Thanks for this new staple recipe!

Wonderful!  Freezes great as well! My family (including my mom who was visiting) was thrilled with this!  Even my son ate it (he is a very picky three year old...)  Thanks for the recipe!  I also followed the advice to put the sauce on top - yummy and easy!

Very good sweet meatloaf. This was a nice change from my daycare's normal more spicy meatloaf. The kids really liked it, even my picky eaters ate seconds.

I thought that the meatloaf itself was excellent, but I wouldn't add the glaze again.

I'm new at cooking but this recipe was so simple that I thought I actually knew what I was doing.  It tasted great but we all decided to skip desert because this main dish was sssoooo sweet.

The flavor was awesome, but the ketchup and brown sugar on the bottom just created a big mess.  Will probably make again, with slight modifications.

It was OK, easy to make.  I didn't enjoy the ginger in this recipe.  When I make it the next time I will substitute the ginger for onion soup mix.

My husband loved this recipe! He ate almost half the loaf at dinner. I thought it was really good, even though I'm not really a meatloaf fan. I'll make it again. I put the brown sugar and ketchup on the top of the loaf instead of the bottom and used different crackers since I didn't have saltines.

Wow, this recipe was so great! It was so quick to throw together and was done in 1 hour. I followed the recipe exactly too and I thought the texture was perfect, not too greasey at all (I used 93% lean) and my 1 year old gobbled it up! Thanks!

My husbands first word was "WOW".  He actually went back for seconds (which he never does).  My son loved it as well.  will definatelly will make this again.  I followed the recipe to a "T".  I did have to cook it a bit longer (maybe I had a little more meat than it called for).  Unbelievable recipe - you gotta try it.  Next time i will shape into more than one loaf to cut down on cooking time.

Now this is worth 5 stars! It will be my meatloaf recipe from now on. Like many previous reviewers, I put the sauce on top of the meatloaf - I added some yellow mustard to the sauce for a little extra flavor and cut the milk back to 1/2 cup (don't know why) - One thing I did wrong: I accidently baked this with my oven set on convection. Don't do this - It would not get done in the middle. It was so strange...I ended up having to microwave some center peices so we could eat it! Still, delicious!

I read this about a week ago and have been looking forward to making it today (Easter)I was SO thriled with how great it turned out!!

I did not use milk though, my stomach can not handle it anymore plus I dont like my meatloaf too moist as it always has an "uncooked" texture to me, and I did take the advice as some of the others and put the kethup and brown sugar on top. It came out amazing!!

Thanks!!!

This meatloaf came out delicious.  The brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom turned into a great sauce.  We ate almost the entire thing in one meal.  Thank you for the great recipe!

Great recipe!  Kids liked the glaze.  I put a very thin layer of brown sugar and ketchup on botton of baking dish and reserved the majority of it for the top of the meatloaf as prior reviews suggested.

Finding a good meatloaf recipe has always been a problem for me -- this one is GREAT! The fam was pleasantly surprised. I split the brown sugar/ketchup mixture & did half on bottom & half on top. The loaf was tasty & had nice texture - not crumbly, not hamburger-ish! THANX 4 sharing!

I have now made this dish twice and both times it was WONDERFUL!! The first time I layered the brown sugar on top then poured the ketchup over it, which ran off the sides mostly.  Tonight I mixed the brown sugar and ketchup together then added to the top of the meatloaf and what a difference!! I've quit searching for the perfect meatloaf now.  Thank You AllRecipes!! :)

This recipe was excellent! Very greasy on the bottom, so watch out. Defintiely take the advice of others... put the glaze on top, with a splash of Worchestire. Excellent, and not too sweet!

This was certainly better than your average meatloaf.  The first time I made it I followed the instructions and wasn't completely satisfied, so the second time I put the brown sugar and ketchup on top.  Much better.

Had to give it 4 Stars because I made my own meat mixture but used the Brown Sugar on top but next time I will use on top and bottom.  Made my own recipe even better.  Thanks

This is a great meatloaf recipe.  I didn't have saltine crackers, so I just used bread crumbs.  I served it along with some mashed potatoes.  My husband loved it!

This is awesome!!!  I love this recipe...  Better yet, so does everyone that I have made it for.  It is easy and delicious.
The second time that I made it I was out of katsup and used Prego spagehetti sause (tomato and basil) and it was still out of this world delicious!!
Thanks for the recipe.

This was definitely tasty, but a bit too sweet for me.  Would definitely make again, but will cut down on the sugar next time.

This is an outstanding meatloaf recipe. I've tweaked it to make it lower in sodium to suit my family's dietary needs and I put the brown sugar/ketchup mixture on top only. I also use ground turkey in place of ground beef and it's just awesome.

I've made this three times and it came out perfectly every time with rave reviews from the family.  I did bake it with the brown sugar and ketchup on top like other reviewers had suggested and it tasted great.  The only other thing that I did differently was reduce the amount of sugar by 1/4 cup.  Will definitely make this again and again!

Love the recipe!  I wish I would have done what others suggested....use half the brown sugar/ketchup mix on the top.  Then I would have given this recipe a 10 star rating!  My son love it too!

Outstanding!  I pretty much make the recipe as given with a few minor changes: I don't use meatloaf pans. I just form a loaf by hand in a baking pan & then slather (again with my hands) the loaf with the ketchup and brown sugar mix before throwing it into the oven. I also just keep a bag with cracker crumbs in it--you know, those bits and pieces of Cheez-Its or Ritz crackers that no one will eat--so I just use whatever's in there instead of saltines. The cheese crackers actually work well with this. This is the only meatloaf recipe I make now.

Really, really good meatloaf.  I took the suggestion about halving the sauce/sugar mix and putting half on bottom and half on top and it was great!  I added a little spice to our liking and then it was gone!

Even my picky son who vowed before I made this that he "would never eat meatloaf again!!!!" was asking for seconds. I served it with the Scallop Potatoes & Onions recipe from this site and it was a delicious combination.

Weekly favorite.  The sauce goes on top of mine, and I put a couple dashes of barbeque sauce into the meat mixture for some added depth.  I also make two and freeze one without the sauce for later.

My parents both said it was the best meatloaf they'd ever had. My dad said it beats the meatloaf his mom used to make. My boyfriend had 2 helpings of it and I'm not a fan of meatloaf-and I thought it was yummy! I also sprinkled some brown sugar and ketchup on top! Will definitely make again!

This is, without a doubt, the best meatlof I've ever had! This will become a regular on our dinner menu. The only thing I added was about a teaspoon of McCormick's Seasoned Pepper. Excellent!

My first attempt at meatloaf--very delicious!  I used the ketchup/brown sugar sauce mixture with worcestershire, and brushed it along the bottom and top.  Instead of crackers, I used croutons since that's all I had, and everything still turned out very nicely.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! This was the first time I ever made meatloaf.  It came out perfect!  The whole family loved it.  We found the sauce a bit too sweet.  I will cut back on the brown sugar next time. I will definitely make it again.

This was a great recipe!  VERY flavorful!  I did added just a little bit of worcestshire sauce in the glaze and in the meat.  For the glaze I mixed together the br. sugar, ketchup and worc. sauce and put it on top of the meatloaf.  I also just put a little less of the milk in.  It was very good though, I served this with the perfect baked potato recipe on here and some corn on the cob!  Great combo!  Very filling!

Very good meatloaf - it stays together when sliced.  I added a clove of minced garlic and instead of using and putting the sauce from the recipe on the bottom, I used the sauce from "Rosemary Turkey Meatloaf":

1 8oz cup of canned tomato sauce
3/4 cup of brown sugar
1 Tbs of dijon mustard

Mixed together and poured on top - delicious!  Make sure you save extra sauce for later!

This recipe is amazing.  Only slight changes made all the difference. After I greased the pan, i put marinara and honey on the bottom, and saved the kectchup and brown sugar mix for the top only. I also used sweetended condensed can milk instead of regular milk, and used corn flake crumbs instead of crackers. I also used adobo seasoning on the meat and added a little brown sugar to teh meat aswell when mixing all the ingrdients.  After 45 minutes, i cut the loaf in slices so the meat could thoroughly cook.  It was truly amazing-unbelievably tasty and moist and not too sweet.  My husband could not keep raving about it.  He devoured it all, even though he just came home from a dinner meeting.

This has become my husband favorite meatloaf recipe.  He won't let me make meatloaf any other way...I added green peppers to the mix and also decided to make it regular size.  I cook the meatloaf for an hour then pour the brown sugar/ketchup sauce on top and bake for 10 more minutes. Delicious!!!

This is wonderfully tasty meatloaf, but I just can't bring myself to make upside down meatloaf.  So I make this with the sugar and catsup mixed and on top of the meatloaf...  Also, I do decrease the sugar a little and add a little onion powder to the topping.  But at least the way I make it, it turns out wonderfully!

Everyone  in my family loves this recipe. The only changes I've made is I add 3/4 pound of ground pork and 3/4 ground beef and I use can milk instead of regular milk.  If kids and grandkids are here, there's never any leftovers.

I followed the recipe exactly and used 93% lean hamburger.  I basted the meatloaf every 10 minutes for the last 1/2 hour of baking time and it did leave a nice glaze on the top.  The only meatloaf I've made in the past was the one that contains oats in it, which I think is gross.
2012 Edit - Tried a grated pan with the brown sugar/catsup on top instead of bottom.  mmmmm Enough said!

I think the next time I make it, I'll put the brown sugar/catchup on top of the meatloaf instead of the bottom.  I'll also put it on a grated pan so the loaf is not floating in its own grease. 

In all, the flavor was wonderful and my family did enjoy this.  Thanks!

i have never had meatloaf nor made one. It is so simple to make and surprisingly loads of flavour-used less sugar as mentioned and used Cream crackers instead. Yummy!

Everyone liked this at our house.  I even ate a bit, though I am not a meatloaf lover....and it was tasty.  My only problem with it, was that the "sauce" didn't really become a "sauce".  Oddly enough, the ketchup just sort of floated in globs within the sweet grease, lol.  But I'd make it again and just drain it off like I did this time. Thanks!

I gave the meatloaf when so me fr iends came over.  They loved it!!!! We didnt have any left overs.  I did not use milk and I used a package of onion with mushroom soup, an egg, breatcrumbs. I also added a bit of ketchup and mustard (very little) The meatloaf was soft and juicy. Everyone was asking me what did I put on the top. It did not break in the overn.  I will definetly make this again.

I followed the recipe for my first attempt at meatloaf. It turned out great! I made more sauce and put the sauce at the bottom of the pan, as well as the top and sides so that the sauce was in every bite! Great! 5-star!

A definate 5 star meatloaf.  I did add a splash of cayenne garlic sauce to the glaze to balance the sweet.  I also used ritz crackers instead of saltine.  Otherwise I followed the recipe as is and i was worried because it felt very mushy/wet but it turned out perfect! Thanx for this keeper.

Great and very easy!  I agree that the ketchup and brown sugar should go on top especially if you like to drain off excess grease.

Absolutely Delicious! I've never made meatloaf before and this is super easy and super delicious As per the recs, I used a bit less of brown sugar. I also used a tablespoon of worcestshire sauce in the meatloaf and a table of it in the glaze. I mixed the brown sugar, the ketchup and the worcestshire sauce and put it on top of the meatloaf when about 20 minutes were left. I also recommend having a bit extra for those who like extra sauce on the side (I know I do!). Yum!

Best meatloaf I've ever had!  I only had a pound of meat, so I just added extra crackers and it turned out very good!  I also added a little extra ketchup on top.

I made this meatloaf again last night with a few revisions.  I had no eggs so since I use ground turkey anyway, I decided to try it out since ground turkey binds together better than ground beef.  Excellent!!  I cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup and used 2 slices of honey-wheat bread instead of the cracker crumbs.  It actually held together better than it ever had when I made it previously.  I will definitely be making it again without the eggs - very low in cholesterol after that change.

I've been making this wonderful meatloaf for several years now.  It is just simply delicious.  Not too "salty" or heavy on spices; moist and flavorful.  The only thing I have found is that I need to bake it longer than an hour---sometimes even up to 2 hours.  Try this recipe, you'll never make any other meatloaf!

I used turkey instead of beef, added garlic and wocestershire sauce to both the loaf and glaze, and reduced the amount of milk and put the glaze on top of the loaf. It was fantastic. Would definately make again.

a great tasting meatloaf from a non-lover of meatloaf.  Added some Lea & Perrins, Lawry's seasonsalt in place of regular salt, and Ritz cracker crumbs.  Kept the method of preparation the same because I was curious in preparing a meatloaf this way.  I waited for it to cool a bit and flipped it out onto a platter so the sauce would be on top.  The only thing I don't like about the sauce being on the bottom, is that it mixes with the grease from the beef(used ground chuck).  I will follow LadyJayPee's advice and next time drain off some of the dripping then place the brown sugar/ketchup mixture on top.  I did like the sweet/savory combo.  I didn't find it too loose, it stayed together in a rectangle and cut perfectly into slices.  DH is the meatloaf lover in the house and will enjoy.

I used half ground beef and half ground pork and put the sauce (with half the sugar)on top in the last 15 minutes. I added a celery stalk, 3 cloves garlic, 1 tsp thyme, 1 tbsp worcestire, and dash of celery salt because I love flavor and knew it wouldn't be enough as is. Next time, I will make extra sauce and put half in the meatloaf and half on top to get more of that great flavor thru out.

This recipe was awesome. I loved the glaze it made as it cooked. I am not a big meatloaf fan, and neither is my fiance, but I thought I would give this recipe a shot. The sweet glaze gives it great flavor. I will definitely make this again. Delicious!

I made this last night for dinner. It was a hit! The only change I made was to combine the brown sugar and ketchup and use half the mixture on the bottom of the pan and the other half for the top of the loaf as others have suggested. Thanks!

Maybe I didn't do something right in all fairness but the brown sugar "sauce" made it gooey. Though it tasted good. I will try to make this again though.

I was a little skeptical about putting the brown sugar and ketchup underneath the loaf since everyother recipe I've used puts it on top, but WOW... it turned out great. I used 1/4 cup brown sugar instead of 1/2 cup and it was perfect. Not often have we decided to use the same meatloaf recipe twice. This is a definite do-again meatloaf! Thanks!

This is the best meatloaf that I have ever made.  I've made it several times and everyone loves it.  I've been using lean ground turkey instead of ground beef and I found that 1/3 cup milk worked better with the ground turkey

I served this to company last night and they raved about how good it was.  I didn't change a thing and we thought the flavor was 'just right'.  I poured the 'sauce' over the sliced meatloaf before serving.  When I asked my family what they'd rate it 1-5 they said 5 except my son,  he said 7 or 8 AND I want the recipe!!  Thanks much for a great meatloaf recipe.  I'll be making this one again and again.

This was the best meatloaf receipe I ever made.  Even my 10 year old who never liked meatloaf before ate this.  Next time I will make two - It was even good cold.  But just so you know, it is on the sweet side.  You could probably cut down on the sugar - but I won't!  Thanks for a great receipe

I really enjoyed the flavor, I used extra lean hamb and I still had a lot of grease so I think the bottom flavoring was mostly poured out--I will cook it again

We had this for Sunday lunch. Everyone loved it. I had hoped more of the sugar and ketchup flavor would be in the meat since I am a sweets lover. :) Next time, I'll add some of the glaze mixture to the meat mixture. Absolutely a great recipe and I will be making this often. Thank you so much for sharing.

One of my daughters and myself thought it to be too sweet, my husband and other daughter thought it was good. Other than the sweetness, I didn't find it to be too different than my standard meatloaf recipe.

Very good.    Couldn't believe how moist it was.  Followed advice and put ketchup and brown sugar on top.  Will mix the two next time and try with worchestire sauce.  A couple of the kids did not like the topping but it was so easy to remove.  Will definitely make again.

My wife has been baking this for years. It totally sold us on the concept of allrecipes and buy the books!

My wife gets requests to make this dish every month for the entire ohana!

BTW, we always substitutes the crackers with days old bread.

What a great recipe!!  Instead of using saltine crackers, I used italian bread crumbs, and also put half the brown sugar/ketchup on the top as a glaze!  Our dinner guests that we made this for took home the recipe with them!  Thanks :)

This was amazing!  I'm a huge meatloaf fan and always looking for new ways to make it.  My family loved it!  I followed a couple of other reviews and added onion soup mix (skipped the onion), some wostershire sauce and then topped it with a mix of 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup ketchup.  This is definately a keeper in my house!

Meatloaf was good, but the glaze was too sweet.  I added Frank's Red Hot and Worcestershire, and it was still sweet.  I put the glaze on top as well as bottom, and it was a good thing because the bottom glaze didn't take.  Anyway, good enough but I will cut way back on the brown sugar and add heat to balance everything with red pepper flakes or cayenne pepper.  Thanks!

Darn near perfect.  Use ground pork, veal and beef combined and it's even better.  Like others i used bread crumbs instead of crackers also.  Firm just juicy.  Love it.

I usually don't eat meatloaf, but my fiance asked for it so I tried this recipe.  We enjoyed it, but we both thought it had too much onion in it (maybe my 'small' onion wasn't small enough).  Also, it took 1-1/2 hours to cook and I know it wasn't a problem with my oven.  Overall it was good and I will probably make this again, but add another dimension to the taste by spicing it up with some chili powder for a 'sweet and spicy' flavor.  Thanks!

This is the best meatloaf ever.  I make it exactly as the recipe calls and it is by far the best meatloaf.  We make this at least every other week.

This is THE best meatloaf and it was a huge hit. I've never been able to make a meatloaf without it being mushy and done completely within an hour. This recipe was super easy. I added about half a package of dry onion soup mix. WONDERFUL!

My husband is allergic to poultry so I have a lot of time to perfect beef recipes.  We used extra lean ground beef and followed the recipe exactly.  It is our favorite meatloaf recipe (and I've tried at least 5) and makes it to our table frequently.  Everyone who has tried it at our table always comments on how yummy it is.

My boyfriend loved it!!! Used 7% fat ground turkey instead of beef, and added some worchestershire sauce for flavor. Since I was going for the spicy/sweet thing, I also added about a tablespoon of jamaican jerk seaoning. Not too overpowering but gave the meat a really savory flavor! Like other users, I cut the brown sugar to half, mixed with ketchup, added 1 Tbl hot sauce to liven it up, and poured it over the top. Baked up perfect, flavorful and moist.

Wow!  The flavors meshed so well together, and I took others advice and did not use as much brown sugar.  I also added cheddar cheese to the meat loaf and it came out delicious.  My husband could not get enough!

I do not like meatloaf, but I wanted to make a "mom" favorite for my meat-and-potatoes husband.  This was so great!  I used 1 pound 92% lean ground beef and 1 pound ground pork.  Instead of the onion I used 1/2 can french-fried onions, then topped with other 1/2 can last five minutes of baking.  I used Ritz crackers, and cut brown sugar to 1/4 cup.  It was light but flavorful and not at all greasy.  A new favorite in our house!

Nice and moist, with a little sweetness. I did have to only bake for 40 minutes, instead of an hour and I used
95% lean beef. Excellent recipe!

This was very good!!! My 13 year old daughter loved it, too.  I didn't have crackers on hand so I crushed some baked pretzels.  I believe I almost had to double the amount of crushed pretzels.  Otherwise the meat was too mushy....  But it turned out awesome!!!!
Thanks!!!

It was a big hit with my guys. I did make a couple of changes. I put half the ketchup/brown sugar mix on the top and half on the bottom. I subbed saltines for 1 cup of Honey Nut Cheerios since thats what I had on hand. Also, I add 1/4 cup milk and 1/2 a cup creamed corn as recommended by another reviewer, and omitted the ginger. Also I used about half the salt called for and 1 tsp of minced onion instead of a whole onion.

Excellent, Fantastic, and just an all around GREAT recipe!  The first bite shocked me a bit due to the sweetness but by bite 2 I had found one of the greatest ever!  I served it with "cowboy mashed potatoes" and salad. What a dinner!!!

I made this for the first time tonight.  My family loved it and gobbled it up!  I added some tomato paste and rosemary and the flavor of the meat itself was very good.  For the sauce I only used 1/3 cup of sugar as others have suggested and it turned out really good.

I altered this quite a bit, and I am glad I did otherwise I don't think the meat itself would have had enough flavor.  I followed the reciped, but instead of saltines, I used 1 1/2 cups of crushed cheez-its. (you need more to thicken the loaf, otherwise it was a huge ball of mush) I added about 1/2 cup shredded chedder cheese.  I doubled the ginger, and lessened the brown sugar.  I think I should have halved the brown sugar and ketchup as it was WAY too sweet.  My two year old and I liked it, but my husband thought it was too sweet.  The meatloaf itself was yummy, flavorful and moist.

I've tried so many meatloaf recipe...this was yummy!  I didn't use as much brown sugar though.  I also didn't have saltine crackers, so I had to use bread crumbs.  I didn't have ginger pwd either.  My meatloaf wasn't as firm...but maybe because I used bread crumbs instead?  I will definitely be making this more in the future.   Thanks for sharing!!

I really did not enjoy this meatloaf. If you enjoy depth of flavor this meatloaf is not for you the flavor is purely of cooked beef and sugar nothing else. As soon as dinner was over i got the recipe out of my cabinet and threw it in the trash. I was very dissapointed

This meatloaf was very good, but too sweet for our tastes. I also agree with other reviewers that the meat mixture itself needs a bit more spice. Over all, very hearty and a good dinner. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I gave it 4 stars because I really liked the glaze. The meatloaf itself wasn't really that special, but I'm going to try it again with the saltine crackers since all I had was a bag of breadcrumbs. I'll try a little more ginger and will cut down on the onions since I put way to many in.
There just wasn't anything spectacular about this meatloaf so maybe I need to really follow the recipe.
It cooked an hour and still did not get done all the way through.
I'll give it another try, but I think the other one that I found on this site is truly our favorite.

This was good.  I used ground turkey insead of beef to make it healthier.  There was too much moisture.  Perhaps my fault.  It was very tasty and sweet though.  May make again if in the mood for a sweet meat loaf.

This was a huge success in my house!  EVERYONE liked this meat loaf.  The only thing I did differently was to saute the onions in butter before adding them to the meat.  I prefer them to not be crunchy at all when the meat loaf is finished.  I'll make this again and again!

Possibly the best meatloaf I've ever made.  I varied the meat by using eqaul parts ground beef/veal/sausage and used 1 cup (instead of 3/4 cup) of ritz cracker crumbs (because I had no saltines) to soak up more liquid.  A tad more ginger and less brown sugar would be my only other changes.  the first meatloaf I've made that was perfect for slicing the next day - meatloaf sandwiches - yummy!

I printed off this recipe over a year ago from this website.  I make the meatloaf at least once per month.  Everyone who has tried it has loved it.  I will never use another meatloaf recipe again.  I use a mixture of ground pork and gound sirloin instead of just gound beef.

Great Meatloaf..Much better than my original recipe!  I only used 1/2 cup of milk, left out the ginger, used 1/4 cup of both b.sugar and ketchup and only put it on half of the meatloaf, b/c I was unsure if my family would like this, but turned out that it was not too sweet but perfect and next time I will put it on the whole thing!

I tryed this recipe as a new meatloaf. My husband and I are not huge meatloaf people but we thought we would give it a try.  The meatloaf itself was very good, we just decided we are not meatloaf people.

Very nice meatloaf.  It had an excellent flavor.  It was very heavy with onions, I think next time I will reduce the onions by about half.

Like most other reviewers, I cut the sugar in half.  I also used Heinz 57 instead of ketchup (because it was all I had in the fridge).  I used dried onion flakes instead of real onion and crushed ginger from a jar instead of dried (about 1/2 tsp jarred vs. 1/4 tsp dried).  Like other reviewers, I put most of the brown sugar glaze on the top of the meatloaf.  This was FANTASTIC.  We don't even like meatloaf.  My boyfriend bought a huge pack of ground beef, and I was desparate for a way to use it up before it went bad.  But we *both* loved this.  The leftovers didn't last long at all.  We would definitely make this again.  We were pleasantly surprised by this recipe!  Who knew we liked meatloaf?

I cut the brown sugar in half the second time I made it, it was a little much the first time.  I make this often & I just use dried onion flakes to save time.

This was a little too sweet for our taste.  If I would make again, I would sub onion soup mix for the chopped onion because we don't like big chunks of onion.  I put the glaze on the top and bottom but ended up with a lot of greasy liquid brown sugar - not very appetizing.

Ohhhh, this was SO good. I cut the recipe in half for our home of two, and devoured the thing. Will definitely be making again. Served with green beans and mashed potatoes. How much more all-American comfort food can you get??!!

Wow!  My husband is still talking about this meatloaf a week later.  I usually only make meatloaf once every few years because it always falls apart.  This recipe was great.  Only the very center slices were a little crumbly.  I used 1 # lean ground beef and 1/2 # lean ground turkey.  Could taste the turkey slightly.
Served this with cheese potatoes and it was a great 'comfort food' meal.  This will be my meatloaf recipe from now on.  Leftovers make great sandwiches.

I have made this again and it came out perfect.  Meatloaf was moist and the "crust" was so good!  Only omitted the onions because of a picky eater, but, other than that, followed exactly.  Yummy!

My family really enjoyed this meatloaf!!! The only thing I am going to do differently next time is add some tomatoes to the mix.

This was an absolutly amazing meatloaf recipe.  My husband said that this is the meatloaf he wants from now on and he wants me to cook up some more so he can take it to work and share it with his crew.

My husband said this is the best meatloaf that I have EVER made!!!(and I've made some pretty darn good meatloafs...)Do like others suggest, but brown sugar & ketchup mixture on top. I used 2 lbs of ground beef and used nutmeg instead of ginger. Dee-licious!!

This is a staple in our house!!  I omit the milk and just guesstimate on the ketchup & brown sugar...I'm sure I use less than called for but it's a no fail recipe.  I've been making this recipe for about 3 years and I don't even dare try another meatloaf recipe, (my husband would have a fit!).  My husband who doesn't even like meatloaf loves it.  Perfect!!  My 16 month old loves it as well.  Thank you!!!

No one in my family is a fan of meatloaf except for my twelve year old son. He complains  that i never make it so i searched for a new recipe because my old one was not up to  par. Everyone in my family agreed this is the best meatloaf they ever had and that they would't mind having it once a month.  I stuck to the recipe pretty much just added some adobo and crushed garlic, and green and red peppers that i sauteed in a little olive oil to the meat. I also put the brown sugar and ketchup on top of the loaf because i don't use a loaf pan, just shaped the meat into a loaf.

Excellent!  My husband, whose not a meatloaf fan, actually liked it.  Placing the sugar and ketchup on the bottom definitely makes a difference.  The flavor was more absorbed throughout the meat rather that just sitting on top.  I substituted quick oats for the cracker crumbs and omitted the milk and it still turned out wonderful.  It's a keeper in my recipe box!

Loved it! I do think it would be better if I had mixed the brown sugar/ketchup mixture with the meatloaf mix. Plus, it was just too sweet. So maybe it would be a better idea to half the brown sugar/ketchup mixture and then add it to the meat. I also forgot to add Worcetshire sauce like all the reviewers said. Oh well, it gives me a excuse to make this again! 
( Not that I need one:)

Who knew that meat loaf could be so yummy.   I followed the recipe exactly.  Did not saute the onions.   Just cut them small.  It was delicious.  Everyone loved it even the kids.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

To quote my dh "This is the best meatloaf I have ever had!" and I agree.  This will be the ONLY recipe I use for meatloaf from now on.  I followed the recipe with just these changes - I used 1# 95% lean gr. beef and 1# gr. pork loin - just cuz that's what I happened to have on hand.  Because of the extra meat, I increased the oatmeal by a scant 1/4c - I used oatmeal instead of bread based on other's recommendations- and did NOT reduce the milk.  I used seasoned salt instead of regular.  I adjusted my baking time to 40 minutes because my oven was set at 400 since baked potatoes were also on the menu.  This recipe is well-deserving of its high rating.  I'd give it a 10 if I could!!

I have made this for two years with rave reviews and realized I never rated it!  I make sure I saute the onions before adding but other than that I make it per the recipe.  My family loves it and so have the multiple people I've forwarded the recipe to.

I've merged the ingredients of this recipe with the ingredients of the Cheeseburger Meatloaf recipe (also on this site).  My husband loves the cheesy center.  It keeps the meat moist.  I like the sweetness of the brown sugar.  Both are good recipes.

I thought this recipe was really good. I'm not to fond on having sweet w/ salty so I only put 1/4 cup of brown sugar and half of the ketchup and it still came out sweet. But I didn't think there was enought seasoning so I added my own to give it a little more flavor. Other than that, it was pretty good and my family enjoyed it.

My first time making meatloaf...and it was awesome!  I use ground turkey instead of beef and it's great.  We love this meatloaf so much, we have it every couple of weeks (I'm making it again tonight)!  Thank you!!

This meatloaf is a kid pleaser! I followed a few of the previous suggestions and omitted the milk and cut back a bit on the brown sugar.  I used club crackers instead of saltines because that is what I had on hand. The glaze is sweet but my kids loved it.

My mother-in-law put prunes in her meatloaf.  My husband likes his meatloaf that way, but I do not.  He took one bite of this and asked how I made the 'plum sauce' - he loved it.  Now I have a recipe that we both like sans prunes!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and cut the brown sugar in half and added worcestershire.  I also reduced the amount of milk (just mixed in a little at a time until I got the desired consistancy).  I'm looking forward to trying this recipe with some of the other suggested modifications.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Very good...we still like regular meatloaf but will rotate this one in.  It gets a little sweet at the end, next I won't use as much brown sugar.

This meatloaf is a kid pleaser.  However, I did make a few changes.  The milk makes the meat WAY too mushy, so I omitted that.  I also beat the eggs first before adding.  For the sauce, I omitted the ginger and used 1 tsp dry mustard instead.  You don't need to add much salt if you are using saltines so I cut that down.  The sauce is pretty sweet but that is what the kids like about it, I'm sure you could cut down the sugar and it would still be good.  Thanks for the recipe.

Great and wonderful tasting meatloaf! I omitted the milk as suggested by other reviewers and didn't add the ginger because I just don't like the taste of ginger.  And I used italian bread crumbs instead of crackers becuased I used what i had on hand.  Thanks for the great recipe!

We thought this was good but not great.  I'm not sure I care for ginger in my meatloaf.  Glaze was delicious, though, and sliced very well for sandwiches.  I will continue the search for a great meatloaf recipe that my family loves.

The taste is good. I did not have load pan. It is tough to roll it on the other pan. I had to use less ingredient. for example, skipped milk. I also add some other dry ingredient , such as bread crumb, basil, garlic. It was the best meatloaf I ever have. My BF said it taste good too. Thank you, Starbuck.

The meatloaf mixture was pretty good but overall it was way too sweet. I even cut the brown sugar down to 1/4 cup. I think it'd be better if you lightly sprinkle some brown sugar in with the ketchup.

This was the best meatloaf I have had in a long time.  I didn't have any ginger, though, and I suspect that would add a new dimension of flavor.  Also i sauted the onions before adding.  Yum!  You may want to add the milk last, as I didn't use a full 3/4 cup.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Good Meatloaf!  The kids loved the Ketchup and brown sugar sauce.  It's a regular family meal now. We like to have it with mashed potatoes,  the meatloaf sauce, and some greens(cold or hot). Excellente'

Good stuff!  I modified the recipe with suggestions from other reviewers.  I used turkey instead of beef, cut the milk in half, used onion soup mix instead of chopped onion, swapped crackers with bread crumbs, cut the salt, and added chopped garlic to the meat, as well was worchestershire sauce (I also splashed this into the ketchup sauce).  The ginger added a great taste to the meat.  Will definately make again.

This is a great recipe! The ketchup and brown sugar sauce at the bottom is a great change from simple ketchup. My husband ALWAYS requests this, even if we just had it two days before.

I didn't care too much for this recipe. The meatloaf just tasted like ground beef. However, I did like the sweetness of the brown sugar with the ketchup. I will probably find another meatloaf recipe and try the glaze on that.

For my very first meatloaf ever, it was pretty easy to make. I would definately add the ketchup/brown sugar mix at the end next time, since it seemed to just make the bottom of the meat nasty after you refridgerate it. Good though!

I made this last night and I agree that while good, it was too sweet. Next time I will reduce brown sugar to 1/4 cup and mix with ketchup and worchester sauce and put on TOP!!  Maybe adding a few strips of bacon on top too!

Much too sweet.  I'm assuming that the meatloaf is to be inverted to a platter before serving, but, as others have said, this is not an easy process...quite messy.  I don't think I'll make this one again.

This was really easy, and very tasty, though I prefer it without the grond ginger. 

Instead of baking in a loaf pan, I formed the meat mixture into a log, topped it with the ketchup/brown sugar mixture and baked it in a baking dish, uncovered.

Simple recipe, easy to follow, that is packed full of taste.  The brown sugar is a great touch.  I followed to the T with the exception of a little parsley to make it pop.  I think I will take the advice of other reviewers and add brown sugar and ketchup near the end of the cooktime.  This is much better than the meatloaf I grew up on.  It’s now in my book of keepers.

For years I haven't eaten meatloaf because honestly I don't like it.  However, I wasn't in the mood to cook anything elaborate one evening and decided a meatloaf would be quick and simple.  Surprisingly, I actually enjoyed eating this meatloaf...  I don't believe it deserves a full 5 stars, but it's definitely worth trying this recipe!  My only recommendation would be to make more of the ketchup/brown sugar mixture... delicious!

It tasted like plain, old meatloaf with a brown sugar glaze. I didn't particularly care for it, but my dog licked the plate clean.  Thanks.  I'll use my tried and true recipe.

Great change up on the meatloaf.  I make a mean one anyway, but I thought I would try this for a little variety.  I have a 3 & 5 year old who cleaned their plates.  The taste is wonderful.  I'm adding this one to the rotation. Thanks

Excellent.  I was a little hesitant, thinking the sweetness would be too much.  That is not the case.  My 1 year old and 7 year old gobbled it up.  It even made great leftover meatlof sandwiches.

This is the best meatloaf my husband and I have ever had. I'm not much of a cook, but after this dish, my husband thinks I am.

This was awesome!! My husband is not a big meatloaf fan but he loved it.  This is by far the best I've had.  I loved the sweet and tangy.  I added about a tsp. of minced garlic .  I for sure will add this to my favorites!!

Incredible. I think next time (and there will definately be a next time) I will add a little less ginger. Even my picky four year old went back for seconds! Thanks!

Very good, but waay too sweet for our taste.  Maybe it's because I followed some reviews and added the sugar and ketchup on top also.  I will definitely make again, but with a lot less sugar.

Made this last night for my husband and said it was 'delicious.' He's not a big eater but he went back for seconds! Followed the recipe to a "t" but added a 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder. Wonderful. Moist and tasty: you won't be sorry you tried it!!

I like this meatloaf recipe! It was good, I was scared when adding the sugar on the bottom of the pan but it did work out at the end.  My 9 year old son liked it. My husband however said he was not crazy about the "ketchup" sauce. He does not like sweet sauces on his food so I did not tell him that I had added brown sugar, but he ate it all. I will probably make it again maybe cut the sugar back to 1/3 of a cup? I used 93% lean meat and it was not greasy at all.  Also, I cooked it 1 hour and 30 minutes becasue I don't like any pink on my meat.

Yummy! Very sweet. I put half the sauce on the bottom and half on top and used bread crumbs in place of crackers.

I didn't like it at all, but others did a bit more, so I will give it 2 stars.  Though it was not their favorite they actually ate theirs.  I though the texture was gross and the flavor was nothing.  The brown sugar and ketchup was what caught my eye with this recipe and yet it did nothing for the meatloaf itself.  I will NOT be mking this again.

The family loved it.  I'll make it again but, from now on, I won't use a silicone loaf pan!  What should have been done in an hour took 90 minutes plus microwave time.

The best meatloaf I've ever tasted! Even better than my father's but shhh, if you don't tell him, I won't! It was sweet, but not overpowering, or boring like others. I will continue to make this time and time again. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

This is a great base recipe for meatloaf!  I haven't made many meatloaves, but this one turned out great!  I did add a few of my own seasonings, and as other reviewers suggest, I put the brown sugar and ketchup on the top of the meatloaf instead of the bottom.  It was very moist and delicious! I served it for Christmas dinner and everyone just raved about it!

This was delicious.  It was a perfect combination of sweet and tangy....Was great with "smashed potatoes"
However, my husband threw a fit over this...When he saw me putting brown sugar in the pan he absolutely refused to eat it, he was adamant that he only likes my boring old meatloaf.
Suggestion....Never let them see the ingredients, only the finished product...Especially if your husband is as PICKY as mine!

WOW what an awesome meatloaf!!!

I ussually make the loaf, but mine are constantly falling apart.  Hubby decided to make it and it turned out awesome.  So I tried it and got the same fab results.

This is fantastic and our new permanent meatloaf recipe.

THIS MEATLOAF WAS WONDERFUL. I DID ADD SOME GREEN PEPPER, WHICH TURNED OUT GREAT. MY BOYFRIEND SAID THAT HE LIKES MY FIRST MEATLOAF RECIPE, UNTIL HE TASTED THIS ONE. I DID ALSO REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF BROWN SUGAR SO THE TASTE WAS NOT TOO SWEET. I WILL BE MAKING THIS MEATLOAF AGAIN.

This has become the only meatloaf I make! My husband loves it. The sweet glaze over this falvorful loaf is what makes it. This is one of very few recipes I dont feel like I have to alter in the least.

I made this recipe about a month ago and made 4 loaves and froze them.  We have had one each week and everybody looks forward to meatloaf night. My daughter has always hated meatloaf but loves this recipe.  I added mushrooms and shredded cheese to the recipe.  I also substituted ½ ground pork and ½ ground beef for the meatloaf.  I didn't have any ginger when I made it so I omitted it.  We put the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom and top of the meatloaf and don't think it is too sweet.  Maybe we just have excessive sweet tooths.

I really don't like meatloaf, but this was GREAT! I chopped up a large sweet red pepper and some extra onion and mixed it and to add some health to the  mix and it was great. I will definitely be doing this one again.

This recipe is excellent...everyone I serve it to loves it, even those who "don't like meatloaf".  I found that by adding mashed potatos and shredded chedder cheese on top of the meatloaf with about 10-15 minutes left to cook compliments it perfectly!

Wow! Never made a meatloaf and boy was this a good one! I'll definitely make this again. I was scared of the brown sugar, but it made the best glaze for the meatloaf. Hats off to you Starbuck--great recipe!

This is a very unique but tasty approach to meatloaf. I don't have a huge sweetooth but this was still quite good. Definitely eliminates the need to use ketsup as a condiment! I would definitely make this again.

As I am English and have never had meatloaf this seemed a good starting point.  My husband and I liked it, the kids hated it.  Halved the sugar but still thought it was a bit sweet.  Will do this again though with even less sugar.

This recipe was fantastic. I left out the onions because the kids don't like them, but they LOVED this meatloaf. I got a "hands down, best EVER". Even the picky 7 year old loved it. My boyfriend liked it a lot, but he prefers traditional meatloaf. I prepared as the recipe called for except for the onions and I drizzled some brown sugar and ketchup on the top. To serve, I sliced it and strained the liquid from the pan over it which made a delicious gravy. Thanks so much for this recipe! It's a keeper!

I don't like meatloaf, but this took the cake!!  It was great!  I broiled it at the end to give it a crusty top layer, and added garlic salt/powder just because I LOVE garlic!!!  My husband loved it as well.

Pretty good, but a tad bland.  I drained off the extra drippings about half-way through..and then sliced the loaf into 3 sections to help it cook more consistently

Great stuff! I think I might use half the brown sugar next time and see how it turns out.

Now this is the way I like it! I slightly modified the recipe, using 1/2 cup milk, club crackers, dried minced onion and approx. 1/3 cup brown sugar with 1/2 cup ketchup & 2 tablespoons of mustard for the glaze (no ginger). Baked for 1 1/2 hrs.  A definite keeper.  Thanks!!!

Excellent recipe!!  My boyfriend and I both loved it....we will try with half the amount of sugar next time to see if it'll still be as good with less sugar. I passed this recipe on to my mother who said that she and my father both loved it too!  Thanks for sharing it.

Fabulous!  I usually make the traditional Lipton Onion Soup meatloaf (which we enjoy) but this was just yummy :) My husband, who rarely likes anything new, raved!  The only change I made was that I used italian bread crumbs instead of saltines.  Definately not too sweet.  Be prepared for the ketchup, brown sugar  and juices to form a sauce in the bottom of the pan.  Just scoop it over the top  of the loaf & enjoy!

This recipe wasn't very good.  I took the suggestions of several reviewers and cut down on the brown sugar.  While the sweetness didn't bother me, it was still not cooked even after adding an extra 15 minutes to the cooking time and was quite "wet".  Will not be making again.

Sweet Meat?  This didn't go over as well as I had hoped.  I usually make my meatloaf with onion soup mix, and I thought this would be a nice change.  I guess I'll stick with sugar-free.

My husband and I both liked the meatloaf, however he found the brown sugar & ketchup mixture on the bottom to be too sweet. He said he would like me to make it again, but to just cut down on the brown sugar.

My family LOVED this meatloaf! I didn't follow the recipe exactly, and it turned out very well.
I didn't put the brown sugar or ketchup on the bottom of the pan, I combined them and used it as a glaze on top.  I didn't have any ginger on hand, so I just left it out, and instead of using saltine crackers, I used 3/4 cup of italian seasoned bread crumbs.

This recipe was pretty good, I will probably make it on accasion when I want something different besides my normal meatloaf. I definately think this was just a little too sweet, will try and cut back on the sugar next time. My kids ages 7 and 6 to my surprise did not care for it.

This is an awesome meatloaf. I never follow recipes exactly but I decided I would with this one. The brown sugar was scary but I did it anyway. It actually dissolves and cooks up, around and over the top of the meatloaf giving it wonderfully mellowed taste. Not sweet, really. It might replace that honeybaked ham that I have on Thanksgiving! Nah...

I will not use this recipe again. I followed the recipe as offered on this website and was astounded that it called for a half cup of packed brown sugar.  This recipe should have been offered as a dessert, not a main course. Even if I were to reduce the amount of brown sugar, or omit it alltogether, this recipe would not be a "keeper."

This meatloaf was absolutely wonderful! I didn't have any ginger on hand, so I omitted that. I also used bread crumbs instead of saltines because I didn't have any of those either. This meatloaf was moist and very flavorful. My husband asks for seconds on this one (that's rare!). I will definitely use this recipe very often. Thanks, Starbuck, for such a great recipe!

This turned out better than I thought it would....very tasty.  I used 1tsp of ginger and pepper and sprinkled brown sugar and ketchup on top midway through baking time.  The family ate it up.

This is the worst meatloaf I have eaten in my entire 65 years on this earth. My husband is a meatloaf lover and he did not even like it.  It had no flavor and was too dense. The only way he could eat it was to make a sandwich with hot mustard.  I was attracted to the recipe by the brown sugar but that did not even help.

Starbuck, you are a genius!  I don't even like meat, but with all the stars your recipe garnered, I had to try it. Fantastic!  I've made it many times now, always with ground chicken or turkey.  Makes my mouth water just thinkin' about it!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Sorry I just do not like this meatloaf.  I have tried this recipe several times-trying various suggestions offered by others to improve the taste.  It just doesn't do much for me or my family/  Sorry.

Followed recipe exactly and it turned out pretty good.  I am not usually a big meat loaf fan but if you put enough sugar and ketchup on anything it should taste good.

MMMMmmm so good! I had never had meatloaf (I know, hard to believe) let alone make it. This was SO easy and tasted wonderful - even the next day! I will definitely use this as a base for future meat loaf (maybe a healthier version with elk or buffalo meat and different spices). YUM

Why I am reviewing this when it already has 1180 good reviews?  It was that good!  I LOVE meatloaf, and this is one of my two favorite recipes.  The brown sugar and ketchup give it a great sweet-and-sour balance.  Great comfort food!

this is the best meatloaf I've ever made; the only change I make is to use cheap store-bought bread crumbs instead of saltine crackers, mostly for convenience. and sometimes I'll add a little minced shallot. we have this meatloaf, along with garlic mashed potatoes and a salad, about once a week in winter!

I don't eat meatloaf often, but this meatloaf was the best I've ever tasted. The only thing about it took a while to cook. I left out the ginger. I had to pour some of the fat from the ground beef out before I could serve it. Other than that, definitely a recipe I will make again! ;]

This was okay, maybe a little sweet.It was moist and did make for a good sandwich the next day. I'll have to keep hunting for a better meatloaf.

Perfect meatloaf everytime! I've improvised with Ritz crackers, half & half, egg whites.... still came out fine. Although the original recipe is the best. My fiance said to me (after his second serving), "Make this again babe". Does it get much better than that? Thanks!!

This meatloaf recipe is very good. I baked it on a broiler pan like someone else suggested and it turned out very good. The meat held together well and it wasn't mushy or greasy like when baked in a loaf pan. I will be using this recipe from now on. Thank you Starbuck!

great meatloaf, came out of the pan perfect, was very pretty. Alittle to sweet for our taste so will cut down on the brown sugar next time, but to each their own. Still loved it.

This is a great recipe.  My husband keeps asking for it. I followed the recipe the 1st time and it was good.  The second time I subsituted oatmeal for the crushed crackers and I also combined the brown sugar and katchup to make a paste.  The layered technique didn't work well for us.  Awesome recipe... I think the ginger is a great touch.

I was surprised to hear a reviewer state that this wasn't juicy. The brown sugar and ketchup blended nicely at the bottom and gave a nice topper for extra juice on the meatloaf and the white rice we had on the side. My husband and children loved this. I don't usually go up for seconds, but I did with this meatloaf.

Great recipe!  I am not a big fan of meat loaf or beef for that matter but this loaf was excellent.  I liked the melding of the brown sugar and ketchup which gave this meat loaf a nice twist!  Thanks!

I made this meatloaf this week, and both my fiance and I loved it.  It's simple to put together, but is very different from other meatloaves that I've made.  I'll definitely make this again!

This was very good. I made it according to the directions except for the cooking time. I like meat very well done so I cooked it for 1 hour and 40 minutes. After making it in a loaf pan, I put it in a caserole dish and poured the gravy on top and served it. Family enjoyed. Will make again!

I have been making this recipe for years.  The only thing I do different is put the glaze on the top.  I also mix up extra glaze and microwave it just before serving for dipping.

Best meatloaf EVER!  At times I make this without double-checking my saltines supply and I've had great luck using both bread crumbs and cornflakes as well.  My husband now races home when he hears that it's meatloaf night!!

Very good!  Lots of flavored juice!  I used 2 1/2 pds of ground beef and made two loaf size meatloafs.  I cooked one for 45 minutes and then froze it and the other cooked for 1 hour and ate that night.  I also include 1/2 cup of chopped carrots.

This has become a staple in our house.  I use chili sauce instead of ketchup to give it more flavor.

My mom's only criticism was that I didn't cut the onions small enough. I didn't like having the ketchup on the bottom. When I fix it again I will put the ketchup on top 10 minutes before it's done so it'll get a little color. The brown sugar taste is awesome.

I usually make a spicy meatloaf but I think this is our new favorite.  The sweetness of the brown sugar was very tasty.  I did reduce the amount of brown sugar on the bottom, but it was still delicious.

Great taste but i would recommend doubling the sauce for the top.  Just not enough flavor when only on the bottom.

This is my favorite recipe from all that I've tried on allrecipes.com. My husband says I make better meatloaf than his mom. If you like meatloaf, I think this one is it! I use ground beef that is just 4% fat & it's excellent.

Just okay, it wasn't to my husbands taste. He still remembers his Mama's meatloaf from home. Sure wish I could ask her, however she's gone. I thought it was okay he didn't have but one piece.

This is an excellent meatloaf recipe and it always turns out when I make it (which is saying a lot considering I don't usually have the greatest luck with meatloaf).  My family enjoys meatloaf, but mine almost always turns out too dry.  This recipe is delicious and it makes for a very moist loaf.  I never have to make any gravy on the side to try and disguise any dryness.  Thanks!

My family thought this was a great recipe.  Slight change from the traditional meatloaf. I didn't have ginger on hand, so I left it out. I also put a bit less brown sugar as others have mentioned. Some recipes can go overboard on the "filler".  This amount was great.  Thanks!

This recipe was so good! My picky husband ate 3 helpings of it!! With 3 of us, it was gone. I couldnt believe it. I followed the recipe exactly and would only do one thing.. add more saltine crackers. It was almost perfect, but I will add maybe almost double what it called for. YUM, try this. I hate meatloaf and loved this. Its just sweet enough, doesnt even taste like meatloaf!!

I don't know what happened to my meatloaf since this got so many great reviews, but this wasn't very appealing to us.  Maybe it was just too much sugar, I really don't know but it was good idea it just didn't work in this house.

I have always liked meatloaf but this is definatly the best I've ever had. The only change I make is I use half turkey just to make it a little juicier. I also love how the ketchup and brown sugar are on the bottom so I can spoon it onto my plate. Very good!! Makes a good party dish!

This meatloaf had a good taste, but the topping/sauce was kind of clump in the bottom of the pan. I think I would keep the recipe for the meatloaf, but skip putting the brown sugar and ketchup in the bottom of the pan.

Definitely a winning recipe.  My only problem was I didn't have a loaf pan, so I tried to do a makeshift one with foil in a 13x9 pan by forming it into a loaf shape, but the brown sugar/ketchup kind of ran everywhere.  So at the end, in a bowl I mixed more brown sugar and ketchup and spread it over the top, baked for 15 mins, broiled for about 2 and it came out perfect (we like saucy meatloaf anyway).

Sweet, but good. It was an interesting twist to an old dish. Not a favorite with the husband, though, bucause he did not want a SWEET meatloaf sandwhich with leftovers. Needless to say, the leftovers did not get eaten.

This was pretty good but a little sweet for me.  My family thought it was okay, but weren't begging me to make more.  Maybe we just aren't big meatloaf fans.  Still, thanks for the different ideas.

This was so yummy! My husband hates meatloaf and when he saw I was making one it got mad at me. But I said this is a new recipe try it. He did and actually had seconds! YAY! I love meatloaf. Finally one I can make my husband will eat too.

Meatloaf is such a hard dish to prepare and make everyone happy. Usually someone doesn't like something about it and it never comes out the same twice? Well this recipe is wonderful and everyone loved it. Finally after 35 yrs of making meatloaf i got one right!! This is a keeper for the next 45 years!

This recipe was fabulous.  My husband doesn't like meat that is sweet so I was a little nervous about fixing it, but he loved it.  I used 1/2 cup of Honey Barbecue sauce instead of ketchup and 3/4 cup seasoned bread crumbs instead of saltine cracker crumbs.  Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful recipe.  I will never have to worry about my meatloaf turning out good anymore.  Thank You! Thank You!

WOW!  Meatloaf is my husband's favorite, and something I hate, so I came searching here for a good recipe.  This is so easy and really is very tasty.  I substituted dry mustard for the ginger.  I"m not a huge ketchup fan, so I substitued some A-1 sauce for about 1/2 the ketchup.  Yummy, easy, and husband loves it!

This was wonderful! We scaled it down for 1 pound of hamburger meat. Instead of chopped onion (which we were out of), we used onion powder. Sweet and savory - every bite melts! :)

excellent recipe.  I also added garlic to meatloaf and I also used 1 pd lean ground beef and 1/2 pd RB Rice medium sausage.  I put a little sauce on the bottom and then put the rest on the top--needless to say no meatloaf left.

This didn't turn out well for me.  There was too much milk, so it didn't flip over with the nice ketchup brownsugar top. But maybe I didn't use enough meat.  I guestimated it.  The meat tasted good though.

My family loves meat loafs, but they loved this one very very...much. First question was:” What did you put in?" I used BBQ-sauce instead of ketchup- gave extra flavor. Brown sugar made amazing difference.For sure will make more!

Good Meatloaf. I did however make a few changes I replaced the milk with a half cup of ketchup, used dry seasoned bread crumbs, and added a half tsp. of ground ginger. For the glaze I cut back on the sugar and added a dash of prepared mustard, it wasnt too sweet at all and I might try it with the full amount next time.

very tasty meatloaf, I think having the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom lets  the flavour boil into the loaf and I found the  pan easier to clean.

I don't usually make meatloaf because it's never been much of a hit with my family. I threw this together as a quick meal, and it was SO delicious. We all loved it, including the kids. It was so easy to make, and had so much flavor. I added some bread crumbs to the mixture, and it was still so moist and delicious. I'll definitely be making this again. Thanks so much for sharing!

My little 5 year old helped me make this one so it might not have been quite like it should have been.  He added milk without me there and we were a little short on the burger (only had 1.12 lbs instead of 1.5).  It turned out okay, the kids wouldn't eat it but the honey said it had great flavor.

This is a little too sweet, but the meat turned out tender. I think next time all try using less brown sugar and ginger, or just use another sauce.

I always intend on making this to have dinner for 2 nights, but unfortunately, it never makes it to the second night.  Love the sweetness of it.  We sometimes add bbq sauce to it when it is served.

Absolutely loved the flavor.  Very moist.  I prefer a little bit more of a crisp texture, so next time I think I will add more saltines.

My boys loved this dish.  I mixed Turkey & ground beef together and added a little more crackers, and corn into the meat mixture, but it turned out great!  Will make again, and again.

This meatloaf is pretty good, but I'm going to continue the quest for the best meatloaf.  I thought it could have used a little more flavor.

4.5 Wow it was good. My son can't eat onions so I made a smaller portion without onions and the rest with them. Everyone agreed it was at least a 4 but hesitated to say 5. So it is 4.5. I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be fine.

Mmmmmm! Tasted even better than my mom's recipe!!  I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup, cut the milk to 1/2 cup, and used an entire cup of saltines instead of just 3/4.  Turned out delicious!  Thanks for this awesome recipe.

This was not at all as expected. It was way too sweet and didn't taste like a meatloaf at all! My husband and 3 year old wouldn't eat it. Not even as leftovers.

Yummy. My sixteen year old says it's a keeper. We loved the brown sugar glaze...just the right amount of tangy and sweet. I will cut back on the milk (to 1/2 cup) and maybe increase the cracker crumbs (Townhouse) because I use 1/2 lean turkey and 1/2 lean ground beef and I think the turkey usually needs a bit of "firming" when I use it in recipes.

This is the best meatloaf I've ever eaten. It has a wonderful sweetness to it and it's very easy to make.  My husband is frightenly obsessed with it.  It's always mysteriously gone by the next morning. (He makes midnight trips to the kitchen and eats it cold out of the refrigerator!) Thanks for a great recipe!  I just got through making it a 4th or 5th time.

A very good, traditional meatloaf recipe. We liked this a lot in our house. If you enjoy this, also check out the "Little Meat Loaves" on this site--similar sweet sauce on top, and a nice presentation for company.

This is a great recipe for meatloaf.  I made it because of all the great reviews and am so glad that I did.  I did reduce the brown sugar by half and put the put the sauce over the loaf before baking.  I will definitely make this again.

Hubby loved this meatloaf. I followed the advice of other revieweers and decreased the brown sugar to 1/4 C and decreased the milk to a 1/4 C as well. The meatloaf turned out very moist and delicious. The sauce culd probably still stand to decrease the brown sugar even more. Also, I did find that I had a lot of grease in the loaf pan when it was done cooking so I spooned as much of that out as possible. We will definitely make it again though.

Took others advice and lowered brown sugar amount.  If you like sweet meat, you'll love this. Little too sweet for our taste, but loved the consistency of the meatloaf, it stayed together nicely.  (However I listened to everyone and only used a little milk.

This meatloaf was awesome! I grew up hating meatloaf..but decided to give it another chance because my husband really likes it.  His exact words after he finished eating were "That was outstanding, you have to make that again."  Even my picky 3 year old daughter who never eats anything gobbled this up.  Thank you, this recipe is a keeper.  In fact I have already added it to my recipe box!

I usually use the "Easy Meatloaf" recipe from this site. This was a nice change! We still prefer the other but this has pretty good taste too! The ginger really gives it good flavor. The sugar/ketchup mixture was barely noticed and very lean meat is necessary as I did not have very lean meat and the pan was almost filled to the top with grease while cooking.

This was very good.  We never had meatloaf growing up so I wasn't sure if I was going to like it or not.  I didn't have a loaf pan so I patted the meat mixture into an 8" square pan.  I used ground round and did not think it was too greasy.  Thank you, Starbuck!

I thought it was about time I rated this after using it for about a year.  It is yummy and the best meatloaf ever!  I double the recipe and freeze portions of it for my husband and I.  In doubling the recipe I can get 6-7 meals out of it for the two of us.  We did not like meatloaf until I tried this one.

I thought the meatloaf was excellent.  However, my husband, who does not like sweet sauces or fruits with meat, did not like this recipe very much.  I also cooked the meat for 1 hour and 10 minutes, rather than the hour called for in the recipe.

Well, when I first saw the Brown Sugar meat loaf i really wasnt going to make it. Brown sugar and meat didnt seem like it would mix well or even taste good.Then I saw the reviews so I decided i would try it. Well it was awesome. The absolute BEST meat loaf i have ever had. It wasnt too sweet and it had a nice taste to it. If I could give more than 5 stars I could. Its definitly different but very very good.!! 2 thumbs up!! thanks for the recipe!!!!!!!!!

This was wonderful.  I used a mixture of beef, pork and veal (gasp! my mother brought it) and everyone loved it.  Instead of baking it in a loaf pan, i shaped it on a flat pan, and covered it with the ketchup and just half of the brown sugar and it worked out fine, and in my opinion sweet enough.

This, I have to say, is probably the only meatloaf recipe I will use from now on.  I didn't think it was too sweet at all.. I LOVED it, as did my husband.  The ginger adds an interesting and unexpected (but very pleasant!)kick.  Very moist and tasty.  If you like food with flavor, you will love this one.

This is a great easy meatloaf.  Test the amount of brown sugar you want.  I usually use a 1/4 cup intsead of 1/2 it makes a difference.  This is a great dish.

Comments like, 'This is the best meatloaf I've ever had' are what I hear everytime I make this for someone. The use of fresh ginger is key to this great dish.

ok I have to admit I made a mistake.  I wrote the ingredients down and was making it with my daughter and instead of putting brown sugar and ketchup on bottom of pan I added it all together.  But I thought it was terrific and 4 kids agreed.  Kinda sweet but very good.

This is the only way I will make meat loaf ever again!  My family can't get enough.  I even ate the left overs, which I NEVER do!  I did take the advise of some others and put the brown sugar mixture on top.  I also put my meatloaf on a broil pan so that all of the juices fell to the bottom and my meatloaf didn't soak up all of the grease.  I will be making this again for sure!

A good recipe, but we prefer a little less of a sweet topping.  Definitely brown "sugar" meatloaf as this is the overwhelming flavor. Thanks, though.

Looks very pretty when turned out onto a serving platter, great presentation for when you have company.  The brown sugar/ketchup combo tastes great on this tasty meatloaf.

Wow, this was amazingly tasty! I didn't have saltines, so I used crushed Ritz crackers, and I added some cubed Cheddar cheese to the mix.  I put the sugar and kethup mix on the top and it was fantastic!!

I made this last night and it was great. It was my first meatloaf ever. Next time I will use onion powder instead of one small onion. I will also mix a little ketchup with the ground beef to give it more tomato flavor. Definitely a keeper.

DELICIOUS!  I usually have to cover my meatloaf all over with ketchup because it tastes like boring hamburger, this meatloaf with great!  I changed it up a little with onion soup mix and italian bread crumbs instead of crackers and left out the salt.  Onion soup mix is salty enough.  I also only use 1/3 cup brown sugar and mixed half the sauce in with the meatloaf.  The sauce is great I think I will make extra next time!  Thanks so much!

Holy cow, this was fantastic! I made a slight change - I was feeding quite the horde (6 children and 3 adults) so I used 1 1/2lbs 93% lean beef and a 1lb roll of maple sausage. I put in a bunch of onion powder instead of onions (my kids hate onions, and can even detect cooked onions in food), otherwise I followed the recipe exactly, just adjusting quantities to make 1 1/2 recipes. My friend's kids all cleaned their plates and had seconds, and her daughters never eat all their food. Even my friend ate a big piece, and we usually have to fight to get her to eat much of anything. My husband was upset there wasn't more of it! So this was an all around hit with children and adults. I did make sure to let it sit for a few minutes after I took it out of the oven, then turned the loaves out on a platter so the glaze ended up on top and dripped down the sides. My friend was even dipping her tator tots in the ketchup/brown sugar glaze on the platter. I'll have to make this frequently!

I loved this-My boyfriend said it was okay...but his opinion doesn't count since he doesn't like meatloaf!!!  I modified slightly..Used maybe 1/4 cup milk, breadcrumbs and added ketchup to the meatloaf mix...Added the brownsugar/ketchup mix to the top during the last 25 minutes...I used a larger pan so cooking was cut to about 40 minutes!!  Great recipe...Thanks for sharing!

I’m sorry, but I guess I’m totally going against the grain on this one. I was looking for a different twist to put on my meatloaf so I thought I would try this recipe. I did not find this meatloaf to be anything special. My husband will pretty much eat anything I put in front of him, and he didn’t even like this. It was just too sweet! I wont be making this again.

This is the best meatloaf I have ever eaten!  I took the advice of other reviewers and I cut the brown sugar to 1/3 cup.  I think I will cut it down to 1/4 cup next time.  I also did not put the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom, I molded the meatloaf in my pan (13x9) and I patted the brown sugar on the top and sides and then I put the ketchup on top of that. I think I will cut it down to 1/4 cup next time.  Instead of chopped onion I used Lipton Beef & Onion soup mix.  Instead of saltine cracker crumbs I used the same amount of quick cooking oats.  I only used about 1/4 cup of milk.

My husband made this and it turned out great. Unfortunately, he's one of those people that when a recipe calls for..say.. one cup of cheese, he'll add two. With cheese...that's fine. But he added more brown sugar on the top than was called for. My advise..do not do this. Follow the recipe. This recipe offers a unique twist to meatloaf. Very moist. Tasty. We all liked it even with the extra brown sugar we had to scrape off the top when the ingredient maverick wasn't looking. Hubby is the meatloaf man. He LOVES meatloaf and has tried it all kinds of ways. He really liked this recipe but admits he should not have added so much to the top. We'll make it again...following the recipe this time.

This meatloaf was all right but it didn't impress me too much.  The meatloaf had a funny flavor to it which I think had to do with the brown sugar.  I really like trying new recipes but this is one that I probably won't make again.

My husband loves meatloaf, I unfortuately don't, this was surprisingly good to me.  My husband and kids all really liked it as well.  I didn't change anything and probably won't.  It's now a recipe card in my files.  Thanks for submitting it.

We LOVE this meatloaf!!  I have passed it on to several friend and they all love it too. I do use a turkey baster and baste the top of it a couple of times with the juices so the sweet taste goes all the way through.  I have also cooked it in the microwave and it comes out very moist and cooks in less than half the time.

This is very yummy. Sweet, but not too sweet. Just right. I will certainly do it again, follow the recipe to the T, but use dried onion flakes, cause my picky husband picks on the onions! I think my toddler might have thought a little too spicy, that's cause I added extra ginger and pepper, but there's no need for it, cause the catchup already has spices in it.

This is by far the best tasting meatloaf I have ever had!!! I used 1 lb ground beef and 1/2 lb ground pork and substitued 1 package onion soup mix for the onion and I also put the brown sugar/ketchup glaze on top and bottom!!! It was not overly sweet and it had the best texture of any meatloaf I have ever made!! My husband even said "Don't throw this recipe away!!!"  Definitely a keeper for this family!!!

Very good recipe.  I usually hate meatloaf, but I love making this.  My meat always comes out swimming in juices, though.  I thought it was grease, but the second time I made this I used 92% lean beef, and it was the same.  I wonder what causes this...

I really liked this recipe. It calls for putting the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom as apposed to putting it on the top the way we have always done it...I liked doing it this way better. I used dried minced onion and add a handfull of some chopped bell pepper to this and it was good!

this meatloaf is way too sweet for us. It was the worst I've ever made, and won't try this one again. My husband could taste it for days. :( My kids wouldn't touch it after one bite, either!

This recipe was delicious. I couldn't believe how moist the meat was. I did use bread crumbs in place of crackers--still amazing. Big hit with the husband!! A nice alternative to boring meatloaf.

this recipe was great!, but only if you think you'd like a sweet meatloaf.

i also added the brown sugar and ketchup to the top of the meatloaf as suggested.  none of it came out sticky though, more like a nice sauce that was put over rice.  but then again i sprayed pam on the bottom too.  i also used just regular bread crumbs as i didn't have the saltines.

next time i will fry up the onion as well as i found the onions to be crunchy in the meatloaf and i prefer more soft onions.  and there definitly needs to be a little bit more salt and pepper as it was missing some sort of punch.  maybe some more ginger as well?.

This recipe is unbelievable.  I've already made this receipe several times and it always comes out perfect.  I use extra lean ground beef, add extra ginger, and add ketchup on top of the meatloaf before putting it in the oven.  This one is def. a keeper.  I already have a request to make it again.  Thanks Starbuck!

Well, I'm going against the majority on this one, but I just didn't like it. Boyfriend thought it was too sweet, but still ate it, I only had a couple bites. Will have to keep hunting for a meatloaf recipe, sorry!

In order to honestly rate a recipe I make it as written, and sorry, but this was really a disappointment.  The sauce was very sweet, but the loaf itself lacked flavor, and was very bland.  I found the texture of the loaf very nice and may incorporte the saltine/milk combo again but will have to really work on the seasoning. The family prefers the onion soup box recipe.

My family loves this recipe!!!!  I have used it twice now, and had to look it up today when my daughter was begging me to make meatloaf for dinner.  We use ground turkey instead of ground beef, and it turns out great!  This recipe is SO GOOD!!!!!  I have now printed and saved it to my favorite recipe collection.

Nothing great meatloaf wise, and frankly WAY TOO SWEET!  The mixing of brown sugar and onions turned everyone at my dinner table off, and we LOVE meatloaf.

I really really hate to be the voice of dissension, but I wasn't too keen on this recipe. Perhaps it's a matter of personal preference, but I made this dish for my meatloaf-loving husband and didn't get the oohs and aahs I was hoping for.  I found the end result to be overly sweet and he gently suggested that we go back to our more traditional recipe. The loaf, however, had splendid form - it held its shape really well and smelt great.  Obviously, the recipe works well, it's just a question of taste.

I cut the beef down a little and used 1/2 lb of gr pork, and soup mix instead of onions. The meatloaf itself tasted great but greasy and the sauce was sweet and very, very sticky to my pan.

I'm not much of a meatloaf fan but I had to try this because of the comments.  It was good.  I liked the sweetness from the brown sugar.  Next time I might cut my onions into smaller chunks and use leaner meat.  I wondered are you supposed to dump meatloaf out to serve it or do you cut it in the pan?

This meatloaf was good, but not the best.  I guess I should have read the reviews.  I will try it again, but next time put the glaze on the TOP.  It was not that appetizing on the bottom with all of the grease from the ground beef.

Great recipe!  We didn't have saltine crackers so subsituted for bread crumbs instead.  I would suggest using a bit less brown sugar next time.  Thanks - tastes great!

The flavor was good but the visual wasn't.  It was very watery - had to pour off alot of juice.  I will probably keep searching for meatloaf recipes.

This was better than any meatloaf I've ever had!  I used dry onion soup mix instead of onions and it was fabulous.  Very moist and holds together well.  This is a new family favorite.  Can't wait to leave my mother-in-law speechless with this one!

I have been making this recipe for a few years now, and it's always delicious.  The brown sugar and ketchup make the perfect sauce with the juices while it cooks.  I always serve it over white rice and just pour the sauce all over.  It's soooo good!  Anytime I ask my husband what he wants me to cook, he always asks for this meatloaf.

Yum Yum Yum! I did add tomoato sauce to the meat mixture. My husband loved this and he is not a huge meatloaf fan.

I have never made meatloaf before this but I've wanted it for a while so my girlfriend and I decided to try it. The brown sugar makes it taste so great ... I just wanted to eat the bottom of the whole thing. Next time I may use less onions and mix a little brown sugar in the middle of the loaf.

This is flavorful, but it never seems to turn out as I'd imagined.  Both times it turned out mushy.  Am I doing something wrong?

I do not really like meat loaf.  However, my husband does and I tried this recipe and it was GREAT.  I added chopped green peppers and a little more brown sugar.  Will make this again.

This is great, I loved it!  Very similar to my own recipe.  I would have given it 5 stars but my husband still prefers mine better.  I didn't have saltines so I used fine bread crumbs instead.

Great meatloaf!  Makes wonderful leftovers for sandwiches.  I was in search for a recipe that could stand up to my favorite meatloaf (Cracker Barrel) and this did it for me!  I did add red and green peppers to it since I could taste those in Cracker Barrel's.  It came out YUMMY!

I love this meatloaf with modifications.  Omitted milk and ginger.  Subbed oatmeal for crackers.  Added tomato (1/4 canned, chopped or stewed) to meat and a little cider vinegar and prepared mustard.  Poured remaining tomatoes over meatloaf and a couple of cans of condensed tomato soup.  I like alot of sauce for mashed potatoes.  Great filling meal.

It was pretty good!  Next time I need to chop the onions up a bit finer, but overall the recipe turned out well.  My children and husband enjoyed it.  I will use this recipe again, but it probably will not be my exclusive.

This is the only meatloaf recipe I use now.  My husband and son absolutely love it!  When an 8 year old requests meatloaf for dinner, it must be good!  It's easy enough even for my husband to make when I work late.  Thank you so much for this recipe!!

Very moist meatloaf. A nice recipe of a classic, just nothing extra-special about it. This is definitely family fare and I will cook it again. But I'll continue searching for a meatloaf recipe that doesn't seem so much like... er, well... like MEATLOAF! :)

Very good, very easy, but too much brown sugar and ketchup so it becomes too saucy and takes longer than an hour to cook.  I reduced both and added more spices for flavor.  Great recipe!

This is a wonderful recipe. I mixed the ketchup and brown sugar right in with the meat instead of putting it on the bottom. My bad, I didn't read the entire recipe. I was in a hurry and just mixed all the ingredients together. It turned out quite tasty but fell apart in the middle. Next time I'll try the glaze at the bottom like the recipe suggests! Definitely a keeper!!

This meatloaf is one of favorites - I've been making it for a while now.  Sometimes, instead of layering the brown sugar and ketchup, I mix the two together and then lay it down into the pan.  Either way, the results are still fantastic.

Made meatloaf exactly like the recipe calls.  Guests and I loved it, however my fiance didn't like the sweetness.  I love it how it is, but I've made this meatloaf 5 times since, but modified for fiance...  Instead of katsup and brown sugar, I use 1 can cream of potato soup. Also left out onions.  Still a great meatloaf... better than I've had elsewhere.

Great meatloaf recipe...but it's still meatloaf so I could not give it full marks. I'd give it 4-3/4 stars if it were possible. Substituted oatmeal for crackers and ground bison for ground beef. One of the best meatloafs I've tasted. I'll make it again.

My husband is a picky eater and wasn't thrilled that I was trying out a new meatloaf recipe on him, but he really liked it.  I did use 2 pounds of meat, an extra egg, and a little less milk.  I took a previous suggestion and put sauce on top and bottom.  Good recipe - will make again.

I do not like meatloaf-never had a good one until now-made this for my husband-he loves meatloaf-this was outstanding!!!  I put the brownsugar and ketchup on the bottom-but sprinkled just a tiny bit on the top and swirled a little ketchup on, too.  We alway do lunch for out employees on Fridays so took the rest in with some bread and the guys went nuts.  Thank-you so much. Great Recipe.

I made this for the family the other night and they really liked it.  My girls aren't much into meatloaf so the sweetness added just the right type of flavor for the kids.  My husband thought it was good but he preferred the spicier kind of meatloaf.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was really good.  The only change I made was to press the brown sugar mixture onto the top instead of the bottom while it was baking. I think it would be good just mixed into the loaf itself as well.

Great recipe.  I'm not a meatloaf person, but I have to admit that this is really good.  Next time I will try cooking it covered because, even with all the liquid ingredients, it was a little dry to my taste.

Thank you so much for this recipe! It was absolutely the best meatloaf I have eaten.  My husband loved it as well, and I have vowed that it will be a regular on our menu.  I followed the recipe and didn't change a thing.  The brown sugar and ketchup created a wonderfully sweet, but not too sweet, glaze for this meatloaf.  It was even great cold in a sandwich the next day!
Thank you for submitting this excellent recipe!!

If you like sweet meatloaf, this is a good recipe.  I couldn't taste much of the ginger, however.  Next time I will add more. My single brother who doesn't cook much asked for the recipe!! He raved about it all the way through dinner.

My husband said this was the best meatloaf he has ever tasted.

I used Worsh. sauce as well and constantly basted it with its own juices.  I cannot believe how good this tasted.

The brown sugar and ketchup mixture added the final gourmet taste to it.

It was soooooo good!!!!!

I have been making this recipe for years. There's a part that was left out of it. I bake mine for about 45 minutes covered. I uncover it, and bake it for another 30 minutes, BASTING it every 4-5 minutes. It will
make a delicious thick glaze over the meatloat. Try it this way I'm sure you'll like it. Thats what makes it different from the rest of the meatloafs. ENJOY

This is a good recipe... although very sweet.  I added about 1/3 cup diced red bell pepper and 1 clove of garlic minced.  I will definetly make it again... when I'm in the mood for a sweet dinner!

Overall, great recipe with a touch of sweetness. I cut down the recipe and prepared as two individual loaves since I only cook for two people...and it still turned out great!  I also added some seasonings like garlic salt (instead of regular salt) and onion powder (BF doesn't care too much for chopped onions.) Even though I cooked it for an hour, it was slightly undercooked so I popped it in the micro to finish.  Thanks Starbucks for a great recipe!

Great meatloaf recipe!  This is definitely the best meatloaf I have had, and I am usually NOT a meatloaf fan.  I loved the sweet taste.  I put half the brown sugar/ketchup on top and half on bottom and it was perfect.  Use lean meat if you can, but if you still have grease, just pour it off at the end.  This will be the meatloaf recipe I use from now on.  Thank you!

Wellllll, this is comfort food at it finest!!!  It was lip-smacking!!  We all loved it!!  The only thing I changed was the crackers....I used crushed Ritz crackers as I was out of soda crackers.  The result was suh-weet!! The sauce was great over mashed potatoes, too. This is on my Must-make-again List!!

Wonderful recipe.  Extremely versatile and easy to make.  Leftovers are fabulous as sandwiches.  Sent it to Canada on a fishing trip to rave reviews.

Wow! I used to hate meatloaf as a kid but I saw this recipe and my curiosity got the best of me - LOVED IT! I substituted ground turkey instead of beef and it turned out spectacular!

I've made and had meatloaf dozens of way, but I have to say that this is the "best" meatloaf I've ever tried.  What a great twist to an old favorite family dinner.

The meatloaf itself in this recipe was good, but I didn't much care for the ketchup and brown sugar. It didn't taste bad, there was just to much of it (and I even used 1/3 cup of brown sugar instead of 1/2)

This has WAY too much sugar...I have never made meatloaf before ..however my husband has been asking me to make it.  I took this recipe because of the rating and knowing my husband has a sweet tooth!!  But I used ½ the required amount of sugar and we both still found it too sweet!!
I would make it again but with ¼ the amount of sugar if that much!

Great meatloaf. I mixed the brown sugar and ketchup together, made a little extra and put it on the bottom of the pan and also on top of the meatloaf; it was wonderful.

Excellent!  Took about 30 min longer to cook than the recipe guesstimated, for a total of 1.5 hours, but we used 2 lbs hamburger instead of 1.5 lbs.

A little too sweet for our taste, even when cutting back on the brown sugar, but overall very good, for meatloaf.

My family loves this recipe.  My husband hated meatloaf before I served him this one, and my five year old asks for it again and again.  The only change I made was I had to put it in a bigger pan as it wouldn't fit in my loaf pan, and I put the ketchup and brown sugar on the top.  Yum!  Thanks for this recipe!

This was a great recipe. The family loved it. I left out the ginger because I only like the taste in baked goods. I think it's pretty sweet, but that works better for the kids I guess!! Thanks for sharing!

I love this recipe!  It's so juicy and moist, even the leftovers are great!  I add a little barbecue sauce to the ketcup and it adds a tangy kick, it's fantastic...even my picky boyfriend loves it :)

This was a bit too sweet for my taste buds, and my husband thought it was 'OK'.  We like tomatoes in our meatloaf.  I might make this again, but I will add much less brown sugar and I'll add some stewed tomatoes.  The brown sugar was a nice touch, but not as much as this recipe calls for.

I did not like this recipe.  My husband liked it, but not without slathering ketchup on it.  I thought it didn't have enough flavor throughout.  Maybe with the sauce on top also, as others have suggested, it wouldn't have turned out so bland.

I followed other suggestions & added a small layer of ketchup/sugar on top.

This recipe tastes fabulous! I recommend using the LEANEST beef possible.

Happy cooking! =)

This was a wonderful dish!  I loved it, my husband loved it.  No wonder why there are so many great reviews.  Easy to make - the brown suger glaze adds a nice flavor.  I'd definitely make it again.

Just loved this recipe.  Used my meat thermometer to 160 degrees and came out perfect and sliced well. My 100 yr old DM, who likes sweets, ate a good portion.  Used 93% ground beef so wasn't greasy.  Possibly might use a little more ketchup.

Raw chopped onions in there didn't work for me.  Next time I'll use onion soup mix or some onion powder instead.  I put the glaze on top and bottom as suggested by others and reduced the sugar so that tasted fine to me.  My husband didn't like the glaze though.  Overall a good juicy soft meatloaf but not enough flavor as is.

The best meatloaf I've ever had.  The glaze made by the sugar and ketchup makes a beautiful presentation and I served it over the top of the slices.  I used wheat bread pieces instead of crackers and it turned out wonderful. It was very tender but held up great.  Beautiful and delicious.

We tried this recipe for dinner last night and it was great!  Even my children who have never been crazy for meatloaf came back for seconds.  Needless to say, we didn't even have leftovers.  The only thing that I did different was to add onion salt rather than onions and bread crumbs instead of crackers.  This is a keeper!  Thank you!

As an accident I had defrosted ground turkey.  I wasnt aware that my husband had picked it up.  Once I realized the meat was turkey.. I was hesitant to continue.  I had my mother over for dinner too that night.  Surprisingly it turned out good.  Everyone was happy with it.. not one unsatisfied customer.  I rated it an 8.5 hubby rated it a 9.5 and my mom rated it a 10.. go figure...

Very good meatloaf!  I added a half a pound of ground pork and substituted garlic powder for ginger.  Instead of milk I used the tabasco brand bloody mary mix (with horseradish)  It turned out awesome!  Much better the next day!  Thank you!

This has become a favorite at our house.  I cut down on the amount of brown sugar a bit (much to my husband's dismay) after teh first time I made it.  Wonderful and easy.

I never make meatloaf because I never liked it as a child when my Mom used to make it.  This recipe was so good though.  Moist and delicious - I loved it and my husband thought it was awesome! I made the Savory Mushroom Sauce from this site to go over it, however it really didn't need it since the brown sugar and ketchup made a nice glaze for the meatloaf. This will now be a staple in our house. Thanks!

I followed this recipe as it was written and found it to be very moist and delicious.  My husband especially loved it and asked that I make it again.  If I were to do it over, I might add a little less milk and even a bit less cracker crumbs.  Still, this was very, very good!

The meatloaf itself was flavorful and very moist.  I substituted garlic powder for the ginger.  The brown sugar was just too sweet.  Next time I would only use half as much brown sugar and a little more ketchup.

This meatloaf was very sweet and a bit bland. However, the combination of brown sugar, ginger and ketchup gave it a very nice, smoky flavor that deserves a second try.  I will cut the sugar and add more spices next time to see if I can improve it.

This was a great hit! I didn't have saltine crackers on hand so I just used Ritz instead. Also made it in a pinch for guests and everyone loved it! They thought I had planned ahead. Oh yeah, no one likes onions at our house, and our guests never noticed it was onion free...or at least they never said it was "missing something". I added it to my recipe box.

This was delicious.  I made it for my husband and he almost ate the whole thing himself.  I normally hate ground beef but actually found myself going back to steal bites off of my husbands plate.

I have been teased as far back as I can remember about my "Terrible Meatloaf". Well this recipe just changed everything, it is the BEST. It was gobbled up so fast that I only got one little slice for myself. Easy and delicious and I didn't change a thing!

My husband and daughter thought it was the best they had ever eaten.  I altered the recipe some by adding allspice  instead of ginger and glazing the top of the loaf with the brown sugar.

I absolutely hate meat loaf and always have.  However my family likes it so I occassionally will find a recipe and make it.  This recipe is by far the best one I have ever tried.  I really enjoyed it as did my family.  I did have cook it quite a bit longer to make it dark enough for my liking though.  I might make this again as soon as next week.  Thanks for a great recipe.

i made this recipe last night and it turned out okay.  it was different then just an ordinary meatloaf recipe because of the brown sugar and ketchup, but without that you just have an ordinary meatloaf.  i did as other users suggested and reduced the amount of brown sugar.  i took a 1/4 cup of it and mixed it in with the ketchup and put most of that on the bottom of my pan, then i sprinkled just a little bit more brown sugar on top of the mixture and put my meatloaf on top.  i saved a couple tablespoons of the ketchup/brown sugar mix and put it on top of the meatloaf also.  i found out that mine needed to be cooked a little over an hour.  it turned out to be good.  the brown sugar and ketchup is what makes it not ordinary, you could use that on your own meatloaf recipe if you wanted.  thanks for the recipe, will use it in the future.

I'm not sure what all the fuss is about here. This meatloaf was tasteless except for the sugar.  The actual meat was bland.  It was moist and a good texture, but there was no zing or flavor. I'm adding a bunch of stuff to this in the future.

This was a good meatloaf, and I will use it as my basic meatloaf recipe, but I will make changes to suit my taste (leave out ginger, add a little tabasco and worcestershire sauce, use sweet garlic steak sauce instead of ketchup/brown sugar).  The texture was perfect and it held together well while still being good and moist.

Great easy meatloaf! 1/2 of brown sugar mixture underneath and 1/2 on top works well. Also cooking for 1 hour 20 minutes seems to do the trick. Definitely use packet of onion soup mix, makes a big difference.

I really liked this recipe although my husband doesn't like the sweetness. The brown sugar made a nice glaze and it was a different, but very tasty, change from traditional meatloaf! Will definitely make again.

The meatloaf texture was very nice. Soft but not falling apart. It lifted easily with a fork. It was a bit too sweet for me though. Maybe I shouldn't have spooned all that gravy on the slice! Very fine dish.

Meat loaf was great! Wish there was a way I could pour out grease from meat without losing any brown sugar.  Was surprised at how flavorful the meat was without the ketchup being in the meat mixture.  Mom even liked it and she's used the same recipe forever!

Great recipe! I'm not particularly fond of meatloaf, but this was different! And my husband couldn't get enough. Usually I change recipes a bit too and I couldn't find anything I would want to alter. It was perfect. Thanks so much Starbuck!

the meatloaf was good and may have it again, but it was not wonderful.  i would cut the brown sugar by 1/4 and add more ketchup.

This was OK. Kids didn't care for it particularly. My grandmother raved about it, but didn't ask for the recipe (which you usually does if she REALLY likes). Less sugar may help.

First let me start out by saying I hate meatloaf. Everyone says try mine, it's the best. I still don't like it. On the other hand my wife LOVES meatloaf. It's her favorite comfort food. So in saying that, I was nice, made dinner and made the dreaded meatloaf for my wife. Well, my wife LOVED this one. I even got a nice hug for making it. She loved the flavor and couldn't find anything she didn't like about it. I on the other hand thought it wasn't too bad for meatloaf, had two small pieces. But I still hate meatlof. My wife says this is a keeper! I did find that I had to bake it a bit longer than the 1 hr. I also put a bit uf ketchup on the top for color.

Much too sweet.  I also had to cook it 20 minutes longer than stated because it wasn't cooked in the center and was rather mushy.

This meatloaf was the best we've ever had.  Many of the reviews said the meatloaf was too sweet.  Not so!  The combination of ketchup and brown suger was a perfect addition to the meatloaf itself.  This is the only recipe for meatloaf we'll use.

This was the first meatloaf I have ever made and I think it was great.  I changed the ketchup glaze to a half ketchup half BBQ sauce mix and that was great!  I would recommend it even if you aren't out of ketchup (like me).  I needed to bake it a little longer than recommended but it was very tasty!

I substituted dry onion mix for the onion.  Also, I used plain bread crumbs instead of the crackers.  Wonderful!  Delicious!  My husband said it was the best he'd ever tasted!  A keeper.

Used ground beef & pork, added garlic powder.  Put a couple of teaspoons of brown sugar on top (instead of bottom) & used chili sauce (instead of ketchup) over the sugar. Drained the fat couple of times & cooked 70 minutes...it came out perfect!

This is an quick and easy recipe using ingredients we all have in our cupboards.  The only thing I did different was put the brown sugar and ketchup on the top of the loaf instead of the bottom and it made a wonder glaze.  This is definitely a keeper in my book!1

Had to keep my meatloaf in the oven on 200 for an additonal hour because I had to leave.  The meatlaof juices were absorbed; much tastier than when it's taken right from the oven.  Great recipe!!

This is the most amazing meatloaf recipe.  I have never liked meatloaf, but find myself craving this!  My husband actually went to work and argued with a coworker over whether his wife had a better meatloaf recipe. Even my 2 year old daughter asked for seconds!  Oh, and we love ginger here, so I usually add just a bit more ginger and freshly ground pepper than the recipe actually calls for to spice it up a little.

My family gobbled this up.  My husband thought "Brown Sugar Meatloaf" sounded gross, but he ended up loving it.  I used 2 lbs. of very lean ground beef, an onion soup packet instead of the chopped onion, added a little garlic and a 4oz can of mushrooms, and used italian seasoned bread crumbs.  I did the brown sugar and ketchup like the recipe said, in two 9x5 loaf pans, and basted the loaves with the liquid the last 20 minutes or so.  Served with garlic mashed potatoes -- a great dinner!

Easy and delicious. Be sure to use the leanest beef possible, though. Can be greasy with regular ground beef.

This was the BEST meatloaf I have eaten in my entire life.  It just melted in my mouth.  It was so easy to make.  I did however add additonal seasonings such as garlic powder and ground worscheshire.  I also used seasoned bread crumbs rather than crackers.

My family and I enjoyed this meatloaf very much...
I cooked mine in a 9 inch round iron skillet..
it formed perfectly and I added some fresh grated garlic for taste..and I used club crackersinstead of saltines.
we loved it..my older boys adored it...

For my first time making meat loaf I think this was pretty good. The milk made the meat very soggy and I had to use close to a cup and a half of crackers though. I would suggest more directions for the amateur though...for example I didn't realize how much you had to pack it down or to create space at the side of the pan for the grease. Also, I divided the brown sugar and ketchup and put some on top and some on bottom. But now that I have given a trial run, I will definately make again.

This recipe was unbelievable!! I usually make a good meatloaf, but to quote my 6 year old "this is so delicious!"  I did alter the recipe somewhat,,,I used 1/2 grounded pork,,,added 2 cloves of garlic, and around 2 teaspoons worshcester sauce.  I also used a mini loaf stone pan (from Pampered Chef), and baked it at 350 for about 45 minutes. It came out perfect,,,,and even better- I have one more mini loaf in the freezer!  Thank you for this great recipe!!!!  :)

I hate meatloaf.  My husband loves it.  I've been looking for a good recipe we could all enjoy for many years.  I've found it!!  I love it!  My family of 5 ate every bit of it.  I had doubled the recipe to have leftovers for sandwiches.  No such luck, it was all gone.  I will be making this often.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

This was very tasty and really enjoyed eating the leftovers. Though next time I think I'll use little bit less sugar.  And add some garlic to the meat.

This recipe was great !!  My husband just loved it!!  I didn't have brown sugar, so I substituted it with regular granulated sugar and it was still good!!   I will definatley make this again!!  I added a little more ketchup on top for the last 15-20 minutes.

I used a smaller loaf pan, so I had to cook it longer, but I thought it turned out wonderfully!!!  My friend said it was a little sweet (Only used a quarter cup) but being someone who really doesn't like meatloaf.....I thought it was great!!!

I am not a meatloaf person, but as long as I keep making this recipe then I would eat it all the time.  It is easy and best of all it is VERY TASTE...

As one who pretty much dislikes meatloaf, this wasn't bad at all. The meatloaf *was* bland, but if you put the sauce on it (which I assume you were supposed to) it was just fine. My only complaint was that it fell apart --making it unsuitable for sandwiches. Perhaps less milk next time? Good recipe.

I have only made meatloaf once before and it sucked but this recipe was great. Everyone loved it and the sauce was great! I did add some tomato sauce to the meat mixture.

I found this recipe to be a little sweet, and we normally love sweet main dishes.  I think if I had just sprinkled the brown sugar in the bottom of the dish - maybe 1/4 cup it would have been better.  The actual meatloaf has really good flavor.  I didn't have enough saltine crackers so I used a combination of saltines, Ritz and croutons so I would have enough.  I doubled the recipe and we have used the leftovers for yummy sandwiches!

Not a big fan of this one.  I guess I will stick to a more traditional meatloaf.  It was too sweet and sticky.  I honestly prefer the old-fashioned ketchup with cracker crumbs.

VERY, VERY, VERY GOOD.  After all the reviews this recipe got, I had to try it.  I'm glad I did.  It has a unique taste with a pinch of sweetness. Yummy. I used seasoned bread crumbs instead of the crackers. My two year old wanted seconds and my husband said it was great.  We will be making this one for a long time.  Thanks!!!!

I decreased the brown sugar to 1/4 cup and added garlic, worchestershire sauce and tabasco to spice things up a bit. Best meatloaf my husband and I have ever had.

There is only one word to describe this recipe.... YUM!  This was sooo good.  Took ordinary meatloaf and turned it into something wonderful. Tasted like a "mock bbq'd glazed rib".  I will most assuredly be making this one again and again.  Also, I think this would make a fantastic baked pork chop recipe.  Any way you cut it, this one is a definite winner!!!

Tastes OH so good!  I keep picking at the meatloaf even after I'm done eating.  Pretty easy to make, quick to assemble, and overall an EXCELLENT dish.  I use ground turkey instead of beef.

We loved the brown sugar on the bottom, however, felt the meatloaf itself needs a little more seasoning...I'm not sure what though.  It was enjoyable and great on sandwiches the next day.  My kids and husband ate it all up.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was wonderful, and it really does taste as good as it smells.  I had to bake it longer than an hour, but it was still moist, and that was probably just my oven. Hubby said make it again!

One word - TERRIFIC!!  My old meatloaf used to be a punishment for my family.  Then my husband made his version and everyone liked it.  Even he said that this recipe was better than his.  I doubled the recipe and froze one of them.  I can't wait to have it again.  I loved this meatloaf.

I was very disapointed at the blandness of the meat loaf. I substituted seasoned bread crumbs for the crackers and used tomatoe paste on the top. Even after that, it was extremely bland, almost like what you had in the cafeteria at school when you were in the 5th grade. I will use this recipe again, but I will surely spice it up.

What an excellent recipe!!!  I've done meatloaf before but I've never thought of adding milk to it.  The brown sugar and ketchup added a nice bbq flavour to this dish.  Hubby raved about this and when he took leftovers to work the next day he was fighting his co-workers off of it!! =)

I have tried several meatloaf recipes, and this one is by far the best that I have ever tried. My husband absolutely loves it. He asks for it all the time. It is also very good cold, on sandwiches for lunches. Thanks so much for sharing this one.

Made this meatloaf for company the other night.  Rave reviews! Even my kids loved it.  I put a couple of splashes of Worcestershire sauce in the mix and extra ketchup on the top after putting it in the loaf pan.

This is the best meatloaf I've had.  I do not like meatloaf but I had seconds on this.  The kids loved it too.  Not the run of the mill meatloaf recipe.  I will make this one for company!

This is absolutely the BEST meatloaf I've ever had! My hubby hates meatloaf, and even he loved this recipe! Like other reviewers, I only used 1/3 cup of brown sugar. I mixed it together w/ the Ketchup and with a little Worcestershire sauce. I put some on the bottom of the meatloaf and I put the rest on top before putting it in the oven. The whole thing cooked perfectly in an hour and 10 minutes.  I used 80% lean ground beef rather than 90% lean, but it was fine. I just drained out the grease a couple of times during cooking.  The texture of the meatloaf was perfect, and I had absolutely no mess at all unlike some previous posts. It really is a yummy recipe! Thanks Starbuck! This one is a keeper!! Ally

I loved this meatloaf recipe.  I did, however, change the ingredients a little, but only because I didn't have everything on hand.  I substituted a half pound of ground pork because I didn't have enough ground beef.  I also subsituted chile sauce for most of the ketchup and when I found I didn't have enough saltines, I topped up what I did have with fine bread crumbs.  It turned out great and my kids absolutely loved it!

I made this recipe last night and it was great.  My husband ate three pieces and he is not a meatloaf fan. I will Diffently make this again.  The only change I made was I use 1lb hamburger and 1/2 lb sauceage.

This meatloaf is great!! The first time I made it for company, and don't usually make something I've never tried before...it was a HUGE hit.  I doubled the recipe, served 5 adults and 3 children with no leftovers.  I've made it 3 times in the last month.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe.

THIS WAS TRULY OUTSTANDING.  WE LIKE OUR ONIONS SOFT SO I SAUTEED THEN BEFORE ADDING TO MEAT MIXTURE.  USED BREADCRUMBS INSTEAD OF SALTINES AND USED JOHNNY'S SEASONING SALT IN PLACE OF REGULAR TO ZIP UP A BIT.  WAS SOOOOO GOOD AND THE KIDS EVEN LOVED IT WHICH SAYS ALOT.  WILL MAKE OFTEN.

We really like meatloaf and this one was great.  I used ground round and it made a very smooth loaf.  I also used a few tablespoons of teryaki sauce in place of the ground ginger.  Tasted great!

WOW! I've tried several meatloaf recipes, and this one wins hands down.  My DH doesn't care for ground beef, but he had seconds of this dish, and mt 3-year-old gobbled it up, too.  I made the following modifications:  I used half ground beef, and half ground pork; seasoned breadcrumbs instead of crushed saltines; less brown sugar; and I added some tomato sauce on the top.  It was yummy - but I'd have to make two of them to serve six people!

Meatloaf doesn't get better than this!  My husband and daughter who don't like meatloaf went back for seconds!  Only thing I added was Worcestshire sauce.  A "must try" for all!  Better than Boston Market.

Very flavorful and different.  I cut down the amount of brown sugar a bit and it suited us just fine.  What a clever idea to use brown sugar in meatloaf.  (I'm happy to have discovered another use for brown sugar, one of my favorite flavors!)

Really good meatloaf, it has replaced my own recipe.  I can't eat another meatloaf unless it's this one!  My husband who loved my original meatloaf didn't want to try this one, but he agrees that it should now be our new meatloaf standby.

This recipe was so quick, easy, and yummy.  Most of the ingredients you probably already have in your house.  I made this dish for my husband and in-laws.  I cut the amount of brown sugar in half since they don't like sweet dishes and next time I think I'll add a can of tomato sauce on top as recommended by other people.  Great recipe!! Definitely will be made again.

I was a little sceptical at first, but it really is very moist. The brown sugar and ketchup give it its flavor.This is how i'll always make my meatloaf.

I made this meatloaf with venison and use Old London roasted garlic bread crumbs instead of the crackers.  It was incredible - super moist and very tasty.  I am going to add diced jalapenos next time I make it.  Thanks Starbuck!

Quick and easy to prepare.  Make sure to add the ginger - it makes all the difference.  Adding mushrooms, peppers, or other vegetables also gives it an interesting twist.  Worth trying~!

Very tasty. I reduced the brown sugar and added tomato sauce and hot sauce to the ketchup. The sweetness was reduced. Just enought to give it flavor. I also added a little brown mustard. I used chopped onions and also added some tomato sauce to the meat mixture. I also cooked about 15 minutes longer.  My family enjoyed this meatloaf. Nice change. I've passed this one along with my changes to my friends. One person has tried and they loved it. Thanks Starbuck for the recipe. It's a hit.

If you've ever had Boston Market meatloaf, this is real close.  My family and I liked it a lot. I added just a bit of ketchup to the meat mix and omitted the onion (my kids/husband don't care for onions).  You won't find onion in Boston Market's either.

I've tried many meatloaf recipes. This one is the best. I cut out the milk and used Ritz crackers instead. (only because I didn't have saltines on hand) My family loves it. It has become a regularly asked for meal.

A very tasty way to make meatloaf! The baking time is very accurate. Usually I adjust the time and/or temperature down a bit, but this time I decided not to and it turned  out perfect; oven temperatures can vary. I will definitely use this recipe again! Thanks! --NancyH. Stockton, California

My family loved this recipe.  My only problem was that I got ground chuck instead of round.  Also, I don't have a meatloaf pan, so there was a lot of grease in the bottom of the pan.  I'm going to make it again with ground round.

It was a good meatloaf.  My children thought it was o.k.  My husband turned his nose at first but went back for seconds. I will make it again but w/ a little less brown sugar.

This was delicious!! I added a couple extra ingredients: garlic powder and worchestershire sauce. In doubling the recipe, I didn't have enough saltines on hand so I made up the difference with seasoned croutons which I ran through my food processor. I forgot to add the milk, but even so it turned out very well. I served it to company and they loved it. Will definitely make again... thanks Starbuck for the great recipe!!

I added garlic and green onions instead of regular. I'm not usually a big fan of meatloaf as I find it be dry and bland.  However, this was very moist and tasty.  I will definitely make it again.

Great I just made it.  Excellent directions very easy to follow.  I added garlic. I did not think the sauce was too sweet.  It has a nice bar-b-que sauce flavor.  After cooking I inverted it onto a small serving dish it so the sauce was on top.  It is so good.  I am very happy with this recipe and will use many more times.  It is very important to use lean meat.  The leaner the better it will be most likely.  Thanks for sharing the great recipe.  So simple it was done lickity split.  Very little mess.

My husband absolutely hates meatloaf, complains it is dry and tasteless. I made this for him and he actually went back for more! It is wonderfully juicy and the brown sugar and ketchup make an excellent sweet sauce that bubbles up to cover the meatloaf while cooking.

The ginger was a great with the brown sugar!  Very simple/quick!  Sounds silly, but we made meat-cups... instead of putting it in loaf pan make it in cupcake pan - it's fun for all and cooks quickly.

Fantastic recipe!!  Cut down on the brown sugar, I just sprinkled some to coat the bottom and it was plenty sweet.  Great comfort food with some mashed potatoes.

This recipe was delicious!  I don't make meatloaf very often, but I would bet this is the best recipe I will find.  My husband doesn't want me to try other ones, he says this is it!
      I wrote this review above 8 years ago.  Now two kids later, I had forgotten about this recipe until a couple years ago.  My kids claimed they "hated" meatloaf after their impression of it at school.  After making it for them once, they fell in love with it and ask for this more often than not.  So, husband AND kid approved!

My husband and I really liked the flavor. I didn't use ginger,but added alittle liquid smoke,dry mustard and worcheshire sauce. Used seasoned bread crumbs. And used the sauce on baked potatoes.  Will surely make again.

This recipe was very good. If you are going to make it, I would just make sure to use a very lean ground beef, and maybe cook it a little longer than the recipe calls for. But the taste is great!
