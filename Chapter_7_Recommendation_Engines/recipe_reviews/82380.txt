This is an excellent recipe. The meat was juicy, and delicious. I would suggest cooking the brisket with fat side up, since the recipe didn't indicate. I also added some bourbon to the glaze which gave it a bold flavor. If you follow this recipe and pay attention to detail you should have no problem creating a delicious meal for your family or friends. I'd recommend this recipe to anyone. Thanks - Kevin from Dallas, Tx.

This was "oh so easy!" I had never cooked a brisket before, but this one turned very good, tender and flavorful. The glaze on the grill was very nice, and the sauce to serve with the meat was great.

This is good. Dang tasty. In fact. it's almost too much flavour. You need some serious beer or Dr. Pepper to wash this down. I have made this now three times and it's always good. You can use apple juice instead of apple cider (the recipe is confusing here). I served it sliced and smothered with sauce on white-trash sesame seed burger buns for that southern BBQ (tailgate party) flavour. For side dishes I served a vinegar-based coleslaw and homefries (done in the oven). Brilliant. Will triple this recipe and have a -kicker BBQ this summer.

Being a grill person of the highest order, I have to say this simple recipe is extremely good, but I made a simple modification. I cooked in the oven as directed with the season salt and apple vinegar, and used my own bbq sauce as it  was a known to me flavor. The meat was super moist, tender and very flavorful. A simple no brainer that will make you look like a top chef.

Thanks Oklahoma,

Definitely 5 Stars!!  Tender and flavorful.  Wonderful and delicious in every way.

I don't grill so I used the oven broiler on low for about 10 minutes for that part.   My brisket was only 2 3/4 pounds and it still took 2 1/2 hours to cook to "fork tender".  

The BBQ sauce is good.  If you have some other kind you like, it wouldn't matter which you used.  Actually, the feedback I got was that it was not necessary at all.  It's perfect without it, if you're in a hurry.

If you don't cook brisket much, I suggest make sure the liquid (apple juice in this case) comes not less than 50% up the sides of the meat.  When you think it could be done, (I first check after about 45 minutes per pound of brisket) stick a big fork in it and if it goes through easily, it's time.

Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

Great, and a note to Jeff C: make your sauce while the brisket is in the oven! Your lack of organization is not a reason to give this recipe 2 stars, c'mon!

Yummers!  This was my first time making brisket - a total hit with my family!  I stuck to the recipe, my seasoning of choice was Montreal Steak Grill Mates by Mccormick.  I had a smaller brisket (almost 3 pounds) and didn't cut down my roasting/grill time... it didn't burn, but was a little overcooked.  Still, the flavor of the honey "crust" was wonderful and my whole family loved the sauce as well!  I'll make this over and over.

The brisket looked and smelled great until I put it on the grill.  I was too busy getting the BBQ sauce together to realize it was burning.  I would recommend skipping the BBQ sauce (it was terribly vinegary tasting - even without boiling it ) and using your favorite BBQ sauce.  And keep a close eye on the grill with a spray bottle of water handy to put out flames.  We ended up chopping up the non-charred meat for beef BBQ.  Bummer.  Also, if you didn't know, a 5 pound brisket is about $25.

I will say that I make a very simliar recipe to this and it's one of our favorites.  Once of the main things I do differently is that we baste the brisket with the BBQ sauce while grilling, gives it a nice coating.  Also the most recent review has no business rating this recipe based on living in an apartment with no grill...it's not about that, try a broiler if you don't have a grill!

Seemed like a good recipe until it said to heat the grill. Not good for apartment goers.

This is by far the best brisket recipe I have found.  It was cooked perfectly, but has that crispy outer layer.  The basting sauce really added an excellent taste to everything.

This brisket came out tender and soft--I didn't grill it just reduced the temp to 275 after it cooked for about 2 hours on 350.  The barbeque sauce was tangy/sweet but I think I'll use a little less apple cider.  Overall I was pleased since this was my first brisket and I will definitely make again.

Absolutely perfect. This is our 4th or 5th attempt at making a brisket... we did cook it for 3 hours at 250, then an extra hour at 300. The best brisket I have ever had. Thanks so much for sharing!

My family loved this brisket, it was tender and moist. We did not care for the bbq sauce but use your own, the important part was the meat and that was great. We did aa 11 lb. piece and did it under the broiler instead of a grill, when it came to the glazing part. They can't wait for another. This recipe is a keeper and will be made again.

Best brisket ever and so super easy it was ridiculous!  It came out of the oven tender and moist.  The glaze was perfect and it didn't need a lick of sauce to make it any better!  Looking forward to the leftovers shredded in sauce tonight!

This was the first brisket I'd ever made, and it came out better than my father-in-law's - he's been making good brisket for years!!!  The only real difference was that I didn't have a grill, so I used the oven the whole time - and then let it sit in the oven on the warm setting for a few hours, since I made it too early for company!  This is my go-to recipe for any time that I have a brisket to cook, and I have never put it on the grill - oven only.  (I've used this recipe a LOT...).

This brisket was awesome.  I'm from Texas so I love a good smoked brisket.  I living in PA though and smoking during the winter is a little tough to do so I tried this recipe.  I cooked an 8 pound brisket for 4 hours and it was perfectly cooked.  I cooked the brisket in the oven, glazed it on the grill and then refrigerated it.  The next day, I sliced it, spread a little of the bbq sauce on it, covered it with foil and warmed it in a low oven for about 30-40 minutes.  It was outstanding!! The only change I made was to add a little liquid smoke to the barbeque sauce.

Prepared this exactly as called for and served it to ten dinner guests. It certainly was a crowd pleaser. I was tempted to add some bourbon to the glaze, but as a matter of practice I seldom modify a recipe on the first try. This brisket turned out to be both tender and flavorful. For our group of twelve people, we prepared two flat cut briskets that each weighed approximately 5.75 lbs. We had just enough left over to make sandwiches for a couple of days.

This is an easy recipe that works well for entertaining. We wanted to serve our guests at 6:30 PM. I was able to trim the brisket & measure ingredients at 10 AM, put the brisket in the oven at 11 AM, and finish on the grill at 2 PM. Then I wrapped the cooked briskets in aluminum foil and several towels and stored the wrapped briskets in an otherwise empty ice chest from 2:45 until 5:00 PM when I sliced the briskets and arranged the slices on a serving platter. Then I wrapped the platter and placed in our oven (oven not turned on) until 6:30 PM. The brisket stayed moist and slightly warm. 

I had prepared the sauce while the brisket was cooking. Immediately prior to serving, my wife carefully (so as not to boil it) reheated the sauce in the microwave to bring it to a warm temperature.

Bottom line: guests were pleased and we were able to enjoy their company without working up to the last minute on food preparation.

I bought the best brisket they had in Whole Foods and followed the recipe accurately. The meat was extremely dry and hard, barely edible. Seems like 3 hours in the oven is way too much...

I used a 20 pound roast and used 4x all the ingredients. Cooked in the oven for 6 hours, then moved to the grill. I did baste the meat with the BBQ sauce right before serving. I got rave reviews!

I love this tride and true recipe! We make this a cooking event several Sundays during football season as well as several other times a year. I'm going to try a store bought BBQ sauce this time that came highly recommended. It comes out perfect every time! Cheers! * note- make sure you get a brisket that hasn’t been injected with saline . I normally have to ask the meat department for one and its normally less expensive.

Wow-I am a vegetarian and always have problems making any kind of beef that my family will eat.  Husband loved it, kids who do not normally like BBQ really packed it away!  I turned the oven down to 275 and cooked an extra hour just to be sure it was tender.  And also, always cook fat side UP-the fat drips through and tenderizes the meat (this coming from a non-meat eater!)

full of flavor and very easy to make. the first time i made it, it was too dry. when it was time to put it on the grill it was for 10 mins because i wanted it to be edible. i followed the recipe exactly how it was given. i tried again but changed it a little. i poked holes in the meat with a fork and let it marinate in the cider for a day. i kept it at 300 degrees but cut the time in half (oven) and was able to better keep and eye on it on the grill. it came out perfect.

Just made this for dinner.  I did not have any apple juice so I used a bottle of beer instead.  No complaints. I also used the honey glaze and the sauce on some chicken that I was BBQing along with the brisket. The family loved it. Thanks.

This was good but not great. I didnt feel like setting up the grill so I broiled it for a couple minutes. It was good. I liked the BBQ sauce but ive had better brisket.

This is a keeper.  So easy.  Didn't have cider or juice so used beef broth.  Loved the honey and soy sauce baste.  Used my regular sauce instead of the recipe here.  Will try it next time.  The flavor was unbelievable!  So tender.

This was so easy to make.  Since we weren't supposed to monitor the brisket in the oven the first three hours, I set the oven to cook and hold and went to a movie.  When I came back it was ready to be thrown on the grill with the basting sauce. I did not make the BBQ sauce.  Although, I did alter the recipe for basting. I was out of soy sauce so I use 2 tbsp of Hoisin sauce and one tbsp of AI.  It tasted great with the honey.

This is an awesome recipe! I have only been cooking for about a year or so and my first time cooking a brisket ever. My family loved it so much. Good job on posting something that is a truly awesome recipe. And for the folks that that said it was too dry, you just need to follow directions a little better. And for the person who cut the cook times down, shame on you, brisket gets more tender the more you cook it. You might want to have your grill checked out to see if your "low" setting is working properly. The key is to cook at safe low temp and the longer the better. Oh and one more thing, you should pick a good grade of meat. Sometimes your meat comes out bad because you bought a really bad piece of meat. Things to think about before you give your thoughts to the creators of recipes.

The best by far.even family members that don't like brisket much loved it.even my picky 3year old. I did use apple cider vinegar only instead of the vinegar.didn't want to chance it tasting too vinegary. I'm glad I did. It was sooooo very good! thanks so much for the recipe my favorite meat can now be made at home anytime!

On the top of my print out for this recipe, my notes are "off the hook" as this is the best brisket recipe I have ever found.  It comes out perfectly and is devoured, even by my picky kids, every time I make it.

I have never attempted brisket before, but was wanting something different for our Labor Day "get-together". This WON everyone over. I made it exactly as specified and it came out perfect. The secret to the barbeque sauce is to slow-simmer the sauce to blend the flavors. It came out perfect - no vinegary taste - just a nice tangy barbeque sauce and a perfect compliment to the brisket. This Kansas gal will be cooking up Oklahoma brisket more often. Thanks for a simply fabulous recipe. Also be sure to use a freshly sharpened knife and cut against the grain of the meat. It will melt into each slice for a beautiful presentation! Thanks for a great recipe!

This brisket was wonderful.  I prepared it for a family get-together, and everyone loved it.  We had leftovers that were every bit as moist and tender the next day as they had been the first.  I had noticed that one review reported that their brisket came out dry so I was very careful to follow the instructions exactly.  We even accidently charred one cut a little, but it still turned out great.  I would highly recommend this recipe.

This was my very first time cooking a brisket, so I followed the recipe to a "T".  Unfortunately, the meat was extremely dried out.  It was so incredily dry.  The good news is that the marinade and the barbeque sauce have wonderful flavor.  I would not make this brisket again, but I would make the marinade and barbeque sauce for other dishes.

Some people really rely on the star rating system. This is why I am writing this review, when I have never written one before, to say that this recipe is just too sweet. Every single part of it. Basting the meat in honey and following that with sweetened ketchup could give anyone a cavity and simply tastes bad. If you must make this again, please use good store bought barbecue sauce or find a better recipe and then use that for basting instead of spreading slightly soy tasting, salty honey.

Delicious! This was my first time cooking brisket, and I would definitely use this method again. I had a 4.5 lb brisket, cooked in the oven for 3.5 hours before grilling. it didn't take 30 minutes to grill, maybe 10-15 to get that nice glaze. I improvised a bit on the glaze as I didn't have soy sauce, but it was still great. We used a premade BBQ sauce. I sliced up the leftover brisket, and mixed the pan drippings with a bit of BBQ sauce and poured it over the leftovers to reheat it tomorrow.

My family wants me to make this again! Yay! I'm from NJ so I'm not a brisket connoisseur. I've never made one. I've only made corned beef brisket on St. Patrick's Day.  I found this on sale months ago and pulled it out of the freezer yesterday. I found this recipe and it sounded promising so I tried it. I am a beginner at brisket, but these were the changes I made:
The recipe called for 5 lbs. When I looked at my package it was only 1.5 lbs. So, I reduced the cooking time to 2 hours. Also, it's winter here, so grilling would be an option if I was really into it. I'm not. So instead of grilling for the 30 minutes, I basted it under the broiler for 30 minutes. Everything else I did as per the recipe and it was fabulous! Thanks!

I used this recipe with a 13 lb brisket and it worked well.  I used 3 cups of cider in the roasting pan and cooked it for 3 hours on 300 and then lowered the temperature to 250 for another hour to account for it's size.  Not sure if the extra hour was necessary but it was still very tender so it didn't hurt.  I wasn't up to making the BBQ sauce (just used some good botttled stuff) but I did make the glaze and throw it on the grill for a bit.  Caution: the glaze and/or the fat on the meat is highly flammable so you really have to watch it.  Ended up with a few charred bits in places...but it was easy to remove.  The meat was tender and just fell apart.  Very good.  Will absolutely make again!

The meat was waaay overcooked! Even so, it was still quite good. So next time, I'll try dropping the oven to 275 and only let it kiss the grill in order to crisp the outside. This is a great alternative to smoking a brisket.

1. If your a lazy/ mediocre cook like me don't be afraid of this recipe. 
2. You don't need a bbq , I just pan seared it 
3. If you make it you will love it. It was sooo moist and yummy. 

I used a crockpot and cooked it on low all day with the Apple cider . Then I didn't have soy sauce so I used teriyaki instead and just used my stovetop to finish off. I skipped the bbq sauce. Everyone loved it and I'm danged impressed I made something soooo good. We all went to bed with tummy aches cuz it was just that good .

This is a wonderful mouth-watering recipe!  I wouldn't change a thing.  For my family of three, I cut baked/grilled brisket in half; freeze half and top off the remainder with the BBQ sauce.   Later, I thaw frozen cooked brisket, heat and make up another batch of BBQ sauce.    I am able to cook it through-out year.  I have an outdoor BBQ grill and an in-door electric crock grill and have no problems.

We loved this.  The only thing I changed was adding a bit of cumin and chili powder to the sauce.

Excellent recipe-be sure to "stay" out by the grill with the brisket because it will drip and flare up.  The sauce carmelizes and gives a great taste but don't want to let it burn which it will because of the honey.  Oh so good and in Texas, brisket is king, so it takes a great recipe to sell a Texan.  No need to go to the BBQ restaurant as often.  Thanks, Susan for the recipe!

My husband is like, "a-oooooh-gah" when he comes home from a hard day at the plant and sees this brisket on the table!  Very easy from a workload and kleen-up standpoint, which earns extra points in my book.  The barbecue sauce is stand-alone good with any other meal.

I've never cooked a brisket before and this recipe was a great introduction. It came out wonderful and my parents and sister (who were dining with us for Easter) all gave multiple compliments on it. It's relatively easy and the end result is great. The BBQ sauce was also delicious.

I made it exactly as written with the one small addition of liquid smoke to the oven part with cider. It was fantastic. Had none left for leftovers and the sauce was a huge hit as well. I did add a pinch of cayenne pepper to the sauce as well. This will be my go to for brisket. One small piece of advice. Watch it on the grill! It’ll catch on fire in a hurry!!! Lol

It was okay, okay it was good but brisket is always good. However,  didn't taste as good as others I made. I wouldn't use apple juice again, would taste better in broth. The glaze was really good.

Just a touch too dry, I would cook maybe 30-45 min less next time. Honey/soy glaze had a great taste. Added some potatoes, garlic and apples for flavour in the pan. Maybe that affected the dryness? Overall very good and would try again

I was skeptical with the brisket only cooking in the apple cider, but, it had great flavor! I served it with the sauce on the side and we had brisket sandwiches the next day.  Super tender and full of flavor!

After 3hrs in the oven, the brisket was still very tough. I rescued it by cookibg it at low temp in an electric frying pan for another 5hrs plus 40min on BBQ. This recipe did not work for me.

Make it again!?  Oh, yes!  Switched it up just a bit.   5lb fresh brisket.  Was $6.99/lb on sale, so really need to treat this expensive cut with care. I used a rub that is called English Prime Rib Rub, salty and broth-y flavor, worked great. Apple juice is a good choice, the cider may be too tart.  I baked in the oven for 2 hours (don't forget to seal that roasting pan up really well.)  A double layer of foil will help you out here.  And you can reuse the foil for the upcoming steps.  We hickory smoked the brisket for 1 hour on the Weber grill which was converted to a smoker using a Slow n' Sear.  Then, baste with the honey/soy sauce mix, but turn quickly, only a few mins a side to get a nice crust.  Next, seal up in foil off heat, we don't want more smoke now, and cook for 1 hour 15 minutes longer.  We really enjoyed the bbq sauce as written, this may not be what most people expect or think of when they think of bbq sauce, but it pairs very well with the brisket and the design and consistency of the sauce works for this application.  Future plans:  Oven for 3 hours, the rest as written.  I think 1 more hour in the oven would give us the fall apart texture that we were just barely missing.

I made this just as the instructions said and found it to be extremely moist and flavorful.  I'm not sure you even need the barbeque sauce.  The only change I would make next time is to trim off the fat before putting the brisket in the oven.  I had an 8 pound brisket so I baked it for 7 hours. I'm definitely going to make this again.

This was easy and turned out very good. Next time I may make the day before and slice when cold, as it was a little stringy out of the oven. The big hit was the barbecue sauce! Everyone wanted the recipe. I won't buy BBQ sauce again.

I made this. I had no apple cider so I used apple juice. And I didn't read the recipe so well and mixed the honey glaze in with the BBQ sauce recipe and it tastes amazing. I don't think there is a need to bother with the grill but that's just me. The meat should already be plenty cooked and tender after three hours.

Delicious!!!  Followed recipe and very pleased with the results.   I did go to a local butcher shop to purchase the brisket so I do have to attribute some  success of the outcome to the high quality of beef.  Ease of prep was outstanding. This recipe is a keeper!!

I have made this several times now, following the recipe exactly as written.  It is absolutely fantastic, and gets rave reviews from my beef-loving family!!  It is so tender, and the glaze and BBQ sauce are terrific.  I do suggest carving the brisket with an electric knife when serving. Thank you for sharing such a great recipe!

This  is a fantastic recipe.  Followed the recipe with the exception of adding a cup of beer for the initial roasting since I didn't have any apple juice.  It was moist, tender and an awesome flavor.  Finishing on the grill gives it a beautiful crust, smoky flavor and the perfect taste.  Won't hesitate to serve this to guests and will definitely add to my favorites.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!!

Made this with a 3 lb brisket and a 3 lb pot roast.
Only change was  I only used salt and pepper to season and then cooked as 
written for 3 hours then placed on the grill and used the honey/soy sauce. 
after pulling from grill brushed with remaining sauce and didn't use BBQ sauce.
This was the best beef I have had in years, grandson who doesn't like grilled meat had seconds. My wife says this is the only way i can cook brisket from now on.- devans

Absolutely wonderful!! I used apple cider, did not make the BBQ sauce. I also did not keep it on the grill for thirty minutes. My grill runs hot even on its lowest setting though. I kinda made a judgement call when it was done. Tastes awesome! Will definitely make again.

We make brisket a few times a year & this one was outstanding!  I skipped the "make your own bbq sauce" & just used one of our household favorites.  It was awesome.  Definitely a keeper!

This was a kick butt recipe!!!  It was super easy.  I  know how some people complain about reviews where people modify the recipe, but I don't.  I appreciate the creativity.  I modified this one slightly, as I didn't have apple cider vinegar.  I used white vinegar and added some apple juice, worked fine.  I also added some chili garlic sauce to the BBQ sauce mix.  It made the sauce sweet and spicy and complimented the Soy Honey basting sauce while on the grill.  It is a great recipe though.  So juicy and tender.

This was a wonderful and easy recipe! I didn't make the BBQ sauce as we had some sauce we had purchased. You'll want to stay and attend the grill with a spray bottle as it tends to cause flames to flare up but it tasted so delicious, juicy and tender. My family loved it! Thank you!

I have to be honest, I did not follow this recipe to the T. I did not have apple juice and didn't want to use the cider. My husband isn't crazy about bbq sauce, so I eliminated that as well. Also, I did not use a grill. I do the cooking around here and I'm not about to bust out the grill, that's my husband's job.:)I used Emeril's all natural steak rub and beef broth. As another reviewer suggested, I filled the broth half way up the roast and at the end took the foil off and broiled it on low for 6 mins. Before broiling I did put the honey/soy sauce glaze on it. I cooked it in the oven for 4 hours(roast was 4+ lbs, so roughly 45 mins per lbs.)This recipe was delish! It is so tender and juicy that you don't even need bbq sauce. My kids used the left over juices to dip theirs in. This is a keeper.

This was delicious! I didn't make the sauce but the recipe for cooking the brisket was spot on. Very tender and the honey soy (which I was a bit skeptical of, I admit) was dynamite. Thanks for sharing such a great recipe.

I only gave this recipe 3 stars because I really only used the cooking method. I did use apple juice as directed and made the honey/soy sauce(only had 1.5 tbsp of soy). After cooking my 3lb brisket for 3 hrs, I basted it with the honey and soy and put it under the broiler for a few mins. Next time I will skip the broiler as is was just a tad dry. This was my first time cooking a brisket, the cooking method is awesome and will definitely use it again, thanks!

I never had brisket before and was quite nervous to make it for my guests. I followed the recipe exactly except I used apple juice instead of apple cider since I didn't have any.  Served on buns and spooned BBQ sauce on top. It was so tender and delicious. Everyone loved it. They all preferred the recipe's BBQ sauce over the bottled sauce I also put out. Definite keeper!

This was fabulous.  I didn't have apple juice so mine roasted in leftover wine, a little onion & garlic.  The honey glaze... no words, just the perfect combination.  We felt bad that we hadn't invited anyone over for dinner!  Two more meals out of this for us!

Yummy!Very tender and tasty. The sauce is really sweet but you could add a little spice if you wanted. Everyone liked it. I will have to make it again. I didn't have apple cider so I just used apple juice and added a little nutmeg and allspice to it.

Burt the heck out of it using recipe time, reduced for a 3lb roast.  tried the broiler on low suggestion for the final glazing, crispy black outer shell.  nothing like the picture.  pretty sad after waiting 3 1/2 hours.  Hope to salvage.

We didn't make the BBQ sauce but the brisket came out really good.  We had a 8lb brisket.  We had a little problem with flames on the grill from the fat but all and all everyone loved it.  Nothing left at the end of the day.

My family was only so-so on this recipe.  My brisket was a little drier than it usually is with our standard recipe, so not sure where I went wrong.  The honey/soy baste gives it an interesting flavor, but again, we will probably stick with our usualy family brisket recipe.

This came out great! Very moist for this cut of meat. The BBQ sauce jazzed it up nicely. Finishing it off on the grille gives it a little extra flavor and eye appeal.

I couldn't find a butcher in my local area, so instead of a brisket, I used a cross rib roast.  I also used a different sauce.  The honey/soy glaze was perfect. The glaze caramelized just right and held the juices in for moist, tender meat.

Interesting recipe.  I tried it because I'd never grilled a brisket before...I don't know what I did, but the meat came out incredibly dry, even with the honey/soy glaze.  The sauce, however, was a hit -- a bit too sweet for my taste, though.  Next time I'd probably use less honey and a little more vinegar.
