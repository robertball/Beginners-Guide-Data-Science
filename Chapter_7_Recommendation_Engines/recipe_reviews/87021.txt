I am the submitter of this recipe.  Nowadays I often make the salad without the chicken, but when I do add chicken, there is no way it takes 20 minutes to cook it!  I also have replaced the mayonnaise with plain yoghurt in the dressing.  You may want extra strawberries and more spinach than the recipe states for 2 servings.  Also, a touch of sugar in the dressing can be nice if you like things sweeter.  Enjoy!

A refreshingly different salad. I used raspberries instead of strawberries. The sweetness of the raspberries went well with the mild taste of the dressing. I found that needed flavor was added by roasting the almonds with a bit of sugar and pepper.

Wonderful summer salad.  I grilled my chicken instead of using the stove, and added a little fresh grated parmesan on the top. Simply delicious! Even my super-picky boyfriend liked this one :-)

*REDUCED FAT VERSION*

Great flavors that work well together.  The dressing is awesome but I always look at how can I cut the fat or calories and maintain the full flavor or even bump it a bit.  I did this recipe just as described but I swapped out the milk for fat free half and half and added just a dash of water.  I also used Mayo which is Olive oil based (Green lid by major brand) cutting all the saturated fat and cutting down on the non-saturated by about half.

Last thing I did was to zest the lime with a micro-plane making the finest zest possible and added it to the dressing.  

Hope that helps for those of us who try to cut out as much fat as possible!

This salad is delicious!  I made it just as the recipe suggested and I wouldn't change a thing.  My hubby liked it and he doesn't even like spinach or strawberries that much. Loved the dressing too.  Will surely make this again ad again.

This was good, I used it as a base for the spinach strawberry salad I was dreaming of. To jazz up the dressing, I used lemon juice with just a splash of lime juice, and added 1 Tbsp of sugar.  Then I topped the salad with candied pecans instead(recipe from this site). Delicious!

A very nice, very tasty salad.  I have made it several times now.  Thanks, it will turn into one of our regulars.  I add about 1/8 of a teaspoon of Ancho Chili powder to the dressing which gives the dressing a little more fullness in flavor.  Sometimes I fry up cod in butter, with salt, pepper, fresh garlic, and ginger as an accompaniment, rather than chicken.  It doesn't cube well, but the flavors are very complimentary.

We have this often. Usually after an over indulging weekend. I grill my chicken then slice. We like it with poppyseed dressing. I am going to try your dressing recipe. Sounds delicious.

Tried this recipe for a luncheon I had, it was good, those attending said they really liked it, but personally, I would have preferred a sweeter dressing. The lime juice gave it a nice summery taste, but a little too bitter for me.

Delicious!  I used only 1/2 of the ginger for a more subtle flavor.  I also added some finely chopped fresh cilantro and black pepper to the dressing.  It was perfect!  I'll definitely make this again.

This was absolutely delicious! My wife and I could hardly get enough of it! I veganized the recipe by using seitan (made from wheat gluten and which you can buy at many grocery stores, usually near the tofu) instead of chicken, egg-free Veganaise (amazing), and almond milk instead of cow's milk.

The dressing is what makes this amazing with the strawberries. Make this, without the chicken it is fine, but trade the chicken for fresh grilled salmon and you have a new taste all together :)

We just had this salad this evening and it was met with rave reviews.  I took some of the suggestions of other - added a bit more milk and a bit of lemon juice and sugar to the dressing.  I also added some seasoning salt to the chicken as I was browning it up.  A nice combination of flavours!

I make about 4-6 servings of this for my family and mix it all in a big bowl with the dressing on the side. It makes a nice light dinner for hot summer days. The only complaint I have is that the strawberries don't keep well for leftovers, but there's not much we can do about that.

I used left over chicken for this salad and it tasted delish.  I didn't have almonds so I used walnuts!  Also, thought I'd sweeten up the dressing a bit...added honey!  YUM!!!  I will make this again!

This was a wonderful summer salad. The first time we made it was exactly as recipe stated and was delicious. The next time we made it I used half the dressing and also pureed some strawberries in the processor and drizzled it over the salad this was a huge hit. Husband and kids recommend adding it to the weekly menu.

While I loved this salad, my husband thought it was just "okay." I doubled this recipe and used a pound (small package) of boneless skinless chicken breast. Next time, I will definetely add a package of Splenda to the dressing and use 1/2 lite mayo, 1/2 non-fat greek yogurt. A very bright, delicious low-fat, low-calorie meal!

I thought the proportions were a little off and the dressing was missing some flavor. It was okay, but I probably won't make it again.

Perfect.  I made this as a meal so added more chicken but otherwise tasted absolutely fabulous.  I always use EVOO for the oil.  Thanks!

I used lemon juice since I didn't have a lime on hand. Also used sugared almonds as other reviewer suggested. My husband loved it- I thought the dressing was missing just a little (maybe the lime).

This salad is really tasty even without the chicken, although the chicken does round it out.  And it was quite easy to scale down to one serving.  Love it!

This is a first not giving 4 plus stars and this would be a 5 star recipe if not for the dressing. The salad by itself is 5 stars and delicious but the dressing was awful and we didn't even use it. I like ginger and lime but with the mayo and everything it was not good. I will make this salad again but never ever make the dressing. Maybe following some of the reviewers advise would make it better but I am not sure I would even try. Our raspberry vinaigrette dressing tastes fabulous with this.

Awesome! I combined it with an Almond version of Pistachio Crusted Chicken on the site, this recipe and it was fantastic! I substituted extra garlic and pepper for the ginger due to none on hand. Would have omitted milk if known it would turn out runnier than desired. Fantastic summer dish! Filling! Will defiantly make again!

Wonderful salad! I used pre-cooked chicken strips and then sprinkled them with garlic powder and microwaved them to warm. I used Miracle Whip since I prefer it's taste to mayo. I had to add more milk though as the dressing was too thick to drizzle. The dressing was fabulous and this salad too! Thanks!!!

The salad was very good, especially nice on a hot day.  I liked the dressing, however my husband did not which is why I gave it four stars instead of five.  I didn't have sliced almonds, so I chopped some and lightly toasted them on the stove.  Also, I cut the chicken in small medallions and used Chef John's technique in his honey brined fried chicken recipe which we love.

This is a wonderful salad. I have a soup bowl which is perfect for serving. Instead of placing the strawberries in the salad, I pull off the stems from the spinach, put on the slivered almonds then ring the outside of the bowl with sliced berries. The dark green, bright red and cream colored nuts makes for a beautiful looking salad. I used it just as a salad with the chicken seperate. My friends that I had for dinner kept dipping the chicken in the dressing until it was gone. Thanks for a fun recipe.

As per other reviewers, added two truvia packets for some sweetness, poppy seeds, used yogurt instead of mayo, but did add one tbs. of mayo in addition because it didn't taste that great with just yogurt. Also made the candied pecans which went well w/ the salad. DH raved about it and didn't even complain that we were just having salad for dinner.

Followed some suggestions of others (olive-oil mayo, lime zest and some sugar) and used leftover grilled chicken in mine.  For another layer of taste, used Planters' Chile-Lime flavored almonds.  The ginger is pretty prominent.  Overall, it's a refreshing dinner salad.

The salad was great, but I bbq'ed the chicken instead of frying. I think it was much better this way and felt even more summery!

Excellent, easy, ideal for dressing a table too. I served it with an "asado criollo" (Argentinean barbecue) but it could be a perfect stand alone dish.

I loved this!The different flavours float around your mouth.I used this for the centre of a salad and then added other salad items.I would compliment the chef if I were served this in a restaurant.This will be making a regular appearance in my house over the coming summer months.

Wonderful...I poached chicken w/McCormicks Monterrey Chicken Seasoning in 10 mins...nice & moist that way..altho no grill or much color marks. 
Thanks for getting me ready for summer....someday when the Pacific Northwest monsoons are over.

So much yummier (is that a word?) than I thought it would be! The flavor of the dressing enhances the flavor of the strawberries, and vice versa. I had trouble with the dressing being entirely too thin, so I added about a tablespoon or so of sour cream. I also took another reviewers suggestion by adding some cilantro, lemon juice (using only a splash of lime juice), and black pepper. Next time, I will make a lot more dressing to store in the fridge!

It was good.  My dressing had a wierd texture becuase of the ground ginger, but my bottle could of been old, I think next time I want to try fresh ginger.  I also grilled my chicken wich went lovely with the salad.

This is my all-time recipe for a lunch time or dinner time salad. Whenever you can get your hands on fresh strawberries and spinach, your salad problems are dramatically reduced.  I season the chicken with a bit of adobo seasoning when cooking, in lieu of the garlic (I know, I'm one of the few who doesn't tolerate garlic well).  The lime makes the dressing very refreshing.  I've put a teaspoon or two into my favorite ranch dressing just to perk it up a bit and we really liked it.  Also used pecans instead of the almonds, just because they're preferred.  Again, it's an all time, all season, AllRecipe fav.

have made this several times, the only thing I do different is I use orange juice or lemon juice as I have those trees,(instead of lime) and I don't use ginger as my husband does not like ginger. but otherwise follow the recipe and it is always great.

I made with leftover roast chicken.  Probably used a little too much lime juice and sweetened with a little Splenda.  Very good.

Followed the directions with slight modifications.
I added a little honey to the dressing to sweeten just a pinch.  I added fig goat cheese to the salad.  That's all and it was amazing! Will make again
