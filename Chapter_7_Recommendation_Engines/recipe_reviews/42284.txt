Awesome dessert!  I like to egg wash the pie crust and dust with fine granulated sugar before baking the crust....what a difference! Graham cracker crust is a good choice too. Also, a little vanilla or almond extract added to the cream mixture is nice. Either way this dessert is a keeper!

This is a GREAT recipe! so yummy everybody loved it! If you want to make it healthy just use low fat cool whip and reduced fat cream cheese, and you can use reduced fat pie filling to (if you can find it). I used regular  blueberry pie filling and it is really delicious! 
If you are looking for an easy recipe all you have to do is buy the store ready to bake pie dough and mix a few ingredients and you have yourself a very yummy pie! ENJOY!
ps: if you don't want the bananas on top to get black add them right before you serve them.

I've made this pie for years and it's always great. I tweak it slightly by adding the juice of half a lemon to the cream cheese mixture and layering the sliced bananas on the bottom instead of mixing them in with the cream cheese mixture.

I made this for a Christmas desert and my whole family loved it! I however used raspberries instead of blueberry. I baked my 2 pie crusted for 16 minutes let them cool then added the filling layering the cream spread first then the sliced bananas then the pie filling followed by the fresh raspberries. It is a every sweet treat and you donâ€™t fill bad for eating it. My husband now has me make them and he eats 2 sliced for breakfast. This is a Very sweet and easy treat!! I encourage you to make it. Also I would say feel free to add any type of  fruit pie filling.

Absolutely divine!  My guests loved it.  We have an abundance of fresh blueberries at the moment therefor  I made me own pie filling.  I love the combination of bananas and blueberries.
