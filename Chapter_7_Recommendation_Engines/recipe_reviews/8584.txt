Very good chicken salad and easily adaptable if you want to add in additional ingredients (halved grapes, toasted pecans, sunflower seeds...etc etc).  Simple and tasty.

Using ideas from previous reviewers, I added several dashes of poultry seasoning and garlic powder to the mayo mixture.  Instead of 1 1/2 cups dried cranberries, I used 1/2 cup dried cranberries, 1/2 cup dried cherries, and about 1 cup of halved seedless green grapes.  Omitted the green bell pepper since I don't care for it.  Outstanding!! Huge hit at the covered-dish party I brought it to.  Hubby loved it also!!  I don't believe it serves 12 as listed, unless you make small sandwiches.  I served it on lettuce leaves and it perhaps served 6 to 8.

This is a wonderful chicken salad recipe. I was looking for something close to Arby's chicken salad and this was it. I omitted the green pepper and added chopped apples and sliced grapes. I highly recommend giving this recipe a shot. I'm glad I did!

I'm on a chicken salad binge.There are many great recipes for it on this side, but this one is almost perfect. It tends to be a little bland, but the addition of poultry seasoning, garlic powder to the mayo and some minced red onion makes it superb.Thanks Elaine.

I've made this twice now.  It's good right on the same day it's made, however, it's excellent on day two or three.  Give the flavors a chance to meld together.  Beautiful on a croissant sandwich.

Really good!  Love the craisins & blend of flavors.  Used mayo/miracle whip combo.  Used red bell pepper, because I had one.  Used leftover rotisserie chicken (shredded).  Toasted pecans.  This is a great recipe.  Don't leave anything out--everything adds to the overall flavor!  Be brave!  I was, & I was not disappointed.  Neither was my family.  Everyone stood around in the kitchen eating it on crackers!  Will be making again!!!

This is very good.  I served it out croissants and my guests loved it.  My husband said that maybe less cranberries next time and he is a cranberry lover!  I toated the pecans beofre adding them to the mix, this is an important step I think.  Thanks for a great recipe, I'll be using it again on Mothers Day.

I subsituted raisins (grapes sound good, too) for the cranberries, left out the bell pepper and served it on raisin bread like a local restaurant does. We loved it!

Soak the cranberries in enough hot tap water to cover for about 15 minutes and then drain on paper a towel. This will keep them from drawing moisture from the mayonnaise and thus creates a moister salad.  I also added a little garlic powder.

Great salad that's not just for Holidays! This is fruity and crunchy plus it's a great way to use up some leftover grilled chicken that I hand on hand. I LOVE dried cranberries so this chicken salad was right up my alley. I chopped up the chicken and opted to leave out the green pepper as well as the paprika. I chopped up a mix of Granny Smith and Red Delicious apple and added that in it's place. I mixed the dressing in a separate bowl before folding it into the chicken and other ingredients. For the dressing I used Hellman's light mayo and cut it with a bit of reduced fat sour cream. I also used half curry powder and half seasoning salt, for this salad I felt the curry powder just added that little extra something. I let this set in the fridge for a few hours, and after sneaking a few bites - WOW, what a wonderful combination of flavors! This was so good on whole grain bread. Thanks for a delicious recipe!

I have been making chicken salad like this for a long time and it is delicious!  I add red grapes with the dried crans, and since I have been adding my "secret" ingredient, it has gotten even more raves.  I add one teaspoon of Chinese Five Spice Powder.  Nobody can identify the special addition, but if you try it, you'll see just how much it improves the taste.  It is indescribable!

I served these on mini potato rolls and had good results.  I made these a while back and am just now getting around to writing a review for them, but I do remember they were good.  I added dried cherries to mine.

Great chicken salad.  Love the cranberries in it.  We serve it on croissants.  I have found a great way to cook boneless chicken breast.  Place chicken in a pot, cover with water and bring to a boil.  Turn heat off, cover and set timer for 20 minutes.  The chicken will be moist and perfect.

This is excellent!  I used candied pecans and they were DELICIOUS!!  To candy your pecans, all you do is put a cup of pecans in a saucepan over high heat and add about 1/2 cup of sugar.  Stir frequently, and once all the sugar is melted, they are done.  Careful not to over cook them as they burn easily.  I take my pan off the stove when the sugar is ALMOST dissolved, then just keep stirring while the rest dissolves.  Place the pecans on a piece of wax paper to cool for about 10 minutes, then chop up and add the the salad!!

I hate reviewers that give 5 stars and go on to say they changed virtually everything about a recipe...This one deserves 5 stars exactly as written. Excellent also with Craisins and half the seasoned salt. Great chicken salad!!

Tastes GREAT!  Thanks for the recipe.  I used 3 large boneless skinless chicken breasts and cooked them in a skillet with a little seasoning as others had suggested.  This amount of meat gave me exactly 4 cups.  I thought I would need to do all the roasting of the pecans and things by other reviews, but decided to keep it simple and it didn't need all that.  I did leave out the green pepper.  I like it, but no one else does so, out it goes.  
Amount of dressing is exactly right, I guess I used light Miracle whip though.

This was o.k. I followed the recipe exactly and had it the same day as well as the next day. It was better the day after...but a bit dry IMO. There are so many dry ingredients and such little dressing that you can barely coat it all. Way too much crunch. There were more crunchies (bell pepper, onion, celery, pecans) than there was chicken...and the chicken, unfortunately, took a backseat to the other ingredients.   I have no paprika complaints but not sure what it did for the recipe. Maybe you could substitute onion powder for the green onions? And I'm going to skip the pecans, maybe go with slivered almonds next chicken salad recipe I try; also nix the bell pepper.

Really great!  Very fresh tasting.  Small note of warning though: the green onions are very powerful and seem to intensify the next day. Great as sandwich filling on pumpernickel!

An excellent recipe - lots of flavor and texture!  Made this for Memorial Day  BBQ. I used sweet red bell pepper instead of green (prefer the sweetness) and added about 1/3 cup minced sweet red onion just for the heck of it.  The pecans and celery add that crunch that everyone loves.  I used the cherry-flavored *Craisins which I already had, and it added a wonderful flavor.  Son's girlfriend made it a few days later for her family, and said it didn't even last 1/2 an hour - they devoured it!  Definitely NOT just for holidays -  super for a great summer lunch or dinner! *(NOTE:  A year later, and still the favorite!  Would definitely recommend using the "Craisins" as they are softer than some other brands I have tried which were too hard & chewy.)

I chose this recipe because my daughter had to enter a recipe contest that called for all entries to be made with rabbit meat! I just substituted pressure cooked rabbit for the chicken. It won 2nd place at a state 4-H rabbit recipe contest! It made a nice presentation served in a glass bowl, surrounded by crackers. Tasted good too!

Excellent recipe! Changes I made: I hate and despise green peppers, so those were out. I forgot the green onions and it was fine without them. I seasoned my chicken with some salt free mesquite seasoning. Make this the night before, or at least several hours before. I added 1 cup chopped apple (to make up for the pepper and onion) on the day I served it. It was a BIG hit at the baby shower today. It would have been yummy on sandwiches or crackers as well. I will definitely make this again, and not just during the holidays. During the summer, I will substitute red grape halves for the dried cranberries.

TO MAKE THIS HEALTHIER: Do not use mayo or seasoned salt.  For my dressing I combine Organic Vanilla Yogurt with a small amount of Light Mayo, add Paprika, Parsley, Sage, Rosemary, Thyme, Sea Salt & Cracked Pepper. (I do not measure, just use the amounts you like).   I also use yellow pepper for it's color and I like it better than the green pepper.  I slice grapes and add those.  With these healthier changes you still have a fabulous tasting chicken salad and no one knows you used yogurt, in fact when asked "what did you put in your chicken salad, this is so good" I let them know that the dressing is made with yogurt and they are pleased not to have the added calories and fat.  Hope you like my version!! :)

Yum! My family loved this chicken salad. I served it on buttery croissants, and it was a meal on its own. I followed the recipe exactly. I was a little unsure about the dried cranberries; did the recipe mean Craisins (sweetened dried cranberries) or plain unsweetened dried cranberries? I used Craisins. However, I would reccomend decreasing the Craisins to 1 cup. I'll try toasting the pecans next time. Thanks for a great-tasting recipe! (And it's pretty, too!)

Excellent Chicken Salad.  Substitute apples and grapes for the green pepper.  Easy on the celery.  Added a bit more Miracle Whip instead of mayo.

I used this for eighty people and they raved about this the only thing that I did differnet is the nuts were walnuts and we used apples instead of carnberries because we could not find them.  at present I have a lady who wants the recipe for 200 people. another thing I did was when I boil the chicken I used Italian season and some garlic and parsley in the water . It was a really great part of the meal and thank you again

My husband is hard to please when it comes to chicken salad ... he thought it tasted GREAT!  The combination of the sweet cranberries with the green onion and green pepper add a wonderful balance and taste!  This is definitely a five star!  (I did use canned all white chicken meat).

This is a great recipe, and can be adjusted to fit any occasion.  I used small "Granny Smith" apple chunks in place of the cranberries for a summer occasion, and it was a hit.  If I'm in a rush, canned chicken will work in place of the fresh cooked cubes.  This recipe should be in everyone's file - it's a winner.

This is great! My husband really enjoyed it, and asked that I make it for his regular lunch rotation at work. Used a rotesserie chix the first time, canned this time, adding Italian seasoning both times. So tasty and healthy, too!

This is one of the best chicken salad's I have ever had. I would make it just as written with the exception of two things.  First, I seasoned my chicken with a poultry rub and then ROASTED it.  Roasted chicken has much better flavor than boiled chicken.  I also toasted the pecans.  Other than that don't change a thing.  This recipe is a keeper!

Perfect 5-star chicken salad with the addition of some poultry seasoning and garlic powder! I made a half recipe because I wasn't sure whether I'd like this and wish I had made a double - really fantastic! I'm sure lots of different variations would be great, but here's what I changed (based on what I had on hand): only used about 1/3 cup of dried cranberries, added 1 chopped pear, no nuts or onions, and added a dollop of light sour cream.  Excellent flavor & could easily be made light with light mayo and sour cream.  I'll be making this often and want to try grapes and more cranberries next time.  Yum!

THE BEST CHICKEN SALAD EVER!!!  I've been searching for a restaurant tasting chicken salad for a while and this sure fits the bill!!! LOVE IT!  I use other color bell peppers, I don't care for green ones, I also add garlic to the mayo, add grapes and don't use the pecans....allergies.  Thanks SO much for this recipe, I make it often and eat it for lunch over lettuce!  THANKS!!!!

I thought the recipe was delicious.  I only made half the recipe, which lasted in the fridge several days, as lunches for my husband and I.  I made some modifications suggested by others.  I added 1/2 tsp poultry seasoning, and 1/2 tsp garlic powder.  The second time I made it I modified it to lower the calorie content by subbing half the mayo for fat free sour cream.  Came out delicious and you couldn't tell the difference.  I also added half a green apple diced and about 1/2 cup sliced grapes.  Will definitely make again and again.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

I made a few changes to this recipe, and it is requested over and over and over.  First, be sure to stew the chicken with seasonings--lots of fresh celery leaves, poultry seasoning, a couple of chicken bouillon cubes, whatever is on hand--garlic powder, onion powder, celery seed.  Cube the chicken; do not shred it.  I used chopped green onions instead of green pepper, and I very finely dice a very small wedge of red onion.  Toast the pecans in a skillet and let cool before adding.  I also use smoked paprika which gives the salad a unique flavor and has people coming back for more.

When I first mixed this together, I was a little put off by the saltiness and the color. Threw it in the fridge anyway - left with pretty low expectations from what I tasted pre-fridge. I did a complete 360 on this when I tasted this the next day, however. It was freaking delicious!!!!! I did leave out the green pepper as I don't like it - if I had yellow or red I might have added some. Per other's very helpful reviews, I used 3 half chicken breasts, (seems to be the perfect amount) and did the poaching  the way that was previously suggested. Cover breasts in water in a pot, bring water to a boil, turn off heat, cover and let sit for 20 minutes. Came out moist and perfect. Give this a chance - I just licked my plate.......

This salad was easy to prepare and enjoyable to eat. I used leftover rotisserie chicken I had, chopped up into bite size pieces. I threw in some dried sweetened cranberries along with everything else called for in the recipe. I added the mayonnaise, to taste, so it was not too creamy. I seasoned with Hawaiian sea salt and fresh ground black pepper, to taste. I chilled this for several hours before placing them into sandwiches with fresh Manoa lettuce and tomatoes. The chicken was nice and tender and I loved the nuttiness, sweetness, tartness and all the ingredients added to make this chicken salad. In every bite I could taste a little saltiness, sweetness and slight tartness; the flavors were not overpowering and blended together nicely. The nuts added a nice crunchy texture to the salad. I paired this along with, “Baked Potato Soup, “also from this website. This salad leaves room to add, and adjust ingredients to your likings (i.e. carrots, golden raisins, etc.)

Yum! With so many reviews I doubt mine will ever be read, but I followed the recipe almost exactly as written and it turned out wonderfully. The only changes I made were because I didn't have the prescribed ingredients - I substituted walnuts and dried cherries and both taste great!

Okay, this is a great recipe.  Only one thing to try if you have extra time: saute a couple spoonfuls of sugar in a teflon pan with chopped pecans and/or raw sunflower seeds and you have sugared nuts to throw in the salad.  Do this with whatever portion you will eat the same day, as the nuts get a little soft after a few hours.  When sugaring nuts (no fat is needed), be sure to watch the pan closely...stirring often, and keeping the heat at a med to med high...but not high.  The sugar and nuts can burn quickly, so stir constantly after the sugar has liquified.

Hands down the best chicken salad recipe I've used and I've used a lot! I also added a little poultry seasoning and cherry flavored cranberries which I actually bought on mistake, but were good. I omitted the green pepper and used a rotissere chicken to save time. Really pretty and really tasty! This will definitely be the recipe I settle on.

My first five-star review!  Make this as is and you will not be disappointed.  Use good quality mayo and be sure to let it sit overnight.  At first it may not seem like enough mayo - but it is.  Once it sets, it is perfect.  The first time I made this I kept the chicken chunks on the bigger side,  the second time I cut/shred the chicken more - I prefer the smaller pieces of chicken.  Also, I read some reviews where they lessened the amount of cranberries - don't do this on your first try.  I think the cranberries make this!  Thanks!!!

Best chicken salad ever! I served on croissants, but would be great in lettuce cups or on crackers. My husband and picky 8 year old loved it also.

Used rotisserie chicken to save time also halved the mayo and used Greek yogurt to save on calories.  It turned out great, my fiance who does not like chicken salad loved it!

Very Tasty. I cut the recipe in half because I didn't have four cups of chicken. Left out celery and bell pepper and made about two cups of chicken that I seasoned with salt and pepper and doused with canola oil and placed on the George Forman Grill.  Served on toasted wheat bread. Will try green grapes next time.

As other reviewers have said, this recipe is very adaptable. My family isn't a fan of nuts in their chicken salad, so I usually omit those. I frequently substitute the green onions for a yellow or sweet onion, depending on what I have on hand, and I add white wine vinegar.  The cranberries make this salad, in my opinion.  Saves VERY well and always tastes better on the second day.

This is a great chicken salad and don't be fooled by the holiday title, this is great ANYTIME. I usually just make this in 1/2 portions and it is great for even the most picky eaters. 5 stars for sure.

I went with the highest-rated chicken salad on this site and can see why.  Very good.  I poached the chicken to make it extra moist.

This was really yummy!  My family loved it, I didnt have green onions so I used vadalia, and walnut instead of pecans...I wonder if it would've been better as the recipe said?  I will follow it next time, as I will be using it again.

Very good recipe!  I made twice this weekend :) I added 1 T sugar, 1/2 T lemon juice, 1/2 T vinegar and used almonds instead of pecans because that is what I had.  I love the tang with the sweet and salty fruit and nuts.  I also added 1 box of cooked whole wheat elbows and extra mayo the second time for a pasta salad....so good!

Is there any way to give this six stars? I made this for my family, and they couldn't say enough good things about it.  It has a wonderful flavor and depth to it, and is a delicious way to prepare the old standby of chicken.  Looks really good once prepared as well.  Most of the ingredients everybody should have on hand.  Absolutely delicious, will definitely make this again.

I love, love love this chicken salad. Everytime I have made it for a potluck I have gotten rave reviews and I cannot tell you how many times I have had to forward this recipe. I add a teaspoon of curry powder to mine to give it an extra kick. The curry gives it some extra flavor and color. I also toast the pecans in a pan with some oliveoil before I put them in the salad. Very nice!

It was excellent.. I stuffed the holiday chicken salad into homemade puffs and people loved them!  I went with only 1/2 cup of pecans though.

This was really good, better than I expected. I never would have thought to put dried cranberries in my chicken salad. I didn't have green onion so I used red, and I didn't use the green pepper because I don't like it. I'll definitely make this again!

This is a great recipe.  It's not too sophisticated or clever.  Just a great chicken salad.  I added grapes and used dried cherries instead of 1 1/2 cups of cranberries (although I bet the cranberries are great!!).  It added just enough sweet and color.  I also added a little poultry seasoning and some garlic salt. I used enough garlic salt to make it a bit more interesting but not obvious. I also used finely chopped onions as I didn't have green ones on hand. it was all good. Sitting overnight in the fridge def. made it even better.  This is such a great way to extend the cooked chicken I picked up from the market!  Thanks emmaxwell!

Wonderful!  Too good to make only on holidays.  I don't know what seasoned salt so I omit...and I use smoked paprika and more than called for.  Otherwise, it's perfect.

WOW impressive!  I was a little hesistant to make this because the ingredients seemed a little weird but I'm glad I gave it a shot.  This chicken salad was really delicious on bread.  Even my husband complimented me on it.  I made it exactly as written but I omitted the green peppers because I didn't have any.  I will definitely be making this again!

This is the best chicken salad I have ever eaten!  I have made it 3 times since I found this recipe and I can't stop eating it.  Everyone who has tried it has asked for the recipe.  The second time I made it I cut back the cranberries to about 1 cup instead of 1 1/2cups.  I also omitted the celery because I don't like celery, but increased the green onions.  Delicious!

I used rotisserie chicken for this recipe and instead of mayo I used Miracle Whip.  I would certainly make this again.  Update: It's much better the next day.

This was delicious and a big hit at a bridal shower my mom and I hosted! We used 3 rotisserie chickens and 2.5 times the rest of the recipe and it was plenty for about 15 to 20 people (with other foods). We did leave out the green bell pepper and added 1 small apple for a little more sweetness.

Yummeee!!! These were delish! I added more mayo than is called for because we like our chicken salad a bit more moist, but the ingrediants in here are a great mash-up. Very flavorful and tasty. Plus it makes for a pretty display. Great fingerfood to take to a picnic or buffet. This one's staying in my recipe box.

To make this recipe 6 stars, buy a rotisserie chicken and shred it to get your 4 cups of chicken.

WOW!  At first I was skeptical--I would never think to add seasoning salt or paprika to chicken salad.  So glad I followed the recipe--YUM!!!!  The best chicken salad I have ever made!  The only change I made was to replace the bell pepper with halved green grapes.  FANTASTIC and I will make this again and again!

I just finished making this and it is fantastic! I haven't even let it sit in the fridge for the flavors to meld yet... can't wait until then! I took the advice of prior users: Seasoned chicken up before grilling it (garlic powder, salt and pepper, added curry powder as well). Only other changes were omitting the green pepper, adding grapes and sunflower seeds, used walnut instead of pecans (its what I had on hand) and adding a few good size dashes of garlic powder and poultry seasoning to the mayo mix. Really, really great and easy recipe that I will be sharing with many!

I loved this!! My husband was not keen on it, but that is strictly because of what he likes and dislikes... great chicken salad for sandwiches... especially yummy on a croissant.

I made this with leftover turkey from Thanksgiving dinner.  I served it on white bread as sandwiches and my family could not get enough.  I did leave out the green pepper because I thought is sounded a little weird but red bell pepper might be good.  I'd make this again.

This is the best chicken salad ever! I made this for a large party and everyone loved it. The flavors are perfect together. I didn't cube my chicken instead I shredded it to make it go farther. Like others suggested, I added garlic powder and some poultry seasoning to the mayo and I also used a red onion instead of green. Let it sit overnight in the fridge and the next day it was amazing. I did toast the pecans but I couldn't really tell if that made a huge difference to the flavors either way it was great

This is the BEST chicken salad we have EVER tasted anyplace.  I followed the lead of several reviewers and added only 1/2 cup dried cranberries.  I added 1 cup of white grapes, cup in half and 1 tablespoon of drained chopped pimento (for more color).  I made it the day before serving and it was perfect!  I did add garlic and poultry seasoning, bay leaf, etc. to the water when cooking the chicken plus one pkg. of Goya chicken bouillion.  I saved the broth for soup and it too is delicious.  Excellent!!  Highly recommend and will definitely make again and again. (Be sure to toast the pecans!  Makes all the difference in the world.)

I'd give this 10 stars if I could!.  We loved this chicken salad.  I left out the green bell pepper and used red onion instead of green onions.  Added some chopped Fuji apple and some red seedless grapes quartered.  This gave it a nice texture and a little bit if sweetness. Added some garlic powder and a little bit of poultry seasoning to the mayo mixture per other reviewer's suggestions.  Made chicken salad wraps and pita pockets.  I made 50% more (6 cups cooked chicken, etc.) and it was gone the next day. My picky son took some to work, he and a couple of co-workers who tasted said they all agreed it was the best chicken salad they've ever had. I think pecan half's work best otherwise the pieces get lost and you can't really taste them.  Thanks you emmaxwell for this recipe. It's delicious as written, but we loved the added fruit.  Thanks again!  DELISH!!

I'm giving this 4 stars because I didn't make the exact recipe, but think it is a great base.  The only reason I didn't follow the instructions is because I didn't have the ingredients on hand.  I omitted the cranberries and added apple chunks, halved grapes, and used toasted walnuts rather than pecans.  I didn't have the correct spices, but improvised.  I didn't think my husband would be thrilled, but he loved it.  I served it on toasted sesame seed buns and had some a day later with lunch.  I will make it again.

This is awesome!  I made it as is with two small exceptions - used 1 c. dried cranberries (instead of 1.5) and 0.5 c. pecans (instead of 1 c.).  This will be my go-to chicken salad recipe from now on.  YUM!

UPDATE:  I used it the leftover for baked chicken salad sandwiches -- was great heated too!

If I could do this again, I would boil the chicken and then slice it up to save time. I grilled it this time on my George Forman grill and it took forever to cook, plus I had to slice each breast in two because they were too thick. I did cut back on the cranberries (about 1 cup; 1/2 cup isn't enough), added 1 large apple, chopped, and used lowfat mayo. I used 6 chicken breasts and it came out to about 5 1/2 cups - and there was plenty of dressing to cover everything. I'm wondering if I can even cut it back to 3/4 cup mayo and have it be enough. Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing - this recipe was SO good on crackers, and I have plenty left to take for lunch this week! I might try using fat-free mayo next time to see if I can make it even healthier and get away with it. We'll see!

Excellent chicken salad - a faultless combination of flavors.  The only change I made was to use red bell pepper instead of the green.  Loved it.

This is so good... I've made it many times.  I omit the green peppers because I don't  like them, but everything else says the same.  So easy.  The green onions are a must, do not substitute a white onion or sweet onion they are too strong.  Also the chill time is a must- the flavors are not the same without it.

This was delish!!!  I used left over turkey for meat and and  half a cup of mayo and half a cup of vanilla yogurt (for some sweetness).  I ate the turkey salad as a sandwich  with two slices of slightly toasted bread.

This was the first time I hosted a large number of people in my home, and i received SO MANY compliments on this chicken, I feel like a super-star.  To be fair, I never follow recipes exactly or measure ingredients but this recipe was my guideline.  I used all chicken breasts cooked in the crock pot with some broth, then shredded.  I didn't have seasoned salt so I added two cloves of real minced garlic, salt, and thyme instead.  Left out the pecans because one of the guests had a nut allergy.  Otherwise used all listed ingredients- oh, except low-cal miracle whip instead of mayo.  The cranberries were the star of the dish and also looked gorgeous against the green veggies.  Absolutely will make again, thanks!

This is one of our new favorite recipes. My husband doesn't usually get excited about food (much to my disappointment :) ), but he raved about this recipe the first time I made it & now requests it weekly. I also made it for a baby shower this weekend & served it on croissants & it was a big hit! I use a rotisserie chicken for convenience & flavor & leave out the onion & pepper. Thanks for a great recipe!

Yummy!!!  I only used the ingredients that were on hand, so basically chicken, celery, cranberries plus the sauce.  I didn't have seasoning salt so I made my own with what was on hand- I had to leave out a few things.  Anyhow, it was still worth 5 stars!  I'll definitely make it again!!

I cooked the chx in the crock pot with bouillon, garlic powder, and pepper.  Miracle Whip instead of mayo.  Just 1 c cranberries.  Sub grapes for celery.  Omitted onion and bell pepper.

The best chicken salad I have ever eaten!  When making it, I wondered if it had too many ingredients in it however they compliment each other perfectly!  I took this to work and it was a HUGE hit!!  Everyone asked for the recipe.  Will definitely make again!

I follow some of the suggestions to add more flavor to this recipe. I use chicken bbq rub on the chicken breast and bake it in foil before broiling it. for a couple minutes. I added garlic powder to the mayo. I also added some black raisins, chopped Granny Smith apple and some sugar snap peas, as I have them fresh from my yard.  Perfect!

This was EXCELLANT!  I made it for a baby shower..I left out the cranberries and pecans because I am not a fan of either.  I added about a tbls of lemon juice to the mix.  It was GREAT!  Everyone raved about it and there wasn't a drop left in the bowl and several people wanted to get the recipe.  I just made it again to take on our family weekend...my husband is really looking forward to trying it since there was none left for him from the baby shower!  This recipe I am sure to use over and over again!

This recipe is very forgiving, so if don't measure exact amounts, it's still great.  I used left over barbequed chicken made yesterday and used my food chopper to get the pieces small.  Didn't have the greeen pepper, so omitted that.

What a delicious salad!  I served this for a lunch for company on top of chopped romaine with tomatoes on the side.  I chose to grill my chicken the day before and added all but a few thin strips to the mix the night before I served it, placing the strips on top of each serving for appearances.  I added green grapes but fewer green onions to the mix and otherwise left the recipe as written.  I had saved a little rounder of Mike's Signature Pretzel Bread (kept as a personal recipe by an AR member), and it made a perfect light lunch.  Wonderful taste all around!

Excellent! Very good flavor. I have made a few times and changed up the recipe a bit.  I use 1/2 cup of minced celery, 1/4 cup minced green pepper and 1/2 cup of pecan chips and it comes out perfect. Easy, good and tastes even better the next day.

Pretty good, but alittle on the bland side. Maybe Miracle Whip would work better than mayo to add alittle zip.

I have made this several times and it is so absolutely delicious!!! I have substituted walnuts for the pecans just because I prefer them but otherwise have not changed a thing. People always ask me for the recipe. This is definitely a keeper and will be made for many years to come!!!

A delicious salad especially for the summer months, when something cool tastes so good.  I used a little more chicken than the recipe called for to make it good and hearty.  Left out the green pepper.  Made this twice and second time added Granny Smith apples cubed and used walnuts.  Made it kind of like a Waldorf chicken salad.  Was delicious.

Made this for guest at my moms surprise 70th birthday party.  She loves chicken salad, plus it was easy to triple and make for a crowd.  After making it the tasteas wonderful, but the next night at the party it was out of sight!  Do yourself a favor and make it ahead of time, give the flavors a chance to mingle!  I did sprinkle some sugar in mine to give it a hint of sweetness.

Delicious salad particularly on a hot summer evening.  I just added chopped apple and chopped avocado that I had in the frig - this is a 9 out of 10 and a definite keeper.  Hubby loved it.

This is fantastic!  I used a rotisserie chicken because Im super lazy.  I pretty much just "eyeballed"  the measurements (again, because Im lazy).  Its so simple to put this together,  and its so good.  Will be making this again for sure!

This was great! A good mix between the traditional and fruity chicken salads. I added 1/4 of Miracle Whip for extra creaminess and tang and used yellow onion instead of green onion. Next time i will reduce the amount of celery by half, because I am not a big fan.

I followed the directions for this exactly and it was really good. It could have used a bit more flavor but the company I served it to thought it was great. However, I do not think it really yields 12 servings. Maybe 8.

I made this today for my family for lunch.  The only changes i made were to sub in low-fat sour cream for half the mayonnaise, I used red pepper instead of green and I sub'd in walnuts for the pecans because that's what I had.  The end result was absolutely delicious!!! I will definitely make this again!

I have been making this for several years and should have reviewed it before now.  This is a great recipe!  I had a similar dish at a five star hotel and found the recipe here.  Everyone loves it!  The dried cranberries and roasted pecans really make this salad great.  I omit the seasoned salt, though, because we try to limit salt intake.  I like to make it with leftover rotisserie chicken - tastes great and super easy!

A nice take on chicken salad and a great thing to do with rotisserie leftovers. I added turmeric instead of the other spices for the health benefits and it gave it a nice Indian flavor.

absolutely fantastic! my husband scarfs this down as soon as I make it.  It's easy to make all kinds of variations too - adding different dried fruits, veggies, more or less spice, etc.  I made little chicken salad sliders for a potluck and they were a hit!

I cut the recipe in half but only used 1/2 cup cranberries.  By mistake, I used orange-flavored cranberries and I would do so again--wonderful!  Not having green onions, I used some chopped sweet onion.  I almost didn't add the green pepper but am glad I did.  I used spicy season-all but much less and no paprika as I did not want a pink dressing.  I could not use pecans (allergy) but it would taste even better if I could!  Definitely make a day ahead for the flavors to blend.

I made this chicken salad as an appetizer on pita crackers. Everyone loved it. Its a great recipe and I'm looking forward to making it again. I also added some olive oil and adobo to my chicken when I cooked it and it made the salad really flavorful! I added some cayenne to kick it up.

Made this over the weekened, for Chicken Salad sandwiches.  It was ok, but I prefer a little tang or sweetness in my chicken salads.  I had to use about 1/2 a cup more mayo and I added sugar and apple cider vinegar to give a some pizzaz.  Then I liked it a lot.  I couldn't rate it higher than three stars, because it was only fabulous after I changed it up.  I like to rate them as it.

This was excellent chicken salad.  I did have to add an extra 1/4 C of mayo, 1/4 tsp paprika, 1/4 tsp seasoning salt because it was a little to dry for me as written.  My kids and my husband liked this.  I ate left overs the next day and it was still great.

A great blend of flavors.  I used leftover fried chicken which added even more flavor to the salad.  I didn't have green bell pepper so I substituted red.  The paprika I used was smoked.

I love this easy recipe. I substituted cajon season salt and left out the bell pepper and onions because I didn't have any.  It turned out great anyway.  I served it on a bed of romaine leaves.  I reduced the rating by one star because of the high fat content (mayo).

AMAZING! This is probably my 10th time to make it but never rated it before. Coworkers and my family also asked me for the recipe and are in love with it as well. I added some almonds this time so can't wait to taste it tomorrow:) and I always use light miracle whip.

VERY yummy chicken salad!  I did not have any green peppers so I did not add them.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I will for sure make this again but next time I will use a red pepper instead of the green pepper.

I have to admit that when I first made this up earlier today I couldn't understand what all of the fuss was about.  I didn't see how this recipe was anything to really write home about.  But since then it's been sitting in my fridge, letting all of the yummy flavors meld together, and now I think I'm in heaven!  My suggestion is to let this sit either overnight or throughout the day at least - long enough to let the flavors blend.  I left out the green pepper and black pepper and this is absolutely divine.  I'd definately make this one again!

This is by far the best chicken salad I've ever had!!  My husband also enjoyed it.  I even gave some to my brother who said it was "excellent" and had requested for me to make it again.   I chilled it for one hour as directed before serving and it was great, however, I thought it tasted even better the next day when I had it for lunch.  The cranberries gave the salad just the right amount of sweetness.  Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent recipe. I only added half the celery and 1 c of cranberries. Loved it. Nice texture on a large bun. I did add some cajun seasoning to spice it up.

I have been preparing this delicious chicken salad for years now and won't even consider another version for my family. Minor alterations usually include the addition of sweet salad cubes, and sweet or yellow onion if I have no green onion on hand.  
I enjoy this dish by itself, as a sandwich or with Ritz crackers as a snack. One batch lasts us for about a week and it only gets better as the flavors mingle over that time.

Loved it, actually even better the second day. I did use canned chicken breast and I had to use a cup more mayo.

Delicious! I omitted the pecans since I was going to have leftovers and don't like "bloated" nuts. I also used cranraisins which tasted even better the second day. Everyone loved this recipe! Thanks for sharing!

It was very good and definitely tasted better the next day.  I had to add more mayo because my chicken came out very dry.  I served it over some chopped lettuce and it was super delish!

We have always made a similar recipe, but with grapes or mandarin oranges, instead of cranberries.  The cranberries make a nice option, but I prefer the sweetness of grapes and mandarin oranges instead.

This has become my go-to recipe for chicken salad. It is very good exactly as is, but is also a great starting place for making it your own. I often make it without the celery or green pepper, but I add diced onion.

Best chicken salad I've made so far.  I did equal parts of mayo/salad dressing...used grapes..no cranberries or celery.  Put a small sweet onion, toasted pecans, several dashes of poultry seasoning..garlic powder...onion powder...paprika.

I love this - I do make some changes, though. Don't add peppers. Don't add celery - but usually some celery salt for flavor. If not pecans, usually slivered almonds. I also add purple grapes and hardboiled egg as well a Tbsp or 2 of dijon mustard. This is a forgiving recipe so I generally eyeball seasoning and additions. It's ALWAYS delicious and I love serving on leaves of Romaine with a dash of Balsamic. Mmm Mmm good!

OMG, This was sooooooo good. I made chicken salad for the first time last night and this recipe was superb.  A couple things that I changed according to other reviewer's comments and my own preferences is I omitted bell pepper and cranberries but added poultry seasoning (2 teaspoons), more season salt, lots of cayenne pepper to add a kick, sunflower seeds and apples for more crunch and grapes. It used 3 chicken breast and this is how I cooked the chicken breast. This is a sure fire way to have the most tender breast ever. I bought garlic herb breast, lightly dredge them in flower. Heat up a skillet to medium high heat, get it really hot, add 2 tablespoons of butter and approx. 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Place the chicken breast in once all is melted and cook for one minute to a golden brown. Turn over and turn heat down to low. Cover and cook for 10 minutes. Do not open. Do not peek. After 10 minutes, turn the burner off but keep the skillet on the burner for another 10 minutes. Once done, take off burner, let cool and cut up into small pieces. This makes the best most tender chicken you will ever have.

I had high hopes for this based on all the positive reviews. A word of caution about the seasoned salt... maybe it's the brand I used (Lawrys) or the amount.. but it tastes horrible. All I can taste is the Lawrys. I won't be serving it at tomorrow's lunch. A big waste of ingredients. I might try it again without the seasoned salt.

Very good recipe both my fiance and I love this recipe!  I make two changes, I use red bell peppers instead of green and I brown the pecans in a skillet  on the stove and add them after they've cooled.

My family loved this but I used a cut up turkey breast instead and had to leave out the celery and  green pepper because of picky eaters. I also didn't have the green onions so substituted dried minced onion. Even my husband who is not a huge fan of meat mixed up with mayonnaise liked it. I will make this again.

Great Recipe!! But I can't ever cook without "making it my own"!  I used purple onion instead of green onions, deleted the green pepper, added in chopped seedless grapes with the cranberries, toasted some walnuts and chopped, and added prepared Honey Mustard salad dressing and mayo combo. And it is YUMMMMMMY!!  Thanks so much!

I basically followed this recipe to the letter. I used a grocery store rotisserie chicken and I left out the green peppers. My in-laws and husband said it was the best chicken salad they have ever had. Great recipe.

Yum. I have made sooooo many versions of chicken salad and this is by far the best. No need to adjust anything. Two recipes in one- I use the water I boiled the chicken in to make a yummy soup. While the chicken for the salad is cooling for chopping, I chop veggies to add to the broth, throw in some noodles- and now I have made a kick butt chicken salad for dinner tonight and yummy soup for lunch tomorrow!

YUM - I used the meat from a deli rotisserie chicken for ease of prep.  I didn't use the green pepper ad I subbed out the paprika and seasoning salt for curry and a little ground ginger.  Those flavor pairings went terific with the cranberries and nuts!  The reason I did that was because I really liked this chicken salad recipe but I was craving curry!!

10 stars!  This is one great recipe as evidenced with all these positive ratings.   Grape tomotoes or just plain grapes are also good.  Could eat this every week, best chicken salad you will make.  Using rotisserie chicken makes it an easy, fast go to.  Thanks for this delicious recipe.

This is the best chicken salad I have ever eaten!  This will be my new go to recipe.  Love all of the nice crisp vegetables and the sweet cranberries make a nice addition to it.  I also used my leftover roasted chicken to use in this.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!  Will be made over and over in the future.

Delicious!  It is hard to eat just a little bit.  Even my husband, who is not a chicken salad fan, raved about it.  This is definitely a family regular now.

Made this last night for a supper we had at our home tonight.  Changed the servings to 30, and it turned out great.  Followed the recipe closely, and only added a few seedless grapes.  I knew last night when I tasted before putting in the fridge that it was good -- all of my guests agreed tonight.  Only a small cup left.

I left out the gr pepper and onion for my picky kiddos. Next time I think I'll either go ahead and add those or up the celery for more crunch, and will decrease the cranberry a bit. Felt like I was eating out. With sandwiches like this I could bring my lunch everyday!

This is a great recipe that can be played with a lot.  I usually leave out the green pepper and actually prefer it with glazed pecans as they are crunchier and add a sweet taste.  Great as a sandwich or plain!!

I made just enough of this to make one sandwich and thought it was very good.  I didn't add the green pepper, just as a personal preference and  I cut back significantly on the cranberries.  In hindsight, I probably cut them back too far.  Would also add more green onion next time, especially the green tops for a little more color.  I'll definitely be making this one again!  Thank you!

Pretty good although a little heavy on the mayo, walnuts and cranberries. I would cut back on those three ingredients a bit or add in more chicken.

I don't know what more I can say after 595 reviews but...WOW! This is my new favorite chicken salad recipe by far!  These flavors work so well together.  The only modifications I made were that I used half the pecans (only because that's all I had), I used cherry flavored craisins, and I used Jane's Krazy mixed up salt (that was the closest I had to seasoned salt).  Also - I poached the chicken in broth.  I think that kept the chicken from being bland.  I can't wait to make this and serve it with crackers (and some chilled sauv blanc) at the next "girls get together"!

I thought there was too much paprika and seasoning salt in this recipe.  I used Season-All, which is red in color, and when I mixed it and the red paprika into the mayo, it turned the mayo red, which made for a funky looking chicken salad.  And if I make it again I think I will use Miracle Whip instead of mayo.  But it was still pretty good.

Love this recipe!  I have made it several times and even those who don't care for chicken salad really like it.  Made the recipe exactly as written.  Definitely needs to chill for at least an hr so it's good and cold to taste the best.  I always serve on croissants.

One of my favorite salads. I've made it verbatim and it's wonderful but in addition, a few variations I've tried are adding halved grapes, mandarin oranges, adding sugar to the mayo, taking out the onions and peppers and substituting candied walnuts for the pecans. You really can't mess up this recipe.

My family absolutely loves this chicken salad recipe. The only thing we added was about 4 tsp. of sugar to add a little sweetness to balance the tart from the cranberries. I made this for our church's brunch where we served on croissants and received tons of compliments. Now whenever we have a pot-luck, this is always requested for me to bring.

Everyone LOVED this recipe, and many people asked for the recipe!  It is easy enough to make (even for me, who is a beginner cook) and is absolutely delicious.. Don't take anything out of the recipe!  Even people who said they didn't like celery or cranberries, LOVED it!!

Great salad as is!  Easy to adjust for personal preference.  Just remember, you need something crunchy, something sweet, something tart and some nuts.  Use what you like.  The spices are spot on, though.  Fantastic!

This was a hit at a work pot luck.  The only change I made was to cut the cranberries in half.  1/2 - 3/4 cups is plenty.  Very good the next day!

I will cut back on the cranberries next time I make it (probably to about 3/4 c or 1 c), but otherwise this was very tasty.  Great way to use up leftovers from a roasted chicken.

I hate left over poultry!  I'll eat a turkey sandwich on Thanksgiving night, that's it. Maybe chicken soup the first day after the roast chicken BUT this salad is just the best.  Thank you!  But only the day after the roast chicken because there isn't any left. LOL

This chicken salad was realy fab!!  I did add some extra seasoning, etc...I know, I know, one should judge according to the exact recipe, but unless it's not baking, a savory recipe can be made according to each taste.  So anyway, I added about 1/2 c. of finely chopped red onion.  Instead of the seasoning salt I subbed Adobo all purpose seasoning (Goya), some hot sauce to taste (just a bit to give it some zing in the background), 1/2 lime juice, walnuts (toasted) instead of the pecans, red bell peppers instead of the green (cause I didn't have any).  It was realy very Good.

I added just a squirt of dijon mustard, and really gave it a nice flavor. I used grapes instead cranberries. It was delicious!

I have never made chicken salad before, but found this recipe and gave it a try since I had a rotisserie chicken we didn't eat for dinner the night before and needed to use for something.  I substituted grapes for the cranberries and left out the green pepper b/c I didn't have one on hand.  I must say this is the best chicken salad I have ever had, hands done!  I will definitely be making this one again.  I think the rotisserie chicken makes a difference.

It was easy and very flavorful.  I tried recipe with left over bar-b-qued chicken so i omitted the cranberries and pecans.  It was still a success.

This is a great recipe-- too much cranberry for my taste, so I reduced to 1 cup.  Go heavy on the pepper and I also added a hearty pinch of cayenne.  Yum.

I made this recipe the same day I received it.  It is so-o-o-o good.  I did substitute Old Bay seasoning for the season salt.  And I didn't have the celery, but it was still good!!!

Definitely a 5-star recipe.  I made this exactly as written.  To the poster who said it was bland, I don't know what you did but this is anything but, and I love spicy.  The seasoned salt and paprika give it the punch and don't omit the craisins; they are what really set this recipe off.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I put mine on a multi-grain wrap and it was terrific!

This a wonderful recipe and everyone I have served it to loves it!  I do make one change to it that I think would help those who think it is too bland.  I us Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise and it it much better.

One star is being VERY generoous. This was not good at all...no one to whom I served it liked it. I peronally don't like chicken salad with mayo, and I dislike celery, but others who were going to be eating this do, so I made it as wrtten. The consensus of everyone was that it was completely bland and tasteless relative to many other chicken salads we had all had. I could certainly delete and substitute ingredients, but that would make it a completely different recipe, so since I'm rating this one, I'll leave it at that. My recommendation is to look somewhere else if you want a tasty chicken salad recipe.

My mother-in-law is not a chicken salad eater, and can be relatively picky - and she LOVED this.  I made 1/2 the amount to try - and I got one serving, she had the rest on greens or in wraps within days - and is now adding grapes and cranberries to all her wraps :)  I did sub a couple things - I used non-fat plain greek yogurt instead of mayo, to save some fat cals and added a bit of chili powder since I couldn't find the paprika.  Also used dry roasted almond slices vs pecans since they're a favorite here!

I have no idea what all the fuss is about this recipe.  Somehow, it was extremely bland.  The only flavor I could (hardly) taste was paprika.

Very yummy!  I is a touch bland, but I added about a tablespoon of mustard, garlic salt instead of seasoning salt and toasted the pecans first.  I also stir in the pecans right before eating.  I don't all the pecans in at once because they will get soft.

BEST chicken salad I've ever had!!  Followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't have seasoned salt so I used Mrs. Dash and regular salt - AMAZING recipe!  I also used a rotisserie chicken as suggested by someone else - fantastic!  Will be making this again!

this was really good. I took this to a pitch-in and everyone wanted the recipe. I did not use cranberries, instead I used purple grapes cut into quarters. I also added poultry seasoning and a little garlic powder. I rolled this into flour tortillas to make for easy serving. A HUGE HIT.

My husband absolutely loved this, but I personally just thought it was okay. I had a wonderful chicken salad sandwich at a restaurant years ago that was fabulous and have been looking for a recipe that is just as good...but this wasn't. I have high standards now, I guess, for chicken salad.

Ok, I don't do chicken salad, even the boring kind you get at a deli, but I had this leftover chicken and found this recipe, I was drawn by the cranberries and pecans, can't go wrong there...well, guess what I've turned into?  A chicken salad person!  This will be a staple in my home from now on.  Delicious and oh so tasty.  I'm excited to read its even better the next day, can't wait for lunch tomorrow!  I will also be adding this to my party buffets from now on, thank you!

This was just okay for us - certainly better than some restaurant chicken salads we have had, but not as good as the fruited curry chicken salad recipe on this site.  I'm hoping it will be better tomorrow after the flavors have had time to mingle some more.

Yum! Made a few changes: used KFC chicken, omitted green bell peppers, and used pine nuts in place of pecans. Quite possibly the best chicken salad I've had!

I have been making this chicken salad for several years now.  I have used the same ingredients, but different measurements.  I tried the ingredient measurements in this recipe and TRUST me.  My husband said it was the best that I have ever made.  Thank you for this version!  I will be making this again.

This is really good. I adjusted the ingredients to my own taste and I also added about 1T honey mustard.  It's very good on a croissant and if you chop everything up super small it is great for a cracker spread!

Actually, my mom wanted me to try to copy Corner Bakery's DC chicken salad. I was looking for a base recipe when I found yours. 
Great recipe. I didn't have cranberries, so i subbed in some raisins and a fruit/nut mix of walnuts, almonds and cranberries (part of the premade mix). I also used Miracle Whip instead of mayo...just one a healthier note. 
To make it more DC chicken like, I added some chopped apples, skipped the green onions and peppers, and added some minced ginger. It was just like the real thing! (maybe even better)

My friend and I are in charge of a mother~daughter tea at our church.We were looking for the perfect chicken salad recipe and we have found it!!
She made three different kinds of chicken salad  and everyone picked this one to be the one we serve. Not only does it taste delicious, but it  also makes a very good presentation. It is very 
colorful and tastes as good as any i have ever eaten.

This is a wonderful, colorful salad served on mesclun or spring greens.  I cut back on the mayo to taste and found that toasting the pecans really brought out their taste in the finished salad.

This turned out awesome!  I made it following the recipe almost exactly, just added a little bit of apple.  I then refrigerated it overnight, and the next morning before putting it on sandwiches I ran it through the food processor since it had pretty good size chunks and wouldn't spread too easily.  AMAZING!  This is something that is so nice to keep in the fridge for quick snacks and meals.

This recipe has become a family favorite at just about any of our gatherings! Since it is easy to put together ahead of time, transport, and assemble at the last-minute, we use it for camping trips and afternoon luncheons alike.  I often add grapes or diced apples, and I absolutely love the combination of flavors in this recipe.

This is the best chicken salad ever!  I like some other reviewers made a couple changes. I added about a tablespoon of mayonnaise. I also substituted halved grapes for the green pepper. I think next time I will omit the green onion all together. All in all it makes for a delicious chicken salad.

I made this recipe using 1/2 amount each of dried cherries and dried cranberries plumped for 15 min in hot water and drained on paper towel. I did not use green pepper as I didn't have any. I prbly used a little more mayo as I had more than 4 cups chicken in the end, but very good recipe. Everyone loved it !!

I love this recipe!  I made this for my co-workers in the jewelry store where I work.  We get really busy during the holidays and this recipe was great for everyone to grab a quick sandwich that was really tasty.  The cranberries definitely gave it a holiday feel and everyone wanted the recipe.  I will definitely make this again for my family and my co-workers.

Not bad, though I would have loved to have had more mayonnaise...but trying to steer clear from so much of the condiment.

I did make some alterations, no celery stick, but added light amount of celery salt. but everything else was easy to put together and chill. Delightful.

Made this yesterday to have it ready for company today.  What a hit!  Did add craisins, white onion and I toasted the pecans.  No green pepper.  If I had one hesitancy it would be to cut down on the seasoned salt.  Too salty for my taste, but certainly did not ruin it at all.  Will make again for sure.

Based on previous reviews stating it was somewhat bland I made a couple of substitutions to spice it up.  Instead of plain mayonnaise I used the spicy sweet mayo from my Kickin Turkey Burger recipe on this site.  In addition I added a little pineapple for additional sweetness.  The result was delicious.

Add to cooked small pasta & it makes a wonderful pasta salad!  Left out the seasoned salt.  Regular salt.  Added grapes--pineapple would be a great addition.  Toasted almonds instead of pecans.  MAN!  It is good!!

I was always afraid of chicken salad.  However since I was forced to try it I now find myself on pursuit for the best chicken salad sandwiches in restaurants.  Well...this beats all the restaurants.  This is SERIOUSLY the BEST chicken salad I've ever had!  I just emailed the recipe to my mom it was so good.  Thanks for sharing!  Now I can get my skeptical boyfriend hooked on them as well.  He would only try it if I made it.  Finally a good recipe I can hook him on!

Great simple recipe. I cut back on the mayo a bit and used only enough to keep everything together. I added a lot of pepper to mine to give it a little kick and it turned out great! Will be repeating this for lunches in the future!

If I were rating this based solely on my own opinion, I'd say this were 3.5 or 4 stars-but this is a serious crowd pleaser!! This has a lot of great crunch and is really versatile. I've put it on multigrain bread, walnut berry bread. Everyone LOVES it! Based on the reaction I get when I make it, it's a definite keeper.

I don't like onion or peppers, so instead I add in cucumber, grapes and granny smith apples and I serve it over a spring mix salad.  I also sometimes use almonds instead of pecans.  I make a huge batch one night and use it for 3-4 days worth of lunches.  Tasters better the next day and is very filling.  Fantastic recipe.

This was great for a light summery dinner. The serving size seemed off though. We used two chicken breasts and it made about 4 servings. I also added finely chopped carrots, which I thought was a nice addition.

Omitted the pecans because I was making this for a friend and she doesn't like them.  I brined then grilled some chicken breasts because I thought that would give the chicken a better flavor.  I also added just a little garlic powder.  I made with lite mayo, and also added a little lite sour cream.  We both thought this turned out great.  Definitely made the night before to give the flavors time to develop.

I made this this morning and it is all gone, totally yummy. Followed exactly. Then added 1 cup drained and chopped up pineapple. We cant stand grapes in a salad, as some suggested. My mother always put them in chicken salad (in the 50s), and I always disliked it.  We had the salad in rollups, on plain flour tortillas spread with cream cheese and  added shredded lettuce, our new favorite. Thanks for the great recipe.

It was good as is. I did however sub slivered almonds in place of the pecans and added some crushed ramen noodles for a nice bit of crunchy texture. Also subbed mandarin oranges in place of the cranberries and it became amazing!!!

Loved this salad.  Though I did make a few changes.  I'm not a celery fan so I left out that and the bell pepper.  Added 2 chopped apple along with a tablespoon of dijon mustard and 1 teaspoon of sweet curry powder.  I saved the paprika to sprinkle on top.  It was even better the next day.

I hate when people rate a recipe that they haven't made but that is just what i'm doing now.  This sounds like a terrific recipe.  I have one similar to this and have actually submitted it to this site for approval.  May I suggust adding a teaspoon of curry powder instead of paprika to the mayo - it will be amazing and just the touch of flavor needed to take it over the top!!!

I wish I could give this 10 stars!! I made it the day before we ate it and it was amazing.
I don't normally like celery or green pepper but I decided to add both anyway.  I am so glad I did, cause it is perfect! I'll never make another chicken salad recipe again!

I made this with Morningstar's Veggie Chicken Strips (because I am vegetarian, haha). It was AWESOME. I also added red onion, a little more seasoning salt, halved grapes, and used toasted unsalted almonds in place of the pecans (just didn't have them on hand).

This is fantastic. I'm a senior center director and made this when I had a potluck picnic. Not only did it get rave reviews but I was asked repeatedly for the recipe, which is a huge complement from these women who bring amazing generational dishes. I also add poultry seasoning and garlic powder. Plus, I used a cooked rottiserie chicken from costco. It helped cut down on time and enhanced the flavor. Everyone loved it!

I followed the recipe exactly as directed and it felt like something was missing. Too many cranberries maybe and not enough seasoning. My husband hated it, bit I thought it was pretty good. I baked bonesless skinless chicken breasts in the oven at 375 for about 20 minutes with the pan half way full of whole milk, salt, pepper, and whole cloves of garlic with the ends cut off. It made the chicken really tender. I think next time I will omit about 2/3 of the cranberries and add some extra seasonings.

My favorite chicken salad ever!  Don't leave out anything, you might not like individual ingredients, but together they all blend so perfectly.

we LOVED this recipe. we substituted sliced almonds for the pecans as I'm not a pecan fan and still thought it was wonderful. I agree with another reviewer that it seemed to get better after a day or two. will definitely keep using this one - thanks for sharing!

I loved this salad. It's truly as good as everyone else has said it is.  There are a lot of ingredients so I pulled a few out the second time I made it just for something different.

I've been using this recipe for over  6 years now and can't get enough of it!  Over the years I've made it several different ways....but only because I didn't have some of the exact ingredients on hand.  It's a VERY forgiving recipe when it comes to improvising with items on hand!  I use the canned chunk white chicken breast alot because it's easier to open a can than cook chicken.  I also use light/nonfat mayo and sometimes do a mixture of mayo and sour cream.  The cherry flavored cranberries are excellent in this recipe as well.  This chicken salad is so good that it's hard to take the time to put it on crackers, lettuce or bread....I usually just eat it with a spoon!

cranberries are a nice change from grapes. Loved this recipe.  I used some leftover KFC to make the 4 cups along with boiled chicken and it added some extra crunch.

In my opinion this is a year round recipe. I loved the cranberries in it, its a nice change from red grapes. I omitted the bell pepper and pecans. I will definitely make this again.

YUM! :)  Definitely a keeper!  I only used about 3/4 c. of dried cranberries/craisins and then next time would probably lessen the amount of paprika a little bit.

This is fantastic! I love chicken salad and this has to be one of the best I've ever tried.  I didn't change anything except omitted the bell peppers because I don't like them and used Jane's Crazy Salt because I was out of seasoned salt.  
An excellent way to use up leftover roast chicken!  Thanks for the recipe :)

I LOVE this salad! I leave out the bell pepper but add about 1/2 cup diced green apple. I use some curry, dill, and a bit of Splenda to season the light mayo. I omit the season salt (none on hand). We stuff this into whole wheat pita pockets. It rivals the chicken salad we get from the deli!

I own a tea room and have begun using this recipe there with only a few minor tweaks. People rave about this chicken salad. I serve mine on an awesome marble rye bread and people compare it to heaven. Seriously. =) Since I make this for large quanities (I prepare it in batches for 100 servings) I don't 100% measure my ingredients. But I do throw in a couple extra spatulas full of mayonaise, I use a cranberries and goldens mix instead of just straight cranberries, and I don't use the paprika or green pepper. I also use sliced almonds instead of the pecans to make it a little different. Other than that I follow the recipe and enjoy the feedback. =)

I have never given a review here, but had to comment on this wonderful recipe! I made it last night as my hubby & I wanted something light for dinner. This was fabulous! The flavors compliment each other nicely and the texture is perfect. Ordinary chicken salad will never cut it with me anymore!  Thanks, Elaine.

I will never look for another chicken salad recipe again. I use this as sandwich filling and it's so good and so addicting. Everyone feels like they could eat a hundred of them! Tastes great in a good croissant or even sliced bread. So pretty too!

This recipe is great and very versatile.  I wanted a main dish salad rather than something on bread/lettuce, so I added some cooked orzo pasta (1 cup prior to cooking) and it was a perfect addition.  This salad still tastes great 2 days later.  I added halved grapes like some others suggested.

My husband thinks chicken salad should be chicken and mayo...and he loved this, and so did I!  I did omit the green pepper, they're not my thing.  I used Cran*Raisins (cherry flavor) and loved it!  I'll never make chicken salad any other way!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Excellent flavor!  I made this the night before my in-laws were visiting.  We had it for lunch the next day on croissants.  I was a little skeptical about all of the paprika, but it tasted great.  I used half miracle whip and half real mayo as I think someone else suggested.  The next day I thought it was a little dry, so I added extra.  I also used toasted pecans per another review.  Definitely make it ahead--- it is better!

I usually like more simple foods so the cranberries and pecans almost made me decide against trying this recipe - but, I'm THRILLED I tried it.  It is FABULOUS!  I didn't have seasoning salt so I omitted that as well as the black pepper.  I don't think it needs either since it was YUMMY without it.  I definitely think this should be refrigerated for more than 1 hour as suggested.  Overnight would be best.  I served mine with a few salad greens in pita pockets - what a beautiful meal.  Thanks!!!

I cut this recipe in half to make this a quick lunch.  I used cherry flavored crasins, which were the best part of this recipe. I served half on tortillas and half over toast but other than the crasins, they were rather bland.  It needs some spices and maybe I'll play around with it in the future.

I served this on croissants for an autumn birthday luncheon.  So very delicious, eveyone loved it immensely. The dried cranberries are a perfect addition and go so well with the chicken. Thank you for posting this wonderful recipe.

I never thought of adding dried cranberries and pecans.  We really enjoyed this.  Nice change of pace from plain old chicken salad.

This is delicious!!  I only had Miracle Whip (instead of mayo) and thought this was a wonderful chicken salad.

This recipe is OUTSTANDING!!! I used only half the cranberries the recipe called for, and added about 2 tablespoons more mayo.

What a recipe!!! YUM! YUM!

This is frequently recommended on the buzz - and I found myself craving it, one day - even though I had never tasted it (= I normally use a rotisserie chicken to make this with. I do leave out the celery and bell pepper - because I am not a fan of either, raw - and add a teaspoon of poultry seasoning. Mom and I have been really enjoying this chicken salad! I made it for a Thanksgiving potluck at work, last week, so I used turkey breast, in place of the chicken. I served it on mini croissants. Ben is still raving about it (= I want to try it as lettuce wraps, next! Thank you for sharing!

My go-to Chicken Salad Recipe! Great blend of sweet and nutty with crunch and texture. I do used canned chicken when I have to, but it is OUTSTANDING with "real" chicken. Toast the pecans...it really puts it over the edge!

I made this for, a ladies' night and everyone really enjoyed it! I substituted chopped granny smith apples for the celery and added dashes of curry, poultry seasoning, and garlic powder. I toasted the pecans (cook at 350 for 5 minutes). I omitted the bell pepper, and reduced green onion to 1 only. I also used slightly less than a cup of pecans, as I just thought less might be better. Give this recipe a try and tweak away! My guests really liked the flavor of the curry.

Used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 miracle whip, grapes instead of cranberries, no green onions or bell pepper and 1/4 tsp pepper.  AWESOME!!  Family loved and it was a nice red color from Paprika.

This chicken salad is top notch!  I will make this again and again.  I followed the recipe and the only thing I did differently was add a little miracle whip.  You MUST add the green bell pepper.  At first I was not going to, but then I tried it with a spoonful and fell in love.  The green pepper adds a wonderful flavor and you would never know it was a green pepper.  I'm not the biggest green pepper fan, but I am with this recipe!

LOVED this.  Didn't have green pepper but did use red onions and added poultry seasoning and onion powder.  Served on a bed of lettuce with homemade hamburger buns to make sanwiches.  Yummy!!

This was soooo yummy! I am hooked. I used a rotisserie chicken from Costco to save time and it turned out awesome. I used old bay seasoning for the seasoning salt because thats all I had and it was perfect.

Wonderful!  It is better if left overnight; we had some right away and then we added chopped dried apricots and about a cup of frozen green peas, and it was even better the next day!  Am excited to make this when we have weekend company to have on hand, THANKS for the recipe!

Everyone loves this recipe! The only thing I changed was adding some sliced green grapes, using a rotisserie chicken for convenience and omitting the green pepper - delicious! I make this every year for our Mother's Day brunch and there are hardly any left overs.

Fabulous!!  I'd like to make it again having all the ingredients on hand-I didn't have green onions, so I used a small amount of red onion.  It was still very good with this change, so I'm sure it will be amazing with the right ingredients!

I often make this without bell peppers, paprika or seasoning salt. Sometimes I add red grapes or substitute them for the Craisins. Good with walnuts too.

Wonderful chicken salad; good mix of sweet and salty.  I didn't have any green pepper, but it was still delicious.  My husband asked if I could make more for him to take for lunch all week.

Truly terrific! I omitted the green pepper (won't next time) and added poultry seasoning to the mayo...I served this in wraps (spinach wraps) that were lined with baby spinach and had a bit of Maille mustard smeared on the inside. Absolutely wonderful. Oh, and I cut down a bit on the cranberries and I cut them up to be smaller (husband has a "thing" about fruit in food) and my kids and husband all raved and gobbled it down!

This just didn't work for me. It was way too many things in a chicken salad! The weight of all the ingredients, just made the chicken fall right apart. I admit I am a purist when it comes to chicken salad and just prefer a lite dressing with a couple of vegetables, but I wanted to try something different. My grocery store did not carry dried cranberries and only cherries. I do not recommend subbing the cherries they are just too large and more sweet. I only added half to. The dried fruit and nuts just did not work for me. The color also was no where near the picture and was more like a "brown red," by the next day, which I also did not care for! This tasted allright when it was first made, but was watered down and even more oddly colored the next day. Maybe, it was the cheeries? I don't know. I will stick with a simpler chicken salad where the chicken is the dominant ingredient.

I will never make plain chicken salad again.  This is amazing.  I omitted green pepper.  I also didn't have green onion so used minced onion flake.  I eat this with pita chips.  I also didn't have any pecans but did have pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds so threw those in.  It was absolutely delicious.  The cranberries is what makes it!

I did not care for this! The dried cranberries sounded so good (since I like grapes in chix salad), but it wasn't that appealing. The taste was very bland besides the cranberries which were too overpowering.

This chicken salad is excellent.  I had to leave out the green peppers and seasoning salt because I didn't have any, but other than that I followed it.  I used marinated, grilled bonless skinless chicken breasts.  It tastes even better as it sits in the fridge.

I love making and serving this--it's deliciously healthy! I usually leave out the green pepper and add halved grapes and chopped apple (sometimes I'll throw in a little red pepper, because it compliments the fruit better). I use slivered almonds because my hubby doesn't care for pecans, and usually only about 1/2 teaspoon of paprika because I don't like the pink look it gives the salad; I prefer a whitish salad. Serve in pita pockets stuffed with fresh spinach leaves and a fruit smoothie--a wonderfully healthy summer meal!

This chicken salad is excellent! My guests RAVED that it was the best chicken salad they had ever had. I followed the suggestion of others to mix the seasonings in the mayo first. I also used the mini-bell peppers (the kind that come in a large package with red, yellow and orange peppers) for extra color. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe! My guests asked for a copy before leaving.

Tastiest chicken salad that I've eaten (and made) in ages! Infact, I do think that the 'Heavenly' Chicken Salad would be quite a fitting name for this salad! =D  I cut the recipe to 1 since I was making this for myself to take to work for lunch ... as it turns out my family's very cross with for me making so little ... so I'm going to be making 'lots' more of this tonight! I did make a few changes because I didn't have a few ingredients on hand ... the changes were to sub dried currants for dried cranberries, chopped walnuts for chopped pecans and red onions for green onions. Also I used smoked paprika instead of normal paprika ... but that's coz I love the smoked one over the normal one. =) Didn't make any other changes to ingredients/proportions. Also, since this was for lunch, I popped it into the fridge to chill overnight. Thank you emmaxwell for this stunning and yummilicious recipe! =D

This was the first time I made chicken salad with nuts and fruit.  I am so sorry it has taken me so long to do this !!  Awesome recipe.   

The only changes I made were 1) used miracle whip..my preference over mayo and 2) used dried cherries because I thought I had bought cranberries. I can read but was obviously in a hurry when shopping.   I was concerned about the sweetness of the cherries but it worked OK! Thanks !!!!

Used sliced almonds toasted instead of pecans because its what I had.  Left the green pepper out due to preference.  AWESOME!  Added Garlic powder and LOVED IT!  Thanks for the YUMMMMY recipe.  Easy, fast and pleases a crowd.

Great for left over chicken.  I was thinking I could use some of the cherry-cranberry-pecan pizazz instead of the cranberry and pecans.

This chicken salad is wonderful!  I boiled the chicken in chicken broth and shredded it.  I, like many other reviewers, omitted the green pepper because I didn't have one, but next time will try it with yellow pepper.  I also took the advice from some reviewers and added garlic powder and poultry seasoning to the mayo mixture.  I served it on croissants.  I wouldn't change a thing next time except add the pepper because I am curious to see how it tastes with it.

This recipe is full of win! I really didn't need a new chicken salad recipe, as I truly loved my go to, but this is my new favorite! I shredded the chicken as it makes it easier to scoop onto pita chips and added a tad bit more onion, as I love onion.  So good! Thanks!

The best chicken salad I have ever eaten! I followed the recipe exactly and made it for wraps for my stepmother's wedding shower and it was a HUGE hit! I ate it for lunch for a week after the shower and it kept really well!

SOOO GOOD! I am not even a huge fan of chicken salad but I made this for a baby shower gathering and it was a big hit. I did a test run and found that it tasted the best after the third day. Love all the flavors mingled together. I did add more mayo to the mix just to make it a little more "saucy" but the salad looked beautiful on croissants and tasted just as good as it looked! Thanks for sharing!

I made this chicken salad with a few changes based on previous reviews and it was amazing!  I used a garlic Rotissere chicken.  Used only 6 oz. of crasins.  I also sauteed both the celery and onions  in butter first and added red grapes cut in half.  I also roasted the pecans before in butter and salt.  It was one of the best recipes I have had from this site.

Very tasty recipe. I only modified the recipe in a couple of places and loved the overall idea of this recipe. First, I didn't have dried cranberries, but did have dried cherries--totally delicious too. Second, I hate green pepper, left it out--fine without it. Finally, I watched one of my favorite cooking shows recently and the host suggested cutting the mayo with another liquid to keep the mayo from being too "gloopy" and I tried her idea on this recipe. I added about 2 tablespoons of chicken stock to the mayo and it did make the overall consistency much creamier than it would have been, and I liked it. Other things my tv chef suggested to thin the mayo and could easily work in this recipe: white wine, milk, or water.

This chicken salad was so yummy!  I took the advice of other reviewers and added garlic powder and poultry seasoning to the mayonnaise mixture.  I served the chicken salad in toasted pitas, and the whole thing turned out wonderfully.  I will definitely be making this again!

I tried this tweaked: omitted onions, bell pepper, and pecans, added a granny smith and grapes...but didn't like the mayo dressing. So then tried it with a sour cream and fresh dill dressing...still didn't like it. So I think I just don't like chicken salad. As far as they go, this is probably a good recipe, and I'm just a lousy judge.

Great! If you are not a fan of mayo (and want to increase the nutritional value) you can use 1 cup of nonfat plain yogurt instead - sounds strange but works!

I love Arby's chicken salad and this was pretty close. I took it to a family picnic and everyone thought it was great and requested the recipe. I did use 1/2 mayo and 1/2 plain yogurt since we're not all mayo fans. Still was fantastic.

I really didn't like the taste of the paprika. It ruined it for me. I was quite disappointed as I didn't realize how much it would alter the flavor. It was very expensive to make and I couldn't eat it. I gave it four stars since maybe if you like the taste of paprika you will  like the salad-for me it was just too overpowering. If I had left that out I think it would have been very good.

I really enjoyed this chicken salad recipe. I used Craisins and then used toasted walnuts instead of the pecans. Also, I left out the green pepper.  Otherwise kept the recipe as written. 

Delicious and a nice change of pace from my usual chicken salad recipe.

I'm not a big chicken salad fan, but I like this one due to all the different tastes and textures.  As many suggested, I used a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store.  I also omitted the paprika because I didn't have any but used a half teaspoon of curry powder instead.  Also substituted almonds for the pecans and cucumber for the green pepper.  And instead of a full cup of mayo, I used a half cup of Lite Miracle Whip and a half cup of Greek yogurt.  Seasoned with plain salt and black pepper.  Very tasty and will definitely make again.

Awsome Chicken Salad just what I have been looking for.  Also Added about a cup of sliced grapes and substitued sunflower seeds for the pecans. Simply Amazing. 3 good size chicken breast will give you just the right amount of chicken as well. I seasoned them with a little garlic salt and some seasoning salt for some extra flavor.  Served them on some big ole butter croissants.

EXCELLENT! - I should have rated/reviewed this recipe about a year ago as I have served this now several times and always get lots of compliments.  The only change I make is to buy a rotisery chicken and shred it (vs. cubed chicken breasts).  It's a lot easier than cutting up chicken and cooking it and I personally prefer the consistancy of shredded chicken in chicken salad.  I also serve it on croissants with a little green leaf or bib lettuce for added crunch and color.

I used chopped almonds instead of pecans (only because that is what I had in the cupboard) and left out the peppers... this was FANTASTIC!  I love the crunch that the nuts add along with the sweet and chewy from the dried cranberries!  Great flavor too!

This is really really good.  I left out the pecans because I don't like them, used red bell pepper instead of green and I used 1 cup craisins instead of 1 1/2 cups.  Makes great sandwiches, and I used a spinach tortilla wrap stuffed with baby greens and the chicken salad for an awesome lunch.  Definitely a keeper!

This was really good chicken salad and it just got better the longer it was kept.  Great on bread or tortillas/pitas.  Used walnuts instead of pecans and they added a nice crunch, with the little bit of tart/sweet from the cranberries.  Yellow onions in place of green worked fine, and the paprika gives it a reddish color.  Overall, just about anyone will enjoy this salad.

I liked the original recipe, but have changed it quite a bit with every time I make it. Every time I make it, my family comes up with something they would like more of or less of in it. They must still like it pretty well--I've made it several times, and have never had to throw any out.

This Holiday Chicken Salad is the finest recipe ever made.  I love to make great presentations with very tasty food. Instead of using chicken, I use turkey breast that I roasted myself.  Not the deli kind!  However, you will need to add about 1/4 cup more mayonnaise.  The turkey is a little drier...but much better.  I had cut back my seasoning salt to half and diffently no paprika. Use the exact amounts of celery, gr. onions, gr. bell pepper, cranberries and nuts to this recipe.  When I had served this to my guests at my great nieces baby tea shower in homemade cups,presentation was beautiful and most of all delicious!  Allrecipe...you had out done yourself again.  Note:  When serving the Holiday Chicken (turkey) Salad in the Phyllo dough cups, don't fill until ready to serve.

very  good chicken salad. But i would cut back on the dried cranberries.  The first time I served it, i had wheat bread, but the wheat bread over powered the salad. Now I served it on hawaiian sweet bread.

This chicken salad was the best!  I made it for a family party and everyone loved it.  I had to email the recipe to everyone the next day.  Next time I will be sure to double the recipe, since there were no leftovers!  Thanks for the new addition to my recipe collection.

I really loved this chicken salad, but my 5 year old had a hard time eating it.  My 8 year old complied, but opted for something different the next time I brought it out.  But, I would definitely make it again for adults and company.

This is fabulous. I added a handful of sunflower seeds and went half and half with mayo and Miracle Whip. My husband just loved this. I'll be making it for my girlfriends when they come to visit next month.

My daughter does not like chicken salad, I made this recipe and had her take a bite not telling her what it was. She said dad that is really good, what is that? I told her chicken salad and she didn't believe it, very good recipe.

I love this recipe! I usually use left over Costco Rotissire Chicken.  And I do make a few changes.  I omit the bell pepper (don’t feel that it goes with this recipe), I only use half the cranberries and add between ½ cup and ¾ cup green apple, and as far as the pecans go, if I have them, I add them, but I have also used sliced almonds as well as walnuts.  Oh and if I have any sometimes I add about half cup sliced grapes. I love it and my kids love it.

I made this chicken salad exactly as written (used low-fat mayo) and it was wonderful, a delicious combination of soft, chewy and crunchy textures!  A big thank you to those who suggested it was better the second day; I made it the night before it was needed, tasted a little bit right away, then tasted it again after chilling overnight.  The flavors definitely kicked up a notch.  I really liked the fact that everything was just lightly coated with the mayonnaise, rather than being overloaded with it.  Very nice proportions!  I served it at a party in a buffet with other "nibble foods" (spinach spread, cheese cubes, bbq-sauced cocktail meatballs, crackers, party bread slices, etc.) along with wine and fruit spritzers, and the entire bowl of this chicken salad disappeared!!  I had made it with the women in mind, but was truly surprised at how often even the big, beefy guys went back for more!  The second time I made it, I sprinkled seasoned salt on chicken tenderloins and grilled them, then cut them into cubes (didn't add any more seasoned salt into the mayo), toasted the pecans, added about 3/4 tsp of curry powder into the mayo, used red bell pepper instead of green, and increased the cranberries to two full cups (we love the mix of curry and fruit).  Either way, it was sooo good!!  This will definitely be a staple at our home now, because it is special enough for a party, and so much better than "plain old" chicken salad for any other day.  Thank you so much for the recipe!!

Really good recipe.  I used mayo with olive oil to make it a little healthier and bought one of the roasted chickens at Walmart which worked great and saved a lot of time.  My husband and I loved this and will definitely make again.

I had all the ingredients on hand (except the green peppers) so made this for a light Sunday supper this weekend and it was very good.  A fruit 
salad, fresh rolls and a light rose wine and we were all set.

SO good. Probably the best chicken salad I ever had. Didn't have celery on me, so omitted it, but put in some celery salt. Substituted the dried cranberries for raisins, which was VERY good. Instead of pecans, I chopped up a mix of almonds and walnuts (mainly almonds though), and used red and green chili peppers instead of the green bell peppers, which I think is better regardless. I would use these ingredients again, b/c they make for an excellent salad.
We ate the salad the following day, to allow flavours to blend. Will definitely make this again and again. :) Thank you Emma!

I omitted the green peppers and added 1 can of mandarin oranges (drained) and I also added about 1/2 tsp dried Tarragon, 2 tsp. taragon vinegar, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp onion powder & 1/2 tsp curry powder and cut the amount of paprika in half.  I also omitted the seasoning salt and just used sea salt.  I also added 1/2 cup sour cream and 3/4 cup mayonaise (real, not salad dressing!!!) It was fabulous!!  Fresh and colorufl

I was a little nervous to try this but I am so glad I did!  We made it for a school picnic and it was a big hit!  The only thing I left out was the paprika because I didn't have it, and the black pepper because I forgot LOL.  Oh, and I did substitute poultry seasoning for the seasoning salt based on other reviews, but seriously, it would be fabulous without making ANY changes!

Really, really good.  Delicious.  Omitted the bell pepper.  For the chicken, I carved the meat off a roasted Rotisserie chicken (from the grocery store) and shredded it with a fork  .  Served it on croissants.  My husband and I loved it.  He ate two sandwiches.  
This is something I will make again and again.

I omit the celery and green pepper because they aren't my favorites, and it still tastes wonderful! I also added just a dash of garlic powder.

Everyone LOVES this and says it's the best chicken salad they've ever had.  I've even made an extra batch for my best friend for her birthday.  I roast bone in, skin on chicken breasts and then shred the meat.  I also omit the paprika and use orange, red, and yellow bell pappers and toast the pecans.  I add about half the pecans to the salad and sprinkle the rest on top.  Always better the next day.  YUMMY!

New family "quick-to-make" faves.  If served on a high-quality multigrain bread or over a salad, it is fantastic.  I did add a little cilantro and some finely diced red onion and fresh basil...gave it a slight change-of-pace, but is excellent as-is.

I thought this recipe was so good. I needed to make a small amount so I eyeballed the amounts of everything and I didn't have the dried cranberries, so instead I used diced apple. and I also used orange bell pepper instead of green. It was as beautiful as it was tasty. I will surely make this again! And if your familiar with Penzey's spices, I used the Salad Elegant spice mix instead of just paprika.

This was fantastic.  I left out celery because I didn't have it.  The only thing I would do differently is make more (I halved it for a family dinner).  I will definitely make again.  I served it on croissants and it was delicious, but was almost better by itself.

I was actually flagged down at our PTO meeting by a group of women after making this for a teacher's appreciation luncheon.  It is definitely one of my favorite recipes but I add extra cranberries for a little sweeter flavor.  Excellent.

best chicken salad i have ever made! i made this for a baby shower and every single person went back for more. i tripled the recipe because i am always worried i wouldn't have enough food. i'm so glad i did because there was nothing left. by the way, when i tripled it. the only thing i didn't triple were the cranberries. i added about half a cup more to it and it was plenty. very yummy! thank you for sharing.

I made this for tailgating with my parents. My dad was shocked at how great it was.  He said it was the best chicken salad he had ever had!  I omitted the green belle pepper, added a green apple and I used Duke's mayo. I also seasoned my chicken before I baked it with garlic powder, black pepper and salt. It was great.

I made this recipe for my daughter's baby shower.  Doubling this recipe was enough to make about 100 party rolls.  This is the best chicken salad I have ever eaten.  One of my friends came across the room and practically begged me for the recipe.  You will love this!  Update: Made these for my daughters sorority sisters at college and they asked me to make them for 3 different occasions this year!

Absolutely delicious! Put in about 3/4 cup of sliced grapes, and 3/4 cup of cranberries. Simple, easy with a wonderful taste, perfect for lazy summer evenings. Will certainly make again, though may put a little less meat in - This recipe calls for a little too much chicken for my family's liking.

AMAZING!!!!!!!! Absolutely a more than 5 star recipe! I was asked to make chicken salad for a baby shower and chose this one. I am so glad that I did. Everyone was raving about it and I had many requests for the recipe. The recipe is GREAT as it is, however with these additions it was OVER-THE-TOP! I toasted the pecans using the recipe from this site. YUM! I used half the crasins that the recipe called for and substituted the other half with red grapes. I also omitted the peppers. This salad is definitely the BEST! Look not farther! Try it, you won't be sorry.

This recipe is good but I keep wanting it sweeter. To get my sweet fix I had 1/2 braeburn/jazz apple (minced) and some green grapes.  I keep the onions and green bell peppers in and it is a great combination of flavors and crunch.

This is an exceptional salad, and I agree with one of the other reviewers that it should not be classified as a "Holiday" salad.  I tested the recipe when looking for some hearty salads that would work well in the summer and required no indoor cooking.  This one hit the spot!  I followed the recipe exactly as it's written and couldn't think of anything I would have wanted to change.  Great salad!

A little bland as written, but an excellent basic chicken salad.  I subbed rough dice pineapple for the craisins, added about a cup of lightly toasted macadamia nuts and minced red onion instead of green onion and made chicken salad-stuffed papayas.  A nice warm-weather dinner.  Served up with Kings Hawaiian sweet bread.  Thanks for the recipe and the helpful reviews!

I've never written a review for a recipe, but i had to for this one.  I made it last night and it was AMAZING.  I made a few small adjustments -- i used rotisserie chicken so it was perfectly cooked and juicy.  I also used about 1/3 C of mayo, i'm not a big mayo fan and i thought a cup was WAY too much -- next time i'll use even less, i can still taste it.  I also omitted the bell pepper (yuk)and used about 1/4 less crasins then it calls for.  I also added 3 stips of extra crispy chopped up bacon to give it a little salt (i didn't have seasoning salt and trying not to use table salt for anything)and a bit of smokieness.  I like my food on the spicy side, so i added several squirts of sriracha hot sauce, I may add a bit more next time.  Came out SO good.  I had a gigantic sandwitch for dinner, and i'm already counting the minutes till lunch time.  Next time I'd like to try apples in it.  I LOVED the pecans in it!! I'm used to almonds, but the pecans gave it an amazing nutty crunch!  best chicken salad EVER!

I followed the recipe except made a half batch.  We loved the flavor and will make this again.  I could personally cut back on the cranberries a bit but that's just me.

Another 5 star review for this delishious chicken salad. I doubled the green onion, left out the bell pepper, added grapes, used 2/3 of the cranberries, used cashews instead. We made wraps with it..so very good and addictive!

Wonderful! There are a few things that are a MUST to make this turn out great...1)chill it overnight to give all the flavors time to combine. 2)don't overdo it on the mayo - the flavor comes from the seasonings and fruit etc. too much mayo drowns the true flavor of the salad. 3) not required, but a good tip is to buy a herb & garlic or lemon pepper rotisserie chicken instead of baking your own. The rotisserie chicken is so moist and bursting with flavor that it makes the salad that much more mouthwatering. I have also made this with diced apples, red grapes and cashews and still wonderful! Green onions are a nice addition and taste fabulous, too. It is truly a beautiful salad and works well for the holidays because of the gorgeous red and green colors. Thanks for the recipe!!

I made this for lunch today and it it very yummy! My only issue with this recipe is that it will not make it to the fridge to chill for 1 hour, so make a double batch!

This is good. I used left over chicken from the "Rotesserie Sticky Chicken"[from this site]I used Hazelnuts because thats what I had in my pantry. I've let the salad sit for about an hour or so. We're munching on it with crackers. Tommorrow 'lunch'.I could see using this on Endive leaves or Boston lettuce. Yum.

I had some leftover chicken that I didn't know what to do with.  I saw the picture of this recipe on the daily voting, and knew I had to make it.  I left out the green bell pepper, because I don't care for them.  I also added a dash of garlic powder, and it was first class! I will be making this one again.  Thanks.

Everyone in my family says "more!" It just disappeared!  A new favorite in my household, and I didn't think anything could top my usual chicken salad recipe.

I've been looking for a great chicken salad recipe and this is it. I added some orange zest for an extra citrus taste. I got rave reviews and can't wait to make this again.

Very good.  Served it at our Christmas party and they held up very nicely on the buffet (sandwich did not get soggy). I will mince green pepper next time which is just a personal preference I and will make it ALL YEAR ROUND.

Add me to the people who love this recipe.  Can't wait to try it tomorrow at lunch and see as others have said, better after the 1st day.  It is excellent already!  I followed pretty close to as written..used craisens but only had about 1/2 cup.  Used walnuts since that's all I had.  I think next time I will cut down on the seasoned salt since it tasted a little salty for my tastes.  Have to think up a good way  to serve to guests.

This is DELICIOUS! I needed to bring a chicken salad for teachers at school and wanted to make something new. I have been making the standard chicken salad from the Betty Crocker cookbook for years and decided to branch out. It was worth it. I did not change anything to this recipe. I am not a big fan of cranberries but they are perfect in this recipe. I highly recommend this recipe. Thank you!

EXCELLENT recipe!  I omitted the green onion and green pepper (my family doesn't like), and cut down a little on the mayo and cranberries.  Didn't have any seasoning salt (I was out of it) and just used plain salt and fresh cracked pepper.  I also used some dill as someone else suggested and it turned out FABULOUS!  This is the best chicken salad recipe I have ever made!

Thank you thank you for this recipe!

Used half mayo--half plain yogurt. Added pecans as well. Had no green bell peppers on hand(maybe next time). Very good salad.

This chicken salad is really delicious. I didn't have paprika, so i used a combo of cayenne and allspice, which worked. It's a great combination of salty, sweet, spicy, everything. I will definitely make this again. I agree with others who said that it shouldn't be limited to the holiday section.

The cranberries give this a great sweet flavor while the celery and nuts give it the crunch it needs. Better when it has a good amount of time to sit.

Fabulous!  I made this recipe for a baby shower and we served it in croissants.  What a hit.  I did leave out the green pepper because too many don't like green pepper.  I added four green onions and used turkey.  It was yummy and I could hear people all over the room commenting how good it was.  I had doubled the recipe and a little bit more.  Easy to make.

This was an amazing recipe! I was a bit skeptical about the cranberries, but after tasting it I realized the cranberries make the perfect complement to the slightly crunchy pecans. I also seasoned the chicken with some garlic powder and salt/pepper. I used an extra dash of peprika to give it a bit more oomph, and used 1/2 of seedless grapes and 1/2 cup of sliced apples. Simply amazing!

I made this recipe for a Christmas in July party.  To make it more festive, I made a crescent roll wreath (by placing the triangles in a circle with the wide ends touching and points facing out), filled it with the chicken salad, then folded the points over.  I brushed the top with egg white and baked it at 350 for ~25 minutes.  It was the hit of the party!

I was trying to replicate the Costco "Sonoma Chicken Salad" and this one is pretty close.  I added apples, grapes, and some pinneapple juice.  I also substitued 1/2 of the mayo for plain yogurt -- to make it a little healthier.   FABULOUS!!!!

Excellent! I didn't have everything and it still turned out. My hubby said it was excellent which made my day. He's very picky so I often get "it's okay" for reviews. I will make again and again. I used rotisserie chicken.

The only chicken salad I make.  I use walnuts because that's what I have and don't add peppers because I don't like them. Great with crackers for a party.

This was an easy recipe to prepare and got great reviews from my family and coworkers. I wish this salad was listed in another category besides "Holiday"  because it can be enjoyed year-round! I followed the recipe, but omitted the green onions. I baked 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts and diced them in 1" pieces, then chopped 3 stalks of celery, 1 small green pepper, and 1c pecans. The cranberries made it pretty and added a just the right amount of sweetness. I served it with whole wheat buns, but most people just ate it with a fork. I will definitely make this again (and again) without changing a thing.

Let me start by saying...I hate chicken salad. I made this for hubby because he loves it. It was alittle time consuming because of all the shpping but it was definatly worth it. I loved it more then hubby! I loved all the crunch. I added extra red peppers, walnuts and celery to make it extra crunchy. I may try apples next time. Thank You for this recipe!

I reviewed this recipe a while back and gave it three stars. This was because I reviewd the chicken salad before it had a chance to chill in the refrigerator. Chilling the salad is the key to this recipe - now I give it 5 stars!

This is one of my favorite quick and easy lunches or dinners.  I have made several modifications to it, and I like it better this way:  I skip the green onions, green peppers, and pecans and replace them with peeled apples, green grapes, and slivered almonds.  I also cut back on the mayonnaise.  Very good!

I made this for a shower for 40 people and it was a huge hit. I used white onion instead of green, grapes instead of green pepper and almonds instead of pecans. I have gotten so many requests for this recipe. I will be making this as much as possible.

I'm pregnant and have been craving a good chicken salad for the past few days. As soon as I saw this recipe I knew I had to make it. Luckily, it turned out delicious!!! I cubed 3 whole boneless skiless chicken breasts and cooked them in a little olive oil. I seasoned them in salt, pepper, and garlic powder. I did not add green peppers but did add grapes and an apple. I didn't really measure anything out except for the mayo (Miracle Whip in my case) and just added the ingrediants until it looked good. I also did not add anymore salt or pepper (since I had seasoned the chicken breasts with it) and only added a dash of paprika. I also omitted the seasoning salt as it didn't really sound appetizing. I let it sit for about an hour in the fridge and then ate it on a crossiant with some lettuce. This will now be the ONLY chicken salad I make...ever!!! It was to die for!!!

Very good recipe - and it's not just for the holidays, great in the summer!  We used it for sandwiches and over lettuce for a lighter meal.  Delicious.

I used Miracle Whip instead of mayo (but only 3/4 cup), as it is preferred in my family.  It did make it sweet, but that's how we like it.  I was able to cut back on the 'mayo' b/c my chicken was so moist.  I highly  recommend using a rotiserie chicken from your grocery store.  Just remove the skin and shred the meat.  If you don't use the rotiserie chicken - use a full cup of mayo or Miracle Whip.

I also added halved grapes - they really make chicken salad so much better!  The dried cranberries add a unique texture (I liked them, my boyfriend didn't).  We omitted the nuts b/c we didn't have any on hand.

Long story short - this is our official chicken salad recipe now!  Thanks for sharing.

Scrumptious!  I was looking for a chicken salad recipe with grapes in it, because I love to include them in my chicken salad, and came across this recipe.  I used 3/4 cups of craisins and 3/4 cups of sliced red grapes.  I also used red pepper instead of green because I prefer it.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and was completely impressed with the result.  I served it to the ladies in my sons playgroup and they couldn't get enough.  I swear some would have licked the bowl if it wouldn't have looked bad. I sent them all home with the recipe and it may become a weekly tradition for someone to make "THE chicken salad". Thanks!

This was good, but I was kind of disappointed after all the excellent reviews. It was kind of dry, so I'll add more mayo next time. I also omitted the green pepper and added sliced red grapes and a Fuji apple. Letting it set in the fridge is essential, to allow the flavors to properly mix and give it its tasty "magic." It was really good -- one of the best I've seen, but not totally great, as I expected.

The Best!!!!! I've tried other chicken salad recipes and I keep coming back to this.  I've been making this for a couple of years now and every time I serve it, I get raves and people asking for the recipe.

I always serve it as a sandwich filling - using croissants as the bread.

One of the best chicken salads I've ever had! I substituted the cranberries for craisins and pecans for toasted almonds. Added halved red grapes and it was good to go!! Making it again for a Superbowl party.

This is a great chicken salad. I made this for 140 people and they all loved it! The only think I did was omit the green bell pepper and I lightly toasted the pecans. Simply wonderful. The cranberries were a perfect addition for the holidays. I generally can't stand fruit in main dishes, but this was amazing. My husband and child even ate it!

I am not a chicken salad fan, but this recipe is the best chicken salad I have ever had. I have been making it for about a year. I followed the recipe and I have also halved the recipe and both have turned out perfect. It is more of a chunky style than creamy salad so it works well as a side dish also. I have tried it with craisins and with regular dried cranberries that are in the produce section. They both are good, but I like the craisins best. I have substituted precooked chicken strips, yellow onion, tri colored peppers, walnuts and Miracle Whip and Light Mayo. All of them turned out great. I don't think you could mess up this recipe. A favorite in my house.

Very tasty! I took others' advice and made a few changes: Miracle Whip instead of mayo; 1/2 cup dried cranberries, 1/2 cup halved green grapes, and 1/2 cup diced Granny Smith apple for the fruit; 1/2 cup red onion instead of green; no bell pepper; toasted pecans instead of raw; and 1/2 tsp of garlic salt. Next time I'll use 1/2 tsp paprika; I only used 3/4 tsp this time and it was hot hot hot! I served it with toast points and my husband ate it right up. Healthy & tasty too!

This is the best chicken salad I've ever tasted! I served this for lunch on croissants and everyone asked for the recipe. I didn't measure the ingredients, I kind of just eyeballed it, putting as much cranberries,nuts,onion and bell pepper as I wanted and it turned out great!

My husband didn't like this recipe, but I did.  I used exactly 4-(8 oz. ea.) chicken breasts, 2 Tbsp. of finely chopped onion, (instead of the
green onions) and roasted & salted pecans that I 
purchased from a Mills Fleet Farm Store.  I could
not taste the pecans in this recipe, so you probably could omit them in this recipe.  I sandwiched this between 16 mini cresent rolls.
Thank-you Elaine for a great tasting chicken salad
recipe.

This salad is perfect!  I love the addition of dried cranberries, and I've used the different flavors of those too.  I do omit the celery - that's not my thing - but there's plenty of crunch with the pecans.  
I served this on warm crossaints - perfect for a luncheon!

Tasty.  Next time I'll decrease the amount of cranberries though, possibly by half.  You could vary the nuts in the recipe too.  There's a broccoli slaw recipe on this site that calls for cranberries & pistachios so I think pistachios would be good in this recipe too.

This recipe is absolutely the best chicken salad recipe I've ever tried!  I used canned cooked chicken breast and it works perfectly.  It's great because it's so versatile.  If you don't have one of the ingredients on hand, you can usually substitute it with something else or leave it out without compromising the salad.  Thanks for a great recipe!  Everyone who's tried it has loved it.

I made this for a women's club meeting and was met at every elbow with "will you share that recipe?"  It's wonderful.  I cut back a little on the cranberries, lightly toasted the nuts and served on honey wheatberry bread.  Wonderful salad!

I was looking to try to duplicate a Sonoma Chicken Salad from Whole Foods deli.   The only reason I give this four is it didn't quite make me smile as much as theirs did.   I think the lack of GRAPES made a big difference that I thought MIGHT have been overcome by the cranberries.   But all-in-all a VERY good chicken salad.

i couldn't believe the rave reviews everyone gave until i made it for myself. ia have made it 3 times in the last month and everyone LOVES it!! i do agree, however, that the recipe could call for fewer cranberries.

Why save this for a *holiday*???  This is SO very good!  I didn't even have green onions or peppers..added some onion powder, and tasted just great.  That hour or so sitting time in the fridge is a must..don't try to skip it.  Very good made with Hellman's.

I used non-fat greek yogurt in place of the mayo & added 1/2 of a large honeycrisp Apple, finely chopped. Put it on a whole wheat tortilla with chopped cherry tomatoes, sliced avocado, and baby spinach leaves. Turned out absolutely amazing!

I am very happy with this recipe.  Chicken salad is not rocket science, but it can be very bland if you don't have a combination of mix-ins that works for you.  My favorite chicken salad is McAllister's, so I really like the combination of cranberries and nuts.  I did use the celery and green onion, but I don't like green peppers plus I don't think this recipe needs more "crunch".  I used leftover "bbq" chicken with the skin (and sauce) removed so I knew it has a little more flavor than your average plain chicken, so I skipped the paprika, seasoned salt, and pepper. I left it to sit overnight and it was really good in a whole wheat pita with crispy romaine.  I'll bookmark this for a reminder, but I don't really think a "recipe" will be necessary in the future.  Thanks for the recipe, I will use these add-ins for my chicken salad from now on.

Very nice!  Made a few changes based on what I had on hand. Left out the bell pepper and celery and substituted minced yellow onion for the green onion. Made a whole wheat wrap with it.  Delish! Tasted even better the next day.

I used Greek yogurt instead of mayo and didn't change anything else .. It came out really good other than next time I might try shredding the chicken or small cubes so you get all the flavors in every bite! I will definitely make this again!

The flavors just did not mesh well in my opinion. And it called for WAY too many cranberries and pecans.

Yum!  After seeing the recipe recommended many times on thebuzz, I'm glad I finally got around to trying it.  It is fantastic!  The girls at school wanted my lunch today!  The one sub I made was using 1/2 cup Greek yogurt and 1/2 cup mayonnaise, everything else stayed the same.  Love the sweetness of the cranberries and the crunch of the pecans.  I enjoyed this in a spinach wrap with lettuce and tomatoes added.

I've been making this recipe for years and I can officially say that as-is, this is 4 stars. But if you add some dill relish then it is definitely 5 stars! Love this recipe. It is my favorite chicken salad (with the dill relish of course). :)

I've also made this twice now, and it's only been a week since finding the recipe. So simple, yet so delicious. I added grapes, and used pistachios instead of walnuts. Huge hit... glad to have this in my recipe box.

Loved it! I used every ingredient, no additions or subtraction ,  let it go 24 hours in the fridge and it was absolutely fantastic! I made it for a party and all my guests could not get enough and were all asking for the recipe. This one is certainly going to be made again:)

Since first making this 6 years ago, I'm not allowed to make any other chicken salad. :) One thing I do differently is that I shred my chicken in a food processor instead of cubing it. We eat it on sandwiches, so it's just easier that way. I'm finally reviewing this because I just figured out why someone might think it's bland -- it depends on your seasoning salt. I've used Lawry's for years, but I recently bought McCormick's and it does NOT have the same flavor.

Seconds please! This is a fabulous festive dish but it's too good for just the holidays. It's perfect for a refreshing summer meal and since it comes together in no time it's great for busy weeknights. This deceptively simple recipe stands out because it's just a good balance of flavors. And did I mention how darn easy this was? I boiled thinly-sliced chicken breasts and by the time I cut the veggies and mixed the rest it was practically done. I don't think it needs to chill beforehand, but I'm not picky. To make it a little healthier I used low-sodium seasoning salt, light mayo and cut the mayo to half. It was on the dry side so if you aren't as concerned about calories I'd say add more, but it still was really delicious.

I really enjoy chicken salads with cranberries so i decided to try this one.  I made minor adjustments: added half the salt, grated carrots and chopped some cabbage and one lime.  It was awesome.  I like how the cabbage adds some texture and it doesn't get soggy like lettuce does.

My first ever Chicken Salad and it came out great. My wife loved it. Started with a store bought Roasted Chicken, tore it apart and cut it up. Like others, I added a little to it - 1/4 tsp Rotisserie Chicken flavoring, and 1/2 tsp Garlic Powder. I didn't have any pecans, but did have fresh Hazelnuts we got from the farmers market. I'm thinking we need to get some nice crackers to go with it, serve it as an Hors d'oeuvre.

Excellent chicken salad. After reading reviews, I made the salad with the following minor adjustments: used cherry flavored Craisins in place of regular dried cranberries and reduced amount to one cup (one bag). Soaked them in hot tap water for 15 mins as one reviewer suggested. Also candied the chopped pecans cooking them with a half cup of sugar stirring constantly until sugar melted and coated the pecans as suggested by another reviewer. Lastly added a dash of poultry seasoning and garlic powder to the mayo as a third reviewer suggested. Used all other ingredients as listed. Mayo used was Dukes as it contains no sugar and there was enough sweetness coming from the Craisins and candied pecans. Refrigerated for two and a half hours before serving. Great blend of favors and crunch. Love it!

This was good. I used a few sprinkles of regular salt and dried minced onion because I didn't have any green onions. Also, I used half mayo and half regular plain yogurt; I added a bit more because with all the crunchy items, I thought it tasted better creamier. I love chicken salad with cranberries in it.

This recipe is awesome. I've made it many times, twice following the recipe exactly. I find that it's much better to omit the celery and substitute with red bell pepper. I also don't use mayonnaise because I hate it and use greek yogurt instead. I also put about three green onions in it. Soo yummy :)

Very Good, I minced the celery and onion leaving the chunkier chicken. Not overly mayonnaisy.

Like some other reviewers, I added several dashes of poultry seasoning and garlic powder to the mayo mixture. Instead of 1 1/2 cups dried cranberries, I used 1 cup. I also omitted the bell pepper. I usually serve it with whole wheat Wheat Thins. EVERYONE asks me for this recipe!!!! Oh, and it's better the next day!

Absolutely LOVE this chicken salad! I've made it three times and each time is better. I didn't change a single thing. I've used rotisserie chicken from the grocery store just because I think it tastes the best. Its wonderful!

This worked really well. In the summer, I did grapes instead of cranberries. I also omitted the pecans.

Best chicken salad I've ever had.  Did as previous reviewers, added poultry seasoning and garlic powder to mayo; soaked dried cranberries in hot water.  In addition, I added some fake bacon bits and sunflower seeds instead of pecans, omitted the paprika and bell pepper, and used diced yellow onion in place of green onions (didn't have any).  The cranberries added that little something missing from my regular chicken salad- thanks for the great recipe!

This was wonderful!!!  Hubby loved it!!!!  It tasted super fresh!!!  I certainly will be making this again,  we made mini sandwiches and also topped ritz crackers with the chicken salad!!! 
I did not have any green onion (and forgot to pick some up while shopping)  but it was still really really good!!
I did submit a photo however I loved the color combination before the mayo was added, I was careful when adding it as I did not want to over do it, and I love using the Kraft mayo with olive oil!

Wow - BEST CHICKEN SALAD EVER!!  This tastes like it was made in a fancy restaurant!  I did add a little more mayo and purple grapes (cut in half).  And you are right; it is better the next day.  I served a scoop of it on a bed of spring mix lettuce surrounded by a circle of cucumbers with fresh spinach leaves in between the cucumbers.  I added a little Lite Rasberry Vinageriatte dressing to the greens.  5 STARS!!

This chicken salad is awesome. I did use a little bit less mayo than called for. I ate it before I put it in the fridge and it was great. It is even better cold! I think this is my new go to chicken salad!

I made this salad for 80 ladies at a church event.  I followed the recipe except that I left out the bell pepper and reduced the cranberries to one cup.  I used canned chicken breast with a little garlic powder mixed in.  It got rave reviews and many, many ladies asked me for my recipe.  This is the chicken salad recipe I have been looking for!

Followed some other reviewers suggestions and used apples (didnt have any cranberries)  This was passable, nothing to write home about. Perhaps the cranberries are what give the recipe some some flavor. Will not even try again.

4.5 stras.  I made this with leftover T-day turkey.  tastes awesome and really good for when you start becoming tired of turkey sandwiches.  I subbed almonds for pecans because the BF is allergic.  delicious!

Loved it!  The basics of this recipe was the perfect use for my chicken holiday left-overs.  I did substituted raisins for cranberries, because I did not have any.  I also left out the green onion, bell pepper, and celery.  The chicken, pecans, and raisin combination was a memorable combination which I will remember in the future.

I have made this recipe about 10 times, and I absolutely love it.  It is consistantly amazing.  Over the course of batches, I've altered it to my taste.  Instead of the walnuts, I use sunflower seeds.  I do not use green pepper at all.  I add apple and sliced grapes.  I put in about half of the amount of onion suggested in the recipe.  All in all, perfecto!

This recipe was had too much mayonnaise flavor for my family (which to be fair, none of us like mayonnaise much anyway). So I added about 8 oz of sour cream and doubled the paprika and added some extra pepper. Also added lots more veggies. It was even better the second day. YUM! Will definitely be making it again (with the sour cream). NOTE: we bought the Costco chicken salad the other day and I just got told that this recipe was better.

Loved this dish. I modified slightly due to ingredients on hand. I chopped up leftover rotisserie chicken (which had been seasoned with the rub from the Roast Sticky Chicken recipe on this site), used Tony Chachere's seasoning in place of seasoning salt, chopped walnuts instead of pecans, and omitted the green peppers. The only issue I had was keeping everyone out of it for an hour while it chilled!

Amazing recipe! I substituted the cranberries for raisins, because I didn't have any on hand. I served this on the actual first "hot" day of spring. My husband is a construction worker so this tasted very good to him after a very warm day at work. Next time I'll make more so I can send leftovers in his lunch! BTW I would need to triple this recipe to feed my 4 boys and husband! Spectacular!!

Delicious!  I made it the night before, used a grocery store rotisserie chicken & replaced the green pepper with green apples.  Many of my guests commented on it, a couple asked if I made it myself & several asked for the recipe.  Will definately make this again!

This is SOOO good. I made it for my boyfriend and I, and he ate it every day for lunch for a week, and then requested that I make it again. It is that good!  I made a few changes just to suit my liking: used a rotisserie style chicken from the grocery store, omitted the green pepper, added 1 cup grapes, and added 1/2 tsp. onion power, and 1/2 tsp. garlic powder to the mayonnaise.  I have been looking everywhere for a great chicken salad recipe, and this is the best!

This is great chicken salad.  I served it on croissants.  It is very colorful and looks nice on a platter.  I suggest that you make it a day ahead and allow the flavors to blend.  I used 1 cup of cranberries and 1/2 cup golden rasins.  I left out the onions because I forgot to buy them.  I seasoned the chicken with Cavender's Greek Seasoning and grilled it.

This is a very tasty recipe. I followed most of it. We changed the green pepper to green apples about 2 cups diced(4 small apples) skipped paprika & changed to 1 huge sweet onion microwaving it for 5 minutes after I cut it up. Cooking it makes it sweeter and takes the acidity out of it. Lastly we use garlic pepper in our house on everything, and we used this instead of salt & pepper. This recipe was easy and goes together in minutes. It is a great salad for entertaining indoors and even better poolside. Thank you  Jill

Ok, so I catered a wedding for 100 people last weekend and made this chicken salad to put between croissants...it was spectacular. i had many, mnay compliments and requests for the recipe. it was my first time making this so I was a little nervous, but it was absolutely great. I did buy 5 rotisserie chickens from sam's club and used that for extra flavor...I would highly recommend!

I agree that this is not just a holiday chicken salad. I am not a big fan of cranberries so I added a figi apple and some red grapes and almonds instead. It is amazing. I make it for my husbands lunches and he LOVES it!

This was a little dry the day after I made it for a party. I did add about a 1/4 cup more of mayo before spreading on croissants. Very tasty. Even better the next day.

This is just the BEST chicken salad I have ever made or tasted. I made wraps with the spinach wraps you get at the store, and it was AWESOME! I did it EXACT as is, and it was perfect. This is for sure one I am holding onto!

I left out the green onions and bell peppers since my kids don't like those much.  We liked it quite a bit.  One kid didn't like it as much as what I usually make.  One kid liked it better.  Can't win.

Made this for lunch.  I followed the recipe exactly.  This is SO awesome.  I'm still salivating over this chicken salad.  My daughter ended up picking the craisins out because she thought it was too sweet.  The rest of us thought it was delicious.  Wouldn't hesitate serving it to guests.

This recipe was SO GOOD!  I did not have a green bell pepper on hand, so I just left it out.  I followed the recipe otherwise.  I will be keeping this one.  It has become my new favorite chicken salad recipe!

This stuff is sooooooooo good.  And the best part is you can add or change for whatever you like.  I shred the chicken (using a rotisserie chicken most of the time because it's just easier.)  I add more dried cranberries and celery, and serve on croissants.  LOVE IT!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. We didn't have dried cranberries so we used raisins instead, and it was wonderful! My husband kept saying how great it was and SO much better than anything you can find in the store!

This is a great chicken salad. My husband loved it!  I used a prepared rotisserie chicken from the grocery store and just pulled the meat off the bones. This made it easy and quick to prepare. I used just a touch of the green onions because I knew we would eat it for several days and sometimes onions can make recipes too strong when you store them. I might leave the onions out altogether next time, but if it is going to be eaten all at once, it would be okay. It has nice colors for the holidays, but this would be great in the heat of the summer too!

Absolutely love this chicken salad! I have never personally made it, but a friend of mine makes it and I beg her for it. I could (and have) sit and eat a whole bowl of it...not even using it on a sandwich.

Wow! It's like thanksgiving in your mouth! I really enjoyed this and so did my kids. I completely forgot to put the nuts in but it turned out great anyway. I used some leftover chicken breasts and added a little garlic powder to the chicken. I didn't dice the chicken, instead I shredded it because it came off the bone easier that way. All and all this is an excellent recipe. I'll keep this on hand for lunches especially when the kids are on break.

I made a few alterations to work with what I had and loved the results! I used a small amount of regular onion instead of green onion, I didn't have green peppers or celery either so used olives and hot chilis.  Just a spoonful of the chilis though.  I used walnuts instead of pecans and used chili powder instead of paprika.  I will make this all year long.

I LOVE chicken salad, and this recipe is fantastic! Couldn't wait the one hour to chill, so I ate it immediately after I made it. Put it on sourdough bread. Sooo heavenly! I followed the recipe exactly. However, being the impatient (and 5 months pregnant) person that I am, I included one shortcut: I just added 3 bags of the Purdue (or Tyson) cooked chicken strips found in the meat section of the grocery store.  I cut the strips into cubes and threw them in. I'm sure the same could be done with a rotisserie chicken as well. That way, you save yourself the step of cooking the chicken. Can't wait to have it for lunch tomorrow!

It was good but needs more flavor.  It's an extra step but marinating the chicken in olive oil, orange juice, minced garlic, onions, salt, pepper gives the dish a little more of a substantial flavor.  Also saute the chicken in a pan with a little olive oil and butter.

I made this recipe with high hopes. I added apples and grapes just as suggested but honestly they were the only thing that I liked. LOL. There was just something about it that my family didn't care for. I guess I could see why some others might love it but it just wasn't our thing. Hence the 3 stars. Sorry.

I used green grapes instead of dried cranberries.  The different textures, crunchy pecans, crisp vegetables, savory chicken and sweet fruit makes this a great salad for a satisfying lunch or a light dinner.

My family members are such simpletons when it comes to food, so I couldn’t bring myself to put the cranberries in the salad. I did put some in my sandwich and I really liked it! I forgot to buy bell peppers at the store, so I put in ½ cup cucumber (seeded) and it tasted good. Next time I make this, I may even put in some chopped water chestnuts for added crunch!  I love having this in the fridge, so we can make a quick tasty sandwich on the go!!

What a delicious chicken salad! I will definitely be making this again. I halved the recipe, and used more mayo than what was called for. I also used canned chicken. The only difference I'll make next time when making this recipe will be to add more of cranberries, celery, and onion.

I kept thinking that this would probably not be as good as the ratings showed because it just seemed so simple.  However, it was wonderful.  I did add a couple of things, which I think made it great.  I add a chopped Granny Smith apple and probably a cup of halved grapes.  I also used Smart Balance Light Mayo to make it a bit healthier.  It was excellent.  I will definitely be making this again!

Awesome with a few minor changes.  Apples substituted for peppers and red grapes for the craisins. Used 8 green onions, just the white part. Used 1 chix boob and 1 large can of chix. So close to Arby's chix salad, my favorite, that I now will make this at home instead of going out.

Excellent recipe!  We served this at a baby shower on and it went over really well!  One-and-half-ing the recipe gave us enough for 48 baby croissant sandwiches.  We did make a few changes - omitted the bell pepper, added some sunflower seeds and less cranberries.  We also toasted the pecans first.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I used green grapes, and lucky for me I had crasins laying around. I also used a sharp white cheddar cheese. The combination tasted great with the whole wheat honey bread recipe I used from this site.

Took a quick taste before putting in the fridge and the flavors of this are fantastic! I added some dried tart cherries, as I did not have enough dried cranberries, and it still tasted great. Great mix of sweet and savory with fruit, nuts and veggies, and also had a nice crunch. Can't wait to try it with my homemade wheat bread!

This was excellent!! I didn't think I would like it because it includes items I don't normally put in my chicken salad. My cousin made it for our annual Valentine's Tea and I can't wait to make it to taste it again!!

Honestly, this is an amazing recipe. I used red bell pepper for more color and I used a rotisserie chicken from Costco. I served it on crossiants (my kids ate it by itself and then ate the crossiant separately).  My mother-in-law ate the leftovers for lunch with soda crackers. Certainly worth the time to make!

This recipe is delicious. To reduce some of the fat, I used half nonfat mayo and half light mayo. There are enough seasonings in this recipe that I didn't miss the full fat mayo. I also eliminated the walnuts, mostly because I don't like them. I will definitely use this recipe again!

Great chicken salad.  I made for a baby shower at church and have since been requested to make it two more times.  I added a chopped apple and left out the bell pepper.

I think this recipe is great. My kids didn't like it and my husband didn't care for the cranberries. Be sure you are using 4 cups of chicken. And I think I will use 1/2 cup less dried cranberries. I served on crossients. Perfect!

What a wondrous combination of ingredients.  This chicken salad shouts "Party!"  The only change I made was to use plain salt instead of seasoned salt (because I had no seasoned salt).  It's wonderful and so easy to make.  This recipe is sure to impress your family and friends!

I was hesitant to try this chicken salad because I'm not a big fan of cranberries. Oh my gosh! I took it to a community salad supper and was asked for the recipe by several. One of my friends has forwarded it to her boss in Texas. It's a great recipe!

Hands down, this is the best chicken salad I have ever had!  I only changed a couple of things.  I didn't have any green onions so I used half of a small white onion that I minced, and I didn't have any cranberries so I used just a little honey for sweetness and it turned out wonderful!  Will definitely be making this again, soon!

I left out the peppers and celery, and it was still good.  The only thing I will do different is half the amount of mayo.  Way too much for my taste.

This was wonderful, and so easy to make!  I used chopped up roasted almonds and cashews instead of the pecans (I didn't have any), and they worked out well, adding a nice texture and crunch.  I definitely know what I'm doing with my leftover Thanksgiving turkey this year!

I made this for my son's school's Staff Appreciation Luncheon. Every bit of it went, and there were plenty of other salads on the table to choose from. My only deviations from the recipe were to use orange-flavored cranberries from Trader Joe's, and to omit the green pepper, since green peppers are the work of Satan, I'm pretty sure.

Very good. I used toasted almonds instead of pecans and left out the celery. Extremely good. Some of the family had it on crusty rolls and others had it in a green salad. Either way it was great.

This salad is phenomenal - we served it w/ mini croissants for a brunch and it won everyone over!  Update 02/21/09 - STILL love this recipe but wanted to add the changes that I do. I boil my chicken, cool and shred it. In the mayo mix I add in a few dashes of poultry seasoning and garlic powder. Omit the nuts (allergies) and bell pepper and add in a cup of purple seedless grapes. Served again on croissants, but good on greens, crackers or other good roll. Sides today I did sweet potato fries, green salad and fresh pear pie that is also on this site that is to die for. Was a nice not too filling lunch.

I've made this countless times.  Each time I add or omit different things according to what I have.  Grapes are great in it as well.  I've used turkey instead of chicken, I add a touch of curry powder at times.  It tastes great every time!

This is NYC bistro quality!! I could make money on this stuff. I did make two changes, as suggested before. I did NOT use any paprika, the color doesn't look appetizing. I did NOT use the seasoning salt, but opted for a few shakes of Old Bay Seasoning. I used toasted pecans, which give it a nice snap! I didn't add the other fruits that people suggested, because a fruit salad was being served and didn't want to overdo the fruit. YOU WILL LOVE THIS RECIPE!!

Best chicken salad ever!  I am not a big fan of chicken salads but this one has the best combo of flavors.  I served it on croissants with some provolone cheese, my husband raved about how much he liked it I will definitely make this again.  Like others before I used craisins also.

I used this recipe for finger sandwiches for a baby shower.  I left out the green bell pepper and served it on wheat bread.  It was super delicious and got rave reviews from everybody that tried it.  I will definitely make this again!

This was wonderful! I made it for a garden party of 14 people, made enough for 24 and all was eaten! Everyone loved it. I had four people ask for the recipe. I took someone's tip and added sunflower seeds (about 1/2 cup), as well as about 1/2 cup cut seedless green grapes. I served it with salad leaves and whole-wheat pita pockets for guest to make sandwiches. Delicious! Thank you again!

I really liked this salad - I left out the nuts and used red instead of green peppers, as well as the easy and awesome "Moist Garlic Chicken" recipe from this site. The cranberries were a nice touch! Made a wonderful, light lunch with lettuce, tomatoes and sunflower seeds. Thanks for an easy and unusual recipe!

I used leftover Thanksgiving turkey breast for this.  It was good, and a nice change from traditional salad.  However, next time I would use less mayo and only a little paprika.  I thought it gave the dressing an odd taste, and the color diminished the pretty appearance the cranberries and green pepper would have had otherwise.

I enjoy this recipe very much.  I just made it with a kids' cooking class as part of our "chicken salad extravaganza" class and they liked it.  I prefer it without the paprika.

I made some alterations that I think more suited my taste for a sweeter salad.  First, I didn't use paprika or seasoning salt.  I just sprinkled a bit of regular salt in the finished product (I cooked the chicken with salt).  Second, I used only 1/2 cup of cranberries and 1/2 cup of nuts (actually, I used almonds instead of pecans).  Third, I omitted the green onion and bell pepper.  Finally, I stirred in 1/3 cup of honey to the mayonnaise before adding the rest of the ingredients.  Served in pitas, croissants, or on a bed of lettuce.  Very pretty, and a sweet salad that's not too sweet!

OK.  Not what I was expecting after reading all the posts.  It was pretty good but nothing special.  I'm not a chicken salad lover but had some cooked chicken to use up, so I thought I'd try something instead of my normal chicken casserole.  This salad was bland.  I used toasted slivered almonds instead of the pecans because we don't like pecans, but I can't think that changed the taste that much.  It was pretty to look at!  I shared some with the folks I eat lunch with and they thought it was great, so maybe it's just me!

DEEEEELICIOUS!!!  It's my first attempt (don't know why) at chicken salad and it was a big, big hit!  I had to control myself not to eat it before it was time to serve!  I left out the nuts only because I'm not crazy about nuts in food.  I think I might give Beckys Chicken Salad a try (on this site) but we really love the cranberries in this one! And we did like the taste of the green peppers. Thanks submitter! UPDATE:  I reviewed this 8 years ago and just want to share that since that time I have tried many chicken salads from this site and loved them all but this one is the most requested and loved....and....I now love this with the nuts.  Becky's Chicken salad and Fruited Curry Chicken salad are also favorites.  From a beginner who never made chicken salad I now love to make it all year long - not just for 
the summer.

WOW! This has been the best recipe I've tried on here. I loved it so much that I told my mom about it. She insisted I make it for them -I did, and they loved it too! A huge hit. A+! Wonderful! This in between some crisp romaine is out of this world. I'm going to try a bit of stuffing in the sandwich with this next time.

Great recipe for chicken salad! I served it on whole wheat bread which seemed to take away from the salad itself.  Next time I'll serve it on croissants or just on a bed of lettuce.  Thanks Elaine!

Wow! What a surprisingly rich, well rounded flavor!  While preparing it, I was pretty skeptical, but once it sat in the fridge for a while it was great.  And yes, even hubbies like it.  A great way to use some of those leftover holiday ingredients in the house.

Incredibly tasty. I was quite worried about how all of the ingredients would blend and almost left some out. So glad I didn’t. This recipe makes for one of the best chicken salads I’ve ever tasted!!! I changed absolutely nothing. I enjoy absolutely everything about it. Well done!

I took this to a "girls luncheon" and it was a major hit! The hostess was recovering from a foot injury so I offered her to keep some leftovers for dinner and she took all the rest! I made it the day before so the flavors would blend and it did taste even better than the day I made it. I used scallions instead of onion and added halved red seedless grapes as well. I used slivered almonds instead of pecans because it is what I had. I know this recipe would be delicious as stated, but I do think the grapes added something extra special.  Because I was adding them I did increase the dressing recipe by 1/4 more. I have tried 2 other chicken salad recipes that wasn't what I was looking for but this one is a top notch recipe.

Love this recipe!  Made a few alterations: substitute 1 1/4 cups of greek yogurt vs. mayo, substitute chopped green grapes vs. the celery (personal preference), added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder too.  Its amazing, and with the yogurt on the healthier side.  I did a taste test too - on batch with yogurt and the other with mayo - literally no difference!  Its an awesome recipe - thanks for posting!

Great basic recipe for a chicken salad that you can build on with different types of ingredients.  Did not have green onions, green pepper, and nuts on hand....but it was still good.  Used left over chicken rotisserie from recipe also in this site (Roast Sticky Rotisserie Style)...which definitely added more yumminess!!

Very easy to make. We boil and shred the chicken to make the ingredients blend together. Excellent recipe.

I made this and ate it every day for a week for lunch! It was absolutely delicious.  I did make a few changes as some of the other reviewers mentioned - I added about 1 tsp of poultry seasoning and omitted the green pepper and onion.  I also added one diced apple and substituted almonds for pecans as I have an allergy.  This was so much easier using the dried cranberries than having to cut up grapes.  Will definitely make again and would be great for a holiday party!

Awesome chicken salad! I followed the recipe as written and got so many compliments! Served it on croissants at a gathering and it was gone in no time! Many people said it was the best chicken salad they have ever had. Thank you for this one!

I left out the cranberries and bell pepper, I thought the celery would add enough crunch. I almost didn't add the second 1/2 cup of pecans, 1 cup was a lot. I might do 3/4 c next time. I also added 2 chopped hard boiled eggs. I'm not a fan of chicken salad, but my hubby requested some and I will say this recipe is pretty good.

Yummy! I used 1/2 original and 1/2 cherry craisins, b/c that is what I had in the pantry; also used walnuts instead of pecans. Stuffed it in a fresh garden tomato! Two thumbs up!!

Made this several times now. It's great to use up leftover rotisserie chicken or leftover turkey. I lighten it up a little by using light mayo and replacing 2/3 of the Mayo with plain nonfat greek yogurt. I follow the remainder of the recipe. First time I took others advise and added Chinese 5 spice...don't do it. I almost didn't ever make it again. Great to use in a tortilla wrap with spinach!

Thank you for the great recipe! Made this several times as is and the chicken salad is awesome! My husband can't get enough of it. This most recent time making I wanted to make this healthier, so substituted 1/2 the mayo for plain greek yogurt and results were great. Next time I might try all plain greek yogurt and a tablespoon of mayo. I like to add grapes (halved).

This is the best chicken salad!  My sister sent me the recipe years ago and I neglected to try it until now.  It's very flavorful and I don't see how some people said this was bland.  I added all the ingredients and the mixture of crunchy, sweet, tart and salty ingredients is wonderful.  Definitely the best chicken salad I've ever had.

Excellent, with revisions. Made as directed, I agree that there is way too much "crunch" and not enough dressing. The "crunches" all need to be reduced by 1/2. Also, the dressing was a little bland. As a base, this is a solid recipe, but it's made great by adding in more spices (e.g., mustard, curry powder).

This recipe is super simple and tasty. The paprika makes this chicken salad so flavorful! I like a little more flavor, so I added a dash of onion and garlic powder. I didn't have dried cranberries so I substituted red grapes, quartered. Toasting the pecans in a pan for a couple minutes make the nuts more flavorful. Also, I had frozen chicken breast that i cooked in crock-pot seasoned with salt and pepper. It was surprisingly moist. I will make this again and next time with dried cranberries.

FINALLY a good chicken salad!  Didn't use green peppers or pecans.  Be careful of salt, as the mayo is salty.  Poached chicken breasts with lots of celery, carrots and onions...gave chicken a really good flavor and the broth was delicious.  Made 5 breasts and put one back in the broth!

I made this chicken salad for a baby shower, exactly according to the recipe. It was a big hit. I used rotisserie chicken breast meat, which made it easy. And I was so glad I took home the leftovers. It was even better the next couple days when the flavors could really blend. Making it for Mother's Day lunch this weekend. It's a keeper!

I followed this recipe exactly, but my husband and I both found it to be overwhelmingly salty.  I suppose we both prefer a sweeter chicken salad.

I substituted one cup of plain yogurt for the mayo and since bell peppers repeat on me I substituted diced celery. Delicious!

Yum yum yum! I made this with red instead of green bell peppers and toasted the nuts first, but otherwise this recipe is perfect as is. I made homemade croissants to go with it and had it for lunch, I was in heaven! I definitely reccomend letting the mixture sit in the fridge for a few hours to blend, especially if you cooked the chicken fresh like I did - it needs time to cool.

I made this for a Baby shower and everyone raved - I brought home leftovers - my husband and son were very disappointed when it was gone.  They both agree it is the best chicken salad ever.

This recipe was absolutely delicious--the best chicken salad I have ever made! I did alter the recipe a little. In place of the seasoning salt (which I didn't have on hand), I used regular table salt. I also didn't mince the green bell pepper, but chopped it into fine chunks. This recipe turned out great!!!

Yumm-o! Do as the others suggest and add the garlic powder, apple, red onion & grapes. Didn't need the poultry seasoning as one suggested because the seasoned salt is enough. My family thinks it's good enough to be from a restaurant.

Awesome flavor. I used a sweet onion, a red bell pepper and Hellmann's on half the recipe and Miracle whip on the other.  They both taste awesome.  Miracle whip is a little sweeter. Keeper recipe!

YUM!  I call this Confetti Chicken Salad.  I dice an orange bell pepper up and make sure everything else is cut really small.  I had no green onions and halfed the craisins.  I also added apples.  3 days later I'm eating it in a whole wheat tortilla and it's great.  So light compared to those gloppy heavy chix salads!

Easy to make with leftover curried honey mustard chicken, which I'm sure changed the taste. My daughters boh liked it, but one thought she would like it better with fewer cranberries. Thanks!

Great recipe!  Didn't have any green onions or bell pepper but it came out delicious anyways.   For a lower fat/calorie version, use fat-free mayo, cut pecans (you can use walnuts too) by half, and reduce cranberries to 1 cup.  Still delicious.   Would also recommend mincing the cooked chicken meat and adding a little more mayonnaise - makes for a more blended salad.

FRICKIN amazing!  I made this once two weeks ago, and gave tastes of it to three relatives.  30 mins later, the ENTIRE container was empty!!  For me, the only headache is chopping up everything, but now I make enough for 3 bowlsful, and then separate into baggies and freeze. When ready to use leave it sit until the items are softer, then add your mayo/lemon/miracle whip combo to taste. I serve on cucumber and tomato/lettuce wraps.  DELICIOUS!!

This is a great recipe.  I took others advice and used half of the amount of cranberries that it called for and it was still a bit too sweet.  I will use a fourth of what it calls for next time.

I made this recipe for my Bunco group and wrapped it in lettuce.  What a hit for those on diets.  I used low fat mayo and cut down on the craisins.  Have made this again and just received a request for the recipe!

Yum! I followed the recipe aside from substituting cashews for the nuts and using low fat mayo.  I cut the recipe down to 4 servings and used one large chicken breast, boiled in a mixture of water, a chicken bullion cube, and a few shakes of garlic powder and montreal chicken seasoning, then cooled and chopped. I agree with the other person who said that the word "Holiday" should be removed from the name- this is great for any time of the year!

So delicious and refined-tasting! As so many others recommended, I omitted the green pepper and added grapes and green apples. I let it chill overnight before serving it on sweet onion rolls. Definitely a keeper!

I make this all the time and ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS get rave reviews from everyone!! I use less cranberries than called for, omit the green peppers and toast my pecans.That being said, holy moly this is the most fabulous chicken salad recipe EVER!!!!!!!!! I usually let it meld overnight. It really doesn't get any better than this.

I've made this a couple times now, and it can be really good, but only with a few adjustments. Seasoned chicken is definitely necessary, or it will taste very bland. You should also add some spices or herbs according to your taste to give it some more flavor. Once you do this, it's a great salad, but as is, the recipe is not very tasty.

I was initially skeptical about this whole combination, albeit finished reading others’ positive reviews!However, I proceeded with it and customized the recipe a bit per others advice.   I cut 2 good-sized chicken breasts into cubes and seasoned with a pinch of sea salt, cracked pepper as well as Dijon Mustard and steamed them until cooked to retain tenderness. Per others’ comments; this salad tends to be dryer than expected, so I kept the steamed chicken juice and added 3 tbsp along with other dressing ingredients which were called for, except reduce Paprika to just a dash. I also reduced dried cranberries to ½ cup and another ½ cup of raisins instead coz doesn’t want the salad to taste too sweet in the end. Also cooked up a cup of Farfalle (bow tie) pasta as well as added some grated cheese along and tossed with all other ingredients to make this salad a really nutri-packed salad.   The initial taste was rather bland upon tossing but the eventual flavour (after 4 hours) really has the WOW factor, especially after marrying all flavours overnight in the fridge!!  UPDATES: Hubby finished off the last batch of salad on the 2nd day and said it even tasted better on the 2nd day, so a 5-star for this fabulous recipe!!!

This recipe rocks! I love chicken salad, but this is really the best I've had. It even was great with a few healthful changes. This salad really incorporates a lot of flavorful ingredients. I used breast tenderloin and baked for 15 minutes at 375 with a little salt, pepper, and olive oil cooking spray only. Then I shredded the chicken and used reduced-fat olive oil mayo. I didn't have seasoning salt, so I just used a little poultry seasoning. I did not use green pepper because I don't like the flavor, and I think this is perfect without it. I added salt and pepper to taste and served it on whole grain sandwich buns that I lightly spread with a little mayo and mustard. With a crisp piece of green leaf lettuce, this is absolutely a great summertime meal.

Someone brought this to a party yesterday and it was fabulous! Each of the flavors are subtle in their own way but combine to make for an amazingly delicious chicken salad! I was completely blown away by how good this was since I normally am not one for fruit of any sort in my chicken salad. The woman who made it strongly recommended letting the salad sit for 1-2 days after you make it for the flavors to mix. She served it on crackers as an appetizer, but it'd be great on sandwiches too, or in any use.

I absolutely love this recipe. I use the leftover chicken from when I make "Baked Slow Cooker Chicken" from this site and everybody loves it.  If you even like chicken salad just a little bit, this recipe will make you love it.

I really loved this recipe but I did change it a bit. I used 1/2cup mayo, 1/2cup miracle whip, 1/2tsp paprika, 1/2tsp season salt, I left out the onion & bell peppers because my kids don't care for them. Instead of dried cranberries I used dried cherries. Also I used cashews instead of pecans, only because I love cashews. I also added macaroni noodles to make it more of a pasta salad. I put it in the frig over night to let it all marinate together & it turned out great. My friends & family loved it. I will definitely make this again & again.

This is a great different chicken salad.  I made a few changes just because of what I had on hand.  I used toasted almond slivers and used 1/2 mayo, 1/2 Miracle Whip and I omited the green pepper because I don't like peppers.  I'm eating my sandwich as I type this and it's delicious!

I had some leftover grilled chicken and I was looking forward to trying this recipe with it. With all the great reviews I thought this would be wonderful but I was just not thrilled with it. I made the recipe as written minus the green peppers because I didn't have any. I tried it right after making and it was very bland to me. The next day the flavors did blend a bit better but to my tastes it was a little too sweet with the crasins and the chicken flavor was lost. I ended up putting some blackened seasoning on it just to be able to eat it. Sorry. I hate giving bad reviews but this just didn't float my boat.

If I eat more than a bite of chicken salad, I usually feel sick, but this one isn't too creamy or as heavy-feeling. It has such interesting flavors with the nuts and cranberries. If you're going to make chicken salad, this is the recipe to use.

Yum Yum!   I'm a busy teacher/mom, so I used a rotisserie chicken from my grocery store, substituted halved, seedless red grapes for the cranberries (thinking my 2 yr. old would find the craisins more difficult to swallow), and omitted the onion.  I had more than the 4 cups of chicken, so i eye-balled other ingredients and did add garlic powder to the mayo.  Both of my boys (6 and 2) loved this with Ritz crackers and asked for seconds.  My six year old even asked that I pack it for his school lunch.  I loved it on toasted ciabatta bread with lettuce.  This is such a keeper.

I would go with some other reviews and pre-season the chicken to add a little flavor.  I used grapes instead of cranberries.  Poultry seasoning and little less seasoning salt then what calls for.  Tastes better after sitting awhile and soaking in flavor!   Pretty tasty chicken salad recipe, Thanks!!

I served this at an Arbonne party rolled up in tortillas and cut into bite size pieces and everyone enjoyed it and wanted the recipe.  I substituted pecans for cashews only because that's what I had at home.  This has a nice flavor and shouldn't be made only during the holidays for sure!

If I could give this recipe six stars, I would. This is the best chicken salad I have ever had! I had about a cup of chicken left from my "Roast Sticky Chicken" from this site. I quartered the recipe and followed it to a "T", except for the peppers (I was out). I served it on a bed of baby salad greens. I can easily see myself serving this to company.

I followed the advice of one of the reviews and used poultry seasoning in the chicken salad and felt it was too strong of a taste for the salad. I made it with red grapes and sliced almonds, it was good. The next time I will follow the original recipe and omit the poultry seasoning. It will be much better. Great color presentation.

The only thing I change was the amount of cranberries.  I only used 1/2 cup.  I should have used 3/4 a cup.  I like cranberries and I didn't think 1/2 cup was enough!  Absolutely wonderful cold and warm (as a panini sandwich)!

This is one of the best chicken salads I've ever had! The mayo is not overpowering and the combination of spices is just right. I cut the recipe in half and substituted walnuts for the pecans. Definitely a keeper!

I have made this several times. I brought this chicken salad to a ladies luncheon and was deluged with recipe requests. You could substitute chopped walnuts for the pecans.  You can't go wrong with this recipe.

I made this for Christmas, and received nothing but rave reviews! It was delicious! Next time I make it, I might only add half the cranberries, or might skip them altogether. The group that I served it to enjoyed in immensly!

Like some other reviewers, I added about a cup of halved, seedless green grapes.  The only other variance from the recipe was using only about 1/2 tsp seasoned salt; I was afraid to use more, and am glad I didn't!  Delicious!

This was a great recipe in my opinion, though hubby didn't care for it (not a fan of chicken salad). I made this with some chunks of leftover rotisserie chicken and spread it on some hawaiian rolls. Very good! Thanks for a great recipe.

My favorite "special" sandwich.  Tasty and flavorful. I use leftover grilled chicken breasts and the marinade that I used adds some kick!

Phenomenal!  I love chicken salad and this recipe looked too good to pass up.  I did not change a thing, but I did make it a day ahead so the flavors could meld.  I will be using this all year long - not just during the holidays.

Better than I was expecting!!!  This is the ONLY recipe I'll use from now on.  As per another reviewer, I seasoned chicken breasts with salt, pepper, and garlic powder and then grilled on my George Foreman.  I used a seasoned salt recipe from this website and substituted dried tart cherries.  I served it with baguette slices at a party and EVERYONE asked for the recipe.

Delicious! Hubby even ate it, and he does not like Chicken Salad! Opted out of the celery, added more bell pepper, and left some chunks to make it crunchier!

Really tasty! I used leftover turkey from Thanksgiving and omitted the green pepper. It was a bit salty for me, so next time I will cut back on the seasoning salt. Otherwise it was really good. I will try it with chicken next. Served it over lettuce.

This was my first time making chicken salad, and it turned out very well.  I did not add green pepper or green onion, but I added green apples and red seedless grapes.  My husband and I both agreed that it was great.  I'll definitely make this again.

I made this last night for lunch today - I can't wait!  Used two chicken breasts with red onion instead of green.  Also followed other reviewer's instructions and added half plain yogurt and half light mayo to ease the guilt a little.  Very pleased with the result.  Will keep this in my file of favorite recipes :)

served this at garden club and had to print off the recipe for several members.  a great way to show off this page and how to change the number of servings.  Bue one thing to watchout for is that as you make this the  disy explodes, a little chicken goes a long way with all the extras, but then so does the flavor explode.  Great dish, I see where you get the holiday title, but with crasians being so popular, this is an all year dish.  I served it on my homemade rolls, which is my mother's recipe and maybe some day I will share.  I'm the only one who stillmakes it and if I don't see is, I may just have to share it to keep it going.

Awesome!
I added paprika and garlic powder to the chicken as I was cooking it.
I also added a dash of ginger to the spice mix.

Awesome recipe.  I doubled it and gave half to a friend who just had a baby.  I followed the recipe to a tee and it was really tasty.  Unfortunately, my pecans were chopped a little too finely so their flavor wasn't pronounced enough.  But it was still delicious and my husband is already asking that I make it again.

Wow!  This was so good!  I used orange bell pepper just because I like them better and I used the cooked chicken from Costco-delicious!  I think this will come in handy after Thanksgiving-use the lef-over bird instead of chicken? Thanks for the recipe!!

Wow!  This is a terrific recipe. I served this for lunch with a friend and she couldn't stop raving about it!  I made it without the green onions and celery, and it was still delicious.  Next time I am going to try adding green grapes and chopped apples like another reviewer suggested.

wow. this recipe is so easy, but yet so delish. I was kind of concerned while i was making it (about how it would turn out) because the ingredients didn't sound too appealing together, because there are so many different flavors, but I am so glad i tried it! It's great cause anyone can tweak it to their liking. I only make 3 servings at a time because I only cook for myself and my boyfriend. I use canned chicken, took out the bell pepper (cause i always forget to get it, and it tastes great w/o it), used candied walnuts instead of pecans, added some dry mustard, about 1 tsp brown sugar and about 1 tbs of minced onion. put it in the fridge and let the flavors marry.  Other than my little additions follow the recipe and its amazing! oh, putting it in the fridge for atleast an hour makes SUCH a difference in the flavor ^_^

Great chicken salad! I substituted regular salt for the seasoning salt, and red pepper for green pepper. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. Delicious! Will definitely make this again.

I left out the bell peppers (I didn't have any on hand) and I toasted the pecans. This was so delicious. I roasted a chicken the other day just so I could make this.

This is a great chicken salad recipe.  I did make a couple of changes though.  I used red onion instead of green, red bell pepper instead of green and used toasted slivered almonds instead of the pecans.  You can also substitute 2 (12.5 oz.) cans of chicken for the 4 cups of cubed.

Very tasty. I used sliced almonds because that is what I had. No peppers because I didn't have any but will use them the next time. I used a can of cooked chicken. Will be making this again.

This was awesome, a great way to use up leftover chicken. I lowered the mayo and used a couple tablespoons of Dijon mustard to give it a little extra kick. Don't skimp on cranberries, they're the best part!

I'm not a big fan of chicken salad, but this was a really good base recipe. For personal preference, I used half as much paprika, added some garlic powder, used green grapes instead of green pepper, and used a little less cranberries. I also used canned pecans that had been salted and toasted already.

Great recipe. Didn't add the pecans (although I know they would be tasty) or bell pepper and soaked the dried cranberries before adding them. Used a little less mayo. Outstanding flavor. Definately a keeper.

My daddy went to Sam's yesterday and came home with a ton of canned chicken. He's the only one who will eat it in the family, so I decided to make chicken salad with it. This is a great recipe, but I made some changes due to what I had. Used the canned chicken (2 13 oz. cans was perfect), and I rinsed the chicken well to get rid of as much salt as possible. I omitted the seasoned salt because of the canned chicken, and omitted the paprika (was out) - but added in some basil. Omitted the celery (out of that too). I don't care for chicken salad, but he loved this! Oh, used walnuts in place of pecans. P.S. The longer it chills in the fridge, the better. I chilled it overnight, and he said it's even better.

This chicken salad is awesome!  I also used toasted pecans, craisins and less paprika.   I served it with warm flour tortilla and romaine lettuce, so each can wrap their own.  I also added some mustard inside my sandwich and it was delicious!

My favorite chicken salad. Every time I bring it to parties, I get asked for the recipe. Love cranberries and pecans. Even though it is higher in cals/fats than other chicken salads, it is worth it (and the "healthy" fat.) No changes needed.

I used to buy premade chicken salad from Paradise Bakery for baby/bridal showers, but now I just make this. So good! I have made it with both the regular recipe and without nuts and grn pepper(cause I'm picky). Both are great. Definitely use a rotisserie chicken like from Sams or Costco. Yum!

I don't like to rate recipes that I've changed but here goes.  I was craving chicken salad and since everyone was raving about this one, I thought I'd try it.  I kind of combined this with a couple of other chicken salad recipes on this site.  As far as the things I changed:  I hate cranberries, so substituted green grapes.  Since they weren't very sweet, I think next time I would use red.  I really didn't measure anything except the dressing.  I added more green onions and omitted the green pepper.  I didn't have any pecans so substituted some fried crumbled bacon and cooked the chicken breasts in the bacon grease (yum).  I added garlic powder and poultry seasoning to the dressing.  I ended up adding more mayo, 1 Tbsp. lemon juice and a dash of Worcestershire as it was way too salty for me (and this was before the bacon was added).  One tsp. seasoning salt was just a bit much - maybe cut it down to 3/4 tsp. next time.  Overall a good base recipe but as I said, too salty for me.

Well, I didn't follow it as directed, but it gave me such a fresh take on the chicken salad,  I have to give it five stars!  I substituted the mayonnaise for a little less than 1 cup of nonfat plain yogurt.  Used orange flavored Craisins instead of regular dried cranberries, omitted paprika, onions, bell pepper and pecans, and added 1 cup chopped granny smith apples and 2/3 cup chopped walnuts.  Next time I'll probably add even more apples, since they really add a wonderful zingy crunch.  Loved the fruity chicken salad idea, and love this recipe!

Very, very good!  I pretty much stuck to the recipe but probably had closer to 5 cups of chicken so had to use more mayo.  I made sandwiches with mini-kaiser rolls from the bakery section.  1/3 cup was the perfect amount and it made 14 sandwiches.  I served them at a ladies' board meeting.  It was a hit.  This will be my standard from now on.  Thanks for the recipe.

Loved this! I used grapes and apples instead of cranberries, and no paprika. I didn't measure anything, but to make it last longer, and be even healthier, I added lots of the fruits and veggies.

Hubby loved this. I made it for him, as I am not that big on chicken salad. I cut back to 1 c. cranberries, 1/2 the called for paprika, no green peppers- subbed in 1/2 c. grapes, and added 1/4-1/2 c. more mayo- he likes it creamy. I let it sit overnight and it was a hit!

I have been using this recipe for awhile now and love it! I buy the precooked chicken in a bag to make it easier and just dice it.  I also add extra cranberries and have tried the cherry flavored cranberries as well.  They were both excellent. Nothing else comes close to this recipe.  I make it for my work parties and it gets rave reviews everytime.  I serve with everything bagels and french rolls.

This is a really great recipe! I did tweak it, as does everyone to their tastes and halved it besides. I omitted the paprika, used more green onion because I love the flavor it them!  also did as others said and substituted green apple for the green pepper. Also after chopping the apple drizzled a teaspoon or so of lemon juice to keep it from browning.  I am planning on serving it tomorrow for a luncheon, but of course, I taste test everything as I cook and it is really delicious!  I might add a few blue cheese crumbles on top and serve with cresent rolls along with a spinach salad. Sound yummy, huh?! Anyway, the salad itself is really tasty. I LOVE cranberries/pecans and chicken.....

The 1 teaspoon of paprika turns this dish a very unappealing orange when mixed with the mayo.  Flavor really isn't that great because it's mostly salt.

Delicious.  there is a little wiggle room here, also.  My DB just loves it, and thought he wouldn't.  He doesn't really like recipes with a lot of ingredients usually.  It's great.

YUM.  used only 1/2 C berries (used mixed), left out bell pepper, added grapes and apples.   used low fat mayo.  Everyone raved.  It would be great served in a half of a cantelope for a luncheon w/ nice bread or croissant on the side.  thanks so much. I bet a tsp. of curry would be good too.  Next time I will use regular salt instead of seasoning salt.

One of my all time faves to make.  This is the prefect chicken salad in summer or winter. I serve mine on a croissant or 9 grain bread......

This chicken salad recipe has become a family favorite! You can dress this up on croissants or put it on plain ol' bread. Either way, it's the best chicken salad recipe I've ever tried.

I'm so disappointed and maybe I did something wrong, but this did not turn out good for me at all.  

Too much paprika made it really orange looking and the flavors did not seem to come together.  I would not suggest this, but others seem to have enjoyed it.

Every time I make this I get rave reviews!  Everyone wants the recipe.  The only change I make is that I use red, instead of green, peppers, which adds an additional touch of sweetness.

THIS WAS INCREDIBLE!!! I made this for lunch on Friday thinking we would have some leftover for the weekend. Not a bite was left by Friday evening. I did cut back a little on the cranberries so that I could add a few grapes and a diced apple. This was perfect!

OH MY GOD! This is truly unbelievable!!! I'm not a huge chicken fan, but I can eat the whole bowl of this. I add more mayonaise than the recipe call for. I also add green apples and green grapes and red bell pepper (for color). I serve it on crossiants and oh is it good!

Great recipe!  I modified it a bit.  The chicken I used was the "Moist Garlic Chicken" from this site.  I omitted the green pepper and pecans and added halved grapes and diced apples.  I've made this a few times with Craisins and once with dried cherries and both taste delicious.  I usually serve this with Hawaiian bread rolls,  wheat pitas and some whole grain crackers and just let my guests put the salad on whatever they want.  My favorite is the Hawaiian bread.  The sweetness of the bread really makes the chicken salad stand out.

This was awesome - great summer-time meal!  I used a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken from the grocery store and I couldn't find cranberries so I used dried cherries instead.  Turned out great!

Hey, y'all!  Loved this chicken salad!  I made it for a luncheon and got rave reviews!!  I added a bit more onion simply because I love it! I also used a roast chicken and saved on time. Other than those simple tweaks I left it as is and it was great!

Loved this salad, and its great as a sandwich filling. I made it exactly as written, except I didn't have the seasoning salt, just used regular salt. I will be making this again, Thanks Elaine.

I made this for a baby shower and it turned out wonderful.  I left out the celery and green pepper (just seemed too weird to me) and used fat free mayo.  I also baked the chicken breasts with some mesquite seasoning but I don't know if that made a difference or not.

This chicken salad was AMAZING! The only things I changed were that I used red bell pepper in place of the green, used a little less cranberry than was called for, and I toasted the pecans in just a little bit of butter and sprinkled them with cinnamon.  I ate it on a honey wheat wrap for lunch.  It was DELISH!  I am going to use this recipe all the time, thank you!!

This is such a simple and wonderful recipe! I have used baked chicken in it and when in a pinch I have even used packaged chicken chunks. I use craisins most of the time, but have also used grapes or raisins instead for a slightly different taste. I have also used red peppers for a little more color and a splash of lemon juice. Great and super easy recipe! Sure to be a family favorite! Thanks!

This chicken salad was great! Had it for lunch on a bulky roll and as a snack with crackers. It makes quite a bit - I used Tyson canned chicken and made a smaller amount. You may need to adjust the amount of each ingredient to your liking.

This was easy to make and delicious!  Definitely better after it sits for awhile.  I did not add the green pepper b/c we are not fans but good without it! My husband said it was a "keeper" and my 7 year old even ate it--my 3 year old would touch it but that doesn't mean a thing! I think with the nuts, onion and cranberries it may be a little too adventurous for "some" young childrens palettes????  Thanks for posting -I will be making it again in the near future!

This is the best chicken salad I have ever had!!! I made it for my son's 1st birthday party and EVERYBODY wanted the recipe! I omitted the green pepper, paprika and seasoning salt. I just added salt and pepper for taste.

I LOVE this chicken salad. I did not use the celery or green pepper. I also think it tastes better after a night in the fridge. I put it on mini sub buns and also made wraps with this. Love it!

If I could give this 10 stars, I would!  This is a beautiful, colorful and scrumptious recipe!  WOWWWWW!!!!!!  Used it for a Ladies Tea and have gotten tons of requests for the recipe.  I used double the mayo since we used it as a sandwich filling, but fine as is!!

I love this recipe. I usually make it with turkey breast. It tastes better after it sits awhile, however, I always manage to eat some as soon as it's made! I have even enjoyed leftovers for breakfast the next day.

This is a great recipe.  Its a great way to get my kids to eat vegetables without their noticing.  I add carrots and chop all the veggies in the food processor so they never even notice they are there.

Is it just me, or is there something off in the flavor of this chicken salad?  Maybe too much paprika, but it's unlike any other chicken salad I've had.  There's nothing tangy in the flavor,it's just kind of blah. I think next time I'll omit the paprika, and use miracle whip instead of mayo.  THEN it will be 5 stars.  The cranberrys are a nice touch though, I like that!

I really really love this chicken salad... My 5 year old hates chicken salad, but loves this. The cranberries are so good! I have made it twice in a week. I use red pepper instead of green, no celery, and no seasoning salt and it is awesome!
Thank You!

I followed the recipe almost exactly as described (my wife loves avocados so I added them). I believe the next time I make this I will reduce the mayo just a tad. Other than that it was a great way to use left-over chicken.

Should probably have included some notes about chicken seasoning. I went with: apple cider vin, salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, thyme, oregano, and parsely

Add some red wine vinegar and water to mayo (and whip it) to smooth it out. 

And I go with red onion over green onion.

Don't be shy with the paprika.

Made to the recipe, using sliced almonds instead of pecans. Found it a bit bland and dry to my tastes, so added some more mayo, poultry seasoning, Old Bay and garlic powder. Great for wraps/sandwiches.

Great recipe! I used a Costco rotisserie chicken & found the recipe to be a bit dry & bland for my taste. However, after adding a bit of spicy Italian dressing & garlic, black & red pepper I found it was delicious. I added green grapes & substituted toasted almonds for the pecans and served on toasted crescents w fruit. My book club loved it!

I have made this several times through the years for an annual holiday luncheon.  It always receives compliments and the group is disapointed when I don't bring it.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

This was really good!  I made it as is, but I did roast the pecans for more flavor.  I baked up some fresh croissants, and it was so good!  It made a really yummy sandwich.

I served this 3 times during the holidays so far--I believe less seasoned salt was preferred by my guests for the 2nd-3rd serving and just as flavorful!

I’ve been making this recipe for about three years now and it is definitely my all time favorite! Perfect as is with these wonderful flavors melding together. Even better day 2 and 3 that is, if it isn’t all devoured day 1. Usually serve these on croissants and not only are they delicious but the presentation with the colorful mixture is pleasing to the eye. Each time I have made these for a large family or work gathering I get multiple requests for the recipe which I share happily. A side note- these are also delicious warmed up on a croissant or alone in a small bowl. Thank you for this amazing recipe!??????????

I used a rotisserie chicken, which made it so much easier. I omitted the onions out of taste preference and added a honey crisp apple and green grapes. I think this recipe is good as is though and easily modified.

Since there is only 2 of us, I divided the recipe to 1/4 of the original.  Didn't have green onions, so I used sweet onions, and red peppers instead of green peppers, and had craisins on hand so I used those.   It was wonderful.   The texture  combination of the craisins, celery, chicken and pecans made it very interesting to eat.  The flavor was wonderful.  I'm sure it would be just as good with the original ingredients, but I was able to use what I had on hand with no problem.  Will definitely use this recipe again,  as it is now my new favorite chicken salad.

So easy, but really good!  A nice surprise. Took it to a potluck and it was almost gone at the end. I used 2% Greek Key Lime yogurt. It was thick and did not get runny on the bottom of the bowl. I used 3 containers for 12 servings. It’s a keeper.

I have made this recipe loads of times and love it! Usually I make it when we are tired if eating plain leftover chicken. I have substituted almost everything and it is still good but the original recipe is best. Definitely leave it overnight for best flavor.

Love it!  Like other reviewers, I tweaked the additional ingredients a bit.  I substituted fresh grapes for the dried cranberries (not a fan), and got rid of the green pepper altogether.  Perhaps the addition of the fresh grapes helped to combat the dryness that others mentioned?  Not sure.  I felt it had plenty of flavor between the add-ins and the paprika to be delicious.   I've served this to dozens of people and have gotten rave reviews from them.

This was a great recipe, and simple. I, too, like others, have made a version with halved grapes and crushed pineapple, leaving out the green onion and pepper. The addition of Green Godess or Cucumber Ranch adds a refreshing flavor.

This is the best chicken salad ever. A local deli served an excellent chicken salad, which I had for lunch at least twice a week.  Then it closed and I began to search for a similar recipe. This is it!!  I usually use 1/2 cup of mayonnaise and 1/2 cup Miracle Whip. Yummy!

Our family really enjoys this recipe. I have made it a few times.  We usually put it on green leaf lettuce and eat it like a wrap. Today I was missing the bell pepper, green onion, and we were short on the cranberries. In place, I used extra celery, and used dried cherries to have enough of the dried fruit. I usually make it AS is, and this is a great recipe. The only I recommend is if you need it to be lower sodium, you could cut the seasoned salt in half and it would be yummy, yummy in your tummy! IF you find it bland: 1. you need to let it set so the flavors can meld, 2. check your spices, they may be expired or open too long (spices lose their intensity/flavor over time.  Also, it does not state what kind of paprika to use, so I use a smoked paprika.

Excellent Chicken Salad and easy to adjust to your liking. Easy to make and a wonderful balance of flavors. Even my husband enjoyed it and I thought he would not care for the cranberries and pecans! The only changes I made were using Just Mayo (I cannot have eggs), didn't have green onions and added a little chopped fresh chives. I used half the amount of pecans called for in the recipe and toasted them, and it was perfect amount for the chicken salad. Also used a red bell pepper as we do not care too much for green bell pepper. Next time I will use a little less cranberries though as it seemed a little too sweet for us. Hubs had his on a croissant and I used a gluten free tortilla wrap. This will definitely be kept in the rotation when we have some chicken to use up or during the summer months! Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome Excellent Great! Perfect ratios! Texture and taste everyone loved even kids! Used Big Boy seasoning  salt as it has touch of curry which is great w/ fruit- was out of some ingredients so made these substitutions : No green pepper  1/2 tsp onion powder ( scallions) slivered almonds (pecans) and a small apple ( cranberries). Great for lunch or dinner ! This would be wonderful at a shower or brunch too! Simple yet lots of flavors!! Also for new cooks your brand of mayo makes a big difference they are NOT all the same - my grandma swore by Hellman's and so do I!! I used leftover chicken breast I had baked in parchment paper with Old Bay seasoning, garlic salt, and butter -

Delicious!  As is (made it as is first time but without nuts) 5 stars.  But I liked it better when I used more celery, Bells seasoning instead of seasoning salt, and skipped the bell pepper.  And it was phenomenal when I used leftover chicken from this site (Grilled rosemary chicken breasts by Semigourmet).  I still have a bunch of that chicken leftover and I'm going to chop and freeze it so I have on hand next time I want this chicken salad.  This recipe is fantastic!

This recipe was easy to follow.  I marinated my chicken before frying it down to add in.  I also added 1/2 onion and then half and half miracle whip and mayo.  Very good for my first time,  will definitely make again.

Amazingly delicious and festive! Hit the spot after all the holiday fare...very savory. Used frozen cranberries and added golden raisins because I had no Craisins.

Excellent chicken salad! So much better than anything you'd get from the store. I left out the green pepper because I didn't think I'd like it here.  I added just a touch of garlic powder and poultry seasoning. I'd try replacing the cranberries with cut-up grapes another time. Thanks for the great recipe!

This has been my go-to recipe for years.  It was great as written, but I do adapt it now for my family's tastes.

We omit the green onions and green pepper, and substitute cut up grapes for the cranberries.  I love that it's adaptable to what we have on hand and what everyone likes. 

If you toast the pecans, that also adds a great dimension to the flavor!

This is a delicious salad for sandwiches, especially on croissants! I have made it at least a half dozen times, always to rave reviews. The only substitution I make is yellow bell pepper instead of green, just because I prefer the yellow.

This recipe used way too much paprika. All you could taste was paprika and it ruined the recipe. If you make it, definitely cut back on the paprika unless it is your favorite flavor because it is all you will taste.

I love the base idea. I adapted to be vegan and nutfree to accommodate my family's dietary restrictions (using vegan mayo and Gardien Chixn strips.) Served on potato kaiser rolls. Everyone asked for seconds.

The only change I made was leaving out the green pepper as I was serving to someone with an allergy. This made a great item on the buffet that people added to a salad or made a sandwich according to preference and gluten needs. Everyone loved it and it was all gone by the end! Will definately make this again!

Delicious! I left out the bell peppers, used rotisserie chicken and toasted the pecans. It's a great recipe. Even better if made 1-2 days in advance. We served on club cracker and Hawaiian rolls with a little extra mayo. A*

Have had similar in a broccoli salad. The differences are the addition of broccoli, raisins instead of cranberries, and addition of bacon. If you prefer something with a little more sweet or kick, add pineapple. I cooked the chicken in a slow cooker

I would probably add more onion and salt/seasoning and cut back a little on the cranberries next time. But it is a good salad. Will definitely make again.

Great recipe for leftover roasted chicken.  I used Mrs. Dash's roasted chicken seasoning instead of season salt.  Better chicken salad than I can buy anywhere!

Delicious chicken salad with a twist.  The cranberries and green bell pepper add another flavor dimension to this chicken salad.  I normally add extra cranberries because I like that sweetness in every bite.  Serve with buttery crackers and add a little poultry seasoning to make this even better.

The salad is awesome!!! Real hit! I have some modifications: I don't add celery. Instead of pecans I add walnuts. And I add only 2 table spoon of mayonnaise and for the rest I add yogurt (Greek yogurt). So, I make it a little bit lighter... Really wonderful taste.

absolutely delicious, we used a rotisserie chicken from publix and used more vegetables than it asked for to add more crunch. a good tip is to use the skin from the rotisserie chicken, I chopped it into small pieces and baked it first to get it crispy then added it at the end.  I definitely recommend doing that!

I added a little cayenne for some subtle heat to go with all that sweet and some chopped apple to make up for my shortage of cranberries.  I toasted the pecans.  Other than that, I stayed true to the recipe.

A  technique I use is to mix the seasonings with the mayo first.  Toss the chicken into the dressing and blend completely.  When coated add the rest of the dry ingredients.  The dry ingredients get dressed but lighter.  Their true flavors stand out  and their colors pop.  Beautiful and delicious!

Outstanding. This is my go to recipe for left over chicken. The only change I made was to soak the cranberries in whiskey for a few hours. Soaking the cranberries takes this chicken salad to the next level.  Thank you.

I had  to modify a few things due to my allergy to bell peppers and raw onions.  I lightly sauted  some chopped onions, let them cool, and to replace crunch added some chopped carrots in place of the cell peppers.  I didn't modify the spices.  I also used a rotisserie chicken to save time.  The flavor of this chicken salad  was wonderful and everyone very much enjoyed this.

Loved this!!! I replaced the cranberries with red grapes and omitted the green bell pepper and season salt. It didn't need it. Let it sit in the fridge overnight...so yummy!!!

Updated 12/24/2016 - changed my rating to 5 stars.  I think the grilled chicken I used the first time added unusual flavors. I've made this several time since for the family and we all really like this salad. I use boiled chicken and adjust the other ingredients to our taste. It comes out great every time and much less expensive than the deli chicken salad! 
Previous review:
I used left over grilled chicken and cut the cranberries. I didn't have seasoning salt so used a garlic pepper blend and didn't use the green pepper. Served on croissants with Coleslaw for a light meal. May try again with baked or boiled chicken. I think it has potential. Thanks for the recipe!

The only thing I do different is add only 1/2 tsp paprika, add a little regular salt and put a splash of lemon juice to the dressing. It is so good!

The only change I made was to leave out the green bell pepper since green peppers don't agree with my wife or me??.

I HATE chicken salad but had to make chicken salad croissant for a shower. Wow! This was amazing and I had a lot of great comments on it. 

I used a 1/4 less cranberries as there was plenty. I toasted the pecans so they'd be nice and crunchy. And I also added a bit of poultry seasoning snd garlic powder as many suggested.  The seasoning salt I made from sctratch because I don't have any (lots of preservatives and gunk).  I much preferred the flavor of the scratch seasoning salt. Otherwise stayed to the recipe. It was just the right moisture for me. Some might prefer more mayo. I think the quality of mayo and chicken used will make or break this recipe. I used rotesserie from Costco and Trader Joes organic mayo. 

I am now a chicken salad fan, just when I use this recipe though. I'll try this with leftover turkey after thanksgiving.

I ate it on romaine lettuce, made homemade mayo and substituted raisins for the cranberries because I am eating paleo. It was easy to make and tasted great!

I didn't have Paprika on hand (forgot to include in the shopping list), but I followed everything else (used frozen chicken breast NOT canned chicken) and it was a complete success. Everyone at the picnic loved it and kept asking me about the recipe. Very fulfilling and great combination of crunchiness (pecans), a bit sweet (dried cranberries), and very tasty. This one is a WINNER !!!

I added a little chopped yellow onion, overall I felt it was a little fancy. So Much going on in the salad I couldn't find the chicken. But other people liked it.

This recipe was awesome!  Although I don't like when people change the recipe and then give a rating based on the different recipe, I did make a couple of changes based on the stuff I had on hand. I used Sam's club canned chicken breast (easier), walnuts instead of pecans, and vidalia onion instead of green onions. It seemed to have a lot going on with all the ingredients, but it was very tasty. Thanks for sharing and I will definitely make this again.

The family loved it. I changed up alittle. I removed the nuts. And added dried cherries chopped up. And figs chopped.  And instead of laying on lettuce I laid it on large lettuce leafs and we ate it like a taco. And added thin layer of white sharp cheddar cheese.

This is my family's favorite chicken salad recipe. I've made it many times and it always comes out fantastic! The only changes I have ever made was to substitute chopped red onion for green onions. This change depends on what I have on hand.

This was very good. The serving size was a little off unless you consider 1/2 cup of Chicken Salad enough. This, of course, brings the calorie count up to over 600 a serving. I split the difference and made my serving size 3/4 cup. Worth every calorie! I also decreased the cranberries to only one cup. That's plenty.

Nice recipe, the dried cranberries were great in it. I didn't have pecans but I think that would have been good in it too.

I would give this recipe 5 stars because it turned out AWESOME for me, but I changed several things. I think that 1 tsp of paprika and seasoned salt is WAY too much, especially because my seasoned salt has paprika in it. The first time I made it with a full tsp of each, and the spice flavor was overpowering. The second time I made it I only used maybe an 8th tsp of each, and I also added some dashes of poultry seasoning and garlic powder as suggested by other reviewers. Additionally, I added sliced red grapes along with the cranberries and did not add any pecans because I don't like nuts in my food (but I'm sure it would be great for those who do like that crunch!). Finally, I used red bell pepper instead of green. I think if you do the right amount of spices, that, along with the sliced green onion stems is where all the wonderful flavor comes from. This is my go-to recipe from now on!

I subbed apples for green peppers, halved the paprika and dried cranberries. Garlic salt instead of seasoned salt,  forgot the pepper.  A, dh, and I loved it,  E didn't like the celery. Such great textures and mix of tastes!

Great recipe and my husband loved it! I didnt have any pecans so used chopped walnuts instead, otherwise I liked how the ingredient list includes items I usually have in the house so I don't need to go shopping to make this.

This was sooooo good and I don't like chicken salad. I made it to have something different. I did add 1 Apple to mine other than that o made no changes. So good and worth the effort.

I added 1/2 cup parmesan blend and 1 cup chopped extra thick cut bacon. I also put a cajun seasoning on the chicken and cooked it on a charcoal grill. It came out great.

BEST recipe and of course made changes... Used almonds instead of pecans, one onion not two, no cranberried, added celery seed and  celery salt, some carrot, red pepper not green, lite mayo and not a full cup.  We used a supermarket cooked chicken so used white and dark meat...came out perfect and colorful!

Great recipe. I was cooking on the fly - using what was in the fridge, so didn't have any peppers or green onions and was bummed to realize I was out of paprika too. Anyway, made this with curry powder - YUM! Didn't last through the day, though it was intended for lunches tomorrow. Gobbled up with toasted Artisan Olive bread from Trader Joes - no words, just num num noises!

Very yummy and adaptable for whatever you have on hand. I added carrots instead of celery, yellow onion instead of scallions and omitted the pepper (didn't have any of those ingredients) and it came out great anyway!

Great simple chicken salad recipe- love making during the summer. I tend to add whatever I have on hand. Fresh halved grapes, cherries, blueberries or apples with or without the dried cranberries. Since my hubby loves cheese, I usually add some shredded cheese to the mix. And I use a combo of greek yogurt and mayo for my base along with some ranch seasoning to kick it up a tad. Great as a 'dip' with crackers or on sandwiches.

This is an easy recipe. We had nothing in the kitchen, so we used canned chicken from costco, added Dijon mustard, Apple, 1/2 tsp chipotle powder, onion powder, celery, and raisins. Thanks for the ideas!

I was looking for a recipe to use up some chicken that I had and went with this one, so glad that I did. Excellent chicken salad. I scaled it back to three servings as that's all the chicken that I had and subbed red pepper for the green, I misread the directions. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This is the best chicken salad I've ever made.  I did exactly what the recipe said except left out the green pepper.  The pecans and dried cranberries made it perfect.  I had it for guests at a luncheon and they all raved about it.

Great recipe.  I steamed my chicken breasts, and instead of adding the cranberries and nuts separately I simply purchased a pouch of "Cranberries and Glazed Walnuts" which are sold as a salad topping (usually found near the lettuce).  Omitted the green pepper.

I made this using leftover grilled chicken, slivered almonds, and red grapes instead of pecans and dried cranberries since I didn't have any. It was alright, but bland. Needs something more to it, but it's great for a quick lunch.

Everyone request that I bring this salad for the holidays. I put it in endive leaves and serve it as an appetizer. It is a crowd pleaser for sure.

Super yummy. I nixed the green pepper and added 1/2 Fuji apple and 1/4 teaspoon Knorr tomato flavoring and 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder. I served it on butter croissants!

This is a fantastic recipe and (by far) the best chicken salad I've ever tasted!! My husband positively loved this too.

I did make a few slight modifications of my own.

I used 1/2 cup of Ranch salad dressing and 1/2 cup of mayo.
I omitted the nuts.
I added onion powder (to taste)
Chili powder (to taste)
1 heaping teaspoon of pickled relish
I used a red pepper instead.
I used dried cherries the first time and cran-strawberries the second time around. 
So good!!

This is some really good chicken salad. I didn't add any bell pepper because I did not have (next time I will make sure to have). I used some left-over roasted chicken that I made for dinner the day before. This was wonderful. Thanks emmaxwell.

Wonderful recipe. The only different thing I did was add halved green grapes. Served on romaine lettuce. Also served with cantaloupe and strawberries on side. Milly in Buckeye, AZ.

My Go-To chicken salad recipe.  My husband doesn't like celery so I usually omit it.  I often don't have the nuts either, but it's still great without!  I like to make this with the leftovers after I roast a whole chicken.  Thanks for sharing!

I omitted the green peppers & added sunflower seeds, instead of
pecans just as a personal preference.

Southwest seasoning for the chicken while cooking it on the stove top. Forgot to add the bell pepper and my family doesn't like celery. Otherwise made the recipe as stated and it turned out fantastic!

Not bad. Rather than purchase frozen entrees for this week's lunches, I whipped up a batch of this to get me thru the week. While tasty, I'm not sure this will become my "go-to" chicken salad recipe. Admittedly, I made a couple of changes and in the interest of awarding a fair review, I'd like to give this another try following Emma's directions exactly. I made three changes, two of which I'd make again and one that I wouldn't. I didn't feel this called for enough spice, so I added 1/4 t poultry seasoning and a 1/2 t garlic powder. I'd recommend this enhancement. My final change was substituting candied pecans for plain pecans. In retrospect, I would have BY FAR preferred the taste of toasted pecans in this. NOTE: One reviewer suggested "plumping" her cranberries in hot tap water. Although a good idea (I do this sometimes myself), it is totally unnecessary here. I'd also like to note that this is GREAT served fresh, but not nearly as good days later. The pecans lose their crunch and the dried cranberries turn to mush (but I think that's because I plumped mine first...). The type of bread you choose to serve this on also makes ALL the difference. I served my sandwich on raisin bread (as one reviewer said her local diner does) and wish I wouldn't have. :( Whole wheat bread or a flaky croissant would have been a much better choice, IMHO. Thanks for sharing, your neat recipe, Emma. This will be making an appearance at this year's holiday luncheon for sure! :-)

I thought this recipe was ok, but with all the positive reviews I thought it would blow me away a bit more.  I made it almost exactly as written except that I added a bit of garlic powder as suggested by one reviewer.  Well, I felt that the whole thing was a bit salty, so that may have been the wrong decision for my tastes (or leave out some/all of the seasoning salt).

My family loved this and I received many compliments. It's easy to make. I used a rotisserie chicken and substituted half a green apple for the green pepper. Other than that I followed the recipe and it was delicious. I recommend making ahead and letting the flavors meld. I served it on croissants with a fruit salad and chips. I will make this again for sure.

I've seen this recipe recommended repeatedly on The Buzz and decided to give it a try.  I'm sorry I've waited so long.  I have made this several times and we love it.  I usually halve the recipe but I add substantially more green onions.  I soak the cranberries before adding too.  Thanks!

I used this as a base recipe to create something similar to be what can be purchased from the Anderson's Deli.  Delicious!  I used the seasonings listed, but used only chicken, cranberries and walnuts.

I was concerned that I would not like this.  However I liked it a lot.  I will make it again.  I had to improvise on some of the ingredients but was still good.

Great recipe! Nice and easy.
I used the left over Christmas smoked turkey instead of chicken, walnuts in place of pecans and miracle whip in place of mayo. And I like to use poultry seasoning in my salads, gives a nice 'homey" flavor.

This was so good! I made it today for a lunch get together. This is the best chicken salad I've made. I stuck to the recipe pretty closely. Just a couple changes. Left out the bell pepper. Instead of green onion I added finely chopped white onion and then I also added chopped red grapes. I let this chill overnight as others have recommended. I think that really helped the flavors blend together. Great recipe!

I'm not a huge fan of chicken salad, but I decided to make this today for dinner.  We have leftover dark meat turkey so I used that instead and tossed in some cucumber and pickle.  Bf said he liked it but said it doesn't matter bc "you won't make it again anyway".  He's probably right about that, but for chicken salad I thought it was pretty good too.  I just like trying different recipes, so it's not a slam against this one.  Thanks for the recipe!.

This recipe was very good. The dressing mixture has a bit of zip to it which complements the cranberries nicely.I used a store prepared rotisserie chicken to ease prep. Try it on croissants. Mmmmmmm

I just got done whipping this up and it is really good.  I followed the recipe the best I could, I had to use what I had on hand. I omitted the green peper and didn't have the celery on had (I would have used it). I also toasted some slivered almonds because that's what I had. My chicken was already seasoned so only added the paparika. I also cut back on the craisins and added fresh grapes.  I tasted it after mixing and it is really good.  I think I would try cashews (my preference) next time and would definately add the celery.

I thought this was delicious.  I used  rotisserie chicken meat, and instead of dried cranberries, I halved red seedless grapes and used them and also added about a tsp. of curry powder. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written.  This would be great to bring to a party or church function served with crackers.  It also makes a yummy sandwich on whole grain bread.  Thanks for the recipe.  This one is definitely a keeper and will be made often.

Excellent (but I only give 5 stars when I don't make changes).   I seasoned the chicken while cooking.  I also used finely chopped walnuts instead of pecans, took out the green pepper, and served it on a bed of romaine leaves with a roll on the side.

I'm sorry but 3 stars is being generous. I thought it was blah & average & the paprika gave it that strange brownish color of canned tuna.   If you make this at least leave out the paprika.

This chicken salad is delicious!  I taste tested a little bite on a cracker, and ended up going through half a roll of ritz crackers before finally putting the chicken salad in the fridge to chill.  So much for letting the flavors meld together; it was already yummy. :o)  I almost forgot to mention that I toasted the pecans under the broiler for a few minutes before putting them in the salad.    Oh, and I just realized that I forgot to put in the green pepper...oh well.

Followed the recipe, except for omitting pecans and celery- Chrissy has issues with celery. It was a 4.5 from the tasters point of view.

Love, love, love this salad! I think to serve 12, you need to increase this a bit -- 6 cups of chicken rather than four and all other ingredients accordingly. I did just as the recipe called for, but I did shred my chicken rather than cube it, as a personal preference. I served it to my hungry Bunco crowd and they raved!

Awesome recipe!  I followed it exactly and made it for a recent camping trip.  We wrapped it up in tortillas and it was the perfect lunch for camping.  I agree with another reviewer that it shouldn't be limited to holidays.  Delicious!

This chicken salad was a huge hit.  I added a bit more mayo as it was a little dry to suit my taste but all in all awesome.  Enjoyed this salad with friends served on crackers and croissants.

We love this and have it often!  We have it as a sandwich in wheat pitas.  Easy to alter to what we have on hand.  We usually use toasted almonds because I always have them and add fresh pineapple if we have that.

Incredible flavor! I opted out of the green pepper though, because I thought it would alter the already fabulous flavor too much.

Awesome!  I could ate this as is and on crackers.  I made it for my daughter's baptism and was asked for the recipe.  The flavors went well together and I enjoyed the crunch of the celery and pecans.  To save on time, I used a store bought rotisserie chicken.  The breasts were enough for this recipe.  I chose to hand shred the chicken versus chop as I prefer shredded chicken for crackers.

This is a really nice chicken salad recipe that is easliy adaptable to different tastes. I didn't measure anything-- just threw the ingredients together in a bowl and mixed. As suggested in previous reviews, I replaced the bell pepper w/ apples and added halved grapes. And instead of dried cranberries, I usede dried cherries for a deeper, sweeter flavor. I also used candied walnuts from Trader Joes. They're slightly sweet, and give a nicer crunch. In addition to regular paprika, I dusted in a little spicy paprika. Gave it just a SLIGHT kick. Great lunch food eaten plain or with lettuce. Will make it again!

Wonderful chicken salad. Made this for a baby shower. I served it on croissants that were split in half and held together with toothpicks. They were very cute, and I received more compliments on this than anything else.

I was nervous to make this because I hadn't tried it before and I was throwing a baby shower, but boy am I glad I did!  I put it on croissants and I am still eating the leftovers.  I liked it because the onion wasn't overwhelming to the overall taste.  The only thing I did differently was add a little extra mayo because it seemed a little dry.  Wonderful!

One of the best chicken salad recipes I've ever made.  The only thing I tweak is I leave out the raw onions, simply because I don't like them. My husband asks me to cut down on the celery because he doesn't like it but I've found the crispness a nice counterpoint to the chicken. I have no problems with the amount of mayo nor do I have issues with the color -- it's kind of festive. I've used this on regular bread, in pitas, and as a topping for salad -- how fantastic. It makes a lot, so unless you have a large family expect to have leftovers (which I don't mind in the slightest). Even my toddler son liked it, and that's saying a lot!

This is a great basic recipe! My husband is not a pecan fan, so I did eliminate them, but I added some jellied cranberry sauce...just a couple of spoonfuls...and it really made it delicious!!!  Thanks for all the tips!!

This recipe on its own was too sweet.  I think toasting the pecans before adding them in really helps.  I also chopped the chicken into cubes before placing them into a pot to cook with chicken stock, salt and pepper really upped the taste.  I would recommend adding green, not purple, grapes to this recipe so there's the extra tartness to it.  I also used low fat miracle whip to lighten up the calories and fat content and it still tasted good.  I think finely chopping all of the ingredients really helps when making this into a sandwich rather than a salad.  Next time I'll try to add some granny smith apple into it to see if I can get a tangier chicken salad.

I made this for a potluck at my husband's job. I had to leave out the nuts due to allergies and green pepper because husband hates them. That being said, this is a really good chicken salad. Much better than a plain mayo & mustard combination. His coworkers raved about the sandwiches, so that's good. I think next time I'll cut back on the paprika. It just made the whole thing a bit too pink looking for me. Will definitely keep this for the future.

This recipe is awesome. I usually throw some boneless chicken breasts in the crock pot with some poultry seasoning and maybe a splash of white wine until they're falling apart. So easy..so good!

I don't like celery, so I substituted a chopped green apple in the mix, and made sandwiches.  This was a pretty tasty recipe, but I think next time I will tweak it to make it even better.

WEll, I was very surprised how much I liked this salad! I wanted to try something different, and though "cranberries and pecans in a chicken salad? That is different." Well, I really liked the change and I will be making his over the holidays, and in between. I have twin toddlers, and they liked it too~ good, healthy salad for them :)>

This is excellent! My husband couldn't get enough of it. I made it for dinner one night because we wanted something light and refreshing. I served it inside large croissants with a side of fresh mellon and berries... perfect for a hot summer night in the south! I plan to make a double batch so we can have lunch for a week. :)

I love this recipe!  It's great as is written or with modifications.  I have tried it with varying amounts of the different ingredients as well as substitutions.  My favorite way so far, though, has been just as is.

Like everyone else, I love this recipe!  I used leftover grilled, marinated chicken breasts and the flavor was great.  Husband's not complaining about eating leftovers for lunch this week!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this for my husband since I don't care for mayo, and he LOVED it!  I left out the green pepper since I didn't have any, and it was still good. I'll definitely make it again.  Apparently this type of chicken salad is also called "Cape Cod chicken salad"

The only thing I changed was I used toasted slivered almonds and I didn't add the pepper.

This was my first attempt at chicken salad and I was a little leery of the ingredients; but with such high ratings, I figure it had to be good. I used left over rotisserie chicken, omitted the cranberries and bell pepper.  I made it a little too sweet by using miracle whip instead of mayo. Still even so, I loved the crunchiness and flavor. I will definitely make this again.  Next time I’ll try it exactly according to the directions.

This was absolutely wonderful!  I made it for my sister's baby shower, served with 3 types of bread, croissants with it were the best!  I didn't add the green pepper, I didn't want it to take over the flavor.....I added some extra paprika, everyone loved it!  Will make again and again.

Great Taste. I loved the cranberries. I did not have any pecans, but it was good without. I will try it again with the pecans and I am sure it will be even better!

I followed the recipe exactly which I dont often do but from the rave reviews I wanted to be true to the recipe. 
THIS WAS THE BEST CHICKEN SALAD I EVER MADE....OR EATEN.
I cant believe I know how to make chicken salad so delicious. I will never purchase it in a gourmet market again. 
Next time I will make a double batch so I have even more left overs to spread on crackers!

YUM-MY!  This is definately a company worthy chicken salad, but it's so easy to make!  Plus the ingredients are not unusual, so I had them on hand.  I served it in spinach lawash with romaine lettuce leaves.  I was afraid that my fiance might not care for it, as he doesn't like to mix fruit with meat.  He gave it five stars, too!

Forget the "holiday". This has become my standard chicken salad. I sometimes throw in some diced up hard boiled egg as well. The sweet cranberries with the crunchy almonds is the perfect combination.

Super yummy and easy!  We didn't have craisins so we just left them out.  It was still GREAT!
