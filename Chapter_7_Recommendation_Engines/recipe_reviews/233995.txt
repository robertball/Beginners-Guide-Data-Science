I've been making my beef stew exactly like this with the McCormick seasoning package and these exact ingredients and measurements forever.(It must be the recipe on the package). I always brown the floured meat before adding it to the slow cooker and I use low sodium beef broth in place of the water. Sometimes I make this in my pressure cooker too. It's the best beef stew I've ever had.

I thought the recipe was very good but I added squash, barley,corn to it. And when I was done I made a small amount of roux to thicken it. It turned out yummy but the main thing I did was let it cook all day. My family now let's me cook more often ;)

Perfect Beef Stew. I browned beef first too. Only added bit more garlic salt and pepper. My family loved it so much!

I thought this had a good flavor. After 7 hours on low, the broth looked very thin. I normally saute, or brown, the beef first. I never just throw it in the crock pot. This left a lot of impurities in the broth. So, after 7 hours I removed the meat and vegetable and strained the liquid. I thickened the liquid with a little cornstarch slurry and then added it back to the pot with the meat and vegetables. I put it back on low for 2~3 more hours. The broth was still a little thinner than what I would expect from a stew. I seasoned with garlic and onion powder, dried oregano, and a sprinkle of Adobo seasoning. That gave it good flavor. I used 1/2 pack beef stew from the whole sale club. I weighed it and it was 2lbs. The pieces were about 2", so I chopped the larger vegetables that size. I suggest that with the length of cooking time. I did 2 cups of halved colored potatoes. I got about 6 servings. ty

I made this just as stated except for adding some garlic salt and pepper. It still could have used a little more seasoning, but other than that, it was tender and had a nice base, not too thin. It was so easy, I will definitely make again.

This recipe is delicious! Best beef stew I've ever had. I took the advice of some other reviewers and browned the beef before adding to the slow cooker. I also don't care for celery so I omitted that but added about 1 cup each of canned green beans and sliced mushrooms 1 hour before the stew was done cooking. It came out perfect!!

I just made this and was very disappointed with the results. The meat was bland and didn't taste the seasoning. I followed the directions and browned the beef first and added it to the mixture. I cooked it 5 hours on high. I found it to be very soupy. I won't be making this again, but I  would recommend either longer cooking time or less liquid.

Super easy to make and very tasty! Added some garlic powder and salt and pepper. Will probably add garlic powder to the flour dredge to give beef more flavour.

Delicious and very easy to make.  Instead of water, I used 4 cups beef broth.  I also browned the meat before adding to slow cooker.  When it was all done, I mashed the stew slightly to help shred the meat.  Tasted great.
