Used shaved parm and half the gorgonzola!! Tasted completely awesome.  It's a keeper!!!

Also, just cut the biscuits in 4 pieces, did not bother rolling into balls.  Turned out super!!

We really liked this! I substituted sharp cheddar for the parm and gorgonzola. My husband doesn't like either. I baked for 26 minutes, which I think 20 would've been enough. I did precook the bacon, as another reviewer did and added a little bacon grease to cook the onions. I think I will add some garlic next time!

Delicious! The only thing I did differently was that I cooked the bacon on my griddle (I like my bacon crispy) and drained it on paper towels. Then I used a little bacon grease to saut√© the onions on the stove. The rest of the recipe I used exact ingredients & followed directions. Also, it took the full 30 minutes to bake.  This recipe received rave reviews from everyone who tried it!
