What are you people talking about!!! These are perfectely good pancakes with some moderate alterations: 4 Tbsp sugar, 4 tsp baking powder. And whipping the egg whites to a stiff peak then folding it in last make a really big difference to the texture. The pancakes are soft and moist; very tasty :)

I wish I had read the other reviews before making these.  I don't like dirtying two bowls for making pancakes, and they turned out flat, rubbery, and floury-tasting.  My 6-year-old said, "Go back to Bisquick, mom!"

These give truth to the saying "flat as a pancake". They have no fluff at all and very little flavor. Maybe it's because the recipe does not call for oil, as do most of the pancake recipes I have used.

The pancakes turned okay, but without some adjustments to the recipe. The taste was bland, and despite using my hand mixer to beat the eggs and mix the rest of the ingredients in, the pancakes were not fluffy at all. If I ever make these again, I think I'll increase the sugar to a tablespoon (3 tsp) and possibly add at least 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. I also added some oil to the mix; otherwise, the would have turned out extremely dry.

Best I've tried so far!  I'm a single mom with little time and I have a pancake lovin' son. These worked out perfectly, both quick and delicious. I did add just a lil' more sugar and a dash of vanilla the second time I made them, but my son still insists they were great from the start, and he's the one who matters. Thanks!!

I probably did something wrong, but these pancakes turned out FLAT. They were more like cr√®pes. I made this recipe because I only had 1 cup of Bisquick, but after making a few of these and seeing that they were not getting fluffy, I made up a half batch of Bisquick so the family could have some good pancakes. I still won't make these again.

I quickly looked for a pancake recipe and didn't even bother to read the reviews. What a waste of a Sunday morning breakfast.  If there were negative stars to give this recipe, that's what I would rate it!

These are good in a pinch(emergency recipe), since I made them because I had no baking soda, but I would not make them as a first choice.  They're bland, rubbery and tough.

These were great in a pinch!  They do need more sugar however and I added some vanilla too.  I think this is a really good recipe to add fruit to--I did some with frozen blueberries and they were very tasty.  They are a heavier pancake though so if you're looking for light and fluffy this isn't the recipe for you.

This is the type of pancake I prefer: somewhat dense and thin.  I was looking for a lower-in-fat pancake and thought this recipe might do the trick, thanks to no oil or melted butter.  I failed to read the rest of the recipe and instead sifted the dry ingredients in one bowl and stirred up the wet ingredients in another.  I dumped the wet into the dry, adding a teaspoon of vanilla like I always do, and whisked until smooth.  I let the batter sit for a few minutes while I prep my pan, then cook in a little non-stick spray.  My husband claims they're as good as the high-fat, fluffy pancakes, and I agree.  This recipe will be a keeper.

This is a great basic pancake mix. Make it your own with add-ins - I used butterscotch chips...Delicious!

I am not sure why the lady said these were the best pancakes because they were the worst I've ever had or made.... After making the first couple I knew something wasn't right so I tasted one and it had no flavor at all. So I added more sugar, vanilla flavoring, butter flavoring, and baking soda and remixed the batter and they turned out like my usual pancakes. I thought I'd try something new & it was a horrible mistake. They first 2 were rubbery, bland, & inedible. I wish I had read the reviews first & saved myself all that wasted time & frustration.

I also wish I had read the previous reviews. Rubbery and flat. I even used self rising flour so I have no idea why they were so flat. I think it was too much milk. I almost threw it out but I'm a single mom and frugality wouldn't let me. But I will not be making these again.

These pancakes were ok. My kids ate them and said they were ok too.  I think that for breakfast you need pancakes that don't have so many steps. I didn't fluff the egg and sugar so that could be the reason that they were flat. I do have to agree that I won't make these again.

I love these.  They are perfectly dense and fluffy at the same time.  They refrigerate well and make excellent mcgriddles later on.  I love that everything is 2,2,2.

Reviews are garbage but the pancakes are fantastic! Recipe is just fine. Taste good by themselves but because of the simple recipe, you can add whatever you to the mix too.

Maybe I just like "tasteless pancakes" or something, but these pancakes tasted perfectly fine with the recommendations in the comments. I added  4 Tbsp sugar, 4 tsp baking powder, after completely making the recipe! Just add a little butter after cooking it, and it taste perfectly fine!

I do not like thick, fluffy pancakes though, so I don't use any baking powder, and end up with crepes!  Yum!

I followed the original recipe but I did what Sunnyglo said,also what gmariej82 said and added 1 tsp of vannila extract like Marcie suggested. I also mixed in chocolat chips for my daughter. They were good but i think I mixed to long they were a little rubbery but they were good enough to eat.

Great,quick and easy to remember recipe. My kids really enjoy these! If you desire more flavor increase sugar to one tablespoon and add a pinch more salt. Great recipe to add apple sauce or fruit as there is no oil. Awesome topped with fruit or yogurt. What I like about these is that they are a base for other flavors. I don't care for the flavor of bisquick. Also, I mix wet ingredients and add dry to them barely stirring the mix. Over stirring is what makes pancakes rubbery.

I used half all purpose gluten-free flour mix and oat flour then Silk soy milk very vanilla and BAM! these babies came out awesome! Plus I can easily cut it in half without tons of work. So easy to convert to gluten-free. Loved this recipe. They came out better then the dinner I go to ;-)

Needed an oil free pancake recipe. Read reviews. Added baking soda, vanilla, and doubled sugar. Perfect if you love McDonalds pancakes
