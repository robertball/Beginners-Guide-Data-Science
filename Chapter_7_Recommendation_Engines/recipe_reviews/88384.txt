Great granola! I normally make Almond Maple Granola from this website, but I was in the mood for something different. Thanks to JediCook's suggestion of adding cinnamon--it really does taste like an oatmeal cookie. My tweaks were to use old-fashioned oats, only 1/4 cup honey & brown sugar, 3 tbls oil, 1/4 tsp salt, and I subbed sliced almonds for the peanuts. I really love it and will make again.

I made this both with and without the peanuts.  The first batch I cooked for 45 minutes, stirring 3x and found that it was a bit over-done, so the next batches I just cooked for 30-35 minutes and they were perfectly golden.  This mix is amazing and I love that the wheat germ is undetectable!  I think I'll try adding some dried fruit like "craisins" in the next go-round.

Delicious!  I took the advice of Granyloohoo (who always gives great advice in her reviews!) and used 1/4 cup each of the honey and brown sugar, 3 Tbsp of oil and 1/4 tsp salt.  I also used ground flaxseed instead of wheat germ.  This came out plenty sweet and has a very nice crunch to it.  I added 1/2 a cup coconut while baking and dumped in some craisins when I took it out of the oven.  Excellent!

This is a very good granola. A few add ins I have done: Melted butter instead of vegetable oil (weird things happen to oil when it's heated so I prefer to use butter or ghee), addition of cinammon with raisins and molasses gave it an oatmeal cookie taste that was simply delightful!

This is my new cereal.  I refuse to buy that sugar coated junk at the store.  The only change I made was to take out the peanuts (everyone hated them!) and subsituted flax for wheat bran (all I had).  I also sprinkle a TBSP of white sugar on top before I bake it.  I've made this at least five times since I found the recipe!  I do add-ins in the bowl as we all like different things.  YUMMY!

Oh WOW... I was visiting family in a different state and I paid 6 bucks for a bag of granola from a health food store and it had basicly the same exact ingredients as this recipe. My husband and I loved it so much I've been looking for something like it ever since.. I never even thought to make it myself till Allrecipes featured it on the main page this week. This was a SUPER EASY recipe to make and like other suggestions I added about a teaspoon of cinnamon and used almond slivers instead of peanuts. My house smells Wonderful and it's not even fully cooled yet and me and the kids can't stop picking at it... it tastes AWSOME! I'm going to play w/ this and maybe next time add some real maple syurp and a some different nuts, you could have a blast trying something new every time you make this! THANKS!!! This is going to be a regular treat in my house!

Very Good. I did not add the peanuts, but I did add mini chocolate chips. On one batch I sprinkled in some leftover toffie bits I had. mmmmm.
I tried one batch with marshmallows, that did not turn out. I dont suggest that.

Warning! This stuff is addicting! We found ourselves eating this non-stop until it was all gone! This is great by itself, with yogurt or with milk. Thanks for the post!

I make this granola almost every week.  I generally change the type of nuts I use and also add in some dried fruit (like cranberries or cherries).  To get those big clusters of granola I don't stir until the granola is cooled.  I also turn the oven off after an hour, but leave the granola in for another 30 minutes to get it nice and golden brown.  I really good recipe.

This is sooooo tasty!  I think next time I'll increase the sugar mixture, as I prefer a more "clumpy" granola.  Taste-wise though this is spot on, especially if you're like me and looking for a granola without all the fruit, etc.

Halved the recipe and followed exactly except added cinnamon and used almonds instead of peanuts. GREAT flavor, however too sweet for me. I will try it next time subbing applesauce or something with more moisture for the brown sugar because I would also like it better if there were some clumps.

Very nice granola!  It was just slightly too sweet for me, so maybe I'd make it again with a little less honey and/or brown sugar.  Instead of wheat germ, I used a store-bought mix of ground flaxseed, sunflowers, and almonds.  I also used sea salt instead of regular salt.

this was my first time making granola, and it was easy and fun to do with me 3- and 5-year olds. However, it was a little boring for us...we'll try adding cinnamon next time!

This is a great go to recipe for granola.  I ususally make a maple granola but I did not have any maple syrup on hand.  I made this instead.  I followed some of the suggestions by cutting down the sugars to 1/4 cup and the oil to 3T.  I also added some shredded coconut and dried fruit to suit my taste.   Good stuff!  Never buy store bought again!!

Hands down the greatest granola! My kids gobbled this up like mad! I topped my morning yogurt with it and this whole batch was gone in 2 days. We will be making this over and over again and keeping some on hand! The only thing I may try is to incorporate peanut butter into the mix.

First off, this was more like a granola cereal, not clusters.  I made a few substitutions based on what I had on hand.  I used almond slivers instead of peanuts and 2 tbs of butter instead of oil.  I also added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp nutmeg, and 2 tbs of dark chocolate peanut butter.  I decreased the honey and brown sugar to 1/4 cup.  Very yummy!

This granola is simple but excellent. I made no changes and found that thirty minutes was just enough time for the granola to brown perfectly. It turned out fantastic!

Absolutely delicious and dead easy... finally a plain but delightful granola recipe!  I have made this twice so far, once as written and once without the nuts.  Rave reviews from the "testers" both times.  This recipe is a keeper, and this granola will be sent in "care packages" for the nieces and nephews at college.  I'll just seal it up with the vacuum-sealing gadget.:)

YUMMY!!  But full of calories!!  I changed the peanuts to 3/4 cups of chopped almonds, added 1/8 cup flaxseed, raisins, and used 1/4 maple syrup instead of honey, and after all the math I did I still wound up with 310 calories per half cup!  This stuff packs a delicious punch, but watch your portions.  The vanilla really ties it together.  This would make a great gift for my health nut bro... who has a faster metabolism.  Nice work!

This granola was very good. I prefer granola without all the dried fruits and this one was simple and taste. I omitted the sugar and added almonds instead of peanuts.

I made this to send to my daughter in Iraq.  I thought it was just OK.  I guess from the high ratings I was expecting "wow".  Probably won't make again.

This has become my starting point recipe for granola, although I agree with GrannyLooHoo and have reduced the sugar and oil content and have added a little cinnamon. Also, I often add dried fruits but only after the granola has finished baking. That way the fruit stays soft and doesn't stick to your teeth, if you can chew it at all! The exception to that is coconut; I like mine toasted, so I add it with the rest of the ingredients if I'm using it. Enjoy; you may never buy granola again!

With some minor modification (walnuts instead of peanuts), I really enjoy this granola with yogurt or by itself.  I recommend mixing in various nuts if you like a crunchier mix.

Amazing! Add a lil bit of cinnamon and it tastes like a cookie. You don't taste the wheat germ, but get the benefits! I Added MnMs so it's more like a trail mix, wait til after it cools though cuz it will melt the chocolate. Great to put in ice cream, yogurt, extc! Chocolate chips (white or milk chocolate) , dried fruit, and even sprinkles are fun to add to this mixture

This was decent, but I would've preferred some raisins or dried fruit. Something to sweeten it up a bit more and give it more texture.

I have been using this recipe for over a year now and my family loves it.  I sometimes add golden raisins or dried cranberries, but it's great just the way it is and it smells heavenly while baking.

This recipe is fast and delicious. I made it according to the recipe except added a cup of coconut and dried cranberries. Yummy- why would anyone pay big money for store bought granola when they can make it so inexpensively and to their taste at home? Thank you for a great recipe I will use again and again-

I just made this and I loved it.  I used rolled oats, 2 cups, as that is what I had in the pantry.  I also added about 1 cup of raisins, to use up the stash.  Once it was completely cooled, it had a nice crunchy texture.  I didn't think it was too sweet but I do have a sweet tooth!

Very good - and versatile.  I cut the brown sugar to 2 tbsp. and the honey to 1/4 c. Only toasted in the oven for about 45 minutes. Wasn't too sweet (mainly because I cut the sweetness myself) but it was perfect. Even my kids ate it right out of the oven by the fistful. Might try almonds - or whatever I have on hand next time. Maybe some dried fruit or flaked coconut too.

I followed some advice and cut back on the sugar and oil which I may not do next time since I like my granola with some chunks in it.  I also added chopped almonds instead of peanuts and added raisins and chocolate chips as well.  Over all this was an easy recipe that I will likely make again.

Tastes like a mix between a peanut butter cookie and an oatmeal cookie. Pretty yummy, but doesn't clump like some granolas do.

I like this just as written, but I've also experimented with a few variations. I'm not a big honey fan, so I exchanged the honey for lite maple syrup. I also add about 2 tbsp. peanut butter and dissolve that into the wet ingredients. A dash of cinnamon and some dried cranberries at the end makes it perfect! I hardly ever buy cereal anymore!

Great Granola.  I liked it with the peanuts.  I lightened it up a little bit using 2T melted butter for the oil and reducing the sugar and honey to 1/4 cup each as suggested by other reviewers.

Really good! I was on a strict diet and couldn't have sugar, just honey, so I substituted all the sugar for honey, added peanuts, and it turned out great. Next timed I'll add a variety of nuts and dried fruit too.

This was okay.  I made it exactly as directed.  I just wasn't crazy about the peanuts.  I like peanuts but it just didn't fit with this recipe.  I'm going to try another's recommendation and use almonds next time.

I made this for my son's class for Halloween and added candy corn.  It was very tasty and made a nice seasonal snack, but a seemingly more healthful alternative than many other treats.  My son has asked me to make it many times since then.

Wow! This was my first time making my own granola. I don't know why I haven't tried it before, I didn't realize how easy it is! I made this recipe as written, except for using sliced almonds instead of peanuts & sprinkled some cinnamon on the top. I can't wait to make it again...

My DH said it is the best cereal he has ever had.  So, needless to say, he absolutely loved it.  I just happened to come across this recipe and had never made granola before.  I happened to have all the ingredients on hand and soooo...I'm so glad that I tried it.  I will add dried cranberries next time.  I followed the recipe exactly, except to add a small handful of cinnamon sugar to the top while it baked.  Very simple to prepare.  It will be very easy to "play around" with also, i.e. adding a variety of items, like other nuts, dried fruits or coconut, etc.  Thank you for a wonderful, simple recipe.

I made this and it was AMAZING!! I also added 1/4 cup of wheat germ into the oats and roasted them in the oven, along with the peanuts, for 10 minutes, stirring half way, at 350 degrees. After i put the granola in the oven to cook, there was excess on my spoon that I tried and it tasted like cookie dough. The sweet balanced by the salt was delicious. Also I left the peanuts whole instead of chopping them. Great to take on the go and as an athlete, its easy to pack a bag and go to practice with. Next time I may add in dried fruits and take out the peanuts, substituting them for almonds.

FANTASTIC!  I have wanted to make my own granola for a while but have always been put off by the number of ingredients many recipes contain.  This was so easy, and its ingredients are all things I had on hand.  I substituted sliced almonds for the peanuts and added 1/4 t. cinnamon. Absolutely wonderful!

UPDATE: I make this every few weeks and decided to try and cut the sugar and honey.  If you are looking to cut the sweets, it works great with half the amount of sugar and honey.  Still delicious.

Cant stop nibbling!  I haven't made granola in so long.  This was easy to put together.  I didn't put in the br sugar cause I was trying to keep it "clean" as much as I could.  I found it just sweet enough with just the honey but some may prefer to add more honey if they omit the br sugar.  I added pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds then the last 15 min I added raisins.  I will def ale this again. thank you

Wow,just tried this recipe,but instead of oil I used my homemade applesauce and instead of just laying on the tray I put it in a block form so I could make bars and it came out so yummy and practically fat free! I also, like others put cranberries and raisins in the mix.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is really good. The peanuts add a nice flavor to it.  A little bit too much honey taste but that is a personal preference.

Just made this. It's still cooling but my husband and I cannot stop picking at it. We used about a cup of warm peanut butter instead of the peanuts since we didn't have any on hand. Also used melted butter instead of the oil. It is DELICIOUS! We kept it in the oven about 15 mins longer since the peanut butter made it more "wet" in the beginning. We will definitely be making this again!

I know I'm changing this recipe all around and I hate it when people do that but I was really just using it as a base and incorporating ideas from many different recipes out there. So here goes: no peanuts, about a 1/4 c honey and sugar. 1 tsp cinnamon. Heated liquid first before mixing with oats. Saw a method of cooking at 375 for 10 min and then let sit in oven while it cools. May have gotten a tad bit overdone. Granola is super crunchy and has some nice chunks but seems to be lacking some flavor. Will need to punch it up for next time.

Caution:  addictive!  Just can't stop eating it.  Perfect as is but might try substituting chunky peanut butter for the oil.

This is very yummy. I wanted to stay away from sugar so I used honey and then unsweetened applesauce instead of the brown sugar. I used ground flaxseed instead of wheat germ. I used 2TBS of Olive oil (instead of vegetable oil). I upped the vanilla to 1 Tablespoon and put in about 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon. I will eat as cereal and add raisins/cranberries/blueberries etc.

This is a great basic granola recipe.  I did add some ground flaxseed along with the wheat germ.  The add-in possibilities are endless!  Store-bought granola is so expensive and usually very high in sugar.

Very good, our family and everyone else who tried it really liked it.  We reduced the brown sugar to about 1/2 because thought it was too sweet.  Also, if you don't want it to be quite so crumbly I recommend you don't stir as often while baking.  We sometimes just leave out the nuts all together.  It is very good mixed with cheerios in the morning or on yogurt.  Will be trying with Almonds next time, sounds yummy!

This is excellent. It took hardly no time and it taste better than boxed granola. I followed the lower sugar/oil suggestion recommended by others and added 1/2 cup coconut. I also substituted almonds for the peanuts because that's what I had on hand.

I have made several granola recipes from AllRecipes and this one is by far the best.  I make a double batch and eat it in the morning for breakfast or sprinkle it on my ice cream or yogurt.  I also add some ground flax seed to make it even healthier.

I'm so-o excited! This is even better than the organic peanut butter granola I buy!!! I loved the peanuts in it. Crush them into coarse pieces before adding them. I divided one batch into three to try different things and I LOVED the peanut one... instead of peanuts I added crushed almonds to one and it was good but not too much flavor... lastly I added cinnamon and I didn't care for it. Stick with the original recipe,  it's the best and I even love changing things usually!

Family loved this granola recipe and it was very easy to prepare.  Next time I might try sunflower seeds instead of peanuts.  Didn't have wheat germ but it still turned out well.

Really good granola- I, too usually make Maple Almond Granola from this site but I'm out of real maple syrup.  I followed Grannyloohoo's suggestions as far as reducing sugar, honey, and oil, and using rolled oats instead of quick.  I used walnuts (what I had on hand) instead of peanuts.  Had this for breakfast this morning with organic vanilla yogurt and fresh blueberries- so good!

A really good recipe that you can change to suit your own personal tastes. I used a rolled grain mix (oats, rye, wheat, and barley)from the bulk food store, substituted walnuts for peanuts, threw in some sunflower seeds, dried cherries, and as someone else suggested a few shakes of cinnamon. The main thing that I found was that the mix was still sort of gooey after 1 hours of baking and partial cooling. I decided to bake it  about 15 minutes more but was distracted and it was probably more like 45 minutes until I checked it again. It was really a nice toasty brown and this time had a nice crunch to it when cooled. I think that baking long and slow until crispy was the key to a good end product and I definitly would recommend doing that as opposed to stopping at just one hour.

This is the best granola recipe I've tried and I've tried a few.  Instead of peanuts I added dried cherries and almonds. I can't wait to try it with different fruit/nut combinations. Make a double batch, one is not enough.

Delicious and simple!  Also quite flexible; the proportions of sugars and flavors are good and many substitutes can be made with equally good results.  For example I substituted pumpkin juice for water (and added extra) and used pumpkin pie spices with toasted pecans (or walnuts) and raisins (or not) and made a delicious pumpkin granola.

This is delicious but I made some changes. I replaced peanuts with almonds,used few dates and sultanas and very little honey and no sugar as I thought the recipe called for far too much sugar and honey,don’t see why you would need both.  Also,next time I will use black strap molasses in place of honey as I had intended to do so for healthier option but forgot in my haste. Also, used coconut oil instead and some desiccated coconut for texture as I had on hand.  I didn’t use wheat germ as could not find it in my local stores but it was fabulous all the same.

Thank you for posting this delicious recipe, healthier and better than store bought and also easy and quick to make.

What great granola! My husband loved it, although I thought it was a bit too sweeet. Next time, I will decrease the sugar to 1/4 cup. I made the granola without peanuts and wheat germ, but added a tsp of cinnamon. I also didn't stir the batch until after it cooled so that I would get some good clumps!
Update: yep, 1/4 cup brown sugar is the way to go. I also do heaping cups of oatmeal. The granola takes a while to brown, so I bake for 45 min at 250, then for 10 minutes at 375. This is the best recipe I've tried!

I used this recipe but omit the nuts and wheat germ since I didn't have any and added a tea spoon of cinnamon following others suggestions. For the oil I used coconut oil instead then I added raisins and cranberries. I made this into granola bars for my son who is very picky and even HE likes it. Today I'm making this same recipe but going to use almonds. To make the bars I just lined granola onto aluminum foil, folded it up and used something with a flat edge to shape it. Cook for the same amount of time without flipping it and voila. They held together nicely. I ate thi granola for breakfast with milk and it was perfect!

I loved the texture,chewy! Instead of vegetable oil,I used melted coconut oil, and added a half cup of coconut. It was a hit with my coworkers that needed a little healthy pick me up! Thank you. J.K

Very good recipe. I added flax seed and raisins and cinnamon. Next time I will try almond extract too. Keep in mind with this there will be no oat clusters. Do you want them? Keep the recipe as is just add an egg white. Get the egg white as frothy as possible but still leaving a sheen to it. Then gently fold into the granola mix. Also in stead of stirring just spread this out thin on your pan and rotate the pan in the oven.  Another trick for clusters grind about one third to half the oats (before you add the other ingredients) then mix as normal. Works best with the egg white but you can do the grinding process without egg white too.

Great recipe however we prefer to use sliced almonds and pumpkin seeds in place of the peanuts.

If you cook this as directed, it will burn. After only 40 minutes it was burnt. On my second batch I cooked it for only 30 minutes and it was perfect. I also changed the recipe second time around. I didn't add peanuts. I used a 1/4 cup turbinado sugar plus 1 tablespoon of molasses and 1 tablespoon of real maple syrup, just to add to the depth of flavor. I mixed half of this with raisins to use as a stand alone snack and keep the rest as is for yogurt topping. It is now my favorite breakfast item with my yogurt!

I always add mn'ms, which makes it more like trail mix but whatever. My advice is the granola won't look/ taste done after the 4 rounds but IT IS DONE. Lol, I burnt it twice before figuring it out.

This is simple, straightforward recipe that was a success.  The only thing is to watch the baking time.  The recipe says one hour but mine started to burn at 40 minutes.  I was able to pull it out just in time but it was still on the too dark side.  I wanted to give it away as a gift but I'll eat this batch and make another.  I used ground flax seed in place of wheat germ, and cashews and raw almonds.
