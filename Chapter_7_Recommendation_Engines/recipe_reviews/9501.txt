This is PHENOMINAL!  Just perfectly delicious.  I just added one thing which is an old trick I recently learned from a New York State apple farmer who's family has been making hot cider for 150 or so years.  Thinly slice and or chop up some McIntosh apples including the peel into small pieces and drop a small bunch of the apple pieces into each cup of hot cider just before serving.  This makes a wonderful addition to this recipe, which I would say is the best hot cider I have ever tasted.  Thanks so much for posting this great recipe.  IT IS WONDERFUL!

Everyone who is has tried this thinks it's wonderful! I made some in a crockpot at work and the citris turned it bitter after a few hours so be sure to remove the peels if you're letting it simmer for a long time.

Instead of going through all the trouble to buy cinnamon sticks, I used:  1 tsp. Cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, 1/4 tsp. cloves and put that in a bot and stirred until it was hot.

This was a big hit at my party! It was unseasonably warm that day, so many people let the cider cool off before they drank it, and it was still great. I took the advice of several reviewers. To cut down the sweetness I started with a "natural" pressed cider (read: No Sugar Added) and I used all the maple syrup called for, but I used a syrup that had less sugar in it ("light"). The fruit I just sliced up and let float (but removed it after about an hour), and I used ground cinnamon (1 tsp) and ground allspice (1/2 tsp). I will definitely be making this again!!

I put the spices and fruit peels in the ground tray of my coffee urn and brewed it that way. Worked great and was a big hit at my party.

This was very good.  I did change it a bit.  I used a cup more juice, a little more syrup, and instead of peels I just sliced half and orange and a whole lemon and simmered them with everything about 20 minutes.  The whole family loved it.

Absolutely the best cider recipe out there.  I didn't even bother with the bag.  It looked so pretty with fruit slices and whole spice floating on top.  It went FAST and made the whole house smell delicious.

I did cheat and combine two cider recipes I found on Allrecpes - I used this as the base, then tossed in 6 packets of mandarin orange tea and a boquet garni (made out of a coffee filter that I stapled closed) with 6 whole cloves, 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. ground allspice).  I scaled the recipe to 1 gallon and poured it into my big crockpot a few hours before my holiday party.  Once it was hot, I added a dollop of butter (about 2-3 tbsp).  It sounds crazy, but a little butter adds a smooth richness and concentrates the flavors.  Trust me.  The hot cider was a massive hit!  I had another gallon of cider and as people dipped out of the crockpot, I topped it off with fresh cider and a little more maple syrup.  I kept a bottle of Captain Morgan's spiced rum next to the hot cider so people could make it a little more "merry" if they wished.  My two gallons of cider was inhaled by 14 people in less than an hour and everyone was begging for the recipe.  I made it again for Christmas Day brunch and kept it going through the day, with the same rave reviews (but a different group of drinkers).  The maple syrup and butter are key to the great flavor.  I also served Gingerbread Man shooters (equal parts Baileys, butterscotch schnapps, & cinnamon schnapps, w/ a splash of vodka) topped w/ whipped cream - a fun pairing of drinks for the holidays!

I made 4 times the amount in the recipe and it was gone by the end of the afternoon.  The kids loved it as well as the adults.  I used ground cinnamon and cloves, and added an extra quarter cup of syrup.  I was out of cheese cloth so I just let the peel float for awhile and it delicious!  I am looking forward to having this on Thanksgiving.

The perfect thing to cuddle up by the fire with on a cold winter's night! Couldn't find the berries, though. Still was delicious! I also added a bit more of the clove, which the guests found to be a perfect compliment! A definate keeper!

This recipe is hit or miss, simply because people have different concepts of how the like their cider.  This cider, for example, is extremely sweet.  Though I didn't care for it, the people I made it for drank down multiple servings.  I think next time I may down the syrup, up the spices, and perhaps just put full orange slices in the pot instead of the peel.

This is the most delicious drink I have ever had. My dinner guests raved about it.  I didn't have cheese cloth or kitchen twine, so I put everything in a coffee filter and used the string from a tea bag to tie it shut.  I made this in my crock pot, and I put the coffee filter in the cider and maple syrup mixture with the end of the string sticking out of the lid. That let me move the spice packet through the cider to disperse the flavors without opening the lid. It worked like a charm. I made 1 gallon of cider, and I had it in the crock pot on high for about 3.5 hours.   For an extra kick, add some spiced rum to your cup of cider. YUM!

I didn't have any maple syrup so I used a heaping tablespoon of honey instead. I bought a container of Tree Top apple cider and dumped most of it in my crockpot. I used about a cup of pineapple juice that was left over from pineapples on my Christmas ham. I didn't use any lemon. I sliced the oranges into circles and left them in the crockpot the whole time. I threw in two cinnamon sticks, and a pinch of each of these spices: ground cinnamon, ground allspice, ground nutmeg, and ground cloves. It came out wonderful for my Christmas Eve party.

I had a party of about 40 people and served this as one of the beverages.  I increased it of course, and cooked it on the stove as directed, then poured it into one of those big 40 cup coffee makers.  I think I could've cooked it right in the coffee pot but I wanted it to be just right and wasn't sure.  Anyway, it was very popular and several people asked for the recipe including a man who has his own catering business.  I put a bowl of cinnamon sticks next to it.  They were kind of expensive and everyone took a new one everytime they refilled their cup, so I'm not sure I'd do that again with so large a crowd.  I made this with a wonderful local Kansas apple cider.

Good Recipe..a cute garnish for this is orange peel cut with a small star cookie cutter and studded with cloves. It looks great in clear glasses. The stars can be made well in advance.

I used cinnamon and nutmeg instead of cinnamon sticks. Also added brown sugar instead of maple syrup. Then sliced and added the entire orange and lemon, not only peel. It was delicious!

I actually registered so I could review this recipe! I made it for a holiday meeting tonight and it was fabulous! Here's what I did: Half gallon of unsweetened apple cider, 4 cinnamon sticks, 8 whole cloves, a dash of nutmeg, and the peel of one whole orange. I put the cinnamon sticks and cloves in one of those Japanese bags for loose tea and let them steep for about three hours. I did NOT add any sweetener at all and I can't imagine it with any because it was so wonderful without it. No one could believe that it was unsweetened. I took the bags with the cinnamon sticks and cloves out before I served it but left the orange peel in. Everyone raved about it and I will definitely make this again. It would also be awesome with spiced rum or wine. Yum.

one of my favorite snacks. I juice my own apples to make the cider (which is just apple juice with no other flavors) and it came out incredibly good.

This was served as a drink for guests at my daughters first birthday party.  I made it in the crockpot so it would stay warm (we were outside).  It was very good, but I think cider is one of those things you really like or don't.  The people that did like it couldn't get enough of it.  The only thing I will change next time is to either really cut back on the citrus (this time I made it with half of what was called for and took it out early b/c of another reviewer's suggestion) or leave it out altogether.  It seemed to make it have a bitter taste.  Also... I had no cheesecloth but used coffee filters tied with string.  It worked well, so if you don't have any cheesecloth give it a try.  I will probably make this recipe again.

Very good!  I left the cider simmering in a crock pot on low for Thanksgiving and folks kept going back for more!  As I left it sit for hours - next time I'll take out the citrus rinds earlier so it's not so twangy towards the end.  (substituted with Splenda-sweetened maple syrup).

My guests LOVED this.  I combined two recipes to make, what I think, it the best of both.  I used the cider recipe from this and I used the hot-buttered part from another recipe (Hot Buttered Apple Cider).  It turned out so delicious and my guests couldn't stop drinking it.  I put a little dish of the UNSALTED hot-butter next to the crockpot and just stirred a small tsp of it in each cup of cider.  Sounds gross, but with unsalted butter, using this recipe... it was fabulous.  I was very proud serving this to my guests and had to give out lots of recipes.

This was really good. Instead of just adding the peels, I added slices of orange and lemon because it looks pretty. Next time I won't leave them in as long. As a previous poster mentioned, the citrus tends to make the cider bitter after a while. It's important to add the spices that are mentioned. If you use ground spices as a substitute, it won't dissolve quite right and you'll have a layer of spices on the top.

Fantastic!  I didn't read the instructions first and just dumped all the ingredients into the pot, but this method worked just fine and will be the way I prepare it from now on...so much easier!  I simmered it on low for about an hour or so during dinner and it was enjoyed very much by my family for the rest of the evening. This is a really warm delicious apple cider, perfect blend of sweetness & warm spices. I didn't have allspice berries so I just added some ground allspice. I will definitely make this again!

Absolutely delicious.  I loved the texture the syrup gave the cider.  My Wife doesn't usually drink (or even like) cider, however, she would have more if I made it :)

To be honest, I can't really review this recipe since I changed it so much.

I made it in a crock pot and simmered.  I used about 6 cups of unsweetened apple cider, a teaspoon of cinnamon, no allspice, two slices of clementines, a teaspoon of maple syrup, 8 cloves, about 1/2 teaspoon of lemon zest, and 8 cranberries.

It smells and tastes delicious!

Tasty cider.  Made for Thanksgiving and brewed all afternoon in a crock pot.  Made recipe as is except didn't add maple syrup.  The cider was sweet enough as is.  House smelled wonderful and kids loved it.

I altered it a little bit, but OMG, it came out fantastic! Thank you so much!
Here is what I did when I changed it: 
1/4 - 1/3 cup real maple syrup (according to your taste)[and I used Grade A Medium Amber, btw], 3 cinnamon sticks,6 BIG shakes of powder nutmeg
1 orange peel -- peel complete until one long swirl, 1 lemon peel -- peel complete until one long swirl

When I gave a five to kids love it, I just want to say to be careful because, it may be too hot and I don't want any child or anyone getting burned.  This is a really great recipe and I think that this will be a big hit with your family!  Happy Holidays!

I served 2 gallons to a high school group. I used the ingredients calculated for 32 servings except put in half an orange and half a lemon instead of peels. Cider was heating (not quite simmering) for about an hour. 2nd and 3rd helping were requested...not a drop left!

Hi,
I actually have a question: When speaking about 'cider' is it fresh apple juice or an alcoholic beverage? Thanks!

This is the best ever spiced apple cider I have had. Nothing was overpowering. For a double batch, I cut the maple syrup to a scant tablespoon, just used the 2 cinnamon sticks, and used ground instead of whole cloves.  A coffee filter works great for the bag.  I simmered for 1 hour but removed the orange and lemon peel at 20 minutes.  I threw away my other recipes for this drink.  It's that good.

Made for Homecoming after-party.  The kids hated it!  Should have just made the tried and true one from mom.  I personally thought it was ok but way too much maple syrup.

Yummy, I made some alterations based on what I have.  I used regular apple juice since I can't find cider here in Japan yet.  I didn't have cheese cloth so I used a coffee filter and put the sticks, cloves, mikan (japanese clementine)rind, and sugar free maple syrup.  It was great and got lots of compliments!

This was EXCELLENT hot cider, I made double the recipe for a party and everyone loved it, many went for seconds.  It tasted like I spent hours on it, when the only time spent was it sitting in the crockpot for about 4 hours.  I will definately make this a keeper for holiday parties.

Fresh, not overly sweet, and fabulous.  I don't have allspice berries, so I put ground allspice in a tea sac with the citrus rinds and cinnamon, etc.  A new favorite.  I make it once a week now.  This will be a tradition for my young family every fall.  Bring on the hot apple cider!  Mmm.  I just may go make it now.

I love this apple cider recipe.  I tried it at home first and really liked it.  So then I placed it in my crockpot and took it to work and various potlucks.  When using my crockpot, I increase the juice to 64 oz instead of 48 oz and double the cloves and allspice along.  I place my crockpot on high for 30-40 minutes and then let it simmer until it smells delicious.  Some events I take an extra bottle of apple cider and add after it is half gone then turn crockpot setting to high for 15-20 minutes and back to simmer.  If I am going to a big potluck I will quadruple this recipe.  Happy Cooking & Baking!

I LOVE this cider. I make twice as much for my annual christmas party and it's always gone so quickly! I put the spices in coffee filter paper but didn't have anything to tie it so it all came apart and floated around... But that's okay! I fished them out after about 30-45 minutes with a strainer... the taste is still the same :) I love the cider with cookies... sweet cookies and slightly bitter cider=amazing.

Tasty and easy! I used 1/4 tsp each ground allspice and cloves and 1.2 tsp cinnamon and I used a full 2 quarts of apple cider. Floated the fruit in it in a crockpot for about an hour. Then I removed all but one orange and one lemon slice for decoration.

This is amazing. I made this to drink with our Thanksgiving feast and it was a HUGE hit. I made this in my crock-pot on high heat rather than my stove and it worked really well. I left the spices in much longer than the ten minutes that the recipe says, because after ten minutes it wasn't very flavorful. I ened up leaving the spices in for a couple of hours and it came out tasting amazing. Also, I used a gallon of unfiltered, unsweetened apple juice and I think that really helped with the flavor too.

The spices added great flavor, but the maple syrup made it a little too sweet for my family's taste.  Next time I'll omit the syrup.

Yummy! I didn't have whole allspice berries so I just used ground allspice. I also didn't have cheesecloth so I just put it directly in the cider and ladled around it when serving.

Loved it! I had a small party (Seven people) and doubled the recipe... the cider was gone in a matter of a couple hours.
I did add slightly more maple syrup than it called for.
Yummy!

I combined this with the "easy apple cider" recipe and it was amazing.  everyone wanted this recipie.  I decreased the amount of maple syrup though.  I also slice up apples and put in the cider and used them as a garnish

I'd give this 10 stars if I could.  This is THE most delicious hot apple cider EVER.  I followed the recipe exactly, made a vat of it for a Christmas party, and everyone wanted the recipe! The kids loved it, and some of us adults tried it with a dash of cinnamon liqueur, and was THAT ever delish!  I highly recommend this great recipe.

Made this for Christmas Eve and it was a hit!  I found the allspice berries at Wal-mart, no problem.  The cheesecloth I had didn't wrap well around the peels so I just put those in the cider.  Wonderful recipe.  I have an extra gallon left over so I plan on making this for New Year's as well!

I made 23 servings of this hot apple cider recipe for the very first time today and my bunco friends loved it! On this cold autumn evening in the Ozarks, this cider was perfect! I had to use allspice powder instead of the allspice berries. I highly recommend this recipe!

pretty good.  I had to make some modifications though.  Instead of maple syrup, we used some brown sugar.  I had to double the amount of spices...we like ours SPICED!!!  Added fruit as well as the rind...why not?  Make in the crock pot so it stayed warm.  Make sure not to leave the orange and lemon in too long...they can take over.   OK....so I made a lot of changes.  I give four stars for the original recipe....nearly 5 for mine!

Made this recipe 3 times ,crock pot and stove, and loved it each time (so did my guests).  Word to the wise:  lessen the syrup to 3/4 of the recipe amount and don't worry if you don't have all the lemon/orange peels because I've used 1/2 everytime and it's been PERFECT.  Also, don't fear if you can't find WHOLE allspice berrits because I've used 2 ground all spice shakes per serving and it's been PERFECT!! One more thing if you're using a crock pot take out the spice packet after a 3 hrs. because the it will become bittter.   ENJOY - you'll love it!!

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it! I tripled the recipe as we had a lot of family but I didn't quite triple the spices or maple syrup as I served the cider in a crock pot and knew it would be cooking down and getting a bit stronger. I scrubbed the fruit and sliced into rounds, then floated it and the spices on the cider. It looked beautiful! After a couple of hours, I removed the spices, but left the fruit.   This was a huge success. Everyone asked me if I would make it again for Christmas! Of course, I said yes!

Just made this at Thanksgiving this year and it was WONDERFUL! I saw that others had said it was a little too sweet with all of the syrup, so I used the 1/4 cup syrup with a gallon of unsweetened apple cider, and it was perfect.  I also let it simmer on the stove for an hour and then removed the fruit and spices.  Everyone raved about it and wanted the recipe.

Doubled the recipe and made a it for Halloween night.  Forgot the orange and lemon at the store but it didn't matter.. full flavor and tasted WONDERFUL!  A guest said it definitely had a homemade taste and was the best hot apple cider he's had =)

A great recipe. I leave out the maple syrup and the orange and lemon peels. My son thought it had sweetening in it when he drank it. I can't imagine how sweet it must be with the syrup. But all of the recipes I have found so far have sweetening of one kind or another. Thank you for a wonderful fall favorite in my family. It goes well with pumpkin pie.

Everyone liked this cider.  Even though I couldn't find allspice berries it still was a vast improvement on cider out of the jug.

This is outstanding.  I used good quality maple syrup and put it in the slow cooker on high for two hours, along with apple or pear peel, whole cloves and cinnamon sticks. And the smell!  It felt like the holidays.

I made this cider for Thanksgiving and it was a hit! Everyone seemed to really enjoy it. It was easy and really spiced up plain apple cider. I used medium amber pure maple syrup, which added a nice smoothness and sweetness. Five stars!

Unfortunately, I'm the only one in my home that likes hot cider.  Rather than make a big batch, I make single servings in a mug, heating the cider in the microwave, and adding the spices in a tea infuser and just letting it sit for a few minutes.  Amazing recipe, LOVE IT!

I used much less of the syrup than called for to suit our tastes. Not having whole allspice berries on hand, I substituted with ground. I also use lemon juice instead of lemon peel because that too was not on hand. We use our own home-made cider, and now have another way to enjoy it! It was even better the next day.

What a delicious mellow flavor. Thank you - I will be making this for many years to come! An added bonus: my house smelled like a Christmas gift shop after making it! This one and the cranberry cider recipe are my favorites.

I have made this cider twice and it was a big hit both times at my parties. I didn't bother with a bag and just let the spices and peels float around in the pot. Had to leave out the allspice and I used 1 tsp ground cinammon instead of a stick and 1/4 cup of brown sugar instead of maple syrup. The ground cinammon clumps at first, but disolves as the cider gets hot. When I cut the peels,I made sure to use as little of the white part as possible to avoid bitterness. Some of the peels were almost translucent they were so thin. Mixed with red wine, this cider makes an excellent vin brulè as well. Enjoy!

took a little while to get all the flavours infused so need to put this on to cook before you cook anything else. Adding spiced rum doesnt hurt either

I make this exact same thing every holiday season for our friends and families when entertaining. I Also add the fresh apple peices when serving. I make it in larger batches in a large coffee percolator with a filter in the basket.When done we all drink it right up! I came back to find the recipe to share with someone who does not have access to this site. So VERY TASTY Stella Thanks.

Made for Christmas last year.  Brewed in a crockpot all afternoon.  It was sweet, spicy and delicious!  If it were thickened slightly, it would make an excellent pancake syrup.

I made this back in the fall and it was delicious! I dont like really sweet beverages and I thought this was perfect. I may have added just a hint less syrup than the recipe called for- but I cant remember. Just follow the recipe as is.

SO good!  I wasn't a fan of home-made hot apple cider until I made this for a family get together last fall.  My family cans their own apple juice in the fall, and that is what I used for the apple cider. Enjoyed by all... thanks for sharing!

Very good, I did change it a bit. I added more allspice, cloves and cinnimon. Added some motts single serving cinnimon apple sauce for that apple texture, also added some caramel syrup about 2 tbsp.  I left the orange and lemon peel in about 20 min or it will get a little bitter.

This was really good and I don't even like apple cider! Only used half of an orange and lemon peel and I didn't remove the spices after 10 minutes; left them in about an hour and even added more cider and it turned out great.

I skipped the maple syrup, and didn't have the allspice berries and orange/lemon peel.  But my family loved this recipe without those ingredients. I simmered it for about 20 minutes - I'll make this again.

My wife and I did a practice run of this recipe since this is our first Thanksgiving we are cooking together for her family. This stuff is so good we called it Liquid Crack! We couldn't stop drinking it all day yesterday and we ran out to buy more apple cider. This stuff should be illegal it's so good.

This is so-o-o-o much better than the recipe that was handed down in my family. We only used apple cider heated with cinnamon sticks in it.  I will definately use this again!  It gets so cold and wet here in the Pacific Northwest and this fall is colder than usual.

The apple cider was a huge hit!  Everyone from kids to the adults really enjoyed it.  In fact, I'm giving a surprise birthday party for my dad during December and I'm going to serve this as one of the drinks.

I doubled this recipe in a crockpot for Thanksgiving and was a little disappointed. I followed the recipe to a "T" except for the lemon peel. I thought it was a little too sweet, and would half the maple syrup next time and add the lemon. Sadly I had to dump half on it down the sink.

I just tossed all the spices into the pan and added a sliced orange instead of the peels. The  maple is a great compliment to the cider. This is so easy and very good!

There are no adjustments necessary. This is ALWAYS a hit made exactly as the author wrote the recipe. It is an Autumn staple in our house. Sometimes I make it in the crockpot so my family and friends can drink it all day - it is EXTREMELY important to take the peels out as soon as it is seasoned to your taste or the cider will become too bitter. By far the best apple cider I have ever had!

We really enjoy hot holiday beverages. This is great for the kids and also adults when feel like something other than mulled wine. (When is that again?). LOL. Good for your Designated Drivers at holiday parties, too!
Here are some tips:
If leaving it to sit, remove spices so it doesn't get too strong. I put allspice berries and cloves in a tea ball! Don't leave orange/lemon peels in too long or it will become bitter. Add a splash of lemon juice if no lemons available. Would be pretty served with orange & lemon peels and cranberries floating in it.

For a very special treat, we use caramel syrup (like sundae topping) drizzled in a clear ("fancy") glass mug and topped with whipped cream. This will make the kids (and honestly, most adults too) go crazy. Better than a Caramel Apple Cider drink you'll pay $5 for at a coffee shop!

It smells really good...but tastes EVEN BETTER. i used ground cinnamon and ground all spice. I also squeezed some lemon juice in there... Next time i think ill use just a tad less maple syrup...but overall this is great.

This was good and I really liked the idea of it but it wasn't perfect for me. My husband really enjoyed it and that's why I'm giving it 4 stars. I followed the recipe exactly except that I could not find whole allspice and had to substitute ground. I think I ended up using 1/2 teaspoon. This smelled wonderful while it was cooking, but the end result was a little too tart for me. I would probably make this again but make an effort to add some more sweetness.

I loved this! Thank you! I used a teaspoon of ground cinnamon because I did have fresh on hand. I didn't have lemon, either, so I tipped just a little bit of lemon juice in there. This is great. Thank you!

I will definitely make this again...tonight! I absolutely loved this recipe. Others thought it was too sweet, but I thought it was less sweet than other recipes. I like using maple syrup instead of sugar, and I used real maple syrup. The only modification I made was using whole orange and lemon slices instead of just the peel, as others have recommended. I made it last night for a family gathering and it was such a hit that I’m making it again tonight for my friends.

Took this to a pot luck and people went crazy. I used a gallon of cider and adjusted the recipe accordingly. My only change was less citrus. I used 1/2 of the peels suggested in this recipe.

Good recipe.  I made it using 1/2 an orange with the peel cut up instead of the orange and lemon peels.  I also added a handful of sugar as it was a little bitter.  Will definitely make this again.

Made ithis for a chilli cook off along with chilli and cornbread.  Needless to say I was the hit of the night.  This was exactly what I was looking for.  It remind me of the Christmas walks through Greenfield village except I added some spiced rum.  Yum!  People voted this as a winner for best chilli?

This was super delicous.  I doubled the apple cider (I used locally fresh pressed), the maple syrup and cinnamon.  I only used the recommended 6 strips of orange and lemon peels and used 1/2 tsp of ground cloves to substitute for not having whole.  I cooked this on the stovetop for about an hour on low heat and then transferred to a crock pot (removing the bag of spices and rinds) so I could take it to a party.  I will definitely make this again.  Everyone loved it and there weren't any leftovers.

Loved this recipe. The syrup was a nice touch. I use a little less than what the recipe calls for. Therefore making it not so sweet. I get requests for this every year!

Delicious recipe. made it as written, except I added 1/4 tsp of Allspice as I couldn't find the berries and had no cheesecloth so just threw everything in and then strained it. Thank you for an amazing recipe.

I served it on Thanksgiving - it was a big hit. I sliced the orange and lemon thin then 'floated' them in the cider. When I took them out people ate them all - they said they were like eating candy.

Very good cider recipe.  I brought it to a fall bake sale for work and people absolutely loved it.  I did not have cheese cloth, so I let the different items float freely for about two hours before removing them.  Super simple to make and I absolutely recommend this!

So I didn't read the part about the cheese cloth bags until after I already got home from the grocery store. But doesn't matter it turned out delicious!!!  If it's too sweet for some have some hot water near by to cut the sweetness.  And to make this a tasty adult beverage for an even better drink add some fireball cinnamon whisky!!??

I make this for every Christmas celebration and serve it warmed, in a crock pot. Instead of using orange peel, I just use one small Clementine orange, stick the 6 whole cloves in its surface, and float it in the pot. As for the lemon, one 4 or 5" swirl of peel is plenty and it adds a festive look to the concoction. Other than that, I make it exactly as written and it's been a "hit" every time.

Everyone loved it at our Thanksgiving dinner. I used organic apple juice instead of apple cider.  My lemon seemed to mysteriously disappear from the fridge so this was left out but did not detract from the outcome in any way. Optional, add some Cointreau for an adult apple cider. Enjoy!

Really amazing! Just remember to remove the spice bundle and discard if you're going to let the cider sit on the stovetop! Also good spiked - butterscotch schnapps, apple flavored vodka, etc.
