I made this recipe a little different and it turned out divine! Instead of using round stead, I used low fat hamburger. I also used low fat sour cream. To make the soup have more flavor I added two packages of sliced baby portabellas for more of a natural mushroom taste.

This soup was fantastic. Normally my son wouldn't be caught dead eating Stroganoff but even after he knew what was in this he ate more and loved it.

This was OK.  I put it in my crock pot on low for 8 hours and did not cook the steak in advance - just put it in there to cook all day.  I cooked my noodles on the stovetop and added them before serving.  I used a can of beef broth instead of water and took the advice of others and used 1/4 cup of steak sauce.  It was too much steak sauce for me.  I also only used 8oz of sour cream and it was plenty.  I did find this plenty "soupy" but I just didn't care for the flavor that much.  It was almost too rich for soup - more like a sauce than a soup, but way too much liquid to serve as a sauce.

This recipe was ok.  It was good, just not much flavor (maybe add more steak sauce?).  I was expecting more of a soup but it is definately a casserole.

Before I say anything, not every recipe is for everyone. I did not care for this at all. It was very thick, and really no flavor, and 2 hrs in the crock pot is not enough time to tenderize round steak. I followed the recipe exactly. I have now added a can of beef consomme, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce,garlic powder and mushrooms. I am just hoping that the additional cooking time will not turn  the noodles into mush. This is really a beef stroganoff not a soup. Brittany I am sorry;( I know how disappointing it is when someone doesn't like a recipe, but everyone tastes are different and others have liked it so Thank you for sharing! It just wasn't for me!

Top notch kid/comfort food. Husband wasn't too thrilled with it, but the kids and I thought it was great. I upped the steak sauce to 1/4 cup, and deglazed the pan I fried the steak in with about a Tablespoon of red wine. Delicious. Not really a soup, though.

Very good and very easy.   I used extra steak that I had from the night before and just cut up into 1" pieces.  I also added at least 3-4 tsp. of steak sauce.  Thank you for sharing.

I followed the directions, but for some reason it came out horrible....the sour cream curdled on me and we ended up eating out instead.....will def try again without sour cream unless I add it right before I serve it.

Whole family loved it (well, okay 9-yr old just "liked" it).  But I loved it because I finally found a tasty way to use up leftover steak!!!

After reading all the reviews I took others suggestions and made my own alterations.

I used 2 lbs. of ground beef instead of round steak.  I used 3 (10.5 oz.) cans of condensed cream of mushroom soup instead of 2.  I used 3 2/3 cups of water (adding one more cup of water.)  I used 2 tsp. of steak sauce, instead of 1 tsp.  I added 2 tsp. minced garlic and 8 oz. of fresh portabella mushrooms with the onion and sauted in olive oil.  I added salt and pepper to taste.  I added a pinch of red pepper flakes for some heat.  I added 2 tsp. dried parsley and 1 tsp. prepared dry mustard.  All added to slow cooker with meat.

Instead of adding the noodles to the crockpot, I kept them separate and used for serving with the soup mixture.  I also stored the noodles separate from the soup mixture to keep them from absorbing all the water in the soup.  

I hope this helps others in making this delicious and tasty soup!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I was in the mood for a thinner cream soup so I made with only 1 can cream of mushroom soup and used only about 1/4 c sour cream. I also only had 1/2 lb ground beef so I threw in some chopped broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, and celery to supplement. I browned the ground beef and veggies with garlic and some cayenne, then drained. Then added 3 cups beef broth instead of water and a splash of red wine. Brought to a boil, then reduce heat and simmered about 10 mins. I used an immersion blender to get the big chunks of veggies smaller. Then added cream of mushroom soup, heated through. Then removed from heat and added sour cream so it wouldn't curdle. Finally, added cooked egg noodles. I would make this again but definitely add fresh mushrooms. This was a good base recipe for me to adjust to my own taste and what I had on hand. I wanted a cream soup but had no milk on hand. The canned soup and sour cream did the trick. I also think fresh parsley would be a great addition. Yummy lunch to make on a day off!

This recipe was utterly tasteless. It was a complete waste of time and money.  I even went as far to add ingredients (mushrooms, pressed garlic, and substituted in a can of golden mushroom soup) for more flavor.  Nope.  Still sucked.  I will never understand why people post such useless recipes online.

This was pretty ok. I did make a few changes. For extra flavor I used Golden Mushroom soup and 2 beef bullion. I didn't do the Cream of Mushroom and steak sauce.

I did alter the recipe, but primarily the cooking method.  I cooked the beef in the slow cooker all day, then added all the ingredients on the stovetop.  I used fewer noodles and had to add more water (could be due to stovetop cooking).  I added more steak sauce (1 TBSP) because I enjoy the taste of it.  I would also recommend using small noodles; I used wide and they were hard to get on the spoon.  :-)

This is a good recipe...it is very thick and much better the second day.  I used 1/4 cup of steak sauce and garlic cream of mushroom soup.

Terrible. Didn’t even vaguely resemble soup. More like a casserole.

My husband made this and we love it!  We did a little prep work the night before by searing the meat and my husband made his own mushroom sauce (as we don't use canned soups) which is so much better than canned soup.  We did us the advice from another comment and used 1/4 C of steak sauce.  I cooked the noodles half way then added everything to the crockpot and it was perfect!  We will be making this again and again!  Thank you.

I wasn't a huge fan of this recipe. It has potential, I am a bit of a greenhorn when it comes to cooking so I have no idea what it needs to spruce it up.

A bit bland, but still pretty darn good. Will tweak it more next time around. Thanks!
