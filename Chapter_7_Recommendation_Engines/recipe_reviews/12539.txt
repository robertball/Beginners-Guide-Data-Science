Absolutely delicious! I went along with a lot of the modifications; I went with the graham cracker crust instead of the regular pie crust, I used banana pudding instead of vanilla, and I added an extra ounce of chocolate.  I also used semisweet chocolate chips instead of squares.  It ended up being perfect.  I didn't feel like turning on the oven just to toast the coconut, so I used 1/2 tsp of butter and toasted the coconut in a pan.

Loved the combination of flavors in this recipe.  I doubled the banana and the chocolate (semi-sweet chips).  I don't think I would use cool whip again, though.  It oozed off of the pie and made a mess.  Next time, I will refrigerate the pie first and then add fresh whipped cream at the last minute.

I won a pie baking contest with this recipe.  It pleased everyone---the chocolate lovers, the coconut cream die-hards and the banana fans!

Oh my! This was fantastic...I used dark chocolate and a premade grahm cracker crust. I had some strawberries so I added a layer of those. I skipped the Coconut as I'm not a big fan. For extra decadence I melted some dark chocolage and drizzled generously over the top of each piece right before serving. The contrast between bitter and sweet was wonderful!

Pretty good, and fairly easy to make. I used a "cook" banana pie filling instead of the vanilla instant. I couldn't find an instant one that didn't have hydrogenated oil. Topped the pie off with whipped cream, sweetened and with coconut rum in it. Yum!

Loved by everybody. I added a little more chocolate and doing it again I'd add more banana slices (I'd do two layers rather than one) and less coconut to the pudding. Very good either way!

For my chocoholic family, I used an Oreo cookie crust, and White Chocolate pudding.  It was an amazing combination, and everyone loved it!

This makes an awesome pie! Very easy recipe with great results. I put extra bananas in mine and my family LOVED it!
My husband requested more chocolate, so next time I might shave some chocolate on top along with the toasted coconut.

The taste was certainly five stars. I must have done something wrong because it turned out soupy. I dished it up in and ate it like pudding. I'm sure it was something I did wrong because none of the other reviewers had that problem.

I cant imagine why anyone wouldnt love this. I used a Marie Calander frozen pie crust -excellent. Added a little extra chocolate and a touch of dark rum; maybe a 1/2 tsp....It really added nice flavor. Extra Bananas. White chocolate pudding, because thats all I had on hand, and toasted the coconut. On a side note; I refrigerated pudding so it would thicken up and then added coconut in with a wire wisk. I used only 1c of coconut in the pie and topped it off with remaining...Amazing!

So good, I've made it many times already. I've done it with and without coconut, both are great. I also leave out the whipped topping and add some sliced almonds on top. I use graham crcker crust like others suggested and milk chocolate morsels. I've done it with banana pudding and vanilla pudding and either way tastes great.

made this last night after reading the suggestions, i used a graham wafer crust, omitted the coconut, used banana pudding instead of vanilla and doubled the chocolate...  I waited to add the cool whip until the pie had cooled... i put it in the fridge to harden then added the cool whip some cocoa powder and topped it off with chocolate chips for the garnish!!  Absolutely delicious!!!!  Everyone loves it!!

Very good.  After reading the reviews, I used the graham cracker crust, which was great.  I did half coconut and half without to make the family happy and both halves were delicious!

Came out soupy for the 1st take. Second take- I added more bananas and tried to make the vanilla pudding a little thicker. Looks good!

So easy.  Followed recipe exactly, except we used a graham cracker crust since we like it better than pie crust.  Yummy.

Made this on Sunday night served on Tuesday after dinner, was very good, just added an extra 1/2 of bakers chocolate, and shaved some choc on top, was very good and easy.  I did not add coconut, I just don't like it.  I will make this pie again.

Very simple recipe with excellent results. Not much banana flavor so I may use banana pudding and/or a dash of banana liquor next time. Added sliced strawberries on top which had the kids calling it the 'banana split pie!' First dessert gone at the birthday party this weekend. Thanks so much.

Delicious, quick, and easy!
I like using an Oreo Crust and doubling the chocolate.
Also, Banana Cream Pie Pudding mix makes this extra yummy!
I'm not a super fan of coconut, so I usually just leave it out. 
I made this for a yummy summer treat at the lake and my aunt couldn't stop helping herself to this scrumptious pie.

This recipe was delicious. I did use white chocolate pudding instead of vanilla simply because it was what I had available. A hit at our house! And so simple to make.

This was really delicious. It's the first chocolate banana cream pie I've ever made and I will make it again. The bottom turned out hard because of the chocolate so it was difficult to cut but to be fair I only had a wimpy knife on hand. My bananas did not sink into the chocolate as much as in the picture, I think next time I will place them on top as soon as I pour the chocolate. I'm not good at applying whipped cream (I made my own) so it didn't look great but it tasted great! I left out the coconut because not everyone at my work likes coconut but next time I'll include it.

This pie was amazing.  instead of a deep dish pie crust i used 2 graham cracker crusts and made 2 smaller pies. This is definitely a keeper for future recipes.

I modified this and used a graham cracker pie crust, banana pudding instead of vanilla and it came out runny - delicious but runny. I also substituted hot fudge topping for the bottom layer and froze that for two hours before adding the top layer.  I will keep reading these reviews for suggestions so next time it doesn't come out runny.  I'll definitely make it again.

The recipe is super easy but I would make a few changes. Definitely use banana pudding instead of vanilla, otherwise the banana flavor is lost. I would also change the chocolate layer. As is, it's very hard and makes the pie difficult to cut. I think a chocolate ganache layer would work a lot better.

Best tasting pie! This recipe was SUPER easy. It is my mom's new favorite pie. Be sure to use the JELLO brand instant pudding mix. I tried to get away with an off brand and it just didnt turn out the same.

Delicious, I only wish there was more chocolate in this recipe than what it calls for.  The family loved it!

I am not going to rate this recipe since I did make quite a few modifications based on the other reviews.  I used a graham cracker crust, banana pudding, and did not use coconut (I think coconut would be great, but my husband does not like it).  This will be added to my permanent file.  Thanks!

This was a great mix of flavors - all of my favorite pies in one. The chocolate flavor is pretty subtle. Next time, I might try doubling the ingredients for the chocolate layer and using a graham cracker crust.

This was fabulous!  Plus, it was so easy that my six year old and I quickly made it together....always a plus.
That little extra layer of chocolate was perfect.

This is not my favorite, but everyone liked it. I took the advice of other reviewers and added more chocolate and if I make this again I will double up on the bananas because as the recipe is written it mostly tasted like pudding and could use more bananas for flavor.

Delicious.   Mine never really setup.  Its entirely possible this is because I left out the coconut.  It just sounded like too many flavors.  Instead I did 1 layer of banana slices and then mashed the rest (about 1 & 1/2 bananas) and stirred that into the pudding mixture.  Its absolutely delicious pie soup.

3 stars, to be revised later after attempting a second time.

Very, very good and so quick/simple to make.  It was a big hit today.  Since I have chocoholics around, I doubled the chocolate and used a chocolate crumb crust.  I also used vanilla chocolate chip pudding.  Very tasty.  I would recommend it and I will make it again.

As written, this might be ok.  With modifications, this could be great.  I put fresh shredded coconut in the pudding and didn't like it.  If your guests aren't told it's coconut, it has this unpleasant tang and texture.  I will redo without the coconut.  Also, my family prefers graham cracker crusts for a banana cream pie.  For best results, make your own crust, your own custard or pudding, and fresh whipped cream.  It will taste worlds better.

I only used the chocolate layer portion of the recipe for my pie.  It turned out delicious!  Makes enough to cover the crust with a decent sized layer of chocolate.

Very good and easy to make!  I used a graham cracker crust and whipped up some heavy cream for the topping.  I made it the night before and added the whipped topping right before serving.

This is my boyfriends favorite pie, and sometimes I must make two just to get a piece for myself! Everyone who has ever tried it  raves and raves about how fantastic it is! I sometimes use a little less coconut, and often make my own crust with the french pastry crust recipe from this site, with a little cinnamon (1 tsp) added to the crust. I used hershey dark chocolate baking squares for the chocolate in this recipe and always make my own whipped cream with sugar, vanilla, and stabilizer. Always turns out perfect!! A must make pie for any occassion! You can dress it up nicely by piping the cream on top or making chocolate shavings to place around the edges.

Very good, I made a few changes. I used an extra servings size graham cracker crust, 3 bananas, banana pudding, 2 tbsp milk, 1 tbsp butter and 1/2 cup chocolate chips. Also I decreased the coconut to 1/2 cup. I made double layers as in lasagna. Turned out great

This pie tasted absolutely delicious, although it could have used a bit more chocolate and it was a bit hard to cut because of the hardened chocolate. My boyfriend and I made it this afternoon and served it to our friends as well, and everyone loved it. Thanks for the recipe!!! :)

This pie rocks! Every other week, my sister and I make dinner so our mother can take a break. We made this as the dessert and everyone LOVED it. As soon as mom spooned it into her mouth she said: "okay, I have a new favorite!". I suggest you use cool whip as the whipped topping and be generous with it! As well as the coconut! Really delicious...and easy to make!

DELICIOUS!!!! Everyone Loved this dessert and it is SO easy!  I've made this several times.  Just be careful if you're making your own crust and you're using a glass pie plate, make sure to grease the plate.  I had one instance where the crust wasn't cutting well (but that was my own mistake.)

This recipe gets 5 stars just for being so quick and easy!  I would have loved to have used a graham crust as other suggested, but alas, the prepared ones were sold out.  It was still great in a regular crust.  I used three bananas which was great.  Next time I would double the chocolate and perhaps substitute the vanilla pudding with either chocolate or banana.  Great pie!

Once again, I fell for all the hype and decided to try this pie. I didn't like the flavor of this particular chocolate. I used Baker's semi-sweet chocolate squares. It came out tasting slightly bitter and didn't help the pie overall. Also the pudding layer was not firm enough for a pie and I thought the addition of coconut was unnecessary. My boyfriend didn't like it either and declared it didn't have enough of a banana flavor, even thought I added one more than the recipe called for. He asked me to look for a better pie.

Oh this is decadent for sure. Very simple to make.
Did not have a deep dish pie crust so used the regular and that worked out fine.  My husband has the sweet tooth in the family and he asked when I was going to make this next, when he hasn't even finished this one...silly man.  Anyhow, kudos to Holly for a great recipe!

The kids didn't care for it (why is there crunchy stuff in here!), but I thought it was good for what it is...Quick banana pie that's not from scratch, but it gets the job done.

Loved by all. I made several modifications to fit our family's needs. First, I reduced the amount of shredded coconut to 1 cup. I also used a large package of vanilla instant pudding (5 ounces) and used 2 cups of milk to be in proportion with the pudding. For the chocolate, I found that we had no squares, so I used semisweet chocolate chips (1/2 cup). Finally, instead of putting the whipped cream on before refrigerating, I put on a dollop as I served each piece. However, I don't think that the whipped cream (or Cool Whip) is absolutely necessary if you are looking to cut a few calories. This is a great recipe and by far the best banana cream pie recipe I have ever had. The chocolate layer adds a lot.

Okay, so this pie was literally gone within 10 minutes of it leaving the fridge. I barely got a slice of this masterpiece! I only did one thing differently: I doubled the amount of chocolate in the bottom because it just didn't seem like enough. It turned out perfect after I did that, and it also set very well, not a single slice broke. Everyone loved it and I got the golden compliment of approval from my grandmother and mother. With this pie, I finally earned my place among the women in my family who know how to cook like pros. Thanks for the recipe, I will definitely be making again.

This was pretty good, however; it was way too much coconut for me & i love the stuff. I used a graham cracker crust, and topped with toasted coconut. will make again, but with less coconut and perhaps more nanners.

I thought this pie was ok.  There was WAY too much coconut and I love coconut!  It seemed to take away from the pie.  Next time I would definitely make it without the coconut.

This recipe was great, except 3.5 ounces of instant vanilla pudding is a bit too much, the next time I used 1 ounce package and followed the directions on the box (Jello low fat) and worked great!

YUM!we all love chocolate/banana... however we dont all love coconut so i omitted that.  we used oreo pie crust and after chilling pie for a couple hours, added crushed oreo to the top and a dollop of cool whip to each individual slice.  *deffinately double the semi-sweet choc and the banana :)

I would give this 3.5 stars; the (single) men I served it to gave it a 4.5.  I have found they think anything they didn't have to cook delicious.  I think this tasted like cool whip, vanilla pudding, bananas, and chocolate.  There was no marriage of the flavors.  I think it would have been much better with something added to the pudding.  Maybe the coconut brings it all together.  I didn't use any because none of us like it.  I think I would put a little sweetened condensed milk into the pudding - or SOMETHING!

I've made this pie a few times before and made the suggested edits that other reviewers have made (graham cracker crust, more chocolate, but I added more coconut b/c I love coconut).  It turns out so well my fiance asks for it every birthday.  But this year, I was so busy I didn't have a chance to buy coconut so I just winged my own edits.  In addition to 3 oz of chocolate, I added 5 tablespoons of peanut butter and a splash of soy milk and melted it in the microwave.  Then I spread it on the bottom of the pie crust and crumbled about 10 peanut butter-filled pretzels over it before the banana slices went in.  It was awesome!!!

Very good but not rave reviews from my family.  I guess because if we're going to mix chocolate and banana we'd like to really have more chocolate.  I think we'll try it again, but with chocolate pudding.  The thin layer of chocolate on the bottom seems to need more company! ;o)  Thanks for sharing this.

I thought this recipe was just okay.  There was too much coconut, and we like coconut, and the pudding tasted instant -there was nothing added to liven it up.

This was so, so good!  My husband can't wait for me to make it again.  I used a regular pie crust as the recipe suggests.  I know many people have said to use graham instead, but we felt it was best with a regular crust.  I did use banana cream pudding, but I think I might try vanilla next time & add 3 bananas rather than 2.  I think the amount of chocolate the recipe calls for is perfect, any more would be too much.

This was pretty good.  I added extra chocolate (another half serving).  Next time I'll definitely use banana pudding though.  It just didn't have enough banana flavor and I added extra bananas. I wanted to use graham cracker crust but they didn't have it at the grocery store I went to.  I'm sure that would help a lot too....

Excellent recipe, it's a huge hit everytime I make it.

To make it a true no bake, I used a graham crust instead of a pie crust which goes over better.

I took this to a potluck at work and everyone loved it!  If only they knew how easy it was to make.

I took this pie to an friend's family function, and it was served as the main dessert.  Everyone raved about how great it tasted.  It was very refreshing!

This is a big hit with my husband.  He loves the balance between the bananas and the chocolate.  A true chocolate lover will enjoy this.
