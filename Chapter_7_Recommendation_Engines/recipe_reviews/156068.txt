We tried half a batch in hopes of finding a recipe to help use up the last of the garden's produce. We are usually not huge relish fans, but my mother, sister, and I actually enjoyed this one! We had to try it that night on brats. I am making a whole batch today with the kids. They are great helpers with the prep work.

My husband goes shopping for the vege's just so this get's made.  He absolutely loves this relish.  He wants it everyday on sandwiches I make for his lunches.  And he is not a tomato lover, just this relish has him over the top.
