Prepared beef tenderloin for a crowd but followed the original 4 servings for this sauce because we never serve anything on filets other than the salt, pepper, and seasonings put on the meat before grilling. I was in the mood for something a little different and chose this, thinking I would be the only one interested in trying it. I was wrong and should have tripled this! Everyone that tried it wanted it and I had to promise there would be enough for everyone next time. I followed the recipe except I had used my shallots in another side dish and only had Vidalia in the pantry. This worked out perfect in our opinion and I wouldn't hesitate to make it the same again. This sauce is delicious and the bacon goes perfectly with the tenderloin. Thanks for sharing!

This was ALMOST a 5/5.  It had really good flavor.  The half and half was not enough, ended up adding a total of 1/2 C.  Also ended up adding sour cream to thicken and add a little tartness.  Ended up being restaurant quality.  Pairs beautifully with the steak.

This recipe has good instructions for preparing filet mignon, which was helpful as I couldn't remember exactly how to cook it. The sauce was okay, but rather bland and needed something more.  Since it's made of basically bacon grease, butter and cream, you may be better off going for a more flavorful and healthy recipe.

This is a great recipe. Add a 1/4 cup of white or red wine and a 1/2 cup of sliced mushrooms to the sauce, stir until you get your desired thickness.

I made this dish for company last night and ended up using double the half and half.  I also made my sauce first and kept it warm under a heat lamp so I could visit with my friends and when ready grilled the steaks on the stove top grill, which really required no concentration.  Served this with asparagus and thick sliced beefsteak tomatoes drizzeled with basalmic and olive oil.  A very fine meal!

This was an excellent sauce that is quick and easy to prepare and is full of flavor.  I substituted minced garlic for the shallots.

This sauce was outstanding!  It perfectly complimented the beef tenderloin and my family loved it!  I substituted chopped pancetta for the bacon to use up some leftover pancetta and added more half-and-half to make the sauce creamier.  We also added a steak rub to the tenderloin before grilling it.  We'll definitely be making this recipe part of our Christmas tradition!

This recipe was fantastic!  I used this recipe for the bacon cream sauce and it was phenomenal!  Made the perfect Valentine's Day Dinner, paired my filets with lobster tails and viola.  I didn't have shallots, used red onion instead, and added chopped garlic...Wonderful!!

We went about this a little differently and embellished upon it as well, the result being beyond 5-star excellent.  Hubs simply pan seared the steaks in a cast iron skillet in a combination of butter and olive oil, butterflying mine to guarantee it would cook to my preferred medium well, leaving his thick and luscious, cooked to a perfect medium rare.  This time I did not want a charcoal flavor on the steaks.  Since we used bacon-wrapped filets, I did not include bacon in the sauce. Once the filets were cooked and set aside to rest, I prepared the sauce in the same pan, removing most of the drippings.  I added a little butter, maybe a tablespoon, and cooked one, just one, chopped shallot.  Rather than  half and half, I stirred in heavy cream and 1 T. whole grain mustard.  Three minutes was more than  adequate to thicken the sauce.  In fact, I found I had to add a little cream just before serving to thin it out a tad.  I plated this by spooning some of the sauce on the dinner plate, topped it with the filet,  and then topped each filet with a few beautiful and exotic wild mushrooms.  I served this with boiled new potatoes and steamed asparagus, scattering fresh chopped parsley over all. This was absolutely the finest dinner I've had in some time, either at home or out.  Hubs said this was another one of those "make again" dinners he'll never see again, which is his highest form of compliment.  It was not an inexpensive dinner but we enjoyed and savored every dollar of it.

I have to agree with Elizabeth32 - be sure to make your sauce first and keep it warm.  I always let my meat "rest" before serving or slicing...  but the way this recipe reads, the meat is resting for close on or over 15 minutes.  Way too much for little tenderloins.  A big roast, maybe, but not a small cut of meat.  It will be cold, yech!

I also think there is way too much fat in total.  You can get the same flavour and creaminest without all the fat.  You can even use 1% and just need to reduce the sauce.  Or not use the fat from the bacon and use a heavier milk product...  not need to use both...  think of your arteries!

I made this for Valentine's Day and enjoyed it.  I thought the butter and the bacon fat was just too much grease, so I drained the fat.  I kept it in reserve in case I needed the flavor, but never used it.  One day I may make this without draining the fat just to see how it compares.  When I tasted the sauce before serving it, I wasn't sure about it.  The tastes didn't seem to go together, but once I tried it with the steak, I really enjoyed it.

This recipe was good. I didn't really care for it on my filet though. I ended up with a bunch of saude leftover and the next day I used it to make a bacon flavored Mornay sauce. This sauce made a great mac n' cheese!

Reading this recipe led me to feel that the imbalance of ingredients and the method of cooking would result in a blandness. I cooked it to the letter (disregarding of course the suggested temperature on a meat thermometer, learn to use the finger method for rare, medium rare/rare, and if you must medium rare) and it was as I expected, but edible. As most cooks already know,the tenderloin is an expensive cut of meat and yet not the most flavourful and does need perking, so I modified this recipe.. I cut my steaks two inches thick and to retain the juices I spring seared them on a very high heat in a grill pan ( I never use a barbeque for fine cuts) then plated them under a tent of foil to allow them to continue cooking to a medium rare/rare. I omitted the butter and used a little raw sugar to quickly help to caramelize the shallots and used prosciutto crudo and mingled it with the shallots quickly (30 seconds) and then stirred in some creme fraiche.
Much better for flavour and structure. After plating, this can be flambed if desired.

This cream sauce was to die for, I did not drain the grease and added a tablespoon of flour to thicken it up slightly.

This was very good, however, I advise cooking the bacon first, draining it and then crumbling it up before using it.  Otherwise it is too greasy.  I had to add salt to the sauce.  Other than that, great recipe !!!

Absolutely LOVE this sauce!  I make this all the time but usually double the sauce.  I also use a couple more slices of Bacon than the recipe calls for and I always marinate the steaks. I've also used onion in place of the shallots before and it still turned out wonderful.  Definitely need to simmer the sauce for much longer than 8 minutes in order for it to thicken though.

This has the potential to be a five-star recipe, but as written it is just too rich, rich, rich for our tastes.  I only used two slices of bacon and it was still way too rich.  I didn’t have shallots so I used green onions instead.  I made the sauce in the afternoon and refrigerated it, reheating it while Hubs was grilling the filets.  The bacon grease didn’t want to stay incorporated and kept separating out.  I definitely plan to make this again, but I will drain off most, if not all of the bacon grease.  It will still be rich and just a small amount is needed for each steak.  I garnished this with green onion tops and a few bacon pieces that I had reserved.

This was amazing. Like others, we found it needed a bit more cream for the sauce and we only used 3 shallots. The sauce was more of a topping, but paired perfectly with the beef. 
Added some buttered carrots, asparagus and Pinot Noir. It was even better than most restaurant steaks I've had.

Made this for my fiancé and myself and he said it was the best meal I've ever made! It was so tasty and easy to make. I added a little more bacon because I love bacon! I don't own a grill so I set the oven on broil and cooked each steak 5min each side for med rare. YUM!

This was very good.  I halved the recipe because I only had two filets.  Even though I halved it, I used more than a quarter cup of half and half.  It still did not make a sauce.  It was a "topping" and not a cream, but it was still a very good dinner that we all enjoyed.  I cooked the bacon in the microwave first and then crumbled it into a saucepan.

This was a huge hit with my family!  I had two larger filets that I reverse seared rather than grilling.  I thinly sliced them prior to serving and put the gravy on top.  I did not use all the bacon fat and added more half and half to the gravy.  I also added fresh mushrooms and garlic.  We will make this again!

Very delicious, though I did follow suggestions and made a few changes.  Plus I doubled the recipe. After sautéing the shallots, I deglazed the pan with some good white wine I had to add some depth of flavor, and a little acidity as another reviewer had mentioned.  Then I used heavy whipping cream instead of half and half with a little cornstarch slurry as well to thicken it at the end.  Was so perfect with our filets for a birthday celebration.  I will definitely make again!

This turned out great. For my sauce (since several people complained of it being bland) I used 6 pieces of bacon , 1&1/2 cups cream, 4 shallots, and I added 3 cloves of garlic and 1/2 cup fresh Parmesan cheese. At the very end I mixed 1/4 c water with 2 Tbsp flour to thicken it. This now became more like an Alfredo fully! And it turned out great. I will definitely be making again. Glad I made the alterations I did.

I am giving this 4 stars.  My husband would probably give it 5.  He loved it.  Going from an electric stove to a gas stove, I am almost having to learn to cook again.  I believe once I master that, this would be a 5 star recipe.

This was a good recipe. I felt the sauce was a little bland and lacking flavor when I tasted it before servicing. I ended up adding 1/4 tsp of bacon fat to the sauce and that seemed to bring the flavors up nicely. Overall an excellent dish! I mean you really cannot go wrong with bacon over a filet.

This recipe was amazing! I cooked the fillet in a cast iron pan, basting with butter, thyme and garlic at the end. The bacon sauce was really good. I used double smoked bacon, and a minced garlic clove added with the onion. I needed to run a paper towel through the pan to get some of the excess bacon grease out, and I seasoned the sauce to my taste at the end, of course. Thank you for the recipe!

Took one of the entries advice below and added half cup of creamer and some sour cream to help thicken, but I added five cloves of garlic as well, who doesn't love garlic?!  We have a quarter side of beef in the freezer, didn't have any filet, used top sirloin instead.  Smoked the meat on my Traeger for about 1.45 hours then finished on high for 10 minutes or so.  Will make again!

Very good! I didn't have any cream so I took some milk and added a little flour to it to make it thick and creamy. No one in that ate this liked onions either so I used onion powder instead. It turned out to taste like gravy and it was very thick. The steaks were also very good. Instead of using Filet Mignon steak, I used a sirloin and it still tasted amazing. I recommend this for anyone that likes a little extra kick to their steak.

omg i made this for my carnivore of a husband on valentines day...it was unbelievably delicious!!  I didn't have access to a grill, so I had to pan fry it, for quite a while because I like it well done.  also didn't have shallots so I used garlic instead, and took another reviewer suggestion about adding some white wine and some mushrooms to the sauce. It was so freaking good!  thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!!!

I prepared the sauce as directed.  It was OK, but didn't taste like something that would compliment the filet mignon.  It tasted a lot like scalloped potatoes.  I had leftover filets, and before tossing the sauce, I decided to add some dijon mustard to it.  It really improved the flavor and made it a much more appealing sauce for the leftover steaks.

I am new to cooking- 2 questions: 1-- should I drain the bacon grease before adding more ingredients? 2 --I needed way more half and half is 2 tablespoons the correct amount for a serving of two?? I kept tweaking with more half and half and then it was great but hate to think of all the grease i was consuming. thanks for clarifying!! Andi

Made this for the first time tonight. I made additions from previous suggestions to increase the liquid. 1 & 1/2 cup of Half & Half. One large Yellow Sweet Onion in place of Shallots. My son brought home from college his local "home made" 1/4" medium cut smoked bacon (ready to eat). Not store bought! Purchased Market cut Boneless Rib Eye @ 1 1/2" thick cut. Omitted Olive oil. We literally tooth picked bacon slices around the steaks for the fun of it! I then chopped the entire onion. Chopped three slices bacon. Placed both at same time and cooked till onions soft. Siphoned off excess bacon fat. All else is followed as written. THIS IS AMAZING! Our new comfort food! We sided with it White Asparagus, grilled. Thank You for sharing the recipe!

I had really high hopes for this recipe based on the other reviews. But something didn't taste right. The sauce is really bland.  After I made this dish, I came back and read more reviews.  I think I might add mushrooms, sour cream, and garlic.  Not bad, but not what I was expecting.

Fantastic recipe!!! My husband and I absolutely loved it! I would agree that it needed more half and half. Also, I added garlic and mushrooms and it was amazing.

AmAzInG!  Made this the first time for a special Valentine's Day dinner - was a little nervous cuz I hadn't "tested" it before.  OMG - So simple and easy, yet SO scrumptious!  I had to consciously work on not groaning (the good kind) after each bite!  Thanks for this recipe!

Made this recipe last night and the family loved it.  I did make some modifications after reading some of the other reviews, I added more Half and Half, finely chopped mushrooms and sour cream to thicken. posted a picture on here of the results.

I used a maple bacon for this recipe (and more than is called for - mmm, bacon) and it turned out absolutely delicious. Will definitely make again!

I halved this recipe because I only had 2 steaks.  The sauce was really thick so I added more cream, but may try white wine next time.  It was really flavorful and a great addition to the meal if you're OK with the calories.

Great beginning--just made it for use with pork tenderloin and my wife raves.--Did use some white wine to deglaze pot after sauteeing onions and added extra light cream to make a larger amount of sauce.  Bacon is a great base for the sauce--plan on trying the following variation--skimming some of the bacon fat off and adding some dijon at the end of the simmer to make a spicier sauce.  Would be great with rice, although we used whipped sweet potatoes and green beans with our pork.  Nice work!
