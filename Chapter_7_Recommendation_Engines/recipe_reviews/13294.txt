I have used an identical recipe to this for some time now, and it really has 5-star potential. A few tips: I always add more tomato paste -- closer to 2 TBSP -- and stir it into the mixture before adding the broth.  Also, the vegetables need extra time to cook at the end. Bring them to a boil and reduce heat to medium or med-high (still bubbling) and cook until veggies are just softened.  Return to rapid boil for cornstarch addition and reduce heat to low or turn off completely. Add parsley and let sit for about 10 mins.-- the stew will reach a wonderful consistency. Serve with warm cornbread or rolls and you are set. Yummy!!!

This was an excellent recipe. I used celery in place of the green beans and added pepper and salt to the flour and added a little garlic salt to this recipe. I did simmer for about an hour and a half then added the carrots, potatoes, and celery and simmered for another hour. Great recipe! Thanks.

Thank you, this is exactly what we were looking for !!   We are in the midst of an ice storm and this was just the thing to warm us up.

Only changes we did were to add some red  wine in addition to the water, cubed the potatoes instead of slicing and used pearl onions instead of regular onions.

This is a definite keeper for us !!

This needs some cumin, brown sugar, and garlic pepper.  I like to use 2 pounds of sirloin and let it cook in the slow cooker all day to let the meat shred.  Add the vegetables about 1 1/2 hours before you are ready to eat.  I prefer to add the mushrooms last and just let them set on top of the stew to 'steam' for about 15 minutes so they don't get over done.

I found this recipe to have lots of eye appeal but was disappointed in the lack of flavor. I added salt/pepper as the recipe does not call for any and still found it to be lacking in "robust flavor". Will try it again but will experiment with seasonings.

This is my favorite recipe for beef stew.  It is SO flavorful, and since it cooks so long, the meat is always very tender. I tweaked the recipe some and added some sweet potatoes cut into chunks as well as the regular potatoes. DELICIOUS!

This is a very good beef stew, similair to the one my Grandma used to make. I skipped the parsley and cornstarch. I took some of the juice from the stew and added flour to thicken. Also added about half a can of tomato paste.

As far as beef stew goes, this was really tasty. I took someone's advice and used pearl onions. They were a bit of a hassle because I had to boil them for one minute before peeling, but they were a delicious addition. I also added one yam and some celery, along with all the other ingredients. I added seasoning and herbs - salt, pepper, thyme, parsley, oregano and bay leaf. Other than that, I did everything as written and it turned out like a traditional stew. My husband actually asked how I got the "gravy" so nice and thick. Served with a baguette! Yum!

I really loved this recipe... I made a few changes, taking out the mushrooms and the cornstarch. I added beef sausage, corn, okra and two cans of stewed tomatoes... I loved it even more with the additions... I also made Jalapeno Chz corn bread, it went well with the stew...

It's a good recipe. I make mine like my grandmother's though.  Cut or buy beef the same, but cut the onion into quarters (they separate and get so sweet and flavorful).  Brown flour covered meat in the oil.  I do not shake off excess flour - it helps make the gravy. I don't use mushrooms. (NO mushrooms in stew! lol)..when brown add 2 cups water & beef broth (ready made cubes or powder like Herb-Ox)and quartered onions and a couple of cloves of garlic (you don't need to mince it integrates into the gravy (.. add celery if you must - I just don't like it).. lower heat to simmer and cook for an hour or so.  Meanwhile cut potato into bite size chunks; cut carrots (or buy baby carrots and use whole) into chunks.  Add to pot after an hour or so and simmer for another hour. Then add peas and corn (cooked according to directions (like Frozen Birds Eye Corn and Birds Eye Peas.  Cook a few minutes until heated through.  If gravy needs to thicken add butter & flour rolled together ( roux) and cook a little longer.  During cooking add pepper & salt to taste.

Delicious beef stew! I added celery into the vegetable mix and omitted the cornstarch step. The meat was tender and flavorful. Served on a bed of white rice, it was a hit with my family.

I made this for Sunday night supper and it was so delicious!  Hubby had seconds!!  Great recipe. The small change I made was de-glazing the pan after browning the meat with beef stock and a bit of merlot. Super yummy!

Loved it! The whole family ate it and that's saying a lot for my household :) I made minor changes by cubing the potatoes, omitting the green beans ( I didn't have any in hand)  mushrooms (husband does not like them) but added the celery. I was out of tomato past,e so I just added some leftover pasta sauce and it was fine. I will try adding a splash of red wine next time and the green beans if I have fresh ones :) this recipe is a keeper and great for a cold January dinner.

I gave it a 4 cause I altered it a bit but my husband LOVED it. Using what I had in the house, I floured the beef w/ flour and Italian seasoning mix. I sautéed that in the oil and put them in the crock pot piece by piece with about 3 cups of beef broth. In the frying pan I simmered/softened about 2 cups of carrots diced, 1 large onion and 5-6 garlic cloves (no such thing as too many). Seasoned that w/ garlic powder, onion powder and black pepper and simmered with broth for about 20 minutes and dumped that in the pot. I added 2 chopped potatoes to the crock pot. I also added corn starch to thicken it. My hubby can't eat tomato stuff so omitted that. We didn't have mushrooms or green beans. OK, maybe I altered it A LOT but it was a good base to start with!

The kids ate it, so that's a win, but I found it a little bland.  I'm thinking it needs some salt and pepper on it before browning maybe and some more spices while cooking. Potatoes and carrots need more than 15 minutes to cook.

Instructions say to add water to cover but it needed so much I used more beef stock as well as the water.  I ended up adding 2.5 cups liquid.  Even using stock instead of water, husband and I found it to be extremely bland.  It also calls for an unneccessary amount of onion.  Needs more garlic, maybe thyme, other.  I’ll keep looking for a beef stew recipe.

Made this recipe a few nights ago and everyone loved it.  Only change was adding a little salt and pepper to meat and 3 bay leaves while stew simmered. This family does not eat green beans added more potatoes and carrots. Thanks for recipe.

Very good stew, but I definitely would cook a little longer. I prefer my potatoes and celery to be a little bit on the mushy side. I will definitely do it again.

Second time I've made it now. Only suggestion I have is to add the carrots and potatoes earlier. They don't seem done enough after 15 minutes.

We enjoyed this beef stew. We only rated 4 star because we would have liked to taste a little more seasoning. My husband added Tabasco to pep it up. Thanks for a great beef stew recipe!

Made this stew because it only has the tomato paste in it and not cans of tomatoes.  Thought it would work for my mom who has to watch her acid intake.  Turned out great! Will definitely make again, another great recipe for my recipe box.

I enjoyed the beef stew very flavorful,  my husband lked it.  I slow cooked for 8 hrs. On low, the meat I used 2 pounds of top sirloin steak which I put in flour, salt & pepper to season then put in pot whole.  Sautéed the onion & mushroom and layed on top of mea then added the rest of the ingredients.   I did change out the green bean to chopped celery.  After the meal was ready it had the gravy look, but I add a beef bouillon for more flavor. I took the meat out which the meat was falling a part, I shredded the meat then put it back in pot.  I would make this again

This stew was very good but it did not make enough gravy for my taste so I added a jar of beef gravy and 1/2 package of beef stew seasoning and it was delicious.  Also the beans were still a bit too hard - 15 minutes was not enough cooking time - I cooked the carrots, potatoes and beans about 25 minutes.

I made this tonight and it was the best stew that I have had (and made) in a long time.  The only changes I made was adding extra garlic and cooking it in my crock pot.  So simple but all the flavors meld beautifully.  Looking forward to leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

I prepared this for supper tonight and it turned out fabulous. My girlfriend thought it was the best beef stew she had ever eaten. I did add a 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper to give it a little kick and substituted cauliflower for the potatoes. Will definitely make this again. Will take photo next time before eating it all.

It was wonderful!  Made some minor changes.  Only used a cup of carrots and added one more potato.  Added a teaspoon of cumin.  Cooked the potatoes and carrots longer and added  canned beans 20 minutes before adding cornstarch.  Can't say enough on how good it was though.  Still needed to cook the vegetables a little longer though.

I cooked my roast all day and then put in the fridge long enough for the fat to harden so I could easily skim it off then shredded the meat and added veggies including a can of diced tomatoes, corn, celery and extra garlic, a bay leaf and some worcestershire sauce along with everything else listed minus the mushrooms. This turned out absolutely amazing and was so easy to make. Oh and I have always loved green beans in my stew...yummy!! Thank you for an excellent base recipe.

This beef stew is awesome! I used a low-sodium beef broth since we have high blood pressure in our family. So whoever needs a lit more can just add at the table. I used potato starch instead of corn starch, worked just as well. I also used flank steak for the meat and it came out very tender, not tough at all. The whole family loved it, even if my children didn't care for mushrooms. They enjoyed it! I skipped the parsley, since I didn't have any on hand, still delicious!

Cooked this yesterday, since I had all the ingredients home.   I used baby potatoes & sweet potato w. Green peas instead of string beans.  (Son actually told me when he was little to add sweet potatoes, so have ever since). Never used garlic or mushrooms before to sauté meat, just onions, but must say it added so much additional flavor.  Ty

A very tasteless beef stew. I suggest adding 1/2 cup of shaved celery root, eliminate the beef broth in it's place add 2 cups of water and a Maggi beef bullion cube maybe 2 (let you taste buds be your guide). Always cook your potatoes separately they will taste much better. Green beans are very out of place in this stew, green peas maybe.

Everyone makes their stew differently. My Grandmother used meaty beef soup bones with the fat still on them. There was something about the fat that just made the stew so good. She also used green beans, corn and russet potatoes, salt and pepper. Guess she learned it from her mother who was from Poland. Thanks for the recipe.
