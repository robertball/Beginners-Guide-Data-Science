Pretty good recipe. Instead of ingredients above, I used black forest ham, provolone and cheddar blend cheeses, and finely chopped onions. I would make these again!  UPDATE  Made these again with chopped red peppers instead of onions. Still loved by everyone!

A very wonderful addition to my get-together! I actually didn't get to eat any of these because they disappeared before I could get one. It shouldn't be too salty, if you're using the regular smoked prosciutto. I bought everything at Trader Joe's (except the crescent rolls, obviously) and they had a wonderful mediterranean spiced feta cheese that worked wonderfully! Also, for preparation, I made these earlier in the day and just stuck them in the fridge. Baked them right before people started coming over. Definately making these again!

proscuitto was too salty for this recipe in my opinion.  I followed the recipe, but did not have desirable taste results.  Was very disappointed....

This was very salty!  I will make this again, but will do one of the variations with pepperoni.
