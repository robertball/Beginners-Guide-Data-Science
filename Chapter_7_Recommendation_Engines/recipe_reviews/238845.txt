OMG tasty!! The Korean Fried Chicken Sauce is made to go with Chef John's Korean Fried Chicken - also listed on this site. This sauce is VERY hot and we love spicy, however, 1 tsp. of red pepper flakes is a nice amount of heat.  If you don't tolerate heat at all I suggest you leave it out altogether, do a taste test and add a tiny amount if you feel it needs a little heat. I made a double batch and only used 1/4 tsp because my daughter doesn't tolerate spicy, and it still had a little bite to it but she said it was tolerable. You can always add more red pepper flakes to individual servings for those who do want more spice so others can enjoy a less spicy sauce.  I use half sweet chili sauce and half Sambal Oelek chili sauce (which is spicier than sweet chili sauce) which can be found at your local Asian market.  Sweet Chili Sauce can be found in most supermarkets in the Asian section.  I also think it had too much lemon juice but he does say adjust to your taste.  I had to add 2 tsp of sugar to offset the tartness, so next time I'll start with 1/2 juiced lemon and taste test.  Like he said it needs to have a nice balance of sweet, sour and spicy.  If you like fried chicken you have to try this recipe!  We served it with some fried rice and stir-fry vegetables. Fabulous recipe!  YOU WILL LOVE THIS SAUCE!!

Another winner from Chef John, thank you.  My only suggestions are as follows:  if you know you like HOT, HOT, then the 1 tsp of red pepper flakes will be ok.  We like hot and spicy and about 1/4 tsp is perfect.  If you are not sure, start with a small amount of red pepper flakes.  Also, if your garlic and green onions are diced very fine you will be happier, I think, with the end result and the melding of flavors.  I have made this so frequently that I donâ€™t measure a thing.  As Chef John says, this recipe is all about your taste so adjust accordingly.  If this tastes like ketchup you did something wrong - it is a perfect sauce for the Korean fried chicken.  I also serve a cooler dressing that I make - a bit like ranch - that goes so well with the spicy red sauce.  OMG this is so good.  Again, thank you for sharing.

Good but not great. My husband wouldn't eat it though, so I guess I won't be making it again any time soon.

In the end, it tasted too much like ketchup. However it is spicy and we ate it, but will not be making it again.

Amazing sauce companion for Chef John's KFC! Had no honey, so substituted maple syrup--yes, I'm Canadian :P--and tweaked the flavor with a teaspoon of kurozu (black rice vinegar) and a teaspoon of mirin. Om nom nom...

Love me some sweet and sour sauce... and this is above and beyond that in flavor. Not as sweet which I love. Balance of flavors are on point. Once again Chef John nails it!

The sauce was So good!
The chicken was really good,  definitely crunchy.  I didn't marinade chicken long enough, but it was still really good!
I've made a number of Chef John's recipes and everything is always delicious!

I made this as written:-). Spicy for my taste, but it was suggested to season to taste:-). I will try again.  I am disappointed that "helpful" critical detail, was made by someone who DID NOT make it.. That really isn't helpful.

A lot of work, but very good. I don't have a fancy fryer like he does. I have a Fry Daddy, but chose to cook on the stove, because I can regulate the temperature better. My first batch wash't great. The batter came off on a couple of pieces and there was a sticking issue, so I added a little more oil That solved the problem. Overall. a great dish. Try it for sure, but I don't think I'll do it again real soon. The sauce was really good. Don;t make this without doing the sauce. Even if you don't use it all in this recipe you can put in another dish.

Hot hot hot! Loved the bite. Served it with the suggested chicken on top of mashed potatoes. I think the starch helped manage the heat a bit. This will be a repeat recipe for us, but itâ€™s not for those who donâ€™t care for spicy. Youâ€™d have to change it up quite a bit to lose the heat.

Really good and easy to make. Good on the Korean Fried Chicken and any thing else you need a REALLY hot sauce for. I made it by the receipt , but by adding less hot pepper flakes you could cool it down. I loved it just the way it was and will make again!!!

This is the first review that I am writing on this site, or any site for that matter. This sauce is simply amazing as is the Korean Fried Chicken that it goes with. I have lived most of my life in Asia and my wife is Asian. She and I just loved the chicken and this sauce. It is my new favorite thing to make!

Absolutely fantastic taste, I made this exactly as the recipe called for and was not disappointed at all. This paired so well with the Korean chicken. I would imagine this would also go great with shrimp as well.

Totally enjoyed this sauce!! It paired beautifully with Chef John's Korean Fried Chicken and the Korean Cucumber Salad recipes which are also on this site!!! I used less ketchup than the recipe called for and added a little more honey. I didn't have any fresh garlic on hand, so substituted  garlic powder and garlic pepper. I also didn't add any water and just let the sauce simmer for about 7 minutes until it thickened nicely, to my taste. Will definitely become a staple sauce in my home. Will try it on grilled pork chops next!
