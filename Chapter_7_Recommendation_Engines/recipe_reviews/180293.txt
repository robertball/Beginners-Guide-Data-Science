I made this several years ago for Thanksgiving dessert then lost the recipe.  It is really easy and very good.  I did not have a springform pan so used a 9" pie pan and it worked just as well.

I did everything exactly as stated. But before making this cheesecake I read all about how to make the best cheesecake on the site. I used a hot water bath to bake my cheesecake and let it sit in the oven when the time was up to slowly cool. Took it to Thanksgiving dinner the next day. It was the creamiest cheesecake ever! Everyone raved about it! And it was beautiful to look at too. Next time I will omit the ground pecans. We didn't think it added to the flavor and the texture of nuts with the creamy filling didn't seem to go together. But that's just us.

Made a few modifications - used ready made graham cracker crust and low fat cream cheese. It was easy to make and turned out fantastic, I will definitely be making this one again.

I have used this recipe for years & it always comes out perfect.  I love pecans but eventually omitted them as the gingersnaps overwhelm them & you can't really taste them.  Either way, this one is a winner!

EASY EASY EASY.. I have made this recipe for 2 seperate Thanksgiving parties this season and everyone has LOVED it.. I will be making it again today for Thanksgiving with my family tomorrow. It is so YUMMY and looks like you bought it from a bakery.
The second time I made it my 4 yr old "helped" me so, it is pretty fail-proof.. I think this is a keeper for sure.

I make the crust without the nuts, due to allergies, but it comes out perfect every time! I now have to make 2 at a time just so there will be enough to go around!!

Killer pie!!!!! couldn't find the ginger crackers so I used a regular pie shell for one... delicious. Crushed some regular ginger snaps and chopped pecans and put on the pie shell before pouring on the mixture in another. The second was great, but not enough better to make all that effort worthwhile.

This was the perfect amount of pumpkin, a little bit of work to make but well worth it - i got gluten free gingersnaps and made the crust gluten free for a great gluten free fall dessert! delicious! look for the autumn cheesecake with apples if you like this one - also delicious and fall feeling!

This cheesecake is pretty darn tasty.  I made it earlier this week to try it before the big T-day.  The only changes I made were to bake the crust for 10 minutes at 350 degrees.  I let it cool, wrapped the pan in two layers of heavy duty foil, poured in the filling and baked the cheesecake in a water bath.  I think the water bath gives you a creamier texture.  At any rate, it was delicious.  I also found it tasted better the next day.  The flavors seemed to intensify.  I will definitely make one for Thanksgiving!

I love this recipe and the cheesecake is very flavorful. My only problem is getting it to srwirl!! The plain batter is much thicker than the batter that has the pumpkin in it, and I end up just moving gobs of cheesecake around with the knife, then they get covered with the pumpkin batter and it doesn't swirl at all. Otherwise, I make this one all the time. :)

Tastes great! I was able to make some of the "swirls" look like ghosts and gave them eyes with melted chocolate dotted on with a toothpick. The look and taste was a hit with all! (I cheated and bought store bought crusts - this pie will fill 2 of them)

Excellent and easy dessert! Our guests raved about this dish! I am not much of a baker, but this recipe is foolproof and perfect for this time of year! I will be making this again over the holidays for sure! Thanks for a great recipe!

Made it for a work party. Everyone really loved it and it went fast. I wasn't as impressed with it. The crust was fantastic, even though I just used generic gingersnaps. I thought the cake was too flat. I think it needed another package of cream cheese. It was easy enough to make but I will probably keep the crust recipe and try another cheesecake recipe.

A creamy, not-to-sweet cheesecake. The crust is very good. I added on the sour cream topping from the Perfectly Simple Pumpkin Cheesecake recipe, and it added the perfect touch!

I made this for a dinner with friends, and EVERYONE was in love after the 1st bite.  I posted a picture of it to Facebook, and from the picture alone I had numerous people requesting the recipe within the same hour. If we bring dessert to a party my husband usually tries NOT to bring it home with us, but he begged to take home this cheesecake.  I decided not to add nuts to the crust just due to personal preference.  To replace the nuts (space wise) I added 2-3 more ginger snaps to the crust mixture.

This is an excellent cheesecake and I got numberous compliments when it was served at a Christmas party. I didn't change anything, though I will next time. Some people commented that it was difficult to swirl. I admit, mine didn't turn out that attractive either. However, since you cannot taste the difference between the white and pumpkin cheesecake, I say why bother? Next time I will mix it as one and serve with a drizzle of caramel topping and a dollop of whipped cream.

Best cheesecake recipe around!  I get requests for this whenever fall rolls around.  Sometimes I use regular graham cracker crumbs instead of the ginger snaps, and it is just as delicious.  This recipe is a keeper!

My family loves this Cheesecake. It is excellent. Some of them had a Pumpkin Cheesecake at Olive Gardens in the States & they said it was good, but, mine was better. They like it with Carmel drizzled on top. Thank-you.    Darlene,  Canada

Once you've tried this, you will NEVER go back to making a regular pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving or any other holiday!  AND, you may not even want to wait for the holidays to make it, it's THAT good.  I would recommend only taking half a cup of the white batter out for the swirl.  I had about a quarter cup leftover and what I used for the swirl ended up spreading all over the top of the pie as it baked.  So, use very little of the white for the swirl if you want it to look like the picture.  I will say even if it does spread, it is only an aesthetic issue and does not negatively effect its yummyness!!!!!

Great Recipe- however I found that the top browned much too quickly in the oven giving it a less than perfect appearance. Next time I would turn the heat down to 300 degrees and bake longer.

Came out tasting great but it did not swirl even after following directions... Maybe I am doing something wrong, but it ended up looking more like a two layered cheesecake which was fine by me since it still tasted wonderful!

Years ago I had a Philadelphia Cheesecake cookbook I used often...I sadly lost it in a move, and hadnt made a cheesecake since...My MIL asked for her old favorite, Pumpkin Cheesecake, and I was so glad to find this recipe...I changed nothing but used a Keebler crust, the big one with two extra servings and it was barely big enough, but it made it. I had never done the swirl before, and it looked and tasted great! My mother in law was thrilled and the other dinner guests loved it too, there was none left for me to take home, lol.

I made this for an bake sale. I could not for the life of me find those ginger crisps anywhere. I went with a graham cracker crust and it is beautiful. Smells great! Very easy recipe, beautiful presentation with the marbeling! I am anxious to make one for our house so we can actually taste one. Thank you for sharing!

This was my first time using my springform pan and to my relief it didn't leak everywhere! The cheesecake was great, kind of like a creamy pumpkin pie with gobs of cheesecake on top. What the hell are Peek Freans ginger crisps? I've never seen those in any grocery store, so I made a graham cracker crust instead. I agree with others that reserving 1 cup of cheesecake batter is probably too much, next time I'll just keep about 2/3 cup. Oh and I didn't use a water bath and there were no cracks at all, I just turned off the oven after 40 minutes and let it sit for an hour.

This recipe was featured on the Yahoo! front page 4 or 5 years ago around Thanksgiving time. I decided to make it that year, and ever since, my family insists that I bring one to Thanksgiving dinner. I usually make the crust with half ginger snaps, half cinnamon graham crackers (and the pecans). I usually adjust the spices are I see fit-- allspice, pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon. The wonderful thing about this recipe is it leaves room for adjusting the spices. I would recommend cooking in a hot water bath. We usually serve it with dollop of whip cream on top... yummy!

This is an awesome recipe. Its really good and it looks great. I didn't use the Peek Freans cookeis, i jusrt used some gingerbread cookies i found, and the creamcheese packages don't come in 250g anymore, so you have to estimate but it still turned out great

Sooo good!!!  My husband and I got a slice of swirled pumpkin cheesecake form the grocery store and surprisingly he loved it...he can be picky.  He asked me to make one so I picked this one, which he liked better :-)  I used about 20 or so Nabisco gingersnaps since the ones they called for were nowhere to be found, and I eliminated the pecans.  It was so creamy and had just enough pumpkin flavor.  Definitely a new fall favorite!

This is one of those recipes that looks so impressive, but it is so easy to make! The marble effect looks stunning!
It tastes very yummy too, even though I still prefer having the original (without pumpkin). But this is a matter of taste, and I can see why this recipe is so popular!

I made this cheesecake for my dad's 60th birthday. I used a basic graham cracker crust instead of the pecan crust mentioned int he recipe. It was so good and so beautiful! I received quite a few compliments on this one. Thanks for the great recipe!

Perfect pumpkin cheesecake recipe!  I realized the cream cheese bricks I'd bought are smaller than 250 g, so I made up the difference with more pumpkin.  Also baked my own ginger cookies and used them for the crust.

I baked this today for Thanksgiving tomorrow, so I can't comment yet on the taste & texture.  I wanted to pass along a couple of suggestions, though.  First, I agree with the reviewer who said that 1/2 cup of the vanilla filling is plenty to create the marble effect. 1 full cup would be way too much.  I held out 1/2C and used a small spoon to drop vanilla rounds on the top of the pumpkin filling.  If you wait a minute or two, the vanilla circles will sink (because the vanilla filling is denser & heavier) just enough to be even with the top of the pumpkin filling.  At that point, run your knife around to make the marble design.  

Also, I followed the baking instructions in the cheesecake video in the website; that is, baked it in a water bath for 45 minutes, then turned the oven off and left it in for another hour.  I used a turkey roasting bag in addition to the foil to keep the water out.  (Actually, the foil is probably unnecessary if you do this.)  I've had cheesecakes ruined in the past by water getting into the foil, so this worked great and was super easy.  The finished cake is still cooling, but looks exactly like the photo in the recipe.  Happy baking!!

The best holiday dessert. We've served if for several years now. I've used the ginger crust, graham cracker and regular pie crust and all work great. And any extra batter makes great mini cheesecakes baked in cupcake wrappers.

I made this cheesecake last year as a Thanksgiving surprise for my granddaughter. She loved it and everyone else did too.  I used a kabob stick to make the swirls and they turned out just like the picture.  The cake is easy and delicious.

I was asked to bring the pumpkin pie for dessert one Thanksgiving. I am so tired of plain old pumpkin pie every year so, I decided to find and make a pumpkin recipe that would wow everyone and replace pumpkin pie at least ONE Thanksgiving. 
I took both, a pie and a Philadelphia Pumpkin Swirl Cheesecake. 
Let me put it to you this way. I brought home an empty cheesecake platter and a pumpkin pie that didn't get touched and I've been asked to make the Philly Pumpkin Swirl Cheesecake every year since and to skip the pie! I now have to make two!! 
I like this for 2 reasons. I love to make cheesecakes. And the other, I hate making pie crust!
This year, I was asked to bring it to the Christmas Celebration as well and that's what brought me here again to get the recipe!
If anyone has an egg nog cheesecake recipe they know to be as good as this one, I'd love to have it! Make one of each for Christmas and see how that goes over!
*First time I made this, I didn't have ginger snaps or pecans, so I made a regular graham cracker crust and added some cinnamon to it. Last year, I made it with the ginger snaps and pecans. We like it both ways, but, if you do the ginger snaps and pecans...when they say FINELY CHOPPED, it means FINELY CHOPPED. If the nuts are left too big they are too course for the recipe and take away from the recipe. IMO.

Very tasty and easy; I would give it 5 stars except that it was a little dry. I baked it to the lowest recommended time but if I make it again will cut about 5 minutes off to see if it might be a little creamier.

This was awesome! I personally love the smell and taste of pumpkinpie, but if often reminds me of baby food in texture. This was creamy, smooth and light in flavor, especially after a very full meal. Will def make again!

This cheesecake was absolutely delicious but both times I made it, it cracked !  The second time I made it I used a hot water bath which I have used for other cheesecakes, but I still had the same problem. The cracks were along the swirl between the two batters.....any suggestions ?  It didn't really matter because the cheesecake tasted so good but I would love to figure out what I did wrong !!

I am so NOT a baker, this recipe seemed pretty much fool proof and it is! I used a pre-made graham cracker crust. The water bath as well as letting it cool in the oven for at least an hour are a must! I then covered it with a plate and let it sit out for another hour before refrigerating. All the previous tips worked together to create one awesome and EASY desert! Looking forward to bringing this one along for Thanksgiving!

Very easy recipe.  Couldn't find peak freams so used a thin gingersnap cookie.  Mixed the cookies, nuts, butter in the food processor, and the crust was perfect.  Everyone loved it.

I've made this a couple times and I think it is awesome!  Definitely a good combination.  Would recommend cutting down the serving size because I probably could've came close to making two of these.  I also took the easy way out and just bought a graham cracker crust.

I made mine into bars in a 9x13 pan and doubled the crust, which was perfect.  I baked it for an additional 10 minutes.  The family loved it!

I LOVE pumpkin cheesecake, and this recipe is so easy and delicious! I used a pre-made gluten-free graham cracker crust, and everything still tasted great. The swirls are easy to make and they look so pretty, my friends were really impressed!

Made a basic graham cracker crust due to nut allergies in the house. Made it as written otherwise but placed a pan of water in the rack under the cheesecake and is now a family favorite !!!!!

So delicious and so easy! This is a very mild dessert - making it very easy for everyone to enjoy. None of the flavors overpower any of the others. Even my father, who doesn't like pumpkin nor cheesecake, really loved this dish! Will definitely be making this again.

As i was unable to make the gingersnap crust , I can only give it 4 stars. This was so easy. It was my first cheesecake ever, and i made it for my friend's (who runs her own catering business) birthday. She loved it. Everyone who ate it loved it, and many couldn't believe it didn't come from a bakery. The fact that you don't have to put it in a "bath" as you do with many cheesecakes is wonderful. I highly recommend this recipe.

Really good cheesecake.  I used Hubbard squash from our garden, rather than pumpkin.  I didn't have ginger crisps, so I used plain cookies with added powdered ginger for flavor for the crust.  Other than that, followed the recipe exactly; froze it for about 1 month.  Thawed & covered the surface with a mixture of 1c. sour cream, 2 tbsp sugar & 1 tsp vanilla.  Then topped that with sugared fresh cranberries, pomegranate seeds and raspberries - made a beautiful (and tasty) presentation for Christmas dessert.  Rather loses the effect of the marbling but the flavour was excellent.
This made a big cheesecake.  May make two smaller ones next time & keep in the freezer for unexpected company.

This was the first cheesecake I had made. It was so easy to follow and it was made for my brother's girlfriend for her birthday. I was told it was a hit with her. Now he wants me to teach him how to make it for his  work's Christmas party.

This was a huge hit at my family's pre-thanksgiving feast today. I followed the recipe to the T! I would recommend making the crust that was provided because it really made the cheesecake more original and professional looking at the same time. Marble top was PERFECT!

I would have given it 5 stars, but my cheesecake had a crack all the way down the top (so disappointing). Although it didn't change the taste-it was upsetting to me since it wasn't "perfect". Thank goodness it was just my family.

I will make this again and again (for my in laws on Thanksgiving) but will follow a traditional cheesecake method of baking and put the spring form pan in a water bath. I am thinking that will prevent my cake from splitting again.

I made this cheesecake with a gram cracker crust (not a fan of ginger crisps) and my family loved it! We are big cheesecake and pumpkin pie fans and wanted to combine our loves, this recipe was it! I will defiantly make it again.
