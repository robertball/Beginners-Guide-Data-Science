The filling recipe for the shells is excellent if you leave out the sugar and sub sour cream for the mayo. I put two teaspoons of filling into a mini puff pastry shells found in the frozen food case at the supermarket. Bake 10-12 mins at 375 degrees. These were the first to go with everyone wanting more, more, more!

Skip the shells and serve this as a dip!

I made this for Thanksgiving and put half of the mixture in jumbo pasta shells as suggested, and served the rest of the mixture as a dip, accompanied by salty crackers (I used Saltines.)  

When people arrived, they didn't really know what to make of the shells (Are they an appetizer or are they something for dinner?, Do we eat them with our fingers or with a plate & fork?), so they went for the easy choice - the dip.  The dip went so fast, that I took the shells aside, scooped the mixture out and added it to my dip bowl.

I knew it was good when my father, who despises the idea of imitation crab meat, kept going back for more, even after he was told what was in it.

It's rather thick, but the flavor is fresh and the green celery and pink crab & shrimp, make it pretty and appetizing.

I'm savoring the glory of bringing a "winning" dish and will make this for future potlucks!  Thanks!

These were easy. Nobody seemed to care for them. I tought the cream cheese overpowered the seafood.

Everyone loved this great treat!!!  I used sour cream instead of mayo as my Mom can't eat mayo.  I also added some celery salt and lime juice.  I will make this one again!!!

I used real crab meat for this recipe and it makes a very elegant appetizer....they do get a little messy around the edges after filling a few so I keep a little dried parsley handy to sprinkle over each one to cover my dribbles! Thank you for this recipe!

I made these for an office party and am still (2 months later) receiving compliments on them. I used plain cream cheese instead of Neufchatel cheese, didn't include shrimp, and added several tablespoons of parsley for colour. Next time I will make as a dip and serve with crackers; the pasta shells were a lot of trouble, didn't present well, and added nothing taste-wise. Overall, a very rich but delicious recipe!

i made these for a dinner party over a year ago and they were a HUGE hit.  not only that, my boyfriend STILL OBSESSES about these things, asking for them ALL the time. It's really good, if you don't mind the nagging to make them again and again. ;)

I spent a lot of time trying make this work with the shells. The bad news is that no one cared for the presentation. The good news is that the crab mix alone is terrific hot or cold on crackers.

Pretty tasty, but I would probably use less onion next time. But all in all, very good.

I did as the last suggested by leaving out sugar, using sour cream instead of mayo,  and baking in mini pastry shells. Omigosh! Soooo good! Absolutely delicous!!

This recipe was quite average in my opinion.  The stuffed shells actually tasted better once heated in the oven, and the filling tasted better on crackers. I don't think I will make this again.

Made these for a baby shower.  They were a big hit.  I substituted green onions for the onion & added some ground red pepper for a little zing.  I think I'd like the filling in a tomato for a luncheon!

I'm not a huge seafood fan but when I tried this recipe, I just fell in love with seafood!  Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe.  I'll be sure to make it again!  By the way, I used less onion since it seemed like too much to use a whole one.

The filling was wonderful. I put it in giant pasta shells made by Ronzoni, they were very eazy to fill. They are about the size of your palm when cupped. And if after boiling and cooling the shells you put them in you hand and squeese the shell open it opens like a change purse would to form a circle shape. I dropped the crab mix in and it was that simple. I loved this recipe and will keep it! You can also try baking the shells in the oven 350 for 30 min. after boiling and filling for a better flavor.

I made these for a New Year's Eve party and less than half of them were eaten.  Everyone who tried the shells seemed to like them but thought they were rich.  If I make this again I will cut the sugar down to 1 tbsp. and try heating them or using the filling for a dip as a previous reviewer suggested.

I made this as a dip with crackers.  It was good but next time I will use less onions, it was very oniony tasting.  I used canned crabmeat and really couldn't taste the crabmeat.  I wish it was as good for me as everyone says it is.

Like many others I used this as a dip instead of with the shells.  But I substituted low-fat plain yogurt for the mayo (which btw works as a great substitute for the sour cream substitute many others were using), used chives instead of onions, and used real crab meat instead of imitation crab.  And I served it with Toasted party crackers.  After reading all of the simply *glowing* reviews I decided to make this for my company's recent semi-annual meeting/potluck.  As one of the senior management got up to give his presentation, before about 150-200 people, he first asked who brought the crab dip.  I raised my hand and he said, "You are my new favorite person.  That dip is the lunch of champions."  And then he told everyone else to try it too.  Before this I had worried that that the recipe had made too much and I'd have a lot left over.  SOO, not the case.  The bowl was practically scrapped clean.  And like another reviewer mentioned, I too am still basking in the glow of bringing a "winning" dish.  I will definitely make this one again and recommend it to others.

I made the recipe pretty much as written except for I stuffed the filling into hollowed out tomatoes rather than the pasta shells.  I highly recommend trying that...not only did it LOOK really pretty, but the flavors went really well together, too!  After mixing all the ingredients together, I put the filling directly into the tomatoes (rather than chilling it) and baked them for a few minutes at about 350 degrees.  I made these as a main dish, but I'm thinking next time I'll keep them as an appetizer...they were much richer than I expected!  Still very yummy, though!

I made this for our Valentines party. I substituted the mayo for sour cream like a previous person said, I also piped the mixture into large hot house tomatoes as suggested from another. The mixture and flavor of the tomato blended perfectly. I ended up giving this recipe to over 15 people. I will always include this recipe when having dinner parties. Thanks!!

Easy recipe that tastes wonderful. If you like krab salad, this one is for you. 

I added a bit of shredded cheddar and parmesean cheese for a slighty different flavor. Turned out great!

I would make this again for sure!

Tomorrow I am having a b-day party for hubby.  Needed finger food.  Found this recipe.  Tweaked it a little.  Sour cream instead of mayo as a guest won't eat anything with mayo in it.  Three large green onions instead of the onion, personal preference.  Going to use mini phyllo shells instead of pasta shells.  Made the filling this morning and just now sampled it in the phyllo shell.  It was like having a little bit of heaven in my mouth!!!  I can hardly wait for my guest to try it tomorrow.  It's going to be a big hit!!

This recipe is ALWAYS a hit when I make it.  I have made a few changes that really kick it up.  I leave the sugar out and instead add enough cajun seasoning to give it little added flavor without overpowering it.  You can also use the filling as a dip with crackers or celery and you can use it to fill cherry tomatoes instead.

This was REALLY good. I didn't stuff them in shells like it called for but I made it as a dip/appetizer with crackers. My guests loved it!

I made a few changes and received rave reviews from the people my husband works with in Rockford, IL.  I used 2 cans of crab meat (located by the tuna in your local grocery) and 1 can of lump crab meat.  I used cream cheese instead of the other...  i didnt stuff the shells--it was served with crackers as a cold dip.  Awesome.. none left

Made this for New Year's Eve, was a huge hit with everyone. It made it easier to use already cooked shrimp, and I also added shredded carrots suggested by another reader. Very much a keeper, thanks!

Made it as an appetizor for family dinner. Everyone agreed it was great. 
Used Ricotta cheese instead of cream cheese.  It was less rich, and made it very fluffy tasting.

So easy to make.

A keeper.

I have visited this recipe time and time again as it never gets old. I have even made it as a dip (leaving out the pasta shells) and served it with a variety of water table crackers and triscuits. Still a hit.

I took other's advice and used puff pastry shells instead of pasta shells. Didn't add celery because nobody likes it at home.

I made up 2 batches for an afternoon appetizer and cocktail party.  Rave reviews from my guests.  Note that they firm up in the frig.  Also be sure to use a teaspoon when filling them.  I tried to use a baggie with the tip cut off and it was an absolute mess.

Quick and easy to make, this recipe is very good.  Next time I will use less sugar, I think the imitation crab has a sweet flavor already.  I served this at a party and people were hesitant to try them -- do you pick up with your fingers (the shells are large), use a knife and fork, or what??  I'm not sure the shells do much for the recipe. I actually enjoyed it much better as a spread on crackers!!!

Just not good. Follow recipe except I used onion powder instead of an onion and I left out the shrimp because I didn't have any. Just did not taste good at all.

I love these things, but I started making them (20 years ago) with tuna, just the way I made tuna/macaroni salad, but inside the shells! A scrap of lettuce or parsley makes them look nice for the short time they're on the plate.

I made the filling this weekend and as others suggested, used it in puff pastry shells.  It was ok, not enough seasoning for me.  I may try the filling again, but will use the food processor to make the shrimp and  finer and then use as a filling in wonton wrappers and then bake.  The recipe is a good base, just needs some tweaking for my household tastebuds.

I made this for a graduation party and several people asked me for the recipe.  I skipped the shells like several others suggested and just served it as a dip with crackers. The only other change I made was to substitute Old Bay for the salt. I will definately use this recipe again. Thanks for sharing.

My sister and I prepared this dish for a party and many guests told us how delicious it was! I would add more celery next time, just for a little extra crunch. Also, I recommend allowing the cream cheese to soften before starting the recipe (although the directions do not tell you to do so) and chopping the crab before adding it to the mixture. Yum!

I made this for Christmas Eve and served as a dip. I thought it was a little bland so I added a couple dashes of Old Bay and the taste was much better. I also used 3 cans of crab meat instead of 2.

I would say these are slightly amazing crab shells. Not many people took the ones that were in shells. I had more luck with the dip and cracker plate.

WOW, Are these great!  Made them for a 4th BBQ and they were a big hit.  Easy to make and very easy to transport and serve.  I too used half of the sugar called for as the imitation crab has a sweet taste already.  I also used fresh shrimp that I diced instead of canned.  Adding shredded carrots added immensly to the texture and the color presentation of this app.  Next time will add a little more lemon juice.  This one is a keeper for sure.  Thanks for sharing it with us Barbara!

This is a very yummy recipe. I added two shredded carrots for color and fresh chives instead of onions. Also, I used a 1/4 pound of fresh shrimp instead of canned. I think next time I will use a little less cream cheese. This recipe is a keeper and I will make it again.

I made these for an office holiday "pig-out".  I overheard the big boss commenting about how good these "crab things" were.  He was talking softly to his wife and he didn't know who made them so I figure that was honest and high praise indeed!

These were delicious.  I added a bit more lemon juice, a dash of cayenne, replaced mayonaise with sour cream as recommended in another review, and put the crab mixture in ready-made baked filo cups. Served them at a fundraiser and they were a huge hit!

I used 2 cans of real crab instead of 1 lb imitation crab meat, 1/2 lb. medium cooked shrimp, and sour cream instead of mayonnaise.  It turned out great and everyone at the party liked it, but I think it was a little bland.  I will definitely make it again, but I would add more seasoning to it next time.

Forget the pasta shells. But as a dip it's pretty good. It's a little too rich for my taste, so much neufchatel! Needs work.

My husband, and I really liked these shells. I was a little skeptical because of the shells, but they turned out really good! I agree with others that this would be good as a spread with crackers too. Thanx for sharing!

Made these for a large party and they went largely untouched.  Have to agree with others who said the shells add nothing, they really don't.  The mixture itself is decent, would be worthy served as a dip.  But the taste I really came away with was onion and cream cheese.  The seafood almost disappears completely.

I just made these, went to give my husband a sample bite and he took the whole thing. Since we are trying to watch the fat intake, I used Fat Free Cream Cheese and reduced fat Mayo. Will definatly be making these again.

Seriously good finger food.  I don't care for imitation crab, so I substituted canned instead.  Made 1/2 the recipe since the group was small and we all wanted to save room for dinner!  What a hit this Christmas...I've already shared the recipe with a dozen folks.  If you don't like seafood, any kind of canned meat would work!

This recipe works well as a spread too.  Only problem is it makes alot!!  If your party is 10-20 cut the recipe in half unless it's your main attraction you will end up with alot left over.  My guests took small plates home with them and I still had 3-4 cups leftover.  It was used on crackers and cocktail breads but goes a long way! Garnish with sliced lemons it was a hit.

I used this recipe for a christmas party last year, and it was a hit. 
I plan to make it a regular part of my menus for future parties.

I made this for a party and my guests loved it!!  It's delicious, but definitely rich!  To cut down on the calories, I tried it with non-fat cream cheese and substitued the 1/3 cup of maynaisse with 1/4 cup of non-fat ranch dressing.   It still tasted fabulous and for calorie-counters like me, I can enjoy them guilt free!!

These were delicious and got rave reveiws from the other "eaters".  Next time, I will try the
shredded carrots since they aren't much for visual appeal as is.  Also, they tended to be
on the salty side, so I may cut that down as well.  Otherwise, tasty and fun to eat!

Too heavy, too little flavor.  No one liked them.  Would require major tweaking to make it edible.

This is a great dish for potluck.  Very tasty, and presentable!  At least, 5 people came up to me to ask for this recipe.  Just rememeber to leave it in the frig for the suggested time, or over night.  It tastes better when it's cold.

I read the reviews decided to go with the positive reviews and make this recipe. I spent a lot of money on real crab, added shrimp and put them in little pastry bites. The cream cheese over powered the crab and it was bland bland bland...people ate it, they didn't hate it, but we could not taste the crab. I might as well used only shimp at 3 dollars a pound vs crab at 9 dollars a pound. I won't be making this again.

I didn't bother stuffing into shells. Instead, I just heated it up and served as a dip with crackers. It got fantastic reviews from my quests.

I make these alot.  But altered the recipe quite a bit.  I use fresh chives instead of onions, carrotts for color and taste, white pepper instead of black and add some of the lemon zest plus onion power.  They are super delish.

I made these for a Christmas Party and I got great comments on them.  I used med. sized tomatoes as a couple of other reviewers said because I thought the shells would not add any flavor at all.  I halved the recipe as it was a small get together.  I did not use the shrimp and used immitation lobster instead of crab.  Will definitely make again.

ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!!  I chose not to use the shells and just make it a dip...it was a major hit at our New Years party.  Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe!

I read all the rave reviews & couldn't wait to make it.  I followed the recipe & made a few changes suggested in the reviews.  I made it the night before & tasted it in the orning.  It was Blah!  I started adding more seasonings  more Old Bay,salt, pepper, etc.  Still blah!  It was 
Hardly anyone ate it.  Needless to say I won't be making it again. 
What frustrates me is all the raves it got & I made it for our annual Christmas party & it was very disappointing.  When this happens I always wondered what I could  have done wrong.

they were definitely popular with the crowd that I made them for! It's a great potluck dish, or barbecue side dish.
