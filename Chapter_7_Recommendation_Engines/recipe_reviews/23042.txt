Since I am the bread machine at my house, I adapted this recipe to the old-fashioned method. Using Tunisianswife's suggestions (see her Mediterranean Black Olive Bread review), I proofed the yeast in 1 cup of warm water mixed with the 1 tsp of sugar; added the flour (I used A.P.) and mixed in the remaining ingredients. I kneaded the mixture on a floured surface and probably added another 1/2 to 3/4 cup flour by the time all was kneaded in. Like Tunisianswife, I did 3 risings on this bread, kneading in between, and using her steam-baking idea, baked in a 450 oven (with a pan of water at the bottom to provide steam) for the first 15 minutes, then reduced to 400 & baked another 10-15 minutes. I agree with reviewer Tanaquil as to the texture and gourmet quality of this bread. I have baked breads for many, many years but this is one of the finest I've ever baked. I used 1 T fresh rosemary. The rosemary is a fragrant and subtle addition to the flavor. I was concerned about the amount of garlic, but it was perfect--it baked into mellow goodness. The texture was a soft but chewy interior and crusty exterior that sliced beautifully. My family has requested I make another loaf this week and let it be the meal!

This is a keeper. Makes great lunch sandwiches.
(I had to add 1/2 cup of flour and used the medium setting to make it crusty.)

Tihs bread is a hit with my family.  It had a wonderful aroma while baking, and turned out perfect.  All golden and crusty on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.  However, this bread took 4 hours  on the french bread setting in my machine instead of 2, so make sure to plan far enough ahead if using it for a meal!

I made this with machine on french bread setting, light crust, and subbed garlic powder(1tsp) and this came out exceptionally well.  Chewy crust and super soft, but firm inside.  Holds form well for cutting, an overall great recipe with a light herbal taste.  Well done!

Mmmmm...good!  I happened to have fresh rosemary on hand and used that instead of dried.  This bread has the most wonderful aroma and mild flavor.  I used the left-over bread to make "Garlic Croutons" (found here at AllRecipes.com).

I was really disappointed in this bread!  I tried it twice and both times it rose in the first 'rise' and then fell and came out flat and raw.  It was a total flop.

Pretty bummed with this - the flavor wasn't bad, but the bread was flat, doughy, and just not...good, I guess.

This was my second time making this recipe. The first time was delicious, but very small. The last time I made it it barely rose at all and was way too dense and rock hard on the outside. My mother-in-law suggested that the fresh garlic might affect the rising...I'm bummed because it's such tasty bread and stumped because of all of the great reviews. Any suggestions?

I was inspired to make this due to the beautiful photo submission of Grannyloohoo's.  This is the most amazing bread.  i don't have a bread machine so just bloomed yeast in the water with a glob of honey.  doubled the recipe and made 2 nice loaves.  Replaced butter with EVOO, and used 4 tbsp wheat gluten.  I had to add about 1 1/2 cup more bread flour doing it by hand.  This bread has the most incredible flavor and very well-balanced; not overpowering at all.  crushed 4 cloves of garlic for double recipe.  this is one of the most tender breads; so soft on the inside.  sprayed the oven in intervals for the first 8 min or so to get that nice crust.  Presents so well.  If using a conventional oven, I baked at 400 for 25 min.(2 loaves) and it produced a golden brown crust and soft tender crumb.  This one sure is a keeper!  thanks so much for this recipe.  Would go great with Italian or with a good lamb stew!

This recipe, in my opinion, is another one that really deserves much more than five stars. Wow!  This is a new favorite!  I did pre-measure the 17 tablespoons of water and found that to be roughly 1 and 1/3 cups water.  When the kneading cycle first started up, I found that I had to add about 1/2 cup to 3/4 of a cup of an additional amount of flour.  (I did this slowly, about 1 tablespoon at a time.)  Aside from that, I made this exactly as written and it came out tender and soft with an amazing crumb texture.  For anyone having trouble with the dough not rising, as per some other reviewers suggested, it might be a good idea to proof the yeast first.  Also, make sure that the water you add is neither too hot, nor too cold, as both will affect whether or not the dough rises.  If it's too cold, the yeast will not be activated, and if it's too hot, the yeast will be killed.  A good temperature for bread recipes that call for warm water is somewhere between 110 and 115 degrees.  A thermometer comes in real handy for this reason.  One last suggestion is to make sure that any salt the recipe calls for does not come into direct contact with the yeast.  Always add salt to the liquid ingredients first, and always add the yeast last.  Once all of the ingredients are in my machine, I make a small well with a spoon on top of the dry ingredients and pour the yeast into that well.  I hope these suggestions are helpful.

I needed to add a lot more flour during the kneading cycle, but the end result was delicious!

I've made this twice now in 2 days! It is excellent. I didn't have to add anything extra to the recipe, and just followed the instructions for my bread maker. I served it for happy hour with cold sliced chicken, cheeses, olives, and other assorted munchies. Everyone went wild! This is definitely a keeper!

Excellent Bread! I am new to baking yeast breads and I don't have a bread machine, so I kneaded the ingredients together, allowed to rise for an hour, uncovered and let sit for about 10 minutes and then baked using other reviewers tips to bake with a tray of water on the bottom oven rack to create steam and then baked at 450 for the first 15 minutes and then 400 for another 15 minutes. It came out beautifully. The flavor and presentation of this bread is excellent.

Wow! A flavorful bread! High quality! I modified it by removing it before the 'bake' stage so I could have 2 French-style loaves. 20-25 mins at 375.

This happens to be my husband's favourite bread recipe out of the great many I've made and he's been very insistant on my making again and again. I've made it three times so far and was more than impressed the first and this third time. The second time I made it, it didn't turn out as well, as the top of it caved in. I've read some others' reviews and how one person commented that theirs came out too flat and so I feel that I should add that perhaps it was the fault of the maker (myself included the second time) and not the recipe. Bread machines are tricky and if an ingredient isn't measured exact or the temperature not precisely right, things can go wrong. Personally, this is one of my favourite breads to make so far and the aroma alone makes it worthwhile.  Perfectly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside with just the right amount of rosemary and garlic! My husband would surely agree.

This was my first attempt at homemade bread.  My husband loves homemade bread and is extremely critical of it.  I just took the loaf out of the bread machine about 15 minutes ago.  Half of the loaf is already gone.  He said he would change absolutely nothing about it!!  Great recipe...I will be making it often!!

this came out so good! i used "rapid rise" yeast (for bread machines) and it rose beautifully. i used fresh rosemary and kosher salt. the next time i will try with table salt as the kosher was not quite pungent enough. the french bread setting on my machine took 3 hours and 50 minutes so i'll need to plan ahead next time. thank you for sharing your recipe!!!

I didn't make this in my bread machine, but did it the "old-fashioned" way instead and baked it in the oven.  I did not need any extra flour, in fact I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out perfectly!  I baked in the oven at 450 degrees for 20 minutes, then turned the heat down to 400 and cooked an additional 17 minutes. It came out a beautiful golden brown color, nice and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I was worried it wouldn't turn out after reading some reviews, and after I discovered my yeast had expired in October, but I needn't had worried!  I'm afraid I might eat the entire loaf before dinner!

This is my go to recipe whenever I make bread.  I often use whole wheat flour instead of white since we prefer the taste.  I mix it in the bread machine but bake it in my oven.  I like to place a small pan of water on the lower shelf of the oven (about a cup of water).  That gives the loaf more of a french bread crusteyness.  I would recommend it to anyone.  Yummy!

For all of you who say that the water/flour ratio is off. It is. When you use 1 cup+1 tbs (17 Tbs) there is too much water. My husband made this and actually measured out 17 Tbs and since there is always loss on the way to the machine it turned out perfect. Actual water should be just over 3/4 cup I think. If you can get this to work, it is absolutely delicious and smells SO good while baking. I would give it 5 stars if the measurements were better. It takes 3.5 hours in our machine, so know how long it takes in your if using for dinner or something.

This bread is perfetto! I used fresh rosemary, since I had some. I followed Grannyloohoo's suggestions and it turned out wonderful! Goes very well with (2-1) olive oil & balsamic w/ ground pepper. Also delicious with butter.

Followed the directions exactly and it was great. The loaf was a bit smaller than I anticipated, but going by how much it rose during one of the rise cycles, I don't think I'd try to make a bigger loaf in my bread machine. My bread machine has a 4 hour french bread cycle. That is an hour longer than the regular bread cycle. Make sure you check the time required on your machine if timing is a factor. This is a keeper!! Thanks for the recipe.

After seeing GRANNYLOOHOO'S picture I just had to make this. I would have  liked to make it by hand but as it was a work day, I put it in the breadmaker on timer on the dough cycle. I then shaped the loaf and baked in the oven. I used fresh rosemary instead of the dried. This loaf disappeared in one sitting as we all used it to mop up the remainders of sauce rosee also from this site . Thanks.

The flavor and intent of this bread is wonderful, but the proportions are just not right, I had to add nearly a cup of flour to get the dough looking like a proper ball, and it still fell and came out very doughy.  Falling is Ok since I like moist breads and it happens, but the doughy raw texture was just terrible.

I added at least 1/2 c more flour, as the dough was "soupy".  It's still rising and smells good!

I don't have a bread machine, and I really like to knead it, so I made it the old fashioned way.  I doubled the recipe, and instead of adding butter, I added 1/4 cup (for 2 loaves) of olive oil.  I was worried when I took it out of the oven because it seemed so hard on the outside, but once it was cut, the inside was nice and moist!  Next time I would add more rosemary and garlic, since I used fresh instead of dried.  I used 2 cloves of fresh garlic chopped fine, but it could have used a little more.  This bread will be great with olive oil and balsamic vinegar!  I will make it again with some modification like 16 tablespoons equals 1 cup, so 1 cup plus 1 tbsp. per loaf of water is what you want.

Modifications + Oven = Rosemary Diamante WIN    This is the best bread to come out of our breadmaker yet.     We first made the dough in the breadmaker but baked it in the oven, with some modifications (some on purpose and some on accident).    Modifications:   1) Flipping back and forth between 2 recipes, I accidentally added 2 T of butter rather than the 1 t butter called for in the recipe.  2) After rising, we brushed the bread with 1 egg yolk + 1 T warm water then sliced an X into the surface just before putting in the oven.  3) We used the breadmaker for the dough only and baked it in the oven.    To bake in an oven, we:  Followed directions on Dough cycle with 2T butter instead (delicious mistake in crossing recipes. Will repeat this mistake).  Greased and buttered baking stone and plopped dough onto baking stone in round shape (was quite sticky).  (Preheat oven to 450) Let dough raise for 45 minutes.  Just before you put it in the oven, 1) brush with egg/warm water mixture; 2) make (quick, decisive) slices across the surface (for aesthetic purposes only); 3) grind sea salt all over the top of it (to make it a Rosemary Diamante).    Baking:  Followed suggestions from @GRANNYLOOHOO's comments and baked at 450 for 15 minutes with a pan of water in lower shelf, then turned down oven to 400 for remaining 15 minutes.    Most. Delicious. Bread. Ever.

I made this bread I think the flour ratio is way off. I live at high altitude so it is drier here anyway and I still had to add a lot of extra flour. Bummed it didn't turn out at all.

This bread is awesome in taste - by far the one of tastiest ones I have tried on allrecipes so far!  But, my loaf fell both times I made it.  The first time I cut it into small pieces before serving so no one could tell, and it was devoured in no time.  But the second time, it fell, and came out rock-hard.  I ate 2 pieces, then threw the rest out.  I like the taste, but think I have given up on this one.  I just can't rely on a bread that falls time and time again, or comes out a brick.  I'm disappointed.

Loved it! Used the bread machine to blend and kneed the dough, then baked it in the oven! I used the steam trick! Worked beautifully. Only problem I had is I forgot the salt! Won't forget next time!. Next time I will try gluten free ingredients. A family member allergic to gluten:(

Perfection!  So easy to alter for a basic french bread too.  I did add about a tablespoon of dried milk powder for a flakier crust.  Turned out perfect in my bread machine!  I was using the bread for my Christmas French Toast Casserole and it was the best it ever tasted thanks to this bread!

Very nice bread.  It ends up with almost a sourdough taste, perhaps from the garlic maybe, that I'm not used to, but it's really good!  It does lack a bit of flour--about a half cup, and I generally don't bake breads in my bread machine, so I usually do the dough cycle, take it out then let it rise and bake in the oven.  I did that with this bread; let it rise for a 1/2 hour, then baked for about 30 minutes at 375.  Thanks for the recipe!

This bread was wonderful!  I used fresh rosemary, and also added fresh basil.  I only used 1 tsp. of minced garlic and it was plenty for us.  The borrowed bread maker I used malfunctioned during the first "rise" cycle, so I had to take it out punch it down and then let it rise again in a warm oven.  Baked it at 450 for 25 minutes.  I was VERY surprised at how firm, yet soft the texture was...enjoyed eating it!  I am going to try it in my new bread machine and expect it will be even better when it goes through the whole process the right way.  YUM!

UPDATE:  I just made this again in my new bread machine and it was almost impossible to get out of the pan.  I ended up ripping it out and leaving the entire bottom of the loaf stuck in the bottom of the pan.  I am going to try and salvage what I can, but I'm not pleased with this.  Maybe I could have cooked it for less time, because the bottom was hard and stuck fast to the paddles, but the inside is lovely and it does taste good...have to say that about it, it tastes great and the inside is wonderful! So, I will still rate it 5 stars, for taste and consistency.

I made this in my bread machine (3 hrs 40 min. for French cycle).  Even though it fell (I think that was my fault) it was delicious.  Crispy on the outside and wonderful flavor and chewy texture inside.  I used olive oil in place of the butter, added 1/2 cup flour and slightly increased the rosemary. Didn't last long enough to get cold.  Will be making this again.  Addendum:  I made this again the following day and it fell again (not my fault this time) but even as a not so pretty loaf, it is really a good tasting bread.  I made paninni sandwiches with it and it's almost gone again.

I made these by hand so maybe that accounts for the difference, but my bread came out kind of dry. Maybe if I'd misted the oven while it baked it would have been more moist, but the crust was dry and the flavor seemed kind of hollow, if that makes any sense. I think I'll stick with my herb bread recipes.

I made this bread by hand and it rose beautifully 3 times, but unfortunately when it was baked it did not.  It came out quite dense.  It is probably just my lack of cooking skills that are to blame.

Love the flavor of this bread so much! Only did two things differently: (1) added a bit extra flour than the recipe called for and (2) I don’t have a bread maker so I had to bake it in the oven following tips from other users. It turned out great!

It was delicious!  I had to make it the old fashioned way.  I have been known as the family bread machine killer, so I'm not allowed to have one.  I enjoy bread making.  The garlic was just perfect.  Thank you for a great bread.  I'll make it again soon.

I made this bread today.  I use my bread machine to mix my dough and the first rise. I then remove and shape and bake in my oven.  I removed the pan and the dough was runny.  No way I could do anything with it.  So, I added an additional cup of flour, put it back in my machine to mix.  The cup of flour was what it needed.  I shaped, let it rise and baked.  It turned out fine.  The flavor was great.  But if I ever make this again, I will use 3 cups of flour, as opposed to 2 cups.  I am thinking the amount in the recipe is wrong.  That is why I gave it 3 stars

So good.  I used fresh Rosemary and garlic.  Made dough by mixer with proofed bread machine yeast, let double, shaped loaf, doubled and baked 400 for 25 minutes.  Easy to make.  Makes one loaf.

This recipe makes a delicious loaf of bread.  I've made it several times now.  Instead of using crushed rosemary I used whole dried rosemary and doubled the amount. Also doubled the garlic. Perfect with pasta. I also toasted it and served with scrambled eggs for breakfast.

I've made this bread quite a few times and it's always delicious and pairs well with homemade soups. I use powders garlic rather than fresh garlic because when I have used fresh minced garlic the bread doesn't rise as well and it comes out very dense. I also add a 1/4 cup more bread flour. I also add basil and a few other herbs.

I've made this six times now with mixed results. Flavor is good, but the dough tends to fall. Not worth the risk in my opinion - there are more reliable recipes for rosemary bread.

the measurements for this are bizarre. 17 tbsp= approx 1cup  and one pkg of yeast = 2 1/4tsp. 
I used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic. crushed up the dried rosemary before putting it in to release the oils and olive oil instead of butter. turns out great and the aroma while cooking is fantastic!

Turned out to be good! I dissolve the yeast in the warm water first before dump the other ingredients. Also substitute the minced garlic with garlic powder. This is a perfect sandwich bread for me.

The first time I made this recipe, it caved in and did not hold its shape, even after I added a bunch of flour.  This time, I set the machine on the dough setting and then shaped the dough into small sandwich sized loaves.  I don't think this dough is meant to hold the large loaf shape of the bread machine pan.  I also did not include the rosemary or garlic and it was still pretty delicious!

This bread was wonderful.  I increased the flour to 2 1/2cups and used 1 1/4tsp of yeast.  It came out perfectly.  My family ate the entire loaf with dinner and my 3yr old was crying because he wanted more.

To me, this bread has the consistency of a foccia than a French bread.  Use fresh rosemary (3x as much as dry) and fresh garlic.  When hot, drizzle with olive oil and lightly salt with kosher salt.  So delicious!

This bread was easy to make and had a great taste. Thomas, my 5 year old son, loved it and couldn't wait to tell everyone else that it's delicious. He helped me make it and wants to do it again.

I made this for my first loaf of bread in my new bread machine!  It was great with cheese fondue for dinner!  I cut down on the garlic a little.  It was crusty on the outside and so soft inside.  Wonderful... it's a keeper.

I will use this again, but I need to change my cooking time.  I don't have a bread machine so I used the advice of doing the steam cooking in the oven.  It worked great, except I think the temp. was to high.  I might need to adjust for elevation.  My family ate the whole loaf without complaint and asked that I make it again.  I also didn't add the garlic and rosemary because my kids like jelly on their bread.
