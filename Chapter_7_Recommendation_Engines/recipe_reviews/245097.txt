This is great!  I love cooking with orzo.  I used a roll of breakfast sausage, a few more seasonings to suit our taste.  The ingredients are something  I always keep on hand, so this recipe will be prepared often.  Great to pack for lunch the next day.

Love this recipe.  It is also good with all kinds of sausages.  So nice to have a recipe that seems creamy but no actual dairy was needed (except for butter which I used a substitute).

I really loved this recipe, however I used what I had on hand which was fresh rosemary, Tyme, chives and only mozzarella. I added a chicken thigh (cooked in the butter fist with salt, pepper and garlic powder), small dice with the hot sausages. I also cooked 1 cup of pasta with 2 cups of broth for just two of us with left overs. So good! Lost of wiggle room with this recipe to use any meat and herbs.

Turned out really good.  Only addition was a half of chicken breast diced, browned with sausage to make it more of a main dish.  I made four servings which called for 1 and a half cups of orzo.  The dish would have been better balanced with one cup.  I am soon to be 65 years old and orzo is new to me.  I knew what it was but never used.  One afternoon, shopping in the pasta section, a young man was looking for orzo.  I asked him what he used it for.  He said for pilaf..used instead of vermicelli.. Been hooked ever since!
