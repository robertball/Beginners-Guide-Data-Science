i have made this cake several times, although i make a frosting combining instant vanilla pudding made according to the packages directions, a tub of whipped topping, and a can of drained crushed pineapple.  it goes really well with this rich, moist, and dense cake.

this is a wonderful, tasty, moist cake.  the oranges should be folded into the batter just before placing into pans.    i tried the glaze, but think that this cake needs a frosting to do it justice.  i recently had good results whipping together the following: 8 oz. cool whip,  1 small van. pudding mix,  1-ll-oz can undrained mandarin oranges, and 1/4 c. triple sec.   reserving some mandarin oranges to place around the top sets this off nicely.

this was VERY average at best.  i would recommend adding the juice of the oranges in first, then the fruit when the batter is well incorporated.  all the mixing made the oranges disappear and basically seem nonexistent!

I agree with other reviews about adding the oranges at the end and then folding them in.  I added about 3-5 drops of orange oil (not extract) to bump up the orange flavor.  It still needed more orange flavor and I wished I would have added more.  I purchased my oil at a cooking utensils store since they usually don't carry it at grocery stores.
