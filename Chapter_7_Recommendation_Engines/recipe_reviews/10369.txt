I loved the fact that these didn't have to chill before rolling out.  The dough was very easy to handle.  I wasn't thrilled with the overall flavor, but my husband liked them quite well.

These are like the cookies my depression-era grandmother made. They are not too sweet and are a bit on the biscuit-y side, taste wise. I adored them. It made a ton of cookies (I think I got 6 or seven dozen out of the recipe) and I divided up the dough and added lemon to some of it, cinnamon to some and coconut to some. It was like having a cookie variety in one recipe!  I will make this recipe regularly now and I cannot thank you enough for bringing a little taste of my grandma back to me! Your recipe was a wonderful gift to me. Many thanks.

These cookies are easy to make, but I would call them "scones" before I would call them "sugar cookies."  They have the flavor of a sweet biscuit, rather than a cookie.

My 3 year old granddaughter spotted the sugar "sprinkles" in my pantry and it was, "Grandma, we make cookies!?" Uh oh, how to make sugar cookies in a few minutes without refrigeration time? These cookies filled the bill to a "S"or Sprinkle!! She helped me make the entire batch of dough in my stand mixer. But the main event is sprinking the dough with all colors of SPRINKLES!! Not the world's best cookie, but certainly tasty enough!! Makes a lot!! Also liked the other suggestions about dividing the dough and giving each batch a different flavor. Will try the lemon.

Very good. A bit sticky to roll out. Added flour to surface. Might use cinnamon instead of nutmeg, just a personal preference.

I have a family recipe that is almost the same.  I make it every Christmas.  Mine only has 5 cups flour, 1/2 cup less sugar and no nutmeg.   It is suppose to be not sweet as they are frosted with frosting.  I like the idea of the sugar topping as that would go faster than frosting each cookie.  They end up like little cakes.  It is my favorite cookie.  We have made them  egg and dairy free with flax eggs and soy milk.  I am making them gluten free too with a 1 to 1 flour.

Really good, really soft. 
I made a 1/2 batch of these cookies and I wish I would have made a full batch. Based on the reviews I increased the vanilla from 1 tsp for the half batch to 1 1/2tsp. I also added 2 extra TBS of sugar and a 1/4 tsp of almond extract. No biscuit flavor here. We also sprinkled sugar on the top. Will be making these again!
