When I first read this recipe I found the combination of ingredients a little odd. I debated whether or not to try it but I kept going back to it so finally I caved in and made it. All in all not bad1 I'm giing it three stars because it was good not great. It's definitely different. I'll make it again for sure but next time I'd like to try a different vegetable rather then the cucumber. Possibly some spinach or celery. Worth trying!

The Woman I Love thought this sounded weird so I made it for myself and ate it over several days. It was okay I guess. The cucumber and chicken broth combination definitely had an Asian feel to me. The sirloin strips however didn't seem to fit. It occurs to me looking at the recipe again that I only added the red wine vinegar salt and pepper to the first bowlful and forgot to add it the next couple of days. It's definitely bland without those three seasonings but it's still not terribly exciting with them. This is pretty easy and quick and filling but nothing special in my opinion.

My kids and I tried it as it was unusual. If you let the ingredients all sit in the bowl after they have been combined it all blends together perfectly. This is a quick easy and healthy meal.:)
