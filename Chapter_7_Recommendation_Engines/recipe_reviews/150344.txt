This is Heather, the creator of this recipe.  As a suggestion for others when using this recipe, I have substituted the corn muffin with apple cinnamon muffin mix, berrry muffin mix, and bannana nut muffin mix.  That is actually my daughter's preferred way of eatting them.  Any style muffin mix will do.  I hope you all enjoy it.

I made this recipe this morning for my boys. I did a double take when the recipe called for two TABLESPOONS of 
baking powder, so I changed it to two
TEASPOONS. Other than that, this was
a hit with my family. The batter wasn't
too thick, it was perfect. I slathered
the cakes with butter and honey and 
it was wonderful.

Will definitely make again. And again.

Cheap to make and great change from
the typical pancake recipe.

Was good but like others have said be careful because some of the Corn mix boxes are 8.5 oz so you need to at least increase the liquid content of the recipe in order to avoid dry pancakes.

These are the best pancakes something about the cornmeal texture and the fluffy pancake make these the best my family keeps asking me to make them again and again. I wouldn't change a thing!

Delish! I used just 2 tsp of b. power instead of the tbsps. I also used the Jiffy mix which was more than 7 oz, but I evened it out by adding an extra 1/4 cup or so of milk. The pancakes were perfect and easy to make. I topped em off with some boysenberry jam and my boyfriend fell in love. Thank you!!

Made for breakfast this early morn (I actually went to the store last week and bought corn muffin mix so I could try this recipe). My 9 year old said this recipe was a "4 1/2" (: which is high praise from him. I used the Jiffy corn muffin mix, which was 8.5 oz, not 7, so I reduced the flour a bit. I loved the submitter's suggestion of using other mixes...lends to alot of variety with this recipe! Can't wait to try other variations! Thanks for the post!

I routinely add more liquid to pancake recipes as I prefer a thin pancake so that was the only reason I did not follow the recipe as given.  However, I could not turn these pancakes after cooking the first side.  Each one fell apart.  We ate them anyway and I liked the taste, but do not understand how I can adapt this recipe so the pancake doesn't fall apart when turning.

This pancake recipe was very good. I would have liked it to taste more corn-cakey but otherwise a delicious alternative. I definitely want to try it with other muffin mixes.

The batter as the recipe is written is too thick.  I had to thin it out with about an extra quarter cup of milk.  Other than that, great and easy to make as long as you have the cornbread mix on hand.

Edited on 7/23/08 - Tried the recipe with the blueberry muffin mix and it was awesomely light and fluffy.  Didn't need to thin out the batter this time around.

My 7 year old daughter did the measuring and mixing for me. We used a Pumpkin muffin mix from Aldi that was 14oz rather then 7oz. I had her do the conversions to double the other ingredients. I also had her add in chopped walnuts. I will freeze the extras to reheat later this week.  My daughter thought it was so cool that we were using the muffin mix to make pancakes. She's been making muffins, cupcakes and brownies from box mixes so this was a non-intimidating way to have her move into making things with more ingredients. Then all I have to do is the baking.   I didn't read the reviews before hanb and didn't even think about the baking powder being too much. I will definitely only use 2 tsp next time we make these. I did also add more milk to make it the right consistency for pouring. I assume this varies to some degree depending on the muffin mix that is used.    These were light, fluffy and yummy! This would be an easy recipe to use for jar gifts at Christmas.

Very good recipe- my family and I really enjoyed these pancakes.  I made a few revisions for a healthier pancake: I swapped the cooking oil for sugar-free applesauce, swapped regular milk for almond milk, and regular flour for whole wheat flour.  I even used whole wheat corn muffin mix as opposed to your standard muffin mix.  These are delicious with pure maple syrup. Yum!

Well, these were certainly different. More of a cornbread in a pancake shape, than an actual pancake though. Hubby didn't like his and threw it out, I love cornbread so I ate mine, but they certainly weren't anything like what I call a pancake in flavor or texture anyway. They tended to crumble easily too. Thanks anyway.

Best ever pancakes!  One of my sons is a huge corn muffin fan and he went nuts over this.  The idea for me came from IHOP in Southern California where I first tried them and fell in love.  YUM

This was really good and super convienant. The EASY way to get your blueberry packcakes w/o all the hassel!! One pointer: I put in the muffin mix first, so all the blueberrys were concentrated in the bottom of the bowl. I would use a wooden spoon to bring them up. And remember, pancake batter should be a little lumpy!! :D

Loved them! Also added fresh corn to the mixture and since my corn muffin mix was 6.5 oz pkg added a little more flour. Had no problem flipping - they were light, fluffy and really good! Served with pure maple syrup - YUM-YUM  - so easy!

Great to me just OK to my husband. That is why I gave it 4 stars and not 5. Super easy. I will try this recipe with other muffin mixes and see if he likes those.

I'd give this recipe NO stars if I could! I've never been so disappointed in a new recipe in my life. I could not use the batter. I couldn't even flip the pancakes. Complete waste of my time and money. HUGE disappointment!!

Just made this with a 7 ounce package of Martha Whites blueberry pancake mix. Followed the recipe exactly, but reduced baking soda to 2.5 teaspoons. They came out perfect, fluffy and delicious! Really impressed at how simple and great these are...recommended!

I added 1/4 cup sour cream to add more moisture, texture and flavor. I can only eat 1 at a time so I cook and refrigerate the others to warm in the toaster at a later time. They make a great middle of the day snack!

They were good but they turned out pretty heavy. It's probably because I subbed whole wheat flour though. Next time I may try reducing the flour to 1/3 c and see what happens. Overall a quick and easy way to make pancakes and we'll definitely try it with other muffin flavors, so I'll give this a 4 for potential.

This was horrible!  Is this recipe really supposed to have 2 TABLESPOONS of baking powder? I followed the recipe exactly as written & my family & I couldn’t eat the pancakes. There was a weird taste & kind of hot sensation in our mouth from eating a few of them. I thought it seemed weird that it was tablespoons & not teaspoons of baking powder, but I did not see any other review mentioning this, so I continued with the recipe. I tripled the recipe because my kids love pancakes & I had to throw the batter & pancakes away. So disappointing.
*After looking further at the other reviews, I saw two people had changed their recipe from tablespoons to teaspoons. Ugh! I wish I would’ve looked at more reviews or trusted my instinct on the measurements. 
This recipe needs to be edited.

This was easy and very tasty. I did use the jiffy mix which is 8.5 ounces and the pancakes seemed to fall apart so next time I’ll adjust the Ingredients accordingly. But they were very tasty

My husband loved these pancakes! The only thing was that they fell apart easily.

If I could give this zero stars, I would. These are inedible with 2 Tbs. of baking powder. It’s disgusting.

I used 2 tsp instead of tablespoons of baking powder. I used the whole larger package of Jiffy and just added milk till I looked the consistency of the badder.

I didn't see that several people adjusted the recipe so that it wasn't dry. I too did a double take when it called for 2 tablespoons of baking powder, especially when the Jiffy mix already has baking powder in it. The recipe did have 4 stars, so I just trusted it. My husband and I both thought it was dry and he said that he could taste baking powder.

very good I added a little bit of sugar to make them sweeter and a tad bit more corn muffin mix I found it to be a little watery but over all very good.

Following the recipe on the Jiffy box always yielded fragile and thin pancakes. The amount of  baking soda and flour, in this recipe, give the batter stability resulting in thicker fluffier pancakes... just what I like! Thanks for the recipe!

The whole purpose of me wanting to use jiffy mix to make pancakes was because I ran out of baking powder and did not want to make the trip to the grocery store this morning so I improvised. I used one teaspoon of baking soda, I also used buttermilk instead of regular milk and I added a tablespoon of vanilla extract. They were awesome!

Made it just as the recipe called though had a 7 oz corn muffin mix so increased milk by 1/4 cup. Went for the 2 Tbs baking powder and they came out perfect.

I substituted pancake mix for the flour and baking powder, I added sautéed bananas and ssprinkled cinnamon into the batter.  I also stirred in some honey..... Yum but sticky on the pan.

It's a great recipe! I wouldn't recommend to use the corn muffin mix. I felt that the flavor of the corn muffin mix was diminished. It would be great for like apple cinnamon,blueberry, etc muffin mixes
Also, I had the Jiffy corn muffin mix which was 8.5 oz so, I increased the milk to almost 2 cups.

Good recipe but mine were more pancake than cornbread. I added 1/4c of milk to offset the extra 1.5oz in Jiffy mix. Also lost 1 to a way too hot pan... I recommend medium heat vs med-high. 

Next time I will substitute buttermilk for milk and ghee (butter) for oil. I will also use 1/4c of whole wheat flour instead of more milk and cook in a cast iron skillet to better control heat.

All around good basic recipe to start from. Look forward to making with changes and may try with other mixes too.

Pancakes turned out really delicious and a great recipe to use with the various box mixes - will definitely make again! 

I made the recipe as directed with the only modification being a splash of cooking oil instead of the required 2TBSP.

Made batter exactly as stated (2 TBSP baking powder) with the exception of using the entire box of Jiffy corn mix (8.5 oz) and used a bit of buttermilk (about 1/2 cup I had to use up) and about 3/4 cup milk.  Turned out great!  The batter, however, is not like the normal pancake batter I am used to, but after the first few pancakes, these were simple and enjoyed by my toddler.  Thanks for the recipe!
