My Hungarian family always made this dish too! We added sugar to taste for a little sweeter flavor.

Excellent recipe!!!  I leave out the poppy seeds, add at least one teaspoon of chopped garlic, add one pkg of smoked sausage cut into cubes and sprinkle the entire top with Parmesan cheese!  Add a salad and a piece of bread!  Love it!

This was super easy to make and very moist.  It was just not my taste, but other than personal preference, it was the way it was supposed to be.

This is such a tasty dish! I usually grind the poppy seeds in my coffee grinder for a better flavor and texture. A great meatless dish. As another reviewer mentioned, you can make it sweet or salty. We usually make the sweet version (no onions or parmesan cheese, extra sugar, walnuts, extra poppy seeds).

This is a definite make again, however I did leave out the poppy seed as well.
