This was a very good and very easy recipe. Because we like lots of flavor, I increased the amounts of garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper to about a 1/2 teaspoon each and added some dried minced onion to the bread crumbs. Also, I made my own seasoned bread crumbs by adding a couple of teaspoons of italian seasoning to plain panko bread crumbs. The panko bread crumbs make the chicken really crispy.  Also, I place the chicken on a baking rack inside of a foil-lined baking sheet so that air can get below the chicken and keep it crisp on all sides, including the bottom. I also spray the chicken with cooking spray to help the chicken stay crisp.

Impressively yummy, even without the bread crumbs (eating gluten free and low-carb because of Celiac Disease and type 1 Diabetes). Definitely will be repeating this!

Easy, but will do a few things different. They were to greasy, so next time I'll leave the butter off & spray the pieces. Also, I did add more onion & garlic powder, but will had a lot more as you don't even get a hint of the taste. We also put them on a rack & think that works best. The pieces get cripsy on all sides.

I saw no reason to dip these in butter and add to the fat content. Instead, I dipped them in fat-free Ranch dressing. I left the rest of the recipe as written. Best chicken we've had!

I cut out a little of the cheese, because my husband isn't a big cheese fan. I added seasoning to suit our taste, which was quite a bit more than the recipe called for. I ended up cooking the wings for about 20 minutes on each side. And, they came out great. I know that a lot of reviewers have said they weren't crispy enough. But, mine came out nice and crispy (considering they weren't actually fried). I would definitely make these again. Thanks, Lisa!

Moist, but dull.

I cooked about 3-5 longer on a side because my pan was VERY full. Chicken was moist, but largely flavorless. DH thought we should have rolled in garlic-parm mix after baking (we also omitted the bread crumbs).

I liked this recipe, I thought the flavor was good but even after adding five minutes to the cooktime not as crispy as when I fry in a frying pan.  I was looking for a little healthier way to do wings but still have them be crisp.  The next time I try these I may add a little extra time again to the cooktime and see if that helps with the crispness.

Made it tonight for dinner and was GREAT! Did tweak the recipe a little by adding garlic pepper and some Italian seasoning instead of the onion power and it was delicious! Crispy outside with a crunch and moist inside.
Will be added to the official recipe box!!

First time a recipe actually turned out really good. It was quick and easy. I did have to cook it a little longer than it says but it was delicious.

Very good! Love the strong roasted parmesan flavor you get. I would suggest flouring the chicken before dipping it in the butter so that it sticks better. Following the recipe's instructions, I had a lot of trouble getting the breading to adhere! Once it was on though it was quite tasty and moist.

These were good for something different. I made 2.5 lbs of wings and 1/2 the ingredients except I went a little heavy on garlic and onion powder. They were done in 30 min, but went about 45 mins to make them really crispy! I will make these again. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is easy and delicious!  I added a cookie rack on top of the baking sheet to ensure that all sides of the leg were crispy.  I'm excited to make this again!

Great flavor. A big hit with the family. So simple that my son helped me batter the wings by pouring the ingredients. Easy dinner. Bake and go do some chores while it cooks!

Very very good. I even tried it on a whole chicken parts other than the wings and it was amazing. I only cooked it for 60 minutes instead of 20 and it was very very good.

I liked it a lot.  I did not have the cheese so I just went with the remaining ingredients and added some chicken seasoning to boost up the flavor.  I also brushed the chicken wings with a light coat of liquid smoke.  It was really good and very moist but at the same time completely done which is sometimes tricky with chicken at least for me.  Next time I will cook it on a rack so that it does not sit in the batter and perhaps will give a crispier result.  I really appreciate you guys for posting your recipes.  I am especially appreciative of recipes like this that is fast and easy and actually turns out quite delicious!  Thank you Lisa!

It was a dud in my house. I wish I had a baking rack like one person commented on because I think they could have crisped up more. I thought the flavor was OK and the chicken was tender. My husband ate half of one and pushed his away, so it was a real waste of my time from his standpoint. But he's impossible to please.

the meat literally fell off bone, I added few more seasonings to spice it up, used Italian bread crumbs,  garlic shredded cheese I got from trader Joe's,  also added some paprika to the mix, for a side I cut up some potatoes and used the remainder crumbs to sprinkle over potatoes, and corn on the cob, so delicious!! loved it!

This turned out great and tastes almost as good as pan fried chicken. I recommend using a LOT of cooking spray so that they don't stick to the foil.

This was so very moist and crispy. I used panko  breading because thats what I had on hand.  I do not have seasoned ones.  I will make this again and add a little more seasoning  maybe a cajun seasoning. mix. I served the wings with some local honey , so very good.

Horrible recipe.  I made it following the directions and the chicken never crisped up.  It was unfortunate and time consuming as I had to fry the chicken in oil to get it crispy.  It was a soggy gloppy mess and I upped the oven temp to 425 hoping it would do something.  40 minutes later the chicken still looked raw; it was not but not crispy at all.   I'll never use this recipe again.

Olive oil can be substituted for butter. 
For crisper results, use a baking rack.
Use convection oven,  same temp 
Bake 23 mins 
Turn pan
Bake additional 14 min

I was skeptical about the crispiness of the skin when I turned the chicken.  But when it was done, it looked great and was perfectly crispy.  I did put it in for an extra 5 minutes because all drummettes were not crispy all around the first time.

Used salted butter, not margarine and opted for garlic salt instead of garlic powder.  Also threw in a little  ground red pepper, ground pepper corn, dash oregano,  and a bit of Lawrys..    Any spice flavor you like you could throw in.   My chicken came out FANTASTIC....     it really was delicious, and no complaints from my in house food critic.  I had rather large wings so it required additional baking time, and I turned it over a couple more times until it got crunchy on the outside, inside was still morist and tender.   I will definitely make this again.   Served with Rice Pilaf, Spinach Salad, and Corn on the Cob.

I will make it again, but next time i'll definitely add more flavor and cook for about 20 mins longer due to the fact that I prefer the wings to be less fatty. Great idea though,  just have to follow my own flavor profile

Followed exactly, however next time I will add more garlic and onion spice.  Also added ground cayenne.   Had to cook about 20 minutes in order to crisp chicken.  Otherwise, very good recipe if you do t want to fry

This was my first time oven frying chicken....it came out DELICIOUS!!!! I will definitely make again. I did season the chicken with Creole seasoning (southern girl!!) and added paprika to the bread crumb mixture, but those were the only changes I made. I also baked my wings longer than 30 minutes to make extra crispy. This is definitely a must try!!!

Upon the recommendations from other reviews I did use the Panko breadcrumbs and increased the seasonings as suggested. Wings came out quite moist. Wasn't as crunchy as I'd like but extremely tasty. Will definitely cook again.

I only gave this four stars because the chicken was too greasy for my taste.  The chicken was moist and the meat itself tasted really good.  I'm hoping another reviewer will come up with a suggestion to replace the butter but still make it possible for the bread crumb mixture stick to the chicken.  I baked them for 15 minutes when I turned them over.  M

Delicious and easy to follow recipe ... Plus you can create any flavor you want based on seasonings you may have. I needed to add 10 more minutes to the cooking time to get them cooked through but they had a great crunch while staying juicy inside.  While it was baking I made a quick Mumbo Sauce (DC dipping sauce) which was absolutely phenomenal! They pair well together!

Delicious! Very good and the chicken was perfectly cooked and tender. I absolutely loved the breading and it's flavor, but for some reason my brother wasn't a fan. Oh well. I will definitely be making this again, very simple.

This was very easy to make and everyone loved it! Just as good as pan fried. I did make a few changes though. I used a full tsp each of garlic and onion powder and added a little paprika and a dash of cajun seasoning instead of regular salt. I also used mostly panko bread crumbs mixed with a little bit of Italian crumbs.  My only complaint is that it was hard to keep the coating from coming off when I flipped the wings over.

These were the most flavorful chicken wings I have ever had. I made a few minor changes, but will definitely make them again. I used unsalted butter and did not add the pinch of salt it called for.  The parmesan cheese and the flavored bread crumbs has more than enough salt.

This recipe is very easy.  And your family will love it.  I did season the chicken then dip in ranch dressing. Then follow the remaining instructions breading the chicken. I also cook for 1 hour and 20 minutes. Chicken soft, tender and tasty. Yummy

Made these for a quick Saturday afternoon snack and was pleasantly surprised how easy it was. My wife thought these were the best tasting wings ever ! Very flavourful just a wee bit greasy. I extended the cooking time ten minutes to crisp them up a bit more. I'll be making these ones again ! Thx for the recipe

Instead of melted butter, I use I Can't Believe spray butter.  And I add a pinch of seasoned salt.  Loved the clean up.

This was pretty good for oven baked breaded chicken. The butter helps the coating crisp up but my batch could have stood to bake a little longer to really get crispy (or maybe to drizzle more melted butter on the wings - I did spray them with butter cooking spray). I'd use the general recipe again; the flavours here were pretty good but could be improved.

Wasn't anything special.  We needed more flavor added to it.
