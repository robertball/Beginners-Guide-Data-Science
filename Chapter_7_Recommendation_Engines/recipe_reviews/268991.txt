I love one pan meals and this recipe does not disappoint.  I did not use the hot sauce as I can't eat nightshade veggies but I did not miss it.  Be sure to turn the chicken while broiling so the bacon browns on both sides.

Great dinner and the directions are easy to follow. I substituted with uncured bacon. Really enjoyed the hot sauce at the end. Tons of flavor on this meal.
