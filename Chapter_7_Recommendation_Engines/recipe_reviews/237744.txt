Loved it. Didn't use it on fish though. I grilled two packages of chicken wingetes until crispy then tossed them in the sauce. I would say it's a very versatile sauce and worth trying.

Made it exactly as it except substituted a 1/4 tsp of ground ginger because I didn't have fresh, and I marinaded it over night. Delish!

I broiled mine. I took the remaining marinade and reduced in a small sauce pan to a slightly thicker sticky consistency and brushed on top of salmon halfway through broiling as well as after it was done for a nice dark color. It created a great caramelization. Delicious.

This was so very GOOD! There are other teriyaki  marinade brands out there and I have tried a few, but I Always go back to the Kikkoman brand and it always produces the best flavor! ( No paid advertising here -lol).  This recipe gave the fresh salmon fillets such a wonderful flavor. Will definitely use this again and share with friends. Thanks Kikkoman!

This is, hands down, incredible. I  had lots of salmon so I used the whole bottle of teriyaki sauce. and I marinated the salmon for 45 minutes.

Couldn't grill it, so I baked on an aluminum covered cookie sheet (with low sides) for 20 minutes or so.

Got absolutely rave reviews with seconds all around.

A very simple recipe.  I prefer plain salmon - I just love the flavor.  But my family loves it cooked like this.

Made ALMOST exactly as written! I used salmon filets(marinated  for 30 mins) and I already had PF Chang Teriyaki Salmon on hand so I used that instead. I also added minced garlic when mixing the ingredients all together simply because we loooooovve garlic here! This turned out excellent!!! My husband is not a seafood person and even he raved about the flavor! Thanks so much for this super simple recipe. Will definitely make this again and again

The flavour was DELICIOUS and the salmon was nice a moist! Only problem we had was on our end, my husband grilled it  wrapped in tin foil so the skin didn't get crispy like I like it :( So lesson learned, next time pull it out of the tin foil at the end and crisp the skin.

I'm not a real fish lover but my wife is so I make the fish for her. I whine and grumble but eat it as well. I must say I used this marinade on fresh Salmon and it was just the best fish I ever ate! I grilled the Salmon and the marinade took away the "fishy" smell and added a delightful teriyaki flavor with the touch of ginger. Fast, easy and super taste can it get any better? I can't wait to try it on chicken and other things! Didn't change a thing in the recipe!
