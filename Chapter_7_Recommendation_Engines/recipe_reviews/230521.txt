I make homemade almond butter and always end up with more than I know what to do with. This recipe is the answer  - yum!  Will make them with toasted almonds on top next time instead of chocolate Kisses.

Tasty and full of almond flavor. I did use only all-purpose flour, as I didn't have any whole wheat flour on hand. Other than that, I followed the recipe. They turned out a little too flat (I prefer the puff of the traditional peanut butter version), and could have been baked a few minutes more (for 12 minutes total), in my opinion.
