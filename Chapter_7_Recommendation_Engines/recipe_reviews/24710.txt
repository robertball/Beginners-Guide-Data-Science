I thought this recipe was excellent.  I did make a few changes though.  I used a 14oz package of tofu, rinsed and patted dry.  I used 2/3 cup soy milk and about 1 1/2 cups pepperjack cheese which gave it a nice kick.  I added mushrooms, a little dry mustard and a little nutmeg.  And finally, instead of the crust I used the mandolin to slice some sweet potatoes and made a 'crust' out of that.  I probably used about 2 tbsp olive oil in the bottom of the pan to prevent sticking.  I cooked it on the bottom rack at 400 for about 45 minutes until the sweet potatoes looked golden brown from the bottom.  Yumminess!

I used fresh spinach - I am a vegetarian who needs a balanced set of vitamins and minerals to be happy :) so I added in a wealth of other vegetables - finely chopped brocolli, carrots, zucchini, red pepper (despite protests from other reviewers, brocolli really does add something to this recipe).  My only warning would be there are many many subtle differences between tofu's - make sure you use a less bitter/sour type (some are relatively flavourless and you cannot taste the fermented flavour as much - these are better for this recipe).

This is a delicious recipe for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike.  I have played around with it a bit at times adding different seasonings or different cheeses, but have remained true to the original poster.  This is a keeper and great for breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner, picnics, you name it.  As a vegetarian, it was an easy to make meal that tasted great and I couldn't taste the tofu.  In fact, I don't necessarily like the taste of raw tofu, but if you compare that to say chicken or any other meat that you simply stuck in the oven without proper preparation or seasoning, you probably would say it tasted pretty bad, too.  If you are unsure about it, honestly try it once before saying that you don't like it.  It's a great dish that everyone will enjoy.  Just save yourself some grief and don't tell anyone that it has tofu in it. :) UPDATE: I highly recommend prebaking the crust for at least 10 minutes to get your crust to hold up well for this recipe.  If you don't, it's ok, but it is even better when it is prebaked.

This dish goes so fast at my house that I double the recipe, omit the crust and bake in a casserole dish.

For those who are looking to cut the fat even more than just getting the eggs out - I substituted the recipe to include skim milk, crumbled feta cheese (4 ounces) and grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese (6 tablesppons), and it turned out pretty well.  I could'nt tell you the fat content difference, but the calorie content have been cut to less than half (136 calories per serving).  I also drained the tofu between paper towels, afterwards let it sit on tap water for a few minutes then drain it again - it was virtually "tofu-taste"-free as a result.

The Texture was amazingly like a normal Quiche.  The taste was wonderful, I went without the crust as one of the other posts had suggested.  It was wonderful, will definitely make again!
To add a little "egg" coloring I added 1tsp of powdered Mustard.  Very good!

This is one of my all-time favorite tofu dishes. I love that the basic recipe is simple to amend to use up any leftover veggies and cheeses in the fridge. My favorite combination to date uses crescent roll dough for the crust and contains a dash of lemon juice and about 2 tablespoons of dill in the filling to give it a tangy herbal kick. In my opinion, it's worth firing up the oven even in July to make this easy and delicious dish.

This was EXCELLENT! It's the only thing I've ever eaten with tofu that I've liked remotely!  Changes I made were: do it crustless, who needs the hassel and the fat!  Also, sauted the onions with garlic ahead, used 1/2 t. dry mustard for color and flavor, replaced the swiss with pepper jack cheese, and added a small package (29 cent kind) of thin ham chopped - as I'm not vegetarian. My kids even ate this - real winner.

This was pretty good, but next time I would use more than the suggested 8 oz of tofu, as the tofu-to-spinach ratio was definitely not to my taste- the quiche was almost entirely green! In my area, most tofu comes in 12 or 16 oz packages, anyway.

This was really easy to make and turned out pretty well.

I would recommend less garlic and more salt and pepper as it seemed pretty bland with just what the recipe called for.  I only used half of the spinach in the package.

I would also suggest getting a tofu that does not have a strong taste, as mine had that tofu taste, which my family did not like.

One last thing I would do would be to cook it a little longer so that the crust is really brown.  The 30 minutes that the recipe called for made my quiche a little mushy.  I had to cook it longer, then it was perfect.

As far as the crust goes, I would suggest getting the Marie Calendars Pie Crust, it was great!

Otherwise, it was very good and easy to make with a few revisions for personal taste :)

Five stars as revised, based on input from other commenters.  My husband--who loves quiche--said this was THE BEST quiche he has ever eaten--hands down!  Here's what I did: I used a 16 oz. block of extra-firm tofu, rinsed & drained.  2x the amount of milk to 2/3 c., added extra onion, 1 pkg. sliced mushrooms and a small piece of red bell pepper.  I saut√©ed the mushrooms with the onion and 1-1/2 tsp minced garlic in a tbsp of olive oil.  I added garlic powder, a pinch of cayenne, red pepper flakes and 1/2 tsp dry mustard, extra salt and white pepper. Also--sliced sweet potato with mandolin slicer and added that to my olive-oil sprayed pie plate for the crust.  I used all of the spinach called for, making sure to squeeze out all of the moisture I could.  I baked it for about 45 min. at 350 and let it sit on the counter to cool and set for about 10 minutes.  FABULOUS!  And the sweet potato crust rocks!

My husband is allergic to eggs and he loved the fact that he could finally eat a quiche! I sauteed the mushrooms with an onion and the garlic. Then, added it to the tofu mix with spinach, feta cheese, and mozzarella. I made one with crust and another in an oiled dish with sweet potato on the bottom like another reviewer suggested. My husband liked the sweet potato one better. Very tasty and adaptable.

I made this minus the crust it was excellent. I saute a large onion & a few cloves of garlic in olive oil, I added all the items to the blender minus the cheese garlic and onions, sprayed a non stick pie plate then put the onions and garlic in the pie pan, put the mixture into a bowl and hand mixed the cheese, I then mixed then added on top of the garlic and onions, baked for 40 min at 350 deg, then 5 min before done added more cheese on the top. I also added nutmeg, cayene pepper, dried red peppers. This was the first time I made it and was good, less calories minus the crust, I will make it again, and add some mushrooms.

The reason there's no broccoli in this recipe is because it's a "spinach" quiche! And the point of having tofu is for people who prefer no eggs, tofu is a terrific source of soy protein and it also reduces the "bad" fats in this recipe if otherwise substituted! That's why this quiche is called a "tofu" quiche, b/c it's different then every other type of quiche which all use eggs. I think it's terrific the way it is...I'd use a little less spinach too..just a pinch less if it's fresh spinch. If it's frozen use the whole package. Spinach has mega-loads of iron and it's sooooo good for you too!

Soft, medium, or firm tofu?  I am new to using tofu at all.  I saw the posts that recommend rinsing and drying it.  I'd like to try this, but I likely get once chance with my family.

Okay, so...Here's my two cents... :)
I used the 14 oz pack of tofu, extra firm. I used the 10 oz pack of frozen spinach and half of another pack. I used soy milk instead of regular milk. I wound up adding a tiny bit more than what the recipe called for. My ninja blender is EVERYTHING!! :) When I blended the soy milk and the tofu, it came out so smooth... Okay, so I used a mixture of different cheeses..Cheddar, Sharp Cheddar, Jack and Muenster. Lucky for me I'm a great cook so I used a bunch of different seasonings to really make this pop..I used a little sea salt, a little adobo (I use that for just about everything lol), pepper, garlic powder, a little cayenne pepper. I added the salt and pepper while I blended the tofu and the soy milk. When I mixed that with the other ingredients (spinach, blah blah blah) , I added the other seasonings. Put in the pie shell. After 45 minutes in the oven I got nervous since it seemed like the quiche was still mushy....However, I left it in the oven for an hour and a half...It came out perfect. The tofu cooked perfectly....

I've been making Tofu Egg Quiche a lot lately---using half a block of tofu and 3 eggs. Tonight I will try it with all tofu.  I saute half an onion, lots fresh garlic, a whole red bell pepper, and mushrooms. I thaw out a 10 oz pkg frozen spinach in microwave while pre-baking crusts for 10 minutes. For the dairy I use reduced- fat Celtic Cheddar from Trader Joe's and a little fresh parmesan and 1/2 cup non-fat milk. Salt and pepper of course and (optional) pinch red pepper, cayenne paprika or dry mustard. Quiche may be one of those dishes that's not easy to mess up 'cuz it always tastes good from the basic recipe with many variations.  It's the crust I need to try it without. I know that's where the fat and calories are.

This was delicious!  I made mine crustless though and used gruyere and swiss cheese instead.  I thought the cooking time was slightly off but that may be since I used a 12oz tofu container.  Took me about 50min at 350 degrees.   I would definitely make this again.  Easy to do variations too.

I've never had quiche, or eggs for that matter, so I'm not sure what this was supposed to taste like ... But I loved it! I added half the amount of spinach, as well as some grated zucchini. I used feta and cheddar cheese. The feta really adds a great flavor. I also love a little spice, so some chili flakes made it in too. To make it a bit healthier, I omiteed the crust, but it still made a great dinner!

This is definitly the best tofu dish I've tried. Honestly, you'd never know it had tofu and no eggs. Excellent consistantcy. I browned onions and mushrooms first, before adding it to the mixture. I wouldn't skip the crust, as others suggested, because it adds a nice buttery touch. I used the frozen kind and pre-baked it for 10 minutes as suggested. Oh, and don't skimp on the cheese.

Update: I tried it this time with less tofu, more veg, and layered raw sweet potato cut with a mandolin on the bottom for a crust. I loved the alternative crust!

This is really easy and delicious, I brought it to parties of different friends/families several times :) I did with the available cheeses from the grocery and also local greens/leaves and local veggies like winged beans, etc. I was able to test different types of tofus, and it's really important to press the water out of the tofu otherwise the mixture will dehydrate a lot after baking, shrinking its height (if tofu used has a lot of water in it). Use also the best kind of tofu like Korean firm ones.

This Tofu quiche was really good.  I did use pepper jack cheese as others did and used a 14oz container of tofu with a little added milk to make sure the blender could smooth out the tofu.  After making this quiche and one in which i used eggs and a tofu combo, i much rather prefer the tofu taste to the eggs and this quiche was eaten first at the party and not the other. lol

This was great! My husband had no idea it was tofu! We eat tofu often and this was a great change from the usual. I'm looking forward to making this again with different veggies.

This was a great quiche filling.  I forgot the onion, but it didn't hurt the flavor much.  I made baking powder biscuits and made mini quiches in muffins tins.  This recipe made enough filling for 18 mini muffins.  I baked them for the full 30 minutes.

This is great! My husband didn't even know it was a vegetarian dish.  It was a hit with my family.  I make this dish without the pie crust and it comes out great!

I made this for a vegan friend's party, using soy milk and some weird tapioca starch cheese in place of the cheddar and swiss, and it still came out good!  I did make some changes, and used a 12 oz package of tofu, as I couldn't find an 8 oz package.  I also sauteed the onion and some bell pepper in some vegan margarine to develop the flavors.  I ended up making mini quiches for the party- I used a biscuit cutter to cut small circles of pie crust and put them in a mini muffin tin; they were done in about 25 minutes.  All in all, a pretty good substitute for an egg quiche.

This is perfect for those that are allergic to egg and miss eating quiche. My husband who hates tofu loved this too. If you are not a strict vegetarian adding some bacon is a nice touch to this recipe.

I made the mistake of not cooking the pie crust before the liquids went in the crust so the bottom didn't cook well. But it was very tasty and I would make it again!

I used the Tenderflake pie crust. Definitely bake the pie crust before adding the filling. When it was freshly made, it seemed a bit watery, but after being refrigerated over night, it actually holds up very well now. The taste is not bad. Thanks for the recipe.

Very tasty but sometimes when I make this I do *something* wrong and the quiche doesn't set. It doesn't happen all the time so I don't really know what I'm doing. Maybe it's the type of tofu. Regardless, it's good.

I really enjoyed this recipe (I just finished my third piece) and would certainly make it again. I did make some additions though, I used 2 eggs in it, I sauteed chopped fresh spinach in some garlic and white onion just so it would wilt, and added about 4 pieces of cooked bacon chopped up (thats a very nice add if you're not a veg) also threw in some italian spices for fun. Don't have a blender so I used a hand mixer which worked like a charm. Broiled the top just as it was finishing cooking and it turned out very nice.

My second attempt at fixing a nutritious meal utilizing tofu...yeah, success and delicious! Great w/ salads or soup. I added mushrooms too mine and utilized Parmesan cheese in place of the Swiss, yum. Didn't have a pie crust on hand so I utilized the 'never failed pie crust 2', also listed in allrecipes. I have an old oven which probably doubled the baking time and I had to increase the temp, but it was so worth the wait.

Great recipe.  Last night at 6:30 pm I discovered that the leftovers I planned to use for dinner were gone, and suddenly needed to scramble to get something ready by 7:30.  This came together in a hurry.  I only gave it 4 stars because it hardly seemed like enough filling for the crust.  However, increasing the amount of filling would also increase the baking time, so maybe it was just as well this way.  I'll definitely make this again.  I didn't have Swiss, so just added some extra Cheddar.

I omitted the crust, added mushrooms and boiled fresh spinach with the onion as one previous reviewer had mentioned. I also used soft tofu because the recipe didn't specify. So this is more like a dip or topping for some nice crostini but the taste is pretty good. Perhaps if you follow the RECIPE it will turn out more like quiche but mine is a dip! tasty dip though!

We really enjoyed this. If I could find a healthier crust, I would make it more often. It had a more dinner feel than traditional egg quiches. We used 2% cheddar. Since there is no low-fat cheddar, next time we'll use fat-free and maybe add some other veggie like cauliflower or brocolli.

This recipe was great! I did take some of the advice above and added more tofu. I used all 10oz of spinach, 16 oz of tofu and added a squash and zuchinni along with 2/3 cup of milk instead of the 1/3 and more cheese. It turned out fabulous! I had never made anything with tofu before and my non-loving tofu family loved it!

AWESOME!! Very easy to make. However, you do need 12 ounces of tofu instead of 8 ounces that the recipe calls for. If you drain the spinach really well, 10 ounces frozen works just fine. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks Rachel!!

This recipe rocks!  I made this for brunch for a group of friends, vegetarians and meat-eaters included, and everyone agreed that it was better than regular egg quiches they had tried.  My husband is allergic to eggs, so this was a godsend for a breakfast recipe!  I can't wait to make it again. A few changes/suggestions: I used a whole wheat crust, and I sauteed the onions and garlic before adding them into the tofu/spinach mix.

My boyfriend made this for me so I could enjoy a quiche for the first time in my life since I don't eat eggs. I was very impressed with how it turned out. My only contribution was helping to make the pie crust. He precooked the onion and garlic to make it more palatable for me, and also used fresh instead of frozen spinach.

An instant family favorite! Delicious and easy to make - did not veer from the standard recipe, however next time I will double the recipe, skip the crust and bake in a 9x13 to feed my family of 6! Note: I would recommend a food processor instead of a blender - I have a Cuisinart food processor and it is worth every penny! Made the tofu mixture super smooth and creamy.

This was absolutely great!  I converted it to vegan by using soy milk and vegan cheese, and it was wonderfully delicious.  I agree that no one would know it wasn't "the real thing!" This will become a family regular: thanks!

I have made this TWICE and each time it turned out mushy in the middle. I put in the oven for 40 mins on 350 degrees and even added some flour the second time thinking that it would thicken it up. NOPE! still mushy. I like the idea of a tofu quiche, if only it had a better consistency. The taste was okay.. I felt like it was a little bland so I put salsa on it and that made it better. I pobably will just use eggs for my next quiche.

Delicious! I'm new to incorporating tofu into my diet (this is the first thing I've ever made with it), and I was so pleasantly suprised at how wonderful the taste and texture of this quiche is - at only about half the calories and far less cholesterol than the versions with eggs and cream. I used fresh spinach instead of frozen (I fried it in a little olive oil just until it shriveled so it would all fit in the pie crust), and I added a little ceyenne and extra garlic powder into the tofu and soy milk mixture. Additionally, since I'm not a vegetarian, I couldn't resist adding a little turkey bacon! OMG, that put it over the top! I fried up six slices (1 for each serving), diced them up, and stirred them into the final mixture. The turkey bacon only adds 10-15 calories per serving, and a ton of flavor. I'll definitely make this again!

I was shocked how good this tasted with the tofu... I did not make it with the crust, used pepper jack cheese.  It is definitely a very excellent option to egg based quiche.

This was sooo good!  We took the advice to add mushrooms and lined the pie pan with sweet potatos instead of a pie crust.  I also used feta instead of swiss.

OMG this was sooo good! Even my meat loving husband and his buddy loved this and had seconds (and thirds)! I made a few changes to the recipe-I sauteed mushrooms, white onions, and fresh spinach then added that to the tofu mixture with everything else. I also added a few shakes of dried mustard powder.  SO GOOD!

This was excellent! I used mozarella instead of swiss, and I blended the spinach with the tofu and milk in the first step, so my 3 year old would eat it, and it was a huge hit in our house! also I put a light layer of cheese on top, it is a quick & easy delicious recipe!

This was wonderful.  I was looking for a main dish for Easter for my son who is vegan and this hit the spot. (I used soy milk and soy cheddar/jack cheese.)   The other non-vegans enjoyed it also.  I will definately make this again.

I made this recipe on Sunday night so I can have breakfast for the week.  I followed the recipe as listed, and it came out perfect.  My son even liked it thinking I made it with just egg whites.  If he knew it was tofu, he wouldn't have even tried it. I will be making this again, using different vegetables so as not to get tired of it!

I love the taste of this (probably because I added in a lot of garlic. I didn't measure it but I probably used 8 cloves). I doubled the recipe of everything because I had double the amount of tofu and two prebaked pie shells. I was 2 oz's short of having the right amount of spinach. The only downside is that it turned out watery. Next time, I'll pat the tofu dry and maybe try sprinkling in some flour when I mix the tofu and milk. I'll add some sauteed mushrooms and a few slices of tomatoes on top as well. Very delicious!

great base, but made exactly as recipe called, and turned out too watery.I actually cooked it 10 min longer. Next time i will pat dry my tofu, and pat down my spinach too.If this is necessary,maybe it should be in the recipe. Ended up throwing away the quiche after picking at the top. But the flavor was good(added oregano paprika and dry mustard) and will be a great base once it is tweaked.

I used sauteed fresh spinach and dumped in other veggies I had left from other meals. Far beyond good and fooled tofu-wary family members. Very easy to make (one of my top priorities. Thanks for this one!

This recipe was delicious! We love tofu at my house so this was just another reason to cook it! I cooked the crust for a little ahead of time so that it wasn't mushy. I also left it in the oven for a good hour instead of the 35 minutes suggested. I kept checking to make sure the crust stayed golden... I think next time, I'll make the crust from sliced sweet potatoes as someone else suggested, I think I might prefer that to a white flour crust.

This quiche was full of flavor and everyone (a bunch of picky eaters) loved it.  I made it for a bridal shower where the bride was a vegetarian and even she liked it.  Even my sister, with high-end tastes for food and is quite a critic of my cooking, enjoyed it.

I made my own crust by sifting/whisking 1 cup all purpose unbleached fl & a 1/3 cup w.w. fl or half & half with 1/2 tsp of salt. Then mixing 1/2 cup melted margarine or vegetable oil with 2-3 Tblsps half & half or other cold milk or even water. Combine the wet & dry, stir as little as possible. Pat into pan. I did not use black pepper (I've heard it's not good for your health), instead of salt in the filling I used seasoned salt, I also added at least a Tblsp of nutritional/brewer's yeast flakes. For cheese I just used what I had on hand a blend of shredded Colby & Monterrey Jack. It was soo good soo delicious. I did have to bake it 20 mins longer than directions say. Turned out perfectly. I have some artichoke hearts & have been trying to decide how I want to use them. As an afterthought I thought they may go well thrown into the mix. I will definitely make again & maybe try adding some small artichoke pieces. Thank-you for this recipe! Everyone who tried it loved it!

A great way to incorporate TOFU into the diet. Really tasty. I added mushrooms. I did find I had to cook it longer than stated in order to help firm it up a bit. I will make again, and will try broccoli next time. Honestly, you will not know it has TOFU in it, and I did not miss the eggs a quiche normally has.

I'm not sure what I did wrong (I followed the recipe exactly as written), but it had a terrible taste. I was very excited to make this, so it was a big letdown. I'm wondering if it was the brand of tofu I purchased? Hmm. Not sure if I'll try it again...

Very tasty and easy to make. I substituted asparagus and mushrooms for the spinach. I've made this twice now and both times it had a looser consistency than I'd expected (hence the "4"). I wonder if adding one egg-white would help?

This is pretty flavorful--I might choose sharper cheese next time. I added some small slices of ham in it to add saltiness.  I also added mushrooms.  A bit mushy--the problem was not defrosting the spinach properly and not draining the tofu as much. Next time I will use extra firm in stead of firm tofu. Crust is not needed, we cooked the stuffing only and put it on bread.

I'm allergic to eggs so was happy to find this one.  It is wonderful!  A non-tofu eater would never know they weren't eating eggs!  I used 16 oz extra firm tofu, more milk had to be added and I put in a little too much salt.  But, I now have a new breakfast!  Thank You!

I was so happy and anxious to make this recipe and I did (last night).  I boiled the onions with fresh spinach  and added to my (firm)tofu.  When this was fully baked it looked "picture perfect" and tasted excellent!!  I had two slices before retiring to bed :-)

I used Sarai's idea of making a crust... but she used yams and I used thin sliced yellow potatoes layered in the bottom of the pie pan that was greased with a bit of olive oil. I used the filling as listed in the recipe... and then just salted the edges of the potatoes that were sticking up with some Kosher salt.  My family gobbled it up. I will definitely make this again!

This was not good.  Way, way, way too much spinach.  I increased the tofu to 12oz per other reviews.  There was no mistaking the tofu for eggs.  Maybe I did something wrong here, but we couldn't eat it.

I was very impressed with this recipe.  I was making brunch for a friend who does not eat eggs.  It is very hard to find brunch food that does not contain eggs!  I sauted the onion along with some mushrooms and garlic beforehand, substituted pepper jack for swiss, and baked the crust for 10 minutes first as other reviewers had recommended, but otherwise I followed the recipe and it turned out great.  I did not taste the tofu at all! My one concern was that it did not fill up my 9 inch pie plate so next time I would probably add more of everything.

This was a little salty for me, but great! I'll cut back on the salt next time. You can't tell it's tofu. I made mine with fresh spinach, mushrooms, and fat free cheese, and then poured it into an 8x8 glass baking dish (no crust). DELISH! I did have to cook it a LOT longer than listed but maybe I had too much liquid in it, or maybe it was too thick in the dish. Either way, it still came out fine. I want to make this again in muffin tins for on-the-go breakfast, but not sure if it will cook and set right. Worth a shot though!

Yum! Great texture. I followed the recommendations and rinsed and patted the tofu dry. Careful with the salt - the cheese alone would've added enough for us.

This is delicious!  I follow some of the suggestions from previous reviewers - adding mushrooms, feta, dry mustard and a pinch of nutmeg.  Absolutely delicious.  Thank you for this

I added steamed asparagus along with the spinach. The tofu didn't look like it was going to come together at first- it looked a bit like curdled milk in the mixer. But lo and behold, once it baked (in a pre-baked crust) for about 45 minutes, it firmed up quite nicely. Since I can't have egg yolk anymore, this was a great sub. Thanks!

This recipe impresses me every time. It's so easy yet so rewarding. I usually reduce the spinach, add mushrooms and cover with thinly sliced tomatoes. It makes for a delicious and nutritional meal.

I really liked the taste of this and it was not too hard to make.  It held its shape better as leftovers than when first made, so maybe next time I'll add a little less milk or let it set longer before eating (hard when hungry).  The true test for this dish is that my tofu-hating husband had it again the next day for lunch!

Not a repeat at our house.  The quiche mixture is too thick and just doesn't have a nice mouth-feel, at least for us.

This was the first tofu dish I've ever made.  I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have a pie crust so baked it without and instead of Swiss I used Mozzerella.  I also sprinkled cheese over the top about 5 minutes before it was done baking.  It was very good but a little bland - maybe it needed more salt and pepper?

This was awesome! I decided to make this without a crust and it was great! I used 9 ozs of tofu and added 2% milk until it looked about the consistency a quiche should. I learned after making this the first time that the tofu does not rise when baked, so the height you put it in the oven at is the height it will be when it is done cooking. I also recommend using a little bit of mustard seed for flavor and color, it really makes it look more like eggs!

I added smoked paprika, turmeric and dried parsley to add more taste.  I also added shredded carrots.  Because of this I allowed it to bake an additional 20 minutes and I also waited a full two hours before slicing. Can‚Äôt believe how good it came out.

Husband liked it, but I found the texture to be way too mushy, almost like a cream cheese type of texture. I used firm tofu and patted it dry, as well as thoroughly drying the spinach. Not sure where I went wrong

Excellent recipe! So easy and customizable.  Doubled recipe. Used fresh spinach and mozzarella. Sauteed the onion and garlic beforehand. Used red onion and added real bacon bits.  I also broiled after baking to get a better crispy top. Yum-O!

This is a great recipe for using tofu.  My son is on a no carb diet, and I'm trying to eat more healthy myself, so this worked wonderfully for both of us.  I followed the recipe with a few changes, based on other recommendations.  I did not use the crust, instead just baked it in a greased pie pan.  I added some yellow peppers, chopped fine and grilled them with the onion and garlic.  I added 1/2 tsp mustard and a pinch of nutmeg.  I also added about 1/4 cup parmesan along with the Cheddar & Swiss.  It took about 50 minutes to completely bake and turn the top golden.  I let it sit for 12 minutes before serving.  Excellent!

Very delicious! It took me more than 30 minutes because I used a frozen crust. When using a frozen crust, allow about 20 additional minutes in the oven. I prepared the filling ahead (the night before) and added the cheese during the morning.

I made it without the pie crust... despite patting it dry and everything, the quiche was a bit soggy on the day I made it, in my oven 35 min at 325 F. But it set wonderfully in the fridge. Love the taste, and love the guiltlessness!

This was my first time eating, let alone cooking, tofu, so I was skeptical. Wow, what an intro to tofu! Absolutely delicious. I used red onion and it was beautiful with the different colors. My husband, a self-confessed tofu hater, devoured this and requested we have it again. Highly recommended, and will be going into our menu rotation for sure.

I love this recipe.  I used a combination of spinach and broccoli along with substituting vegan cheddar, vegan Swiss cheese and almond milk.  Also I adding a bit more than 1/3 cup almond milk to have a smoother consistency. This recipe is an absolute winner!

This was really terrific. The whole family loved it. I made two small changes. I added more garlic and I replaced the swiss with parm just because I had it.
