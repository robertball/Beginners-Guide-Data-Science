Delish!!! I only had 2 small potatoes so I cut the filling in half but it was a great healthy potato that actually tasted good!!! The only change I made was using regular mustard cause thats all I had but it was still great! Thanks for the recipe :-)

This is the best recipe for twice baked! My family enjoyed them! It is hard to get them to eat baked potatoes but with this recipe I don't see me having that problem anymore

I also added chopped broccoli and did not use paprika.  These were VERY good.  Next time I will season and oil the skins so they taste better.

Made these twice baked potatoes and they turned out well. I used a 2% milk Mexican blend, omitted the onion slices added some garlic and added some chives for extra flavor. Overall this was a nice tasting low fat side dish.
