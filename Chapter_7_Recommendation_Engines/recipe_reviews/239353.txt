These cookies were OK, not the best I've had.  The recipe only yielded 30 medium-sized cookies for me.  Perhaps if I had used a different granola the results would have been better.  I make my own granola and made a fresh batch before making these cookies so they were soft and chewy instead of crunchy.  The baking time was perfect and the sweetness was just right but they were a bit heavy and dense.  I prefer a lighter cookie.

Crunchy & awesomely easy to make.  These are the type of cookies my family will eat, as no one likes the moist ones that fall apart.  Delicious, flavorful & crunchy ....cannot imagine anyone not loving these cookies.  Please try...they are foolproof, crunchy & delicious!!!

Theses cookies are so easy to make. Family love them. I also added some gluten free granola for different contrast.

I made these using Bare Naked Blueberry Lemon Cheesecake Granola, only 2 cups. Otherwise, i followed directions exactly.
The cookies did not flatten out and were more cakey then I thought. But very good.

mines turned out  like biscuits, i followed the recipe to the tee. probably my granola was too rock like, i should have  smashed them down. my kids still ate them. they tasted fine. i needed a recipe to use all the granola I got from the 99c store. lol.
