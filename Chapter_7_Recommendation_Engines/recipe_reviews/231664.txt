LOVED this recipe.  I reduced this to 4 servings and added just a bit of freshly minced ginger to the marinade - absolutely stunning.  The skewers were inhaled!  I used Top Sirloin - partially frozen - and sliced it thin with my meat slicer for nice even, thin slices.  This would be good stir fried as well.  Put this on the regular rotation.   Oh, I forgot to mention I did use the optional pineapple juice - a bit more than called for and used no water as well as low sodium soy sauce.   Perfection!

This marinade is delicious! I did everything I could to mess this recipe up and it still turned out great. I only was able to marinate for 5 hours instead of 24 because I did not plan ahead well. It also started raining so I was not able to grill. What I did instead was cook the meat with the marinade in a skillet on the stove. I browned on med. high and then turned down to simmer until tender. I removed the meat from the pan and then added onion and bell pepper slices to serve as a side dish. I also made pineapple rice II to go with this. The meat was very flavorful and I can only imagine it will be even better when I marinate as long as stated and grill as intended. Thank you so much! This will be worked into the regular rotation.

I would give more stars if I could.  The marinade for this is to die for.  I made this for my mom and she went crazy for it.  We did not have pineapple juice, so I omited that.  I put partly cooked bell peppers and onions in the marinade the last hour, then alternated the veggies and meat with fresh mushrooms.  I will make this again and again as will she.  Count us in for the fan club.

I would add a tsp fresh grated ginger then one very important step - cook the sauce over medium heat to blend all the ingredients, stir until sugar is disolved, cool to room temperature before adding meat of your choice. This makes a terrific recipe outstanding!

Delicious! I used cube steak cut into strips. The kids literally gobbled it up. Going to try the marinade on chicken tonight and see how that goes. Thanks for sharing such a simple but yummy recipe.

Adding this as a go to marinade. I didn't have the 24 hours either, but I had a good grade of steak and marinated for 3 hours. halved the recipe and used it as a stir fry. It was awesome, can't wait to put it on the skewers. Thanks for sharing.

I made it as listed, just cutting the recipe in half.  It was so good, I wish I would have doubled it!  Made an inexpensive cut of meat yummy and tender!

This is a very flavorful marinade.  I only wish I had used flat iron steak instead of round steak, but it was still very good.

Great recipe!  I added a touch of sesame oil and finely chopped green onions into the marinade for added flavor.  Don't forget to soak your wood skewers before using them.

Taste was really good. Tasted like it came from Japanese restaurant.  I did not add the pineapple juice, but I will next time.  I cooked mine in broiler and they were overdone at 4 minutes a side. Next time I will cook for less time (maybe 2.5 mins a side) since I think these are meant to be eaten less than well done.

this was delicious! My picky eater son loved it. I kept burning it when i tried grilling it, so i put it in the oven on broil at 475 for  8 minutes each side and it came out perfect! I also only had half a cup of soy when i made it.

This marinade is excellent. I used it to marinate London Broil that I served with Fried Rice I and Wow! Sweet and Sour Sauce. A delicious inexpensive dinner!

I made these exactly as written (included the pineapple juice), and let them marinate for a full 24 hours.  I was worried that they would be tough, but NOPE they were melt-in-your-mouth good!  I skewered them with red onion, peppers, and mushrooms which were a great accompaniment. I'll be making them again for sure!

The marinade is similar to the one I use for my chicken satay.   I used this recipe and the idea to make it with both chicken & steak.   Family loved the variety!  This marinade was great.  I served it with rice and my spicy Thai peanut sauce for dipping.

2nd time making it. It is so flavorful, definitely think the 24 hours helps. I make 1/4 the recipe because 4 lbs is jus too much for 2 adults. Also I just drizzle olive oil In the bag because you end up throwing it away anyway. I make it along with grilled peppers and onion on the skewer just not marinated. It is fantastic. I think it might be better with sirloin steak or a more tender cut of meat. It is still good though.

this recipe is absolutely amazing! i made a couple of minor changes first i cooked the steak in a pan to get a Carmel glaze,  i used the left over marinade and made a reduction sauce out of it, once the steak was almost done i tossed in some green beans and saute until they had a glaze on them as well, then i served it all on white rice. truly the best asian food ever! especially being made by me! :)

Made this tonight. Lovely subtle pineapple flavour. I did, as another reviewer suggested, use all pineapple juice and no water. I also halved recipe to serve 4. I cooked these in the oven on the 'grill' setting. We gave this a 10. Would gladly have this again. Thanks for a nice recipe.

This is the BEST recipe for beef ever! It’s like meat candy on a stick! I followed the recipe to a “T” except added fresh minced ginger and some ground black pepper. I bought already thinly sliced "fajita" meat at the store and marinated for almost 24 hours. There was none left over.

This was very good - sweet, but not sickening.  I would definitely make this again.  I stuck my meat in the freezer for half and hour before slicing it - doing so makes cutting thin slices so much easier!

These were great. Another review recommended adding ginger to the marinade and I will do that next time.  We did divide the meat into two batches. The first batch marinated in the fridge for 24 hours. The second marinated in the fridge overnight and then spent 6 hours in the Sous Vide.  Both were amazingly tender but we liked the batch in the Sous Vide more. Cooked them at 130 degrees and then seared them in a very hot pan. Yum!!!

I never made meat on skewers before so I was skeptical. I marinated the beef for the full 24 hours. I also added grated ginger to the marinade just as other reviewers suggested. Based on the reviews, I tripled the recipe & sautéed bell pepper, mushroom and onion all separately using a combination of butter, Olive oil, pineapple juice & Shar sauce

This recipe is really an excellent one and hard to improve upon, but a couple things I did might have added a bit more flavor. First, I used flank steak as the cut of meat. When I made the marinade, I added about a teaspoon of ginger to it and used the low-salt soy sauce. I was not able  to marinate for 24 hours, and only did so for about 8 hours. I marinated the sliced beef, put it on skewers and then brought the remaining marinade to a boil on the stove in a pot. When it got to a boil, I thickened it with 1 T of cornstarch in 2 T of water. I stirred while adding the cornstarch and water, over medium heat until thick. I then poured the warm sauce over the beef skewers before grilling. Came out great!

I didn't have pineapple juice, and I already had a New York strip so I used it, Marinated it for 3 hours as an appetizer for 6 adults (about 8 Skewers). They were phenominal.  Even some of the small kids ate them

It was incredible!  I included several ingredients on the skewers:  apple chunks,  pineapple   chunks,  sauteed yellow, orange & green bell pepper, onion chunks.  The saute was a combination of butter, pineapple juice, fresh ground ginger, raw sugar,  and Mrs. Dash.   They were added as I went along,  so the amounts were some of each, but not too much.   Eat well!

Simply scrumptious. Sweet tender. I make it with different cuts of meat and prefer it without the pineapple juice.

Delicious!  Halved recipe, but made as directed.  Reduced marinade (I know, some people do it ... some people don't) which was wonderful when spooned over Jasmine rice.  Will def make again.  Thanks so much!

I love how easy this recipe is. I reduced the serving size cause I was just making it for myself and I cut the steak into strips because I didn't have any skewers. And it marinated for an extra day because I didn't have time to cook the day I wanted to. Still it turned out great and I will definitely use this in the future.

Didn't make any changes except to use low sodium soy sauce.  Loved it, and it will be our go-to marinade from now on.  It ended up marinating for 2 days, after we realized we had other plans for the next night.

muah... the pineapple juice in the recipe excited me, but it just tasted like a salt soaked soy beef bath, eith a hint of garlic.  I used tenderloin and a tsp of ginger.

My family went crazy for this recipe! I used the pineapple juice and really think it made the recipe! It had a nice caramelization.  The only change I made in the recipe is that I used flat iron steak instead.  So tender!

I made it last night and it was pretty good. I made a serving of 6. There are substitutes for soy sauce but I do not recommend them. I used 3T worchesire + 1T water for the soy sauce but it would’ve been MUCH better with soy sauce. Next time I will use soy sauce and real pineapple justice instead of canned.

These steak skewers are delicious and really easy to make. Marinading for 24 hours takes some patience and advance prep. I only waited 10 hours because I got hungry and everything still came out amazing. I used sirloin instead of round steak.  Next time I will let the meat marinade for longer and see how much better the results are... I'm expecting an even better dinner.

This was divine. I have made many teriyaki marinades and haven’t loved any of them nearly as much as this one. I only used 1 cup of brown sugar because I used the pineapple juice. Also added about 1 tsp ground ginger. Used a flank cut steak as well. Marinaded it approximately 7 hrs. It was so wonderful!!! A tru 5 Star recipe!

Of course a few changes; used sirloin, used all pineapple juice without water, and added fresh grated ginger. Melt in your mouth. BUT, served as a main entree for 4 of us and there were 0 leftovers!

Excellent.  We marinated tenderloins (8 hours) and grilled kabobs with green and red peppers, fresh mushrooms, fresh pineapple, fresh tomatoes, and red onion.  My wife could not get enough.

Next we will use it to marinate Ribeyes !!!

The only thing I changed was I halved the sugar. This recipe was amazing. Made it before camping, marinated for 24 hours and then it was quick and easy to skewer while camping, hubby threw them on a grill on the campfire!!! Quick, easy, yet fancy and delicious camping food!!

Wonderful marinade. Made as written, except I used all pineapple juice, no water. Next time I’ll use a better cut of meat than the round steak. It proved to still be a little tough after cooking over a lower heat to a medium consistency. The flavor however was out of this world.  I may try it with chicken too.

I did as suggested by heating briefly to combine. I didn’t get my marinade going in time! I only had marinated it 14 hours.... but was still delicious- yes, the meat could have been more tender... but everyone thought it delicious! Definitely will make again!

I made these for a family of 12,  and it was a huge success! I did add some grated ginger,  but otherwise followed the directions exactly.  The only problem was that there wasn't enough to go around (which says a lot for the recipe!) even though I changed the serving number to 12.  I served the Asian Coconut Rice alongside the skewers,  and it was exceptional as well!

I made the marinade exactly like the recipe said to and it turned out pretty good. The top round that we had was a little tough but the marinade was wonderful. Round steak is just a tough cut of meat unless slow cooked but I'd make this again according to the recipe but use a better cut of beef.

I made this dish using bottom round roast beef made into3/4 “ cubes . It tasted good but the beef was a little tough. Not sure what type of cut to use.

My guests raved and all asked for the recipe! I added fresh grated ginger and way more fresh garlic at least 5 more cloves. Top sirloin was also used rather than what was called for. 
I was serving 6 people and had tons left over so this amount is for an army . I would say this makes an appetizer for 15 or meal for 12 people. The skewers I used we’re smaller about  8 inches. Relish and so tender.

For some reason I found this really bland. I had to add some serious ginger, garlic, sesame oil, citrus and spice to make this something my family would like. Oh and spring onions. Can't have a good marinade without them. We always cook the meat first then immediately put it into the marinade. As the meat cools and the juices settle in the center it draws up so much more flavor than simply marinating raw meat.

Loved this one and the 2 and 4 yo loved it too. Went nicely with simple edamame for an easy summer dinner. This time I even soaked the skewers for a good long time and used apple sticks. Those were shorter and not so hard to manage.

Followed recipe to the letter, was a huge hit, have been told this needs to go on my regular grilling menu. Excellent flavor, wasn’t overly sweet as some have described. Thinking of trying this marinade on pork and chicken as well.

I have used a receipt very close to this that used beer instead of pineapple juice.  As I had some deer out to cook I decided to beat it out and try the receipt with pineapple instead of beer.  Marinated for about three hours.  Spread meat out in a flat basket that I use for fish and grilled it.  Every body at my house was amazed, the deer was tender and the taste was great.  Will be using it many time more. Thanks

This marinade was fabulous!!  I used top sirloin steak because that is what my store had available and it was fantastic. I made these into kabobs with veggies such as mushrooms, bell peppers and onion.  I brushed a light coating of the marinade on the veggies before bbq'ing as well and it was perfect, I wouldn't change anything at all!!  Thank you for sharing this recipe, I will be making this many more times!

This recipe turned out great.  Key was to add chopped ginger to the marinade to add a little more flavor.  Used some thinly sliced eye round and grilled the round flat pieces without skewers.  Quick and easy on gas grill.  Also made second batch of marinade thickened with corn starch for putting over the meat.  Loved it ladled over rice as well plus have extra for future to have over grilled chicken.

Yep, I would have taken a picture, but I tried it quick before serving the first time. We ate it before I thought of a picture. Great recipe! I also added a little ground ginger to the marinade. Definitely will make again!

This marinade was fantastic. I actually used a store bought teriyaki marinade, added a 1/2 cup pineapple juice, a cup or so of brown sugar, a 1/4 c of oil, 2 tbls of garlic and a pinch of cayenne pepper. Next time, I think that I will add more because it wasn't quite enough 'heat'. I used beef cubes and due to time constraints, could only marinate for only 6 hours. This was a great tasting marinade that I will use again; my family loved it.

This was absolutely delicious!!!! Didn’t change a thing in the recipe except using the wrong part of the cow and it was great as is. I had to use the oven as I don’t have a grill so I didn’t get that grilled burn but was divine regardless. I will try this with chicken next. Hubby who doesn’t like beef enjoyed it! Thanks

Rated it 4* as is, 5* with the changes I made. Added fresh ginger and garlic, a couple of Thai chili peppers, some mashed Papaya, omit the water and use additional pineapple juice and spiced rum to make up the volume. Don't skip the juice; the acid from it, and the enzymes from the Papaya and the alcohol from the rum tenderize the beef as well as imparting taste.

Yum!  A bit too sweet. Next time I’ll cut back on the brown sugar. I also aged ginger and red wine.   But very delicious.

Used the recipe as a marinade for beef and pork. Made the end result a little more Filipino style by basting with 'Banana Sauce', a little oil, brown sugar and leftover marinade (cooked down).

These were excellent. The meat was juicy, tender, and interestingly-flavored. We used the pineapple juice and kept the marinading time low as consequence, maybe 3 hours. Served them with an Asian pea salad over rice. We will lighting up the grill a lot this summer for these!

Delicious. Made as instructed, including the pineapple juice, but with a cheap sirloin that was on sale. Marinating for 24 hours helped tenderize the meat. I cooked under the broiler & these skewers were reminiscent of Chinese beef teriyaki & delicious. Served with allrecipes' "Fried Rice Restaurant Style" that I made using brown rice. Update: I made this using siroin steak tip meat & cooked on the grill. I marinated for 36 hours. This version was super sweet & I did not like these as much as using the cheaper cut of meat.

Made this tonight and it was a hit. Hubs said to serve it every week, so you know its a winner. I used it for a beef stir fry, adding lots of veggies and served over rice. Didn't use pineapple juice cause I didn't have any, and threw in just a dash of ground ginger, marinated about seven hours.  Tons of flavor. Next time I'll adjust the serving size to match the amount of meat I'm cooking and use pineapple juice. But this one is a keeper!!

This is a perfect blend of acid, sweet and salt teriyaki marinade!  Meat was tender and well seasoned.  I marinated it for 16 hours and was still perfect!

Delicious! Instead of skewers I just put the marinade on steaks and grilled em up. Due to short planning then only marinated for about 6 hours but they were still delicious.

Did not care for the sweetness of this recipe.  My family prefers the tartness of the vinegar based styles.  Fun to try something new but this is not a keeper.

Made this for dinner for the first time. Used orange juice instead of pineapple, and used flank steak,but followed the recipe otherwise. Grilled the skewers.OMG! This was so delicious! My husband said this would be great in a sandwich as well. Will be making this often. YUM!!

Oh my this is delicious. I will definitely make again. I like others didn't plan ahead so I could only marinate for 6 hours. I didn't have any pineapple juice on hand so I omitted it. Also when make the marinate I realized that I didn't have have enough soy sauce. I did have teriyaki sauce so I threw some in to make up the difference.

Tried this a couple of times.  First time with sherry wine (as suggested) & the second using the pineapple. Think we'll keep the sherry wine method. Meat was very tender.

I've never left a review before but this recipe is great. I was unsure because of the simplicity but it turned out great. I only marinated for about 6 hours, used olive oil instead of regular and omitted the water. Oh and I used pineapple orange juice. Was great!

I had a piece of filet Mignon to use up, and only had 4 hours until dinner.  I made the recipe as shown, minus the pineapple juice, as I had none.  I marinaded the meat for about 4 hours, then stir fried the meat in a frying pan, with a bunch of veggies in another frying pan.  I added the veggies to the meat, thickened with Tapioka Starch, and we had a fabulous stir fry.  My husband loved it and he is one picky dude!
