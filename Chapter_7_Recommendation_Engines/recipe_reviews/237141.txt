Sorry, we did not like it very much.  Made without the beans and followed the rest.

As described, this is by no means chef cooking or culinary award winning. This is down home, using what you have, (bacon could sub) cooking. if you follow the cook on YouTube he mentioned she was a depression Era cook and honestly I made this exactly as is and it was good! As expected this doesn't hold up well because the penne gets soggy but you could always cook half the pasta add in and the other half separate and add in as you microwave or reheat! Good, simple and cheap for the servings!

Followed the recipe with no changes. (which is the only way to truly rate a recipe)   Was not a fan of the end result.  Fairly bland flavor and I'm usually a fan of Chef John's recipes

I didn't like the pink colour in the picture so I omitted the tomato paste.  I didn't have white beans so I used black beans and it turned out great.  The pasta was perfectly al dente and I will try using a combination of white wine and broth the next time I make it.  I would also substitute either rapini or fresh spinach for the peas.  I like a recipe where I usually have the ingredients on hand.

We loved it and I will definitely make it again.  I ended up cooking it a bit longer and I put in a bit more garlic, but we love garlic and I usually add more than recipes specify.

I adapted this for Good Friday, substituted shrimp for prosciutto. Also, used 1/3 white wine and 2/3 chicken broth. Fresh peas. And BBQ shrimp spice instead of thyme. Added extra garlic. We liked it!

Very delicious and easy recipe. Very similar to pasta dishes I grew up with in my Neapolitan family. I made it very close,to the recipe, I just added some fresh basil. I was able to feed my husband, son daughter-in -law and grandson and still had left overs.

This recipe came out very good. I just switched out the white beans with 1/2" white cubed potatoes. It came out more like a soup which was perfect.

Good, but not amazing.  It's a great meal to make for a one-dish dinner that doesn't take all that long and is kid friendly.  Only used two pinches of salt as there was plenty already in the prosciutto and tomato sauce.  Also left out the red pepper flakes.  Made a lot, enough for future leftovers.

The pasta was mushy and so were the peas. Also way to salty for my taste.
Won't make this again.

Made this dish exactly according to the recipe.  IMHO it's absolutely delicious.  I had to simmer it about twice as long after adding the pasta in order for the penne to be done,  and after that I left it about 15 minutes on low heat for the liquid to be absorbed, but other than that, a relatively easy dish to prepare.  And you gotta have the red pepper flakes in there, I don't think it would work nearly as well without that little bit of heat.

I don't know why this hasn't received more positive reviews; it is a very good nightly supper and very easy to make. I added more garlic since WE LOVE GARLIC but, other than that followed the recipe. We may reduce the amount chicken broth and increase the amount of prosciutto next time as an experiment but the recipe as is, is VERY GOOD! Thank you Chef John for a simple/nutritious recipe that we will make again and again.
