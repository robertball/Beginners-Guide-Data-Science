A good cake that's not overly sweet. I did make my batter a little differently though. Milk instead of water, baking powder in lieu of soda, two eggs, vanilla extract and more apples. I placed my sugar, cinnamon and butter mixture into a sauce pan and stirring constantly, I brought it to a boil. I then proceeded with the rest of the recipe. This cake is not only yummy for dessert, but it also makes a nice breakfast. Thanks Glenda!

I would give this a 5 star rating except I had the same problem with it that my fellow bakers had....It was not done after specified time. I baked mine for 50 minutes and it turned out perfect. I really needed this cake to turn out good because I made another apple cake off of this site and it was horrid. So that was my husbands first impression of apple cake. once this was ready to eat he loved it, I loved it. I have made this twice. Just make sure you let it cool long enough before turning it over or the apples will stick to the bottom of the pan. Other than the cook time this was a fabulous recipe.

This apple recipe was quite good. I thought it would taste more caramel-like, but I thought it taste more like apple pie. I left out the pecans, since I'm not a fan of nuts. I would make it again. My dinner company enjoyed it.

The first time I made it, it did not cook all the way through (insert a knife in the center and it will come out clean when done), so I baked for extra 15 minutes and was fine...not caramel enough for me tho...  Next time I made it, I added 1/4 cup of maple syrup to the brown sugar, cinnamon, butter topping layer.  Also, added apple slices to the bottom (top while cooking) layer and extra nuts.  Next time, I will try an applesauce layer to the center to make a little more applely...

My family loved this!  Even my 3 1/2 year old who has refused every cake, brownie, and cupcake offered to him in his life ate a piece.  I did follow the suggestions of others and used milk instead of water, 2 eggs, 1/2 tsp vanilla, and chopped apples to the batter.  I wasn't sure how much brown sugar to use (if the 1 1/3 cup the recipe called for was 1/3 cup for the topping and 1 cup for the batter or if it all went into the batter) because the butter was not a combined measurement, but the cinnamon was.  I used 1/3 cup for the topping and 1 1/3 for the cake.  It turned out wonderfully!

This is very good, but needs more "goop" on top. Next time I'll use more brown sugar and butter. I used Granny Smith apples but I will use a different kind next because Grannies are not juicy or sweet enough. Also, I added an egg to the batter. I used a lot more pecan halves on the top and didn't add any to the cake itself. This is so good with vanilla ice cream! I had to bake it much longer than 30 minutes to get the middle done.

this was a really good concept, unfortunately, i had a couple of issues, all of my caramel cooked up and out of the cake pan (be sure to put another pan under the cake pan or you will have a mess) and the cake batter seemed more like dough than batter.  very good, though, as far as taste goes.  i put diced apples and walnuts in the cake as well, and cooked the caramel on the stove.  i'll do more tinkering with this recipe, as i think it has a lot of potential.

Very good, I followed some of the other recommendations, used milk instead of water, added 2 eggs, 1 tsp. vanilla and nutmeg in both the caramel and the batter. I also used about 5 total apples and did the whole thing in a 10 inch cast iron pan. Cooked 40 minutes in the oven and it was perfect! Definitely put a cookie sheet under your pan to catch the drips. Yum yum!

Amazing. As some others did I added an egg.  Next time I am going to add a little vanilla also. I did not have pecans, however I used walnuts and they were great!  I baked at 350 for apprx 50 minutes.

This recipe was quite tasty though I did have to cook it for a bit longer as the middle was mushy after the called for time. I liked it and everyone else I served it to seemed to like it as well.

Very good cake -- sweet, rich, and filling.  I baked mine for 30 minutes in a metal pan and then inverted it after 10 minutes.  The cake was obviously not done because the gooey batter was visible through the apple slices.  After putting it back in the baking pan, I baked it for another 15 minutes.  This time, it was done.  Used pecan pieces rather than halves because that was all I had.  Definitely need to use Granny Smith applies to offset the sweetness of the brown sugar topping.

I read the reviews and added an egg,  plus added 15mins to the baking time as I used a ring pan. Turned out great. Oh, i used freshly squeezed orange juice in place of water just coz i wanted to use up some oranges.

Found this cake a little too salty.  I also had to cook it for longer than the recipe calls for. Otherwise, it was OK.

This recipe is very yummy! I have a prolific Gravenstein apple tree, and am always trying out new recipes to use the apples.  I mixed the topping with an electric mixer, which made mixing a snap! It came out the consistency of frosting, and pre-cooked nibbles were delicious. I rounded up the topping (or bottoming?) to use up the odd tablespoon of butter.  So, instead of 3T, I used 4T (or 1/4 cup) and rounded the brown sugar to 1/2 cup.  I didn't check the size of my pan and accidentally used an 8" pan.  It was a disaster, but my fault.  I will try it again soon with the right size pan! This would be an excellent brunch type cake.

Wow, this cake was absolutely fantastic!  I made it as directed.  I did try adding a lay of oats to the butter, sugar, cinnamon mix at the bottom to give it a "crisp" texture.  I didn't add enough, will try more next time.  I also was out of nuts which I love.  With the nuts this cake would be perfect!  My 17 year old son love it too. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

I followed the modified version of this recipe by adding the milk instead of the water and it was very good! I also added more apples in there as that accentuates the flavour.

this recipe sounded delicious. When I turned the cake upside down, all the gooey stuff stuck to the pan. Worse yet, I baked it longer that what it called for and when I went to cut the cake, the entire middle was still liquid. I could only use the outer perimeter of the cake. What a waste of ingredients. This cake calls for no eggs. That may be the problem.

The first time, I made it with water as the recipe said. The batter was extremely dry and hard to spread over the apple slices. The taste was great, which is why I tried again. This time I used buttermilk, one and a half cups, and it was perfect. Consistency and amount of the batter just right!

I found the recipe to be very easy and MMMMM Good...  I also took the advice of another reviewer and used milk instead of water and added egg and vanilla. And I used walnuts instead of peacans.  This was very good.   Thank you Glenda
