Try placing the potatoes in the refrigerator for an hour or two after they have been shaped into logs or balls. They will firm up and be much easier to handle when breading.(I used cornflake crumbs instead of breadcrumbs)Great way to use left over mashed potatoes.

I used cooked, cold potatoes and had no problem with them keeping their shape. I also added about 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese and cooked in bacon drippings instead of oil. Yummy.

I really loved the idea of these, but, as written, they would not hold their shape. I ended up adding in some parmesan cheese and a little flour to keep them together. They were still soft to handle, but once I got them in the oil they fried up nicely. Also, these could definitely use some salt, IMO.  All in all these would work with a few small additions. Thanks for sharing. :)
