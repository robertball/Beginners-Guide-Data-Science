This recipe is the best ever! I was searching and searching for the healthy and delicious baked goods and the idea of moist banana muffin yet entirely whole wheat flour muffin was very tempting. It was very moist. I added organic chia seeds to the flour mixture, and used 1/2 cup of unpasturized honey and 1/2 organic cane sugar instead of white and brown sugar for the topping. I also added organic walnuts on the top. It came out beautifully. Thank you so much for inventing this recipe!!!!!

Very good.  I didn't do the streusal topping--I'd run out of steam by then, so just topped with a sprinkle each of cinnamon and brown sugar.  Hubs and niece really enjoyed them; niece says 4 1/2 stars.  Hubs says he'd like more banana flavor--but it was good as is, and he says he always would like more banana flavor.  I don't have a flour sifter, so just put the wheat flour in the KA for a while and ran it--wasn't sure it'd work, but it did.  Muffins came out moist and not at all dense.  Thanks for the recipe!

Just took these muffins out of the oven- they are delicious warm with a cold glass of milk. I don't usually like to make changes to recipes when I review them, but I didn't do the topping because I ran out of butter so I added some chocolate chips to the batter.

Great whole wheat alternative to the popular "Banana Crumb Muffins" recipe. Made these muffins several times, store them in the freezer, and they are great!

I was looking for a use for my over-ripe bananas and I only have whole wheat flour. I made these exactly according to the recipe. They were so easy and very delicious. I would highly recommend.

My kiddo said it might be the best muffin he has ever eaten- and he has eaten a few! Wonderful wonderful muffins using freshly ground whole wheat flour. Used oil instead of butter and made 12 muffins.

Loved it!! Best muffins I've ever made. Skipped the streusal bit because I thought it would be too sweet (was naughty and added some apple sauce). Was great warm but got even more moist when cool!

Go figure, I forgot butter when I went shopping, so I subbed some yogurt. The muffins did turn out good enough to make me go back for seconds. They were very moist.

Delicious!  I added 1/4 c apple cinnamon applesauce, 1/2 c semi sweet chic chips, and cut back on the sugar and butter.  I also used 4 medium bananas instead of 3.  My family loved them!

These were GREAT! Since the recipe called for whole wheat (and that is all I had-no white flour), I wondered if they would be dry or too dense, but they were delightfully moist and not heavy at all. This recipe is a keeper!Thank you.

These muffins are delicious and very light! I followed the recipe exactly, even the sifting and gentle folding in the liquids. I just didnt do the topping since I made them for quick grab & go snacks for the work week. The muffins are still great without the streusel. Perfect with my hot tea. Thank you for sharing!

Moist, tasty and easy is the trifecta. Will make again and again. 
Tiny change: I added 2 tsp. Old Fashioned Oats to the topping just for eye appeal. 
I baked them in large muffin top pans. Yield: 8 muffin tops. That changed my food tome to 15 minutes in my convection oven.

These were the best banana muffins I have EVER eaten !  My hubby agrees.   I made minor changes:  I used white whole wheat flour (King Arthur) and Splenda Brown sugar replacement equal to 1/2 cup sugar.
I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup cinnamon applesauce rather than all butter.
I also did not use the streusel topping, but sprinkled the raw muffins with some cinnamon sugar.  They were perfectly done at 18 minutes.
Thanks so much for sharing your recipe !  I'll never make any other.

I am always looking for recipes that are healthy, flavorful and not fussy. This is one of those recipes. Next time, I will use an extra banana to produce a bit more moistness, but it works, as is.

I doubled the recipe as I had 6 bananas ripened...I spiced-up the recipe with cinnamon,  hint of ground clove (1/8 t. ea) and nutmeg and made a cinnamon roll-type icing of 2T. milk and a t. of vinegar and confectioner's (powdered 10-X) sugar which came out a little goopy...and added a dash of the 3 spices I used in the mix and a couple extra dashes of cinnamon...then I added softened butter and brown sugar until all that made an icing---I iced the WARM muffins ant they were uniquely delicious and did not make a crumbly mess in the office kitchenette... 2nd batch by popular request with the office friends... glad I doubled the recipe...

The first  time I made this I thought the recipe didn't sound like it would make enough streusel topping so I doubled it.  This was too generous and made the topping too sweet.  The second time I made the topping with 50% more of the ingredients and though this was sweet also, I decided that is the way to go and did it that way the third time, too.  This is a great way to use up the over ripe bananas I've been keeping in the freezer.  This does make 12 muffins in my tins.

Really great healthier option for banana muffins.  I used applesauce for half the butter and reduced the amount of sugar a little.  My son who refuses to eat whole wheat bread had 3!

I loved the result! Was looking for a whole wheat banana muffin recipe as that is the flour I had. I have no idea what the original recipe is like, as I made some modifications: substituted 1 cup yogurt for the butter and the egg, and also subbed 1/3 cup molasses for the white sugar, and used 4 bananas. The result was a not too sweet but very moist muffin. I will definitely make this again.

Excellent recipe! Super moist. I didn't have bananas, so instead I used three peaches and replaced the cinnamon in the batter with ground ginger. (Peaches were pretty firm, ripe but not juicy.) Threw the wet stuff in the food processor and pulsed. Will definitely be making these again!
