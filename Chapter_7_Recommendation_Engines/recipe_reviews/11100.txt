Beware! The measurements in this recipe are incorrect. When I was making it for a church social I should have listened to my brain. I'm not a novice in the kitchen, but I followed the recipe exactly even though my gut told me to add 1/2 cup more graham cracker crumbs because it didn't look like enough to cover the bottom of the pan. It wasn't. Also 2 cups of each kind of chips is too much. Use one cup of each. Crust was too thin and I wasted the extra chips. This is a rich recipe anyway and the extras add extra fat and calories.

This is pretty much the standard recipe.  Agree with the other review that said that the crust was too thin.  Double the graham cracker crumbs.  I also put less chips than called for and prefer walnuts.  This is a rich dessert but always goes fast.  Chocolate lovers will enjoy.

i have been making these for over 20 years and are always a hit for what ever occasion they are made for. recently i made them for a picnic and used mini M&M's in place of the nuts because of nut allergies. these are so versitile as you can change the chip flavors or the type of nut to fit the occasion. i make a variation using just the chocolate chips,pecans and coconut for a german chocoalte flare. the only thing i do different than the recipe states is using a small cookie sheet instead of a 9x13 pan because i like them to be a litte thinner and crisper instead of thick and gooey, but it is just a matter of taste. no matter what ingredients or size of pan you use, they will always be a hit and never any leftover.

This is a very yummy recipe with only one alteration I can find.  The crust is not enough for the size pan the recipe calls for and is very greasy.  I added another 1/2 cup of crumbs and no more butter and it was enough to cover the pan and be less greasy.  Other than that these are great bars!

Really tasty, but I made a couple of modifications.  I used 1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs which I mixed with the butter and pressed into the pan.  I used peanut butter chips instead of butterscotch and probably used only 1 1/2 cups of each of the chips.  Next time I'll probably pour the milk on the crust first, then sprinkle the chips on top and press down.  Regardless, the bars were rich and yummy!

My mom used to make these all the time when I was a child.  I LOVE THEM!  I unfortuately live in a country where they don't have graham crackers, imagine that!!!  Anyway, I winged it a bit.  I use some coconut cookies  crushed with butter for the crust, then omit the peanuts and use the chips as described, they turned out great.  A treat my kids and hubby love!  The coconut cookies actually added a very nice touch.

Very yummy! However, I did double the amount of butter and graham crackers and reduced the amount of chips in the recipe, according to other reviewers.
These are always a hit at parties!
Thanks!

I added Heath toffee chips (about 1 cup) as the layer before the peanuts. Also, you must use salted party nuts because they are sort greasy and taste great when they are cooked!

YUMMMMMMY!!! Whenever i go anywhere I have to get one of these if they sell them!! I wanted to make something sweet that i knew no one else would make for this sunday's dinner. I havent ever made anything before for sunday dinner but now  i am pregnant and my Hubby's family are unsure of my domestic skills. they are from the Country in North carolina.  I am from LA and i have tattoo's and black hair. We have tried to tell them that i am a good homemaker. But i understand if his ALPHA MOM has to see it to beleive it. I think these bars should do the trick!! They taste just like the one's in the coffee shop!! i think i will double the gram crust next time though. just to make them thicker and extra decadent!!

Great bars-however, I think cooking time was too long. Mine got really hard on the ends.  I suggested cooking 20 minutes.  I used  less than half a cup of the chips and a little less cococunt and 1 1/2 cups of graham crakers.  I also used toffee chips and rice crispies for an extra fun texture!

I took these to "Granny's" for our annual Mother's Day family lunch, and everyone liked them. I replaced the semisweet chips with white chips and doubled the graham crackers. I think I should have perhaps used 3/4 cup of butter instead of only 1/2 cup when I double the graham crackers. My daughter turned the oven off after I put them in the oven, and in the end, I ended up baking them too long, so they were really, really hard to cut, but that was my fault. The taste was fabulous. Kids and adults all liked them very much. I won't be making these often, however, since it comes out to around $10 to make a 9x13 pan of them. I gave them 4 stars because they are very messy to eat, but they're worth making again.

I like other reviewers doubled the graham crackers, should have reduced the amount of choc chips and butterscotch chips as well but didn't since I like them so much.  Will reduce next time.  I would also reduce time of baking, probably 15-20 minutes would have been better they turned out hard and also make sure that the sweetened condensed milk doesnt touch sides of pans or else it makes the bars really hard to get out.  I used to love these as a kid my mom made them all the time very easy.  Will try again with the additional changes.

Use the 'Seven Layer Bars' recipe for correct measurements.  I like that it has walnuts instead of peanuts too (although I used pecans this time!).

This recipes was pretty good except, for a couple of problems. One as many others have said add more graham cracker crumbs, I used about two cups and it still wasn't enough. I used a little less than four cups of chips total. The bars are good when they come out but they were even BETTER when left in the refrigerator for a few hours. Very good bars!

GREAT IDEA BUT WAY TOO RICH. USE HALF THE CHOCOLATE CHIPS AND BUTTERSCOTCH AND DOUBLE THE GRAHAM CRACKERS, THEN IT IS A WINNER.

I didn't exactly follow this recipe. I just "eyed" everything. I used choc. chips, peanut butter chips, walnuts, marshmallows, and coconut and it turned out fabulously! But I ended up covering it with foil for the last 5 minutes so the marshmallows didn't burn. But wow... Mmmmmm!

The proportions are wrong in this recipe.  I needed about 3x as many graham cracker crumbs as the recipe called for and it didn't turn out as it should have.  USE ANOTHER RECIPE--there are plenty versions of this one out there.

Loved this simple and easy 7 layer bar.  It was pretty rich, but if you use less condensed milk and less chips, it isn't as sweet and rich.  Will definitely make this one again for the next holiday treats I give away.

This is an easy recipe. One change I made was to pour sweetened condensed milk over all ingredients in pan. Everyone always loves these.

This recipe is always a big hit at parties.  Even
adult parties.  They are so easy to make and so 
delicious.  I leave out the peanuts when I made them.
