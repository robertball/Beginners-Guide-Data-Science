This was a nice recipe. I used skim milk instead of the half and half and less butter

Really nice, simple dish. I used 1% milk and   cut the butter in half just to make  it a little healthier. Everyone Loved it!

This turned out pretty good...a few changes would be to pound out chicken WAY thinner than 1". Also double the sauce!! LOL so good.

This was very good. I cut down the amount of butter to 4 tbsp (I was also cooking less than 6 breasts) and this came out really well. The sauce was great, and there was enough left over to dip our french fries in. I probably would have preferred a bit more seasoning, but all-in-all this was quite delicious and I will probably make it again soon.

Very Good! I used 2% milk in place of the half and half, and also added some salt (otherwise it's rather bland-tasting). My family loved this recipe so much it might become a weekly meal for us!

This was good. I served the sauce on the side as some in the group just don't care for it ontop.

This was very good. The whole family liked it (which is rare). I did use less butter and added black pepper to the sauce. I pounded the chicken thinner so it was easier to fold up. And cooked for less time because it was thinner. I will be making this again!

I reduced the ingredients and made only 2 chicken breasts.  I substituted Marsala wine for the lemon juice.  The recipe calls for cooking for approx 30 minutes.  I simmered for only 20 minutes and it came out a little dry.  I recommend checking for doneness with a thermometer  to prevent overcooking.  Was flavorful served over rice.  Would make again with same adjustments.

This was very good.  I made it exactly as written except that I used chardonnay because I did not have any lemons.  I served it on top of rice with a side of Brussels sprouts.  This is a keeper recipe.  Thank you MakeItHealthy.
