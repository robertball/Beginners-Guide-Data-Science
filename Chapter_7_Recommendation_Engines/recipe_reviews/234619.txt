After making a few changes, I loved this sauce! After I made it, it really tasted like peanut butter and it was too thick for a dipping sauce. So I added about 3 tablespoons of rice wine vinegar, a bit more ginger, one more tablespoon of soy sauce and some hot water to thin it out. Had it as a dipping sauce for some Vietnamese salad rolls! It was great.

This was exactly what I was looking for.  It was delicious!  I gave 4 stars because after making this according to directions, I felt it needed a bit of fish sauce.  After a healthy squirt it was a 5.

I'm giving this five stars although I didn't have any hoisin sauce and subbed some curry powder. Will use the hoisin next time. Was good eats.

Great sauce. Added a little more peanut butter as suggested by the recipe. Added a tsp of fish sauce and a tsp of sesame oil and substituted lime juice for the lemon for a more authentic flavor. Tastes like Cheesecake Factory peanut sauce. Yum!

I added a lot more peanut butter, because I wanted the flavor and also thought the sauce looked too thin. But it thickened up well and was delicious and quick!

Only change I did was use advocado oil instead of veg oil.  Its a keto thing.  Simmered some rabbit meat in it, put meat and some extra sauce over a salad with green onion & advocado.  Very good.

The flavor was spot on.  The only reason I deducted a star was because of the amount of water used.  I stirred all the ingredients prior to adding water and then slowly added water to get the consistency I desired.  I used approximately 1/4 cup instead of 3/4 cup.

I don't eat very spicy foods, and love peanut sauce. So I modified with just a dash of powdered ginger, and paprika, and the given amounts of garlic, lemon, hoisin, soy sauce. I added more peanut butter for my taste. No chili.  Loved it over grilled tofu.

Great sauce, but I didn’t and wouldn’t use water.  I don’t know why it doesn’t call for coconut milk, but I would strongly recommend that.  REPLACE WATER WITH COCONUT MILK!!!!!!

I made this like the recipe called for -- although I only had crunchy  peanut butter in my house.  I really , really like it.  I servied it with the Indonesia Pork Satay on allrecipes, I mixed it in rice,  I look forward to putting it on grilled chicken.   My son said to email the recipe to him.

This is fantastic!  Made it as directed to accompany our first stab at salad rolls and everyone loved it.  I considered making a double batch because we generally have to ask for more at a restaurant but it actually made so much that we're making salad rolls again this week.  It is a little spicy but we like it that way - you could always tone it down by leaving out the red pepper.

I was looking for a quick and easy peanut sauce and this delivered...with the help of other commenters (hence the 4 stars). I added a couple of splashes of fish sauce and a couple of squirts of Sriracha. Also, I used lime instead of lemon since that's what I had in the house.  Mixed it with baked tofu and shirataki noodles...delicious!

Best home-made peanut sauce recipe I've found. We didn't have chilli sauce so I used sriracha. Worked well.

We like to add Sriracha for a little (or a lot) kick. Make this somewhat frequently. Fairly easy and delicious

Can't say enough!  My husband said, "give it as many stars as you can!"  We both love!  I did add pepper flakes while heating to make it extra spicy.  Thank you for taking the time to post this recipe!

Very tangy.  Not really hot.  The rest if the flavors overpowered the peanut flavor.
