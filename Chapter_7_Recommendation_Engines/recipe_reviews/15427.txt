This was delicious with all the alterations offered by reviewers.  I made the following suggestions based upon all the reviews:
*cooked on rack to have crispy bottom
*added quartered potatoes (skin on) and baby carrots to the bottom of pan with some salt and pepper
*baked chicken at 350 degrees for about 2.5 hours
*really stuffed cavity full with rosemary, kosher salt, garlic cloves, lemon halves and onion quarters
*Rubbed outside with olive oil
*sprinkled outside with rosemary garlic, and fresh ground pepper
*dumped can of chicken stock in the pan with vegetables

Sounds like a lot of work, but I was able to get it into the oven in 15 minutes and wow did it smell incredible!  Served with some Chardonney and fresh tomatoes.  

Enjoy!  My kids and husband sure did.  I only wish I would have made an extra one at same time to have for salads, quesadillas, etc. this week.

I combined this recipe with another one from AllRecipes for lemon chicken.  I added the rosemary and onion, but then also rubbed the bird with olive oil, a lot of salt, and the juice from one lemon.  The lemon halves then went inside with the rosemary and onion and I added a clove of garlic (will add more next time).  I poured a cup of water over it and roasted it for 2 1/2 hours at 300 and it was amazing.  It was my first time ever cooking a whole chicken and everyone was super impressed.  Best to keep the drippings as thats where most of the flavor is.  Amazing once poured over top of the meat.

I have enjoyed cooking for a many years & this was by far the best chicken that has ever come out of my oven.  I mixed a tablespoon or so of olive oil w/ crushed garlic, rosemary, paparika & lemon juice and rubbed it under the skin.  Follow the 20min. per pound rule and the most important rule of letting it sit for 15min or so after you've pulled out of the oven and success is as easy as that!

I made this twice in the past two weeks - it's astonishing how little work will yield such amazing results!  After reading the reviews, I did the following: brined the chicken beforehand (you can find information on that under allrecipes advice), stuffed the cavity with an onion, some rosemary, several cloves of garlic, and two lemon halves (i reserved the juice to pour over the chicken).  I put the chicken on top of a bed of veggies (potatoes, carrots, brussel sprouts), seasoned with salt, pepper, and the reserved lemon juice, and drizzled it with a little olive oil.  I poured a little water into the pan, popped it in for 2.5 hours at 350 degrees.  I made three at once yesterday night for guests - I literally had people standing over the carcasses to pick off microscopic pieces of chicken.  Great recipe.

Wow.  This roast chicken was awesome!  I slipped some butter and fresh rosemary under the skin especially around the breast and thighs.  I rubbed olive oil over the chicken, squeezed one lemon over it and then used a little garlic salt and fresh ground pepper.  I stuffed some fresh rosemary, a few cloves of smashed garlic, the quartered onion,the lemon halves and some sea salt in the cavity.  Lastly I poured a can of chicken broth over the bird and popped her in the oven for about 2 hours while basting every so often.  My husband and in-laws were very impressed and thought it was so moist, tasty and delicious.  Definately making this again!

This is a good base for rosemary chicken. It was delicious and tender but i also rubbed rosemary and a table spoon of butter underneath the skin, squeezed some lemon from a whole lemon on top, took the advice of another and stuffed as many lemon wedges (with the onion and rosemary) in the cavity as possible, and also stuffed some garlic in there. Poured vegetable broth over it, and added some carrots and celery in the pan.  It was sooo good.

This makes a fantastic dinner!  I put carrots & quartered potatos in the pan around the chicken and poured a little chicken broth over them. This was an awesome one pot meal.  I cooked mine in a covered roating pan and uncovered it for the last 30 minutes or so.  I also rubbed the skin with a little olive oil.  The chicken was golden brown.  The meat and veggies had a wonderful flavor.

This is a really valuable recipe. I've made variations of this many times, sometimes using tarragon or thyme instead of rosemary. No matter what herb I decide to use, the technique of this recipe ensures perfect results every time. Stuffing the cavity is the key - in addition to a quartered onion, as many slices of lemon as you can fit in make all the difference between a pretty good roast chicken and one that is moist, tender, flavourful and covered in a crisp, golden skin.

This was very simple and very good.  I also added a garlic clove cut in half to the chicken cavity.  When I roast chickens I always make 2 (for leftvoer recipes)and the recipe doubled very nicely.  After dinner we removed all the meat and put the 2 carcasses in a pot and made stock.  If you do this....try to remove as much rosemary as possible before adding carcasses.  The rosemary can be very overpowering!  I made a couple of dishes using the meat and stock as leftovers and they were very tasty.  Another time I made this I used cut up chicken and simply sprinkled the rosemary over and chopped the onion and added it all to a big baking dish, with some chopped garlic and about a cup of stock.  I covered and baked for about 30 minutes at 350 then uncovered and finished baking for about 30 mintues until done...YUM!

Excellent!  Not the least bit dry.  I too used a little olive oil on the skin before baking.  I will definately be making this again.

USE A MEAT THERMOMETER!
I followed the 20 minute/pound advice of several reveiwers, and did NOT cook my 3-lb chicken 2 to 2-1/2 hours as the original recipe recommended.  Was I ever sorry!  It looked beautiful, but was terribly underdone... red meat at the inner thighs.  (I did use 2 oven thermometers like I always do to insure I had the oven temperature at 350.  I wiggled the leg and the juices ran clear).  BUT I should have used a MEAT thermometer to check the inner thigh temperature- the USDA says to cook chicken to an internal temp of 165 degrees.  (I also found several resources that said an unstuffed chicken takes 20-30 minutes per pound, and a stuffed chicken needs more cooking time than an unstuffed one.)

Wow! So moist juicy and so tender, I did not have to cut the meat with my fork -the meat was so soft!  Did not take much to prepare the chicken as I always have fresh herbs on hand. I chopped up a few sprigs of fresh rosemary, added a little chopped sage, 2 garlic cloves, the juice of 1 lemon, sea salt, black pepper, and olive oil with a little butter. I mix up the seasoning until somewhat pastey and smear the rub inside the chicken skin and all over the chicken, leaving the lemons and onion on inside cavity. I add a generous amount of olive oil all over the top of the chicken, add more sea salt, rosemary, and black pepper. I let the herbs marinate in the chicken for a while before roasting.  In the roasting pan I add the quartered onions with celery, carrots an chicken stock. Put chicken on top of the vegetables. I squeeze more lemon all over the chicken right before roasting. I put the chicken in the oven, uncovered, let it roast at 325 degrees for a few hours. Follow the "20 mins per pound of chicken" rule but I also want it more juicy and tender so I let it roast on lower temperature longer. When the juices run clear and chicken done, I take it out and let it sit for few mins. I served the chicken with, "rice with herbs de provence," scooping up all juices onto my rice and "herbed mushrooms with white wine" (all from AR).  I also prepare my turkey the same way, see, "Easy Herb Roasted Turkey, " also from this website. Awesome as well!!

There was a special on whole chickens at the supermarket yesterday so I came home with two.  Visited allrecipes to get some ideas and landed on this easy-sounding one.  I read almost all the reviews and wrote down various changes people had made and combined a few of these. I rubbed the chicken inside and out with a fresh lemon half, and threw the rest inside. Stuffed a couple of fresh garlic cloves plus a very large onion, quartered, inside, along with a good shake of ground rosemary (did not have fresh on hand).  Combined salt, pepper, more rosemary and olive oil in a little bowl and rubbed it all over the  chicken. Started the roasting, breast side up, at 425, for about 15-20 minutes to give it color and seal in the juices.
Turned the chicken over and basted with the pan juices.  Reduced the temperature to 350 and let it roast for another hour or so, basting often.  After about an hour of roasting, I added brussels sprouts, carrot slices and quartered potatoes around the chicken and made sure everything was coated well.
During the last 15 minutes of roasting, I turned the chicken over again, raised the temperature back to 425, to give the breast the golden brown color it needed.
Not so easy to wait the 10-15 minutes for the chicken to rest.....! I have to confess I ate pretty much half the chicken all by myself....yum!
As for doneness, I think the best way to test this is to use a digital thermometer.  Ovens vary too much to depend on a formula.

To aid in browning and to help keep the chicken moist I rubbed it all over with butter before it went into the oven.  I also gave it a brief, high heat blast at 450* for about 20 minutes, then finished it at 350*.  Made a delicious pan gravy with the drippings, chicken broth and a little white wine, reduced till it thickened.  As the submitter indicated, cooking time will vary depending on the size of the chicken.  To be on the safe side, invest in a meat thermometer - when the chicken is properly cooked it should register 170* at the thickest part of the thigh and the juices run clear, not pink.

I have to give this five stars because it provided the inspiration for one  of the best meals I have ever made. I washed the chicken and dried it well(a necessity to get that wonderful crispy skin), salted and peppered the cavity and the chicken very liberally, stuffed the cavity with a lemon cut in half and a generous amount of garlic in addition to the onion and rosemary. I mixed some minced rosemary and garlic with softened butter and rubbed it underneath the chicken skin. I tossed some cut up red skin potatoes, baby carrots and quartered onions with olive oil, garlic and minced rosemary and put it all around the chicken. I cooked it at 400 for about an hour and 45 minutes(5 lb chicken) and it was sooooo delicious. Everyone in my family loved it and they are all begging me to make it again soon.  The chicken was flavorful, juicy and delicious and the veggies were perfectly cooked and incredibly yummy as well. This is the perfect meal for a fall evening; I'll be making it often!

This is a great starter recipe, but definitely listen to the other reviewers to kick it up a notch to a full 5-star rating.  I rubbed the chicken with a good olive oil, minced garlic, and fresh lemon juice mixture. I also sprinkled the breast with kosher salt and fresh cracked black pepper. Furthermore, I added sliced garlic cloves to the cavity, in addition to the onion.  Next time, I will add lemon wedges as well.  I did use dried rosemary (all I had on hand), but I will use fresh next time.  Because the flavor is not overpowering, this is a very versatile dish.  The leftovers can be used in nearly anything.  It is far better than any store-bought rotisserie chicken I have ever eaten and well worth the time investment.

I made this recipe with the modifications suggested by other reviewers, namely adding lemon to onion and rosemary inside the chicken, rubbing the outside with oil, rosemary and lemon zest, and filling the pan with carrots, parsnips, and onions and pouring a couple of cups of chicken stock over it all and basting frequently. I also cooked the bird breast-side down. This was by far the best chicken I've ever eaten, the meat was very moist and flavorful and the aroma in the house while it was cooking was mouthwatering. I highly recommend this recipe!

This was really good.  I think the author assumed we would know to baste it every 20-30 minutes, which I didn't do, so it was a little dry.  So make sure you baste it.  I added some butter with onion powder on top and some shallots and garlic to the stuffing.

AMAZING!  I've recently discovered a love for roasting whole chickens.  My husband and I have been known to devour half a chicken in one sitting!  I think this is our favorite recipe so far.  I sprinkled the juice of 1/2 lemon over the chicken, then placed the other 1/2 lemon in the cavity along with the onion and rosemary.  I then drizzled the outside with some olive oil and rubbed generously with kosher salt and fresh ground black pepper.  I also saved some of the rosemary to rub on the outside.  It took about 2 hours for my 3.5 lb bird to get done and it was worth the wait.  Absolutely divine!

I made this tonight and it was fantastic.  I did add some other things after reading several reviews.  I put garlic in with the rosemary & onion. Also I put some butter & rosemary under the skin on the breast. Squirted lemon juice in the cavity. Then sprinkled more rosemary and paprika on the outside, brushed with olive oil. It was the best chicken I ever made. Thanks Nannett!!

Rub with olive oil. top with garlic salt, poutlry seasoning, and pinches of [spanish] paprika and cumin. Oh lord. yum.

So easy and the drippings made great gravy.  I had a 6 lb clicken that I roasted on a rack for 2 hours at convection 325 and let it stand 30 minutes.  It was perfect.  I put  the chicken innards (less the liver) and chopped carrots, celery & onions in the roasting pan to flavor the drippings as the chicken roasted.

I just love this recipe!  I've been making roast chicken so often now--who knew something this tasty could be so easy!  I took suggestions of other reviewers and prepare mine this way:  rinse out chicken and cover in olive oil, salt and pepper.  Squeeze lemon juice from 1 to 1.5 lemons (depending on how lemony you want it) over body and then stuff body cavity with the lemon halves and 1 whole small onion chopped and then about 3-4 sprigs of fresh rosemary (coarsely chopped to release more flavor).  I then bake the chicken at 400 (so it doesn't take as long) for around 2 hours--this is especially important to use higher heat because I've been using chickens that are 5-6 lbs., not just 3 lbs.  The chicken is ALWAYS moist--I don't add extra water to the baking dish--I did this once and not necessary.  The lemons and onion inside keep it moist and juicy.  For a slight Asian flavor, a variation I did was to stuff the body with minced garlic, 2 limes, and a whole onion, then season the body outside with garlic powder, salt, pepper, soy sauce and a bottled ginger/garlic salad dressing.  Yummy!  If youre chicken comes with giblets, I make gravy, too...combine pan drippings from roasting the chicken with rinsed giblets in a small saucepan and bring to a boil.  Strain out and discard giblets and any solids, then whisk in about 1/4 cup milk, 2 TBs flour, and 2 TB's butter--I then season with parsley flakes, and salt and pepper to taste.

JUICY & DELICIOUS!  I love the flavor the rosemary added to the chicken.  I made no changes to the recipe but I did roast it in my Pampered Chef clay baker with lid.  Tender and juicy.  Thank you LILQUIZ for sharing your recipe!

I've made this several times and it is so delicious! I put half a lemon, quartered onion and crushed garlic inside the cavity. Then on the outside I rub olive oil and lemon juice all over the chicken, and sprinkle salt, ground pepper and rosemary. Make sure to let the chicken rest for 10-15 min after cooking or you'll lose the juices when carving :)

Delicious recipe. I also rub it inside and out  with poultry seasoning and a bit more butter before stuffing.  Also, in addition to the rosemary and onion,  I  put a couple of 'whacked' cloves of garlic  in, a cut up lemon or orange and then put a couple pats of butter under the skin.    Adding a small amount of stock (or water or even white wine) and some root veggies to the pan  to roast along with the bird is great too. This is a wonderful, simple recipe that is great to play around with.

Sometimes the simpliest recipes are the best ones. If you cook this for two and a half hours it's going to be overdone. Start checking with a meat thermometer (never cook meat without one) at one hour and then add more time as needed. This is a versatile recipe that can be added to as desired, but it's great on its own.

I have to only give it 4 stars, b/c I added alot to it, as per the other suggestions. And I cooked an almost 4 lb bird for only 1 hr and 40 min, and that in and of itself already made the breast area a bit dry, so definitely follow the 20 min. per pound rule and not the 2 1/2 hours it says here. That said, the chicken itself came out SO TASTY. I pre-seasoned it the night before and it sat in my fridge for 12 hours. Kosher salt, fresh ground pepper, fresh garlic slices placed under the skin, rubbed with olive oil, fresh lemon juice, and stuffed with a whole onion, rosemary, and extra garlic. YUM. Next time I'm going to try to cook it with breast side down and see if that helps that area keep moist, since the rest of the chicken (wings, legs, etc) was just falling right off the bone, it was so tender!

Even though we followed this recipe exactly and even sprinkled some fresh rosemary on top of the chicken, it had almost no rosemary flavor.  It was still good, but I won't make it again just because I was expecting more rosemary flavor.

Am recently retired and now doing much of the cooking and menu planning.  Made this with a 4+lb. free-range organic chicken,3/4 cup rosemary, 5 cloves of garlic, onions, and oregano.  (Have an herb garden)  Rubbed with olive oil, seasoned with sea salt, paprika, ground pepper.  Roasted covered at 350 for an hour, uncovered at 360 for an hour.  Basted regularly with chicken stock. Surround with rutabaga, carrots, etc.  Making 4 company tomorrow.  Nothing but raves from family.

The chicken (especially the skin) really was amazing.  It received a compliment from my husband, which are hard to come by.  We ate the whole thing!  I followed recent reviewers: onion, garlic and rosemary inside the bird, lots of salt and pepper and olive oil in and out.  I did put potatoes, carrots and onions along with some water underneath and still used the rack.  Unfortunately, those were not done in the 2.5 at 350 so I guess I should really only review the actual chicken...and it was fantastic.

This is the best chicken ever!  I followed other advice and rubbed the bird with olive oil, sprinkled it with garlic, salt, pepper and more rosemary.  I then stuffed the cavity with a ton of FRESH rosemary from my yard, a cut up lemon, several cloves of fresh crushed garlic and a quartered sweet onion.  This bird was amazing- so moist and flavorful!!!!   I have since cooked a 19lb turkey the same way and it turned out to be the best home-cooked turkey I have ever made.  Such a simple recipe but it is the best!!

This was an excellent basic dish.  A few variations are necessary to achieve near-perfection.  They are as follows:  add lemon quarters and smashed garlic cloves (as many as your tastebuds like) to the cavity of the bird (along with the rosemary and quartered onion).  Also, squeeze juice from the quartered lemons and pour over bird prior to seasoning with salt & pepper or poultry seasoning.  Take a few pats of butter and tuck them under the skin of the bird.  You can also follow the lemon juice with a little bit of EV Olive Oil prior to seasoning (this helps to crisp the skin).  I recommend roasting veggies in the roasting dish because the juice that comes from the chicken and lemons is awesome.  Make sure that a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh reads 180 before removing from oven.

This was a great basic recipe for roasting a chicken.  I've made it a couple of times and it turned out excellent both times!  Both times I rubbed some olive oil and/or butter over all the chicken, cooked it breast side down, and stuffed it w/ fresh rosemary, fresh garlic cloves, and onion.  Once I added a cut up lemon, but I honestly couldn't tell any difference by adding the lemon.  I added some celery once too which was good.  This last time I peeled and quartered some potatoes, placed them around the chicken, added some quartered onions and butter on top of the potatoes, and baked them the entire time along with the chicken.  No need to add chicken broth since there was plenty from cooking the chicken.  The potatoes were excellent.  I sprinkled a little bit of Lawry's seasoned salt over the chicken and potatoes, too.  This is now one of our standard meals in our household.  So easy and tasty!

I actually modified this dish but it turned out really well and was delicious. Preheat oven to 220 c, mix 50g butter, 4 chopped cloves garlic, lemon rind, 1tsp dried thyme & 1/4 tsp salt in bowl, mix together & spread all over chicken (i stuffed some under the skin to prevent it from drying out). Insert 2 lemon quarters, rosemary, chopped onion and peeled garlic cloves into cavity of chicken. Place chicken in large oiled baking dish & roast for 20 mins. Then place some chopped vegetables (carrots, celery, leek etc.) around the chicken, add lemon quarters, unpeeled whole bulbs of garlic and 1/4 cup of chicken stock. Roast for a further 50 mins (basting regularly) or until chicken is cooked. Remove chicken from dish, cover with foil and leave to stand for 15/ 20 mins. Increase oven temp to 250 c. Roast veg for further 15 mins or til browned. Serve chicken with veg and pan juices. It's delicious and good for sandwiches the next day - enjoy.

I was very happy with this recipie.  I took some of the hints from other reviewers and added some twists of my own.  I used a cast iron ductch oven.  I rubbed the chicken with olive oil and salted it a little. I placed quartered potatoes and baby carrots around the chicken, poured one-half of a can of chicken broth over all, covered the dutch oven with foil and placed the lid on top.  After two hours of baking, I removed the foil and lid and brushed the chicken with a little browning sauce.  After removing the chicken and vegetable to a platter, I combined the remaining chicken broth with Two tablespoons of corn startch and combined with the drippings for an absolutely fabulous gray! Very impressive dish!  Thanks, Nanette!

This recipe is nearly perfect. Excellent roast chicken. The 2-hour baking time maybe a bit on the long side. I used a 3-pound chicken every time and it is done after 1 hour 40 minutes.

WOW, this was amazing. I brined it for 4 hours and added bacon drippings, olive oil and butter to the outside. Cut up a lemon and put 5 cloves of garlic in the cavity. This chicken made it a great Christmas dinner.

I've made a lot of roasted chickens in my life & I have to admit, this is one of the tastiest! I did rub it with Olive Oil & sprinkle my homemade Italian Seasoning on top. Mine was fully cooked in 2 hrs. Wonderful!

Very simple. I roast the chicken at 425 for the first 10-15 minutes, then turn it down to 350. I think that this sears and browns the chicken and keeps the juices inside. Mine came out very moist with lots of flavor.

Really excellent results for such a simple recipe!  I added some ground pepper, sea salt and fresh garlic, chopped the onion and rosemary, then mixed it all together with some olive oil to stuff in, around and on top of the chicken.  In a 9 x 13 pan, I surrounded the bird with sliced veggies (zucchini, summer squash, red bell pepper and carrot) and roasted the whole dish uncovered for about 3 hours at 350F.  Delish!  Thanks, Nanette!

Super easy and super yummy!!  I rubbed the chicken with olive oil, rosemary, salt, and pepper.  I also added some lemon slices to the cavity.  I cooked it covered under foil for the first hour and then took the cover off and basted every 20 minutes for the remaining time.  This produced the softest and juiciest chicken!!  It tasted awesome and the color was great!!

I used this recipe for my first attempt at roasting a whole chicken and was pleased with the results.  I used a larger 5 pound chicken and had leftovers to make homemade chicken noodle soup the next day.  Excellent!

This recipe is great however there is one imperative step that is not mentioned. It is crucial that you add water to the bottom of your roasting pan or the fat that drips off will burn and smoke up your entire house. I altered a couple things like putting butter underneath the skin and I cooked the chicken breast side down and the breasts were far juicier than if cooked breast side up. I will definitely make this again.

Great recipe as a base that lends itself for occasionally changing seasonings, herbs, fruits and veggies. I'm giving this recipe 5-stars because the ingredients are what I usually use to roast my chickens, except with one variation and that's to place the bird breast-side down in the pan's cradle so the juices from the chicken's back, thighs and legs trickle down to the breast meat to make it juicy. I've never had a dry chicken breast (turkey, too) roasted whole this way. Sure, right-side up the presentation looks funny but, we're eating it anyway, right? I've been to several cities in Italy and ate many wonderful dishes. I'm definitely sure that the chicken LILQUIZ had in Vicenza was roasted in a wood-burning oven - which is a common cooking method used all over Italy and lends a totally different flavor, like pan grilling, smoking and barbecuing would. Really, a wood-burning oven adds the best flavor. Wish I had one!

This is a great recipe. But might I add ... Take a whole lemon, roll  it on the counter to squish it up a little, stick several hole on it with a fork, and stuff it in the cavity along with the rosemary. It gives the juices a nice flavor.

This chicken was really good, but I did add chicken broth and I had to keep basting it so it wouldn't get to dry (the first time I made it, it was dry).

My husband and I truly enjoyed this. I confess, I did make some small changes. I used the Citrus Turkey Brine from this site overnight. I cooked it on a rack for about a half hour, then poured in some chicken broth, and basted it every once in awhile. I also stuffed the cavity with a quartered lemon. Thank you for this lovely recipe!

The chicken was very good and moist.  I dont normally eat chicken 'on the bone' and that may have been the reason I did not like it as much as some others.

Simple and tasty.  I have made this many times, and now I add a few extra seasonings to get more intense flavor into the chicken..lots of fresh, minced garlic, oregano, thyme, and seasoned salt everywhere (inside, under the skin, on top of the skin) in addition to generous amounts of fresh rosemary and pepper.  I oil the bird with olive oil prior to seasoning and add one can of chicken broth to the pan as other reviewers suggested. I've always been unsure whether to bake this covered or uncovered, but this time, I left it uncovered for the first and last 15 minutes. Also I poured off most of the chicken broth (saved into a glass measuring bowl) for the last 15 minutes so the bird could get crisper. This is a great base recipe to customize with your family's favorite herbs.

Good simple recipe but I expected a more herby flavour. Following other reccomendations I added 3 crushed cloves of garlic to the cavity; rubbed olive oil, salt, pepper and crushed rosemary into the skin and cooked it by the 20mins per pound (500g) rule. No moister than my normal roast chicken. May have to get over the squeamishness and rub flavourings under the skin too. The juices and the onions, rosemary and garlic from the cavity made an excellent gravy using gravy powder, water and white wine.

My husband and children LOVED this recipe.  I also included 2 garlic cloves with the onion and rosemary.  I combined chopped rosemary, salt, pepper, herbs de Provence, chopped garlic, and about a Tbsp of olive oil - mixed it all up and slathered on the outside of the chicken.  I also cooked it on a Spanek vertical roaster - with about 1/2 to 1 cup of chicken broth in the roasting pan.  It was awesome!

The recipe is fairly simple and came out tasty. I would recommend paying close attention to the temperature of your particular bird and not judging done-ness by time.

Wanted to give 4.5 Stars. Good recipe. Same basic recipe that my family has used since the old country: Mom learned from Grandma, I learned from Mom, I taught my then Wife (my Kids like mine better as I constantly check it to make sure it's not over cooked as most people irrationally do poultry). Several points; also use fresh lemon, garlic and maybe celery (celery inside only of course) on and in the cavity (stuff the used lemon peel inside with onion). Also maybe shorten the cooking time a bit. You can also try roasting at say 425*F+ for a much shorter time, say 50 minutes. Jaqcues Pepin and Julia child would good-naturedly argure over fast vs moderate oven. Also try herbs d' Provence. IT'S ALL GOOD! Serve with my family rice pilaf recipe here and life is good on the cheap!

This was delicious! The only thing I did different was to separate the skin from the chicken and rub olive oil directly on the meat under the skin as well as on the outside.  I saw this on a cooking show once.  I cooked it in a covered roasting pan.  Serve with roasted red potatoes and pan grilled asparagus. Fantastic!

I love this recipe. This was my first roasted chicken and it was a hit. The store ran out of fresh rosemary so I had to use dried rosemary on the outside of the chicken. I stuffed the cavity with onion and garlic. Very tasty.

This was great!! I gave it 4 stars though because I too did what it seemed like a lot of other people did: rubbed the outside of the bird with pepper and salt (I used seasoning salt), and olive oil and lemon juice and rosemary then stuffed the inside with onions, the squeezed lemons I had used, 2 garlic cloves and some more rosemary. I dumped a cup of chicken broth over it and then cooked for 2 hours on 350. I have never made a whole chicken and this was great and super easy! There was enough drippings for gravy too. Will make again for sure!

This is the best and easiest chicken recipe I have ever had!  The brine solution is a must for a tender bird.  I have always been a "from the box to the oven" kind of cook, but this recipe has given me the confidence to try to make more foods that aren't processed.  Hubby and all 4 kids love it.  My 10 year old says this is his favorite meal!

The best chicken I've ever had! I stuffed the cavity with a clove of garlic, some rosemary and half of a lemon and some onion. I took the advice of another reviewer and put chicken stock at the bottom of my roasting pan and I would every so often squeeze the juice onto the chicken. Before putting the salt, pepper and rosemary on the bird I used butter and a little olive oil. Before serving I squeezed a bit of lemon on to the bird as well as the drippings

My family loved this chicken for Thanksgiving! There were quite suprised it was so flavorful. I found it a bit on the bland side but if my family is happy I'm happy. I'm just glad I cooked my first roast chicken and everyone was pleased by the results. It was very simple  and took about an hour and half to cook.

Yummy! First time I've ever roasted a whole chicken, and it turned out great!  I did do some variation on the recipe - marinated the chicken with a mixture of olive oil, lemon juice, salt/pepper, and rosemary and also stuffed the chicken with lemon slices, garlic, onions, and rosemary.  About 3/4 the way through roasting, added a cup of chicken stock and veggies to the pan around the chicken...mmm!  I can't wait for my husband to get home to try it, I hope he's impressed! :)

Great recipe although I did a few things different. I followed the directions but added a few things: - Sliced a lemon and stuffed 3 slices of lemon inside bird with garlic, onions, and rosemary. Used the rest of the lemon slices by placing them under the skin of the chicken. -Used about 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter. I used one tablespoon under the skin and the other inside the cavity of the bird. -Added baby carrots, red potatoes and onions to the roasting pan along with 1 can of chicken stock.  The chicken was so moist, the veggies were tasty and now I have lots of leftovers for a chicken soup and pot pie. Enjoy!

Great base recipe!  There are a zillion variations (I once stuffed the bird with an apple and another time with celery) but I always coat the bird in butter (under and over the skin) and I always roast breast side down to make the breast meat juicier.  Sometimes I add veggies to the roasting pan, sometimes I don't.

Delicious, moist, worth making again. I used a 5.5 lb chicken, so I roasted it a while longer. I also stuffed the cavity with lemon wedges, crushed garlic cloves, rosemary, thyme, and sage (all fresh), rubbed the skin (and under it) with a mixture of olive oil, grated garlic, and chopped rosemary and thyme. I wrapped the chicken in plastic wrap and refrigerated it overnight. So tasty! Thanks for a new favorite!

Have been making rosemary chicken for years and for me, simplest is best, especially when roasting. Lemon and rosemary inside is wonderful. I also make rosemary butter (fresh minced rosemary worked into buuter) Lift breast skin up very gently by placing fingers undenearth the skin and lifting very gently..spread rosemary butter all over the breast meat..cover as much as you can.  Sprinkle with paprika and a little garli salt.roast for about 1 1/2 hours or until juices run clear.  Best chicken I've ever had/1

My recipe like this includes basting with a lemon-butter baste, then sprinkling on the rosemary.  I've had this recipe for close to 25 years and served it many times for dinner guests to rave reviews.  It's a hit!!  Also my recipe calls for roasting the chicken from 1 hour 15 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes.  No matter what size, I've never had an undercooked chicken.  I'm at about 300 feet elevation.

Wow, what a great chicken. This was my first attempt at making a whole chicken and the only thing that didn't go quite right was that it basically fell apart after an hour and 45 minutes. I decided to check it on a whim and the legs were falling off!! I cooked it in a roasting pan at 350 and it was a 4lb bird. It was still moist and delicious but I couldn't lift it out of the pan well because the whole thing just fell apart. At least I knew it was done. Next time I'll only cook it for 1 1/2 hours and see what it looks like.

By itself, this recipe is great.  The second time around, I stuffed the cavity of the chicken with a quartered lemon, a quartered small onion, several garlic cloves, along with the fresh rosemary.  I placed halved red potatoes, baby carrots and additional onion wedges on the bottom of the roasting pan and covered them with approximately 28 - 32 oz. of chicken stock.  The vegetables came out perfectly and the chicken was so moist!!  The onions and carrots caramelized and the potatoes came out perfect, too.

When I read the recipe, I couldn't understand why it was so highly rated when it seemed so simple.  Well, I tell you what, this was amazing chicken!  I stuffed mine full of red onions, garlic, rosemary, lime juice, salt and pepper.  I rubbed the outside with olive oil after patting it dry, and then put lots of salt, pepper, thyme, garlic and rosemary one the outside. I baked it for a little over two hours on a rack, keeping it covered for half the time.  The skin was crispy and the meat was so flavorful!

This was my first time cooking a whole chicken and I was pretty impressed with the results.  I used this recipe as a base and added to it.  As written, I was afraid the chicken would come out dry.  I stuffed the cavity with the called for salt, pepper, onion and rosemary and added 2 crushed cloves of garlic.  I melted butter and added salt, pepper, garlic powder and rosemary to it.  I rubbed some under the skin and poured the rest over the bird.  I then seasoned the bird with more salt, pepper and poultry seasoning.  I cooked it as stated but was not getting any juice after an hour for basting, so I added a 1/2 cup of chicken broth to the pan.  I used a 7-1/2 lb bird and it was ready in 2-1/2 hours.  I used the pan drippings for a nice gravy.  The chicken was good, I do love rosemary but it really overpowered the dish.  It was a bit too much.  My family really enjoyed it though.  Thank you, Nanette!

My family loved this!  And my husband was very impressed!  I stuffed the cavity with a mixture of onion, rosemary, lemon, garlic, and bay leaves.  Placed a rub of sea salt, pepper, garlic powder, and thyme on the outside.  Baked it for 1 1/2 hours covered and then 1/2 hour uncovered.  Had a can of low-sodium chicken broth and 1/2 cup of white wine in the pan to baste it with.  That made for a very tasty gravy.  Also surrounded the bird with carrots and potatoes while it baked.  Wonderful Sunday night dinner!  Will definitely make this again!

Fantastic recipe!  Flavorful, moist and really easy.  Best of all the kids loved it!!  I followed some suggestions of others.Added 2 lemon halves, and 2 garlic cloves to the onion and rosemary.  Placed quartered red potatoes and baby carrots in bottom of rosting pan and added 8 oz of organic chicken broth.  I used a 5 lb chicken in a 13x9 pan.  Next time I'd use a larger pan so it would hold more carrots and potatoes.

This is a wonderful recipe, but there are a couple things that need to be done for it to be excellent.  First of all you need to have about two inches of water or chicken broth and water in the roaster at the beginning to cook the bird in.  You also need to baste the bid about three or four times through the course of the cooking.  Something I did which helped was I lifted the skin so it was loose and then I put another chopped onion between the breast and the skin.  It helped keep the breast moist as well as keeping the wonderful rosemary and onion flavour.  This is a keeper that I will definitely use again.

I made this for Thanksgiving instead of Turkey and it turned out very well.  The chicken was juicy and the meat was very tender.  Even my boyfriend, who is very picky about chicken, loved this dish.  Just don't be too cautious with all the rosemary in the chicken.  It really made the chicken have a nice aroma to it.

Being single, I don't always like to make a whole bird.  So, I bought a couple of chicken parts, stuffed it in a roaster bag, used the rosemary rub, quartered some onions for the bag and added another spring of rosemary.  And it was delicious and moist!

This was good but dry. I will make this again. I will do as others and rub butter under the skin. I will also place the rosemary under the skin to get the flavor through the bird. I think you could sub the seasonings to your liking. If you are roasting be sure to add water or chicken broth to the bottom of the pan. I read where some added veggies on the bottom.

Turned out delicious! I did follow the advice of some other reviewers, with onion wedges, lemon wedges and rosemary stuffed inside and rubbed lemon butter under the skin. So tasty, it got a lot of compliments. Thanks for a great recipe!

Great basic chicken roasting recipe.  You can add whatever flavors you wish to stuff the bird.  I've added quartered lemons, garlic and various herbs.  Using fresh herbs will get the best result.  And use a meat thermometer to check doneness.

Dude this is the best chicken I eeeeever made! I rubbed it with olive oil then rubbed salt, pepper and rosemary all over it. Stuffed the inside with onions and orange slices and a bunch more rosemary sprigs. Also shoved like 5 more rosemary sprigs underneath its skin. Cooked as the recipe directs. OMG SO GOOD!

I'm a rotisserie chicken lover usually, but this turned out really good. Even though, I applied other reviewers advice by brining and using additional ingredients and herbs, the rosemary stood out pleasantly. I would definitely use this recipe again, whenever I make roast chicken, mostly because the vegetables underneath the rack turned out so fabulous! I read someones review that they salted baby carrots and potato quarters and roasted that on the bottom of the pan with chicken stock... I did this as well but added fresh brussel sprouts and crushed sage leaves... never had brussel sprouts tasted so good!!! (5 star veggies for sure!)

Wonderful and SO easy.  I couldn't find a 3 lb chicken at my grocery store so I used a 6 lb one instead.  I stuffed the cavity with a little more than 1/4 cup chopped rosemary since I had a larger bird and as much of the onion as would fit.  The house smelled amazing and my family loved it.  The rosemary flavor really permeated the chicken.  I will definitely be making again!

I have made this 3 maybe 4 times, and every time I make it is a big hit.

I add lemon wedges and garlic cloves to the stuffing.

I also like to cut openings in the chicken skin, and add butter slices in between the skin and meat.  It makes the skin sooooo crispy and the meat so savory.  It is delicious.

I also make a baste of olive oil, lemon juice, sea salt, pepper and rosemary.  I baste every 30 minutes.

Comes out perfect all the time.

I use the leftover meat and make a wonderful risotto using another recipe on here: gourmet mushroom risotto.

Perfect weekend meal!

Deeeeeeelicious! I followed some of the tips down at the bottom (lots of lemon, garlic, butter and rosemary under the skin, olive oil on the skin, chicken broth...) It was FABULOUS! My first ever oven roasted chicken and I can't stop eating it! Kids and husband loved it too. Thank you for sharing!

After reading other people's reviews, I decided to brush the skin with olive oil (and sprinkle some spices on top: thyme, rosemary, etc.). My advice is: do NOT add the olive oil! If you at all have a sensitive stomach then the added oil will make the chicken way too oily for consumption. I had to throw half of it away and let my stomach recover for a couple of days.

Very tasty and super moist!  I put butter and rosemary under the skin and also bacon across the breast for the first half of cooking.  Stuffed the cavity with carrot, celery, garlic, onion and lemon!  Added carrots, potatoes and onions to the roaster!  Would make this again for sure!

Very good! I minced garlic and rosemary and added lemon juice, lemon zest, olive oil, salt and pepper then rubbed this all over the meat (under the skin) and saved a little to rub over the skiin. I also cut a lemon in half and placed it in the cavity along with some rosemary sprigs and about 6 garlic cloves. Very tasty. Roasted a 5 1/2 pound chicken for 2 hours.

i rated this a 2 only because of all the additions i had to make. as is, its barely even a recipe. i used a 7lb chicken. i stuffed butter and garlic under the skin, and rubbed the outside with olive oil. i seasoned the inside and outside with salt, pepper, and dried thyme. i stuffed the cavity with a quartered lemon, fresh rosemary sprigs, garlic, chopped celery, and a quartered onion. i poured 4 cups of chicken broth and 1 cup of dry white wine into the roasting pan. roasted for about 2 hours and 45 min on 350, then 15 more min on 450 to brown the skin. basted every 20 minutes. i ended up having to add another 2 cups of broth so it didnt cook dry. fried up some bacon and sauteed portobello mushrooms and onions. let chicken sit 15 min after removing from oven! when the chicken was done, i mixed up 2tbs of cornstarch with COLD water, and then added 2 cups of the chicken drippings from the pan. cooked on med heat until it made a nice gravy. thin with water if necessary. added crumbled bacon to the gravy. served chicken sliced with mushroom/onion mixture on top and a spoonful of gravy over that. the breast meat was extremely moist, and the gravy was very flavorful. if you follow the recipe as is, you get a chicken that smells good while cooking, but is very bland.

I have roasted LOTS of chickens in my life, but this was the BEST I have ever made. The only thing different than the recipe, was that I had a 7 lb. roaster so I used double the ingredients, and I also melted some butter and added the salt and pepper, and part of the rosemary to the butter. Then I basted the chicken with this under and on the skin. The chicken came out JUICY and the skin was crisp. In the past I have used lemons in the cavity but the meat was not as juicy as with this recipe. I think it must be the FRESH rosemary and onion combination.

This recipe was so easy and so delicious.  The smell of rosemary in the house long after dinner was over was wonderful.  I followed the other suggestions of placing butter under the skin, added garlic in with the onion and rosemary.  I basted the outside with olive oil, Herbs de Provence, garlic powder, salt and pepper.  I also followed the suggestions of Wonderwabbit from September, 2008 of cooking first with the breast up and turning it over for the remaining time and then turning it back over for the last 20 minutes.  I am not a good cook at all and this was easy and delicious.  Thank you Lilquiz.

I made this chicken tonight for dinner. Yum!  My husband and son enjoyed it. I brushed olive oil, rosemary and the juice of half a lemon on the skin before roasting. One addition I did was to put some cooking wine (white) in the roasting pan to deglaze. Then I continued to make gravy as usual. I am sure I will make this one again.  Great dish to make on a snowy Saturday!!!

Wonderful recipe.  I have baked this chicken for years.  Only suggestion is that the chicken is baked way too long.  1 1/2 hours maximum should do it.  And let chicken sit for 15 minutes before slicing.

My husband is not the best cook in the kitchen, but he tried this chicken recipe, and it turned out WONDERFULLY!! Needless to say, I was pleasantly shocked!  The meat is chockful of flavors that make my mouth water. And as if it weren't already wonderful, it's even better reheated! Kudos to the creator of this recipe!

I just love this recipe. We eat it about every 5 weeks or so. It's so simple to make and you can taste the rosemary throughout the chicken. After we are done eating it, I pick the big pieces of meat off, then throw the entire thing in the crockpot, cover with water and a half teaspoon of apple cider vinegar and let boil for 24 hours. The broth is full of calcium and makes a great chicken noodle soup!

**EXCELLENT**  I always buy my whole chickens in pairs at Sam's Club...and I'm so glad to find yet another way to roast 'em! I did follow reviewers' suggestions by adding a quartered lemon & garlic along with onions into the chicken. After an hour of roasting, I added baby carrots, quartered potatoes & about 2 cups chicken broth to the pan which makes nice gravy...NICE!!

I gave this 5 stars, but actually I really used a lot of tips from these reviews.  I rubbed the outside with olive oil/black pepper/garlic powder/rosemary and I stuffed the cavity  with lemon, onion, garlic, and rosemary sprigs.  Delicious!  The leftover chicken  can be used for chicken soup(see Quick and Easy Chicken Noodle Soup) or casserole.  I'm so glad I tried this recipe! I also want to point out that I made it without salt, and it was still amazing, so it's perfect to make for those who are on a low sodium diet.

I'm only giving this 4 stars b/c of all of the modifications to the recipe. I followed AbeLincoln's suggestions pretty close, with a few changes. Unfortunately, I had no rosemary on hand at all- so I used thyme. But this is what I did: I stuffed the cavity with 1 quartered onion, 1 quarted lemon, about 1 tsp kosher salt, 1 palmful thyme, and 4 cloves garlic. I cut slits all over the chicken and put pats of butter in the slits. I rubbed the skin with olive oil, then sprinkled it with seasoned salt, cracked pepper, italian seasoning, and thyme. I then poured about 1/4 c. white wine in the bottom of the pan and baked for a little less than 2 hours at 350 degrees (my chicken was 5.3 lbs with a pop-up timer). It came out wonderful! I can't stress enough how moist and flavorful it was.

I rubbed olive oil on the chicken's skin and put some whole garlic cloves in with the onion and rosemary.  Even my cat went crazy when he smelt the aroma from the oven.  The chicken came out very moist and very tasty.

This was a nice change to the usual roast chicken.  I used dried rosemary instead of fresh and put the onion under the skin with some crushed garlic. Turned out perfectly.

Ok I can't give this any stars because of all the changes I made. I followed the suggestions and added lemon juice, garlic and olive oil. It came out wonderful but, those were major changes that made the dish completely different. I don't know how it would've tasted with only rosemary and onion alone.

In a bowl I combined 3/4 of the onion with 2 T lemon juice, 1 T dried rosemary, 1 t oregano, and 3 large garlic cloves (split in half) then stuffed the mixture underneath the skin. I rubbed the skin with 1 T olive oil and a dash each of paprika, pepper, rosemary, and garlic salt.  To the pan I added 2 c chicken broth, 2 carrots sliced, 2 ribs of celery chopped, and 2 small potatoes diced and covered w/ foil.  I used a 4.75 lb chicken.  After 1 hour removed the foil, let it bake another 20 minutes, then cranked the oven up to 425 to finish (about 20 minutes)and crisp the skin.  I basted it every 15-20 minutes.  It turned out perfect, and very moist.  Love it!

I thought this recipe was full of flavor.  The aroma was amazing as well!!  I added garlic inside the cavity of the chicken along with the rosemary and onion.  added butter and a little more rosemary under the skin of the chicken for some added flavor.  I rubbed the bird down with olive oil, sage, garlic powder and a bit more rosemary.  It was delicious and yes the picky 1.5 year old told mommy that the "ticken" was "nummy"!  Thanks for the recipe.

I'm going to have to go against the grain here. I did not think this was fantastic, but it was good. I also did not think the results justified all the ingredients that went into the "stuffing." I added lemon wedges and garlic to the rosemary and onion stuffing. I also put pats of butter under the skin and brushed the skin with olive oil. My chicken was moist because I kept basting every 20 minutes. My chicken had only a slight hint of rosemary, and the only reason it had any lemon flavoring was because I squeezed two lemons on top before and during cooking. Next time I won't bother with any stuffing, and will just put the rosemary under the skin.

My friends gave this chicken an A+! It was my first roast too! I put a can of chicken broth in the roasting dish gradually over the first hour just to be extra sure it would be juicy and it was! It also made a great gravy at the end.

This was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, and the results were great. The chicken was so tender that while carving it, some pieces fell apart. But it was so scrumptious! I also rubbed the chicken with olive oil before roasting. It resulted in a crispy brown skin, which was yummy!

Don't know what all the rave reviews are about. The only thing that made this chicken NOT dry as a bone was basting it in olive oil, which is NOT included in the original recipe. Otherwise nothing special.

This was excellent.  It was easy to prepare, taked wonderful, and made a very lovely presentation over garlic mushroom rice pilaf.  Once the chicken was done, I did squeeze 1 lemon over the top.  Added a nice citron flavor.  I will be making this again.

Yummy! Added garlic and lemon in the cavity of the chicken. I do not have a pan with a wrack so just added 1/2 cup of chicken stock to the bottom with the onions that could not fit in the chicken. Let stand for 1 hour then roasted. So good!  Also, I did not have fresh rosemary, used 1 tablespoon of dried and the dish still came out Yummy! Thanks Allrecipes for such great recipes and great people who leave great reviews on how to make the dish even better! Happy Cooking!

Simple, straightforward recipe for fragrant and juicy roast chicken. I took the advice of other reviewers and added a quartered lemon and crushed garlic to the inside of the chicken before roasting, and also added quartered new potatoes and chunks of carrot to the pan with a bit of chicken stock--good eating. Husband was delighted. A note: I was not a fan of the lingering rosemary flavor when I used the carcass to make chicken stock later that day.

BEST CHICKEN EVER!!!  Since it was just my husband & me for thanksgiving we picked up a 4.5lb fryer.  I did not have fresh rosemary so I used dried and only other change was I applied bits of butter on the skin which rendered the most delicious skin!  The onion keeps the cavity so moist the meat fell from the bones and was delectable!  I found letting the bird rest while covered was another good move!  Can't wait to make the next one!  SIMPLE and DELICIOUS!

Loved this recipe!  My Husband who hates chicken loved it.  I took all of the advice and stuffed the bird with onion, rosemary, garlic and lemon.  Rubbed it with olive oil and seasoned it with salt and pepper.  After an hour I added white wine, veggies and fingerling potatoes.  Super easy and the house smelled so good!  Served it with a spinach salad with pomegranate, radish and almonds in a creamy onion dressing I made.  So delicious!  Can't wait to use the leftovers in a chicken salad.

FAB dish that the whole family enjoyed! I stuffed the cavity with a quartered lemon AND onion. Also stuffed heavily with rosemary, salt, and pepper. I used a can of chicken stock and poured that in the roasting pan and added quartered potatoes, baby carrots, and some onion. Then I seasoned the vegetables with salt and pepper to taste. Cooked 2 1/2 hours @350 degrees and served with chicken stuffing...YUM! Great recipe!

I know it's been changed, but it is DELICIOUS! Salted inside and out, mixed onion with rosemary and garlic for stuffing. Added some lemon juice, put on top of red potatoes and carrots, added chicken broth. Best roast chicken I've made in a while! Flavors began in this recipe, so it gets all the credit!!

Quick, easy, delicious!  I added around 1/2 cup white wine and some minced garlic with nice results.  The whole family enjoys this meal (served with baked garlic/rosemary potatoes).

I made this chicken for my friends and they loved it.  I didn't have lemon so I used two limes instead.  I used brined chicken-- so the meat was especially juicy and tender.  I wasn't expecting such bursts of flavor-- I will definitely be making this again.

I liked this recipe so much that I will definitely make it again.  The ultimate goal for me is to make something close to that of Roli-Roti chicken, which is sold here in the farmers market.  Anyone has the recipe for those?  Those Roli-Roti chickens have such a irresistible rosemary fragrance that consistently draws long lines.  
The recipe as is worked beautifully for me and there was no tweaking necessary.

I made this recipe following AbeLincolns' review because to me, tossing in carrots & potatoes in to have a complete meal in 15 minutes of preparation was great for a busy week night... and it was: very tasty and juicy, lots of flavors! I will make this again but next time, I'll add the veggies after an hour of cooking or so... Very good & sooo simple!

Per other suggestions I added chicken broth to the pan along with potatoes, carrots, whole garlic cloves and more onion. I also placed some rosemary and butter under the skin. My family loved it, so I am making it again tonight. Very easy meal!

This came out beautifully, very juicy and tender with fantastic flavor. I gave the chicken a bit of a rub with fresh lemon juice, butter, salt and pepper, and also stuffed some lemon wedges and garlic in with the rosemary and onion.

Served most recently to my mother-in-law, who went back for thirds!!

Such a simple meal to prepare, and it tastes absolutely awesome! I stuffed the chicken full with onion, rosemary, the juice of a lemon and lemon wedges.  Rubbed the outside of the bird with olive oil, salt and pepper.  Cooked with potatoes and carrots in the pan, and the chicken and veggies turned out amazing!

My chicken turned out moist, but there could have been a littlle more flavor infused. Next time, I will season under the skin to get more flavor.  Very good though.

I think I did something wrong, which is very possible as I am rather new to cooking.  For some reason ingredients I put in the middle (rosemary, onion, garlic, and lemon) did not seem to get into the rest of the chicken.  It mostly just tasted like plain chicken.  And the veggies I put with the chicken also seemed bland.

The whole house smelled fantastic and this also tasted great.  I roasted the chicken on a rack in a pan filled with onion, potato, carrots and garlic marinated according to AR roast vegetable recipe.  The drippings from the chicken mixed in with the veggies.  Great meal for company or just us, easy prep, easy cleanup.

It's hard to resist the urge to modify this recipe, but I'm pretty confident it is delicious as is.  I made three simple changes.  I added whole garlic cloves to the cavity, seasoned salt and garlic powder to the outside of the bird, and a T of melted butter to give the bird an added crisp.  Very good.

This is a really simple and delicious way to roast a whole chicken.  I like to stuff a mixture of chopped rosemary (any other fresh herbs can be used, too!), minced garlic, salt, pepper, & EV olive oil between the skin & the breast meat for added flavor.  It's a little more effort than the original recipe, but well worth it.  I always rub the outside of the chicken with EV olive oil, salt & pepper, & some of the chopped herbs.  Try adding a couple lemon halves, garlic cloves, & a couple bay leaves to the onion & rosemary in the cavity stuffing.  Great tasting bird!  The drippings make for the best gravy EVER!  With the rosemary & lemon tree in the backyard, I'm always looking for ways to use the fresh ingredients.  Thanks for the recipe!  :)

This is one of the simplest, yet most incredible recipes on this site. The chicken was so juicy and tender...my family said it tasted like the rotisserie chickens from the store. I didn't have any fresh rosemary, so I rolled my onion quarters in dried rosemary before stuffing them inside the chicken cavity. This worked really well...the chicken came out with a delicate rosemary/onion flavor that was absolutely fabulous. The drippings also made an exquisite gravy  that tasted so delicious on mashed potatoes! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe...it only takes about 5 minutes to prepare, but it really tastes like you fussed! I have a feeling that this will become my go to chicken recipe. Thanks so much!!!

THis has become a favorite at our house with a few adjustments based on reviews.  Stuffed chicken with a couple cloves of garlic, a quarterd lemon and half an onion.  Rubbed skin and under skin with a kosher salt/herbs de provence/pepper mixture.  Baked it on a rack UPSIDEDOWN with breast down allowing all the yummy dark meat juices to moisten the meat and keep skin crisp.  The best roast chicken!

The chicken turned out moist.  I was afraid it would be a bit bland, so I stuffed some fresh rosemary under the skin of the chicken, and seasoned the outside of the bird with some olive oil and seasoning.   I don't recall how much time it took to cook it - as I used a meat thermometer to monitor... I do know was done before the recommended cooking time in the recipe.  Per another user's recommendation I roasted the chicken on a bed of potatoes, carrots, onion and chicken stock.  Everything cooked perfectly!

Delicious and so easy to prepare.  Also a lot of bang for the buck  as it's fairly inexpensive. I also put rosemary and lemon jc. directly under the skin in addition to stuffing the cavity. Just took my Thanksgiving turkey out of the oven and sorry that I did not prepare it by using this recipe.

It's very good, but many people will wish they'd had more seasonings. I personally added garlic & savory to mine, and it was very tasty. It's worth noting that, as written, this chicken will not produce a golden crisped skin--you must apply olive oil, butter, or cooking spray to the skin to brown & crisp it. My picture (when I submit it) will reflect a chicken with herbs & cooking spray applied.

Very yummy.  I took the advice of others and stuffed it with garlic cloves, celery, lemon, onion, kosher salt.  I rubbed the outside with salt, pepper, garlic, rosemary and olive oil.  Placed carrots and quartered red potatoes in the bottoom with a can of chicken stock. Highly recommended.

We also stuffed this with lemon wedges, onion wedges, garlic cloves, and rosemary, and slathered it with olive oil, crushed garlic, and rosemary, put chunks of potato, parsnip, and carrots beneath it, and poured chicken stock over it, baking it for 1 and 1/2 hours. The skin was crisp and flavorful, the chicken was moist and delicious, and the potatoes, etc, were done perfectly. An amazing meal!

This is the best chicken recipe I have ever made. It is full of flavor and very moist. I use to make it with a whole chicken but now I use whole chicken breasts with skin. I place 1/4 of an onion under the chicken breast in a roasting pan. I then mix 1/4 cup of lite butter, 1/2 tsp of minced garlic and a splash of lemon juice together. This is enough for two breasts. I then place the butter mixture under the skin of the chicken breast with a sprig of fresh rosemary. Sprinkle the breast with pepper, pour about 1 cup or so of white wine in the roaster and bake covered at 350 for about 1 hr. After removing the chicken breast from the roasting pan I then add parsley to the wine, thicken it with flour and water and serve it over rice. It is soooooooo good. It is good with the whole chicken also but with the breasts I can make it on a work night.

Great and very easy.  I also did this adding, in addition to the onion and rosemary, fresh thyme springs, 6 cloves of garlic, and half a lemon.  Great the original way, or with the extra additions.

This was excellent - I also used rosemary, garlic and olive oil to braise the top of the chicken. Then I poured about 2 Tbsp lemon juice over it. I also put 3/4 c. of chicken broth in the bottom of the pan and cooked the veggies in the pan while the chicken roasted.I will do this again !

This was my first time cooking a whole chicken & I plan to do it often now.  This was delicious!  My family loved it.  As other reviewers I rubbed outside with EVOO (extra virgin olive oil), stuffed the cavity with onions.  I did not have fresh rosemary, so I sprinkled dried rosemary on the outside and it was delicious,  I also placed carrots & potatoes in the roaster with the chicken.

This was my 1st roasted chicken and it turned out beautifully! I made sure to brine a 3lb. chicken for 2.5hrs. in the fridge. I stuffed the cavity with fresh rosemary, a chopped onion, a few cloves of fresh garlic, a little olive oil, Kosher salt, pepper, lemon zest, and squeezed lemon quarters. I added more rosemary, Kosher salt and pepper under the skin. I rubbed olive oil all over the outside and finished with the reserved lemon juice. I cooked the chicken covered @ 350F for about 2hrs, uncovered for the last .5hr., basting every so often with some stock. Very flavorful, juicy and tender! Used leftover the next day for a cold chicken sandwich and it was by far the best one I've ever had. Lastly, I made stock from the bones...nothing went to waste! Will definitely make this again.

As written I'd only give this recipe 3 stars.  It's a good begining but needs some tweaking.  I added two cloves of garlic to the chicken and added some broth to the bottom of the pan.  I made sure to rub some of the rosemary with butter under the skin along the breast and leg.  I also didn't cook it for as long as stated in the recipe; if I had the chicken would have been dry and overdone.

4 stars as is, 5 with the addition of fresh garlic, lemon, and olive oil.  Zest the lemon, mix it with sea salt and olive oil, then rub the bird on and under the skin with it. Add crushed garlic cloves and the quartered lemon(s) to the cavity. SOOOO good that even my picky 5 year old loved it!

This is a great Recipe as is. However, you can stuff the chicken with any type of fruit. Apples,grapefruit,oranges,lemons,onions etc..Garlic and butter under the skin is always good.Roasting this on the grill is always incredible. If you use a gas grill with 3 burners go Medium, off, Medium. Check temperture to keep it around 350-375 you will love it.

I do a similar recipe that others have mentioned, using lemons.  I squeeze the lemon halves over the bird, then stuff the squeezed lemons inside.  I also add a couple of lemon slices under the skin.  Yummy! Everyone .loves it.

This is one of the first grownup recipes I learned from my Grandma. Best off with sea salt and fresh rosemary. This is great for family dining or upscale-impress dinner. One of my go-to roast chicken recipes. TIP: This leftover chicken is GREAT in fried rice.

I bought a whole chicken for the first time the other day, but had no idea what to do with it. Luckily I came to all recipies to find something and came across this. I LOVE rosemary so this is definatly the recipie for me. I also added lemon to the inside and skin, cooked ontop of carrots and celery and poured 2 cups of chicken broth over the top. It was great. The carrots really soak up the flavor nicely. They were probably my favorite element to the dish, and i don't even like cooked carrots usually.

This was amazing! I followed the suggestion of others by stuffing the chicken with one lemon in addition to the onion and rosemary. I also stuffed a sprig of rosemary under the skin of each breast and rubbed some butter into the skin and sprinkled with salt and pepper before putting it in the oven. It turned out fabulously crispy, tender and oh so flavorful! The drippings made for an excellent gravy which we served over mashed potatoes and stuffing. Thanks for this wonderful recipe. I will be making my roast chickens this way from now on!

I didn't have any rosemary at home so I stuffed the chicken with a quartered onion and 4 cloves of garlic. I mashed up some butter with dried thyme and spread it on the breast under the skin. Delicious!

This was my first time oven-roasting a chicken and it came out beautifully.  The onions were my favourite part, which is odd because I don't usually like onions at all.  I rubbed olive oil and lemon juice under the skin of my bird and sprinkled crushed rosemary on top.  Everyone loved it, and I will make it again!

Very delicious and simple. The vegetables taste great from the juices of the chicken. I was surprised with how much flavor the dish had. I added lemon to the inside of the chicken like a few have suggested.

this is the easiest and best!  the only thing i added to the recipe is stuffing--toasted some breadcrumbs, mixed them with a little egg, salt, and pepper and stuffed the bird with the rosemary stems sticking out for an added touch. even my kids eat it, and that is saying a lot.

This chicken was so savory and delicious I find myself suggesting it to my husband all the time for dinner. I used a rosemary and garlic rub recipe that I also found on this site.  It basically consists of fresh rosemary, garlic, olive oil, salt and pepper which I mixed together and then rubbed uner the skin of the chicken. Then I took the other recipe suggestions and stuffed the bird with fresh chopped onion and plenty of rosemary sprigs. I then filled the pan with chopped potatoes, onion and carrots. I sprinkled some olive oil on the veggies to keep them from drying out along with some salt and pepper. This smelled wonderful while cooking.  I had a five pound bird and it took a little over two and a half hours.  I had the oven at 350 and then turned it up a little after about two hours because everyone was getting hungry. This is an easy and delicious recipe.  I had never roasted a chicken before this, and it came out great!

simply put...WOW! I live alone and it takes a lot of flavor to impress upon me that cooking is worth it. A good friend that shared this meal with me (and knows my culinary limitations) was VERY impressed.  Better than any rosemary chicken I have had in a restaurant. Thank you!

Excellent and so easy. I like to add a little dried herb to the seasonings on the skin, and sometimes it's nice to put some garlic and/or lemon in the cavity along with the rosemary and onion, but this recipe is just fine as written. Simple, straightforward, and so succulent!

as others have said, please follow a 20 to 25 min per LB rule. I too had an over 4lb chicken and it took about an 1 hour and 40 mins, though I think I could have pulled it out a bit sooner, like maybe 1 hour, 30 mins. That said, for how easy it is to put this recipe together, the flavor is fantastic! I did 2 whole stems of rosemary- leaves pulled, rinsed and chopped fine. Also I recommend using kosher salt or sea salt versus the fine table salt. My skin got browned, i did turn my pan around 1/2 way through cooking to ensure even browning. If you don't have an oven thermometer, I highly suggest investing in one - your oven dial might say 350, but your oven might be as low as 300, or range between 320 - 360.

Excellent.  The other reviews were extremely helpful.  I followed the 20 minutes per pund rule and I also used garlic and rosemary on and under the skin with a litlle bit of olive oil.  My only question is if the skin is supposed to turn out a roasted dark color or not.  Mine did'nt, but it was still very good.

This was good, but think that the recipe could be improved upon by including brushing oil or butter on the bird. Also, we thought that the amount of rosemary was a bit overpowering.

Such a great starter recipe! I followed many of the other reviewer’s suggestions (using lemons, garlic cloves and olive oil.)  It turned out so beautiful, I didn’t want to cut it! (But, I’m glad I did because it was delicious!) Thanks to all the reviewers for the hints and thanks Nanette for a good recipe.

Made this last night. Delish ! So, moist and flavorful !
Used fresh rosemary inside and rubbed outside with salt, pepper, garlic powder and a little seasoning salt. Cooked on the grill in a roasting pan for 2 hours.

Excellent. I followed all the tips...a perfect roast chicken! However, I did have a 5 pound bird and was wondering how long to cook it. So I called a help line and they suggested 20 minutes per pound at 350 degrees. So I cant imagine cooking a 3 pound chicken for 2 and a half hours when mine took an hour and 20 minutes and was perfectly cooked...

A fantastic starting point. Resulted in a tender, flavorful, juicy chicken. I also used lemons and garlic inside, plus a cup of water in the pan. Rubbed olive oil on the skin. I baked it breast-side down for the first hour, so I didn't have to baste. The pan drippings were awesome.

Make it a meal for 4 and cook it faster. I rarely have 2 1/2 hours to cook a meal. I took 4 chicken breasts bone & skin on. Spray pam on shallow 11X 13 baking dish. Thinly slice medium onion. Line pan with onion, place chicken breasts on top of onion. Baste with olive oil. Sprinkle salt, pepper, some garlic powder, sprinkle dried rosemary crushing some to get flavor.Cook at 350 about 45 minutes, basting about 3 times every 10-15 minutes. Drain some of the juice after cooking 45 minutes,reserve, turn temp up to 400. Baste and cook another 15 minutes this makes skin crispy. While chicken is cooking microwave 4 yukon gold potatoes. After chicken has cooked 1 hour remove breasts to a platter. Leave onion and drippings in pan. Chop potatoes into bite size pieces. Stir into onions and drippings. I served it with some yellow squash and zuchinni thinly sliced and cooked on the grill brushed with olive oil, salt,pepper, and garlic. You don't have to grill but it gives them a good flavor. Used aluminum foil with holes poked in it to line the grill. Great meal in one hour if you do the potatoes and veggies while chicken cooks.

Very nice roasted chicken.  I added lemon slices under the skin along with the rosemary so the chicken breast was especially flavorful.  I think the seasonings need to be under the skin for the chicken to absorb much flavor.

Overall a good recipe. I brined my bird for 24 hours before roasting. The legs and thighs seemed to absorb more of the Rosemary flavour than the breast meat. I think next time I will stuff the bird and then let it set a few hours before baking. Thanks for the recipe!

SOOOOOO Tender!  I didn't have any FRESH rosemary and I added lemon wedges inside of the bird and butter in some slits on top of the bird!  I will make this again!  Very easy!  So delicious!

I have never made anything like this before and it was the best chicken I have ever had.  The rosemary makes all the difference.  I did place a whole stick of butter on top of the bird before i put it in the oven and basted it every half hour or so.  It was soooo good.  Even my picky wife couldn't get enough.

The aroma that filled the house while this was cooking was wonderful!  The flavor of the chicken was very nice, too.  I had been keeping my eyes open for an easy, yummy recipe for a whole chicken, and this one did the trick.

My husband and I love this recipe. Instead of cutting the onion into quarters, I diced it and also added a clove of minced garlic into the "stuffing". After the chicken was cooked, I tossed the onion, garlic, rosemary mixture with some rice and it was delicious as a side dish! The chicken stays unbelievably moist and the carcass makes a fantastic stock! This is going to be a regular dish.

This recipe is by far the best for roasted chicken and has been a family favorite which is frequently requested for dinner.  I tweaked it as other users had by placing butter and rosemary under the skin as well as stuffing lemon quarters and garlic in the cavity.  I receive many compliments along with hugs and kisses when I make this dish!!! Needless to say, this is the only way I will make my roasted chicken.

It was amazing! The juices were succulent. I followed it to the T and added the lemon, garlic  using the olive oil then added the potatoes with carrots at the last hour with chicken broth over them and salt and pepper to taste.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I love the addition of rosemary and went a bit further by adding sliced clementines under the skin and one in the cavity along with a hearty sprinkle of minced fresh garlic. It's a 5star in our home..

It doesn't get much easier than this. Great time saver for a delicious dinner. I also added a sliced orange to the onion and rosemary. Nothing beats the aroma of rosemary and orange.

This chicken turned out to be incredibly moist and tender. The rosemary, garlic, onion and lemon really infused the chicken with excellent flavors!  I did not chop my rosemary so I could remove it completely from the chicken cavity.  I placed a Weber chicken rub and olive oil on the outside skin.  Will definitely make this again.

Really easy and good - added a lemon and some garlic too in the stuffing.  Only issue is that potatoes didn't get very crisp as they were jammed around the bird.  But a hit nonetheless.

Absolutely delicious! I took a lot of the suggestions in the reviews and added lemon / garlic to the inside of the chicken, rubbed olive oil / rosemary on the outside of the chicken and baked the chicken with red potatoes / carrots. Also exchanged the water for chicken broth. It was Delicious and so easy to make.

LILQUIZ,
I would like to thank you for it! It was my first dish. Thanks to your directions and video, the cooking process was clear and easy. Chicken was juicy, not burnt, well cooked and in time.

Loved it, husband did too. I made as recipe says, but added minced garlic. I also melted a little coconut oil and mixed with more minced garlic and chopped rosemary & pepper and put it under the skin. Easy to prepare and smelled devine while roasting. Will be a regular in my chicken night rotation! I like the thought of doing two at a time so we can have it in a salad. Thanks for this easy and yummy recipe!

Very easy, very good, my children couldn't wait for it to be done.  I put quartered potatoes and apples, seasoned with olive oil, salt and pepper in the pan along with the chicken.  Next time I will try the lemon and garlic recommended by others.

I didn't have an onion, so I used a Fuji Apple instead.  The result was delicious.  A lot more liquid was created than I'd expected, though.  It made more like boiled chicken in that sense.

Fantastic. Followed others advice as well, my 5.5 lb chicken took the full 2.5 hours to cook to 160 (which is done at our house).  I made a gravy while my bird rested.  For gravy, pour out the chicken broth and juices. Extract approx 2 tbls of the fat from the top. Add to 2 tbls of flour. Cook for 1 min. Add 1 cup room temp milk or cream. Thicken over heat for five min. Add 1 cup of the broth chicken juice mixture. Salt and pepper to taste. And a dollop of daisy! Enjoy.

I followed advice of other reviewers and rubbed bird with olive oil, then rubbed with salt and pepper and rosemary.  I also brushed with melted butter....next time maybe just do the butter.  I stuffed cavity with mixture of salt, rosemary, onion, lemon, garlic, and a sprig of thyme.  Next time may try barefoot contessa recipe.

I made this for dinner last night and it was great.  As suggested by one reviewer, I wrapped the chicken in plastic wrap and refrigerated it overnight.  The chicken was extremely tender delicious, and moist.  I will make again.

This was delicious! I added some crushed garlic cloves under the skin. My 1 year old ate ALL the dark meat off the bird in one sitting! It was great, and a great way to use all the rosemary from the garden.

Great recipe!  I did what the other suggestions said, and covered the chicken in olive oil and then the salt and pepper.  I also added the lemon into the inside and outside of the chicken and roasted it with potatoes and carrots.

This is a great alternative to my usual butter and poultry seasoning massaged roast chicken.  It has  healthier taste using olive oil instead of butter.  I also add cloves of garlic in the cavity but I haven't tried it with lemons like other reviews mention. Tastes great - I've made it twice already.

Delicious! I had no sprigs of rosemary, so I stuffed the chicken with 1/2 of a large red onion (cut in wedges) and 3 pressed cloves of garlic.  I did not want to get my roasting pan out of storage, so I roasted the chicken on top of a bed of red potatoes in stoneware 9x12 pan.  THe chicken covered the potatoes and the results but great! But next time I will salt and pepper the potatoes before roasting. I set this up in less than 20 minutes, popped it in the oven, went to soccer practice, and came home to a wonderful aroma and a succulent main course. My chicken weighed about 5.3 pounds.

Adding a quartered lemon to the cavity definitely adds to the flavor and prevents drying. Also, roast breast side DOWN for the first 1 1/2 hours then turn, so as to avoid overcooking the white meet.

Hubby said best chicken he'd ever had.  Combined methods of 1st three reviewers: rub in lemon, oil, liberally salted & cracked pepper on top, put paste of rosemary/garlic/oil under skin.  Lemon/onion/garlic in salted cavity. Lemon quarters/potatoes/onions/celery on side w/ chicken broth.  Will add garlic pods next time.  Cooked 15 min at 450 without veggies in baking pan.  Added veggies & cooked 435 for another 15 and then 30 minutes at 350.  This was a 5 lb. pastured bird.  Delish!  Thanks so much for the recipe and tips!

Great basic recipe! I marinated the chicken the day before, so it had a lot of flavor. I stuffed the chicken with lemon pepper seasoning, fresh garlic, onion quarters, rosemary and lemon. I rubbed the outside with olive oil, fresh garlic, lemon pepper seasoning and rosemary. Cooked on rack and added 1 cup of chicken broth in the pan. Baked at 300 degrees for a little over 2.5 hours. It turned out very moist and delicious!

This was good enough, but not as exciting as I expected, based on some of the other reviews. Per others' suggestions, I added lemons, onion quarters, and garlic cloves to the cavity stuffing. Was still very tasty.

Definitely rub butter and rosemary under the skin.  I also sprinkled a little kosher salt on the chicken.  So moist, so tender, we really enjoyed it.  I'll make it for my in-laws next time they visit...that's how good it was!

Bottom Line...  For the newer cooks, this is the place to start... There are sooo many variables you can try... I use this recipe all the time... With Thyme instead of Rosemary...  And those onions?  Make sure there in your "Day after Chicken Soup"

I agree with the others MOIST & DELICIOUS!!!  Followed recipe exactly except for adding a quartered orange to the cavity.  I did use an oven bag.  The gravy from the drippings had loads of flavor.  And very easy, as well.

In response to the comment that 2.5 hours is too long to roast a chicken - I would like to say roasting time depends on where you live. I live at 6,000 feet above sea-level and 2.5 hours, or maybe even 3 hours sounds realistic to me.

Very moist, easy to make. I added olive oil to the garlic, rosemary and onions. I added potatos and baby carrots; salt and pepper! I also made an easy gravy (drippings, chicken broth and flour). I will be making this one again.

This is an easy meal to make that my family loves!  I usually make mashed red potatoes and add the a few of the cooked garlic cloves to them after I pull the chicken from the oven.  Thanks for a great Sunday dinner!

This was great. I bought a 3.4 lb Maverick organic whole chicken and incorporated several ideas in earlier reviews. I stuffed it with fresh chopped rosemary, onion quarters, two lemon halves (after using the juice!), and fresh garlic cloves!  Then I rubbed the outside with olive oil, put some rosemary on top, added a little organic chicken broth, some carrots and quartered red potatoes and cooked about 20 min per pound. It was really good. Could have used slightly more flavor--we don't add salt to our food but I bet you pepper would have done it. It was delicious and smelled great!

This was my first time roasting one whole chicken. I wouldn't say it was a fantastic roast but an average one.Perhaps it was due to my lack of experience in roasting. The vegetables trimming (potatoes & carrots) can out burnt (although quite tasty). I added lemons quarters, crushed garlic bulbs into the stuffings and rubbed olive oil, salt & pepper on the skin. I must give credit that the chicken was indeed tender and moist. The drippings were very good. On the other hand, the skin was not crispy as i have anticipated. Instead it was soft although with flavour. I served it with some garlic fried rice which was a splendid combination. My whole family commended that it was terrific but it was not fantastic for my standards. I may have to practice a few more times then!

We thought this was absolutely delicious. I also added a can of chicken broth and many cut potato wedges to the pan. However, I am rating it a 4 because the breasts turned out very dry, even though I cooked them breast side down. I would love someone's secret to juicy, tender breasts. Will make again,by the way, hopefully with a newfound secret to non-dry breasts. Excellent served w/ cranberry relish.

Excellent, I filled the roasting pan with carrots, yams, and potatoes and we all agreed that they were the best roasted vegetables ever!  I stuffed the bird with a bunch of fresh rosemary, onion, garlic, and  half a lemon - and rubbed the outside with an olive oil/paprika/brown sugar/salt & pepper paste.  Again, excellent!

Tasty chicken recipe. I had a 4 pounder that took 2:30 hours. I also stuffed with onion, rosemary and a halved lemon. Squeezing the juice of the lemon in and on the chicken, i also used fresh cracked black pepper in and on it too. I also put a few sprigs of rosemary between the skin and the flesh, along with a little pat of butter and a sprinkling of salt. Surrounded it with veggies that roasted while i cooked, and a little broth at the bottom of the pan for moisture.

This was just ok to me. I followed the advice of some and put carrots in the bottom of the pan while baking. Those were delicious! However the chicken had a very mild flavor. I could taste a subtle rosemary but I decided if I'm going to flavor my chicken I want an obvious strong flavor to it. I might make it again trying a different herb to see if it's just the rosemary I didn't like much.

Simple and delicious.  I added lemon slices and garlic in the cavity.  This was my first experience cooking an entire chicken.  As a former vegetarian, I've had a hard time getting over the bones.  I now feel empowered!  The meat fell right off the bones!  If you shy away from cooking the whole bird, you must try this.  It will change how you cook chicken forever!  It's moist and delicious and results in tons of chicken that can be used countless ways!

Great recipe. I used thyme instead of rosemary though...personal preference. I too added thyme, onion, garlic, celery and carrots to the cavity. Used an oil rub on the outside with more thyme/poultry seasoning. I did use about 1/2 cup chicken broth and 1/2 cup wine in the bottom, raised the chicken out of mixture with a rack. Did two small chickens. 1 for dinner, the other for soup. Amazing homemade broth when you make stock with veggies from inside birds. THE BEST stock I have ever made. Thanks for post.

I stuffed the cavity with onion, lemon, rosemary and sliced garlic.  Rubbed the outside with a mixture of olive oil, minced garlic and lemon juice.  Sprinkled rosemary, kosher salt and pepper.  About 2 hours for a 4.5 pound bird. Very good.

This was very moist and full of flavor. The rosemary was just right and not overpowering. The only thing I found was that the cooking time was a little much. I used a 5.5 lb. chicken, and 2 1/2 hours was just right for that...

Followed all the recommendations and used lemon, garlic, shallots and rosemary to stuff the chicken. Also put garlic and olive oil under the skin and rosemary on top. Followed the 20 minute/lb rule and the chicken came out beautifully. Everyone commented on how moist and tender it was and the flavour was excellent. Have not given 5 stars only because this wasn't the original recipe  - however the end result with all the changes certainly merits them.

Great juicy flavor.  As some other reviewers suggested I did rub chicken down with olive oil and also added some spices to the rub.  Husband devoured it and he's not the biggest chicken lover.  Thanks for the post.  5/13/06 Made mothers day dinner tonight for my daughters and mother-in-law. I had a Jennie O Turkey Breast and used this recipe for it.  It was moist, juicy and the flavors were great.  It was loved by all, the only thing I didn't have was fresh rosemary so I used dried.  Still came out great.  The flavor was just great.

This recipe is great!  I added a olive oil garlic/ herb rub under and on top of the skin.  This chicken is so tender and flavorful...My husband loves this and even eats the roasted rosemary...

The taste was very subtle. It smelled so delicious that I was fully expecting a big taste. I did as the other reviewers suggested and added chopped fresh garlic and fresh quarted lemon to the cavity of the chicken with some additional herbs patted onto the outer parts of the chicken and placed in a sealed bag for the majority of the day before cooking. It was good but not 5 stars, as the flavor was not as intense as I had hoped.

I usually just throw the chicken in the oven and let it go, but because a friend of mine gave me tons of rosemary from her garden, I had to try this recipe.  It definitely added a wonderful flavor to the meat.

Delicious! I made this last night and the whole family loved it. I did add fresh garlic and butter under the skin. I also followed the 20 minute/lb rule. It came out juicy and flavorful.

great recipe!  my family loves it!  i follow some of the recommendations that other people have listed (mostly using extra garlic cloves and lemons).  dry rosemary works just fine for me, and i also add rotisserie and cajun spices.  i have a personal rotisserie machine and it comes out PERFECT every time!  it tastes like chicken you'd eat at a gourmet restaurant!  this is a great recipe that i will use as long as im cooking!

Great - added a clove of fresh garlic to the stuffing, and basted with a can of chicken broth - came out very juicy.  Also placed root vegs, onion and a few more garlic cloves around chicken while roasting. 

4.5 lb. chicken at 350 for 1.5 hrs. I kept the chicken covered with foil for first 45 mins, and turned up to 420 for last 20 minutes.  Reduced the pan drippings / basting broth to gravy, adding some flour for thickness.

I made my first whole chicken with this recipe as basis and our guests were most impressed (that says a lot for my mum considering I've never cooked in my life till 2.5 years ago when we got married!)  

I've tweaked the recipe somewhat and it was really flavour-ful!!!  Rubbed the chicken the day before with 2 tsp paprika, 2 cloves chopped garlic, 1 tbsp olive oil, 0.5 tsp dried oregano, juice of 0.5 lemon.  The trick is to "massage" the chicken, especially at the joints, and ensure that the same is done just below the skin (breast area) and into the cavity as well.

I've also put some vegetables (the zucchini's were yummy!) at the sides with some chicken broth... the next time I do this, I'll ensure that they are cut into smaller pieces as they weren't as soft as I'd like them.  Will also allow the stuffing to "sit" in there for a couple of hours PRIOR to cooking.

This chicken was so delicious.  I could not beleive how much flavor the rosemary and onion added.  I also added garlic to the cavity and rubbed garlic powder, butter and sage all over the outside of the chicken.  I also basted with the pan juices and chicken broth.  This was a smash hit with my husband, eight year old daughter and her two friends.  This is a definate keeper.  I served this with green beans and Bellas Rosemary Red Potatoes from this site.

Good!  Our grocery store was out of fresh rosemary so just used salt, pepper, and a little chicken broth and butter to baste with.  Enjoyed this and used the leftover chicken and broth for chicken tortilla soup.

Wonderful recipe.  The chicken was very flavorful and juicy.  I used a 4 3/4 lb. chicken and baked it 375 degrees for 2 hours.  I also brushed a bit of melted butter on the bird half way through roasting.  Delicious.

Excellent recipe. The leftovers the next day are even better. I also lightly basted the bird with olive oil prior to roasting, and added some lemon wedges to the inside.

Good, reliable recipe. I've been trying all sorts of recipes for roasted chicken and this is my favorite. It came out nice and juicy. I did add the following: massaged the chicken with butter beforehand, added herbs de provence to the cavity in addition to the rosemary and onion, and added some slices of lemon as well. perfect!

I was originally making this chicken for a friend, but once I smelled how good it was, I went and bought a chicken to make one for myself.  I basted mine with olive oil and instead of fresh rosemary, I used 2 tbsp. of dried rosemary.  It was EXCELLENT!!!

This is the best chicken recipe I've ever made, and the first one to be successfully moist and just PERFECT.  The skin was light brown and crispy and the meat was SO tender.  Great subtle flavor.  My husband and I devoured it!

WONDERFUL! This was my first attempt at roasting a chicken and my husband and I were very impressed. The meat was moist and flavourful and the recipe was extremely simple to follow. The pan drippings made for wonderful gravy and the smell was mouthwatering. Thank you for sharing this delightful recipe.

Great flavors, and what could be better than a roasted chicken?! Such a bargain both in cost and effort. I always either make broth afterwards, or freeze the carcass to do so. The chicken gets double duty that way!

The only comment that I would make is that newer thinking based on studies suggest we should not be rinsing our chickens... doesn't really make them more sanitary, but it does through microscopic droplets of chicken juice everywhere in your kitchen. Instead just pat dry and cook.

This chicken was exceptionally delicious, and very easy to prepare.  It was done 'just right'. I added a bit of garlic powder & some chopped parsley into the rub.  I love rosemary, especially with chicken, so we loved the flavor.  I roasted my chicken in the oven (on a rack over a sheet pan).  I had a 5 lb. chicken, so I used my meat thermometer .  I roasted the chicken until it reached an internal temperature of at least 155 degs.  I then took it out of the oven and (loosly) tented it with aluminum foil (while I was mashing potatoes, and tending to my other side dishes).  By 'resting' under the aluminum foil, my chicken reached the safe eating  temperature of 165 deg.  It was juicy & delicious.

Simple, elegant in its simplicity, this is a wonderful dish to pop on and let bake away in the background on a Saturday afternoon while tending to chores around the house.  Lots of room for customizations, but also perfect simply as is.

So simple, so delicious! I rubbed the turkey with a high quality olive oil then sprinkled the rosemary as well as some fine celtic salt over the outside.  I didn't stuff the interior.  Baked at 350 for 2 1/4 hours and it was perfect!  Thanks so much for the recipe ideas!

Loved the simplicity of this dish. I also rubbed the bird with olive oil. Added chicken broth to roasting pan and roasted carrots and potatoes with it. Really enjoyed this one.

Good basic roast chicken!  I added garlic and lemon and onion and placed butter slices under the skin.  Came our moist and tender.  I roasted potatoes and carrots with it and had a whole meal in one pan.

I liked this as a base recipe.  I took suggestions from other reviews & tweeked for what I had on hand.  I made the following changes:  stuffed with onion, bunch parsley, lemon salt (no lemon on hand), celery.  I made a mixture of salt, pepper, rosemary and garlic powder and put this under breast skin and over entire chicken.  Placed chicken on a bed of onions, celery, carrots & 2 c. broth.  2 1/2 hours in covered dutch oven-like pot then a bit of broiler browning.  Delight and super easy.

I was afraid the chicken wouldn't crisp up because it didn't require any fat being rubbed on the chicken the way most recipes would.But I was trying to cook low fat for my husband. In spite all my fears, it turned out crisp and juicy,and with less calories.This one's a keeper!

Outstanding chicken!  Very easy to make - like others suggested - I stuffed onion, lemon, garlic, salt, and rosemary into the cavity and rubbed olive oil, salt, pepper, and rosemary onto the skin.  Meant to put breast side down but forgot - even still it was super moist!  Next time (breast down) it will be even better.

Followed the main review, except for adding the lemons, as we didn't have any on hand.  Delicious.  For a 5lb chicken should have cooked it for 1 1/2hrs, as the internal thermometer went off, but we kept cooking it to keep with the recipe directions. The meat was dried out.

I followed the advice and brined my chicken also. I had a 5 lb bird. I used minced garlic, dried rosemary, 2 lemon halves and 1/4 onion to stuff the bird. I also squeezed the lemon juice out and poured it over the bird. I drizzled olive oil over it and seasoned w/ S&P. I did stuff garlic and rosemary under the skin of the thighs and breasts. In my oven at 350, with the convection fan on, it reached 165 internally in only 1 hr and 10 minutes. Way faster than I thought it would. But I left it in for another 20 minutes while I scrambled to finish the rest of dinner. I put the bird breast side up on a rack in an open roasting pan with just about a cup of water added to the pan. I basted the chicked only one time. It was moist and tender and so tasty. I will be using this again! Thank you for a great recipe!

My family of 4 ate every bite of the chicken no leftovers.  I sprinkled salt and added a washed and pierced lemon with the onion in the cavity before cooking so juicy and flavorful, wish I would have made 2 chickens not just one.

I also followed many of the recommendations by stuffing the bird with rosemary, onions, lemon and 4 garlic cloves.  I rubbed the outside with olive oil and fresh lemon juice and seasoned with salt and pepper and fresh chopped rosemary. It turned out very juicy and had tons of flavor.

Very good as written.  Second time I made it, I stuffed cavity with several springs of rosemary (much easier than chopping) and put a couple of tablespoons of butter under chicken skin on breast and spritzed skin with olive oil.  Came out moist with crispy skin.  (I used a 4 pound chicken and cooked for about 2 1/2 hours.

This one baffles me as to why people liked it, as the recipe merely calls for putting seasonings into the chicken cavity and then doing nothing more with it.  So little of what you put in the cavity of the chicken seeps into the chicken meat itself during roasting that the it's largely wasted.  You might as well just salt and pepper the chicken and stick it in the oven - all you would lose is a nice smell while it cooks, but the affect on the meat would be unnoticeable.  Now if you're going to use the droppings to make a gravy or stuffing, then the seasoning suddenly is leveraged and adds to the dish and this might be good - I made a gravy of it and it was perfectly tasty, albeit nothing unforgettable.  As the directions stand now, however, all this is is a recipe for generic roast chicken that will smell nicely of rosemary and onions while cooking.

Yummy! I'm very excited because this is the first time I've cooked a whole chicken, and it came out great. I took the advice of others and stuffed with garlic and squeezed lemon peels along with the rosemary and onion. I could really taste the flavors in the meat. I also rubbed lemon, olive oil, salt & pepper on the outside of the chicken before roasting.

A big hit at my house!  I stuffed my bird as full as I could get it with lemons, onions, garlic, rosemary, kosher salt, and freshly grated black pepper.  Then I rubbed it down with mixture of olive oil, lemon juice reserved from the lemon halves stuffed inside the bird, minced garlic, and rosemary.  I placed the chicken breast down on a rack in the baking dish, lightly sprinkled kosher salt over the outside,  and surrounded it with baby carrots, cubed red potatoes (skins on) and sliced onions.  I poured a can of chicken broth over the vegetables, put it in the oven, baked it covered until the internal temp reached 160.  Then I uncovered it and baked it until the skin was light brown and crispy and the internal temp was near 170.  Let it sit for 15 minutes (temp reaches 170 while sitting), and it was ready to serve.  I served this with long grain brown rice.  The liquid around the veggies is very thin, broth-like but the flavor is exellent and worked really well with the brown rice.  It could be thickened into a gravy or sauce, but I left it thin for fewer fats and carbs.  The meat was incredibly juicy and flavorful.  My husband raved! A side of baked apples was a great sweet-but-not-too-sweet complement to the savory flavor of the chicken and veggies.  Thanks for this great recipe!

I took the advice of some others and rubbed the outside of the bird with olive oil. Then I squeezed 1/2 of a large lemon over the chicken and sprinkled with dried rosemary, garlic salt, and fresh ground black pepper. I added about 1/2 cup of water to the bottom of the pan and basted every 20 - 30 minutes. I kept the lid on the chicken for the first 1.5 hours and removed the lid for the last 1/2 hour to brown. I let it sit for 15 minutes with tin foil tented over top to keep warm before cutting into it. OMG, this was THE best chicken I have ever tasted. So flavorful, juicy, and aromatic. The meat just fell right off the bone, which made it difficult for carving and presentation, but who cares when it tastes THAT good!

I don't care for a whole chicken but this sounded so good.  I stuffed inside with unpeeled garlic, onions, lemons and fresh rosemary.  Rubbed olive oil and garlic and lemon pepper on top and rubbed some butter under skin.  I added more rosemary to the top and baked for 1 hour at 350 covered.  Added red potatoes and carrots and some chicken broth and baked another hour.  Broiled for a few minutes at end to crisp up skin.  Super good!!

I gave this 3 stars for the taste... I knew going into this that it would be too bland for our tastes so I did what others suggested... I put 1 lemon, 1 onion, 2 garlic cloves, parsley, salt and pepper inside the bird and I rubbed extra virgin olive oil on the outside of the bird and put one chopped up garlic clove, parsley, salt and pepper on the outside of the bird. I put it in a covered dutch oven roasting pan and put baby carrots all around it and baked it at 350 degrees for 2 hours. It cooked PERFECTLY! BUT.... I was surprised it was still too bland for our tastes. If you have never roasted a chicken before DEFINATLY give this recipe a try and know that you can add whatever you like to make it your own. I never stuffed the inside of a bird before and the bird was soooooo juicy,  I'll definatly be doing that from now on. And the carrots were Excellent, again I've never done that before so I'll also be doing that from now on. Just know if you like alot of spice or taste you'll Definatly need to use your own ingredients!

I used dried rosemary, lemon juice that comes in a bottle, minced garlic in a bottle.  I put rosemary, fresh sea salt, fresh pepper, olive oil and garlic on top of chicken.  I put lemon juice, onion powder, rosemary and butter on the inside.  I made sure to cover the chicken for most of the baking.  Last minute I broiled the chicken to get the crispy skin.  Don't fret about not using fresh ingredients because the chicken comes out just as good, I'm sure.

This was a pretty good chicken recipe. I went along with another suggestion and put it in a roasting pan surrounded with chicken stock and vegetables. The vegetables were so flavorful and delicious from cooking in the broth and the chicken was juicy!

So tender and moist. Very nice. I also stuffed in a lemon as I usually do and garlic cloves. As some other reviewers suggested I too added some stock and used it to baste. Lots of potatoes, carrots and onions roasted along side in the pan and it's the perfect sunday dinner.  Thanks for posting it.

The chicken needed lots of basting to stay moist, but over all it was so good!  I would add more rosemary then called for, but that's just me.

Well this was my first time dealing with a whole chicken - apparently not a good enough cook not to be completely grossed out by it!!!  but all that aside, i did the recipe as by other reviewers (except just didn't have any lemons) YUMMY!

This recipe was great. I had never made one of these before but it was much easier than i ever thought it could be. I spinkled the lemon and the onion with the rosemary and I rubbed the outside skin with olive oil before i put on the salt, peper and rosemary. I also wrapped the wings with foil and cooked for the first hour with the lid on. The second hour the lid came off as did the foil on the wings. I will be making this over and over again.

I stuffed the chicken with one lemon (halved), 1 med. onion (quartered), 3 or 4 garlic cloves, about 1 TBSP dried rosemary, salt & pepper. Then I covered the chicken in olive oil, salt & pepper, dried rosemary and a little lemon juice. I cooked it on a rack with a few chopped carrots in the bottom. Next time I will not use carrots because it made the broth too sweet. I do not think I will add the lemon next time either.

I did few changes to this recipe. I had a 6 pound chickenI added 4 garlic cloves with the chopped onion and rosemary. I poured 1 lime and 1 orange all over the bird salt, pepper, oil and dust paprika all over as well. I put it in the preheated oven 350 degrees for an hour and for 3 other hours @ 250 degrees....cover with aluminum foil at all times.  This chicken was the most moist bird we have ever had....Do it just like I'm telling you and you will be impress with yourself!!!

Great way to prepare chicken for recipies that call for "cooked" chicken.  Mine didn't have a lot of flavor, and I followed others' advice regarding adding garlic to cavity, rubbing some rosemary and olive oil under the skin of the breasts, etc.  I have another recipe I will be more prone to use in the future...

This recipe is excellent. It is even better when the pieces are reheated the next day. The juices from this recipe should be kept and reused for recipes that call for chicken stock. I used fresh rosemary that remained from our summer garden and it made the whole dish spectacular.

My sons ate every bite.  I didn't have fresh rosemary, but dried worked great.  I seasoned inside & out per the recipe.  I squeezed 1/2 lemon over it and then placed the lemon and onion inside.  I poured a cup of water over it.  My 4.5 lb bird baked 2 hrs.  I poured the juices into a saucepan, heated to boiling and then added a cup of milk with 2 tbs. flour whisked in to make a yummy rosemary lemon gravy.

Wow! This is without any doubt the best roasted chicken my wife and I have cooked. In addition, and as other reviewers mentioned, we added lemon (two slices), a little of fresh sage under the skin, and to cloves of garlic with the onions and rosemary. We also brushed the chicken with a little olive oil. Cooking time: 2 hours 20 min at 350F. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I'm only rating this a four because I followed other reviewer's recipes more than the original.  I copied many others in adding lemon husks inside (juice on top) as well as several cloves of garlic.  The skin was DE-LISH.  I know that's the bad part and I shouldn't but I can't help myself :)  Either way, tasty chicken as well.  I put dried rosemary (grocer was out of fresh) and garlic powder under the skin as well.  Wonderful.  A little dry, but that was my fault, as I'm paranoid and this was a five pound bird, so it was slightly overcooked.

This makes a moist and flavorful chicken.  Only change was to rub some olive oil with rosemary, sage and thyme under the skin of the chicken.  The aroma while the chicken was cooking was wonderful.

I used this recipe for our Christmas dinner as we're not too fond of turkey and needed just a small amount of meat.  Everyone loved it and I was happy to make something special and homemade for Christmas, but for everyday eating, I will rely on the roasted chickens I can buy already cooked from Sam's Club.  I buy them often and use the meat for chicken salad and casseroles.  They are plump and jucy, and a whole lot less trouble.  But for a homemade meal, this recipe is excellent.

Easy, versatile and you really can't mess this up at all!!

I usually butter it up like a turkey first (well it's not really butter, it's country crock).  I have thrown the powdered gravy over the potatoes w/ some chicken broth, or some cream of mushroom over them as well.

When I made this I lifted the skin of the chicken and placed a good size sprig of rosemary under before cooking. I also placed an extra sprig inside the chicken along with the stuffing. Delicious.

Delicious, tender, juicy. Perfect! I'm not very good at cooking chicken, it usually turns out dry. But this was perfect. Its nice to slow cook it on a day off, its well worth it. I served it with mashed potatoes, green beans and gravy! yum!

Followed other reviewers' suggestions and added celery, garlic, and preserved lemon (since I didn't have a fresh one...) to the cavity.  Made small slits in the bird and stuffed in small pieces of garlic.  Also tucked pats of butter under the breast skin.  Cooked as per recipe and the end result was unusually good.  The breast meat was fairly juicy and hubby really enjoyed the leg quarter.  Very nice!

Brining made the chicken much more moist the second time I made this recipe. I also added Herbs de Provence to the fresh rosemary and roasted over stock. Olive oil mix with kosher salt, garlic, rosemary lemon juice and minced onion makes a nice addition too!!

We cooked this in our pressure cooker. It was fantastic. We made chicken fayitas with the leftovers. As well, you can use the chicken for chicken soup or chicken subs.

This is a very good recipe. I wouldn't have even bothered with it if I hadn't read the author's subtitle story about how they serve this in Vicenza. I made good use of my rosemary bushes for this. Normally my husband doesn't care for the herb at all but I don't think he noticed it because I made a paste of it with a bit of water and my coffee grinder. I poured most of it into the cavity of the bird with onion and carrot and put the rest on top with salt pepper and a touch of garlic powder. I highly recomend using a meat thermometer with a tempreture alarm because my chicken was done at 350 after just over 90 minutes in the oven not the 2 hours stated in the recipe. Happy Cooking!!

I made this on Sunday for my mom and sister and kids and had RAVE reviews.  It was wonderful.  I changed it a little.  I added some crushed garlic to the cavity, along w/a red onion and some butter.  I also put some butter under the skin and drizzled the top of the bird w/EV Olive Oil and sprinkled more rosemary on the outside.  I had a 5lb bird and it was ready in 2 and 1/2 hours.  Wonderful flavor.  Also added carrots to the baking dish they were delish!

I used this receipe just this past weekend.  The only things I did differently was to add a sliced potato to the bottom of my pan and omitted the salt and peper (personal choice & dietary needs)
THIS CHICKEN LITTERALLY FELL OFF THE BONES! There was enough left over for seconds! A deffinate must for anyone who wants a great chicken that is quick and easy.

Outstanding! The chicken was incredibly moist, and the flavor was immersed throughout.  I rubbed olive oil on the chicken and rubbed in garlic salt and pepper.  The only bad thing is that this takes 2 hours + to cook because the smell is so good!  I turned up the heat to 375 at two hours and cooked for another 15 minutes.  This helped browned the chicken a little more and cooked the chicken to 180.  I like cooking mine on a broiler pan because it allows the skin to become a little crisp.  This is better than the roitisserie chicken we pick up.  My children loved it as well.  It's a keeper!

Awesome chicken. The flavor of the rosemary really came through. I also added lemon slices in the cavity. I rubbed the bird down with garlic powder, onion powder, kosher salt, and some dried rosemary. This chicken is delicious.

This recipe is perfect as far as timing and technique. I added celery, carrot, onions, and 1/2 lemon, fresh herbs, salf, and pepper to the cavity while roasting. Sometimes I cut slits under the skin in five or six places and slip some butter underneath. I also covered the chicken with foil until the last half hour of roasting.
Soooooo good!

Great recipe.  This has become our "regular" chicken recipe.  The onion/rosemary in the cavity really gives the chicken a great flavour.  Even better, the drippings make the best tasting gravy.

The only thing we change is to pat the chicken down with some herbs, etc.

I also followed the variation by MOLLYES. I made a couple of changes myself, I also scattered some of the rosemary ontop of the breasts, then i covered it in about 5 rashers of bacon with the rind cut off. After 2 1/2 hours in the oven the bacon was like cured ham, the chicken was awesomely succulent and infused with all the flavours. Probably the nicest roast chicken I've ever tasted.

i love this recipe, ive made it twice. the first time i used an oven, the second time i used a microwave oven. i thought it might be no good in the microwave, but it was delicious.

I used the 20 minutes per pound rule, as my chook was massive (i was lucky it fit into the microwave at uni!!). i stuffed it with onion slices, celery sticks (for moisture) and rosemary. to get as much flavour as possible, i stuffed the cavity so full it was a real struggle to fit anymore in.

it helps to add the stuffing evenly, so all the onion isnt at one end and the rosemary at the other. definately use fresh rosemary, you can usually buy it at the supermarket if you dont have access to a bush.

i mixed a high quality olive oil with sea salt and cracked pepper and rubbed it all over the chicken. i put onion slivers and rosemary under the skin and into the flesh, leaving about an inch and a half between each. 

I used the left over rosemary on the outside of the chicken, tucking it into the wings and drumsticks, and resting it on top. my chook turned out with a strong (but not overpowering) flavour.

i cooked the chook on a rack so the bottom would crisp up rather than sit in the juices. i used the juices to create a wonderful pan gravy using chicken stock and gravy flour, salt and pepper.

my housemates (who are boys) absolutely loved it, and had half devoured it before i even had a chance to cut it up! i served what was left of it (!!) with baked onion, potato and honey carrots.

Wonderful roast chicken. Served to rave reviews and the house smelled wonderful while it cooked. My onions in the center didn't really get done, but that was fine. Threw some carrots into the pan for roasting. Also took advice in reviews and rubbed olive oil and rosemary under the skin -- quite an adventure for a vegetarian reverse-convert. Followed the 20 min. per pound rule. Only wish I could have found a bigger bird -- at close to a 4 lb. chicken, I was cutting it close for dinner for 6. Will definitely make this one again. I love the oven -- so great for low maintenance meals.

This is simple, yet so good. I bake my chicken with the usual veggies: carrots, celery, onions, garlic, and potatoes, and sprinkle them with the rosemary.  Great dinner in one pan.

First time I ever roasted a chicken and it came out amazing. I couldn't believe it was this easy! I did not have fresh rosemary and used dried...not the same, so I would definitely try to find fresh, or use three times the amount of dried you think you would need. My roasting pan and rack are huge, so I added 1 can condensed chicken broth plus 2 cans water to the bottom so the drippings wouldn't dry up and burn. Also a few chunked potatoes, carrots and onions. 350 degrees for 2.5 hours, basting every 30 minutes is perfect for an almost 5lb bird. I've made this a few times now, and have added different spices and goodies each time (olive oil, garlic, lemon, dressing, etc), and it still comes out great.

I agree, this is very good, and easy as well... I took a lot of the suggestions of the other cooks (rubbing garlic, butter, olive oil, and rosemary under the skin, for one), and we enjoyed it a lot.

A keeper!  So good ~ whole family loved it.  Following suggestions of others, I added lemon slices & garlic to the cavity & put slivers of butter & garlic under the skin.  Easy to make & very satisfying.

First time roasting a chicken and my husband said it was the best he ever had!  Per other cooks suggestions I added lemon and garlic to the cavity, rubbed rosemary and olive oil under and on top of the skin.  Turned the heat up the last 20 mins.  Beautiful!

WOW! this was great! We took the other suggestions and also stuffed the chicken with a lot of garlic and lemon slices in addition to the rosemary and onion. We also put some rosemary and a few slices of butter under the skin. We had a little over 4 lbs. of chicken and it cooked at 350 for exactly 1 hour and 40 minutes and was delicious! Will definitley make again. Thanks.

This has become a favorite at our house.  Since discovering this reciepe a month ago we have had it twice, and we are making it tonight.  The only thing we do different to add more flavor is place a stick of butter mixed w/rosemary under the skin --- yummy!

Delicious! I modified it a bit. I softened about 2 1/2 Tbsp. butter and added some rosemary, poulty seasoning, parsley and some italian seasonings to the butter to make a herbed butter. I rubbed that under the skin to the breast and a bit inside the cavity. It makes the chicken even more tender and tasty. Add whatever spices you want! It is  such an easy, delicious dinner!

This was my first time roasting a whole chicken -- turned out splendidly. I stuffed mine with a Vidalia (sweet) onion, a yellow apple, and dried rosemary. More of the stuffing was used under the skin.

I made chicken stock a few days ago and added that to the bottom of the pot and sprayed the skin with olive oil and lemon juice. As it cooked, I basted it a few times.

Husband loved it and asked only that the skin be crispier next time I prepare it. (I'll cook it uncovered near the end.) This was prepared in a small Romertopf baker.

Thanks, Nanette!

Easy.  I made this with bone-in chicken breasts.  I added a few garlic cloves, a little lemon juice & poured white wine into the pan.  I didn't need to baste- there was a generous amount of wine, covered it didn't evaporate out of the dish.  I had fresh rosemary in the juice, dried rosemary sprinkled on top- also made subbing the fresh for dry rosemary.  The smell when it's cooking is wonderful.  Already had requests for the recipe.

very, very good!!  i also placed some butter and fresh rosemary under the skin of the breast of the bird before baking.  next time i will try including the lemon and lemon juice like others had done to see what that does.  but i must say this was simple and absolutely wonderful too both your sense of smell and your appetite!! thanks for sharing!!!  also, i used alot of garlic salt and ground black pepper on top of the bird after rubbing it with olive oil before baking!!

I hate to say I was let down after reading all the reviews and taking the advice of others. It wasn't bad it just wasn't that good. I guess I was expecting a taste explosion after reading the reviews. I'll keep looking for a good baked chicken recipe.

This was very good and moist - but it lacked flavor.  I did as suggested and put a butter/rosemary  mixture under the skins and stuffed the bird with LOTS of onion, garlic and lemon...but it still wasn't flavorful as I hoped.  I'll try applying more seasoning next time.

Great roast chicken. I smothered the chicken with margarine and seasoned inside and outside with paprika and Garlic Garlic from Tastefully Simple, sprinkled dried oregano and placed it in a covered clay baker. Then I did nothing until the chicken was done. I kept the chicken in the covered baker for about 15 minutes before serving. The flavor of rosemary was strong and the whole house still smells like a roast chicken. This is going to be my regular recipe when I have a craving for roast chicken.

EXCELLENT!!!  I also rubbed butter, garlic and rosemary under the chicken skin and basted with 1/2 c. chicken broth. I also arranged vegetables (carrots, celery, red potatoes) around chicken and trussed with butcher's twine prior to roasting.  I cooked 2 chickens and used the 2nd to make "Hearty Turkey Soup with Parsley Dumplings--submitted by Christin L."  This was an excellent use of the dish for a second meal!  This is FABULOUS!!!!

This was just OK. I tried my best to zip it up, Squeezing lemon juice over the bird & adding the lemons inside the cavity along with the onions & rosemary.  I basted frequently and roasted over 2 hours.  It came out moist but not particularly flavorful.  Still looking for a GREAT roast chicken recipe.

I made this for a family Birthday party and it was big hit!  I did add some garlic to the "stuffing"  and when the chickens were done I made a great side dish of rice with the "stuffing" mixture like someone else had done, and it needs a 5 star rating of its own!!

I used a five pound chicken and it cooked great in two hours! This was wonderful served with new red potatoes! The meat was moist and really delicious!

This chicken turned out moist, but to me it was pretty basic -- not a lot of flavor.  I make a wonderful roasted chicken in a rotisserie and my family likes that so much better -- it has more flavor and is much juicier.

This recipe makes the house smell so good, and everyone was so impressed with how moist the chicken turned out.  And the juices make a fabulous gravy.

Delicious and moist! I think the onion gives off moisture as it bakes and keeps the chicken moist. Very easy as I have some rosemary growing outside my front door! I;ve made a chicken and a turkey this way. When doing turkey I rub the skin with olive oil first.

Very simple recipe.   I made slight changes according to other reviewers because I don't make whole chickens very often. I added a garlic clove to the inside and oiled the outside of the chicken before salt and peppering.  Cooked at 450 for 15 mins then reduced to 350 for the remaining time.  I followed the 20 minutes per pound cooking rule and then let it rest for 20 mins and it was perfect.

Glorious in every way! Don’t forget to baste every 20 minutes or so. It makes a difference! (I follow other reviews suggestions to add lemon and garlic and roast veggies and potatoes along the bottom of the pan with the chicken on a rack.)

It was delicious. I made it according to the recipe, but did used a covered roasting pan instead of broiler. The combination of potatoes, onions and apples was fabulous.

Delicious! The carrots were a little under done because I used a roasting pan that was waaaay too big. But the bird came out with crispy skin and tender, moist meat all around. I made a delicious gravy out of the drippings and we could taste the fresh rosemary. Easy and adult & kid approved.

This was incredible. It fell off the bone and was quite tasty. I pulled it out at an hour 45 and used the juices to baste the rest of the chicken. Then I put it back in for 15 minutes. Was perfectly cooked.

The only change I made was to add a little garlic salt.  The chicken was falling off the bone tender, and was very good.  This was the first chicken I ever roasted, and I will definitely do it again.

Excellent, even though I had quarter chicken and did not have rosemary.  Substituted with thyme and some tarragon.  The chicken meat and vegetables were perfectly cooked and flavorful!  Made a little gravy from the drippings, which turned out to be a nice topper to the meal!  Looking forward to preparing this meal with the right ingredients next time!  Definitely a repeater!

Came out delicious and juicy! I added more rosemary so the flavor really could come through in the meat

I did mix a little olive oil with fresh rosemary, salt and pepper and spread it on the outside of the chicken as well.   Was moist, flavorful.

This is an excellent, easy recipe!  First time I followed the recipe exactly with wonderful results.  Next time I rubbed Penzey's Fox Pointe Seasoning on the outside too and WOW!  Also baked for 3 hrs since I cook these really huge home-grown chickens.  Will back on a rack next time.

SO SO SO GOOD! 
I have to say, I have NEVER eaten a chicken drumstick where the meat would literally fall off...
Then again, it depends on your oven. Our landlord was so kind in giving us a new oven that had a convection setting which distributed the air equally. 

Did this for the family and they wanted more.. unfortunately there was none left! haha

This was good although I prefer my simple garlic roasted chicken.  I use 4-5 cloves of garlic, make slits in chicken in which to stuff garlic pieces, throw some pieces in the body cavity, and bake in same manner as this recipe.  I think I'll try adding some fresh rosemary also.  Thanks for recipe.

I made this with a few adjustments. I mixed olive oil, tbsp paprika, tbsp rosemary, tbsp lemon juice 2 cloves diced garlic, and salt and pepper and rubbed it above and under the skin and in the cavity. Then I put an onion and lemon in the cavity. Cooked an hour and a half. Was so juicy and flavorful

I cooked this in a toaster oven so I think it cooked faster than regular oven. Nice taste, I just wished the flavors cooked through more. The juices taste good.

I did a combination of 2 recipes and the result was juicy, tasty roast chicken that my friends loved!  The combination of this and Happy Roast Chicken!  It's super fast to prepare, and tasted heavenly.  I stuffed the chicken with lemon and rosemary, and rubbed Dijon mustard all over the chicken before roasting it in a pan.   It turned out cooked just right!

Rubbing the bird with olive oil and adding chopped basil, per another reviewer's suggestion, was great. I too added lemons to the cavity along with onions. Delicious and simple! Company quality for sure!

This recipe is easy, delicious, and my family loved it!  I made 2 chickens at once by doubling the recipe and laying the chickens side by side in the roasting pan. I will definitely make this one again.

This was okay. I didn't honestly taste that much Rosemary from stuffing it inside the chicken. I tasted a little more on the skin from adding some outside. A bit of rosemary that got on my potatoes & carrots outside the bird was more flavorful. Maybe adding Rosemary to surrounding veggies yields greater results?

I made this over the weekend- and it was AMAZING! I did use some of the extra ingredients that other reviewers have mentioned- such as using a little bit of olive oil and lemon juice along w the salt and pepper and rubbing down the chicken- the skin was wonderfully crispy and beautiful while the inside was so juicy! And I also added half a lemon into the cavity along with the onion and rosemary. I also roasted baby red potatoes on the bottom of the roasting pan which I just barely seasoned and drizzled a little olive oil over then- they came out delicious as well! I can't wait to make this again!

I loved this recipe, but my wife thought there was way too much rosemary, and my dog wouldn't touch it.  That may now seem germaine, but we feed our dog what we eat (less foods/spices that are taboo for dogs). Next time out, I'll use my own stuffing mix and include only 1 tsp rosemary and 1 tbsp tarragon; 4 slices of rosemary/olive bread, diced small; saute 1 sm onion, 1 stalk of celery and 4-5 cloves garlic (minced) until lightly brown, salt and pepper to taste; 1/4 apple, pealed and sliced thin.  To this mix add 1/4 c beer (lager) and 1 shot of Jim Beam.  If the mix needs more moisture, I add milk as needed.  With these proportions, everyone in my family is happy and nothing is wasted but the bones.  I love Italian food/recipes, but that was just outrageously over rosemaried for us.

This is so simple and delicious! I just used chicken breasts and covered them in onions and rosemary. I added it to my salad today and it was amazing. Tonight I will make chicken salad. I really need to watch my sodium intake and was so happy to find a recipe that is simple and delicious without all the soups, etc. Thank you!

This is my go-to chicken recipe. I use the same one for turkey, adjusting cooking time. It's super easy and delicious. Homegrowm rosemary makes a huge difference compared to dried rosemary.

This turned out very bland. The texture of the chicken was good, but the flavor was unimpressive.  Next time I'll try it with some more seasoning.

This dish was delicious and succulent.  I followed the recipe to the tee with the following exceptions.  In addition to salt and pepper on top of the chicken, I also added a sprinkling of garlic salt and pepper.  I also used a blend of fresh garlic, rosemary, thyme, and sage herbs to add inside the cavity of the bird, in addition to sweet onion.  I followed other reviewers recommendations and placed fresh rosemary right under the skin of the chicken and added chicken broth to the bottom of the roasting dish.  While roasting I basted the chicken every 25 - 30 minutes and also used an injector to further add flavor to the meat of the bird.  I cooked it for about 1 1/2 hour and then an additional 30 minutes uncovered to brown the skin.  Once done, the meat was so tender and nearly fell apart while carving.  It was even more tasty the next day.  I highly recommend!

I used olive oil, fresh rosemary, garlic both in cloves and minced over the bird's meat (I removed the skin), a lot of salt and pepper. On the cavity onions, garlic, rosemary, lime, salt and pepper. I added carrots and potatoes an hour before it was done. It turned out spectacular! My family loved it. Highly recommended.

This was the first time I ever roasted a chicken. It was super easy to follow and so delicious. My family was so happy and are already asking when we are having this again. I cooked it at 350 for 2 1/2 hours and the Chicken was super juicy. I rubbed some olive oil on the skin and sprinkled it with salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic salt, and paprika. The skin was crisp and delicious. Can't wait to make again!

I made this tonight for dinner and it was really good.  I made some adjustments like putting garlic and Italian seasoning with olive oil on top.  I also cut up potatoes and carrots and put around the bottom with the chicken on a rack.  Turned out super moist and delicious!  Thanks so much!!

This was very good.  I took suggestions from some other reviewers and added lemon halves and minced garlic to the onions and rosemary I stuffed it with.  I also rubbed the outside with the juice from half the lemon, jarred minced garlic and dried rosemary in addition to the salt and pepper.  Added chicken stock to the pan and some cut up potatoes and baby carrots.  Should have added the carrots later, though, as they shriveled up to tiny sticks.  Still tasted good though.

This was very simple and VERY delicious. I only used a pinch of salt and pepper, and will likely use more salt next time. The chicken was juicy and flavorful, and the meat was literally falling off of the bone. I was able to shred leftovers to make chicken sandwiches for lunch, too!

I made this and to the cavity I added Lemon & crushed garlic besides the Rosemary and Onion.  Mine was a 4 1/4 lb Organic chicken.  It turned out excellent.  My kitchen smelled so good.  I followed this recipe pretty much except adding the above additions.  We are having the left overs tonight.  YUM

A lot of work. I'd prefer to buy a store bought chicken but the flavour was awesome (I added tarragon) and the meat was very moist. I started at 450 then moved down to 425.  Will keep it at 450 next time and it will be done 15 min. sooner.

I made the same recipe but bake it, covered at 415 for 50 minutes;  uncovered it for the last fifteen minutes to brown the skin and then serve.  Cooking it at a lower temp dries out the white meat.

Stuffing the bird w/herbs may be misleading to some. Stuffing is with a bread stuffing. I like the idea of placing it on a rack so you won'the have a soggy bottom. ??

I stuffed the bird with half of a lemon, onion and rosemary. Rubbed the outside it with Olive Oil and seasoned it inside and out with salt, white pepper, garlic, and rubbed skin with the fresh chopped Rosemary. I cooked it as directed and it came out beautifully. The whole house smelled wonderful. The chicken was juicy and flavorful. I will make this again and again.

This recipe was so good I was compelled to write a review about it!  Like many others, I made a few modifications to it.  I baked two birds.  I cut up some red potatoes, laid them in a single layer in the roasting pan, then added baby carrots.  I stuffed the birds with a half of onions, some slices of orange, rosemary and a half a stick of butter.  I didn't have any garlic but the next time I make this I will stuff some cloves in it.  I mixed EVOO with salt, pepper, dried rosemary and garlic powder and spread it all over the outside of the bird.  Then I poured a can of chicken broth in the roasting pan, placed the birds on the bed of vegetables and popped them in the oven.  After baking for about an hour, I took the melted butter from the cavity and brushed it over the skin of the birds.  It was so yummy!  I had a few of my girlfriends over for girl's night and they raved about it.  It was so moist and fell off of the bone.  This one is definitely a keeper!

Good recipe,   But I tweaked it a LOT. nonetheless, delicious. Added garlic, thyme, broth to the roasting pan, red peppers in the broth and squeezed a lemon over the top. Also, basted occasionally.

This was SIMPLE & EXCELLENT! I followed the recommendations of others and added an entire head of garlic into the cavity along with the onion & rosemary. I'm cooking two more tomorrow--another for our house and one for my mom. Thank you for the recipe! :)

This became a family favorite the first time I made it!  Even my picky 5 yr. old loves it, and eats it all up.

Good recipe. The end product reminded me of the chicken I had years ago served at the Wienerwald restaurants in Germany.

Following AbeLincoln's suggestions, this turned out pretty good. Though I have had some better roasted chicken recipes from here, I'd do this one again.

Started out wrong when I couldn't find fresh rosemary. Ended up selecting fresh savory. Followed reviewer alterations: Cooked on rack but got no crispy bottom. Quartered potatoes, carrots - came out dry and not cooked enough. Dumped can of chicken broth in bottom of pan - not enough to cook/keep moist vegetables?

This chicken was juicy and full of flavor!  
I added carrots and potatoes to make it a complete meal and the whole family loved it.  I also rubbed a little oil and rosemary on the outside of the chicken to brown it.  I will definitely cook this recipe again.

I used garlic instead of onion.  I also changed the cooking time by using the 20 minute per pound at 350 degrees rule.  It came out great.  Everyone liked it.  After removing the garlic before serving, I put it in my mashed potatoes.  That gave it a slight garlic flavor with just a hint of rosemary.

This recipe was easy, but not as sensational as I had anticipated based on other reviews.  I also stuffed mine with lemon, onion, fresh rosemary and garlic.  It was moist and the aroma was great while it baked.

I needed a recipe where the flavors  wouldn't interfere with a recipe that I needed the left overs for. I had a 7 lb chicken and used two onions and a bunch of rosemary sprigs. First time roasting a chicken with out butter or olive oil....pleasantly surprised by the flavor.

This is a great basic recipe, however, I did have to add a few things to make it sunday dinner perfect.  I added baby carrots, parsnips, red potatoes and onions to the bottom of the pan and put butter, rosemary and thyme under the skin.  I poured a can of chicken stock over the chicken and then rubbed it with olive oil, salt and pepper.  I also sprinkled some dry rosemary over the top before baking.  It came out perfectly moist and delicious.  It is also super easy with adding the vegetables to the bottom . . .you work is done once you put it in the oven!

We enjoyed this recipe very much.  I added baby carrots and turnips and alittle rosemary on top.  I also added a lemon to the cavity.  Thanks for the recipe!!!  Also, made a wonderful gravy with the drippings.

Awesome! Sooo juicy. I followed some tips--I stuffed the cavity with lemon in addition to onion, placed baby carrots around the bird, and poured a bit of chicken broth into the pan. Every 20 min to half hour I baste it. So easy!!

Oh my so delicious! I used italian herbs to rub into the skin along with some melted butter.  I have made this many times and since I have been rubbing the butter onto the skin it makes it crispy. I also add celery and carrots inside it.

My children love it and we all enjoy mashed potatoes and corn with it.

I've been making this chicken for several years now, just never took the time to rate it. I just popped one in the oven and decided to look the recipe up, feeling nostalgic since it's been a long while since I've made one. My daughter's face lit up when I told her what we were having for dinner tonight! This recipe alone is why I'm so glad to have fresh rosemary growing year round. Anyway, I make the same basic alterations that many have mentioned- butter under the skin, rubbing the skin with olive oil,seasoning etc. Never tried the lemon but I definitely will next time. Overall, one of my favorite recipes from this site!

The flavor of this chicken was good... but  the skin on my bird did NOT crisp up, especially on the bottom.  I even used a roasting rack, as others had suggested.  I ended up pulling off all the skin and pan-frying it.  I don't know what happened... maybe it's my oven.  :(

This recipe was good but not amazing. I did add 1/2 a lemon and onion to the cavity of the chicken along with several sprigs of fresh rosemary [lemon and onion provide added flavor and keep the chicken moist]. I didn't bother chopping the rosemary and just sprinkled the rosemary over the top of the chicken. Although the chicken was flavorful - we didn't enjoy it as a main dish. The chicken would be best to slice and/or shred and use in a salad, sandwich, or casserole.

It smelled better than it tasted. I think it needed more salt or something because it was lacking in flavor just from depending on the rosemary.

This recipe was wonderful. I changed it up a little by cooking the chicken over a bed of leeks and baby carrots. I also added oranges to the stuffing which gave it just a hint of flavor. The smell in the house while this cooked was worth making this!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was AWESOME! This is the first time I've ever made a whole chicken before, and I'm surprised that it turned out so well.  For the most part, I stuck to the original recipe with the exception of coating the chicken with olive oil and sprinkling it with Lawry's seasoned salt, Lawry's seasoned pepper and garlic powder. This recipe is going in the recipe box..Thank-you for such a great recipe!

This was fantastic!  I did as other suggested and added butter under the skin and put olive oil on the bird.  I used poultry seasoning, paprika, s/p, garlic powder and onion.  The chicken was 5lbs and done in 2hrs...it was so moist!  Wonderful flavor and I got to use rosemary out of my garden.  TY!  Great recipe.

I have made this several times and everyone always loves it.  It is the number one thing my boyfriend asks for and it is so easy!  Perfect for a Sunday dinner.

I drizzled olive oil over the chicken and covered it with foil, removing it for the last 20 mins.  I cooked it at a lower temperature for 3 hours.  The chicken stayed moist and you could really taste the rosemary.

This recipe is best for smaller birds, like cornish hens. I made the recipe with a 7 lb extra meaty chicken and the flavor was variable. The parts of the chicken in contact with the rosemary were the best. The parts closer to the bone had no flavor.

Following on from previous reviews, I added garlic to the cavity as well as the onion and rosemary and also added Olive Oil and garlic as well as sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to the outside of the chicken.  The result was absolutely lovely, it was very moist and full of flavour and I will definitely make it again.

This chicken was good beyond words!  It was my first roasted chicken, and my family devoured it at Christmas dinner.  I basted it with chicken broth, and it was juicy, tender, and flavorful.

Great recipe!  I did as others suggested and included lemon and garlic to the inside with some rosemary under the skin for added flavor.  I also cooked the chicken breast side down for the first hour.  It was very moist and flavorful.

We enjoyed the chicken, but it didn't have much onion or rosemary flavor. n
Next time might follow other suggestions to place herbs under skin. I rubbed the skin with olive oil and basted about 4 times in 2.5 hours of cooking a 4.5lb. bird. It browned nicely and was moist and juicy.Thanks for the recipe.

We have made this recipe several times now and love it... very easy to prepare.  We took the advice of some other reviewers and added lemon wedges and copious amounts of minced garlic... mmmm.

Loved this super easy recipe!  I made a couple of changes based on what I had in the house:  used leg quarters dotted with butter and Goya Adobo seasoning sprinkled allover.  I also left out the onion because I didn't have any in the house.  Also, baked for 1 hour covered, then 40 minutes uncovered, basting every 15 mins.  It was perfect!  Even my 2-year old loved it!!  Will make again and again.

Juicy and packed with flavor.  I don't know what was better though, the smell while the chicken was cooking or the taste.  My neighbor is going to have this cooking during her open house next week for the smell.

This chicken smelled so delicious as it was baking in the oven.....that was the extent of the word delicious.  It was extremely dry and totally flavorless.  I am truly disappointed after reading all of the positive reviews.  Won't make it again.

This was brutally dry. I used an amish chicken so maybe less fatty?  I even added chicken broth and basted it 3 times during the 2.5 hour cooking time.  Will not make this again.

Very good!  The leftovers (if any!) make great chicken salad!
