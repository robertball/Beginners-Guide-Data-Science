I make a Cracker Salad, but mine is slightly different.  I use one sleeve of saltines, 2 roma tomatoes chopped removing the seeds, 3 green onions chopped and 2 hard boiled eggs diced.  Right before I serve it, I mix all those ingredients with a cup and a half of mayonnaise.  This is one of my husband's favorite side dishes, especially with grilled chicken or grilled pork tenderloin.  Does not keep- too soggy!

Everybody loves this! Scale down the ingredients if you won't be able to eat it all at one serving. I assemble all the ingredients separately, and mix them together at the last minute before serving.

My husband and I liked this salad.  I agree with one of the other reviews...the crackers do get a little soggy after a while; next time I make it I will add the crackers just before serving.

My sister-in-law introduced this delicacy to me ;). It was SO good...and I'm NOT a tomato person! I left the green peppers out and used green onions instead of white onions. I'm trying to find a way to work this into our Thanksgiving menu! ;)

This was so good! My husband even went for seconds. Next time we are going to try to add some tuna to it and make a meal out of it. Thanks for such a unique, delicious recipe....

I really enjoyed this salad.  Using tomatoes and peppers fresh from the garden I'm sure helps improve this wonderful salad.  I wanted to cut down on the amount of fat so used fat free crackers, reduced fat cheese and reduced fat salad dressing.  Trust me, there is still plenty of flavor!  I'll be making this again and again! Thanks Diana for a great summer time dish!

Total comfort food. Not only do I love it but now my kids ask for it because they've grown to love it, too. I like to use a few big green onions and add a little fresh ground pepper and a little hot sauce. If I don't have any fresh peppers, I won't add it. (Usually when you make cracker salad, you won't have fresh peppers on hand.) This is also good with a few crumbled hard boiled eggs. Great for when you're really broke and this is really all you have around to make something filling and tasty. Best to eat it right when you make it because when it's soggy, it's not as good. You want those crackers crunchy.

My husband and I LOVE this salad!  We leave the green peppers out as we don't usually have them on hand but have the rest of the ingredients.  It is amazing how good it is for such a simple salad.

This was surprisingly good! I made less than the recipe calls for, and basically eyeballed everything to my liking. I do not think that this needed any additional salt, and I love salt, but it was just right as is. I do wish that the crackers would stay crispy, but there's nothing that could be done for that unless you add them in at the last second and don't plan to have any leftovers. All in all, I liked this and I'd make it again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Really good and quite different. I always use saltines instead of croutons on my green salad, so I already like the combo. I used less onion and more tomato.

This is a very different salad from any we've ever tried.  I actually tried a small portion of this recipe and a small portion of 'Georgia Cracker Salad' from AR.  I preferred this one with the green peppers and cheddar cheese.  I added the crackers right be before serving so that the crackers would not get too soggy.  It is definitely best when it is eaten the day it is made.

Wow, a tasty, quick to make alternative to Potato and Macaroni salads.  I made this exactly as written being careful with the mayonnaise.  I chilled it about 90 minutes.  The saltines added good flavor and texture.  I would say the number of servings mentioned in the recipe are huge and this doesn't overnight well in the fridge.  It does seem a recipe that can easily be scaled down in size.  I'll be making this often and try adding some celery and as another suggested, some tuna to make a meal out of this.  Thanks a bunch!

This is my husband's favorite salad. We both love it! I hardly ever add the cheese and it's still great. But, you have to assemble it at the last minute because it will get soggy pretty quickly.

Used red onion and instead of bell pepper used a hot pepper from my garden.  Satisfying lunch.  Thanks for the post.
