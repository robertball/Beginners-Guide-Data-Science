So good on so many things.  Don't be afraid of the Sriracha, that honey tames it a bit, just follow the amounts in the recipe.  I'm about a 6 or 7 on a scale of 10 for spiciness, and I actually added a little more Sriracha (personal taste preference).  The Sriracha and honey work harmoniously in this recipe, perfectly balancing each other, and the garlic gives it a good zing.  Served today on some toasted garlic crostini I had left from yesterday, but I'm thinking of all kinds of food to partner with this butter.  Very nice recipe.

Wow, just delicious! I did cut back the recipe, but made it just as written otherwise. I made this to serve on our steaks for dinner tonight and it was perfect. We were discussing what else we will be eating it on too! This is so versatile and a definite keeper~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!!  Thanks, for sharing another winner, Jan! :)

I made this exactly as stated.  New addiction!  The honey and sirracha and garlic are spot on.  Spread it on grilled corn on the cob for dinner and on my toasted English muffin this morning.  Going on a baked potato next.  I did not want to roll it in plastic wrap so I put it in a small covered container.  I will be keeping this butter on hand!  Thanks for sharing.
