This is a great idea. I halved the recipe.  I diced the bacon and cooked it in a 8" cast iron skillet, then used the same skillet to assemble the casserole. I used red, orange and yellow peppers.  One note, the ratio of eggs to milk is off.  The author of this recipe states at the bottom that she uses duck eggs but chicken eggs are fine.  Chicken eggs are smaller than duck eggs.  Use 1/2 cup milk for 4 chicken eggs.  A very pretty gluten free breakfast.

Took the advice of the other posts and reduced the milk for chicken eggs, chopped the bacon first and then cooked them crisp, softened the mushrooms in the left over bacon grease before throwing them in with the remaining ingredients, added yellow peppers and topped with cherry tomatoes. If I had some spinach or broccoli I would have thrown a little green into the mix for a nicely colorized meal. :)

I prepped this the night before, then just popped it in the oven the next morning.  The changes I made were:  I only used 1-1/4 cup milk and about 1/2 tsp of regular salt.  Also I sauteed the onion and green pepper a little bit.  Didn't use mushrooms.  It was delicious.  Loved the potatoes as the bottom layer.

Halved the recipe, and used a square baking dish. Used spicy ground pork in place of bacon, because that's what I had. Also used regular potatoes, rather than red potatoes. Turned out great. The spicy sausage gave it a nice kick. Will definitely make again.

It was a bit bland and took much longer to cook than directions said.  However,I was using an oven I was not familiar with.

The entire family loved it! I used a 15" cast iron skillet in place of a 9 X 13; used Spike for the seasoned salt, an orange pepper in place of the green pepper, and used a mix of cremini, oyster and shitake mushrooms. Next time I will add more bacon.

Will make again! Received lots of compliments...the sliced potatoes on the bottom make it unique. I used 10 eggs and a little over a cup of milk. So good!

Enjoyed this one. Used less bacon...... wouldn’t do that again, and it was a lot of potatoe, would decrease (but the ones I had were fairly large).  Otherwise was very good. Will make it again.

I used 5 eggs and a generous cup of milk per the other reviewers.  After I fried bacon, I fried onions, mushroom and hash browns in the bacon fat and then drained them as well as I could before mixing in to the eggs/milk.  We baked it in our cast iron pan.  I didn't have fresh potatoes or green pepper on hand, but this was just great.

This is really good! I reduced the amount of milk to 1/2c per other suggestions, but missed the part that they were also halving the recipe so I used 1/2c for 8 chicken eggs and it was fine. Although I'll probably try 1c next time just to see if its better. I will definitely make this again!

Loved this!  I halved the recipe and used only 1/2 cup of milk as others suggested. I used 5 eggs though because the mixture seemed too runny. Was glad I did. It turned out perfectly! I sauteed the onions, mushrooms and some finely chopped kale in the bacon grease before adding it to the egg mixture. Perfection! Also love the fact that you can pick it up in your hand to eat, cold or hot (and it's good both ways)! I want to make again in muffin tins and then freeze for a quick grab'n'go breakfast for my boyfriend who works all the time and won't take time to eat if he has to do anything to it first.

I was looking for a bacon and egg pie recipe to convert to a sausages and egg pie. Tried this recipe with chopped up sausages instead of the bacon; kids and hubby loved it. Like another reviewer I halved the amount and used chicken eggs so used 4 chicken eggs with 1/2 cup of milk. Also didn't add mushrooms as kids don't like them but think it would enhance the pie. It made a lovely dinner with a side salad! So not just a breakfast meal ??
