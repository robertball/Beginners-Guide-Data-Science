For making these cookies, I actually just put the almonds in a cold oven and turn on the oven to 350 degrees. When my oven has reached 350 they are roasted good enough for me. Fast and easy.  The less you roast the almonds IMHO the more nutritious they stay. Once roasted slightly  I would store them in the refrigerate so oils in the almonds do not turn rancid or use that day.

For being gluten free, these are pretty good. I ground rolled oats into flour, and had almond flour on hand. I used orange extract instead of almond. They turned out very yummy. A different texture then a flour cookie, but very good. I think I may dip in melted semi-sweet chocolate, next time.

response to kfoste8.   Please check your almond extract.  Could be it has gone rancid.   Was a little worried myself when I made this recipe because I had purchased the raw almonds a few weeks ago and didn't know that I should be storing them in the freezer until I roasted them because their natural oils could turn.  My cookies turned our really good.  Will make again with candy sprinkles.

the almond extract gave the cookies a bitter taste. obviously, it is a very nutty cookie recipe; my recommendation would be to leave out the almond extract or tone it down with some honey.

We all liked these cookies, kids included. As I already use almond flour in baking and had it ready to go, I lightly toasted a cup of it first rather than toast and grind extra almonds. I reduced the almond extract to 1/4 teaspoon as I thought the full 1 teaspoon would be too strong for out tastes. It added just a subtle hint of flavor. I also opted to add 1/3 cup chopped dried cherries to the batter. If you make the six cookies as directed, they will be quite large. I measured out a tablespoon of batter per cookie and that yielded a dozen cookies of typical size. Anyway, this recipe will go on our regular cookie list.

These have become a staple at our house. We've recently cut dairy out of our diet, and these are the 1st cookies that I've found that are dairy-free and very good. Also very easy to make! I must make them much smaller, because I usually end up with at least a dozen cookies from this recipe.

I love the simplicity of this recipe. It was a bit bland at first, so I made a few modifications. 1. I toasted the oats then ground them into flour as well as the almonds. I added a dash each of cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice, and about a teaspoon or two of course sea salt. It was the addition of the sea salt that I thought made them really good. Pairs well with a nice briney Islay scotch!

I was wondering, can I bake the almonds the day before I'm going to make the cookies? I'm going to have a massive time crunch and will probably need to do this.

The cookies are really delicious!  Instead of raw almonds I used almond flour.  Also ground up some steel-cut oats instead of using oat flour.   The cookies will bake in the shape that they go into the oven.  Next time, I will roll them and flatten with a wooden spoon.

I didn't even bother going through the process of roasting almonds. Instead I just used almond meal from Walmart (they also have almond flour if you want a finer texture. I just used 1 cup of almond meal. I couldn't find oat flour, but just ground up some gluten free oatmeal in the blender and that worked.
   One more thing was that they didn't really brown, except on the bottom, but when that happened I took them out of the oven and they had an excellent chewy texture unlike the dry crunchiness of most allergy free things.
 I was doubtful how these would turn out, but they were perfect and I'll definitely do it again.

Easy, healthy and versatile! I've made as is, but have also subbed other sweeteners (coconut nectar, agave, want to try honey next) and have tried with vanilla extract. My favorite variation has been with coconut nectar (not too sweet or as pronounced as maple), almond extract and chocolate chips pressed into the tops.  

These also take like 20 minutes from start to finish and I always have the ingredients on hand. Thanks for posting!

I am making these for a friends wedding (In Pittsburgh, there is a cookie table along with cake at the wedding!) I followed some advice. I used 1 cup almond flour instead of the whole almonds, and added orange extract instead of almond. These cookies were orange chocolate cookies.  I also used dairy free chocolate to dip them in.  I used a very small scoop and it made about  20 small cookies. I doubled the recipe so I ended up with 40.  YUM!!! and they are pretty. I added  a picture too

I ended up using toasted hazelnuts, and since it seeemed like they would be incompatible with the maple syrup, I replaced that with honey.  Having not used almonds, the almond extract seemed moot, so I decided to replace it with the zest of one orange.  After that a left over chunk of semi-sweet chocolate called out to me so I chopped in into pea size pieces and added it - about a 1/2 cup I would say.  Just tasted the cookie and  it's quite tasty - not too sweet, so the chocolate adds a little something special.

Wow! I loved it but I did make adjustments. I didn't have almonds so I used walnuts instead and cut up a few pieces of dark chocolate (3 squares of a bar). I probably need to leave them in a little longer next time because they still quite gushy on the inside. Everyone loved them- husband, 4 year old, college student:)   They were all eaten in about 5 minutes and a request for more.  I would suggest doubling the recipe right away. next time I think I might add cinnamon instead of chocolate.

Better than what I expected from the 4 ingredients. Later I used raw almond flour and liked it better.
