I made these wonderful muffins this morning for breakfast, and they were delicious, tender, and moist.  I used coconut oil because that's what I use for all my cooking and baking.  I love cinnamon so I used a tablespoon.  I had some King Arthur Cake Enhancer for gluten free baked goods and added 2 Tbsp., but I'm sure it's good without it.  I did not have pumpkin puree and am not fond of pumpkin, so I substituted Orange-Apricot Marmalade which gave it a delicious hint of citrus, and I added chopped walnuts and raisins.  Since I wanted large muffins and had just purchased and received a hamburger bun pan from Amazon, I used that.  This made six large muffins, so it would probably make a dozen regular muffins.  My husband loved them, and you would not be able to guess they are gluten-free if you didn't know.  Thank you for this recipe.

I used King Arthur multi-purpose flour for all the flour in this recipe. Its was ok and I will definitely make these again. Next time, I'll add chocolate chips or some other additional sweetener. My kids want it a little bit sweeter. Other then that, these were fine.

texture was good, but the flavor was poor. I will not be making this again!
