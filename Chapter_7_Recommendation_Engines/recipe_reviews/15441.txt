I've made this several times and tweaked it to my taste.  I do not like soupy cobblers.  I prefer a cake like dough without a lot of juice on the fruit.  I do not usually have self-rising flour on hand, so instead I use regular flour and add 1/2 tsp. salt and 1 tsp. baking powder.  For the peaches, instead of canned peaches, I use 1 pint of frozen peaches that have been thawed.  I spoon them evenly over the batter before baking.  YUMMY!

After making a traditional time-taking peach cobbler with a homemade butter crust, this recipe was so not up to par. I apologize, but it was horrible. I'm a "crust" and "dough" person, and this "cake-like" setting was just ikky to me. My husband on ther other hand liked it. This just wasn't peach cobbler to me.

this is the cobbler I was rasied up on. a true southern recipe, it was created during the depression when cooks had limited foods. I notice some reviews likes a cake like texture. not me , only I added was a little sprinkle of cinamon over peaches and drained half the juice from can peaches using 29oz, 16oz don't drain. for those who don't like too much butter, just use 1/2 stick butter.
thanks again for adding this recipe and all the loving memories it brought back to me.

This is like the recipe my grama made for me when I was young.  I love it.  It turns out great everytime and it's so easy to make.  I'll be making this many, many more times.  I made it for my dad, who also loved grama's cobbler, and he said this is the recipe.  Thanks.  (o:

Fantastic, outstanding, exceptional! This is now one of my most favorite recipes from this site. I can't say enough about it. I almost missed out 'cause everyone inhaled this cobbler. It was there one minute, almost gone the next. I used dark brown sugar, butter instead of margarine, and Margaret Holmes O'sage Peaches, lightly chopped with some of the juices (these are the best canned peaches you'll EVER eat), also added a pinch of cinnamon to the batter and OH MY GOODNESS was it good!! Served along side Natural Vanilla Bean ice cream...I could eat this everyday!!  Mine was neither dry nor bland.  I'd put money that it's the type of peaches that are being used by other reviewers.  If you can, use the peaches I mentioned and surely you can't go wrong.  I think Del Monte cans a freestone peach, and they're good, but not as good as the Margaret Holmes.

My Mama-in-law is a peach cobbler expert and she absolutely loved this!  I did heed the advise of some of the reviewers and used 29 oz. of peaches.  Very simple, easy and a recipe I'll use again on every holiday Mama spends with us!!!

I had tried many recipes for cobbler and just couldn't fet one right....This one was great. My whole family loved it so much that there was no leftovers. It tates so good with a scoop of vanilla icecream when it comes right out of the oven...Thanks a bunch for such a easy recipe.

This is REAL southern style peach cobbler, not upsidedown peach pie. I used fresh peaches from a local orchard(9-12, depends on how large) and added 3 tbsp sugar. If the peaches are ripe, you can just lightly press them when you slice them to make the extra liquid. I also added 1/2 tsp vanilla and baked it in a hand potted casserole. YUM!

I give it 10 stars, it's the best I ever had. My kids have been making me cook it every day. We just moved to Israel and the people here have never had Peach Cobbler, some people here are asking me to make the cobbler for them and they will pay me. :)

I used a 29 oz can of peaches, kept the butter the same, but used 1 1/3 cups of flour, sugar and milk.  Added some cinnamon to the batter and baked in a 9x13 inch pan.  It was great!!!

I liked that this recipe calls for already stocked ingredients. It can be put together last minute and you still can have a good dessert by the time dinner is over.

This is just what my mom always made when I was growing up.  It's a traditional baking soda cobbler and so yummy!  I put in about twice as many peaches as it calls for, but drain off part of the juice so it isn't too sloppy.    Serve with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream for an indulgent comfort dessert.

I was not impressed at all with this dish. It was edible, but that was about all. I'm accustomed to a more "southern style" that actually had real dough rather than that weird flour/sugar mixture. I wont make this again. Too much butter did not help it.

I have been making this recipe for years accept that I always DRAIN the peaches before putting them on top. I've also substituted some of the milk with peach juice if I've been short on milk. I usually double the recipe and make it in a 9x13 pan. When I do this I still only use one cube of butter. And its plenty. Also four cups of fresh sliced peaches when in season(instead of canned)can be used for a 9x13 pan. Made it for dinner guests the other night and they just called me for the recipe for their Sunday Dinner. I do need to say though that this time I substituted Bisquick for the self rising flour as thats what I had on hand. It still is really good. And VERY fast and easy.

I've already made this recipe two times now and neither time has the crust risen to the top as it should.  I figured the 2nd time would have changed.  I double checked to make sure everything was cosure.....the crust still didn't rise to the top.  It went flat on the bottom of the pan.

I used 29 oz can drained peaches.  I had the list of ingredients, but not the directions, so I melted the butter in the pan, put in the peaches, forgot the sugar for the peaches.  Sprinkled cinnamon on the peaches, poured on batter with about 1/2 tsp baking powder added, added cinnamon for color. Realized what I'd done when I found the recipe and turned the oven to 400F for 20 minutes for browner top. Turned out well, considering.  Obviously a fail-proof recipe; will lower the butter to 1/4 cup next time, leave the topping on top and possibly add finely ground nuts or wheat germ to the topping.  I thought it was sweet enough without the cup of sugar in the peaches.  A nice warm breakfast on a cool morning.

This definitely isn't the most delicious and beautiful cobbler, but I've made it time and time again when I've had a craving but not wanting to put so much effort into a crust. It's delicious and so easy to make. Also very easy to change up the fruit if you wanted something other than peaches.

The first time that I made this I cooked it for 55 minutes and it didn't turn out really well.  However, this time I made some altercations.  I cooked it for 35 minutes, I added a touch of cinnamon, and I used a big can of sliced peaches and used the juice as well.  This is a great cobbler.  It turned out perfect!!!  Even the picky eater of the family enjoyed it!

This was so easy and very good! I only had plain flour so I added 1/2 tsp salt, and 1 tsp baking powder, and added an egg because it just seemed like it should have one.  Next time I make it I might use 2 cans of peaches because I like a lot of fruit.  This is one of the easiest desserts I've ever made.

One of my favorite quick cobblers.  I add the peach pie filling in though and as it is just beginning to brown I sprinkle a teaspoon of sugar over it then let it brown the rest of the way.

The melted butter with flour mixture on top is a quick easy way to incorporate the cobbler product. As others I didn't have self rising flour so I added 1/2 tsp salt and 1 tsp soda to regular flour. I am a farmers market junkie so I used 4 large fresh peaches and 1/2 pint blackberries.  Perfect.

Very good!! I used real peach slices, and made it gluten free using Brown Rice Flour with Xanthan gum, but otherwise followed the recipe accordingly. I was worried at first it wasn't cooked all the way when I pulled it out of the oven, but I let it sit for about 10 minutes and it became a little more solid. I added cinnamon and Chinese five spice and I'm really happy I did that. DH absolutely looooovved it (and he doesn't really like peaches!) 
I will definitely make this again!

This is just so, so good.  I had this recipe many years ago and lost it.  So happy to have found it again!!  Couldn't be easier, which is a big bonus.  I always sprinkle a little cinnamon on top before baking.  You can use any fruit you like, too.  But the best part for me is the buttery, slightly crispy edges.  It's yum!!

This is a phenomenal, old recipe.  You can substitute any canned pie filling for a wonderful change.  My personal favorite is a can of fruit coctail, just like my greatgrandmother used to make.  Try it...it's SOOooo yummy.  Another suggestion is to use a can of pumpkin pie filling around holiday time & serve with fresh whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.  Delicious.  The one thing that I always do is very lightly dust the top with a bit of sugar and cinnamon, which really makes the top crust pretty & extra flavorful!!!

Maybe I was suppose to drain the peaches, and that was my problem, but I thought this turned out way too wet and too buttery. I'm not going to use this recipe again.

Finally, an easy and great tasting cobbler recipe.  I doubled the recipe, used a 29 oz can of peaches and a regular sized can...used half the syrup in each can.  I also added ginger/cinnamon and a teaspoon of salt to the flour mixture.  I sprinkled blueberries on the top, it was great!!!!  Can't wait to use fresh peaches.  I am also going to use this recipe for various berries and apples as well!  Thanks for the recipe!

Incredibly easy and delicious...my whole family loved it.  The only change I made was.. I added some cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter and also sprinkled some additional sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg on the top before baking.

This was okay but the peaches were bland and needed some cinnamon and vanilla or something to give it some boost. I spooned the peaches over the batter, but this came out really dry so maybe I was supposed to use the juice from the can too? It was more like peach cake than what I would call cobbler. I was expecting some syrupy juice beneath the crust. Not my style, but not bad for a quick easy recipe.

Really good. I used regular flour + 1 tbsp of baking powder and baked it for the full hour. Added 1tsp of vanilla. Could stand to bake another few minutes, because it's still a bit soupy, but really, really good.

the only reason why i gave this 4 and not 5 stars is because i prefer to use FRESH peaches, NOT canned peaches.  this is EXACTLY like the recipe that an old friend from Georgia gave me and I have been searching for awhile.  it's excellent.  i did add the baking powder and salt b/c i did not have self-rising flour!  it was good though, and the next night (since it was gone), i made another batch!

I have been making this cobbler for years. My mom taught me to make it this way. She always called it a poor man's cobbler. I just got one out of the oven and I used frozen blackberries. You can use any type of fruit or even mix fruits for something different. I wouldn't make a cobbler any other way! :-)

YUM! Easy with great flavor. My oops! turned out to be a good thing. When we were at the store and I saw the pie fillings, I said, "Should I make peach cobbler?" YES! Was the reply, along with someone else putting the peach pie filling in the cart. I didn't think anything about it, until I decided to look up a recipe (knew it was easy, just couldn't remember it). I stumbled on this one, and the last blech review, and made it anyway. The pie filling was GREAT! except for the fact that it didn't infuse the bread like canned peaches does. I think I could have added either all of the remainder of the pie filling or half a can or so of peaches with syrup. Regardless it, it was AWESOME! The bread was great, as is!

Tasty, but too gooey. I will try making this again with more flour, and maybe bake it longer.

I was raised on this recipe, and you can substitute just about any fruit for the peaches from blueberries, strawberries, cherries, to black raspberries, also if you don't have self rising flour, just use regular flour, and add a pinch of salt and a tsp. of baking powder.  We have also made this with brown sugar, if you like more of a caramel taste, either way it's yummy!

I was disappointed in this cobbler.  It was too sogggy, didn't seem to fully cook on the bottom.  I will keep looking for a better peach cobbler recipe.

I was very disappointed with the soupiness of this recipe. The dough itself was not sweet at all and very runny in the middle. This may have been due to the excessive amount of butter required at the bottom because it all pooled at the top. I ended up eating only the crispy edges and fishing out the peaches in the middle. I will not make this again using this recipe.

I love this recipe but I usually do not keep self-rising flour on hand so I substitute 1 tsp baking powder and salt. I also do not limit myself to peaches but use any type of canned pie filling or frozen fruits (thawed) that I happen to have handy. Blueberries are my personal favorite :)
I've also used fresh fruits, but they need to be prepared ahead of time by chopping, sugaring and then resting so they will juice just a little.

I have been making this recipe for 35 years.  I add 1 teas vanilla and cut the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup. I also add 1-14 oz can peaches (3-14 oz cans total).  I always get compliments whenever I serve this dessert.

Very good.  I will make this again.  I used a 29 oz can of peaches as suggested.  I also added 1/4 tsp nutmeg to the batter.  Besides that I followed the recipe and it was really good.

This cobbler was super easy and the best crust ever.  I loved it and will make it again!  I took the advice of others and used the 29 oz can of peaches and sprinkled cinnamon on top.  Also, I tried this recipe with apple pie filling (1 1/2 cans) and it was fabulous! Thank you for the recipe!

I love how simple this recipe is. Not really into baking. I didn't have any peaches so I cut up four apples into chunks and cooked them in a pan with 1 cup of water, 1/2 cup of sugar, and some cinnamon. Then I strained the apples before I put them in the pan so that it wasn't soup like.

It is still not exactly what I'm searching for, but it will do in a pinch. I used 29oz peaches with 1/2 thw juice. Also added a little vanilla and cinnammon, and used evaporated milk. I'll give it 4 stars because family loved it.

I made this because it was similar to my Grandma's recipe that I did not have handy at the time...Yikes!  What a disaster!  It never did cook all the way through and the batter tasted like wallpaper paste--no flavor.  I poured off a lot of liquid at one point, then the part that did ook was chewy and tough like leather.  The process is correct;  melted butter, batter poured (not stirred), fruit and liquid over top.  The proportions here are off, though...Mine was a mess, and never did get that delicious buttery crust like Grandma made.

I made this cobbler last night, using pie filling from a jar and then pouring it over the cobbler dough as directed. Last night it was crunchy and very good. Two slight changes: a dash of cinnamon sprinkled over the dish before placing it in the oven helped. I also substituted brown sugar, about half, for the white sugar as I didn't care for the pale appearance in photo. It was delicious and crunchy cake-like dough last night and this morning it was softer cake-like this morning. And YES, I had cobbler for breakfast with my coffee.

I have made this twice.   The first was as written,  and was just average.  This time I cut butter in half,  used 2 - 15oz cans of peaches,  one drained.    I added a crumb topping as one reader suggested...  The other 1/2 stick butter (softened),  1 tsp cinnamon,  3 Tbsp brown sugar,  3 Tbsp quick cook oatmeal my whole mixed together and crumbled over the top.  50 min.  SO delicious!!!

Great stuff! I searched a lot of cobbler recipes and finally decided on this one. Added the brown sugar, oatmeal and cinnamon topping per a reviewers suggestion. Also, I added 1/4 tsp. each of nutmeg, allspice, ground cloves and cinnamon to flour/sugar before adding milk. I drained two15oz. canned peaches - one in heavy syrup & one in 100% juice. To the 3/4 cup milk I made a cup adding a 1/4 cup juice/syrup from the peaches. As you can tell in my photo, after baking for an hour, my edges got pretty dark but when mixed with gooey insides, it worked itself out! Thank you for a terrific recipe!

Just like my mom made in the 50's.  Yay.  The great thing about this cobbler is that all the ingredients are in the pantry. (I use evaporated milk.)

This recipe comes out perfect each time. My husband likes a sweet and buttery crust so I added some melted butter and sugar to the crust about half way through cook.  I also added nutmeg and cinnamon to the mixture prior to cooking.

I added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 nutmeg to the dry ingredients, and 1 tsp vanilla to the batter. I used 29 oz sliced peaches. I used half the syrup. Very tasty. Baked in a 13x9 pan. Not too wet. Perfect!

After reading the reviews, I made a few tweaks, and it came out delicious! I added an extra can of peaches (but no extra syrup). I also added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg to the flour mixture. Lastly, I substituted 1/2 cup of sugar for the same amount of brown sugar. I think it would be a bit bland without the spices. I'll definitely be making it again!

YUM!  This was quick and easy, made it for a party and everyone was like" wow this cobbler is delicious!"  I made it the day before and just covered it and put it in the refrigerator. Heated it for about 15 min with foil on top before I served it with vanilla ice cream.

I've been making this recipe for some 5 or 6 years now. I learned it from a friends mother. From time to time I add a "crumble" topping to the dish as well. After adding the peaches, I sprinkle with a mixture of chopped pecans, melted butter and brown sugar!

Delicious. Easy to make.  Made a few changes. Used cream not milk. Added one cup walnuts to the batter. Topped off peaches with half cup brown sugar cinnamon.  My family raved and wanted more.

My family loves cobbler but being single, I always look for quick, easy and good. Found this and tried it last night. It was absolutely great! I used canned apples and didn't have any self rising flour, so I used all purpose flour a little salt and a tsp of baking powder and it came out beautiful. Will use again for sure!

Great basic recipe and easy to prepare. I do agree that 2 cans of peaches are needed though * My modifications on subsequent preparations: drain peaches, use 1/2 cup of the syrup to replace 1/2 cup of the milk in the batter. Pour remaining syrup over entire thing before baking.  I used reduced sugar peaches and couldn't tell any difference. ** Consider this: adding 1/4 tsp Almond extract to batter mixture and topping it with sliced almonds and light sprinking of sugar.  The subtle almond flavor is fabulous with the peaches and takes this humble dessert over the top.  Must serve warm with ice cream ( to cut the sweetness- LOL).

Made just as instructed with only the addition of 1/2 tsp. salt and 1 tsp. baking powder to replace the self rising flour as other review suggested. This was wonderful. Exactly like the recipe I'd always made before and lost. Thank you!

Amazingly easy!  As other reviewers did, I used a bigger can of peaches than what's called for. I also tried this basic recipe with apples as well, mixed them with a little cinnamon, brown sugar, white sugar, and nutmeg.  Will continue to make this again and again!

What a great afternoon delight! I actually substituted Splenda for the white sugar, and it came out very light and peachy. It is just the kind of dessert I like, not too sweet. I am going to try it next with blackberries.

This is a simple recipe that produces outstanding results. I left out the syrup in the peaches and used double the portion of peaches and it was wonderful. I'm not a big fan of canned peaches but they taste good in this recipe. In the summer I'll try it with fresh peaches for sure.

This dish will look like a hot mess..do not worry! It will bake up great. I strain the peaches and dice them so there is more peach all over..I drizzle some of the juice on top and bake. This is my go to dessert dish for company..served with Vanilla Ice cream it is the best.

My mom made this recipe all the time now I make it for my grandchildren.  Use blackberries in place of peaches and you will have a real treat.

Didn't have self-rising flour - used 1 c. all purpose and added a t. and a half baking powder and 1/2 t. salt. Added a t. of vanilla to the milk, and sprinkled cinnamon and nutmeg into the flour mixture. Used five fresh peaches - skinned them and cut them into slices. Didn't have an 8x8, but instead used 8x11. Thought this came out delicious! Only thing I would change next time is to up the amount of peaches. Using about 8-9 regular sized peaches would probably be sufficient, or if you're going to do canned, upping it to 29 oz. like others have suggested would probably be perfect. The dough part was the right amount of sweetness, and I wouldn't cut back on the sugar at all. I also had no issue at all with the butter being too much...the cobbler soaked everything up the way it was supposed to. After I assembled everything, I sprinkled the top with cinnamon and popped it in the oven. It is not the prettiest cobbler in the world, but nothing a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top can't fix. I would definitely make this again, but would recommend adding in the vanilla, cinnamon, and a pinch of nutmeg.

I doubled the recipe on everything except the peaches, I only had a 29 oz can. Came out perfect though, just the way I like it. I like more cobbler than fruit. I had to bake it for 75 minutes and my 13x9 pan overflowed a bit but I knew a smaller cobbler wouldn't be enough. Good thing my oven is lined with foil to make my clean up easier :)

real easy to make for quick desserts. i suggest to remove most of the juice since it makes the texture to doughy. good served cold with whipped cream on top!

Simple and wonderful recipe.  I add more peaches, and it's just like the wonderful cobbler I grew up with in Texas.

This was amazing!!
So simple, but so flavorful with a GREAT texture.  I loved how the topping came out...it was light and crunchy, almost like a meringue.  The floury mixture didn't cook all the way through, though, I wonder if that was intentional?  May want to bake for longer at a lower temperature, I'm not sure.
