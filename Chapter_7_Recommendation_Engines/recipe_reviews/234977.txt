Fun little recipe.  I made this more into a main dish by adding beans and some chopped Boca burgers.  Husband was a bit unsure about this but I probably should've served with sour cream  (which I forgot about) and salsa.  It is rather filling and I think would also be a good base for a taco salad.  Thanks for the recipe!

Super super yummy!! I added 1 pound of burger and did 3 layers of everything instead of just 2 (I have a US Marine in my house lol). The salsa verde was a yummy addition, I added more to just my plate. Thank you! I will be sharing!
