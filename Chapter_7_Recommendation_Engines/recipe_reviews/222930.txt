This was quick, easy, and tasty. I had no complaints. I did change the servings to 1, with the calculate button, and got about 2 servings. The light flavoring reminds me of a Japanese flavored cucumber side dish. I did eat it after mixing well, just because I prefer cucumbers crisp.

Good flavor, but I had to double the dressing amount for half the number of English cucumbers...  I don't know if this is because I sliced the 1 English cucumber very thin, or if, perhaps the English cucumbers we get around here are larger than available by the author...

In any case, the flavor was good and it's definitely a "keeper" recipe!

This was really good. Next time I will try using sesame oil.

Wow!  I added a couple of thinly sliced green onions.  I thought about using sesame oil but opted for safflower.  This was better than it sounded.  Glad I tried it.

I really enjoyed this cucumber salad.  It is a perfect recipe for summer - cool, refreshing, quick and easy.  I substituted half sesame oil along with half vegetable oil.  The dressing was just right - flavored but wasn't too much!

Delicious! I used 1/2 t sesame oil and 1 1/2 t vegetable oil. Otherwise i didn't change the recipe at all. I've also made this with cukes, zucchini and small cherry tomatoes. This is a great picnic or potluck dish.

I always try the basic recipe first.  It is very good as is and what I liked is that it is different than the cucumber salads we are all used to. (vinegar, sour cream based)  It does have a different taste but is great for a change of pace.  It is very adaptable and I tried using 1 tsp of sesame oil (this was doubling the marinade since I had read reviews so was a 3 to 1 ratio) I also added green onion and some tomato right before serving. It is very easy to adjust the tartness or sweetness.  May never be your 'favorite' cucumber salad, but it is very good.  Give it a try... it is very fast and you don't waste expensive ingredients and with some new experiments!

My wife is super critical about her cucumber salad and thought this one was pretty good. I liked it a lot, and really loved how easy it was to make.

Great flavor!  Not sure about those measurements because I used the recipe for half a cucumber.  Those measurements would not have been enough to use for 2 cucumbers for me.  So when I have cucumbers is the future I can fix this recipe and not have to worry about the lettuce.  Thanks for sharing.

It was too sweet and the soya sauce just didn't do it for me. I like mine much more tangy. I will not make this again.

I liked this! I read other reviews and did half vegetable oil and half sesame oil. I also added sliced white onion. Good!

Had a bunch of cucumbers from a friend's garden and needed something to do with them. This recipe was super simple and quick. I took the suggestion of one of the other reviewers and use sesame oil. I'm sure it would be just as good with the soy sauce, though. We've added a bunch of other random veges each time we've made it.
