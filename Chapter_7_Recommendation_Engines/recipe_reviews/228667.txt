I cut the sugar back to a quarter cup, used reduced fat cream cheese and added a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract. I made a plate out of "dippable" items this morning for breakfast like homemade waffle sticks, apple slices and banana chunks. The kids thought this was wonderful! If you're thinking of making this, start with a quarter cup of sugar and blend that amount in, then taste test it. That was just right for us but it may not be for you.

I was hesitant about the amount of sugar in this - not for health reasons but because we are not huge fans of sweet food - I added about a third of the brown sugar and it was more than enough. The kids thought it was frosting. Peanut butter and apples just go together!

I replaced the peanut butter with peanuts mashed up in butter, replaced the cream cheese with melted cheddar, and used 2 cups of splenda as a sweetner. This was disgusting. I will not be making this ever again. Save your time and do not make this

This is a great dip! I used a hand mixer to mix mine and it was very creamy and looked nice too. I only made half a batch, and it made plenty. We dipped apples, celery, pretzel crackers and vanilla waffers. *I originally rated this recipe in 2008, but this is one of several recipes that was cleared of all ratings and posted again as new for some reason. There used to be some really nice pictures posted.

I used 1/4 cup honey instead of the brown sugar and it was plenty sweet. It was delicious. Will definitely make again.

Great for every crowd, young and old.  I have never had anything but rave reviews and it is so simple.   If using apple's after cutting them use sprite or seven up to keep them from browning.  Works great!

I used reduced fat natural peanut butter, kept the sugar the same (since there's none in the pb) and added a dash of vanilla in with the milk.  So good!

it's simple as was perfect for my pool party. And FYI.. soaking apple slices in salt water for 2 minutes and then rinsing then off before serving will stop them from browning.

A friend turned me on to this. I modified it by cutting the sugar in half and adding some cinnamon and mini chocolate chips. I also used chunky peanut butter. Is anything better than peanut butter and chocolate???

Easy to make and everyone loved it!  Like others I did not use the full amount of sugar.  I may add some vanilla next time.  A keeper!

I made it exactly as stated in the recipe. Although I was concerned about the amount of sugar and wondered what the addition of cream cheese would add to the flavor mix, it turned out great! So easy. I made it for a meeting along with some Honeycrisp apples and for a family get-together. I heard no complaints. :-)

I did cut down the sugar to 1/2 cup & added a splash of vanilla-wonderful dip!  Closely reminds me of my favorite peanut butter pie filling!  So good with apples & just about anything else!

Iâ€™ve made this many times. My kids and their friends love this dip. I make it with the cup of sugar and 2/3 cup of sugar. We like both ways.

The only change I made to this was I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla. I started out with half the brown sugar but ended up putting the rest in after I tasted it. I was craving something sweet and didn't feel like baking. I will probably make this again, my kids are loving it!

I thought this was so-so, but made for a party (served with apples, pretzels and celery) and some folks went gaga over it!  Glad everyone else loved it...I will have to take another look at it and try to figure out how to make it pop a little.
