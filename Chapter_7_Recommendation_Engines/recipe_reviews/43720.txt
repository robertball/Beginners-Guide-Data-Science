Yum !!! Very exotic taste. Didn't make as a burger with bun . Served them on top of an Asian style cole slaw accompanied with Jasmine rice. Drizzled with soy sauce and a peanut dressing, garnished with lime wedges. I used Japanese bread crumbs. Have made it 4 times already. It helps if the tuna is slighty frozen when mincing.

Excellent!  I didn't have tuna steaks, so I just used two 7 oz family size packages of Star Kist tuna and it was the perfect amount for 6 regular-sized patties.

Very good! My picky husband really liked it so that alone makes it worth 5 stars. I only had 1lb of fresh tuna, so I scaled it down to 4 servings. I still used 1 egg and added a little extra breadcrumbs(Panko). I was surprised that they held together quite well. Served with an Asian cole slaw recipe from this site. I put the slaw on the burger but next time I will serve it on the side because the peanut sauce overwhelmed the tuna. Thanks for the recipe!

My whole family loved these.  I used two cans of tuna and coated the patties with flour before pan frying which helped them stay together.  Served on a toasted roll with avocado and cole slaw.  Making them again soon.

I changed this up based on what I had on hand. I used minced yellow onion in place of the green, jarred ginger & garlic paste in place of minced ginger root (I think garlic was a nice addition). I used dried cilantro and instead of bread crumbs, I used 1/2 ground almond flour, 1/2 whole wheat flour. Patties were loose when formed, but firmed up well while cooking.  Really,  Really liked this. I refrigerated mine and then sliced into strips for a salad later. Great flavor! I might try a bit of cayenne next time and soaking the tuna in coconut milk first.

I made these with ground ginger and regular onion as that's what I had on hand, and I cooked them on the Foreman grill. They turned out really well! We had them on Kaiser rolls with a lick of wasabi mayo. The next time I make them - and I will actually make them again! - I'll add more sesame oil, and less cilantro. Thanks, Dakota!

This recipe was excellent. Being that we don't eat any meat except fish this was a great alternative to the veggie burger we usually eat. Way to go Dakota for such a great recipe. We served with tomato, lettuce, and wasabi mayo.

This is missing something in my opinion.  I think I'll try it again and maybe add either ground peanuts or peanut butter to it.  There's just something about it that's missing an authentic Thai flavor.

This burger has lots of flavor with sesame oil and ginger.  It was a little dry, but was much better with a little mayo and wasabi added to the burger. I would make this again...would be good as small sliders.

Phenomenal flavor!!  Plus they're pretty easy to make if you use a food processor to mince the tuna, onion (I used fresh), and grated carrots all at once together.

YUM-O! very good recipe!! I wasn't sure I wanted to mince up my nice tuna steaks, but it was more than worth it for the flavor of these burgers!  I took the advice of others & made a few changes: I used 1 tsp green curry paste in place of cumin, omitted the ketchup, left out the cilantro, used more ginger (I like stuff spicy), only used 1 lb. of steaks b/c that's what I had, and served it over Jasmine rice with "The Best Thai Peanut Sauce" by Stephanie M. (heeded others advice with that recipe too).  I served the cilantro on the side.  YUMMY!! Yea, the ingredient list might be a little strange for both this & the peanut sauce, but wow are they good! I'd recommend tasting the tuna burger first before putting the peanut sauce on it, you may find you like it as is; the peanut sauce gives in an entirely new, but just as good, flavor.  My husband loved this as well; it goes in the make-again-soon pile!  Thanks Dakota for a great recipe!

An excellent recipe.  I didn't have Ginger so I left it out but can imagine the added flavor.  Pan fried in virgin coconut oil and served on a whole wheat muffin with mayo and sirachia.  Excellent.

These burgers were oustanding! I made them for my dad for Father's Day, and he really enjoyed them! I was not a fan of tuna until now! We bought the tuna from the local seafood market here at the Jersey Shore. We just made some renovations to our house including the kitchen so I had to make some adjustments which ended up benefiting the burger's outcome. I could not find the grater for the carrot therefore I finely diced the carrot. I also used Old Bay seasoning instead of cumin. I served them along side some grilled zucchini and squash that I light brushed with soem EVOO, as well as some corn on the cob. Also when cooking the burgers, I grilled them rather than placing them in the broiler. When I grilled them, I placed each pattie into aluminum foil which prevented the pattie from breaking apart on the grill and helped achieve and maintain that "burger" shape. Again these were great, and definitely a healthy choice! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

Normally I would not review a recipe in which I change the ingredients but these were so incredible I can't not review them. The changes  I made were:
substituted the carrot with red bell pepper, substitute the cumin with green curry paste, and I left out the salt and ketchup as there was soy sauce is already a salt and I cannot figure out why ketchup is in a thai flavored recipe. 
I also grilled the burgers instead of broiling them. The flavor was amazing. I will definitely be making these over and over.

These tuna burgers were very good and a nice change of pace from a grilled tuna steak.  I recommend spraying the pan with non stick cooking spray.  The first side stuck to the pan a little.  I sprayed the pan and flipped them over, and the second side did not stick.  These burgers were full of flavor and not dry at all.

These were surprisingly great! I made no changes except to add about 1/2 tsp green curry paste as others mentioned. I also think I might have accidentally used 1/2 tuna - 1/2 halibut as my freezer packs were not labeled. In any case, delicious! We served them on buns with a sambal mayo which was spicy, but not too hot. Perfect.

I really enjoyed the thai flavor.  I used can tuna because that was what I had on hand.  It worked well, though I think fresh would have been even better. Might try with a little peanut sauce on the bun next time.

As other satisfied reviewers, I made some changes to the original recipe: used mahi-mahi instead of tuna and did a very small dice rather than mince; doubled the cilantro and used panko bread crumbs. Ginger was a bit overpowering to my taste, but otherwise it was perfectly seasoned and I could taste exactly the hint of sesame oil and cumin. Will make it again with less ginger. 

I'm guessing that reviewers complaining about bland taste might just prefer more spicier food. In this case you might want to add green curry or hot peppers.

This is my favorite tuna burger recipe. Fresh tuna truly makes a difference, but this will definitely jazz up the canned tuna in your cabinet. If you are not in the mood for a burger, this recipe works perfectly for fish tacos. I like to top it with a simple cilantro-onion-carrot lime slaw.

Don't sub out the sesame oil. It is a significant addition to the taste of the burger.

This was just ok for me. Not great and fantastic but not bad. I used canned tuna instead of fresh, though. Served it as patties and not on a bun (which possibly would have been better). Did have sesame oil but added a touch of rice vinegar. Very healthy though. I didn't get to use wasabi mayo as suggested (wasabi was no good), but I found if you mix the soy and ketchup together, it makes a good topping.

I made these last night for dinner and they were a hit.  I made a few changes: used dried herbs/spices as that's all I had on hand, did not use carrot or seaseme oil as I didn't have either of then, and used canned tuna (1 large can Albacore and 1 large can white fish tuna).  This was my first attempt at anything Thai related and it turned out really well, even w/o the items I didn't have.  I cooked these in a pan with olive oil rather than broiling them.  Mine fell apart a little, but I think that was because of the canned tuna and cooking them on the stove top.  I will bake or broil next time.  I served this with a box of Thai Kitchen yellow curry rice and asparagas in butter and balsamic vinger, found on this site, and did not use buns.

We truly enjoyed these delicious burgers! I served them on only the bun bottoms, it was enough bread and the tuna is what you are meant to taste!

As written, it was a bit bland. I added some Starkist sweet and spicy tuna to improve the flavor. On top of that, the fish patties fell apart when I flipped them over. I enjoyed the flavor but it wasn't "servable" for anyone else.

This just didn't work for me, and I followed the recipe to the letter. I had high hopes, and it just fell flat. They had an odd taste to me, and didn't hold together well. Oddly enough, my 5 year old loved it. I wish I could say I enjoyed them more, but not even sure what I could do to improve the taste.

Okay for something different.  But pretty bland considering all of the ingredients.  I doubt I'll make it again.

Right on the money suggesting that the tuna be chopped by hand vs a food processor; much more control for the desired texture.   Used a lemongrass Thai spice blend rather than the dry ingredients. Also, for a bit more kick, half ketchup and half Sriracha.  Cooked in a sauté pan in a tsp of peanut oil to medium rare.  Made the Asian slaw from this site served on he side which complemented the burgers perfectly.

I've made this recipe a ton of times! It's very good! I always use the same ingredients for the tune mixture but with sushi grade tuna because I like it a little pink in the middle. Instead of serving it with the typical lettuce and tomato, I serve it with wasabi mustard and alfalfa sprouts. It's amazing!

Once you get the tuna minced, this recipe was simple and tasty. I added more cilantro, and next time will bump up the scallions and spices as well for a little more flavor.

This was a fantastic recipe, very delicious. My husband demolished all the patties very quickly. I didn't put in buns, but served the patties alone with a sode salad

This was very tasty. I think I used a bit more soy sauce than the recipe called for and used  1/4 cup of egg beaters instead of a whole egg. I served this on toasted buns with spicy brown mustard and mango chutney. Delish.

This dish had a nice flavor, but it didn't hold together well, it was rather mushy.  I think I will play around with this one.
