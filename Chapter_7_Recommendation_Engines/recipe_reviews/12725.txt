This is an awesome recipe and I have tried it several times.  After you put the ingredients together and smell it, you just know that it will be fantastic.  I had similiar problems with getting the Salmon to keep the flavor and have found that if you wrap it in Aluminum with some of the marinade and cook it you retain much more of that flavor, but you   lose some grilled flavor.  If you cook it almost to done and then remove and place on the grill by itself it gets a good mix of both the grilled flavor and the marinade.

Great marinade!  I used olive oil instead of peanut and omitted the onions with good results.  Great smell and taste.

I have been using this recipe for about 2 years.  It is my favorite salmon recipe and always turns out delicious.  I have substituted onion powder and garlic powder for the fresh ingredients and it has turned out very good.  I think the taste of fresh ginger is the standout though.  Thanks for a great recipe that impresses everyone I've tried it on.

This was delicious! I bought the huge salmon you can get at Costco and marinaded it over night. I wrapped it in foil and threw it on the grill! I hate fish and usually don't eat it but this was amazing! I would highly recommend it for fish lovers and haters alike!

This recipe was fabulous.  I have used the marinade on tenderloin, chicken and pork.  I also used it as a salad dressing.  I received rave revies from my roomate.  I also emailed it to friends and family.

After a year of making this recipe I made it again last night and it was fantastic.  I added more garlic and reduced the sauce, but this is the best salmon recipe ever.  I used go to a restaurant in North Atlanta and pay about $30 for this dish; now I think this recipe is much better.  My sons also love it, and they're "picky eaters."

Fan-tas-tic.  I only marinated for 3/4hr as that was all the time I had, I also baked it in the oven at 400C for approx 15 to 20 mins.  Thank you for posting - delicious.

Been using this recipe for many years and it always draws rave reviews from our dinner company.  It's even better if you barbeque it on a cedar plank.

I know this is a "cheat," but if you are short on time and/or ingredients, simply marinate salmon with a mixture of bottled teriyaki, Thai peanut sauce, and hoison sauce.  Use enough terriaki sauce to make the marinade thin, as the other two sauces are quite thick.

I have used this recipe for a few years now, since I first read it in AllRecipes. It is by far the very best, most delicious way to serve salmon! Even my non-fish eating friends raved about it. It is the ONLY way I prepare salmon anymore!

I've been following this recipe for at least 5 years. We got it out of a magazine and it was called Fire Cracker Salmon. It is a favorite in our house. I try not to over cook the salmon and I use foil on the grill because the fish can burn easily because of the marinade.

I have been trying to find a recipe for fish that I would enjoy (usually I hate fish) since it has so many health benefits.  This is the first recipe I would make over and over again!  I definitely added a bit more garlic and grilled it first in tin foil and then right before it was finishing took it off and put it directly on the grate.  Perfect taste, perfectly done, delicious!

I hate fish. I mean, HATE it! This recipe helped me incorporate salmon into my family's diet and we LOVE IT! It's a keeper. I marinate overnight and am a member of the You-Can-Never-Have-Too-Much-Garlic Club so I use at least twice the chopped garlic but otherwise make as-is. DELICIOUS! While grilling the salmon, I turn bits of the marinade recipe into a reduction to glaze the meat with. Mmm!

Made these tonight and they were soooo good! I got off work a lot later than I thought so they ended up marinading about 10 hours, and it was great! I added 2Tbs fresh dill weed (for 2, 4 oz pieces) and followed the advice of others and wrapped them in foil and put them on the grill. Fantastic. I will definitely keep the dill as part of this recipe.

Loved the marinade! I drizzled it over some white rice for some extra flavor and used shrimp instead of salmon and it turned out great. Next time I make this I will add more brown sugar and less balsamic vinegar, but I will use this as my "stock" marinade from now on. Can't wait to try this on chicken now!

We inhaled this! I did make some changes due to what I had on hand. Used EVOO instead of peanut oil and left out the sesame oil since I didn't either oils. Also used low sodium soy sauce so it was a tiny bit bland. Broiled for 5 min. and baked at 400 for 10 min. Will definitely make again using all the ingredients, but with the following changes: less sugar, more red pepper flakes and more garlic. And will definitely use the grill next time. Thanks for sharing!

This was by far the BEST salmon recipe ever...I could not believe how moist this was. I was only able to allow it to marinate for about 30 minutes...next time I will allow it to marinate for longer time frame....i can't imagine it tasting better.

Best salmon ever! I don't typically care for salmon but I was bummed I didn't have more of this it was sooo good! I used Olive oil in place of the peanut (didn't have any) and omitted the ginger (gross). Thanks so much for the recipe, it's amazing:)

Awesome marinade!  I only had two hours to marinade the salmon but it was absolutely delicious.  Such an amazing blend of flavors.  Just enough heat from the red pepper flakes and just enough sweetness from the brown sugar.  I served it with Grilled soy-seseme asparagus and rice pilaf with almonds.  Yummmmm.

Yummy way to fix salmon.  I even grilled it inside last night on the stove top grill.  It was delicious.  After removing the salmon from the marinade I drizzled honey, extra balsamic vinegar and sprinkled more red pepper flakes.

One of the best recipes I've ever tasted for salmon.  My husband hates salmon and he couldn't stop eating it!  I used olive oil instead of peanut and didn't have green onions or sesame oil on hand so I left them out.  I totally forgot to add salt but with the soy sauce I don't really think it was needed.  Per others suggestion I put the fish in foil packs and cooked them until mostly done.  I poured the rest of the marinade in a saucepan and thickened it into a glaze.  I took the fish out of the foil, placed them directly on the grill and brushed them with the sauce.  They were SO flavorful and delicious.  This is one of my new favorite recipes!

We love this with wild salmon.  The marinade goes well the stronger taste of wild salmon.  It's the only way my kids will eat wild or the darker red salmons. I make it with olive oil instead of the peanut oil, because I always have olive oil on hand.

AWESOME!! We eat salmon at least once a week and when I made this one last week my fiancee said it was "the best" salmon he's ever had...So I'm marinating another for tonight. The only thing I added was a half a lime squeezed into the mix. Lime and brown sugar are always good together. We also kept it wrapped in foil on the grill. It would also work well in the oven this way. Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is fantastic.  I've been converted from a non-salmon eater to a big salmon fan because of this recipe.  I've always been turned off by what I thought to be the strong fishy taste of salmon, but this marinade had me licking my plate clean.  The marinade doesn't mask the taste of the salmon, but compliments it well, and I think grilling the salmon on the bbq helps to tame the strong fishy taste by adding a smokey flavor.  We marinated the salmon overnight, added a bit of extra garlic and grated fresh ginger, but other than that, followed the recipe to a t.  The only change I might make next time would be to add more crushed red pepper flakes (to add a bit more heat) and maybe double the marinade and use the other half to make a sauce on the stove... however, the original recipe is good enough on it's own.  We grilled the salmon on the barbeque and served it with mashed potatos, broccoli, grilled pineapple, and white white.  Absolutely divine!

Great marinade. I only marinated for 2 hours and still had great taste. Used fresh ginger, 3 cloves of garlic and olive oil instead of peanut oil. Omitted salt, plenty in soy sauce anyway.

Amazing marinade. I didn't have peanut oil though so I up'd the sesame oil and added olive oil and a bit more garlic. Yum!

This is one of my favorite fish recipes!  A time-saving hint: you don't need to marinate fish longer than 30 minutes, according to professional chefs.  Marinades penetrate fish faster than they do meat.

This recipe converted my non-fish eating sisters into licking their plates clean and asking for more. If you knew my sisters, you'd call it a miracle. Super recipe for entertaining.  Don't oil your grill, lay the fish on aluminum foil to control the flames. Turn only ONCE, 8 minutes each side.

This marinade does well with catfish, too! I broiled instead of grilled. It also does fine without the green onion.

This was a great recipe.  Wonderful flavor!  I used salmon steaks rather than filets.  I should've soaked them in the marinade longer because it did not really permiate the meat.  I definitely will make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

This salmon was awesome.  We made the maranade the night before and add it to the fish as specified - very favorful! We also cooked it on the grill in a "pan" made from heavy foil - very tender and it kept the fish from falling apart.

This was really tasty.  I followed the recipe pretty loosely (used fresh grated ginger in place of ground; left out the peanut oil, because I didn't have any).  Overall, the Asian flavors came through without overpowering the taste of the salmon.  This kids loved this too.  Will make again.  Thanks.

I think this was as good as any restaurant salmon. Outstanding dish. I spread a sheet of foil over the grill, added the salmon and then poured the marinade over all. When the salmon was nearly done, I transferred it off the foil and directly onto the grate (as suggested by another reviewer) as the marinade continued cooking on the foil. I was able to pour the well cooked marinade all over the fish before serving. A wonderful salmon dish with a kick.

We all loved this, including my fussy hubby. Only had 2 hrs. to marinate so I upped the chopped garlic to four cloves and used a tablespoon of real grated ginger.  Instead of brown sugar, I used honey to taste. To keep the flavorful marinade on through cooking, but to also get that grilled mark on the fish, I removed the salmon from the marinade (which I put in the microwave for a minute) and grilled it first in a grill pan for two minutes.  It got some nice grill marks because the marinade that still clung to it caramelized.  I turned over the fillets so they were skin side down in the pan, covered them with some heated marinade and stuck them, still in the pan, in a 350 oven for 15 minutes.  If your pan isn't ovenproof, you can transfer them to a baking sheet or dish lined with foil. When they were done, I topped them with the leftover hot marinade and served.  They were juicy, flavorful and looked spectacular.

Very yummy!  I didn't have peanut oil and figured it may have a bit of a peanutty taste so I used olive oil with a tablespoon of peanut butter.  I had some fresh ginger on hand so used that in place of the ground.  I only had about 3 hrs to marinade which seemed fine.  I did grill it with some of the marinade in an aluminum pocket until almost fully cooked and then placed it directly on the grill for about 2-3 mins.  :-)

This marinade is wonderful!  I tossed a few dozen jumbo shrimp in with the fish, then before grilling, I threaded them on skewers.  Both the salmon and shrimp had great flavor, and received raves all round the table.  If I could give this one more than five stars, I would.  I will definitely be making this again... the family insists!  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent - very flavorful!  Tripled green onions and used fresh grated ginger for a more intense flavor.  Turned fish several times while marinating to insure even distribution of seasonings.  If you plan boil and reduce the sauce to serve on the side,  I suggest reducing the peanut oil by at least half, otherwise it will be too oily.

Excellent flavor.  Even with the maximum suggested marination time it didn't make the salmon floury.

Gave very little flavor to my salmon.  I must say that I was quite disappointed with this marinade.  I would not recommend it, sorry.

this was absolutely amazing. My husband said he doesn't like salmon. But after he had this he said that this was one of his top 5 favorite meals! This marinade was so good i will be using this on chicken and pork. I cooked the left over sauce until it got a little thicker and then poured it over the salmon after I cooked it. yum!

This recipe is amazing!  I had it at a friend's house last week, then made it again for me and my husband.  So good exactly as written...the only thing I did differently was I used fresh ginger, as I like it better AND I didn't have any ground.  Try this dish!

Good flavor but we found that the charcoal BBQ was a little to overpowering. Next time we'll use the indoor electric grill.

I liked this but didn't love it. I will probably make it again but bump up the flavors a bit using more garlic, fresh ginger and more brown sugar.

This is the best salmon recipe, especially when marinated overnight! My nephew, who has been an extremely picky eater since he was young and will only eat starchy foods, ate two helpings of this the first time he tried it!

I didn't have any sesame oil so I skipped that.  I also didn't feel like putting everything together in the morning before work so I made the marinade the night before while making dinner which meant the salmon marinaded for almost a whole day.  Turned out incredible!  I'll be making this dish again real soon!

We really loved this--everything about it!  I did use only a half of the sesame oil (family preference), and I used a combo of olive and canola oils.  I BBQd this using a new copper grill topper.  Very yummy, and I'll for sure make this again!

Absolutely loved this recipe. I doubled the amount of red pepper flakes  and ginger (use fresh grated ginger), and substituted olive oil for peanut. I only had a few hours to marinate it, but next time will marinate overnight. Will also use peanut oil in the future. The green onions were a must. This will be one of our camping favorites, as it can marinate in a ziploc til it's ready. Thanks!

This recipe has been in my box since 3 years ago.  I have made this recipe for at least 30 or more times.  Everytime it came out perfect.  Rule of thumb, grill about 6 mintues per side.

This recipe turned out perfectly! I made some modifications - I seared the salmon in a hot pan and finished cooking uncovered in an oven at about 350 degrees. I also used 1 full tbs of fresh ginger, raw sugar instead of brown and olive oil instead of peanut oil, and a touch more soy sauce. I didn't have green onions, so I used a small mild red shallot instead. I made a paste with the garlic, shallot and ginger in a mortar & pestle and added this to the other marinade ingredients. I think this recipe is perfect as it is, but you can easily modify it to suit your tastebuds, it's a recipe that's hard to go too far wrong with.

I had enough marinade for 2 lbs of fish. I made a few modifications as suggested by other members. I used olive oil instead of peanut oil. I added Splenda brown sugar, 3 cloves of garlic, and toasted sesame oil. Fish marinaded for 4 hrs. My husband really liked this recipe. It's a keeper!!

This was a GREAT recipe!  The marinade was a perfect complement to the salmon.  I omitted the peanut oil to make it a little more healthy, adding extra soy sauce and a little water to create enough liquid.  I also used lemon zest and juice instead of balsamic vinegar.  A nice rice pilaf and a green salad topped the meal off nicely.  Delicious!

If we have salmon, we have it like this. There is nothing better than this. We make it exactly like the recipe states and even ppl who 'dont like fish' enjoy this marinated version. Thanks for a great recipe to set our salmon apart.

I have used this marinade on fish, chicken, and now steak. Love it, Love it, Love it!!  For the steak I used equal amount A1 Bold & Spicy (instead of Soy sauce), and red onion instead of green.  I also halved the Balsamic.

Loved this.  Did not add onions, but will another time.  5 minutes per side and voila...amazing dinner.  Only marinated for 30 minutes at room temp.

This was delicious!  I used fresh caught salmon not even out of the water 24 hrs:)  Next time I will marinate for a little longer.  I only marinated 2 1/2 hours because I was afraid of it overpowering the fish.  I will try 4 hours next time like the submitters says.  Great recipe!

Delicious! Tweaked this slightly by using smoked salmon filets (thin-sliced) and flash-grilling (1.5 min on each side). Perfection. Easy, wonderful stuff!

I didn't have any peanut or sesame oil in the house, the walnut oil I had substituted nicely.  I also skipped the ginger and red pepper flakes because I don't like them.  I didn't feel like it was missing anything at all!  I marinated two salmon steaks and two pork chops in this.  I also took another reviewer's advice to keep the salmon in tin foil packets, then finished them straight on the grill.  The salmon was great, it didn't dry out, it retained the flavor.

Wow, what a wonderful recipe. We grilled it last night. I didn't have any peanut oil so I subbed canola, I also used white onion and it was still fantastic. I am a salmon purist and was hesitant about marinading it I will definitely make this again after i go to the grocery store.

I love this recipe!  I am not a big salmon eater, but I love this.  I make it for my family once a week now.  My son even likes it!  I don't usually have green onions, so I substitute white onion for it and it works great!  The longer it gets to marinate, the better!  My fave is to marinate it overnight.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was awesome and we didn't have enough time to marinate for more than an hour.  I imagine it would be amazing if marinated long enough.  Even my picky kids ate it.  Had the leftovers on a salad the next day too.

this was great but i changed the marinade because that's how i make it my own, lol.  i had fresh ingredients on hand so i didn't use anything powdered.  i used fresh ginger, onions, i added cilantro, rosemary,oregano & ground flax seeds (i add this to everything, it's good for you & you can't taste it), i used a little more brown sugar & garlic than the recipe, i used canola oil because that's what i had on hand, i didn't use the red pepper flakes, i also added worchester sauce.  i have made this marinade three times already & it is great every time, everyone loves it.  i would recommend letting the marinade soak for at least 1-3 days.  the first time i marinaded it for a day & it was good but the second time i marinated it for 3 days & it was great!

This marinade makes THE BEST salmon you could ask for. My husband and I both love it; even when I've had to omit an ingredient or two, the combination of flavors has still been delicious. The times I've made it I've used olive oil instead of peanut oil because I didn't have any peanut oil, but sometimes I whisk a little peanut butter in for a peanuty flavor and it's great!

Wonderful recipe!  My children don't normally prefer when I make salmon and I had several asking for seconds!  My husband also said I could make salmon everyday if I made it like this.  The only changes I made were: substituted veg. oil for peanut oil since I was out.  Increased sesame oil to 1 TBSP for more flavor since I didn't have peanut oil and I added about 1 TBSP toasted sesame seeds.  While the salmon was grilling, I boiled the leftover marinade for a couple minutes and then poured it over the fish to serve.  The sauce reduced down and made a sweet, thick sauce.  Just wonderful!  We will be using the recipe many times I'm sure.

Fantastic recipe. I've made this twice this week. The first time on salmon. The second time I used it on pork chops. Both got raves! The only change I made was subbing EVOO for peanut oil (didn't have any). Both times, I only had 3-4 hours to marinate and they had fabulous flavor!! This one is a winner!!

This is absolutely fabulous!  My husband is not the biggest fan of Salmon, but he raved over this.  I substituted olive oil, since I did not have peanut and it was fine.  Also, I omitted the salt, since the soy added enough saltiness.  I grilled on our gas grill at medium temp. (400-450) for 5 min. per side.  My fillets were 1 inch thick.  I will make this again, for sure.

I used fresh ginger and marinated for 24 hours as some others have suggested.  Made it for Father's Day....even my hard-to-impress brother-in-law loved it!  It was restaurant quality.  Very good.  Served with grilled veggies that I marinated also....squash, zucchini, red & green peppers and purple onions.

I bought salmon while it was on sale over the summer and combined all the ingredients into a freezer bag and froze it.  I pulled it out, thawed it in the refrigerator and broiled it in November and it turned out perfect.  I wasn't sure the marinade would hold up in the freezer but it turned out great.

Great recipe for salmon and have used this and similar many times.   I do not use the sesame oil (don't like the taste) because I find it overpowering. It really doesn't need it.   Thanks for sharing.

I made this recipe for my book club and it was a hit with all of the ladies. Even my husband, who claims to not like salmon, really enjoyed the leftovers.  One caveat--don't marinate for too long, or it will discolor the fish too much.

Delicious! I've never grilled salmon before and this was a wonderful recipe. I only marinaded for 2 1/2 hours since I was running out of time, can't imagine what it will taste like when I marinade it overnight next time around. Will have to try this marinade on other meats as well. Thank you!

Fabulous recipe.  Works really well with chicken and prawns too.  I only had 2 pieces of salmon for our dinner and it was not enough for all of us so I  marinated the salmon and prawns together and the chicken by itself in another ziplock.  Like many others I used olive oil, fresh ginger and lots of garlic.  I did add about 1/4 cup dry sherry.  I doubled the recipe and kept some to the side for basting on the bbq. I only marinated it for 2 hours, it would be fabulous if marinated overnight.

This recipe was a hit! I used olive oil instead of peanut, and added a single size container of diced peaches just as an experiment, and it tasted GREAT. We cooked it on foil with the edges turned up, and spooned the extra marinade on top occasionally as it cooked. We only let it sit for an hour or so, and it still was moist and tasty. I'll make again for sure.

Yum! Yum! Yum! We eat salmon about once a week, so I am always looking for new ways  to prepare it.  My husband and I both loved this.  Followed recipe exactly, but cooked in the oven...combination of broiling and baking.  Will definitely keep this!

Very good! We had to broil it in the oven but it would be even better on the grill as recipe calls for. Great tasting, and it's the kind of recipe you can play with if you're short on something and it will still be great!

We had too much food, so this ended up marinating for 24 hours.. and it was SO GOOD.  Bought wild Alaskan salmon from Pikes Market... I highly recommend the freshest salmon you can get.

This marinade is great! I doubled this recipe for a get together and people couldn't get enough of the salmon. The compliments just kept on coming.

I marinated the salmon for 6 hours and I don't know why, but I could barely taste any of the marinade after I cooked it. I thought this recipe was just okay. I love salmon and enjoy many other recipes from this site (grilled salmon kyoto and baked salmon fillets dijon are two faves) but I was really disappointed with this. I don't know what happened.

This recipe turned out very flavorful even after only 2 hours of marinating (I was running late!).  I made the marinade per the recipe instructions, then I tasted it - I thought the flavor of the vinegar was a bit to prominent, and wanted a bit more sweetness, so I added about a tablespoon of Mirin (sweet cooking Sake).  I tasted again, and still thought the vinegar was a bit strong, but went with it.  I'm glad I did because the flavor of the sauce on the grilled fish was perfect!

Terrific!  I made it with freshly grated ginger and dialed back the brown sugar since we don't like to taste sugar in a recipe.  I also tripled the recipe to have plenty of extra sauce (can never have too much).  It was a serious crowd pleaser and so easy to make.  I will be making it again.

Really good!!!  I only marinaded it for 6 hours so the flavor didn't come through as good.  I would definitely leave it to marinade overnight.

Excellent! You must marinate overnight or all day to get the full flavor. At the suggestion of others, I used a full tablespoon of fresh ginger, 2 cloves of garlic and substituted olive oil for the peanut oil. I didn't use green onions simply because I didn't have any. Will add next time to see if it's really needed but it was so good even without. My family agrees...it's a keeper!

This by far is the best grilled salmon I've tasted.  While I'm sure the peanut oil adds a lot of flavor, I stuck with my heart-healthy extra virgin olive oil and used two substitutions which helped boost the flavors (honey instead of sugar, then minced ginger instead of powder).  Awesome, and big thanks to the submitter!

Wow, This was outstanding! My wife and I thought this is the best marinade I've ever used for salmon. Like other reviewers, I substituted olive oil for peanut oil. One reviewer said it was too sweet, but I did not find it so. I thought it was the perfect balance of vinegar to sugar. This recipe is now in my permanent collection.

This recipe was fantastic!  I always had one favorite salmon recipe because nothing else was as good.  Now I have this one to alternate with my old recipe.  I want to have salmon again tonight, it was so good.  The only thing I did differently was use olive oil instead of peanut.

We enjoyed salmon steaks grilled with this marinade.  I adjusted the seasonings slightly ie: use 1 tbsp fresh ginger grated, 2 cloves of garlic, 1 tbsp of brown sugar. The result was tastey!!

This makes a great tasting marinade, we couldn't stop sampling it. But after marinating the salmon for a few hours before grilling, I was a little disappointed. I think I was expecting a real knock out dish base on the great reviews, it was good and we all enjoyed it...but it was not a memorable dish. I will try it again but maybe with scallops or chicken. Or, I could just drink it straight up!

Liked the salmon but would have to agree with some of the other reviews that it was a  little bland even with a seven or eight hour marinade.  Needs more spice and flavor.

Marinated about 12 hours, then cooked over indirect coals and was very tasty.  Used veggie oil instead of peanut and rice vinegar in place of balsamic.

just made this last night and it turned out awesome. :) followed the recipe nearly exactly except used canola oil instead of peanut, added more garlic, and grilled the salmon on my cast-iron stove-top grill. salmon was very moist and tender. hubby loved it and so did my picky 17 month old toddler. will prob decrease amount of red pepper flakes next time so it's not as spicy for my toddler. thanks for the recipe christine!

I must admit, I have never liked Salmon and I don't like soy sauce. But my husband likes both, so I thought I'd try this. I followed the recipe exactly, except I left out the red pepper flakes and let it marinade for about 12 hours. It was really good! I would have liked to have seen it have more of the marinade flavor, so next time I'll try others' suggestions to wrap it in tin foil for most of the cooking time, then transfer it directly to the grill for the last few minutes. But this has been the best fish dinner I have made so far. Thank you!

I made this tonight and it was delicious.  I did not realize it had to marinate 6 hours so only managed about 1.5 but it was still gorgeous so can only imagine it is even better with more time.  I added some black sesame seeds because, well, why not?  But otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Okay, I doubled the garlic but I always assume the garlic clove number is a suggestion rather than a hard rule!  My 9 and 12 year old kids loved it too.  Grilled it on the gas barbecue on high for 10 minutes and it was perfect.  Thank you!  This is going onto a recipe card tonight!

This was delicious.  I did add a little more brown sugar than called for to make it a thicker glaze and used fresh ginger since I think the flavor is so much better.  It turned out to be one of the best salmon recipes we've ever had and I'll definitely make it again.  Thanks Christine.

Excellent and very flavorful. I did not have ginger or sesame on hand, but did have the sesame ginger marinaide made by Lawry's. It worked very well.  Also did not have peanut oil, veggie oil worked just fine as a substitute.

This was fantastic! I served it to my husband that does not like salmon or much fish for that matter and he loved it. He usually puts tons of tarter sauce on any fish he eats. This one he said needed nothing. It was great the way it was. Everyone wants the recipe! Thanks so much. I did not have peanut oil so I used olive oil. It did not make a difference.

This dish is excellent! Even my 'non-fish eaters' enjoyed it. Followed the recipe exactly and was so surprized at how good it was. Now that I have everyone finally eating fish, I will be making this again and again!

Very, very tasty.  I didn't have peanut oil, so I used canola, which I'm sure changed the taste but it was still incredibly good.  I had one filet left over that went on top of a garden salad the next day - wow!  I will be making this again and again.

I made this exactly as written with the exception of using garlic powder instead of minced garlic.  Also, I grilled it wrapped in tinfoil.  It was amazing!  I am not a salmon lover, but I can't wait to make this again.  Probably even this week!  Such a fantastic marinade.

I made this for the family tonight and everyone LOVED it.  It turned out prefect and was so tender and delicious.  I'm bot a big fan of salmon and I kept sneaking bites of the leftovers.  I made 7 fillets and there was only 1 1/2 left (for a family of 7).  Even my dad said it needed to go in the recipe box.

LOVED IT! I did omit the ginger and sesame oil. Family pref. I let it marinate over night. I baked it, I almost blackened it but so moist inside. Children loved it! I will make this again.

The marinade had a great blend of flavors and nicely penetrated the fish. Next time I think I'll try it with a different type of fish, though, as salmon has so much flavor all by itself.

Fantastic! This salmon was excellent! I found this recipe last week but I didn't have any peanut oil, I even thought about using olive oil instead and I'm glad I waited to go to the grocery store first. All the ingredients in this recipe blend well and I do not recommend omitting anything except the salt.  Thanks Christine!

Wonderful stuff, this dish was an instant hit at my dinner party. I made a few alterations since I not only was limited on time but ingredients as well. Instead of peanut oil I used extra virgin olive oil and added a splash more sesame oil to give the marinade the intended flavor. I also added thin slices of ginger to give each bite a pleasant kick. I was only able to marinade the salmon for an hour so I forked the fish before pouring the sauce over it in hopes that the fish would soak in the flavor faster. Instead of grilling, I baked the dish at 400 degrees for fifteen minutes with a foil cover since the salmon piece was rather thin. The last five minutes of cooking, I poured the extra marinade I whipped up and was able to achieve a handsome glaze on the finished product.

Great flavor.  I didn't have ginger, but that didn't seem to matter, it still tasted great.  I used a blender instead of the whisk to really puree things which I think helped really blend the ingredients.  I would recommend using a zipper style bag for the marinade instead of the pan to get the best coverage.  Yummy!

One of the best marinades for salmon I've ever tried - the perfect amount of sweetness and zest without overpowering the fish. I only had about 2 1/2 hours to let the salmon marinade last night, but it turned out terrific anyway. Next time I'll go for the full 4-6 hours, and I'm sure it will be even more scrumptious!

I followed exactly... doubling the quantity for a nearly 2# salmon fillet. I cut it up into pieces and pricked all over with a fork.  I'd gotten a late start on the marinating process... so I left it at room temp for 30 minutes before sticking it in the fridge (flipped it after 15 minutes on the counter) and then took it out again when I started the grill, so another 10 on the counter.  It was awesome... and the flavor excellent... my kids actually like salmon... and this is another way to cook it up.  A definite keeper!  Served with brown rice and salad.  PERFECT!

really great, be sure to marinate over night and using fresh ginger is key to the fresh taste. I broiled mine in the oven for a party, everyone loved it. they took so much home there was none left for me! hey!

This was an okay recipe but the Grilled Salmon I recipe is easier and better tasting.  I made both and served the fish side by side and everyone felt that the other one was superior.

This is a really good marinade.  I grilled salmon and tilapia and they were both good although my husband and I liked the salmon better. And, I usually do not like salmon so this was really unusual that I likes it so much. I used a little more garlic than what was called for but everything else I used according to the recipe.

I would love to give this even more stars!!  I made this as directed but marinated overnight!!  WOW what a great flavour!  Once again I need to mention be so careful not to overcook your fish...it goes realy fast!  and it continues to cook even after leaving the heat!

I think this is the best fish recipe I have ever made.  I used tilapia instead of salmon and I marinaded it for 24 hours.  I baked it all in the marinade at 450 degrees for 30 minutes, and it was great - didn't even taste like fish!

I mixed up the sesame oil for the peanut oil.  So the sesame flavor was a bit strong.  But that was my mistake, not the recipe and it was flavorful and delicious.

Very yummy!  Since my grill was buried in snow (it's minnesota in december) I sautéed the fish after marinating for 2 hours and the marinade burned a little bit.  I think it could use a little more time in the marinade and next time it's snowy I'll try my grill pan.  I also substituted honey for brown sugar and used low sodium soy sauce and no extra salt.

This is very good.  I made this as directed but only marrinated it for a couple hours because I couldn't wait any longer.  This will be awesome when my patience if better. I would however double the marrinade, then after the fish is done marrinating, I would thicken this on the stove and serve it drizzled over the fish after cooking.  I really believe that people who don't like salmon over cook it.  Mine turned out moist and oh so good.  Thanks for a fantastic meal.

Interesting combination of flavors.  I used a lot more garlic and mixed everything in the blender.  I let the salmon marinate for a couple of hours and still thought it was pretty flavorful.  I didn't grill it but after wiping away excess marinade, seared it in a hot cast iron skillet with a little olive oil for about 8 minutes on one side, brushed the top with honey and finished it under the broiler.  I will make this again.

Made this for NYE, it was OK, just not the "Oh-my-gosh-grandslam" I anticipated from other ratings/reviews.  Liked the kick the ginger provides.  Very easy recipe.

I have grown tired of baked/poached salmon, and this was my first attempt at grilled salmon. I absolutely loved it (as did everyone else). I marinated it overnight, and the flavor came through really well! Will definitely make again.

This was yummy and easy. I personally would have liked more garlic and fresh ginger, but overall it turned out great. I didn't have green onions, but will add them next time. I used Salmon steaks and put them in a ziploc with the marinade overnight. Grilled them on a George Foreman Grill and they turned out great.

We loved it.  We really like salmon and find that many marinades mask that wonderful natural flavor. This recipe was a wonderful compliment to the salmon and it preserved that natural flavor.

Delicious!  Have tried this recipe both on the grill and in the oven.  Made some adjustments based on others' suggestions (i.e. using fresh ginger, adding more garlic). Also used reduced sodium soy sauce.

This was OK, but thought it needed more flavor.  Will try again omitting the vinegar, adding brandy, more soy sauce, and more garlic, just dump it in a Ziploc and add the salmon, turning occasionally.

I've never been a big fan of cooked salmon, I've tried to sway myself with many different recipes and was so glad to come across this one.  It is my go to.  I often substitute olive oil for peanut oil as I don't always have that on hand, and sadly living in the city I do not have access to a proper grill, but I use a Cuisinart griddler and it turns out perfect.

I did this recipe and I made my own butter milk recipe with what I had on hand. (mixing sour cream, blue Agave, vinegar along with all seasoning advised) set it over night.  It was so tender and so juicy for frying that you did not need to cut it up into smaller pieces. Thanks again John.

I made this and it turned out fantastic.  I did as another user suggested and cooked the salmon in a foil pouch and then finished it on the grill at the end.  The marinade was perfect.

Wow, I finally made the best salmon that my husband I have ever had!   Used this with fresh Loch Duart Scottish salmon from the market, and holy cow, was it amazing!  Only substitute was olive oil for peanut oil. And we grilled directly on the rack and still held its flavors.

Perfect as written. The secret is to marinate the salmon long enough to infuse the flavor into it. Yum!

The marinade smelled wonderful, mouthwatering even but I was so disappointed by the flavor. It was very bland. I marinated my fillets for four hours but  I don't think two more hours would have mattered. I'm sorry, I wanted to like it.

The longer you marinade the salmon the better to emphasize the flavor of the marinade. It is quick on the grill goes too fast when eating. Make extra marinade, put it in a small saucepan and bring to a boil on medium-high heat. Reduce heat until just bubbling. Cook until the sauce thickens adding mixture of 2 tbsp water and 1 tbsp cornstarch if necessary. We absolutely love it with a side of pasta parmesan or wild rice and steamed vegetables.

Lol, after my boyfriend made this for me, I realized that it's essentially the same recipe as the Firecracker Grilled Alaska Salmon (on this site) that I've been making for ages.  

Seriously an awesome recipe.  I've managed to convert non-salmon eaters with it.  The spice is great (though we usually add extra) and the flavour is phenomenal whether you grill or bake.

We found this recipe to be very average, and a bit bland for our tastes.  I thought the variety of seasonings would give it some depth, but was disappointed.  We much prefer the Grilled Salmon I recipe from this site.

Very good. I skipped adding the brown sugar, but I think I would add it next time to make it a tad sweeter.

I think this recipe is a great one!  Thanks to this recipe, my dislike of salmon has become a like - once a week!  The only changes I make to it are to eliminate the green onion, and use olive oil instead of peanut oil.  Soak the salmon overnight & grill - excellent flavor!  I find that the flavor comes out stronger with the more ginger you use.  Thanks for the recipe - it's a keeper!

This is the best salmon recipe ever! I used a nice peanut oil and I wouldn't substitute on that ingredient. It's a great mix of zesty with a kick, but mild enough for kids. I can't tell you how many compliments I got from the real foodies at our last cookout, a total hit! And so easy!

I just served this to guests and it got rave reviews.  My husband is not crazy about salmon & he even liked it!  I followed the directions, except used fresh ginger as suggested.  I only marinated for two hours 'cause of time constraints, can't wait to try it again when I have more time...definitely a keeper!

Everyone enjoyed it and the flavor was great. I doubled both the garlic and the brown sugar, used fresh grated ginger and used olive oil instead of peanut oil. I marinaded it in a Ziploc for a little over 6 hours. Although I did appreciate how the flavor complimented the salmon I personally enjoy a bit bolder flavor so I will try marinading it overnight and probably add even a little more garlic. Thanks for the great recipe!

Served this for company last night and got RAVE reviews!! I'm usually one to alter recipes, but the ONLY change for this one was to use olive oil in place of the peanut oil. Marinaded it for nearly 6 hours and the flavor was just right -- none of the ingredients over-powering, but just right! Thanks for a keeper!!

This recipe is fantastic!  So flavourful!  I omitted the peanut oil, and salt, and used chili paste (about 2-3tsp.) instead of the red pepper flakes, but otherwise followed the recipe.  It was raining, so we couldn't barbecue, but it turned out beautifully using the grill functon in the oven.  Oh, and I saved the marinade, added some water, and boiled it to make a sauce (though the fish doesn't really need it).  Thanks for a wonderful recipe that will be made for many occasions!

I liked this recipe alot, but my friends and roommates RAVED over it.  They liked this even better than Grilled Salmon I.  I personally loved Grilled Salmon I better, but that is just me.  I did not change a thing.  I followed the recipe exactly as it is written.

Whenever I make salmon now, I can't resist not marinating it with this sauce. Turns boring old salmon into a very exciting dish. Great hot off the BBQ!:)

This was pretty delicious to have for dinner. I've made some small adjustments to this meal. Since I didn't have any balsamic vinegar on hand, I've made it from scratch. Instead of grilling since I have no grill or barbecue, I've cooked it for 6 minutes in the oven. Instead of four hours in the fridge, I did 2.5 hours with foil and a ramekin. I've paired it with fries. I would love to make it again someday.

the marinade smelled wonderful, and tasted wonderful on my finger. wish i could have tasted it on the salmon. i marinated the salmon for 4.5 hours and no flavor from the marinade at all, just oily. maybe as another person suggested, put it in foil with the marinade and bake it in the oven, but then lose the wonderful grill flavor...

Restaurant quality recipe. In fact, I haven't ordered salmon from a restaurant since finding this marinade because it's the best tasting salmon there is and it's cheaper to make it myself! Easy and delicious.

I had wild caught Alaskan salmon in the freezer and wanted to try this for a quick and easy after work dinner. I didn't have peanut oil so I subbed  olive oil and I used onion powder since hubby dislikes onions. I didn't plan far enough ahead and only had time to marinade for about 1 - 1-1/2 hours. Next time I will do for longer. I grilled this on a cedar plank over a charcoal grill for about 12 minutes. Cooked perfectly. I would try this again.

This is my all time favorite salmon recipe.  The flavor is amazing.  My kids love to eat salmon prepared this way.  It's not too spicy and is a nice change from the typical lemon and dill recipes.  Delicious!

Great flavor.  Before I tried this marinade, I didnT like the taste of salmon.  This brown sugar and soy sauce did the trick.  I love the fact that we can eat the healthy salmon and finally enjoy the taste. Tha

4/14/14 - We really enjoyed this - the green onion showed up nicely on the salmon, it had a nice flavor that wasn't overpowering.  Marinated for about an hour on each side.  Would definitely do again and recommend!

Oh So Good,  I feel that you have to follow the recipe exactly as written, and at least rate how you feel about it, before changing it.  This is one that I will not change, as it was that good.

...WOW! I added more garlic than called for and let the salmon steaks marinade for six hours or so. The flavor was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! Will definitely make again. Thank you for the great recipe! :)

Delicious! Grilled about 8" from coals for about 15 minutes at 450 degrees F. Flaky and perfectly done from end to end. Thanks for the great marinade.

Great marinade!  The only changes I made were using olive oil instead of peanut (what I had on hand), omitted green onion, lower sodium soy sauce, more garlic, & omitted the salt.  We're  trying to cut down on sodium, and as good as it was, it didn't need it.  I marinated it for several hours and baked on 400 for about 20 minutes or so.  Delicious.  Used leftovers in salmon salad the following day.  I can't wait to try again & grill salmon vs. bake, and to try with other meats.

This is reminiscent of a Teriyaki sauce.  I'm not a fan but the rest of my family is, so in the spirit of goodwill, I made this for dinner.  It had excellent flavor - a little sweet for me (who wasn't a fan in the first place!) but they LOVED it.  I will make this again.  The men ate every last bit! Kitchen notes:  I forgot to marinate in advance so I just added the sauce, and I pan-cooked it as we have terrible experiences with losing our fish in the grill :-)  The flavor was still well-developed but I'll bet marinating it would deepen the flavor even more.

Excellent!  I've made this a few times and found that it is even better with fresh ginger, but the powdered is fine if that's all you have!  Never made it with peanut oil, so no comment there, but definitely plan ahead for this one, because the marinating time makes all the difference.  Even my fish-ambivalent kids liked this!

This marinade is pretty good but not fabulous. I marinated my salmon overnite and while it was flavorful, I feel that it lacked a little something.
