Ironically I came on here to sumbit almost this exact recipe - and I am also from Indiana?! I just had these for the first time this past Sunday at a pitch in. They were the BEST potatoes I've EVER had (although I had been drinking). They were gone in a flash, and had a much more complex flavor than you would think from the ingredients. *My version uses a bit less Mayo (we used Miracle Whip) and we put a can of chopped black olives over the top. YOU HAVE TO MAKE THIS!

If I could give TEN stars to this I would.  I did add about 1/2 cup of sour cream before baking.  Everyone raved about these. My friend and her husband insisted on getting the recipe. Will definitely be making these again (and again and again)!!!

I used canned potatoes instead of baked and sharp cheese instead of alternative. It is wonderful and quick! My family loved it and it tastes like it took a long time!

I am asked to make this recipe for every picnic and party that I go to.  I usually have to make it at least 10 times each summer!  I typically double the recipe because so many people love it.  I skimp a little on the mayo, add some dijon mustard and I also add some of the bacon drippings to it.  Unhealthy I know but good!

This was one of the best recipes I've used from this site. Put two fried eggs on top with some toast on the side and you have the perfect breakfast, or serve it alone for an awsome side dish.

Reduced this to serve 6 instead of 16.  Used about 3.5 tbs mayo, mozzarella cheese instead of velveeta and cooked it about 30 minutes.  It turned out great and the leftovers are yummy, too.

My family loved this recipe.  I was looking for a recipe to use up a huge take-home container of french fries that were a bit on the dry side.  Like others, I added sour cream, and they were moist and delicious.

This was tasty. I did make a few changes. I baked my potatoes instead of boiling them. Also left the skin on them when I cubed them after baking. I didn't have any processed cheese so I used cheddar which was fantastic. Also added some freeze dried chives. Thanks for the recipe the family loved it.

This is seriously delicious. I didn't have onions, so I added onion powder and sprinled soy parmesean cheese throughout instead of processed cheese. What really added flavor was to pour some bacon drippings into the mixture in the baking dish.  Yummy!  Will make over and again!

Very tasty... my husband loved it!  I would have preferred a low-cal version with low-fat cheddar cheese and turkey bacon... it seemed very fattening.

I made a big mistake from the beginning of this recipe, but it didn't hurt it at all!  I didn't have the recipe in front of me, so I boiled my potatoes for about 35-45 minutes.  When I pulled out the recipe, I realized that I made a mistake.  I peeled all of the potatoes and cut them into large chunks.  Now for the best part... Instead of baking the potato salad, I ended up melting the cheese and the mayo in the microwave together.  After that, I folded the cheese mixture, crumbled bacon, and diced onion into the potatoes separately.  

I told my friends to be honest, and they told me that they loved this recipe!  They liked that this wasn't a typical "mustardy" or "mayo" saturated dish.  The cheese and bacon really compliment each other.

Sorry, I just didn't think this was anything that great.  It was alright, but nothing to rave about.  Maybe I should have used cheddar and added sour cream as someone suggested.

This is good as is but I like to add a few extra things. I add some salt, pepper and mustard powder to the mayo mix, some shredded cheddar, and then drizzle a tiny bit of bacon fat on top before cooking. YUM!

If you make this as a cold potato salad it is delightful... I also added a little miracle whip and sour cream don't forget green  onions and a dash of salt and pepper... I am from Indiana and this is how my mom made cold potato salad... Rave reviews by everyone when I've taken it to BBQ's. Never any leftovers.

I want to make this but am confused. Is this served hot or cold? Sounds good hot, but not sure how it would be at a picnic?? Obviously I am not from Indiana! I gave it a 4, because it sounds so good.

Lord have mercy!  This is sooo yummy and swoon worthy!  I used half mayonnaise and half sour cream.  Dy-no-myte!  In trying to cut the cook time down, I lightly browned the onions in the same skillet I used to cook the bacon and drained both.  My microwave has a "half-time" feature and I cooked the completed dish at 350 degrees for 15-20 minutes.  Everything is already cooked and it just needed for the cheese to melt (used grated cheddar).

This was very tasty. I used shredded cheese (a 5-cheese blend) instead of processed, added a little sour cream that I had left over and freshly ground pepper, and used green onions instead of regular onions. I also used serrano ham instead of bacon to cut down on fat. The reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the ham on top started to burn around the edges after about 45 minutes while the potatoes weren't quite done, so I had to cover the casserole with foil. (I can imagine what would have happened with already crisp bacon, as called for in the recipe.) Otherwise, it's a great recipe.
