I didn't find this recipe to be quick, but it was easy.  They mini-calzones make a great appetizer and can even be used for dinner.  I found 16 minutes cooking time to be too long (burned a batch), so make sure you keep your eye on them.  Overall it turned out to be a great recipe for some extra ricotta I had on-hand, and I plan to make them again.

My boyfriend & I made this recipe a week or so ago, and it was great. The dinner rolls work great as a casing! I made it again yesterday, only I used broccoli (chopped up & sauteed with the onions) and pepperoni, and I added more salt & pepper and put in a little rosemary as well. It was delicious!

This recipe was OK. I doubled the ricotta and should have halfed the spinach..it was overkill and needed more cheese. I only cooked them for 10 minutes and the bottoms burned. Next time I'd reduce the cooking temp. to 350 and only cook for 10 minutes or so. I'd make again but do the above changes.

I saueteed diced mushrooms and red peppers along with the onion - and used crescent rolls (2 triangles per pocket). This was a fun recipe although not quick. I baked them for 10 minutes at the recommended temperature and received good results.

I love this recipe.  I was able to freeze 1/2 of the calzones for another dinner.  I did use pizza dough instead of dinner rolls..much easier.  I also added some italian sausage to hide the spinach taste for DH.  Great recipe!!!

These were not quick, but they were fairly easy. I really liked them; my fiance was not a huge fan of the crust. I followed someone else's suggestion to cook them at 350,  but I think this was a little too low as they never really browned. Next time I would try 375 or 400.

These are just "okay".  They take a long time to make and don't really have much flavour.  The filling is pretty bland.  I won't make these again.

I, personally, did not like the "bread".  Next time I will make a pizza dough and do this "right" as the taste did not correspond with the effort.  With that said, I love the filling.  I added sausage to this and it was amazing.  It makes a ton so we have saved the filling (in the freezer) to be used in the future - the "right" way.

Really good. I added sausage and zucchini to mine, and I just made two large calzones for my husband and me for dinner. They were tasty!

Good calzone recipe for this beginner! This recipe was my intro to making calzone, and I have made it 4-5x.  Like several other reviewers, I made my own pizza dough, mainly to save money and have simpler ingredients; once I commit to making it-it's easy.  Made enough dough for two pizzas, to be sure to have enough for all the delicious filling in this recipe.  The nutmeg is great in it; subtle but there. Have made them the mini-size in this recipe and also larger.  Had a little problem with overly thick crust and overfilling; nothing to do with this recipe but watch for that if you are new to calzones.  
Big hit with friends and family!  So tasty we didn't even bother dipping them in marinara sauce most of the time!

Great dish to prepare ahead of time.  The filling was very green so I doubled the ricotta and added extra mozzarella.  I used croissant dinner rolls which made the crust light and flaky.  16 min. was a bit too long for the fresh calzones but worked for the fronzen ones the next day.

I'm at odds with this recipe. I searched high and low for 11.3 oz canned rolls, but came up empty. I settled for a 10 oz can and bought two. Try as I might, the biggest circles I could roll with those things was 5". Even then they were very thin. I could only use a rounded tablespoon of the filling in each one. These were very tasty, but I have more than half the filling leftover after using one can of the rolls. I'm planning to use the other can to make 10 more, but I'll probably still have filling after that. I can't imagine that 8 rolls from an 11.3 oz can could possibly hold all of the filling. These do taste good, but if I make them again I'll make a pizza dough for the crust.

DH and I made this recipe together and we did not have success with it. The dinner roles tasted more like the corn meal than pastries and the filling was not as cheesy as we would have liked.

You can defeat the packaged taste of canned dinner rolls and frozen spinach by mixing up the filling. We threw in some ground meat, red pepper flakes, basil, fun cheeses, etc. Really whatever's on hand because it's a pretty versatile recipe.

Made my own dough by hand (used Pizza Dough I recipe, actually) and made two large calzones out of this. I added about 1/4 c of italian tomato sauce to give some more flavor to the filling but left everything the same otherwise. REALLY good.

The first words out of my husband's mouth, "this is delicious!" Within minutes he was ready for another serving. I used thin crust pizza dough and will definately make this recipe again.

The filling was great.  The rolls didn't work out so well.  Next time I'll take the trouble to make fresh dough.

Time consuming but good.  I added some browned italian sausage to half of them because my husband doesn't consider it a meal if there is no meat involved.

My husband really liked them.  I used pizza dough because I had it made already and they turned out fine.  I used a little bit more cheese b/c I wanted to finish it off, but he said he would have them again.

AWESOME!   While visiting my daughter for Christmas, she and my granddaughter made this recipe for dinner.  She tripled the recipe to have some for freezing.  I had never had a calzone before, so this was new to me.  Hubby loved them too!  This is a recipe that will be made again and again!  Thanks for sharing!
