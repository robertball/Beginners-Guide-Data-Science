This is wassail the way it should be--tart, spicy, and not overly sweet.  I did end up using less lemon juice because it was a little TOO tart for even me; however, I was using the bottled stuff which might have had something to do with it.  Also, if the 8+ hour time frame is a turn-off for some, it can be made on the stovetop.  I let it simmer for about 45 minutes and it tasted just as good.

I love how this recipe doesn't require any sugar and uses only juice and spices.  I had everything on hand, and I even used a chunk of peeled, fresh ginger instead of the dried.  I made it Sunday morning (in the crockpot) and we had it after dinner when we got home from church.  Very yummy!

I followed the original recipe and did find it a little tart (as others have noted), but after adding a little extra apple cider, it was great!  I made it at 8am for a party that night, and it got a lot of compliments!

I thought the recipe needed a little more zip. I added 1/4 cup red hots
replaced 1 quart of apple juice for 1 quart red grapefruit juice

Very good. I didn't know what it was suppose to taste like but everyone enjoyed it. I had some spiced rum on the side for those who wanted to 'kick-it-up' a bit. And, I did add some cranberry juice. I loved the one reviewers suggestion of a cloved decorated orange. It really looked festive as well as being functional (no cheesecloth needed).  Thanks!

Not quite what I was hoping for.  I love hot spiced drinks but this is not one that I will be making again.  It smells good but the flavor just isn't there.

This is an awesome recipe. We, too, used real ginger. That really does make a difference I think. And then we added a quart of Spiced Rum in place of one quart of apple juice. Man, let me tell you. We were HAMMERED! It was great! Thanks Bea!

I stuck about 20 cloves into a whole orange and put that into the punch instead of just tossing them in.  This is delicious, very simple to prepare and makes the whole kitchen smell wonderful!

I threw a holiday party last year and we made Wassail and Hot Chocolate.  They were both a big hit.  We left the alcohol on the side so that people could add their own and it worked out great.

This is so close to my families recipe, I just HAD to comment! We make a larger batch. We use one gallon apple cider, one can frozen orange juice, one can frozen pineapple juice, and then for the spices, we get "mulling spices". They have ALL the spices, from Cinnamon sticks to nutmeg and ginger and a few others. We place 6 tablespoons in cheese cloth, (then your not picking out the spices before serving). THEN, we slice 2 lemons and two oranges and float them on top while it cooking in a crock pot Yummy!!! You can place a cinnamon stick in each cup. Wassail is a standard  holiday hot drink after dinner. I introduced this to my Son-in-laws family and they simply went nuts over it. In each cup, I make sure everyone gets a floating lemon or orange. They too can be eaten.  Thanks so much, for the chance to share our tradition!!!! Your version is really really good!!

Very good! I think it tasted too orange juicy though and I only used 1/4 cup of lemon juice instead of 1/2 cup.  Once I added a little more cider it was nearly perfect.

This is a great hot drink recipe that will warm you up! The flavors blended together so well and the lemon juice added a nice ZING to it! All the guests at our dinner tonight loved it and I had rave reviews from my family who didn't know I've become quite the cook with help from allrecipes.com!!! Thanks so much Bea....be sure to try this great Wassail recipe this holiday season!

Pretty good. Tyhe first time I made this I forgot the giner - it was still good. I think it really makes a difference if you cook it a little longer. My husband thought the lemon influence was a bit much, so I added some sugar.

This is a pretty good punch but was a little to strong for me.  Next time I will add a cup or 2 of water.  Has flavor is good and has just the right amount of spice.

I added a little whiskey for a December Bears tailgate.   I also added a sliced lemon and sliced orange.  It was a little citrusy.  Next time I will leave out the lemon and orange juice, and use only the sliced fruit.

This is a really tasty recipe.  I followed some of the advice in the reviews and cut the lemon juice down to 1/4 cup (used the bottled kind) and stuffed the cloves in 2 halved clementines.  I put all the ingredients in a crock pot and cooked it on high until it simmered for about an hour then turned it down to low.  The total cooking time was less than 8 hours.  It was delicious and was a big hit at othe family Christmas Eve gathering.  It will be a tradition from now on!

This is a wonderful recipe and it makes my house smell so good!! The cinnamon sticks and cloves do sink to the bottom after several hours but can get in your drink if the liquid is getting low. You can wrap these up in a cheesecloth to avoid this. My Godmother also stuck cloves in a half of an orange--this was great also. Overall, a wonderful recipe!!!

I don't like Wassail, but I thought this punch was really good.  Everyone else liked it too. Super easy and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I'll use this again.

I've seen this recipe in another source. It also calls for caramond pods, raisins and crystalized ginger. Go figure???

I made this for Thanksgiving and I am now making it for every gathering. I forgot the lemon juice once and it still turned out fine. I put the juices together the night before and refrigerate overnight. I then pour it all into the slow cooker with the cloves pushed into an orange as others suggested, and also the cinnamon sticks. The aroma is fabulous and everyone finishes it before I have a chance to try it. Thanks

I had to do this for fifty people. The recipe came up weird when I converted it. Basically it amounted to a dash of this, a splash of that. What I concluded is, this recipe is very forgiving. What I made might have been close to the original. Might not. But everyone loved it.

I love this and have made it for years every  Christmas Eve, although, instead of lemon juice, I use 1/2 cup of cranberry juice. I do add just a couple of Tablespoons of sugar because I like it a little sweeter. It is wonderful for a sore throat and clearing out congestion too for those wintry nights.

Very good, but doesn't need to cook for 8 hours. We used a crock pot and cooked for the full 8 hours and it tasted the same after 2-3 hours as it did after 8 hours. Smells great! Nice tangy flavor. We used fresh lemons (you only need 2 lemons so opt for the fresh ones...makes a difference!)

I (luckily) made  two batches of this. My family and friends were drinking this all day long. I put this in the crock pot over night and in the morning my entire house smelled wonderful. My only suggestion is to not be impatient like me.  I went overboard with the cinnamon so i i had to make another batch to dilute the cinnamon....Recipe is best as is instructed.

Have tried several Wassail recipes over the years but this one really stands out.
Even my teenagers enjoyed this one and kept going back for more.

I doubled the recipe.
I used pasteurized, unfiltered cider.
I juiced lemons for the required juice, did not use prepared.  I used a premium, no pulp orange juice.
Mixed it all up, floated a clove studded orange in it and simmered it until it had reduced about 1/2 inch from where I had started in a 6 quart kettle.

Just before serving I added honey to sweeten it up a bit.

I made this following the exact ingredients on the list in their exact measurements. I was very pleased with the way it came out - I didn't think it was too tart at all! The trick is making sure it has thoroughly cooked itself for awhile. I had to make mine on the stovetop for a shorter amount of time than was listed. It simmered there for a few hours and the flavors mixed well when it had been cooking for awhile longer. This is so easy to make I will be doing it again, and yes it smelled wonderful!!

This was definitely delicious.  I used a package of mulled spices from the grocery store and just put in cider and orange juice.  I let them sit in the crock pot for about 6 hours on low and then turned it up to high for the last 30 or so minutes.  I strained the wassail and put a little bit of spiced rum in the bottom of the mugs- so so yummy, and the whole house smelled amazing.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Loved this recipe!  I am a huge fan of apple cider, and I loved how these flavors came together and complemented each other! I will be making this again for my New Year's Day brunch! (... as well as for when I just want to curl up with a good book and a lovely seasonal beverage!)

We all loved this! It was a little tart, but I would prefer that over it being too sweet. I might try cutting the lemon in half next time, but really loved the flavor! No added sugar which is really a bonus!

Love this recipe!   I've made it 3 times in the last 3 days.  :)  I added the recommended 1/4 cup lemon juice, however my favorite-tasting batch was the one where I completely omitted the lemon juice.   I've found that the longer this cooks, the better it tastes, so don't get impatient.  Let your crock pot do its thing!  And I agree with everyone else--my house smells amazing when I make this!

A citrus twist on warm spiced apple cider. Easily modifiable based on preference. Could lend a tropical flare to the holiday season with a little pineapple juice. Be carefully of the acidic content of citrus to already acidic cider.

I made this for an open house we had for our new neighbors this Christmas.  It was such a hit.  Most had never had wassail and found it a real treat.

I loved this recipe.  I always make Wassail for our annual ornament exchange and we always have tons left over.  Not with this one! I only had enough for one extra serving for me!  So easy and delicious!

My family LOVED this recipe. I made it in a stock pot on my stove on a cold day and we enjoyed it all day long. Another comment suggested not adding as much lemon juice, so I cut the amount in half, and was pleased.

This tastes good and can be made with or without spirits. I added some Burgundy to it and it added a wonderful complex flavor to it.

It was good, but too much citrus for us, so  we ended up adding brown sugar and an extra quart of apple juice to balance it out. A good base besides that though.

We have a friend who introduced us to Wassail a few years ago - and it has grown on me! It's become a new festive favorite for my son and I. I resized this for 6 - added additional cider, decreased the lemon and added a cup of cranberry sauce as other reviewers suggested. I would make this again!

Very Good!  For an adult beverage version I added some Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum, which makes it a fab New Year's Open House drink.  I didn't have whole cloves, but will be sticking them in an orange when I get some.

Easy and very tasty.

Absolutely delicious! I didn't use quite as much lemon juice as the recipe called for (I used maybe 1/4 cup of fresh squeezed juice), and it still turned out great.

I used fresh squeezed lemon juice, kirkland brand orange juice, & honeycrisp apple cider. I also used fresh chopped ginger instead of powdered, & added more than what would be the fresh equivalent. Amazing though! My inlaws absolutely loved it!

If you don't have time to let it simmer all day, just add a cup of brown sugar to counter the tartness. Garnish with pinch of allspice and it's 10/10!

I love this recipe! I've been making it every year now. However I do add sugar, or Splenda in my case. Although I did debate on using maple syrup. Plus I added time. The recipe calls for 8 hours, but it was way better after sitting longer. I've started putting mine on the day before.

The apple cider I used is very sweet, so I didn't get any hint of tartness.  I did get a mouth of warmed orange juice and I used 1/2 the amount called for in the recipe and a sliced orange.  I have more cider and a couple hours to fiddle with the it.

I'm in the cast of UT Austin's 37th Annual Madrigal Dinner, where wassail is something of a tradition, so I tried this recipe, and according to the small bit I was able to have before it was all gone, I think it was pretty excellent. 

I somewhat heeded the advice of the comment sections below and basically just added 0.5-1 liter more of apple cider to the same volume of the rest of the ingredients, and I didn't notice it being overbearingly tart or anything. 

I'm also not sure I got the gist of "let simmer" for some time, but what I did was just put a cover on the pot and let it sit on low-temperature for about 8 hours, and that seemed to diffuse the flavor of the cinnamon+cloves just fine.

Anyway, according to my fellow cast-mates, this recipe was definitely a solid 11/10

I agree with other reviews that there was too much lemon juice, which made it a little too sour. Next time I would half it. Out than that, it smelled amazing all day and the other spices were right on. I will be using this again.

We have fixed wassail every year for Christmas, and decided to try this recipe this year. I made it and passed out the cups, and we all decided that something was missing. I added 1/2 cup of honey, and it was perfect. It's a good basic recipe, but was missing honey, a key ingredient in other wassail recipes.

I made this as is, using the big pot on the stove.  The flavor was good, but I thought it over-sweet, or over-something.  It just made me thirsty.  It might be better on a *very* cold day (like the frigid weather we had a week ago but that isn't when I made it).

I used cran-apple juice instead of plain apple. I also omitted the lemon juice and added a couple tablespoons of brown sugar to balance the tartness of the cran-apple juice. It was such a hit at my holiday party that I ran out! I definitely recommend doubling it!

Big hit = new tradition!!  Used "Apple Pie" apple juice instead of cider (because I'm cheap) and extra pulp orange juice.

This turned out great. I've used this recipe for several years now and is a hit with family and the office during the holiday. ALSO-if you simmer it overnight in your crockpot, you will wake up to your house smelling WONDERFUL!

The girls in my office ask for this every Christmas. I usually leave out the lemon juice but it's good either way. We pour it into the coffee pot and keep it warm all day so everyone can enjoy. So easy to throw together.

Made a double batch for a fall b-day party and not a drop was left!  The adults added golden rum to their cups before adding the punch and it was great.  Will be using this recipe again at Xmas.

Very yummy. The lemon was a little strong so I added some extra apple cider and a tablespoon or so of sugar (I like sweet drinks). I was unable to get whole cloves due to it being Christmas season so I just added ground cloves with the rest of the spices. Will definitely make an appearance again next Christmas (and probably sooner!).

Absolutely delish! I made this for our Christmas party and even those who never had it were loving it! I did cut the lemon juice to just a couple of squirts so it would not be so tart and I added 1/4 cup of sugar. Made my home smell absolutely divine! I used to make this when I was younger but I couldn't remember all the stuff in it, so thanks so much for sharing adn bringing back some great memories.

I was a little skeptical about making this since I had never tried to make wassail before.  This was a big hit at my Christmas party.  It was totally gone by the end of the night.  Adding red hot candies to it really adds a special touch, so I highly recommend doing that too.  This was very easy and I will make it again!

This is very good!  I cut the lemon juice in half and added a bit more cider than called for.  Love this stuff around the holidays.  You can even just put it in a crockpot to simmer all day.

Got rave reviews from everyone!  I did add 1/4 cup brown sugar and instead of the spices, I just used a mulling spice mixture and simmered for 45 minutes.  It was so good!  I'll definitely make again.

Made this over the weekend.  It was the perfect touch for a rainy, cold, gray weekend.
