I absolutely loved the outcome of this, but in my mind 1/4 cup of minced garlic and 2 cans of chicken broth was SO unnecessary and excessive.  As the recipe suggests, I used minced garlic to taste, probably a third of what was called for, and only enough chicken broth necessary to allow the bok choy to steam.  I poured enough broth into my large skillet to a depth of about 1/2 inch. Otherwise a great, basic reference recipe for cooking whole baby bok choy, one I know I'll come back to.

I love baby bok choy! But 2 cans of chicken broth is "too much" for 6 heads of baby bok choy so I used an eyeball amount, probably 3/4 cup filled up to the sides of the bok choy. Also I did not add the entire 1/4 cup of minced garlic, only enough to suit my tastes. I lightly seasoned with hawaiian salt, fresh ground black pepper and fresh squeezed lemon right before serving. Delicious! The fresh lemon really adds a lovely zip to the baby bok choy without taking away from the broth, garlic and butter. I 'd prepare this side dish again, the same exact way, with other types of main or asian themed dishes. Tonight I served this along with,"Adobo Chicken with Ginger," and "Roasted Corn with Garlic Rice," all from this website.

I've been cooking baby bok choy this way for a long time . . . and, I agree -- serving with fish and rice makes a lovely meal.  It's so easy and sooo tasty!

Yummy! gave it three stars since I modified it. Instead of butter I used two tablespoons of olive oil, six cloves garlic chopper, 1/4 cup chicken broth and added a handfull of chopped arugula - it was awesome! I needed to clean out the veggie drawer and this was a great combo!

This was my first taste of bok choy, but I had to modify the recipe. I used just enough liquid to steam the greens in a fry pan and skipped the butter. Delicious!!!

I'd never cooked with bok choy before so had no clue. This looked tasty and sounded easy, and we were not disappointed! Very easy and very tasty - two important qualities I look for in a recipe! Although, I lessened the garlic a bit and added some ginger and grated carrots! Yum!

This was my first time making bok choy and we liked this a lot.  I followed the recipe as written and found the amount of garlic to be appropriate for our tastes.  Also I did not find that there was too much chicken broth for the amount of bok choy, I felt it was just right to get it cooked through and slightly wilted.

This was very good! I think the serving size was off as I had way more than 3 servings, but it was still very tasty and now I have leftovers!

First time with cooking/eating bok choy.  Not really a fan, but the recipe is good, I think I just don't care for bok choy.  Love the amount of garlic!  Can never have too much.

This was delicious.  I used two large garlic cloves, and decreased the broth as others suggested.  I only cooked the garlic for 1 minute to avoid it becoming bitter.  The whole baby Bok choy made a nice presentation and is perfect for a dinner party,  but for weeknight family dinners i might try chopping the Bok choy before cooking.

This was great tasting and easy.  I used 1 1/2 cups of broth and two tablespoons of minced garlic (we like garlic).  I will be back with Arnold.

I bought some bok choy...because, well, I like saying bok choy.  I had no clue how to cook it.  I found this recipe and I am now a huge fan.  Next time, I'll cut back on some of the ingredients but this is really a good way to cook it.  Hubby even complimented it and thought it was an excellent way to cook it.  It's a keeper.

I only used about 1/2" of chicken broth in a large saute pan, added the bok choy and sprinkled with jarred garlic. Let steam about 7 min. Removed to plate and topped with lemon juice, salt and pepper. They were tender and delicious. Thanks sweetiesmj!
