I cook for our chiropractic patients on Monday nights so I needed to make something that would feed 20+ people and not take all day to make. I also wanted to use up some frozen seafood in the freezer. This fit the bill! ALL our patients loved it! I made just a couple of changes/additions to accommodate what I already had on hand. A large can of clam juice for the seafood stock, imitation bacon bits instead of bacon (I know, I know, but I have a husband who can't stand bacon-go figure!), and frozen tilapia instead of cod. EVEN with all the frozen/canned substitutions, everyone LOVED it! I did add some sherry at the end because... it just goes great with creamy seafood soups! Also... very important.. it was true to time... I love and respect that. Great job, javaqueen!

I made this last night, and pretty much followed the recipe, except I has slightly less seafood in it because of what I had on  hand. I would make this again, but use MUCH less pepper, and a little less flour.  All in all, a very good recipe.

A Little more work than I planned and pretty costly if you add all of the seafood which I did. Was perfect for Super Bowl with the Patriots playing. Highly recommend.

I was unable to find fresh or frozen raw clams locally, so I added a pound each of shrimp and scallops.  I did not want to use canned or pre-cooked seafood in this recipe.  The mix of seasonings was excellent and the thyme really brought it home!  It was a huge hit at my mother's annual birthday soup dinner, even after riding 110 miles in a crock pot.

I cut all the spices in half, and added only a half teaspoon of pepper. It was delicious !

There must be a typo on the black pepper - should be 1 Teaspoon not 1 Tablespoon - just wasted 4 pounds of great - seafood.
This would be a good chowder if reduced pepper.

Delicious and versatile recipe.  Veggies, broth, and seafood can all be adjusted.  Just keep the adjusted quantities similar.  Same amount of veggies were used, but I added mushrooms, & carrots, but decreased the quantity of potatoes.    For the broth, I used far free half and half, rather than the 2nd can of evaporated milk.  And, I used seafood stock, rather than clam juice.  The one caution I would offer is to use less black pepper.  I decreased it to 2 teaspoons, and it was still overpowering and too hot.

I made a few changes to this recipe, but overall I came out great! Here's what I used, 2 potatos, 3 stalks of celery, 2 cans of minced clams, 1 pound of cod. Everything else I used was the same as recipe. The flavors are delicious. If I had more money I would have added the scallops. I would have also added carrots. It's creamy and has a lot of flavor. Thank for you posting this recipe.
