This was a good, easy and quick to prepare dish.  I didn't have hot chili oil so I mixed some cayenne powder into the mustard and mayo mixture; it probably didn't change the end result very much.

I cut way down on the amount of sauce to make it a little healthier. I also used low fat olive oil mayo and Sriracha instead of hot oil. Usually I just use cajun spices, but wanted to try something a little different. This was outstanding!

I substituted the chile oil for a dash of red pepper and paprika. Then I did not have fresh cilantro so I just added some parsley to the mayonnaise mix. During the broiling part, after I spread the mayonnaise mix on the fish I added a thin slice of lemon on top of each piece. This was sooo delicious! With the lemon it made it so zesty, I bet it would have been great on tacos. The only reason I did not try it on tacos was because it was that good by its self!

So simple, yet fantastic flavor! I laid bacon slices across the fish, on top of the onion, so I left out the butter. Didn't have hot chile oil, so used a little Siracha sauce. Will definitely be making it again soon!

This was great. Instead of catfish I used Swai. Quick, and tastey
