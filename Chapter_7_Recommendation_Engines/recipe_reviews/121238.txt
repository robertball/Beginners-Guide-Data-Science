I loved this dish! I used the Creole Seasoning Blend also found on this site instead of just Cayenne pepper, and it turned out spectacular. Definitely one that I'll keep and pass on to the rest of my family.

Made this dish for new year's eve dinner. It was OK but didn't blow me away. Nice tasty light meal.
