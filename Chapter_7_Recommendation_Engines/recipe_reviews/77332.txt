These were pretty good, but a little bland. I would maybe add some cinnamon to the crust/streusel topping. Also, after sitting out for a while they became a little wet and soggy. Keeping them chilled is a must.

I can't go higher than 4 stars as-is.  It's "good," not great.  I doubled the cranberries per other suggestions, and believe that is necessary.  I think I'll double the cream cheese next time & add an egg to make it more of a "real" cheese cake center, and I'll add some cinnamon to the crust/topping per previous comments.  but I will try it again this holiday season until I find the right combo of ingredients!

This recipe is a good one - I like it and my coworkers LOVE it.  Probably would be better with homemade cranberry sauce if you have it leftover(especially since I make mine with OJ - that would make these heavenly!)

Some tweaking:  I added half-teaspoon or so of cinnamon and a sprinkling of pumpkin pie spice to the crust - good flavor!  Also, I only put about 3/4 cup of oats into the crust initially, and added more flour to make up for it.  I think this made for a sturdier crust.
I mixed an additional 1/4 cup of oats into just the topping part, to give it some crunch.  I also sprinkled the top with additional brown sugar to give it more color.

02-13 These were a big hit at our house! Very rich - a small piece really satisfies the sweet tooth. I reduced the sugar down to 2/3 cup. Perhaps a little more cranberry sauce would go well next time, but overall fabulous! Will definitely make more from time to time. Updated 11-13 - Have made these many more times, doubling the cranberry filling per other's suggestions and adding 1/4 tsp lemon extract to the cream cheese for an extra "zing".

These were good, but could have used a little more "zing".  I will make them again, but will probably add a little more lemon flavoring.

This is one of my fave Christmas recipes but I know them as Merry Berry Bars! The first time I made them myself I accidentally used too much lemon juice--1/2 cup instead of 1/4. It actually was a happy accident b/c it was very good that way and I've made it that way since! Gives it an extra bit of zing!

I agree that this needs something. The crust is bland - maybe more sugar in it? I added 1/3 more cream cheese only because I wanted to use up what I had - and it was excellent filling. Definately need more cranberry -- I even thought this recipe would be delicious using strawberry preserves instead.

Delicious!!!!  Perfect fall recipe for all of the cranberry sauce.  I  used reduced fat cream cheese and also mixed in some leftover homemade blueberry cranberry sauce with the canned sauce.  I actually really liked these warm, but they are also good today after chilling in the fridge overnight.  Will definitely be making again this holiday season - the colors are perfect.

these were pretty yummy.  i think you DEFINITELY need to double the cranberry sauce or it would be totally lost.  and while you're at it, doubling the cream cheese layer isn't a bad idea either... the crust is by far the thickest layer and most overwhelming flavor as the recipe is written.

I hate to be the voice of dissent, but I didn't really like these that well. I took them for Thanksgiving yesterday, and other people seemed to like them okay, but I thought they had too much crust. I think they would be better without as much topping. I added some broken pecans to the top, and that gave them a little oomph, but otherwise they were kind of boring. People also thought they were date bars, because that's what they looked like, so I'm afraid I have to give them a low score for appearance too (since my family hates date bars!). Maybe they would have been better warm...?

This is heavenly!  And not difficult to make.  I cut down the butter to probably 1 1/2 sticks.  Will cut the sugar down a bit next time also.  I had a little bit of a hard time getting the bottom crumbs to flatten and spread out- they kept sticking to my hands, or any utensils that I tried!  It doesn't matter much though- just do the best you can or try some flour on your hands ;)

I had a similiar recipe that I have lost. I didn't think it had condensed milk??
Very good & will make again with no changes ;-)
Well here I am again with some left over homemade cranberry sauce.......the only add-in was some coconut to base and some left over dried cranberries to sauce. Delish!!

I made this exactly like the recipe & it was fine, but I could barely taste the cream cheese filling,so mainly this recipe gave me a new idea for my own recipe.I think the filling/cranberry proportions should be reversed; ie, mostly cheesecake-like filling with just a garnish or hint of cranberry. But I do like cranberry-anything, so I'll make this again except double (or maybe even triple) the filling and make it more of a true cheesecake: use sour cream instead of sweetened condensed milk and maybe add an egg. (This made a pretty large amount, so I may keep the filling amount the same and cut the topping in half, & do it in an 8" square pan.) I always make my cranberry sauce with half the sugar and substitute orange juice for half the water, and this tasted really good.  I also used fat-free cream cheese and fat-free sweetened condensed milk, and these both worked well.

I didn't like this. It was messy to make. Messy to cut. Messy to eat. If it had tasted a bit better it would have been worth it but it did not, so it wasn't. I was going to try to make it again but, since I perfectly followed the instructions, I don't see how it would make a difference.

Good way to use up cranberries from thanksgiving. Didn't have quite enough cranberries so i supplemented them with some cherry jelly. Doubled cream cheese to be more proportionate with crust. Added 1 teaspoon of salt to crust.

This recipe was a hit at my grandma's tea party and Thanksgiving!  My only suggestion is to decrease the first baking time for the crust- it got a little too crispy.

This are quite sweet, so cut them in small squares!  I made the recipe as written and it worked out well.  I only had 12 oz of homemade cranberry sauce left but it was enough - I just adjusted the cornstarch down accordingly.  Good way to use up leftover cranberry sauce!

I have been making these for a few years now. Everyone loves them. Just like little cheesecake bites.
