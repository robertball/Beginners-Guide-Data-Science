In a nutshell, this is way too much lemon and Parmesan for the amount of asparagus called for.  With this amount of Parmesan you sure wouldn't need any salt!  I prepared this using all ingredients to taste - very good, but easier just to roast it at 425 degrees for about 12 minutes - no muss, no fuss and delicious.  I would suggest merely a drizzle of lemon juice and a sprinkle of Parmesan.  Less is more.

Easy Delicious Asparagus Haiku: "Ready in no time. Elegant and simple taste. (But I used less cheese.)" Ingredients, timing and directions are spot-on, and, well, it comes as no surprise that this was a great side dish. I used about 2 TB of parm, and after a couple bites, decided that I wanted a sprinkle of Texas Pete (but in all fairness, I put the TP on everything that graces my plate.) Really, you can't go wrong when dressing up your veggies w/ the classic combo of EVOO, lemon juice and s&p, so this recipe can't be any less than 5-stars.

I really loved making this dish. I did read the reviews before I mad it and took the advice of most of you (Thank you). I am from the Islands (Trinidad) and I thought that the flavor was on point. My husband on the other hand thought that the lemon juice was a bit much and didnt care much for it. So my advice will be not to use the 3T's that the recipe calls for, but rather use 1 1/2.

A bit too much lemon for my taste but overall tasted good. I cooked mine a few minutes longer and turned down the heat since I like my asparagus softer.

Out of the park on this recipe!!!!!!  So good and easy.  Not to mention soooooo delicious.  Did cut back the lemon to half and just eyeballed the Parmesan.  We can't wait to have this again.

Excellent, easy recipe!  I left out the parmesan because I didn't have any.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as written (though I didn't measure anything--just eyeballed it).  The asparagus was tender crisp, zesty and delicious!  My husband and I loved it.

This was so simple to make and was delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and did not find the lemon to be too much. The second time I made it, I sauteed a clove of chopped garlic in with the oil and asparagus. It was perfect!

Good, but not great.  I liked it better than my husband. He thought it needed more....something.

My first time cooking asparagus! I certainly undercooked it but that is my fault. The flavor was delicious though and it was a great accompaniment to the Pork Chops & Raspberry sauce recipe, also found on this site.

The lemon was a bit strong; I followed the suggestions of others & reduced the lemon juice. I also omitted the parmesan & added minced garlic. I baked it at 425 for 12 minutes as naples34102 recommended. My husband, who does not like asparagus, said this recipe is a keeper.
