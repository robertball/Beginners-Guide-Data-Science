Even though I added way too much pasta, I think the sauce would have been a bit too thin for me. That's why only 4 stars. I roasted the peppers rather than use the canned and it worked out great! I loved all the garlic flavor in this one.

I did not care for this at all! Besides the fact that the sauce itself is pretty thin, I just felt that it was also bland and very 'tin can' tasting. I made this as a side dish to go w/ 'Easy Weeknight Chicken Parmesan' from here, so I did omit the chicken, and used shelled shaped pasta, but I followed the recipe otherwise. In the end, I did try to salvage it by doctoring it up a bit, but that just didn't do the trick for me. Sorry...

Out the gate, I must admit that I doctored the sauce more to our liking. I doubled the garlic cloves, roasted bell peppers and the basil. I also used 1/4 cp red wine, not vinegar. While using the Progresso Recipe Starter sauce made this a quick meal, it was not what I would use regularly. I think it's best used for an emergency meal or for a family with children. We topped the chicken and penne with peccorino romano cheese and red chile flakes which made it more palable. Thanks Progresso, for the opportunity to try your new peoduct.
