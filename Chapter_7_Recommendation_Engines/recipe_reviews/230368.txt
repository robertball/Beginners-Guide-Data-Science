The seasoning on this Prime Rib is excellent as written.  I don't know if the one other reviewer HMW10284, actually made this roast.  The only thing I did differently is insert the meat thermometer prior to placing the roast in the 450 degree oven.  I cooked the meat to 135 - pulled it and let it rest.  It was perfect for us.  Just done enough for hubby and rare enough for me.  If you cook to 145 and let rest your meat will be closer to well done rather than medium.  There are other cooking methods I prefer but the seasoning on this rib roast deserves 5 stars.

The most important part is to get good meat.  Nothing belongs on Prime Rib other that a wee bit of salt and maybe a mite of pepper.  Everything else obscures the taste of the meat.

Hello - thanks for looking at my recipe.  Not sure why the temp got changed when they edited this but you should cook to 140 for medium.  We pull it out at 135.  The reviewers that talk about the rub being great and then using their own cooking instructions are probably right on but if you're new to prime rib, give this a try.  The husband of a friend of mine likes this rub so much that he uses it in his restaurant and says its the most popular item on his menu.  So please, cook it how you want (the turn the oven off method works very well but I think a low temp is good too) but the spice rub is probably the best feature of this recipe.

This is, I believe, the first time I've ever tried to make a standing rib roast.  I used a 3.5 lbs bone in roast, as there were only 4 f us for dinner.  I used a roasted garlic and EVOO paste instead of separate ingredients.  20 min at 450F and 90 min at 325F yielded a more medium than med-rare roast :( .  I also added chunked carrots and potatoes around the roast at about 15 min into the 325F time.  That was a mistake.  I should have tossed the veggies in oil, instead of just salt and pepper.  The meat was delicious, but I could have used better info on the timing.

We think McCormic's blend of seasoning has a lot of garlic, so I didn't add extra. I patted my roast dry, then rubbed the 4 lb roast with 2 teaspoons of EVOO, mixed the Montreal seasoning, mustard powder and Italian seasonings, then heavily dusted the roast. I let the seasoned meat rest uncovered in the refrigerator for 3 hrs (next time I'll do 8 or even overnight), then followed the cooking instructions.  A thermometer is a must!  I inserted it prior to cooking and when the temperature reached 135, I pulled the roast and let it rest for about 25 minutes covered.  What a nice crust this cooking method and spice blend results in!!  We definitely will have again.

I used this recipe mainly for the marinade rub, for the Italian spice I used Mediterranean spice from myspicesage.com, perfect for this recipe. After I applied the rub, I wrapped the roast in plastic wrap and let it come to room temperature while marinating (took about an hour and half). We could taste the mild flavoring of the rub in each bite. I did follow the cooking instructions, but took my roast out when it reached 130° on my digital probe thermometer. The temperature rose to 142° while wrapped in the foil for 15 minutes, so if you really like it rare, you might keep that in mind. That said, this was my very first Prime rib roast and my husband said it was excellent, better than he gets in a restaurant. Tender, juicy and really was very easy.

Followed the cooking instructions. Seasoned the meat the way we like it (a little less ing. than recipe) Roast was 5.75 lbs that was cooked.  Tasted just like we get at a fine restaurant. Husband couldn't stop raving about dinner!

We really enjoyed the seasoning and this cooking method worked well too.  Pulled at 135 as recommended, it was perfect. Served with a twice baked potato and steamed broccoli. A lovely New Year's Eve dinner !

Best recipe ever! I had a 7.5 lb 4 rib roast and it was perfectly cooked to medium. Just the right amount of seasonings. I have an older gas oven so I was nervous but I followed the recipe and after the first 20 minutes turned the oven down and continued cooking for 2 1/2 hours. My husband was delighted. I’ll definitely do this again.

Love this recipe! The rub coating adds a distinctive almost Mediterranean aspect that is simply delicious! Cooked it to 145 internal temp and it was perfect!!  Highly recommend this recipe for certain!

Easy, and came out perfect. We like it medium rare, and it was perfect all the way through - not too rare, not too medium. I did roast it at 325 for an hour and 25 minutes (a little shorter than the recipe), and the thermometer read 'rare" but after letting it sit for ten minutes, it  was just right.

Very easy to make.  I didn’t have Montreal or Italian seasoning but I used similar seasonings.  In addition, I inserted garlic cloves around the roast.  I cooked it for a total of 1 3/4 hours and it came out perfect!  It is definitely a keeper.

Oh my, this is the BEST beef roast I have ever made. Juicy and a perfect medium rare that my husband even enjoyed (he prefers his beef on the more medium/well-done side of the cooking spectrum - killing the beef a second time, I know). Will definitely use this cooking method for future roasts. Thanks for the recipe :)

I made absolutely NO CHANGES to this recipe except to cook 15 minutes longer.  If you like it RARE, use the current times; we prefer medium, thus, I added 15 minutes to cook to our preference.  The spices compliment the roast perfectly! There was NO CONVERSATION at the table except many "Mmmmm"'s!!

This was amazing. We used Tuscan olive oil from Redstone Olive Oil and it added just the right touch for our family. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

This was the first prime rib I've cooked at home and this recipe turned out great! I cooked it exactly as written and everyone loved it. The rub adds just the right flavor to complement and not overpower the meat. I will definitely be making this again around the holidays. Thanks for a great recipe.
