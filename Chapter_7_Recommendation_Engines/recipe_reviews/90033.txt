DELICIOUS! I used a full 16oz. bag of coleslaw mix, and still had plenty of sauce. I also add a couple tablespoons of red wine vinegar, just because I like it. This recipe is going into the save file for sure!

Without the grapes, this is absolutely delicious - the pecans and feta are a wonderful combination. I didn't like the addition of the grapes at all, however.

Coleslaw mix came in a 10 ounce package. Used 2 cups of grapes. Used 4 ounce package of feta cheese. Used half a cup of toasted pecans.â€¦ And added a tablespoon of honey with the sugar (I am a beekeeper.) Absolutely delicious! Everyone loved it. Definitely going to make this again.

This seems like it might be an odd combination of flavors, but the end result was very good and a nice change from your typical coleslaw!  Like some other reviewers, I used a 16 oz bag of slaw mix, but kept everything else the same.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, bdh76!

Wonderful slaw!  I used a 16 oz. package slaw mix but kept all ingredients the same.  Didn't have grapes so threw in some dried cranberries.  I love feta cheese but not on hand so threw in some grated parmesan cheese into the dressing.  Can't wait to try this with feta!  The only Ranch dressing I had was Peppercorn Ranch and it worked very well.  Toasting the pecans is such a good idea as it gives you a crispy bite to the salad.  Your recipe is one I will keep in my "Company is Coming" folder.  Thanks, bdh76, for posting!

I will definitely make this again. My stepson and his family loved this and they are a very traditional, nothing unusual family.  The introduction of the feta and the pecans add a nice blend that are just a tad outside of their comfort zone, taking this recipe from being  just okay to becoming a repeater.
