I made this for my husband's surprise birthday party.  People that don't who were there  (including my mother and mother-in-law)had it finished before I could even try it!  I got lots of pats on my back for this one.

Made this recipe for a Christmas party on Saturday.  Today, I had two people ask me for the recipe-they loved it.  The beauty of this one is you can make it as strong or as week as you want.  It taste very good!!

My roommates ask me to make this punch for every party we have, for the people that dont like beer.  This punch is awesome, simple to make, and gets rave reviews everytime I make it.  A few of the party attendee's  even used it in a punch version of beer pong!  Talk about a hit!

I've noticed a lot of these reviews refer to the "old days" and college...makes sense because that's just where this drink belongs...in a frat basement served out of a garbage can alongside America's Best beer.  This is super sweet.  I scaled the servings back to one and I'm glad I did as I can't imagine drinking more than one. If you enjoy sweet drinks, it's worth giving a shot.
