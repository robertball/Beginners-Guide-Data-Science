This was delicious!  Made it for the first time for company and it got rave reviews!  Used nectarines 'cause the store was out of peaches (go figure!) - they did not brown (which I was concerned about cutting them up in the morning and serving for dinner.
Only thing I changed was that I used vegetable oil - didn't have canola, and used a little more pasta then what is called for...I blame my addiction to carbs! ha!
Delicious and different!

This is amazing!  Really worth getting out the blender and making the dressing.  I didn't have the bacon, but used cooked chicken in its place.  Wow!!!  They should bottle this dressing--I'd eat it everyday!  :)

My husband doesn't usually like fruit a non-fruit salad, but he ended up taking a third helping of this salad. The dressing was super amazing. The curry powder adds a nice accent to the basil. I used fresh basil, and only added peas for the veggie. My kids mostly yucked it, but i think that's just them. I plan on making it again and maybe their taste buds will be grown up by then.

I turned this recipe into a potato salad by using steam-cooked, orange-fleshed sweet potatoes in place of the pasta. I also added a cup of peas. The dressing is fragrant & delicious. It makes for an extremely pretty, colourful, veggie-packed and absolutely delicious salad. Thanks for sharing this keeper of a recipe.
