Simple and easy recipe, but it would be a lot better with a few spices.  I added chili powder and ground cumin after my first bowl.

I had never heard of locro before tonight when I was looking for a new way to use up some butternut squash from last fall.  I must say, we LOVED it.  I accidentally forgot to add the milk, so it was thicker than the recipe intended, but still delicious.  My method was a little different than the recipe.  I cut the butternut squash in half  lengthwise, and scooped out the seeds, then placed it, cut side down on a jelly roll pan, with 1/4 inch or so of water, and baked at 375 until soft.  I let it cool a little, then scooped it out and proceeded as instructed.  My peas and cheese were frozen, so the whole mixture was cold, and rather than standing and stirring it on the stove, I put it in a covered casserole dish and put it in the hot oven for 20 minutes or so until everything was hot and the cheese melted.  My girls, ages 3, almost 5, and 7 couldn't get done raving about it.

I really recommend to use banana squash since butternut squash is too sweet for this recipe.  I am Peruvian and love this dish just not with sweet squash

My husband and I thought the recipe as it's written is pretty bland. We might try it again with additional spices like cumin and chili powder. It also made a TON. We had leftovers for daysssss.

This was so delicious!  When I tasted from the pot it was perfect; when tasted over rice it became bland. I just put steak seasoning into the rice this time and it was better... I checked out Peruvian spices and will add them to the rice next time. The Peruvian Locro was definitely  5 stars!!!

Easy to make, yummy to eat.  We liked it best with salt & pepper, so maybe next time, we'll put more salt in at the salt-to-taste part.

This was really easy to make and very filling. My whole family liked it including teens and 9yo. We didnt have any leftovers! They never even knew there was squash in it (which they hate) I will be making this again. Could also be served over quinoa for a healthier version.
