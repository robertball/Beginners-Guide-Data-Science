Great taste!  I cut the amount of tamari sauce in half. The allspice, nutmeg and cloves provide an unexpected pleasure. I used steel cut oats, and Thanks for the recipe!those could be changed for rolled oats. This was too much filling for one 9" pie, so next time, I will make this a one crust pie in a casserole dish The kinds of vegetables can be varied, so I will be making this at other times with different ones. Thanks for the recipe!

I saut√© the onions beforehand so that my kids will love it. It's an awesome pie recipe.  I tweek  things here and there but not much. I've substituted lovage fore celery in a pinch, reducing the amount of lovage gauged by taste. The second time around, yet again no celery on hand and so have substituted a small amount of celery seed just for flavour. I expect it'll be well received again.

I used soy sauce instead of tamari (and the old fashioned soy sauce will make it darker, as opposed to the Japanese sushi style one). I only had canola oil also. Turned out better than expected. I omitted the egg, and it held together quite well!

Great recipe. Only suggestion is use more water (twice as much) when cooking the oats and barley. The recipe also makes more than necessary for a 9 inch round baking pan, so I cooked mine in a rectangular deep dish.  You may almost have enough for two pie dishes.

The combination of the sauce and the spices was really great. It had a depth of tastes that was really pleasing. My anti-vegetarian kid even raved about it.
