HERE'S WHAT I DO FOR MY RESTAURANT STYLE EGG DROP SOUP.  Bring broth to a boil with 1T sherry, 1T soy sauce, 2 scallions cut in 1 inch pieces, 1-1 inch piece of fresh ginger, 1 clove garlic crushed. Let steep a few minutes to flavor broth.  Remove garlic, ginger and scallions.  Thicken with cornstarch (add more cornstarch if you like it nice and thick as we do).  Stir broth while simmering in clockwise directions. Add beaten eggs (I use 6 eggs for 4 or 5 cups broth)  in slow steady stream and let cook undisturbed (important) until cooked (about a minute or so).  If you add eggs before it's thickened the eggs will puff when cooked and will not cook to ribbons (like restaurant style).  Garnish with finely sliced scallions if desired and crispy noodles.  Yummy! Will fulfill that takeout craving.

This is yummy, and very close to what you can get from the restaurant.  The only thing I change is to add the cornstarch before the eggs, so that the eggs cook in flat strings instead of puffy clumps.  Thank you for the recipe!

Excellent soup!! Tips: Eggs should be added LAST, after thickening soup. And, remove saucepan from heat before adding eggs. Add eggs slowly, stirring soup in clockwise direction with wooden spoon. A pinch of white pepper adds depth of flavor. This is truly like restaurant egg drop soup!

Very good recipe.  I added about 1/3 c. each of chopped celery, shredded carrots and cabbage.  I used 5 green onions rather than chives and added 1/2 tsp. black pepper.  I will make this again...thank you W.J. Cory!

I added a tiny amount of soy sauce but realized that it made it too salty so I added more broth, onions, ginger, and eggs to make a larger batch. The soy sauce changed the color slightly but gave it a good taste. This had to be the best egg drop soup recipe that I have ever had and I have tried many. Terrific!
Oh an I used bouillon cubes with water instead of canned broth. Don't know if this made a difference or not.

This is as good as the restaurant's soup.  Everyone in the family enjoyed this, which is very unusual.  My pickiest eater even ate this soup, after fishing out the chives.  She thought the egg was noodles, and to get through dinner without a complaint, we didn't tell her differently.  Thank you for an easy yet wonderful recipe.  (Not to mention a dinner without complaints!)   :)

I followed the recipe exactly and I don't know what went wrong. This soup ended up being terrible and the ginger completely overpowered everything. It also tastes nothing like our local chinese restaurant. I will continue my search for an enjoyable Egg Drop Soup and never make this recipe again.

This recipe was awesome! Thanks so much! A KEEPER! My husband LOVES egg drop soup and this is superior to the others I tried. Big tip: I used the low sodium chicken broth   to keep the salty taste other egg drop soups get down. I make often since it so easy-and a family favorite.  If I don't have chicken broth on hand, I use 1 cup of water to 1 crushed chicken cube per serving as desired.  Thanks so much!

Wow was I ever pleasantly surprised by this recipe. I have been searching for years for a good egg drop soup recipe and this is it. I would highly recommend drizzling some sesame seed oil into it and adding some mushrooms, mixed frozen veggies and diced water chestnuts and a pinch of white pepper....yum!

After reading many of the reviews I thickened the broth first and then streamed in the egg mixture.  Excellent flavor.  I didn't add any salt to the soup as I like a bit of soy sauce in mine at the table.  Next time I think I'll put the egg mixture in a small baggie and cut a very tiny tip off the bottom to make it easier to drizzle the egg into the swirling broth.

This soup is awesome! Better than the resturant! I did do as others did and added the cornstarch before the eggs. I also added a small sprinkle or garlic powder and a dash of soy sauce. I will make this many more times!

I had to try the egg drop soup simply to see what would happen if I stirred it in a COUNTER-clockwise direction rather than a clockwise direction like some of the previous reviews advised. I'm still confused by that :), does it matter what continent you're on??  In any case, the result was still a decent soup!  I didn't have any chicken broth so I made it with water and added a chicken bullion cube a the end.  As for whether the eggs are stringy or not I was under the impression it depends on how fresh the eggs are rather than whether you add them before or after the corn starch but I could be wrong...

I use the small seasoning packets from pork Ramen soup (then doctor & season to taste) I add a little chicken boulion, ground Ginger powder, garlic salt, a few drops of sesame seed chili oil & soy sauce, then add thinly sliced water chestnuts green onion & canned Mushrooms Bring broth to a boil. Let steep a few minutes to flavor broth. Remove chestnuts, mushrooms, & grn onion. Thicken with cornstarch (add more cornstarch if you like it thicker). Stir broth while simmering in clockwise direction. Add beaten eggs (use 1 egg for every cup of broth) in slow steady pour into slow steady boil and let cook undisturbed (important) until cooked (about a minute or so). If you add eggs before it's thickened the eggs will puff when cooked and will not cook to ribbons (like restaurant style). Garnish with finely sliced scallions if desired and crispy noodles. Yummy! Note: if you drop eggs in before cornstarch & thickening broth the eggs will puff up

I made this for a Chinese theme potluck.  I was going to make for 12, hubby said....double that.  I was very, very doubtful we needed that much. I was WRONG!!! We ran out! Even the people who said they don't normally eat egg drop soup ate it and they raved!  "Souper" EASY!!! and "SOUPER" DELISH!!!!

My hubby made this for us, adding sesame oil, corn and 5-spice. He wasn't thrilled with it but I love it and will be saving this to force him to make it again. It's very light, but definitely comfort food.

CONGRATULATIONS!! 
I have "wasted" good broth on trying to make this soup for about 13yrs. here & there. I have tried the soup pkts, all kinds of recipies-ALL TO NO AVAIL!! This IS THE FIRST thing that I have EVER tried that has even come close to something I would get from a restaurant! 
T H A N K  Y O U!!
Seriously, not trying to be a dork or anything, but, I was just so happy w/the turn out. I thickened the broth FIRST-really helped out I think. The ginger was a new thing-easy does it in my opinion, & made a BIG difference w/a "hint" of it in there. A FEW drops of soy sauce, &, I'm from VA-don't know about ya'll, but the clear color kinda weirded me out some. HERE atleast(VA), it's served kinda yellowish, so, a few drops of yellow coloring, & I was grinnin' from ear to ear :o)
NOT quite "restaurant" quality, but, I KNOW that I won't EVER AGAIN worry about wasting my broth!! I will DEFINATELY use the recipe again, & will have some fun "tweaking" around with it!
5*'s  :o)

I was in the mood for some Egg Drop Soup when I woke up this morning. I don't know why I never looked this up before as it's one of my favorite soups. I added white pepper, peas & corn to this recipe. (I think the idea of adding a thickener - corn starch turned me off for a while, but I'm over it now!) Soup & Rice for breakfast! Mmm.

Thanks for posting. I substituted cornstarch for the tapioca flour. I also used fresh ginger instead of ground, because that is what I had. Next I put in soy sauce and beef bouillon. The flavor was yum! My eggs got "puffy" so I will try the suggestion of others and thicken the soup with the cornstarch before adding the eggs for my next batch. Also I will let the eggs cook undisturbed to get the ribbons. Will make again for sure and throw in some tofu. I'm hungry just thinking about it. lol

This was very easy to make and really good. My wife and I love it and have made it a few times when were in the mood for soup. I recommended adding crushed red peppers if you like a little spice. Yum!

As written I was not thrilled. Once I read some of the reviews and added in a few things (sesame oil, garlic, raw ginger, pepper) this soup did, then, taste a great deal like a restaurant style one. I think maybe the chicken stock used by restaurants has had onions cooked into it as I didn't have quite as much onion flavor here as I was hoping for, but that's something I can modify for next time. A couple tips: DO add eggs in last, so you don't have to stir them to jibbles. Also, I saw no good reason for separating the eggs and using just the yolk on one...so I just used whole eggs. It worked beautifully--mine looks perfectly authentic. For people who have puffy eggs...make sure you're putting the eggs in BOILING water. So we enjoyed this soup but as written, I can't give it the 5th star. But it's easily adjusted for taste, and is well worth 4 stars.

I LOVE this recipe! When I make it, I either add garlic powder or minced garlic to the chicken broth with the chives, ginger, and salt. I also add fresh cilantro at the end. It sounds bizarre, but these two make this soup SOO much better.

Fairly good.  I wouldn't say it was as good as restaurant egg drop soup I've had, but it was a a great quick lunch.  Just a few things, I didn't have chicken broth, so I used bouillon cubes.  DON'T add salt if you use the cubes.  Also, I had a plethora of green onions and they worked great for substituting for chives.  I suggest adding white pepper if you have any.  It tastes great in the soup.

Tastes JUST like restaurant soup! I followed advice of other reviews and added eggs last - perfect! It did smell a little gingery while cooking but is PERFECT in every way. So easy, I will definitely be making this with all of my chinese dinners from now on!!

This was great! We loved it and it didn't last long at all! The flavor is rich yet subtle and very savory. Be sure to use a good quality chicken stock and eggs since the soup will only be as good as your stock and eggs. If the flavor is too rich for you substitute some of the stock for water. I used soy sauce instead of salt in this recipe since it gives it a more "authentic" flavor. Be sure the drizzle the eggs in by the fork as the recipe directs since that is what will give you the perfect size egg drops. If the top becomes filled with the egg before you're done just push it to the side and continue dropping. I don't think it's necessary to use only an egg yolk, you can use another whole egg instead.

In Hawaii, its called Egg Flower Soup and has peas in it. Some places serve it with carrots and peas, (probably frozen because the way they're cut doesn't look or taste like they're fresh), but its still good.  I like this recipe because I got a base as to how its actually made.  Thanks a bunch.  With mine, I used dehydrated shiitake mushrooms, re-hydrated them in water for 20 minutes, place a plate on them for a weight, otherwise they won't stay submerged. When they were pliable and soft, I drained the water, BUT reserved about 1 cp of the juice and added that to the broth mixture. Chopped the shrooms and added along with garlic powder, ginger powder & soy sauce to broth. (Make sure to taste for adjustments) I normally would use fresh,but didn't have any left in pantry. Brought soup to boil, then thickened with 2 Tbls cornstarch mixed with 1-1/2 Tbls Mirin. (use water if no Mirin on hand or reserve a cp of broth (before it boils) and mix with it)  When it came to a boil, I added in thickner, stirring frequently, brought to boil again, then removed from heat at which time I added the eggs, VERY VERY SLOWLY, stirring in clockwise direction. (personally i don't think it makes a difference which direction, just stay focused on one, do not stir in all different directions. I added chopped green onion for garnish.  It wasn't as thick as I'm used to, but it was great just the same. Next time I'll probably add more cornstarch to thicken it up.  Whats great about this soup, is you ca

I just made this last night. And with MSFURIOUS1's comments, this gets 5 stars. I followed all of this reviewers suggestions and it turned out perfect. The only thing I'll change is I had 46 ounces of broth and 6 eggs. There was way too much egg for the small amount of broth. Next time I'll add 60 ounces of broth and 4 eggs. Also I'll use a very small lipped measuring glass when pouring the eggs in. Thsi will slow down what enters into the broth allowing more "thin ribbons". What I used allowed too much to come out too fast. And it's important the broth be really hot when adding the egg. 
I served this with P.F. Changs chicken lettuce wraps that my husband loves yet he and my daughter went back for seconds on the soup and left the wraps. So thanks all for this wonderful recipe. I'll definitely be adding this to our rotation.

Nothing beats homemade stock, but the one that comes pretty close is Kitchen Basics Chicken Stock, and that's all that I use.  I did increase the ginger amount (taste preference) and as suggested by other reviewers, added the cornstarch slurry before drizzling the egg into the soup.  It seemed like an excessive amount of egg and I didn't use it all, so the next time I make this, I'll use one whole egg and one egg yolk.  I think this measured up very well to what I've been served in Chinese restaurants, and in some cases, it was better.  This one's going into my Favorites folder.

Very good. I added green onions and a little bit of garlic powder so it was not too bland. I took the other reviewers suggestions on adding the cornstarch and thickening before adding the eggs. This was also good reheated.

This was an easy and delicious recipe. The whole family loved it. I made it with 2 large cans of soup stock, but doubled the ginger, salt, and eggs/yolks, I only put 3 Tbs. of chives in it, since the first time I made it I doubled the chives and it was too much for the kids. I needed to triple the cornstach to get it the right consistancy. My husband has had me make it twice this week, the first time I made it as part of the dinner the second time it was dinner. Thanks for the great recipe.

Excellent egg drop soup recipe! I left out the chives because my kids won't eat anything with green things in them, but did everything else exactly as the recipe says.  Wonderful flavor and so simple. Definitely a new family favorite!

None of us thought this tasted like the egg drop soup we get at Chinese restaurants, but we all really enjoyed it.  The flavor was great and the thickness of the soup was just right.  The only negative thing about it is there's really too much egg.  I doubled the recipe, so next time I think I'll just leave out one of the whole eggs and see how much difference that makes.  I followed the recommendations of several other reviewers and thickened the soup before adding the eggs, which made the eggs cook into the nice ribbons like you see in restaurant soup.  We'll definitely have this again!

I used this as a base recipe for a last minute soup to eat with my homemade wontons. I used 6 cups of broth and 4 whole eggs and about 1/4 teaspoon of grated ginger...added a splash of soy sauce and salt and pepper...thickened with a bit more than the recipe called for as far as the starch goes...sprinkled some scallions (green part) on top...and the soup was DELICIOUS!  I will DEFINITELY be making it again!  SUPER easy!

This soup is truly awesome.  My family likes it more than the soup they buy at local Asian Restaurants.  I add a few frozen peas and carrots and thicken with just a tad more cornstarch.  At the table we add a generous amount of black pepper and the eating is on.  Thanks for a wonderfully easy version of Egg Drop Soup.  Needless to say, we no longer buy it out.  It's cheaper than the restaurant and tastier.

Loved this!  I am trying a gluten-free diet for a month and this recipe may be what saves me.  I did mix the egg in last, after the corn starch.  I ended up only using a little over half of the egg.   I  used a low-sodium (Kroger brand) chicken broth that tasted a little too bland, so I added in a bit of chicken bullion.

This was just as good as it is at my favorite chinese place.  However, I was missing the little crunchy noodles.  (They may be little fried pieces of death, but they sure add a lot to Egg Drop Soup.)  I solved this problem by sprinkling a few Rice Chex on top.  Gluten Free AND yummy!

Very good with the following changes:  You will want to double the recipe.  I used 3 whole eggs total, green onions instead of chives, and added chopped cabbage and a few carrots.  Egg drop soup is not egg drop soup unless it has cabbage in it!!!  Based on other reviews I added the cornstarch before the eggs and I only used 2 TBSP instead of 3.  Consistency was perfect!!

Tastes like restaurant egg drop soup, just looks a little bit creepier. I was scared to try this, but it seemed to work out fine. I cut down the salt a little and used freeze dried chives instead of fresh. Good recipe for those who already enjoy egg drop soup (newbies might be nervous to try this).

WAY better than any egg drop soup I've had at any restaurant! That says a lot coming from a city like San Francisco. :) Definitely thicken the soup before adding the egg in a thin stream while slowly whisking in one direction.  But other than that, wouldn't change a THING about the ingredients. We LOVED it!! I topped mine at the table w/ ground white pepper & The Hubster topped his with ground black pepper. Each of us was in heaven! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! Will be making this often & never ordering it from the restaurant again since it's SO easy! :)

Quite bland and overly eggy in our opinion. There was also not enough cornstarch to thicken it to the consistency we find at Chinese restaurants. The one thing I did appreciate were the directions for adding the egg, though adding with a fork takes forever. We did ours in thin streams and then broke up the ribbons of egg with the whisk before serving.

I thought this was really good. Next time I will add some carrot shreds and maybe some other vegetables with less egg. I prefer my egg drop soup to have more broth. Other than that, the recipe was delicious!

I altered the directions for ease. I thickened the soup with corn starch before drizzling the egg. My husband added a little soy sauce to his bowl and said it was perfect. The rest of us ate it and loved it as it. Perfect soup for the sick ones last night.

I have been too many Chinese Restaurant in search of really good egg drop soup.  I must say this is the best and the beauty of it is that it was made in my own kitchen.  The chives are extra special.

This is the most authentic egg drop soup I've ever cooked. I used minced fresh ginger and chopped green onions instead of chives and it was delish. Thanks! I'm sure I'll be committing this one to memory.

I combined this recipe with "Egg Drop Soup I" and it came out absolutely delicious...I had to try not to eat the whole batch! Here's what I did:

Instead of four cups of broth I used two cups of broth and two cups of water. I used 1 chicken bouillon cube and 1/2 tsp of onion powder.

This was SO GOOD! I'm only a teenager, but it was really easy for me to make. I have a cold right now, and was craving some soup, but my mom left for work, and we're going shopping tomorrow so we're short on groceries. Therefore, I had to make a few changes. 1) I have no idea what chives are, so obviously didn't use them. 2) I used 2 chicken boullion cubes instead of broth. 3) The ONE time I need ginger (which I don't even like, but my mom says its good for sore throats) we don't have it. 4) I did what some others said and put the cornstarch in first. 5) I cut up a clove of garlic and put it in the soup. I made so many changes to it, I'm not even sure if its the same recipe, but all in all, its still GREAT soup. A little too salty (and I love salt), but a little water fixed that. If I didn't have a sore throat, it would be MUCH better I'm sure. *tear*

I don't know if we did something wrong - the only thing different I did was use green onions instead of leeks, but my husband and I after one bite had to toss the whole thing - we were really bummed.

My mom used to make this when I was sick. I added quite a bit more ginger (threw in chunks of ginger root, but don't forget to pull them out when you're done!), added sugar (my mom always did), and more cornstarch to make it thicker. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent! I didn't have any chicken broth so I made my own (4 bouillon cubes plus four cups of water) and I didn't have any fresh green onions so I used freeze dried chives I had in the refrigerator.  I also doubled the ginger amount but it is certainly not necessary.  A little trick to make the "egg drizzle process" easier is whip the eggs well and the slowly pour the egg in while briskly whisking the mixture.  It makes the process much faster.  Also, I add the cornstarch mixture before the egg.  This is wonderful recipe for egg drop soup.  It simply doesn't get any better!

Indeed, this recipe does rank right up there with the egg drop soup that is purchased in Chinese restaurants.  My son helped me prepare it and we put it together in no time at all--a very easy process!  It's cold and snowy today and this was the perfect lunch to warm us up.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!  It's short, simple and delicious.  As one other reviewer mentioned, it was just a tad too salty, probably because of the salt in the chicken both.  I will probably reduce the table salt by 1/2 next time.  One final note:  We doubled the recipe and still didn't have much soup, so if you eat a lot or have a big family--keep that in mind.

This was delicious. We had with egg rolls and stir fry. My 2 year old son kept asking for more "chicken noodle soup." I will definitely make this again.

Absolutely delicious!  Unfortunately I didn't have chives, but it still tasted great.  Oh, and I did add about 2 shakes of soy sauce.  Even my kids (5 and 3) loved it!

I have been making this soup for years now and would love to give some suggestions. It helps to use only egg whites instead of whole eggs and to stir in a little water to the whites to thin them out. Also pour in the whites through a slotted ladle,  or better still, a ladle with holes, held about 8-10 inches above the pot and stir while doing this ( another pair of hands needed !! ). A dash of ground peppercorns added before thickening enhances the flavour wonderfully !

This is a great recipe!  After making it as written, I couldn't wait to try it again with a few additions/changes.  I doubled the recipe; used the sliced tops of green onions instead of chives; added slices of fresh ginger (instead of ground) and some white pepper.  Added a can of corn (to the doubled recipe)and some shredded cabbage (from a bag for cole slaw that also included some shredded carrots). I did use a bit more cornstarch, and it was just the right consistency (sometimes in a restaurant it is almost gelled-yuck). I added some small cubes of tofu.  Two large eggs was enough for me, but that is a matter of taste. After thickening the soup, I followed suggestions from reviewers - I put the beaten egg in a baggie and cut off a very small tip and drizzled it from the bag into the soup while I stirred gently clockwise - it worked perfectly!  I added a bit of soy sauce at the table.  I loved it! It's simple, healthy and really good!  I'll be making this again and again. Thanks for a great recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly and to my surprise it tastes and looks( which to me is quite important) almost exactly like our local Chinese resturant!!!! The Husband said he couldn't taste a difference. Will definitely be making this a staple for a quick comfort soup??

I made this by request as I am not an egg eater... positive feedback, but it was suggested that I add some sherry next time.  Also, after reading some of the reviews, I think I should have added the cornstarch before dropping in the eggs. I used Rapunzel vegetable bouillon instead of chicken broth, no extra salt needed.

I made this last night with stir fry and eggrolls. It was perfect, just like I've had in my favorite Chinese restaurant.  I had all the ingredient on hand. I did substitute the chives for green onion and I added chopped onion. I thickened it before adding the egg as per the reviews. It couldn't have turned out better. I'll be making this again.

Good directions and base but needs lots of seasoning. Used low sodium chicken broth, dropped a coin of fresh ginger in broth along with two garlic cloves, but that wasn't enough.  Had to add almost a whole tsp of ground ginger, some garlic powder and onion powder, along wit soy sauce.  I did take the recommendation to add conrstarch prior to eggs and that seemed to work good.  Will make again, but know I have to put lots of extra seasoning.

This is really delicious and super easy to make. We used green onions rather than chives though. And it's still delicious even if you leave out the green onions. Just a tip for those who use green onions, you can regrow them!! Just stick the bottom of the green onions in a glass of water and you have an unlimited supply!

Made this for the first time tonight. Hubby and I both love our restaurant's soup. Thank you for sharing this.  First I will say I did not have prepared chicken broth. I had to use a soup base and water it worked just fine. I also subsituted finley sliced green onion for the chives.I did follow the suggestion of adding the cornstarch before the egg and it to worked wonderfully.  My only change would be more ginger, or use fresh ginger, but that is my personal taste. It was perfect and we will be enjoying this again. Thank you!

THis was great soup!  Ours didn't exactly taste like egg drop, more like chicken noodle soup with egg in it.  But it was a very comforting soup.  Ours didn't ever thicken up, it was always a bit runny.  But the taste was good.

This tasted excellent. Even my 8 month old loved slurping up the soup :) I did make a few changes. I used 3 whole eggs. I stirred in the cornstarch before adding the eggs so they'd string out like the restaurant soup. I also added a tablespoon of soy sauce. I cooked up some thin matchsticks of chicken in sesame oil and added that to the broth as well to give it that sesame flavor like restaurants have, but not so overwhelming like sesame oil can be. I'll definitely make this many more times in bigger batches since this batch went quick :) I didn't add any salt either, since most chicken broths have plenty of sodium (plus the soy)

Awesome and easy soup to make, I agree to thicken before adding eggs.  I also used about half the amount of ginger and chives.  We also decided to just add the eggs until it looked like the amount we wanted- the first time we made it there were way too many eggs for our liking.

This recipe was so simple that I thought there was no way it would be like the real thing. I was so wrong! This soup tasted just like what we get at our favorite chinese place an hour from our house. Both my kids (4 and 2) ate this up and couldn't believe I made it at home! Thanks!

Super easy and tasty.  My 12 year old made this for lunch. We used cilantro instead of onion because we like it.  Thickened prior to adding eggs as per advice of others.  As we used bouillon we didn't add salt.

This soup was pretty good! It seemed to have too much egg for me, so next time I will cut it in half! I took advise from previous ratings and added egg AFTER thickening.  I also used half chicken broth and half vegan veggie broth. Both of our kids and my hubby LOVED it!

A good, comforting and tasty soup. I used fresh chopped chives, fresh grated ginger, not ground powdered ginger. I added a little Hawaiian sea salt and fresh black pepper. I thickened up the soup first before adding in the egg mixture. When the soup was boiling I then added the eggs. Direction were approximate, eggs cooked immediately upon drizzling into the broth. I added some frozen peas and carrots as well. At times I will add tofu or whatever I have on hand at the time. While this soup is served as a side dish to main course meal, I would sometimes drink this soup when I felt a cold coming on. Tonight, I served this with, "Asian Beef with Snow Peas," and" Chinese Sausage with Fried Rice," also from this website.

This is so easy and yummy!  The whole family loves it.  I first made this because I felt a cold coming on.  I always crave egg drop soup when I'm sick, and this feels so good on my sore throat.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was great!  We couldn't find chives quickly, so we omitted those.  After reading reviews, we added some cabbage because we happened to have it around, as well as some parsley flakes.  Delicious, easy soup that we'll definitely make again!

Very good soup- although I didn't notice the chives and ginger distinctly. This soup's even better when I added the crispy fried wonton noodles that can be made very easily by cutting strips with a pizza cutter and frying in a couple of inches of vegetable oil for a few seconds- be careful they cook very quickly. And to think the Chinese restaurant I enjoy charges $1.00 for a tiny amount of extra crispy noodles.

This was good and I thought it came really close to restaurant syle soup, but it seems to be missing something.  I couldnt put my thumb on it... but it needs something.  I will make this again but prolly add something to get it just right.  Maybe some ground red pepper? Anyways, it was good soup if you dont compare it to restaurants.

omgawd! that was AWESOME!  so easy and delish! i made it w/ veg. bullion cubes, and dried onion bits...i was out of everything...lol. i added leftover rice which had a bit of chinese 5 spice in it from last nights dinner. YUM! however, i think my stock was boiling TOO MUCH, so next time i'll turn down so it's not a 'rolling boil' and the eggs will be a little bit larger. PERFECT!! thank you!

Yum! I'm eating this now, and it is so easy and delicious. I didn't have any chives, so I used onion powder and some minced garlic. Also added a little soy sauce, sesame oil, and pepper. Added the cornstarch mixture before the eggs.

I thought this soup was excellent.  The husband loved it too and he told me that he normally does not like egg drop soup.  I scaled the recipe down for 2 but added 2 1/2 cups chicken broth.  I also sauteed a few green onions, mushroom and garlic in some peanut oil first and then added to the soup.  I also added a touch of soy sauce and a drop of sesame oil.  OUTSTANDING RECIPE!!!!!

Good base recipe however I changed it a lot. For 8 servings:: First I lightly sauted 1 bunch green onions, 5 mushroom (chopped), 1 whole minced garlic, 2 carrots (shredded) and 1 stalk celery (chopped) in 1 Tbsp olive oil. Add to broth with 1/4c. sherry and a few shakes of soy sauce (to taste) and extra ginger and pepper along w/ the chives. Omit salt. Bring to a boil and add 1/4c frozen peas. I also added extra bullion to the cornstarch mixture.  Thicken before adding eggs.  The key to this is high quality broth and eggs.   DEFINITELY WILL MAKE AGAIN!

Yum, yum, yum!  I think I may have overstirred because my egg looked more like a shredded Kleenex than drops, but it tasted right-on.  Like other reviewers, I added the cornstarch and let it thicken before pouring in the egg.  Left out the salt and added a few drops of soy sauce and toasted sesame oil in each bowl, which gave it a great flavor.  It reheated well for lunch the next day too...this definitely hit the spot for a late-night Chinese craving!

My 9 year old loves egg drop soup, so I gave it a try. It was very good, the only thing I did differently was to skip the salt, & add a chicken bullion cube. My daughter gobbled it up and asked for more.

This is really really good.  It is so simple and so close to the real thing.  I used fresh ginger instead of ground and I added pepper and red crushed pepper since they each hit different parts of your toungue the spice does not overwhelm the soup.  I also added the egg after thickening the soup and I used 2 green scallions instead of chives.

This is a great recipe for egg drop soup!  It tastes very similar to our local restaurant's version.  I left out the chives (I didn't have any, and we're not used to them being in there).  I also used a little soy sauce (to taste) instead of salt.  I followed others advise of adding the egg after thickening the soup and it worked very well.  I will play with this a little to get it closer to what we are looking for, but for a basic recipe, this is it!!!  Thanks!

We like to have 'chinese night' in our house at least once a month and this recipe is quick and easy and even my nine year old loves it. Instead of chives, i used green onions,and i also added some soy sauce to this while cooking. I have even added yellow food coloring a time or two to give it that golden color you see in the restaurant. Very delicious.

I love egg drop soup--so happy I found this recipe. I followed it exactly except from experience, I added the cornstarch to warm broth and added it before the egg--its does get clumpy.
Whisk the broth as you add the eggs and it comes out amazing!!!
Thank you for sharing.

My daughter had a school project on China and had to bring in an item to share with the class.  We made this soup, 3 batches, the night before and did not add the eggs til the next morning and then it sat in a crockpot for 4 hours.  All of the children, including my daughter (12) who lives for egg drop soup LOVED this recipe.  I will make it again, thank you!!!

I loved this recipe!!!! It really does taste like the soup from the restaurant. I added frozen peas and carrots, and my sister suggested adding water chestnuts. This is one of the best recipes I have ever used! It really is a must try. I plan to use it next time I have a dinner party.

OK- this was ridiculously  easy - BUT it was a bit too salty for us. This might have been because I used boullion instead of broth. I will make this again but use less boullion or buy the broth. My husband commented that it had a bit too much egg it in then he finds when we eat out so next time i might reduce the egg by one.

Excellent!! The whole family enjoyed it.  I thickened the soup first and then added the egg.  Very easy.

I follwed this recipe exactly, except I did not add the 1/4 teaspoon salt.  It was delicious!  This is a very basic receipe that explains the technique used for egg drop soup.  You can add any additional ingredients to make it your own (fresh mushrooms, peas, etc.).  Thanks, W.J.!!!

This recipe was great!  I followed the suggestions of others and added the cornstarch BEFORE the egg...it looked/tasted pretty much like restarant versions. I added less salt too.

Very good recipe, although if you really want a more savory taste add a little sesame oil to the broth. For people who find it too eggy they may want to try Chicken Corn Soup which is the same recipe except with chicken and corn added instead of so much egg.

Even though I'll make a couple of changes next time, I'll give it 5 stars for how unbelievably fast and easy it is.  As others has said, mine didn't really thicken up as I'd hoped, so next time I'll try to add the cornstarch mixture before the egg.  I left the salt out this time because the broth was salty enough, but I think next time I'll put the salt in the egg as another reviewer said.  Also, I ended up adding some garlic and extra ginger, because it seemed to need a bit more flavor.  But overall, fantastic.

Fantastic! This takes hardly any time to make, and it is so delicious! It looks exactly like restaurant egg drop soup, but in my opinion it tastes even better. I just drizzled 2 beaten eggs into the broth (4 cups of water with 4 tsps of bouillon). Also used ginger paste, a splash of soy sauce, a couple of thinly-sliced mushrooms, and some green onions. I seriously doubt I will order egg-drop soup at Chinese restaurants ever again - this is so much better!

This was the best!  This was the first time I've tried to make a chinese dinner, at it complemented the meal very well.  I made it exactly according to the directions.  Next time, I think I'll use it as just the meal.  Thanks!

I have made this several times; YUMMY is all I can say!!!  I use bouillon too; I'm sure it's better with broth, but it's quite good with bouillon (just let it cook a little bit so the flavor can thoroughly mix in the water).  What's lovely about the egg yolk is you can use the extra egg white in fried rice (if you make fried rice).  I make this first when preparing my Chinese meal because it doesn't have to be served immediately.  DEFINATELY A KEEPER!

This is it!! It tastes identical to our little neighborhood Chinese take-out restaurant, with the addition of more salt. I'm basing this review off the original recipe, even though I ended up adding a few more things. I added a good bit of soy sauce, some more ginger powder, and only used two eggs (no extra yolk).  I was worried about adding the eggs (even a little intimidated!), but it turned out great. Mix the eggs with a fork, then kind of scoop the eggs onto the fork and drizzle in the hot broth. Make sure it's boiling when you do!

I took a few suggestions from the reviews and this turned out great. it's a very homie and comforting soup. I added a 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, a touch of white pepper, and dried chives we're just fine. I also added a little red pepper flakes. I thickened the soup with the corn starch mixture before adding the egg. Make sure to pick out the white clumpy parts of the egg because it makes egg chunks instead of the thin ribbons. Added fried wonton wrappers and it was great with my eggrolls. The taste is close enough to my local restaurant that I will keep these things on hand to avoid the trip. It reheats well too, so you can keep some in the fridge. Super easy to make. It's an all around winner. I will be using this recipe quite a bit.

Just what the doctor ordered. I used chicken stock not broth, simmered with carrot ,green onion, pressed garlic for about 20 min. Took them out then proceeded. Make sure to thicken first before adding eggs. And add those crunchies on top. :-)

I much prefer the simpler recipe of 4 cups broth, 2 beaten eggs, white pepper, and garnish with chives... I only tried this one because I had always wondered how to make my egg drop soup thicker- voila- cornstarch... the writer forgot to add that cornstarch does NOT dissolve in hot water-  you should always mix cornstarch in cold water first, then add to hot liquids- like gravy or this soup.  Otherwise tasted fine...

This was exactly what I wanted my egg drop soup to be! The only change I would make was, like most everyone else, put the corn starch mixture in before the eggs to get that ribboned egg look. Overall great recipe!

Yum, thank you!  This was so easy.  I used fresh ginger because it was all I had on hand. Also substituted spring onions for chives (again all I had on hand).  I used 1/2 Tbs xantham gum instead of corn starch and added a pinch of white pepper as another reviewer suggested.  I also thickened the soup then added the egg as many reviewers suggested.  Very simple to make and beautiful when finished. I really enjoyed it and can't wait to see what my son things (he's been begging me to make it).

Loved it! Based on other suggestions (and to make it a lil more heartier of a meal), I did add shredded carrots and mushrooms (about 1/4 cup of each) and added the cornstartch before the eggs (which I used 3 whole eggs). I'm not a fan of ginger, so I used ground white pepper instead with a dash of soy sauce to give it a lil extra flavor. This is already saved for another time...amazing!

Wow!  What a great egg drop soup recipe!  Very fast to make, too!  I think I made this in 5 minutes.  I added small diced tofu (recently made some other recipes with tofu which was the inspiration to make this soup with the leftover) and the egg AFTER the cornstarch, too.

This recipe is simple and had my family scrapping the bottom of the pot. We didn't change a thing.

After reading several reviews and watching the video, I proceeded to make a very quick and simple soup that tastes wonderful! Flavoring the broth with ginger, soy sauce, and scallion worked very well. Also thickening the soup before adding the eggs resulted in nice, flat, ribbony (is that even a word?) eggs. Garnished with green onions, the soup was a big hit. Thank you for an easy recipe that really tastes like your favorite Chinese restaurant!

The flavor is wonderful, I also read reviews abt adding a bit of onion/garlic, lil soy sauce, ginger and let it steep (remove onions/garlic) I added 2 1/2 t of cornstarch, to thicken.. Abt the eggs, I used 3 eggs and egg yolk, and I recommend stirring, while adding the eggs, (big chunks, stirring makes the ribbons, not egg chunks) and then let it cook for a minute.. Otherwise, this recipe is good, thank u for sharing, it saves me the trip/$$ to the store and restaurant

My family liked this recipe enough for me to tweak it through several versions until we finally settled on the changes we liked. I add 2-3 slices of fresh ginger to the chicken stock (and skip the ground ginger powder), along with 4-5 scallion whites and a couple cloves of garlic that I smash to release the oils. Simmer this for 10-15 minutes (with a lid on) and then turn off the heat and let it "steep" another 15-20 mins. Remove the onion, garlic and ginger and add 1/2-1 tsp Braggs liquid aminos and 1/8 tsp turmeric(good for the digestion and adds lovely golden color). Thicken before adding the egg. (I nearly double the cornstarch to create my family's preferred consistency). Bring back to a low boil and stir in the egg. Add salt to taste. Then I garnish with the chopped scallion greens. I'm getting rave reviews on this from friends and family and have made it three times this week. We use our own homemade chicken stock and fresh eggs, as well. It can't be beat!

I thickened the broth before adding the egg like so many people have suggested, and it turned out wonderful (but I didn't try it the other way, so I can't really compare).  I also used green onions instead of chives, since they were what I had at the house.  My boyfriend and I absolutely loved it - drank it straight from our bowls.  It's such a surprisingly filling meal, and makes just enough for two people to share for dinner.  We'll definitely be making it again.

Just made this as a quick dish before work and it is DELICIOUS! Super easy and it does taste like my local favorite restaurant's version. My only change from the recipe was using fresh ground ginger root since I had one in the fridge. Give this one a try!

I had to use chicken bouillon, rather than chicken broth. I followed the advice of another reviewer, who put the cornstarch in before the eggs.  I used 2 eggs (no sense wasting); I held a fork over the pot, and poured the egg over the fork.

This is super fast, and super easy! I have never made a faster and easier soup. I HIGHLY recommend it! I did however, only put 1 teaspoon of cornstarch in because I hate thick soups. I did this before adding the eggs as others had advised, and it turned out WONDERFULLY!

This is good and can be modified to your liking, but I only used two eggs and even then it was quite "eggy." I may have dumped the eggs in too fast, as I didn't have the patience to drizzles. I used a bit of ginger paste and some dried shallots and chives for the seasoning. I also added soy sauce.

This recipe was excellent, easy and tasted better than what you buy at the restaurants! I did take other reviewers suggestions and added the cornstarch mixture first, then added the egg and it turned out great! I kept everything else the same and even added some thin sliced mushrooms in the end...I will definitely be making this again!

This was excellent! My boyfriend is a huge fan of egg drop soup and has attempted many times to re-create it but none have been as spot on as this one was. I added the cornstarch before adding the eggs as others suggested and I think it worked wonderfully! I did add a splash of soy sauce when it was almost done and the flavor was perfect!

SUPER EASY and super good! My kids gobbled it down! The only things I did different was used dried chives, and added 3 whole eggs instead of 2 eggs and 1 yolk. It was a little thicker than normal watery restaraunt soup but still so good! My kids asked for leftovers.

Loved this! I am so glad to have found this easy recipe. Like others, I thickened before adding the egg. I also added a bit of diced chicken, used green onion instead of chives, and added about a tablespoon of low sodium soy sauce. Next time, I will make the broth with real ginger. This is a perfect appetizer soup!

Not good, but maybe my fault. The stock I used must have been too salty to begin with. It was homemade but it had been boiled down. And then the slimy texture from the cornstarch did not appeal to me. And the eggs I used were kind of old and there were bits of yellow yolk that had not cooked.

I had to make a couple of changes--I used ginger paste instead of the ginger powder we don't have and left out the chives we didn't have. Even so, the soup is terrific. Very eggy, which is what we like in an egg drop soup.

I deeply appreciate the effort W.J. Cory has gone to so that I don't have to. I now have a great soup recipe that is easily adapted for our personal tastes. I'll add black pepper (by my daughter's request) and make it thicker.

I just made this, with not all the ingredients because I was limited on what I had on hand, but had a craving for the soup! No ginger or chives/onions, and used 3 eggs = results that were good, but not as satisfying as I had hoped. It seems to be lacking "egg" flavor as I am used to in restaurants, and the chicken is the main taste. Next time I may use water and bouillon cubes instead and definitely more eggs. Very easy to make though!!

Good, the broth just seemed to be lacking a little something, but I can't put my finger on it...Might try one of the other recipes that call for soy sauce and a touch of sugar...

This was really good. My kids loved it. My 7 yr old, who doesn't like anything...ate 3 bowls!! The only thing different that I did to this was thicken it before adding the egg.  My family really enjoyed this soup...I will be making this again.

Used my homemade chicken broth and dried chives.  Otherwise, made as stated.  Wonderful!  Even my 5 year old granddaughter requested it for the next day.

Very good soup, and my wife loved it. I added a little rice wine vinegar, a tablespoon or so of low sodium soy sauce instead of salt, and I used 1 can chicken broth plus enough water to make 4 cups liquid, added 3 chicken bouillon, used 3 whole eggs, and a dash of white pepper. When I make it again, I will add a little more vinegar, a little more corn starch, and will probably use scallions instead of chives.

This is a great "base" recipe for egg drop soup.  I added lots of cabbage, shredded carrots, and celery to mine and it turned out fantastic.  Also, the recipe doesn't make a whole lot- if you have a big family to feed or want left overs, triple the recipe.

Great recipe...I tried this and added the cornstarch mixture before the eggs, I also improvised w/parsley flakes because I did not have chives on hand....still, great flavor! I will definitely use it again and recommend to friends!

This is not my favorite Egg Drop Soup recipe I've made. It's a good starter, but it really lacks the depth of other recipes I've made. Not a bad starter recipe but I would make a lot of alterations, or just find a different recipe.

THis is very, very good!  I like the little crispy things at the restaurant to put in it, so I crumbled up some Tostitos corn chips and it made it even better.  Made twice already!

this was better than most resturants. I altered it a little. I used 6 cups broth added the starch mix in before the eggs and used fresh grated ginger and miced garlic. Also instead of chives i used green onions and 6 eggs. so my recipe was a little different than this but still same concept.

Easy! Who knew? I didnt even use cornstarch and I subbed the leeks I had for chives. Also found that one large egg was plenty. I used a bouillon cube and a pinch of garlic powder to complement the ginger.

Better than any restaurant in my area.  The only change I made was I added a lil white pepper an a couple of drops of soy sauce (rest. package) to my serving.  I will never buy egg drop soup from a restaurant again.  Now I will hunt for a good wanton soup recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

This is just about the easiest soup I've ever made! I didn't have cornstarch, so I used flour, but I don't think it had quite the right effect (nothing bad, but it just didn't really thicken using 2 tbs.) Either way, a very good VERY easy recipe as is, and I'm sure you could customize it using soy sauce, pepper, etc. if you're in the mood to mix it up a little.

This was great! I was out of chicken broth, so I used those cube things. I also didn't add the salt. I added green onion and some leftover pork I had on hand. I tickened it up before I added the egg.

I did thicken this first before adding the eggs and still got puffy eggs but I'm sure it was my technique.  For such a simple soup it had great flavor but did think it could be improved upon.  Will make again but try adding some additional flavors.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was good but I still felt like it needed a little something.  Adding more salt helped. Per other reviews and added the eggs last.  The soup was a nice consistency.

omg!!! so good!! and so easy! i needed to go to the grocery store, but just didn't really want to and my 4 year old wanted soup, so i looked on AR and this is what i came up with that i knew she would love (she is part Vietnamese and eats like them, so soup is a favorite). the whole pot was gone with just my 2 kids and myself. the only thing i did different was i didn't have enough chicken broth. so i added 2 cans of chicken broth and one slightly bigger can of vegetable broth, added green onions instead and used 3 eggs with one egg yolk. VERY VERY GOOD!! for sure i will make this often!! thank you so much W.J. Cory!!

Tastes fantastic.  I tend to leave out the salt, and substitute green onions for the chives.  It refrigerates nicely too.

I actually think it could use a little more ginger, and it turned out awesome!  I can't wait to have the leftovers for dinner tomorrow!  Even my fiance, who isn't a fan of soup, said it was pretty good (rave review for him).

This was very tasty! Tastes just like the real thing from an authentic chinese restaurant. I added a little bit of soy sauce to mine because I like the flavor it gives. Also, I think I would prefer green onions to chives.

Love it.  It may not be quite as good as my favorite restaurant Egg Drop Soup but it is the best I have found on any recipe website and I have looked for a long time.  I prepared this with one of the chinese shrimp dishes from this site and my company loved both dishes.

I love this egg drop soup.  It is also a quick and nutritious soup for when someone is sick.  I don't think thickening the soup is necessary so I leave out the cornstarch.  Instead of wasting an egg white I just add three eggs to the 4 cups of broth.  Make sure to have the water boiling and slowly pour the eggs into the broth over a fork.

Soooo good!  Made for my picky, picky 8 yr old grandangel that is sick.  She loves Egg Drop Soup.  Yesterday when I made her the 1st batch the eggs puffed...she did not care, she still thought it was great.  I remembered reading a review that told what to do to prevent puffy eggs.  So...today added the cornstarch 1st to thicken, boiled the broth good then poured the eggs in a slow, steady stream into the hot broth.  Let it sit for a few minutes without stirring.  Perfect!!!  She is on her 2nd bowl and says she loves the soup and feels much better.  Thanks for the recipe and thanks to all the great reviewers for their helpful suggestions.

In the future I will omit the corn starch from this recipe, because it gave the soup a bit of a gelatin-like texture and I prefer it watery. I also used only the egg whites (omitted the yolk) and it was still delicious!

Great flavor and simple recipe.  Only drawback is the eggs just didn't turn out as I would have hoped in the soup.  At any rate, would still try this again.

Overall this recipe tasted pretty close to resaurant egg drop soup I've eaten. However, my husband thought it had too much egg in it. Also, I think green onions would be better than the chives. In addition, I added half a can of chopped water chestnuts for added crunch and texture. The soup did not re-heat very well as far as I was concerned either. I will not use this recipe again.

THIS WAS EXCELLENT!!! I had the hardest time convincing my boyfriend [an avid coniseur of Chen's Chines Restaurant] that this was homemade!! Honestly. I didnt add any cornstarch to mine as I like the broth texture by itself. I seasoned it with garlic powder and some red pepper flakes to add a little kick. And I also cooked chopped fresh mushrooms in with the green onions. SO SIMPLE but SOOO GOOD!! Will be making again and again.

Wow!  Did what other posts suggested and used 3 whole eggs and 1 egg yolk.  Other than this slight change I made as directed and am pleased with the quality of this recipe.  I used College Inn light and fat free stock making this super easy to make.  This recipe is a keeper!

For those who have time-make your own chicken broth.  It's even better.  This is a fabulous recipe.  Keep in mind that the egg thickens the soup - a lot! I'll be making this again, for sure!!

This was a good tasting, simple recipe.  You can whip this up in no time and make your family happy.  There's very few ingredients in this simple soup, so don't skimp on the quality or the taste will suffer.

This was an outstanding recipe. A couple points I wanted to make was that chives are not the same as green onions, which the picture shows, and green onions would really be better than chives. I did the cornstarch first and stirred too much the first time and ended up with a gorgeous thick soup, but the egg strings were too tiny, so remember not to stir too much until the eggs have had 10 seconds or so to cook.

Awesome recipe!  Just have to watch how much cornstarch goes into the soup.  The first time I made this, it turned out perfect.  The second time I made this, I made the broth too thick.  Changes I made:  Boil broth with 1 inch piece of ginger thinly sliced and 2 whole cloves of garlic lightly crushed for 15 minutes.  Fish all the ginger and garlic out and continue with rest of recipe.

This is my go to recipe for Egg Drop soup. I always use this recipe for a starter when I am cooking Asian (I like to serve it with sesame noodles and egg rolls!)  and it is fantastic! I never have ground ginger, so I usually omit it and use green onions instead of chives, but this is by far the best Egg Drop Soup recipe! Better than the restaurants! I like mine with a few generous dashes of pepper. Yum!

AMAZING! I've been *trying* for years to make this soup like the restraunts do! I prefer the egg ribbons to be larger and flatter, so next time I'll add a bit of flour to the beaten eggs before dropping them in.

I used canned chicken broth (which already has a fair amount of sodium) so this was way too salty for me.  Otherwise it was great, and easy.  Next time I will leave the salt out....and I'd throw in some frozen green peas, I bet that would be perfect!

Great, easy soup! I cut the recipe in half & I did add the cornstarch before the eggs (thanks to the reviewers for the heads up!). Out of laziness, I did not separate the one egg, I just used both whole eggs but it was a little "yolky...next time I will use just the white of one egg, as the recipe says. I added a couple of tbp of mirin & I also sprinkled it w/ a  bit of seseame oil. We started our asian meal off w/ this light soup, served in coffee mugs that look like beakers, w/ smoked salmon "flowers" alongside. Then on to king crab legs & Japanese style Zuchinni (from allrecipes) & spring rolls served /w oriental dipping sauce (also from allrecipes), sake & pickled ginger slices w/ Japanese Cheeseacke for dessert. Wsa a great start to a great meal...thanks!

I did not follow the recipe exactly but I did use this recipe as a guide.  I used vinegar and soy sauce but not ginger as I did not have any.  I also used 1 whole egg and 1 egg white (to 4 cups broth) which turned out fine.  Next time I'll probably skip the yolk altogether.

I am not sure what I did wrong but it looked like egg drop soup but it tasted like dirty diapers.  Maybe it was the ginger...i'm not sure. It would be better with some corn in it also.

I loved this recipe!  I was on my way to a chinese restaurant and remembered this recipe.  I hurried home to make it and I agree, it is wonderful.  

I didn't have any chicken stock so I used bouillon cubes instead.  I also added extra cornstarch to make it thicker.  Overall, it is the best egg drop soup I've had in a while.

This is really good.  Word to the wise - make sure you buy low sodium chicken broth so you can control the salt.  I didn't the first time and it was just too salty.  Add a little white pepper and this is like the name says, just like the restaurants!

Very good, though not very close to the egg drop soup I've tried in restaurants.  Will make again.

Not sure what I did wrong, but this was very bland.  Sorry but I probably won't make this one again.

My wife and I always order the egg drop soup when we go to a Chinese restruant. This recipe isn't the same but really close and I think even better. I did add four blades of a green onion (just the green blades only) to the recipe but made no other changes. I will make this soup often. Definately a five star soup.

Wonderful recipe!  I didn't have chicken broth so I used water and chicken bullion cubes.  Added some leftover chicken and used fresh ginger slices and a dash of white pepper. mmmmm delicious!

The taste was ok. I agree that it was missing something. The broth just wasn't quite right. Maybe not enough cornstarch on my part, but the flavor wasn't rich enough for me.

Wonderful!  My family liked this better than the restaurant type.  I used a little green onion instead of chives and grated ginger root instead of ground ginger.  So simple and so tasty.  I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is absolutely exquisite.  This is the best egg drop soup recipe on this site.  I added a bit more ginger as my husband and I prefer, and I used chicken stock concentrate and water to make the equivilent for chicken broth.  Absolutely divine and full of flavor!

I followed this recipe loosely and it turned out really good.  I doubled the recipe.  I didn't have cornstarch (although I thought I did) so I did without and it was fine.  I used the ground ginger, I used green onion and WAY MORE than 2 tablespoons, I omitted the salt (the broth was salty enough!)and I used 3 whole eggs rather than 2 +1 yolk (but remember, I doubled the broth and there was PLENTY egg).  Oh, and I added about a cup of peas.  All in all it was really really good... the ginger gave an authentic taste.... so I thank you W.J. Cory, for a good starting base and a delish soup.

This soup is awesome.  I've made it a few times now and it always turns out perfectly.  I always leave out the salt since the broth is salty enough on its own.  I've added (not all in the same batch!) green onions, fresh pea pods, small broccoli flowers, shredded carrot, and chopped spinach.  I think the key with the add-ins is to not over do it, a little really goes a long way.  I will definitely be making this soup often.

Yum,this really does taste just like the restaurant soup!  I added the cornstarch mixture before adding the eggs and it seemed to work well.  I also tripled the ginger amount.  It was great!

This soup definately had more taste than my original egg drop that i made up, some said it was too bland, but almost any egg drop soup isnt that flavorful, it was good.

This was very good :).  Thank you for the recipe.  I had made wontons and added them (when I order take out usually I choose the combination soup).  I did not have the time to drizzle the egg as you instructed (time constraint-I thought I'd be there all night with the fork and egg "drop") but I will heed your specific instructions the next time I make this!   I made this before (a different recipe) and the egg stayed pretty much coagulated, which was not too appetizing which is my own fault.  I suppose that is due to adding it too quickly to the boil.  Live and learn!  Thanks again :)

I have been making this for 30+ yrs mostly when someone is sick & they don't feel like eating. I add a few Jpnz somen noodles (angel hair would probably work, too) broken off by my thumb so the pcs are short and the soup can be eaten with a spoon. I add small pcs of chicken once the appetite starts to come back.

It tasted good and was fun to prepare, but I was left somewhat underwhelmed by the flavor. I felt it mostly tasted like chicken broth - not quite restaurant-quality in my opinion. I served the soup with an Asian chopped salad on the side.

Love this! It was so easy and quick. Like many others, I added the thickener before the eggs. It’s the perfect comfort food.

I think turned out yummy!  My eggs didn’t do quite like I would have liked.  I used a whisk and as I read later in some comments they suggested a wooden spoon and slowly stir them in.   But other than that, after three days of the flu and crazing egg drop soup, this made me very happy!

Good quality! It's easy to make and not bad for a winter's night! I would add some green onions instead of chives, some sesame oil, and some sherry in order to make it a bit more authentic. I would also up the egg quantity to one per person.

So simple and delicious. Didn't have chives, used half the amount of onion flakes.  Perfect taste and texture.

I have made this recipe before. Add sesame oil to taste and omit the cornstarch. The cornstarch is just to thicken a bit and I dont like it. Added sesame oil and was perfect.

Egg drop soup was one of the first dishes I remember making from a children's cookbook as a kid. I chose this recipe to make with my 4 year old as head chef and it was a fun and lovely meal. Five stars.

Flavor was good, but recipe needs  revised instructions.  I used instant bouillon to make broth, so I did not add salt.  I used the ginger but could not taste it, so it’s not a deal breaker if you don’t have it.  Broth / cornstarch mixture needs more cornstarch to thicken properly.  The broth/cornstarch mixture needs to be heated, adding scallions when close to being thickened.  Once mixture is thickened & is still boiling, slowly add beaten eggs.  I used the whisk to break up the eggs a little more after they were added.   Really needs more cornstarch to thicken properly and create a more appealing restaurant-style appearance.

Great recipe! However, the key to the restaurant style is to THICKEN the broth FIRST!!!! Add the beaten eggs last, then finish off with a tsp of sesame oil.

This is a great starter recipe! But it tasted very bland. I would add one cube of chicken bouillon and more salt and pepper. It also was a bit too thin, so I would put a lot more cornstarch in next time.

I made no changes whatsoever to this recipe.  It was absolutely delicious and I actually felt like I was eating in a restaurant in Chinatown.  I ate the whole pot!!  It was that good.  Definitely add some white pepper to it.  Thank you so much for this post.

Taking into consideration that we are trying to eat healthier, it tastes good. The only reason it's missing a star is because the restuarant ones seem to taste a bit better but are quite possibly less healthy.

Simple and quick and delicious. I’m on a diet, so used fat free and salt free broth, thus stayed compliant, plus got some protein in!

MSFurious1 Knows how to make this soup.  Follow it and it will be authentic.    I use tamari (made from only soy) instead of soy that is made from soy and wheat.

This is a simple and delicious recipe. I made it a bit more healthy by adding mixed vegetables (carrots, corn kernel, beans, and broccoli). Also, 1 tsp of chicken bouillon gave it a bit more taste. Then I added cilantro for garnishing.

Don't add ginger.
add 2 1/2 cups water and 1 1/2 cups broth, instead of 4 cups broth.

instead of a fork for the egg, use a syringe

I have been looking for a restaurant quality egg drop for years.  My eggs always looked like I dropped scrambled eggs into broth.  This recipe is quite simple and it wasn’t the recipe that made a difference.  It was the suggestions to thicken the broth first. Thickened, the swirls slow cause the ribbons to form.  Bravo!  I boiled a rotisserie chicken, then added the meat, yummy,

Egg drop soup is not something I like but my husband loves it. Since I don’t care for it, I didn’t taste along the way but made sure to follow the recipe to a T.  My husband ate every bit of it and went back for seconds. He said it taste just like the restaurants. ????

I love going to Chinese Restaurants but I’m not sure if I’ve ever had Egg Drop Soup. For some reason it sounded appealing. I used fresh ginger and veggie bullion cubes because we’re vegetarians.  The soup was fantastic. My daughter is sick and she said she hates Egg Drop Soup but I got her to try it and she had a second helping. The ginger really made it and the taste was mild and not eggy at all. I really loved it. It was easy and cheap. I did put the cornstarch in before the eggs. I added the Chinese fried noodles. Yum.

I would not use the ginger, wrong flavor for egg drop soup.
The Chinese restaurants I visit have a clear, THICK broth which I have never been able to duplicate. This broth is thin, cloudy,  & water-like in consistency.

Tasty and easy! Following other recommendations, I added the corn starch slurry before the eggs. I also increased the eggs to 4 large instead of 2 plus a yolk.

This is awful. There is barely any flavor and the eggs turned out clumpy and chunky. Tried it out for Chinese New Year and it was bad.

This was my first time making egg drop soup and this recipe was amazing!  It was so fun and easy to make! I made it the first time to bring it over to my fiance on campus and then showed him how to make it and he loved it too! :3

I had no white pepper... added a dash of black instead. I made three servings and used a quarter teaspoon of sesame oil across all three instead of each. The soup was easy to make and delicious and I will make it again. I will back off a bit on the soy sauce as it was a tad too much for my taste.

This recipe is easy and forgiving. I didn't have chicken broth, so I used dashi (fish broth) instead. I mixed the corn starch and broth mixture before adding the eggs, like reviewers recommended. I don't like wasting egg whites, so I threw in three full eggs. No problem! Also, I used red onions and fresh ginger. I topped it off with hot sauce. I'd say you can pretty much make this however you want with whatever you have on hand, and it's going to be delicious.

I didn't have green onion and I also added just a small bit of carrot, corn and chicken because they serve it this way at my favorite restaurant. I think I really missed out without green onion. Still this is a great recipe.

We love making this soup.  We just use the whole eggs.  We add chunks of zucchini.  Add soy sauce at the table to taste.

Oops I accidentally pressed save and couldn't go back to continue my review. I was saying that I like a thicker soup consistency so next time I would add more cornstarch. And I also didn't see the point of wasting the 3rd egg by seperate for the Yolk and the egg white so I just used 3 whole eggs. Also added some frozen corn just for fun. Will definitely make it again though.

This soup is better than any restaurant that I have tried it at.  I didn't add the cornstarch simply because I am out of it but it was still amazing!! Make sure to whisk your eggs really well before adding to your boiling broth. Very good!! I will be adding this to my favorites!!!

FANTASTIC!   I omitted the salt, as the chicken broth is already salty. I added an extra egg, too, because that's my favorite part! I plan to add some mini bite sized ham and celery.  thanks!

I absolutely loved this soup! I used a carrot-based stock, which gave the soup a...unique color. The stock I used was also low-sodium, so I ended up having to use a LOT more salt in order to get to a happy place with the flavor, but that was just my experience! I didn't taste much ginger, so the flavor didn't really affect me at all (but I love ginger, so I will probably add more next time). I'd also recommend adding the scallions as a garnish rather than in the soup, as they tended to clump together in my soup and didn't incorporate very well. Overall, a very good recipe to follow if this is your first time making egg drop soup!

Tried this, however, you don't have to drizzle the egg with the fork.  It takes too long and you get the same effect when you just pour the egg in and stir.

I felt like I needed to add way more flavor, so I added a little sesame seed oil about a 1/2 tsp. and then added 1 TBS of soy sauce.

I love chinese food and this is excellent. Follow the tips of thickening the soup with cornstarch first and then slowly stiring in the egg for those restaurant quality egg ribbon's you are looking for.

The soup turned out well. I think it calls for too much cornstarch, you can definitely taste it, as it a little overpowering. When adding the eggs, I found if you pour them in while gently whisking, it seems to work better than drizzling.

great tasting quick receipe! I added the cornstarch before the egg like other people suggested and it worked . . .still a bit clumpy on the cornstarch but I suspect it is my lack of experience!

Easy Recipe that luckily is also easily altered. I made it similar to the directions, but added mushrooms, dehydrated habaneros,  worchestershire sauce,  & black pepper. There just wasn't enough taste in it for me the way it was. Easy recipe & I believe it would be way better with beef broth, but that would be more of a hot & sour soup.

This was definitely soup and easy to make. However:
~It did not taste at all like egg drop soup
~It was not nearly thick enough
~It was very bland.

My advice: add more cornstarch, add eggs last and when removed from heat, use less ginger, add a dash of garlic and soy sauce and white pepper.  You will not get away with not seasoning and thickening this soup.  It is good over rice however.

Thanks for sharing this wonderful, simple recipe and technique. Also appreciate all the tips in reviews such as boiling fresh ginger and adding white pepper and sesame oil. Used the tip too for whisking  the eggs in a plastic bag and cutting off small corner to slowly stream eggs into the clockwise swirling soup. 

Thanks sooo much!! Love this site. :)

I think this recipe was very good. It was warm and comforting. The only thing is that I would add some more salt, because this soup was a little bland for my tastes. Maybe it's because I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, because that's what I had on hand. Otherwise, a very good soup.

Easy and delicious.  I didn't add salt, as I used bouillon and that is plenty salty.  I also took other users' advice and add the cornstarch to the broth before the eggs.  My 3 year old also gave the soup two thumbs up.

I forgot to add the ginger, used low sodium chicken broth,  skipped the sugar,  and added 4 eggs instead. ..omg.. amazing!  For a little hint when you're ready to add the egg into the broth mixture, pour it in slowly, a little bit at a time while gently stirring the soup  with a fork... it makes it spread out and cooks the egg just like the picture! I added pepper and garlic salt to taste!

Great recipe. Followed suggestion to add ginger, garlic, sherry, and soy sauce. It added great flavor. I also added julienned carrots, celery, and cabbage (boiled in broth until soft before adding corn starch). I've already passed the recipe on to my mother-in-law who LOVES egg drop soup. Definitely a keeper. Thanks for the great recipe!

This Egg Drop did not make my jaw drop! I hate having to use grocery store chicken broth; it would have been better if the recipe included homemade chicken broth. Grocery store chicken broth is way too salty (and I bought reduced sodium broth). Overall, I would recommend a different recipe.

Made a nice Chinese dinner for my family and this recipe was a fantastic addition.  My family raved over it and wanted the recipe so they could make it at home.  In previous attempts at making Egg Drop Soup on my own, I think I got too fancy and ambitious in seasoning not realizing it was the simplicity that made it great.  Great recipe and highly recommended.

This was great! I liked the comments of adding soy sauce, ginger, and green onions - it took it to restaurant quality.

My tip: Use a chopstick or reverse side of a spoon to break up and stir the egg. It will give more string pieces than chunks.

This was so good! Much better than any I had made before, and so simple. I did not have any ginger so I added a dash of black pepper, and I used less broth with the corn starch which worked out well. Those were the only changes I made. I think what really made it great was the addition of that extra egg 
yolk, it gave the egg mixture much more substance. Definitely a keeper!

Wonderful! I have never made egg drop soup before, but we love it at our local restaurant. This recepie was easy to follow, and tastes great. When it was finished, I added about a teaspoon of low sodium soy sauce and it was perfect.

I added one squirt of La-Yu chilli oil at the end of the preparation process. This almost turned this recipe into something similar to a hot and sour soup. Great recipe. I'll definitely make this again.

Better than restaurant style ! I had to do some minor changes, I used 1 cup of Swanson 33% sodium chicken broth and 3 cups of water with 3 tablespoon of chicken bouillon powder because I didn't have enough Swanson broth in hand. I bring to boiled , used 2 scallions ; chopped in 1 inch, 2-1 inch smashed ginger , and 1 cloves garlic. I let it boiled in the broth for a few minutes and took them out. Then I added 1-2 dash of sesame oil and used 2 eggs white and 2 eggs with yolk included. I didn't use a fork to put them in. Instead, I stir the broth clockwised and slowly pour in the eggs bits-by-bits; I just keep stirring Til all my eggs are done. Then I let it sit to cook a few minutes and garnish with scallions ! However, I had some chunks of eggs ; which I like anyways. I'll make this again!

I enjoyed this but it was a little too salty. I would make it again using reduced sodium chicken broth. Also I recommend using chives as the recipe states not substituting for green onion.

I thought I was sitting in a restaurant! I did add a heap of mushrooms to the broth.  When those and the onions cooked down then added couple of dashes of soy sauce. I only used 1/4 teaspoon of ginger. ALeo did the cornstarch before the eggs so eggs would come out more stringy. All in all great recipe!

AMAZING! I have a LOVE for egg drop soup and I was THRILLED to find this recipe! I didn't have chicken broth though so I used vegetable broth and it tasted just like the restaurant recipe. I also added a whole head of cabbage which required some extra water in the sauce pan but it didn't mess with the flavor at all! And I also added some carrot shavings and pepper to my liking. And I went with the other reviews and added the eggs last and it was perfect. Will make many more times!!!

This was so good! I can't believe I didn't learn how to make this sooner. I didn't have green onions so I used the little bit of garlic chives I had plus a little bit of yellow onion. Still tasted amazing and I can't wait to have it with green onions. YUM!

Super easy and delicious!   I've used green onion and yellow onion depending on what I had on hand as well as thinly sliced garlic and fresh ground pepper to taste.  Make sure you thicken it before dropping the egg!

I made this with 1, 2-cup can of chicken broth, two chicken bouillon cubes, two cups water, one heaping tablespoon dried chives, two eggs, large pinch of ginger, pinch of fine ground black pepper, and two table spoons of cornstarch.  10 minutes tops.   Just right!  No added salt necessary- the broth and bouillon have enough on their own.  Excellent!

OMGosh!  This is a SPOT ON recipe!  I LOVE IT!!  So, the ONLY thing I did was add 1 tsp of regular sugar into the cornstarch and broth, that is it!  Then I took some egg roll sheets and sliced three of them into strips, fried them real quick, then put them in the soup and bingo!  PERFECT!!!  Thank you so much!!!  It's a keeper!  FYI, if you do the strips, I filled a small fry pan with about 1/2 inch of veggie oil, they cook quickly so don't let them stay in there very long....even when they look too light,  take them out....best crunch with the soup!

I made it with one small change.  I did not have scallions on hand, so used finely chopped onions instead.  It turned out ok, but wasn't really what I was looking for.  It seemed like it needed more salt and was missing something.  Next time I will try adding sherry and soy sauce.

Ginger was a no go. Tastes better without it. Also at one point instead of chicken broth, I used a packet of miso soup with seaweed. That worked well :)

I've been fighting a terrible cold and was prepared to eat just chicken broth for lunch but my daughter wanted to up the ante and go for egg drop soup. I'm so glad she did! This recipe was easy to make despite being too sick to do much else - and it filled the entire family up (we did increase the servings to 6 to feed our family of 4). Even my picky son, who generally passes on egg drop soup, gobbled this up.  We will definitely be adding this to our regular family favorites file.

I made this soup for a quick lunch the other day. It was good. I've rated it 4 stars on it's own. I always taste while I'm cooking and added chicken bouillon to give it more flavour. (I like food to be bursting with flavour) I believe all soups the sum of all the parts but the stock, base broth, is the difference between a good soup or a so-so soup. Thanks for giving me a good basic recipe idea.

just made this for company.  i wanted a nice light soup before dinner.  left out the chives/gr. onion as one guest doesn't care for them.  used 1/4 t. of pureed ginger rather than powdered and added some grated carrot. excellent and would definitely make again.

wow... all i can say is simply stunning..... when i first read this recipe i wont lie but i was of the most skeptic. but truly after following these these all but too simple steps i found that the outcome was of the absolute majestic flavor. the ginger was at the most firm satisfying level of flavor, and the complete culinary genius of this recipe has sincerely left me in all but awe...

Love this recipe! Tastes awesome!!! The only thing I recommend is to add the eggs last so it's not in clumps.. Overall this recipe is worth the try.

I've made this sooo many times, I love it! Have had people ask me to make it multiple times as well. It's also very quick (done in less than 30 min).

This recipe is a great base, and you can easily change the proportions to fit your taste. Here are the changes I make: 

1. Use low-sodium chicken broth; I find the normal broth to have a very overpowering taste that doesn't taste good with this soup. 
2. Depending on what consistency you want, you may want to add more corn starch. I use 1 tbsp cornstarch for every cup of liquid (so 4 tbsp for this given recipe). The soup is thin in the given recipe.
3. Can very easily customize it (tho it's also great on its own). I love adding corn and tofu. Have also added spinach and peas/carrots before. 
4. I use tons of ginger and probably grate over a tablespoon

Other reviewers have mentioned important tips about the egg and cornstarch, so if you follow those instructions, it's hard to go wrong with this soup!

Made exactly as directed.  Thanks for the awesome directions W.J. Cory!   They helped tremendously.  This soup is easy to make and extremely tasty.  I actually made it after work and it is not too involved for an after work kind of quick meal.  Am definitely making this again--husband and 12 year old child loved it, too.

This is the BEST egg drop recipe I have ever tried. Better than most egg drop soups I've ordered at restaurants. I eat mine with extra fresh chives and a bit of soy sauce. Yum! Thank you.

Just made this. Used flour instead of corn starch because we're out and I had a craving! We also thickened the broth before adding the eggs as suggested in other comments and added 1t of sugar and a pinch of garlic salt. So yummy! My daughter (4) thinks it's better than the restaurants :)

For me, egg drop soup is the perfect healthy afternoon pick-me-up and this one is very good.  If I have the time, I'll slice a couple of scallions and grate a bit of fresh ginger also.  I love the flavor of soy sauce in this but not all the salt, so I use the low sodium.

This is absolutely divine! My fiance and I have recently started a ketogenic diet, so I've been striving to make it as painless as possible. It's not hard to do, but eventually you get tired of having the same things over and over again. One of the blessings is the versatility of eggs. I really wanted to find a soup that didn't utilize pasta or beans with a lot of carbs. I had a container of chicken broth in my hand with which I didn't know what to cook, so I was relieved when I came across this recipe. I saw the carb count and immediately decided to try it based on the positive feedback. I just made some about ten minutes ago; I must say, this will be a staple in our household long after our diet has ended. I can't wait for my fiance to come home from work. Thank you so much!

Very good!  I did as another reviewer suggested and added 1 T of soy sauce, 1 T of sherry and a dash of ginger.  I put the green onions in and let them cook in the soup to get some of the flavor into it.  I also used homemade chicken broth.  I can't eat cornstarch because I'm allergic to starch so I just left that out.  The eggs did puff up, but if you stir the soup as your pouring the eggs in, they don't puff up so bad.  A great low calorie dish!

Wonderful!  Thanks to the reviewers who suggested adding white pepper (yum!) and adding the eggs using a sandwich bag with the corner cut off.  Easy and less mess.  This is a great comfort food.

This soup is so good!  I agree with other reviewers: add the cornstarch before the egg to get nice thin ribbons.  I also go in and pull out any large egg-white chunks that may have formed before serving to give a consistent  restaurant quality.

I never ever leave reviews but this recipe is perfect!! It taste exactly like the soup from where i order chinese food only less salty(great). I did add the flour before i added the egg and took the pot off of the heat before i added the egg so it did not overcook.

I never made egg drop soup so I used this recipe as a starting point and adjusted according to comments /personal taste. If I remember correctly, I steeped quite a few minced green onions & 2 garlic cloves in broth. Added the ginger, a bit of sesame oil, soy sauce, sriracha for some heat and a splash of vinegar for sour as it needed more flavor for my taste. Removed cloves, thickened with 2tbsp cornstarch before adding 3/4 eggs (didn't bother separating one of the eggs-hate waste). White pepper & salt to taste. I also threw in handfuls of fresh spinach at the end to add some vitamins. Served immediately.

Great recipe!  Just what I needed after playing in the snow!  This soup is great, easy to make, and I usually have the ingredients laying around the house.  If you use bouillon cubes, like I do, however I would skip out on the salt :)  Happy cooking!

Whole family loved it and it is so easy. Will definitely reverse the order of the eggs and corn starch next time and perhaps add a little miso...

This is the second time I made this soup and it actually tasted and came out better. The only thing I will change the next time I make this is to omit the salt since I like to add a bit of soy sauce. My family really enjoyed it and I will make this again.

You can add peas, corn, carrots, water chestnuts, soy sauce -- whatever floats your bubble, but THIS is the EXACT simple yummy egg drop soup that I know and love!!  (except the salt...if you use regular chix broth or bouillon, it doesn't need it.).  Thanks WJ Cory!!

This is fantastic! I used half a teaspoon of grated ginger instead of ground ginger. I also added the cornstarch mixture before adding the egg. I used a salty chicken broth, so next time I might cut back or lose the added salt... it came out a little saltier than I like.

This recipe was surprisingly simple and delicious!  I'm still trying to figure out what happened, but my broth seemed too strong for this recipe. I may have to water the broth down or lessen the ginger next time, add a couple of tablespoons of soy sauce along with adding the cornstarch before the egg. My kids love egg drop soup, especially when they are ill.  This will definitely stop me from wasting money at the Chinese place down the street.

It needed more salt.  Next time I won't use low-sodium chicken broth.  Everything else was good.

We did not like this at all. Somehow the cornstarch ruined it and it ended up being clumpy and tasting like straight up chicken broth. Not sure if we'll try it again.

Very tasty! I leave the salt out and add a splash of soy sauce at the end, and enjoy that more. Even with using better than bullion instead of broth, it doesn't over salt in my opinion. For a more authentic taste, add a touch of sesame oil. For slight heat, or a ton, or anything in betweeen- add sriracha! I'm very sensitive to heat and I have no issue with it- in fact I think it improves the authenticity of the taste! You won't be disappointed :) I'm glad this was here when I got a craving at 2am ;)

This really is amazing egg drop soup! I was craving what my local restaurant serves so I bought a soup mix at the store and it was nasty! Found this recipe and couldn't be happier. Thanks for a great recipe!! Note to self: next time try adding cornstarch before eggs :)

Here's our families results:  Prepared as written with the exception of adding corn starch before the egg.  Turned out a little too salty.  Could have been because of the broth I used.  Otherwise, very tasty.  Will add more green onion next time.

Very good!  My daughter and I enjoyed preparing this together.  We added  the broth/cornstarch mixture prior to adding the egg.  We also added some water chestnuts for texture.  Finally, we used fresh ginger, about a 1/2 teaspoon.  Yum!

Really loved this. I never thought I could make really good egg drop soup.
Followed other reviewers tips: Stir in cornstarch first to the broth and then add the beaten eggs last. It came out perfect and tasked great.

Loved this! I was very stingy with the ginger and glad I was! This stuff also was wonderful the next day, even better than the first day! I added a small amount of finely chopped onion and celery and it added just enough flavor. I also added just a small amount of soy sauce, like a teaspoon. This is now a staple in our household now!

Just finished a bowl of the first egg drop soup I have ever made. Very easy to follow the recipe. I had no chicken broth so I used bouillon and I think that made it a little too salty. Other wise I followed the recipe. I think it turned out pretty close to what I get in my local Chinese places, except I think it needs more cornstarch. i will make it again!

Great for a light lunch full of protien. I followed another reviewers advice and added the eggs after thickening.  The second time I made it I added a few drops of sesame oil and a splash of light soy sauce for a little extra punch. Also, it reheats very well in the microwave.

Great Recipe!  Added the eggs after the cornstarch mixture as others suggested.  Loved the ginger flavor!  Added small cubes of tofu and small dumplings from Trader Joes.  This is so simple and yummy!

I have never reviewed a recipe before but I had read most of the reviews so I decided to make this. It was just fair if that. Not restaurant quality at all. Sorry.

I was surprised how much this tasted like egg drop soup from a Chinese restaurant! I actually didn't have ground ginger so I put a little bit of fresh ginger and it wasn't bad at all! Thanks!

Oooh, yummy! I added a tablespoon of soy sauce to add depth to the flavor of the broth as well as some minced garlic and green onions cut into 1/4 inch slices. Super easy and super delicious!! If you wanted to you could always throw in some cooked chicken, pork or shrimp, but I love it just the way it is! Oh, and as many have already stated, add the eggs AFTER you thicken the soup. You will be much happier with the results!

Great for the low carb  dieters!! Added the cornstarch before the eggs, added garlic sea salt, minced garlic,  and black pepper. Finally found a tasty use for Nooodles (yam noodles) deep fry them until they just start to turn brown...drain on paper towels then crumble into soup! No guilt crunchy noodles!

I have always wanted to learn how to make Egg Drop Soup. This is my soup to sip on while I have an upset stomach. This is a very easy and quick recipe to whip up. 
    The only thing that was changed was I added all eggs minus the egg yoke. And added pepper to taste.

Made this today and liked it very much.  Needs scallions for texture and crunch and could be a little thicker.  Used homemade broth made with some star anise which added extra flavor.  Very good, quick and low calorie.

I've made this quite a few times and we love it.  It's nice to have something you can throw together quickly in a pinch.  I added some rice noodles and peas last time and it tasted strikingly similar to Ramen.  Lol.

I liked it. It was simple and fast. Buuut I put in about 1/2 the amount of the cornstarch mixture, and I could taste it. Would have preferred it without any of the mixture. Egg Drop Soup is normally runny anyways!

Delicious! I did not have ginger on hand so I substituded with garlic. I would love to try it with ginger though.  Also, for added nutrients, I put in about 1 cup of mixed vegetables. This recipe is just what I was looking for. Thanks for the post!

Not a bad recipe to start with, but it's a little plain. I added 2tbsp of salt and 1tsp of curry powder & cayenne. Really brought out the flavor.

My Chinese exchange student declared this to taste just like at home!  I omitted the ginger because I didn't realize until too late that I was out.  Also, as other reviewers suggested, I added the eggs last.  Perfect!

Excellent. The easiest, most delicious soup I've made. I didn't use ginger because I'm allergic, and I added 1/2 tsp of sesame oil. Otherwise followed to a T. Tastes delicious!

I tried this recipe then i tried it with the additions that MSFURIOUS1 added. Much more flavor. Great job with this. I was wondering why my eggs were coming out fluffy. Adding cornstarch mixed with broth to thicken the broth worked like a charm. Thanks. I love this site.

This was perfect!  I did follow other suggestions by adding green onions, white pepper, and a splash of soy sauce.  I also whisked 3 whole eggs with a tablespoon of water.   I could have done better with adding the egg at a slower rate as I did have some chunks but else it was perfect.  This has been added to my recipe box!

Very good soup. Made as stated and my teenagers had a great snack after school. I made ahead of time and then kept it in a slow cooker on warm while I was at work, so all they had to do is scoop and enjoy. 
I will be adding this to my soups to make!

Very simple and easy to make. Corn starch is not necessary, however, if you want a more healthy soup. You can also just do egg whites. I added peas and diced carrots to mine for minimal nutritional value aside protein. Personally, I added carrots before adding eggs so I knew they would be fulled cooked by the time I was starving to eat the entire pot to myself. Also increased quantity to 6c of broth because I think 4 just isn't enough if you want it for left overs again next-day.

Very easy to make, tastes great, but seems like it's missing something. I added peas and a little soy sauce in mine. My husband, who normally doesn't like egg drop, ate most of the pot by himself :) thank you for posting this one.

DELICIOUS!!  This is absolutely beyond a doubt resturant style.  My family is so picky about Egg Drop Soup that if it doesn't taste good at the resturants we go to, we don't eat there again.  Thanks for the recipe, it's the best!!

This is my favorite recipe for Egg Drop Soup.  Quick and easy.   Very close to what I order in the restaurant.  Only change I made is, add more chives.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent base for a egg drop soup and i agree with a lot of the reviewers here, there is something missing I can't quite figure out. I added some crumbled dried seaweed I got from an Asian market and it was delicous.

Good if a bit bland for my tastes. I didn't have chives but I added fresh ginger, garlic, a dash of Chinese 5-spice, soy sauce and oyster sauce and subbed onion for chives as I didn't have any. I also garnished with baby bok choy and fresh cilantro, and added a bit of sriracha. It became more of a meal after I added udon noodles I cooked in a separate pan.

It was okay, I had to add soy sauce, rice vinegar, and white pepper to flavor it up.  Great base recipe though.  I also added more cornstarch to get the consistency I was looking for.  I would make it again with the changes. I also followed the reviews by adding the eggs last.  Good idea.

Excellent!  However, I did not have ginger,so I had to sub something.  I fine sliced some celery,and garlic.  Super fine.   Not much- 2small cloves and 1 med piece of celery,(cut lengthwise to 4 sections then cut diag into little pieces) Add it to the boiling broth. I also subbed with mushroom soy sauce.  To taste.  I also added the cornstarch mix before the egg mix, as another person suggested.   Within a minute of adding the egg,  I had a soup that was soo good.  I have never had good results with egg drop soup until today. I am rating this soup as I'm eating it!  This one is a keeper.  Thanks,                           Joe

I have been using Allrecipes for years but after trying this receipe I *had* to officially register and comment.  I really loved this receipe.  It was on the salty side, my only complaint but that is easily fixed.  Personally, the ginger is what makes it authentic.  I also added the eggs after thickening.  Great recipe, thanks!

As a college student, I am always looking for inexpensive and easy recipes. This one was a hit!  I can make a big batch and store it for days I don't feel like cooking and when people come over I can make this for a crowd and not have to worry about cost. The only change I make is that I add water to it, I find that without watering it down it is too salty for my personal taste. Several people have asked me for the recipe after trying it, and are amazed when they find out how easy and quick this is. Definitely a keeper.

Very easy and cheap to make. If you use chicken bullion like I did, leave out the salt. I had to dilute my soup with an additional 2 cups of water just to lighten the sauce. Next time I'll add mushrooms and frozen peas/corn for an extra color.

Had the right texture of egg drop soup and looked just like the chinesse restaurant soup when I was done, but didn't seem to taste quite as good.  Still tasted great, but seemed like it needed something a little more since it was on the bland side.

This was ok. We ate it with no problem just adding white peper at the table which I would do at a Chinese restaurant as well.  Howerver it was lacking a depth of flavor...I just couldn't put my finger on what it was missing. Took other's thoughts and used sesame oil to saute fresh garlic and ginger then added the remaining ingredients. Maybe a different chicken broth? It was tasty, just kinda flat for me. I think I'll try a different chicken broth next time.

Easy and tasty! I also, added the cornstarch mixture before adding the egg. I also added frozen peas and carrots. And some white pepper. I used a bit more of the scallions too. Over all, super easy to make and simply delicious. I even have leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

Scaled this recipe to yield 2 servings. Based on reviewers' notes, I used 2 whole eggs vs 1 egg + 1/2 egg yolk, also added 1/4 tsp sesame oil and 1/8 tsp ground white pepper. I also followed these important techniques shared by reviewers: Thicken the soup first before adding the beaten eggs. Stir the thickened soup in one direction and bring to a boil then immediately remove the saucepan from heat. Add the beaten eggs in a slow steady stream and LET IT COOK UNDISTURBED for about 3 to 5 mins. Thanks for this recipe! Thank you also for the helpful reviews! :-)

First off I didn't add any extra salt and I was really happy with this recipe, it taste great and is really easy to make. I love egg drop soup and now I don't have to go to a restaurant to get it! I followed the advice posted by others and added the egg AFTER the cornstarch+ broth was added and took the soup off the heat before adding the eggs.

Very Good. A bit on the salty side. The extra salt is not needed. By omitting some salt this would be a 5 star recipe. **edit** If you put your mixed eggs in a fine strainer and let drizzle over the boiling soup base, this will give you a very fine perfect consistancy. I also add the corn starch 'before' putting the egg in.

The kids liked this. It seemed to have a lot of egg in it.  I ended up thinning it out a little. Didn't use the scallions or ginger for the kids.

I was delightfully surprised! I had to change a few things: I left out the ginger and salt because I don't care for ginger and chicken broth is so salty already. I also took another users advice and added the cornstarch mixture before adding the egg... worked fine. I also only used one tablespoon of cornstarch because I don't like this soup too thick.

Good, not great.  The broth was a little lacking in flavor.  Perhaps my Chinese restaurant makes phenomenal egg drop soup.

1. I had to tweek this A lot. I am giving it 4 stars only because i did use veggie broth instead of chicken broth... 2. I ended up adding 2 chicken bullion cubes to it and about 1 T soy sauce. i also added a little chicken to it and let it boil i prefer it that way... will keep looking for the perfect one.

Yummy, I added gravy thickiner before the eggs as many sugggested, and I would just stick to using 2 eggs would have been plenty. Overall very yummy and very easy. Will be making many more times.

This was really great! It was a lot easier than I imagined it to be! The only change I will make in the future is to add some sliced or shredded carrots. Then this will be just as great as my local chinese resturants!

I make this often, and it doesn't take long. I use 4 chicken bullion cubes instead of the chicken broth, and I've not tried cornstarch, only flour. The flavor is good, and it's very filling. Thanks!

This is a perfectly fabulous recipe as written; however, for the second go-round, I used extra chives & extra egg whites for more intense flavor & texture.

Tastes like the good chinese restaurants!  I added of combination frozen peas, corn, and carrots.  I think I stirred the eggs too much, it looked more like a cream soup then ribbons of eggs.

I changed the recipe up a little to include the cabbage, carrots, and 5 green onions. It was great. I do not recommend using the ginger or pepper, it was too spicy for my kids. If you like spicy foods keep the spices in, otherwise, I wouldn't include them. Other than that, this was THE BEST egg drop soup, tasted just like a restaurants!

Was a great hit. I did add a tsp. of hot sauce. mmmmm. It was a Louisiana type. Very good w/ the ginger. Also added boiled,shredded, seasoned chicken with which I had made the broth(spiced w/ celery,carrots,onion, garlic, and bay leaf). My hard to please nephew's FAVORITE. And he HATES eggs and boiled chicken

This recipe is VERY bland.  It needs something but what I'm not sure.  Maybe add some white rice, corn and some new spices.  It's a good base but that's about it.

I suppose this was a good base recipe, but, it would need a lot of work before I would make it again. I am used to having Egg Drop Soup with cabbage and carrots and sometimes pead or mushrooms in it. So, I thought the consistancy was off. Also, I thought you could add another can of broth for the amount of thickener this called for. I added a few spices as well. Fresh grated garlic (to help fight off my husband's cold), a shake of red pepper flakes, ground mustard and onion powder. I would make this again, but, with some changes! Thanks!

The reviewers were right about when to add the eggs,I knew something went wrong when I dropped them in there.Still it didn't matter to me, it still looked good and tasted great!I had only dried chives and used 1 tablespoon of them-was very good,but missing a tiny bit of something.Did not taste exactly like the restraunt kind but, very close.This soup was easy,fast and tasty!Also I already had all the ingredients at home,didn't have to go spend a fortune.

SO YUMMY! I found that it tastes even MORE like restaurant style if you use 1/2 chicken broth and 1/2 vegetable broth. Add some green onions, peas and water chestnuts and you are good to go! Excellent recipe and so EASY!

Excellent & so easy!  I used freeze-dried chives, because that's what I had.  I only reserved about 1/3 cup of the broth for the cornstarch mixture, as I didn't want to waste the broth if the soup thickened before I used it all. The consistency was perfect using the amount called for the recipe, though.  Thanks so much!

This recipe tasted exactly like the local Chinese restaurants egg drop soup.  Outstanding!  I will definetly make again.  I need to practice getting the egg cooked to the consistancy that we like.

Very good and authentic  AND easy.  I didn't have any chicken broth, so I substituted powdered bullion, and it worked just fine.  I also added a bit more cornstarch and white pepper.

This was really great! I made it as suggested, and dropped the eggs last. During the boiling phase, I added some peas, which added some nice green color and flavor!

I was looking for a homemade version of this soup to make for my family and boy did I find it! This was awesome. I did make a few changes however, I halved the recipe just to try for a quick and easy lunch so keep that in mind when I give quantities. I used 2 cups broth(better than bouillion brand) 2 eggs, a pinch or less of salt 1 Tbsp cornstarch and about 1/2 cup frozen mixed veggies(not traditional I know but I wanted to add a little nutrition and substance) Also I used about 1 tsp of fresh grated ginger instead of ground. I also thickened before I added egg and it is fabulous. I am going to have a hard time saving some for my daughter to try(one of her favs!) Next time I will use some green onion or chives also(I was out!) Definitely try this one!!

Well I left out the ginger because quite frankly, ginger and my stomach don't mix.  Everything else tasted just fine though.  I had no idea Egg Drop soup was this easy to make.  Thanks so much.  I will make this again.

I also added chopped shitake mushrooms and some Asian hot sauce (don't know the brand, but we call it Chicken Sauce because it has a rooster on the bottle). My boyfriend loved it.

Very good base soup.  I made a few changes and had a super wonderful meal -

1.  Sauted two chopped scallions
2. When the scallion turned translucent, added 1 teaspoon of garlic and a 1 teaspoon of ginger
3.   Sauted for a few minutes and then added a little bit of red chile powder and a little bit of lemon zest
5 Then followed the recipe above.

This was a good base for egg drop soup but was seriously lacking in flavor...I plan to make it again but this time will add soy sauce, fresh garlic, and some red pepper flakes for a little kick, maybe even a little chinese mustard, Thanks for a great start, will experiment more and post my modifications for other reviewers to try if they'ld like

Loved it so much.  I have been trying out new recipes lately and this one is one of the favorites.  My husband loved it.  And so did my 2 little guys.  I always try to find recipes that they enjoy too.  Who knew good Chinese food could be so easy?!  Thank you for the great recipe, I will be adding this one to my recipe box so I can make it again and again.

I followed the suggestions from the rating and it's PHENOMENAL!  The only thing missing are those noodles they have at the restaurant.  I tried some I found but they're not the same!

Yum! Yum!

I have made this recipe 5 times in the last 2 months.  It is quick and easy and really tastes great!  It's also inexpensive.  The only changes I made are to add sliced mushrooms for additional substance, and I use white pepper.  Great Recipe!!!

Like others, I followed the guidance of MSFURIOUS1 and used 3 whole eggs and 1 yolk. I used chicken bouillion instead of broth/stock and had no issues. This was fantastic.

Great! Made this for our "Chinese Take Out" night at home. The whole family loved it, even the picky 3 year old! I left out the green onions for my husband, and it tasted like something was missing. Will definetely add them to my bowl next time! :) This recipe is Very easy and Very good!

I loved it. But I love Egg drop soup.  Simple and yummy!  My husband not as big of a fan, but he did say, as far as egg drop soup goes, he thought it was pretty good.  I will definitely make this again!  If only for myself!

This was really good, tasted better then most restaurants.  I added some sesame oil at the end and while it was in the bowl I added some soy sauce from left over take out packets.  Also my eggs blended w/ the soup instead of becoming ribbons but overall it tasted good and will make again.

This was ok, but it is definitely important to go easy on the salt.  I don't recommend adding any more than what is already present in the chicken broth.

Very good!  I added soy sauce when I put the chives and ginger in to give it more flavor.  The eggs did get a little puffy, so adding the cornstarch first would work better.

I mixed the first reviewers recipe and this one.  It was good, but something didn't taste right.  I need to just make this recipe with no changes.

I thought this was much too bland.  I added  much more green onions and even garlic powder.  The texture of the soup and egg were great though.  It just was missing something... some spice.

This is a really good recipe but I think it could use some tweaking.  Green onions would be better than chives.  I don't think the salt is necessary and if the soup does taste like it needs salt then I think soy sauce should be added.  Thanks for sharing.

Very easy to make, and the flavor was great. I think I whisked the eggs a little too much once in the chicken broth but the flavor was still wonderful.

Thanks reviewers for the tip about adding the corn starch before the egg, it turned out pretty well.  I didn't have any ginger but had crushed garlic and added a teeny bit of sesame oil to give it more of that restaurant taste.  Will tweak some more to get it to taste right.

Followed recipe as listed but this soup did not live up to it's title.  My family loves egg drop soup but this tasted just like thickened chicken broth with egg added, nothing like any restaurant's soup we've had.  Will not make again.

Definitely substitute green onions for chives.  I'm not really sure how chives wound up in the ingredients list considering the picture shows green onions.  With the appropriate substitution, this is very good!  Served this with Crab Rangoon III and Chicken Stir-Fry and it made quite the meal.

Great the way it is. Only made two small changes from reading the reviews. One:I added the cornstarch first to give the egg a thinner texture. Two: omitted the egg yolk.

I had to make several adjustments to this recipe because it didn't have too much flavor on its own. I added two cans of peas, one can of corn, garlic powder, onion powder, onions, 2T butter, and pepper. I also mixed in some instant mashed potato flakes to the boiling soup as well as about 1 cup of leftover scalloped potatoes. The end result was something like chicken corn soup without the chicken.

Good flavor.  Pretty easy.  My sister commented that it wasn't as salty as traditional egg drop soup.  I didn't have chicken broth, so I used water and chicken boulion instead.

This hit the spot.  I used homemade  vegetable broth since we're vegetarian and it tasted very similar to what I remember egg drop soup tasting like.  I really think the quality of the soup hinges on the quality of the broth you use.  Obviously, canned broth will not taste as rich as homemade or even higher end broths.  I doubled the ginger (personal preference), omitted the salt and added 2T of tamari (my broth had no salt in it).  I hate wasting, so next time I will use three whole eggs.  I don't think one extra white would make a huge difference.  I paired this with a mixed salad and ginger dressing.  It was a great light dinner.

It wasn't a bad soup, but it didn't taste anything like egg drop soup from any restuarant I've ever been to.  We were really disappointed.  It just tasted like chicken soup with some egg in it.

Excellent Recipe! I now come up with other Asian dishes for dinner just so that I can make this soup to go with it!  I took the advice of other reviewers and added my cornstarch before the eggs.  I have also added a bouillon cube to the broth to give it some extra flavor.

We liked the consistency and underlying flavor of this soup. It was very salty when I made it, though, so perhaps taste the broth before adding additional salt!

This soup was excellent. My husband had requested that I make egg drop soup sometime. I tried this recipe and he was very impressed. I added cubed chicken. I also ommited the salt, and used half reduced sodium chicken broth. I am very glad that I ommitted the salt, becuase it would have been way too salty. I also think that next time I will only use reduced sodium broth. 

This one is a keeper!

I really enjoyed how easy this was to make, but was disappointed that it really just tasted like chicken bouillon, wiith egg mixed in.  The next time I want egg drop soup, I would probably just buy the mix for a more unique taste.

Delicious! I didn't add as much cornstarch as the recipe called for as I like my egg drop a bit thin, but I did add corn to it and it was perfect!

Pretty good but not the best I've had.  I only used 2 eggs and we all found the soup quite eggy enough.  I used chopped green onions rather than chives; that flavor is more appropriate to me...

This soup was very simple to prepare and quite good. I doubled the recipe (using scallion tops instead of chives and 2 slices of fresh gingerroot) and had some for lunch. At dinnertime, I added a cup of frozen early peas and 1/2 package of sliced, firm Tofu . My husband and 2 sons literally devoured it; not a drop was left. (Use Vegetable broth instead of Chicken to make it Vegetarian. This recipe is very economical, and Diabetic friendly. I believe it would be excellent with chicken pieces or carrots added, too.)

Having no previous experience trying egg drop soup, this tasted great. I followed this recipe to a "T". However, I wish I would have added the cornstarch before the eggs as other reviews mentioned so the eggs would be ribbons and not puffy clumps. Regardless, this was a great soup.

This was VERY similar to restaurant, but it was MUCH better.  I have always found our local restaurant's to fatty.  This was very pleasing!  Even my youngest son who hates eggs LOVED it!  A+++

A very nice egg drop soup, I thought it was a bit too salty -probably because I used bullion- and had too much egg in it - but my husband thought it was great and my utmost picky 7 year old gobbled it down - minus the chives. I will make again.

This recipe was awesome! I changed it up a bit, though, and added some peas, corn, and carrots from the frozen isle just like my favorite restaurant did, and it was fantastic! This recipe is definately a keeper. I added ground pepper and soy sauce to taste.

This was just very average.  It wasn't nearly as good as soup from a restaurant.  And since it's so cheap (and a lot tastier) to order soup from a chinese place, I would probably not make it again.

I used green onion, rather than chives, because that is what I had on hand.  This is a simple little soup and would make a nice starter to an Asian meal.  We just had it as a quick, light, hot lunch item before heading out on a long walk on this cold brisk day!  Thanks for the recipe, WJ Cory!

This was perfection. I no longer have to drive to China town for my favourite soup, I can make it. I used the low sodium chicken broth, used green onions instead of chives and added some oyster mushrooms. I added the cornstarch before the egg and added also a dollop of sesame oil to finish it off. Some low sodium soya sauce and everything is set to go.

I made this for my 5-yr old for something different, as he loves chicken noodle soup.  He LOVED it and so did I!  I followed the recipe as written, except for adding a dash of white pepper and a splash of Soy Sauce.  Next time, I will probably add MORE broth and MORE cornstarch to thicken it up more. Thank you :)

Absolutely wonderful! I am so surprised that this recipe comes so close to the egg drop soup we get at our favorite Chinese restaurant. Really easy to make, as well. I followed the recipe exactly except I used the green part of a leek instead of the chives, and I added some black pepper at the end. I might cut down the salt next time, but this soup is amazing.

Wonderful basic recipe.
I did add the cornstarch before the eggs, and I increased it as well.
We just prefer a bit thicker soup.
I also dashed some sesame oil into it at the end for flavor.  Great Recipe !!

Put away all those other recipes!  This is your winner!  A fabulous egg drop soup, that is requested frequently by my husband as one of his favorite dinners.  If you use organic ingredients, the taste is even better.  I use just a touch extra organic ground ginger, organic chicken stock concentrate with water, and omit the salt.

This was certainly the best homemade egg drop soup that I've ever had.  The only change I made was to add some corn, since that's what they do at my favorite restaurant.  I've made single servings of this for myself a couple of times, and I plan to do so many more.  Thanks!

I was really hoping to taste a soup that was out of this world.  I think it's got some potential, but, it lacked in flavors and one was salt.  I needed to add a ton of salt and there is still something missing, but can't put my finger on it.  I did add a little soy sauce.  Might make again since there aren't any others to really go by, but will have to figure something out to add to get that authentic flavor I am looking for.

This soup is easy to make.  It just doesn't have any flavor.  I had to add several spices etc. to even get it close to what I am use to eating at my favorite restaurant.

Easy and delicious!  I'm a vegetarian, so I substituted vegetable broth for the chicken broth.  My husband raved and  thought it was very authentic.

I wouldn't say it was restaurant style, but it was pretty good. I didn't have any chicken broth, so I used 4 chicken buillion cubes instead. My husband said it was good, but a little salty. I thought it had too much egg and not enough broth. Next time, I will add an extra cup of broth. Other than that, it was pretty good.

Very good!  Easily as good, if not better, than most restaurants.  I added a few thinly, thinly sliced mushrooms to the top of each bowl and found that the addition of white pepper was a must.
We loved it!

It took less than 15 minutes from start to finish and it was delicious.  I might not add the onions till the last step, because they stay greener that way.  Otherwise, it was perfect.

An excellent soup, I had no chives, but I added a little bit of crushed ginger and garlic, parsley, and it turned out fantastic. My husband and I will defenitely be making this regularly.

This was wonderful.  I added cubed tofu and green onions with the chives.  Fantastic flavor.  I also used reduced sodium broth and salted to taste at the end.  Will be a staple in our house!

terrific! I added some fresh chopped spinach and silken tofu. I also only used two eggs, and it was still enough egg taste with less cholesterol. Great recipe!

The flavor was excellent and just what I was looking for. But I couldn't get it to thicken up like I wanted. Next time I will try thickening the soup first, and then dropping in the egg.

Awesome soup! GREAT flavor!  I would recommend using REAL chicken broth as I think it always makes such a difference!  This soup freezes amazingly well!  I froze in serving size containers! I will make a double batch next time!

This soup was excellent.  I added one crushed garlic clove and did half vegetable broth.  The broth I used was too salty--I'll keep it in mind for the next time.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent soup!! I made the mistake of adding frozen peas and matchstick-sliced carrots to it, and that didn't turn out so well, but my picky husband ate the entire pot anyway! I doubled the recipe but forgot to double the eggs (LOL) and it still came out PLENTY eggy! It was very, very good! A touch salty, but we like salty things anyway, so it was great for us! Next time, I think I will add peas, but not carrots -- they were very overcooked by the time I was done dropping the egg.

i really like this.  i double the ginger, and add some garlic.  i also added the cornstarch to the liquid before the eggs. If you want something with a bit more texture, toss in some mung sprouts. Freezes really well.

I like this recipe better if I use green onions instead of chives--more flavor--and if I put a bit of the salt into the eggs themselves.  With those variations, my husband is always happy and I get to make an easy, yummy meal.

A SPECTACULAR and EXTREMELY EASY to make soup!  My whole family (which includes kids under 10) absolutely ate every last bit!  We picked up some shrimp chips from the store, and WOW - it was really a great soup!  I will definately be making this again!

I personally had nothing to compare this to as I don't eat a lot of Chinese food.  I had a hard time eating the egg part of the soup because they felt slimey.  Now, my fiance on the other hand loves Chinese, and said this was an almost exact match to what you would get in a Chinese Restaurant.  It's very hard to cook Chinese food for him at home because it never seems to come close.  I will make this again for him, because he loved it and it's so easy!!! You might want to increase the recipe, though, if it's something the whole family is going to eat.  He managed to eat all of the soup in one sitting with the exception of the small bowl I had for myself.  Also, cut back or eliminate the salt.  The chicken broth is salty enough!

This was GREAT!!!!!  My husband said he liked it even more than the resturant version.  I will use this over and over.  I do like ginger so i added a little extra.

This is an excellant egg drop soup recipe! I have always bought the mix stuff just because I never thought about making it from scratch but it is juat as easy from scratch and better tasting.i used two whole eggs instead of omitting the one yolk and it was fine.

Thanks for the great recipe

Excellent!  I used scallions instead of chives and took the advice of another reviewer and thickened the soup before dropping the eggs in.  It came out perfect.  My family loved it.
