This was a pain in the neck to make but was absolutely delicious. My husband complained I made a healthy food unhealthy with the addition of potatoes and cheese, but he seeemed to have no better luck than me at leaving the table!  I would reccomend using a large non stick Dutch oven.  I used a stainless saute pan and had to keep waiting for the kale to decrease in volume before I could add more.  I was afraid all the spices were stuck to the bottom of the pan and there would be no spices left for the kale, but this was loaded with flavor and truely unique.

Delicious! A great way to use kale. I got a little sack of red potatoes in my CSA basket, and had bought a big bag of kale that say, too. I had a feeling kale and potatoes would be good together, so I looked for recipes using both.I reduced the amount of curry powder just a tad, and I'm glad I did. I meant to add cayenne pepper but forgot. I don't miss it even though I like spicy food. My only complaint is the amount of butter. I thought this was too fatty overall, and will adjust the butter and oil amounts in the future. Great recipe, thanks! EDIT: I made this again, but forgot to check my previous review and used the full amount of butter. still too much, lol! definitely reduce the butter unless you want it pooling in the bottom of the pan (waste of butter). I used a mandolin slicer and yellow potatoes so I didn't have to peel. I used some nice aged white cheddar for the topping. The diections don't say to cover while baking, but I found mine cooked perfectly and right on time with it covered, and only uncovered for the cheese to bubble and brown. This recipe is so cheap and so easy!!

Very tasty. I had spinach so substituted one large bunch of spinach for the kale. I only used 2 of the 3 potatoes. You don't have to be precise about the spices.

Made this as a main course tonight and it was amazing! I used about 8 small potatoes and sliced on the mandolin. A large bunch of kale wilted down to only enough for one layer, so potatoes, kale, potatoes, and cheese. Used a lot more curry powder, about 2 tablespoons. I could see adding in some sauteed mushrooms and chickpeas next time, but this was really awesome as is. Thanks for the recipe, I'll be making this again shortly!

This turned out pretty good. I think the reviews on it being too much butter depends on how much potatoes you use. "3 potatoes" is pretty subjective. I ended up using 4, two of which I would consider extra large. Made 3 layers of potatoes in 9x13 pan. Came out perfect. I think the recipe needs some salt and pepper added. Maybe just sprinkle on the potato layers as they are being added. I ended up using green beans instead of kale since that's what needed used up from our garden share.With only potatoes and one veggie, it seems lacking as a meal. And I got to thinking, you know what would be great in this? Some ground beef! And some carrots. Maybe mushrooms.  A very versatile dish that I will play around with.

I just made this today for lunch.  It was easy to make and turned out really well.  I didn't bother to melt the butter, I just dotted the top with about 2 Tbs of butter and I didn't add the cheese.  I served mine with a spoonful of plain yogurt, which I really liked.  My 7 year old daughter ate hers with ranch dressing...kids are so weird...and loved it.  I like what the other reviewers said about maybe adding chickpeas for protein next time.  It has only been an hour and a half since lunch and I'm hungry again...could just be me though...maybe the cheese would have kept me satisfied longer.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious! I used 1 T. butter and 3 T. whole milk to deglaze the kale pan, then poured that over. I also added 3 crumbled pieces of bacon to the top to tempt my husband, who went back for seconds!

Loved this!!! I used 2 bunches of kale and topped with provolone cheese at the end. Make sure your potatoes are nicely browned on the top before you put your cheese on. Delicious and easy!!

My husband and I loved this recipe!  It was easy to put together, and had a wonderful blend of flavors.  You can't go wrong on the amount of potatoes or kale - adjust to what you have.  The first night we served it with grilled pork chops.  We had half left over, which we had a few nights later with spicy meatloaf.  It definitely went better with the pork.  The spices in the meatloaf and this dish didn't compliment each other.  I will definitely make this again, and serve with either chicken or pork on the side.  I initially tried this recipe because I had kale to use up.  Now, I'll buy kale especially for this recipe!

Made a few changes - used leek instead of onion, added more cheese, and because I had it, I used some celeriac in it. I've made it a few times, this is delicious and quite open to some minor variation. I also prefer fresh ginger instead of the spice. I agree that 1/4 cup of butter is too much.  I used less the second time.

This recipe is a good one. The flavor combination of the tumeric and the curry powder gave an interesting flavor to the dish, and with the potatoes it was actually a pretty hearty meal. My modifications were: I added 1 can of drained and rinsed garbanzo beans in with the kale and that made it even more filling. I also did not use cheese as a topper. I also forgot to add the salt and pepper... note: salt and pepper in this dish is important! I just added it later on a per serving basis, but I'll definitely be sure to add it in next time. I'd also recommend using an extra potato (or at least have an extra one on hand) so that you can make denser layers of the potato if you want. With a butter substitute and no cheese, this is a great vegan dish to have in your pocket.

I was skeptical about the cheese topping but this recipe was great!  I followed another reviewers suggestion to use cold butter and that made it even easier.  Will absolutely make again!

It is rare that I try a recipe where I don't want to change a thing.  This is one.  It is perfect.  Everyone knows Kale is so good for you and now I have a favorite kale recipe.

Wonderful! I followed the recipe as written, except that I used 10 oz. of frozen kale instead of fresh, used grated fresh ginger instead of dry, and I reduced the butter to about 2 TBSP. I will definitely add this one to my repertoire!

This is delicious!  I left the cheese out because I don't eat it.  What a wonderful and different way to enjoy kale.  My whole family loved it!  Thank you for the recipes.

Really liked this. Never sure how to use kale and I came across this recipe. The seasonings were great and it all combined so nicely. Love my potatoes so I might as well make them a little healthier!

I have made this twice, the first time I did it exactly as written and loved it! My hubby was not crazy about the flavor so the second time I made it I omitted the curry, my other guests loved it but my husband still wasn't a fan. I think this is a great recipe, the second time I tried to make it ahead by par boiling my potatoes then slicing and assembling. This worked fairly well some of the insides of the potatoes still browned a bit but it cooked well.

this is excellent! The only thing I did diffrently was to use fresh ginger saute'd with the onion and garlic. I think the cheese odd but really is a nice touch.

I was a little skeptical, especially with the cheese addition.  I don't think of cheddar cheese going with curry.  But the recipe was surprisingly good, though I thought with WAY too much curry.  I will use less next time and likely add some beans- lentils seem a likely choice- for added protein.

Loved this. Followed the advice of others and reduced the butter to about 2 Tbl + a little olive oil.  Added a second garlic clove too.  Used a mandolin to make thin layers and layered in an oval Dutch oven.  Melted the butter and oil in the pan that had the curried veggies to get absorb more of the spices and porued over the layers. Baked with lid on for 30 minutes, added cheese, baked 10 minutes more with lid on, finally removed lid and baked for about 5 more minutes. This was a HUGE hit and definitely will make it again and again.

Surprisingly good (but with less butter and curry). It hit the spot as a vegetarian main dish.  I added more cheese this time but probably won’t next time.  I adjusted for a half recipe, used approximately 3/4 tsp of curry and no turmeric. I also used about half the amount of butter and might cut that down still more next time and use a pastry brush to very lightly cover the top layer of potatoes — the butter does make a difference in the deliciously crispy top layer.  I used only one humongous russet potato, unpeeled and sliced pretty thin with a sharp knife, so I got only a top and bottom layer. I put half the cheese over the kale layer and adding the rest as suggested. Next time I will increase the amount of kale, or add some other vegetables, and will try the recommended amount of cheese.

Yes, I made changes.  Not a bunch of kale, about 2 cups raw, 1 cup steamed before addition.  1 c blanched broccoli from my freezer.  1 Lg. Carrot sliced on cheese grater, only 2 Potatoes sliced on cheese grater.  1 Cup of cheese after full cooking in last 5 minutes (covered).
Further Additions:  2 Large Oven Roasted Portabella Mushrooms sliced & diced.  
Review After Tasting: By my own standards it was rather dull.  Much more spice and UMPF needed.

This was a tasty casserole style dish.  The curry/turmeric flavors were not predominant, perhaps my bunch of kale was larger than most.  I'll adjust the spices accordingly next time. Chopped the onion and garlic in the food processor in under a minute prior to sauteeing, and then used the slicing disc to slice up the potatoes (unpeeled, but scrubbed) - which made the prep work easier.  I did increase the garlic and potatoes (as my red potatoes were small), reduced the butter to 1Tbsp and added about 1/4 cup of (coffee) cream.  Instead of the optional cheddar cheese topping, I added a light layer of crumbled feta.  That worked well, and I'll likely add feta within the layers next time I make this.  Crumbled bacon would also be fabulous in this!  Comfort food as our cooler Fall evenings approach!  I served this with grilled chicken thighs,  roasted red peppers, steamed carrots and green beans.  Thank you for sharing!

I read some of the reviews and reduced the butter to 3 TBS instead of 4.  It did not have butter pooled in the bottom and was not too greasy.  The recipe is unclear on the type of kale and they range from medium to huge in size. I just had to hope my green kale would work. It did! Lacinato kale would be too much unless you want thick layers of kale. I used red potatoes because that’s what I had and I did not peel them. The kale comes out soft and crispy on the edges and top.  Curry mixture is perfect, not too spicy but enough to season the entire dish. This is so good I jhad to write a review, which I do not usually do. Kudos to the recipe creator!  I will make this for the family and friends now that I tested it.

Everyone in the family liked it& most of us aren't the biggest kale fans. I made just one kale mixture later in the middle& was extra generous with the kale. Because this was a bigger than 9x13 pan, using 4 very large potatoes, I did use the full 1/4 c butter. Next time I would cut than down by quarter or third. And, I'd add some garlic salt to the layers. Otherwise, it was delicious. I used exactly the amount of spices called for & everyone said 'make this again '. We had this with the cheesy kale muffins.

I am eating my first try at this recipe and I love it. I added fenugreek seeds and cilantro stems. I used my food processor to slice potatoes and onions to cut down on prep time.

Tasty! I added more curry and garlic and it turned out great. I may half the butter next time to be a bit healthier.

We have an abundance of kale from our garden. Wanted to try something new and this was it. Made it exactly as given and the entire family raved about it.

That was interesting. I made it without the tumeric because I had none and it tasted very good! Suprised the curry went so well with cheese. Who would have known??? I think it would be a great dish with other veggies as well... throw in some brocolli or mushrooms. Yum. Thanks.

I love this recipe. I don't peel the potatoes and I slice them with the mandolin, so that part is easy. And I use 2 bunches of kale instead of one.

The thing is getting it to cook all the way through without burning the top. I put aluminum foil on top and weigh the whole thing down with another pan on top (which makes everything nice and flat); then at the last couple minutes I take the foil off and add the cheese. This keeps the top from getting all burny. Serve with a big salad or rice pilaf.

I loved it! I didn't add cheese due to being lactose intolerant. I used I can't believe it's not butter instead of butter. I also used red potatoes. Turned out great!

Way too much butter!  I followed this recipe exactly and found that 1/4 cup melted butter was far too much.  It was very greasy.  Also, I would double the kale next time.

I had no expectations and was blown away! I made it exactly as written, using my own homemade curry powder. My only change will be to add one more potato. I don't want to know the number of fat grams, I'll just eat it for breakfast so I'll have all day to compensate!

Very good.  My husband and I both loved.  I reduced the curry in half.  My cooking time was closer to an hour.  I  used about 5 potatoes and a large back of Kale.  I ended up with several layers. Can't wait to have left overs tomorrow.

This was an easy dish to make.  I made it as a main dish and my husband and I thought it was just OK.  Definitely more of a side dish- but nothing that would make me want to make it again.

Whoa, this was awesome. Both husband and daughter LOVED it. Only complaint was that I didn't make a second. If you plan to make this your meal, consider doing just that. It went real fast.
