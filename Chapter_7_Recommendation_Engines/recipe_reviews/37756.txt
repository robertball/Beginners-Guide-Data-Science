My husband loves cheese bread like you order from the pizza place, but he is not much of a pizza fan.  This recipe is perfect for him.  It was almost as good as the cheese bread you get when you order pizza.  I will make again for sure.

Excellent variation and great accompaniment to pasta dishes.  Extra easy.  I tripled the butter, cheese and seasonings and keep it in the fridge
so the boys can make a quick snack of it anytime they want.

Super simple, and addicting!  A great change from typical garlic bread.

This made a nice addition to our Italian meal, but it just wasn't fantastic.  Usually my brother loves any type of Italian/garlic bread with his spaghetti, but this didn't do much for him.  Tastes good though.

Thank you, Kraft, for an easy and tasty accompaniment for soups, salads and main dishes. We love it. I use Swiss and Monterrey Jack rather than Mozzarella. They seem more flavorful than Mozzarella.

This was great!  My kids (6&7) really enjoyed it.  I will also try a packet of of Hidden Valley Ranch instead of the Italian seasoning.  Instead of grated cheese I used sliced mozzarella cheese.  YUM!

A little salty but still very good! Very easy and went well with dinner. I didn't mix the cheese in with the butter spread but rather, just sprinkled a little over each slice. Was enjoyed by everyone and would make these again!

This recipe is easy to prepare and delicious.  My wife, the one that doesn't care much for bread, had five pieces!  I cut individual slices of 3/4 inches or so, from end to end and instead of using the broiler, I baked the bread on 350 for 10 minutes or so (I was using the oven for another dish).  I recommend this recipe highly.  The packet of spices (Italian Salad Dressing Mix) could probably be approximated from a well stocked spice rack--rather than making a special trip to the store for the packet.

I kinda messed this one up.  In recipes that call for cheddar cheese, I normally replace regular cheddar for fat-free with wonderful results...so I figured I should try it with mozzarella as well.  BIG MISTAKE!!  Fat-free mozzarella tastes AWFUL!!  :(   I think this bread would have been fantastic with regular cheese...unfortunatley, I can't afford that much fat in my diet  :(   So, definitley try this recipe, but definitley do NOT use fat-free cheese!!

Pretty good, but a little, um rich or something.  I wouldn't want to eat much.  I like the idea of trying Hidden Valley Ranch.  And to RedRobyn -- I use fat-free cheddar also, but discovered over 10 years ago that fat-free mozzarella just doesn't cut it. :-)  The 2% is a nice compromise.

Very good, but a little greasy.  Next time I will probably use a little less butter and a little more cheese - maybe throw in a little parmesan.

Made for the football game.  Kids and hubby liked but I thought it was a little too rich.  Could only eat a slice or two.  Thanks

This was good.  I think next time I will try it with half mozzarella and half garlic jack.

Loved this - used the zesty Italian.  But it looked a bit sparse on top (maybe it was the size of the loaf) so I got out my trusty microplane and grated parmesan all over the top of the cheese mixture.  I was afraid it would be dry so I drizzled a tiny amount of extra virgin olive oil over that and topped the whole thing off with a bit of cracked peppercorns.  Broiled it for just under 3 minutes - it goes fast.  This was the best cheesy bread I've ever eaten.  My guests gobbled it up!
