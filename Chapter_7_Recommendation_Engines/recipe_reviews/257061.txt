This Pozole was pretty much authentic and very tasty. The reason I am giving it 4 stars is because of step # 1. The canned hominy is pre cooked so there is no need to cook it for two hours. You will wind up with mush if you do. So I completely skipped step # 1. I cooked the pork meat for 1  hour, added the canned hominy, brought it to a boil once again then simmered for 20 minutes. Cooked to perfection.

This was my first time making the soup. I modified it by using chicken breast and added lots of toppings. It was good but I did miss the original pork flavor.

This was awesome! My husband loved it and he doesn't like Mexican soup's other than meatball soup.

This is a really good base, but requires quite a few modifications to be made flavorful. After I added 1/2 cup fresh cilantro, 3/4 tsp cumin, 3/4 tsp oregano, 1 tsp chili powder, and 1 diced onion it was much better. I intend to double the hominy next time as well.

Ohhhh myyyyyy Gaaaaaawd!  This is so good, especially today as leftovers!  I used shredded chicken instead of pork and boiled the hominy in chicken broth instead of water.

Love this soup so much.  I added a can of hominy and cooked the recommended time as I rather like the cooked in flavor it lends but I also add the rest about 45 minutes before serving and let it cook.  I prefer the red Pozole 100% of the time.  Yummm
