Simple and elegant! I can see the correlation of this being a comfort food. One tip, though, to be absolutely right and fresh, the sardines have to be fresh caught or local grown. Otherwise, don't trust them and don't use them. There could be trace amounts of mercury in them.

Just not my taste. Maybe I didnâ€™t get all the ingredients right. Particularly the sardines.
