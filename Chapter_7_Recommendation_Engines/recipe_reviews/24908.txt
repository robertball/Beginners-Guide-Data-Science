it's really good even thought i've made some minor changes in the original recipe, like cooking the arborio in saffron chiken stock and seassoning the goat with a sprinkle of dill and some oyster sauce

After rolling ingredients freeze for about 15 minutes.  Dip in milk and egg mixture roll in Panko Bread crumbs and allow them to sit on a rack with something under the rack to catch the crumbs falling away for about 5 minutes.  This will help to cut down on the moisture so the bread crumbs will not break away while frying.

I made this as is.  I used a herb/garlic risotto mix.  It is messy making the balls up, but well worth it.  It really does take 40 minutes to fry.  Used med/high heat.  Don't even bother checking them until at least 10 minutes.  Turning them too soon or too often makes them fall apart. My nine year old loved it.

These were very good although it was very sticky creating the balls.  Also they took a long time to cook.

I made this for my boyfriend who always gets the risotto balls at our favorite restaurant.  They were good but it did take a long time to cook.  I made it again using pancos to cover the balls before putting them in the pan and it did seem to make the cooking process go faster, plus it was less of a mess as the risotto the first time fell apart a bit when flipped too early.  And it's probably just me, but I found them extra good when dipped in to a bit of warm maple syrup.

I had one heck of a time frying these in the pan -- other recipes on line call for deep frying -- so next time I will try stuffing then flattening like a crab cake.  I made these for Christmas Eve and the flavor was fabulous and I reveived many compliments -- even from my 94 yr. old grandma -in-law who is really hard to impress!

I already believe it deserves four stars.  I already like to make risotto but for some reason I never thought of doing anything new with any left overs.  Maybe because I love risotto so much I tend to scoff the lot and have no left overs. But no more!  Fab idea and will be rolling left overs into cheese balls.  I bet mozzarella will be nice with it too.

Mehh. They were ok. People seemed to like them, but I found them rather bland.
