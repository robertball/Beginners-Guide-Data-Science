I know this is my recipe but I wanted to give a tip.  If you like yours a little crispier bake the tart cups for about 5 min before you fill them

This recipe turned out great!  My family loved it.  That said, I gave it 4 stars because I found it very confusing.  First, why put butter in with sausage - it's already loaded with fat - and you're throwing it away when you drain.  I saved the butter until the mushrooms were added.  I suspect it can be omitted entirely.  Second, I think the pound of cheese is waaaaay too much.  The recipe says put a pinch on each tart - no way that uses a pound.  I mixed 1/3 to 1/2 pound in with the suasage and mushrooms after they cooled, and that was very generous.  There was so much cheese in the mix that a pinch on top was no longer necessary.  In all fairness, I used grated instead of shredded cheese, but a pound is a pound.  I also took the advice of others and pre-baked the tart shells for 5 minutes.  I will definitely make this again with my slight modifications.  Thank you for submitting this great appetizer.

I followed this recipe exactly and the bottoms of the shells were VERY soggy. I even drained the sausage really well. The taste was okay, I would probably recommend using less sausage and more mushroom, since you couldn't even taste them. I won't be making these again. I had to go to the store and come up with another plan for Christmas appetizers. Bummer...

These are so good if you just add some sauteed onion, bake the phyllo cups as suggested, and omit the butter! Like a reverse-stuffed mushroom and so much easier!

I subsituted salsa for the mushrooms. Baked shells first, filled with sausage mixture, topped with cheese and baked til cheese melted....cooled, and topped with sour cream and a black olive slice. Was a hit at an all women Christmas party.

I took the advice of the person that submitted the recipe and baked the phyllo cups first...great outcome!!  The ONLY thing I did different was that I put in two or three cloves of garlic and that's because I LOVE garlic.  These flew off the table.  I will definitely double it next party!!!  Thanks for the great recipe!

These were great and a huge hit!  I made pretty much as directly but added some Italian seasoning.

I would suggest adding some half and half and italian cheese to the sausage mixture to make it more creamy.

These were really good. I used  chicken sausage. They were a little bland, could use a little salt and italian seasoning.

These were delicious with minor adjustments.  I used 8 oz reg sausage & 8 oz mild italian sausage with the 1 lb of mushrooms.  So easy & so delicious!  Thanks Donna!

Wow were these a hit!  Loved it all.  I used sweet Italian sausage, which worked great, and like the other users toasted the shells first.  I also mixed about 2 tablespoons of heavy cream in with the mushrooms and threw a handful of cheese into the mushroom mixture as well.  LOVED it!

Very good.  Some hassle factor, but not too bad, esp. if you have oven space available to keep the batches going.  Made a few batches for a family gathering and they were scooped right up.

I made these  along with 2 other recipes that called for mini phyllo cups.  These were the favorite by far.  I did mix the cheese in with the sausage /mushroom mixture instead of putting it on top of the tart.  I also made an omelette with the leftover mixture....that too was very good!
