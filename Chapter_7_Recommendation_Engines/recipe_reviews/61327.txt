Found this very easy to prepare, particulary if you buy all ready pre-cut vegetables or if cut all the veggies up the night before.  I marinated the meat in the teriyaki sauce before cooking instead of afterwards.  I didn't use cabbage but used snow peas instead.  Took the suggestion of adding water chestnuts.  Added some orange zest to the sauce right before serving.

This recipe was great! The beef was delicious and very tasty. I used a bag of frozen stir fry veggies and it was still wonderful :o) Thanks

I did not use the seperate pans. I just cooked it all in one pan at the same time and it turned out great. I also didn't have stir fry noodles or mustard power, so instead I added ginger powder.

I don't usually like stir-fry all that much, except that it's a good way to eat lots of vegtables. But this was very good. I added a big spoonful of peanut butter to the sauce and I substituted the orange jelly for pineapple juice concentrate (only because I didn't have anything orange flavored.) I also added cilantro and green onions at the end.

This was confusing so just ended up dumping it all in the wok. It worked fine. No need to have extra pans. I ran out of sesame oil so I just heated some oil and threw in a handful of sesame seeds.  Didn't have teriyaki so just used soy. I liked it...it was a little too sweet, but overall it turned out pretty good.

Very good.  I didn't change anything except I doubled the sauce because we like things "wet".  It was delicious and my family actually ate cabbage for once.  Thanks for sharing!

It is over the top delicious, and that is the way I like it! I especially love the hot mustard sprinkle, it adds extra zing and yet keeps it less spicy for those who like it milder. I used cabbage the flavor just melded with the others and provided crunch. Don't tell my wife, but I wish she could come up with stuff like this.

Thanks for a great recipe, this one is going into my recipe box to make again and again.  The only thing that I didn't do is add the chow mein noodles.

BritanyDear, your dad knows what he's talking about!  I made this about a month ago and came back to search it out again for my husband's homecoming from an out of state trip.  he loved it!  the orange sauce is delicious.  I'm going to try it with broccoli too this time, and i think I will use filet mignon, because the sauce is that worthy

To be honest, I didn't have high hopes for this dish. I've made a lot of stir-fries, and while good, most of them are fairly average. But this one was a really good flavor - not too strong or anything, but interestingly tasty! I was really impressed! I think it could be good with different types of meats too. I used kangaroo, because I had it on hand ;) I also added carrots.

This is a yummy recipe, but I give it a 3 because it is somewhat confusing.  If I wasn't already comfortable in the kitchen I'd be completely overwhelmed.  Seems like there are a lot of estimations - not sure why you'd need so much butter, and cooking the meat for 10 min is way too long. However, the flavors in the sauce are amazing, and I like that it doesn't get too thick.  Yummy recipe - just needs to be more exact.

Really good. This is easier to prepare then the directions would have you believe. I marinated the beef in the teriyaki along with 2 cloves of grated garlic, 2 tsp. red pepper and sesame oil while I cut up the veggies. Mixed up the sauce ingredients in another small bowl. Stir fried the beef then removed to a bowl, covered to keep warm, then stir fried the vegies. Added the beef back in and then the sauce and cooked till thickened. The beauty of stir-fry is the flexibility of adding whatever veggies you like. I substituted broccoli for the green pepper. Next time I'll add carrots too, and more red pepper, we like heat!

We just got done eating this...yummy! It was a bit spicier than i expected and there were more veggies than needed. The cabbage was surprisingly good in this. Will make again but with less veggies/red pepper.

It was good, I used a bag of frozen stir fry veggies.  I browned the meat and then took it out and threw everything into the pan at once, once the veggies were "cooked" I put the meat back in. (Oh I also just used orange juice concentrate instead of Jam, had it on hand)

A few modifications though: I didn't use cabbage, and I used only half of the teriyaki sauce it called for. The orange sauce is absolutely amazing, so I thought that the teriyaki was excessive. A good vegetable to add would have been broccoli.

The taste was pretty good, but the level of stress to create this dish was NOT worth it! Sorry, but these directions are VERY hard to follow. I'm still unsure of how many pans we are supposed to end up using here. There was also tons of prep work involved. Go ahead and make this if you WANT to spend all night in the kitchen. Didnt warm up very good as a left over either.

The meat was delicious! Great flavor. If I decide to make this dish again I will try it with out the lettuce and peppers.   I think this would have been a little better with broccoli or just the meat with rice.

I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because like a few others, I agree the teriyaki with the orange sauce was a bit overboard. I will make this again but I think I will just try some basic stir fry veggies rather than the cabbage. I didnt care for the veggies once it was all said and done but the beef was absolutely amazing. The orange sauce was simply spectacular.

I used orange marmelade instead and added the drippings in with marmelade
and broth. I also only added 1/2 the
teryaki sauce. I used a packed 
from store before. But my family liked
this one best.

I didn’t have any sauce, so had to skip it. Used a full can of beef broth, two spoons of mango-peach jam and a diced cutie (mini orange) in the sauce. Used just one pan. Wasn’t paying attention, and assumed it called for 1# of beef, so thought I was doubling the recipe. Oops. Used a whole stick of butter. (Soooo yummy, though!) Failed to sauté garlic the second time, so just added it to the boiling beef broth before adding the other ingredients. Used frozen stir fry veggies from Costco. Used a sprinkling of ground red pepper. Yum!

This is the best stir fry I've ever made!  Well worth the little bit of time it takes to cook it, the work is in the vegetable chopping.  My husband loved it, I am using the other half of the vegs., tomorrow and shrimp for my meat....best EVER, thank you for sharing.

This dish was awesome good but  I also found to be a bit confusing as the amount of butter is not broken down between steps 2 and 3. I just used 2 tablespoons for the beef and 3 tablespoons for the veggies. Recipe also calls for crushed garlic, which I assumed meant "crushed" but realized in Step 4' I was supposed to remove it. Did not matter as the entire dish came together perfect and got  lots of raves. Definitely a keeper!

it was a little confusing at first how to make this dish, but after making it once I liked the way it all came together. I substituted chicken for beef and it came out just great. the next time it will be easier to make and I will sure make this many more times!

I had some prepackaged stir-fry veges (peppers, onions, sugar snap peas, broccoli, carrots) and added some mushrooms.  Otherwise I followed the meat/sauce exactly.  This turned out great.  Hubby didn't eat the veges (never does) but it was a great meal we could both enjoy.  Look forward to the leftovers and I will be making this one again.
