I understand what an earlier reviewer meant by expecting flan and getting pumpkin pie.  It's not that the recipe wasn't good-- it works, it presents well.  But flan is so delicately flavored, and this just isn't.  It's a lot like a pumpkin pie sans crust.  Not worth the trouble for us-- I prefer either regular flan or pumpkin pie.

My husband & I loved this. I added my own spices & didn't use the pumpkin pie spice. It was very easy to do and came out wonderful.

It tasted like pumpkin pie filling and the glaze was cloudy with pumpkin. It tasted good, but I was expecting flan!  A little disappointing.

I made this as an accompaniment to Christmas dinner, I felt that it was very delicious. I read several previous reviews before I made it noticing that a lot of reviewers felt that it tasted more like pumpkin pie than flan. The starch in the pumpkin is what prevents the mix from turning into a normal creme, and I tried to get the proportion a little more accurate to ensure good creme'iness. 
I also prepared the flan in four square ramekins than an 8 x 8 square dish. I loved the presentation that came by using that instead. I think to get a more natural tasting flan, you need to use ramekins, and watch the time they are in the oven. I found that the right time is about 38 minutes. I simply loved a twist that pumpkin provided in this flan recipe. Thanks for sharing!
