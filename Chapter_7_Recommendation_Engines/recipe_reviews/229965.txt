Excellent!  I loved the base of the recipe.  I made substitutions/additions based on our lifestyle: 

Substituted egg whites for eggs, water for milk, brown sugar for white sugar, old fashioned oats for quick oats, molasses for maple syrup.

Added 1 tsp vanilla, 2 scoops protein powder, 1/4 cup each ground flax and chia seeds and 1/2 cup chopped nuts.

I increased the baking powder/baking soda to a full teaspoon each, used pure maple syrup and because I did not have quick cooking oats on hand, I ran equal amounts old fashioned oats down through my blender until it was the consistancy of whole wheat flour. I was able to get 12 big muffins out of one recipe. Baked at 350*, they were done at 22 minutes. My family loved these muffins, they are GONE. We seriously at them all at breakfast.

I have gall bladder problems and was looking for something low fat to make for the holidays.  This recipe has no oil!  And the muffins are soft and moist.  Very delicious.

Easy to make and delicious. Healthier than many other recipes.  I increased the number of servings to 8 and let the recipe recalculate ingredient amounts so that I could use the entire can (15 oz) of pumpkin.  I got 12 cupcake sized muffins and a mini loaf.

Excellent!  Very moist.  Used buttermilk vs regular milk and added raisins, walnuts and diced candied ginger.  Perfect at 23 minutes.

Great muffins, very moist and flavourful. Recipe actually makes closer to 7 or 8 muffins, or maybe my muffin pan is just smaller.
They are quite sweet, almost more of a dessert than a breakfast item, although so tasty you will want to eat them first thing in the morning anyway.

Delicious, moist and tender muffin. Got the "thumbs up" too from DH who is a fussy eater. I even cut the white sugar back to 1/4 c. and did spices to taste (I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I also added ginger and cloves). I like how much pumpkin this recipe uses and will make these again for sure. Next time I will add crushed walnuts. Thanks EW2012!

These did not turn out for me.  They didn't have any flavor and were quite dense.  No one really wanted a second one.

These were so moist & full of flavor. I used whole wheat pastry flour & omitted the maple syrup. Next time I'll add the oatmeal with the other dry ingredients. I doubled the recipe & got 18 regular sized muffins.

These muffins are a huge hit with the pumpkin lovers in my family.  In fact, I'll need to do a double batch this afternoon as per my order (you can't deny little granddaughters!).  I got ten good-sized muffins from this, all moist and yummy.  I suggest letting them cool for a few hours to peel away the liners if you use them because they are so moist the papers stick otherwise.  I followed the recipe using my own mix of pumpkin pie spice (recipe here on AR), and for the nutmeg I used a healthy dose of a special mix of apple pie spice that contains cardamom I was gifted by my friend ~Lissa~.  They took 25 minutes in the oven before the tops sprang back lightly.  Thanks for making me popular with my family!

We really liked these and I loved that they were a little healthier than most. I subbed water for the milk to keep it dairy free, baked them for 22 mins. @ 350.  I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I googled it and 1/2 t cinnamon, 1/8 t cloves, 1/4 t ginger and 1/8 t nutmeg = just over a tsp of the spice mix. I hope that this helps. Thanks for the recipe.

I liked these muffins a lot! I followed some other reviews and increased the baking powder and soda to 1 tsp. each, and used buttermilk instead of regular milk. I wanted them to be lighter because I also used old fashioned oats, not having quick on hand. They turned out light and moist and with good flavor. I might try raisins next time.

I feel terrible posting a negative review, but these were, in fact the worst baked good I've ever made. I followed the recipe exactly. I thought "How could you go wrong with pumpkin, complimentary spices and maple syrup?" I wish I knew! Texture was respectable. Muffins were definitely too salty, subtle but distinct problem. Beyond that they were "dry" in a flavor sort of way....I just can't describe.

Loved this recipe. Made some changes , used 1/4 cup brown sugar instead of white sugar. Used 3 Tablespoons molasses instead of maple syrup. 
Very good and moist! By the way mine made 10 good sized muffins instead of 6.

Made the recipe as stated but was hungry for "Morning Glory" type muffins so I added 1/2 cup each of currants, chopped pecans and coconut. Baked at 375 for 25 minutes and ended up with 12 regular sized, nicely domed muffins. Will make more to freeze for school morning breakfasts. Rated it a 4 star because I'm not a huge nutmeg fan but I added it anyway because I always follow a recipe the first time, next time I will either not use the nutmeg or decrease the pie spice, not sure which, maybe I should have another just to be sure! :)

This recipe is a keeper.  I was worried because it seemed like it needed more flour but it did not.  I followed as written except I added 1/4 cup unrefined coconut oil (I'm not on a low fat diet).  The cooking time is more like 35 minutes.  These are the best.  Moist and not too sweet - with a very nice texture. Yum!  Also I made my own pumpkin pie spice mix and used the recipe: Pumpkin Pie Spice II for these muffins and it is a really good blend.

Based on my reading of many of the reviews (and just for the heck of it), I increased the baking powder and baking soda to 1 tsp each, added extra ginger, vanilla, walnuts, chocolate chunks, some hemp hearts and flat seeds.

The muffins taste great and I will likely make them again. I might try reducing the sugar, or using brown sugar instead of white, though I don't find them excessively sweet. Apparently I've made them once before, but I don't remember!

Made the recipe exactly as written, and they were very good, but not quite a 5-star as is.  I think that they could use a little more depth of flavor, so I'll experiment with some of the things written here - buttermilk, nuts, etc.  They would also be outstanding with a streusel-type topping.  I will definitely make again, though ... even as written.

By the way - I used cooking spray instead of liners, and there was NO issue with sticking at all.

I have been looking for a quick healthy breakfast.  This fits the bill perfectly.  They are delicious & healthy.  I swapped out 1/2 the white flour for more oatmeal & 1/2 the white sugar for brown.  Love this recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

Lovely breakfastmuffins, easy to make, and with no added fat at all... but deliciously moist and soft - what more to wish for?!

The first time I made them as in the recipe, and they turned out great. I only added some chopped pecans (I'm a huge pecan fan since I discovered the existence of this lovely nut). As an experiment I added to a couple muffins some blueberries: these muffins turned out to be the biggest succes here in the house!

For the next time I went again with the pecans and the blueberries, but made two adjustments: I replaced the maple syrup with a big table spoon of honey, because I had no syrup left, and they were still fine. 

And secondly, I accidentally added twice the amount of oats (new measuring cups... :-P). I only realised this when they were in the oven, so decided to wait and see. Just pulled them out a little early, and to my relief, they are still edible. They have a little more structure and are a bit dryer, though not as much as I feared. With a dollop of jam, they're delicious! :-)

So: a very versatile recipe for those who like some variation, and a very nice recipe for those who want a simple, good pumpkin muffin!

These were great. Since making for kids, I toned down the cinnamon and nutmeg for less spice. I added raisins and a cream cheese frosting. Next time, I would add walnuts too. I really liked the texture from the oatmeal :)

Great recipe! To make it more healthy I added WAY less salt. 1/4 tsp. 1tsp is NOT necessary. I also added 1/2 the maple syrup it asks for and just for preference I used brown sugar instead. 23 minutes was perfect!

OH My Gosh! This is a yummy muffin! I replaced 1/2 the milk with kefir added 2T butter (because our bodies need *fats to absorb nutrients) & sprinkled the tops with chopped pecans & sunflower seeds. I used steel cut oats that I soaked in the wet ingredients for 5 min. Oh and I cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup. Next time I'll use no sugar. Thanks for a great recipe!

I love this recipe! My only addition was to throw in a heaping handful of dried cranberries and it is the perfect Fall & Holiday muffin!

I used all whole wheat flour instead of half and I made mini muffins for my kids for snack at school since lunch is at 10:45! Makes around 30 mini muffins. Great recipe   I also used canned pumpkin not the purée, I used the same measurement the recipe calls for.  I've made them about 4 times now.

I was looking for something a little different today using pumpkin.  I came across this one, and I'm glad I did!  The spices compliment these muffins well, and the oats add a slightly different texture compared to your normal muffin.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this dairy-free with rice milk. I was out of maple syrup so I used agave nectar. I added dairy-free chocolate chips and made mini muffins. In the mini muffin pan, bake for 10-12 minutes. My family and I love this recipe.

Followed the recipe as written except for subbing all-purpose flour for the wheat. The level of sweetness and moisture is incredibly perfect! Will definitely be making these again, but will reduce the amount of pumpkin pie spice and nutmeg just a bit because I feel like they masked the pumpkin flavor significantly. While these muffins are wonderful as is, I'll also experiment with add-ins such as raisins, chocolate chips, pecans, etc...

Even tho I used all white flour (had no wheat) and added a streusel topping, absolutely everything about this recipe was fabulous!  Muffins were moist, hearty and best of all not too sweet.  They baked up quickly (9 muffins in 20 minutes), came out of the tins easily...and believe me they came out quickly and were devoured.  Definitely a keeper recipe that I'll make again and again..thank you!

A great muffin for pumpkin lovers. The pumpkin flavour was just right, as were the size and texture. I doubled the recipe and made 16 good-sized muffins.  (I used buttermilk since it was on hand, and fresh nutmeg.)  Definitely a keeper!

I made these yesterday for breakfast.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I put them into 12 regular muffin cups.  They were fantastic.  NO added fat!  My daughter just finished the last one for an afternoon snack.  They were still moist on the second day.  This will be my new pumpkin muffin go to recipe!

Oh, my goodness! These are amazing. I just made a double batch this morning and will be making more SOON! These are hearty, rise to the perfect shape, and my 18 month son ate three of them--after he'd eaten breakfast! The oatmeal adds nice texture. This is my new staple pumpkin muffin recipe.

Delicious the way they are!  But the second time I made these I added two shredded carrots, some chopped walnuts and raisins, and as other reviewers recommended, I increased the baking soda and baking powder to 1 tsp each. I've also made these using brown sugar instead of the granulated sugar and cutting back a bit on the amount and found them to be even more delicious! Wonderful recipe!

These were great! My daughter loved them! The only thing I changed was added craisins and walnuts. Baked for 24 minutes and they were moist and fluffy. Probably could make a little healthier by omitting the syrup.

Loved the recipe! Really flavourful pumpkin muffins that pair excellently with cream cheese icing ;) I added extra cinnamon and nutmeg to replace the "pumpkin pie spices" and added 3/4 cup of chopped dried dates.

I used a whole 15oz can sweet potato purée, increased the baking soda and powder to a full 1tsp. I also didn't add as much nutmeg as stated as my pumpkin pie spice already has nutmeg in it. I subbed the white sugar for brown sugar and it made 12 regular size muffins and 12 mini muffins. Baked at 350 for 15 mins for mini muffins and 30 mins for reg muffins. Great recipe! Kid approved! Thanks!

Per some of the other suggestions, changed the servings to 8 to use the whole 15 oz can of  pumpkin. Used Old fashioned oats that I ran through the food processor and followed those amounts listed for everything else. Very moist and just sweet enough.

Modified ingredients.. Adding 1/4 c flax meal, increased b powder to 1 tsp, added 1/2 c cooked quinoa and used 1/3 c egg whites which I beat until stiff and folded in batter. Muffin was light and peaked very nicely. Also topped with dry oats and raw sugar which made a pretty & tasty topping.

This is by far, the best muffin recipe I've tasted in a long time. And it is healthier than I realized. Pure maple syrup is loaded with antioxidants as well as the health benefits of the spices. I added a few raisins and walnuts for even more health benefits. I can't believe there is no oil or butter and yet they are so moist.  Excellent recipe! Thank you.

I think this recipe is great!!!
I only changed one thing, I used brown sugar instead of white, just for added taste.  I then put chopped walnuts on top before baking with cinnamon sugar for added crunch.  This made 10 muffins for me and I love that I am getting the healthy oatmeal and pumpkin in a very tasty package.

These muffins are great! I tripled the recipe and added a bag of chocolate chips (because who doesn't like chocolate) and everyone who tried one really liked them. 

The first time I made them, I immediately wanted more, but I didn't have any more canned pumpkin, so I reviewed the ingredients and decided applesauce might make a good muffin, too! They turned out great, but could have used some chopped walnuts and maybe a some diced apples (or I could have used chunky homemade applesauce).

I love this recipe! I’ve made it many times. I generally add mini chocolate chips and ground pecans or walnuts, about a cup of each. I also use old-fashioned oats instead of quick cooking. I add a teaspoon of vanilla, also. And I use all unbleached all purpose flour, no whole wheat flour.

Both hubby and I enjoyed the muffins and made 1 dozen nicely sized. The only change I made was that I did not have maple syrup so I used brown sugar and melted butter to make 1/4 of liquid, and just threw the  entire 15oz can of pumpkin I had left over in. They came out great, and I would definitely make them again.

It came out OK.
The second time I did some substitutions.
Used:
Homemade oat flour instead of whole wheat flour; 
Publix biscuit mix instead of allpurpose flour; 
Coconut sugar instead of white sugar; 
Three eggs of Publix liquid eggs.
I also used extra dark maple syrup and added 1/4 cup honey.
I added raisins and chopped walnuts.
My guest liked the second batch best.

Used Swerve in place of sugar and molasses in place of maple syrup.  Subbed ginger and allspice for some of the other spices, and added about 1 cup of chopped pecans.  I got 12 regular size muffins and they were done in 25 minutes - maybe would have been better at 23 minutes.

Very, very tasty. I just wish they would rise high. I even added the extra soda and baking powder like others suggested. I'll still make them again. They were excellent with dried cranberries added in.

I really wanted to like these, but they were a failure. I followed the recipe to the letter, it was too easy to screw it up.  Wrong. Toothpick came out clean but after cooling 10 minutes, the muffins fell apart when turning out of my silicon pan.  Perhaps I should have cooled them longer. The results were pretty bland.  I won’t try these again.

Great recipe!  I blended the oatmeal in a Vitamix and followed the rest of the recipe as written.  This change resulted in a lighter, fluffier texture and a beautifully domed top.  It also increased the yield to an even dozen regular-sized muffins.  Tossed in 1/3 cup each of chopped pecans and mini chocolate chips.  Yum!.

Thanks for the recipe! I used 1 1/2 cups roasted pumpkin, 1/2 cup raisins, 1/4 cup brown sugar (instead of maple), 1 tsp each baking soda and powder, 1/4 cup skyr, 1 T canola oil. 325F for 12 medium muffins at 15 minutes. Delicious and pumpkiny!

I changed it to eight servings, which made 24 regular sized muffins (liners filled two-thirds full). I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I substituted garam masala and then added a pinch of ground cloves and a pinch of ginger. I should have sprayed the cupcake liners with non-stick cooking spray since it sticks to the liners. I don't love pumpkin things, but these are delicious!

I would make it again for sure! One problem I found was that the recipe said it made 8, 12,and 6 muffins throughout the recipe, it made more than 12 in the end, so I was surprised. I also think that muffins don’t need to bake for 20-30 minutes on 375. It just burns them. So, I put them in for 15 minutes, and they came out amazing! Overall, I would make this again and really enjoyed these muffins.

I cooked them for the amount of time it said, and a toothpick came out clean so I thought they were done. However, when I tried to take the paper off, the were way to gooey in the middle to eat.

The muffins were incredibly moist but lacked flavour.  Next time I will try adding vanilla and extra pumpkin spice. I used regular rolled oats and they worked well, also substituted with brown sugar and used all whole wheat flour.

Definitely tasty. I used liners, to which they are sticking terribly. I just read another reviewing which suggests allowing them to cool for several hours b/f removing from liners. Will try that and see how it works. . .

We loved these! I wanted to use a whole can of pumpkin, so doubled all the other ingredients except for the sugar, which I also switched to brown sugar. I used 1 TBS of baking powder, and added 1 cup chocolate chips. I had 18 muffin cups filled quite full with batter, and they rose nicely - just dense enough, but not heavy. So delicious!  It's hard to find a good oatmeal muffin recipe that doesn't result in dry muffins, but this one will definitely be made again here!

I made a few changes and made it delicious!

Instead of pumpkin puree, I used shredded/chopped pumpkin (I think about 3c or maybe 4c). 

Instead of Apple sauce, I took one cream cheese pack, mixed it with some sugar (about 1/2c white). Add this in after you're done mixing your batter of all the other ingredients. Don't blend it in. Just stir it around so it looks streaky. 

I also sprinkled cinnamon and nutmeg in the batter.

I made half regular batch like this. The other half, I threw in some chocolate chips and cocoa powder. 

The consistency seemed a little drippy, so I also dusted the batter with some more flour until I thought it was thick enough. 

The cream cheese makes the muffin dense and moist. Give it a day to settle and you will enjoy it even more the next day!

As muffins go, these are not sweet at all. Also, the yield is way off. If you follow the recipe, you'll end up with 12 standard-size muffins. I could have made them slightly bigger, but I didn't want to risk them overflowing.

This recipe was exactly what I have been looking for. I love pumpkin bread and pumpkin squares, but they both have so much sugar and oil in them that I feel guilty eating them. These are fantastic! My 5 yo and 2.5 yo both devoured one as soon as they were cool enough and then begged for more. 

My modifications: I left out the maple syrup because I didn't have any, so I used almost 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of white.  The only other changes I made was to A) substitute ground flaxseed for the white flour and B) increase the baking powder and soda both to 1 tsp. Next time I'll chop a small apple and mix that in with the oatmeal at the end. YUM!!

I was able to make 12  on the smaller size of normal sized muffins that baked for a little more than 10 minutes (I wasn't watching the time really closely).

I made this the first time exactly as written, they were great! The second time, I decided to try using up some plain Greek yogurt, in place of the milk, that I didn't want to go to waste in my fridge. The result was extraordinary. I hate it when people review and say this recipe was good, but when I made it, I changed everything... that being said, I liked the suggestion of adding some vanilla and a little extra baking soda/powder. Also, do not over mix your muffin batter, that results in the ugly cone shaped tops that got your grade reduced in cooking class!

I always make a new recipe the way it is written. Only difference being I used raw sugar as opposed to white. Otherwise this recipe was way too sweet for me.  It overpowered the pumpkin flavor. I would have to adjust it more if I was to make this recipe again.

We recently learned of wheat, dairy, and egg allergies in our family, and my 13-year-old son was craving muffins... so I substituted ground oats for the flour, soy milk for the milk, and 1/2 cup applesauce for the eggs. I'm rating it 5 stars, because, even with all these substitutions, the muffins were good. Even though they were caved in!

Doubled it to use a full can of pumpkin puree. Substituted Splenda for half of the sugar and added 1 c. craisins. YUM!

just pulled these out of the oven and they look gorgeous!! I used all wheat flour, added raisins and put some chopped pecans on top. Used brown sugar and regular old-fashioned oats. They smell incredible! My mom couldn't wait to try them and darn near burned her mouth trying them. Came out super light & fluffy. I usually like to base my rating on non-substituted ingredients,  but this recipe is probably awesome no matter what you do.

They were delicious!! The batter seemed a little soupy so I added extra flour and oats (I used old fashion) to get a thicker batter, and with that adjustment they turned out perfectly! I made a triple batch which made 48 normal size muffins plus three mini loaves. I also sprinkled chocolate chips on top right before baking.

I used 2 instant oatmeal packs that worked perfectly for this recipe. The family loved it and my husband is not a pumpkin spice fan, however, he really enjoyed it. I will definitely keep this recipe, thank you.

I just made these, but I switched out for whole wheat, old fashioned oats, unsweetened vanilla almond milk, and used dark brown sugar instead of white. also added 1/4 cup of coconut oil and about half a cup of crushed pecans. 
They're amazing, super moist and perfect. was going to glaze them but... now I might not because they're perfectly, lightly sweet. 
Thanks for the recipe!!

I added some cloves in lieu of pumpkin spice and put raw pepitas on top for some crunch and nice color! Oh, and I added 2T of flax seed since I'm breastfeeding currently! The oatmeal is already great for boosting supply. Love these any time of year!

These are pretty good. I added a teaspoon of vanilla, and next time I will add 1/4 vegetable oil- they need some fat. They taste great and are pretty nutritious.

These were pretty good.  I wanted more than 6 muffins, so I doubled the recipe and adjusted to our liking.  I subbed 1 c of blended all bran for the other 1/2 c of whole wheat flour and put in a total of 3/4 c of sugar.  I also didn't  increase the maple syrup to keep the sweetness down.  I didn't need to double the eggs or milk and they were still plenty moist.  The servings are definitely a little off because even without doubling all of the ingredients, I ended up with 16 muffins.  They weren't my sons favorites.

I added some ground pecans and used brown sugar for half the sugar.  These are great! Super moist, so much so that I had to cook them a few minutes longer than suggested.  My family loved them!

These are one of my family's favorite muffin/bread recipes. I changed several things. I added the whole can of pumpkin, which I think made them very moist. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla and 3/4 cup of crumbled pecans. I didn't have maple syrup so I used honey instead. I used regular oats, not quick. The spice ratio in this recipe is great - it's like pumpkin pie!

Very strange texture to have oatmeal in them.  I didn't have whole wheat on hand and also used pumpkin puree from our homegrown pumpkins.  I understand those two alterations have a significant impact on the liquid ratio.  They would have been better had the muffin been more dense.  I added chocolate chips and craisins to several of the pans (I made a quadruple batch) to add more texture and take away from the stark contrast between the moist muffin body and the odd oatmeal texture.  Flavor was okay, but seemed to be missing something -- can't put my finger on it.  They were better with the craisins and chocolate chips.  I think a nice honey butter or cinnamon butter would go well with the recipe.  I did use the additional baking powder and soda as many reviews suggested (1 tsp each).  Not sure if I'll be making them again.

Quadruple batch yielded approx. 48 muffins for me.  Regular size muffin tin with 1/3c batter in each.

Yum! Super moist and not too sweet. Next time, I'd like to add raisins or mini chocolate chips. I changed the servings to 8, and the recipe yielded 12 large muffins from a regular cupcake pan.

I like these muffins, they are dense and moist. Not very cake like. I used only whole wheat flour, added a tsp. of vanilla, substituted buttermilk for milk, added only 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 oats.  The recipe made 9 regular muffins and they baked for 23 mins.  Overall a good breakfast muffin.

These were sooo good! I made them and they were gone after two days. We devoured them! They were very moist. I added more cinnamon because I didn't have enough pumpkin pie spice but they were still amazing. Also, I used plain old Rogers golden syrup instead of maple syrup and it turned out fine. will make this again.

I made this recipe vegan and LOVED it.  I had all the ingredients already in my home, and the muffins turned out so moist.  I did make the same changes kel7298 did, and will try them again tonight doing all the same things, but using Maple Syrup instead of Molasses.  I also added caribou chips, which turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe.  These are now my morning treat.

These muffins didn't rise enough.  I think that they need to have some lemon juice added to the milk to make a reaction or something.  They didn't taste bad but I had to make another batch because they weren't suitable for company. They were so sticky that you couldn't peel the paper liners off without losing half of the dense little puck.  I made the recipe exactly as written. Not making these again.

makes more than 6 muffins! I wanted to make 2 dozen and ended up with 24 muffins, one 9 in loaf pan and 2 mini loaf pans worth of batter! However that said the muffins taste divine. Used 1/2 the sugar and doubled the honey  as a substitute for the rest of the sugar and maple syrup. I also added goji berries and raisins. Since I didn't have enough pumpkin I used some banana and some applesauce, which probably added to the moistness. Also added some allspice, just cause I like the flavor it adds. overall aside from the muffin count a very flavorful, moist muffin, and loaves!

This recipe as written is bland, and a little salty. I am even a salt person, but this was just not enjoyable. On the up side, it was moist and tender without a speck of fat or oil. If I were to make it again, I would 1/2 the salt, add 1/2 C. brown sugar, 1 tsp. vanilla, delete the pumpkin pie spice, add 1/2 tsp. ginger, 1 tsp. cinnamon, and maybe some chopped pecans.

I loved this recipe..I did change it a bit to make it more healthy. I cut the sugar by 1/2 and used all whole wheat flour. I also used regular rolled oats (because that is what I had on hand) and I added chopped walnuts. My husband thought they were great!!

I just made these. Here are my changes. I added flax meal (flax seed just passes through) and I use a new sugar I found at King Soopers Madhava's Coconut Sugar. They were great!

You only have to use one bowl and there is no oil!  These are also great with some chocolate chips mixed in.  Very yummy and moist.

Maybe I did something wrong, but I could get the muffins out of the muffin tin liners. The flavour was good though.

The muffins lack any butter or oil and stick horribly - I used muffin tin liners in my pans.  Other then that, they are good - moist and flavorful.

These were just "okay."  I added more spice because they were bland as the recipe is written and since there is no fat in the recipe, the texture was a little rubbery.  The recipe says it makes six big muffins, which worked out to a dozen regular-size muffins.

Yummy. I added pecans and next time might add some raisins too. I like that there is no oil or butter in the recipe and they are still super moist.I think you could cut back on the sugar quite a bit and they'd still be great. Thanks!

It was easy to follow and I probably undercooked them slightly at 22 minutes,. But I did not want dry muffins! Next time I'll add raisins, craisins, or mini chocolate chips. Not that they necessarily need them, but just a perk. Oats are a great touch.

Really good. The kids love them. Didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I added a bit more cinnamon and 1/2 t ginger and 1 t vanilla. 1 1/4 c pumpkin puree is about 3/4 of a 15 oz can. I put in the whole can though.

I'm normally one of those people who looks for recipes based off MANY reviewer's notes. I gave this recipe a try because it looked so good and not too unhealthy, 257 calories (according to my calculations) for a JUMBO muffin?! Yes! I followed the recipe as written and it came out flawless. I had to add a few minutes to the cook time making it shy of the 30 minute max time recommended. I highly recommend this recipe for those wanting a mildly sweet and moist quality muffin.

These actually were surprisingly pretty good! I didn't expect much because of the lack of butter in the recipe. But the pumpkin is an excellent replacement! And the spices really enrich the flavor. They're not my favorite muffin... but for the healthy nutritional content, they're not bad. (Although, the choc. chips and walnuts I added might have influenced the taste somewhat.) ;)

The family LOVED these muffins.  I wanted to make 12 regular sized muffins so I increased the recipe by 50%.  I ended up with 18 regular sized muffins!  Believe me, no one complained about the extra muffins.  The only change I made was to decrease the maple syrup a little.  I didn't seem to adversely change the outcome.  This recipe is a keeper!

I had some pumpkin puree that I needed to use up and these were perfect (didn't quite have enough, so I made up the difference with applesauce).  These are super easy and love how healthy they are (despite the fact that I dipped them in a brown sugar/butter glaze ;-)  Definitely will be a go-to recipe from now on!

These were great! I did make a couple adjustments. I only had one cup pumpkin so I used 1/4 cup applesauce. I also used raw cane sugar, it has a great molasses flavor. Also tossed on a tablespoon of chia seeds. Everyone ate them up, thanks!

This is the first time I am giving a rating, I just made these muffins at 10 at night and I think Im going to eat another 3 before bed!!!  YUM!!! These are the perfect tasty treat for anyone and good for those watching their figures.  I cut the sugar by half and used 2 eggs and 2 egg whites (made a double batch).  For the second dozen I took the advice of another poster and used blueberries...I cant wait to taste those in the morning.  Great Recipe, I will use it again this summer to take camping for a quick breakfast for my family of 5. I got 24 nice sized muffins.

I followed the recipe and they turned out great!  I also made these using pumpkin pie filling instead of pumpkin purée.... It tasted great! I will make these again.
