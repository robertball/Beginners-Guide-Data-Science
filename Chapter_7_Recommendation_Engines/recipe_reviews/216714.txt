Great stuff!  I used pepper jack to give it a little kick.  Didn't have enough foil to cover the pan so I didn't use it and baked it about 20-25 minutes instead of 15.  Turned out great!  Update:  I tried reducing the milk to 1/2 cup and it made the spaghetti layer turn out a lot less runny.

I was disappointed with this recipe.  The crush was soupy not a crust.

Very good - everyone loved even those who don't like sausage.  Used Spicy Sausage and put a lot more cheese than called for :)

Everyone in the family loved this.  So easy to make -- already had everything I needed on hand.  Used "hot" country sausage, which gave it an extra kick.  Used mexican cheese blend.  Used spaghetti sauce instead of "tomato" sauce...  baked it a little longer than recommended.  Turned out AWESOME!

It was ok. Just a little bland and that's after I added cayenne powder.

I've tried 6 different Spaghetti bakes and I hated all of them. I decided if this one didn't cut it - I was DONE trying (and I'm a great cook!). Tonight I tried this one and it was DELISH! I didn't have green peppers so doubled the onions. I didn't have Parmesan cheese so used mozerella, baby creamy Swiss, and Colby Jack. I didn't have enough tomato sauce so the bottom is a little dry (my fault). The flavor was awesome even if my consistency fur to lack of ingredients was off. I did take off the aluminum foil once I heard it boiling for about 3 1/2 minutes. So I can only imagine with the right ingredients this will be awesome!!!! Very Happy Chef!

My wife and I cook for 7-9 every night and this is a real pleaser.  Threw in some cayenne pepper for a little more kick.  I love recipes like this that build on basic meals.

I am not a very experienced cook so I come on here a lot. This is the first time I made this recipe. It's delightful and is very flavorful. Instead of tomatoe sauce I used tomatoe paste with a half a cup of water. And I used a lot more cheese!

I made these twice however the second time I boiled the spaghetti to long so the recipe came out wet.  Make sure the spaghetti is cooked aldente then it should be crispy on the outside and soft inside.  My family said this is a keeper.

I also used Pepper Jack cheese on the top, and served the Cheddar cheese on the side.  I used Italian sausage.  Would definitely make this again!
