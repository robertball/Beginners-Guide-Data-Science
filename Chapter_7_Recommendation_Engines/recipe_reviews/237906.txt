Since I haven't regularly used a lot of chili sauce except when entertaining, it was important to me to find a sauce for which I usually have all the ingredients and still tastes like chili sauce.  I found it in this recipe.  The flavours are bright and balanced, and the consistency was what I expected.  Who needs commercial chili sauce when you have this recipe?  Thank you for the recipe!

I've been making this for at least 30 years with this proportion of brown sugar and vinegar. Sometimes I change around spices and have even omitted them in a glaze, but this is an excellant fast fix for chili sauce or instant BBQ sauce. It's great to slather onto spareribs before the final finish broiling. I usually simmer it a minute or so to blend the flavors, but that is definately optional.

Bland; no zip, no zing.  I immediately starting adding spices like crazy (I was in a rush), trying to give it some flavor.  In the end, everyone was extremely happy with the result....   I don't think I could duplicate it, but among my steps was to double (or more) most everything that wasn't tomato sauce, esp. more chili powder (1/2 t ??; Shudda knowed better), Sriracha sauce (a very good addition; recommended), epizote (rarely a bad idea), Worcy Sauce, cayenne, maybe some clove, some black pepper.   I would have added some sour salt, but we were out.

The only change I made to this was that I used crushed tomatoes (because that's what I had in the house).  I've never made my own chili sauce before, but now that I know how easy and delicious it is, I'll make it every time I need it.

Perfect! I made it as written except I used ketchup instead of tomato sauce, because I had a big bottle to use up. It was so good!

I made this in a pinch & had all the ingredients on hand - how perfect! I don't use chili sauce very often, so this was economical & organic, too. Very tasty!

For many years I had a large garden and canned chili sauce every fall with my abundance of tomatoes. This recipe is just as good as the time consuming process. I use petite diced tomatoes and a couple squirts of tomato paste from a tube and cook it down till itâ€™s a little thick. The spices are a perfect blend. Thanks for making life easier!

I used my home grown tomato products instead of store bought. It turned put very good & I used it in a sloppy joes recipe.

Wonderful. I started with the basic measurements (minus the chili powder as I was making BBQ beef) and adjusted to my taste.  As good as Heinz in taste but not as thick without cooking it. Very glad to have found this recipe.

This was perfect!  I subbed Bragg's Apple cider vinegar for health benefits.  This sauce made our chili very flavorful and hit the spot.

Very simple to make and so easy. I do not keep Chili Sauce on hand so thought I would try this.  It was a success.

Love it, however, doubled the chili powder. Ground our own allspice.

Great recipe! Very easy to change it up and use what you have on hand (i didn't have tomatoe sauce so I used ketchup and omitted the sugar and vinegar). Thank you!

I loved that it came together in a flash; I had all ingredients on hand; it was something rarely called for in my cooking, but needed for a recipe I was following tonight, so with this I could adjust the portions to make only what I needed. Win. Win! Thank you for posting! (The recipe I was making was the Absolutely Awesome Barbecue Sauce from this site.) Turned out fine.

Made this for my son, who loves shrimp but dislikes cocktail sauce. I used double the onion powder, and used apple cider vinegar instead of white. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written  and my son absolutely loved it.

I already had one bottle of chili sauce, and needed to double the amount. I had no allspice so I used apple pie spice that I had on hand, (which contains cinnamon, allspice and nutmeg).  I added about 2 tablespoons of ketchup and a healthy shake of cayenne pepper, and it tasted almost identical to the bottled Heinz.

Fantastic sauce! Ingredients are probably on hand, and it's so easy to make. I used this as the sauce for my American Chop Suey. Also added ketchup to the macaroni/hamburg mixture. It came out great! This sauce can be used for many things. It's good to know what's in your sauce; why buy it from the store? Thanks for the very useful recipe!
