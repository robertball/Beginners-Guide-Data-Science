A few additions added a LOT of flavor to this recipe: 1 tbsp lemon juice, 1/2 - 1 tbsp finely chopped fresh ginger, 1 tsp+ each of cayenne pepper and chili powder to replace the chili sauce, and chunky peanut butter for crunch.  I also used fat-free half-and-half to replace the cream (milk works well, too) because there's enough fat in the peanut butter.  The half-and-half keeps it creamy.  I let the sauce sit for about an hour and it was great served with a stirfry of broccoli, carrots, and red pepper over noodles.

This was a delicious recipe!  I modified it slightly, but used the same measurements.  Sticking with traditional Thai cooking, I replaced the heavy cream with coconut milk. I also added a dash of fish sauce.  I replaced the chili sauce with 1 tsp dried red pepper flakes.  I used dark soy just because it has a deeper flavor.  I also replaced hot water with chicken stock.  You can always add more stock to thin the sauce.  For the garnish, I used scallions and crushed peanuts.

Outstanding! The leftovers were even better as the flavors "soaked" into the noodles! My boyfriend didn't like this (the PB was just too much for him BUT...perhaps if I had fed him the leftovers, he might have changed his mind? ;)) A couple changes: First, I used 1/2c HOT chicken broth instead of the water and used only 8oz spaghetti noodles so that it wouldn't be "dry." Second, right before the noodles were done, I tossed in a head of chopped broccoli into the water so that they would cook. Finally, I fried up 2 chicken breasts in a little butter and chicken broth - cut them in chunks and placed them atop the pasta. The broccoli gave this color (and I love my veggies) the chicken added some substance and the noodles tasted - well - just darn good! I would have liked this a little spicier but I can play around with that more the next SEVERAL times I make this! Thanks a bunch Holly!

I used this as a sort of template to build on. I used extra garlic and soy sauce, used a thai chili paste in place of the chili sauce and also added a few drops of thai fish sauce.  When I added the peanut mixture to the spaghetti, I found the taste to be too sticky, so I then added some chicken broth to thin it a bit...then voila I had a perfect pasta dish!

Yummy recipe!  I followed the example of other reviewers and used coconut milk instead of cream and stock instead of water.  I also added 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, a few dashes of fish sauce, 2 teaspoons of sambal oelek, and 1 teaspoon of crushed ginger.  I stir fried some pork strips, onion, red pepper strips, sliced carrot, and broccoli and added that to the spaghetti and sauce.  It had a nice mild heat to it and a wonderful peanut taste!

Nice flavor, to make it a more harty meal I topped it with Tyson ready grilled chicken breast strips, diced roma tomtaoes, sliced green onoin, chopped honey roasted peanuts and used about 1/2 bunch of chopped cilanto (we love it).  I also used penne.

I loved the idea of this dish but it was not something I will make again. The descriptions of others were accurate in describing the flavors, it just wasn't something I could like. It was creamy, had a decent flavor but none of us in my family fell in love with it. We all ate it, no one refused it, but discussed the fact that I will never make it again. My son adds bbq sauce to everything so he said it was ok (with bbq sauce). I'm definitely glad I tried it, we come across loved recipes that way, we just won't "try" this one again.   I don't want to turn people away from this recipe, because if all of the ingredients are something you like, give it a whirl. That's what I did.

This was so tasty!  Like other reviews, I chose to use Half/Half instead of heavy whipping cream.  I also garnished with crushed walnuts instead of cilantro-mainly because I didn't have any.  I let it cool a little before eating and the sauce thickened up which gave the food a nice texture.  Also, I only used 10 ounces of noodles instead of 12.  It was the perfect amount for two adults and two little kids.  By the way, the kids inhaled it!  Five stars definitely!

I followed suggestions made by LitleLisa1 and DREGINEK and the results pleasantly surprised me.  I used: 1/2 cup hot chicken broth instead of water, dark soy sauce, about a tsp of Cayenne pepper instead of chili sauce (and a few pinches of red pepper flakes), a few dashes of Thai Fish Sauce, a tiny dash of Dashi-no-moto, a dash of cinnamon, 1 tbsp. lemon juice (I consider this ingredient necessary), and had no cilantro though will use it next time.  Also I used a mini food processor to roughly chop the peanuts for garnish.  I had heavy cream on hand but next time I will definitely use either half&half or milk as the heavy cream was very heavy.  And with regular peanut butter the sauce definitely has enough fat!  

ALSO I Pan-fried/sauteed Haddock loins in some peanut oil and a little of the peanut sauce, and then added some fresh broccoli florets and chopped carrot and let them simmer but it's crucial the veggies stay a little crunchy to offset the soft texture of the noodles and sauce.  I used the 8.8oz package of Eden Udon noodles.

This was pretty good, although I may have used too much pasta to the amount of sauce I had because it came out really dry and a little bland.  Don't overdo it on the pasta!

Delicious!  Used 2% milk instead of heavy cream and added a squirt of lime juice and fish sauce.  Also used rice noodles instead of spaghetti.

A really nice recipe.  I would like a bit more kick, perhaps some curry powder.  Will make again.

I use unsalted, unsweetened peanut butter and add brown sugar to taste. I also use half and half instead of cream to cut down on the calories. I throw in about 2 teaspoons of fresh ginger and a dash of cinnamon. This makes for a sweeter sauce with great savory undertones. My boyfriend begs me to make this dish!

This was good, but the peanut butter was all we could taste. We love peanut butter so I'm going to make it again using more of the other ingredients. Also, I didn't care for the leftovers. They were too chalky.

Had too much peanut butter in the recipe for my taste, having followed the recipe precisely.  I ended up adding additional soy sauce to each serving.  It needs something else... chicken, veggies...  Wasn't impressed.

This recipe is excellent and I have made it many times to rave reviews. I'm not a fan of spicy dishes so I don't use the chili sauce and I don't keep cilantro around the house so I don't use that either but it still comes out great. I replace the heavy whipping cream with half and half because I had it in the house and it cuts the calories a bit. Great with sauteed broccoli and tofu or tempeh (for those vegetarians). Thanks for this great recipe!

Pretty easy and quick!  I used prechopped garlic, hot sauce and reduced fat peanut butter, toasted seasame oil and no cream or cilantro and it turned out just fine.  You could also add fish sauce for more of a Thai flavor.  Great meal if you are relying on your pantry alone :-)

These were goopy and gloppy.  Of 6 of us eating dinner, 1 enjoyed them, 1 thought they were edible and the rest could not even eat one bite!  The sauce looked and tasted fine on its own but I will from now on leave my spaghetti to the italians and the peanut butter to dessert or breakfast!

Good, however the sauce was too thick. Next time I am going to cook the sauce in a small pot. Also, it did taste somewhat like you were eating plain peanut butter

Quick and easy which is always a bonus.  But I adjusted the recipe according to others' suggestions: reduced cream to 1/4 c., replaced water with vegetable stock and chili sauce with cayenne pepper, added a dash of cinnamon, 1 tsp. fresh ginger, and 1 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice.  Also added steamed broccoli for some veggies and garnished with peanuts.  Hubby loved it!

I used lo mein because I didn't have spaghetti. Likewise, I also used heavy whipped cream out of a spray can, reduced fat peanut butter, and regular soy sauce. Even with all the forced changes, it was still really good. It definitely needed some crushed peanuts, though. Thanks for the easy (and forgiving) recipe!

This was a nice comforting bowl of pasta, perfect for dinner on a cold evening.. I doubled the sauce to pasta ratio after reading other reviews that it was a bit dry and it turned out great. I didn't have any cream so used soy milk instead and it was fine (think the cream would have made it too heavy). I also cooked some baby spinach with the pasta before adding the sauce and it was delicious.. I'll make it again, so easy and quick!

I tried this recipe because of all the great reviews.  I'm sorry to say I did not enjoy this at all.  Let me also add that I am pregnant and my taste buds aren't the same as they used to be.  I did give it three stars though because my husband and co-worker loved it.  Also, the you have to serve this dish right after the sauce and noodle have tossed otherwise the noodles will absorb the sause and it will become dry like some of the other people mentioned.  If you don't plan on serving it right away then don't add the sauce until you are ready.

It was easy to make but next time I'll try the coconut milk and some red pepper flakes.  It needed an extra bite to it.

This was a nice recipe, really creamy sauce and a nice mild flavor. It was bland though for my tastes so the next time I'll add some ginger and chile paste and maybe crushed red pepper too. This would be great for kids tastes though as it isn't spicy. Thanks, this was simple and made a nice quick hot lunch.

Very enjoyable flavour.  I did add an extra clove of garlic and used aji mirin instead of sesame oil.  I think that this would benefit from maybe some plum sauce (even though that isn't Thai) for that PB& J flavour.

Great pasta. I used the recipe ideas from several reviewers and used chicken broth instead of water. Also I doubled the sauce ingredients but only used 1 package (8 oz.) of lo mein noodles. I served it with sauted broccoli and tomatoes with peanuts and seasame chicken with mushrooms and onions. One plate filled me.

Really nice! I used chunky peanut butter, and it gave this dish a really nice texture. I also used a tablespoon of Garlic Chili Sauce (Asian aisle of the market) instead of the dash of hot sauce. Green onions would really be great in this dish, too. I loved the cilantro with it!

This is a great, quick to prepare recipe. I also used pre-chopped garlic from a jar, and half and half. Great as is, or would certainly be enhanced by some of the suggestion of the other reviewers.

Ugh, I really thought this would be good, but it sure wasn't.  I know it sounds strange, but this was just way too ...peanut-buttery.  If you're going to make this, do yourself a favor and add a lot more soy sauce and water than the recipe calls for, otherwise it will just turn out as a sticky, gooey mess.

This way very good.  I used chunky peanutbutter, added some red pepper flakes, and a tablespoon of dark soy sauce. I think next time I will use angel hair pasta.  Also we ate it cold.

After some adjustments,  this is one of mine and my husband's favorite recipes.   Like other reviewers,  I use broth, coconut milk and crunchy peanut butter.  Like others,  I also add a t of ginger and a T of lemon juice, a T of soy sauce and a little fish sauce  But I also spice it up with about a T of sriracha,  and 2 t or so of red pepper flakes and 1 t of chili powder.  I also add a bag of broccoli slaw and a pound or more of shrimp  (I usually 1.5 the recipe in general).

It's not bad! I had to substitute  cream cheese for cream so I added about two tbsp more water. Probably not as saucy as it would otherwise be.

I've followed some people's suggestion of substituting the hot water with chicken broth and it was fabulous. There was no need for salt as the bouillon cube was salty enough. I used full cream milk instead of heavy cream and for the pasta, fettuccine. I added more chilli sauce and chilli flakes just to get the heat. It's a good recipe and one that is easy but I really don't like the heaviness of the peanut butter sauce which can be so overwhelming. Shall try this again next year as its taste is one I can remember for that long.

This is a keeper, pasta with an asian twist! 
I ended up reheating this with an additional portion of the peanut butter sause to loosen it up and make it creamier, and several schredded chicken breasts. I also prefer one users suggestion to substitute chicken broth for the water. Thank you for sharing!

I took other peoples advice and added the ginger, lemon, veggies and milk(instead of heavy cream) and it came out light and delicious. I will make this again.

I made this recipe tonight to go along with the Asian Tuna Patties also from this site.  The taste was very good but the texture was not as smooth as it should have been.  I will try it again, but next time I will add a bit more cream.

Not bad. I made two similar peanut butter pasta dishes this morning and I liked the other one better. My husband said he wanted peanuts or something crunchy to be added so next time I will do chunky peanut butter instead of creamy. I added some ground fresh ginger as well.
