Let me just say that This is an excellent recipe and it got rave reviews but I would suggest little changes to suit your personal tastes. It has a wonderful fresh flavor and mine was on the chunky side which everyone liked.  The main modification that I made was the amount of Jalapenos.  I listened to some other reviewers and used only 1/2 of a pound of jalapenos and the seeds from only 3 of them (it was about 12 jalapenos for the 1/2 pound). It was very spicy at that.  1/2 pound was just about right....spicy and just hot enough to be flavorful but not so hot that it is unbearable. It does leave a little burn on your tongue but I thought it was exactly right I don't think that anyone that I know could actually eat this concotion if you used the full pound of jalapenos and used the seeds as well.  I would definitely suggest to start on the low side and add jalapenos as needed to your taste.  
Also, I followed this recipe exactly and measured out the tomatos, etc....It only made 3/4 of a gallon instead of 1 1/2 gallons that the recipe states.  I didn't boil it very long either. 

My other substitution was lime juice for the lemon juice...I prefer the taste of lime.

All in all, I loved this and have been asked to make someone a batch for Christmas.  I will be keeping this recipe in a safe place.  Love it!!!

This is Kikiwood.  I have found a variation that my family really likes.  I now take the jalapenoes and roast them in a cast iron skillet until the skin is black.  The skin then comes off easily and it gives the salsa a more complex flavor.  I'm glad that everyone has been enjoying the receipe.

WOW--what a salsa!  I cut the recipe in half and canned it, and still had a bunch!  Everyone who has eaten this has loved the fresh taste.  I did use fewer jalepenos, because I used the seeds when I chopped them.  Next time I think I will deseed some of them, and include more jalepenos for their great taste, but not all their spice.  I also added more cilantro, because that's what our tastes like.  I plan on passing this one out canned, and making more!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Wow, this recipe is HOT. It is the best as far as taste and consistency goes. I won't make anythin else. We had company from the Middle East and from Europe. I put this out with some chips and they(everybody) absoluetly loved it. They took the recipe back with them. I eliminated the powdered pepper and it was still too HOT! I added a large can of Pureed tomatoes and that toned it down and actually improved the flavor.

This was my first experience making salsa and I am very pleased with the result.  Great taste and texture.  It is a little on the hot side.  I used the full pound of jalepenos and seeded them all.  Next time I will cut the amount in half.  I will also wear gloves.  The acid from the tomatoes and the jalopenos are killers on your hands!!

This one is great and easy! You can adjust for your salsa tastes--I added more cilantro and lime juice in place of the lemon. I also just chopped all my tomatoes on the second batch.

This is the first time I have ever made salsa and I couldn't be more happier with how it turned out.  I used the whole pound of jalapeno peppers, but only the seeds from two of them.  My family and friends keep coming back for more!  I have also frozen some to give away.

I followed exactly except to use lime juice instead of lemon.  Add 1 Tbs sugar (a little secret ingredient I learned from a local Mexican neighbor) and Oh...wow...  Fabulous salsa.  I tripled the recipe and canned it.

This is my first try at making canned salsa.  It's a  really good recipe but you'll need to adjust the heat to your taste.  I was able to make 2 batches this year - 1st one too mild, 2nd slightly too hot!  I'll get it right with next years tomatos!  And for anyone who may be intimidated by the canning process, it is not difficult at all.  I run my jars under the hottest water I can (our water heater runs hot), pour the hot salsa in & put the lid on.  You'll hear the "pop" of it sealing in within 5 minutes.

Excellent!  I doubled the recipe and cut down on the spice (I have young kids who love salsa) I ended up using, 1 tsp of Cayenne and 3 jalapenos (for a double batch) turned out to be a flavourful mild recipe - perfect for my kids.  The double batch made 11 500ml jars.

I've been canning this recipe for over 4 years. Every tomato season, I go to a little road side vendor and get all his "ugly" tomatoes and the canning begins. I've modified it as such: 4c Crushed tomatoes, 11 tomatoes, 3+ peppers, 6 jalepenos, 1/2 c lemon or lime juice, 3T fresh minced garlic. Once I heat the crished tomatoes, I add in the following order, the peppers - heat slightly, then the onions, heat slightly, add all the chopped tomatoes (skin on), and remove from heat. I can usually 8 quarts from this recipe, in a water bath.

The flavor and texture are great. I added half the amount of recommended jalepenos and did everything else as directed. It was still too hot! My husband and I like spicy food, and neither one of us could eat it. I added two cans of diced tomatoes and it was still too hot. If I had added the entire amount of recommended jalepenos, it would have burned out mouths for sure. Add the jalepenos one by one until you find what works for you.

We love a mild salsa.  I followed directions but omitted all jalepeno peppers and substituted diced green chili's in their place.  When I was done, I tasted it and felt like it needed a little more depth of flavor so I added about 2T. sugar and that did the trick.  We couldn't get enough!  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was my first time making salsa...so I was a little worried about how it would turn out.  I did use tomatoes out of the garden, rather than the roma tomatoes.  I only used a few jalapeno peppers, and more banana peppers.  It turned out fantastic!!  I am making more this weekend, since all of my family and friends loved it and asked for more!  And, it's a great way to use up all those tomatoes from the garden!

This was REALLY good- but I'm giving it four stars because it is a bit runny, and I had to use less than half the jalapenos called for in the recipe. If I had used the full amount as directed, this would have been so hot it would have been inedible! And I like HOT food!! Besides being a bit runny, the flavor was GREAT, I will definitely make this again. I will also use FRESH garlic next time.

This was good! But - HOT!!! I had to add a ton more tomatoes to cool it down, even though I scaled back on the cayenne & only used a 1/2 lb jalepenos - I went running for water! Next time I'll use even less cayenne. I would not recommend canned "crushed" tomatoes - these were like tomato sauce really - no tomato chunks in that stuff at all (at least not the kind I used, Thrifty Maid). Luckily I had a few cans of peeled whole tomatoes, which I drained & diced into chunks. That helped a LOT to give it a more salsa-like consistency. Next time I'll look for canned diced tomatoes, or just attempt using fresh. I used a lime and lemon's juice, and doubled the cilantro (which may have unexpectedly added the extra heat). This is definitely a "cooked" salsa - which still came out surprisingly good, but it's not quite like that awesome fresh stuff at an authentic Mexican restaurant. I still am scouring the universe for a recipe for that! This does have the consistency of "Pace" salsa, but it tastes WAY, WAY better, and I like knowing there's nothing in it I can't pronounce! Tip: Prep EVERYTHING before you start! I didn't, and it took me hours! Also, don't cook *too* long - the salsa keeps cooking after u remove it from the heat. My veggies were a tad soft for my taste. Any longer & it may have turned into a spicy spaghetti sauce! I also roasted my jalepenos - kind of a pain but worth it for the flavor.

This salsa is great - I love it. Quite a bit of work with the peeling of the toms, but well worth the wait. I cut down the portion to about 4 lbs of toms and I still have a HUGE pot. I also reduced the portion of cayenne pepper - and it still turned out to be super duper spicy and I didn't even add the jalepeno peppers. I substituted lime juice instead of lemon juice and added lots and lots of fresh garlic instead of the powdered. This is a keeper - I won't be buying salsa in the jar again. Great for candida - all of the ingredients work on the diet.

Ok, this recipe is HOT!!!!!!!!!! And, I like some heat to most things so that is saying something.  Just a couple of recommendations:

1.  Double the salt
2.  Cut the jalapeno and cayenne in half.

If you do those two things u will have a salsa with just enough heat and just the right amount of salt.  ENJOY!

Tried salsa for the first time this weekend and used this recipe, LOVED IT!! Cut back on the jalapenos a bit, made one batch hotter than the other and also left out the cayenne as I felt the jalapenos would add enough heat. Also, added some fresh cut garlic and us.ed less garlic powder. Everyone loved it! I'll be making this every year! Already gave a few jars away to family

Divine!  Thanks, Kiki! I made a few changes to our family's taste: Substituted Chipolte Chili Pepper (McCormick) for the cayenne pepper which gave it a smoky flavor and plenty of heat.  I only used three large jalapenos (4 oz total) with seeds and it still had a great kick. I substituted lime juice for the lemon. Instead of boiling my recipe.  I kept my Roma tomatoes in the boiling water until the skin shriveled slightly to make peeling easier. It gently cooked the tomatoes a little. Instead of mashing, I pulsed in the processor still leaving some substance to the tomatoes. To the chopped tomatoes I added my chopped onion. peppers, cilantro and spices. (I also added 1 TBS sugar) I brought my ingredients up to a simmer then added the chopped fresh tomatoes with skins on and turned off the heat. Tasted very fresh and the color and slight crunch is perfect. Question, I am a novice at preserving and I am experimenting this summer.  I was wondering if the acidic content of this recipe was enough to qualify as a high acid mixture so it would only be necessary to use a water bath for preserving?  I boiled my jarred salsa 15 minutes in a water bath.  I only used 1/4 cup lime juice. What do you think? Safe? However, I muct say, this salsa might be worth dying for!

this is a no-fail recipe.  i used canned crushed tomatoes one time and whole tomatoes another(tip:  process w/o juice first then add juice to create texture to your liking) & tried it with lemon juice one time & lime another.  each time i made this it was fantastic!  you can add more cilantro or garlic to your taste.  i quartered it and it made plenty for 8 people.

I made two batches.  First time I followed the recipe (seeded all but two jalepenos), although I did use garden tomatoes, so I added two small cans of chopped tomatoes to make up for the water weight of my garden toms.  It turned out great (mild to medium) my 2 and 9 yr. old loved it.  The second batch I made more to my husbands liking (although he enjoyed the milder version too), I didn't measure the jalepenos, I just used the rest from the garden, guessing about 1 1/2 lbs., although I seeded all of them.  I replaced the lemon juice with lime juice (you can't taste the difference) and added minced jarred garlic in addition to the powder (about 2 tsp. jarred garlic.)  I again added about 2 lbs. of chopped canned toms to make up for using the juicier garden toms.  All other ingredients remained the same.  This second batch was on the hot side.  My 2 and 9 yr. will still eat it, but very sparingly (and with a glass of milk!)  My husband loves it!  Keep in mind, when using juicer garden tomatoes it WILL need to boil longer to remove some of the extra liquid.  A food processor makes very quick (and tearless) work of chopping the onions and peppers.  I did can both batches I made, although I don't think it will last long.  Definately keeping this salsa recipe for next years tomato harvest!  Much better than the first recipe I used two years ago!

This salsa should come with a warning...delicious, but SUPER HOT!!!!  When you grow tomatoes, there comes a point where you have more than you can eat or give away. I didn't weigh the tomatoes, so not sure if I used a full 6 lbs, but I used a lot. AND scaled back on the hot stuff... only 4 jalapenos and only 1 with seeds. It was inedible by me (husband loved it though and friend said it cured her cold and sinus blockage) until I diluted with a few more matos.  Now, there is also a point at the end of the season when you get lots of green tomatoes...my plants had a fungus or something preventing them from growing large, so had a ton of little green 'matos. I used this recipe again with the greenies to slice and red to puree and was just as good (scaled down). But, some people have an aversion to green matos, so don't tell them.. they will think just peppers. Also VERY IMPORTANT!!! Wear gloves. The jalapenos will stay in your skin burning anything you touch for days. Mix that with the acid from matos... ouch. And... DON"T TOUCH YOUR FACE.. esp. mouth or eyes when working with peppers.. this may be a no brainer to some, but I learned the hard way!!

Excellent! This was my first time making salsa and it turned out perfect. I did make a few alterations though. I only used 3 lbs of peeled and crushed tomatoes. I did not drain them, but combined them with 1 can of Spaghetti sauce. I used 4 cloves of fresh  garlic, instead of the powder. I added some fresh parsley in with the cilantro. I don't like things too spicy, so I only added 2 jalapeno peppers and included the seeds for one of the peppers. It was plenty hot for me! 
Also, I added 2 green bell peppers and 3 red bell peppers. I just chopped them up small and added them in with the onions. 
It looks exactly like store bought salsa, but tastes even better!

Loved this!  I took the author's suggestion to roast the peppers in the oven before seeding and chopping and it was delicious.  Also added less onion (only 3/4 of 1 yellow onion, no red, no white).  Adjusted to 4 banana peppers and 9 jalepenos, as that is what we picked from our garden.  PLENTY spicy for us.  Lastly we added 2- 6oz. cans of no salt added tomato paste as we like a thicker consistency.  Terrific starter recipe and easy to adapt to your family's taste.

It just tasted bad. I did exactly what it said to do, and still, no one liked it. This is coming from a family who hasn't met a salsa they don't like besides this one.

This salsa was very good, thumbs up from the whole family. BUT I only used 2 large hot peppers without seeds and it came out very hot! I think next time I'll cut the Cayenne in half and add more peppers without seeds. I think fresh garlic would also be better.

Great recipe!  I added a 1/4 cup of white wine vinegar and the juice of a lime to increase acidity so I could process it into cans. I also added more jalapenos and 1/2 with seeds to increase the heat.  We like salsa extra hot.  The intention was to make jars to give away for the holidays.  I just noticed that my teenage son and husband are sneaking jars for themselves...  I can tell that they will be gone by the end of the month.  Looks like I'll be making another batch!

This has become my "what am I going to do with all these tomatoes" recipe. Especially because it disappears so fast. I use what I have harvested, but the spices remain the same. i.e. for peppers I use my roasted and frozen anaheim and jalapenos. Yellow onions only because thats what I grow etc etc. Limes because the lime tree if full of them. The Key is the balance of seasonings. Its perfect. A WONDERFUL harvest time recipe!!

Fantastic!! Quartered the recipe to try it. We made a few adjustments...fresh garlic for powder, added green pepper, used 5 seeded jalapenos and 1 with seeds. And added corn from 2 cobs. Quite a bit of spice, very flavourful. Will definitely make this again, thanks for sharing!

Good, fresh salsa recipe.  Personally, I wish I hadn't followed the recommendations to cut down the jalepenos and seeds so much because it ended up not being very hot, but still good!

Made this last nite and took to work this morning.  Everyone loves it!  I did cut down on the jalepenos to just over half a pound and used fresh chopped garlic "the heads".   We like garlic!  Also used lime juice instead of lemon. Will make again and again.

I find it odd that I'm only one of a few who has rated this below 5 stars! This just wasn't our cup of tea.  It was too sour and mushy and not what I expect from homemade salsa.  This tastes eerily similiar to jarred salsa (re: Pace Picante).  Definately will not make this recipe again.

Fantastic.  We cut the jalapenos in half and only used the seeds from two like someone suggested.  We still found it at least medium in intensity and we like spicy food.  

What a great way to use up all of the tomatoes from our garden.  And I plan to freeze a batch of this salsa as well.

This was wonderful. I canned 4 quarts. My sisters and I will be canning a bunch of it this summer in tomato season. I made a few changes. I used chopped fresh garlic instead of powder. I used lime juice instead of lemon, and instead of a whole tablespoon of cayenne , I used a half tablespoon of cayenne and a half tablespoon of chipotle. Gave it a great smoky flavor. Thanks Kikiwood.

boil for 20 min in the hot canning jars (which have been boiled for 20 min).  With 1 tbsp of lime juice in each jar for small jars.  I have yet to try them, this is just a preliminary note to myself.

Whoa!  First of all, I used about 1/4 of the jalapenos (no seeds) and this will be too hot for my family.  Second, WAY too much cumin!  This tastes more like chili than salsa!  OK, time for me to go dump a ton of tomatoes into this thing to salvage it...

This was a great recipe! I halved the recipe using fresh produce from my garden. In addition, I used half the amount of jalapenos, roasted them, and used almost all of the seeds. It was the perfect amount of heat.

This is the salsa that you will keep making!  All my friends and family who have tasted it love this salsa.  For chopped tomatoes added to the mix, I like to use chopped cherry tomatoes.  I like to sprinkle some sugar in the mix as well.  6 jalapeno peppers are about the right level of spiciness for me.

Thats some good  salsa.  Most people don't cook theirs, so it's an extra wow when you slap that stuff on the table.  The best.

I loved this recipe!!!  It tastes so fresh and "natural", not like all the dips you find at the supermarket full of conservatives and preservatives.  The only thing I added was a can of tomato paste to make my sauce a deep red. It's hard to get a really red sauce just with tomatoes, it's always pale.

I made this for a dinner party.  Everyone liked it and it made so much I sent leftovers home with everyone.  I did follow some of the reviews and used only a half lb of peppers and only two with seeds and a half Tablespoon of red pepper.  Hint: do not use your hands to deseed the peppers or your fingers will tingle for hours.

Really great recipe! Only flaw was the tomatoes got way too mushy before the onion was cooked; taste is perfect but texture is sadly like spaghetti sauce. Next time I'll saute the onions first. I was out of cilantro but had Chinese mint in the garden so substituted that but it's quite strong so could have used less than I did. I canned most of this recipe and kept enough aside for a truly yummy feast tonight (corn chips with salsa, enchiladas with salsa, mmmm!) I'll definitely be making this again and again!

I loved this recipe.  It was my first try at making (and canning) homemade salsa.  The recipe was easy and it tasted delicious...even better than store bought per my husband.  I added some minced garlic and tossed in some chilli peppers from my garden.  Although it tasted great, next time I plan on chopping the onions and peppers up a bit finer so the overall texture is not so chuncky!

This Salsa is FANTASTIC! It's quite tasty warm. I haven't put it in the fridge yet. I didn't have enough fresh tomatoes so I substituted some canned ones as suggested by another user. I will definitely use this again!

Wonderful and flavorful salsa! We only used 4 jalapeños and only left one with seeds based on other reviews. I also included 4 seeded Anaheim peppers. We roasted the peppers and peeled them because we don't like the skin left on. We used 7 cloves of chopped garlic rather than the garlic powder and also added 1 Tbsp sugar.  We boiled the salsa down to a thicker consistency and came up with 5 1/2 pints total. The picture makes this look much thicker than it actually is, so be advised. Well worth the work!!

This was my first experience making salsa and I am happy with the result.  I read some of the other reviews and made a few modifications.  I used one red onion and two Vidalia onions, I used 9 jalapeno peppers but only the seeds from 3 of the peppers, and I used 1/4 cup lime juice instead of lemon.  This salsa still packs a little heat with just using the seeds from 3 peppers but it's not overwhelming.  For me, this recipe made a gallon of salsa that I canned into pint jars.  The only other suggestion I would make would be to wear gloves when chopping the jalapenos.  I didn't and my fingers burned and hurt for a long time.

Great Salsa Recipe. I just chunked all mine up like a pico de gallo. And canned all of this. Made 2 batches, and only used 1/2 Jalapeno's and the heat was just right. Now my Jalapenos were home grown so I think they were a bit hotter than what you buy. I used 3/4 of the onion mixture only.. Lots of onions. Used all the same spices and it was really good.. Loved it!!!!! Will make more as soon as I get more tomatoes! Oh each batch make 7 pints for 6 pounds of tomatoes and all the goodies that went into it... TY for sharing your recipe....

Everyone loved it! I was worried about the heat so I split the salsa in two batches and omitted the jalapenos in one batch just to be safe. I also skipped the cumin altogether. I liked the batch with jalapenos better. They add a very nice flavor. You can control the heat by omitting the seeds or only adding the seeds from a few peppers. The diced tomatoes definitely give the salsa a nice texture and fresh look. I will be making this again very soon and I plan on growing tomatoes this year so I can make salsa all summer! This recipe is a keeper!

Delicious salsa!!  Followed the advice of some other posts, and cut it down to 1/2 lb of the jalepenos, and it just wasn't hot enough.  Next time I will do the whole pound and maybe 2 habaneros. Wouldn't change anything about this recipe!

HOT HOT HOT!  We like hot food so this is good for us, but next time I might cut down the cayenne pepper and hope it's that much better.  I didn't add the cumin or cilantro as I think I'm the only person on the planet that doesn't like cilantro, but still got rave reviews!

A pound of jalapenos would make this extremely hot! I doubled the recipe and used 1 chili pepper instead of 2 lbs of jalapenos and it is hot enough for me. I also added a bell pepper and a bit of corn. Very good. I have 32 tomato plants in my garden this year and I think I will be using this recipe a lot. I'd give it 4.5 stars because of the extreme amount of jalapenos and because I like a bit more chunky vegetables in my salsa like corn and bell pepper, which I easily added.

This is my first attempt at homemade salsa and it tastes great.  I didn't start with 6 pounds of roma tomatoes.  I worked backwards by coring, removing the seeds and draining the water to get to 6 pounds and it yielded close to 1.5 gallons.  I used fresh garlic, lime juice as well and fresh minced cayenne peppers.  Can't wait to make it again next summer only I will be prepared to can it.

Excellent! This was my first time making homemade salsa, and this recipe was exactly what I was looking for! I used fresh garlic rather than powder, and omitted the red onion, however I'm sure it would have been great if added.  The salsa is the perfect texture and flavor.

I was given 16lbs of tomatoes from friends and family and was wondering what I could possibly do with them all. Used 8lbs to make this and Im so glad. We go through salsa like no other at our house and this is way better then the fresh stuff we buy at the store. I love cilantro and garlic so I used a full bunch of cilantro and fresh garlic instead of powder. Used lime juice for lemon and only had a few jalapenos on hand so it doesnt quite have that strong kick I like, but my 2 year old loves it so I guess thats all that matters!

This salsa has good flavor, but is too hot for me. I added more crushed tomatoes, lemon juice and some sugar to try to cool it down. I will make it again, but with less cayenne and jalapenos. It is very forgiving and you can add and subtract ingredients.

This is fantastic!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and used 1/2 lb of jalapenos with the seeds from three, used fresh yellow and red tomatoes from my garden, cut back on the cayenne and salt just a bit, and used lime juice instead of lemon.  This has a fantastic flavor, I canned most of it...hopefully it won't kill me :)

I didn't boil or peel anything. I grinded everthing in my food processor, adding the tomatoes last, just pulsing those to desired consistency.  I used less jalapenos and no seeds, 86ing the cayenne too.  YUMMY and oh so FRESH!

Finally, I have found the right salsa recipe for me. This is wonderful! I scaled my recipe to make 18 servings (or about a weeks worth for us). I followed the recipe except doubling the cumin (I love cumin) and adding a dash more garlic than called for in my 18 servings. I only used one jalapeno. This salsa is a little spicy, but exactly what I was looking for! Thank you so much for sharing this fabulous recipe!!

I'm cookinmon's hubby, and I made this recipe for the first time. I must say I was impressed with the way it turned out. I too, cut back on the number of peppers and instead added one of my wicked hot home grown haboneros. I added 1Tblsp of fresh garlic and 2 Tblsp of sugar as well. I consider myself a "salsa snob" and this recipe humbled me.

the best homemade salsa.  I cut down on the peppers as other people said,  used half a bunch of cilantro, and it was very good.  BF is not a salsa and chip fan and he keeps eating it on me. 

I froze mine and it tastes good just as good defrosted. (I made it not as chunky for this reason)

This is a very tasty salsa.  I cut back on the Jalepenos and used 3/4 lb, still a little hot but not too bad. It's missing something, so maybe next time I will add red and green peppers to it.  Definitly a great salsa.

Excellent salsa.  I used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder and cut back on the jalapenos per the suggestion of previous users.

This is a very good recipe and very easy. I will be making it again. My grocery store had no fresh jalepenos when I went so used Anaheim peppers, still good. User error is I overdid the cilantro so be careful on that unless you are a fan.

This is a great, flavorful and SPICY salsa! As others, I seeded some of the jalapenos but think next time I'll adjust the ratio for an even milder taste. Either way, I enjoyed this and if you like it hot, you'll love it!

This is fantastic--my family loves it!  I removed all the pepper seeds and it still has a great flavor, but quite a bit of afterburn.  In fact, I made a second batch with Anaheim peppers and blended them together and canned them for winter. YUM!

Forget about store bought, this IS my salsa recipes from now on.  The flavors of this salsa are a perfect blend.  It's a bit time consuming peeling the tomatoes, but WELL WORTH the effort.  Besides, I just love playing in the kitchen...........anyone wanting to try a new salsa recipe should definitely try this one, and use the canned crushed tomatoes if boiling and peeling seem too time consuming.............YUM

Wonderful. I halfed the recipe and it made plenty. Next time, after removing the skins, I will put the tomatoes in the blender so that I don't have so large of chunks.

This is my go to recipe for salsa.  I use it for canning salsa to have year round.   The only changes I make are to reduce the heat because we don't like spicy food.

There was a lot of tasting and seasons were added to taste. I don’t know how much I added of what. I canned it, then went through them all in a few days. Highly recommend with lightly lime chips! Best combination. I love this recipe!

This is my favorite salsa recipe.  I have made it several times using tomatoes from the garden.  I can several quarts a year.  Be careful with the peppers.  I never add the whole amount, but even still it can get really hot, depending on the heat of the individual peppers.  The flavor is wonderful!

I made this! I seeded all the jalapeños. Instead of fresh tomatoes, I used can tomatoes, 3-28 oz petite diced and 1-28 oz chopped tomatoes. Still I didn't have any heat, but the flavor is great! I chopped 4 Serrano peppers and added after the cooking process. It was fantastic!

This is a fantastic base recipe that makes salsa with a consistency similar to salsa in a jar (rather than the typical homemade ones that are just chopped veggies w/ no sauciness).  I scaled down the recipe and have made twice - both times only using red onion and omitting the white & yellow.  I don't like onions, but understand they're needed in salsa, so I soaked my chopped red onion in water for 15 minutes to take out some of the sting, and then ended up boiling my salsa over an hour to get it a bit less runny which also helped the onions to blend in.  My two batches were very different from one another due to the tomatoes I used in each (2nd batch was sweet due to many baby tomatoes used from the garden).  This is easily my go-to recipe to use up garden tomatoes and please a crowd!

I am giving this five stars because I did not follow the recipe exactly. I used cherry tomatoes instead of roma (I had a butt load of them from my garden) the texture was off. I am guessing from using the cherry tomatoes. The taste was good.

I was glad to find this recipe, I have used it before but lost my copy. I also reduced the number of jalapeños, and got into habit of cooking longer. I will simmer it for 3 or 4 hrs. If the taste seems not quite right, add more cumin powder.

Very good, but way too many peppers. A five star recipe with the following modifications. 
I made some changes to simplify the process, and reduce the heat for a kid friendly version.

All fresh ingredients (excepting tomatoes) are chopped coarsely in a food processor.

I modified the ingredients to a single large jalapeño pepper and only a teaspoon of cayenne to satisfy the mild tastes of my family, and added minced garlic cloves.

I put all ingredients into a large crock pot on high heat for 3 hours, and then mash in the pot with a potato masher.
Remove the lid and leave on high to reduce the moisture level to the desired consistency.  Mash once more to reduce any reminding large tomato pieces.

Refrigerate portion to be consumed fresh, and can the rest while still hot.

I made this salsa because jar salsa is hard to find in Costa Rica and I needed it for an enchilada recipe I was trying.  I was really surprised how well this came out even though I made a few changes.  Besides scaling it down to 8 servings, the changes I made were the addition of minced garlic, no cayenne because I did not have any and I did not cook it….I just used it uncooked.  It was so good that this will now be my “go to” recipe when I need a salsa for chips or cooking!  Thank you so much for sharing!

Delicious!  But it definitely only takes 3 jalapeños to make it hot.  I can't imagine a pound!  I like mild salsa.  Follow the recipe, but add only 3 jalapeños for a mild salsa.

I have made this recipe several times. With and without the jalapeno. Both are excellent. I use this mostly as a good way to get my veggies in on a daily basis so therefore no jalapeno. But when I made for a party, yes to jalapeno. I buy discounted tomatoes because they are always very ripe.

This was excellent.  I made a half batch and canned it.  I used lime juice instead of lemon.  I didn't use any cayenne pepper or cumin because I didn't have those on hand, but I did use just a dash of smoked paprika.  I used 2 garlic cloves instead of powered garlic.  I used only white onion because that's all I had on hand.  I used about twice the amount of fresh cilantro it called for and thought it could use a bit more of that even.  I didn't put any jalapenos seed or membranes in it so that it wouldn't be too hot.  I gave them 25 minutes in a hot water bath to can them.  It was just perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

Best salsa I have ever had! I used some organic heirloom tomatoes instead of roma tomatoes, and also omitted the red pepper and added fresh cayenne peppers instead.

 I also followed the recommendation to roast the peppers before adding them, and it was delicious! I canned about 10 jars, and my only regret is that I didn't make more. Will definitely be making next year as well.

Made a whole gallon of this recipe, added fresh garlic and anaheim peppers instead of jalapenos, it was absolutely wonderful. Family couldn't stop eating it. Was gone in only 2 days- there are a lot of us. Best salsa I've ever tasted.

Very good. I used regular tomatoes from the garden. I did seed them first. I didn't cook it very long because it started to get juicy. We really liked this salsa.

I made about 6 batches of this salsa with a bumper crop of tomatoes two years ago and it has been a hit with everyone I shared it with.  I blend my tomatoes slightly in a blender or food processor because we like the consistency better.  This is now my "go to" recipe.

This was the first salsa I ever made that was cooked.  I usally make the super fresh kind like you get in restraunts but my hubby had been asking for a kind more like the kind you buy in jars.  So I made this.  I used 2 habanaros, 2 chilis and 4 jalapenos.  I only used one onion though.  It turned out just like I was hoping for.  The consistancy of a store bought jarred salsa with lots of heat!

Awesome!  First recipe I've actually rated/reviewed from AllRecipes!  Nearly perfect as is, but I did follow the suggestion from other reviewers to use only 1/2lb of jalapenos and seeds from only 3 of them.  The spice level is perfect now.  I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have been able to eat it had I used more than that. This is just the type of salsa I was hoping for...a smoother restaurant style salsa instead of the chunky stuff.  Awesome!

HOLY SMOKES! This is so hot! This is the only reason I gave it 4 stars. My hubby loves spicy, so it was great for him. This was a little too spicy for me! But if you're going for quantity this is the recipe. This made a TON of salsa. The only thing I did different was to add a bunch of green onions, a teaspoon of coriander. I didn't bother boiling any of the tomatoes. Just used my food processor. Super easy, and really good. I would just take out the cayenne and a few of the peppers next time!

Just made this salsa for Cinco De Mayo. This is great! Made a couple changes. I only made 1/2 of the recipe. I only put in 2 jalepenos without seeds. I boiled tomatoes and peeled skin. Then I chopped them in food processor. I also chopped everything else in the food processor. I added minced garlic and 2 teaspoons sugar. My roma tomatoes from store were not very sweet.   This salsa turned out great! I am sure my guest are going to eat it all up.

Love this salsa! This is the first time I've ever made salsa and was surprised at how easy it is. Did make some changes to the recipe. I took the advice of other reviewers and decreased the jalapenos to one pepper, used one large Anaheim pepper, plus used lime juice instead of lemon. Next time will try lemon as I suspect it might give it a just little more zip. Also added a couple dashes of sugar as suggested. Didn't have cumin, so used some chili powder which turned out to be a really good idea. Also added a few drops of tabasco-type sauce for flavor, fresh garlic, and a splash of juice from a jar of peppercinis. I did not cook anything. Left the peels on the tomatoes, quartered them and put them in my simple little chopper gizmo, a handy Black and Decker thing that I got on Amazon for about 14.00. It's just great for doing small food processor type things, and it made very quick work of chopping the tomatoes, onions, peppers, and garlic. The salsa turned out fantastic, and no cooking required! Thanks for a great recipe!

This is as good as our local Mexican place. The only 2 things I changed (other than scaling down to 24 servings since I don't can) was that I used fresh garlic (Alton Brown said garlic powder cannot develop in the presence of acid?) and I put in some honey because it was bitter (perhaps because I didn't seed the jalapenos?). Absolutely top notch.

I had a bumper crop of tomatoes this year, and made 4 batches of this stuff! Bagged it all up, put it in the freezer, and we're thawing out at least a bag a week. Everyone loves this stuff!! I'm not even a big salsa fan and I can't get enough.

This salsa is excellent.  It does take awhile to make, but the end result is worth it.  Even my father liked it and he is very hard to please.  The only thing I changed was I used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder and added it when I added the onions.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Very good! My family loves this recipe. If you don't like it too spicy try seeding the jalapenos. I seeded all my jalapenos & it was just enough spice for us. And, yes, I used all of the jalapenos. The only other thing I did different was I did NOT boil everything down. I chopped everything up real fine and kept it fresh. YUM!!!(Just to clarify I did boil the 6 lbs. tomatoes and mashed them up.)

My brother asked for salsa that tasted like the kind our local Mexican restaurant served. I made this recipe and he was shocked! It was so delicious! Wonderfully easy to adjust to heat according to your taste. Simply adjust the cayenne pepper and perhaps add an extra or take away a jalapeno pepper. I also blended mine since we don't prefer the chunks. Perfect! Thank you!

I wanted a peach salsa recipe (for chips not grilling) and could not find one, so I took this one, added equal amounts of tomatoes as peaches.  I omitted the red onion since I did not have one.  I did not seed my jalapenos -well it got REALLY hot, but I just doubles everything else and now it is great - nice flavor and a great kick!  I added about 1/4 of sugar too.  Thanks!!

just what I wanted! I used canned tomatoes, fresh garlic, doubled the cilantro and omitted the cumin. I didn't have any jalapeno on hand so I crumbled in some dried chillies to taste. Let it sit for an hour and added some diced chicken. Fabulous!

This recipe is very good.  I didn't change much.  I only used vidalia onions and I upped the cumin to suit my own tastes. I also used lime instead of lemon because I like the lemon in my guacamole instead. TFS!!

OMG, this is soooo yummy!!  Just like my favorite mexican restaurants!!  I made a half batch because I thought it would make too much, but honestly, I don't think I was even close to the 3/4 gallon a half batch should have made.  I used fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder and only used 4 jalapenos without the seeds. It was mild-medium, so will use the seeds of one jalapeno next time to spice it up.  Thanks so much!  I absolutely LOVE the recipe!!

I've made this salsa on two ocassions and both times everyone has raved about it!  Not only is it easy, it's delicious.  I usually cut the jalapenos to 1/2 lb. so it's more on the mild side.  This recipe also makes a TON, so halving it would be plenty for a normal get-together.  Enjoy!

I have made a lot of salsas, this is the best!  I used garden tomatoes and cut back on the jalapenos (we don't like it real hot) and it was great.  I also used a couple of cloves of fresh garlic instead of the powder!  Great recipe!

I was using up end of the garden items so I had a mixture of plum and regular tomatoes.  I also used hot banana peppers instead of jalepenos.  I followed everything else exactly and ended up with a medium/hot salsa that is a big hit at our house.  I'll be making more today to can.  The food processor is a great time saver from hand chopping all the peppers and onions.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is the best!!!  It was so addicting, I ate a quart jar in one sitting : )  It's easy to adjust peppers, onions, etc... to suit your taste.  I used fresh crushed garlic and it was awesome!  Had many requests for this salsa.  I canned my salsa and instead of lasting through the winter, it was gone by October! (37 Quarts worth)

VERY good! It made enough that I could share with my neighbors and they all loved it too. Very easy. I put the amount of peppers in but only the seeds and membrane from 3-4. It was moderately hot. I also left it chunky, which is the way we prefer it - but you could easily puree the whole thing.

Like many of the other reviewers, I also made salsa for the first time using this recipe.  I was a little hesitant to make it since I had never made salsa before.  It was fantastic!  If you like spicy salsa, you'll love this recipe.

Good flavor but a little too hot for my household.  I will make it again but next time I will cut back on the ground cayenne.  I figure after it cooks for a little while I can add more if needed.

Great recipe!  I halved the recipe and still made plenty.  As previously mentioned it is VERY spicy as written.  Perfect for my husband, a little much for me, way too much for those who prefer more mild heat.  Next time I'd probably use 1/2 to 3/4 of the called for jalapeños.  I ended up doubling the cumin, adding a little black pepper, and adding a generous dose of lime juice.  I liked the idea of charring the jalapeños another reviewer mentioned but I was feeling lazy so at the last second I added a couple small dashes of liquid smoke just to give it that edge.  To save myself work I started by cutting the onions and jalapeños into large chunks and dropping them in the food processor with the cilantro and lemon juice instead of cutting them up.  I then transferred the onion mixture to my pot and processed the whole peeled tomatoes to the desired consistency and added them to the onion mixture with the seasonings.  Super easy, delicious, and great for canning- a half batch made exactly 4 pints.

I definitely wouldn't add the sugar. I also went low on the heat and it was still plenty hot. It tasted - ok- but more like what you'd buy in the store. Maybe I just prefer a more fresh salsa.

I think this recipe is original. It should goes well with all kind of Mexican dishes. One only thing I made changes was I used Lime juice instead of Lemon juice.  I personally LOVE the taste when it mixed with cilantro.

This is the best salsa recipe I have found. I followed the advice of the other reviewers and only used half of the jalapenos. I also halved the recipe, and it still made quite a bit. I simmered the mixture for about 15 minutes on medium heat, and I really enjoyed the consistency. I think next time I'll crush fewer of the tomatoes and dice a couple more (I prefer my salsa a little chunky). I might also do a little less jalapeno since it was pretty spicy. But I will definitely make this recipe again!

It's super easy! I ended up not putting any cilantro coz I didn't have em in my fridge. But I switched the lemon juice to 1/2 lemon juice 1/2 apple cider vinegar and it still worked just as well!

This is my families favorite salsa recipe. I tried many others before this became my standard. The missing star is because as written, this salsa is way too hot! We like things hot, but I never use a pound of jalapeños! Jalapeños can vary a lot in temperature, but even with seeds removed a pound is too many. The only other change I make is to use more cilantro than called for. I rough blend the tomatoes in my Ninja to achieve the perfect texture. Delicious!

This is a very good recipe as is and as a base.  I've been trying various changes including making it more chunky or a lot less chunky.  I've added black bean, corn, and other veggies I like.  I have settled on half and half where I use Romano tomatoes for a chunkiness and I'll puree' any ripe, garden variety tomato I have at my disposal.  I'll puree' half of the onion too, but leave the other half chunky.   I noticed that I can use ALOT less jalapeno's for spice and flavor if I puree just one or two of those.   Otherwise, for color and chunkiness, I'll use what the recipe says.  People just like it.  Give it a try.

My family and I really enjoyed this salsa recipe. My son doesn't like any heat whatsoever so I did not add jalapeño peppers but instead added red, orange and yellow peppers and the turn out was a slightly sweet salsa. YUM!

I've made this recipe twice now. It has a really nice flavor, but is a bit mushy. Next time, I'll boil the mixture short of being soft and let it rest off the heat. Like so many salsas, it's better after a day or two in the fridge.

This is a delicious salsa recipe!  My daughters & I made it last weekend & we love it!  My husband who is rather picky, was very impressed with us & the recipe!  
I read thru the reviews & we made a few changes, but only because we don't like it too hot. Oh, and we used fresh garlic, like a whole bulb worth! 
We cooked it for about three hours so it would thicken, too. 
Thank you Kikiwood, most amazing Salsa!!

also worth noting, even the full recipe only makes like 1 gal of salsa MAX, more like 3/4 gallons

I have to say that this is the best salsa that I have ever had. I did change a few things because of my family's taste. Instead of so many jalapenos, I just used four, instead of 3 onions I used 1 yellow onion ad 5 green onions. Also, I have a HUGE crop of Pink Brandy-wine tomatoes so I used those, and this complimented their super rich tomato flavor. I have made 2 batches in 2 days. Took it for Saturday Dinner at my family's and everyone couldn't get enough THANK YOU!!!

Really great recipe!  And easy too!  I just made this salsa with all the Roma tomatoes from my garden and it came out great.  I decided to forgo the cayenne pepper and only used the seeds from about half the jalapenos - the level of spiciness was perfect for my tastes.  I will definitely be making this again.

Excellent flavor. Sweet at first taste and then just enough heat to follow it up. Jars have kept VERY WELL over the winter. This will be my go to recipe this next harvest.

Great recipe that I used to can all of our garden tomatoes. I'm pretty sure I didn't use the amount of jalepeno it called for, I just eyeballed it and used what I thought would add enough spice but still have my kids eating it. Everyone who has had this (adults and children) has really enjoyed it.

BEST SALSA EVER! I've been making salsa for years but this is the best I've ever had/made. I canned it. Used lime juice instead of lemon. Used chipotle pepper instead of the cayenne. Jalapenos to taste. For a mild batch (for kids) I didn't add jalapenos at all and they loved it! Great smoky flavor with the chipotle. Will be tossing out my old recipes and keeping this one!

This is a great basic recipe for salsa.  I made a few minor changes to suit my taste and to use up some veggies from my garden, and it turned out great!!  This is a must-have recipe if you are a salsa fan.

I can only assume the other reviewers know something i don't. I only used 1/2lb japalenos per other reviews. Only used the seeds from one of them per other reviews, and ended up with a bowl full of excruciatingly hot, flavorless, inedible slop. So i'm willing to accept that i must have done something wrong, but the recipe is so simple i just can't imagine what.

Again half the jalapenos but I have kids to share it with - otherwise i'd have gone the full-fledged route!;) Loved it. I'm gonna try to can it this season so I'll have it all year long.

WOW - this was amazing!  I halved the recipe as I don't need a gallon of salsa, cut back on the peppers a bit and only used white onions.  I did boil the tomatoes to help remove the skin but otherwise put everything in the blender to puree it.  Super Yummy!  You can't go wrong however you adjust the main recipe so have fun and experiment!!!  I served it with the 'Baked Tortilla Chips' recipe which were delicious. Again, adjusted this recipe to only use oil, lime juice and salt.    Bon Appetite!

Only gave this one four stars because it is waaaay too hot!!  And I only used 4 jalapenos and the seeds of just one.  Anyone who likes a medium or mild salsa-reduce cayanne and jalapenos!!  Otherwise this is great and I will make again.

We loved this.  My boyfriend brought it to work and said most thoought it was the best salsa they have ever tried.  He doesn't like chunky salsa, so I pretty much pureed it in a food processor.

i didn't add the white onion, and it wasn't needed. i wound up adding a whole can of diced tomatoes and lime juice instead of lemon. my husband loves this salsa -- i think it's average (he's mexican and i grew up here in texas -- it doesn't make us experts but it does mean we've eaten a lot of salsa). next time i will add the tomatoes to the onion, jalepeno, etc, cold so there is some crispness to the salsa.

This salsa turned out very watery for me.  I should have squeezed off some of the juices from the tomatoes first, or let it cook down more.

Perfect blend of flavors and spice!  Not too hot but leaves a bit of heat in your mouth.  The consistancy is wonderful and the variety of onions used made for a very unique flavor.  The only things we added were a can of black beans and an ear's worth of fresh corn.  Oh, and left out the cilantro because my husband hates it.  Very, very good salsa!

This salsa is delicious! I decreased the jalepenos & replaced the cilantro with parsley. The only thing I'll do different next time is let the tomatoes drain on a paper towel before boiling for a half an hour, due to the fact that they create so much juice while boiling. Thanks so much for such a delicious recipe!

This Salsa is so easy to make. After first tasting the Salsa I was drifting of to my vacation in Mexico. I never though I would be able to make such good Salsa, but thanks to this recipe I can. I have already used the Salsa in different recipe Cowboy Chicken. This turned out lovely as well!

Spicy and delicious! I had to improvise somewhat with what kinds of onions I had on hand, etc, but it came out great. Normally I make "D's Texas Salsa" (I believe that's the name) from allrecipes and I love that. This is a good alternate. They have different flavor profiles for sure. I have gotten where I cannot stand canned salsa from the store and make my own batch every couple weeks. This is definitely in the rotation. Husband loves it too.

oh my god, so easy and so good!!  i added about a quarter of a cup of sugar, to give it a little sweetness, and added a can of corn and some chopped-up peppers from my girlfriend's garden.  i think i needed to add more spiceyness to the tomatoes mixture, though - the heat was a little uneven.

All in all this recipe is very good.  I personally thought it was pretty hot & that was after leaving the cayenne pepper out & taking the seeds out of the jalapenos. Used garden tomatoes & added some canned chopped tomatoes to bring the heat down a little to my tastes.  Boyfriend wished I would have let him try it before adding the extra tomatoes - next time.   My first try at salsa & this recipe is a keeper - definitely better than boughten.

I used this recipe but found it difficult to determine the amount of jalapenos to put in (I don't have a kitchen scale). I decided to use 4, two with seeds, two without. They were fairly large in size. The salsa turned out great, could've had a little more kick, but not bad for my first run. Don't be afraid to make small changes to the quantities in this recipe.

This is an awesome recipe!  I used this recipe for my FACS class.  It was easy to modify to students taste.  Best of all the students had fun and enjoyed eating it.

Not the flavor I was hoping for.  Needed something more, salt or garlic?  The jalapeno pepper flavor was a little overpowering. Texture was good and recipe was easy.

Great tasting.  I used some serrano chilis and some habaneros and it was a tad too spicy even for my husband's taste.  The flavor was great though. I'll definitely try it again and modify the heat a little.

The taste of the final product is greeat, we substituted your standard garden variety of tomatoes fresh picked, and increased the amount by two pounds due to standard tomatoes have less meat to them than the plum, we cut the peppers down to 3/4 Lb and increased the garlic to 4 Tbs but other than that everything else remained the same.  Can't wait to make a second batch to play with the heat content a little more.  Great recipe Thanks for sharing it

I served this warm and it tasted great.  Followed exact recipe, but left out the jalepeno seeds to keep it on the mild side.

This is a delicious salsa! The cilantro really does it.  We are done buying big name brand salsas. The only thing I changed was to add one clove of fresh garlic as well. I used canned tomatoes and it still turned out great.

Great recipe; it was excellent.  We used fresh tomatoes the first time and canned tomatoes the second time.  Both were good and fresh tasting but using the canned tomatoes was a lot easier.  Thanks for the recipe; we will never buy canned salsa again.

This was the first time I've ever tried making home made salsa and it is great.  I'll never go back to store bought again.

This salsa made a big hit with my husband's friend at our Bar-B-Q this week-end.

I think my biggest issue is that I made this in a hurry.  I was out of salsa, had guests coming, had all the ingredients and do time to go to the store.  The flavor was good and I would say suitable for someone who doesn't like a lot of heat in a salsa.  It was popular with my guests but just was not hot enough for me.  I will definitely be tweaking it to my tastes because it was a good springboard towards a GREAT salsa.
