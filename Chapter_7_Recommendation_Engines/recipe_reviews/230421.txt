People really enjoyed this at the Labor Day BBQ where I served it. Great peach flavor and very refreshing.

Well I couldn't make this with the peach juice because I couldn't find it so I made it with pineapple pear juicy juice and pineapple juice, with sprite and pineapple chunks, it was delicious!! I hope I can find the peach juice some where because I think that would be even better! Thank you for the recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly (added all peach juice did not do one can at a time). Did not have raspberries so just floated peaches in the punch bowl. My family LOVED it. This will be a Thanksgiving favorite!

Tastes great, but I did have to scale it down quite a bit.

Loved this punch. I used cran-peach juice  and added the peach juice like the recipe said.  It was very good.
