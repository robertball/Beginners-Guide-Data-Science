I think the recipe should call for beating the egg whites separately and then folding it in. That would make the texture better. The cake itself had large holes and not good for petit four icing (you could see the holes). It also tasted like eggs.

The consistency of this cake was great...but I think it tastes like a sugar cookie.  No real flavoring, just sugar.  Maybe less sugar and some sort of extract??  I'm not sure.  I will try it again, though, because I love how dense it is--perfect for cake decorating.

I tried this recipe twice, and both times it didn't work for me. There was no flavor to it, so I did add vanilla, and quite a bit, but there was still no flavor. Also, it was very hard to get the batter evenly into the pan as it was very sticky. I also couldn't get the cake cut evenly because I couldn't get it in the pan evenly. It crumbled and broke easily. I've been doing cakes for 25 years and haven't come up against one that was this difficult to work with.

This is a great recipe. Sponge cake for the most part doesn't have much flavor. But the great thing about it is you can add to it. Whether it is chocolate, or minced lemon zest. This recipe came out great for me. and was to die for with my marzipan frosting!

Not a winner in my book. The cake was too heavy and had no favor.

I found this recipe to be too flimsy for petits fours.  A more substantial cake is needed stand up to cutting without crumbing so that when you pour the fondant over them, they stay nice and smooth. I think the best bet is a moist pound cake recipe.

Very good, a little dry but overall very yummy. I made them for my french classes Food Day and they were gone by the time it was over! I will be making these again, but will use frosting and fondant instead of chocolate icing and almond paste. Thanks for posting this recipe!

Lacked flavor and the consistency of the cake was more like a cookie.  Not impressed with this one.
