My husband ate almost the entire thing by himself. I didn't have chili powder, black beans, or salsa on hand so I subbed taco sauce for the salsa and omitted the beans and chili powder and it still tasted amazing!

This was really good! We love tacos and burritos, but this was a nice change of pace while still satisfying that craving! I used all cheddar cheese since that's  all I had.

My family loved it. Only thing I changed was not adding salt and chili powder. I did put salsa on bottom of pan, shells were nice and soft. Thank you for a great dish!

This is a favorite Taco Tuesday dish in my house. I've made it quite a few times.

Very tasty.  Next time I will cut back the salt; there is plenty in the taco seasoning, so another teaspoon isn't necessary.  I haven't seen the 3 oz package of cream cheese in years, so I just used half of an 8 oz block.  I put some salsa on the bottom to keep the shells from sticking.  I think using an entire 16 oz jar instead of just half of it would work out just fine and help keep the shells covered so they don't get overly crispy.

I used noodles instead of stuffing shells and it turned out great!
