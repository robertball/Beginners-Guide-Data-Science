This is a great dish! I was looking for a scalloped potato recipe, wanting to get away from the traditional gratins using yellow cheese, and stumbled upon this. It's kind of a cross between a scalloped and a gratin, and is absolutely heavenly. I made it exactly as the recipe says and it came out perfect. I didn't add or change a thing and it was exactly what I was looking for.

I cooked for a total of two hours and it was still very soupy.  If I do it again, I will reduce the liquid and also reduce the onions.  The proportion of onions to potatoes left an overwhelming onion flavor that was much too strong for my taste.

After the glowing reviews, I made this for Christmas.  I did not care for this recipe. I love wine taste in things, but there was way too much in this that it drowned out the cheese.  And the sauce did not thicken up at all and was a watery mess.  Nobody ate it.

Loved it.  However, I used only one onion and then put 3 tablespoons butter with 5 garlic cloves fined chopped - saute - then pour over the top layer of potatoes.  Served with green peppercorn steak - it was perfect.

This was so easy and tasty.  What I loved about this dish was that it did not require canned soup.  I had all the ingredients on hand also.  Was a winner with the family and will definitely make again.

This was a spectacular success!  I added 3 links hot Italian sausage (cooked, crumbled, and very well drained), and used Riesling for the wine.  Instead of using a 9x13 pan, I used 4 smaller individual broiler pans.  Truly an easy and spectacular dish that will absolutely be a regular part of my repertoire.  Thanks, Cindy and Cindy's Grossmutter!

After reading the other reviews, I cut the amount of water and wine in half and stirred the potatoes halfway through baking. The potatoes cooked up nicely and the sauce was thick enough, but I found it to be a little bland. If I make it again, I will add more butter and seasonings.

My husband & I really enjoyed this, nice rich flavour. Imagine 'gourmet' scalloped potatoes with swiss cheese. It was a delicious side with my breaded chicken cordon bleu.
Thanks!

12/18-  If you have more than 10 people, double the recipe.  I doubled it for a Christmas gathering and it takes at least 2.5 hours for the potatoes to be tender if you cut on a mandolin.  I would give yourself 2.5-3 hours to prepare.

Wow, these were so delicious! Made them on Christmas Day, to go with a Prime Rib.  I eliminated the onions and added some extra cheese- swiss/gruyere mixture.  Maybe next time I will use slightly less liquid but they were still a hit!!

Super!  Forgot my recipes on our Christmas trip this year and this site saved me!  My oven required a longer cook time, but otherwise this was just like my recipe at home.  I added some thawed frozen spinach for color! Thanks!

Easy and very tasty.  I sliced the potatoes with the food processor so they were very thin so I didn't cook it for as long.  I used red potatoes ans didn't peel them.  I also used less cream and they were still plenty moist.

Followed directions and ended up with a layer of burnt potato slices on the bottom of the pan.  I tried to salvage the dish by scraping out the center, but even the unburnt parts tasted awful.

This is a pretty decent, simple recipe.  I substituted stock for the wine and it came out nicely.  No real complaints, but it doesn't really WOW in my opinion either.

Instead of wine and water, use 2 cups of heavy cream, only 1 onion, 2 cups of Gruyere Cheese, and 2 lbs of potatoes.  option layer potatoes with 1 14oz can of well drained artichoke hearts.

I loved the dish that I made it would of been 5 stars but the few little changes i did i think would have put it there.  trader joes has gruyere and chedder in one that i used i also probly used a more then what it called for.  I also probly used a little more for the cream and butter for buttering pan. then to top it off after you finished recipe soak some panko it melted butter enough to spread on the top not evenly but enough then in the broiler for a few minutes till the panko turns brow

I loved this dish, but I made a few minor changes having read the other reviews.  I halved the amount of wine, used chicken broth instead of water, halved the amount of onions and baked it without the foil cover for the last 20 minutes before adding the cream.  I've also used smoked gouda in this recipe and it's fantastic!!

I think I originally gave this 4 stars, but now is a five.  One thing to note is that I think the recipe is 1 cup of cheese BEFORE grating.  I did 1 cup grated the first time and it was soupy and bland.  Not this time though.  It was nice and gooey and delicious.  Thank you!

It's a four.  I used twice as much cheese, so it was cheesy enough, but the wine wasn't even worth bothering with in the amount suggested.  My comments aside, everyone had seconds.

This is a very rich gratin. From the gruyere, to the white wine, to the butter, to the cream - this is not for the figure conscious! For me, that doesn't matter when it tastes this good. It is a little on the salty side in my opinion, so be careful with adding too much salt to taste when tossing the potatoes and onions in it.

I don't know what problem other people had but I fix this just like it said to do and only I set it out for 10 minute before serving.  I will be making this for Easter to go with ham.  It is better then scallops.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

Reduced the liquid as suggested and halved it. May have led to some of the potatoes being overlooked but very interesting flavor! I will make this again, for sure!

I added some sliced zucchini to the potatoes and it was a bit saucy at the end.... but the more to soak up with bread : )
