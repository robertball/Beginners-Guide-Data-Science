I cut the butter back by half and added a little salt/fresh ground pepper. Huge hit with the kids. They pretty much inhaled most of this dish on their own. This was a throwback to something my mom used to make for me when I was a kid.

This was light and easy. I used butter spray to saute the green onion and garlic and butter substitute for a lighter finish.

Changed it around.  Used regular onions since I didn't have scallions/green onions, used oregano instead of parsley, minced garlic and butter. I made this a hot dish .. came out really good with Parmesan on top

This was a little bland even with extra garlic. Needs salt and maybe some pepper. I cut back on the amount of butter also.

This was good, but pretty bland. I ended up having to add some salt, pepper and parmesan to kick up the flavors. I scaled the recipe down just for me, and used rotini instead of bow ties. The green onion was a nice addition. Thanks for sharing. :)
