I thought it was really good! I didn't have all that it required so I swapped out the stir-fry sauce for teriyaki, the sherry for red wine, sesame oil for safflower oil and added soy sauce and lime juice.  Then I didn't have cornstarch so I sub'ed with flour.. used chicken instead of pork and didn't add as much cilantro.  haha I guess it is pretty far off from the recipe but it was amazing still!

YUM!  Great use for ground pork!  I didn't have cilantro so I chopped up some bok choy for color.  Also served with some bok choy leaves as well as lettuce.  Very, very, easy.  I'll make this again.

Wow, wow and more wow! I am one happy camper right now. Made this for lunch and cannot believe how simple and quick this was. This is delicious. I omitted the corn starch because I didn't have any but I don't even think you need it. I also substituted brandy for the dry sherry since I was out. Next time, I will up the cilantro amount because I love cilantro or will try the whole cilantro in the wrap thing. This is really good and I found myself picking at the pan and eating it without the lettuce. I think it would also be good served over rice or asian noodle dish. Great stuff. Try it and you will be amazed.

This was ok. Didn't really like the taste of the stir fry sauce and would prefer it with chicken mince instead of pork. I will make again and just play around with the flavours to get something we like. It is a nice light meal and inexpensive to make.

This recipe was delicious.  It tasted just as good as the version you get at chinese restaurants.  I am sure you could use ground chicken as well for this recipes.  I served this with a spicy chili dipping sauce

I just made this for a dinner party, and I don't think it's going to make it out the door! Amazing! The only thing I added was a handful of fried noodles crumbled up for texture- and I am using butter lettuce. Super!!!

I didn't care for the strong flavor of the stir-fry sauce, but loved the ease of the recipe.  I probably will just go back to my old recipe that includes chopping up all the water chestnuts, bamboo shoots & mushrooms.

this was too salty.  I LOVE lettuce wraps, but wouldn't make this again.  Not a very great flavor, and what flavor there was seemed overpowered by the salt.

These were amazing!  We love Lettuce Wraps and regularly make a great Grilled Chicken and Corn recipe with lime-yogurt sauce.  We did not have one with ground meat, so this was perfect.  Used ground turkey and still found them fabulous... will make again and again!

Make this recipe.  It was a perfect combination with the wonderfully rich taste of the meat and the crispy lettuce.  My 2 and 4 year olds didn't eat much of it, but my husband and I loved it.  It has a very gourmet flavor.

We really didn't like this.  I didn't think the flavors mingled together well.  Also a little too soupy.  Not something I'll make again, I'm afraid.

This is such a fantastic recipe!!!!!!!!!! I made it with both ground pork and steak and I liked it better with the pork.  I followed the recipe exactly and the result is just delicious! Don't omit the cilantro; it gives a great flavor.  My husband and 5 year old son both love this and my son ate his pork over white chinest rice.  I loved it wrapped in a lettuc leaf.  Thank you so much for this great recipe!

I've been dying to try this - the ingredients were always on hand but didn't know what I would serve with it other than ordering some takeout like Wanton Soup and egg rolls to go with it.  But tonite was perfect - both of us had a big lunch and just needed a light meal.  We loved it!!  Didn't change a thing.  I put out jars of Hoison Sauce, chinese garlic chili sauce and dim sum sauce.  We made the wraps using about a teaspoon of the different sauces on them.  OUr favorite was the one with Hoison Sauce.   It was so quick to make and I look forward to making it during the summer when it is so hot that you have to eat and want something light. Maybe a tomato salad with it (from the wonderful garden grown tomatoes)?

This was so easy to make and just as good if not better than what you can get in a restaurant.  My friend, who doesn't care for Asian food, even said these were wonderful.  It is great with fresh whole cilantro leaves in each wrap.  I also served it with a hot chili sauce (one available in the aisan foods section with a green top and a rooster on the front).  These would also be great with a hoisin peanut sauce.

This had a lot more flavor than I anticipated!  To give it a little more color and texture I added diced red bell pepper and sliced wather chestnuts.  I also topped the wraps with fried mung bean threads like they do at P.F. Changs.  So yummy!

This was ok.  A good base to start with. Maybe a little salty. I did end up adding celery and carrots to it.  I'll probably play around with it a little next time.  I didn't have pork so used hamburger.

So good. Didn't has sesame oil so I subbed olive oil and left out the cilantro. This took 10 mins to make and was gone between 2 of us... I ate 2/3 of the bowl. Will make for parties and for no occasion at all. Loved this.

Huge success! I added ginger and ginger made it even better. Tofu makes it really waterly but cooking it longer will solve this problem.

Good base recipe, easy to substitute and adjust to what’s on hand. I added chopped carrots, water chestnuts and doubled the onion to up the vegetables. Also diced watermelon on top was tasty. I also add rice to the wrap. Would use romaine lettuce instead of iceberg.

Easy simple lunch for husband and self; didn’t have the stir fry sauce, so used hoisin sauce instead. Added some leftover risotto which worked well. Would definitely make again. Used Bibb lettuce in place of iceberg lettuce.

Super easy and fast.  We wrapped it with rice and made it an excellent one dish meal.  I didn’t use the dry sherry, stir-fry sauce and corn starch, though.  I marinated the ground pork with soy sauce and 1/4 tsp sugar.  After the pork was cooked, I added the onion and finely chopped garlic, then added a little hoisen sauce before following the rest of the directions.

This was good, I found it a little bland at first but a little salt and pepper fixed that. I like the stir fry sauce so I added a tad extra. I served this with a side of fried rice. It was good, I’ll make it again!

I used beef instead of pork (my family is not into pork, even though I love it!).  This recipe was a huge hit, it was simple, my family loved it, and I will definitely be making it again!

I made with ground turkey since store doesn't sell ground pork.  Very good and easy to make.  Also very adaptable to changes to fit your tastes.  To increase veggie content, I added shredded carrots halfway through cooking the meat and  then chopped water chestnuts and green onions at the end.  Have substituted rice wine vinegar for the sherry when I was out and tasted great.  I double the sauce mixture for our family too.  Have eaten as lettuce wraps and as a  bowl with shredded lettuce as the base.

I used red wine vinegar for the sherry and peanut sauce for the sesame oil. I left out the corn starch and added tsp soy sauce. They tasted great. I also bought sweet chili sauce for dipping.

Whole family loved it as written.  Served it with BirdsEye Steamfresh Veg. - Brown & Wild Rice w/Broccoli & Carrots.  We had leftovers so I mixed the beef mixture with the rice mixture and served it the next day with a side salad and we liked that equally as well (easier to serve and eat).

Wonderful! I used ground turkey and just needed to add a bit of salt at the table and it was perfect for me; hubby thought there was too much cilantro since  the  turkey had a milder flavor than pork. But since that gets added last anyway, next time I'll  just have the chopped cilantro in a bowl on the table for individual assembly. Cheap, easy, lightning - quick to make, nutritious, wonderfully tasty, AND low-fat! What else could I possibly wish for?

These were quick and tasty.  I had 1.5 lbs of pork and added some water chestnuts to the mix but otherwise followed the recipe.  I think green onion added would be good too.

I live overseas so a lot of these pre-made sauces are not available. I used a thai stir fry sauce, used a little white wine and rice vinegar instead of the sherry. Everything else was fine and tasty. I also used butter lettuce. Everyone loved it but i might try it with ground turkey next time.

I just found this recipe today and it looked pretty tasty, so I tried it. I found this to be a most excellent appetizer and the taste was incredible. I didn't have any starch, but had all the other ingredients. My family loved it, so thanks whomever posted this originally and my family thanks you as well.

This was pretty delicious for how easy it was. I used lean ground turkey as we tend to eat very healthy. I didn't have any sherry on hand so I used a splash of cooking red wine. I also added mushrooms finely chopped and a few water chestnuts chopped as those are typically in lettuce wraps and I like them. My husband really liked it and I served it with some fried rice and roasted garlic broccoli. My 2 children also ate it well. The children and my husband said it was good just over rice.

I eliminated the cilantro and sesame oil and added salt and it was delicious! I also used stir fry sauce plain without sherry or cornstarch. It was SO FAST! I think I will purchase sesame oil for the next time I make it, but it was still delicious without it.
