My husband and I were looking for a quick and tasty dressing for salads; and this one is by far the best homemade honey mustard we have ever tried!!!

I made this as a dip for pretzels.  It was definitely too thin, but my bigger objection was the amount of onion powder – way too much IMO.  It seemed to make the sauce taste very artificial to me.  Sorry to say, I doubt that we’ll be making this one again.

Loved this! So versatile! I made this to drizzle over chicken breast (which I did) but also used it for sandwiches and baked Haddock later in the week. I liked the flavor on a pretzel but thought it was a tad too runny for a dip. I would make this again! Thank you!!

I had to do a demonstration speech for a class and I wanted to make sliders but I needed a sauce and I tried a bunch of different ones. This one was perfect!! I was totally suspicious about the title but it went great with the turkey on a hawaiian bread roll.

it kinda tasted like the inside of a deviled egg, or bread & butter pickles. not very good for a french fry dip.

EXCELLENT! The only changes I made was to use garlic powder instead of onion powder (the latter has too much sodium) and I omitted the onion. I can't believe how quick, easy and GOOD this is! Will definitely make this again, next time I may add the fresh onion!

I used this for a sandwich spread. I served it with ham and turkey sandwiches at an 
event I catered. It got rave reviews and people wanted the recipe.  It was a little thinner than I would have liked, but just the same it was good. I was looking for a signature spread and I have found it!

Very good. I used this as a dip for pigs in a blanket at my super bowl feast. Everyone liked it so much they drowned there pigs in it. I made this early in the day and it thickened up a little in the fridge it was still thin but not thin enough to bother anyone.
