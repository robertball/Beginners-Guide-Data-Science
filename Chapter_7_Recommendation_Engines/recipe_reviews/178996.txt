This recipe was fantastic, but only after modifications, which is why I only gave it 4 stars.  I omitted the condensed soup and doubled the salsa, used brown rice instead of white, added a good dose of chipolte powder, doubled the corn and added drained black beans. I diced the chicken into bite sized pieces, mixed everything including half the cheese together, topped with remaining cheese and covered with foil to bake.  Really yummy and pretty healthy!

Great recipe, but needs a few adjustments to make it 5 stars.  First I added 1 can of drained black beans and 2 tsp. of dried onions.  I also used garlic powder in place of onion powder.  I seasoned the chicken with paprika, cumin & lemon pepper as another reviewer suggested.  I had to let mine cook for 1 hr 15 min.  Next time I will use brown rice as the white rice got too mushy.    Was great as a "dip" with tortilla chips (once the chicken was shredded) and would make a great filler for tortillas.  Would also be a great vegetarian recipe without the chicken.

WOW. This was a hit! My husband and I were fighting over the leftovers! Since I love corn, I added two cans (one cup?! Come on!), seasoned my chicken with some garlic mesquite seasoning, topped it off with some sharp Cheddar I found in the fridge (for the first time in heaven knows how long, we were out of Mexican cheese) and then just waited. My husband was wary about cream of chicken soup with salsa, but after his first bite, the wariness was replaced with "Wow, hon, this is amazing" followed by a "This tastes like more." And when it tastes like "more" in our house, it's a hit!

Very good recipe, my husband loved it!  I changed it up a little too...traded the salsa for a can of Rotel (drained), traded corn for a can of black beans (drained).  If I'd had frozen corn, I probably would have left it in.  I cooked my rice seperately to avoid the undercooked issue.  I sprinkled the cheese with garlic powder, cumin and chili powder.  The chicken was cooked PERFECT, fork tender.  Put the sauce over rice.  Delicious!

This was delicious.  My two preschool grandsons and somewhat finicky son-in-law asked for seconds. I used cheddar instead of Mexican cheese and used minute rice instead of regular . Very easy and quick to prepare.

I added a drained can of black beans and more cheese, plus I chopped up the chicken per PP's advice.  This was good but still a bit soupy for my taste.  Next time I think I'll increase the amount of uncooked rice (I used brown) to about 1 1/4 cups and see if that helps.  The taste was just what I was looking for so we will be having this again.

This is a favorite at my house; my husband is always excited when I fix it.  The recipe is delicious as written.  I have added extra onion or green pepper before.  Also, putting extra corn in it and adding black beans is very yummy!  This is a simple, one dish meal.

I only give it a 4 out of 5 because I doubled the recipe and the rice was still hard and chewy.  I had to put it back in for another 45 minutes for the rice to fully cook.  I also added chopped jalapenos and drizzled some Sriracha on top of the chicken to give it some kick and substituted the onion powder with garlic powder.

I double checked this recipe to make sure I'd followed it correctly and I did. I made it as written but my rice came out very soupy.  I don't know what happened there. Will not bother making again. Still searching for a good chicken and rice dish.

My husband and I really loved this recipe. I used a can of whole kernel corn drained instead of frozen, minute rice, and garlic powder instead of onion because this is what I had on hand. I threw in some sliced black olives too. Yummy!!

Really easy and really good.  I added a can of black beans and a can of green chiles and sprinkled the chicken with chile powder so it had some color.  I'll definitely be making this often.   Would also be good with yellow rice.

My family absolutely loved it.  I kicked it up a notch by adding a little cayenne pepper to the rice mixture and seasoned the chicken with chipotle seasoning.  It took more than 45 minutes because the chicken wasn't cooked through (I attribute that to the size of the chicken breasts).  Also added a little more rice because it seemed "soupy".   When it was done it was perfect.

It wasn't so bad. The idea is great. But my alterations were adding kidney beans and peas (as I didn't have corn and couldn't find my black beans). We ate it with Salsa Verde (Doritos) chips. THAT is what made this meal awesome. Otherwise, the dish was bland (even with adding some garlic to the mix and seasoning the chicken). Salt may help, but the chips had sufficient for adding flavor.

Very good.  My only issue was the cook time. I had to cook mine an additional 30mins to get the rice to be done.  I think next time I will do it uncovered.  I added a can of drained black beans and used already cooked chicken diced up because I had that on hand.  It was very yummy.  Oh, and I used cream of mushroom soup because that is what I had and used chicken broth instead of water.

Great recipe.  I like to try a recipe as written but I didn't have a couple of called for ingredients and made the following changes.
I used 8 boneless thighs instead of breast and a can of drained Ro-Tel (tomatoes and green chills) instead of the salsa.

I also used 1 cup of rice  and an extra 1/2 cup of water.  

It came our very good.  The chicken was very moist and flavorful and it was a visually appealing dish. I will definitely make again.

This was a lot better than I expected.  The recipe as is I rate with four stars. The second time I made it, I added about 1 cup chopped onion, 1 can of drained, rinsed and cooked black beans, and about 1/4 cup chopped pickled jalapeño (w/o seeds).  With those additions, I'd give it 5 stars.

Loved this recipe!  I have twin newborns and needed something very quick and easy that my fam would like and this was it :).  Made a couple of changes...used cream of mushroom soup because that's what I had on hand, used thigh meat rather than breast, used homemade salsa, sprinkled the chicken with chili powder, salt and pepper, used marble cheddar cheese, and topped with french fried onions for extra flavour and crunch.  SO yummy, will definitely make again!

I cut up the chicken and mixed it in with the other ingredients.  Cooked it 15 minutes longer, but the rice was still crunchy.  I think it could use more salsa too.  Next time, I will pre-cook the rice and add more salsa.  Overall, a very satisfying dish.

Easy to throw this onr together. Did not have onion powder at hand so just skipped it. It did take more than on hour to bake. Next time I will season it more too.

DO NOT put uncooked rice in this dish & expect it to be soft in 45 minutes ! Use either instant rice, or cooked rice!!
  It took 20 extra minutes to soften the rice and by that time the chicken was overcooked.
 I gave this recipe 4 Stars only because the ingredients are correct, it just needs some tweaks.
 I added a cup of black beans & some garlic and it was a very good mesh of flavors .

I tweaked this for what I had in the kitchen. I used a can of stewed tomatos, can of green chilli, brown rice, chicken thighs and also mixed in velveeta cheese. So, pretty much only used the corn and the cream of chicken in this recipe, but wow it came out sooooo good!! I will be making this again for sure!!!

Good. We used our homemade salsa, and 2 cans of shredded Chicken from Costco. I left a little of the water from one of the cans, and omitted the 1 cup of water all together since our salsa has a lot of juice. Rice was cooked in 50 minutes, and it was delicious with chips.

We loved it! And it's so easy. Since the picture shows beans I did add a can of pinto beans, and I used canned chicken. It was delicious and I'll be making it again. Even my mother-in-law liked it and she's not a fan of spicy foods (medium salsa). I put casserole back in the oven for a few minutes after topping it with cheese. Served with tortilla chips and sour cream.

I sauteed chicken chunks in olive oil with 1tsp cajun seasoning and 1tsp chili powder.  Also added 1tsp garlic powder, 1 can drained corn and drained black beans.  It was very bland and thick.  Crushed taco chips on top.  Not a family favorite.  Won't make again.

We made this as main course for a church luncheon and received rave reviews.  We served 80 people by making 8 times the recipe and for economy, we used about half as much chicken as the recipe called for, but the full amount of other ingredients. We cut the chicken in 1" pieces and stirred it in. We baked it in 3 commercial sized chafing dish pans, and it took about 3 hours for the rice to get done, but it held well in the chafing dishes at serving time.  Great recipe.

My son's Lacrosse schedule changed so I needed a recipe that I had ingredients to, I was glad I made this recipe. Because I had to make do with what I had I did substitute a few things. I used low fat cream of celery soup. Instead of onion powder I lightly sauteed a small onion. Along with the onion I lightly sauteed half a red pepper and added it to the casserole before baking, it added some color to the dish and good flavor. I cut up the chicken into bite size pieces as suggested by others along with adding a can of drained black beans. Next time I would add a bit more rice. I would use one cup rice to 1 1/2 cup water. Every one in my family loved it. We will make this again.

Very good.  I boiled my chicken first, then cut it in small pieces and spread evenly over the soup and rice mixture, then I did not add cheese until last 10 minutes.  Easier to eat for little kiddos. I served with plain nacho chips, sour cream, and taco sauce.  Delish!!!

Super easy. I also add a can of drained black beans and just substitute in your favorite salsa. My favorite is the double roasted from trader joe's.

My whole family loves this, which is hard to do.  Leftovers never last long.  Good one pot casserole.

Everyone loved it.  Toddlers and husband asked for seconds.  It did take about 15 extra minutes cook time.  It doesn't look pretty, but, it tastes great.
