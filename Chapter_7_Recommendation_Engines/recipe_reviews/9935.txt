good recipe, but needed modifications. I added one stick of butter instead of the shortening (who needs hydrogenation), less than 1/4 cup milk, 1/4 tsp salt, 1 extra egg, less butterscotch than it said, I added a handful of raisins, and finally, instead of 3 cups oats, I used about 2 3/4 cups.  The result: absolutely the best oatmeal cookie ever!!

These didn't want to hold together very well, but the flavor was good. I made a second batch adding a second egg and 1 cup of butter rather than shortening. To make them special for my coffee-loving friends, I added 1 cup cappucino chips along with the chocolate chips. Yummy! These are really really good with the modifications.

This was a good cookie but I found it kind of dry.  I baked it for 11 minutes, which may have been too long.  Also, I used 2 1/2 cups of oats rather than 3, and I think next time I'll only use 2.

I love these cookies and so does my family! Instead of 1 c, I used 2/3 C of chocolate chips and 2/3 c of butterschotch chips and there were still more than enough. I think next time I'll reduce the measurement of each to 1/2 c. Thanks for a great cookie recipe.

Recipe said chewy, and I thought they were kind of dry myself.  They seemed to crumble when you'd take them off the cookie sheet after they cooled.
They fell apart way too easily.

I would also agree that the recipe was a little dry.  I used a little less oatmeal the second time and they were great.  Also, cut down the chips to 3/4 cup and added 2 chopped heath bars.  The toffee was a great addition!

I think there needs to be more liquid in the recipe .. they are very crumbly .. also I think the amount of chips needs to be reduced.

Lots of chips in this cookie. I wasn't sure if there would be enough batter to hold the chips together, but once in the oven they flatten out and everything turned out fine. A nice recipe if you like a really sweet cookie.

Good cookies, nothing spectacular.  I found they spread a lot and I that makes them very crumbly and fragile.  I didn't have chocolate chips, so used butterscotch only.

To fix the crumbly texture, add 1 more egg, 1/4 cup of butter and keep the dry ingredients the same (may want to add 1/2 tsp salt.) Also, they're better without the chocolate chips (hence the name Butterscotch Oatmeal Cookies).

cookies have good flavor, however getting them off the cookie sheet in one piece is difficult. Tried the recipe as listed and then tweaked it a bit using butter, another egg, and baking powder, the result was taste was still good, but too much fussing to keep the cookie in one piece.  Will not make again.

THese are very tasty. This is by far the best oatmeal cookie I have eaten.  I substituted 1/4 cup of Graham flour for 1 cup of oats, I used rolled barley instead of actual oats (healthier); they look & taste like oats but have more nutriton as does the graham flour.  I also added 1 cup choc chips & used 2 cups of butterscotch chips.

I just made these cookies and needed to use an extra bag of butterscotch chips so I made this recipe. I didn't have any butterflavored shortening and used the same amount of butter. I also added 2 eggs, 2 cups of Oatmeal 1/2 cup each of chocolate and butterscotch. Everybody loved the cookies. I may have to add this to our Christmas cookie list. Thanks for sharing.

Good recipe.  I made it exactly as it said, except to add about 1/4 c. of milk to help with the dryness everyone else commented on.  Will definitely make again.

The recipe for this item was good, however, this is crumbly. I made the following changes to the recipe, 1/2 cup of chocolate chips, 1/2 cup of peanut butter chips and 1 cup of butterscotch. It is crumbly. I had to push down with a fork and water to get to turn out right. But, they are great, my kids can eat all of them in one sitting. I have three boys and one girl.

This recipe is rather dry.
I suggest doubling it and then adding an extra egg, or something like that.
Beyond that, very good, very simple.

Too sweet! I have a mad sweet tooth and even I was gagging a little. I modified the recipe only slightly by changing the shortening out for butter and followed the rest to the letter. Next time I will certainly reduce the sugar and half the chips, it really didn't need that many. Maybe adding some nuts might mix up the flavors. Too bad. Easy recipe :(

I have had the worst time with these cookies. I have to make them really small or they fall apart. They're much too sweet so definitely need less chips. I wish I had followed some of the other reviews and used less oats. I won't make these again...

the proportions on the ingredients are all wrong. They were very crumbly as dough and came out very hard in the oven. I will be sticking to the recipe on the bag of butterscotch morsels from now on.

I added less sugar (skipped the white sugar), used real butter, an extra egg, and 1 cup less of oats, and as well cut down the sweet chips by half, as less sugar is better for us, and I added a handfull of raisins. They remind me of Granny's oatcakes from Scotland.

Really awful! I tried to follow the suggestions above but these were still a disaster! They smelled good while baking but that was it! A big disappointment...I ended up throwing away the 1st batch and the rest of the dough.

These weren't good. We didn't have shortening so we used butter so maybe that was the problem. They were hard as rocks. Won't be trying this one again. : (

Great concept but, too many oats--the cookies crumbled before baking and, are crumbling now in my hands!

The dough was very crumbly, despite my having decreased the amount of oats by 1/2 cup. It was too hard to work with. The cookies tasted fine, if a little sugary. Not sweet, but just like eating a spoonful of white sugar. I would not make these again. The kids loved them, however. Half the dough was unusable , as it was too crumbly to form into balls, so I put it in an 8x8 pan and baked it for 8 minutes, then threw 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream on top.

I decided to only use two cups of oatmeal after reading the reviews, but I still found that the dough would not stick together. The end product was delicious, however, and I will definitely make these cookies again.

Way too sweet for me. Even for my boyfriend who likes sweet stuff. A bit of salt would have fix the problem. And i did use only 2 cups of oatmeat and it came out not crumbly at all.

Pretty good recipe.  Some modifications I made were: I used regular shortening (did not have any butter flavored in the cupboard!) and added 2 tablespoons butter to compensate, added 2 eggs, only 2 ½ quick cooking oats, and only 1 cup of chips total.  The cookies held together nicely, were not dry and had a nice flavor.  I did spray the cookie sheet with Pam after reading the reviews of some having trouble with sticking and they came off the sheet nicely.  Enjoy!

I made these last night. They are really good cookies! Only downside was that the batter was really crumbly. For that reason, I think it's very important to let the cookies cool after removing from the oven otherwise they will fall apart. Next time, I will use more shortening or an extra egg.

Not bad... I read the reviews and took some of their advice... used 2 eggs and a full cup of shortening... I melted the shortening to make the batter less crumbly... I certainly wouldn't describe these as chewy... very crunchy but really a nice combo of flavors. My boyfriend raved about them and my roommate was eating them for breakfast. (They do, after all, have oatmeal!)

This is almost the same recipe as under the quaker oats lid...only that recipe calls for 2 sticks of butter..which tastes better and is healthier for you..and slightly more flour and 2 eggs...and more cin. I just made them adding the butterscotch chips and chocolate chips from this recipe...YUMMY!!!!  I can't believe I haven't made these before

These cookies are wonderful!  However they were on the dry side.  I would add another egg to the mixture the next time.  I also used 1/2 c. semi-sweet chocolate chips, 1/2 c. Special Dark chips, 1 c. butterscotch chips and 1/2 c. crushed pecans.

So good, I forgot to take a picture and they've all been eaten! Best cookie ever! I used butter instead, added 1/4 c of almond milk and no chocolate chips just butterscotch (1 bag), and an extra egg.

well, I took advice from a few posts, as far as modifying this recipe, and boy, they still turned out horrible!
Maybe living in Colorado (high altitude) had a little something to do with it, but usually I only have to add a small amount more of flour to make recipes work out. I altered this recipes, as per the advice given on a few posts here:
1 c. butter (not 3/4 shortening)
2 eggs
1/4 tsp. salt
1/4 c. milk (a bit less)
about 2.5 cups oats

after baking, they were waaay too greasy, totally flat , and fell completely apart even before cooling. a mess.

After baking just a few, I added : 1 more cup of flour,  and another 1/2 cup of oats. they finally looked decent (like cookies should), but I they don't seem to be the soft "chewy" kind of cookies I like. rather hard and crispy. Guess I'll throw a piece of bread in the cookie container to soften them up.

Very good, perhaps a little too sweet. I made a double batch. 
The dough was too dry and crumbly, so I added an extra egg. The egg did the trick. I found it easier to form the dough into balls and flatten with the palm of my hand than to drop from a spoon.
Works best if left to cool for a bit on the baking sheet before transferring to the cooling rack.
I also use margarine, instead of shortening.

I looked through other people's reviews and used some ideas to make this better. I lessened the sugar by 1/4 C each. For the oatmeal I used Quaker Instant Oatmeal the individual packets; maple & brown sugar, cinnamon & spice, and regular. I thought it added to the flavor profile really well without sticking out. 
I also added some leftover pecan pie filling to the mix. 

Next time I will lower the amount of chocolate/butterscotch chips I use as they were pretty overpowering. I didn't find them too crumbly at all, as long as they sat a few minutes before I did anything with them.

Overall, delightful. I could eat the batter by the spoonful!
