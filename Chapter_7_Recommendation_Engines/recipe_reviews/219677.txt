I used this rub on a 5 pound pork loin. I wrapped it in foil and refrigerated it overnight. The next morning I put the loin in a crockpot with one half cup of water on low for 7 hours . When it was cool enough to handle my husband and I used forks to shred it. I kept nibbling on it because it was so delicious. I prepared a double recipe of the Bourbon BBQ sauce also found on this site and it was absolutely incredible. There was enough to share with the children. Thanks for such a delicious way to prepare pork loin.

This is delicious. I use a leg of pork seasoned and let it sit overnight in the refrigerator. Served with coleslaw rolls and corn on the cob.

Used crockpot but otherwise followed the recipe until the end. My son liked the meat so well he wouldn't let me add the BBQ sauce! Thank you for sharing!

This dish came out perfect.  Love it.  I used Cattleman's BBQ sauce.  It was nice and tangy.
