If you are looking for "cheesecake" this isn't it. If you are looking for a Gooey Butter Cake that is better than Entenmann's or Haas, this IS it! I only had an 18.5 oz super moist yellow cake mix so I used that and doubled the rest of the ingredients. Baked it in a glass 9 x 13 pan a little longer than the original baking time, until it tested done. After it had cooled, I sprinkled it lightly with powdered sugar. I took it to church -- here in St. Louis -- and it was a HUGE hit! I will definitely make this again, and again, and again!

This is a very simple and delicious recipe.  It certainly satisfies the sweet tooth.  I added juice from half a lemon to give it a little kick.

I think this is just a little too sweet and just does not taste quite right, sorry, not my favorite. If you like cheesecake just stick to the real thing!

This recipe did not turn out well at all. The cream cheese mixture did not mix with the cake mixture well. When you cut a piece, the cream cheese mixture separates itself from the cake part, and it completely falls apart. If I could give this negative stars, I totally would. What a waste of ingredients.

I have mixed reviews on these.  Personally, not what I expected.  Very sweet and almost like a lemon bar texture, I'd say.  However, I brought them to a family gathering and everyone thought they were great!  So they are good but calling them cheesecake is not an accurate description, especially if that is what you are expecting.

Too much cake. There are much better cheesecake bars out there.

This is halfway between cheesecake bars and gooey bars.

This is a WINNER everywhere I bring this.  I've added a little flavoring to it, and it just gets raves! My family definitely loves it, and whenever I take it to church gatherings or friend's homes... it's gone in a matter of minutes.  so far, when I slice them, it can be "not-so-hot" looking...but it deceives, as the TASTE!!  Go ahead.. try it...  it only takes about $4-$5 at the grocery store and some time and VOILA!

I top this with powdered sugar, and although they are extremely sweet, I have never had anyone not want seconds! We call these 'gooey bars'

Made this for a potluck - didn't even get any myself! Tasted great everyone said. Not necessarily like cheesecake, but like gooey cake bars. Still a big hit!
