Well, I didn't drain the ricotta nor did i refrigerate the filling, so I am rating the taste and ease of making it.  I did not make the shells (bought at an italian deli.  We froze a bunch. worth making!

I loved the shells I made. I wouldn't change them at all. However, I found that even after draining the ricotta, the texture was a little off for my taste. I think next time, I might use mascarpone and maybe some crystallized lemon and a little ginger. Still a very good recipe the way it is.

This was a great recipe.  I added a little more confectioners sugar to the filling (about a cup.)  It came out great!

I did have to drain the ricotta.  I didn't at first and it was really watery and didn't taste very good.  So I put the ricotta in a colander and put it on top of a big mixing bowl and let it sit over night in the fridge.  Woke up the next morning and it was the perfect texture! 

I bought the shells because I was feeling lazy, but this recipe is similar to the one we used at the bakery I worked at a long time ago so I will just assume it will be good haha

This was a perfect recipe with the exception of the lack of drain-the-ricotta instruction.  I drained Sorrento brand ricotta (starts off drier) for 3 days in a sac I made of cheesecloth.  It was the perfect consistency for piping through a pastry bag.  Tasted wonderful!  I skipped the mini chips and orange peel, but on a few of them I dipped the ends of the shell in chocolate.  My taste testers loved these plain or with chocolate!
