Again, thanks for all the great suggestions on this!  I do have one bone of curious contention... why is it that nearly all the folks who rate this at a "one star" rating pretty much complain that it is 'too spicy' or 'too tangy' or 'too sweet'.. after reading the clear and detailed dish description, then rate it down complaining that it is just as I said it is??  I specifically outlined the tastes so that those who would not be interested in the taste would not bother to make it.  Don't rate me down to ground because it doesn't suit your personal tastes.  Just don't make the dish to begin with.  This is a first-rate recipe!!  And thanks again to all you who continue to lend input and suggestions!  Only makes the recipe better suited to a wider group of folks!!  Bon Appetit!!!

This was very tasty and would have gotten 5 stars except that 1) hubby complained it didn't taste "authentic" and I have to agree, 2) it gave me a rather nasty sugar buzz, and 3) the technique needs to be changed for stir-frying the chicken and the ginger and garlic need to be fresh.

For those who will be making it again, you get a MUCH more tender chicken if you mix the chopped chicken with a bit of soy sauce, sherry, cornstarch and oil before frying it in the pan.  If you just put the chicken in "naked" like the recipe says, the chicken is tougher.  Too tough for my taste.

Another tip for those who think it's too strong in the vinegar taste or want more sauce but not more vinegar. It's okay to add half a cup or more of water to this recipe.  Just adjust everything to taste.  You don't have to keep adding only soy sauce, vinegar and sugar to make more sauce.

This recipe is fantastic. I modified it. We are on a diet so I used 3/4 cup Splenda instead of sugar and just used Pam instead of oil. I did not add peas mushrooms and did not thicken. We put the chicken on top of green salad and used the sauce as a hot spicy vinagrette dressing. It was awesome. As another reviewer stated,it does taste a lot like General Tso's without breading. Will use time and time again. Thanks so much!!!!

Unless you like drinking white vinegar straight up, this is not for you.  I added so much sugar to cover up the pungent vinegar taste but even when the vinegar taste is covered up by sweetness, your nose takes an assault every time you inhale.  Thank goodness I cut the recipe in half.

I read through the reviews before making this dish.  As a result, I made numerous modifications to this recipe and it came out absolutely delicious.  I made the following changes: (1) I used one fresh yellow onion, about six cloves of garlic, and about 2 tablespoons of fresh chopped up ginger.  I'm a big believer in using fresh ingredients where possible and here I think it really adds to the flavor. Before adding the chicken I sauteed the onion, garlic, and ginger in the oil for about two minutes. (2) In terms of the sauce, I used 1/2 cup white vinegar, 1/4 cup reduced sodium soy sauce, and 1/2 cup brown sugar. (3) In addition to the 8 ounces of mushrooms and one cup of peas, I added one chopped green bell pepper and one chopped red bell pepper.  I did not include the cornstarch. It gives a great Asian flavor and is much tastier than what you would get in most Chinese restaurants.  Plus there is the added advantage that it tastes so much healthier because I was able to use all organic and fresh ingredients. I will definitely make this again, maybe rotating different vegetables (I think this recipe would also work with broccoli, green beans, sugar snap peas, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, bok choy, baby corn, a lot of things).  I also think it is really important to accompany this dish with rice.  My rice really absorbed the sauce well.

loved it!! easy to prepare... soo very yummy!!! But, of course I changed it to fit my tastes. Tastes ten times better if you use fresh ingredients instead of powdered or dried.

I used rice vinegar just because I had it; doubt it would make any noticeable difference.  I used fresh garlic, fresh ginger and chopped up some fresh onion as well as the powdered garlic, onion, ginger, and green onions.  I used Sugar Twin rather than sugar (1/8 c and it was sweet enough).  Also added fresh broccoli and snow peapods.  Next time I would reduce the amount of vinegar a bit (1 c from 1.5 c) and also the soy sauce (1/4 c from 1/2 c) as it was too salty (or try low sodium soy sauce).  It was a pretty good stir-fry, but just too salty for my tastes.  My friend also made it and used low-sodium soy sauce and said it came out perfect.

This was great!!!  i didn't follow the amount of spices exactly, but I have apretty good feel for what we like, and it came out great.  I agree with the submitter -- if you read the description and it doesn't sound like your taste, don' review it with a bad rate.  I will def do this again!!

I have made this twice, once with chicken and once with beef, it was great both times. I substitute some brown sugar for the white sugar (have to increase the amount of brown sugar, though) and I pour in quite a lot of hot pepper. I like to make the sauce in a separate pot so I can get it to the consistency and taste that I want prior to putting it in with the meat and veggies.

I wasn't sure about this recipe at first because of the amount of vinegar it calls for.  My husband commented on the smell of vinegar as it was cooking.  But, once it is finished the flavor is wonderful!  It reminds me of General Tso's chicken without the breading.

This wasn't just vicious, it was vicilicious!! I love hot spicy food and this was right up my alley and I love the sweetness added to the hot. I served with potatoes, but I think it needed rice with it. Thanks!

This recipe is so good.  I don't even like going to our favorite chinese restaurant anymore because this is far better than anything I've ordered there.  I do everything in this recipe to a tee, but I use Splenda instead of sugar, and broccoli instead of peas.  It's my favorite, and I have made it several times.  Thank You!

I substituted rice wine vinegar and left out the ginger, and this dish was incredible!  Very tangy, yet spicy and crunchy all in one.  I would definitely cook this again!

Chicken Vicious Haiku: "Eek, my mouth's on fire! Yet I can't stop eating this. Vicious delicious!" Took suggestion of reviewer #2 and marinated the cut-up chicken in soy sauce, sherry, and EVOO (along w/ fresh garlic and ginger) and took the advice of reviewer #3 and served over a salad. (This provided a nice cooling effect to the kick that this dish brings.) The vinegar burned my eyes and nose when I added it to the skillet, but I stuck to my guns (and the recipe as written), and used the called for measurements of sugar, vinegar and soy sauce. Husband said exactly what some reviewers mentioned, "tastes like General Tso's w/o the unnecessary breading", and I just liked that despite its fire, it still had a good taste. (My suggestions: marinate the chicken and use fresh garlic and ginger.)

Holy Freaking Goodness! This is one yummy dish! Made this exactly as described (except added carrots and used fresh ginger because I had them) and I would not change a thing--don't taste it too soon or the sugar/vinegar will knock your socks off.I was quite liberal with the red pepper flakes and the spice nicely offset the sweetness. This is going on my regular rotation---and makes me not miss take out Chinese.

This worked out well with frozen stir fry veggies & cut in half for 2 chicken breasts.  Added the frozen veggies in the last 5min.  Maybe would have cut the cook time on the chicken in the beginning because it came out a little tough.  Great sauce, expected it to be really spicy but the sweet was a nice offset.

Wow, you weren't kidding.  But I did like it.  I mean, it's hot but good.  I dislike mushrooms so dumped those, and used low-sodium soy sauce, but I didn't assume I needed to start changing everything.  I ended up adding about 2 tablespoons more sugar, thinking perhaps I'd need even more.  But once you get everything added, thickened, and put on rice, it does calm that heat just a little, so I think at the "taste test" point you can leave it just a hair on the "too much" side.  (My opinion - don't hold me to it.)  I did not find it in any way sweet even with a bit of extra sugar. It goes very well with the rice - and with rice, this might be double the servings.  This was also a nice way to sneak in peas, as I don't like them cooked but don't notice them in something like this.  The downfalls are all that sugar - for an otherwise healthy dish.  And it also does not re-heat very well.  Tolerable and I don't let leftovers go to waste, but certainly not the same.  Oh, and this was not done in 45 minutes at all.  For one, having to cut up raw chicken is not quick, and it took a while to thicken - noticed others having trouble getting it to thicken.  Now while I understand, if you don't like hot, don't make this,

This recipe was amazing! I very seldom give a recipe 5 stars, but this one deserves it.  I wimped out a bit, and only used 1 cup of vinegar, and when the sauce ingredients were first added to the chicken in the pan, I thought it might be a bit too vicious.  But after simmering, the flavors blended beautifully together.  I saved almost 194 calories per serving by using splenda instead of sugar without compromising the flavor, and served it over brown rice.  I think this dish could become addicting, and I'll have to have a "fix" every couple of weeks.

This was so good I ate till I was completely stuffed!  My boyfriend couldn't stop raving about it.  I did take the tips from others and used all fresh ingredients (fresh garlic, fresh ginger, used fresh broccoli instead of peas, fresh mushrooms.)  I do believe the fresh ingredients make a big difference.  I did use a touch less vinegar (maybe 1/4 cup less), but I used exactly 1 tablespoon of the red pepper flakes because I love spicy foods.  For even more flavor, I mixed all of the sauce ingredients and marinated the chicken for about 15 minutes before I browned it. Thank you tocoyote for a wonderful recipe!!!

Well "Tocoyote", we'll have to rename you "Sid Vicious"! This dish was great and loved by the whole family! I left out the peas because for our tastes, I didn't feel they went well with the recipe. Veggie wise, I added, broccoli, scallions, baby corn from the can, green peppers and carrots for color. I did use the powders but also threw in fresh garlic and a bit of sesame oil. The next time I make this I'll do the cooking process a little differently, only because we like our vegies al dente. During the fifteen minute simmering, I'll only cook the meat and add the already stir fried vegies the last five minutes in order to keep them crisp. Although my family loves spicey foods in a big way, from the other reviews I read, I was worried that a tablespoon of the pepper flakes would be too much, so I only used a half. When I tasted the sauce, it didn't have enough of a kick, so I ended up adding some cayenne. The spice, sugar and vinegar combos were perfect and we all thought it was fantastic! Thanks "Sid" for a great meal!!!!

Wonderful recipe! I did not have frozen peas or fresh mushrooms so I used the canned versions of both. I was blown away that three of my four kids liked this recipe. The only one who wouldn't eat it is my three year old but that was no surprise. I made rice with dish and it went very well with it. Try this recipe, you'll like it.

Great recipe. My family has light taste buds, so we only used a teaspoon of the red pepper flakes. We didn't even have to use the corn starch to thicken it! Thank you for sharing it!

Me and my girlfriend made this last night. We both loved it, but she found it more spicy than i did. I'll definitely try this again but play around with the ingredients to attempt to make it more healthy.

This dish is really great.  If you do not like any flavor to your food, or have horrible taste in general would be the only reason you would not give this dish 5 stars.
I do suggest however to only use about 3/4 cup of sugar and slightly less vinegar. I like to roll the diced chicken in corn starch before cooking.  It helps give a nice color/texture to the chicken pieces. I also added Yakisoba noodles one time.  I have made this twice and both times it was excellent.

I prepared this last night and we loved it. I didn't feel at all that the vinegar overwhelmed the other flavors. I totally agree with you, tocoyote! If the recipe calls for an ingredient that you are not fond of, you probably won't like it!!!!!!

This was excellent.  We used brown sugar instead of white, as one of the reviewers suggested, and it turned out fabulous.  Will make again and often.

This is okay. My expectations were higher for this, though.  It was a little on the sweet side, but I guess I could have added more vinegar.  I probably won't make it again, but it's definatly worth trying.

Yummy! DO NOT BE FOOLED!!!! While making it, it may burn the hairs in your nostrils with it's vinegar scent, but stick it out. Also, mine looked nothing like the picture. So don't let the sight or smell of it fool you. Just taste it and you'll be convinced.
Very spicy, but absolutely delicious! I added a little more water to get more sauce for my rice, but otherwise, it was great.

We were split on this. It is good but I didn't think it was all that "vicious". My wife and daughter said it was almost too hot for them. Great flavor though. Served it over brown rice and with ginger soup.

This was great! I made some adjustments to suit our tastes as suggested, and it came out perfectly. I followed the advice of another reviewer and marinated the chicken in corn starch, soy sauce and white wine before cooking so it would be tender. Like Chinese Sweet and Sour Chicken with a kick.

very yummy and spicy.  i used a couple tsp fresh ginger and 7 cloves fresh garlic when making this, and maybe a 1/4 tbsp more red pepper.  also used splenda instead of sugar.  starts quite sweet but gets quite hot!  will definitely make again.

This was AWESOME. We didn't use any veggies (we were out) but I'll definitely be throwing in lots next time. We used about half the suggested chicken and had enough sauce for the rice. The only change I might make is to use just a teensy bit less sugar, it was just a smidgen too sweet. But the spice kick was amazing! This is definitely going in the favorites box.

This was very good.  I used left over chicken, scaled down the recipe and used broccoli and red/green bell peppers. I don't usually love hot foods, but I liked the red pepper kick to this.  Thanks. (edit- I have found myself craving the sauce for this and will sometimes make just the sauce to put over the rice--it is so good, it's become an addiction.)

This recipe is awesome!  My husband won't eat mushrooms so I left them out but added those little corns and some bamboo shoots.  I went a little easy on the vingegar and it was perfect.  We will have this again.

Excellent tasting & easy to make; but be forewarned that it IS spicy (Thai-food-spicy, not jalapeno-spicy).  I was able to eat & enjoy it, but I paid for it all the next day.

Excellent recipe! I didn't have any white vinegar on hand so I only used 1/2 cup of apple vinegar.  I added onions, mushrooms,peas,green peppers, green beans, and chili peppers.  Next time I won't add as many chili peppers as it was HOT!  I will also add red instead of green peppers next time.  Thanks for a terrific recipe! A definite keeper! 10/27/07 I made this the other night for some friends -- this is only my second time making it. It was delicious -- again!!! I added bean sprouts and pea pods to it. It tasted to vinegarry so I added some more sugar and ouila!  I think I'll add more chicken next time. We seemed to have ate most of it with dinner and I didn't have any for leftovoers!

Wow! My husband summed it up with "This is a company meal!" I've tried dozens of stir-fries and found some that were so-so, but none really grabbed me. This one did! I subbed beef for the chicken, added chopped extra firm tofu, and used broccoli and carrots instead of the peas and green onions. It was amazingly delicious!! My husband said "Keep this recipe handy". I plan to!

Wonderful. Decided to try it for Halloween dinner and I'm so glad I did.  We both loved it.  The only regret I have is that I listened to some of the reviews and decreased the vinegar to 1 cup. Next time, I'm going for the full amount. It was delish with the lesser amount but I think I lost some of the "wowza". Also, as part of a Halloween menu, I made the Pumpkin Casserole from this site. I didn't think the two would actually go together and considered serving them as two separate courses.  I was wrong. The two went so well together I was stunned. Thank you for a great recipe.  It'll be a go to.

This was fantastic. Very similiar to General Tso's. My brave tasted three year old daughter even loved it. I omitted the mushrooms just as personal preference. This is going into regular dinner rotation.

I love this recipe!  The description says it all, this recipe does not disappoint!  There is definitely lots of "kick"!  Next time I am going to try it with real garlic though, as I'm sure it'll add even more bite. :)

This was so-o-o-o good!  I loved the spicy/sweet/sour flavor that came from combining all the ingredients.  I added broccoli instead of the peas (my  husband hates peas) but the veggies came out a little soggy.  The vinegar was a little bit too much for my husband, but I thought the whole dish was great. Thanks for a good recipe!

I have been meaning to make this recipe for a long time, and I am so glad I finally did! Don't let the "Vicious" scare you, this recipe is fabulous! I did modify it just slightly for personal tastes, as we all should, but only minimally: 1/2 Tbsp red pepper flakes, and only 1 cup white vinegar. The vinegar/soy sauce combo is outstanding! The sugar does a great job of sweetening the sauce as well. My husband doesn't like peas and so, to add some crunch with the chicken and mushrooms, I added sliced celery instead. Superb! I think next time I will use more chicken, we both were left wanting more after the meat was gone!

This did not turn out as we anticipated.  It never thickened, not sure if that is how it is or something we did wrong.  It had a nice flavor, but even with adding more vegetables it was really soupy.  Probably will not make again.

WOW! This should be called "chicken delicious" lol  I agree with another reviewer's comment that this very simple and delicious recipe can easily be altered to fit your personal taste preference!  I sub. the mushrooms and peas with frozen brocoli because that is all I had on hand, and accidently left out the green onions, but the recipe still tasted WONDERFUL! I served over a bed of white rice. My husband loved it- I will be making this recipe again and again!! Definitely one of the best recipes I've found on this site... thanks for sharing!

This recipe was awesome. I used Splenda, something I haven't cooked with too often, so I wasn't sure if the 1-to-1 on the sugar was going to be right, and frankly, I'd probably cut down on the Splenda next time. I used various veggies, icluding broccoli and cabbage, and might stir-fry them seperately next time so I can better control thier doneness. Used about a half of a tablespoon red peppers, and that was about perfect (for me). Lord, was it good! Hot! Sweet! Fantastic. Thank you for submitting.

OK, I made this exactly as written. It is fabulous and I'll be making it all the time! I totally agree with your comments tocoyote! If the ingredients are too much for some, for Gods sake why would you make it? My husband is Asian and is quite familiar with the combination and absolutely loved it! It's not too sweet or too hot! Love it!!! Thanks for a great recipe!

I can't find enough excuses to make snow peas so I did sub them for the peas and I did use brown sugar instead of white.  I loved this recipe and it's zingy flavor!  Of course, I LOVE vinegar (and even judge hot wings with how much is in them --the more, the better!)  But, alas, hubby doesn't share in this longing so I guess I'll tone it down for him and eat with a bottle of vinegar in front of me.  Really flavorful, thanks for sharing!

This was a pretty good dish, although I cut down the vinegar to 1 cup instead of 1 1/2 cups. I also used about 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar instead of 1 cup white sugar. Instead of garlic powder, I used fresh chopped garlic, and I added a finely chopped fresh jalepeno for a little more kick. I will definitely make this one again!

MMMMM Savory-Sweet Yummy!  I added more veggies and used more chicken, light and dark meat was so good, next time i would add the veggies later so as to not cook them( I used a bag of frozen stir-fry mix) Thanx for the great recipe, will be cooking it again for sure!

Very good - I thought it lived up to its name!  I used fresh ginger and garlic and substituted broccoli for the peas and mushrooms.  My husband loved it.  "George likes his chicken spicy..." :-)

OMG....I loved this.  I made it exactly - except substituted 1/2 of the sugar with Splenda (son is a diabetic). It had a sweet/tangy/hot flavor that was incredible.  Made my nose run throughout dinner - but hey, that's a sign of a good dish!  Even our 13-year-old son liked it.  He was picking at the leftovers later in the evening.  I will make this often!

I scaled the recipe down, but didn't scale back on the red pepper. That gave it some heat! Mmm, mmm, mmm!  Just a tad too sweet though, I'd start with a little less, you can always add more.  I too used fresh garlic and ginger, makes a big difference, use it if you have it.

I was really dissapointed with this recipe after reading all the great reviews!  I guess it was just not my taste because it was waaaay too tangy and salty!  I tried adding more sugar but that did not help.  I gave it two stars because my husband thought it was okay but I will not be making this agian.

I made a few changes to the basic recipe.  I used LOTS of real garlic and added water chestnuts and broccoli.  The only complaint is that it made too much sauce and I will decrease it next time.  The heat is just right and the flavor is great!

oh my goodness, i thought i was a person who loved hot food until i tasted this.. if you can not go out and get suicide wings and eat them no problem do not add all the red pepper flakes.. you will want to cut it back a bit... i loved the flavor though.. i will make it again.. i just will use about half the red pepper.

My husband loved this!  I did have to adjust the vinegar/sugar to taste (more sugar).  I didn't add the green onions.  Definitely serve over rice.

Great recipe, made it just a little while ago for dinner, husband loved it. I used 1 small fresh onion, finely chopped in the food processor and 1 tbsp garlic paste instead and added those to the skillet with the chicken, and I also added some salt although the recipe doesnt call for any. Quick and easy dish, would recommend it to anyone who likes to try out different flavours. I'll be making this one again. thanks.

I should have gone with my gut when I saw 1/2 cup soy sauce.  I knew that would be too much.  The flavor of the soy sauce overpowered almost everything else.  I will not make this again.

I stored this recipe in my inbox a few years ago and occasionally flirted with the idea of trying it, but, until last night, it had remained an unconsumated relationship. More fool me for waiting so long!  We really enjoyed this dish - it's earned itself a regular spot in the "Rotation".  The only change I made was to reduce the amount of vinegar to 3/4 cup, following the advice of an earlier submitter.

I wasn't sure how I would like the combo of flavors but I was quite surprised and pleased.  I used 1 c vinegar and 1 c. sugar, all of the soy (low sod) and all fresh ingrediants.  Next time I think I would reduce the vinegar to 3/4 c.  Also, my sauce never thickened, even with the cornstarch added towards the end..?

The first time I made this it seemed a bit too tart so the second time I made it I decreased the vinegar. By decreasing the vinegar though, it made it much more spicy so the next time I will decrease vinegar and red pepper flakes and then I think it will be perfect for our liking! Originally I had this at 3 stars but with my altering Ive upped it to 4 stars! Just needs to be switched up a bit for my tastes

The Mr loved this and I wasn't so keen so I've given it 4 stars as an average of my 3 and his 5.  Miss 8 also liked it so I was very pleased and it was very quick to make - more like 15-20 mins start to finish.  I made a few changes to the recipe; I didn't want to use a whole cup of sugar so I halved the vinegar and sugar and I also used fresh garlic, ginger and chilli instead of the dried versions.

I forgot to rate this recipe when I made it. I added some red bell pepper and bamboo shoots to this. While we are lovers of strong flavors, and I did read the reviews, I was still unprepared for how strong the vinegar is in this recipe. It was mellower the next day, but I would definately reduce the amount if I make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

The flavor was fine, actually kind of interesting.  It was way too sugary though.  I wish I would have noticed some of the reviews and cut the sugar in half.

This was good.  Very easy, but the only things was that it was way too much sauce.  I didn't add the peas and mushrooms but instead used celery, carrots and red bell pepper. (Oh, and I made this using chicken thighs)  I think next time I'll play around with this and make less sauce.

I don't use quite as much sugar, half the amount is fine. I also add more vegetables as this is a great base recipe.

I really wanted to like this recipe, but it just didn't do it for me.  It had a strange flavor.  I think it might've been the onion powder.  Not sure.  Oh, well, thanks anyway.

This was spicy all right and I used about half of the red pepper flakes. My husband and I thought it was pretty good. I served over a bed of wild rice and instead of peas(we don't like them) I used green beans which turned out great. I also had to add extra cornstarch to get the sauce thicker to our liking.

We really liked this!  I added a 12 oz. box of cooked fettucine noodles to make it a lo main type dish.  That worked out well because the cornstarch didn't thicken up the liquid in mine at all, so the noodles absorbed the excess.

Ridiculously good and easy to scale; both by portion and tolerance for spice.

This was one of the best spicy/sweet chicken dishes we have had.  The kids loved it!  The name made us all curious and we are glad.

To much vinegar for me, but I think it has potential for those that don't like THAT much kick. I think with very little vinegar, it could taste really great.

This was really good.  Even the kids liked it!  I only used 1 cup vinegar as my husband isn't crazy for the taste, but he said he couldn't even taste it.  I used 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar and sauteed the chicken with raw garlic to give it some flavor.  I also added some sliced carrots and white onions as well as the peas.  I will definitely make again.

Chicken Vicious was okay, but I thought it was sweet and tart to the point of excess.  The heat from the chili pepper was almost to the extreme as well.  I also thought the mushroom's flavor clashed with the other flavors within the dish.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of substituting  half of the sugar with Splenda.  Less sauce might improve this dish, as the amount in the recipe is far more than needed.

Where does the vicious come in? Had to double up on the red pepper flakes, which made it better, but the SALTiness still hid alot of the flavor. Can be improved though!!

Very rarely I come across a recipe that does not deliver, and this "Chicken Vicious" is that one!  I made it to the "T" and it was horrible!  Even my husband agreed, after 3 bites, we had to stop eating it and he cooked an omelette instead*LOL*  Too sweet? too tangy?  the flavors are all wrong, I even used fresh garlic and vegetables, what a huge disappointment.  I was so looking forward to this,especially after all the rave reviews. I am a very competent chef and my husband insists it was the recipe! sorry!

I made a few changes to this and that might be why I didn't fall in love with it(to be fair). I substituted Splenda for the sugar, used broccoli instead of peas and added water chesnuts and a little shredded cabbage. I thought the sauce was a bit too tangy and a bit too sweet, so next time I make this I think I'll reduce the amounts of these items a bit and supplement the liquid with maybe some chicken stock, if needed. I did like the bite of the red pepper and when I added more it did seem to help the sauce quite a bit.

Didn't change a thing - everyone loved it and it was a quick meal to make with ingredients you normally have on hand.  We thought the taste was perfect!  My partner picked up fried rice and egg rolls on his way home and it was a nice, satisfying meal.  I will make this again and again.  Can change it by adding baby corn, water chestnuts, bean sprouts or whatever you have on hand.  Thanks submitter.

Excellent spicy dish!  Super easy to prepare, had almost all the basic ingredients already at home, just had to pick up fresh veggies.  I added broccoli and white onion slices too.  Highly recommend this!  All the dinner guests said it tasted like restaurant quality.

My hubby thinks this is the best, said it tastes just like the hunan that he gets at our favorite chinese resturant.  Brought some into work and his co-workers are always watching now to see what he brings in.  I used reg fresh mushrooms.A #1 recipe with lots of other applications potential.

Okay so I was really looking forward to trying this very simple recipe, however I am giving this a 4 cause my chicken was amazing. I am not sure what happened when or where I went wrong, something definitely happened. It may of been cause I attempted to tripple this recipe. My sauce came out like some super thick brown sugary blob. I wish I knew what happened.  I did strain it all put salvage the chicken and attempted to salvage my chicken flavor which was a success. If any one has any idea what happened to my sauce I would love to hear opinions.

This dish is okay. Definitely follow the directives regarding "to taste". It is a very ingredient-heavy recipe--I probably wouldn't make it again.

I made this as written, except using brown sugar (loosely packed).  I ended up with an unappealing black stew of indistinguishable ingredients and tough meat. It was tasty, but way too saucy to eat without rice.  Were I to make this again, I'd cut the sauce ingredients in half, and marinate the chicken in about 1/4 cup of it before cooking.  Then remove the cooked chicken, and cook the mushrooms till they shrank a bit. Maybe add some broccoli or sugar peas to up the veg quotient. Add the frozen peas to warm them, add back the chicken.  Stir half the remaining sauce into the cornstarch slurry, and add that to the pan to coat the food.  Add remaining sauce for desired consistency, sprinkle with the green onions.

This recipe is fantastic!!!  I did use fresh garlic and ginger, because I love these ingredients and I like to add some extra veggies...for instance, stir fry veggies and baby corn.

I made this for dinner with only 1 substitution. I used chopped broccoli in place of the peas. it was very good and it does kinda clear your sinuses. it's not to sweet and not to hot.next time I might cut down on the liquid a wee bit.1 cup vinegar should be enough.I will be sure to  make this again.
