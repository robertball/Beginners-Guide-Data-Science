Its a good desert easy to make and taste great I used diet jello and lite cool whip. Did not feel too guilty eating it late at night:)

This was great as written! I made it for our Christmas dinner yesterday and here are the changes I made this time: I used one small package of cranberry and one small package of raspberry jellos (rather than one large package) and stirred 2 cans of mandarin oranges into the jello portion instead of the sliced strawberries. It was absolutely delicious this way, too, and very festive! Great recipe!
