My husband adores sauerkraut and went nuts over this side. I used kraut from the bag instead of the can for a fresher taste, also used brown sugar, minced onion and caraway seeds. Tasted just like my Austrian grandmothers recipe. Thanks Anita!

We love this recipe...we use brown sugar in place of the white ....our favorite way to eat it is over hot dogs or bratwurst on a bun.  Will have to try it with pork roast, thanks!

Wow! I love traditional sauerkraut, but this recipe kicks it up a notch. I'm not one of those who loves bacon in everything, but it makes this dish. I used brown sugar to deepen the color, and I bought brown sugar cured bacon. I simmered it for about 40 minutes on the stove and added water as needed, but some of the bacon on the bottom got a little caramelized which really sent it over the top. I added about a tbsp of apple cider vinegar at the end just to balance out the sweet. BF and I loved it! Even better the next day!

I'm not sure why everyone is using brown instead of reg. sugar, I only added 2-3 tbl. butter and simmered it about 45min.-1hr. for tenderness. This was an excellent dish. Thanks Anita G. from the whole family "even the mother-in-law)

This is a wonderful change from the "sour" kraut I grew up with. It still has the great flavor of kraut but with a sweet bacony twist, the whole family enjoyed this side dish. I took your advise and made a pork rump roast as the main dish. I added 2 tbl. of butter and simmered for about 30 min. this was awsome!

This was so tasty.  My b/f is not a sauerkraut fan and refused to try it, but I loved it, and finished it off the next day. It's a keeper!

I love this recipe and I have used it many, many times! I use brown sugar instead of the white to achieve darker color kraut and sometimes I also add canned pineapple, chopped onion and caraway seeds. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Great flavor but not sure how much a "little" water is.  1 tsp, 1 cup, or cover the kraut?  I just guessed but it would have been nice to be more specific.  The taste was great as a side dish.

YUMMY!!  Two out of six of us liked kraut before this recipe.  We ALL LOVE it now!!  I used brown sugar.  I doubled the recipe, but only 1 1/2 x the sugar.  I couldn't get enough!

This was Great! I added a small sauteed onion. On the first night we ate it, I put it on bratwurst in a hot dog bun. That was good,but the bratwurst taste was overpowering, so tonight, I cut the bratwurst into pieces and added it to the kraut, and it was soo good because I could taste the kraut more(still put it in a hot dog bun). Thanks for the recipe

This was simple, cheap, and delicious! I did substitute brown sugar for color too. We had this over hot links and mustard with a side of bbq'd corn on the cob and George Killian's Irish Red. I would highly recommend this recipe!

My husbands family is all german and the first time i had this i LOVED it. i hate kraut on any thing else. the only thing different we do is: brown sugar instead of white. and we ALWAYS mix chopped hot dogs in it. and we don't add water. we serve this on top of mashed potatoes.

Pretty good-but I add 1/2 tbsp of caraway seeds, a peeled and diced apple, and a diced onion that was sauteed in the a little bit of the bacon grease. Then it was awesome!!!

This was good and I really liked the bacon but the sugar changed the flavor of the sauerkraut to much for me. Next time I'll make this and leave out the sugar.

This recipe was awesome!  My husband does not like sauerkraut, but had seconds and thirds of this recipe.  Our 3 year old also loved it.
