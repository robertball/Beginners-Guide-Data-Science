Wonderful - and so easy!  Now I can whip up some "egg" nog whenever the urge strikes since I often have these ingredients on hand (I actually substituted soy milk and used sugar-free/fat-free instant vanilla pudding).

As an option for egg-phobic or teetotallers, I recommend this for parties that you don't plan letting get out of hand due to your eggnog! Making a gallon was going to be impossible with even a doubling of the recipie, but I added to the double recipie 1 pint of heavy cream, 1/4 tsp. of vanilla extract, and a dash of cinnamon-sugar. There was enough room in the gallon jug to shake instead of stirring before serving, but enough for everyone at the party!

WAY WAY too much rum flavoring is called for in this 'nog recipe!  I only used half of the amount called for and still the intensity of the "fake" rum taste and smell was nauseating. We have made homemade eggnog before and the thought of a virtually fat free version was enticing. (Skim milk and fat free/sugar free pudding were used)   I was about to throw this all away but decided to let it sit in the refrigerator overnight and try it again in the morning.  The smell was still unappealling but the flavors blended and it didn't taste as bad as the night before.  It still wasn't "good" but it is worth trying again with A LOT less rum flavoring (maybe 1/4 teaspoon!)

This recipe is awesome!!! I am a diabetic and like heaping glasses of orange juice of years past, I thought eggnog was too a thing of the past. BUT NOT ANYMORE! Here are my changes: I used sugar-free french vanilla pudding mix, 1/2 tsp cloves, 1 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and a whopping 4 tsp imitation rum extract! I added 3 envelopes of equal to a 8 oz. cup and voila! AMAZING! No more small sips here and there of eggnog for me. And hey, my sister is my toughest critic and a HUGE eggnog lover, from way back. And she said it tasted no different! I think the rum extract really makes this drink. Do yourself a favor and try this recipe!

My daughter is allergic to eggs, so when I found this recipe I was thrilled!  It tastes just like the real thing, but doesn't leave that thick egg taste in your throat! This year was the second year I've made it, this time for my extended family.  It was so simple and easy to change the recipe amounts to fit my group size - so I didn't have to guess at the amounts.  Everyone enjoyed it; commenting a number of times "Are you sure this doesn't have eggs?"  Delicious! Thanks a bunch!!!

I love this eggnog, i never add the rum, i just dont like the flavor but i do add some cinnamon. I usualy eye ball it when adding the milk, cause i like it thick but not too thick. I use fat free milk and it still turns out quite creamy. Thanks for the great idea its a winner at my christmas party every year.

I love this recipe! I have been using at our Thanksgiving and Christmas parties for 2 years. I always get rave reviews for the eggnog. It's such a cheap and yummy alternative to store bought! I usually mix half milk, half half & half.

This egg free eggnog recipe is AMAZING!!! My son is severely allergic to eggs, and I am uncomfortable having regular eggnog in the house. I tried this recipe on New Years Eve at a family party. 6 people tried this eggnog and they all LOVED it! It tastes just like the real thing! Thank you, thank you!! I now have a safe solution and it's very cost effective, too! I tried it two ways, and both were equally delish: I made it with fat-free vanilla pudding mix and used skim milk, and it was wonderful, and still had some of the thickness you'd expect from an eggnog, but not too thick. I also tried it with 2% milk and regular pudding mix and it was just as good. I will be using the fat-free method! Guilt-free eggnog! I also did not use the run extract. I added an ounce of white rum to my glass, and that's what the others did as well. It was wonderful, and if you didn't say anything, nobody would EVER know the difference!

I thought this was very good! I actually only used a total of 3-3/4 cups of milk (I used fat free super skim). I used 2 cups to mix with the pudding mix and then only had to add 1-3/4 cups more to get it to the desired thickness. I started out only using 1 tsp. rum extract, but ended up adding more for a more 'authentic ' flavor and also used more nutmeg than called for (to taste). While this would never replace 'real ' eggnog, this was a great substitute that I would make again! Thanks for sharing. :) UPDATE: After letting it set in the fridge, it did get quite a bit thicker and I ended up having to add more milk to thin it out, so I would say that I did end up using close to the amount called for.

I came up with a recipe similar to this, before I ever found this recipe here, with s/f vanilla pudding, fat free milk, but then I add extra sugar so it still is plenty sweet but you don't get quite as many calories. I found out if you make it the day before it gets a little thinner but nice and creamy. I like a lot of rum flavoring too. Then I add Benchmark Bourbon. Great !

This works really slick with the new sugar-free instant pudding that comes in the single serving pouch. But I think the rum extract is too much. And I added a touch of cinnamon. This is best when used right away

My gram had a recipe similar to this.   YUM! I have kids and don't like to use raw egg, but they love eggnog (non alcoholic of course) so this recipe is perfect. If you don't like rum flavor, try Almond extract instead.  It's delish :)

I made this with actual rum instead of the rum-flavored extract--it was pretty good. I used 1/2 cup of Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum. With the other ingredients, it tasted a little bland, so I added some extra nutmeg and also about 1/2 tsp. of ground cloves and 1/2 tsp. of vanilla extract. With the extra spices, it tasted more like eggnog, in my opinion. Maybe my problem was not using the extract, but, no matter--with the real rum & extra spices, it was delicious. I put this in an empty milk jug, which worked out well for storing and pouring at a Christmas gathering. Not glamorous, but incredibly functional.

I rate this 5 stars for its great substitution for real eggnog.  Taste is very close to real eggnog but with a much better price tag.  Although, I still prefer to eat real eggnog.  I did not add rum flavoring but added vanilla in its place.  Thanks for the recipe.

My husband and I loved this egg nog.  I used just what I had on hand for milk, so it was 3 cups of skim and 1 1/2 cups of low fat buttermilk, but it came out nicely.  I wish the original recipe had included the alcohol, though.  I went ahead and tried 3/4 cup of rum and  1/4 cup of bourbon whiskey because I thought that was how much liquor the other recipes call for, but it was so strong next time I will use less rum.

This recipe is pretty good when it's first made.  I didn't add the rum flavoring, as it was for my children and I didn't feel it was necessary.

Next time (yes, there might be a next time) I'll use cream in place of some of the milk.  It's a little thin for eggnog, but the taste is definately there.

The next day is was fairly thick and the good taste was pretty much gone.  I was actually really disappointed.

I made it and used actual rum because I'm in an adult household. It was excellent. The only thing that keeps me from drinking eggnog is...well, the eggs. So this was a perfect substitute and couldn't be easier.

I am pregnant and we have a little one in our household, so a traditional raw egg eggnog was out of the question. I just made this recipe and we enjoyed it while we decorated the Christmas tree. However, since I can't stand anything that comes out of a box, I made a basic french vanilla homemade pudding that you can find anywhere (basically using milk, eggs, sugar and corn starch) and then continued with the recipe (adding rum extract to the final product and adding Mount Gay rum individually to the mugs of the other adults in attendance who wanted more of a bang). One word:  WONDERFUL! My in-laws are coming for Christmas dinner this year right after going to see ''The Nutcracker'' with us. I will definitely be serving this warm and satisfying beverage after dinner since my sister-in-law is also pregnant and she has a three year-old. Thank you, Trybonun!

In my opinion, this recipe calls for way too much milk

I've never been good at seperating eggs, so I decided to give this a try.

I found the consistancy is a bit too watery. I tried leaving it overnight in the hopes it might thicken up, but it just became a bit lumpy. 

I also found the taste rather bland. More a vaguely sweet milkiness than anything else. I left out the rum flavoring, so it might taste better if you like the taste of rum.

This is a great recipe.  I added sugar to satisfy my sweet tooth and liked it better. The french vanilla pudding makes it a true egg nog color.

I love store bought eggnog. I tried homemade eggnog and feel it's too egg-y.  Came across a similar recipe, like this on Pinterest.  I used white chocolate pudding mix, with 4 cups 1/2% milk and  2 cups 2%. Didn't use rum extract. Added 1/3 cup sugar and a few sprinkles of nutmeg and cinnamon. Came out good. Will make again.

This is delicious!!! It tastes like regular eggnog. The recipe calls for 6 cups milk total per 3.5 oz pudding packet, but I used just 4 cups, and that seemed like the right consistency to me.
