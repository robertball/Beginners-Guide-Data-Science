I made this in the slow cooker, and the family *loved* it!  I used pre-cooked grilled chicken strips, frozen stir fry vegetables, a can of pineapple and some sweet and sour sauce. Cooked on low all day, then spooned over white rice. It was so easy I feel like I cheated!

I started my review & hit the 'done' button on my phone before I was finished! So here's the rest: I cooked my rice as per box directions; added some to stir-fry & left some in separate bowl. I also added sesame seeds. Sauce is thin but it's still good. Really good recipe, THANKS! OK, now I'm done!!

This recipe was quick and easy, which was what I was looking for. I felt it was rather bland and the rice was still on the hard side. The vegetables can be interchanged according to your preference.

Super easy to make and my picky eater kids loved it! Planning to add this to our meal rotation. I made brown rice separately rather than cooking it with the rice.

I wanted to make something quick and this definitely was an easy recipe! The only problem I had was that it was bland. Added more sweet and sour and salt & pepper to my serving (as did my family). This was just my preference, others may find it okay sticking to the recipe. I will try it again but may tweak it by marinading the chicken first (Lawry's Szechuan Sweet & Sour BBQ maybe?)

This was a great recipe. I did add a little more sweet and Sour Sauce. It was even better re heated.
