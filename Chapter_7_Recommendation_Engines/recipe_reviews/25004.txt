In defense of Tom, the man who submitted this recipe, there looks to be a few people who gave this recipe a lower rating based on the fact they had problems with the cream.  To those users I'd like to say that your cream was not bad but simply, you whipped it for too long.  Heavy cream that has been whipped for long periods of time will eventually go past that beautiful "stiff peak" stage into a less appealing state of ..... you guessed it, butter!  Hence the butter churn from days gone by.  The milky substance that accompanies the butter is known as buttermilk. (thanks grandma) I hope other users have found this information helpful and to those who already knew this..... my apologies!!  Otherwise, great recipe Tom!!

OH SO GOOD...I made this recipe after reading the reviews and decided to use powdered sugar instead of granulated.It was very smooth.I would HIGHLY reccomend that you put bowl,beaters and even the heavy whipping cream into the freezer for 10 min. prior to whipping.It stiffened up nice and quick. I want to mention that I used heavy whipping cream instead of just heavy cream(not sure if it makes a difference)I used it on a Duncan Hines strawberry cake(2 layers) and it's a great contrast against the sweetness of the cake.If you want it a little sweeter add an extra 1/2c. powdered sugar.

This was a great recipe, and I would make it again.  Here's what I did different, based on other reviews:  chilled bowl, whip, and whipping cream in freezer for 10 minutes before whipping it up;  used 1 pint whipping cream, 1 pint HEAVY whipping cream;  used approximately 3/4 cup powdered sugar in place of granulated (measured it first, then sifted into cream cheese mixture).  SO!  It was yummy and I will be making it again!  I highly recommend this recipe if you are looking for something nice and light-tasting (but not light calorie wise!)

For the person who had trouble with the softness of the frosting, just add one package/cup of cream of Dr. Oetikers Whip-it stabilizer.  This is my standard frosting for decorating cakes and it is great to work with once the stabilizer has been added.

This recipe is a definite winner in the taste category.  As someone with lots of cake decorating experience, I would say this is a wonderful filling, but is not suited for frosting (unless you just dollop it on top).  This recipe is VERY soft, and does NOT firm up upon refigeration like a buttercream.  I made a double batch to decorate a large cake and ditched that plan shortly after I started decorating.  I froze this double batch until I thought of a use for it (decided to add it to leftover white rice, added a bit of milk, cinnamon, and a touch more vanilla... it was the most delicious rice pudding imagineable).  I might use it as a tart filling sometime, topped with seasonal fruits.  Really delicious stuff.  PS - I read that it piped well, but I have enough decorating experience to tell that was not going to be the case.

This whipped cream frosting is awesome!  But, I had to add another 3 oz. of cream cheese and 2 tbsp. of white sugar and a splash more of vanilla to get it to pipe.  I know this goes without saying, but make sure your bowl and beater are well chilled!  This is a definite keeper!

This is a wonderfully light and fluffy frosting.  It’s not too sweet.  It’s like a whipped cream frosting with a hint of cream cheese or an extremely light and airy version of a cream cheese frosting.  It's easy to make.  I’ve received several compliments and requests for this recipe.

Although delicious, this was not what I was looking for in a frosting.  It turned out incredibly runny and I ended up having to dip the tops of my cupcakes in order to apply it.

I put this on an angel food cake I made from scratch...I've never made frosting, never mind a cake, from scratch before and I got rave reviews.  Several people told me it was the best cake they'd EVER had!

Made this frosting to go on Creamy Coconut Cake (this site) - delicious.  I left out the salt, and used two cups of whipped cream.  I used my Kitchenaid mixer and whipped the cream first (stiff).  Placed the whipped cream in another bowl, then I put the cream cheese (room temperature), sugar and vanilla in the mixer (left out the salt).  I mixed this till light and fluffy.  Then removing the bowl from the mixer, I folded the whipped cream in by hand with a spatular, in about three additions, till it was completely incorporated.  It is delicious.  What impressed me so much is that after three days in the frig., the icing had not deflated at all.  Still looks very fresh.  Doesn't have a strong cream cheese taste either.  Very good.  Will make for other cakes and cupcakes.  Just keep refrigerated after you make it.  Thanks Allrecipes and Tom.

This was fantastic. I am a fan of whipped icing, because of the light texture of it. However, I have a soft spot for the sweet richness of cream cheese icing. This recipe was the best of both worlds. I would recommend that you make sure your cream and beaters are quite cold, as other have suggested. Also, whip it and then allow it to set up while you are preparing the cream cheese portion. Then fold the whipped cream into the mixture and allow the icing to chill until you need it, with a piece of plastic wrap pressed lightly to the surface to prevent drying or moisture build up. All in all, a perfect frosting.

I added food coloring to the cream cheese mixture before folding in the whipped cream, then used it to frost cupcakes.  This is a great recipe: light, fluffy, and not too sweet.

This is by far the best cream cheese recipe around.  I made it before for my roommates birthday and it got rave reviews.  Now I'm on a low carb diet and made it with "Splenda". I whipped the cream and added a few packets of Splena until I like the sweetness and put it in the fridge.  Then I whipped the cream cheese with a pinch of salt, vanilla & a little half & half (for smoothness) and added a little more Splenda.  Then once the whipped cream was nice and firm, I folded it into the cream cheese mixture and put it back in the fridge.  I let it set for an hour and then spooned it in a ziplock bag, cut the tip off and piped this wonderful icing over carrot cupcakes and served them for dessert for my boyfriends birthday.  His family LOVED them and I received a comment that the the icing was "WICKED GOOD!"  I will be making this icing from now on!

Delicious! And so easy. I used it in my strawberry shortcake for a little something extra and it turned out amazing. I really hesitate to use plain old whipped cream on stuff after this!

This was a great frosting. Used 1.5 cups of powdered sugar like others had stated, also put the bowl and beaters in the freezer which I always do when whipping cream. Stood up well, will definitely make this again. 
Thanks for sharing Tom

Thanks for a great recipe!  I used this one when I was looking for a white *light* tasting frosting to make a Stars and Stripes cake for Memorial Day.  This worked perfectly and was even good at being piped on to make the white stars on the blueberries.  The taste is fantastic and went very well with the strawberries and blueberries. I even piped the leftover frosting on top of some of the leftover strawberries. Yum!! This is in my keep forever file!

This is a very good recipe.Tastes very good as well as it piped well for me.I don;t know why so many others had problems with it liquifying..I used it to decorate a birthday cake for my friend's son and it came out excellent.I even added colour to some of it and cocoa powder to some of it to use for piping the edges and other decorations.A keeper,definitely.

Probably the best frosting I've ever made. It definitely takes cream cheese frosting up a notch. I wasn't very successful folding in the whipped cream to the cream cheese mixture; so instead, I used my mixer on low and it worked great.

Used powdered sugar instead of granulated.  I added drained, crushed pineapple and coconut for something different.  It was delicious!

I made this recipe tonight and it was so easy and delicious.  It isn't so sweet that it overpowers the cake.  It is just the right balance.  I did chill my bowl and beaters and it only took about 3-4 minutes to beat the heavy cream to perfection.  I will use this recipe again for sure!

made this to go on a white cake with a strawberry white chocolate mousse filling and it was perfect. i only used 3/4 of a cup of suagar and it came out perfect. no problems with consistency or taste. as another reveiwer stated be careful when whipping your cream becuse it can go from stiff peaks to overwhipped(aka butter) very fast, also i always use a frozen bowl and beaters to whip cream. this will be my go to cream cheese frosting from now on. thanks for the great recipe.

Easy to make and fluffy. When making whipped cream, it is a MUST to freeze the bowl and whisk - makes for a sturdy whip cream. Also, be sure your whisk and bowl are free from oils. This recipe is very cream cheesy, so if you don't like too much cream cheese flavor, be sure to adjust recipe to accommodate your tastes. Many reviews said this was "not too sweet" I have to disagree. I didn't even put in the whole amount of sugar and was a bit surprised it was so sweet. Based on reading the other reviews, I thought taking down the sugar for my tastes would be good. For those of you who like things less sweet I recommend 1/2 C of sugar. Next time I make this (there will be definitely a next time) I will add way less sugar, unless I add cocoa powder....or lemon zest...or....mmmm, now I'm ready to make more ;) Happy baking!

I made this for cake for my mother's birthday.  My mom said she had never seen cake fly out of the house so quickly!  It was outstanding!  I followed the advice of others and used confectioner's sugar, and also a cold bowl and beaters.  Definitely a keeper!

This frosting is to die for! It spreads really well (unlike most cream cheese frostings) and the taste just melts in your mouth. Perfect for the person who thinks most frostings are too sweet. Thank you so much for this outstanding recipe! My mother in law snatched the recipe away from me. She cooks for a living and has much more experience under her belt than me. Thanks again!

I would give this 10 stars if I could. Easy to make and is simply amazing. Nothing to add, no further step were taken. Love this and will be used any time frosting is needed. The ONLY problem I had was that, after frosting two French Silk Pies, there was a lot left over.

Easy and tasty. I made the recipe exactly as written including granulated sugar, to use with a Cassata recipe on this site. I put the cream cheese out in a bowl to soften for a bit, tried mixing in the sugar etc. by hand but it wasn't mixing easily. So I put it aside while I whipped the cream in a different bowl, then used the electric hand mixer on the cream cheese (didn't bother to wash the beaters, as the cream was going right in there anyway). I did use the mixer to combine the whipped cream and the cream cheese mixture. 

The resulting frosting was soft and fluffy. I tried piping it onto the side of the cake but gave that up pretty quickly and just spread it there with a knife, then piped rosettes on the top for a decorative effect.  It held up surprisingly well in the fridge - I was worried it would slide down the sides of the cake and that the rosettes would sag into a layer of mush, but as of this morning they were still rosettes.  The cream cheese flavor is more subtle than a traditional cream cheese frosting made with butter, but it is definitely there. 

I'll play around with this in the future - I think alternate flavorings (e.g. orange or rum extract) depending on the cake, or perhaps adding some melted chocolate or cocoa powder, would be fun. I don't think it would work well in the middle of a multi-layer cake since it's such a soft frosting.

I made this according to the recipe except I used powdered sugar instead of white sugar.  I used it for the extreme chocolate cake from this site (instead of the buttercream frostring it calls for).  It was delicious.  Everyone loved it and several said it was the best cake frosting they'd ever had.

So delicious!  I did use powdered sugar, so I think that made it hold its shape better.  The flavor was fantastic, tasted exactly like a cream cheese frosting but light and less sweet. I was to to pipe this frosting just fine.  I piped fast, as the more the bag was in my had, the warmer the frosting got.  Refrigerated, the frosting still held.  I also put my metal bowl and beaters in the freezer for my whipped cream for about 10 minutes.  It really makes a difference to freeze the bowl/beater, and the metal bowls hold their temperature better than a glass or plastic bowl.

This frosting was great! I didn't change anything in the actual recipe, just the method. I made sure to chill the cream, beaters and my bowl before I began and it turned out great; a much better alternative for a lighter "summer" frosting as opposed to a heavier buttercream.

Fantastic!  I've added a 1/4 of a vial of Dr. O's lemon flavour.   Also, once I've folded the whipped cream into the cream cheese frosting, I whipped it for about 30 seconds on medium-low.  It's important NOT TO OVERWHIP it, so you have to pay attention.  The flavour was fantastic, the texture silky, and it worked wonderfully with sponge cake and strawberries.  I made this cake for a friends's brithday today and it was a huge success!  We also had to transport it for an hour, and it held up wonderfully right out of my fridge and back into one once we arrived at our destination.  Thank you, Tom Parker!!!

This is very good.  The cream cheese gave it a great consistency.  Very easy to make.  I added melted chocolate to mine.  Cool the chocolate before adding.  Makes more than enough frosting for a two layer cake.

WOW! This is the 3rd time i've used this recipe & I will never use any other frosting for my cakes EVER again! My husband eats the leftover frosting right out of the bowl! I used 2/3 cup powdered sugar instead of the regular sugar. (Too much sweetness can ruin the "fluffiness" taste). I usually make the frosting ahead of time and refrigerate it to make it a little more easy to work with. I used a butter recipe white cake mix and layered it with strawberries & bananas. Every time i've made this cake, people ask for my business card...thank you!!!!

Terrific! I used this frosting on the "Wondeful Banana Cake" recipe and everyone loved it!  I've had several requests for this recipe.  It's a keeper.  Don't pass this one up.

Great cream cheese frosting that is fluffier than traditional cream cheese frosting. I used powdered sugar instead but should have reduced quality as it came out a bit too sweet for my taste.

Awesome recipe.  People accustomed to Asian pastries find typical American frosting and cakes too sweet and this is a light frosting that is delicious and easy to work with.  I cut the sugar to 3/4c and it was sweet enough.  I didn't have any problems with frosting being too runny. It may help to know that the "Joy of Cooking" says that beating the cream cheese too long will make it lose its stiffness.  So, only beat the cream cheese mixture until just blended and smooth and fold in the whipped cream and don't use the mixer again for this step.  Hope that helps.

I don't know why I haven't reviewed this recipe -- I've been using it for over 3 years now. It's a soft, light casual frosting to swirl in billows nice and thick. I actually prefer to frost the cake the night before serving and let the frosting settle a bit in the fridge, it's still light that way but just a bit denser. It goes particularly well with cakes containing citrus flavor or filled with lemon curd. Leftover frosting is great on strawberries. You MUST beat the cream cheese and sugar mixture until it's smooth as silk.

This was great frosting. I made sure to freeze the bowl before I whipped the cream and it made a big difference in the consistency. It was fluffy and easy to spread.

This is a really good frosting, I used it for a 4th of July flag cake.  Using a regular box mix and blueberries and strawberries for the stars and stripes.  Can't wait for an excuse to make it again soon.

Best every a must try & then use forever!!! Turned out PERFECT and this was the FIRST time I ever made frosting from scratch!!!  Forgot to add vanilla and was still WONDERFUL! Prep time for me was only 10 minutes.  Used metal bowl and beaters that I put in freezer for about 10 minutes.  Had a very light cream cheese flavor.

By far one of the best frostings I've ever made! I used it on strawberry cake and red velvet cake and both times they were a hit. To change it up a bit I added some mint tea flakes and black tea flakes it it, which honestly I wasn't too sure about. However it only made it more delicious. I also used powdered sugar instead of regular sugar and made sure to check the frosting every few beats to reduce over beating. Best whipped cream recipe ever! I highly recommend it.

I absolutely loved this frosting. I made some filled chocolate cupcakes, and this was the perfect taste to top it off (no pun intended... okay... maybe a little intended!) GREAT alternative to a basic frosting. I had absolutely no troubles with the whipping cream... although, I did soften my cream cheese a bit too much (almost melted! whoops!) It still had a great consistency and held up nicely on my cupcakes. I used a pastry bag to put it in/on my cupcakes, and they looked great. Thanks!

This was exactly what I was looking for.  It is a little soft (hey it is whip cream) but sets up beautifully.  I filled and frosted a vanilla two layer cake then popped the whole thing in the freezer for an hour to set up!  I topped it with blueberries, raspberries and strawberries and it was a hit!

This was delicious but I had a hard time getting the whipped cream to blend evenly into the cream cheese - maybe I needed to soften it more.  I used the method from "Sturdy Whipped Cream Frosting" where you simply pour the cream into the cream cheese and sugar mixture.  Perfect and perfectly blended!

I made this for a devil food cake... YUMMY!!!  I already have birthday requests for this yummy frosting.  I did add a little vanilla SYRUP to the whipped cream before beating and I did not beat completely so I could beat together with cream cheese mix.  Turned out great!

I used this for a two-layer birthday sheet cake, so I doubled the recipe.  I also followed the advice of others and substituted confectioner's sugar for the granulated, used "heavy whipping cream" and chilled my bowl and beaters.  What I changed myself is the folding into the cream cheese.  I found that the two mixtures were not blending well just by folding.  So, I figured I'd try beating it at low speed just enough to blend everything.  Not only did this do the trick, but the frosting got just a bit stiffer, too!  So, I frosted the cake with it, but I piped decorations with it, also!  It tastes delicious, too!  The party's tomorrow - we'll see what the guests think...

I would give it a 5 if it was stiff enough to pipe. Wonderful flavor, not overpowering or too sweet, very subtle and easy to make. This will go with anything. I followed the directions exactly and had no problems with the cream. I whipped it in my KitchenAid instead of a hand-held. As others have mentioned this is a 'soft' frosting. I scratch coated my cake and froze for 45 mins. while refrigerating the remaining frosting. It spread very easily and the final product looks dreamy.

This frosting worked perfectly for the angel food cupcakes I made last month.  It was as I hoped it would be - right between whipped topping and traditional icing.  Plus I found it to be the right level of sweet for me, as I'm not a fan at all of buttercream frosting.

Like other sugessted, I used powdered sugar and put the bowl and beaters in the freezer before whipping the heavy cream.  I had no problem at all with other's complaints about it being runny.  

Although... while I was topping the cupcakes I was "testing" it with strawberries.  So I'm going to make another batch this weekend as a fruit dip :)

Excellent, very light and decadent. I used it to decorate a rich chocolate cake. Very good combination.

Fabulous!  I've made this many times, to rave reviews.  It's light, fluffy, and has none of that crisco aftertaste.  Great recipe!

This is the best frosting ever!  The perfect sweetness, creaminess & great consistancy for spreading on a cake!  Also, it is extremely easy to make... This is going to be the frosting on my son's first birthday!

I loved this frosting and it was very easy for me to make. I don't bake often so I followed some of the other recomendations like making the whip cream first in a chilled bowl with cold cream and beaters. I made the cream cheese mix in the warmed bowl and evrything turned out perfect. Thanks Tom!

This is a very good tasting frosting.  I was looking for Cream Cheese or Cheesecake Filling & decided to try this one.  It was perfect.  I made it to fill the Strawberry Dream Cake I off this site, and it went together perfectly.  I had several compliments & many people going back for seconds...I will definately use this recipe again.

This is the best frosting ever!!! I usually use it on a chocolate cake with strawberry filling, it turns out amazing.  Whenever I make it people always ask me for the recipe.  Definately try this one, it is a keeper.

I used the confectioners sugar while making this frosting for a sugar cookie cake.  My partner did not think that the frosting was sweet enough, but did get quite a few compliments from our guests.

I thought it tasted very good, but the consistency was too runny for cupcakes.  I had to pitch it & open canned frosting.  Maybe this would be good for a filling.

I was doing wonderfully with making this recipe until I got to the heavy whipping cream. I followed the instructions on the carton such as chilling the bowl and beaters before whipping the cream. After soft peaks formed I gradually added 2 tbls. sugar and continued beating. Stiff peaks were just forming when the whole batch began to liquify. I had to toss it down the disposal since it was then unuseable. Thank goodness I had a large tub of Cool Whip in the freezer. The 9 x 12 Strawberry cake is now frosted and in the refrigerator. Tomorrow I plan to add thinly sliced, and lightly sugared strawberries to top it all off. I wished the recipe had come out as written, because there is nothing better than real whipped cream. Hmm, maybe the heavy whipping cream was outdated? Other than the snafu with the whipping cream the frosting still turned out pretty well. It is still a tad on the thin side for me and I'm hoping it will firm up in the refrigerator overnight.

Very, very tasty.  It made a standard white cake spectacular.  You can tell the cream cheese is there, but it is still very different from a standard cream cheese frosting.

Holy cow, it's a good thing that this makes so much frosting because by the time I was done eating it out of the bowl I wasn't sure there'd be enough for the cake :)

Great taste, my family loved the taste but it does not stand up well as a frosting. I should have read other review before I made it and I would have known. Would be a great topping for single servings though. I used it on a layer cake as the filling in the middle then frosted the outside with chocolate.It made a great filling.

cream cheese in my country is expensive so to cut down cost, i've tried the frosting with 1/2 the cream cheese stated in the recipe and 1/2 the amount of sugar. it still turns out beautifully and yummy.  i think it's healthier too.

After reading the reviews about it not being stiff or heavy enough to pipe, I followed some of the suggestions in the reviews. I put in 11oz of cream cheese and used 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar instead of granulated sugar. What I got in return was a heavier frosting that can be piped and hold up. I did put the whipped cream (after whipping) in the freezer while I was mixing up the cream cheese and powdered sugar, etc. And I put it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes before I was ready to pipe it. The taste is delicious!

This is the Best. Remember to use COLD bowl to whip cream and WARM bow to mix other items! I am sure you can flavor and tint as you desire and it holds up to room temperature fantastically.  That fact surprised me.  It should pipe well.  This also freezes well so you don't waste a spoonful.  Everyone loved it, not too sweet.

My five year old daughter made this with me yesterday. I usually follow the instructions first time and see what I think and tweak a recipe after. She had carried out the powdered sugar from the pantry and I used it before I realized it called for granulated. This is light and lovely frosting. It is not thick traditional frosting. I would not ice a cake with this one day and leave it for tomorrow's dinner. This is fresh not chemically stabilized icing: it is very good.

Delicious and super easy!  I did the whipped cream first since I only have one bowl for my mixer.  Then I transferred it in another bowl while I mixed the cream cheese then folded it back in.  My husband raved about how tasty it was.  Thanks for the recipe!

It was exactly what I wanted...whipped cream needs to be done exactly as stated.  I always chill my beaters and bowl when whipping cream.  I did use regular white sugar and it worked well.  I used it on a buttercream cake and topped the frosting with fresh strawberries and blueberries...rave review from family and guests!

I followed some of the tips and used icing sugar. We also used strawberry flavoured cream cheese. It was a big hit! It tastes great, not too heavy or sweet. It holds together nicely and keeps its shape when frosting with a piping bag.

I made this today because I wanted a whipped cream that I could pipe, and it worked out perfectly. It took awhile for the whipped cream to stiffen, but it was totally worth it. Also I could not fold the whipped cream and cream cheese mixture together very well so I had to mix it for a second and it was still delicious, I couldn't stop eating it right out of the bowl. I did use powdered sugar (about 1.5 cups) I don't know if that would make a difference but it was all I had. Thanks so much  for this recipe, I added it to my box and I am sure I will use it again.

Normally I stick to butter cream frosting but I wanted to try something different. I love this frosting. What I do to be able to pipe it is I make the frosting one day before I plan on using it and put it in the fridge over night. That makes it much easier to use. Thank you for posting this, its awesome! :)

I really enjoyed this whipped cream frosting. I personally would of have preferred to use less cream cheese. The cream cheese was a little strong, but overall this is a really good frosting. I am not sure how it would sit, so I would have to wait and see.

This frosting is AMAZING!! Def a keeper! I followed the instructions exactly and it was super easy. Didn't take me 2 hours though so I don't know where that came from. I wouldn't change anything about it. Perfect just the way it is!!

Absolutely delicious. A perfect frosting for the Pumpkin Ginger Cupcakes by OVIEDOGIRL. To further compliment the cupcakes, I did add a splash of vanilla and pumpkin spice to the heavy whipping cream. With the exception of the two additions. I made the recipe exactly as written and it was perfect. I refrigerated the leftover frosting and its structure has remained if not improved. Well done, Tom Parker!

I made this recipe for the "banana bars" recipe on this site.The combination is wonderful, although I wouldn't really call this a frosting. It is more of a flavored whipped cream. I just put a spoonful on top of each piece of cake that I cut.
Also, I omitted the salt.

Super easy and light frosting! If you like super sweet frosting then you need to add more sugar or pick a different frosting. I did use powdered sugar instead of the granulated but I forgot to put everything in the fridge to cool off beforehand. Otherwise, this was an excellent recipe and I will definitely use it again!

Very good recipe. Tastes amazing. I find it amazing that people give bad reviews when it's obvious that THEY did something wrong. Or when they completely change the recipe and then rate the recipe based on the changes they made.

I'm not sure about this one... I like it yet there's something I dont care for about it. My husband says its too cheesy? maybe too rich? I was nervous because it didnt whip together the easiest but once it came together I liked the consistency.  Verdict is still out. I will try it again on a different cake.

I made this for my daughter's 1st birthday cake, and it was a hit.  Though other reviewers recommended confectioner's sugar, I had no problems with regular granulated.  I did take the advice of reviewers who suggested chilling both bowl and beaters for whipping the cream.  Will make again.

VERY GOOD!  I made this frosting to go with a lemon cake that I'd made, so I added the zest and juice from a small lemon, and the flavor/texture of the frosting was so light and citrusy.  Amazing! I also didn't have the recipe in front of me, just committed it to memory--I kind of "messed it up" by whipping the cream cheese mixture first, then just directly pouring in the heavy cream as I whipped it and it turned out just fine.  Will definitely be using this recipe from here on out (and this was my first cake and frosting from scratch)!

I used 3/4 cup confectioners sugar. I added 1 tbsp grated orange peel and it was 'out of this world'! I used it as a topping for a ginger spice cake. Yum! Would make an excellent fresh fruit dip too! Excellent, easy, and I actually had all the ingredients for it.

Great recipe, and very simple to make.  After reading other reviews I substitued powdered sugar in place of the granulated sugar and it turned out fantastic.  I used this frosting on a cassata cake, also from this website, and the two were a perfect compliment.

This frosting is very good and certainly does make for a nice change of pace.  I am not a fan of butter cream frostings, so this works for me.  The only thing I changed about this recipe is the white sugar. Confectioners sugar works much better and makes for a much smoother, fluffier frosting.

I didn't have heavy cream so I ommited it altogether.  The frosting still tasted great, just like the stuff on top of a cinnabon.

Holy Cow was this ever good!  Tastes like that cream cheeese/Fluff mixture that we make for strawberries in the summer.  Served it with a strawberry cake for an early Xmas celebration.  Big hit. Easy to make too.

I loved this recipe.  It does have a cream cheese "tang".  I put it on a chocolate cake. I will use it again.

Frostings are too sweet and too heavy for me.  Therefore, I am usually left dissatisfied with cakes; even my own!  That is until I tried this receipe.  It comes highly recommended by me.

This is hands down the best frosting I have ever tasted. It is not too sweet like many others.  I don't agree with other users about it not being a good frosting to frost a cake with. I made a white cake and added strawberries in the middle and on top and it was out of this world, not even a crumb left. It holds up very well and I think I have found my new stand by. Thanks for sharing this one Tom!

I made cupcakes from the Deep Dark Chocolate Cake and served them with this frosting at my daughter's playgroup.  I found that the 10 and under generation doesn't like the frosting, but that just meant there was more for the adults!

I love this recipe as it really is stable; it lasts for several days, even with fruit on it.  I used mascarpone cheese instead of the cream cheese and reduced the heavy cream to 1 1/4 cups, as I prefer the creamy flavor of the mascarpone rather than the slight tang of the cream cheese.  Either way, it's heavenly.

The first time I made this was with my grandson and we dumped un-whipped whipping cream in the cream cheese mixture. So we made the best of it and beat it till we got to set up. Wasn't bad even with the mistake. I made it again tonight the right way. Took some of the other reviews advice and got the bowl, beaters, and whipping cream very cold. Came out great again and better.

Deeeeeelicious! Lighter than a buttercream, I definitely wouldn’t try to pipe decorations with it, BUT it’s perfect if you just need a simple white frosting. I put it on a dark chocolate fudge bundt cake, but I’m thinking it would be excellent on a yellow or strawberry cake... or maybe as a cookie frosting even. Will definitely make again.

I loved this recipe, I did make a couple of substitutions; I used powdered sugar, I accidentally forgot the salt, and I only had one cup of whipping cream (which I sweetened with some of the powdered sugar).  This frosting holds up wonderfully!!  I tastes great too!

I was actually really disappointed with this one. The reason I gave it a low rating was probably because the taste doesn't match the name. Even with the ingredients, I was thinking it would taste more like the whipped frosting, so I was disappointed when it tasted like cream cheese frosting. I am not a super-sweet person, but I ended up needing to add more sugar to the recipe. Maybe I made it wrong, but I was pretty sure I measured everything out. Texture was good and I thought it tasted even better the second day after it had been refrigerated longer. I think if this was called a cream cheese frosting and a little more sugar was added, it would be a solid 4 star recipe. Thanks for sharing!

My family does not like their deserts to be super sweet. I made this twice. Once with sugar and once with powdered sugar. The taste was basically the same but the texture was better with the powdered sugar. The little kids swore the one with powdered sugar was better. The sweetness was perfect.

OMG, I think I just had a religious experience!   I followed the recipe to the letter and it came out wonderful.  Rich, fluffy and delicious.  I used hand mixer to whip the cream, which is more difficult than using the stand mixer because it is very hard to tell when the cream is at the right consistency and you can easily over whip.  I am saving this one in the recipe archives.

I  followed the recipe, including chilling the bowl, but I mixed the  whipping cream first with the whisk on my KitchenAid mixer  and put it in the fridge in the stainless steel bowl.  Then I mixed the cream cheese, sugar, almond and cream of tartar until creamy.  I spooned the cream cheese mixture into the whipping cream mixing it with the whisk on the KitchenAid.   I wanted a pink piped border and it turned out fine. ( I just realized I left out the salt.)

I was looking for r a cream cheese frosting that was not as sweet as the normal frostings. This was the perfect one. I used it in conjunction with SAMs carrot cake also found on this site. Both were a huge hit. I made it as directed without any changes, and was able to pipe decorations on the cake as it was a birthday cake.

Wow!  A great frosting recipe. This my first time trying this frosting recipe.  This will be our family go to frosting from now on.  I used 8oz from the 16oz size of Phil cream cheese spread, 3/4 cup of powdered sugar.  Achieving stiff peaks with the cream, and using the whisk, I added the cream cheese to the whipped cream.  I turned the whisk on low and there you have it.  The extra we will use as a fruit dip.

This came out great! I chilled my bowl, mixer, and heavy cream in the freezer for 10 minutes before whipping. I also added about a teaspoon of coconut flavoring and it tastes amazing! Very light, I put it on a blueberry cake and it's great! Will make this again

I found a new recipe that I will be using for a long time. It's amazingly light and fluffy, but still has a distinct cream cheese taste. I used 3/4 cup of sugar and no salt. This frosting was so easy to spread and pipes beautifully.

This is the BEST frosting I have come across. Made it for my grandson's birthday dinner and my daughter in law and I finished licking beaters spatula bowl knife and decided this is a keeper.  Thank you Tom and Allrecipe.

Mine was a little soft at first,  but after folding in the whipped cream,  I was able to beat it again and it stiffened right up.  Tastes great!!!! Will be using it in a wedding cake this week!

So so good! It was not runny at all and tasted so good! If you're getting a runny frosting make sure you whip it more than you would for just regular whipped cream, but don't over whip it. Also you want to make sure you are folding in the cream cheese and not stirring it in, also it will help to not fold it in too much. I did all this and had perfect frosting. I loved it!

I used powdered sugar instead of granulated like others suggested. This frosting was absolutely amazing! It's so light and delicious! It went so well with my carrot cake and I had absolutely no problem piping with it. Highly recommend this recipe!

Turned out fantastic!!! I was sceptical though, because I thought the plain white sugar was going to make the frosting grainy and it did, as soon as I made it. But one day or, hours later the grains had gone! It surely is something!!!

This was perfect! Super easy, super tasty, and spread perfectly onto the cake. I made it exactly per Tom's directions. I made a white cake with strawberry topping, vanilla custard filling, and used this frosting to go around the outside of the cake. Soooo good!! I will make this frosting again and again! Thank you Tom!

Amazing!  I was looking for a topping for my mini cheesecakes (cookies & cream).  What a perfect match!  I did substitute confectioners sugar for the white sugar to make the topping a little stiffer.   This is definitely going into my saved recipes.  Thank you!

Just whipped this recipe together and it was perfect. I was able to frost a two layer strawberry filled cake. This recipe was easy. I seen there was some discussion with consistency of this recipe and what I have found is that if u use heavy whipping cream in frostings and want a "sturdy, soft" frosting .....whip the heavy cream until it starts to look curdled. It will then hold.

This is a delicious frosting but mine ended up being waaaaay too runny or heavy to frost my strawberry cake. I've looked a couple of things that I may have done wrong....and I did not chill the frosting. However it felt cool and was about as stiff as whipped cream (cool whip), so wasn't sure if maybe the 1&1/2 cup whipped cream is too much?

This is so delicious!! I chilled my bowl, beaters, and whipping cream. I also used 1 cup confectioners sugar instead of granulated. It came out perfect and was super easy to ice the cake with!! Topping it off with some fresh strawberries too!!

This wasn't exactly the recipe I was looking for, but it ended up to be one of those "golden mistakes" .  This is not the type of whipped cream frosting that one would find at a bakery, but it has this nice tang to it that reminds me of cheese kolacky filling. In fact, that inspired me to add a tiny bit of lemon juice to it that really complimented the strawberry filling in the cupcakes I baked. Thanks for the recipe!

best icing ever!
i will diffidently do it again
what i did is chill bowl 
and it is important to not whip the cream to much
once you have folded the cream cheese i gave it another whip
and it ended out perfectly!

This was AMAZING. I was trying to find a frosting that would compliment the flavor of my angel food cupcakes, and then I came across this recipe. I put the frosting into a pastry bag and piped it onto my cupcakes in swirls. I actually started giggling because they looked so perfect and tasted so good. This recipe is definitely a keeper. =D
For the record: (I used heavy whipping cream) I whipped the cream in my KitchenAid mixer on the highest speed with the whisk attachment because I couldn't find my hand mixer. It turned out nicely. =)

Thanks for a great recipe-I read other reviewers and chilled the bowl for whipped cream first. I reversed the order and whipped the cream first and then refrigerated that while I mixed the other ingredients (I used powdered sugar and added some extra-to taste). Then I gently folded in the whipped cream-turned out perfectly (I also didn't let the cream cheese sit out very long before using)! Rave reviews from family!

All I can say is WOW!  Made a cherry chip boxed cake for my daughter's birthday and realized that I had no frosting.  Found this recipe and had all the ingredients (lucky me!).  This was excellent considering it was a last minute throw together.  All our guests raved!  I think I want to make fruit tarts with this as the topping...endless possibilities.

The flavor is wonderful but I had to add 2 cups of confectionary sugar to make it work as a frosting. It's just too thin a consistancy.

Wonderful frosting, just the way it is.  I am typically not a big fan of whipped cream frosting, and I don't know exactly how it's made, but this had a nice rich texture and flavor, I think because of the cream cheese.   We had it on a plain white cake and loved it.  However, my cake looked nothing like the one in the picture.  I wish the artistic ability automatically came with making the frosting : )

This is just sooo yummy. It's nice and light textured and not too sweet. I, too, used confectioner's sugar. This would go great on just about any cake, spooned over ice cream, or even just out of the bowl!!!! I, as someone else did, used it on a cassata cake from this site. Thank you, Tom!!!

FABULOUS!!! I used icing sugar instead of white sugar -as someone else suggested, and also only used 1 cup of whipped cream.  I then chilled it in the fridge for 20 minutes before frosting the cake and it was very very easy to work with and delicious!

All the raving reviews were RIGHT on the money!
I actually whipped this up at my office - very easy and everyone fought over licking the bowl, beaters, spatula, etc. ... Highly recommended, can't wait to use it again. Thanks!!!
