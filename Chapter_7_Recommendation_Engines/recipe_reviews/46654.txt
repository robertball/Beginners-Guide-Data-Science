Fabulous recipe for "Taco Seasoning"! This is much better than the packaged stuff and what's really great is it's "salt free"! This recipe is perfect as is, but I love to play with stuff so I used half regular paprika and half smoked paprika, upped the cayenne a bit and added some ancho chili powder. Wow! This is a definite keeper and I found it to be even better than "Taco Seasoning I" from this site. This is perfect to store in a mini tupperware container along with my other spice mixes to have on hand. Great for tacos, seasoning chicken, throwing into chili or nachos, or anything else you can think of adding it into that might need a bit of spice!

Did a good job.  A bit bland, you may want to add more cayenne or just make sure to serve with hot sauce in certain dishes.  Do add salt if you like salt, but this way you can make the decision yourself.  Thickened just fine, in fact maybe a bit faster than the packaged stuff.  Used 1lb ground beef and simmered for 15 mins with 1 cup water, 7 tsp this mix to make tacoes for 4 people.

This is a wonderful recipe for taco seasoning. It is absolutely delicious. So much tastier than the packaged mixes at the store, plus there is no salt or artificial ingredients. All the needed items for making this mix you'll find in your kitchen cabinets. We are big fans of Mexican food and spicy dishes. This is a versatile mix that can be used in many different ways. I haved used this to make tacos, casseroles, dips, and it has always been a big hit!

I tried this tonight, since I was out of the packaged stuff. I'm always looking for cheaper, tastier, healthier alternatives to pre-packaged items...and this one fit the bill. I added salt & white pepper, a pinch of sugar, and omitted the cayenne altogether(too spicy for my kids). I make my taco meat with ground turkey, and the seasoning was just perfect. I thought it was way better than the little packets...which I won't be buying again!

Great! I was making a casserole that required taco seasoning and I didn't have any on hand...and once again Allrecipes came to the rescue!! This is very very close to packaged taco seasoning. The only change I made was to add salt, and than it was perfect.  Remember though, this is only good if your spices are fresh and aromatic. Thanks Waco Kid for a helpful and economical recipe!

I decided to try this because my 11 year old complained that the seasoning that I usually use "taco seasoning" from this site, is too hot.  I was a little leary to try this because of the corn starch, but I was wrong!  I did add some salt to taste, but recieved rave reviews from all the kids, including a very picky 22 month old (who ate his whole taco...well the filling anyway).  Thanks Waco Kid!!

Didn't care for this.  I can appreciate wanting to lower salt but removing it all together doesn't work.  Also, the cumin doesn't stand out.  Mexican flavors usually have more of a cumin taste.  This recipe didn't work for me.

I hardly use store mixes because many include MSG (bad for kidneys) and other chemicals, etc.  While others may prefer the taste of the store packaged mix, it maybe because of the MSG.  I found that this really captured the taste of the typical taco seasoning packet without the mystery ingredients.  Thanks for sharing it!!!

Thanks for letting all of us Low Sodium people enjoy our Mexican food again. While most do not have to watch their sodium intake, there are many of us out here that do. It is easier to add salt then to take it away. So thank you again. Keep up the great recipes.

I have tried using those taco mixes in the stores, but this is the absolute BEST. My husband I do not like spicy food and this is not too spicy at all.  Great recipe that I have recommended to my friends who enjoy it also.  I will never use that store bought stuff again.

This was good. I doubled the recipe and had to had 1 tsp of salt to it. My kids seemed to like it compared to taco seasoning I from AR which they say is too spicy.

This is great to have on hand...I use it in tacos, but also lots of other main dishes, dips, even in scrambled eggs. I double the recipe and put it in a small canning jar, then just screw on th lid and shake to blend it. I've started rounding off the measurements when I double it and that works well... makes it very easy to whip up. My measurements are: 4 T. chili powder, 3 T. paprika, 3 T. ground cumin, 2 T. onion powder, 2 T. garlic powder, 1 T. cornstarch, 1/4 t. cayenne, or to taste. Also, if you're watching your sodium intake like we are, look for a chili powder where salt is NOT one of the first three ingredients... then you know you're getting a good one. I found that the chili powder in the Mexican food aisle is cheaper and salt was the last ingredient vs. a nationally known brand where salt was the 3rd ingredient!! Thanks so much for this recipe!

I loved this! My husband is on a low sodium diet so I am always on a mission to find substitutes for high sodium items that 1) actually tastes like the original and 2) is not bland. This is a winner! I made as written with both ground turkey and ground chicken. This, with the 0 sodium taco shells from Whole Market, and I was able to have a tasty meal. You've saved me from bland and I wouldn't be embarrassed to serve this to guests! We thank you.

Love it, thought it needed just a touch of salt though. So I added 1 1/2 tsp of salt, I also add 2 tsp of Oregano. Why buy it from the store when all the ingredients are in the pantry?

It is always nice to find substitution recipes!  Even if you add salt later, the nutrition value of this recipe is better than that of packaged Taco seasoning. Just read the packaged  ingredients and nutritional values.

I used this in "taco rice" recipe from this site. Although this taco seasoning wasn't a huge hit in that recipe, it is a pretty good taco seasoning overall and I would use this again when sauting chicken or beef.  It's really mild (which pleased my family) but good. I too added 1/2 tsp of salt, which helped this out alot. I don't think it tastes quite the same as the store-bought stuff, but then again, I don't think the store bought stuff is top notch either. Liked the "uniqueness" of this recipe...thanks Waco Kid!

I ran out of my usual taco seasoning from this site, and since my market was having a half price sale on all spices and herbs, I decided to give this recipe a try. Glad I did! This is great and tastes just like my favorite store bought brand. The big plus is its healthier and more inexpensive than store bought. Thanks WACO KID!

I use this taco seasoning all the time now instead of the packets.  I love that it has plenty of flavor and no salt.  The packets of taco seasoning are loaded with salt and all kinds of preservatives and artificial ingredients.

This is a really great base taco seasoning, but it isn't quite the same as the seasoning packets you can buy at the store. I found that when you add the water and mix in the seasoning, it doesn't thicken the way store bought packets do. And the flavor isn't quite as strong. Ive found that adding a little extra corn starch, chili powder, and cayenne pepper after using this base seasoning helps to kick up and thicken things.

This was bland. I needed to add so much more of the spices and, sorry to say, some salt, to the browned meat to make it spicy enough for tacos.

I was pleasantly surprised with the taste of this recipe.  I always think the packages from the store are WAY too salty (even when I'm not pregnant, like I am right now) so I was glad to see this recipe didn't even call for salt.  My husband is a taco fanatic, would eat them all the time if he could and he really liked the seasoning.  I thought it could have used a tiny bit of salt (go figure!) but he said he wouldn't even bother.  I will definitely be using this again and again!  Thanks for such a great recipe!!! :)

I accidentally reviewed the wrong recipe.  This is the taco seasoning that I tried one evening when I realized I didn't have any pre-packaged envelopes.  I'll never buy that stuff again.  Just keep this in your spice cupboard and use as needed.  I labeled the jar with the actual recipe so I can just quickly refill it when I run out.  Thanks!

I was not impressed by this at all, I think it was very bland compared to the store brands.  I definitely agree w/ other reviewers, salt and pepper are needed in addition to what the recipe already calls for.  I really wouldn't recommend anyone use this recipe unless they like bland taco's.

I made this for the Bean N Beef Crescent Pie I made tonight for dinner.  Worked perfectly, and it's tasty.  I ran out of onion powder, though, so I subbed minced onion flakes for the rest.  thanks for the recipe!

This is a good base recipe. I added more cayenne and 1 tablespoon of Lawry's seasoned salt to suit our palate. It is much cheaper to make than buying the packets.

I made this one night when I wanted tacos but didn't have any packaged seasoning on hand.  I DID, however, have everything needed for this recipe!  I thought it was great and will probably never buy the packaged stuff again.  I did find it needed salt, though, but just added it to taste when the meat was done.

My husband and I found this recipe quite bland. I browned the beef, then added the 7 teaspoons of the seasoning and added about a half cup of water, and let it simmer for about 30 minutes so the flavors could mingle.  I liked that it had no salt, but I would like a recipe with more flavor.  It very minimally seasoned the beef.

This was a great alternative the package stuff! I have to watch a very low sodium diet and can once again enjoy tacos! I added about 1 tsp more cumin and used half onion powder and half dried onions, I did the same thing with the garlic. To those of you who said it was bland or needed salt I suggest playing with the recipe to suit your tastes. This is a keeper in my recipe box.

I liked the idea, and the basics are there, but as prepared I think this is pretty bland. I added crushed black pepper, 1/2 tsp. dried oregano, and sea salt to taste, after I tasted it. After those changes, it's much better. Overall, it is a good start!

Good to have on hand instead of always buying the packets, although I added salt to taste (and more cayenne for spice, and more cumin). Hubby liked it, said it was the best tasting tacos to date. I like the made-from-scratch feel of using my own taco seasoning mix. Glad I found this recipe.

This gets 3 stars for no salt, but it's not nearly as good as the worst of the store packets. It is seriously lacking in flavor and would need a lot more chili powder and other spices to make it worth eating. I'll keep looking.

This is really good I added in extra garlic & onion and cayenne pepper and extra cornstarch & water to give it some broth as the packaged mixes do(the kids like the packaged taco seasoning) . The kids didnt know the difference. I had tried some others they didnt like so this is our new taco seasoning

This was really good. I made 2 batches and used it in my Mexican Penne Casserole.  It smelled wonderful but I ended up adding 2 tsps more of the cayenne, and that hit the spot.....I will be keeping this recipe on hand now since it's a whole lot cheaper then buying the spices already mixed. Thanks.

Yum!  I doubled or tripled the cayenne (or so...I really just dumped a bunch in the mix as I like stuff hot), added about 2 tsp of oregano, and left out the cornstarch since I didn't have any.  Used it to spice up my vegetarian burritos.  Best tastin' burritos I've made yet!

Needs a bit of salt, but otherwise a great replacement for those store bought packages!  I make a double or triple batch and keep it in the spice cabinet so its always ready.

Good tacos. Not spicy, mild flavor, but not bland either. I cut this down to a third since I did't know if we would like it and now I wish I had made the entire batch as it turned out to be quite acceptable after all. I did add a good pinch of kosher salt as the dish was nearly finished simmering. Thanks, this is a lot cheaper than those package mixes too!

This is an excellent recipe. I saute chicken strips in a little oil and then put the seasoning in. It makes yummy chicken nachos. I serve it with mexican rice II from this site. Perfect for a quick meal or for parties.

I used this often!  Mix up a double batch and keep it on hand so it is handy whenever you need it.  This recipe best matches the store bought seasoning, and isn't too spicy as other recipes I've found.  If you want to turn it up a notch, add more cayanne or chili powder.

i was in a complete fix.  i was making a dish that utilizes taco meat and i couldn't find seasoning.  so i dug into allrecipes and decided to go with this.  i had to make a couple of quick substitutions...garlic salt and onion flakes...but boy, i was happy with the results as was my trusty fiance!  plus i halved the recipe and all measurements were perfection!  thank you so much:)

I normally use packaged taco seasoning, but ran out at the last minute.  So, I tried this instead, because I had everything on hand.  It was really good.  I will use this again instead of buying the packages.

This was excellent.  I was looking for a replacement for the packaged stuff.  As per other reviews I reduced the paprika to 3 tsp and doubled the cayenne.  This is a keeper for sure.

This was ok.  The paprika was really overwhelming.  I would cut down on that and probably also add some black pepper if I make it again.

Hands down the best taco seasoning! I've made this several times and it's so much better than the packaged mixes in the store, and cheaper! I always triple the recipe to have it on hand. Sometimes we just sprinkle it on chicken breasts before we grill them for a quick taco alternative to ground beef. I've also sprinkled it into sweet potatoes and butternut squash cubes before baking them for a veggie taco. Very versatile and it helps use those spices you have in your cupboard!

This is my go to for taco seasoning! Very flavorful and thickens quickly. I did add about 1/2 tea. of salt per recipe, and I cut the cayenne pepper in half for the kids. I also quadruple the recipe and put it in a 16oz peanut butter jar to store it.

This is perfect! I use smoked paprika instead of regular paprika. It takes the seasoning over the top. I will never buy a package again. They can't compare.

Ok, but not enough kick to it.  The kids, who usually like stuff on the milder side, even said it was bland. We had to add extra garlic powder, black pepper, salt and quite a bit more cayenne to give it some kick.

Thank you for this recipe! I have always tried to find ways to cut out or drastically reduce the sodium in everything I eat. Although the rest of my family wants the salt....well they can add it to their plates instead :) This is a great alternative to the store bought one and love it so much better! ESPECIALLY the fact that it has virtually no sodium!

Even though my husband and I like the Restaurant-Style Taco Meat Seasoning recipe from this site more, our kids loved this recipe more, so it's here to stay!  We did add Himilayan Salt and used Chipotle Pepper (double) instead of cayenne, because we didn't have cayenne pepper on hand.  I'll admit, it is slighly bland for adult tastes, but if you have kids, give this a try, they may like it more because of that.  :)

I found this seasoning very bland. I made some alterations to this basic recipe and have made it how my family likes it, but it is not anywhere close to the initial recipe. But bear in mind my family and myself do like most food seasoned very strongly whwn using meats like ground beef. So, others may like this recipe even if we didn't.

As attested to by the 2 teenaged boys who left only enough for a single taco each for myself and daughter, this is tops in taco seasoning!!  I agree!  I may have overdone it slightly - used the entire recipe for a couple pounds of ground turkey.  Didn't have cayenne pepper, so used about a teaspoon of chipotle, which is a bit milder, but it went over well, anyway.

After mixing the seasonings, this smelled so good, I had to make tacos as soon as possible.  I used 1 pound 93/7 ground beef (drained) and 7 tsps of the seasoning.  The beef didn't seem seasoned or zesty at all.  I guess I will use more next time.  It is appreciated that it is salt free, I didn't add any salt to the beef at any point.

This is an excellent idea, tastes wonderful and is easily customizable to individuals and their families tastes. Great job as well for helping people stretch a buck and save on sodium. I have made this 2 times now, and have passed this recipe along to my sister and uncle. (They asked since i wouldn't stop raving about it, lol)

Great basic recipe!  We like it spicy so I added red pepper flakes, more garlic and a little salt.  Much better (and cheaper) than store bought!

My family loves this and I love that it isn't full of salt, MSG or ingredients I don't understand.  I usually use onion salt for a little salt flavor or I add some kosher salt to the mix.  The kids swear it tastes like the packets.

Of all the taco seasonings Ive used, this is the best!  The 7 teaspoons for a pound of ground meat is perfect.  A favorite for our family.

Pretty good but I did find it a little bland, so I added a dash of my own Cajun seasoning blend to each taco. What was great about this recipe is that the sodium content was minimal as there was no actual salt present!

This was a lot better than the package product you can buy. Because most of my family goes for the mild foods I scaled this recipe down to just 5 servings for 1 lb. of ground beef. I decided less was best until we had atleast tried it once and I didn't want a lot left over. I browned my ground beef and then drained it. Then I added the seasoning to the meat along with 1/2 cup of water (based on what you do with the packages you get at the store). This will be replacing the store bought packages from now on. The entire family liked it, even my husband who always says stuff is bland for him. Thanks for the recipe. A keeper all the way.

I made enough to store in my cabinets and it was good. I would do it again but this time add a bit of salt to the rest that I have stored.

Well...I'm far from a spice gourmet, buying spices from the supermarket shelf for the most part, but I didn't care for this at all.  Chili powder already has cumin and garlic.  Paprika is sweet red pepper pods, ground.  I wondered if the recipe accounted for that, but based on the reviews, I suppose it did.  I could not put my finger on what was missing, or what was too heavy, but I THINK:  less cumin; more 'spice' or 'heat', however that might be obtained.  I also like to use dehydrated onions instead of onion powder.  I think this is totally a personal preference, so I'm sure many more will enjoy this recipe.  Don't hesitate to try it; just not for me.

this was really good....the ony thing is I would double or tripple the batch to make to have on hand for a good while. the only thing is you might have to go buy more spices cuz it uses them all up! but its worth it, I can't believe the unhealthy things they put in the packets you buy at the store...MSG being one of the main ones...and hydrogenated oils too...why would they need to put all that?? So much better for your family this way with no cancer risks!

Great Recipe for restricted sodium diets! Others might want to add 1/2 tsp of salt or so. Very similar to store brands, including thickening properties. Not too spicy, but not bland either.

Made alot of seasoning. It smelled great but was very bland. I even added more of certain ingredients both time I used it and it was still bland. I am willing to try it again in a snaller making to see if I maybe made a mistake, I will repost with a better rating and an apology to the submitter.

This was perfect! Just what I was looking for. Strangely, even as a lover of salt, I did not miss it. Once I put hot sauce and the other fixings on my taco, it tasted just like it should. I will definitely be making this again. I may try it though in the future, with a touch of salt and more cayenne. Even my kids loved it. Thanks!

This is a great substitute for the pre-packaged taco seasoning mix.  I'll never buy one again, since I can stir this up in a flash with ingredients I already have on hand... and it tastes exactly the same!

I like this mixture for tacos better than any of the store packets.  The mildness, which is easily adjusted with the amount of cayenne pepper, is great for my daughter who loves tacos but is not old enough to have anything very spicy.

This was the most bland, bland could get. However being one who likes to experiment I added some things. I added a full 1/2 teaspoon of ceyanne pepper instead of just the 1/8th. I also added 1tsp garlic salt and a few shakes of tabasco sauce. It was a HUGE hit after that.

Maybe I overdid the water I added when I cooked my meat, but this really didn't have much flavor to it.  It smells better than the packet, but I prefer the taste of the packet.  I still have some left, and will try using it again, but adding less water.

Adding the extra salt and pepper was a good touch.  It came out very well, not too spicy.

I found this to be a great starter recipe, that you can twick to your own taste. Also, I found that the recommended 7tsp to one envelope was a bit heavy.  Next time I will start around 4tsp and add more if needed.

Excellent recipe!  I doubled the cayenne as suggested in other reviews.  Used 6 tsp (2 TB) on a pound of ground chicken - it was delicious!

I made this a couple months ago and have used it a lot. It is very good and will definitely keep a large batch made up from now on. No more store bought here. Made it as submitted.

This tasted fine, but I had to add some salt to the mix after tasting it in the ground beef I made for tacos. I think it would be fine to use to sprinkle on different things for some seasoning, but for us, salt is needed for taco meat.

If you're looking for something similar to the taste of McCormick but homemade AND gluten free this is for you. 
I've used this recipe for years but I'm just now getting around to rating it.

This was a very good medium heat taco seasoning I used salt free chili powder and made with ground turkey Fantastic.
Nice you can always turn up the heat.

It is really delicious but you have to add a LOT to get any flavour when adding to meat.  Honestly, the value just isn't there.  I'm much better off just buying a package of taco seasoning at the store.  I will have to keep looking.  The favour was great so I gave it 4 stars it just isn't worth the effort, in my opinion.

My husband is now on a strict low sodium diet, so I am on the hunt for flavorful alternatives, and this worked perfectly.  I browned a pound of lean ground beef and added 3/4 c. of water with the 7 tsps. of seasoning mix.  We used it to make taco salads without the tortillas, which worked just fine with chopped lettuce, avocados, tomatoes and green onions.  A small sprinkle of shredded cheese and low sodium blue cheese yogurt dressing made for a very tasty meal!

Love being able to control the amount of seasoning (and salt) in my tacos!  I add a few dashes of chipotle chile pepper in to add a bit more heat and smokiness. So good!

I've used this salt free blend over and over!

Because I usually use it in specific recipe which requires no thickening, I don't add the cornstarch.  I often add oregano to the mix (4-6 tsp).

I just whipped up a batch of this and it's great!! I usually just season my protein by opening all these bottles of spices, I never thought to combine then together ahead of time lol I'll be testing this tomorrow night when I make my Mexican lasagna. Thanks for a great spice mix!!

I love this taco seasoning....especially because I can add the amount of salt I like...the store bought types are always too salty.I did make one change to the recipe...for the paprika...I used 2 teaspoons of the regular kind, and then I used 1 teaspoon each of bitter-sweet smoked paprika, hot smoked paprika & regular smoked paprika!I double the batch whenever I make this & store it in a mason jar.

I just made this based on the ingredient list.  I made it exactly as the recipe indicated.  

The seasonings work well together.  The reason I gave it 3-stars is it is BLAND!!!  

I am still going to use this as my new taco seasoning recipe, however, I will either pre-season the meat with a little salt as I cook it.  I typically season by site and rarely use mixes.

I also added 2 tsp of salt to the remaining mixture.  I may have to adjust it down the road when I use it again as I haven't tested it yet with the salt addition.  

It really is a good recipe, but it does need salt!  Adding some will still be substantially less than what would be in a store-bought packet.

Very good, after a few modifications.  Per previous suggestions, I cut back paprika to 3 1/2 tsp, upped the cayenne to 1/2 tsp, added 2 tsp of garlic salt, and 1 tsp of sea salt.  Yummy!

This was very good.  My 10 year old sister gives it 5/5 stars, and I gave it 3 3/4 stars.  I added some salt (okay, quite a bit) and sugar. We ate it with beef, tomatoes, lettuce and cheese on hard taco shells.  easy and delicious.

I adapted this recipe quite a bit . . . missed out the ground cumin and used fresh onion and galic instead of powder. So I'm not sure how much my review counts for since it was basically a different recipe! But we had it with VegE mince and it was a fair approximation of the packet sauce. Enjoyed by my family, but a bit average. 3-4 stars.

Great mix! I added 2 Tbl. salt and used twice the amount. It was great. Thank you.
