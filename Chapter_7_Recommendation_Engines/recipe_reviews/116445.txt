The water chestnuts were a nice touch, but the dressing had too strong of a BBQ sauce flavor. If you make this, you may want to use a different dressing or start off with a small amount of BBQ sauce, taste, and go from there. you can always add more BBQ sauce if you think it needs it.

What a great salad! We really loved the barbecue dressing. I made as written other than adding some different coloured peppers. This would go great in the summertime with bbq'd hamburgers or steak.

YUM YUM YUM. I loved it!  I was out of worccestershire sauce so I had to omit it but the flavor was awesome even w/o it. I could have had this for dinner all by itself. It was soooo good!

This dressing is amazing! I love hot spinach salad dressing, but most of them are made with bacon grease. I made this one with olive oil like the recipe called for, cut the bar-b-que back to 2 T because I didn't want it to taste like bar-b-que sauce, and warmed it before pouring over the salad. My husband said it was the best dressing he has ever had and he loves his dressings in large amounts! Imagine how happy we are that this is made with olive oil and that is great warm!

I thoroughly enjoyed this salad.  I did substitute the water chestnuts for a jicama and it turned out just fine.

The salad dressing was quite tasty!

If you like a little extra sweetness to your salad, try adding in a small pear.

This salad was AMAZING!  I did add sliced Vadalia onions and almond slivers which I highly recommend.  I will be making this over and over!  Yum.

A friend brought this recipe over to our house for a gathering and it was great!  It is a very heart salad and has a wonderful zippy dressing (and I don't care for water chestnuts but loved them in this recipe).  I would highly recommend it.

I'd say there's more then a hint of BBQ sauce - this recipe basically is BBQ sauce. However, it somehow works! We had it with steak. We're not sure why, but we feel compelled to make it again! Oh and not fans of water chestnuts or jicima, we left that out.

Awesome salad and dressing. I change the dressing like this though: add lemon juice, less oil, more vinegar -balsamic and red wine in place of cider-, less sugar. And I don't bother with chesnuts in salad, but do add grated cheddar cheese. Sooo good. I keep the dressing in a bottle (minus the lemon juice) in the cupboard for whenever I want to use it on a salad.

Really good change from the usual spinach with bacon dressing. IMHO, too much stuff for the amount of spinach.  Next time I'll use about 1/2 again as much spinach (9 oz.)
