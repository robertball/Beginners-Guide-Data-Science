Finally got around to rating this again having made the recipe as is. These are just awesome in every way. The patties are very generously sized and very filling. This recipe is in our permanent five star file. :-)

Oh, bubba! These were so yummy!The only thing i changed was a rib of celery in place of the jalapeno....but man-oh-man were these good. Just one thing though..... 4 patties? I made 6 ENORMOUS patties (2-3 times the size of normal crab cakes) thanks for sharing them :-)

Not sure who the Chef Bubba is that submitted this recipe, but the recipe in Ladies Home Journal, June 2007, for Uncle Bubba's Crab Cakes shared by Earl "Bubba" Heirs, co-owner and chef of Uncle Bubba's Oyster House sounds much better.  I say that only because they are fried in oil and butter.  I think this recipe would be much better if fried in a pan instead of baked.  Healthier baked, but they were to dry for me.  As another reviewer said, 450 maybe is to hot.

sorry, but i didn't make this exactly as written; i omitted things i didn't think i'd care for.  none the less...these cakes were FANTASTIC!  i omitted:  basil, thyme, chives and jalapeno; substituted panko for bread crumbs and for the parmesan cheese - i used the stuff in the green cannister...  i thought about adding some garlic salt but i'm glad i trusted my instincts - the cheese made it salty enough. early in the day i cooked up the shrimp, red peppers and salmon - so quick!  cooled them down in fridge in a gallon sized freezer bag.  later in the day i didn't have time to soften cream cheese so i used a rubber spatula and creamed it together w/egg; added panko and parmesan cheese.  broke up salmon right in closed plastic storage bag and then folded it into the cream cheese egg mixture.  i had a girls' night out last night so i told my husband to just ice cream scoop onto baking pan, pat down  and bake at 400 for 20-30 minutes.  he made a mixture of sweet chili sauce & mayo to serve w/the cakes...mmmmm delish!  i had the leftovers for lunch today.  the whole family agrees....FIVE STARS!  thank you for sharing, bubba!!!

Phenomenal, I will make it a regular meal at my house!  I once had some Crab Jalapeno Bites at Phillips Seafood that were phenomenal and I've thought of them ever since - these were just like them!
I followed the recipe exactly (even measured) but didn't have whole wheat bread crumbs or chives so I used italian crumbs and red onion.  I baked at 400 for 30-35 min based on other reviews which seemed perfect.  Next time I would chop the shrimp to marble-size chunks (bigger than I did) to add variety to the texture.
I like making this with leftover salmon and frozen cocktail/salad shrimp as a shortcut.  A nice chopper (like Pampered Chef) also makes this very quick and easy.

I am constantly trying to come up with new seafood recipes for my boyfriend and i to enjoy (he can only eat halal meat, which is hard to get where I live, so the easiest is to cook seafood). When i served these to him last weekend, he told me that he was never eating seafood outside my house at a restaurant again! My family and i loved them also. I did make a few changes though... Used tinned red salmon (i know! fresh is better but salmon in Australia at the moment is more that $30 per kilo), i didnt use red bell papper because i dont like the taste( used red onion instead and i used jarred jalepeno(cant get fresh here). They were still amazing! Also served with Tartare Sauce I from this site... also amazing! Thanks Bubba

These were really good! I didn't have shrimp, so I just used precooked salmon. I also didn't have bread crumbs, so I just added crushed Ritz crackers. We ate leftover as sandwiches (placed cake between a few pieces of bread).

FIVE Star Plus ! Fantastic gourmet Recipe. A little work, but well worth the effort. I followed directions but used plain breadcrumbs. Served it to dinner guests and all raved about it. Thanks Bubba. Got any more recipes to share ?

A delightful taste cacophony.  I used 1/4 2 percent milk and 1 Tablespoon pasteurise process spread instead of cream cheese, and coated the patties with barley flour

This was sooooo amazing! I didn't have the thyme or basil or chives, but did have fresh celantro, oregano and a dash of Italian seasoning and it was fabulous.  It made more then 4 large cakes, but maybe because I didn't measure the shrimp or salmon... Put the left overs in the fridge and the next morning rolled it in cresent dough and put it in the oven... devine!

I used frozen, cooked shrimp and a can of red Sockeye salmon for this and it turned out great.  Didn't fancy the jalapeno pepper so used celery as suggested by previous reviewers.  The only improvement I would make - and the reason I didn't give it 5 stars - is that I feel it would benefit from the addition of a good dash of lemon juice.  Added this at the table and it was much better.  Also, served it with fat-free sour cream which added just that little touch of extra moistness.  With the can of salmon and 7 oz of shrimp, I got 7 cakes from this recipe.

These cakes turned out very dry and had little flavor, even though I followed the recipe to a T. Will probably not try again, although if I do, I will be sure to also prepare a sauce to present with them.

These are fantastic! They also make a great appetizer! I used a mini muffin pan greased with a light spritz of cooking spray and a cookie scoop for more consistent results and baked them at 400 degree for 8 minutes. Let cool a little before removing from the pan or else they might fall apart. They're adorable and even kids love them!

This is my go to recipe for dining at home to impress. The only thing I modify is that I substitute the salmon and shrip for got old fashioned crab. However, the recipe is perfect as is. If using crab a word of caution on the spices, I once added too much thyme and it threw everything off, so mind your thyme. My finacee loves spicy dishes so I do add a bit more jalapeno which doesn't overwhelm the dish. THis is a great recipe and prep time aside, it's a quick once all your ingredients are chopped and ready. Thanks Bubbs!

I've been meaning to make this for over a year.  Had I known it would be so awesome, I'd have made it much sooner.  The entire family loved, loved, loved.  I did pan fry instead of baking and added a sprinkling of panko for a crunch.  I also chopped the shrimp instead of mincing.  I make four 3/4 inch burgers, served on a toasted onion bun with homemade tarter sauce.

Great seafood option! Shrimp and salmon are about the only two seafood items my husband will eat, so I was really happy to find this recipe. I did find it was lacking a bit of flavor after baking, so I sprinkled with salt and Old Bay. Next time, I will add 1 teaspoon of each to the recipe when mixing and will probably add a dollop of lemon juice as well. Used Panko instead of whole wheat bread crumbs and omitted the jalapeno because we don't care for it. I ended up with 9 medium size cakes, baked at 400 for 25 minutes. Perfection. Thanks so much for posting this recipe.

These were delicious! I modified slightly (didn't have chives or jalepeno). I sauteed chopped white onion, celery, and minced garlic with the red pepper. I used combination of panko bread crumbs and coursely crushed dry stuffing mix bread cubes. I replaced some of the cream cheese with mascarpone cheese. Also added cilantro. I only cooked at 400 degrees for about 20 min. Upon taking out of oven, I drizzled a little melted butter and squeezed a fresh lemon on the tops of patties. This recipe made 7 large patties- large enough for a bun, which I served it on with Dijon mustard, mayo, and tomato. It was absolutely fabulous! Awsome recipe! I am saving it and will make again for family/friends.

What an intriguing and delicious way to present salmon!   We loved these.   I used a can of tiny shrimp (rinsed) instead of mincing larger shrimp and seasoned breadcrumb because that's what I had.   Otherwise, I stuck to the recipe.     I really appreciate that the cakes are baked and not fried.   Thanks, Bubba!

These were awesome, and I don't normally even like fish cakes or salmon. I chopped everything small, but not tiny, which gave it a nice texture. Also didn't have any red bell pepper so left that out. Used green onion instead of chives. I drizzled a garlic butter over them--sooo good!  Next time I might not seed the jalapeno--I wouldn't mind a little bite to them.

Husband rates these a 4, I rate them a 2. I personally thought there was way too much red bell pepper, and I didn't care for the jalapeno at all. I could also barely taste the shrimp. Meh, I don't know, I would make them again if requested, but I didn't really enjoy them. Thanks anyway!

I didn't have bell pepper, so I sauted shrimp with minced garlic and scallions. Very good! As a side dish to lay cakes on top; I sauted 1/2 c. onion, 1 clove garlic in olive oil and added(5 slices pre-cooked cut bacon). When tender,  added large pkg fresh spinich for just a couple minutes...stir and serve...kids love it!

Maybe  I did something wrong, but I really didn't like these.  I couldn't decide if I didn't like them because I don't like fish cakes, or because they tasted bad.  450 was way too hot.  The bottom's burned and the middle was undercooked.  I like the taste of the shrimp, but I think there was too much bread crumbs, as that was all that I could taste.  I sprinkled on lemon juice at ate the tops, but I won't be making these again.  Sorry to mess up a flawless recipe rating.  Clearly I am in the minority, so don't let my opinion from stopping you from trying this recipe!

I realized I only had half enough cream cheese at the last minute. It didn't matter. They were still awesome! The second time I made them, I added some chopped up water chestnuts I had on hand. They added a nice crunch. This recipe takes a little more prep than I usually have time for, but well worth it!

AMAZING! This made 6 large patties for me. I did make a couple of substitutions: I used left over salmon from grilling the night before, green onions (scallions) instead of chives and Italian breadcrumbs instead of whole wheat. But the result was every bit as good as all the reviews I read here. My hubby thanks you Chef Bubba!

Absolutely fantastic!  Very similar to my favorite restaurant crab cakes - I'll likely be trying this recipe with crab and shrimp next time.  This is the second time I made it, and both my husband and I agree that it rivals any seafood patties I've ever made.  I made with canned wild salmon (boneless and skinless) and have made it with both fresh and canned shrimp.  I use italian breadcrumbs instead of whole wheat, and I only make a half batch (makes about 8 patties, about 2 per serving)   Well worth the bit of effort!

Pretty darn nice.. I too added the celery but will try jalepenos for a bit of extra bite next time. I managed to make 6 decent 1/4 pounders! Using very low fat cream cheese and cutting down on the parmesan makes this the mainstay of a pretty healthy meal..Well done Bubba!

I have made these many times over the years and it’s always delicious.  As some reviewers stated it makes very generous  sized cakes.   I have cooked them in the oven and fried them on the stove with great results either way

These were wonderful!! The only change I made was using Italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of plain. I'll make these again soon.

Fried salmon patties have been a favorite with our family but our old recipe will be replaced with this fantastic dish! followed the recipe exact and they turned out GREAT! Everyone loved them. Froze the leftovers and they were just as good a week later! Just the right spice and baked is so much better for you than fried.

These were very yummy. My husband loved them. I thought something was missing though so next time I would add a little salt and chopped red onions. I used italian bread crumbs also. I will definately make this again. Thanks for sharing.

These went over pretty well in our family.. although i was having a lil trouble trying to get the cakes to stay together, also i didnt use any cream cheese only because we made ours into burgers and added provolone just as i was going to get ready to take them off the grill pan...  they turned out very good !!!

I absolutely loved this!  But, I did make a few changes.  I left out the bread crumbs and egg, and replaced the cream cheese with sour cream.  I made this into a flavorful shrimp sauce which I poured over the grilled salmon fillets.  So, so yummy!
