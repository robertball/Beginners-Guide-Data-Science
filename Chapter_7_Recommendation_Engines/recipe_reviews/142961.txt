Decrease salt to a pinch, 1/8 tsp, and a little less vinegar! It makes all the difference in the world, and you have a sweet pear puree to drizzle over your greens and fruit! Perfect!

I did not care for this recipe.  Making the nuts the way it says, when the sugar hardens, the pan and utinsels used are coated with an extremly hard sugar.  I did not care for the dressing.  I threw it out and made something different.

YUMMY!  This salad is light and refreshing.  My husband loved it, especially with the surgared walnuts on it.  It is sweet but oh so good.  Thanks

I like the overall concept of this salad, it makes me think of a salad you could find at any chain sandwich/bakery shop.  I am NOT too horribly crazy about the dressing flavour, I scaled the salt back to 1/4 tsp and the white wine vinegar to 2 Tbsp, and that wasn't the issue I had.  I didn't like the flavour the honey gave. I think that if I make the vinaigrette again that I'll use Lyles Golden syrup.  
Over all this is a nice refreshing change of pace!

I used cranberries instead of cherries, gorgonzola instead of feta, added small cubes of green apple for more people.  I also baked the walnuts for eight minutes in the oven first to roast, and cooked sugar mixure in pan mixed later, layed them on  wax paper
