Very tasty, but the amount of oil the recipe calls for is excessive in my opinion. I added part of the oil and discovered I didn't need the rest. I cooked the beans in salted water, but still felt the recipe needed salt at the end. Though I enjoyed this recipe served room temperature as suggested, my husband preferred his heated.

Very yummy recipe!  I tweaked it a bit.  I also decreased the amount of oil, I tossed the beans until they were coated well (my guess is I used about 1/4 cup).  I steamed the green beans just until they were bright green, were slightly cooked but still had a "snap."  Then I added 1 tablespoon of regular balsamic and 1 tablespoon of white balsamic, then seasoned salt (Tastefully Simple Brand) and fresh ground pepper.  I also threw in some gorgonzola that I had on hand.  I made this for a large group and several are demanding the recipe.  Thanks!

Loved This.. I made one small change using steamed green beans. Has great flavor and the crunch from the almonds was great!

I really enjoyed this, but my husband thought the vinegar in it was too strong... but we will review this recipe based on the person who has the best taste :). I sauteed my almonds in a little bit of butter and minced garlic, and a pinch of salt and pepper to give it a little more flavor. Definitely a keeper!

I didn't have fresh garlic on hand so I found myself struggling to add flavor to this recipe by trying a bit more vinegar, garlic salt, Mrs. Dash, parmesan cheese, and tomatoes sliced into eighths.  The result was not a waste, but not something I would do again.  It might've been ok with fresh garlic, but I really think this recipe leaves flavor lacking.

I made this tonight. It was REALLY good! I did do a few things different. My green beans were from my garden and frozen in the freezer so I put them in a pot of water and boiled them for about 10 minutes, just until tender then I drained them. I had almonds that I slivered and toasted in a pan...after toasting, I set them aside and using the same pan, I put in a TBSP or two of olive oil and then tossed in my green beans. I seasoned with salt and garlic pepper and tossed them a minute or two before adding in a couple splashes of basalmic vinegar (I only made enough green beans for two ppl).  Then I served the beans and sprinkled the almonds on top. I will definately be making these again.
