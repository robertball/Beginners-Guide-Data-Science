This Kugel is almost like my mother used to make. The only difference was she added raisins. I am diabetic so I used splenda instead of sugar and the splenda 1/2 & 1/2 brown sugar. I also used 1% milk instead of whole milk. It was a big winner. Thanks.

I made spelt egg noodles for this.  Instead of sugar, I used honey to sweeten this.  I omitted the topping, but sprinkle cinnamon all over the top once baked!  It was a delicious hit that we enjoyed both as a dessert and as a breakfast meal!  Thanks for the recipe!

Spectacular!!!  As the Jewish girl in my husband's Christian family, I made this kugel to add a Jewish touch to Christmas brunch at my mother-in-law's house.  Everyone loved it!  Tons of compliments on this dish, as one of the cousins said, "it's good to have a Jew in the family!"  Two people asked for the recipe.  FYI, I made it exactly as it is presented here.  I thought about adding raisins, and/or cornflake crumbs on top with the sugar and cinnamon, but decided to make it as-is for the first attempt at it.  I might try those changes next time.  In any case, my mother-in-law wants me to make this every year for Christmas brunch, and I'm sure I will find lots of other opportunities to make this recipe in the future.  Try it, everyone will love it!!!

Great flavor, just like my grandma used to make. Only thing I'd recommend is drop the milk from 2 cups to 1.5 cups. It's a little too wet. Cooked for 15 mins longer that recommended and was still too wet.

We were invited to a dear friend's house for Christmas dinner this year.  I made and brought this kugel as a side dish.  It was a HUGE hit!  So delicious.  I did change some things though.  I used a 16 oz bag of wide noodles.  Used the lower fat versions of milk, cottage cheese, sour cream and cream cheese.  Plus instead of sugar, I used Splenda.  No one could tell the difference.  I'll definitely be making this again.

This was a very easy and delicious recipe.  The only change I made was to add 1/2 c. of pineapple bits (drained and pressed of natural juices) and 1/2 c. of pecan bits. to the mix.  If I were to do anything differently in the future, it would be to double half again the sugars and cinnamon topping mix.   This is definitely better cold and the next day -- it turns out like a rich custard-y cake texture.   I imagine this recipe is extremely versatile and could be adapted to add/change other ingredients.  I might try 1/2 f.f. plain yogurt and 1/2 sour cream next time to reduce the fat.  I would not reduce the amount of sugar inside the kugel as it is just perfect.  Yummy!

I made this last night for Rosh Hashanah and it turned out great.  I also, like other reviewers, made a few changes, which are as follows
-  I reduced the amount of sugar in the noodle mixture to  about 3/4 cup to reduce the sweetness
- I reduced the milk to one cup and used lowfat milk vs. whole milk; to compensate (for creaminess) used an extra 1 tbs of butter and 2 tbs of sour cream.
- I added as a topping, corn flakes, to the white sugar, brown sugar and cinnamon.

I also added 1 cup of fruit cocktail to the mixture.

The result was DELISH.  The texture was PERFECT! Highly recommend this recipe.

My family loved it.

Way too sweet for my taste. I made this just as it is written. What I would change next time is the amount of sugar. It calls for a cup, but if you are also topping it with sugar, it’s overkill. I will use half the sugar, so 1/2 cup, and for the top, just 1/4 cup total of brown and white and generous cinnamon. It was also too wet. I might try 1 cup of milk instead of two. I do like a moist noodle pudding, but this was too wet imo.

I was a little worried about this recipe as my first attempt at a kugel because of a few reviews that stated it was just ok or that it would overflow in the oven. It also calls for so many forms of dairy, though I'm learning that that's basically what a kugel is with a little bit of noodles. But! This recipe was perfect! It didn't make too much, it didn't overflow in the oven and everyone loved it. They couldn't believe this non-Jewish girl could make such a good kugel her first time trying. It was most and decadent. No one else said, but I felt it a tad too sweet. Since I added plumped golden raisins I should have cut the sugar by 1/8 or so. Next time!

Delicious - I did change the 1 cup of sugar to 1/3 cup brown sugar & 1/3 cup white sugar.  Next time I might lower to 1/4 cup of each sugar.    My son says his new favorite food is this kugel.

This turned out great! My only concern after adding raisins and 3 large apple bits is that the juices did overflow my two  9x9" pans and drip into the oven. The taste was to die for, but I'll be sure to use bigger pans next time. 

More recently I've made a "banana foster" version with four bananas sliced width wise double the vanilla (I've been using Rodelle vanilla flavor ) and double the brown sugar. Oh god it's good. I gotta break out some vanilla ice cream...

This kugel is delicious! The 11 of us finished nearly the whole pan of it. I followed the suggested changes: I used a 16 oz package of noodles, 1 1/2 c of milk, 1/2 c of sugar in the noodle mixture, and 1/4 each of white and brown sugar in the topping. It was perfectly done in 55 minutes. I will definitely be making this recipe again!!!

I made this just as the recipe called for and it turned out excellent! It was picture-perfect, and so awesome, it could've won a contest.  Everyone at the Christmas party gave it rave reviews as well.

Everyone loved it. I made it exactly as the recipe says, except I made a mistake and added 1/4 cup of brown sugar to the noodles mixture. I will make that mistake again :-). Still did the brown sugar, cinnamon and sugar on top.

I’m a total kugel noob, and found this recipe both easy AND forgiving! In my struggle to find the cream cheese in my fridge, I didn’t read the amount properly and accidentally used 8oz instead of 4oz. I did add about half a cup of raisins and 3/4 cup of crushed walnuts on purpose, and used 2% milk because that’s what we had. It met with my Jewish husband’s approval. I’ll call that a win! I will definitely use this recipe in the future, hopefully using the correct amount of cream cheese ;) I’m sure it’s tasty on its own, but if you want to include fruit and/or nuts, it seems pretty amenable to add-ins.

I doubled the recipe and made two of these kugels and they came out fabulous.  Everyone loved them.  The only tweaking I did was to slightly reduce the amount of sugar.  By the way, this kugel is great cold, at room temp or warmed up if you have leftovers but unlikely you will have any!

Fantastic recipe. I use low fat milk, cottage cheese, cream cheese and sour cream. I also reduce the sugar inside to just a bit over 1/2 C and use no additional white sugar on top.  I also increased the cinnamon a bit.

I needed to use up some original-flavored soy milk, so I used a mixture of soy and whole milk. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. I enjoyed taking an unusual dish to my church's monthly potluck, and it was a gigantic hit! I will cut back on the sugar next time, though, in both the pudding mixture and the topping -- as written, it's sweeter than I care for.

Added raisins to this that I pre-soaked for 5 minutes in hot water to soften and plump. Was absolutely delicious! Took about 70 minutes to set up and then cooled int for half hour so I could slice it. Rave reviews from all, this will be my KUGEL GO TO !

Best kugel I’ve ever tasted. My husband who doesn’t like kugel ate the whole thing. Made exactly as directed. Perfection.

I followed this recipe exactly (scaled down by half to feed just my family). Turned out perfectly and the whole family loved it! A keeper for sure.

I made this kugel the other day for a potluck and it was a hit. The only modification I made was adding 1 cup of golden raisins. You can reduce milk to 1.5 cups or add a little more noodles. Otherwise, the recipe is perfect. I am am saving it and will make it again.

This was an okay recipe.  It actually made way more than recipe indicated so we had too much leftover and no one wanted it the next day.  I gave it two stars because, if we liked it, it would have been a great use for left over noodles.  Sorry, but we will not be making this again.

I made this to take to our temple's Hanukkah celebration. This is the first kugel I had ever made, and the rabbi said it was one of the best she had ever made. High praise indeed!
