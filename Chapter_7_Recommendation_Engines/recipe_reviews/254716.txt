This was good and tasted a LOT better than it looked. Used milk in place of the heavy creamed as mentioned but it still curdled to a degree. Great flavor though and one I'd make again. Leftovers get dry and the sauce gets greasy so I recommend only making what you will consume immediately.

I had to add 1 Tbsp of white vinegar to the yogurt/sour cream mixture since I didnâ€™t have buttermilk packets, but it came out amazing!  This tastes just like hot wing pizza topping.  I served it over egg noodles and everyone loved it.  Will keep this in my favorites!

Really good!  Too much spice for my little kids, but great for adult taste buds!  I omitted the heavy cream.

The only change I made was to cook the chicken breasts in a skillet till lightly browned and completely done, let cool, and then sliced and added back to the sauce. Be sure to make the sauce in the same pan you cooked the chicken in. We served it over cooked Farro and Quinuoa. We added this recipe  to our favorite recipes.

This was very good and I made it just the way the recipe states. I myself thought it was to much sour cream but that is just me. 
I fed 3 other people and they liked it just the way it is, also I put it over noodles. I will def make again but I may try putting diced celery in it for texture and maybe swap crumbly bleu for the parmasean cheese. Also, I would cut the chicken up into chunks like the beef is in beef stroganaff .
