these had great flavor. I live in town famous for its apples and they sell apple cider donuts. these tasted just like them. However, they soaked up a lot of the grease and they were a little dry in the middle but they did cook evenly and there were no doughy spots. They were a good way to use up herman starter but I will still keep looking for a donut recipe.

The texture of this doughnut is much crispier than the cake doughnuts I have made before. The sourdough and applesauce flavors are subtle. I was hoping for a richer flavor and was a little disappointed. Perhaps if my starter was aged longer this would change at least one aspect of this. I used homemade, slightly chunky applesauce, so I'm not sure how much more I could adjust that flavor. Because the sourdough flavor is unique to my current recipes I will likely do this again, but will try to adjust the flavors to suit my preference.

Good, not that flavourful though.
