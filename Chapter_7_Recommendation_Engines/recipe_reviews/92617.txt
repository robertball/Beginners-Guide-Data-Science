I really wanted to like this recipe.  I was craving Welsh Rarebit and didn't feel like dragging out Joy of Cooking and the double boiler.  I bought the famous red and white can of Cheddar Cheese Soup (I should know better, canned soup recipes never work for me) and made the recipe as written.  It didn't taste good.  I added more beer, more worchestershire sauce, still not good.  I put in more cayenne, some grated extra sharp cheddar and still no.  The cheese soup seemed to swallow everything I put in it and kill the flavors.  Finally, I put in some garlic powder and some dijon mustard and that made it taste not so bad (but not like Welsh Rarebit). I put some on toast with LOTS of grated extra sharp cheddar and broiled it until bubbly.  I ate it, but next time I'll stick with J of C and the double boiler.

As personal preference, we grated even more cheddar cheese over the top once the rarebit was on toast, and it turned out quite well! Our only problem with it was that it was just a little bit salty...otherwise no complaints, and we followed as is.

sorry, but this recipe tasted like i was dipping my bread in warm beer- it overpowered everything! It was probably my fault- we used Harp which is a pretty strong beer (its all we had around), so Im sure it would be better with a lighter beer...

Grew up with this recipe on Sunday evenings served on saltine crackers.  Not a TRUE welsh rarebit, but brought smiles and memories,.

I'd rather give this a 2.5 stars.  First of all, I had to make 16 servings, and followed the recalculated recipe.  As many reviewers said, the beer seemed to overpower the cheese (and I used Miller High Life, less than the recipe called for), but after I added the Worcestershire and pepper (I substituted Chipotle because I didn't have cayenne), the flavors blended much better.  My biggest disappointment with this recipe is that it was VERY soupy, literally, more like soup than Rarebit.  When poured over anything it immediately soaked in and spread all over the plate.

I followed the recipe exactly but really didn't care for this.  The taste of the beer overwhelmed everything else.  Next time I'll make fondue with real cheddar, which is much tastier.

I thought this tasted just fine. Maybe not authentic but it was super simple and worked great as a dipping sauce. You do have to like the taste of beer because it was dominant. I'm not big on can soup but it sure made this one come together quickly and I have no complaints.

It was thin and had a bad taste.
