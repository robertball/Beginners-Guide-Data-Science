These were liked alright by my family, but not a huge success.  I had wanted to freeze them for quick breakfasts for them.  They did not freeze very well at all.

I added sausage with the bacon and a little cheddar cheese to fit with my family's taste.  Also, since I don't much like warm tomatos I didn't broil mine.  The recipe needed a little salt but was overall good.  The kids liked them.  Next time I may try green onions and add a little feta in with the eggs.

I adjusted this to fit our taste and by what we had on hand.  It is a great basic recipe to build off of and add variety, even in the same batch.  I think this would be great to pre-bake for camping, then reheat, without the tomatoes or avacado.

I found this bland and dense. I even added some thyme and mushrooms. The tomatoes made the top mushy. I was so wanting to like this as I am always looking for new breakfast ideas for my farmer husband. :)

This is delicious and easy! We found the recipe on A|R at the last minute for a Thanksgiving breakfast and didn't have potatoes or shallot.. We subbed a bit of finely minced onion and chopped some frozen french fries. We also used equal parts Parmesan and Cheddar, with some salsa on the side.  Will definitely do this again!!

I tried a variation of this recipe as follows:
6 eggs
6 slices of maple bacon
3 slices white bread
1/2 cup cheddar 
Adobo
Pepper
Red pepper flakes
2 red potatoes
Rosemary


1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Cook bacon in a skillet. In a bowl, peel and shred 2 potatoes, add 3 pieces of white bread broken into small pieces, rosemary, and shredded cheese. Cube cooked bacon, transfer that and half the grease to the bowl of potatoes and bread, mix. In a separate bowl beat eggs, add adobo, pepper, red pepper flakes.
3. Put bread, bacon, potato mixture into greased glass dish, add beaten eggs. Bake at 400 degrees uncovered for 45 minutes, adjust for dish and recipe size.

Next time I'm not including potatoes.
