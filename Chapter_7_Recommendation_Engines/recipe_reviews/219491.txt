Fantastic recipe. Used 2 lb chicken breast, coated in thyme, rosemary, and basil then topped with butter pats and baked. Fork shredded the chicken, which distributed the spices throughout all the meat. Aside from that, followed the recipe as written. Would possibly add a little more gravy and add it in layers along with the filling, the filling was too dense for it to filter through so the bottom and top only had gravy. Finally, best in a deep dish pie pan. Everyone at home and at work raved about this recipe. You won't be disappointed.

Delicious! My husband actually made this one and he's not the best cook and it still turned out wonderful! He did cook the veggies for a lot longer than 15 minutes but that was the only change he made

This was a great recipe.  Followed the recipe w/ one small change - instead of using water w/ the chicken gravy, I used some of the chicken broth the veggies cooked in.  It didn't get as thick as I would've preferred it.  Regardless very good recipe!

I made this and followed the recipe. It was excellent and my family loved it!!! The only thing was that it made so much I ended up putting the pie crust in a 9x13 glass dish and topping it with a couple of extra pie crust's that I had. Nothing went to waste..my family ate it all within a couple of days.

Very good for a traditional pot pie recipe ... simple to prepare (though you need to start a couple of hours prior to your meal).  I made no modifications other than using half gravy mix, and half roux with chicken stock, and this turned out fine.

Great recipe. I used a 3" deep casserole dish and doubled the pie crust. Also did not use water...cooked all in low-sodium chicken broth. If you do this, be careful how much extra salt you add. Also used 2 packages of chicken gravy and 2 mushroom gravy and added some mushrooms rather than the corn. Lastly I only cooked it for about 30min or the crust would have burned. Since all is cooked going in, the only reason it goes in the oven is to bake the piecrust. YUM!!!

The gravy could have been better and the cost of the ingredients for this dish could be reduced greatly by making some minor changes. Not the best I've had but far from the worst.

Keep the broth you heated the veggies in to use to make the gravy. Also, if you are lactose intolerant, use it in place of milk.

My husband asked me to give this recipe 7 out of 5 stars.  It was that GOOD!  My whole family loved this recipe and everyone went back for seconds.  This is unheard of in my house!

I followed the recipe as directed using very fresh organic ingredients.  Only major change I made was to pan fry 2 fresh organic chicken breasts in 1 tbsp. of olive oil, then fork shred.  I'm a novice cook, so the recipe took much longer to prep & cook than I expected.  

There was enough ingredients to make 2 pies, so since I didn't have an extra pie crust, I froze the remaining ingredients and will likely make soup.  Next time, I will be sure to buy 2 pie crusts and freeze the second before I bake, so we can have pot pie in near future without all the prep work.

Absolutely recommend!

This recipe really was to die for!! The only change I made was to add twice the gravy that it called for. I could tell it needed more after adding the first mix. Really amazing dinner tonight.

Made this over the weekend. WOW. Definitely a keeper And a sharer!  Used a can each of Cream of Chicken and Cream of Mushroom soup mixed with about 1/2C half&half.  Included a small can of mushroom pieces(drained), a bag of frozen mixed veggies, and a few, fresh small potatoes (quartered). Didn’t have thyme, so I substituted 1/2tsp of poultry seasoning. Mixed it all and added salt/ pepper to taste. Poured on top of my pre-baked bottom crust, added the top crust, covered the crust edges and baked as instructed.  Since it was all I had on hand,  I used frozen PUFF PASTRY dough, not Pie Crust. Although the bottom puffed when I pre-baked, I just pushed it all down into the pie plate.  The bottom crust turned out crispy, as was the top which really made the pie super yummy.   We all had second helpings!

Great recipe. I agree with other reviewers that the filling makes enough for 2 or 3 pies. I saved it to make chicken noodle soup the next day. I did make some changes to lighten it up that probably made it a 4-star; but I'm certain the recipe as written is a 5 star. I used baked boneless chicken breast and omitted the butter (actually by accident!). I didn't even miss the butter although I'm sure that would have made a huge difference. Next time I'll probably use half the butter called for. I recommend lining the edges of the crust with aluminum foil to avoid burning.

I made it last night for dinner and it turned out great. Outside temp had dropped to the 60's and it was the perfect choice. I made two 9" pies and I should have added just a little more juice to them. Next time I will keep that in mind.

It was DELICIOUS!!! My first pot pie was a huge success. I cooked the onions in chicken broth with potatoes first with spices then added the other (all frozen) veggies and simmered until I shredded the chicken. Made the gravy and assembled. Baked 45mins and it was perfect.

It was a great recipe, but wasn’t as creamy as I like my pot pies. I loved the egg wash to the top crust. Loved the veggies. Had a lot extra veggies so I saved the remainder for another pie filling.

I am reading through the recipe and see it says to boil the veggies in the chicken broth then drain, and use the water to make the gravy.  I could be wrong, but I personally would never throw away chicken broth.

This is probably the worst recipe I’ve tried on this web site, and I’ve tried a lot.  I wish I’d just eaten the roasted chicken with vegetables on the side. My husband, who eats almost anything, had me pour brown gravy over it in order to finish it. I made the crust myself and that was the only good thing about it.

The pie recipe was a good one. Unfortunately it took way more then 40 min. to cook. Also, if I wouldn't have seasoned my meat more it would have been very, very bland. I made brown gravy to go with which made up for the blandness.

My husband had seconds, we both enjoyed this chicken pot pie. Using a Costco roasted chicken made preparation easy. The only changes I made were left out thyme which I don't care for and doubled peas, our preference instead of corn.
Using readymade crust made for less time and work. Definitely will make this comfort food again.

This was my first time making chicken pot pie, and it turned out pretty great. I used chicken broth instead of water for the gravy and it greatly improved the quality of it. My only issue is that I think the recipe calls for too many vegetables; I had a full pie and about a third of the vegetables leftover. Otherwise it tasted great and I look forward to making it again.

Chicken pot pie is one of my favs.  Made this and came out really.  Not sure if did something wrong but was able to make 2, 9 inch pies.  Next time I may try to take used chicken broth from veggies.  Thicken and use instead of gravy mix.

My British husband Jason & I made this together!  We used what we had on hand and it was delicious!   We used lemon pepper rotisserie chicken, fresh cut carrots & baby fingerling potatoes, canned sweet peas, and frozen corn!   I used my French white quiche dish set on a cookie sheet to catch drips and a bit of overflow but it was perfectly yummy! He said it tasted just like what his Mum used to make!   It was fun creating something yummy in the kitchen together, especially while having to work from home due to the COVID-19 virus.

I had chicken thigh meat already shredded in the freezer which I used in this recipe.  Other than that, I made the recipe exactly as written.  I thought it was very good but a bit bland.  Next time, I will add mushrooms and up the spice level.  My family enjoyed the dish and I look forward to making it again.

Comments were right. It did make enough for 2 pies. I ended up mixing up everything that was left and freezing so when I have another crust I can make another by simply thawing filling. I also felt it needed a little more seasoning. That may be my fault I was skimpy with the salt because of prepackaged gravy I was afraid it would be too salty it wasn't. I may add some poultry seasoning and the thyme or fresh herbs next time. Also use a sheet pan with sides on it because I did have some butter pour out onto the sheet pan and what rolled off edge hit heating element and flamed up. Don't want a fire with your pot pie. lol. In fact you could probably cut back on the butter a little. Thanks JenHusted for a tasty pot pipe recipe. Update: I have now used the filling that I froze. I was a little concerned because of mixing everything together to freeze I wouldn't be able to layer like recipe directs but that didn't matter at all. It was super tasty.

I used boneless, skinless thighs I baked in Heinz “Salad Sauce,” a British product I needed to get rid of, only a can of chicken broth, a can of beef consommé, and 2 Knorr turkey gravy packets.  I just mixed the gravy packets in with the broth and vegetables, saving a step.  It needed no water!  Absolutely delicious!!  Seriously by far the tastiest one I’ve ever eaten!

Made as directed, except poached 3 chicken breasts. Served to guests. Not a bit leftover.  This is a “keeper”

This was as good as I had hoped for. I came here to echo what a few others said. This makes entirely too much to fit in one pie dish. I had veggies left over even putting it in a round casserole dish. When I do it again I will either make two pies or cut the recipe in half. I did make my own gravy with the drippings from the chicken I roasted rather than the packet gravy.

So...I forgot to send pics. Again, I would either half some ingredients to make 1 pie (carrot, celery and gravy) or double the rest for 2. The seasonings should be good either way as they are infused in the veggies. This is a new family favorite!

I made this as directed and it’s fantastic. I halved the recipe and only made only one pie and it was awesome.  Next time I will up the amount of gravy and drop the cooking temp to 400 but that’s just a personal preference. It’s great as is. I have never made a pot pie before. Thank you for making it fool proof!

This was delicious!  My family rated this a 9 out of 10!  I have a couple of picky eaters and they scraped the bottom of the dish!

After reading all the reviews I was a little leery about making this but it turned out awesome!! I followed the recipe pretty much to a tee. The only thing I changed was I did a full teaspoon of salt and a full teaspoon of pepper. I did have some veggies leftover so those could be cut down a bit but it didn’t affect how it came out. **Important - Let the gravy cool to thicken before making the pot pie. Also, I forgot the butter before putting the top crust on but I didn’t miss it at all. This is a great rainy, cold day meal!!

This was absolutely amazing. I omitted the green beans but the rest was as per the recipe. Crust was so flaky and good. Great comfort food!

Best chicken pot pie I've ever made. My husband and picky eater kids thoroughly enjoyed it! I used two packets of gravy and two cans of cream of Chicken soup and had to add a little extra water to thin it out a bit. I also baked two chicken breasts in the oven with some thyme rosemary and sage. and that is what I shredded and put into the veggie mixure. Love this recipe!! Thank you!

Very tasty. My first time attempting a pot pie. I will definitely make this again. I used turkey gravy instead of chicken and it was a nice full rich flavor!

To be fair, I didn’t really follow this recipe as written, but the proportions and method are good. I made my own crust and gravy instead of store-bought, and I sautéed all veggies except for potatoes instead of boiling. I added sage to the thyme for seasoning. This recipe is now a regular in my house. Even my picky son likes it. It’s easy and very good. My only suggestion is to use a deep dish pie shell/pan. I don’t know how this volume of ingredients could fit in a regular 9” pie dish. I used a 10” cast iron deep skillet.

With just a little more gravy and some more seasoning this actually makes two pies. Well worth all the trouble!

Delicious and easy. I made a big batch of filling in one deep pot and used a 9x13 pan because my deepest pie plate is still too shallow. True, pushing a round pie crust into a rectangle dish meant a bit of gap in the crust, but it was close enough for me. I love the filling in a bowl by itself without any crust, too. Great way to get your veggies!

It was an instant success.  My family does not like celery or carrots, So I subbed Parsnip and red bell pepper.  I baked it at 325 for about 12 minutes longer and the biscuits.....they were perfect

Followed the recipe in general, substituting veggies based on what we had.  Added some rosemary & thyme as well. Used chicken stock as base for gravy. Pot pie was delicious.  If you're beginning your cooking journey, follow the recipe to get a feel for it. If more confident, make some alterations. I will definitely make this again, but may roast the veggies first to carmelize them.  May also try adding beef or sausage. For us, this recipe is a keeper.
