I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit with everyone!! The only reason i did not give this 5 stars, is because it was way too sweet for me.  In the future, I will cut back on the sugar by half in both the sweet potato mixture and the strerusel topping or maybe add more sweet potatoes.  My dad is a diabetic, so I used Splenda (brown and white) in this recipe without a problem.  As a personal touch, rather than have all of the streusel on the top, I layered the sweet potatoes and streusel twice. This really helped distribute the streusel's crunch and flavor throughout the whole casserole, not just the top. This recipe will now be my first  choice for a sweet potato casserole recipe.  Thanks!!

I always want to try a recipe exactly how it is listed, but it didn't happen that way for this Thanksgiving.  I also didn't have any orange zest or coconut, so they were left out.  It also helps if you really read the recipe.  The ingredients for the topping were suppose to be set aside, but I didn't read far enough to "set aside" and added it to the mashed sweet potatoes. So I had that plus the rest of the ingredients.  I did want that good topping so just used about 1/2 c of br. sugar with some chopped pecans.  Even with my goofs, it was still a hit. It wasn't over powering with sweetness.  I used Splenda brown sugar combination with real sugar.

I made this for the first time for Thanksgiving last week and it was awesome. I used 5 large sweet potatoes, peeled and boiled, so the casserole would not be dessert-sweet (and so I'd have more leftovers!). I also omitted the coconut and orange zest. 
It was the perfect flavor. The pecan topping provides a great crunch. I'll be making this every year!!

Wonderfully flavored! I've made sweet potato casserole before but this recipe is so wonderful with the orange zest. I did reduce the orange zest to about 1/4 tsp and it was the perfect hint of citrus in this dish without overpowering it. I did omit the coconut. I made this for a family reunion and have had so many requests for this recipe, even from someone who hates sweet potatos. It makes a wonderful dessert also!

My family has prepared the same Christmas sweet potato casserole recipe for years.  This year I decided to take a risk and try something new.  The biggest fans of this recipe were the ones who never really liked sweet potatoes!  The orange flavor was very fresh and light.  The crunchy topping was also delicious.

This was really good.  I usually read reviews before I make a dish.  I don't care for coconut so I left that out.  Since I've never cooked a sweet potato before, I used canned yams per someone elses review.  I don't care for sweet potatoes/yams but I did try this dish and it was very delicious.  I'm making it again next week for another Thanksgiving potluck lunch.

Overall, a good dish, but had way too much orange flavor that overpowered the other flavors.  I would suggest cutting back the orange zest or eliminating it altogether.

These sweet potatoes were very good.  I made them for some New Zealand friends who aren't used to mashing their sweet potatoes or eating them with sugar and they went back for seconds.  I would definitely make these again.  I did leave out the orange since I didn't have one in the house.  I also share the opinion that the topping could be cut in half (and I really love sweet things) if you don't want it so sweet.  I also think the egg is noticeable if you think about it, so maybe I'll cut down to one egg next time.

This was the best sweet potato casserole recipe I have ever tried.  I changed it a little.  I only added about half of the sugar that is called for, and since I didn't have any oranges for the zest, I added a little bit of orange flavoring.  Thank you.  It was great.

This is FANTASTIC! I'm from the South and this is definately a taste of home. When my husband decides to "cheat"(on his diet...)this is what he asks me to make! I use a 1/4 cup of heavy cream or sweetened condensed milk, either is good, instead of the regular milk and no zest. Great recipe!

This has become a favorite for my family.  The first time I made it I did not have orange zest, so I just skipped it.  Everyone absolutely loved it.  The second time I made it, we used the zest, and it wasn't as widely received. It may be a bit sweet for some, but that can easily be modified by cutting down the sugar just a bit.  Otherwise, it is excellent.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a GREAT recipe!  I used 1/2 cup brown sugar in the potatoes instead of the white sugar, and I left out the coconut (my family doesn't like it) and it was awesome.  In my opinion, the orange zest makes it 'different' and not the same-old sweet potato casserole.  Next time I will use less sugar in the topping - it is a bit too sweet.

I made this for my first Thanksgiving at my house, it was a BIG HIT! I thought about doubling the recipe afraid it would not feed everyone but I am glad I didn't because it is so sweet you can only eat a small portion. I left out the orange because it didn't appeal to me. This will be a traditional dish every Thanksgiving.

This was way too sweet!! The topping was this very thick layer of dry sweet stuff that added nothing to the potatoes! I gave it 2 stars because the potatoes tasted okay.

I'd like to try this with evaporated milk instead, to make it a bit creamier. We also drizzled some melted butter on the top at the end of the cooking to moisten it a bit.

This recipe turned out fantastic with a few minor adjustments. I did not put any eggs in the sweet potatos, left out the sugar from the sweet potatos and cut the brown sugar for the topping in 1/2. The organge rind really gave it a great taste.  Oh, I also added a little cinnamon.

I misplaced the recipe I usually use at Thanksgiving for sweet potato casserole and came across this one. I decided to take a chance and use it Thanksgiving 2007. It is my new recipe now. I stopped looking for the old one and have made this a solid addition to my recipe box.

This recipe is the bomb! I truly have never had a better sweet potato dish.  I LOVE the orange flavor from the orange peel. We grated them finely and it was super yummy.  I used walnuts instead of pecans because that is what I had handy.  I would also point out for new cooks, the recipe does not say to peel the potatos after cooked, make sure you take the peels off before mashing! Try this recipe!

I love sweet potato casserole and only make it during the holiday's.  I tried this recipe this year and didn't care for the orange flavor in it.  Will make again but without orange zest.

I have made this recipe a few times and love it!  I use fresh sweet potatoes, but I cook them in the microwave, it's takes very little time and is easy.  I don't use the coconut, but do use some orange zest.

This was excellent!  Took to a bday party..and it was gone in no time at all.  I did as someone said and greatly reduced the amount of rind..and I did take the easy route and bought canned yams.

Just made this on Thanksgiving. Sweet potato casserole is normally a staple for our Thanksgiving feast, but I always lose the recipe. This year I picked this one, and it was the best I ever made. I think it was because of the orange zest. It really added to the flavor.

This was great...
unfortunatly, I decided to make it as a side dish to go with stuffed eggplant (also on this site) which was lovely.
It's a great flavour, but I didn't realise it was a dessert!!
Did I miss something, or is this really a side dish in America??
Either way, I didn't make enough to feed everyone who wanted to eat it after thier first bite. It was a huge hit with everyone, even the very fussy who won't normally eat a vegetable!!
Brilliant!

Excellent recipe, very southern dish!!!  I suggest you use half and half, or heavy cream, instead of milk. I've used pecans, and one time bought walnuts on accident, and it was still great with the walnuts.  I've never used coconut.  I think it would make it too sweet, it's already very sweet.  This casserole is even better the next day!

I did add the coconut- wow was it good.  I may try without next time just to see the difference.  But if you at all like coconut- or want to try something a little different- try the coconut and it wont be the average sweet potato casserole.  I agree with someone else- I may cut down on egg, too.  And to keep it from being too sweet- every time I measured- I left out just a little bit of sugar- as not to truly mess with the integrity of the recipe- just a matter of taste.  Will make again.

OMG!!!, this is a good recipe. I had the good sense to cut the white sugar down to 1/3 cup instead of 1/2 cup. I wish I'd cut the brown sugar to 3/4 cup instead of 1 cup. but OMG!!!, this is a good recipe. I also used honey roasted pecans. 5 stars the way it is, 6 stars if cut back on the sugar a little. Ohyea, I did use the coconut.

Excellent!  A real crowd pleaser.  I substituted canned yams for the sweet potatoes.  The topping is wonderful, but I think you could actually cut it in half.  Plan on making this again!

We made 4 steam table pans of this at camp this summer: very good!  The sweetness of the topping combines well with the mellow sweet potatoes; the cruncy pecans contrast well with the mashed potatoes.  Fairly easy to make, too.

This was very good.  I omitted the flour, orange zest and coconut and it still came out great.  Next time I will boil the sweet potatoes to save time and I will add a little more milk to make it creamier.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was a big hit!  I used less sugar than it called for, I used 1/3 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar for the topping and just 1 egg based on other reviews.  It was very good even without the orange zest and pecans (I didn't have either on hand).  Eveyone loved it!  Thanks for sharing!

Everyone loved this!  I only served it because I thought we ought to have all the Thanksgiving dishes.  EVeryone told me not to bother and said they didn't like sweet potatoes anyway.  Then a few people tried this dish and loved it, so then everyone tried it and loved it.  This dish is not a gooey-sweet recipe.  The potatoes have a nice flavor, almost a roasted taste, and the streusel is yummy but not overwhelming.  GREAT dish!

This recipe was wonderful! The only thing I changed was the amount of sugar, otherwise it would have been absolutely too sweet for my family. I cut the brown sugar all the way down to 1/3 cup and the white sugar down to 1/4 cup. With these reductions it was still plenty sweet for us, perhaps because I used sweetened coconut in the topping. If I had used unsweetened coconut, I probably would have used a little more sugar but still not the full amount. I served this with a ham for Christmas and it was the perfect pairing. I'll definitely be making this recipe again and again...no need to look for another sweet potato casserole recipe (and there are a lot out there).

This was just perfect.  This was the dish I was to bring to Thanksgiving tonight.  I fully prepared it at home then brought it in an insulated carrier to be reheated at our destination.  Though I heard a lot of disappointment when other guests found out I didn't make the sweet potatoes with marshmallows, they were INSTANTLY won over.  I even got my boyfriend to eat (and like) it, even though he said he has never liked sweet potatoes.  I was looking for a recipe close to what my late mother made every year.  I believe this was it.  I did not use coconut because mom's recipe never had it.  I did not have an orange to zest, so I used 1 teaspoon of orange juice.  I'm not sure it made any difference, the orange is a very subtle flavor in this dish.  Also I used two large cans of sweet potatoes instead of fresh.  Cheating, I know, but it was still good.  Thanks for the keeper, I will make this throughout the year!

The sweet potato part was really delicious.  And true to the other reviews, some that don't ordinarily like sweet potatoes enjoyed this.  I did find the crumb topping texture to be unappealing, though. I expected it to be more like that of a crumb pie topping. Maybe I had the wrong perception, but if I make this again, I'll probably put about 5 tablespoons butter in the topping mixture instead of 3.

This recipe has earned me a reputation - now they all think I'm a great cook!  Even people who don't like sweet potatoes WILL try and eat these!

Great recipe!  I didn't have any oranges, and it tasted fine without them.  I made a batch with coconut and a batch without, and we preferred it without.

My whole family loved this recipe!! I was looking for something different when I realized I forgot to purchase marshmellows for my usual sweet potato casserole.  For this recipe, I baked the sweet potatos the night before, left out the orange zest, and used walnuts instead of pecans.  This will be served alongside our other traditional favorites from now on!

I cut downjust a tad on the sugar and left out the coconut.  It was so sweet and delicious.  Grown-ups raved that it was so good, almost like dessert.  I can't wait to eat some for leftovers.

I made this with less sugar and butter, and it turned out great.  I  peeled the potatoes, cut them into cubes and boiled them instead of baking them, then added 1/4 cup of melted light butter, 1/4 cup of milk, 1/2 cup of Splenda instead of white sugar, the eggs, vanilla and salt.  I omitted the coconut and orange and skipped the topping all together.  Instead, I just mixed 1/2 cup of dark brown sugar and the chopped pecans into the potatoes.  I didn't even bother with the electric mixer, just mashed the potatoes, added the other ingredients, and stirred it all up with a wooden spoon.

This recipe wasn't even worth trying. Too much hype and it was horrible, the orange zest overpowered the sweet potatoes and the nut mixture was not tasty at all. Next time I will do the typical sweet yams with brown sugar and vanilla and cut the nut mixture in half.

Delicious! Just went with one egg as some reviewers suggested and came out so good and no egg-y at all. Even my husband ate lots, and he is not an avid sweet potato eater :)

I am not a fan of this dish because we usually just make it from the can. What a difference it makes to make it home made...YUMMO The only thing I did different was omit the nuts, coconut, and crumble topping. I just did the traditional marsh mellows on top :)

This was a big success at Thanksgiving.  The only change I would make is the amount of sugar in the recipe.  I think it could be reduced by 1/4 to 1/2.

I over cooked my sweet potatoes and came here to find a alternate recipe and I came across this one. I used 12 sweet pototes so I had to make the measurements 4 times as much. It turned out really good. The thing is next time I will not use the orange zest. I didn't even use a full tablespoon and it was too much of an orange flavor. I would also add cinnamon and nutmug.

This is really good, I only gave it three stars because it is way to sweet.  Cut the topping in half and it will be much better, the rest of the recipe is really good.  I added cinnamon and nutmeg into the potato mixture and my family loved it.  I'll make it again, but next time I'll reduce the topping.

I was wanting a healthier version so I just didn't add the 1 cup of white sugar or the white flour. I enjoyed the orange zest and used some huge chinks of cocnut from the health food store.

I agree that the toppings for this recipe could be halved and still taste great.  I also thought with the orange zest that a little ginger root would be great so I added some (didn't measure it, sorry) and it was wonderful!  I will definitely be making this again.

I know it's kind of pointless to rate a recipe when you've changed it, but this was such a hit with my family that I wanted to anyway.  I added a sweet potato, and used half the white sugar and orange zest that the recipe called for, and one egg instead of two.  It was absolutely wonderful.  I'll be making it again and again!  Thank you!

They were the hit of Thanksgiving!  I omitted the orange zest based on other reviews and I did add the coconut.  They were very sweet, but sweet and me get along pretty well - so no complaints!

For starters I made the recipe as given. I'm not one to change the ingredients, make changes, etc and then rate it. I always feel it is unfair to the poster. With that being said- I thought it was ok. Nothing to rave about. However, I had two people tell me they loved it. They really like the orange taste.(orange zest) 
It was good but not sure I would make again. 
Thanks for posting the recipe.

This was AMAZING!!  I left out the orange zest just because I didn't have an orange.  Also, I only used about half of the topping - I'm going to try putting the rest of it on a frozen pumpkin pie.  The only downside to this recipe is that I wanted to eat the whole dish at one sitting!!

This will be the third Thanksgiving that I will make this casserole. Everyone I make it for loves it but it is very sweet. I've never tried it with the coconut or orange zest.

The hit of last Thanksgiving...and am making it again this year.  Only downside, I think, was it is a bit sweet.  Don't know what reducing the sugar will do to the overall taste but I'm trying it.  Very good but almost like candy

Use less butter than called for, I scratched orange zest on the first batch... will try some other time perhaps. Touch of coconut was yummy:)

This is very nice but is very very sweet. A little goes a long way on your dinner plate. I did use the coconut but don't think I would again to bring the sweetness down a little. Also I boiled my sweet potatos instead of baking this as baking them was taking too long. I made this for Thanksgiving and am going to make it again for Christmas.

I've made this several times now. Everyone loves it. I don't use orange zest, a little less granulated sugar and a little more vanilla

This one is a keeper!
I have been making this recipe every Thanksgiving since 2005. Measure orange zest exactly but DO NOT leave out. It balances out the sweet so nicely. This is the one thanksgiving recipe that my kids mention over and over.

This is a staple at our Thanksgiving & Christmas family get togethers. I do not add the coconut. I’ve been making it now for 6 or 7 years. The orange zest is what really gives it a unique yummy flavor. Love it!!

I’ve edited this recipe a bit and it’s more of a dessert for my family, but I always base my sweet potato casserole on this recipe! Thank you for sharing! I will make sure to write down what I do differently on Thanksgiving and upload my own twist to this delicious recipe! I do wish it told what size dish was recommended for this. ;)

Amazing! Spectacular! Phenomenal! Will make this again and again. Husband raved for days and insists I should make this at least once a month. Was a huge hit on Thanksgiving with the entire family. A new staple in my recipe book!

This is great. My timing was a little off because it says cook time 40min. But you need to cook the sweet potato for an hour as well. Now I know that and can synchronize all my dishes better. I love the coconut and pecans, they match perfectly with the sweet potato!

The orange peel really sets this one apart. I used it for a July 4th party & at Thanksgiving. I may have gone a little overboard w. too much orange the 2nd time, but folks like it a lot.
