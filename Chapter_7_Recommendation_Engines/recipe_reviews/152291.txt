WAY TOO SWEET!!!  The chocolate part was edible.  The finished product was almost inedible.  The only change I made was I didn't make my own pie shell.  I don't think that could have made that much of a difference to the final taste.  I whipped the chocolate filling for more than 2 minutes.  It was terribly grainy, almost crunchy.  The only thing I could suggest is to use sugar free jam.  MAYBE that would help.

Great! And yes, tooooooo sweet, which i love!   I also didn't do the crust and instead of having that big pie, i make small pies so i can take one for a snack at work. Addition to the garnish, i put jelly raspberry flavor and powder chocolate.   It's my sister's birthday in a couple of days, she will probably surprise and like it, specially that i made it myself.   Thank you for the recipe! I tought doing pies is really hard, but after this, i don't think so.

Used the French Silk Pie recipie, which is GREAT, because I love the chocolate and raspberry combination, I just drizzled the serving dish with a raspberry sauce and decorated with a couple of raspberries and mint leaf.  Pretty and luscious!

Very good!!  Would prefer if the filling was just a little firmer though.  Any ideas on how to do that?
