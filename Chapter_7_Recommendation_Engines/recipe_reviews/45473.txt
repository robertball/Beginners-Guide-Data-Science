YUMMY!  I made this with fresh shrimp and crab rather than the canned...just chopped them up!  So delicious with crusty baguette hunks!  Once the market was out of crab so I used lobster instead!  Oh so scrumptious, too!

I did this in my slow cooker.  It's best after you've let it all heat up for a bit.  I added real bacon bits for a bit of added flavor.  

I made this a second time and used real shrimp, chopped up fine, that was a hit.  I did it another time, let the cheese cool, spread it on tortillas, rolled them and up and slice them to make seafood swirls - this was a HUGE hit!  Thank you Jackie!

This recipe is out of this world!  My co-worker made it for a "Fun-Due" party that we had.  We came up with different uses for this dip!  WARNING:  This dip is so good that you could easily make yourself sick on it!  Very addictive!

This dip is absolutely awesome.  The only thing I do differently is I only use two packs of cream cheese--4 packs makes A LOT!  I never need so much.  I also use real shrimp and lump crab meat with this.  I add scallions, red onion, freshly ground black pepper and kosher salt to taste.  If you cannot find a banana pepper (but it does make it so tasty!) then you can use a sweet yellow pepper as well.  All in all, always a hit, every time I make it.

This dip was very good.  I cut the cream cheese in half, but used the rest of the ingredients regularly.  Both my husband and I loved it.  I might try sun-dried tomatoes next time!

I loved this! I used a can of real crab and went through and made sure there were no shells or hard pieces. I bought uncooked, good size shrimp and then cooked and chopped them and added them all in fresh. I think that really made it tasty. Everyone enjoyed it...some with crackers and others on cubed bread. Excellent! I also had this in my electric fondue pot on very low and it worked well.

This was so good!  A great cool dip to eat at a picnic on a hot day.  The garlic, peppers, and onions give it a lot of flavor, and it was very easy to throw together.  I just dumped everything except the seafood into my food processor for a minute, then stirred in the crab and shrimp.

Not the greatest dip for how expensive it was to make.  You have to really let it cook or all you can taste is the onion.  Two cans of shrimp and more banana peppers might make it better.

this is a bit bland. I used imitation crabmeat and fresh baby shrimp, chopped them finely in a food processor. I think red onion would be better. I added some onion powder and garlic powder, parmesan cheese and a couple dollops of sour cream trying to punch it up a bit. It also makes alot, I only used three pckgs of cream cheese and good thing cause my fondue pot was full.

THANK YOU JACKIE!  I am by far not a great cook, when I made this, no one believed that I made it.  It came out perfect, tasted great and was easy to make.

I was disappointed with this dip after reading the good reviews. I thought it would taste better than it did. I might've been rushing it, but it was not very good. Sorry.

I only had 3 1/2 bars of cream cheese so I used that.. I also used fresh shrimp and crab meat (imitation) and cut it up...
it is really really good
the only thing is I just feel like something is missing.. I dont know if Im suppose to serve it hot or cold.
as soon as the cream cheese melted I mixed in all other ingredients and tried it.. it was so good.. so now I have it in the fridge to see how it tastes cold..
this is something I will be taking to my sisters house for thanksgiving...
my husband and kids loved it..
my husband suggested green onions to give it a lil more color.. I dont know.. maybe I'll take a small amount out on the side and try that....
overall this was really good...

Very good!  It is really rich and makes a lot so it is good for a large party. I also served it with crusty bread and wheat crackers and it was a hit!

Man, this is really tasty!!  And I've only tasted it out of the pan on the stove!  I'm making this to take to a girls' weekend at Lake Anna.  I don't typically serve something that I've never made before but the ingredients sounded like a good combination.  I used fresh crab (one lump and one claw) and the canned tiny shrimp.  Also, I purchased some plain melba thins and plain  pita chips to use--I thought that tortilla chips might make it too salty, though I do love my salt.  This would be excellent on celery or other veggies too to keep it low carb.  Jackie and Csusanne, this is a keeper.
