This recipe is delicious and very easy to make!  I made 16 Oz. of pasta to approx. 1 1/2 cups cream.  I do not like too much sauce.  It was awesome!  I am forwarding this recipe to all of my friends.  I even added steamed broccoli to the mixture at the end.

Very Taaty! I've been eating terribly lately so I used Half & Half instead of Cream. Added a little bit of flour to thicken the sauce up. 

I will definitely make this again.

Delicious!  Simply made it 'as is' and added about a cup of broccoli, carrots and cauliflower to pasta as it cooked.  Coworkers loved it.  One even enjoyed it cold.  Make it even easier using precooked chicken and shrimp.  Easily doubled.

Everyone enjoyed this dish.  I added extra Old Bay and sprinkled shredded parmesan over top.  A dash of red pepper flakes adds a nice kick too.  Served with breadsticks.

Rich and creamy !! Cooked as stated no substitutions except half and half for heavy cream (didn't have any).  Will make this one again for sure especially for company.

My husband loved this pasta! He said it was one of his favorite things I've ever made, plus he didn't want me to give any away either. To be honest, I am not a fan of these type of pastas but my husband who does like them loved it. He said that the cream mixture made the recipe. I also added some vegetables - broccoli, carrots and cauliflower seems to do great. I am so surprised that everyone could love this recipe with the only spice being Old Bay. Very nice recipe and we will make again!

This is so good. I have never cooked with old bay seasoning before, and I like it! I can't believe my extremely picky son liked it too. I added frozen peas and fresh zucchini during the cream adding stage. Thanks for the recipe.

This was pretty good, and very easy. I added fresh broccoli to the pasta while cooking, and used half and half but other than that, I made it just as written. I think heavy cream would have been better, but I try to cut calories and fat wherever I can. I will definitely make this again and may even try with just chicken and different vegetables.

Made this for Father's Day. Hubby said it was restaurant quality. I did add some spaghetti sauce, about 6 ounces, to the cream to make a blush sauce. Easy to make and delicious.
