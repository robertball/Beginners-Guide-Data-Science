This is a great Asian-style noodle dish. I used to work at a Chinese Restaurant and the simplicity of this dish closely mirrors that style of cooking. If you're looking for a noodle recipe with a heavy or zesty sauce, French or Italian-style dishes are a better choice. That said.....I LOVE this dish! I used vermicelli instead of the rice noodles and doubled the garlic, soy sauce, and chili sauce. A very quick and simple dish. Thanks for posting Serena!

I liked this recipe, even though I kinda changed it up. After boiling the noodles. I heated the oil and garlic, then added some leftover chicken, I put in a few tsp of teriyaki sauce, and the added the noodles, stir and added some more teriyaki sauce and served. My daughter and I liked it. I wanted to add the chili sauce but I didnt have any. So I use a dash of pepper, which really didnt do anything so I added a little soy sauce. Yum.

I have to agree with those who rated this as bland.  As written, it is *very* bland; it literally had next to no flavor.  I added a tablespoon of sesame oil and a teaspoon of fresh ginger, minced.  In the end, it wasn't bad, but it still lacked some flavor.

We tried this recipe tonight when guests came over and it was a hit !!!  I did like others had suggested and doubled the garlic, chili sauce and soy sauce.  I also used sesame oil for the regular oil and added shredded carrots and chicken.

I didn't quite follow the recipe. I added chicken and doubled the chili sauce and soy sauce. I also didn't have green onions, so I used a small white onion, and cooked it with the garlic. My husband and son loved it, but I found it a little bland. Next time, I'll add some vegetables and maybe a chile pepper. But, it's a good basic recipe, if you don't like alot of spice.

I thought this was good but suggest omitting the chili sauce (or at least minimizing it) and replacing with ginger.

This makes a nice simple side dish.  I used 2 TBS sesame oil instead of veg oil, 2 cloves garlic, 2 TBS soy sauce, 1 TBS chili sauce, and green onion.  I forgot salt and pepper.  You could do a lot with this recipe, adding meat or veggies if desired.

This is a fine recipe for the "quick" category.
I used Vietnamese chili garlic sauce and chopped scallions instead of green onions.

Doubled the soy, chili sauce, and garlic as recommended.  My husband really liked these.  I made 'em to go with the Grilled Asian Chicken.  Two easy and pretty tasty recipes.  I'm happy, but next time I'll boil the noodles for a minute and a half.

These are quite good.  I put extra garlic and soy sauce and sprinkled on red pepper flakes and salt at the end.  I'll fry in sesame oil and add ginger next time.  It's good to have a quick, tasty rice noodle recipe because I have celiac and wheat allergy and can't eat regular noodles.

Excellent! Made as written used Sriracha instead of chili paste. Added chopped shanghai bok choy and drizzled a little sesame on top instead of green onion. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is great and easy, although I thought it lacked a little flavor as written. To spice things up I used sesame oil, as others have suggested, instead of vegetable oil. I also added sliced bell peppers, sliced mushrooms, sliced sweet onions, at least doubled the garlic, soy sauce and I used Thai Chili sauce, which is a little sweet. I did not have any green onions, so I used garlic chives instead, which made for a beautiful and tasty topping! This is easy and makes for great leftovers, hot or cold!

This is a good base recipe. It's fine as-is, just a bit boring, but it's super easy to jazz up. I like to add slices of onion, red bell pepper, and broccoli. Like other reviewers have suggested, I fry it in a mix of vegetable and sesame oils for a little extra flavor. It's perfect along side Asian-seasoned chicken.

It's a great dish, I followed someones suggestion and added twice as much soy sauce for more flavour.
Don't be fooled by how spicy it tastes when just cooked because once its cooled down the real flavour comes out and the chile is just the right amount.

Other than swapping sesame oil for the veg oil, I made this as directed.  I thought it was a good base recipe but still rather bland and in need of some added veggies, peppers and onions perhaps?  Shredded cabbage?

I sauteed garlic, diced carrots and broccoli in olive oil, then added some shrimp.  Instead of soy and chili sauce, I added Teriyaki sauce and ground ginger.  Everybody liked it, even my 17 month old!  This is the first time I have used rice noodles and will definitely be buying them again!

Everyone liked these for our take-out night. It's very easy and my picky eater loved eating with chopsticks. I added garlic powder instead of fresh garlic and left out green onions(because of picky eater). I didn't measure the sauce ingredients just added to pan and it turned out perfect. I served Chip Chicken Lollipops also and it turned out to be a fun dinner.

This is a wonderful basic recipe with endless possibilities. I didn't have rice noodles, green onions, or garlic; I did have VitaSpelt angel hair pasta and the rest of the ingredients list. Since I live alone I only cook enough for one serving; if I made more I'd eat it.  I don't measure much...I sauteed 1/4 of a yellow onion in 1 tsp each of safflower and sesame oil in a small teflon frying pan. I dumped in some garlic powder and added the noodles, then a splash of low sodium soy sauce, a small blob of chili garlic sauce and a few drops of toasted sesmae oil. It was delicious, but next time I'll try using less oil and adding some vegetables etc.

Just tried this recipe! I loved it! I didn't have sweet chili thai sauce so I used 1/2 tbsp of plum sauce instead and a dash of chili peppers. I think it's Important to have the green onion as it off sets the flavor so well! Simple, easy and most ingredients on hand. I will definitely make this again.

Not bad. I didn't have the chili sauce, so I just used some hot sauce. I didn't have green onions either, but I wish I did. It would have been the perfect finishing touch. Quick and easy, thanks!

Can't believe how a simple recipe could be so outstanding!!!!  Added a handful of baked chicken, doubled the spices (not the soy)and topped with a few chopped peanuts.  Woke up at 4:00 a.m. craving to eat the leftovers!!!  Waited until 8:00 a.m.

Delicious! of course I make my own recipe and add couple of more ingredients... like carrots, broccoli, cilantro, meat... I used pork meat then lightly salted and fry with chopped garlic (use just a little bit of oil because pork releases its own oil...) I mixed it with a sauce made with onion, tomato, soy sauce, chilli sauce & oyster sauce. Also I stir fry the rice noodle. I added a little bit of water to soft them. Mixed all the meat, sauce and noodle ...add at the end the veggies to not over cook them.

The 3 star rating is for the recipe as is, however, it does have 5 star potential.  As written, I find this fairly bland, but it IS a great spring board.  I tried the sesame oil recommendation from another user, and this is tasty if you don't add too many other flavors.  I definitely use more chili sauce (sriracha) and more soy, and if using vegetable oil, I add lemon pepper for extra flavor.  Turns out well, although I've yet to perfect it.  Adding Chinese BBQ pork pieces make it VERY yummy.  I've seen other recipes that call for shredded cabbage and carrot, which I might add next.  Would love to hear other recommendations, as well as a good recipe for Pan  Cit!

A good basic recipe. I modified mine drastically. Instead of boiling the vermicelli, I soaked them in lukewarm water for about 15 minutes (or until soft) while I chopped up Taiwanese cabbage, carrots and sweet peas for a vegetarian dish. Dried shiitake mushroom would also complement the dish, but I didn't have any on hand. In addition to vegetable oil, I added a dash of sesame oil to fry the garlic. As well, I cooked the vegetable with oyster sauce, sweet soy sauce and light soy sauce before adding the vermicelli for a quick toss. Sorry if I butchered your original recipe!

I've tried this recipe before and agree it has little flavor. I made this recipe and put "healthier hot legs" on top of the noodles. It was really good but I do recommend not adding as much hot sauce as the recipes calls for because it's super hot. This is a great versatile recipe.

This was the 1st time I ever tried to do these and they were very good even though I did not follow the original recipe. For a more simpler taste I did not use the chili sauce and substituted the green onion for reg. onion since I did not have green. I would make it again.

This was just my style! A little spicy, and best of all quick and easy. This is delicious. I didn't measure any of the spices or sauces just did it all to taste. This will be a new favorite for lunch!

I made this into a meal by adding asparagus tips and cooked shrimp.  I'm also big on flavor, so I doubled the chili & soy sauce, added rosemary, and actually sauted the green onion in with the garlic and asparagus.  Ifyou don't like spicy food, don't increase the chili sauce, but we loved it!

This is a great alternative to fried rice.  I took suggestions of reviewers and doubled the garlic and sauce. I used 1 TBS vegetable oil and 1 TBS sesame oil.  I did not have chili sauce so I used Crystal hot sauce.  I also added about 1 tsp. fresh ginger, which made all the difference.

Although it is quick and easy there is little flavour.  I changed the vegetable oil to seasame, added more soy, chili sauce and seasame seeds.  It still was flavourless.  Needs to be spiced up.  Next time I will add ginger and more garlic.

It was very good.  I added shrimp cut into pieces, sliced carrots, celery and onion, and left off the green onion.  I also doubled the sauce like some people said.  It's a lot of changes, but it's a good base.  I also used sesame oil in addition to the vegetable oil.

Maybe I didn't have a wok big enough, but the noodles didn't turn out like they should have. I have to add more oil in order to coat all of the noodles. This, of course, made everything greasy. I won't be making this again.

Soooo simple and delicious. I sometimes add a drop or two of Chinese "hot" oil just to give it a little kick. My 3 grand babies who love anything Chinese, often ask me to "Do the noodles, Mama"! Makes lunchtime a no-brainer. Many thanks!

This recipe sounded good when I read it, but I found it to have no flavor except the heat from the chili sauce (I used sambal oelek).  I am disappointed & wish I could have given it a better review.

Very bland as written, but it’s a good concept. I added more flavor and would give it 4 stars by doubling the garlic and soy, adding 1 tsp garlic paste, and adding some sesame oil.

This recipe is very simple. I did make changes, I quadrupled the amount of sauce called for and added shrimp and cashews. I'd definitely make it again.

I loved it!!! I made a package of rice noodles and didn't want to make SOO much so I decided to just use for the amount I wanted. I like a ton of garlic so I had 4 cloves of garlic, which was good for me and instead of green onion I used normal onion and cooked it a little with the garlic. Added chicken to have some protein in it and fill me up a little more. Super good!! I added 2 chili sauces, one was the sirachi chili sauce and a sweet chili sauce with the soy sauce and it was good :) Definitely recommend and super easy to make as a single serving noodles as long as the noodles are already cooked!!

Very simple recipe. I added everything except the noodles in a skillet and simmered for about 3-4 minutes. I added the noodles at the end just to coat with the sauce. Turned out great and will be making this dish again.

delicious change. Easy to prepare. Ingredients that I always have on hand. Adding soy sauce usually makes a dish too salty. It was the perfect amount to give the dish a great taste. Loved it and will make it again.

Super quick and delicious recipe - I added some baby spinach for some veggies and I added some spicy stir-fry oil (president's choice) for a little extra kick. But the original recipe listed on here is totally fine :)

Good for a fast weeknight meal. I followed the advice given here to double the ingredients (besides the noodles). I also added a bit of oyster sauce. Very tasty with these tweaks.

I added some red peppers and he came down awesome. Next time I would add a little bit of olive oil while cooking the rice noodles to help them separate.

I'm not really liking this recipe. The vermicelli turned out bland and dry and just not good to taste on the mouth. When I read the recipe, I'd thought that it would turn out great, but now I just have bland noodles that I can't even bring myself to eat. Wish I'd read the reviews better :(

This recipe was OK. It had great flavor and I loved the simplicity of it, but there is way too much spice. I would have said half of a teaspoon, not a tablespoon of chili sauce.

This recipe is amazing! I made it twice now, the second time was definitely better. I also used some sesame seeds and a splash of bbq sauce and a big clove of garlic. It was great! I didn't have any chili sauce but the extra garlic made up for it.

New favorite base for quick stir-fry weeknight dinners! I doubled the garlic, added some ground ginger, and probably used a bit more soy sauce than the recipe stated. It definitely did not lack flavor! If it's bland remember your salt and pepper. I didn't have green onions, but garnished with sesame seeds. It was a big hit in my house and will for sure make it again.

this is a good base to start with, but is bland.  add some protein, or veggies, or both.  ginger works too.  be playful.  i like spice so i added more chili sauce.  

but it is very easy, and very fast, which makes it super convenient.  then just add a little and make it your own to be an actual dish.

This was the perfect side for the spicy chicken dish I had made.  The only change I made was to substitute Sesame oil for the vegetable oil.  I love that it works up quick too.

An excellent base recipe.  I tripled the soy sauce, chili sauce and garlic.  I also added fresh ginger and toasted sesame oil.  I then added....whatever I had in the fridge.  Carrots, broccoli, cilantro.  Oh, and I also added a bit of scrambled egg.   Watch the cooking time on the noodles though.  They can get mushy very quickly.

This is yummy, but I did make the changes that were suggested by other reviewers.
I used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil, and I added fresh ginger, grated carrots and snap peas.  I also doubled the sauce.  We had it as a side dish, but it would be really good with shrimp or chicken added too.
REALLY easy to make - will make it again.

Thank goodness for the person who recommended adding ginger.  This really was amazingly bland when I made it exactly according to the recipe, but a little ginger and a LOT more garlic later, and I have a tasty lunch.

I tried this recipe in order to learn how to properly cook vermicelli noodles.  Perhaps the author did not use authentic vermicelli noodles in this recipe, as 4-5 minutes in boiling water turns them to a mushy paste.

Loved it! Adults and children. Did only add the chili sauce to the adults, as mine was very spicy, but we loved it added in or without. I also added stirfry frozen veggies. Awesome & so easy!

I have to rate this a three star based on the original recipe.  I really had to Dr. this one up to make it five star.  I made to go with slippery shrimp (VERY GOOD) from this site.  I added sesame oil and had to almost “fry” to get the right consistency.  I also had to add a lot of soy sauce cus it was really bland.  I also added a bag of stir fry veggies as I was making it a side dish.  Loved the heat that was in it and went quite well with the spicy sweet shrimp I made with it.  If it was not for me doubling the sauce of the slippery shrimp, so I could mix with this dish, I would never make it again…it really helped…All in all, thanks for the recipe as it was my first try with rice noodles..\

Bland but good.  Will make again but as suggested by another user, I'll probably double the sauce.  And perhaps try a few alternatives.  All in all, a good basic recipe with potential.

These were easy and yummy. I didn't boil my noodles but soaked as directed on the package. I would also double the sauce to get enough flavor in the noodles. I added some ginger paste and some cilantro to the sauce. I put some red pepper and mushrooms that I needed to use up in them also. I would make these again to use up veggies out of the fridge it is a great alternative to the "clean out the fridge" fried rice!

Great recipe. It was very easy. I used curry powder and omitted the green onions altogether because I topped with stir fried veggies and shrimps. It was DEElicious! My husband said it was my best dish yet. I also doubled the soy sauce and used garlic powder in addition to the garlic clove.

This was really good with some modifications.  I added ginger, sesame oil, and LOTS of veggies (broccoli, carrots, red bell pepper, cabbage).  You definitely need to at least double the sauce as people said in earlier reviews.  I will definitely make this again!

I added some minced ginger to the sauce, used about 1/2 sesame oil and 1/2 vegetable oil and doubled the garlic to give it a bit more flavor.  I also doubled the sauce and used 1/2 to saute diced chicken breasts, broccoli and carrots and then the other 1/2 for the noodles.  Pan fried the noodles until crispy and then topped with the chicken and veggies.  This is a great dish that is not bland as some have noted, but rather a light one.  Thanks for sharing!

LOVE this recipe!!! It is so quick and easy, and it is delicious!! Taking the suggestions of others, I doubled the garlic, chile sauce, and soy sauce. I omitted the green peppers. I was looking for an easy noodle dish with Asian flare, and this is it!! My advice is to mix the chile sauce, soy sauce, and salt/pepper with the noodles in a large mixing bowl. Even with my largest skillet, there wasn't enough room. Also be prepared for this recipe to yield a HUGE amount of noodles. I had leftovers for days, but they were still good!

I skipped the chili sauce because I had none, and it was srill delicious. Is the chili sauce the kind that looks like catsup or is it a special Chinese ingredient?

I initially made a mistake because my Melissa's Chinese Noodles was 16 oz not 8 oz, and they were wheat flour with egg not rice!  

Like other reviewers, I added ginger and sesame oil, plus some veges I had on hand- slivered onion, button mushrooms and a yellow squash cleverly grated to increase veg consumption.  For the chili I used Siracha and some Szechwan peppercorns and tried to minimize the oil while still being able to keep everything from sticking.

I topped the finished dish with minced cilantro, green onion and peanuts.

I thought it was just right, but my daughter's lips were tingling from the heavy dose of chilies.

This is fast and easy to modify to your taste and what is in your crisper.

Great recipe!  I added a few things-sesame oil, a scrambled egg, chopped roasted peanuts, and some cilantro.  Granted, it made it more Vietnamese, but it was delicious!

The best, because it is one of those ultra simple and delicious dishes.  The only change I made was to add 1/4 cup of minced yellow onion to the garlic as I was out of long green onions.

I thought that this would be a great side dish, but it turned out incredibly bland.  It might be okay if you put some beef or chicken on top of it.
