Sooo goooood!! I literally JUST posted this recipe on here as well after finding a similar one a different site. I brought these last night to a picnic and they were a hit! There were none left and I made about 50 of them! I bought everything from Trader Joes-a pack of basil, sweet cherry tomatoes, and mozzarella  balls that came in a container with an olive oil/herb marinade. I assembled these like this picture and since the balls were already in a marinade I just spooned a tiny bit of the marinade left in the container over the entire plate! Then I sprinkled a tiny bit of salt and cracked pepper. Also, I used the rest of the basil to cover the plate before arranging these. It's a beautiful presentation! A must have for parties, picnics, wherever!!

I used Ciliegine Mozzarella (the smallest fresh mozzarella balls) but I wish I had been more concerned w/ the quality of the mozzarella instead of the size. The brand I chose was completely flavorless. I can halve a bigger ball but it's hard to add flavor to flavorless mozzarella. ;o) Like so many reviewers, I used the vinegar & oil as a marinade instead of as a dip. Don't skimp on the salt! I think next time I'll either put a little bowl of salt out, to roll the tomatoes in  or I'll serve the bites on a bed of kosher salt. Great appetizer for a fettucine alfredo dinner...thanks! SiNsGirl's pic is superb so I saved myself the embarassment of posting a pic. LOL Great job,  SiNsGirl!

If you only use 1/2 grape tomato, basil leaf, & 1/2 mozzarella ball on a toothpick, you have a 1 bite snack!  Yummy!

I served these at an appetizer party and everyone thought they were really cute and tasty.

Instead of using the balsamic vinegar as a dip, I drizzled it on top of the bites with some zesty italian dressing and dried herbs. Turned out great.

I, too, used the oil and vinegar as a marinade and found these to be a very easy, tasty appetizer.  Since I don't like salty food, I orginally didn't add much salt, but upped the amount after reading the review by IMVINTAGE.  It made a huge difference in the flavor. Heavenly!

Very easy to make, I had my daughter put them together. I did purchase the fresh mozzarella in the dairy section and cut it into 1/2 in cubes, the fresh mozzarella mini balls were a little pricey. I also just purchased a bottle balsalmic vinagrette and marinated the bites in that. Tasted like bruchetta without the bread!

This was really good!  I used the marinated braid from Trader Joes, just unbraided it and cut in chunks.  It made about 40 of them.  I poured the whole thing of evoo and balsomic vinegar over the top and just poured it off before I plated it (30min later), next time I think I will make far less of it and drizzle it over them after I plate them.

Cute and creative idea to refashion Caprese salad!  Hubs and I had a light dinner tonight that basically needed a little garnish and color.  This was perfect.  However, I'm a purist when it comes to Caprese so the vinegar was not for me.  Just drizzled the little skewers with olive oil, garnished our dinner plates with them and instantly added great flavor and color to our dinner.  (If you've never had bocconcini, do seek them out and give them a try! They're fresh, white and kind of spongy, and you'll usually finding them packed in their own brine of whey and water)

I've taken this to three functions in the past month and each time it is a huge hit! Fresh ingredients are a must, no substitutions. People are astonished at how easy this is.

I make this all the time and it's always a hit.  If I take it to a party, I never have any left to bring home.   The only change I make is instead of mixing the balsamic vinegar and olive oil, I use Wish Bone's Salad Spritzers (spray salad dressing) in the Balsamic Breeze flavor.  I spray it over all of the appetizers and let it sit a few minutes before putting out.  It gives it such a good flavor and is not as messy.

These are wonderful! I like to drizzle the sauce over the the finished tomatoes and cheese.  Then I sprinkled them with McCormick's Mediterranean Spiced Sea Salt. This is a fantastic blend of sea salt with garlic, basil and oregano. It really added a gourmet touch!  Look for it with the other spices; it comes in a round can about 2 inches tall.

Very pretty!  However, the cheese started drying out very quickly after I set the tray out.  It tasted much better when I started making them than when they actually were eaten just about an hour later.

This is a great easy recipe.  For the reviewers that state there is little taste and to make sure you use salt. Fresh Mozzarella - regardless of the size of the ball is made without salt...if you want the salt, then use packaged mozzarella like you would find in the dairy department that is packaged into squares.  This was very delicious and easy to make.  Would make again, making sure to marinate everything together for a couple of hours.

I wasn't sure what to expect when I made these, but they are wonderful!  I made them for a cook-out over the weekend and they were gone in no time.  I used cherry tomatoes, cut in half,  fresh basil, and marinated mozzarella balls.  The marinated cheese was delicious.  I place them on skewers and salt and peppered them.  I then took the marinade from the mozzarella and added some balsamic vinegar and used that for dipping.  A perfect appetizer for a hot day.

If I could rate these higher, I would - so simple and easy to make but people are always blown away by them.  The least experienced cook could make them and people would think they are a kitchen superstar.  I use grape tomatos cut in half, and the small fresh mozzerella balls - they are easy to find at Sam's normally, and way cheaper there than I've seen anywhere else.  I also like to add a little garlic, fresh pepper and sea salt, and marinate the assembled "bites" in the dip, rather than serve them seperately.  These keep and travel pretty well, so they are easy to take to a buffet.

I doubled the recipe to take to a party and it disappeared in minutes!  I used Trader Joes marinated mini mozzerella balls and drizzled the marinade over the finished product.  The toothpicks were too small and squished the tomato and cheese so I used a small skewer (5-6") and that gave ample room to grab the app without getting fingers greasy.  Great presentation and wonderful taste!

This is a great appetizer!  It went out in a flash.  The basil was just the right touch and it wasn't too strong as I initially thought it would be.  I was skeptical that everything would fit on a regular toothpick, but they did and the plate looked so appealing with the red and green.  As some suggested, I drizzled a balsamic vinegar reduction (I just heated the vinegar it on low until it became syrupy) on it and that added to the flavor.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I made these for a birthday party this past weekend and everyone loved them! The best part--they are so simple to put together.  I bought the marinated mozzarella balls and tomatoes from SAMS Club and had thai basil on hand so it took no time to assemble. Once assembled, I lightly sprinkled with some kosher salt and done.  Such a fabulous idea!

These are ALWAYS a hit when I make them.  I am always asked for the recipe and most people are shocked at how easy these are to make.  So much better than the traditional tomato and mozzarella which must be eaten with a fork and knife.  I have never needed the dipping sauce - I put the marinade over the bites and let it marinate overnight.  When the balsamic and oil absorbs into the bites - it's that much more heavenly.  Try it and see - you won't be disappointed!

You can't get any easier than this. I used a balsamic glaze versus the vinegar and it was very good. Keeper!

A terrific appetizer!  Took to my grandson's birthday party where they were serving subs, and everyone liked them.  Such a pretty presentation, too!!  My grocery store didn't have fresh basil so I subbed baby spinach and used basil-infused olive oil.  We loved it.

Yes -- this is good...Marinated the cheese, tomato and basil in the oil/balsamic for about 20 minutes and then put them together...Some people even requested a dipping bowl on the side for some additional flavour!

So yummy and healthy! I cut the mozzarella balls in half and tore the basil leaves into decently large pieces. Although they take a while to piece together, they were a hit at a Christmas party -- hence the red, white & green! I could eat these all day long!

Delicious! I used mozzarella pearls from Wal-Mart, and it was great. I drizzled the oil and vinegar mixture over them. I will definitely make them again.

I let the mozzarella marinate in the sauce, sprinkled with salt and pepper. YUMMY! If it wasn't for the fact that they were for a potluck, I would have easily eaten the whole thing :0)

My boyfriend made these for a little BBQ we attended. Everybody liked them. I think they should marinate in the oil just a bit, or possibly use the tiniest tomatoes as possible so that they don't steal the spotlight. As another user suggested, I used TJ's marinated mozzarella balls, then poured the leftover oil over each skewer bite. Our friends said they tasted like, "fresh pizza!" Never had caprese, I'll assume :)

Taste was good and it made an attractive presentation, but the dipping sauce was messy and a nuisance. I think next time I would drizzle it over the tomatoes etc. on the plate before serving.

Drizzled some balsamic vinegar over it.  I love them and they last in the fridge for a couple days.  Perfect thing to bring to a summer BBQ.

I made this appetizer for a party and it was a hit.  I made my own balsamic vinaigrette with 2 cloves crushed garlic, 1/2 tsp salt mashed together with garlic, add 3 tbl balsamic vinegar and wisk in 1/2 cup olive oil. Drizzle over tomato and mozzarella and leave extra for dipping. YUM!

I loved these, but we edited the recipe and didn't use the balsamic. Used marinated mozz balls and s&p. That's all they needed. It was so easy to assemble, and they looked really pretty piled on the platter. Perfect little appetizer.

Great. Marinated the bocconcini for a couple of hours in olive oil, balsamic vinegar, chilis, basil, italian seasoning, garlic powder. Used bigger sticks instead of toothpicks. Everyone loved them.

These are so tasty and easy to make! After assembling them (I use a single tomato per toothpick, and keep it whole), I drizzle the batch with good quality olive oil and sprinkle with salt and freshly ground pepper. This is one of my go-to appetizers!

This is a really great way to eat tomato & mozzarella! However, it is more time consuming than simply making a caprese salad. With that said, if you are looking for finger food you cannot go wrong with these - cute presentation and so yummy!

I have made these for a new house, open house but was worried about them being too messy or dripping the dressing on new floors so I used a balsamic vinegar reduction(the balsamic gets thick and very potent)inside a ziploc baggie with a tiny hole in the corner and just put a few drops onto the bite.  Very elegant and no dripping when you serve them. Worked out awesome, yes a little putsy, I just dotted the balsamic on right before I set the tray out.

Yum! I suggest using fresh mozzarella, if available. I didn't plan on making this and had to settle for a block of mozzarella, which I cut into cubes. If I make this again, I'll marinate the cubes (from the block) for a little bit first (at least a couple hours). I don't think you would want to marinate the fresh mozzarella balls that long- fresh quickly absorbs balsamic vinegar. Also, be quite liberal on the salt and pepper.

I actaully tried to submit my own similar recipe onto this site - not knowing that this one esxisted. I do agree that fresh mozzarella is ideal, but can be quite pricey. What I do is by the blocks of Polly-O brand mozzarella (which I cut into cubes). It tastes SO much like the fresh balls, but half the cost. I place the tomato on top of this, then drizzle with extra virgin olive oil. I have never added the balsamic, but I'm sure it is good. And, after finding that the fresh basil was too much of a hastle (it rips easily once on the toothpick), I simply sprinkle all of the 'kabobs' with dried basil. Everyone always loves these things. One word of advice: if you are going to refrigerate these, let them sit out a while before eating. If they are too cold, the olive oil is a little 'funky' tasting and goopy. But, I wouldn't think you would have left overs to refrigerate - they'll be gone before you know it!! :D

These were a simple but elegant addition to a plate of small bites for a tea party.  I used the marinated mozzarella from Trader Joe's, and poured the liquid over the assembled skewers in place of the balsamic/olive oil mixture. Very easy and very popular!

I had these at a pals grand opening and I was blown away! She didn't use the dipping idea though. She just drizzled it with the oil and vinegar and I thought that was a wise choice.  The fewer things out in a large party like that the better.

I made these for a cookout last weekend and they were devoured.  I sprinkled course sea salt on the dish and then arranged the skewers on top of the salt.  Then I drizzled the dipping sauce over the entire plate.  These are so delish!  I'm making them again this weekend for a baby shower.  Don't skimp on the good mozarella!  It's worth it!   Thanks for the great recipe.

These were a hit at our Memorial Day picnic.  I used Polly o string cheese, cut into 1 inch pieces to cut back on cost. I made around 70 of these & they did not dry out or turn brown. I did marinate them over night & left out an hour or so before serving so the olive oil would not be so thick.  Everyone loved them. I will be making again. Thanks for a great recipe.

Wonderful appetizers.  Easy and delicious.  Made these for Thanksgiving and were hit.   I like this twist on traditional mozzarella and tomato I first had with Beefsteak tomatoes and a chunk of mozzarella and basil drizzled in balsamic vingegar.  I usedthe marinated mozzarella balls from Sam's Club.  Though it didn't call for cooking, I placed the assembled tomato and cheese in a warm chafing dish.  By the time I completed the remainder of my dishes, the cheese had melted slightly. None were left.  like this twist on traditional mozzarella and tomato I first had with Beefsteak tomatoes and a chunk of mozzarella and basil drizzled in balsamic vingegar. I make those for the fam, these bites are great for entertaining.

These were okay. I like a little more spice. The mozzarella I used was good, but overpowered the spices. I found they were a little better the next day.

These are perfect little appetizers to take to a party or serve at your own. Since some people don't love basil like I do, I ground up fresh basil-it has more flavor than the dried basil, but the dried basil will work in a pinch-and added it to the oil and vinegar which I drizzled over the plate just before the guests arrived. They disappeared faster than I could replace them! I also lined the plate with slices of baguettes and had the server with the oil/vinegar/basil so that they could sop up their leftovers or use as a dipping sauce!

This got lots of rave reviews from our family. Instead of the balsamic vinegar, I made Penzey's Italian dressing and drizzled over the plate of bites. A great appetizer that doesn't feel so "heavy."

So easy and tasty!  I made them a few hours ahead, then when the party started, drizzled oil and vinegar and shook sea salt on top.  It's like salad on a stick.  Bet summer tomatoes would rock! Thanks for the idea.

Great idea! Thank you for sharing. We love tomato mozzarella salad.  These were perfect little bite size finger food for our cookout. They disappeared fast. Next time I will make the garlic olive oil dipping sauce for some extra flavor.

I made these as a side dish and everyone really enjoyed them. However, I did not have mozzarella chesse so I used cubed munster chess. I also used about 1/4 of a basil leaf in place of a full leaf. I found that the full leaf was too powerful of a taste and took away from the dish.

Everyone at our party loved these. I did not, however, closely follow the recipe. I had every intention of doing so and even bought the necessary ingredients. But I also bought marinated mozzarella bars as did many other reviewers. The marinade in the tub of marinated mozzarella bars was delicious so, in the end, I decided to just lightly drizzle that over the bites instead of make my own. Wonderful, easy idea and beautiful presentation, thanks!

This was a winner with the four little guinea pigs next door who had previously come only as close to eating tomatoes as ketchup.  It's a very attractive dish and the kids liked the little plastic sword picks I served them on.  I drizzled with balsamic glaze.  I will make this again often.

I had a holiday dinner party last night and this was one of the apps I served...what a hit! I highly recommend using marinated mozz balls (got mine at Costco) and use the whole ball. It would not have been as tasty with just plain mozz balls. Instead of the dipping sauce, just sprinkle balsalmic vinegar on the finished platter before serving. I did not sprinkle cheese on top...seemed like it would be overkill. The marinated mozz balls did the trick! The only other thing I would recommend is make extra...25 for 10 people was not enough...plan on each person eating four of them (so make 40 for 10 people)!

Everyone loved these!  The key is the fresh mozzerella balls so creamy and soft.  Yum!  Easy to prepare and serve also you don't have worry about presentation because they are pretty on their own.  I did not serve the dipping sauce.  Instead drizzled a little over them right before serving.  Will make again and again!  Thanks for such an easy and great recipe.

Wonderful and an absolutely gorgeous presentation! It was hard not to just pop each of these beauties into my mouth as I assembled it! I drizzled the vinegar and oil over the bites on the serving plate because I was trying to conserve on my good balsamic and olive oil, it took less to do it that way than to have enough for dipping. However, I think dipping one at a time would be better, so I'll do it that way next time.

Yum!  Easy and delicious.  I put a little chopped basil and some salt and pepper into the vinegar and oil mixture.  I think bottled balsamic vinaigrette would be good as a dipping sauce too.

Love this recipe! Made only a few minor changes: instead of toothpicks I had my husband cut some wooden skewers into approx 4" lengths. Skewer a small mozzarella ball (or a piece of a cut-up larger ball) first. Follow with a small leaf of basil (or a piece of a larger leaf. Finish with a half a cherry tomato with the cut side down. Instead of the O&V, I use balsamic glaze (Sophia's comes in a squirt top plastic bottle). I drizzle the glaze back and forth over a large white china platter and stand the skewers on it, evenly spaced. The cut tomatoes provide a stable base. You can sprinkle with a little sea salt and fresh cracked pepper then cover with some plastic wrap to keep from drying out. Using half a tomato and small ball of mozz makes this a one bite app - easier to manage and less messy than a longer skewer with multiple tomatoes, cheese etc. The colors pop and it all looks a bit more gourmet - a huge hit whenever I make it - and a healthy alternative to chips and dip etc.

My book club group loved this.

Here are my modifications:
1.  I marinated the cheese balls in the olive oil (my grocery store carries a combo of olive oil, grape seed oil and canola oil) along with some citrus/basil garlic spice (from Pampered Chef) for a couple of hours.
2.  Then afterward I put the rest together on the skewers. I did cut a couple of the cheese balls in half so I had enough to go with the tomatoes.
3.  Poured some more olive oil and the spice over the top of the skewers when I served them.

Served for my book club meeting and everyone loved this.

I made these when company was coming, only problem I didn't have any Mozzarella balls, I took a package of shredded Mozzarella 1/4 pack of fresh shredded Parmesan cheese, nuked it a few seconds in the microwave stirred it into one large ball and cut small pieces and assembled it the same way. Everyone said it tasted much better than the way they made them and wanted to know how or what brand I used.

Really enjoyed these.  I added watermelon.  Takes a bit of time to assemble.  Did the watermelon and the cheese the day before then added the basil and tomato before serving.  Had cut the tomatoes in half and were soaking cut side down in balsamic vinaigrette overnight.  Added pepper on the non-presentation side and salted the up side.  Big hit-

This is a great idea for a different way to serve tomato and mozzarella.  I made these tonight for my husband to snack on while I finished making dinner and I was amazed at how quickly they disappeared!  Will definitely make again.  Also a great and simple appetizer to serve when you want to stay with bite size dishes that do not require tableware.  Thank you for the great idea!

Made for 1st time for a cook-out.  All were gone in no time.  Several people commented how good they were.  Used very fresh ingredients, marinated mozzarella, and added sliced pepperoni.  For dressing I used 1/2 balsamic and 1/2 apple cider...yummy!!!!

I like the presention  on this recipe. I make a similar salad using flavored olive oil (or plain if that;s all the olive oil I have on hand) and put  in a clear  glass bowl. Always makes a great presentation and couldn't be simiplier.

These weren't a hit a our party. Alot of the party guests didn't enjoy the basil and those that were eating them seemed to be pulling the basil off! No one thought the dipping sauce was very interesting and it went mostly unused. Don't know that I would put forth the effort again with the results I got but for what its worth I enjoyed them.

Very fun and different appetizer!  Before making for a party, I tried a few with mozzarella marinaded in the balsamic mixture and a few as written.  We definitely preferred the marinaded ones.

These were so great! They went so quick I wished I had made more! I just used zesty Italian dressing and I marinated the mozzerella instead of pouring it over them. Then I just put some dressing on the side. They were so deliciuos.

I went looking for a "different" idea for an appetizer to take to a progressive dinner. So glad I found this. Everyone raved about them and they are so simple. I did cheat and bought a bottle of balsamic vinaigrette dressing, though. It worked perfect. LOVED the fresh basil. I'd never bought it fresh before and am now in love!

makes a beautiful presentation, and goes fast.  But lacks something in taste.  I used the Trader Joe's marinated mozzarella balls, and it still was quite mild.

This was ok, but it REALLY depends on the mozzarella used. I'd give it more stars except when everyone has a modified version of a recipe to make it work, then the recipe itself isn't 5 stars.

I was looking for a recipe to use up my cherry tomatoes and fresh herbs from my garden....and this one hit the spot! Husband LOVED them too! Next time I will use garlic sea salt OR garlic salt w/parsley for more flavor. I definitely think adding garlic in some form would make this even more delicious! Use extra salt, and definitely drizzle marinade over top instead of serving alongside the dish. I am going to make this all the time now!

When I saw this recipe I knew I must make it!  I love fresh mozzerella salad and I thought the bite size idea was great!  I forgot my toothpicks though so I had to plate it.  It was still very tasty and so pretty!  I did not add vinegar or pepper due t personal preference.  I will certainly make this again and again!

Brought this to a bbq and got tons of raves. I tried to put them away a few times to clear up space for the main meal, but was attacked by friends who wanted me to leave them out.  I also marinated the cheese a bit.  Made my first balsamic reduction to drizzle over the top and I'm hooked.  These were beautiful, too.

An easy and tasty appetizer that goes together quickly and looks lovely. I marinated the bocconcini in balsamic vinaigrette for a few hours before assembling the bites, and this worked well. This is a very light appetizer, which is good because it doesn't spoil your dinner. If you are planning on a long cocktail hour before dinner, though, serve something else along with it because your guests will be tipsy. Thanks!

Initially there wasn't a lot of flavour to these but after sitting in the balsamic dressing for awhile, they became tastier.

This is the best.  It is very easy to make and very YUMMY!  We made this as one of the food items for my 30th b-day and everyone LOVED it.  We used fresh spinach leaves instead of the basil leaves.  It was so yummy, fresh tasting, they didn't last long.  We will definately make this again for our next party!

I served these as one of my appetizers for Easter dinner.  The presentation was absolutely beautiful and the taste was out of this world!  I used the marinated mozzarella cheese from Trader Joe's which gave such a nice taste to the recipe.  I also served the balsamic vinegar/olive oil on the side as a dipping sauce.  I will be serving this recipe again and again and again.  YUM!

These were great, I used the trader joes marinated mozz like others suggested and drizzled them with baslamic & oil.  The salt is crucial in bringing out the flavor.

When I saw the photos of this recipe, I thought "why didn't I ever think of this?"  What a great idea - so pretty and colorful.  It's a wonderful for parties.  I used marinated mozzarella balls and drizzled with a little balsamic vinegar.   The leaves on the basil I used were quite large so I would jst tear the basil leaf in half to get an appropriate size.  Easy and elegant.

Yummy! The perfect bite for a party app. I drizzled with balsalmic vinegar just before serving as well as a little salt and fresh cracked pepper.

This recipe looks really attractive on a platter.  To make it taste as good as it looks be sure to drizzle some homemade balsamic vinaigrette over the top.

Modern twist to an italian classic... I used cherry vine tomatoes, whole, and pearly mozzarella, also whole. I ordered them neatly on  plate then drizzled olive oil over. I think if you have great ingredients you don't need any of the extra stuff...

If you live near Trader Joe's for sure take the advice of another reviewer and get their already marinaded Mozzarella Cheese balls.   You can even cut the balls in half and double the amount you get!  Very cost efficient!

Wow, these are so good! Like cookiequeen, I just drizzled the vinegar and oil over the "bites" rather than making a dip on the side. I cut mozzarella cheese sticks into little squares since I couldn't find boccicini. For a quick little appetizer, these are super easy and really tasty!

I took these to a Kentucky Derby party last night. They made an attractive appetizer. I used a balsamic garlic blend for dipping,  a mix of different cheeses,  and people really loved it. This is something I will make again.

Have served these 3 times- twice to the same people and they all gave them rave reviews. I dont' think I know of a prettier appetizer. Don't worry about the size of the mozzarella, just cut the size piece you want. I like to use grape tomatoes and just drizzle the olive oil and balsamic vinegar over the assembled picks. Several generous twists of sea salt and pepper complete the dish. I've never had leftovers.

I prepared this for a work Italian luncheon and it went great.  I couldn't find descent grape or cherry tomatoes, so I used sliced Romas.  A little messier than dealing with grape or cherry tomatoes, but propably better flavor.  Everyone loved them and asked for the recipe. According to one Italian co-worker in some regions they put them under the broiler to lightly melt the cheese.

I thought these were terrific.  Like another reviewer, I bought Trader Joe's marinated mozzarella balls so I didn't need to make the dressing.  I also added a small piece of salted pork (thick bacon) to the mix.  It gave it additional flavor, crunch and saltiness that my guests really enjoyed.  I put half a tomato & half a mozzarella ball with a small basil & the bacon on a tooth pick. Made a great small bite!

Turned out very good.  I made these for a Halloween Party and everyone loved them.  I used cherry tomatoes, mozzarella balls and sprinkled basil with a little salt and pepper on top.  I did not have basil leaves so I just used what I had in my spice cabinet.  They all turned out very good and the display was eye catching.  Thanks for a great appetizer.

Easy to do.  Used already marinated in pesto mozzarella balls.  Omitted the vinegar. Drizzled oil salt and pepper over assembled dish and it was a delightfully refreshing appetizer for Memorial Holiday.  Colorful too.

I made this for a birthday party and they were a hit!  Costco has a container of small mozzarella balls in marinade so I drained the marinade off and went on with the recipe.  Very simple and very pretty.  If the cherry or grape tomatoes are too large, which some of mine were, just cut them in half and put the cut side against the basil.

I don' like to change a recipe and then rate it but all I changed was the technique and not the ingredients. I wanted to use this as more of a salad so I cut the tomatoes in half and then in very thin slices and then threw in some bocconccini balls that I cut in half. I didn't have fresh basil so I just used my freeze dried stuff and sprinkled it on top of the tomatoes and cheese. I mixed up the dressing and poured some of it over and gently mixed it just a few minutes before serving it. Yummy. The dressing and basil are what make this delicious. I would use grape or cherry tomatoes if I had them next time. I love how versatile this recipe is. It can be an appetizer or a salad.

Fantastic without changes, although I prefer to sprinkle the oil and vinegar over the skewered cheese and tomatoes so they can absorb the flavor before serving. When you are in a real hurry, you can toss all the ingredients in a bowl for a "spoon it up" salad. The toothpick presentation is great, though.

Super easy and a big hit both times I've brought these to parties!  People loved the presentation of it and it's easy to munch on while standing around.  The second time I made them, I used another reviewer's idea to use extra basil leaves as garnish on the serving plate.  It looked very festive!

This recipe was the perfect choice for a simple appetizer before dinner. I liked the fact that people were not filling up on chips/bread/dip but rather something healthy and delicious. Will definitely make this one again - thank you!

I have made this for years along with my Grandson.
We have special toothpicks and add a slice of salami folded between the mozzarella and the tomato.

Balsamic dressing is served with it.

I would rate 4 as is. 

Always a hit and recipe asked for.

Yum, simple healthy & delish! Homegrown cherry tomatoes and basil, what can be better? I didn't have the ball type mozz, but I did have fresh. I used white balsamic & just dumped the mixture on top. So, so good!

These tasted okay, but they did not look appetizing.  The red from the tomatoes ran onto the mozzarella.

what a great recipe.  It does take time to put together but it is so easy, tastes great, looks great, and my guests were fans.  I took the advice of previous reviewers and went to trader joe's, got the mozzarella balls, cut in half, and then used half a grape tomato, half mozzarella ball, leaf of basil, and half a tomato on a toothpick, with balsamic vinegar and olive oil drizzled over.

I love vineger or sauces with "zing". This appetizer looks great on just about any plate. TIP - grab the first couple of people that walk bye (kids will think it is fun) and get a mini-assembly line going, prep time is now just 5 minutes.

So Good!  I used marinated moz from the deli in my grocery store and I drizzled the dressing over them on a tray then I sprinkled them with a little more salt.  They looked so pretty and tasted so great!  Thanks!

Beautiful presentation and easy!  I arranged them on a nice plate with black patterned trim.  It looked so colorful, like a piece of art!  I drizzled the balsamic mixture over the entire plate, especially the mozz. balls to soak flavore in.

I couldn't believe how good these tasted.  It was so easy, and made a nice, simple, elegant appetizer. I added italian seasoning to the oil and vinegar and drizzled it over the appetizers. I also bought a large ball of fresh mozzarella and cut it into chunks rather than using the small mozz balls.  It made a very nice presentation as well.  Will definitely be doing this one often.  Thanks for the post!

These were pretty good. I do recommend that you use a flavored mozzarella. I used a smoked one and it tasted so much better than when I used the plain. Pretty on a plate and received pretty good reviews from those I served it too. Thanks.

I ate Caprese Salad almost every day the month I traveled in Italy. That experience taught me that tomatoes are meant to be much tastier than the bland version we find in American supermarkets.   This is basically a Caprese Salad but made into bite sized pieces.  It's a great idea although I must say I didn't find it as awesome as I thought it was going to be.  However, one of my friends really thought it was great.    I used the already marinated mozzarella balls from Trader Joe's and I still made the balsamic vinegar dipping sauce in the recipe as a side.  We used the dip and it was quite tasty.  Next time I will use more salt.  I don't think I used enough and that likely affected the outcome/overall taste.

Simple. Pretty. A tasty appetizer. I served them upright (shave a little off the bottom of the tomato if the skewer won't stand up) on a platter, drizzled with the oil & vinegar. Rave reviews from guests.

Amazingly easy and amazingly good!  I skipped the salt and didn't miss it -- even though some reviewers felt they wanted more salt, I think all the fresh ingredients and the balsamic vinegar are plenty flavorful.  Also, I could not find the mozzarella balls, so I simply cubed a hunk of mozzarella instead.  Definitely a keeper!

I marinated these rather than drizzling or dipping. I think I marinated for too long, tomatoes were a little pruney. I would suggest an hour tops. Other than that, they were beautiful and tasty. Festive colors for a holiday party.

LOVED these :)  I used the marinated mozzarella and the basil "paste" that you can buy right next to the fresh herbs.  I definitely will go with the fresh leaves next time, because the paste was a little messy and definitely not as pretty, but the taste was still awesome.  These are a great idea and make a beautiful presentation.  Thanks!!

These were easy and good.  I think they would have been better if I had used better mozerella.  Two halves of cherry tomatoes were a lot for one bite.  Good idea though. Next time will only put one half of tomato and use better mozerella.

Soooo good! Everyone at our party loved these. They were very refreshing, instead of making the dip, I drizzled them with olive oil and sprinkled with salt and fresh cracked pepper....they looked amazing and so cute, a great presentation. Fresh basil is a must!

Small Mozz balls are my favorite and this is a great way to serve as a side dish or appetizer.   I buy the big container of them at costco to save alittle on money.  I string on skewers for a steadier hold and just snip the skewer in half once loaded.  One ball on a toothpick isn't enough for me :-)  I then drizzle the balsamic dressing over them-this way dipping isn't necessary(gets complicated and messy with guests). You could even add in a sliced piece of provolone.  YUMMY!   GREAT GREAT RECIPE!

These were tasty and easy to make.  I would suggest marinating the tomotoes and mozzarella balls for a few hours minimum in the dressing, rather than serving it as a dipping sauce. Next time I will probably add some oregano to the sauce. It seemed like it needed a little kick. It was still very good and went over well.

So darn good! This is a treat for us and it goes quickly. Costco sells balsamic glaze that is thicker and very good. Be very sure your tomatoes are good... 1 bad tomato & kids will never trust a tomato again. Lol

Made these for two gatherings.  The second I made one batch adding salami - they were a hit!  The only challenge is the dressing recipe makes too much, so I've scaled it down after the first time I made these.  A definite favorite addition to future gatherings!

Like the recipe. Made it to take to a pot luck and was popular. Rather than using olive oil and balsamic as a dip I prefer to make about half the quantity and drizzle over top

These are a bit time intensive but you can’t go wrong with the flavor combination. Omit the olive oil.

I drizzled evoo over the plate, sprinkled with dry Italian herbs, fresh ground black pepper and sea salt. Delicious and a big hit. I used an assortment of  tomatoes from my garden,  yellow pear, red pear, orange grape, red cherry, made for a very pretty presentation. This recipe is a keeper. Sorry I didn't take a photo

Make a balsamic reduction, which is fancy talk for cooking some of the moisture out of the vinegar. I thickens up and makes the kitchen smell amazing.  Drizzle that over your kabobs and you will think of heaven itself.

Great and easy . Make these right before your party so the basil will remain fresh and buy a bottle of balsamic glaze! Buy good quality mozzarella balls in liquid in a container . Delis hand easy! We make them all the time!

Absolutely delicious!!! I wanted to take something semi-healthy to a potluck where pizza was the main course and these fit perfectly. They were quick and easy to make and very colorful!  I used the idea of another reviewer who suggested using marinated mozzarella from Trader Joe's -- it was amazing! I also used the "marinade" from the mozzarella tub to dribble on top instead of just using olive oil!!! Yum!

My family loves this!  I did change a few things though...I added a teaspoon of diced garlic and substituted cilantro for the basil as I was fresh out of basil, whisked it together with olive oil and traditional balsamic reduction and it was soooo yummy!  I liked it better than the original version actually.  I also mixed the cherry tomatoes (uncut) together with the mozzarella balls in a bowl and poured the marinade over everything and refrigerated it for about an hour letting the mozzarella soak up the marinade.  Served as a side dish.  Delicious!!!

I followed the recipe nearly to the 'T'...I did not have the fresh basil, which was a concern, but I had dried basil. I made the appetizer itself first, then sprinkled it with the dried basil. As far as the 'dipping' sauce, I used a basting brush and brushed them lightly with the mixture. My company loved them! Thank you for the recipe!

Easy, elegant and tasty.  I make a balsamic reduction and drizzle over and on the side for dipping if desired.  Another staple to my holiday (and summer) parties.

I made these for a wedding, and they weren't horrible, but definitely seemed lacking in flavor. I've made them a few times since then, with a few changes that really made the flavors explode in your mouth. Grilling or roasting the tomatoes brings out a sweet, savory taste, and marinating the mozzarella (or buying it already marinated) adds more flavor.

I love this recipe. When the local store in my small town was out of basil I used Herbes de Provence (Frontier brand was excellent, Victoria Taylor's is great too). I make a little salad for myself using the mini bocconcini, halved cherry or grape tomatoes, olive oil, torn basil leaves or Herbes de Provence. After letting it sit for at least ten minutes I grind sea salt over it. Soooo good.

AWESOME! They were a huge hit.  I sell balsamic vinegar blends, infused olive oils, and sea salts -(city2shoregourmet.com) - so I served mine with pomegrante balsamic, basil olive oil topped with course Maine garlic sea salt!  Whoa . .

Like most people, I bought tomatoes, basil and mozzarella balls (already marinaded in oil/vinegar) from Trader Joe's. Halved everything and put them together with the toothpick and voila, you have a perfect side dish to any meal. I could eat these every day:)

This is a great appetizer.  When I make it I cut the cheese balls in half also.  I also mix some maple syrup in the balsamic vinegar - sounds weird, but try it.  I call it Caprese Salad on a Stick!

I used fresh tomatoes from the garden, yellow pear, different small red varieties and sweet tangerine.  The tomatoes that were a little bigger, I cut into quarters.   The contrast of yellow, orange and red tomatoes added to the visual appeal.  The fresh mozzerella came in medallions in water instead of balls, so I cut those in  half. I also used fresh basil from the garden.  What a fun and easy appetizer!

Made this for Easter appetizers.  They made a great presentation and the fresh basil leaves added a nice touch for color and flavor.  No one liked the dipping sauce however, but taste is subjective.  I will make this again but use a different dipping sauce and will marinate the mozz. as many suggest.

This recipe was a hit with my family at Thanksgiving! Even my fussy niece liked it. It was quick and easy to make. Wegmans, my supermarket, has these little mozzarella cheese balls available already marinated and I used those, which kicked the flavor up a notch.

I made these for a party and they are a beautiful appetizer - but the mozzarella balls lacked flavor, the mozzarella roll I usually buy has a much better flavor.  I will stick with sliced garden tomatoes and sliced mozzarella arranged with fresh basil on a plate, definitely use salt, pepper and a balsamic drizzle.

These looked fabulous on the plate.  It was good, but not as spectacular as I expected based on the reviews.  I wish I used marinated mozzarella -- maybe that would have made the difference.  Other than that, I don't think I will make this again.

Used garlic flavored red wine vinegar instead of balsamic. Added parmesan romano cheese and dry basil to vinegar oil mix. Used garlic salt instead of plain salt. Yummy...

This is a marvelous idea on a classic salad.  We love tomato mozzarella salad but when served this way it becomes a finger food.  Absolutely fantastic!

I am giving this 4 out of 5 stars because I really liked it, but I had a lot left over at my party.  I thought it would have been a bigger hit.  I also marinated them before I assembled them.  Next time, I'll follow the recipe.

I'm giving this 5 stars even though i changed it. Because it would be good either way. My store didn't have small mozz. so i used the marinated mozz balls from costco. Let tomatoes sit in marinade and then assembled. Went over great at my italian dinner party. Thanks for recipe

I used the marinated mozarella balls and  cut them into thirds, didn't do any marinating, and drizzled the finished bites with the herbed oil the cheese came in - yummy! Have made this several times in the last few weeks with our garden bounty. Thanks!!

I couldn't find bite sized mozzarella so I cut a ball of mozzarella into small chunks. This looks so pretty on the plate and the dipping sauce goes well with it. Many thanks.

What an awesome idea! It's beautiful! I make mozzarella and tomato appetizer often and was just looking around the website for new ideas. This one is great!
