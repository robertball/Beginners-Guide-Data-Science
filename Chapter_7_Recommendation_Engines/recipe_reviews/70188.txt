When I first made up this recipe and served it, my son called it monkey meat because it was made with beef which shredded into strings.  We've always thought of monkeys as stringy animals, and so the name stuck.  I hope this doesn't turn anyone off on trying this recipe.  It is kind of labor intensive at first, but the results are really and truly scrumptious!!!  Also, you can use a different roast - i've used shoulder clod roast, and chuck roast with delicious results.  Whatever's on sale at your butchers!!!   You can also substitute the peppers to whatever you can find at the store.

I starting looking for tri-tip recipes that didn't involve the grill and this recipe sounded interesting. My family loves Mexican food but are not fans of spicy, so I opted to omit the red chili pepper; and only used 1 jalapeno & 1 anaheim pepper (both seeded).  I also substituted the poblano with 1 tomatillo and the rest of the ingredients were followed exactly. It had enough flavor for my family (especially since I have 2 small ones) I seared the meat and sauteed the vegetables then placed them in the slow cooker with the beef broth and cooked it for several hours.  This made enough food for my family of 5 to have 3 separate meals from it. Tacos the 1st night, breakfast burritos with scrambled eggs the next morning, and then shredded beef burritos another night. Received rave reviews from everyone that tried it. I will definitely make this again!

This was very good.  Read all reviews and was surprised at how many do not use chili in fear of food being to hot.  If you buy mild chili it will take on the flavor of chili with out the heat and that is a flavor all should experiance. I buy about 10 to 15 pound of Hatch Chili every year seperate it and freeze.  i use all year long.  However I never combind several chilies like Pobalno and Jalapenos and only cook 20 min.  If you don't like heat make sure all seeds are removed then you get flavor not heat.  I think most important step is to Sear meat and  sauted all veggies before the mix.  After I mixed it I put in Crock Pot becaus I don't like to stand over the stove making sure nothing burns.. This was good amazing thing is you can substitue the meat for all cuts like Chicken, Pork even ground beef.  It will all turn out.  Mostly don't be afraid of heat get mild and it all works out. When making a stew or soup I use a cup to two cups in my dishes.  It really add a flavor that can not be duplicated.  Next time I am going to try adding chipotle chili in adobo sauce just a teaspoon to table spoon the rest of the can I will seperate and freeze in a baggies for other uses....I really think it would take this reciepe up a level or two.  Guess I will try it again and let you know.   ValerieRoman9@aol.com

Well, while the preparation for this recipe is indeed very labor intensive (so much chopping!), the recipe turned out very yummy.  These are my modifications: I omitted the celery and carrot, I couldn't find all of the different peppers required, and wound up having to use jalepeno and banana peppers, both with seeds.  Because of the lack of heat, I also tossed in a teaspoon of red pepper.  Also, two large onions seemed entirely too much for the dish (that, and both my fiance and myself are not huge fans of onions)-- I wound up only using about 2/3rds of a large Texas Super Sweet.  I cooked this in a slow cooker for about 4 hours on high.  I would, in the future, cook this on low probably all day so the meat would be more tender, although it was still good.  One last thing: I added a double shot of tequila to the mixture, although I really couldn't taste it.  Perhaps next time I will marinate the meat in tequila, along with the spice rub, overnight to liven things up.  In all, it was very good with an excellent combination of flavors-- I will make this dish again.  Thank you!

I was looking for a recipe to use up about 1lb of tri-tip that I had left over from a barbeque. It had been marinated in tamari, coarse mustard and fresh rosemary, then grilled. I came across this recipe, scaled it down for 4 servings. The changes I made-obviously didn't sear the meat, didn't add the red chili (personal taste)and probably used about 1 can of beef stock but followed the recipe after that. Served it with white rice, homemade guacamole, sour cream and cheese with wheat tortillas. It was fantastic!! My boyfriend ate so much, he barely left enough for MY lunch today!! The meat shredded beautifully and was very flavorful! A little spicey-but when paired with sour cream and guac, it cooled down very nicely. I will be using this for all my left over tri-tip! Thanks so much!

A funny name for such a yummy dinner!  You can cut down the prep time by using a large chopper.  I only used one of annaheim, one of the poblano, one can of jalapenos and 7 dried chilis.  The spice is nice as it adds flavor but doesn't overwhelm the dish as just hot.  I used a sirloin steak as it is what we had on hand.  Thank you for this recipe!

This is the third time I have made this.  It is the best mexican style shredded beef recipe I have found.  Very similar to my fav restaurant.  I never have the exact ingredients on hand but just sub something similar.  Always turns out great.  I use it for tacos, burritos and nachos.  Freezes well too.  Thank you for sharing it.

I really, really liked this recipe.  It is a lot of prep work, but well worth it.  After cooking, I like to serve with scrambled eggs & refried beans all wrapped up in a tortilla.  This is a keeper!

I made this for my church "dinner for 8" and it was wonderful. I was a little worried since there were so many spices in the recipe. I thought it was going to be to much but was very happy with the results. It's a good thing I didn't make it too hot since most of the group didn't like spicy foods. (just my husband and I) Thanks! K

OMG- I expected it to be good after reading the reviews, but it was incredibly flavorful and addicting.  I will be making this again and again.  I think next time I'll make some rice and beans and eat it all with naan bread!!!  My husband approved whole-heartedly also!

This. Is. Awesome. This is an absolutely fantastic recipe and I use it every time in the mood for some mexicanish shredded beef. It has a little kick to it, but if you're not into that, you can just serve it with less of the "sauce" that is created from cooking or cut back on some of the peppers before you cook it. It is a pretty flexible recipe. I've made it a little different each time, and it has worked out beautifully every time. Last time, I added some canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. I discarded the pepper and just used the sauce, and it added some nice flavor with out adding too much heat. Great for tacos, burritos, chili, etc!

My family LOVED this! Used chuck roast, 4 poblanos, 2 anaheim, 2/3 onion, 2 jalapenos. Omitted the carrots and celery. Added 1 can of diced tomatoes and 1 can of green chilis. At the end of cooking took out meat and thickened the sauce to make a mole. Delish!!

We've been making this several times a year for over 3 1/2 years now! We love the funny name too. It is simple yet so amazing! I don't even add all the exotic peppers when I can't get them fresh from our stores. We have used filet mignon and now use pork tenderloin as the meat. We also like to add small diced potatoes and canned roasted corn. You can mix it up and make it a little different every time, but it is sooo good and definitely one of our FAVORITES that we cycle through regularly. We have shared this dish with family and friends and now we get requests for it on birthdays and holidays! I can't believe there aren't more reviews of this dish here and I am so glad we found it so many years ago! I think most people look through the recipes and look for the highest number of reviews and stars. If we had done that all those years ago, we never would have found this dish and this dish deserves thousands more of good ratings.

I was looking for a recipe to use some peppers I had and I found this one. We put it on tortillas topped it with lettuce, sour cream, tomatoes, onions, cheese and guacamole! Froze some for later and we ate it all! Delicious! My fiance recently asked when I was going to make it again!
