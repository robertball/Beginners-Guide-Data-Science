Way to much chocolate!!  The first try was exactly as directed and had to be thrown out.  The second try was with half white chocolate chips and half chocolate chips.  Much better!!

I changed it up a bit so instead of chocolate it was just regular bread pudding, I omitted the choc. chips and the orange peel and did the rest as stated, I also added raisins and sprinkled cinnamon on it before baking. Very good and easy. Love how it held together well, making it more like bars. I did NOT make the caramel sauce it would have been overkill of sweetness IMO.
