This sauce was outstanding.  Im not a meat lover so i just used a couple packs of turkey sausage and deleted the ground beef and turkey.  I also added some mushrooms.  It was excellent.  Has a great taste.  My husband told me to never buy grocery store sauce again.

This recipe really exceeded my expectations. The flavor is great and my husband didn't notice the squash at all! (He HATES squash) I scaled the recipe for 6 servings with no problem & used zucchini instead of yellow squash. I also substituted turkey sausage that I had on hand for the kielbasa. It's a flexible recipe that you can make hours ahead, try it!

This "sauce" came out more like goulash, and I wouldn't make it again.

Considering the time this recipe takes to make, and the outcome (more like goulash and not quite spicy enough), I wouldn't make it again. Not bad, just not what I had expected.

So much work. So not worth it. Spaghetti Sauce should have some spice to it, this did not. Very disappointed.

Yummy!  For the meat requirements, I used 1/2 pound of ground turkey and 1 pound of Italian chicken sausage (instead of ground beef and kielbasa).  I used zucchini instead of yellow squash, and I added chopped celery.  I used fresh basil instead of dried, and freshly-ground pepper instead of whole peppercorns.  The tomato paste I used was pesto-flavored, and my can of tomato sauce was 15 ounces (instead of 10 ounces).  Also, I found 2 Tbsp. of olive oil to be plenty for cooking the vegetables.  All of this made a wonderful spaghetti sauce!

I have to say this sauce was tasty!!!  A great base recipe to modify to your own tastes.  I thought it was a little too chunky, but my husband thought it was perfect.  "More meat next time" is all he said.  Next time I will add pork ribs and chicken pieces.  Thank you Jeanne!

This was exactly what I needed. My mom used to make great spaghetti sauce in a crock pot, and I needed to know the basics to make a good sauce from scratch. This was fantastic! Tweak it and have fun with it, the basic seasonings and overall ingredients are a great start. I used less squash, added zucchini and olives and carrots. Mom's can't touch this!

This was really yummy!  I added more meat than the recipe called for so I needed to add some more tomato sauce.

Took too much time and effort to render this recipe into something my family would call 'spaghetti sauce.'  It gets a star for 1) being edible 2) using ingredients I had.  My final version turned out good; I employed my stick blender to smooth out about 80% of the vegetation.  I had to add more tomato product and a ton of spices (handfuls of dried spices).  Other than using up some squash I didn't want going to waste, this recipe was not worth the 6 hours invested.

Overall a good recipe but a bit bland, I added a few red pepper flakes but it still needed something more...I also used mushrooms instead of squash...I will make this again but will add some spice with kick to it.

This is terrific.  I made a vegetarian version and used it for Chicken Parmigiana last week and Stuffed Shells this week.  It also freezes beautifully.  Thanks, Jeanne!  I owe you one.

This sauce tasted great.  I served it at a party and everyone loved it.  There was little too much meat for my tast.  Next time I will cut out the kielbasa and add mushrooms.

I followed the recipe but used a jar of pasta sauce because I didn't have a can of tomato sauce. Also I added skinless chicken longanisa, which is a filipino breakfast meat for added flavor. Once the dish was complete, I added about 2 tablespoons of sugar to remove the acidic taste of the tomatoes. This sauce was good enough to eat without pasta. I'll definitely make this again.

I cut the recipe to 3 servings---more than enough for the two of us.  I pretty much followed the recipe except for using zucchini instead of yellow squash, Johnsonville Mild Italian Sausage rather than the ground beef, and red bell pepper rather than green.  I also simmered it on stovetop for about three hours rather than in a slowcooker.  This definitely got better with age, as most recipes like this do when flavors have a chance to meld.  The first night we had this over pasta, but several days later we had this over grilled hamburger patties.  We thought this was a good meal!  Thanks, Jeanne Gold!

I made this without meAt ( I don't eat beef or pork) and it was very good.  It is very chunky. Not a smooth sauce. I enjoyed this. Very easy. I added zucchini and mushrooms and a healthy portion of shredded parmesan cheese. I Also added about a tsp of sugar . Mine seems a little acidic . It made a huge pot. I divided it up into portions and froze it. Will be great when I'm too tired to cook and want something tasty .

Made it without the meat for a vegan style...not bad. Added mushrooms. And definitely needed salt I'm assuming cause the meat would have added that?

I made this recipe  exactly as written. It took me nearly a day to assemble all the ingredients, and then several hours to cut and chop everything before I even started to cook. I was a little dismayed when I got everything in the crockpot and it nearly overflowed! Stirring had to be done gently! The final taste, which I did today, was very good, I'm glad to say, but I'm still trying to figure out how to store all the sauce I now have!

Not bad but I always use Whole tomatoes and crush them by hand not a tool because the old Italians say the acidity in your hands brings out essential flavors? Don't know but have done it since Nona showed me how to make gravy 57yrs ago! LOL 
Oh and NO Turkey, Beef, pork and Veal only in my gravy!

This recipe called for way too much thyme  in it, overpowered all the other flavors. I would suggest you cut it in half if not more.

A good sauce is always slow cooked,  not full of vegetables! 
This how many French cooks make sauce.
