Super easy!  I used 4 fresh peaches instead of canned, and added a tiny bit of freshly grated nutmeg to the mixture.  Next time, I think I'll add a bit more cinnamon.  I baked at 450 for 10-15 minutes.  Thanks for the recipe!

My friends and family loved this! We've tried it several different ways--with both fresh & canned peaches, and we all agree that it's actually best with canned peaches (plus, way easier to make!) I usually add in other fruits before heating it up...blueberries seem to be everyone's favorite, but red raspberries have worked well, too! Best with ice cream, in my opinion.

Quick. Easy. Great Tasting. I tossed the peaches with a little honey and vanilla extract before sprinkling and broiling them.

I really love this recipe. It is simple and quick for the times I don't have a lot of time to make dessert.  And it is a great sweet treat for a grumpy, sweet toothed, husband when he says that there is nothing sweet to eat in the house. :)

Easy, fast and delicious!  I used up some fresh peaches I had in the fridge, and crushed walnuts because that's what I had in the house.  To give it a little sauce, I melted 1 Tbs of butter and poured it over the peaches and nuts.  I also stirred the everything up a little to coat the peaches before I put it into the oven.

Easiest dessert I ever made!  Very good.  I was searching for something to do with a jar of sliced peaches I had opened.  I also put 1/4 cup raisins in a couple of tablespoons of water, heated them in microwave for 30 seconds and added to the peaches before I sprinkled on the sugar mixture.  

I will be making this again.

This was ok. I used walnuts instead of pecans and the brown sugar seemed to harden a little like peanut brittle. I think I cooked it a couple of minutes too long.

There was something about this that I just didn't care for.  Maybe the canned peaches?  I doubt I ever make this again.

This is a nice, little dessert that is so easy and tasty.  This is a good use of ripe or overripe peaches.  I didn’t use canned peaches because I don’t care for them.  The next time I will broil it for 2 minutes, add the chopped pecans, and continue broiling for about another two minutes.

This was a big hit here.  Did a repeat last night. Changes suggested. 2 minutes under broiler with a dab of butter and the 
 BS and Cinnamon mix. Pulled out added the pecans broil another 2 minutes.  Nuts were not scorched and the butter added to the dish.  Will do again and there are now German ( our house guests) fans for the dish

I made this for a quick dessert.  My husband loves peaches.  I served it with vanilla ice cream and it was a hit.  Both my family and my guests loved it.  I will serve again and again.

I used fresh peaches because I had them on hand. I used the suggestion to add nutmeg & the one about baking at 450 for 10-15 minutes. Mine were very large peaches and 2 were fresher than the 3rd. They weren’t cooked through after 15 minutes, but I didn’t know that til I served them. No one cared!! They were delicious and beautiful. I’ll do it again!

I used fresh peaches instead of canned. I broiled it for less than the time called for, but the nuts and sugar burned. Next time I will bake it in a hot oven instead of broiling.

Great and easy recipe. Ended up cooking on the bbq for 10 mins until warm (put it on right after the main course was done cooking)- it was fabulous! Tried fresh peaches the next day - the canned ones were surprisingly better (and easier).

Excellent and easy.  I used a local farms jarred peaches.  After putting the topping on, I spayed butter on top.  Brown sugar did not harden.  My husband said it was a 20!  He wants it for Christmas dessert, which would be very easy.

I used 2 fresh peaches, peeled, pitted and halved. Topping was enough to cover all four halves - probably would have been enough for another 2 halves as well. Be sure to keep an eye on them while broiling, as the pecans can burn quickly.  Might add a dab of butter to each peach halve next time. Served this with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream, and even my non-dessert eating hubby enjoyed this!

I made this for company.  I used fresh peaches.  Be very careful not to burn the pecan topping.  I served it with vanilla ice cream.  I will make this again.
