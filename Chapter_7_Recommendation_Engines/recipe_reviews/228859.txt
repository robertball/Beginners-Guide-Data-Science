I give this recipe 4 starts simply due to the prep work this particular one entails. The soup tasted amazing! However, for ease of cooking, here are my tweaks: First, I sliced the onions, and tossed them in the butter which I melted, and placed them in the crock pot on low on their own to caramelize over night, 10-12 hours. I used salted butter, so I omitted the salt. I also omitted the sugar since they were caramelizing this way. SUPER EASY. The next morning, when the onions were good to go, I threw in the other cooking ingredients to cook for the day. I had no cooking sherry, so I used a 1/2 cup of dry red wine my husband opened the night before. I am a firm believer that if you don't drink it you shouldn't cook with it. And I had 2 quarts of beef stock, so I used that all up. No sense wasting a cup. When it came to the cheese, we used what we like, so that is personal taste not tweaking. I did find, however, that I needed to add a bit of salt and pepper to taste at the end just before serving, so make sure you taste it to ensure it is to your liking. But allowing the onions to cook and caramelize themselves cut the prep work down to the bare minimum of slicing the onions, measuring the ingredients, and getting the bread and cheese ready at the end. About 20 minutes total. You just need to start it the day before, which was worth it to me if it meant not standing over a stove for an hour. Family loved it, warms well for leftovers, which wasn't too much. Will make again!

Excellent! I followed this recipe to the letter (with the exception of substituting the Gruyere and Emmental with provolone and Swiss) and the soup was to weep for. The smell drove us mad all day long: it was hard to wait 8 hrs! Thanks for the recipe!

This is one of the better slow-cooker recipes I've tried. Do take the time to carmalize the onions - the fond makes a lot of difference. Whatever else you do, please do not use 'cooking' sherry, which isn't really sherry and tastes mainly like sour salt water. Use real cocktail (dry) sherry if you have it. If not, a little bourbon, red wine, or Mediera will do. And try to use the cheezes specified, but it you must substitute, regular Deli-style swiss and/or Provolone are better than Mozzerella, which is too bland and milky for the richness of the dish. Finally, I found that slow-baking the bread slices to dry them works better than toasting because the toasted bread is softer and will dissolve in the hot liquid too quickly.

This is delicious but since you already spent 40 minutes cooking the onions on the stove and they are already nice and soft, why not just leave it on the stove and add the broth to that pot and simmer it for another hour or so? Transferring it to the slow cooker seems like an unnecessary step and just creates extra stuff to wash. This seems to be one of those recipes where using the slow cooker really doesn't simplify anything.

This is a great recipe.  I couldn't find Emmental so I subbed in Swiss.  If you put the bread right in the soup it kind of soaks it up and turns soggy so you can coop that right up with your spoon along with the soup - or, if you don't like soggy bread you can not do that.  The bread is definitely key, though.

Even more ridiculously easy: Caramelize the onions in the, lightly-oiled, crock pot (no butter, sugar or sherry needed, just time), add 4-6C beef stock (what's the point of low-sodium if you're going to add salt?), and forget the grated four-cheeses (use the traditional slice of Gruyere, Emmental or, if all else fails, generic Swiss). For individual servings, dissolve a beef bouillon cube in 6oz of boiling water, add 4-6oz caramelized onions, heat in microwave, add toasted bread and a slice of cheese and finish under the broiler.

I made this for the 2nd time last night. It's so easy and elegant! This time I used the crockpot to caramelize 3-4lbs sweet onion with 1/2 cup butter and tsp sea salt for six hours (on high)....Then added 4 cups good rich beef stock, thyme, red table wine and black pepper. Cooked on low for another 6 hrs. Cooking down the onions first in the crock made this so buttery and delicious. Top with toasted baguette with melted swiss.

WOW!  I carmelized my onions early this morning.  (took about an hour).  I wouldn't skip this step - IT IS what makes the soup.  You just can't duplicate that flavor!  Also do NOT skip the sherry!  I used Swanson beef stock, fresh thyme and a dried bay leaf.  It is in the crock pot now and will be ready for when we come back from two junior high basketball games around 7 pm.  Having it with hamburgers for dinner tonight.  It is going to take ALL OF ME not to go in the kitchen to ladle a bowl in secret!  WISH I had oven proof crocks, that way I could broil the cheese on top of the soup.....but we will improvise and it will still be great!  GREAT RECIPE!

Had found a similar recipe online before but decided to try this one and it's awesome! I love making soup in my crock pot and french onion is the best! I will add though, if you want a little something to enhance the flavor or just for a little flair add soy sauce. Don't ask me why or how but I definitely think a little bit of that absolutely finishes this soup. Strange, I know.

I have never made any recipe of French Onion Soup before and I also had never caramelized onions prior to this recipe. I watched the video and read the recipe quite a few times before starting and watched the video a half dozen more times while cooking. The recipe states to caramelize for at least 30 minutes. This was misleading to me, as I had never done it before. I changed the recipe to make 12 servings which was about 6 large white onions. It took well over 3 hours to caramelize the onions to look like the ones in the video. I was not expecting this. Next time I will caramelize the onions in the crock pot a day or two before completing the recipe.

I made this soup over the weekend and it was great.  The prep time was a bit longer than i'm used to for a slow cooker dish, but it was well worth it.  

Based on the prior reviews, I caramelized the onions.  It was worth the extra time.  The process released so much sugar that I may skip the tablespoon called for in the recipe the next time.  I was out of cooking sherry and used a Merlot instead.  After the prep time, the soup spent about 5.5h on high before being served and going on the high end of 4-6h did not compromise the texture.

The final product was delicious and the recipe is now in my "Recipe Box".

I agree with the other reviewer who questioned using a crock pot. The key to a hearty onion soup is carmelizing the onions. Once you've done that leave it in the pot to simmer for at least two hours.  I add a bay leaf, two tablespoons Worcester sauce and a splash of gravy master.  It's an easy one pot meal.

Made this recipe today for my family and it was a HUGE success!!  I could not find the Emmental cheese, so I just used the Gruyere, Parmesan and Mozzarella.  Next time I may just use a shredded 5 cheese italian and call it a day.  Gruyere is expensive but oh so good!  I did carmelize the onions and it was fantastic.  I also used Swanson Beef Stock, fresh thyme and fresh Bay leaf as well.  Sherry was the key.  What a rich flavor this turned out to be.  Definitely on my monthly rotation!  Thank you!

Made this twice.  Once carmelizing the onions, and once not.  Takeing the time to carmalize it made a muh richer flavor.This was soooooo good!  I had to skip the Enmental cheese because I didn't know what it was but the Gruyere took this soup "over the top" on flavor!

All I have to say is OMG! I also used Swiss cheese, and instead of french bread I used a roasted garlic and asiago bread from a local bakery; delish! I had a few fresh mushrooms that I needed to use before they went bad, so added those. This will be in my monthly rotation of recipes...

I followed the recipe as written and enjoyed it very much.  Because I caramelized the onions first I can't say for sure whether it's a must or not but that step wasn't all that time consuming.  By themselves I do not like Gruyere or Emmental cheeses but with the soup they were delicious and really seemed to be bring out the soup's flavor.  I actually served the soup with some simple grilled cheese sandwiches, which were delicious when dipped.  I will definitely make this dish again!

Thought this made very good french onion soup and it was so easy.  I didnt cook onions ahead of time.  I literally threw everything into my slow cooker.  I had provolone and the gruyere cheese only so I used that.  I think this was just as good as soup in a restaurant.

This recipe is amazing!!! It's actually still in the crock pot and my husband and I have both been stealing spoonfuls for the past hour, although it is supposed to be in there for another hour... Too good! I did use merlot, as that is what I had on hand (didn't think to grab the sherry at the store earlier) and used Better Than Bullion for the stock, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it is so good!

Great recipe - just wanted to add a tip for serving - instead of toasting bread put a layer of croutons on the soup and then add the cheese to melt in the oven.  The croutons don't fall apart but they are easily scooped by your spoon - ENJOY!

You can't go wrong if you don't get weird with the basic recipe. Don't use too much sugar or sherry. I can make this without looking I've made it so many times. I concentrate stock from pot roasts for 12 hrs +/- and it's got great beef flavor and color. It's ok to slightly burn a few onions to increase sweetness and color but I said slightly! Until you know you can execute this you might hold out on they Gruyere' and use Swiss +/- Provolone.I bet you make this a lot.

For me, it's easier to make carmelized onions in the crock pot overnight using the instructions on this site.  I always make tons.  Then just remove the extra and save for another meal and continue with the recipe...minus the sugar.  Perfection!

I've made this recipe many times.  It is very good made as written.  However, now when I make it I used 2 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons of EVOO.  I also decrease the sugar to 1 1/2 teaspoons and increase the garlic to 3 cloves.  I like using fresh thyme as well.

My husband made this for our dinner this evening.  We went shopping for the cheeses yesterday and couldn't find the Gruyere and Emmental, so bought Swiss, Mozzarella and had the Parm already.  Today I found a "Hardwood Smoked Gruyere," so picked that up.  I shred a bit of it and, after tasting it, we both said that it did not taste good, too smoky tasting.  So I mixed the shredded Swiss, Mozzarella and Parm and used that for our first bowl.  It was very good.  For my second small bowl, I added the shredded Gruyere and it was fantastic!  I told my husband that the Gruyere took it up a notch and he tasted mine.  He also said that the Gruyere added another delicious dimension to this soup.  Wonderful soup for cool, crisp evenings!  Thanks so much for a delicious slow cooker meal!  YUMMY!!!

I changed nothing! We absolutely loved it and ate it for two days. Definitely a keeper and after the onion prep, not hard at all! I loved the presentation in the oven proof bowls....as fancy as any restaurant. And, like others, I was amazed at how wonderful the kitchen smelled all day!

I totally screwed the recipe up.  I didn't caramelize the onions before I added cooking wine, so I cooked it as long as I thought might be right for forgetting that step. I realized I didn't have a bay leaf - skipped that. STILL the soup tastes so wonderful, can't wait to make it again actually following the directions!  Simple and perfect!

I came across this recipe, and lucky me!! this was fantastic and so so easy. I am not one to take a recipe and totally change and then post it. However......... I didnt have thyme or bay leaf, and it came amazing! I followed the directions exactly and I can only imagine how great it will be when I add the thyme and bay leaf next time. This is a keeper :) thank you for sharing.

I made this soup a couple of weeks ago.  The soup turned out great and my 6 year old daughter could not get enough.  And, this was without broiling the soup with cheese.
I have to admit that it took a while to caramelize the onions, but worth it.  I also purchased a small bottle of real sherry since most said it will last a long time.  I would highly recommend this recipe.

Oh WOW ...... this came out amazing.  I did caramelize the onions as suggested and I believe this made the difference.  It tastes quite comparable to high end restaurant grade to me.  Love it.....

Wonderful flavor and easy to make.  I save the broth from a slow cooker roast beef to use as my base, but I've made it with the packaged broth and that is almost as good.  I definitely recommend carmelizing the onions because the resulting flavor is much better as well as the appearance.    We ususally just use the guyere cheese, but almost any combo will work. While it can work with other wines, the sherry does seem best.

Love, love this recipe! Couldn't find low sodium beef broth so I just ommitted the salt the recipe called for. My husband loved it.  Easy to make and really an elegant dish. The blend of cheeses was so good, though the Emmental Cheese was a bit pricey so I just doubled up on the Gruyere with the mozarella and parmesan.  Will definitely make again!

I made a few modifications to correspond to what I had on hand. I did not have any cooking sherry, so I substituted for equal quantity of 1 part apple cider vinegar, 1 part water mixture. Used 4 large sweet onions and 1/2 of a red onion. used 6 cloves of garlic because I love garlic. I also subbed the cheese for Kraft's 4 cheese Italiano. It was very good, but I found it a bit too  sweet. I think I will use 2 large sweet onions and 2 large Spanish onions next time I make this recipe. Otherwise, it was very good!

This was very easy... insanely easy if you allow the crock pot to do the work.  We caramelized the onions overnight in the crock pot (butter, onion, low setting, 8 hours) and then added the rest of the ingredients in the morning (low setting for 10 hours).

We did add 2 tablespoons of beef base prior to serving.  It was missing a touch of richness.

We really like onions, so the next time we will pre-cook the onions a bit so they reduce some to allow more onions in the crock pot for the overnight process.  Also a left over steak bone (t-bone, porterhouse) added to the crock pot for the day long cooking would add some amazing flavor.

I made this in the Dutch oven that I caramelized the onions in and let it simmer for a few hours.  After adding the ingredients as instructed, I felt the soup had too much of a buttery flavor, so I double the broth and the dry sherry.  The soup is very rich, and delicious.  Satisfying on a rainy day such as this one.

I prefer it with Caramelize onions. Make the onions the night before. Then the next day add the broth and let it slow cook all day. I actually only caramelized the onions and the next day added the beef broth. Nothing else and it was amazing. I no longer need to go out for French onion soup. Of course I couldn't find either cheese so I followed some others and used Swiss and provolone. Perfect !!  I know many people complain on here about people changing the recipes but I for one appreciate it when people say the different things they did. So keep on substituting !!

this recipe is a keeper! Very easy and a hit with the whole family. May add a bit more thyme next time. I also just used a bit less butter(about 1/2 what the recipe called for),used provolone cheese to simplify things and cut the bread into cubes to make it easier for my LO to manage. :)

We had this tonight.  It was excellent. I didn't do that toast in broiler. I don't like soggy bread.  We just added the cheese mixture to the soup and then broiled the garlic bed.  It was great on this cold winter day!

I started with 2 large yellow onions and added 4 smaller white ones.  I cooked for about 20 minutes then added the sugar and continued cooking for another 25 or so until caramelized.  If you don't use the sugar it is going to take longer.  I added the sherry and please, if you're using it make sure it is something you could drink. After about 4 minutes or so (and most of the sherry had been absorbed), I added the mixture to the crock pot and followed the broth directions to a T.  The flavors were decent but did not taste real rich/beefy.  Next time I'll use this as a base and modify with some concentrated beef stock, etc.

We used red wine instead of sherry, 8 cups broth instead of 7. Swiss, mozzarella, and parm instead of other cheeses and it was the best onion soup we ever made. You can bet I saved these notes in my recipe box.

Awesome soup! I used vermouth, that is what I had on hand, instead of sherry.  I also found out, too late, that I had no beef stock so I had to use bullion ( a mixture of beef and chicken), but it was still amazing.  I made the onions the night before and kept them in the refrigerator until the next morning, but it worked out perfect, especially with having to use hot water and bullion instead of cold or ambient broth.

This was super good and actually really easy. The hardest part was cutting the onions. Caramelizing the onions did take some time, but it wasn't hard. I could easily pay attention to a 2 year old running around while doing that portion. I also didn't use low sodium broth, but regular all natural Swanson's. Because of this I didn't add any salt and I didn't miss it when it was finished. I forgot to buy the cheese in the recipe so I used what I had around the house which happened to be shredded mild cheddar and fine swiss. It tasted great! It also makes the house smell awesome, added perk. I will definitely make this again.

This is my 1st review EVER!  I love French Onion Soup and had an old standby recipe that I liked.  I would always order it out and think (privately) that my broth was better - their toppings were much better.  Decided to try this one - BEST FRENCH ONION SOUP I have had!  I did do the onions in the crock pot with butter and for 12+ hours, next morning followed the directions exactly EXCEPT - I didn't have enough beef broth and hesitantly used Tone's Beef Base (will always use from now on).  LOVE IT - THANK YOU FOR THE BEST FRENCH ONION SOUP!

Outstanding!  Prepared this exactly as instructed,  the only difference was I used my homemade beef stock.  As others on this site insist, do not omit the sherry, as it adds a wonderful flavour.  Our guests loved this recipe, and one of our guests is a discerning chef, she said it was the best French Onion Soup, and surpassed restaurant quality!!  What a compliment!  One more thing, I used the slow cooker version, 12 hrs on low.  What an incredible aroma it provided in our home, as our guests arrived.  Thank you for sharing this recipe, a keeper!

Awesome soup! I did make changes, extra garlic, apple cider vinegar instead of sherry, and added a dash of Worcestershire and a couple extra cubes of bouillon since I used it instead of broth. It was just as good as Panera and better than Applebee's! And you MUST caramelize! It took me 2 hours for that alone but it's worth it!

I thought this was good enough for company. The night before, I browned the onions on a foil-covered sheet pan at 350 degrees in the oven, stirring occasionally. In my opinion, it's much easier than a sauté pan. I used two cans of low-sodium beef broth and supplemented the rest with water mixed with Better Than Bouillon. I only had shredded mozzarella for the bread, but it still turned out delicious!

I caramelized the onions using the crock pot method. I planned on Sausage Subs for the first meal so I added sweet peppers to the onions. The Sandwiches were delicious.  The peppers added color to the soup and did not adversely  affect it's flavor. As to your variations with the stock for soup the sky seems to be the limit. Beef base is an excellent choice. Bon Appetite!  :-  )

Pretty much followed the recipe as written, but took a few suggestions from fellow reviewers.  Used some quality red wine and a bit of vermouth, instead of the sherry.   Also added a shot of Worcestershire sauce.   Used small garlic/Parmesan toast and a blend of fresh grated Gruyere and Parmesan cheeses.  The results were fabulous and well received by all.   Certainly a keeper.

My family loved this soup! I too caramelized the onions in my crockpot with 4 tablespoons of butter (which I melted in the crockpot before adding the sliced onions). I stirred the onions every hour for the first 6 hours, then left them cooking when I went to bed. They were caramelized to a lovely golden color at a total of 12.5 hours at low setting. I added the beef broth, Merlot wine (I don’t like cooking sherry), bay leaf, fresh thyme sprigs, and a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce and continued cooking on low for another 6-1/2 hours. This is an amazing recipe! The hardest part was slicing the onions!

I carmelized the onions overnight in just 1/2 butter and half olive oil, left out the sugar and then added the broth and cooked another 5 hours. Totally easy and totally yummy!!!! It's a keeper!

I altered a tiny bit.  Since there is already added salt in beef broth, omitted salt.  I did not use my crockpot either.  Why dirty another thing?  After preparing onions, wine, and garlic.   I allowed to simmer on stove for an hour.  From start to finish it took 1 1/2 hrs to complete.  I poured into crocks with bread and provolone cheese on top and popped under broiler to melt cheese.  
My husband and I both liked this recipe!  It was easy to prepare and delicious.  It smelled sooo good we couldn't wait to eat!  We will make this again.  Next time will be doubling the recipe.  Only had a small amout left over, and that was after we both ate two crocks.  I would like to have more left over to eat another night.

This recipe is simply delicious. It was so easy to make. The only thing different I used was instead of the three different cheeses that the recipe called for I subsituted all three cheeses for a couple slices of mozzarella. I placed the mozzerella on top of the soup and broil for a min or 2. Ill be definitely making this soup again. Thanks for the recipe :)

I made the beef broth by boiling down prime rib bones.  It took 2 days..I added a little water as it got too low. This made a beautiful, rich, beefy broth.  I followed the rest of the recipe except for the cheese.  I only used parmesian and provelone

Wonderful. I made a few adjustments by adding 1 cup of half and half and 1/2 cup cornstarch. The soup was thick and creamy, definitely a keeper.

Fantastic! This is the best one I've tried yet (I'm experimenting with different recipes of FO Soup). Really, really, good. Next time I may do cheese slices rather than the grated cheese, though.

Def. worth carmelizing the onions first!  I also had some leftover prime rib and I first cooked this down with au jus for stock (in the crockpot, of course) and used it in the broth.  YUM

This was very good! I made this exactly as written. Caramelizing the onions in my option is a crucial step To get the richness of flavour this soup demands

I didn't have oven-safe bowls so I toated the french bread and melted the cheese on a baking sheet instead. Then just had people add them to their bowls when grabbing the soup.

There are so many French onion soup recipes out there that i didn't know which one to choose. But I'll tell ya, I'm glad i chose this one! To me, it tasted like a bowl that you'd order away a restaurant. I was so happy with this recipe that I'm actually sauteeing the onions now to make it for Thanksgiving for my family tomorrow!

I used red cooking wine instead of sherry. And Mozzarella and Parmesan. It needed a little more salt, I used regular salt instead of sea salt. I wanted to use whatever I had in the house already, because I bought a huge bag of gourmet onions cheap. It was delicious, although chopping all those onions made tears run down my face. Next time i'll try putting the onions in the freezer for a while before I chop them.

Good soup!  Agree with other reviewer it didn't really need to go in the crock pot could have just stayed and simmered on the stove.  I would use less sugar next time as it was a little to sweet.  Will make it again.

This turned out pretty good, did the sauté portion in my Instant Pot which took 55 minutes (though  I used more onions as suggested by other posts) and then finished 5 hours in the same pot in "slow cooker" mode. Perhaps needed more time as it wasn't as dark and concentrated as other recipes, but I shared it with family members on a cold day and it went over well. I loved the mix of cheeses, which was a great blend and melted together nicely. Made notes and will try it again, thank you for the recipe.

Yummy! Few notes: use dry sherry- not cooking sherry, broil the bread, cook the onions until all liquid is evaporated- this takes longer than 30 minutes, cook on high in the crock pot for 4 hours

Love this have made it several times. I add more onions for a thicker soup, 5 to 7 depending on their size. I like balsamic vinegar instead of the sherry. I sprinkle them with salad croutons and grated cheese rather than a whole piece of bread.

Followed this recipe exactly, and my family gave it highest reviews and asked me to make it often.  Considering my family ranges in ages from 7+ with varied tastes, that's pretty spectacular to have such unanimous reviews!  If that much onion makes you nervous, don't worry...  The process of cooking the onion changes it from a strong flavor to a mild and warming flavor.  My list of "comfort foods" just got a new addition.  :)

I’m going to be in the minority on this but I’m saying meh.   Lots of work with not a good pay off.   What takes forever about FOS is carmalizing the onions.  And it takes longer than this recipe states.  Adding the sugar was a mistake and made it too sweet.  I’ll have to keep looking.

this was delicious! so, to be honest I lacked alot of the ingredients. so if your pantry is a little empty you can do what I did :. substituted thyme and bay leaves with italian seasoning as well as the butter with margarine. used garlic salt instead of sea salt (I hate sea salt). I cooked the onions as directed with no sherry then added to the broth. when it was ready I made the bread.  only thing i didn't like about the bread is it was lacking taste. had I known that itd be so bland I wouldve made garlic bread. 
but OVERALL the recipe was amazing. it fed a family of 6! and  incredibly healthy to most easy dinners. I cant wait to try it with the correct ingredients as I'm sure itll be even better!

Overall I was very satisfied with this recipe.  I used a tall stock pot because of the mound of onions to cook.  I added 8 tbsp of butter instead of 6 so perhaps the extra liquid and the heat not being high enough, my onions never browned, however, I cooked them for nearly an hour.  A little Kitchen Bouquet colored the stock just fine and while I didn't have thyme, I used a mixture of spice that had thyme in it.  I will definitely make this again.  Mahalo and Aloha...

pretty good. added a bit more thyme and rosemary...also hour before serving I sautéed another onion and added it to soup.  gave more fresh onion to it. cooking in crock pot made onions on a little too soft side.

Followed the recipe pretty closely on this one, and my mom and I both thought it was delicious! I didn't have time to fully caramelize the onions, so instead I fried them for about 10 minutes with the butter and sugar before adding them to the crock pot. The flavor was very rich after six hours on high in the crock pot, and didn't need anything extra.  Tasted every bit as good as restaurant soup.

Wonderful.  The broth was sweet from the onions with a smoothness from the sherry.  I used Jarlsberg instead of Gruyere with the other cheeses.  I will make again.

Made it and served the same day. Served in individual oven safe bowls with broiled cheese. Leftover soup (stored without croutons and cheese) was reheated and served just like the first day and my kids through it was extremely delicious the second day!

Delicious! As always I customized the recipe to my taste and ingredients I have on hand. Instead of sherry I used moscato (like a previous review said, why use a wine to cook with that you don’t normally drink). Since moscato is sweet I didn’t bother adding the sugar. Being a vegetarian I substituted beef broth for vegetable. Since I did this I added a vegetarian dry brown gravy mix. To give it color & more flavor. Followed all other ingredients/instructions and let me tell you... This soup is bomb!

Carmelize the onions first! Can't say enough how much this will make a difference in the recipe! I also toasted the bread before placing it in the bowl and used Jarlsberg cheese, too. Gruyere is too expensive (but worth it). However, I just wanted to make comfort food for my Saturday night company without breaking the bank. I'm also a firm believer in reading all the comments from other cooks for tips and suggestions. There was a comment from someone about adding soy sauce. I did add soy sauce to my hamburger soup and what a difference! Naturally, I added it to this recipe 1 tbsp. and MMMMM! I also didn't have any sherry vinegar, so I used some good red wine (Pinot Noir) and while the soup was cooking in the slow cooker, all I could think of was Beef Bourginon. The kitchen smelled heavenly! Try this recipe!

PS - skip the sugar. The onions are so sweet once they're caramelized. I followed this recipe once before and found the end result to be too sweet for my liking...

This was wonderful!!! I caramelized the onions in the crock pot over night on low (about 12 hours) and they came out perfect. So much easier than on the stove top, which takes forever. I added red wine instead of the sherry. The trick to the bread is to make sure you toast both sides . I used just Gruyere on top and it was amazing. So easy, I will be making this again and again.

This is a restaurant quality recipe, best I've made by far. I used the beef base that comes in a jar, not reduced sodium broth and only Gruyere cheese sliced thinly but not shredded.  I'm not usually one for leftovers and I ate this three times and will make again soon!

It was delicious.  I basically followed the recipe with the following exceptions. I used sweet onion instead of yellow. I couldn’t find the emmental and guyere cheeses so I sub it with Swiss and provolone, respectively. I also used regular beef broth instead of the low sodium. I also found Texas toast that had the 3 cheeses of mozzarella, parmesan and provolone already on it. I just sprinkled the cheese mix on top of the already cheesy bread and WOW! C’est Magnifique! My family devoured it. Can’t wait to fix it again. Next time, 
I’m  going to use the crockpot to carmelized the onions as previously suggested by other reviewers.

Taste soooooo good! There's just the right amount of onions and they turn so soft and delicious as they slowly good in the broth.  I made my own broth with lamb bones and it just stepped the soup up to the next level. I don't have any oven proof bowls, so I skipped that part and just melted the cheese into the soup. It was just superb! I definitely recommend this recipe who is a big fan of French onion soup.

This is so authentic....the flavor is just like the French Onion soup you get at a fine restaurant.  I don't do mine in the crock pot.  I just cook it for a few hours on the stove top.  The browned onions were perfect and made the house smell amazing.  And the mix of cheeses is perfect.  My whole family loved it.  I made 1.5 batches and the 4 of us ate nearly all of it.

Maybe I'm crazy but four onions didn't seem like nearly enough. I used closer to 18 medium and 16 cups of broth in my crockpot. It was delicious and worth the effort early on with the onions.

This was sensational.  I cut the recipe in half, because I was only cooking for two people.  My local store did not have emmental cheese, so I substituted Swiss.  (Apparently, they're similar).  Also, I substituted some plain croutons for the French bread. Otherwise, I followed the recipe precisely.  It was rich and wonderful, and I'll definitely make it again.

I love French Onion Soup and this was my first attempt. Wow. It was perfect! I did caramelize in the pan beforehand but I will try the overnight slow cooker method as suggested  in other posts the next time. I did take a short cut that worked out well - instead of making the toast, I used thin small dry toasts and a Havarti cheese. The toasts solve the problem of fighting with the bread and cheese while eating. Thanks!

This was great!  Didn't have sherry so used Chardonnay with a touch of brown sugar--to cut the alcohol aftertaste. Also used sliced Swiss cheese. Turned out yummy. I give it 4 1/2 overall.

Would I do this again? Yes. Would I maybe do it all on the stove next time? Maybe. It was lacking something savory, but a sprinkle of onion soup powder fixed it. Another onion next time might not be a bad idea

This was a extremely easy recipe o make, however it took quite awhile to cook down the onions, personally the changes I would make in the future is to omit the thyme and garlic, not a fan of the taste.

This one of the most requested recipes and what people ask me to make when we have them over to eat.  The prep time is much longer than posted if you want your onions carmealized to a nice brown.  I do the onions a day or two before and refrigerate them.

This soup was outstanding. The only things I did differently were to add a teaspoon of Worcestershire Sauce and 1/4 cup of soy sauce after the soup had been in the crock pot for an hour or so. I wanted to give the broth a richer, deeper flavor. Instead of cooking sherry I used golden sherry wine. Also, I did not have any Emmental cheese so I doubled down on the Gruyere.
This onion soup may be the best I have ever tasted and I will definitely be making it again.
Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe. I followed others recommendations to carmelize onions overnight in the crock pot. Worked perfectly. I added equal amounts of beef and chicken stock. Thanks for the recipe.

Oops!  I forgot the garlic and bay leaf, but it was still great!  I also substituted vegetable "better than bullion" and it was perfect.

YUM! I made my onions in the slow cooker overnight with a bay leaf, the sugar and the thyme. I shouldn't have used the sugar..because I used real sherry and 3 large sweet onions with 3 small yellow onions. I made the mistake of throwing in some beef bones...not needed and added too much fat. So, I needed to skim a ton of fat off. 
It did need more salt so I added a few shakes of porterhouse roast seasonings and a few shakes of low sodium soy sauce. the soy sauce was the game changer...it added a depth of savoryness it needed. I will absolutely make this again. I dried out the baguette slices in a 200degree oven for almost an hour...worked great.  also, the cheeses are fantastic..worth the splurge. I left out the mozzarella though.

Delicious!! It got better and better the longer it cooked! You don't really need the toast.. melting cheese on top was perfect. There was quite a bit of prep but it was worth it the next day when I came home to the entoxicating aroma. I used leftover red wine instead of sherry and a mixture of chicken and beef broth as that's what I had on hand! Loving a chance to use my retro French onion soup bowls!

I substituted the sherry with an apple cider vinegar/water mix because I didn't have any cooking sherry.  Overall this was a good soup and I would make it again.

I made this for New Year's Eve and everyone asked for the recipe.  It was fantastic.  I used a sangria for the cooking sherry and added a little more garlic.  I cooked on low all day and toasted my french bread in the oven before hand since I had a prime rib roast in the oven and did not even put the individual crocks in to melt the cheese.  I have given this recipe to all 5 couples that were here that night.

We liked this soup. It was satisfying and it was quite simple to make. We did, however, think  it was in serious need of pepper. I also think  6  tablespoons of butter  is excessive. Next time I will add pepper and cut the butter back to 3 or 4 tablespoons.

12.23.16   Followed the recipe to the letter, and there are a couple things I would change if I make this again.  I did not care for the “herby” flavor that the thyme and bay leaf brought to this soup, and I'd probably increase the amount of the sherry.  It’s a nice soup,  but honestly, I still prefer my Julia Child recipe (personal taste), maybe just because that’s what I’m used to.

This meal is time consuming to prepare considering it's a crockpot meal ..err.. appetizer or lunch. Look st instructions there is at least 40minutes of "continuous mixing"prep work on stovetop. That's YOU standing there wasting your time. You do learn how to sauté onions and the meal

Made 1 and 1/2 recipe and still fit in the crockpot (used 2 boxes and 1 can of stock), a full double would be close but would proabably fit

Fantastic!  I made the soup portion exactly as said and it was so delicious. I DO NOT have the bowls for under the broiler so I improvised. (I'm only sharing this because I don't think I'm the only one without the bowls). I places the sliced French broad on a cookie sheet under the broiler on high, when it was time to turn them over, I reduced the broiler to low, turned them over and heaped them with the cheese mixture. When the cheese was melted and toasty I put them in the bowl of soup and sprinkled a. It more cheese on top. It was yummy.

This was so good!! I used 4 beef bouillon cubes (the kind that says to use with 8oz water) because I didn't have low sodium. I didn't need to add any salt at all. I served it with Caesar salad. This was such a great meal for a cold day. 

I used this recipe for the French bread. It tastes just like the bread you buy at the store:

This was my first time making french onion soup, and I loved this recipe. Absolutely recommend carmelizing the onions. It gives it such a rich flavor. I left out the thyme and bay leaves and added extra onions and it was amazing. So easy and nice to come home to on a 20 degree night.

Real Good!.  My Hubby doesn't like French Onion Soup and he liked this one.  I used cheese that we like.  Fontina, Parmesan and Monterey Jack.

Very good! I wpuld omit the salt when I make it again. I don't think I cooked the onions long enough (they take awhile ), I'll be sure to save enough time to cook them longer next time. Was good without the bay leaves as I didn't have any. Easier than I thought to make. Thanks!

After I got this started in the morning my eyes were burning from all the onions but it was totally worth it. I did not have sherry so I used a cab instead. The aroma was wonderful to walk into throughout the day.

I added extra onions, as I love onions.  I also added a little extra shredded cheese in the broth, added the bread and sprinkle with cheese (my family loves cheese).  It was so good.   Will definitely make this a staple supper.  Very light and satisfying especially served with a salad.

Yummy and easy!   I followed the recipe except I used Swiss and mozzarella cheeses as that is what I had. I reduced the salt and used Pinot noir instead of sherry.

I liked it, I have had better but I don't know how you could make this better. I didn't have French bread so I used croutons which worked out very well.

Heaven in a soup mug!  I would give this 10 stars if I could.  It tastes exactly like French onion soup in a restaurant.  I made a few very minor changes.  I caramelized the onions in the crock pot overnight.  Why make an extra pan dirty?  I subbed Merlot for the cooking sherry (if I won't drink it, I won't cook with it).  I used provolone and Swiss cheese but that is simply based on personal preference.  Definitely bake your bread slices until they are hard before placing  in the soup or use croutons, otherwise it turns to mush. Oh yes, I suggest putting your crock pot in the garage so your house doesn't reek!

I made this using red onions as relatives in Argentina told me they use reds.  I was questioning the T-sugar and probably because the red onions are sweeter 1/2 T would have been enuf, had to add more salt to balance it.  We loved it and I will make it again.  Cooked it just as suggested, browning onions on the stovetop.

It does take some time to cut the onions finely, but the rest is as easy as can be with great tasting results.  Even better a day or two later

I made this recipe and it was delicious! My daughter who never had it before and claimed not to like onions loved it. I will definitely make it again very soon.

I made this exactly as in the recipe, and it was fantastic!  Only thing I would change is leaving out the salt, but other than that, this one is a keeper.

Go to a liquor store and get regular dry sherry. Cooking sherry is nothing but liquid salt.

This was a hit with my family.  The portion sizes are a bit small so I would assume 1 1/2 portions per person.

Great soup, but one of the cardinal rules of cooking is NEVER, EVER use a wine you wouldn't drink. Any cooking wine is nothing but inferior wine with a ton of salt added. Please use the real deal. That said, nice recipe.

I love French Onion soup so this was one I had to try.
My only changes was using only mozzarello and parmesan (and substituting english muffins for the bread). I didn't have the other cheeses on hand. I had all other ingredients and it still tastes heavenly. The aroma is enough to make my mouth water. Instead of the bread specified, I used some toasted English muffins, split and coated with some garlic butter.

Fantastic!! 
Agree with others, do NOT use cooking sherry. That's just salt water with food coloring and bitters. If it were a perfect world, I'd ban all 'cooking wines' from grocery stores. 
I subbed with a bit of dry red wine. 
It's a great soup! Emmanthaler cheese was unavailable so I got a bit of swiss from the deli. 
The bit we had leftover was even better the next day.

I've made this several times, the last time for a ladies lunch, where it was very well received. I do cook the onions overnight and then add the broth and spices in the morning. I had to sub Merlot for the sherry, and I generally use "Texas Toast" (i.e. huge) croutons and mozzerella cheese. For the lunch, I just sprinkled croutons and cheese on top about ten minutes before service, and it made a bit of a mess to clean after (I hadn't planned to serve it that way, so I hadn't sprayed the slow cooker), but it worked well for serving the soup to a small crowd. Super yummy! I'll make this often with vegan beef broth through the cooler months.

This is heavenly! While I was caramelizing the onions, I filled the crock-pot.  Using beef bullion and a soup bone, along with the bay leaf and thyme, I put it on high to cook.  I used a 1/2 cup of red wine that was already open.  I deglazed the pan, using some of the broth.  I only had Parmesan and Swiss cheeses, which I grated together. I followed the rest of the recipe for the topping.  I used corningware soup bowls and they were fine under the broiler for the couple of minutes needed.  I'll be keeping this recipe for future use! Thanks for posting and the reviewers tips.

This soup was...ok. I made this on the stove top because I didn't have time to for it to cook in the crockpot. I just put it on a small back burner simmering & kept a check on it. This was the first time I used cooking sherry. So when I took the lid off, that's all I could smell & taste. So I left the lid off and let it cook out.  I don't know what u could use instead of this? I used regular beef broth & omitted the salt. We're not big cheese people, so I found the Gryuere and shredded it on top of our bowls. I didn't broil it, just let it melt into it. Definitely get the French bread (just $1 at Walmart bakery) and let it soak in the bowl! I guess I'll stick to getting this at restaurants, because it just wasn't as good homemade.

I gave it a 4 as it needs to be more slow cooker friendly. I used the slow cooker caramelized onion recipe from this site. Put the onions on over night and added the rest in the a.m. Cooked on low until 6 p.m. Great flavour and better than at a 5 star restaurant.  Sugar, garlic and dry red wine (no sherry available) first in the a.m. for 5 mins. Added  2 litres (metric) 8 cups beef broth and the rest of the spices. Cheese used was shredded Parmesan and Swiss  style Emmenthal.  Bread was French Baquette. Served 4 with leftovers even with the large crocks I have. Great to serve for company

Very easy to make and delicious. I didn't use all the salt it called for and used the low sodium beef broth.  Will definitely make it again.

We are vegetarians so used vegetable broth.   It did not take away from the soup at all.   The first steps are time consuming, but the superb result is worth the work!   Absolutely phenomenal soup!!

I had to replace 2 of the cheeses with Swiss and Provolone because they were unavailable. If it was anymore awesome with the right cheeses I'm not sure my taste buds would survive it. This is the BEST French onion soup I have ever had and I've had it on cruise ships, restaurants, etc. Easy to make but hard to wait on it since it smells so tempting while it's in the slow cooker. If you like French onion soup, you will LOVE this one and it's worth the small amount of effort to make it too. 2 thumbs up!!

I followed other reviewers who went straight for the crockpot.  Added butter and onions and let them caramelize over night.  In the morning, I added all other ingredients with the exception of sugar (used candy onions instead) and substituted dry red wine for the sherry.  Let this cook all day, YUM! Made a big batch to freeze and enjoy later.  This is definitely a keeper, thank you!

This is a FANTASTIC recipe.  I caramelized the onions as in the tecipe (teuly worth the time) used good Amontillado instead if cooking sherry and served it over thick slices of buttered homemade toast with melted Swiss cheese broiled on them.  INCREDIBLE!

This was a great recipe! Since I didn't have cooking sherry on hand, I substituted red wine (I had a Cabernet Shiraz on hand) and it added amazing flavour. I didn't add any salt and that was a great call because without it, it was still so flavourful without being very salty like a lot of french onion soups turn out. I definitely recommend following the recipe and caramelizing the onions on the stove, not in the crockpot because it adds great flavour. Since I'm a poor university student, I used regular bread that I followed the broiler instructions for and that was delicious! I also only had a shredded blend of white cheeses on hand so not as good as Gruyère but close enough!
**Definitely be careful to use only a red wine that is dry and that you really enjoy because you can taste it quite well in the onions!

I was ok. Used the crockpot to caramelize the onions overnight and then added the rest of the ingredients in the morning to cook while I was at work. Had substituted olive oil to caramelize instead of butter which my have been my issue but it tasted like it was missing something.

Wow. Slow cooked this on a day off and had a more than satisfying meal. This fed two of us for about 3 days, and then we had some leftover. I will make it again, but when I am entertaining.

My family really liked this recipe.  I followed it exactly except that I only used Mozzarella cheese and Parmesan (as I live in a small town and the other types were not available) and used croutons instead of bread slices that we put in as we ate.  It kept the bread from getting soggy which my husband hates.  It tasted wonderful and will be made again.

I caramelize the onions in the pan for about an hour and then just add the stock and let it simmer on the stove - comes out perfect every time and my family loves it!

Soup was good, just seemed to be missing something - was better the second day.  That said, did the onions in the crock pot so am thinking next time will caramelize them on the stovetop and see if that makes a difference.  Also this makes a HUGE crockpot full, about twice the servings as listed!

Absolutely delicious! I made some changes because I'm vegetarian so I actually used a homemade vegetable stock instead of beef stock which was carrots, garlic and onions simmered with spices (I used black pepper, chili pepper and Cajun seasoning) and water. I also added white wine and soy sauce to the vegetable stock to mimic the taste of beef stock.  Like others commented, I too opted to caramelize the onions in the crock pot ahead of time with butter and brown sugar. I then added the homemade vegetable stock to the crock pot with with caramelized onions and added thyme, bay leaf and the dry sherry. I opted to top the soup with croutons (garlic and cheese croutons from trader joes) and sprinkled a mix of shredded Gruyere and Swiss (cheese mixture also from trader joes) I already can't wait to make this again!

Loved this!  I used real sherry and a mix of swiss cheese and mozzarella on top.  I also toasted the bread a bit before adding to soup so it had a bit of crunch.  Yum!

Followed the recipe exactly. No changes. It was a little sweet for me and not that flavorful. Although, I like french onion soup, I will look for other recipes. This one did not do it for me.

We loved it - made it exactly as it was written! I used my Ninja slow cooker and carmelized onions in the pot on medium and high, and then I turned it on to the slow cooker part.  All in one pot!  Awesome ;-)

Perfect just the way it is! I cooked it overnight on low for 10 hours and then popped it in the fridge until I got home from work. If you do it this way, I would recommend heating the soup in the individual crocks just a bit before popping them in the broiler. My husband thinks it's one of the best he's ever had. It makes for a salty rather than sweet soup. Perfect!

Super easy and delicious. I didn't have sherry, so I used brandy. I also used two sweet onions and two yellow, and I made beer bread in the bread machine and covered it with provolone. Easily the best slow cooker French onion soup I've made.

This was fantastic!  I followed it to the letter!  I only did the 4 hour wait because we would have had to wait until the next day!  Keep it on hig and dont be tempted to lift the lid! As empty nesters, we have plenty for leftovers and when I told my husband, that normally goes crazy having to eat leftovers, he said, "Awesome!". I would suggest replacing the Emmental with Swiss (since it is a form of that).  I found it at Harris Teeter!

I love French Onion soup and this did not disappoint at all. I used Marsala Wine because that's what I had and it was great. I also added a grilled Sirloin Steak slice up for a more substantial soup  (for the husband). Also used slices of Provolone because I like the flavor of that cheese. Thanks for this soup recipe Chandraz.

I didn't have access to the cheese listed, So I substituted an Italian blend of shredded cheese, To make things simpler, I bought frozen sliced garlic bread, browned both sides and used that the size and texture were perfect.

Perfect on a cool Fall day. 
I made this recently for my Aunt and elderly Grandmother who loves French onion soup. They were both really pleased and my Aunt (who is a fabulous cook) even asked for the recipe. :)
I'd give it a 5 but I did find it a bit sweet even though I used a very dry sherry. Maybe I'll reduce the sugar used in the caramelizing next time.

Made as suggested, I think cooking/carmelizing the onions before putting into the crock pot is worth the time.  I used low sodium beef broth- I ended up putting both box fulls into the pot, probably was more like 8 cups instead of 7 cups recipe states.  I did get the "fancy" cheeses and pre-broiled the french bread slices before placing into the soup bowls.  Will be making this at least once a month during the fall/winter months.  Yummo!

I am making this for the second time today.  French Onion is my hubby's favorite.  He likes anything with onion and garlic, so I'll double the garlic.  I used four very large yellow onions.    No sherry here, so I'm using 1/4c apple cider vinegar and 1/4 c water instead. (another reviewer idea).  I also sliced the onions right into the crockpot with the butter and let them cook for about 45 minutes first, and add the garlic for about 5 or 10 minutes before adding other ingredients.

Nice and simple recipe! I used vermouth instead of sherry.  Next time I will try it with regular beef broth instead of low sodium because I found it lacked salt.  A+
