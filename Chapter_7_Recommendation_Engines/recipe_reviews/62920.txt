My kiddos loved this recipe. I was a little concerned about the extra sugar in it, but I followed the recipe as it was. The extra sugar was not needed. With the Cool Whip and the Jello, it was plenty sweet! I also used light yogurt & light Cool Whip and it was still good.

I had this at a party. It was too sweet to put with fresh strawberries. It actually made the sweet strawberries taste sour. It is not bad tasting, it just shouldn't be eaten with real strawberries.

I made this without the sugar and it was great!  Thank you for the tip!!  It tastes really good with granny smith apples.

I tried this version, but it is too sweet.  My friend makes a variation with two containers of strawberry blended yogurt and one 8 oz. container of cool whip.  It is great as a dip or used as a parfait with fresh berries.

3 stars for the recipe, but would give it 5 stars after a few changes. Definitely leave out the white sugar, it is completely unnecessary. Also, I only used 2 tsp of the jello mix and that was PLENTY. To make it a bit more healthy I used light yogurt, fat free cool whip, sugar free jello mix, and low fat strawberry cream cheese. Was delicious with grapes, granny smith apples, and strawberries!

This is really good!  I made this to serve with fruit for a New Year's Eve party.  I wanted something with less sugar and less calories than the typical marshmallow cream dip so I used Lite Cool Whip,  Light yogurt, sugar free strawberry jello, 1/3 less soft strawberry flavored cream cheese and left out the sugar (didn't need it at all).  The consistency is pretty stiff, but absolutely delicious with firm apples, grapes and especially fresh strawberries.  Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.

This was very easy to put together and had a nice strawberry flavor.   I did add the 2 tbsp. of cream cheese, but, in the end I thought it tasted more like a strawberry flavored cool whip.  It was nice and fluffy and good dipped with strawberries.  I started with half the sugar based on suggestions from other reviewers and it was plenty sweet, so, I didn't add the remaining amount.

Very very tasty. Left out gelatin and still good. Used fresh cream and whipped it myself to my own sweetness. Let's see what the family says.
