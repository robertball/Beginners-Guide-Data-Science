I reviewed solely based on smell, I admit it...I can't wait to eat these!  I'm Portuguese and grew up in Massachusetts,  whenever I had a quahog it always had linguiça (a milder Portuguese sausage ) or chouriço. I was THRILLED to find this recipe. Will review on taste tomorrow. :-)

A taste of New England! I scored some big cherrystones at the Pike Place Market in Seattle, used Spanish chorizo and cornbread stuffing mix. Fantastic!

I've made these myself many time.  The only thing I do double or triple the recipe and I also add 1# of bacon and chopped green or red pepper.  Also add crushed red pepper fopr alittle extra hotness.

Geesh This is the way to cook a good ole Fasion portuguese style stuffed quohog. You could omit the chorise and add a few pinches of crushed red pepper to taste with linguica instead of chorico. I use a 1/4 lb of fresh ground pork for flavor and fry up in a skillet with the linguica out of the casing and add to the mixture, instead of cooking the linguica in water(looses flavor. I am originally from Fall River, Ma where the true blue Portuguese peeps are from :) ENJOY!

Almost identical to the simple quahog stuffie recipe I learned as a kid, and a good base recipe to improvise with. We use either Bells stuffing or bake our own seasoned bread croutons. We finely chop the onions (or shallots) and add finely chopped bell peppers as well. Sometimes we use other types of sausage, such as Italian or Mexican. We usually press a couple garlic cloves into it.  If we use canned clams, we add the clam juice and reduce the water by that much. You can basically do anything with this recipe. It's a keeper.

Loved these!! Had them as hordourves 3 nights in a row...only changes were using linguica instead of chourico because it is milder...next time might use half of each sausage. Also, used only 3/4s of the amount of stuffing.

1.these are always a hit. Careful not to add too much Linguica. 2.Okay this time around instead of a whole onion I did half of a red onion with the other half of equal portion a mix of red and green bell pepper. also instead of linguica I used bacon with the same 16oz portion.

I live on upper cape cod and the natives loved these!!  The Chirico kicks it up just a notch the only change I made was the stove top stuffing, I used Pepperidge Farm Herb Seasoning Stuffing it's less salty to me.. This will definitely be my go to!!

Grew up in Fall River, MA. Very similar to my mom's recipe. Using Stove Top stuffing turned out to be a good idea.

Made them pretty much to the specs of the recipe. Had a can of clams and added them for a more seafood stuffing. They were fantastic!!

Great recipe! So easy to make! I followed the recipe as written but I found it a little too salty and a little too wet - I'm thinking the culprit was the stuffing mix I used (Bell's). I cut it with plain bread crumbs and that helped. Next time I will probably use unsalted butter to take a little more salt out, or will just use plain bread crumbs all the way instead of prepared stuffing mix.

Forget the stuffing, coarsely smash up ritz crackers. Nice and buttery. We made these with leftover shrimp cocktail too.
