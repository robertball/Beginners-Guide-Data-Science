Has a delicate flavor that enhances the asparagus without overpowering it.

Made this an hour ahead and put the dressing on after arranging the asparagus in a fancy pie dish.   Slipped it in the fridge and served it COLD - YUMMY

This was really good. I roasted the asparagus but that takes some more oil so the end result was a little more oil than I normally like so next time I will steam them.

WOW this was a different take on asparagus, I think the dressing was almost like a pesto, in fact...if I make it again, I'm going to turn the dressing into a pesto.  Thanks for sharing!

This is delicious. It works well without the cilantro if you don't have any on hand.  Just be careful not to overlook the asparagus.  I'm going to try this with other green vegetables.

Delicious!  Who knew asparagus and lime were such complementary flavors?!?  I prepared the recipe exactly as written, except instead of vegetable oil I used olive oil, and I probably used about half of the oil suggested (I drizzled oil into the dressing ingredients until I was just able to stir it - probably about 3 Tbsp).  I wouldn't have wanted it any oilier.  This made a fantastic side for Pineapple Spiced Chicken and Rice (also from this site).  Thanks for a keeper recipe!

This was really good. I steamed the asparagus with salt and pepper then for the topping I used olive oil instead of veggie oil and nixed on the cilantro. I added into the mix some fresh basil and parsley then sprinkled on a little extra sugar over the asparagus after it was cooked.  That sugar really kicks things up a bit. Very delicious if I must say.
