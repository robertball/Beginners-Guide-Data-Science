There is way too much salt in this recipe. The colour is completely wrong. This sauce comes out a fairly bright red, so there's definitely too much tomato paste. I'm making another batch tonight and this time I'm making the following changes- using 1.5 cartons reduced sodium chicken broth and 1.5 cartons reduced sodium beef broth (this should help with browning), only adding celery salt and seasoning salt to taste, and finally replacing 1.5 cans of tomato paste with 1.5 cans of additional celery/onion/mushroom puree mixed with a bit of flour. Hopefully these changes should give me something more along the lines of what I'm used to both in taste and appearance. Thanks for the base to work with, Mel! I know you put a lot of effort into it.

This sauce tastes awesome while cooking -- here's to hoping it tastes just as good, if not better, complemented by pizza toppings for a birthday supper I'm having with my lover on Wednesday.

I esp. appreciate how easy simple this recipe keeps it -- all ingredients are easily found, most of them in my fridge or spice rack.
Instead of celery salt, I used celery seed (since I buying herbs, salt and salted herbs is redundant).
I also used a can of mushrooms instead of fresh, since that was what I had.
The tomato sauce was from sauced I stewed down from rescued tomatoes at home.

In the quantities stated for pepper and sugar, the sauce is spicier than it is sweet. I don't like my savory foods to be sweet 9/10, and I would still cut the pepper down to 1/4 cup and maybe up the sugar to 2/3 cup.

The recipe is also bigger than it might originally seem if you don't note that the broth accounts for more of the volume than the tomatoe sauce -- different than typical pizza sauce. My guess is this made around 24 cups of sauce. Easily enough for a year of casual home pizza-ing.
