My roast turned out really well, I followed the ingredients, added 1 1/2 tomatoes since mine were small. I really liked the addition of tomatoes to the roast. I browned the meat, but I had browned it after I seasoned it, so whatever came off in pan, once I had the veggies and meat in the crock pot, I just sprinkled more over everything in the pot, later. Since I had started it an hour early, I just put it on low for 2.5 hours, then on high for 2.5 hours. Once it was finished, I took the meat out of the pot onto a cutting board to rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing it; my meat was cooked through and moist.

I cooked this recipe for 4 hours on low and 1.5 hours on high and the meat, potatoes and onions were nice and tender. The carrots were slightly under cooked. If you are using larger baby carrots I would suggest cutting them in half. I am using a newer slow cooker.

Left out the fresh tomato, since I didn't have any...  Cooked all day on low.
Hubby & son really like it, I thought it was too salty. Will try again with less salt.

Very good recipe! Liked the added tartness of the tomatoes. I think I'll try searing the meat first though. Good either way!
