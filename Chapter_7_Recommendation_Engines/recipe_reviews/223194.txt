I made this recipe for the weekly recipe group selection. I followed the recipe as written except for using 1 1/2 pound of shrimp and took the advice of previous reviews to just top with the mozzarella cheese. The shrimp marinade is excellent and could be used alone for anytime you want to grill shrimp, I did marinate it a couple of hours. The sauce was also good without the mozzarella cheese, seemed thin but once the tomatoes and noodles added it was just right. We enjoyed this dish and will probably make it again. We grilled some zucchini and that was so good mixed in with this dish, that I might make that way next time. The reason for four stars is the order of the directions will have you in a real mess. The shrimp was the last thing we cooked and thanks to another review I had everything ready including the sauce. So we weren't scurrying around the kitchen trying to hurry everything up.

This is one of those recipes that must be eaten immediately.  As soon as it starts to cool the cheese solidifies making it sticky and rather difficult to plate / eat.  I think that just a sprinkle of mozzarella on the top of each serving would be sufficient.   It would also help to have one person grilling and the other making the rest of the dish.  Shrimp cooks very fast and cannot be left alone - the sauce etc....  needs attention too, making this recipe was like a race.  If making this for company, I would make the sauce in advance and keep in warm in a double boiler or enlist the help of someone you can trust to grill the shrimp.

I have not tried it yet, but after reading another recipe for a Roasted Tomato Caprese Salad, I wonder how the Romas would taste if you roast them for 3 hours at 225 degrees and then put them in the dish.  Roasting will bring out more flavor in the Tomatoes.

Made this for Recipe Group...This was delicious, but I did make some changes...I did not use the Italian seasoning or salt, as I felt the Italian seasnoning would be too much for us, and I actually forgot to add the salt, lol, but the finished dish ended up not needing it anyway. I just topped each serving w/ some shredded mozzarella instead of adding it to the sauce after reading the other reviews, and for the fact that I have no luck adding shredded cheeses to sauces, they always end up clumpy and stringy for me. Oh also, hubby is not a fan of angel hair, so I used spaghetti. I LOVED the addition of the wine in the alfredo sauce! The shrimp had fantastic flavor, and I would totally just make shrimp like that even if I was not making this pasta. I did allow my shrimp to marinate about 5 hours or so. All in all this was very flavorful, and I will def be making it again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I made this tonight and we both liked it very much.  I used half & half and the sauce was just fine.  I halved the mozzarella and was glad I did. I had pre-cooked shrimp, so I quickly heated it in a very hot skillet, not adding any oil. Will make this again, and will also try it with chicken.

The flavor is terrific, however the prep time is misleading.  Shrimp only need an hour or so to marinate, so pre-prep the shrimp by pealing, cleaning & deveining, the night before you plan to serve?  Put aside until next day in the refrigerator. Also make up the marinade the night before & keep separate in refrigerator until next afternoon.  marinate for one hour or so.

Since Shrimp only need an hour or so to marinate, & just a minute or so to cook, so be sure to have pasta almost perfectly cooked,& drained just right, seconds before you plan to plate & serve the fisnished meal.  

As far as the problems with cheese becoming gloppy, remember the adage when working with cheese, heat it "slow & at LOW temperature, so cool freshly plated dishes, with cheese doesn't get too quickly hot.  HTH!

Liked the taste but felt there was way too much mozzarella as the pasta was sticking to the cheese in clumps.  Might try with less mozzarella.

I grilled the shrimp in the oven (broiled for about 5 minutes, turning shrimp on bamboo skewers once). I also cooked the shrimp LAST while the sauce was simmering, as many other reviewers recommended. I omitted the 2 cups of mozzarella and we simply added some to each of our bowls. It was very delicious with the tang of the white wine and tomatoes with the creamy sauce and flavorful basil and garlic shrimp. Even Optimus Prime approved.

I try new recipes all the time and it's not that often that I'm excited to rush back to the computer to write a review.   This dish is excellent!!   I agree with others that the order of the directions are out of whack and they should be done in this sequence.... 1,4,5,2,3.   Broiling the shrimp in the oven was a great alternative to grilling (since we were out of propane).   Besides being able to leave it in the pan that it was marinating in, you don't lose any of the small tasty bits under the broiler (chopped basil leaves, garlic).  That can all be saved and scraped into the sauce.   Like others,  I also only put the mozz cheese on top at the end.   I then shoved then entire pan under the broiler again for 5 minutes to melt and brown that cheese.   Just AMAZING!   Even my husband (who is not into white cream sauces) really liked it.

This recipe was fantastic!  I used whole wheat angel hair pasta, and found that it did not need the mozzarella cheese (some others suggested sprinkling a little bit on top).  Also, I took a shortcut by using precooked shrimp, then added the remaining marinade to the sauce for extra flavor.  It came out great!

Loved it.  But I also thought that heavy whipping creme was too much. I used half n half. That was my only change.  
1. Shrimp only need to be marinated 20 min to an hour IF there is an acid in the marinade. You could potentially marinade this for hours with no harm.  
2. Yes, the instructions could have been a bit better.  Marinade, make sauce, boiling the water for the pasta and while that comes to a boil thread your shrimp for the grill. 
3. The time it takes to grill the shrimp depends entirely on their size. Medium to large shrimp can easily go 2 to 3 min. per side!  
4. The mozzarella is not added with the Parmesan, only at the end just before serving and won't clog up. I found it served up very well.  

4 of us pigged out on this recipe which says it is for 6. We are big eaters so Yes, I would have added an extra 1/2 lb of shrimp for 6 people.  
Took me many embarrassing lessons to learn to read and visualize the steps in a recipe before actually starting to cook. LOL  

Way to go Gretchen, super yummy! Thanks!

I keep thinking I made a mistake on this but I look back through the ingredients and everything should have been right. The sauce was so thick that I could hardly even mix in the pasta, shrimp, and tomatoes. I only sprinkled the mozzarella cheese on top sparingly, as others had suggested, but it didn't seem to help much by that point. Because the sauce was so thick and heavy I could barely taste the marinated shrimp. If I make this recipe again I'd definitely make some adjustments.

Made this tonight & we loved it! Used thawed, drained frozen shrimp, marinated for a couple of hrs in the fridge. I also added a bit of flat leaf parsley to the marinade. I should have followed others' suggestion & added the mozzarella to the plate instead of at the end of cooking. Even adding it off heat it melted quickly & got somewhat gummy, but still tasted really good. We halved the recipe for two of us & it was still a big serving, so will cut it down a bit more next time. Thanks Gretchen for a new dish in the lineup!

The pasta tasted very good.  Because I do not have a grill, I cooked the shrimp in a pan with the marinade after the 1 hr.  Otherwise I followed the recipe as stated.  The next time I will use more tomatoes.

This was alright. The shrimp were TO DIE FOR and hands down the best part of this meal. The pasta however, left much to be desired. It did nothing to complement the shrimp and as others have warned, is super thick with the mozzarella added. I think the sauce would have been FAR better without the mozzarella. Even with half of it, my sauce was thick and stringy and I ended up with a big clump of noodles. :( All said and done, this was good but not worth the extra calories / carbs. Rice or lightly dressed pasta and a green veggie would complement the shrimp nicely - and that's how I'll serve this from now on. Thanks for sharing, Gretchen.

This recipe was delicious and easy to prepare.  I used Chardonnay since that's what I had available.  Also used only half of the parmesan and mozzarella.  My  family loved it.

This was very tasty!  Hubs gave it an 8!  I didn't use the mozzarella and I used an italian dressing and the top of the stove for the shrimp.  I was just running late and it was the easiest way to do them.  I also reversed the cooking order, shrimp cooked, then added the chopped tomato and basil.  Cleaned the pan added the wine, butter and cream, put the pasta in the pan and threw the shrimp, tomato and basil in to warm it up.  Iwould make this again!

the only changes were I did not use that many tomatoes and 16 oz of pasta was way to much for the amount of sauce the recipes makes (my opinion) however the tomatoes did give it the kick it needs and I chopped them up very small, I did remove the heart of tomatoes. I used a lil more seasonings as well, it was so delish! the marinade and hour wait for the shrimp was very much worth it...and made a difference.  This is a very easy recipe.

Great flavor.  Mozzarella is a bit challenging to get evenly distributed.  Worth the trouble.

I'm on the ketogenic diet so I did have to make a couple of changes. Well, one because of the diet, the other because of desperation. I used shirataki noodles instead of pasta for the diet. Oops! No Italian Seasonings in the cupboard! Being from Louisiana I opted for Creole Seasoning.

Made this for my family this week and was simply a hit! I used Italian cheese blend along with the Parmesan and it worked great! I used my own blend of Italian seasonings.  Will definitely make again.

I made this tonight. I made some adjustments. I cooked the shrimp in the butter on low heat in a pan, then add the half of cup of wine simmered on low heat. I didn't add the cream. Then I added the cooked pasta and tomatoes. The dish tasted very nice.

I am going to try this one but by sprinkling the motzerlla lightly over the top mixed with the fresh parmaesan, and doing a quick broil to avoid the clumping and preserving the texture.

After reading through the recipe, it seemed like an awful lot of pasta so I increased the amount of sauce and used 1 3/4 lb shrimp. I also grilled the tomatoes as well and added torn basil to the pasta and sauce mix. I sprinkled the mozzarella on each serving and as it was still hot, the cheese melted into the pasta nicely. I also grilled the tomatoes and shrimp last.
Next time, I will marinate 2 lb. shrimp, grill 2 lb. Roma tomatoes and use 3/4 box of pasta. Even my husband liked it, which is rare.

My husband and I collaborated to make this (he grilled the shrimp, I made the sauce), and it was a fun project for the two of us.  I did cut back on the mozzarella as many others recommended -- it didn't lose a beat.  Also, just for you low carb folks -- I used spaghetti squash instead of pasta, and the sweetness of the squash really added a nice flavor to the recipe.  It definitely takes a little effort to pull it together, but the final product was well worth it!
