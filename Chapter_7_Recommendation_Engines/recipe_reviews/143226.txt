Great! I have made these a few times, and throughly cooked in the slow cooker with out finishing on the grill. They taste fantastic, and I am highly pleased with the simplicity of the ingredients.

I was a little skeptical about this one, but they turned out great. I only used one beer. I didn't feel like grilling so I put them in the broiler instead. The whole family loved this recipe!!

I picked this recipe because it looked easy and I had everything.  I started to worry while it cooked because the hot cooking beer smell isnt exactly appetizing to me...but the end result is super!  Used one bottle of Mexican beer (all I had) and a yellow onion...grilled for color for about five minutes afterwards.  Next time I'm trying the suggested Guinness and red onion...bet its great!

I make this a lot during the summer. HUGE hit with the boys. I like to serve it with homemade coleslaw to slop on top and homemade jo-jo's.

These are fantastic!  I put the brats into the crock pot about four hours before half-time of the football.  Then two minutes before the half, we fired up the grill. I served them on hard rolls with Bavarian style sauerkraut and the onions that were in the crock pot.  My only suggestion would be to add more onions so you can have more for the topping.  (I also used about 12 brats but didn't have to double the beer since it almost covered the them.)

Very simple and quick. The brats couldn't have been more tender and tasty. We had them on brat buns, and the baked beans we had with them were delicious with  kraut on top.

Overall, not bad...but probably not something I'd make again.  My husband is a fan of bratwurst and since this had so few ingredients and looked so simple I thought I'd give this a try.  On top of that there's no shortage of beer in this house so I was able to convince my husband to give up a bottle - LOL.  So, for a package of 5 brats I used one bottle vs. two with one whole onion thick sliced and half ketchup, half tomato-based chili sauce along with some minced garlic and a bit of dry mustard.  I cooked this on high for 4 hours and they really didn't need to be finished on the grill because they were done. I thickened up the "sauce" that was in the crock pot with a little cornstarch and by leaving the top off.  Overall, my husband thought they were pretty good on rolls.

These were quick and very good. I used Guinness and a red onion. I also used regular ketchup and spicy ketchup combined and then put them under the broiler. They were great. Can't wait to do them on the grill.

I'm sorry, but I just didn't like the taste OR the texture of these! They had a very heavy beer taste and were tender. Guess I'm just used to my brats being grilled all the way.  My husband even said too much beer taste.  I used Icehouse beer, don't know if that was why.  My suggestion would be to maybe only use 1 beer and some chicken broth?? Thanks anyway!!

Delicious, simple, and a great basic recipe suitable for adjusting to your preferences!  I have used Amber Bock and red onions and the brats were terrific...I have also used American lagers and yellow and white onions, and that turned out great as well.  This is a keeper of a recipe!

I didn't have beer available, so I used chicken broth instead.  It turned out really well!  We will definitely do this again.

These came out great!  I used one bottle of Capitol Brewery Baltic Porter (dark flavorful beer) and one bottle of their Island Wheat (golden ale).  The quality of beer definitely affects how the brats turn out.  Do not use cheap beer.

Um... no!!!! This recipe didn't suit me at all! Before leaving for a family cookout, I threw everything in my slow cooker so that my bf and I would have a "ready-made" dinner when dinnertime rolled around. My bf was full from eating too many burgers at the cookout (which turned out to be a GOOD thing...), so he didn't try this. I had one brat and could barely eat it.... I HAVE had brats of similar consistency (i.e. fork tender) before and liked them very much - Honey Mustard Beer Brats submitted by RICOCHETRABBIT are AWESOME!!!!). The sauce Ly's cook in, however, is VERY soupy (RICOCHETRABBIT's cook in a thin (not "soupy") sauce suitable for serving; this sauce was sooo runny you couldn't possibly serve it spooned over brats/buns). The beer taste was very subtle too (but that could be because I used plain 'ol Budweiser and added nearly 2 tall glasses of water to cover everything as directed). I suppose using a darker beer would enhance the flavor (and that's what I use when making honey mustard beer brats). I will eat the leftovers this week because I can't justify wasting perfectly good brats. Ly's idea sounds appealing, but the end result is anything but.... Oh well, at least I enjoyed the potato salad I served on the side. Thanks anyways :)

This is a great way to prep brats before company. My (Wisconsin) husband usually puts brats in beer but now he doesn't have to stand over the stove and watch them boil. Grilling them adds the finishing touch.

Family loved these brats.  Made these using Miller Lite Beer.  They were not the least bit greasy when DH put them on the grill.  And because they were in the crockpot so long, it only took about 7 minutes on the grill.  We used the onion from the crockpot as topping for the brats.  Served this with 'Strawberry-Mango Mesclum Salad', another AR recipe.  This will be a summer repeat.

I was so looking forward to these. They tasted good but the texture of the brat was so mushy that it was unappetizing.  Won't do it again.

I was pretty doubtful on the combination of beer with ketchup but after I tried it I'm sold! I had been given a large amount of freshly made brats from a friend, but we have no grill! So I wanted a slow-cooker recipe and found this. With the amount of brats I had I needed to basically double it, but only used 3 beers instead of 4. I know some reviewers complained the taste was too strong when using the full amount, but it was very flavorful. Next time I'll add some strips of green peppers to the mix. I browned them for just a couple of minutes under the broiler, but honestly don't think they needed it. These were a big hit and something I'll remember for the winter months when we're craving brats!

Watch out!  Onion and beer in a slow cooker make the whole house smell of onion for days!  Otherwise this is a great way to prep your brats.

This recipe is great. I changed a few things to fit my personal taste but the base of this recipe is great. I used half italian sausauge and half brats. I then pan fried them until super crispy. I used one bottle of Guiness Stout, 3/4 cup ketchup, splash of spicy BBQ sauce, and various spices. I added half of a red oinion. I turned the crock pot on high and cooked them for about 3 hours. The texture was perfect. I then put them back in the pan and pan fried them until crispy again. The flavor, aroma, and texture were AWESOME. This one is a keeper!

I just had an Oktoberfest party last night, and I am already getting phone calls for this recipe!  This recipe was fantastic!  I didn't change anything with the recipe.  I did use the Louisville "Brat and Beer" wursts, and it was fabulous.  Thank you for the recipe.

I made a batch following the recipe but it seemed more like something I would feed the kids -- overly sweet due to the ketchup.  I made a second batch using my homemade BBQ suace and that turned out better.  All in all, brats are so easy to cook that using the slow cooker wsa a bit of overkill.

I had a party at my house and I felt like Martha Stewart. EVERYONE loved the brats and all asked for the recipe. We did throw the brats on the grill to give them some color after they were all cooked.

The brats I bought came in a pack of 5 so I adjusted the recipe accordingly. Used Bud Light wheat beer and one cup of water, put in green pepper and mushrooms too. Leftover liquid is just that, it is NOT a sauce. I did put brats in frying pan afterwards to improve the bratwurst color, but not crazy about the soft texture = 3 1/2 to 4 stars. I wouldn't make it again.

Beedubya has it right.  Nobody I know in this whole state lets ketchup get anywhere near a brat.  Serve on a brat bun with sauerkraut and brown or stone-ground mustard.  Now that is a WI brat.

I've made this several times. Instead of just grilling them whole I slice them down the middle and flatten them out.Grill them for a couple of min per side then I cover with provolone cheese.

These were pretty good.  I followed the directions except that I didn't grill them at the end- I just served them as is from the slow cooker.

These were delish! I didnt add the ketchup (mostly because I was in such a hurry, I forgot), but I think this is what we will do for brats from now on! The beer/onion flavor mixed with the grill flavor is PERFECT on those hot summer days!!

These we're okay... My husband and brother-in-law thought they we're great. I really though there was a little too much bear taste and I like brats! Next time, I'd recommend using a can of beer and use water to finish covering the brats and onions. Cook for two hours on high and then grill for 10-15 minutes and they were delicious!

I'm not sure if it was the brand of beer I used but I really didn't enjoy the flavor it gave the brats. Each ingredient really stood out to me & just didn't meld well, giving it a strange taste overall. I like the idea but this combo wasn't for me.

These were OK but I have to agree with a previous reviewer who did not like the consistancy.  It's probably just the way brats come out in the slow cooker, so maybe I'll stick to grilling!

I'm a authentic cheesehead and have been making brats for this way for years.  The only difference is that I cook the brats in a 4 quart pan on the stovetop with the same ingredients, sans ketchup, and boil them for about 15-20 minutes.  After grilling the brats, they can be returned to the simmering pan of liquid until ready for serving.  The only reason I didn't give this recipe 5 stars is that in using the slow cooker, it takes about 3 hours 40 minutes longer. When I want brats, I want them now.

It was easy, I just don't think I'm a huge fan of brats, kind of still tastes bland to me.  But if you're a fan of brats I would still definitely try it!

The beer taste was overwhelming, overpowering, over everything.  Maybe with only one beer or maybe no beers and broth instead it would be ok, but as it stands it was a waste of good brats.

I just made these brats and they are absolutely wonderful, juicy and tender. Easy to make (which is good for me). I used a light lager so the meat wouldnt be as bitter than if you used a darker heavy beer. Good Stuff!

This will be on our rotation for sure! I didn’t do this exactly to directions though. I asked my husband to plug this in when he came home for lunch and he was never able to get out of the office so no dinner! But actually I ended up cooking it on simmer for an hour and then I pan fried the brats for a couple of minutes. These were delicious! Maybe just marinating is all they need. Fast easy and delicious!

These turned out excellent!  Plus I was able to put left over brats into individual vacuum sealed bags and froze.  They were equally as good three weeks later, with no work!

These turned out very well.  I only used one bottle of beer and I stuck them under the broiler instead of putting them on the grill.  This was very easy, didn't require any exotic ingredients, and turned out well.  What more could I ask for from a recipe?  I'll definitely make this again.

It works better if you grill or fry first and then into crock pot in my opinion. I also fill it up with more brats. Dinner one night, lunch for a week.

Made this with all suggested ingredients and used Sam Adams Oktoberfest lager. Loved the flavors of the meat, onions, and of course the beer. I read some of the previous reviews of this dish and felt myself getting annoyed with what was said. The brats are only going to taste as good as the ingredients that you put into the mix. That being said I wouldn't use a mexican lager nor a beer that I wouldn't waste my calories on. Your best bet is using something you like to drink and that compliments the meat. I chose a german style lager because bratwurst is a german cuisine and it happens to be Oktoberfest season.

Being born and raised in Wisconsin this is a must have at gatherings and events. I've learned over the years is to put the brats back into the beer (with onions) after grilling. Tastes awesome!

My husband and I loved it. I Finished it off by broiling since today was a rainy, cold day, instead of grilling. Then put the sausages on sourdough with mustard and cheese and broiled a little longer. Hubby loved it. The sausage had great flavor and was very tender. I will definitely make it again.
