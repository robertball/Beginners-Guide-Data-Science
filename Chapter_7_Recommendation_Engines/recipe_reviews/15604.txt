I love enchiladas and was excited to find this recipe here. These came out well, but needed some more spunk. I added green and red bell peppers to the filling mixture, and topped the enchiladas with some green onions for flavor and presentation. The topping was a bit cheesier than I would like, so I will use less cheese and more sour cream next time. Thanks for a good recipe!

I'm an enchilada fan, I love enchiladas and am always looking for and trying new recipes. This was a great recipe!!! Don't let the simplicity turn you away, these are great. If they're too mild for your taste, you can easily jazz them up by adding spices to the chicken or adding a spicy enchilada sauce. I did add a can of mild enchilada sauce before adding the cheese to the top as someone suggested, but other than that I wouldn't change a thing.

I just made this casserole and my kids loved it!  It was very easy to prepare.  It is not a substitution for real enchiladas, but it is a great casserole for those picky eaters!  I used grilled chicken breast, which added a nice flavor to the filling.  As for the topping, I had no trouble preparing the cheese sauce as some other reviewers mentioned.  It melted to a smooth consistency, but perhaps they added all the cheese at once instead of by small handfuls.  I also added just a small amount of green chile enchilada sauce over the enchiladas prior to topping with the cheese sauce.  I would definitely make this again!

As written, I think this recipe is about 3 stars, maybe 3.5. After the initial try, I made it again with changes (some from other reviewers, some of my own) and it is now my DH's favorite. Here is what I did...Cooked 2 chicken breasts in about 2c chicken broth in slow cooker for about 5 hours, removed from liquid  then shredded. Put shredded chicken in pan, added one packet of taco seasoning and required water, and cooked until no liquid remained. I then followed the recipe and blended the chicken, 3/4c cheddar, 1/2c sour cream, and added 1/4c cottage cheese. I used wheat tortillas, and filled them generously and still got 9 instead of 8. I used one can of enchilada sauce to pour over enchiladas, then topped with just shredded cheddar and tomatoes. Cooked as suggested, but covered for the last 7-8 minutes, let sit for about 10 minutes and served topped with sour cream. My husband gave my version 5 stars (but he has to be nice if he wants me to keep making him dinner ;-) ) I think that the cubed chicken, and the lack of enchilada sauce were my biggest turn-offs about the original recipe. In my version, the chicken is juicy, and the enchiladas are not dry at all. I'm glad that I found the recipe - the filling is great (with shredded chicken).

This recipe was really good, but I added 1/2 package of taco seasoning and also 1/2 can of enchilada sauce to the chicken mixture before I put it in the tortillas.  Then I poured the rest of the enchilada sauce on top and then covered with the melted cheese.  It had a nice flavor that way!

YUMMY!  Definitely saute the onions first.  I added a layer of refried beans to each tortilla.  To make the sauce (it just says melt), I put the sour cream and remaining shredded cheese in a saucepan and added a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles and warmed it all through to melt it.  Very filling but very tasty!

Hubs loves Mexican food but his innards don't, so this recipe was perfect for him.  I did however, have to alter it a little as I was short on the sour cream. I prepared the filling as written, though I did saute the onion first. It's in the sauce that I had to deviate.  I poured green enchilada sauce over the enchiladas, topped them with shredded cheese, then baked, leaving off the tomatoes and olives (only because I didn't have either). This was a nice treat for him and, while not enchiladas with much dimension, they sure were good in a pinch when I was trying to empty out the fridge before a trip!  Actually, I think the green enchilada sauce probably gave them a little more flavor anyway!

This was a wonderful recipe. Mild enough for those who can't handle too much heat, but easily made more spicy for those who do. Very easy to prepare earlier in the day and then slip into the oven in time for dinner. I'll make this again.

I am a wimp when it comes to spicy food, so this recipe caught my eye.  It was great!  Easy to make and delicious.  I did make about double the sauce to help cover all the enchiladas.

Way too bland!  Where are the flavor adders here?  I knew when I read this recipe that it needed jazzing up.  Here is what I did:  To the chopped chicken and onions I added a can of chopped green chilies, and about 1/2 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese.  In a separate bowl I mixed two cans of green enchilada sauce and 1/2 cup sour cream, poured about 1 cup of that mix into the chicken mixture and mixed it together.  Sprayed a 9x13 baking dish with Pam and pour about 3/4 cup of the sauce on the bottom of the pan.  Fill each tortilla with the chicken mixture and roll, placing seam side down in the dish.  Pour on the rest of the enchilada sauce and top with two cups of shredded cheese.  Bake 30-35 minutes in 350 preheated oven.  Top with chopped green onions or (my personal favorite) freshly chopped cilantro.  YUM!

The kids loved the enchiladas!  I mixed taco seasoning and enchilada sauce w/ the chicken.  I poured the remainding sauce on top of the enchiladas.  Next time I will use half the amount of cheese.

Excellent! My husband loved these. I added refried beans and a few seasonings to accommodate our tastes, but this is a solid recipe. Great recipe for those that like it mild and a great starting point for those who like a little more punch. I added a can of Rotel to the cheese sauce to give a little spice (plus I didn't have any fresh tomatoes on hand). YUM! Thanks :)

I loved this recipe! For those of you saying this was too bland and then gave a poor rating - the recipe says MILD. And it is perfect for young kids. I cut back on the cheese, added a taco seasoning packet to the chicken mixture and added a can of enchilada sauce to the cheese/sour cream topping. One of my favorites!

This is good but would be much better if you sauteed some green peppers and onion's, then add salsa (mild), you can even throw a can of refried beans into the mix, then add your  tomatoes and cheese when you roll them up Don't forget to add more cheese on the top as your putting them in the oven!
Before you dish them out, have some veggies like lettuce\spinach chopped thin for the Enchiladas to sit on then let everyone put on their favorite toppings like cheese, sour cream, more green onions and tomatoes and olives!

Disappointing. If I ever make it again, I'll add some kind of mild sauce. Very dry.

My whole family enjoyed this. Made it with ground chicken, and instead of the 1 1/2 c tomatoes, I used the recipe for Red Enchilada Sauce on this site (slightly modified; see review there). Served with shredded iceberg lettuce, chopped cucumbers, chopped red peppers, and chunks of avocado. This will go in our standard dinner rotation.

After living in San Antonio, Tx, I learned that you NEVER use flour tortillas in Enchiladas - always use corn.

These definately live up to their name, mild!  Perfect for my hubby who despises mexican food.  I did add a small can of diced chilies to the sauce (which turned out so oooey-gooey cheesey) and didn't have the black olives so put on a few chopped green onions.  Next time I make it I'll be sure to have the olives as I think that would have added a lot of good flavor.  I'll keep this in my rotation since I can jazz it up on my plate with some spicey salsa, fresh jalepenos, etc.

Yum! I'm always looking for a good, saucy, gooey enchilada recipe, and this is a great one. :) Some reviewers mentioned adding enchilada sauce under the cheese sauce, and since I didn't have any but that sounded like a good idea, I used some jarred salsa and that worked great. Also, instead of all that melted cheese on top (sounded a little too intense!), I made a cream sauce first and melted about half the called-for cheese in that, plus about double or so the called-for sour cream, and it was lovely. Very creamy, just what I was going for! Oh, and I sauteed the onions first, a definite must.

This is a delicious recipe!  I made it the first time exactly as written, and it was great!  The next time, I did tweak it a little.  Here's what I did:  I used a "fiesta blend" shredded cheese, instead of just plain cheddar, and instead of chopped tomatoes, I used medium salsa.  For a milder version, as the recipe states, you could just use the plain tomatoes, or mild salsa.  Great recipe, and my family loves it!

Yum!  It is quite cheesy but I like cheese so that's fine by me.  I did make a few alterations to suit my needs.  I used corn tortillas rather than flour tortillas as that's how enchiladas are prepared in my area.  I used Quorn chicken chunks to make the recipe vegetarian.  I added about 2 tablespoons of milk to the cheese topping to make it more pourable.  I used some canned mild red enchilada sauce on the top.  I will be making this again.

This was very good and really easy!  I followed it exactly, but instead of tomatoes (which I didn't have) I added salsa.  I little bit in the chicken mixture and I poured some on top and then the cheese over it.  My family loved it!!!

Easy! Cheese/Sourcream sauce is delicious! I added black beans and spinach to round out the food groups. Also poured a can of mild enchilada sauce first, then the cheese sauce on top. A new favorite for sure!

This definitely needs more flavor. I like to cook either my chicken or my ground beef in a skillet with some onion, a can of green chiles, and I throw some salsa in there too and then the neat is so flavorful.

I made this for dinner tonight because I was craving chicken enchiladas, and they were absolutely delicious!  Just the comfort food I was looking for.  I did add diced green chiles and crushed red pepper to the mix, and I poured red enchilada sauce on top of the tortillas before the cheese mixture.  I also used a pre roasted rotisserie chicken to shorten the prep time.  My husband and I really enjoyed this dish, and I will definitely make it again soon!  Thank you!

I use Mexican cheese instead of Cheddar to  give it an extra kick. I also pour two cans of enchilada sauce over the wraps and then top with the cheese mixture. This keeps them from getting dry. Don't change anything for the filling... it is perfect!

Great recipe! I followed some of my predecessors by adding less sour cream, and pouring enchilada sauce on top.  As far as portions of the cheese, chicken, cooked onion and tomatoes (which I mixed altogether) and put inside, I just went with what looked right using the recipe as a guide only.  My fussy husband loved them, thank you.

Delicious enchiladas.  Took them to a family picnic and everyone loved them!  Requested this dish for the next get together!  I poured half a cup of enchilada sauce over the top which improved the appearance!

I've searched around for a good cheese and/or cheese and chicken enchilada recipe. Look no more. This is the one. I used shredded beef on one occassion instead of the chicken and it was just as good. This recipe is very tasty and I get requests to make this dish often. Enjoy!

I have to give this 5 stars just because of the cheese sauce.  After reading the other reviews, I add flavor by doubling the onion (saute it first). I added a couplt cloves of garlic. I also added chopped green chilies, and some salt.  Yum!

Did not follow exactly- used Hunts diced tomatoes with jalapenos- half in the sauce and half inside the enchiladas.  Only had 3/4 cup of sour cream so split it between the inside and the sauce, came out geat.  Threw olives on top, and used only about 3 cups of cheese total[ came out GREAT.  Would definately make again, but was a lot for just 2 people.  Served with SteamFresh South west rice.

Great recipe to jazz up leftover chicken.  I did try to do a slightly healthier version by cutting back on the cheese and using lowfat cheese and sour cream.  My chicken was from a mustard chicken recipe breaded in crunchy onions but that only helped to add a little zing to the dish.  My husband loved the outcome!  Next time I think thatI will add a little more sour cream and maybe a few jalapeno peppers.

Great recipe! I needed something with the ingredients on hand. Instead of chicken I used the leftovers from the pressure cooker carnitas on this site. I used the leftover sour cream/cream cheese mix from the seven layer dip recipe (also on this site). I used corn tortillas instead and provided jalapeno peppers for individual plates because the dish was a little milder than I like. I'll try salsa in lieu of tomatoes next time... and there will be many more times. Thanks for a great recipe!

OK, I really liked this... but of course I had to change it a bit.  I was missing some of the ingredients and I was doubling the recipe so here is what I did... cooked the chicken in slow cooker in broth overnight, so it was REALLY tender and shredded it.  Awesome start.  Then I took the onion, chicken, and a packet of taco seasoning and cooked that per directions on the packet.  I mixed that filling with some cheese and put it in the middle of the tortillas.  I stuffed them really full because I had a lot of chicken!  Then mixed the sauce per the recipe but I didn't have enough sour cream so I put some heavy cream to make it stretch. I also didn't have enough cheddar cheese.  But it turned out GREAT anyway!  Made for friends and they LOVED it.

Sorry...but bland, bland, bland.  As I was making it, I kept thinking, where's the kick?  Where's the spice?  There wasn't one.  Thought it would be good for the kiddos, and even they didn't like it.

Definitely a hit at my house - and I made it up quickly so that is where it got my vote - that and the fact that it doesn't have a million ingredients.  However, I did use a can of drained Rotel because we like it.

This dish was easy and delicious! I made it with left over chicken from the night before. We don't like spicy dishes, so this was a hit. My son-in-law loves spicy food so he just added tobasco sauce to it. I will just sprinkle cheese on top next time because the cheese sauce was hard to spread. Definately a keeper!

I wouldn't call this Mexican food.  It's way too bland for me.  
Too much onion and cheese, no flavorful seasonings.  
And I prefer my enchilada's made with corn tortilla's because they seem less bulky.
Family thought it was okay, son ate leftovers burrito style so it wasn't so bad.  I probably will not make this again.

I thought this dish was bland. I was surprised that it didn't call for any seasonings. I added a little bit of seasoning, but not much because I figured if so many people gave it a good rating, I didn't want to mess with it too much. I also thought that each portion was too goopy and rich. If I make this again, I will use my own version...at least I have an idea on how to fix them for next time.

Tasty and pretty fast and easy to fix. I added some drops of Tabasco to the filling and some paprika onto the melted cheese. Very good use for chicken or turkey leftovers.

These came out pretty good, but they were, kind of time consuming and they do not cook well with lactose free cheese. We have lots of leftovers and they are very filling. I would make them again but I would use real cheese. I used medium salsa instead of tomatoes and that came out really nice. I'm glad I tried it.

My husband and I enjoyed this very much.  One thing I will do next time is cook the onions ahead of time.  They didn't cook very well while baking and were crunchy.  I prefer oninons to be cooked all the way through.  I also mixed 1/2 a can of enchilada sauce with the cheddar cheese and poured the other 1/2 on top of the enchiladas prior to baking.  This definately added more flavor.  These also tasted better to me the following day.

This was a very good recipe. I added to it a bit though. I added chilie powder and salsa to the chicken and also refried beans under the chicken mixture. Very good. Both of my kids liked it, which is amazing, and my husband, who is not crazy about chicken. I will definetly make this again. Next time I will add more spice to the chicken though.

My family loved these enchiladas! I added a can or mild enchilada sauce over the top before I added the cheese.I also shredded the chicken instead of cutting into pieces.I will be making these again soon.

Fabulous!  I tried these last night and they were great.  I added a little taco seasoning to the chicken/sour cream/cheese mixture and it tasted great.  I poured store-bought enchilada souce over the top, sprinkled with cheese and baked.  Delicious ... a recipe as close to restaurant enchiladas I can find.  I will make these again!

Yummy recipe!  I followed advice from others and boiled the chicken in chicken broth for 10 mins or so, then I used two forks to shred the chicken.  Afterwards, I cooked the shredded chicken with powdered taco seasoning.  Then, I mixed it with the onion, sour cream, and cheese mix.  Fill the tortillas, then top with roasted red pepper organic soup and cheese.  Cook for 20 minutes.  Remove and spread sour cream over top.  Add black olives if you wish.  This recipe is fabulous!  My 1-year-old ate it up!

Great recipe if you have kids who don't like a lot of spice!  Very rich and cheesy!  I would use a little less cheese next time.  Instead of plain tomatoes, I used a mild salsa so the kids could still eat it, and it was great!  Very easy, great way to use left over chicken on a busy night!

I sauteed the onions and threw in some mushrooms while I was at it. Plus, I used whole wheat tortillas.
Hubby and I really enjoyed these. I used up a lot of ingredients I had in the 'fridge.

4 star rating because I believe the original recipe would be bland. 5 stars with what I did: Took 2 frozen chicken breasts & 1/2 a large onion  and put them in the slow cooker with 1 cup chicken broth, 1 TBS taco seasoning, and about 2 cups medium salsa & cooked on low for 6 1/2 hours (shredding at about 5). Then I removed the chicken from the juices and added the filling ingredients (1/2 the cheese and 1/2 the sour cream to cut calories, plus black olives) I put some of the juice on the bottom of my pan (lined with foil) and assembled 6 enchiladas (I like them meat-heavy) with WW toritllas. Then I spread the rest of the sauce from the slow cooker on top, sprinkled with cheese & olives and baked for 30 minutes at 350. EXCELLENT! :)

These are wonderful.  I leave out the tomatoes and add a can of diced green chili.  I bake them in enchilada sauce (Anna Marie's recipe, on this site).  Everyone loves them.  Sometimes I make a whole lot of them and freeze them in foil loaf tins with some of the sauce over top.  They reheat nicely and are great when you want a quick dinner.  I like them with plain white rice, some sour cream and salsa.  Delicious.

Very good but I prefer to use a little less cheese non top.  I think the recipe calls for too much.  I used about half the cheese for on top and added some enchilada sauce, and thought it was perfect!

Served these to guests who like much more enchilada sauce than my family does, so I only use half a can of sauce when baking them and set the rest on the table for others to get more.

My whole family loved these enchiladas.  It was a great way to make delicious enchiladas without using store-bought sauce.  The chicken did tend to dry out, so maybe next time I'll try marinating it in...something!?  Not sure what yet!  Overall, it was an easy, tasty meal that I'll definitely make again.

After looking at other reviews I put a small amount (1/2 packet) of taco seasoning in the chicken (which was leftover from a whole chicken I made in the crock pot) and used a can of enchilada sauce.  Hubby LOVED it!  Served it with tomatoes, sour cream, lettuce and jalepenos.  Ole!

Followed exactly to the recipe.  It was a little bland next time I will either try using Rotel tomato and pepper or a little taco seasoning to add some flavor.  My three yr old liked the flavor.  It is a great starting point to something that could be wonderful.

Great recipe!  I followed the recipe except that I didn't have enough sour cream, so I substituted ranch dressing.  It gave the dish just a little more excitement!  My husband wanted chili sauce over his, and his parents (who live with us) wanted chili beans over theirs.  Everyone was happy, which is rare! Thanks for a great 'basic' recipe from which excitement grew!

My husband love it! Very easy, but does take a bit of time if you start from scratch. I added half a small can of green chiles to the mixture. I also added about 1/2 a can of enchilada sauce on top before adding the cheese sauce. Great even as left overs!

I added enchilada sauce and green onions for presentation, and used half the amount of cheese and a tad more sour cream. Also, instead of cheddar, I used the 4 cheese Mexican mix by Kraft. Good stuff. My kids ate two batches for dinner and it's a new favorite around our house!

This was pretty darn tasty!  One of my co-workers had brought in enchiladas for lunch and I decided that is what I wanted for dinner.  Fairly easy to put together, I used canned tomatoes instead of fresh, and I put the olives and the tomatoes on the inside as well as the outside.  I ended up putting the tomatoes and olives in the sauce for the outside, but after making it, I wouldn't recommend that.  It worked very well for the inside but the outside had a gritty texture to it.  I am not really sure why that happened.  I think next time I would just use some shredded cheese on top with some enchilada sauce.  Overall this was a yummy recipe.

Deceptively simple, and turned out very good and moist. I added a little green taco sauce to the filling and mixed some into the cheese sauce on top. Husband loved it. Thank you!

A great light dinner that is so quick and easy to make! I was amazed that it was so tasty cos the ingredients didn't look particularly great. My husband loves it and was amazed that i did it all from scratch, no packets or pre-made stuff.

This was an "okay" meal. The amount of cheese was enough to make you yak. I'd half the cheese and season up the chicken a little. Good starter recipe though.

YUM!  This was delicious.  It was a super easy recipe to follow and tastes great.  It is inexpensive and very filling too.  I could barely finish 1 enchalada.  I substitutes regular salsa for the tomatoes and I didnt put in the olives either.  It was very good.

What a great recipe, I did add some chili mix to my sour cream to spice it up a bit.  It was great........

Big hit!  Mixed it with a pound of chorizo to fire it up.  The fresh tomatoes is such a better idea than the whole dish revolving around the red sauce.

These were yummy!  A big hit in my house!  The only change I made was to chop the onions and black olives together in my mini food processor and mixed it in with the chicken instead of putting the olives on top.

Really good! I used a combo of red fat monterery jack & fat free cheddar cheese (it's all I had), lite sour cream & whole wheat tortillas. I also threw in half a package of taco seasoning mix for the filling. The cheese topping was an issue-it was hard to "pour" over the enchiladas; I had to spread it! But it still tasted very good but next time I might try to mix in some enchilada sauce! Thanks so much for such an easy, simple mexican dish!

This was a good recipe, but I took some advice from other reviews and added a bit more variety to it.  the kids loved it!  It's perfect for children who don't like spices.

These were good enchiladas but the cheese sauce seemed a little too creamy, maybe cut back the sour cream next time.

This was a great recipe.  Quite a change from the usual hot and spicy that we associate with Mexican food. I, myself love the spicy tastes but my hubby has a 'tender' palate and he absolutely raved about this. The only thing I did different was to use a small amount of my homemade salsa in lieu of the fresh tomatoes. (I didn't feel like going to the grocers for 2 tomatoes). This recipe has made itself a permanent resident in my recipe box. Thanks Barbara.

The family loved this recipe and boy was it easy to make.  I used canned chicken breast and that made it even simpler to make. A fast & easy recipe that makes a great meal in a hurry.

Great recipe -- quick, easy, and flavorful. I did what some others did, and added taco mix to the chicken and used a can of enchilada sauce over the top. I also used light sour cream to save some fat and calories -- even my husband couldn't tell the difference. Makes great leftovers, too.

This was good but I did make one slight change. I couldn't imagine having enchiladas with no enchilada sauce! So I added a can of enchilada sauce to the topping. Overall though, i thought the inside was very good and I would use the mixture for the inside of the enchiladas again.

I thought this recipe was great. I've been meaning to make some enchiladas and today was the day! This was very filling and so soft. The cooking time was right on the money for me. I of course changed up some things here and there. I added enchilada sauce on the bottom of the baking dish and drizzled it on top. I also made fresh salsa to put on the top, instead of just tomatoes. I personally really enjoyed the cheese sauce for the top, it was so cheesy! I will definitely be making it again, but right now I'm too full to think of food again :)

I did not like the recipe as it is listed above. Instead, I put the tomatoes, onion and 3 tablespoons of sour cream in a food processor and added some cilantro and one small clove of garlic. I cooked the chicken with the peppers. I also didn't use olives.

Very very easy to prepare, easy enough that I could enlist my kitchen-shy housemates to assemble it for me and nobody burned anything down or messed anything up horribly. However, this was a bit too mild and simple and bland for me when I followed the recipe exactly as is with cheap cheddar... so not really my style, but a huge hit with all the picky eaters (anti-veggie, anti-spice) among my friends when I brought it to a potluck. Great for young kids.

I used left-over "beer can chicken" and added fajita seasoning.  Then, I mixed mushrooms, bell peppers, cheddar cheese and a tablespoon of Rotel (w/tomatoes and diced green chilies).  I placed this mix in the tortilla shells and covered them with cheese and the rest of the Rotel.  A great recipe for left over chicken.  I'm guessing the Rotel and the seasoning spiced it up a little.  Good stuff!

Just got them out of the oven and family really liked them.  I didn't follow the recipe after reading the comments.  I used one cup of sour cream, 1 1/2 cup of cheese and a half can of tomatoes and green chiles drained for the filling.  Then I used another cup of sour cream, 3 cups of cheese and the other half can of tomatoes and chilies.  There was no salt in this dish but it wouldn't hurt to use a dash after tasting it.  I used more chicken in mine and I stuffed them nicely so I only used 8 shells.  Once out of the oven, salsa goes really well with it.  Mine were really cheesey and creamy because of the added sour cream.  Jalapeno would be great to add to the mixture on top.  Easy to make and great tasting.  Happy eating....

This is a really good recipe for families with younger kids. Like the title says it's a MILD recipe. It's great for younger taste pallets. If you have adults in your family (like my husband and I ) who prefer a bit more "flavour" reserved enough filling for the 2-3 enchiladas you're gong to eat and mix in a 4oz can of diced green chilis into just those before wrapping in tortilla. --- Just be sure you note which end of the casserole dish you place the "spicy" one in!   -Enjoy!

Yummy but VERY cheesy!  I substituted green onions for regular onions, and next time I will add a little spice to the filling because it was just a little bland.  My hubby absolutely loved it and wouldn't change a thing.  I served it with rice, which helped to dampen some of the cheesiness.

Great and easy recipe!!!! I did cube my chicken up and grilled it with some bell pepper and onion and sprinkled 1/2 a pkage of taco season over it while cooking it. Other then that I followed the rest of the recipe and this was delicious. I did sprinkle some green onions from my garden over the top of them when they were done. Will be trying this with steak next time or maybe ground beef.

This was so EASY and Delicious. While making it I made a mistake and put the chopped tomatoes in with the Chicken mixture and added some salsa and it turned out GREAT! I did cut back on the 4 cups of cheese and added salsa again to pour over the enchiladas, will definately, make this again.

I have made these many times and they are a huge hit in my house. The only change I make is adding a small bit of store bought enchilada sauce to the bottom of the pan and then again over the rolled tortillas before adding the cheese sauce. It adds a nice zip. I also find it less time consuming to layer everything and it still tastes great. So glad to have found this recipe!

I made this dish for Christmas Eve dinner and my parents and even my picky 2 year old loved it.  It was so easy to make, I prepared it the night before and stuck it in the oven for 30 minutes and dinner was served.

I actually did this twice. The first as is and it was good but the kids didn't like it. The second one I made changes. I mixed the sour cream, cheese, and half a jar of picante sauce and heated until creamy. I added 10 cut up cooked chicken tenders and a heated can of black beans. Mixed it all together and served it in bowls. This is now a kid favorite! Thanks for the inspiration!

As someone who never follows a recipe and simply comes on here for basic guidelines, this recipe serves as a great springboard for great enchiladas.  If you're good with your flavors, you'll know exactly how to spice this up.  I sauteed the chicken (I would have preferred to grill, but couldn't this time) in a thin layer of olive oil, adding fresh minced garlic, chile powder, black and red pepper, a bit of cumin, lemon pepper, basil, celery seed, season salt.  I also added greeen peppers and green chiles to the filling, as well as squeezing some tomatoes in.  Obviously, all these additions required extra of the base ingredients.  On the top, I also used green onions in lieu of olives (personal taste). For cheese, I added quite a bit of pepper jack as well.  All in all, ended up pretty good.

My family loved this. It was my 1st time to make enchiladas and this recipe was perfect. So easy to make. My boyfriend said it was resturant quality. I added milk to the topping sause and I think some green canned chilis would of made this dish perfect. But all in all I loved it and will make this in the future!

I added a can of diced tomatoes with chiles, and a small can of green chiles to the chicken and cheese mixture.  I pured green taco sauce over the enchiladas, then put the cheese on top, and topped with sour cream, tomatoes, and black olives after I took them out of the oven.

This was OK.  Way too cheesy - I thought I'd never say that.  It was very plain and boring.

This was a very good recipe, especially for those who don't like spicy.  We added salsa to it, and next time I make, I'll add taco seasoning to the chicken and skip the salsa.  My 11 year old didn't even realize that there were onions in it due to all the cheese.  I also added more sour cream than was called for to make it creamier.

I picked this with the hope that my kids would like it.  50% success!  I poached and shredded the chicken, and only used about 3/4C of Mexican Cheese mix in the chicken/Sr. Cream stuffing.  Then, rather than the suggested sauce, I used a mild Enchilada sauce and the remaining cheese (2C total) on the top.  Not spicy, but very nice!

These were alright. I am on an enchilada kick right now and will use and experiment with all recipes. This is definitely a recipe that I could see kids liking. It had no in your face sauces and was true to its name. That is A LOT of cheese. I'm not sure I would use so much next time.

giving this 5 stars because both my husband and our friend could not think of any way to make it better. I omitted the black olives, and instead of tomatoes I used medium salsa. Otherwise, I followed directions exactly. The prep work (including cooking the chicken) took me 40-45 minutes.

I've never made enchiladas before but these were easy to make (but time consuming since it was my first time). I used flour tortillas, I don't care what the others say, I hate corn tortillas. I sauteed the onion first, added already cooked/cubed chicken from the store, cheese, cream cheese, 1/3 can of Rotelle, and 1/3 can of enchilada sauce. Once I had my enchiladas rolled up, I heated up the remaining Rotelle, Enchilada sauce, sour cream and cheese. I added extra and made it too rich I think, next time I'll stick to the recipe. Poured it all over, cooked it, and added all the other goodies after it was cooked. I just wasn't sure it would be okay cooking it with the tomatoes and olives. I'd love to hear that its better that way. We served this to guests and they loved it. I will definitely make this again.

I work a lot of evening shifts so I made this for my husband and son in the morning and put it in the fridge for my husband to cook.  I used fat free sour cream and about 1/2 the cheese the recipe called for.  I actually received a text at work from my husband saying how good it turned out.  I also doubled the amount of onions for flavor.

My husband will not eat anything except meat and potatoes. This recipe was a huge hit with my whole family including my husband.  I added enchilada sauce to this recipe, freezes great and pop in microwave for after school snacks.  The best and easiest we have had. Thanks.

What a wonderful recipe. It's easy, tasty, pretty to look at, and I can adapt it to our family which contains vegetarians and nonveggies. For the non veggies, I followed the recipe, for the veggies (me), I substituted black beans for the chicken with excellent results. The only issue with the meat part of the recipe is that there was not enough filling for 8 enchiladas. I also added green onions to the finished product, and sauteed the onions, with some red bell pepper before adding them to the filling. Thanks for a great recipe!

Very tasty!  I used boneless chicken thighs and spiced them up before cooking with Adobo seasoning and Chipotle flakes, then chopped them up after cooking.  Added a can of enchilada sauce, which I used as a thin layer on the bottom of the pan, then poured the rest over the enchiladas before adding the cheese sauce, tomatoes and olives.  Had to thin out the cheese sauce with some milk to make it melt better, but otherwise no worries.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Pretty good - lacked some flavor, but that one reason why one of my kids liked it!  I thought the sour cream/cheese combo on top has a weird consistency.  I would probably add some enchilada sauce and cheese to top next time.

I found this recipe to be good, but to save time I purchase season chicken fajita meat from the meat market (comes season with onions, red/green bell peppers and cilantro).  I cooked my meat and chopped it up.  Instead of rolling the shells, I cooked them slightly, dipped them into my Enchilada sauce (the green not the red) and layered the shells with chicken, cheese,sour cream, green onions (optional), another layer of shells more chicken etc. Top the last layer of with cheese, green onions and olives.

Very good, quick and easy recipe. I would suggest either putting some spices on the chicken to add some flavor, or buying pre-cooked chicken that is already flavored. (We used the Southwestern flavored precooked chicken and it turned out great!)

An EXCELLENT, flavorful recipe! I cant stand olives so I omitted them and replaced them with chopped red and green pepper. I think it spruced up the appearance a bit and it tasted great too! I also used light sour cream.

WAY WAY too cheesy (and I am a big cheese lover) and terrible presentation, looked like plastic.... the filling was okay but I seasoned the chicken with taco seasoning to give some flavor, will use idea for filling with different topping, the kids liked it though

I mixed a half a package of taco mix with the sour cream. It was a little bland, but that may be because cheddar in australia doesn't taste quite the same...

This was delicious!  I shredded the chicken instead of cubing and added enchilada sauce.  However, the cheese mixture was difficult to spread so next time I recommend sprinkling the remaining cheese over the enchiladas before baking.

My husband loved these, I thought they were much too creamy.  I probably prefer a tomato sauce base for filling enchiladas/burritos.  I used salsa instead of tomatoes on top, but definitely could have used more. They were pretty good and I am sure kids would love them!

Really liked it. Only change was I left out the onions. I mixed the olives in with the topping and added a few more with the tomatoes. I used canned diced tomatoes because that's what I had on hand. Really good.  I sometimes cook chicken breasts in slow cooker with chicken broth and shred to use for dishes like this. Handy to have in freezer.

This is a great all around crowd pleaser. Not much in the way of spiciness (the kids asked to skip the onions) but you can add your own preferred spices to taste. My wife is not a big fan of chicken so I made a separate pan substituting with black beans. Super easy and the whole gang was happy! Yum!!

Easy breezy to make. Would love to know whether or not I could substitute pinto beans for chicken in this recipe, and by how much for people that are vegetarians. Please consider adding that to this recipe as an option if possible. Will be making again! :)

This is a great recipe. I've tweaked it a bit. I don't do the onion or black olives, my family is too picky. I cook the chicken in taco seasoning, and I do add  rice in with the chicken mixture. I don't do the cheese and sour cream mixture at the end. Instead, I pour enchilada sauce all over them and then sprinkle the cheese. My family is picky, and they love it!

Really good base to make additions to later.  Added chopped tomoatoes and SMALL amount of green pepper on top.  Will add more veggies later.  Loved the cheese sauce and the chicken turned out great.  My boyfriend liked that it didn't aggrevate his stomach like spicy food often does.

Used a little mozzarella along with the cheddar and salsa instead of tomatoes.  Left out black olives.  If you have leftover chicken, this is a quick and delicious dish to make.

This recipe is a good start but it needs some tweaking.  I could tell the filling would need a little more pizzaz for my crew so, I added a 4oz can of green chilies to the mix.  That did the trick.  The topping was trickier.  Recipe calls for 3 cups of cheese in the filling.  Way too much!  I reduced it to 2 and it still came out too thick.  I added about 1/4 cup of milk which helped but it was still not 100% satisfied.  Next time I'll experiment with the proportion of cheese, sour cream, milk to get the consistency was looking for.  Most importantly the taste was good and the family said they would have it again.

The cheese ended up thick...and the enchiladas were very bland. The filling was good, but could use a little something.. anything to kick it up just a notch.  I thought it was crazy that there wasn't any enchilada sauce for the enchiladas.

I made half the recipe as shown for the kids, omitting the olives and tomatoes on top (picky kids, what can I say!). The other half, I added 1/2 cup salsa to the chicken mixture, poured a few tablespoons of taco sauce on top of the folded tortillas, and kept the olives and tomatoes. Major crowd pleaser! :)

This recipe was quick and easy. I grilled my chicken however and shredded it and it was soooo good and seemed more appropriate for enchiladas.  I'll definately be using it again, maybe adding in a few changes.

I enjoyed this recipe, and it was very easy to make. My boyfriend found it bland, though. I'll have to come up with a way to spice it up for him, but leaving half of it mild enough so that I'll eat it!

These are so good. All I noticed was the sauce is a little thick so I used a little evaporated milk to thin it and keep it having that smooth texture you can't get with milk.

My whole family loved it.  From the mouth of my 3-year-old, "More chin-chilada's please" and from my husband "top 5 dishes".  I didn't have enough chicken to make an entire batch, but did half it.  I only ended up using about a cup total of the "taco blend" cheese.  I think 4 cups would be a little much for my taste.  Also used diced tomatoes and green chilies instead of plain tomatoes and also used a small can of enchilada sauce: 1/2 inside and 1/2 on top.  Will definitely be making again!

i tried this on company and there weren't any leftovers :-) i didn't follow the recipe to the "T" though...i probably tripled the amount of cheese and used the 4 cheese mix that i buy in the store. i also added a can of chiles for some extra flavor. the kids and adults gobbled it up.

This was great, and very easy.  Will spice chicken more next time, maybe use a taco or fajita seasoning.  I also topped with enchilada sauce to give it more of a Mexican flare.

Simplistic and easy. Pretty tasty too! I added some tomatoes and a little of pre-made enchilada sauce in the enchiladas to make it taste that much better!

This is a great base recipe and jumping off point for a perfect enchilada.  I followed another reviewers suggestion and cooked the chicken breast in chicken broth in a slow cooker on low for roughly 4 hours, which allowed me to shred the chicken instead of cube it.  Since my boyfriend and I prefer a bit of spice I did add some chopped onions, chili powder, and a bit of cumin for some smokey flavor.  I also added about 3-4 tablespoons of medium salsa to the chicken mixture, which really helped moisten the chicken and add a nice stronger flavor.  While the cheese sauce topping was extremely tasty, I would say you could cut it in half or cut it out all together and use a red enchilada sauce for a lighter meal.  I realllly love cheese, but the cheese in this recipe was even a little tiny bit much for me.  In any case, its a great starting point for a recipe, and I highly recommend it.  I can also see how the recipe would be perfect for kiddies as written.  Thanks for the great recipe!

my husband LOVED this recipe.  i opted to not add the olives or tomatoes on top of the dish, used the Mexican Blend cheese instead of regular chedder, and didn't put the melted cheese and sour cream mixture on top of the sauce - instead just put the enchilada sauce and topped with tons of cheese.  it's a very easy dish to prepare.  will def add to my list of recipes that i rotate.

The recipe called for too much cheese for our tastes. I reduced to around 1 cup and increased the chicken. I also mixed some salsa with the tomates. 
Tasted good - very hearty - I appreciated that it did not have a traditional enchilada sauce.

I chose to make this recipe specifically because it is very mild.  I wanted to get my very picky child to eat the same thing that the rest of the family was having for dinner!  She ate it, which is a huge achievement for her.  I on the other hand felt it was way to mild for my tastes (but I knew that going in).  I boiled the chicken breasts w/ the chopped onion (had to be really cooked for my picky eater) and I added about a tablespoon of taco seasoning to the water that I cooked the chicken in (again hiding it from my picky eater).  I then followed the recipe to the letter after that.  I will definitely be using this recipe as a base for enchiladas again but will add some green chili or jalapeno and enchilada sauce for a good kick the next time. I'll of course be making two seperate batches :-) Thanks for sharing the recipe.

A great recipe to use as a foundation. I used fat free sour cream and 2% sharp cheddar cheese to decrease the fat content. It wasn't so mild after I added a can of green chilies and diced onion to the "inside ingredients" plus green chili salsa on top of the sour cream. Not to mention the whole wheat reduced carb flour tortilla. Overall a reasonably healthy VERY good looking and tasting enchilada.

I loved this recipe, and it was so easy!!!!
I took another reviewers advice and added 1/2 a can of enchilada sauce to the chicken mix, drizzled the rest on top once they were in the pan before the cheese, a Tbsp of taco seasoning to the chicken mix and I sauted the onions because our family is not big onion fans.
The cheese was a little excessive on top; next time I would not make that much. But my DH loved it and even ate the leftovers we had today, and he NEVER eats leftovers!

I really didn't care very much for this recipe.  It ended up being alternately bland and slightly icky, but that may be due to my choice in enchilada sauce.

It was a little too cheesy to me and my family. It looked beautiful when it came out. But nobody liked the taste. So wasn't a winner for us, but very easy to make.

My entire family loved this recipe except for my son who is very picky.  However, I did add some enchilada sauce to the topping, and some extra onion (for my husband).  It was wonderful and my family says I have to make this more often.

This was exceptionally good!  I used canned diced tomatoes, but otherwise made the recipe exactly as written.  I was thrilled with the cheesy sauce with the sour cream.  I will use this to make mac and cheese!  I would probably add diced chilies to the filling, but other than that, it was a keeper!

Cheesy and Easy! I used a grocery store rotisserie chicken and shredded Mexican style four cheese. I also added a clove of garlic and small can of chopped jalapeno to the chicken mixture. I also was very generous with the amount of chopped tomatoes on top. I also skipped the step of warming the sour cream and cheese (saves a pot and time).

Thanks for another winner of a meal!

My husband LOVED this! He raved about it all night! The only thing I would change is the amount of cheese to put on before putting it in the oven. Ad a cup, then another if you don't think it's enough. I thought four was a bit much, but I'm not a fan of a lot of cheese either. Also, have a bottle of Tapatio handy, if you like more spice!

These were pretty good, but not spectacular.  In an effort to reduce the fat content, I used lowfat sour cream.  I had trouble getting the cheese to melt into a good consitency, and wonder if maybe it was because of the lowfat sour cream.  To get around it, I had to add a few splashes of milk.

This was a very good, eash and fast dish to make. I thought It looked a little bland so I put some mild green chili's on top with the olives. Its one I will put in my recipe box.

This was pretty easy to make, but it was way too heavy and very plain to my opinion. May be changing sour cream for yogurt and adding some spices will help.

Although I enjoyed this, because I LOVE cheese, my two boys and my husband, who will eat anything, didn't like it. I added Rotell to the top and some extra seasonings to the filling, it was only ok. I'm going to look for a more traditional Enchilada recipe, this one was a waste of chicken, cheese, and sour cream for me.

This was really good.  Much better than the turkey enchilads I made a few weeks ago.  I did things a little differently.  I started with raw chicken which I cut in cubes, seasoned with a little sea salt, chili powder, cumin and lime juice & sauteed in a drizzle of olive oil with onion, peppers and minced fresh baby spinach.  When cooked and cooled, I added the cheese then rolled the enchiladas.  We don't like olives so topped with the chopped fresh tomatoes and chopped green onion.  delicious.  ty for sharing

These were pretty decent. They were VERY cheesy ((but I think I added more than called for anyway)) and the bottoms got soggy. They were decent enough that we may try them again if we need a quick dinner.

Easy recipe that the whole family enjoyed! The kids liked that it wasn't spicy.  Next time I'll experiment with less cheese (to please the kids) and adding enchilada sauce as some reviewers suggested.

This is a great recipe. I did however use onion powder instead of chopping onions. I also used a can of cream of chicken soup and a small can of green chiles in my chicken mixture. My chicken was boiled and then shredded as well. I also poured green enchilada sauce over my enchildas and covered them before putting them into the oven. After about 30 to 40 minutes, I sprinkled the remaining cheese on these little babies and popped them back into the oven without the foil for about 5 minutes instead of melting the cheese and sourcream and pouring over the enchildas. Big hit at our house. I will be making this again.

Yum, yum, yum!! I now know what our family will have for dinner the night after TACO NIGHT. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used left over chicken taco meat that was seasoned with "McCormick chicken taco seasoning mix" (packet). The seasoned chicken made these enchiladas very flavorful, not just cheesy. If I choose to make this recipe, and I don't have left over chicken, I will make the seasoned chicken just for this dinner!!! I'm so happy to add this recipe to my collection of family favorites.
