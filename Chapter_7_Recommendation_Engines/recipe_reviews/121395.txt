Made according to recipe but thinly sliced meat and quickly pan fried with onions, placing both on crusty, toasted french rolls that were drenched with Horseradish Sauce.  Heated a touch of the marinade and poured that over meat that was additionally topped with Emmental shredded cheese. Excellent hot lunch.  Will add peppers and mushrooms next time for a treat.

Deeeeelish!  The only change I made to this recipe was to use a beef tenderloin in place of the flank steak.  It is what I needed to use up.  I loved the creamy horseradish sauce!  Sometimes I find that horseradish seasonings don't have much horseradish flavor.  This was not the case here.  It was perfect!  The marinade was just right as well.  It just enhanced the flavor of the meat without overpowering it.  On top of that, it looked great too!

Very tasty.  The steak had good flavor, and the sauce was great!  The only thing I did was cut back a little on the mayo and added a touch more sour cream to make up the difference.

Excellent!  Very tasty dish!  One of the best steak recipes on allrecipes.com. The dijon / Worcestershire / garlic marinade is superb and so is the horseradish sauce!  I doubled the amount of horseradish and the horseradish sauce turned out great. However, there was tons of horseradish sauce left and consequently, I would cut by half the suggested proportions.  Nevertheless, this is an excellent steak recipe; I will definitely make it again!

I have used this for several years now.  It never fails to please.  The marinade, as noted, tenderizes the meat well and the flavor is excellent.

The steak was yummy and tender but the sauce was FANTASTIC.  I added much more horseradish to our taste. Next time I will use half the mayo and sour cream as we had lots of sauce left over.

EXCELLENT!  I make this all the time.  My husband, 2 year old and 1 year old love it too! If I can't find flank steak I use flat iron steak and it is just as good.

Very very good. I followed the recipe to a T and marinated for a good 24 hours. To get the flavor into the meat well it is important to criss cross the meat. I grilled mine for a few mins per side until rare in the middle and we enjoyed it. The sauce is really good but next time I will add more horseradish for personal preference.

It is a great recipe, even on skewers in chunks.  I love the very mild horseradish sauce.  If you don't have mayo, use a 1/2 cup sour cream.  Put it on rolls too for a steak sandwich with lettuce.  Very good, easy recipe.

Nice recipe.  We used KC Strip.  Very tasty and very tender.  My boyfriend thought it was the best steak we had ever grilled.  We will use this recipe again.

This was AWESOME....the sauce was TOO great. My biggest tip with this, as with all mayo based sauce recipes...is to make it ahead of time and let it sit in the fridge over night, just like the marinading meat. It just does something to the flavor of the sauce...something GOOD. Enjoy this! I know we will, again and again.

Oh, and I served this with butter pan-fried, cubed red potatoes with rosemary and salt and pepper and some roasted brussell sprouts. Perfecto!

If I was rating just the meat I would give it 5 stars.  Great flavor!  I thought the horseradish sauce left a lot to be desired though. I have made this again with just them meat.

Delicious flank steak.  The horseradish sauce is awesome - even better the next day.  I added a bit more horseradish as I like it with more kick.

I only marinated like 15 min due to time, and I subbed plain yogurt for sour cream, because I was out of it. Added more horseradish. The sauce was delish. And the steak was cool. Would have been even more flavorful had I gotten to marinate longer.

Really good! I used moose meat and had to substitute a little bit of onion powder for the green onions, which I was surprised not to have in the fridge.

I used a different cut of steak other then that I followed the recipe word for word. I enjoyed the flavor very much the steak was perfectly tender and the sauce just made it all that much more.The leftover sauce made a great salad dressing the next day.

To start, BBQ was put away for the season so I used the old iron skillet - super hot to sear and then into the oven 350F to finish. Couldn't find Flank - closest they had was Angus AAA flap (known as Bavette here in Quebec). As far as I know - the two are close (flank/flap).
Girlfriend gave it a 10*....I found the horseradish sauce to 'die for' but the meat - way too tough. This may be due to the method (although regular steak done this way is never tough) or the cut - flap = may need much more prep. Next time I'll try to do flank on th BarBee like the recipe calls for.

This was very flavorful! The only thing I didn't like was that the mustard was a very strong flavor.  Next time I would reduce the mustard in the marinade to about 1 tablespoon.  The horseradish sauce was super tasty, I added a little extra horseradish for my taste. I put the steak slices on an english muffin with the sauce and it was great!!

I used an even better, but similar meat marinade, also found on Allrecipes. The Horseradish sauce was very good. I doubled the horseradish, because I like horseradish, and added the tobasco from the marinade in aswell. A bit runny, but I will be making this again.
For the meat marinade, look up "Marinated Flank Steak" by GUYCON. It will be one of the first recipes, with several hundred reviews. It has Soy Sauce in it. And 41/2 star rating. I always use it, it's excellent.

I purchased a flank steak from an actual meat market (rather than the grocery store); I also marinated this for over 24 hours. While the flavor was good, it wasn't as good as I was hoping given flavorful ingredients.  I would increase the garlic and lemon juice next time.  The Horseradish sauch was excellent and would use this for other cuts of meat as well.

Both an excellent marinade and sauce, I used a white wine Dijon mustard.  Marinating the steak over night really helped to tenderize the meat, it was so flavorful!

The marinade gives the steak a unique flavor that pairs well with the horseradish sauce.

Yum!  I ended up with a slightly different marinade (balsamic, soy sauce, etc...) but absolutely loved the horseradish sauce.  I did it in the broiler, which worked well.  Next time I will try to cover the meat with tinfoil after taking it out, because it did try out slightly after sitting 20 or 30 mins.

This was tasteless, except for the horseradish sauce.  I followed the recipe to the tee.  I will make the sauce again, as IT was delicious, but the steak was just so-so, no particular flavor.  I grill a lot of flank steak...... this was nonrepeatable..........

I usually agree with most reviews, but not this one!! My husband who is not a picky eater, really disliked it. The meat was VERY bland. I marinaded the steak for 24+ hours, and followed the recipe exactly. I would HIGHLY recommend adding salt or soy sauce to the marinade.  I will not make this again.

So good! It's one of the new favorite in my house. I let the meat marinate for about 24 hours. The sauce was simple and made enough for the next time!

This was yummy!  Very different flavor for flank/skirt steak than what I usually do.  I didn't have horseradish which I'm sure changed the flavor immensely so I used extra Dijon.  

I have since used the marinade and sauce (minus horseradish) on chicken breasts we put on the grill - really good and different.  A keeper.  Now I can't wait to try it once I get some horseradish in the house!!! :)

What a great marinade! I only had time to marinate for 2 hours and it still made a budget friendly steak taste much more.  I served this with Creamed Spinach and Sauteed Mushrooms.  It's a keeper!

The flank steak was good and tender but didn't have an enourmous amount of flavor.  The sauce is excellent though.  I would serve this sauce on any type of red meat.

I did not use the marinade, but the Horseradish Sauce recipe was delicious.  I ended up dividing my recipe into two small bowls and adding an extra 2 teaspoons of horseradish to one for a spicier kick.  Yummy!

This was just ok... nothing too special and I probably would not make this again.  I marinated the steak for over 24 hours and still nothing special.  Disappointed because I had high expectations for this one.  I find that a lot recipes on this website are over rated and it's hard to really figure out which ones are the good ones.

The steak was overpowered by the marinade, and it didn't seem to tenderize it, as promised.  The sauce, on the other hand, was delicious, although I made it with regular mayo and sour cream.  I'll use the sauce again, not the steak recipe.

I've followed the receipe to the letter. It's marinading, the sauce is chilling. I loved the taste of the sauce. I'm so excited to taste the finished product. I'm giving it 4 stars right now, because it smells wonderful and the sauce tastes great.

Marinated for 4 hours it was great. Next time will allow more time for marinate, which really made this piece of meat. Also have used a sauce like this with corn beef, it is excellent!

This was very good.  My family all enjoyed it.  The only thing that I would change is to marinate it longer.  I only marinated it for about 8 hours and I think overnight would have been better.  The sauce was a real hit.

The Flank steak we bought didn't have much taste to it.  So the 4 stars relate to the first time I tried this and I sure will try it again.  Thank you for the recipe.

Review is for sauce only.  Sauce was absolutely great and so simple.  Since I don't like mayo at all, I did 1/2 cup of sour cream, otherwise made as is.  Delicious on our prime rib roast both the day it was made and for sandwiches later.

Super easy, and DELICIOUS! My husband has raved each time I've made it. I doubled it, and put one flank steak in a freezer bag for a ready to go entree. Marinated all day. Will make this often!

i wasn't that impressed with this recipe, also maybe it was just the cut of meat not necessarily the recipe.

This is a delicious recipe and very easy to make. The sauce is good also.
