I got to try this recipe both ways... exactly how it was written and w/ the suggestions. Trust me... DO THE SUGGESTIONS!!! I followed the first batch exactly (just adding mini choc chips) and it was very watery and stickly like others said. The taste was ok but nothing special. I probably would of been fine w/ it but it didn't make that much specially after everyone picked at it to give it a try. So I decided to make another batch and this time I tried out the suggestions. OMG Everyone LOVED the second batch!!!! My kids didn't even want to use the first batch anymore so I threw it out. The second batch not only tasted better but it also came out more like cookie dough and it wasn't sticky at all. I doubled the recipe so we could pick at it and still have plently to add to my vanilla icecream. This is how I made it: 5 TBS BROWN SUGAR, 6 TBS SUGAR, 4 TBS BUTTER SOFTENED, 1 TEAS VANILLA, 3 TBS WHOLE MILK, 1 CUP FLOUR, 1/2 TEAS SALT, 1/2 CUP MINI CHOC CHIPS. This was enough to make 24 small melon ball size of chunks that I've put in the freezer.. When ready to add to my icecream I just cut each ball into forths and it was the perfect cookie dough chunk. Definatly try this out.. I can see how this would be addicting.. I can go into the freezer at any time and take out a small ball and eat it... Ummmmmm

I followed recipe 'as is' the first time.  It just seemed to be missing something.  I was wanting something more like chocolate chip cookie dough and found this to be more like sugar cookies.  The next time I made a couple of changes... I used all brown sugar, milk instead of water, a bit more butter and vanilla and finally added just a pinch of salt.  This was superb!  Will be making it regularly.

Wow! What a simple, great recipe. Based on the other reviews these are the modifications that I made: I doubled the amount of vanilla, 1 1/2 TB milk instead of water, 2 TB of brown sugar, and I added a little over a 1/4 of a cup of mini chocolate chips. When completely mixed, I wrapped it in plastic wrap, rolled it in a log, and froze it. I then sliced up the log (how you would for slice and bake cookies), and quartered each slice. Amazing!

Wonderful!  I loved this, but here is a suggestion for the health conscious (as I admittedly myself) who worry about fat content.  Try substituting the butter for the same amount of yogurt.  It tasted great!  I used vanilla, but I believe plain may be better.

I'm giving this 4 stars as it's written.  I followed the recipe exactly the first time - although it wasn't bad, I definitely felt like it was missing something.  Just wasn't like the real thing.  Well after tweaking it just a little, I've found that what it's missing is some salt and a little baking soda (that's what really makes it taste like "normal" cookie dough).  I also used milk instead of water, but used less of it the second time around, just until it had the right consistency.  With these changes it was definitely a 5-star recipe - I couldn't tell the difference between that and regular cookie dough!  It's kind of dangerous actually ;-)

A wonderful addition to a bowl of ice cream (if you can stop eating it plain!).  I used milk instead of water, doubled the vanilla and added 1/2 cup mini semi sweet chocolate chips.  I put the mixture on a piece of plastic wrap and formed a log/loaf after sealing the wrap.  I also dusted the cut pieces with powdered sugar to help prevent sticking when I put the pieces in a container to store in freezer.

I followed the recommendations of GingerB ( 5 TBS BROWN SUGAR, 6 TBS SUGAR, 4 TBS BUTTER SOFTENED, 1 TEAS VANILLA, 3 TBS WHOLE MILK, 1 CUP FLOUR, 1/2 TEAS SALT, 1/2 CUP MINI CHOC CHIPS) and these turned out phenominal!  The kids LOVED them, and ate most of them before we put them in our homemade vanilla ice cream.  I will definitely make this again, maybe even keep some on hand in the freezer for a quick sweet fix :)

This recipe is absolutely AMAZING! I don't know why I never thought of it myself. I read every review before making it and saw that alot complained that it was too sweet or not too sweet, I think it is just perfect. I did however only use only 1 1/2 tablesooon of brown sugar becuase we are running low on it right now. I also used 1 tablespoon of water because alot had said it was too wattery. My cookie dough turned out perfect. Call me a pig but I think it is the perfect curl up on the couch on a rainny Saturday and pop in your fav DVD type of snack. I am such a sucker for cookie dough and this recipe is going to be used way too often in our home.

ooooohhhh...soooo good! I actually quadruple this recipe, and then scoop it out onto a cookie sheet in small little heaps, as if you were going to bake it, but then put it in the freezer.If you can hold off on eating them all, they will last for about 2 weeks in a freezer safe container.

Yum! I used this recipe to make cookie dough for my homemade ice cream (I used the Creamy Vanilla Ice Cream recipe from this site) and it was fantastic! However, if you want to make that ice cream recipe with this cookie dough in it, I suggest making a double batch of dough, because one batch was not enough for my cookie-dough crazy family! This was really, really yummy, and I will be making it again! Thanks for sharing!

I'm a pregnant woman who was craving cookie dough - I was so excited to find a recipe that didn't use eggs. I followed other reviewers' suggestions for making it to be eaten as is: all brown sugar, milk instead of water, pinch of salt, chocolate chips. Also added a dash of cinnamon for a little extra flavor. This was super simple and very yummy.

This recipe was pretty good.
I would definitely cut down on the brown sugar, because it makes the cookie dough abit TOO overpowering to eat on its own. I made this without adding the ice-cream. Maybe with the addition of a nice plain vanilla ice-cream, the sugary flavour would be mellowed down? I'm not too sure. The mixture WILL seem abit sticky/wet before refrigeration.
I recommend adding a little more vanilla extract if you're eating this by itself.

Used milk instead of water and added lots of vanilla.  Delish.  Although hasn't made it into ice cream...yet! :)

This recipe is AWESOME!!!!! It tastes soooo good and is soooo easy to make. I made 4x the recipe as this recipe is very small. I made it 2x - once with smart balance margarine and once with smart balance LIGHT margarine - They both came out fantastic - so I will be using the LIGHT margarine from now on (the higher water content does make a differece - as this is not being baked. Also - It turned out less greasy that the one with regular margarine!) I took the advise of the other reviewers with a bunch of things - I used only light brown sugar instead of white and brown sugar (so for the original recipe - 1/4 cup of brown sugar. I added some salt, and used about 1 tsp. vanilla and 2 tsp. soy milk (adding liquid to get the correct consistency). I didn't have mini chocolate chips so i placed my chocolate chips into my food processor and chopped them up a bit... I rolled the dough into a bunch of thin snakes/logs, froze it on parchment paper on a cookie sheet and cut them into small pieces. I mixed it into homemade Ice-cream - DELICIOUS!!!!!! These cookies tasted like chocolate chip cookie dough and not sugar cookie dough with these changes. *UPDATE* I made this as the crust of "Fluffy Two Step Cheesecake I" and added little cookie dough balls to the batter and on top of the cheesecake and drizzled chocolate on top and froze it - It was awesome!

I was kind of having a sweet treat moment and needed to use up some heavy cream, so I made this recipe to go into Five Minute Ice Cream which is also from this site. I took JAE12349's advice and used all brown sugar, used milk instead of water and added a little salt. I took my 1/2 tsp. measuring spoon and made little balls and set them in a baking dish and froze until firm. Sticky little buggers. I haven't tried it yet but it seems to look okay. Once I have a chance to try it and take pics of a firmer ice cream, I'll take pics and change my review on how it was in ice cream. As is, it's okay with minor changes.

Loved this recipe and so did my boyfriend. I used Splenda and Splenda brown sugar in place of the sugars and added some mini M&Ms. Big hit!

Very tasty on its own or in ice cream! I chopped up a few milk chocolate almond pieces and mixed them in. My dough was a bit too sticky so I ended up adding a bit more flour. Next time I'll cut down on the sugar, it was too sweet for my taste.

Cookie dough that doesn't have any raw egg in it so I can eat it guiltlessly (ok, I admit the waistline is feelin guilt ;)) was worth a second try as I tried this recipe 'as is' the first time and thought it was bland and not worth the calories. I made this again I used these suggestions as posted by giggletush: 5 TBS BROWN SUGAR, 6 TBS SUGAR, 4 TBS BUTTER SOFTENED, 1 TEAS VANILLA, 3 TBS WHOLE MILK, 1 CUP FLOUR, 1/2 TEAS SALT, 1/2 CUP MINI CHOC CHIPS.   And that, my friends, is a recipe dangerously good:)

Oh my gosh!  This is so awesome!  I've had this in my recipe box for a long time, and as much as I love chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream, I've never made it.  I think deep down I knew how dangerous it would be to have a container of cookie dough in the house!  Well, my review is based on the alterations of other reviewers (mainly giggletush's).  Here's the proportions I used:  6 Tbsp. brown sugar, 5 Tbsp. sugar, 4 Tbsp butter, 1 tsp. vanilla, 3 Tbsp. milk, 1 cup flour, 1/4 tsp. salt, 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips.  I rolled them into little skinny logs, froze for an hour, then sliced.  Excellent!

Nice recipe- comes together very quickly.  As another reviewer noted- great as a rainy day curl up with a movie snack!  Never last long enough to make it into much ice cream.

Excellent! I used all brown sugar and only 1 tbsp of milk (rather than water). This was perfect in homemade ice cream. It doesn't harden up. Stays nice and soft, even frozen. The only thing... It's addicting. Very addicting. Beware! I added mini chocolate chips to mine as well. :D Thanks!

I made the best chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream using this recipe. I followed the reviewer GingerB's suggestions, basically doubling the recipe. It made enough for my 2 qt recipe with some to spare for snacking.

I liked this, though was very grainy and a tiny bit bland. Fell very short of my expectations, but I hardly noticed the grainyness because I overflowed this recipe with chocolate chips :)

Fantastic recipe! I used milk in place of water, but this is a perfect recipe. Great for ice cream or just to keep in the fridge as a snack.  :)

I substituted the all-purpose flour for gluten free oat flour and the milk for water (and halved the amount), and I was pleased with the result.

followed the suggestions of other reviewers (mostly "giggletush) and it came out great.  We were excited that its totally vegan if you use soy margarine for the butter!  Add it to some rice ice "cream" and its close to the real thing!

Oh, man.  This is too addictive. I used Smart Blend instead of butter, Almond milk instead of water and skipped the white sugar, since I added semi-sweet choco-chips...  I couldn't stop our daughter from racing me to it! There's only the smallest bit left in the fridge & it's mine!!!

I used this recipe along with the five ingredient ice cream one on this site. I followed the recipe except for subbing milk for the water. It definitely tastes like authentic cookie dough; it just seems like something is missing.

Delicious in the Creamy Vanilla Ice Cream recipe from this site.  I added a handful or so of mini chocolate chips to cookie dough.  Then I rolled the dough into little balls and froze them on a sheet pan.  I stirred them into the almost-frozen ice cream by hand.  My family gobbled this up.

My husband and I threw an ice-cream party with a toppings bar.  This one was a big hit!  And I didn't mind eating the leftovers the next day.  I added 1/4 C chocolate chips and used milk instead of water like others suggested.  Keep it in the fridge instead of freezing for ready snacking.

I made this just to eat--not to put in ice cream.  It wasn't sweet enough.  Add 1/2 the water first, and then add in the rest if necessary.  Otherwise it may be too wet.  It would probably be okay if the ice cream was pretty sweet.  Too blah by itself though.

Whoever invented this recipe was a genius!!! Who doesn't like cookie dough?! (except for the people who don't?) I used milk instead of water, and didn't use a whole 2 tablespoons. Cookie dough... ah...

I made this recipe today and was disappointed. I was looking for cookie dough that I could add to my ice cream that would taste similar to the cookie dough found in the ice cream in stores. I always want to eat the pieces of cookie dough out of the ice cream and there's just never enough in there. So I made this and it tastes nothing like cookie dough ice cream when you add it to ice cream. I'm sure some people like it and it's good for them but it's not what I was looking for.

Yum! I made these to go into that chocolate chip cookie/cupcake recipe where you put cookie dough into the middle of a cupcake before baking, and I wanted to make sure I wasn't risking anything with raw eggs. This recipe is perfect! Good balance with the cupcake-y goodness.

Since so many other people said it, I used Ginger B's modifications. I doubled the recipe and spread the cookie dough over the top of a batch of K. Anderson's "Fudge Brownies I" from this site, and the result was wonderful! (And I still have some left over to mix with ice cream!)

Wow, this is so good! It taste way better than the cookie dough bits in store bought ice cream. I am confused though, where were the chocolate chips in the recipe? I added about 3 Tblsp. of mini chocolate chips to the dough. The only change I made was using whipped dairy butter instead of stick butter, as it was what I had on hand. It just made them a little softer. I liked that the recipe didn't make a ton, also, and was quick to mix up.

This is excellent!  I've had this in my recipe box for years but just now got up the courage to make it.  I took the suggestions of others and made this with 2 1/2 Tbl brown sugar, 3 Tbl white sugar, 2 Tbl softened butter, 1/4 tsp vanilla, 1 1/2 Tbl milk, 1/2 C. flour and added 1/4 tsp salt.  I could have licked the bowl clean.  I was only able to get 14 balls out of it which worried me until I remember one reviewer doubled and got 24 balls.  I'm planning to put this in homemade vanilla ice cream.  Can't wait!!!

Following the suggestions from GingerB, I saved some balls to make White Chocolate Covered Cookie Dough Truffles. They were delicious! TIP melting white chocolate: bring water to a rolling boil, place choc. into heat proof bowl, place over water. Don't allow water to touch the bowl. Stir and keep a close eye on it. Refrigerate before moving the balls.

See i only put the dough in the freezer for a half an hour and it was a little soggy. But other than that it was great! So just be sure to leave the dough in the freezer for as long as it takes for it to get hard

im giving it only 4 stars because i think originial recipe is like a 2 and modifications make it like a 5+ so i guess that makes it a 4? anyway, i followed "giggletush's" suggestions, and it turned out great, however i couldnt use the full 1 cup flour, had to use more like 3/4 otherwise it wouldve been too stiff/dry. anyway, i loved the taste of this cookie dough and im a really picky eater. i put it in my ice cream... so yummy!

This was awesome, though I followed "giggletush"'s recipe rather than what was stated in the recipe. I substituted smart balance for the butter, but next time, I'll stick to the butter if I'm doing it for a dairy meal.  I found that they didn't really freeze well with the smart balance, and then they kind of dissolved in the cheesecake that I put them in. But it was great all the same!

Just like a smaller basic chocolate chip cookie dough without baking soda and eggs. Exactly what I was looking for.

I had a recipe like this one, but I couldn't find my because on movieing. This is about the same as mine.  GREAT recipe!!! I made it for my son's birthday cake. I put it between a tripled layered fudge cake and poured fudge frosting over it and then put M&M's on top. My son was VERY happy with his cake. ;-) P.S. I didn't add as much flour. That way it was easier to spread.

I made most of the revisions suggested - used a full teaspoon of vanilla, used soy milk instead of water, added a pinch of salt - but I still wasn't crazy over this. I found the margarine overwhelmed the taste and eating it raw in the ice cream left one feeling a bit sick to the stomach.

I only made one serving and used milk instead of water. I put it in homemade chocolate ice cream- so good! I wish I'd had chocolate chips.

This recipe was pretty good! And I did wonder about why there wasn't any chocolate chips in the recipe, shame shame! :D Anyway this tasted a little floury when i made it, and i tried to add more vanilla or something but it still tasted floury.. Hmmm.

I thought that the cookie dough was more like sugar cookie cookies and so i made it again but added more flower (for a 6 serving i added 5 tablespoons more) and instead of water I added milk. I also added mini Chocolate chips and after put on the ice cream i added a little bit of cinnamon

This was tasty and simple to make! To duplicate the consistancy of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream bits I had to almost double the flour.

I know it sounds a little odd, and it did to me too at first, but add chocolate chips to this recipe and then spread over just cooled homemade brownies.  Chocolate chip cookie dough brownies!  YUM!!

I love this recipe!
I added Coconut shavings to it then added cinnamin it was absolutely great with natural vanilla icecream! I loved it!
Also I thought that you could add sprinkles to make it more festive for a party or birthday!

My advice to anyone making this to eat plain, add a pinch of salt, and use much less sugar, unless you like that crunchy sugary texture then by all means...other than that, it's real yummy.

Yummy! I made this today. I used all natural margarine so I wasn't able to form it into a log. I put it in a bowl and put it in the fridge for an hour. It turned out great! I added a 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla though. I can't have dairy, so I ate some out of the bowl. Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe if you love eating raw cookie dough!  Dont be afraid to try this, its eggless.  I recommend adding mini semi-sweet chocolate chips (about 3/4 cup per recipe), depending on how chocolate-y you like your dough!  Wonderful :)

Unfortunately, it came out way too soft and would not have held its shape. The flavor was alright but it needed a little salt. I had to add around 1/2 cup of extra flour (maybe even more) which made the flavor even more off. After adding more sugar and a little salt the flavor was passable.

Everyone at my family Christmas raved about these. They were gone very quickly! People eat a lot of them. 8-10 just because they thought it was so good. I decorated the tops with the melted chocolate. Some in a swirl, some a squiggle. It added a lot of sophistication to an otherwise simple treat.

Was too sweet. I found the texture was a little grainy, but that's to be expected given the ingredients. The main problem was the sweetness. I would highly recommend adding a pinch of salt at the very least to cut back on the sweetness.

Pretty good. Not bad. I think it would've been better with chocolate chips and maybe cinnamon sugar. I'm going to do some revising next time and see how it turns out.

This was pretty good, I doubled the recipe and used 2 tsp vanilla (all I had was the imitation stuff and its not as strong as pure vanilla extract) and I added 1tsp salt, as well as some mini chocolate chips. Next time (and there will be a next time because who doesn't love cookie dough?) Ill use more brown sugar than white and ill add an extra tbsp of butter to make it more rich tasting and I might add some extra vanilla too.  This worked well for the cookie dough cupcakes recipe from this site & I love that I didn't have to worry about raw eggs! Thanks for sharing

Extremely easy to make, pretty tasty, but just not the same taste as cookie dough with eggs...Probably very good in ice cream though.

Awesome for playdough ice cream!  To make for a 4-qt. ice cream maker, quadruple the recipe: 1/2 cup heaping packed br. sugar, 3/4 c. sugar, 1 stick softened butter, 2 tsp. vanilla, 2 Tbsp water (more if needed after adding food coloring), 2 c. flour, 1/4 tsp. salt and LOTS OF FOOD COLORING.  We divided ours into 4 parts and made red, blue, purple amd orange.  Add lots of yellow food coloring to your vanilla ice cream recipe.  Add bits of cookie dough when ice cream is done.  My kids beg to make this fun recipe!  YUM and FUN!

I followed Giggletush comment and it came out really really good.  Though a little sugary. I used soymilk instead of whole milk. I didn't use as much salt as giggletush said to use I just used dash or so.

I made this for my cookie dough-loving brother (6 years old) rather than for ice cream. When we made chocolate chip cookies, he would always prefer dough over actual cookie, but the raw egg was a worry. This recipe was GREAT with the given substitutions (given in first few reviews). It still wasn't as great as real cookie dough with egg, but beggars aren't choosers lol. The only thing... whoever suggested 1/2 tsp of salt, that was WAY too much!! I had to add  a touch more milk to get rid of that saltiness, blech. The slightest pinch should be just fine :) Milk made the cookie dough more sticky, but that was fine since we were eating it as is ^_^ 1.5 tsp of milk for more of a dough, 2 tsp milk for sticky dough.

Yes definitely use all brown sugar and add milk and more butter and a pinch of salt.  This was so yummy and rich.  I didn't know whether to eat it plain or use it in the vanilla ice cream I made!  It was "that" good.

When I read this recipe, I stopped what I was doing so I could make it.  It is so simple and good.  I didnt make it to add into ice cream, but rather just to eat by itself.  I added peanut butter and chocolate chips just for something different.  Mmm...

I followed the advice of another reviewer and made this using 2.5 tablespoons brown sugar, 3 tablespoons sugar, .5 tsp vanilla, pinch of salt, .5 cup of flour, 2 tablespoons butter, and 1.5 tablespoons milk, and .25 cup of chocolate chips.  Even after freezing the result was not cookie dough.  The result did not solidify even after freezing.  It stayed watery and mushy and I only added 1.5 tablespoons of milk.  I had higher expectations for this recipe based on what other reviewers said.  This looks like cookie dough but its texture fails to resemble both store bought cookie dough and the cookie dough chunks in ice cream recipes.

I made this using the extra vanilla, milk instead of water and mini chocolate chips. I rolled it in plastic wrap and froze. Just before the ice cream was done I took it out of the freezer and sliced. Then each slice I cut into fourths. I returned it to the freezer on a paper plate. When the ice cream was done I then stirred the cookie dough in. Worked perfectly. I then returned the ice cream to the freezer and left it there for about an hour. Everyone loved.

Over all this was very good base, I added chocolate chips to mine and liked it much more than just the basic dough.  What is confusing is that the picture has chocolate chips in the dough, yet ther are none in the recipe.  I think this could be altered into a peanutbutter cookie dough if wanted. You have to work fast to get it cut into little pieces after freezing it, because it gets hard to work with when it warms up.

Didn't really enjoy this. 
As many others said, the texture was funny and needed more flour, and then it just became too floury.
And no matter what I did, it just didn't taste like real cookie dough. (Although I do admit it was better in icecream than on its own). Next time I think I'll just make the real thing...

This is pretty tasty. I also had to add more flour to get the right consistency. I followed other reviewers suggestions and added 1/4 t. salt, used 3T butter, milk instead of water, & mini chocolate chips. I still think it's laking something, I just can't figure it out. Thanks for the great recipe to use in our homemade ice cream.

I used this recipe to make "uncooked cookies" for a dessert instead of mixing it into ice cream. Everyone loves to eat cookie dough, and this way there were no eggs to worry about! I quadrupled the recipe and used vanilla soy milk instead of water. It was a little too sweet...I'll use regular soy milk next time...but it was a big hit. If you use the cookie dough cookies idea, I'd suggest serving them on a cookie sheet as one poster suggested. I stacked them on a plate and they got melty and we ended up attacking the rest with spoons.

I used this in five ingredient ice cream also from this site. I made it into a log and then froze it in plastic wrap, I then sliced it and cut it into small pieces. My girls thought it was fantastic. Many Thanks.

This is very easy and tasty (add 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips to make it even better), but it didn't hold together very well in my ice cream maker.  I added small pieces during the last 5 minutes of mixing but they sort of blended into the rest of the ice cream.  It still tasted wonderful, but I'd like more cookie dough CHUNKS.  Maybe next time I'll freeze it longer than 2 hours and see if that helps.

This recipe tasted pretty good to eat right away, but once you froze it and tried to add it into an ice cream maker it dissolved. I think if I were to make it again I would add a lot less liquid. I've tried my own tried and true cookie recipe (but omitted the egg and added a little bit of milk) and rolled it into little balls about the size of an m&m and froze them. That worked pretty good. This recipe is delicious to eat from the bowl though!!!

YUMMY, and soo easy to make! I added mini chocolate chips to it. I put this in "five ingredient ice cream", and they went well together! This one's a keeper! T

This was great!  I had a craving for raw chocolate chip cookie dough, and this hit the spot!  I stirred some chocolate chips in, and it was wonderful!  And no risk of salmonella! :-)

What a cool idea!  I made this for my little brother, who absolutely loves cookie dough ice cream.  It was kind of sticky, but putting it the freezer solved that.  I made it into a log and wrapped in wax paper.  My only difficulty was serving size- I was uncertain how much cookie dough to add to a bowl, and later the ice cream carton.  Best if added to softened ice cream in bulk- takes too long to wait to soften and mix in when one is in the mood for a bowl of sweetness.  Tasted delicious.

GREAT!  No problems whatsoever with this recipe.  I used miniature chocolate chips when I made this along with some homemade vanilla ice cream and--voila!--great cookie dough ice cream.  I have also doubled this recipe with wonderful success!

My husband LOVES cookie dough.  I will never let him eat it when I'm baking because it has eggs in it (and because that's one less cookie!).  So, for a special treat, I made this for him last night.  He LOVED it!  I added M&Ms and put it in a roll of foil then stuck it in the freezer until we were ready.  I didn't think it made enough, so I made two batches.  He ate one up last night, and told me this morning that he can't wait until he eats the other tonight!  Bravo!

Love this! After getting sick of buying cookie dough ice cream in the store and never having enough "cookie dough" or it was too salty tasting, I decided to make my own. The kids and I love it! I leave the chocolate chips out and we use it for vanilla ice cream and can load up as much dough as we want.  Been making this for about 2 years now.

I will make it again!  I LOVED the taste of the faux cookie dough!  It gave me the guilty pleasure that I crave without the expensive price of market cookie dough ice cream and without the question of whether or not I will get ill from E. Coli.  THANK YOU!  I will tell my friends indeed about this recipe!

As written it's not very good. Bland and lacks all fun that you want out of cookie dough ice cream. 
I added extra brown sugar and a quarter cup of cocoa powder.

Oh my goodness it's so good!!!!! I made @giggletush 's recipe, except with no salt, and I used a 1/4 cup semi-sweet regular sized chocolate chips :) Tastes just like normal cookie dough, except you can eat the whole bowl and not get a stomach ache!! :D

Reinvented with vanilla almond milk instead if water, doubled the recipe, added 1c chocolate chips and 1/2c all natural peanut butter. My GF friends could do this with coconut flour, and there's arguably enough oil in the peanut butter to leave out the butter. Oh and my chocolate chips are soy, so this recipe could arguably be made vegan.

I made this using the suggestions in the reviews. Oh. Ma. Gawd. The most delicious thing ever. I could just eat the cookie dough by itself. I did manage to keep enough to put in some home made chocolate ice cream. Simply delicious. I would give this a million stars if I could.

Yummy! It really tastes great! I followed the recipe but added 1 tsp. baking soda and 1 tsp. vanilla and a little salt. Very good!

I was suprized at how much it made!! It wasn't the same consistantcy as normal dough, but that didn't matter a whole lot. I thought the fact that it's eggless was fantastic!! Does regular cookie dough ice cream use eggs??   Well, thank you!! Maybe my brother will eat this instead of my dough!! :]

Perfect for when you want to eat some cookie dough. Halved the recipe because it was just to eat :P 4 stars because - too sweet, I used a little less sugar the second time, and used more brown and less white sugar, because I prefer brown sugar. Also added chocolate chips and raisins.

This is very sweet.  The kids loved it but I thought it was just a little too sweet.

Great recipe! Was in the mood for something sweet but didn't feel like baking. With this the dough is whipped up in seconds and then put into the freeze, simple.
