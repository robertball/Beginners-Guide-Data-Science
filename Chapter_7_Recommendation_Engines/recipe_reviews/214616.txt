I had just been given some fava beans and was searching for a recipe to use them when this one popped up.  It sounded very interesting and I had everything on hand except for the fresh thyme. I halved the recipe, made it as is and it has a lot of interesting flavors going on and is a very filling soup. My personal preferences: I found the beef broth too heavy for all the spring veggies.  When I make it again, I will try it with chicken or veggie stock and switch out the veal for ground chicken.  Definitely worth trying!
