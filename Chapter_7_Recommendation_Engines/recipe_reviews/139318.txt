I followed this recipe as exactly as I could with the ingredients on hand...peanuts instead of walnuts, ground flaxseed instead of brewer's yeast, no dry milk powder, and regular peanut butter. I think it tastes fantastic! My only criticism is that it didn't clump up like regular granola, though my substitutions probably accounted for getting the proportions off. When I make it again, I'll go a little lighter on the oats to make sure there's enough wet ingredients to make sure it sticks together.

I didn't really like this recipe-- it has a lot of ingredients that made it extremely dry and not very flavorful.  The nuts got burned halfway through, so my granola had clumps of burned nuts.  I wouldn't make this again, but if I did, I'd do this: ~ reduce the dry milk powder by A LOT, ~ up the sugar just a little bit, or add some honey, ~ add more water, ~ throw the nuts in after the first 10 minutes.

Based on reviews I omitted the milk powder, slightly decreased the dry ingredients (cut a little off the nuts and the whole wheat flour, and omitted the brewer's yeast), then slightly increased the wet ingredients. This came out super tasty! Lightly peanut butter flavored, perfectly toasted oats. I used regular Jif creamy peanut butter and it wasn't overly salty. Very tasty. Good base mix - you could stir in some dried cranberries and or chocolate chips after it cooled - I think a little more nuts in the mix would be nice too.

I made this recipe very  close to as written using ingredients I had on hand.  I used regular crunchy peanut butter and omitted the salt and powdered milk. I used pecans for the nuts.  It is very flavorful and the fact that it does not clump together doesn't bother me because I like it on yogurt and fruit.  The flavors come through nicely and you do have to watch carefully to prevent burning.  It helped to have the racks high up in the oven, remember to stir every 15 minutes and rotate the cookie sheets.  Thank you for sharing - this will become my regular recipe for granola.
