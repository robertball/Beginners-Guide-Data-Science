5 stars for flavor, but 3 for execution.    The recipe makes me wonder if this was actually tested in the Instant Pot.   The meat mixture is great, but after you stuff the 2 halves of squash, it is impossible to fit them both in the pot without 1 tipping.   I had to pressure cook them one at a time.   Then realized 4 min, plus 7 min release was still not enough to cook the squash, it was still hard, so it took forever.    Next time I will cook the 2 halves of squash alone in the pot, which I know only takes 6 minutes.   Cook the meat mixture on the stove, and this meal could have been done in 15 min.

Awesome,  loved it.  Didn't have a instant pot. Baked the squash in the oven first then added the sausage mixture and returned to the oven to heat marinara sauce and melt the cheese. My husband and I both really liked it.

I don't have an Instapot so adapted for oven/stove method. Halved the acorn squash and put in a 450 oven for 30 minutes. Cooked the sausage, onion & pepper on the stove, added other ingredients then stuffed the squash.  Reduced oven to 400 and baked another 30 - 35 minutes.  The marinara and vegetables with the squash created a unique but pleasing flavor. I didn't care for the sausage but it may have been the brand. It was a nice change of pace dinner. Thank you

I used PRIMO sausage, one hot and two sweet, which provided a nice balance.  I don't have a pressure cooker, so I put a little water in the bottom of an oven proof skillet and baked it at 375 for about 30 minutes.  One thing I really like about this recipe is that it's meaty and hearty.  All too often you find recipes for acorn squash that are sweet.  This one is filling and I only ate 1/4 of it.  Also, I think you could make many variations according to your own taste.

Like others, I don’t have an Insta-pot.  Thank you Frosty Cat for the temps and times to make it in the oven.  They worked great.  I used 3 large garlic cloves and twice as much oregano, both of which I added to the mixture and cooked for a couple of minutes before adding the marinara sauce.  I will definitely make again!

The taste of the filling was great but the squash could have used a little more time. The next time I make it I will use 6 minutes instead of 4.
Well, I tried 6 minutes and the squash was still a little hard so I will not make it again in the instant pot but in the Micro where I've made it before but I will use the filling.

i made this tonite  without the 'insta pot' (what IS that anyway?)I had 2 acorn squash so I doubled the contents... --I also added one small zucchini, chopped, into the sausage 'saute' mix... Deeee lish!  I did not add the extra tomato sauce; I like it without a real tomatoey taste.  It WAS time consuming-- but it was my 1st time, and next time will go faster.

Quick and easy, flexible and tasty. Would suggest a sprinkling of kosher or sea salt and accompany with a salad of your choice

I didn’t have an insta pot but I cooked in the oven for an hour!
The stuffing was good. I used spicy sausage and it was to spicy hot. 
I couldn’t taste the squash ! 
If I make again it will be with a mild sausage !

Both halves of the squash do not fit in the pot, so had to cook them separately, and they did not cook completely at 4 minutes. Whole process took longer than using conventional methods would have. A little bland on flavor for us. I added some celery salt and cayenne pepper, my husband added different spices to his.

I used manual set for 8 minutes and the squash did not get done. Next time I will presteam squash alone in IP for six minutes, then stuff and cook for 4 more. The recipe itself is delicious. I will make it again.

Following directions in the comments made this worth it.  I made the filling on the stove and cooked the squash in the pressure cooker for about 12 minutes.  It was delicious.

I really liked this dish on a cold winter night! I used a very small buttercup squash the first time because it was what the store had. Buttercup is my favorite, and it was very happy with the results, buttery and creamy. I just made it again using the acorn squash and was not as happy. Firmer and more stringy. Used Instant pot to cook the squash, but baked it in the oven as another reviewer recommended. Will make this with buttercup again and again.

Definitely needed to use smaller squash. I used hamburger since I didnt have sausage. Need to use more sauce since burger is drier than sausage. Good flavor. Husband approved. Will make this again.

I did not have pankocrumbs or mozzarella cheese. I used grated Parmesan cheese instead. It was my first time using the instant pot and I felt a little over whelmed using it. My husband used it the night before for his first time and helped me with it. I did not have all my prep done when I started sauteing sausage as I was dicing bell pepper and onion. The sausage was starting to stick. I began stirring it as I added the other ingredients.  It still turned out good and I will most likely make it again having prep done. I might try mushrooms diced and use the mozzarella instead

I made this recipe twice and pretty much followed the recipe as outlined. I did increase the cook time to 7-8 minutes both times. The second time I subbed in Boca Crumbles for the IS in the final stir before stuffing The result wasn’t as good as the first time. It was eminently palatable but a tad mushy.

Like Nancy, I don't have an Instant Pot so I baked the Acorn Squash and made the sauce separately but followed the recipe ingredients exactly except for adding extra mozzarella over the final Marinara sauce before reheating.  My only critique is I feel it needs more marinara sauce as it was a bit dry.  But we loved the taste and plan to make it again.  Chris

The stuffing i made exactly as directed but i did not put the 2nd 1/4 cup marinara on when finished.... just my preference. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Didn't have an Instant Pot so cooked the acorn squash in the microwave and then added the sausage and other ingredients and heated it in the microwave.

This was delicious!  I used ground turkey (I'm on Weight Watchers) and added spices to make it more sausage like.  I would use a smaller squash next time as I had to trim a bit off my halves to fit in my 6 qt instant pot.  I found the meal very filling!

Will definitely make this squash dish again! Cooking squash can be challenging, getting it done completely cooked to the point where it is soft without part of being hard. The Instapot  cooked it to where we had no waste. The only change I made in the recipe was substituting pepper jack cheese. Turned out Excellent! 
Made my own marinara sauce with tomato paste.

My family absolutely loved this recipe.  Even my vegetable adverse son devoured it.  The Instantpot made it simple to prepare.  Can't get more than one-half acorn squash in pot (6 qt size) at a time, which lengthens cooking time when making several.   Well worth the trouble, though!

I used chicken Italian saussage, added mushrooms. When I reheated leftovers. I poured about one third cup pinot grigio in the pan and a little extra sauce on top. Yum

Made it to the recipe. It could have cooked a little longer on high pressure, the squash was still a little hard. But other than that...very tasty.

Loved the stuffing, not the squash.  Will make the stuffing again, but with pasta.

I used my Instant Pot for the first time yesterday and made this stuffed acorn squash.  It was delicious!!  As another reviewer said, both halves would not fit in the pot without tipping one  or the other but that worked ok.  I had to add extra minutes because it was only about half done at 4 minutes.  So I added another 4 minutes and it was perfect.  I could only eat half as my squash was large so I'll eat the other half for another dinner.
