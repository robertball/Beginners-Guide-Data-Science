We enjoyed this recipe very much, and it was very quick and easy.  We added two extra cloves of garlic, used cream of chicken soup (we're not mushroom fans), I think we also used less pasta (measuring pasta is always challenging to me) and with that and a little salt and pepper it was very good!  Thanks for this great idea.

I modified this recipe a little bit to make it healthier: I put in two carrots, one tomato and a red bell pepper. I steamed the veggies before adding the sauce, then used half the amount of soup the recipe asked for and added 1/2 cup of rice milk. The result was delicious -- definitely a keeper!

We thought the sauce was bland & heavy.  I microwaved the broccoli 1st for a little while before adding it to the sauce.  I also added fresh mushrooms & thinly sliced chicken to the recipe.  Even with parmesan-romano cheese, it was "blah" tasting.

This was pretty good - not very subtle flavors, certainly, but very easy to prepare and pretty healthy if you use low-fat cream of mushroom soup.  Next time I'll try adding chicken.

A good starting point for pasta primavera--definitely not the best I've ever had because it's a bit bland--I added basil and diced onion to give it more flavor.  I also added a bit more milk and stirred in some finely shredded mozzarella cheese to jazz it up.  To make life a little simplier, I also used a 16 oz. frozen bag of broccoli, carrots, and cauliflower.  Overall a good, basic recipe, but it definitely needs spices added to it.

Used 2 lbs of penne pasta, a whole bag of frozen broccoli and a whole bag of frozen carrots, 4 cans of cream of mushroom soup, 1 1/2 cups of milk, half a cup of Parmesan cheese and everyone LOVED this recipe.  The only change I would make is to add more vegetables to it as I was told by my son.

This is a good basic recipe.  The best thing about it is that you can add to it as you want.  I also saute mushrooms and onions along with the garlic.  To make a complete meal, I add chopped chicken.  Sometimes I use cream of chicken soup and low fat sour cream instead of milk.  Also, of course, you can use whatever pasta you have around.

Very yummy!  used multigrain spaghetti, frozen broccoli (added at the last 3 min of cooking the sauce) 1 stalk of celery and 2 med carrots, 2 garlic cloves. Used 3/4 cup 'silk' soymilk (had no milk in house at the time) used campbell's brand condensed cr. of mushroom soup. Added a bit of water, but dont think it would need it next time (was concerned with extra carrot absorbing too much!)  May try to make this from scratch and may also add some different veggies next time. Excellent Vegetarian dish!  Might even be good with cut up soy hot dogs in it! Will make again!

I liked this recipe - it wasn't incredible, but tasty (fiance liked it too, and he's picky).  The only change I made was to add a can of mushrooms.  Next time I may add another 1/2 a can of soup or some more milk, it seemed to need a little more sauce.

I made a larger quantity and used a can of cream of chicken and a can of cream of celery instead of the mushroom.  I also add cooked chicken.
