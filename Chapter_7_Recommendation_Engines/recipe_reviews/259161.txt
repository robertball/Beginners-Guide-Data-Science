Made with what was handy.  Used sweet fresh pitted cherries and vanilla extract.  Cherries stayed lovely and juicy.  Very yummy.

I did not have enough cherries so I made the clafoutis with strawberries (sliced and floured), raspberries, and cherries (halved with the stones removed).  This was a big breakfast hit and I’m sure I’ll be making it again and experimenting with more summer fruits
