It was good. I cooked it for maybe 2 hours and it still was tender.

Taste like the cabbage I fell in love with as a youth.  The cabbage was tender and sweet (where'd that come from?)  I used maple bacon and just loved this recipe.

If you like more of the savory cabbage flavor, I would recommend omitting the vinegar. A good addition would be to use chicken broth instead of water.

This recipe is an old family favorite. I don’t add the flour and it tastes delicious!

I made this recipe one night and it was SUPER GOOD !   My fiancé is very health and taste conscious and he said the flavor was incredible.   
The next day he found a recipe for "Healing Soup" and it was a similar recipe with one addition, stewed or cut up tomatoes.   
I added the extras and had a SECOND SUPER MEAL !    So this recipe is very versatile.     Eat it as the Chef posted or add stewed tomatoes and have a second super supper that's Healing to boot.

Loved it. 
Added a bit of garlic powder, tomato paste, and a dash of hot sauce. 

Also I used beef stock instead of water. 

Freezes well so make a ton of it.

Cooked about four hours, used just a bit less bacon. Very tasty! Reminded me of when my Mom cooked cabbage many years ago.
