This was very good.  My kids loved it!  I did use one can of beef broth instead of water.  I also toasted provolone cheese on the buns before serving.  YUM!

So great and easy! I used 1 packet salad dressing mix, beef broth instead of water, onion, fresh garlic, a bay leaf, black pepper and worcestershire sauce.I toasted the hoagie rolls and melted provolone on them. Everyone loved them , including my five year old son. No leftovers....I will be using this recipe again-yummy!

Excellent!!  I used 1-1/2 pounds of sirloin, so only needed one-half amount of water and one packet of Italian seasoning.  After slow cooking for 8 hours, the meat shredded so well!  My hubby loved it, and will definitely be making this again!!

OMG this is an awesome recipe! My mother in-law said it was the best she's ever had. Followed the recipe as it is, didn't change a thing, it turned out perfect. I also toasted each hoagie with a couple pieces of provalone under the broiler. The whole family loved it, I will be making this again.

Thank you for all of your great reviews!!Instead of using water, I now use Italian dressing! A small roast is never enough at my house! The bigger the better!!

This was really simple and tasted great. I added the pepper rings in and was worried about people not liking them because of the peppers however once the peppers sat in the crock pot a while, you could hardly taste them. I also added in some onions. Next time I will add more peppers.

This turned out awesome.  I picked up a powdered mix of au jus for dipping along with the gravy. Everyone ate it up.

Hard to go wrong with this one! I used my own Italian seasoning instead of the salad dressing mix, and used beef broth instead of the water. Nummy sandwiches! Toast your buns, dip them in the broth, then add the beef and provolone cheese. Make sure to grab some of the peppers!

This was a pretty good recipe.  I read the reviews/updates and used Italian dressing instead of water.  I didn't measure it and then when I went to bed I added another cup of water to make sure it didn't burn.  It tasted fantastic when I first tried it, but was kind of tangy the next day.  I still thought it was a perfect home recipe for Italian Beef.  I'm going to try again for a party Super Bowl Sunday and use the original recipe.

This was very good.  I used a bottle of beer instead of water and also used 1 small jar of roasted red peppers aside from the banana peppers.  It wasn't spicy... just right.  Great served on a toasted bun with melted cheese.

Absolutely scrumptious!  I halved the recipe with a 2 lb roast for my family and ended up with 4 healthy-sized haogies, with enough left over for maybe one more not so healthy-sized hoagie.  Not sure how a 4 lb roast would make 18 hoagies (as per the recipe), but maybe the buns were small! At any rate, it sure was delicious and I will definitely be making it again. Thanks for a wonderful meal!

I just made this and tasted the meat as I was pulling it apart. It was amazing. I added the banana peppers and dumped in the juice as suggested. It ruined the whole thing. I'm not a fan of banana peppers but thought they wouldn't be that noticable. Will make again and did give a rating of 5 stars as without the peppers the recipe was amazing. If you're not a fan of banana peppers, don't take the risk and ruin the whole thing. Leave them out or add when making sandwhich. Tomorrow I'll put the meat back on after totally draining and try to weaken the taste with more beef bullion. I followed the recipe exactly and it did take the full 8 hours to cook the meat.

Great! We loved it!! I too used broth instead of water, toasted the buns, and melted provolone cheese on before adding meat. I didn't dump the jar of peppers in because i have non-pepper-people in my house... So added juice to taste and peppers to sandwiches to those that wanted. Everyone liked it a lot!

This was sooo good.  The kids don't care for peppers so I added them after I put the meat on the sandwiches.  This also kept the 'snap' in the peppers.  The kids had theirs plain and raved about the taste.  AWESOME!  I'll be making this again, and again, and...

We loved these hoagies....I also cut the roast in half, and used only 1 packet of seasoning and 1 cup of water. Half the jar of peppers....They were incredible. When ready to eat, I placed the sandwiches on a baking sheet with the meat inside and added some swiss cheese on top. Broiled them only a few minutes. PERFECT!!! Will make them often. Thanks

The Italian salad dressing mix seasons this tender beef so perfectly that I couldn't even think of anything to add. I did leave out the pepper rings as we don't prefer them. These are always DELICIOUS and turn out PERFECTLY every time with no effort at all!
