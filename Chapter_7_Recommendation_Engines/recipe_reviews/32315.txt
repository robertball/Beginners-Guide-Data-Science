Ohhhhhh, this was SO nice!  I used less liqueur in general than called for, Godiva White Chocolate liqueur rather than creme de cacao and eliminated the Grand Marnier altogether (never did care for orange flavored liqueur). This really was a pleasant blend of flavors and an indulgent after dinner treat.

Very good recipe! If you like liqueurs, this is great. For those of you who don't like a really strong alcohol taste, try cutting the amount of liqueurs in half.

This was really good.  I didn't have any creme de cacao liqueur, so I subbed Godiva liqueur and it turned out fine.  I also went heavy on the whipped cream.  YUM!!

I loved this! I didn't use as much chocolate as called for...I just hit my cup w/ a squirt or two. I had this as an after-dinner coffee & it was the perfect finish...thanks!

This will definitely keep you warm on a cold winter's night!  I did not have all of the specific liquors recommended.  My mix consisted of Kahlua, Bailey's Irish Cream, Godiva White Chocolate Liqueur and Cointreau.

A very different cup of coffee. I did not care for the Grande  Mariner liquor the rest were delicious especially with the whip.

Based on what I had on hand, I used Triple Sec instead of Grand Marnier, and I didn't have any chocolate syrup. But it was still very yummy!
