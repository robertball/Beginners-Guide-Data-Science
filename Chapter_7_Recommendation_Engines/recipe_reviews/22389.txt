5 stars after several changes. Melted 1/4 cup butter in bottom of the pan 1st. Added 1/3 cup bisquick to the egg/milk mixture. Used homemade white bread (no crust) and mixed it into the egg mixture. Then poured the mixture over the melted butter. Baked at 400 for 20-25 minutes. Served it topped w/ syrup and homemade sweetened whipped cream.
One last thing, I dont appreciate the person who (just a few comments down) blasted people for commenting on ways in which they had to or wanted to change the recipe. FYI: some people dont always have all the exact ingredients on hand and have to improvise or sometimes they just change things because they feel like it; Nothing wrong with that! By stating these improvisations, they are helping other people who don't have all the exact ingredients on hand or helping the people who don't always want to follow recipes to the T. Once again, nothing wrong w/ that!

With some minor tweaking, I made this a "keeper".  Deleted the margarine, added 1 1/2 cups more bread, 1/4 c brown sugar, 3 oz cream cheese and 1/4 c pankcake syrup.  Also, doubled the cinnamon and added about 1 t nutmeg.  Mix the cream cheese with the eggs, one at a time.  Add in the rest of the ingredients EXCEPT the bread & mix well.  Then stir in the bread and pour the mixture into a prepared 9X15 pan and let sit for about 15 minutes.  (I used white sandwhich bread, lightly toasted.  If you're using a hard, dry bread, overnight would be best.)  Bake at 350 for about 20 minutes.  This came out perfect and my boys' finicky taste buds LOVED it!  Additionally, I've made this with cinnamon raisin bread. Ooohh, YUM!  A big hit at church!

haha! Now children please... I have been using this site for many years. I joined today because this discussion is so funny. Haven't made this recipe yet. May, may not. Looks like a 5 star to me though. Ok here are the facts: Reviewing a recipe which you have changed in not reviewing the recipe... I seldom follow a recipe exactly just because its the way I am. I like to play. The only way to review a recipe is to make it as its described and then rate it. If you change things the next time then say Its rated () as is but... I found it much better when I made it with "these changes". Or add a custom version to the custom version tab (should be obvious). Don't make changes and rate the recipe as you changed it because then its not the recipe we are evaluating and it isnt helpful to anyone and its then just an ego trip you are on. There is nothing wrong with suggesting alternatives that you like but its not fair to any of us if you rate anything other than the original... Sorry thats just the honest facts people. I do love to read about the alternatives don't get me wrong. I just don't like when a cook reviews the recipe based on those changes. By all means HAVE FUN and BE CREATIVE!!!! Haha..

It not out of the oven yet but it smells and looks wonderful!  
For the cook who doesn't like people experimenting........honey, that is the heart and soul of cooking!  I like the reviews because I can see what works and what doesn't and exchange ideas with other cooks.  
For the people who got soggy bread, try using larger chunks of bread and maybe a shallower pan like a large cookie sheet with sides.  
What I did:  eyeballed the eggs and milk, yep I like to live dangeriously! Mixed up the custard in a measuring cup using 3 eggs to start and eyeballing the milk and sugar, used cinnamon and nutmeg, vanilla and a shot of brandy for extra flavor.  Poured the custard over the bread in a bowl and mixed it with my hands to see how the dry/wet ratio was.  Needed more wet so mixed another egg with a little milk and there you go!  Placed it in a single layer in a greased pan, sprinkled on more sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg and drizzled with melted butter.  
This recipe is so versitle you could use egg nog in place of the milk for holidays or add cubes of cream cheese and or strawberry preserves for a stuffed french toast, even adding a little orange peel would change the flavor.  Be creative, have fun!

This was really good, and unlike other reviewers; we didn't have a problem with the middle of the casserole being goopy (although I did bake it for longer than suggested; 60 minutes).  I changed the recipe only slightly, instead of adding 1 1/2 cups of milk, I added 1/2 cup of egg nog, about 1/4 cup of half and half cream (just to finish up what I had on hand), and topped it up with milk to equal 1 1/2 cups.  The egg nog gave this dish an excellent flavour, next time I will add 1 cup of egg nog and the rest milk or cream.

Pretty good.  I had half a loaf of bread that was just about to go stale so I thought I'd give this a try. I sprayed the bottom of my pan with Pam for baking and left out the margarine.  I added some nutmeg and a little more vanilla.  This took over an hour to bake.  But, even though it was a little mushy when I first cut it, I let it sit for about fifteen minutes (not intentional) and it firmed right up.  I sprinkled a little confectioners sugar on top and served it with butter and maple syrup.  It was even better the next day out of the microwave!

Fabulous!  Definitely a hit with the kids. I've made this several times and it is so easy.  A few times I have used the King's Hawaiian rolls and refrigerated overnight before cooking. YUMMY!

This recipe was great... we loved it. I used one raisin bagel as part of the 5 cups of bread. Because the bagel was denser bread the liquid required was perfect. I also used 1/4 cup of French Vanilla coffee creamer to thicken the milk and give it more of a vanilla flavor.

It was pretty good and really easy.  I made it in a 9*13 inch pan, it was all I had.  It reminded me of rice pudding. without the raisains.  It had a custardy feel and taste to it.  I liked the top and sides.  It also puffs too as it cooks.  It fed 2 adults and one 5 year old and 2 2 year olds.  My 5 year old who could live on "eggy bread" didn't care for it.  The 2 year olds loved it.

I do not like french toast, but my husband loves it. So I made this thinking there might be a chance I might like it baked, plus it seemed quicker. I just made a few SLIGHT changes: 1) Bread cubes to bread dough 2) egg and milk batter to tomato sauce and 3) syrup to cheese and pepperoni. Again, I normally don't like french toast, but this recipe is TOPS!

This casserole was DELICIOUS! I did make it in a 11x7 baking dish, followed the recipe except I added the teaspoon of cinnamon to the egg mixture along with about 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, poured it over the bread and tossed to coat. While that was sitting for 10 mins. I made a simple praline topping of 1/2c. butter, 1/2c. packed brown sugar, 1/2c. chopped pecans, 1 tbsp. light corn syrup, a heaping 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. ground nutmeg-combine all in a small saucepan, bring to a boil and remove from heat, spread evenly over soaked bread. It only took about 35 mins. to bake, but my oven is really hot. Anyway, fantastic base recipe and very delicious results. My 2 year old son loved it. Will be making this again!!

Holy Cow!  This was fabulous.  I used egg bread and used a 9x13 pan.  It was not as eggy this way but had the texture of french toast.  Not a morsel left on Christmas morning. Edit on Jan 3...I forgot to say I added 1t of cinnamon to egg mixture and put it together the night before so it soaked up the batter overnight.  Hope this is helpful.

Nice recipe! Would love to try it with challah bread or maybe even some apples, nuts and raisins thrown in. I love the fact that we can review recipes on this site and see what suggestions other cooks have made. Some recipes will end up being a disaster if certain changes aren't made. Plus, those of us who are real cooks can spot a recipe that might need some tweaking or could be improved with the additions or deletions of some ingredients. That's the beauty of cooking..creativity and flexibility. I really appreciate the people who take the time to write reviews and share their ideas. What I don't appreciate are the people who write angry negative reviews and criticize other reviewers' right to use a recipe as they wish. Many recipes on this site are just a base for something grander. To the lady who went off on the people who alter recipes... lighten up! Don't read the reviews if you can't stand other people's ideas and feel you must be rigid and do everything as written. Find another site to dump your negativity because allrecipes is not the place for nasty criticism. Anyone that cooks with that type of bad energy will surely leave a bad taste in everyone's mouth!

This is really good! My kids are french toast obsessed so of course they loved it.  Also, had to laugh at the person who said they hate reviewers who correct recipes but then you click on their profile and their reviews are full of corrections on other ones! ha!   FYI-- I happen to love suggestions on recipes so keep them coming! It saves me from wasting money on something if it just isn't working in a recipe. Who wants to spend all that time (and money) to make a mistake on a recipe that someone else also made and could have helped you prevent? Keep them coming!

This was delicious.  I did not modify this recipe. I used a 9 x 13 pan and the only thing that I would do different next time I make this would be to grease the pan a little more generously with butter.   The casserole stuck to the bottom of the pan making it a bit messy for cleanup.  Thanks for sharing!

Ths was AWESOME and extremely easy. I scaled it up to feed around 75 people this weekend. I used French bread torn into big chunks, and instead of pouring the custard over the bread I just threw the bread into the custard mixture and combined it all with my hands, then let it sit in the fridge overnight. I mixed all of the sugar into the custard instead of sprinkling the top. In a big pan, approximately 24x16, it took nearly two hours to bake, just fyi. It was a HUGE hit. Great recipe!

I love these casserole type breakfast recipes, esp. when company comes.  So simple - thanks!  Oh, one other thing.  I understand the person who is bothered by reviewers' changes.  I think it helps if you mention the changes you made AFTER making the recipe AS IS first.  That way you can state why you tweaked it.  Helps those of us who haven't tried the recipe yet.

Great starter recipe.  This is a perfect canvas for a little culinary creativity. Make this recipe your own with the addition of pecans, raisins, berries, chocolate chips, bananas, or anything else your heart desires.  Since I wanted to rate the actual recipe, I added only a pinch of nutmeg this time around.  I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 13x9 inch foil pan.  A one-pound loaf of sturdy French bread yielded just the right amount of bread cubes.  Cube the bread the night before to save time.  This is a great use for stale bread.  Thumbs up from all three hungry kids!

Very yummy. I will probably make this at least twice a month. It was a great way to use up leftover bread. I used whole wheat homemade bread cut into 1.5"x1.5" cubes. I spread a double recipe out on a big sheet pan, and I'm really glad that I did, because the best part of this recipe is the crispy top. It was also nice and puffed kind of like a pastry. I think if it was thicker and in a smaller pan it would be soggy in the middle. I baked it at 400 degrees. I sprinkled powdered sugar on the top when it was done. It was very delicious. Yes, it isn't extremely sweet or flavorful, but with syrup it's just the right amount of sweetness. My family said to make it again.

Great recipe. Here are my changes. I used French Bread from a bakery, reduced the milk to 3/4 of a cup, combined the egg mixture with the bread in a bowl and tossed then let it sit for 10 minutes. Place in an 8 x 8 pan, top with 1 cup frozen blueberries, then 2 tbl brown sugar mixed with cinnamon and nutmeg.  Baked covered at 350 for 15 minutes, uncovered for 30.  Served with warm syrup.  It was perfect.

I make this a lot using Apple Fritter bread from Walmart. My eldest loves to help put the casserole ingredients together. Sometimes, I'll add a grated apple and raisins in for texture and added vitamins.

Follow the recipes exactly and mine turned out really bland.  Maybe next time I'll add more sugar and cinnamon or orange juice.

I would like to say that I prepared the recipe exactly as is...but I didn't.  I made A LOT of changes.  And that was because of the reviews of so many others.  First:  I used Texas toast, but into cubes.  I put them on a baking sheet in a 350 degree oven for 15 minutes to lightly toast.  Then I put them in a lightly greased 9x13 pyrex pan.  I also used sugar-free French vanilla non-dairy creamer versus milk - this greatly enhanced the vanilla taste.  I also put a little cinnamon in the liquid mixture.  When I poured the mixture over the bread, I pressed on each piece to ensure the bread absorbed the liquid.  Then I covered it, and put it in the fridge overnight.  The next morning, I brought it to room temp, then dotted with softened butter and sprinkled the cinnamon/sugar mixture over the top.  It only cooked for about 40 minutes, and I let it rest for 5 minutes before serving.  No syrup was necessary.  It was amazing!

Great overall concept but with minor tweaking can be made into a way better dish using the same ingredients!  I've made this a few times and have came to the conclusion that this is best in a 9x13. Also add more sugar, cinnamon and vanilla to suit your taste. I put foil over the top as to not over cook the top of it. While it is cooking I also open the oven and take a knife and cut into it, as too open it up a bit and allow for more thorough cooking, I do that about 3 times and it's never soggy!

Overall this was a good recipe.  I should have taken the advice of others to reduce the liquid.  I'm going to try it again with only 1 cup rather than 1 1/2 cups of milk.  I had to increase baking time to a little over an hour because of following the recipe, and it was still somewhat soupy.

I used leftover French Bread and stuck to the recipe except added a smidge more cinnamon, and this was wonderful!  I made it at night for my hubby to take to work in the very early am, and the house smelled soooo delish I had some for dessert.  It was just as good 2 days later when the kids had it for breakfast.

5 stars for a great recipe. It was easy to make and tasted delicious. I used a baguette and about 8 slices of potato bread. That turned out to be a good combination because it wasn't mushy at all. The baguette held its shape while the potato bread absorbed a lot of liquid. I made it in a 9 x 13 pan and added an egg and some milk to make more liquid. Covered the dish for 30 minutes then removed the foil for the last 15 minutes. I used spray at the bottom of the nonstick but it still stuck a little. It was perfect! UPDATE: Made this again in a glass 8 x 8 pan with lots of nonstick spray. No sticking issues at all. Didn't need to cover with foil. This time I used 1/2 loaf of challah bread and 1/2 baguette. I think the key to good texture is that half of the bread used should have a thicker crust that will hold its shape when mixed with the egg mixture.

This recipe is awesome!! Tastes like bread pudding. I have made it twice, once even using left over hot dog buns! I have a couple of tips: Cut your bread with scissors to keep it fluffy. Also, don't use all the liquid mixture. Just pour it over slowly until your bread is just lightly soaked. How much liquid you need can vary greatly depending on the type of bread you are using!

Here is the secret to this basic recipe.  Use raisin or blueberry bread and cube.  let the bread dry out overnight and then add the liquid ingredients and refrigerate overnight so the bread can soak up the egg mixture.  Its not so eggy if you let it soak and marinate overnight.  Be creative and add what you want in the way of more fruit etc.  Great basic recipe!  thanks for sharing.

Made this yesterday morning for our seven children and two teenage girls that spent the night at our home...doubled the recipe and it was amazing, used 13x9 pan and added just a little bit of cinnamon to the egg mixture as well. This turned out beautifully, everyone loved it and even though it was served with scrambled eggs and bacon the whole pan was consumed. The pickiest (11 yr old) had four servings...lol

I really liked the foundation for this, however; I followed the recipe EXACTLY and the middle of it was still goopy.  I kept it in the oven longer and the middle was still mushy.  Next time, I will try using less liquid.

Really good!  I made everything the night before so all I had to do was assemble and bake the next morning.  Would make a great "company" recipe by doubling up and baking in a 9 x 13 pan.  A lot less time than standing at the stove making pan after pan of traditional french toast.

This is a great way to get rid of any bread leftovers! (Warning! This is another one of those reviews that "change" things...though I prefer to think of the changes as suggestions or alternates, in case you don't have something on hand. Plus, it's really cool to see what others have done with a recipe. I'm also a big fan of incorporating leftovers into later meals so they don't go to waste...)

Anyway--I was trying to get rid of some day(s) old pound cake when I came  across this recipe, so that's what I used instead of regular bread. (it was Cream Cheese Pound Cake III from All Recipes, and we'd had it with fruit and whipped cream a couple days before..Very good!)

I sliced the cake into thick strips and spread them out in a tightly packed single layer at the bottom of a 9*13 Pyrex pan. I put the filled dish in a slightly warmed oven while preparing the topping to crisp it up a bit. 

I followed the topping ingredients pretty closely--though I did reduce the sugar to 1/2 tsp (pound cake has more than enough), adding a little more cinnamon and vanilla to taste, leftover peach/applesauce, (about 1/2 cup) and a generous dollop of maple syrup. 

I poured the mixture over the pound cake slices and left it in the fridge overnight. It didn't "puff" up as much as bread would have, but it came out smelling, looking, and tasting just great! I sprinkled the top lightly with powdered sugar while it was cooling.

It wasn't too soggy, (the larger pan really helped with that) tasted exactl

Just made this - delicious - for those of you who stated that the MIDDLE WAS RUNNY or NOT COOKED ENOUGH, you need to set the cooking pan on another pan filled with about an inch of water thereby creating a bath in the oven.  This will set the custard.

Yummy...5-6 slices of bread equated to 4 cups, I toasted the bread and cubed.  I used brown sugar in place of white sugar, and I served with sugar free syrup.  This is definitely a guest delight.

I have to agree with both sides of the previous reviews, this was kinda mushy but it was very good. I cooked it a little longer than the recipe called for, 65 minutes. I doubled the recipe, so it basically took a whole loaf of bread, and there's no way I would have tried to make a loaf of bread into french toast it would take forever! This will be a good one for the bridal showers and bacherlor party mornings I have coming up in the next couple of  months. Thanks for the great recipe!

Very easy-to-follow recipe and the end result is yummy!!! Instead of milk I used heavy whipping cream because I wanted it to be a bit thicker and it came out perfect and with a little maple syrup on top…YUM! This is a keeper!!! Oh, I forgot, I left it overnight to set and before I put it in the oven I patted butter on top and sprinkled the sugar-cinammon mix on top.

This recipe is very good as is. I find it very irritating when people change the recipe and then rate it. I’d like to say to them you didn’t rate this recipe you rated your own. Anyway, my family enjoyed it. I baked it in a 350 degree F. convection oven for 50 minutes and the center was done perfectly. Thank you STARFLOWER!

My son is on a gluten free diet.  I made bisquick's gluten free pancake mix, fried up 2 big pancakes, cut them up into cubes in place of bread, and non fat mil instead of reg. milk (to cut down on the fat content).  Also replace the margarine for butter (not more than the tbsp to avoid the fat and dairy.  Those sensitive to these ingredients needs to choose them cautiously).  This is a real good recipe, low in sugar, tasty.  It's more like a custard once you let it cool down in the middle with a crunchy topping.  Very, very tasty!

I guess this is just a matter of taste, my kids really liked it, but my husband & I didn't. I thought it was too mushy, maybe this would be better with a firmer bread. Also, even though I greased the pan, as directed, mine stuck pretty bad.

It was good, but a little plain.  I used a 13 x 9 pan because the 9 x 9 seemed too small.  I stirred everything before adding the cinnamon-sugar on top because some of the bread pieces were completely saturated while others were dry.  I think this helped with the soggy mess that other people referred to.  I think using a sweeter bread (I just used plain white bread) would be a good idea, plus add extra cinnamon to the milk-egg mixture  for a stronger flavor.

Sorry, but I agree with Pattippopidoo - if you change the recipe so much that it is no longer this recipe, then go post it as a new recipe and rate this one based on the ingredients and directions.

I agree with Pattipoopidoo about rating the original recipe after making changes.  One of the changes by a reviewer is more of a mixture for bread pudding.  Either it is rated with no alterations or it is used as a 'base' for adding other ingredients to your personal taste but don't rate it.  I rate this recipe (with no alterations) 5 stars.

Very easy to make - I doubled the recipe.  Everyone loved it!  Next time I will cut the bread up the night before to save time in the morning.  I'm not sure if you can prepare the whole recipe the night before like you do for an egg strata casserole, but a little prep the night before will help get it in the oven sooner.

I agree with another reviewer about the ratings. Please only rate the recipe as it is written. It is not an accurate rating system if you are rating the recipe based on changes you've made.  It then becomes a different recipe and your rating only refers to your personal "new recipe".   This recipe, as written, came out wonderful. It is sweet to begin with so keep that in mind if topping it with fruit or whipped cream. We did strawberries and whipped cream and it was way too sweet but on it's own, it tastes very good. A great recipe for the person who desires french toast but doesn't feel like standing at the stove turning the pieces.  I'm hoping to try this as an overnight recipe soon.  Thank you for the recipe!

This casserole has a very good flavor but using regular sandwich bread it's a little soggier than I like.  I will definitely make it again.  I will probably cut down on the milk by 1/4 cup or use a much heartier bread to absorb the liquid

Fantasic recipe for girls brunch, they loved it!! My husband insisted I make it for him the next day after all the raves!!  

I too, added Half & Half for some of the milk, and put more butter on top and used a 9x12" pan and added a little more of everything.  As for the 12 servings, that is way off.  With the extra ingredients and the 9x12" pan it only served 5 girls.  No leftovers for my husband!!  Otherwise fantistic recipe!  Victoria

I was looking for a great brunch dish & this was it! The recipe has just the right proportions of egg, milk, sugar & vanilla. I added extra cinnamon & a tsp. of nutmeg as well. My two day old potato rolls stood up well with the batter and I tweeked the recipe by topping the dish with a cup of fresh blueberries, 2 small sliced bananas & brown sugar crumbles made with the margarine. I used a lightly butter sprayed 9x9 pan. Baked covered for 45 min then removed foil & finished off for 10 to add a nice crisp to the topping. It came out thoroughly cooked & not mushy as some other reviewers experienced. This is a really satisfying dish that also makes a terrific dessert served warm with vanilla ice cream. An excellent recipe with great versatility & a definite keeper!

My large, picky family loved this! I had the crusts/pieces from 4 loaves of bread that I needed to use and this made a great meal for all of us. I did let it soak for about 4-5 hrs to help moisten the crusts and we put syrup on top. Bonus was that we had enough left over (I 4X the original recipe) to eat for breakfast and all I had to do was pop it in the microwave.

I used ciabatta bread and it was perfect.  I poured about 1/4 cup maple syrup in the mixture and let the bread soak overnight in the whole mixture.  I baked it in the morning and half way, I mixed everything as to cook evenly.  It was very delicious and tasted like cinnamon rolls!

Yum yum yum!!  This is great!!!  I made a few changes based on other reviews.  I used half a loaf of Oroweat cinnamon raisin bread and cut it up into cubes.  Then I mixed the eggs, milk, cinnamon, 1/4 cup Splenda, salt, and a splash of vanilla extract all together in a bowl and poured it over the bread cubes.  I stirred it all up and let it sit for 10 min.  Then I transferred it all to a greased baking dish and poured about 1/3 cup melted margarine all over the top as well as some brown sugar.  I baked it for 45 minutes total.  25 minutes covered and the last 20 minutes uncovered.  Wow it turned out so well, everyone loved it!!  I served it with syrup and sliced strawberries!  I will definitely be making this again!! It's a keeper!!!

Easy and good recipe. I folled instructions except I used a 9 x 13 pan because that is what I have. I also refrigerated for 30 minutes for baking. Came out perfect. I think it would be fun to mix some candied pecans in next time. Thanks for a great recipe.

As is, I give the original recipe 4 stars because it's very good, but a tad too bland for my tastes. 

After making it a couple more times based on previous reviews and my personal preference, it came out wonderfully! I used regular sliced whole wheat bread, since it's what I always have on hand. I added 1/2 t of cinnamon and nutmeg to the egg mix (I might add more next time because I love spicy french toast!). Many reviewers suggest to keep the bread layers at one to avoid sogginess, but I didn't have a problem with two layers. I put the first layer down, poured the egg mix over it, sprinkled with the cinn sugar, and added chopped apples...then did the same with the second layer of bread. 

Because I was afraid of the many soggy reviews, I also poured out the excess egg mix then popped it in the oven right away. Following other reviewers, I covered it with foil halfway to avoid the top from overcooking, took the foil off and poked it throughout with a fork, and continued to bake. It came out great and wasn't soggy. I also used a pie pan instead =) If you like the bread pudding-type texture, soaking it for a few hours does it, as I've done that, too.

I personally like regular french toast better, but this is a fun way to mix it up!

This recipe is simple yet I made it twice and two others made it...it came out very soggy for all of us. If a recipe that is followed to a tee does not come out correctly then I question the recipe.

Very good -- served it with Sliced Bananas & Apples. Kinda like a warm bread pudding/french toast.

My husband said after eating this he will never eat regular french toast again! I thought it was great myself, but I sprinkeled some pecans over the top of mine (after it was done cooking.) Next time I would probably add some raisins or something to add to the breadiness.

Served this Christmas morning, everyone loved it. One person suggested sprinkling with bacon on top. Sounds like a tasty suggestion that I might have to check out next time.

great! it did not come out soggy at all, as other reviewers experienced. baked for 55 min., 30 covered and 25 uncovered. goldenly crispy on top and soft inside. i had a 7x11 dish on hand rather than 8x8 so used that. it has a fluffier texture than regular fr. toast that you dip the slices and pan fry, and that's nice. it could use less sugar because i put on maple syrup. mmmmmm!

Fabulous recipe! It only makes an 8x8 pan so make 2 - it goes quickly. I prepared it the night before exactly as instructed and stored in the fridge. The next morning, I threw in some blueberries, stirred, and baked for an hour. I drizzled warm syrup over the entire pan before serving. Perfect!

Fantastic! I have made this many times over the past year and it's been a hit every time. It's baking in the oven as I type this...and boy does it smell good! I usually save the bread ends that my kids won't eat and pop them in the freezer, when I have enough I use them to make this. The only thing I did differently (and not on purpose) was that I doubled the recipe but only used 2 TB sugar in the egg/milk mixture thereby ending up with more sugar for the topping. It makes it even tastier, in my opinion. Thanks so much, I'll be making this for years to come!

This is a keeper. I followed directions, using butter instead of margarine (because I just like it better) and for the topping, I kept the sugar and cinnamon in their respective measurements, but added 1/4 tsp each of ground cardamom, ground nutmeg, and ground ginger. Otherwise, I followed the original recipe. It did take 60 min to bake, plus cooling down time. Definitely something to get started on early in the morning.

Tweaked for a church breakfast, added crushed pecans to the topping and made in a shallow pan because of previous reviews of it being soggy.  It was perfect but had the same problem of it sticking to the pan. No one seemed to mind except at clean up time.  Used 1 loaf of bread I left out overnight to harden a little,the same amount of milk 1 1/2c, added 6 eggs instead of 8 and it came out PERFECT.

The premise of this recipe rocks! It tasted fabulous and my family loved it. I do see how people would need to play it by ear with the liquid ingredients though. Different bread would absorb it differently. I added a little extra creme and eggs after I put it all in the pan. I also used heavy cream instead of milk and added a pinch of nutmeg. I used a 9x13 disposable pan covered with tinfoil for the first 30 min. I took the tinfoil off the last 30 min and the bread got just crispy enough!!  Perfection!

Excellent recipe!
I added a few things that other people had suggested. Added: 1/2c of vanilla coffee creamer, about 2 T of Brandy, sprinkled with brn sugar, and added about 1/2c thawed bagged blueberries.
I cut the bread cubes to about 1-1.5" and used a little more than suggested. I added an extra egg and some more milk to compensate and had no problem with mushiness. Maybe that was also due to using a 9X13 pan and keeping everything on a single layer. Baked 35min @ 375.
Definitely going on the Breakfast for Dinner (or 'B for D' as it is known in our house) menu!

Fantastic recipe as it is written. Of course some reviewers are going to add to it, I mean that's basic cooking skills (honestly, if you didn't have the sense to change it to your own tastes I'd say you have no business cooking). Comes out wonderfully, nice texture and consistency. I'm not a huge fan of traditional French Toast but baking it makes it lovely!

I made this recipe after some hesitation about a soggy middle.  I hope these tips are helpful to others who may also be hesitant to try, as this dish came out very tasty, and one I will make again!
1) use sturdy bread, challagh or italian/french bread (cut off some crust so it's so too crispy)
2) spread in pan so it's really only one layer or so of bread (more like a 9x13 than an 8x8 called for in recipe)
3) add cinammon to the egg mixture & as called for in the recipes sprinkled on top
4) bake 30 minutes the night before, refrigerate and bake remaining 20 minutes before serving.

Holy Cow this was amazing! I made this for breakfast and then had the leftovers for a snack the next day. My husband loved it as well. I will make this over and over. I know some people don't think you should include your twists and extras...but I must share that I added 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg, 1/4 tsp. ground cloves, and 1/4 tsp. of ground ginger...YUMMO!

It's great but be sure to use a deep enough baking dish as it will puff up.  You do not want the sugar rolling out of the pan into your oven... mine did that!  What a flaming mess!

Loved to be able to use a loaf of french bread that was going stale.  It reminds me a lot of bread pudding but I didn't let it soak as long because I wanted the bread on top to be a little crunchy.  Served it with maple syrup.

This was so delicious and I have since shared and made this recipe many many times! I did use a 13x9 pan thought, only because so many other reviewers complained of it not being cooked. Using a larger pan, it cooks much faster and the center is always completely cooked. Other than that I use whatever bread I have on hand: I've used Englich Muffins, I've used whole wheat bread, etc. This is so deee-lish no matter what I use! Soo good, thank you for sharing!

This is one of those recipes that is great if you make it as stated or change it to suit your tastes!  I've  made it as stated and it was great.  I've also made it with changes as others have suggested.  I cant wait to try adding a handful of berries or sliced fruit (I think fresh peaches with small cubes of cream cheese will be great!).  It's a great recipe to use for a brunch buffet!

The first time I made this recipe as described, and it was a (tastey) mushy, eggy, mess, hence the 4 strs. The bread at the bottom of the casserole dish soaked up too much liquid while the bread on top didn't get enough.
 Wanting to play around with the recipe after reading the reviews left by others, I decided to make the following alterations: I increased the amount of bread (Texas toast seems to work great) I filled the entire casserole dish and then added about 25% more. I let the bread dry out a bit just to be sure it wasn't too soggy, I added 1/4 cup cinnamon to the milk mixture, as well as 1/4 cup brown sugar, and I used cream instead of milk because that's that i had on hand.
 After making the milk mixture, I poured it into a separate container with a lid and poured the bread cubes into it, after shaking them vigorusly I allowed them to sit for 10 minutes until all of the bread is completely soaked.
 Then I baked until the crust was golden brown.
 This is a wonderful recipe with ice cream, and caremel sauce! Yummy.

I am sorry, I wanted this recipe to work so badly! I read most of the reviews and took some suggestions; reduced the liquid, baked longer. But the end result was toasted on the top but mush on the bottom. If you like bread pudding this is a nice variation. But its not for me!

Sunday recipe time - it was o.k. - would have been potentially MUCH better had the cook read the reviews on the liquid factor- it needs less moisture or more bread to sop it up better. It reminded me of a custard too but it seemed a wee bit rawish - which kind of grossed us all out. We did eat it however....maybe next time...if there is a next time, less soupy mix added and more cinnamin/sugar sprinkles - throughout. Thanks...

Not sure what happened here but I followed the recipe and it was looking good;  top browning, rising nicely but then after I pulled it out at 35 minutes, it fell. The inside was not completely done but the outside was just about overcooked. 
Will try again but at 300° for 45 minutes. That should do it. 
P.S. I also added 1 tsp of nutmeg, great addition!

What a wonderful recipe.  The aroma wafting through the house was a pleasure.  I'm sure any bread will do but I chose to use raisin bread and my wife and kids loved it.  Thanks for a great breakfast!!

Made a double batch, 6 eggs and 2 1/2 cups milk instead and buttered bottom of dish instead of top. Used vanilla bean paste for added decadence  and sprinkled top with cinnamon sugar to get a crust.

There is no need to change this recipe. All the ingredients except for the margarine are good. I used butter instead. I used 3 day old home made whole wheat bread that nobody wanted to eat(except maybe the dog). However it worked perfectly (with Crusts) in this dish. It baked perfectly with the divine sugar/cinnamon crust, and no soggy middle. No one in family knew that it was the old hard bread I used. I served this with a sauce I made from fresh black and blue berries, and cream. My kids said it was one of the best breakfasts ever and we should have it more often. Thanks for sharing !! Its so so good -

Awesome! Finally a casserole that doesn't have to be made the night before!  I used a cinn raisin bread  & instead of milk used flavored coffee creamer....my favorite trick!  I then can eliminate adding the sugar & vanilla in the casserole.  I made a double batch baking the 2nd batch in individual cupcake liners in muffin tins for a quick weekday breakfast.

My 11 year old and I made this recipe this morning and it was delicious! Used 6 pieces of whole wheat sandwich bread with the crusts cut off cut into quarters. 
Here's the changes I made on the fly knowing how we like our own French toast:
1. Melted a half stick of butter in the bottom of the 8x8 pan instead of using margarine.
2. Added some cinnamon to the egg mixture - did it by hand but probably a 2 teaspoons or so.
That's it.  Otherwise recipe as is.  Cooked at 350 covered for 15 minutes then uncovered for about 20 more.  
We were scraping our plates for more.  Can't wait to make it again and will double it next time in a bigger pan!

Very good! So many ways to vary this recipe. I tried the original recipe first, which was great but I wanted a little more flavor. The second time I added cinnamon to the filling and more to the top. Today I added 1 cup blueberries to the filling, it was delicious! Can't wait to try raisins next time.

We had this for Father's Day brunch.  It was a huge success!  I did however increase the recipe and did things a little differently than the recipe called out.  I used 1 1/2 loaves of Texas Toast bread, 12 eggs and put it all in a 10x14 pan.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon of Nutmeg to the ingredients.  First, I sliced the bread into 1" squares and then mixed the egg, milk and spices in a large bowl, then added the bread, mixing everything up together making sure all the bread was evenly coated.  After it was placed in the baking dish, I used approx. 1/3 cup of butter and patted it around the top before covering the top with the remaining sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg.  This became a family favorite instantly!

This was really good! I had a loaf of potato bread which my daughter bought on it's way out, so used some of that. Subbed Half n' Half for the milk, and had no issues with any sogginess. Also used butter as opposed to margarine. Very nice and easy recipe that was enjoyed by all. Will try this with Kings Hawaiian Bread next time. Thanks for sharing!

Easy to make.  I have even made it up the night before and then let it come to room temperature before heating.  That soaks up the custard better.  Somehow there are never any leftovers.

call it French Toast Casserole or Bread Pudding or whatever you'd like...this is so gosh darn good it should be ILLEGAL!  based on other reviews, i added 1/3 c. baking raisins and sprinkled the top w/ chopped pecans. i also used brown sugar instead of white in the dish...but used white on top for sprinkling.  i know people hate when you rate altered recipes but i just had to! serve this sweet little piece of heaven with something savory (like i will next time) and you'll probably straight up fall over from the deliciousness! husband gave this 7 stars!  do make sure to butter your pan...i did and mine is still a complete wreck.  totally worth it though!  (add on comment:  it is the next day...i am making it AGAIN! used italian bread from the bakery in big 2" chunks both times.)

My family loved this!  I made a few minor tweaks:  I used 1/2 loaf of french bread, sliced in a 9x13 pan (sprayed with "Pam").  I omitted the white sugar, and used 2 T brown sugar and almond extract (vs vanilla) and butter (vs margarine) in step 2.  I did sprinkle it w/cinnamon & sugar.  I baked it for :30 at 350 in a convection oven.  I will NEVER fry french toast again!

This gets four and a half stars for taste and 5+ for ease of preparation! If you like to make breakfast or you are having company, you must try this recipe. There is plenty of leeway for alterations to taste.  I used mango jam and a dash of crushed cardamom on mine. It's an excellent base recipe.  My houseguests loved it.  I can't stress how easy this is to prepare.  I used Egg Beaters (the kind with "yolks") and day old French bread off the sale rack.  I made it the night before and I swear, it took six minutes to prepare.  DO leave it in the full 50-60 minutes.  If it's getting too brown on top before the time is up, put some aluminum foil on it and stick it back in the oven- it'll be fine.  I can't wait to try this a hundred different ways.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this as a casserole for Christmas morning. Maybe it's my oven, but the bread turned out more crispy than I thought it should, and it just didn't have enough flavor. I might try other's suggestions and use cream cheese or syrup to give it more punch.

Very good, fast and easy to make. The first time I made it I followed the exact recipe.  My daughter, who dislikes eggs, said it tasted too much like eggs.  So the second time I made the casserole, I replaced 1/4 of the milk with maple syrup and added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon.  I also use challah or egg bread.  Everyone liked the changes better than the original recipe.

I think I'll make this again, but next time I'll used much less liquid.  It smelled so good in the oven and the top was nice and golden, but when I began to dish the casserole out, it was nothing but mush.  My husband and I agreed that next time it needs much less milk, possibly even fewer eggs.  We could taste so much egg.  With a little tweeking this recipe will be a keeper.

So this turned out perfect for me – I believe people that are having trouble with it being goofy did not get the bread to soak up all of the liquid… My suggestion and the only thing I did differently was I poured the egg mixture over the bread in a bowl and tossed it until all the bread was evenly soaked and all the liquid was soaked up. Then I poured it into the buttered 8 x 8 dish.

Made this for a church potluck. Used a 9 x 13 casserole dish which was wiped clean. Got rave reviews. Did not have enough milk for the recipe so I supplemented with SILK COCONUT MILK which gave the casserole a really nice flavor and texture. Will add shredded coconut next time. Added 1/2 cup RAISINS--will increase to a full cup next time.  This is a very versatile recipe that you can embellish with chopped apples, nuts, etc. Thanks for sharing.

I wish I could give this more than 5 stars
the only thing I changed was the pan size to avoid the mushy center,  we loved it.  Cut the bread (french loaf) yesterday,  mixed the egg mixture last night and put it together this morning and cooked it about 40 min and it was wonderful   Thank you

The taste is great....however, with the amount of liquid given and the time to bake...the texture is unappealing to me.  I used brown sugar instead of white sugar.  I will either add more bread or less liquid next time I make it, but I will certainly try it again.

My children LOVE this recipe. I agree with some of the other posters, editing this recipe to your taste is ok. It is an AWESOME recipe, the changes just represent your personal taste preferences. I have even made this recipe with regular sliced bread and it has still turned out great. It's also just as good using half splenda/half sugar. We vary the spices every time we make it. Sometimes we just use cinnamon, other times we also use nutmeg, sometimes we use pumpkin pie spice. Changing it up can make this recipe suit the season!

I give this recepie 5 Stars because my husband gave it 5 Stars and he never rates anything that high.

I used half and half instead of milk because I had some that was about to go bad and half a left over french bread loaf.  I had to toast the bread in the oven a few mins to dry it out, but over all it worked perfect.

The middle of my cassarole was a bit soggy because I ran out of time and could not cook it the full 50 mins.  However, my husband fondly refered to it as French toast pie since it was cripy on the outside and custardy on the inside.  So the verdit is in folks soggy (custary) or baked all the way.  This recipe is a winner.

this was ok.  it was a little mushy in the middle, but the biggest problem was the bland taste.  It wasn't bad but regular french toast is much much better.

Tasty but mushy...I added walnuts for a nutty/earthy flavor. I would reccomend one egg less and perhaps a bit more bread.

I made this recipe today for brunch and it turned out fantastic.  I did not deviate from the recipe itself, but since I was using a 9x13 pan instead of an 8x8 I added more bread cubes, a little more milk and 1 more egg to be sure that it covered the entire dish. (I cubed up a loaf of french bread for the bakery)

Baked for 50 minutes and let set for 10 after removing from the oven and it was delicious- sweet enough to not need any syrup but also great with syrup. A Def. keeper!

Fantastic! If you love the taste of custard, you will love this.  The only two things I did a bit differently were more bread -- about 2 cups more bread cubes (approx 1/2 loaf of white bread total) and 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon instead of 1.  Next time I might put that extra 1/2 tsp into the custard mix instead of only on top.  We poured a little bit of syrup on top, but it really didn't need it.  It was truly excellent!

I took this to a book club meeting and everyone loved it.  Some may find it mushy.  If you like your French toast mushy, you will like this.  If you like your French toast a little crisper you may not like the texture.  The only thing I did different in the recipe was to let the bread sit in the egg mixture a little longer.  I only did this because I wanted to grab it out of the oven and run out the door with it hot.  So, I let it sit for a little longer until I was ready to put it in the oven.

DEEEEEE LISH! But I cut back to 3 eggs and a tad less milk.  Also following another reviewer, I poured the egg mixture over the bread cubes - cinnamon raisin bread - and let it soak in for 10 minutes. Covered it for the first 30 minutes then cooked it uncovered for another 30. I thought I'd died and gone to heaven!!!!!! I'll be making this A LOT from now on!

Original recipe turned out way too soggy, so I did it again, this time following the suggestions of an earlier reviewer; I am rating THAT 5 stars. I used Pepperidge Farms "Brown Sugar Cinnamon Swirl" bread and used just about the entire 16oz loaf, maybe a little less. I lightly toasted each piece and cut it into four squares, and let the pieces soak in the egg/milk/etc mixture (which I made the night before and refrigerated) for about 20-30 minutes. I then used a slotted spoon to arrange them in a 13x9 dish. Sprinkled a bunch of cinnamon sugar on top. I also cooked it for 30 minutes at 350 instead of Sharon's recommended 20. It looked a little soggy coming out of the oven, I was concerned, but if you let it sit on the counter for a few minutes, it firms right up. I finished it off with some powdered sugar after coming out of the oven. DELICIOUS. Went over great for Mother's Day brunch.

This was very good.  I had a half a loaf of a french baguette to use up and it worked very well.  I made the mistake of mixing the cinnamon in with the eggs but it didn't seem to affect the flavor.

I was looking for a "short cut" recipe for French Toast when I stumbled on this one...we have a large family and by the time I serve up two French toast per person, I can rarely enjoy the meal.  I was skeptical about the casserole, but it was delicious!  The family loved it and we all ate together.  I followed the recipe for the most part but used the suggestion to put melted butter in the bottom of the pan (about 1/2 stick), added the bread cubes to the mixture and then added to the pan, used a small amount of brown sugar for the topping in addition to the white sugar, and then baked as suggested.  For bread, I used a mixture of leftover Christmas bread (Thomas's brand and had cranberries in it), sourdough bread, and Pepperidge Farm country white.  To serve, I had heated maple syrup to top off a great dish!  Will definitely do this again.

Yep, I modified it, but only slightly and it was fantabulous.  Thank you Starflower -it is soooo good.  First, I prepped it all the day before.  I used Cinnamon Raisin English Muffins and the King Hawaiin rolls for my bread cubes, added maybe 1 - 1 1/2 t. of cinnamon to the egg mixture along with 2 t. Almond extract (YUM!) and about 3 T. of Amaretto.  The sugar topping was replaced with about 1 T of the Amaretto and 1 T sugar mixed in the same bowl and drizzled on top and then dotted with the butter.  It did require a lengthened cooking time so that it was "done" and not runny.  I also noticed it continued to "set up" as it cooled.  Didn't even need syrup, powdered sugar, berries, whipped cream or bananas with this dish and we weren't even thinking about it.  SO glad I decided to add this dish to our '09 Christmas breakfast.  The entrie family gave it high marks.  I thought it was similar to bread pudding without the Brandy sauce.   May have to make again for New Years day.  Deeeeeelicous  And c'mon folks, this is a very basic recipe and nothing like a good foundation that allows for some tasty creativity.  I enjoy reading the other (positive) reviews that offer sugestions that might appeal to my palate.

I have made similar versions of this many times. The trick is to use a pan with low sides and not have the bread cubes higher than the sides of the pan before cooking. Can make this with soy milk for a non dairy version. Can use cinnamon swirl bread and add raisins for a really yummy breakfast!!! I also always serve mine with maple syrup. Yum!!

This was really good - I made it as stated. My sons, hubby, & grandkids who happened to be over when I made this, also really liked it.  I  save the ends of bread that don't get used for sandwiches during the week, by throwing them in the freezer. I used all my ends just for this recipe and even with bread ends it was still good!  I will make this again! I am adding to my original review because I made this several times & really like it, but I changed it up this morning.  Instead of white sugar, I used brown sugar & mixed it up in a cup with cinamon.  I buttered the caserole dish, then made layers of cubed bread w/brown sugar-cinnamon mix in between bread cubes.  The rest of the recipe I did as stated. Oh gosh, this was even better because it tasted like cinnamon rolls once the syrup is poured on top.

I had an over-abundance of cinnamon raisin bread; needed to make a quick dinner; and I found this recipe. I cooked it in a 9" x 12" pan at 350F. It was perfectly cooked at 30 minutes. My family was delighted and has requested it again tomorrow for breakfast! The texture was lighter and more tender than French Toast (but not at all mushy) and it was less creamy than bread pudding. This recipe is a new variation on a favorite theme in this house. I look forward to trying other reviewers' ideas for this recipe in the future. I love it that people feel free to tell us about their substitutions. It is what I like best about this web site.

I liked the top and sides of this french toast, just thought the inside was a little too mushy.  Next time will reduce milk and maybe cook again longer.  Very easy and tasty, though!

Better than regular french toast!  Seems to be a "forgiving" recipe!  I just half measured everything as I scaled it down to less servings.  Put it all in a smaller pan, mixed it up so the bread all got saturated and baked it at 375.  It got nice and a little crispy on the outsides but baked all the way through.  Definitely will make again - extremely good!

After reading other reviews I reduced the egg & milk.  Wish I hadn't.  Prepared it the night before & refrigerated; I think it absorbed all the liquid and needed more to keep the bread moist. Sliced small loaves of french bread; placed side by side in 9x12 pan.  Used brown sugar & cinnamon as well.  Also, as another reviewer suggested used saute' apples.  I placed the apples on top of french toast prior to baking in oven.  Baked until brown on top.  Next time I will serve the saute' apples on the side after baking casserole.  All in all a good recipe.

I mostly followed the recipe, except that I used day-old french bread cut into large chunks and I let the whole thing refrigerate overnight.  Overall, we were very pleased with the flavor of the dish, but I think I will be making some changes the next time around.  It was much too mushy for our tastes, even with the stale bread soaking up the egg mixture overnight.  Next time I will cut the milk by at least half a cup and maybe get rid of an egg, and I think that will fix everything.  I totally recommend this recipe with those changes!  The chunky french bread was awesome, and I can't imagine it with regular sandwich bread.

My family loved this for Mother’s Day Brunch last year.  I made it as directed, but didn’t pour all of the liquid into the pan (kept about 1/8th of it out) so it was not too mushy at all!  I also added a few tablespoons of maple syrup and some Grand Marnier to the eggs/cream which really rounded out the taste.  I let it sit overnight to meld all the flavors together.  It even tastes great as leftovers!

I made this Christmas morning for my family and it was amazing!  I used one loaf of french bread and doubled the rest.  I also made it the night before, so the bread could soak up the egg mixture.  I ended up cooking it around 40 minutes and it came out perfectly!

I have been making this recipe for years, only doubled the recipe because I only make this when having company.  You can make this dish the night before by following the recipe, after putting the butter on top of the cassrole cover tightly with tin foil and put in the refrigerate overnight. Preheat the oven and remove the foil, put the cinnamon/sugar over the top of the cassrole then bake for 40 to 45 min. or till the tester inserted into the the center of the cassrole comes out clean.  It is soooo tasting when "marinating" before baking.

This recipe was delicious!  I used stale white French bread (store made) cut up into large chunks and measured 5 cups but packed in pretty good.  Some of the pieces were hardened and others softer.  I used cooking spray at bottom of 8x8 pan.  It was a total hit!  crunchy and sweet at the top and custardy in the middle!  Definitely a keeper and will make it again and again and again!!

4.5 for ease of preparation and simple ingredients. I used toasted cubes that were earmarked for bread crumbs, so it was a little crunchier. The video says to gently turn the bread in the liquid (eggs/milk) mix, but I decided to mix the bread cubes in the liquid mixing bowl, first, before pouring into the buttered casserole. Also, since the mix is supposed to soak into the bread for 10 minutes, I wouldn't turn on the oven at the start of prep, since it only takes 5 minutes to reach 350°. Great tasting and smelling!

This recipe is sooooooooo easy and tastes great. My husband is as picky as a 5 year old, and this is one of his favorite recipes of mine. The only variation I've made is only using 3 eggs vice 4. 4 may be ok for smaller eggs, but I use large or extra large, and 4 eggs makes it too mushy. I tend to use whole wheat bread, which helps to fill us up quicker. Overall, great recipe based on ease and taste!

Easy and delicious! I followed directions except I had no margarine so I used country crock butter instead.  It reminds me of a french toast version of bread pudding...the top has a little toast crunch but the inside is warm and soft.  I was tempted to try condensed milk as another reviewer had mentioned but I'm glad I tried it this way first or it may have been to sweet for my taste along with syrup and fruit on top.  
I baked the full 45 minutes even though I was a bit nervous when I saw how dark the top looked (the cinnamon darkens it).  Also, I used multigrain bread (good texture) and served it with blueberries and syrup...absolutely delicious!

Delicious and easy. I followed other's suggestions: melted 1/4 cup butter in the bottom of the pan, substituted brown sugar for the sugar, mixed all the rest of the ingredients except the bread. Then I mixed in the bread, put it in the pan, and sprinkled with extra cinnamon and brown sugar. My family's favorite part was the crunchy top and edges. Next time I will use the same amount of ingredients, but place in a 9x13 instead of 8x8 pan so we can have more of the crunch. Yum!

I did not make any changes to this recipe. It was delicious and worth the wait time. If you plan on doing this in the early morning you can save time by cutting the bread the night before.

Have made this many times now in a variety of ways and it is always good.  White bread, wheat bread, old whole grain bagels you want out of the freezer -- it all works.  I was out of sugar this time so threw in some honey.  Kids didn't notice and I like that it was not as sweet.  We don't buy margarine so sub butter each time.  Super fast and easy to make.

Made some simple changes to put this over the top! I used Cinnabon Swirl bread and allowed it to 'stale' overnight. Used real butter instead of margarine, and made a simple brown sugar streusel topping. A-mazing!!!

I am eating this right now. It is very good, however, next time I will add less eggs (a little too eggy for my taste) and I will not add sugar to the recipe next time, the syrup made it sweet enough. Overall, a great recipe, very easy to make and would be great to make ahead of time.

It's a delicious bread pudding with a breakfast-y twist...in some parts of south Texas it's called capirotada, which is where I learned the recipe. So good!

This dish was a big hit with my family. I made this Christmas Eve for breakfast and everyone loved it! Making it for Easter brunch as well. Super easy and delicious way to enjoy French toast with out all the work of making one by one, made the night before and just reheated in the oven the next morning! Totally recommend it

Made this exactly as stated and my family loves it. It kind of reminds me of a bread pudding...Great quick way to feed a crowd for breakfast.

Very tasty but i'll cut down the eggs next time. It was a little too eggy, i double the cinnamon but it was a little over powering so i'll also try half of it next time. Also followed another review suggestion and cook it for 20 min at 400 degrees

Not as good as French toast, but can make a little bread go a long way.  I would recommend using a dense bread.

Oh do I love this recipe!!!!  I get up at 4am and have a 2 1/2 hour commute in the cold NY winter. I made this recipe on my days off and froze it to heat up in the morning during the week. This was so wonderful to have on cold morning!!!

Loved this dish, totally a keeper! Took someone else's advise and used vanilla creamer to replace some of the milk and added nutmeg and more cinnamon. My kitchen smelled like Christmas morning! I see this super easy and versatile dish on the "breakfast-for dinner" rotation. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I had tried a recipe like this in the past and it was just too mushy.  My husband and guests loved this one, so I guess its a keeper!  I did cut down on the liquids. Next time I would make a bigger batch!!

We love this for breakfast.  I use vanilla almond milk and eliminate the sugar.  I usually add two more slices of bread another egg.  Your house will smell divine and you can't beat the prep time.

This recipe is great! My son (now 35) always liked to have what we called "Breakfast Birthday"!  To celebrate his birthday this year, we planned one again.  Because we are all grownups with a little more sophisticated tastes I decided to make this as part of a "grownup" menu.  What a hit.....definitely a keeper recipe. Got loads of compliments and it was extremely easy to make. The only change I made was omitted the salt.....it's not needed.

I made this for breakfast Christmas morning. It was very well received and has since been requested several times. Sometimes French toast can be soggy, but this was just the right balance. It was very easy to put together and the vanilla added just the right touch!

I made this recipe as written, EXCEPT I used brown sugar and substituted butter for the margarine. I thought it tasted a little bland, and it came out soggy even after reading through the reviews and tweaking things. It looked pretty, but I will not be making this again.

Such a great & delicious recipe!  So much easier than the hassle of making french toast on the stovetop!  I usually use cinnamon raisin or blueberry bagels in place of the cubed bread.  Great that I can make it up the night before.  I just pull out of the fridge about an hour beforehand and dot it with margarine. Then bake as directed.

I like the idea of cutting the bread into cubes. Doubling the vanilla, cinnamon & sugar makes this good enough to eat without the messy syrup.

I made this yesterday for a family gathering. I used the suggestions from "ashleynicole" and in addition added cinnamon to the milk/egg mixture. I used day old french bread. Mine turned out more like a bread pudding, which wasn't a bad thing, everyone liked it. I love everyone's comments and their take and changes to recipes, but next time I will try this recipe as written.

This delicious recipe has gained a permanent place (complementing my usual egg/potato/onion skillet) in our Christmas morning brunch!

I doubled the recipe.  I used Sweet Hawaiian bread; for the milk, skim plus some half and half (as I was almost out of milk) a 9x12 metal pan (melted butter in it while the oven was preheating), and, while baking, placed the pan on a pizza stone, ensuring more even setting of the custardy middle.  Baking time was approximately 65 minutes and although the very bottom was starting to get dark (not burnt); top was perfect and middle was set and not soggy.

Everyone loved this dish and I will definitely make it again!

This wasn't a big hit in my hose, which is why I gave it only three stars; however, I don't think its the recipe, but rather my families tastes.  It was a bit too mushy for our liking.

Very good and the best part is my non-adventurer and very picky husband loved it as well. Nice change from an normal French Toast. We loved it and Will be making again for future breakfasts.

I made exactly as written and it was fantastic!  Soft on the inside and crunchy on top - perfection!  It states 6 servings but my girlfriend and I ate the whole thing!!  Will definitely make this again but will double it.  I think I also might try it with green onions, sausage, etc. instead of the sugar and syrup.  Can't wait...

We thought it was really good!!  It smelled heavenly while baking!!  We followed the recipe exactly but the edges didn't get any egg mixture so we made a bit more of the egg mixture with one more egg to soak all of the bread.

My husband and I both thought this was good, but would rather have plain old french toast.

yummy!  I made it with half whole wheat bread and half brown sugar swirl bread (Pepperidge Farm);  used brown sugar in the egg mixture instead of white sugar.  Family loved it!

This didn't come out as I had hoped.  The top was too crunchy, the inside was too mushy, and it lacked a bit of flavor that you'd expect in french toast.
I'll try it again with some changes and see how it goes.

We are snowed in today, so I made this for breakfast. I don't have very much that is useful to add, but I didn't change the ingredients at all (for once). My husband liked it, My 16 year old's only problem was that there wasn't more of it, and my 11 year old kept carrying on about how he felt like he should be in a restaurant but it was too good. I got to hear what a good cook I am, which is always nice, and it was easy and fun to make. Under what to drink - I would have to say OJ goes just right, too. Thanks Starflower!

This is DELICOUS! I think the key to making it NOT bread pudding is to use a thick crusty bread like a nice french bread. I also added pecans to the top before baking to add some more crunch. LOVED this! Topped it with real maple syrup and strawberries with homemade whipped cream. YUM!

The photo with the recipe shows whole slices of bread i.e. more of a french toast thing than bread cubes, but a  delicious bread-pudding like dish either way.

I made this a little treat for my family with a loaf of homemade bread that i was afraid was going to waste. Everyone loved it. I put a cup of walnuts on top before sprinkling the cinnamin and sugar. Then we topped it with some good ole maple syrup. Yum. I will have to make this again.

Awesome recipe but plan ahead, it takes a while!  I did what one person suggested and added a little brown sugar and syrup, it was delicious!  I used stale French bread from the night before and left the crust on, it turned out great.

This dish was super easy to make, especially one night for dinner when I was short on ingredients and had no idea what to make!  It whipped up pretty quickly and my family all raved over it.  This will definitely become a regular meal in our house!

the recipe was great but it's always nice to hear how other people have doctored the recipe. I used Turbinado sugar instead of white sugar, skipped the margarine, added a pinch of cardamom and cloves to complement the cinnamon, mixed in 1/4 cup raisins and topped it with real maple syrup. Took it to a lady's brunch and it was a hit! I did let it sit almost an entire day in the fridge before baking (had a schedule conflict) but it only really dried out the top cubes. Fixed this by adding a little water and microwaving before serving for the brunch. Will probably make again (minus the excessive wait in the fridge).

W-O-W!  I cut the recipe by half (since I only had a family of 3) and it was perfect servings for each of us.  It was so good and very easy to make.  After I set the casserole in the oven (I placed in for only 25 mins since I did 1/2), I was able to wash dishes and make eggs to go along with it.  My family was impressed so I couldn't take all the credit.  I needed to rate this recipe (5 stars).

I made this today and it was very good!  I don't like bread pudding, so was leery after reading some of the reviews.  But it does taste like French toast and provided a delicious brunch.  I'll make it again.

It's pretty good. I used cinnamon raisin bread and sweetened condense milk (14oz) and 1/2 cup of milk. It smells incredible baking...wasn't too sweet or too soft. I'll wait for my son to wake up and try it.

I served this for Christmas brunch and didn't change a thing. I used powder sugar on top and drizzled syrup. Everyone liked it. I made enough to refrigerate some and warmed it the next day under the broiler and it was even better because it was just a little crisp on top. I am making it again this morning 12/29 and will turn the broiler on for just a few minutes at the end.

YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY!! I made this for Christmas morning and it was a hit! I may have used a little less than 5 cups bread, so I cut the egg to 3 eggs. I also add a pinch of cinnamon into the milk,egg,sugar,vanilla mixture for a bit more flavour. I prepared this on Chrsitmas eve. Wrapped it in cling film, and place it in my fridge to stand and soak for the night. Woke up in the morning and popped it into the oven. This took just about an hour to reach the 'done'/golden top state! Thank you for the recipe  STARFLOWER!! I know this is going to become a staple in my house from now on! :) Oh I must add, do serve WARM (it does make a difference)! :)

Fantastic!  Doubled up the recipe for Christmas morning breakfast.  Cooked the night before, then microwaved individual slices the next morning.  Used a 9x13 pan and was concerned because the egg mix only came halfway up the bread cubes, but everyone loved it!  Some added syrup, some ate as is, EVERYONE LOVED!  Even made with rye bread due to local Christmas Eve bread shortage and it was still devoured!!  I know what I'm bringing to Christmas next year!

YUM!  This was great.  I used dried bread crumbs for this recipe so the egg mixture soaked all up before I put it in the oven.  Not mushy at all.  Kids and hubby gobbled it up.  Might make this for Christmas morning!

Very good and easy to make.  I made it just like the recipe called (only used Almond Milk instead of reg. milk).  I made it the night before because I didn't want to rush in the morning, but it was perfect.  Not too sweet, my boys loved it!  I will definitely make it again!

Had some stale bread, wanted to make a recipe that I could prepare the evening before... so this is what I did.  I poured part of the liquid into the casserole dish, and used a silicon brush to coat the top of the bread.  I also added a 'crumb topping' something like what you would use on an apple crisp (added chopped pecans because I love them) and it was pretty darn good.  Could serve with either powder sugar OR real maple syrup.  Make sure you have lots of good sausage to go along with it the sweet/salty contrast is great!

THIS RECIPE IS AWESOME!!! IT'S MY FAMILY'S FAVORITE, WE USE IT FOR HOLIDAYS AND SPECIAL CELEBRATIONS. IT WORKS REALLY WELL TO PREPARE STEPS 1 & 2 THE NIGHT BEFORE AND REFRIGERATE UNTIL MORNING. TAKE OUT IN THE MORNING & POP IN THE OVEN.

Though I'm not a big fan of french toast (hate that eggy feel/taste) this was well received here for the family even though they all were hesitant to eat it (not really what they were expecting for breakfast I think lol)  For the bread I used sliced (in rounds) bagels and I think the firmness of the bagels themselves helped.  Thanks for sharing!

This is my 14 year old daughter's favorite breakfast! I usually use cinnamon swirl bread off the day old rack for a little extra cinnamon kick. Thank you!

I use the leftover ends from our loaves of bread. Just toss them in the freezer until I get enough of them and then I make this. My children love it!

This is very yummy. Not wanting a sloppy casserole, I reduced the milk to 1 cup (I actually used almondmilk). I also used leftover bread from Dr. Micheal's yeasted cornbread (AR recipe.) My only complaint is that this serves about 3-4 people, not 6.

This was very good and tasted like regular french toast! I made up the custard the night before and stuck it in the fridge. I also prepared my bread cubes the night before. I did add a little bit of flour to the custard, but otherwise followed the recipe. In the morning I added the bread cubes to the custard bowl and mixed it all up and poured in the 8x8 pan. Then sprinkled with the cinnamon sugar mix.  Cooked for 45 minutes and it was perfect! Topped with powdered sugar and syrup! Thanks, will definately be making this again!

I thought this was very good.  I used leftover apple bread that I had made earlier and cubed it as the recipe instructs.  I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9X13 pan and used the required amount of milk and eggs.  It took a full 60 minutes to bake the custard and I did have to cover with foil about the last 20 minutes.  I think this is a great basic recipe that you can easily alter to fit your family's needs and using what you have on hand.  I came out as good as something I might expect to find at a bed and breakfast.

I made this for dinner tonight and I thought it was  perfectly delicious! Although I didn't change anything I really enjoy reading what other people do with the recipes here.  I'm not the best cook, but I'm getting better...and I seriously give a lot of credit to allrecipes and the reviews here. It's given me the confidence to experiment a bit and not follow the recipes exactly.  Yay for allrecipes, the talented cooks, and the great reviews! :)

This recipe was absolutely spot on. Delish. Perfect. I made one alteration, quite by accident: I did not have any regular sliced bread so I used texas toast. All I gotta say is, DANG!! *nomnomnomnom*

A wonderful, quick, delicious recipe.  Followed a few reviewer suggestions: added an extra slice of bread, baked in a slightly larger (9x9)pan, increased baking time to 60 minutes.  It came out perfectly.  Here's one I'll use lots of times.  Thanks for the post.

Great basic recipe! TIPS: Best to use slightly stale hearty bread like French bread. Also may need to turn bread over while soaking to ensure consistency. Customize by adding berries or other fruit or extra cinnamon or nutmeg.... whatever you like.

Hands down, the best fench toast I have ever made. I added my normal french toast ingredients to the egg mix (vanilla, brown sugar, allspice), but the was the technique that made all the difference! I also let it sit overnight and flipped over the bread in the morning. This is AMAZING!! I want to make breakfast for everyone with this recipe now!!

Eggcelent! Just make sure all the bread is evenly soaked in mixture. If some is more soaked it will come out soggy, if not soaked will come out dry & hard. So so good. Cooked in 7x11 glass dish for 50mins @350

I used about 6 cups of Challah bread & kept the other measurements the same.  I also used a 9 x 13 & baked it foe 25 min. covered w/ foil.  Then, I removed the foil & baked an addt'l 15 min.  Only thing I'd do next time would be to make sure all the bread had been saturated in the egg mixture.  Super Yummy with syrup!

Are there 6 stars available?  This was incredible.  And easy -- and made from ingredients we usually have on hand (ie, file this recipe away for when I don't feel like shopping first).  Also, to be festive, we used eggnog for 2/3 of the milk and accidentally doubled the cinnamon (we halved the recipe but put in the full recipe amount of cinnamon).  The eggnog/extra cinnamon version is heaven on earth.  YUM!  Thanks!

great with brioche (what isn't?). the first one i made was too crispy on top, so i covered the next one with aluminum foil and it wound up a bit too soggy. the next one will be covered for the first 30 min and uncovered for the last 15, or somewhere around there. i also found mixing the bread with batter in a bowl to get it evenly distributed before putting it in the baking dish helpful.

Mmmmmmm! This was delicious! I also added chopped pecans to the mixture before I poured it over the bread and put a few more on top. I cut down on the sugar by substituting Splenda for the sugar that was mixed into the egg mixture. I still used the sugar on the top to get the crunchiness. I will make this often.

I needed a quick Breakfast Casserole for a work breakfast. Although this did take an hour and a half from start to finish, it was quick....for a casserole. The only thing I changed, was I used six English muffins cubed (cut whole and not split - I made two - one was regular and one was raisin cinnamon) instead of bread. I also drizzled melted butter on top of it for the last 5 minutes while it was baking....it was starting to look dry. I used a 9x13 pan too, instead of 8x8. I would "generously" butter the bottom of the pan, it didn't stick too bad, but I only put a light coat of butter.

This was pretty tasty!  I added cream cheese throughout the dish to give it a creamy taste.  I sprinkled brown sugar on top and served it that way.  This is a nice use for some extra bread!

Chunky Cinnamon Bread is a must.  Add in almond extract.  And, the liquids really need to soak in for a couple hours (I always go overnight).  Bake at 350 for about 50 minutes in a heavily greased pan.  (This puffs like mad - so evenly distribute in pan)  Top with Powdered sugar.  Then, add your butter & warmed syrup.

I adapted this recipe for a dinner party, substituting chevre for margarine and adding apple butter. It turned out great, although I agree with everyone else about extending the cooking time. I got nervous and turned the temp down to 300, baking it for an additional 30.

Tastes just like...french toast--just what we were in the mood for.  Did not put in sugar, used 1/4 cup maple syrup instead.  Also, baked in 9x13 as suggested by others so the mixture wouldn't be soggy.  In fact, it was a bit dry for me so next time I may add more liquid.  Will definately make this again!  Delicious!

Quite yummy.

I made this with almost a whole loaf of whole wheat bread, and replaced the sugar with 1/4 cup of maple syrup (and lessened the milk by 1/4 cup), and added a pile of cinnamon.

I put the bread and liquid mixture in a bowl and tossed it to coat and then put it in a 9 x 13 pan.

It baked up great, was not soggy and our whole family loved it.  Way easier/less work than regular french toast and just as yummy, if not more.

OMG this was AMAZING! I made this for my family and my mother-in-law this weekend, and it was a huge hit! I used a loaf of french bread and cut it in cubes. I just threw all the bread in a shallow foil pan (used for stuffing) and followed directions. Next time I will use some cinnamon in the egg mixture and core the inside of the loaf and put the crusty outside pieces of bread at the bottom and the softer inside pieces on the top, as the bottom is much moister and the top gets yummy crunchy. But this was DELISH! I will be buying more french bread and making this again soon! Maybe for brunch, lunch and/or dinner!!!

This was great! I used cinnamon bread and it turned out very nicely.  I took it on a weekend trip already cooked and it reheated very well.  Everyone loved it and requested I bring it next time!

Outstanding and so glad for my very first ever French toast casserole, I did this one. For those who complained about it being too wet, preheat your oven to 400. After putting the pan in, lower it to the 350 suggested baking temperature. Also, use the lowest oven rack possible. This will give you browned crispy bits on the bottom and top with the middle moist.  Everything else I kept the same, except I added the cinnamon to the egg mixture before pouring over the bread. Will experiment using a mix of breads, too, like cinnamon-raisin and white. Wow, this was so good. Thank you STARFLOWER.   (note to self: done 40 in big oven.) **Oct. 2019 Also very good using cinnamon bread with white.

I used hawaiian rolls, made ahead and let sit in the fridge for 24hrs. Wasn't soggy in the middle at all. So delicious! We usually have it for dinner!

6.12.17  This turned out really well, and was soooo easy to make.  I checked it at 45 minutes, and although it was nicely browned, the center seemed a bit soft, so I baked covered for another 7 minutes.  I should have brought it out at 45 minutes because it was a bit dry.  But that’s my fault, not the recipe’s.  While sitting for a few minutes after coming out of the oven, it would have continued to cook and would have been perfect.  I think a a nice flavor variation would be mixing into the bread cubes some rehydrated dried cranberries or cherries, I’ll try that next time.  Very happy with how this turned out.

This tasted great and was super easy. I doubled it to fill a 9x13 pan. For bread, I used half stale French bread, a few pieces of white bread, and leftover crusts from homemade bread. I cut the white sugar by half and mixed the cinnamon in when I whisked the eggs, rather than sprinkling it on top. I did sprinkle a little bit of brown sugar and cinnamon on top for looks. Enjoy!

Like the blurb says, this tastes a lot like french toast. I made it for a family breakfast and everyone enjoyed it well enough. I didn't find there was quite enough of the egg mixture to cover all of the bread, so some of it ended up very crispy, but then again I like stuff like this on the softer side. The rest of my family liked it just the way it was.

I read a few reviews that said it was gooey on the inside so I baked it in a 9x13 pan, thinking it would cook more evenly if spread out more. It was hard on the bottom and edges and SOGGY in the center.

The bread was either dry or soggy. No happy medium. I even did one layer in a buttered baking sheet. It was edible, but not worth saving or making again.

I made this for dinner this evening. My husband and I both enjoyed it very much! The only change I made was to use butter instead of margarine, and I used plain white bread. I think with a more hearty bread it would be even better. The simple cinnamon sugar dusting on top with the dots of butter created a light, crunchy topping. It was perfect!

This was a great easy recipe for Christmas morning this year.  After reading the reviews I baked the casserole for 60 minutes and it turned out yummy....  My adult children and picky husband loved it!  Also as suggested by others I used vanilla spiced eggnog for a different flare and it turned out even better...  who would have thought???

It was so yummy! I baked it until it was so golden at the top and it was so crunchy. I didn't make any changes to it expect I used olive oil spray and I love it and so did my sister. Will make it again that's for sure.

Made this for a brunch in muffin molds. They were amazing. Let the bread soak for maybe 20-30 minutes, they seemed a little soggy but they came out well, everyone thought that the party was catered.

I found this to be a yummy comfort food, hubby did not enjoy how soggy it was. I used almond milk instead of regular so I thought the flavor was great, but will probably not make again.

This was sooo good! It had an amazing texture, cross between french toast and bread pudding! I made this Christmas morning and everyone loved it! I didn't have any issues with it being too soupy in the center as some did; but I did make sure to select a sturdier french bread. The only things i did differently was add 2 TBS brown sugar and 1/4 tsp nutmeg to the topping. Instead of just pouring the egg mixture over the bread, i tossed it quite well to make sure all the bread was coated and then let it sit for about 10 minutes before topping with the cinnamon mixture.

Great, easy recipe. I tweaked it to make enough for a very large, days old baguette. I used an 11 x 13 pan with the baguette sliced into large rounds, 2 eggs + 3 'egg substitute' eggs, 2 C milk, a bit under 1/2 t salt and 1 1/4 t vanilla and only half of the cinnamon. I turned the sliced bread halfway through the sitting time to make sure the bread was drenched thoroughly. It came out GREAT. Very easy for kids to help make, and super yummy. Enjoy!

Delicious! I just used up the bread I had, 5 slices honey wheat bread, 2 hot dog buns and 1 hamburger bun (next time I will use the bread ends as the extra texture from the crusts is nice) I added 1 tbl cream cheese and melted with butter then added to eggs. Added 1 tsp of brown sugar to the cinna/sugar topping.

I was looking for a simple french toast recipe that tasted good and this one delivered!  Instead of margarine, I used light butter. I was running out of time so I didn't get to "dot" it with the butter or let it stand for 10 minutes.  Instead I just melted the butter and poured it on top with the cinnamon & sugar.  Easy & yummy! Thanks for a great recipe.

This was wonderful....like a dessert.....everyone thought it was a "Special Treat".  The only problem I had was that it stuck to the pan a little...so I will try melting some butter in the bottom next time.

This was easy and yummy.  Next time I will assemble it the night before, so I can just pop it in the oven in the morning.  I had to take it out of the oven in 40 minutes, because the top was getting dark.  Next time, I'll also rest some foil over the top near the end of cooking time. I don't have the greatest oven... Family loved it.

I really enjoyed this and so did my husband.  At first, I was extremely disappointed by the consistency in the middle (and this was after cooking for an hour and fifteen minutes) -- but then I decided to go ahead and taste it -- and it was wonderful!  Next time I make it I will add less milk though and I'll be better prepared for the time it takes to cook thoroughly.

The store was out of any kind of dense bread so I used some store baked wheat bread.  I cut it all up and threw it in the oven to toast for a bit.  It was a really soft bread - almost like a sandwich loaf - but this worked well so it wasnt mush.  I made about three times this amount and split it into two 13x9 pans.  This, along with some scrambled eggs and such fed 12 people with left overs.

Delicious!  Especially with syrup.  I baked mine in 9x13 which reduced cooking in half.  Other french toast casseroles end up soggy, but not this one.  No substitutions needed.  So easy and yummy!

This recipe is a keeper. I tweaked the recipe a little to cut down on some of the carbs (I'm pre-diabetic) by using 1c. of milk and 1/2c. of almond milk along with 2 Tbsp. of sugar and 2 Tbsp. of Splenda. These changes did not compromise the taste. Next time I will try using just almond milk and/or Splenda. Btw, I also used three-day-old homemade sourdough bread.

WOW! This tastes good =) My kids didn't like it at first. But when I serve it to them the next day they finish everything up. It was even better the next day. However, I changed the ingredients a bit. I used white sugar instead of brown sugar. I didn't not use cream cheese since I do not have one in my cupboard. I also added 1/4 cup pancake syrup and a teaspoon of nutmeg. Serve it to guest topping with ice cream and drizzle maple syrup on top. Thanks Starflower =)

I only rate the keepers :) I've used left over hot dog or hamburger rolls, stale Italian bread, or whatever I have on hand. I never change the recipe and it comes out perfect every time.

Was okay as is, but was very mushy on the bottom and the top of bread gets too crunchy.  I will make it again with a few changes, add cinnamon in with the egg batter, along with a little nutmeg.  Spray the pan for sure with some Pam. Cover dish for at least the first 1/2 hour, remove cover and finish baking. Let stand for a few minutes before serving. Top with some maple syrup and sprinkle with some powdered sugar...makes a very attractive dish.

I am just now making this for the second time. It is quite yummy and is just like bread pudding. Bread pudding is my favorite dessert so this recipe is a hit with me. I didn't change anything the first time but I took someone else's advice this time and melted some butter into the bottom of the dish before adding the bread. You can never go wrong with more butter in my opinion!

Wow!  Made just as directions said for our Christmas brunch and my kids made me promise I would make it every Christmas!  Three days later I made another batch with leftover French Bread that was hard as a rock.  Put one extra cup of milk and one more egg (because the bread was hard as a rock)  and it came out PERFECT!  Thank you so much for this recipe!  It's so simple!

Oh how I wanted to love this recipe. I waited to make it for Christmas morning and boy it smelled good.  I made it with Italian bread so as to make it less soggy.  It tasted okay but not great.  I served it with real maple syrup and all three kids didn't like it.  Mom didn't care for it but dad really liked it.  It's missing something...

Excellent dish. I substituted 1/2 c eggnog for some of the milk and made it for Christmas brunch. It was easy, delicious and looked beautiful as it came out of the oven all puffed up and golden. I cooked it in a cast iron skillet.

I really enjoyed this dish. It was SO easy to make and much less messy than real french toast.  I didn't measure any ingredients exactly (beside the milk) and it STILL turned out great! Next time I will consider adding more to fill a 9"x13" so it will last a little longer. Mine was also a little mushy, but I think if I added less milk it would be too dry on top. I enjoy bread pudding though, so the texture didn't bother me.

This was so delicious and easy to make.  I made this as breakfast for dinner because my kids were begging for french toast.  I have made other french toast casseroles but had not found the one dish to stick with.  This casserole I will be sticking with.  My daughter who doesn't like cinnamon loved it and asked for leftovers for breakfast.  Even though it says this serves 6 we are a family of three and only had 1 serving leftover.  My 17 year old son took about 3 servings.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Tasty, but I'll make some modifications next time. I think when using fresh bread cubes, less fluid is required. I also plan to use some brown sugar and more cinnamon.

My family loves this recipe. I love it for Breakfast for Dinner night because it cleans out the freezer.  I freeze the heels of my bread, or anything that has gone stale, then when I have enough, I make this with them and it comes out great. Any mixture of breads seems to work out fine for me.  Wheat, white, buns, Italian etc. If I was making it for guests I would use Italian or hearty white bread. I like to add gobs of cream cheese.  It's good hot or cold.  Adding fruit is really good too, especially raspberries, but I add whatever fruit I have stored in the freezer.  We always top with maple syrup. I would probably say the taste is 4 stars with leftover bread with another star for using up leftovers.  It's probably 5 star when it's fresh high quality bread. I skip the butter.

Very good and very easy.  I baked up the "Amish White Bread" from this site to use.  (It is fantastic!)  Like others, I skipped the butter and didn't miss it, but coated the dish with nonstick spray.  I think that next time I will try adding a little more sweetness to the egg mixture to make it more to my taste.

My brother suggested that next time we try it with raisin bread so I put my nieces and nephews on that for Father's Day.  

This is the best recipe for feeding a large amount of kids that seem to sleep over at our house without a lot of work or clean up.  Everyone loves this dish.  A real winner!

Way too egg-y and not sweet enough. Waste of ingredients and I will not be making this again. The only thing positive I can say about this recipe, is that it did make the house smell really good while it was baking.

I added about 6 slices of cooked crumbled bacon on top of the casserole. Then baked it. It gave it a hint of smokey flavor and the family loved it. This is really good for a family get together Sunday brunch.

The original recipe is great.  However, I got to experimenting and I found the tastiest version was when I used cinnamon pullapart bread (which I cubed) and a handful of fresh blueberries on top.  To die for!  Once, I actually served this as desert:  I put some of the casserole in a ramekin and topped with whipped cream.  My guests raved.

I made this today for my Mom and my fiance, they loved it!! From the reviews that I read, I added some almond extract and fresh grated nutmeg. I did use the raisin bread as suggested but I cut the eggs from 4 to 3 which I think helped. After I added the custard I stirred the bread mixture to eliminate the sogginess.

This recipe was very easy and tasted great, but could have used a bit more flavor.  I might try adding more vanilla extract and brown sugar or fruit next time.

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  Being able to bake it in the oven made it nice to not have to stand over the griddle the whole time to make a large amount of french toast.  And the possiblities for preference are endless! (nuts, syrupy glaze, powdered sugar, fruit, etc)

Baked up just this morning, was a big hit.  I used a 9x9 pan, next time I'll compensate with a little extra bread and let the bread air dry a little while first.  I forgot to add the cinnamon sugar mix, but added during the last ten minutes of cook time and it turned out tasty anyway.  Will definitely make again.

I followed the recipe "as is" and it DEFINITELY needs tweaking. It is WAY too soggy in the middle. It needs less fluid and needs to be stirred at least once during baking time.

My boyfriend and I did not like this one bit.  I followed the recipe (I did not make any alterations).  We agreed that the combination of the sweet french toast with the eggs just did not go well together.  It tastes very odd (and not in a good way).

This has become my favorite "breakfast for dinner" casserole. I've made it at least three times in the past four weeks. I add a few peeled, chopped up apples to the mix. Delicious! I serve it with bacon cooked on my Foreman grill. Five stars all the way!! Thanks for this recipe Starflower!

Excellent!  Served once as breakfast for dinner, and everyone loved it.  Used a mix of white and wheat bread, which added color and flavor.

This was awesome! I used cin raisin bread and otherwise stuck to the recipe. I think it would be great if you added some apples to it! I think I am going to try it that way next time!

Loved it! I added more bread and then lightly toasted it all in the oven first because many claimed the casserole came out soggy. SERIOUSLY picky eaters in my family but they all LOVED IT! Five stars from me :-)

The casserole set up very nicely after 60 minutes,
the concept is good, but the casserole lacked flavor.
Perhaps adding more cinnamon and or vanilla may perk it up. Thank You for Sharing

I followed the directions to the letter- no additions or substitutions.  My kids (2,3,4) loved it.  It was such a treat for them to have for lunch with grilled ham on the side.  Leftovers (not many) reheated with syrup were great the next day.  So easy- what a great way to use up any stale homemade bread.  We'll be adding this one to our regular rotation.

This was a wonderful recipe.  I added 2 tbsp of maple syrup and sprinkled with confectioner's sugar, put this in an 8X13 baking dish and cooked it for 25 minutes; my husband ate the whole thing.  I'm making it again this weekend!

Followed directions exactly except baked at 400.  Baked it for over an hour and it was still soggy in the middle.  Maybe use less egg mixture?  Baking hotter and longer doesnt work.

This was pretty good. I only had a 1/2 cup of milk but I decided to make this anyway. It tasted great and not soggy at all. I will definitely make this again and add more milk, but not the full amount. I think 1 cup would probably be enough.  Seeing how well it turned out with just a 1/2 cup, I can't imagine adding a full cup more.

I have only made this once, so far.  I used a 9x13 pan and mini baguettes for the bread. It cooked in about 35 minutes.  It tasted good and was easy to make--even better with syrup on top!

The top gets extremely crunchy since it is in the oven for so long and the middle and the bottom are extremely soggy since the bread is soaking in milk and eggs for so long.  On top of all this, the flavor was really bland.  You can use 4 eggs, a half a loaf of bread, and 1/2 cup of milk in much better ways.

I didn't care for it. I followed the instructions to a "T" and it didn't come out as I expected. The taste was bland. Maybe I should've followed the other instructions in the review. I probably won't try this again. My mom like it though :)

I didn't really like this recipe.  I made it exactly as it, baked for 50 minutes, and everything other than the top was soggy.  I felt like I served my family soggy french toast.  If it would've baked through fully, I think it would've been great.  But I think I'll just stick to regular french toast for now.

This was so yummy, if you added raisins you would have bread pudding!  It is wonderful as is, but it is sweet.  I did mix in thin sliced apples.  Will definately make again, this will be on my table Christmas morning for sure!  Thanks for the recipie.

Super easy and super delicious!  I used old french baguette, mixed everything together and let it sit overnight in the fridge.  (I weighted down a smaller dish on top.)  Remember, it is french toast and needs syrup!

I was excited to try this.  My family likes french toast and I thought this would be a different way to make it.  We all agreed to never make it again.  If you like bread pudding you will probably enjoy this though.

This recipe is easy and delicious. I've made it twice and I find that the top gets nice and brown, but the bottom stays more like bread pudding. It better when reheated. I brown the bottom in a buttered skillet before reheating in the oven. Makes it even better.

Edible, but bland.  Kids didn't like.  I used the Hawaiian bread loaf and diced into 2" square pieces.  I didn't let it sit for 10 minutes because the bread saturates so quickly.  I also put in a bundt pan but let it cook for 50 minutes.  It was like eating warm slightly soggy bread-not quite what I was looking for.  I think with such a variance on opinions for this recipe it could be the kind of bread being used which could make a huge difference.  Those who liked it would serve others well by noting the specific type and thickness of bread used.

Very nice recipe - simple but delicious.  The best thing was that it filled the house with that French toast smell.  Recipe was excellent as is.  Let the bread sit in the wet mixture for 10 minutes, then gently mix before baking.  Served with fruit and cream, and peanut butter and maple syrup.  Easy to make and would be good for company.

Excellent just the way it was.  This was easy to make and delicious.  I used a whole loaf of Challah bread, which probably contributed to the flavor alot.  I do appreciate the reviews that tweak the recipe a bit, for example "added nuts" or "decreased sugar" ... that helps alot to gain from others experience with the recipe.

Made this today! I must say it smelled amazing, while cooking. And my kids absolutely loved it. Me on the other hand I am not a huge fan of soft/mushy bread. Are there any tips to help with this issue. I would love to make it again because my kid LOVED it!

Not at all what I expected.  French toast is quicker and just as good.  I was disappointed, would not remake, kinda like bread pudding with too little sugar....waste of time.

This seems a lot like old fashion Bread Pudding.   I'd like to try this with raisin bread, and add more raisins and maybe some chocolate chips, and maybe some pecans, migh be fun.

This recipe is a great take to brunch dish.  Last year I served it Christmas morning, used King's Hawaiian bread and added finely chopped apple and rasins.  It was like eating breakfast and dessert at the same time.  IMHO it doesn't need the maple syrup, but who would turn that down if the opportunity is there to have it.

For an awesome twist--add a block of softened cream cheese to the mix.  Spread small chuncks into it when it's in the pan.

Good recipe for those that do not want to mess with the stove top but want the same taste of french toast.  I am more of a baker.  I tore up a fresh loaf of bread but found that the edges of the loaf were a little bit crusty for the recipe (oops my bad).  Otherwise it was just perfect.  Thanks for the recipe.

Don't let the name fool you.. this recipe tastes nothing like French Toast. It tastes like egg custard, which I hate...  I'll never make it again. I baked it for an hour until it was done all the way through. The thing is.. I love quiches and casseroles.. but really.. Stay away.

My family loves this recipe!!!  It's a complete hit at our house on Sunday Mornings.  Instead of french bread I add a little twist by using Cinnamon Raisin Bread.  Absolutely delish. Two thumbs up!!!

I followed this recipe exactly and it was gorgeous looking and excellent tasting.  The top with the sugar and cinnamon was our favorite.  The only thing we added was syrup for dipping.

Absolutely delicious, although I didn't add nearly as much milk so it cooked through and I added MAPLE SUGAR on top before baking...it carmelized and added great flavor and a beautiful color.

We used a pizza cutter and texas toast for quick, easy bread cubes. The only thing we might change is either slightly reducing the amount of milk or baking slightly longer at a lower temp. From a couple of non-breakfast eaters, this casserole will DEFINITELY be making repeat appearances!

Very yummy casserole! My family of 4 loved it but we only ate half of the casserole. We refrigerated the left-overs and added one egg with 1/4 cup milk mixture on top the next morning. It turned out just as wonderful as the first time we ate it!

Absolutely Perfect Recipe! Added 2 more eggs because I added 3 more cups of bread. I also added two cut up raisin bagels, 5 pieces of 100% wheat bread, and 6 pieces of white bread. added 1 tsp vanilla also because I was making more than the servings indicated! Thank you so much for your perfect recipe!!!! I make my french toast normally with wheat bread or raisin bagels, that is why i added them to this recipe! Perfection!!!!

I followed this recipe completely except for two things, instead of just pouring the egg mixture into the pan I mixed the bread cubes in with it and let them soak for a few hours and then put just the bread cubes into an 8in square pan.  Secondly, I covered the pan with aluminum foil for the first 50 minutes of baking and took it off for the last 10 minutes so that the top would get brown but not burn.  My husband and I both loved it.

Everyone loved this. I doubled the recipe and I am glad I did, because there would not have been enough. The only change I made was to add an additional TBLS spoon of butter on the top and a little more cinnamon and sugar. This was an easy side to our breakfast dinner.

Very good and easy! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because mine stuck to the bottom of the pan so I would recommend coating the pan with non-stick spray and the butter.  I bought too many bakery made bread cubes for my thanksgiving stuffing so I used them and it turned out fabulous.  I think the bread was day old French bread so it was definitely "french" toast casserole :)  Thanks for sharing it!

Thanks, Starflower for this fantastic recipe.  Made it for my 2 year old's birthday brunch.  Not sure who liked it more, the kids or the adults.  Several people asked for the recipe afterwards.  This is now on the brunch menu permanently!

If you like french toast, you'll like this.  I don't, and I didn't like this at all.  But my hubby, and our guests loved it, so 5 stars is appropriate.  I cooked it a little longer and it was cooked through.  Next time I'll sprinkle with powder sugar before serving, and have maple syrup available for those that would like it.

I threw together the "custard" ingredients and refrigerated them, Put the bread cubes in the baking dish and covered with foil.  In the morning I poured the custard over the bread, let it set while the oven preheated and we had a warm, filling, delicious breakfast with about as much work as pouring bowls of cereal.  Great recipe just as it is!

Used challah bread.  Maybe  the pan was too big but the milk egg mix/ bread porportions were a little off

I made this for a breakfast at work and it went quickly. I managed to sneak a taste, but only barely. I did change it slightly. I combined the egg mixture the night before and I added a sprinkle of cinnamon and nutmeg (I like to do this in regular French toast) and stored it overnight in the fridge. I combined it with the bread cubes this morning, and let it sit for 10 minutes. I didn't use the whole amount of the cinnamon sugar mixture on top, just a sprinkle.I baked it about 15 minutes longer than called for, but this may just be my oven.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very easy to make but both times I have made this dish, it turned out mushy and soggy.  The top bread pieces get browned and almost crunchy, but all bottom pieces ended up soggy and unbearable to eat.  Too eggy.

Great recipe!!  I was a little leary to add all the milk, as some said it was too eggy, so I only put about 1 1/4 cups.  However, I think the whole amount would have been fine!  Don't forget to grease the pan...I forgot this morning :(  Other wise, I put it in a 9x13 pan, using day old french bread cut into 3/4 inch slices.  Will certainly make this again and likely try egg nog next time!

The best EVER! I did everything like the directions said. At the very end I put the dish in the broiler and got a very good light crist on the edges of the toast.

I made this exactly as the recipe says except I waited 10 minutes after pouring the custard over the bread, then stirred it again to get the dry pieces covered, then proceeded to add the butter, sugar and cinnamon.  It turned out perfectly and so delicious!  Will definitely make this again.

This is one of our traditional breakfasts for guests.  I triple the recipe and make one 9x13 and one smaller casserole dish.  The 9x13 takes about 2/3 of the mixture and the casserole the rest.  I bake the casserole according to the directions and I add a pecan topping (1 stick butter, 1 c. brown sugar, 2 T corn syrup, 1 c. pecans, a little salt, cinnamon and nutmeg) before baking to the 9x13.  So divine.  Everyone loves both versions.  Made it today for Christmas brunch with fresh fruit, sausage and wassail.

I know it's called a "casserole", but I found it too eggy.  It still tasted good, but I had some issues with the texture as a result of what seemed to me like too much egg mixture.  My gf loved it, though.  I'll try using less egg mixture next time.  Confectioners sugar before serving is a must.

This was really good and easy, and didn't require soaking overnight which helps when you're in a hurry!  I used Hawaiian bread and put brown sugar in the egg mixture.  I also made a blueberry and raspberry sauce.  Very sweet, but very yummy.

After reading other reviews, I decided to use a bigger pan and leave this dish in the oven a little longer than stated. The results were wonderful! The casserole was crunchy on top and soft on the inside. Delicious!

Definately break the crust of your bread up in little pieces so there is not too much crunch in one bite. Was a great recipe!

It was okay.  My kids ate it but not sure I really liked the crunchy top with the soft bottom.  I used all the liquid but only cooked 35 minutes since the custard was already set.  Will probably not make again.

Super easy and a hit with my kids.  We used it as a 'breakfast for dinner' entree' and it will go in the rotation!  I added utilized another reviewers suggestions, and added 1/3 c baking mix to the egg/milk mixture.  I  also melted about 2 TBSP butter in the pan per her suggestion, also.  The only other change I made, was that I added about 2 TBSP brown sugar to the topping and it was YUMMY!!!!!!

Thanks for posting this recipe! My mother in law makes this and we just love it with a very thin layer of brown sugar and a can of peaches on the bottom. It's so easy to throw this together the night before.

I doubled the recipe (lots of stale bread) and put it in a 9 x 13" pan and then put it in the fridge to soak overnight. The next day I it baked for an hour for breakfast-for-dinner.  Other than that, the only thing I changed was to add some nutmeg.  It was very good, and several friends said it was "amazing."  The only thing I'd do differently would be to stir around the bread a bit maybe about a half hour or so before cooking (the top pieces were a tiny bit dry), and I may add a few more spices.  Thank you!

This recipe is super easy and very good. I added a cup of blueberries and didn't serve with any syrup. I tested first with my family and my one-year old couldn't get enough. I then made a batch for work and everyone loved it.   The great thing is you can use any kind of bread that you have. I have made it with leftover hot dog & hamburger rolls, and with sliced bread.    Thanks so much for sharing!

OUTSTANDING!  New Family Fav and everytime I make it, I get lots of requests for the recipe!  I could not have been more please....soooo easy and makes the house smell amazing while cooking!  I did use butter instead of the margarine (my personal pref).  This one is a winner and will hit my table often!

Love it! I made a few changes based on other reviews and another recipe that sounded good. I used 6 thick slices of challah bread cubed (almost a whole loaf), after letting it sit out all night. Instead of sugar I used 1/4 cup maple syrup in the egg mixture. Added some cinnamon to the egg mixture too and double the vanilla. Cooked for 1 hour, added 2 cups of blueberries to the top during the last 15 minutes of cooking. So Yummy.

very good - but I got nervous when the custard didn't seem to moisten the top half of the pan of bread - so after I had already put on the cinn/sugar topping and butter, I decided to dump out the pan and mix evertyhing in a large bowl to evenly distribute the egg mixture. After putting it back in the baking pan, i added more toppings again. It was pretty good this way, but I think it would have been too dry and maybe not as flavorful had I not taken that extra step. Served for dinner with ham slices and applesauce.

This was not good at all, even after 1.5 hours, this was a mushy mess. I cooked for 60 minutes, then covered with foil and cooked an extra 30 minutes and it was still mushy at the bottom. my oven is pretty new and powerful, so its was not my oven. It was also very bland, perhaps if i doubled or tripled the seasoning. Very disappointed.

Why didn't I think of this years ago?!  French toast without the one-by-one wait.  Now the cook gets to eat it hot too!  Love this.

Very good..first time ever making anything like this and it was great the next day too. I added blueberries(not too many) and that really made it good. As for changing the recipe, i like when people put their changes but can also agree with some and say it can get a little confusing. A few are OK but if it becomes a laundry list just make your own recipe.

I made this a while back for my boyfriend and I for breakfast.  It was really good.  I'm going to make it again today at work, for my co-workers since we have all the ingredients.  But, why does it fall after it cools?  It's so nice when it's big and puffy after taking it out of the oven .. but it does fall.

Excellent recipe. Doubled everything and used a 9 X 13 pan. Used Peppridge Farm cinnamon bread (the whole loaf equals 10 cups cubed bread) and omitted the cinnamon. Baked it at 375 degrees for 45 minutes. Puffed up beautifully. My family loved it and kept looking for more.

Despite cooking for over an hour, the center was still mushy.  I will make this again, but will use a 9x13 pan to help it cook faster and crisp up.  Also, it stuck like crazy, so I'll make sure to use a LOT of butter on the pan next time.

This was good, but mine came out gooey on the inside and crispy on the outside. Which wasn't so bad with syrup we ate it up! I did add canned pumpkin and pumpkin pie spice...I was feeling ready for fall!

Even my husband who really doesn't like cinnamon enjoyed this recipe. I did cut it in half and used a bread pan since there's only two of us. I baked it about 40 minutes and it was perfect. YUM! I'll be making this again!

We made this for Christmas morning and everyone loved it. The best part was being able to put it all together the night before and then just popping it into a preheated oven the next morning. Christmas morning has never been this easy! We like it so much that we planned to make it for overnight guests on New Years Eve.

Really yummy, super quick and easy to make! I increased the cinnamon as suggested by other reviewers and mixed all the sugar and cinnamon in with the egg mixture before pouring it over the bread so the cinnamon would be tasted all the way through. 
I baked it for 47 minutes. MUST watch it toward the end as it's a fine line between soggy mess and burned top.

This is excellent. I doubled this recipe using Texas Toast, a combination of skim milk and fat free half and half, egg substitute and fat free butter spray. Served it for Christmas breakfast. Everyone thought it was outstanding.

I made this casserole this morning for Christmas breakfast with the family. I made it in a 9 X 13, and increased the recipe by 1.5   Used 2 parts milk and 1 part egg nog.  Also used 2 parts buttermilk bread and 1 part cinnabon cinnamon swirl bread.  Turned out delicious and had everyone asking for the recipe!  I will definitely make this one again and again.

i added blueberries in the casserole and 1/4 cup brown sugar mixed with the cinnamon for the topping.  Delicious and no syrup required!  try it with cubed sourdough for an interesting twist.

wow i did it!, I agree with some of the other reviews, this dish reminded me of a rice pudding in a custardy kind of way. While rice pudding isnt one of my favorites i certainly did not dislike it. Anyway my one year old was CRAZY for it! i made grits, eggs, bacon, and sausage  to go with it (items she normally eats) and she turned her head to everything and only wanted the casserole! lol Anyway, my two year old, though very picky ate hers all too. My husband gave it 3 1/2 stars...PS I'm so glad I found this website. It's real recipes by real people. None of that gourmet, fancy type of stuff. Just a lil bit of everything, to give me lots of choices and oppertunities as an aspiring young cook!

This is a great way to make french toast for a crowd!  We loved it. I think in the future, I may cut down the amount of sugar which is sprinkled on top cause the sugar along with the syrup makes it extra sweet. Other than that, everyone enjoyed it!

This was a good dish.  We used 1 loaf texas toast cut into cubes and combined the liquid mixture amounts according to the recipe (used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk) and stirred the liquid mixture into the bread in a seperate bowl and let sit in the bowl to abosorb.  We needed to mix up more liquid (about 1/4 of the amounts in the recipe) and added.  After about 10 minutes put in a 13 x 9 glass baking dish and cooked according to the recipe.  It came out perfect - not soggy at all.  Everyone loved it.

I wish I had read the reviews before making this one. It was ok - but very soggy in the middle. So I put it back in the oven and baked it longer - but still soggy. Baked it a little longer but the moisture never cooked away.  We ate around the soggy part - but not a good way to start our New Year. Better luck next time!

My family are not big "french toast" fans but this was a hit. My daughter said, "I think I've found my new favorite meal." I did a little experimenting. I used french vanilla flavored coffee creamer in place of the milk and didn't use any vanilla extract at all. It tasted pretty yummy.

My entire family absolutely loved this casserole and wanted more!  The only thing I changed was that I substituted half of the milk with French Vanilla creamer - its my "secret" ingredient in all French Toast.   I have tried numerous different recipes for French Toast Casserole and this was by far the easiest to make (especially for last minute when you don't have all night to let it sit) and most delicious one so far.  DEFINITELY a keeper recipe!

I used an oversized 9” brioche loaf (sometimes a small challah is good), increased eggs by 2, increased milk by 1/2 cup. I also use half cinnamon and half apple pie spice. This is a classic comfort food for my family. I’ve made it this way multiple times for years now and it’s consistently good. I almost always have to bake it closer to the hour mark and cover loosely with foil at the end (10-15 minutes or so) so the top doesn’t over brown.

Simple and yummy. A good way to use dry bread, leftover pancakes, waffles etc. We are naughty and eat this for dinner sometimes!

Very good and versatile! I followed another reviewers suggestions to add 1/3 cup bisquick (I used a generic brand) to the egg/milk mixture. I only had 2 eggs and 1 cup milk and it turned out great still. I also added a sprinkle each of nutmeg and clove. Baked at 400 for 25 minutes and it sat for 15 minutes before we were ready to eat. Firmed right up and was really tasty!

Tried this with 1c milk, 1/3c bisquick and 3 eggs and 3/4 loaf of brioche baked at 400 25 minutes. Yum! Also accidentally added the cinnamon to the egg. Still good.

10/7/18 Mixed everything up to discover I only had one egg! So one egg went into the casserole along with my bisquick, cinnamon, sugar and 1c milk. Used a small loaf of homemade bread I let stale up. Baked 400 25 minutes.

I doubled the recipe and a whole French loaf was just right. I normally make a recipe as is the first time, then tweak. But I was short on time, out of milk, and only had 7 eggs! I subbed half & half for milk - only had 2 cups for double recipe - and baked for 25 min at 400. Also added chopped pecans to topping at my husband’s request. It was not soggy as others have experienced, perhaps due to the decreased liquid and higher temp. It was delicious and everyone had seconds with 3 generous pieces remaining for the next morning.

This is the best French toast casserole (or bread pudding) I've ever made. I made no changes except for using real butter on top instead of margarine. Not too sweet like some I've had. I didn't think it needed syrup, but you could add some if you like it sweeter. My kiddo wanted syrup. I liked how the top got crunchy and the flavor from the butter on top.

I made it exactly as it said and it was ok. And I rated the original recipe because that's what the ratings were designed to do.  I am sure with changes it could be made better but I do feel the need to mention that if you DO make changes, you should rate based on the original recipe. When people give 5 stars with the changes they make, it's not really rating the original recipe now is it? I love to read people's substitutions....however please don't inflate the ratings. I see some people getting angry with other reviewers bringing this to their attention. But you can't say "5 stars with changes" in your review when you rated it 5 stars as is.   I fully expect someone to also find fault with what I wrote here, even though I wasn't nasty and was diplomatic. That's the Internet for you! I will make it again based on the suggestions of the other reviewers. I hope that I can help at least one person with my review.

Loved the recipe! Did a seasonal twist on it though and made pumpkin pie French toast and mmmmmm... It was delicious! Try adding 1 tsp. of pumpkin pie seasoning in the egg mixture, the bread was pumpkin cobbler bread from Aldis and only other suggestion is to use granulated/crystallized sugar for the last 2 Tbsp. on the topping for a beautiful presentation and a little crunch. If trying this variation also scale the cinnamon for topping back to about 1/2 tsp. instead otherwise its a little too much seasoning with the pumpkin pie spice in it already. Also, had no problem baking the 350 degrees for 45 min but used my convection setting which helped cook all the way through. This woukd make a wonderful thanksgiving/ Christmas  morning breakfast/ brunch and I think that's what we'll make at my house ??

Great recipe! Made with minor changes. Added cinnamon to the egg mixture & used a 9 x 9 pan, which kept it from getting soggy. FYI I get what the poster meant about making changes & then reviewing. Minor changes are fine, but what's really annoying is when a cook completely changes a recipe for whatever reason whether it's taste, opinion, or lack of ingredients; and then gives the recipe a poor rating based on those changes. For example, I admitted to adding extra cinnamon and using a slightly larger pan. It would have been very rude of me to then rate with 2 or 3 stars claiming it to be too dry and too heavy on the cinnamon.

Awesome recipe!!! I put it on a 9x13 baking pan. I substituted gluten free bread, almond milk and vegan butter to accommodate our family allergies and even then it tasted perfect! We topped it with either maple syrup or pure honey, powder sugar and strawberries. Love that you just prep it and place it in the oven and you have free time to do other things while breakfast is cooking, no need to stand by the stove for a long time. It served 4 adults and 2 toddlers and we had leftovers. Totally recommend!

I made a lighter version of it:  Egg white instead of whole egg, Challah Bread, Honey instead of sugar and 100% organic coconut oil instead of butter on baking pan. It Tastes good, even though It flatted after removing from the oven.

I tried this just as it was written with the exception that I have a glass sprinkler with sugar cinnamon and used that instead and added the amount that worked for me. Family loved it. Grandchildren when they visit want this instead of regular french toast. If your middle is goopy, just cook it another 10-15 min. like I did. Solved.

I make this all the time. I cut back on the white sugar and add some Truvia. Sometimes I add blueberries too. The family loves it!  It only makes an 8x8 inch pan so I double it and use a 9x13 cake pan.

This is very good. I like it because it is only an 8x8 size so that is perfect for my husband and I. I have even heated up some that was left over in the microwave the next day and it was still good.

This recipe is amazing. I get compliments every time I make it. If you follow the recipe as is, it's delicious and if you want to tweak it(I use more bread, margarine, sugar and cinnamon than they say to) it's perfect as well. I was never a huge fan of cooking and this is one of the first recipes I tried when I decided it was time to learn. I come back to it again and again.

I made this Christmas morning, forgetting to sprinkle the additional 2 tsp of sugar and cinnamon, and it was still good! Wouldn't recommend doing that though, incredible after using all the called for ingredients. No real changes necessary, coming from someone who usually deviates! I use all organic ingredients including real butter, and Xyla sugar, a natural sweetener, which makes it better for those watching sugar and/or carb intake. Easy and excellent!

I actually made this recipe EXACTLY as the recipe specifies.  I used store bought italian bread in the paper bag from the bakery. I used a glass dish to cook it in and the cooking time was spot on.  Pretty standard flavors - it won't knock a gourmet's socks off.  But the crispiness of the top and softness of the insides was a perfect contrast.  My 13, 11 and 8 year just loved it!  Especially since I made it for dinner.  I would definitely make this again.

Very easy to make and yummy!  I didn't change any measurements, but I did use egg beaters rather than eggs.  Smells delicious while baking.  The sugar/cinnamon mixture makes a very nice crust coming out of the oven.

This was simple and awesome. The next time I'm going to add a diced apple. Mrs. H suggested adding pineapple and banana, covered with shredded coconut.
As with all French Toasts, letting it sit longer absorbs more egg "batter".

This was really good although my husband did eat 3/4 of the 9x9 dish! Our bread was really fresh so I added about 2 extra slices to the 5 cups of bread! If it's the only thing I'm fixing next time I will make more!

Soooo yummy! This is some delicious mix between french toast and monkey bread. My variation was that I cooked in a round bakeware which I think made it more moist inside. I also added 1/3 cup of Bisquik like the last reviewer to the egg mix and baked at 400 for 25 min. I added a small amount of cinnamon, nutmeg, and all-spice to the egg mix. I found the measurement of spices on top to be perfect, but I would be even more generous with them in the egg mix next time to bite into more delicious cinnamon pieces inside!

This recipe is very easy and tastes so good. I like it because everyone can eat "hot" french toast at the same time. And another plus is it can be warmed in the microwave the next day and still tastes great.

We like our skillet french toast, so the moisture of this was not appealing to us.  We would try it again, but reduce the amount of milk in the recipe.  We made it for a church breakfast, and came home empty.  The recipe has potential.

I used fresh french bread loaf, 16 oz (I doubled the recipe.)  I cut up into cubes and let them sit out for about an hour to dry out a bit.  I then soaked for about 10 minutes prior to putting in the oven.  It was very tasty but the texture really varied.  Some bites were very soaked, much like bread pudding and then other bites were more crispy.

This was a great recipe! I thought it tasted amazing and for two out of the five cups of bread cubes I used some homemade banana bread, it gave this casserole a wonderful flavor and added some texture. I will definitely be making this again!

I did not care for the texture. I really can't get into the gooey bread center. Not really that great tasting either. I won't be making this again. And I really don't see anyway to tweak this to make it better. I'll stick with regular french toast.

Okay--I have been a member here for a long time---I love finding new ways to create meals, and this is my go-to web site for that! Typically, the first time I make a recipe, I follow it very closely. After that, I play with it to make it my own. One of the things I really enjoy is the suggestions others give in the reviews. The shariung makes it a community, and I love that! Now, stepping off my soap box, a review of this recipe: YUM!!!!! my BF loves it!!! And one of my daughters specifically requested it this morning! I did play with it today, but have made it to the original recipe sevaral times and it is always a hit!! :)

I love this recipe and make it just as written.  I put it in the oven first thing in the morning and then get ready for work.  Its ready in time for us to eat before taking my daughter to school. Other oven baked french toast recipes have to be made the night before and I just can't seem to plan that far in advance.

love this recipe, and so does my family.  i use 1 c milk, no butter/margarine, use only 2T of sugar and mix the cinnamon in with the egg & milk then i dredge each piece of the bread in the mix first, then pour the rest over it all in the dish.  i also bake it in a covered casserole dish...i uncover the last 10 or so minutes.  perfecto!!!  there's never any left.

This was a big hit with my family. I liked that it was crunchy on top and custardy in the middle. I stirred it once halfway through cooking time. Also used a little larger baking dish and cut the cubes smaller than the picture shows. I will definitely make it again!

This was good, in fact I really enjoyed it.  My kids didn't like it as much.  They ate it but said they would prefer to not have it again.  The only fault I could find with it was that in a couple spots it was a bit eggy, tasting more like eggs than french toast, but 95% or more of it tasted fine to me.  I probably won't make it again, at least not without some changes.

Tasty and excellent time-saver for busy moms like me.  The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because my bread was a lilttle hard (I didn't use loaf bread).  Maybe next time I will increase the wet ingredients to make certain the bread is completely submerged and reduce the bake time by maybe 5-10 minutes.  Or maybe I will keep things the same and use loaf bread.

AMAZING!!!! I made this for some weekend guests and it was a huge hit! I'm sooo keeping this recipe! Oh, and I grind up my own cinnamon which makes a wonderful impact also I used a very hearty wheat bread that added a delightful slight heaviness to it.

We loved this recipe!  I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13" pan.  I also added a can of sugar free apple pie filling on the top of the mixture then sprinkled with the sugar and cinnamon.  We fed five adults and had a bit left over!

This was pretty good. I agree with some of the other reviews that the flavour was a little lacking. It was much tastier after I added warm maple syrup over the top. We had turkey bacon the side and it was very yummy. I added pumpkin pie spice to the milk and egg mixture as well. I think one person's suggestion of putting crispy, crumbled bacon on the top would be spectacular!

This was ok.  Nothing spectacular.  My kids thought it was ok but aren't asking for me to make it again.  It definitely needed more spices to add more flavor.  I might make it again but add more ingredients!

This recipe is fabulous !! I have been making it for over 3 years now  and it is always a hit at home, get-togethers or potlucks !! Whenever my teenage son has friends staying over they always request it ! I am actually making it for my son's birthday tomorrow at his request as well as his friends..Don't forget to sprinkle on a a little powdered sugar..trust me..there won't be any leftovers !

Very good. I had fondue last night for dinner and had leftover bread cubes from cheese fondue and leftover pound cake cubes from the chocolate fondue. I put both of these in it and it was an excellent breakfast.

This recipe is so easy and you don't have to let it sit overnight!  I've made it several times following the recipe exactly and it's always a hit.  Once I topped it with cooked apples instead of maple syrup, then dusted with powdered sugar, yum!!!

it was super fast, easy as can be, and i cooked it a few extra minutes and stirred half way through and took other people's advice, but i would not make again, think making it the old fashioned way tastes better

We loved it!!
I used a "small" 8x8 glass casserole dish, and used day old hearty wheat bread, and baked in a convection oven for 40min.  Next time, I would use a 9x9 glass pan, and add some nutmeg.  Will make again!!

This was YUMMY!  I served it to a group while camping last weekend.  I served it with fresh blueberries & sliced strawberries.  I also added a light coat of powered sugar on top as soon as it came out of the oven.

I just made/served/ate this dish and I thought this was a very good recipe.  As written, it works.  However, I think it would be great recipe with changes and it's easily a recipe one could make their own.  As for reviews that discuss/rate their changes, I don't mind.  I love reading them and noting their changes...I read one that mentioned egg nog; I will DEFINITELY try that...sounds grand!

I didn't use the butter at all and used 100%whole wheat to make it more healthier and it still tasted great.  I did however had to stir it halfway into cooking as it didn't look like it was cooking quite right.

This was a winner!  I used 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and used brown sugar instead of white, and we all loved it even with the gluten free bread I used. I will definitely be making this again!

This was absolutely fantastic! Be sure that you soak the bread for 10 minutes as the recipe states. You want to make sure the bread soaks up the milk/ egg mixture. We used Hawaiian Sweet Bread as we do for regular French Toast. It's great for the job.

This tasted like a cross between fench toast and an omelette. It was great, but we were using up a sweet bread so I didn't add the sugar. The sweetness was not as good with so many eggs. If you alter the recipe, I recommend adding savory rather than sweet... Maybe chopped ham or mushrooms.

Sounded really good but it ended up being really soggy.  Maybe because I am use to the TOAST part of the french toast.  Smelled really good while cooking though.

This recipe was delicious!!  I followed it precisely and it came out perfect.  I had out of town guests and made this their first morning over.  On the second morning, I was going to make a "savory" breakfast of eggs, sausage, hash browns, etc......and they asked me to make this again instead!!  My kids loved it too!

Love this recipe, a great way to use up stale bread.  I did find that it probably only serves 4.  For the topping I used an additional tablespoon of brown sugar although some may find this a little too sweet. Thanks for sharing this recipe, Starflower.

This was absolutely delicious and will become my new way of making french toast from now on. It was crispy on top and creamy in the middle. YUMMY! : )
fyi...I did forget to butter my pan, so, I stuck butter chunks around the edges and inbetween the slices and it worked; no stickage : )

This recipe is yummy!!!! We made it for supper, and we used half low-fat vanilla yogurt and half milk instead of all milk and we added a bit of ginger in the cinnamon sugar mix.  Really good.

So easy that I toss it together during the week.  Hubby loves it, and I tried it with homemade wholewheat bread, expensive white and the cheapest white.  Love it any ole way!  Lighter breads are less identifiable, but the taste remains satisfying.

I made this recipe exactly as stated and it turned out great!  I used french bread that I needed to use up which worked great.  My family loved it and I plan on making this again - maybe for our church breakfast potluck.  So delicious - no changes needed.

Two of my three children who love french toast didn't like this recipe at all (too soggy).  I am always on the look out for easy, yummy breakfast ideas, but after trying this one it appears that I will keep looking.  I won't be making this one again. BTW, I followed the recipe to the T.

Excellent and super easy to make!  I cut the recipe in half since I only wanted a few servings, which worked out just fine.  For some added flavor, I included sliced peaches which was delicious!  This has quickly become a favorite of mine.

The best with challa bread. Very good, pack the cups with bread crumb though when you measure. Mine came out spoungy too much eggs at the bottom. But I don't think I used enough bread. Next time I will pack the cups, and I bet that does the trick! AWESOME

This recipe is so easy and so delicious it has become a favorite of mine. I love the fact that it doesn't have to sit overnight and since my husband and I are empty nesters it's plenty. I have used French bread, dinner rolls, and hot dog buns. I think a little heavier bread holds up better and it's a great way to use up bread that's just a little older that might otherwise ruin.

Very easy and a GREAT recipe for using up leftover breads. I've made it twice and last time even used some leftover angelfood cake I found in the freezer. For the 2 T sugar on top, I use 2 pkts of Natural sugar. It adds a nice crunch. After my 1st 2c bread, I added 1/2 diced, peeled apple, sprinkled cinnamon, and some chopped pecans. Add 2 more c bread and do the same. After final cup, I sprinkle with cinnamon again, add egg mixture (with an additional egg to bump up protein, 6 is fine 7 is too eggy), then top with the natural sugar. Next time time we have overnight company, I'm going to try preparing the night before so I can pop it in the oven for a fast breakfast.

This is just what I was looking for. I made it before bed (and sprinkled a handful of frozen blueberries in it) and had my husband put it in the oven when he got up. Very good. Just the right size for two adults a four year old and a 23 month old.

This was very good.  The kids didn't love it mostly because of the blackberry jam.  I think next time, I would try a different flavor of jam.  The adults loved it though.

I HAD THIS FOR BREAKFAST YESTERDAY.  I CALCULATED IT FOR 4 BECAUSE IT WAS JUST MY HUSBAND AND I.  I THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE SOME LEFTOVER THAT I COULD WARM UP. HOWEVER MY HUSBAND LIKED IT SO MUCH HE HAD SECONDS AND THAT WAS IT.  IT WAS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.  FOLLOWED THE RECIPE ALL THE WAY EXCEPT I DOTTED THE TOP WITH BUTTER INSTEAD OF MARGARINE.  I USED PEPPERIDGE FARM WHITE BREAD BECAUSE I LIKE ALL THEIR BREAD PRODUCTS.  IT WAS OUTSTANDING.  THANK YOU SO MUCH.  WILL BE SURE TO MAKE IT AGAIN.  Peggy

Made no alterations except used up day old leftover mini croissants.  It baked to a puffy perfection and made the whole kitchen smell good. My husband loved it an wanted to make sure that I add it to my recipe box!  Thanks for the tasty and very easy recipe.

My whole family (5 kids and husband) loved this one.  I did not 'tweak' it at all.  French toast you don't have to stand over!  Just throw it in the oven!  Next time I may add some walnuts/pecans to the top, maybe.  But it's certainly fabulous just as is.

It was a bit dry, but I also used a 9x13 pan because I didn't have the size in the recipe.  I will try it again but add a bit more egg mixture and possibly use a "fancier" bread.

Made this casserole this morning when it was 45 degree outside.  It warmed up the house and smelled wonderfully as it baked.  We enjoyed it with blueberrie and bananas and maple syrup.  I used multigrain bread to make it more healthy.  I can't wait to experiment with this recipe for our Sunday morning breakfasts.

Good recipe.  I am new to cooking in general so I follow the recipe to the T, and rate it on that. Although for this recipe I only had a 9x13 pan, and used that instead of the 8x8. The middle was pretty soggy, and had very little flavour.  I was reading some of the changes on reviews, and a lot of people added nutmeg, and/or cream cheese, I would do that next time, and hopefully there would be more flavour, and maybe cook it longer next time (I cooked it for 50 minutes)

I made it EXACTLY as written.  It was just a little bit dry, but the flavor was yummy.  Not sure if I will make again.  It was good, but not great.  I think I'd rather have real french toast.

A very tasty and simple recipe.  The only problem I ran into was that the middle didn't firm up, so for the sake of not burning the top, that's how we ate it (don't get me wrong, it was still very good).  I didn't cover the dish while it was in the oven, so I will try that next time to see if it helps. Aside from that, a great dish! :)

my family loved this!!!  i loved this!!!  made it in my glass pie pan, used 1 cup rice milk and only 3 eggs, and 5 slices of bread cubed.  maybe a tad more of the vanilla, cause i love it so much.  But this was fantastic!  i loved the way the cinnamon sugar got deliciously crunchy on the top!  a winner in my book!  perfect for brunch!

This is a great base for the imagination.  It was delicious as is and opened the door for some creativity as well.  I had some International Delight hazelnut creamer for my coffee and it was getting close to expiration so I used in place of some milk.  I've also made it with half and half.  I like the bagel idea and will try that.  It's always great to see others' suggestions.

Other reviews said it was soggy, so I used 1 cup of milk. Shouldve used more like the recipe said!  I mixed the cinnamon in the milk, egg mixture.  Overall though, I think it turned out great! I know it'd be 5 stars if I had used more milk, so that's what im giving it. will definitely make again

This was really tasty.  I used Panettone that I had bought at Christmas.  I had to cook the full 50 minutes and I let it sit for 5 to help it setup.

Almost a 5 star! The aroma and appearance were great, but the consistency was a little runny and the flavor was a bit bland. I may try and pump it up a bit with less liquid, some nutmeg, and a pinch more salt

I followed directions exactly and it turned out completely uncooked in the middle.  I kept it in the oven for an additional 20 minutes, and it just got more crispy on the top, but still didn't cook the middle.  Not sure what went wrong.

This was pretty good!!  Not too sweet like some I've had before.  I used slices of french bread and pre-made this on Christmas Eve.  I put it  in the fridge overnight so I could easily put it in the oven Christmas morning.  I also substituted 1/2 of the milk for egg nog just because I had some and thought it would give it more flavor!!

Great recipe but I always put my own spin.  I used King's Hawaiian bread as the cubes.  I used butter instead of margarine.  And, I didn't measure the sugar/cinnamon topping, just sprinkled it on.  It was PERFECT!  I only wish I had doubled it :)

This recipe did not work out for me.  I even left the pan in the oven for over an hour and the inside was not completely cooked.  I followed the recipe exactly- except I used Better than eggs instead of real eggs- I wonder if this is the problem.  Next time, I will skip the casserole and just make real french toast.

I first made this recipe last week, and I followed the recipe exactly. It was ok, but it just tasted like plain french toast, nothing special so not really worth the effort. Also, I made this in an 8x8 like the recipe says to, and it bubbled over and made a mess! So I decided to make it again and put spin on it. I used 4 cinnamon raisin bagels, chopped into about 1/2 inch pieces. This time I used a 9x13 and it worked much better. I sprinkle the top with 1 TB each of butter and brown sugar. It had a nice sweetness to it and I almost didn't even need syrup. This is the way I will be making my casserole from now on!

Made this this morning because I had sooo much bread.  I used 6 cups of country white bread instead of 5 and drizzled pure maple syrup over the cinnamon sugar topping, but kept all the other measurements and baked it in a 8 x 11, I think, pan.  Came out perfect - not soggy!  Kids love it. Could even add more syrup to individual plates.

This is great. It doubles well. I add pecans to the top, bake until almost done and then add a couple handfuls of frozen blueberries on top for the last 10 minutes of baking.

I found this to be really runny after cooking past the recommended cook time...I must have done something wrong. I would not make this again, it would have been easier to make regular french toast.

This was good; I really wanted to love it, but there was too much of an eggy taste for me.  I even decreased the amount of eggs to 3 instead of 4.  However, it is very easy to make and I feel certain most people would really enjoy it (and I'd eat it, because it's good despite the egg issue-- that's just me not being a big fan of eggs!).  I will definitely keep the recipe on hand for company.  By the way, I used brown sugar and cinnamon bread, and toasted it in the oven first.  The bread didn't turn out soggy.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was skeptical about this recipe, but it turned out to be awesome! Also won over my family! Would be great to make for a large breakfast crowd. I used quite a bit more of the egg/milk custard than the recipe says, but that might be because I used crusty dried out bread that we would have thrown away.

This was good, but I think I still prefer my french toast teh original way. I found it a bit eggy in the middle even though it cooked for longer than prescribed. Still good though.

It saved a whole loaf of stale bread!  I like making french toast this way compared to pan frying.  It tastes less 'eggy' and it's crunchier this way, too.

I was so excited to make this.  It smelled sooo good cooking.  My family could not wait to get at it.  However.... the middle never finished cooking (as stated in other reviews).  It was just raw.. It smelled great.. so I give that a star.  One of these days I may try it again.

I made this for my son and a bunch of his friends (17-18yrs) for a birthday breakfast and it was a hit! It was devoured. I wasn't sure what kind of bread I should use but I found a really soft freshly made white bread at my local health food store. Normally I would use only whole grain breads but I wanted it to be more of a traditional french toast.

I was hesistant to try this, since a lot of the reviews said it was soggy. Glad I tired it! I used a whole bag of cinnamon raisin bread (16 ounces). The night before cooking, I cut each piece into 4 squares. Also, mixed the eggs, milk, sugar, salt and vanilla the night before. In the morning, I mixed the bread with the egg mixture, put in a 8x8 pan and let sit for 10 minutes. I cooked it for about an hour. While the middle was slightly soggy, it was totally fine, similiar to bread pudding. And no problem with the food sticking to the dish. Overall, the guests LOVED it and I will be making again very soon! FYI it only feed about 4 adults. Enjoy!

I made this for a breakfast potluck and it got rave reviews!  Very easy to make! I ended up doubling the recipe and the bottom of the casserole was a little soggy but still delicious.  Next time I might put a little less egg or milk if I'm doubling things up.

couldn't find the bread cubes at my grocery store, so i cubed up an entire package of texas toast...G-O-O-D! the top came out sorta crunchy, but still can't decide if i liked it! maybe next time i'll cover with foil for the 1st half, then uncover for the second half. otherwise, it was great, picky 3 yr old actually ate everything too!

I made this along side Amish Breakfast Casserole...My kids 3 & 7, love French Toast! This was easy to make... it did take a little longer to bake, then the directions say...but every oven is different.  I cut out some of the bread with cookie cutters of stars, and laid those on the top.  It really looked cute... and YUMMY... thanks for sharing

A great recipe for stale bread with either whole slices or cubed bread. If cubed, I sometimes add raisins or dried cranberries and bake in a muffin tin; great for breakfast on the run.

Oh, one more thing. I did not use bread cubes, I sliced bakery bread (Italian) into 1" thick slices and cut in half when necessary to cover the bottom of the pan. Mine was not soggy at all. I did have to cook it a bit longer than 50 mins, probably 55-60 mins. total.

This recipe in general reminded me of my Mom's bread pudding, minus the cinnamon.  My husband would never eat the bread pudding, but this he ate. My husband enjoyed the casserole with syrup, but I liked it without. My husband told me to put this dish in with my normal cooking rotation.

I made this recipe exactly as stated. The flavor was really good. However, make sure you serve right away!  I covered in foil to keep warm which I finished cooking and the whole thing flopped terribly. We actually didn't eat it because it then was so soggy it was not appealing at all. I feel compelled to mention this as I wouldn't want anyone else to have the same experience!

This was very good, we had it for breakfast on Christmas morning.  I used about 3/4 of a Pepperidge Farm Cinnamon Raisin Swirl loaf and only used 3 eggs due to the other reviews that said it was too "eggy".  It only took about 30 mins in my oven.  Served it with maple syrup and a side of sausage, and it was delicious.

This was great!  I doubled the recipe and combined the cubes and egg mixture in a separate bowl, then transferred it to a 9 X 13 with a slotted spoon.  There was no extra egg and it turned out great.  Several people asked for the recipe.  Will definitely make again.

I used cubed french bread, and let it sit overnight in the fridge. I also used a 9X13 pan in hopes of avoiding sogginess. It didn't work. It was extremely soggy after the 45 minutes. I added aluminum foil to keep the top from burning and put it back in the oven. Still soggy. I would have given it one star, but I'm not sure if maybe it's supposed to be squishy. But that's not how I like mine.

This is a Excellent Recipe. I haven't made it yet, but I went to a get-together and one of my friends brought this and explained how she made it the exact way. The only change she said she had made was instead of Dotting the bread with Margarine, she used Cream cheese! Delicious! I'm going to make this recipe this morning the same way but put Frozen Blueberries in it!!

Have made this twice for my family, and will keep making it.  Actually easier to make than individual french toasts, and very easy to tweak and play with.  Haven't had problem with soggy bread (I use the cheap french bread bought at many supermarkets, torn into pieces) but you might try covering the dish while it bakes.

Quick easy and delicious! Prepare this first and throw it in the oven while you prepare the rest of breakfast. I added a dollop of cream cheese filling ontop each with fruit when serving!

This recipe did not work by following the directions. It was mushy and not thoroughly cooked. You would be better off making French Toast the traditional way.

Made this recipe for the first time on Christmas, it was delicious! I used cinnamon swirl bread and made a fresh blueberry topping. While the french toast casserole itself was good, it was much better with the fruit topping; that is why I gave it 4 stars.

My mom left two loaves of italian bread that was getting stale.  So I cut off the sesame seeds and cut it into cubes.  I found this recipe in my recipe box so it was perfect!  It made just enough for me and my hubby.  This is a perfect recipe for company since it is easy to double/triple if necessary.  I made myself a small plate and told me hubby that breakfast was on the oven.  He walks by with the entire casserole dish and a fork!  Within minutes it was completely gone.  I said to him "Guess you liked it!"  The ease of this recipe makes it a keeper!  Next time I think I will add some fresh blueberries.

Yum!  I made this and my family loved it.  I used whole wheat cinnamon swirl bread and it was the right amount of moisture.  This is a keeper.  I like that you don't have to prepare the night before and that you use cubes.  I like to throw bread that is getting old in the freezer and make french toast from them.  Now I don't have to stand over the skillet and make in batches while folks wait.  Thanks!

EXCELLENT!  Made one for the holiday and substituted Egg Nog for the Milk.  It was a huge hit!  The professional chef in the family asked for the recipe:)!

This was pretty good.  I used "French Toast" bread that I get at the supermarket, which has a maple taste already.  I then used some egg nog instead of milk as some reviewers suggested and found that between that and the already-flavored bread it was TOO MUCH.  Still, it was a fun Christmas morning dish ....but I think I prefer regular french toast.

Made this christmas for bruch and the fam loved it. Only changes I made was to cover with seran wrap and place cans on top and refrigerate for 1 hour before I put in the oven. Also used half  evaporated milk and half lowfat milk.  While baking I covered it with foil. Top with strawberries and cool whip and was divine.

This was an excellent addition to our Christmas day brunch.  We did have to do some tweaking though.  We used a little more than 5 cups of bread cubes to keep it from being mushy and added brown sugar to the top it of it.  We loved the crispy top texture along with the softer middle.  Yummy!

I made this today for Christmas breakfast and it was good! The recipe mentions bread cubes, but the photo above shows the bread more in slices. I broke the bread up in cubes but would probably slice it next time. Also, I had left over sugar / cinnamon topping, so I'd reduce that a bit. Lastly, I sprinkled mine with powered sugar at the end, which is my favorite way to eat it. This was an easy, yummy recipe that I'd recommend for people who love french toast!

This was great for Xmas morning. This is what my gang likes. Just assemble bake and go about your business. I only gave this 3 stars because the recipe has a misprint which caused me some grief. It says 1/4 cup of sugar but asks for tablespoons in and on. How can 4 tablespoons be 1/4 cup. Also I really thought this could use some confectioners sugar for on top, Who knows maybe that is what was meant by white sugar. In any case it was good and I will make it again for sure.

This would have tasted good if it had cooked in the specified time.  It was really soggy and I'm not sure if it was supposed to be that way or not.  Very frustrating start to Christmas morning.

I just didn't care for this. It didn't taste as custardy as I like my French toast to taste. I gave all of it away to a friend, who loved it. I used Challah bread.

It's Christmas morning and I made this with some leftover Pannetone (that round Italian holiday bread).  I used half a round of Pannetone and the measurements listed here, using slightly more vanilla.  I sprinkled brown sugar and chopped walnuts on top.  After pouring the egg mixture onto the bread cubes, I let it sit for 15 minutes.  Then I stirred the bread cubes thoroughly to saturate evenly with the egg mix.  I baked in a 12 3/4 in x 10 3/8 in. disposable aluminum pan covered with foil for the first 30 minutes.  I then took the foil off for 14 minutes.  It looked set, so I took it out and covered with foil until ready to serve.  It was perfect!

I added the extra sugar and butter in to the casserole rather than sprinkling on top, and added a cup of blueberries.  Great!  Next time, maybe diced bananas. We had this as a side dish with "breakfast for dinner" with eggs and sausage, my husband really liked it.

Delicious!  The baking gives it a crispier texture on the outside than what you normally get with regular french toast, yet stays soft inside.  My husband loved it.

I doubled the recipe and put it in a 9x13 pan.  I cooked it almost 30 minutes longer and it was extremely mushy and seemed undercooked.  Very disappointing, won't make it again...

very good recipe.  I used a whole loaf of Pepperidge Farm Cinnamon bread plus a few slices of oatmeal bread.  It turned out great!  I will definitely make it again.

I just made this this morning and I have to say it was a hit. It was delish. The only thing I did was use butter spray instead of butter. I will def. be making it again

I made this for a baby shower that was around brunch time and everyone RAVED about it. Sweet enough without being too sweet. Great with or without maple syrup. I doubled the recipe and made it in a 9x13 and even though it didn't look like it was all going to fit, it did. Baked it at the temp recommended for 60 mins. Really great! Highly recommend.

Eh - it was okay. The inside turned out soggy, so I only really at the top that turned out toasty. We ate some while it was hot, but I doubt we'll touch the leftovers in the fridge. I'm sure they'll end up getting dumped out in a few days. Not a keeper for me.

Having made dozens of bread puddings/stratas similar in consistency, I elected to use a larger pan (specifically because a too-thick layer of custard-soaked bread may lead to sogginess, as I've learned from past experiments). Also, I always let mine sit for a few hours, if not overnight. The ingredients are fine for this base recipe to which different fruit, nuts, etc. could be added as available.

My husband and I, along with our company, thought this was delicious.  I did bake it about an hour, covering the casserole with aluminum foil when the top was "golden."  I didn't use any sugar in the custard recipe, but I did sprinkle a tad on the top before baking.  I also forgot to dot it with butter this time and it wasn't missed.  Next time, I'm going to skip the white sugar altogether and simply sprinkle powdered sugar on the top after it has baked.   Last time I made this I made a brown sugar, butter, and corn syrup mixture for the top...  I liked it better just adding pancake or maple syrup after baking.

Great recipe, added an extra slice/two of bread b/c I don't really like soggy casseroles and it turned out perfect.  For topping: mixed sugar, brown sugar, and pecans and sprinkled all over.  After baking, let it rest 10 minutes.  Great as leftovers for next morning.

This was just okay.  A little too soggy in the middles, and while it smelled really good while cooking, I still prefer regular french toast.

This was so good!  It seemed that I used a little extra bread once I had actually cut it up, so I used an extra egg and a splash of milk.  I also put some apples on the bottom for something extra.  It smelled fantastic cooking, and the whole house smelled like warm and cozy breakfast (even though I made it for dinner)!  The top was a little crunchy, but the flavor was so good that I didn't mind much.

I think this recipe is very good. Instead of butter I used cream cheese and topped it with berry syrup. It was great like that also instead of the maple syrup and butter.

My whole family loved this dish. My three kids gobbled this up in no time flat. I liked that I could throw it together and let it bake instead of having to flip individual french toast slices. I will definitely be making this again because it is so easy. 

We made no changes to the original recipe but I could imagine it would be good if I added chopped walnuts or dried fruit. And definitely serve it up with maple syrup!

Made this thanksgiving morning, oven rack was to close to heating element, I think, soggy on the bottom and dried out on top.  Most wouldn't touch it.  I liked how easy it was, next time I might stir it half way thru.

I used 1doz eggs, and let it sit overnight, in the morning, before putting it in the oven, I stirred the bread around (I found that this keeps the top from drying out, as does covering it in foil to bake). My two little girls and my husband loved it.

I made this recipe tonight for a treat and my son who doesnt like eggs or anything complicated loved it.  I let him put some syrup on it and he is asking me when the next time he can have this.  The bread came a little soggy but that was just fine for him.

I *hate* giving poor reviews but I did this EXACTLY and the top burned (on the middle rack) and it was SOOOO dry! By reading the other reviews I trusted it and made this the morning of my sister's baby shower brunch... big mistake! I showed up with no casserole... EEekkk! I keep re-reading the recipe to make sure it wasn't something I did... maybe I needed specialty bread?!

A perfect recipe!!!!  Made the whole house smell great, too.  In the future, I will try making different variations - apple, pear, pumpkin, orange zest.  The original recipe needed no adaption to be delicious, though.  All 5 of us gave it 5 stars...nearly an impossible thing to achieve for any recipe!

This was really good. I cut the milk down to 1 cup and forgot to put the butter on top, so I put it on after it baked. I also forgot to butter the dish...I would definitly recommend that, but it wasn't a huge problem. Sprinkled the top w/ brown sugar instead of white along w/ the cinnamon. Had a great flavor and my kids really liked it, but for a family of 7, it didn't make enough. Otherwise, nice recipe and will certainly make again. Much easier than standing over the stove top frying french toast. :)

I made this recipe several times for my family. They just love it. I cook it for 30 to 45 minutes and it is just right. My kids cannot get enough of it and I had to go and buy a bigger baking dish so there would be enough for them to have seconds. My husband even likes it when I make it for dinner and he used to be a firm believer that only meat and potatoes was dinner not breakfast items.

I made this in an 11x7 pan (I didn't have a bigger one clean). It was still a bit soggy in the middle but most of the kids didn't seem to care. I could tell by the 'shimmy' that it was still soggy so I kept letting it cook, but then I got it a little burnt. But we just added a little more butter melted over top with some syrup and it seemed fine. For those who complained here at home...couldn't have been that bad since there wasn't any left!!! I will definitely try this again in a 9x13 pan to see if it gets less soggy.

This recipe was delicious. However, I did make a few tweaks and made it for 3 servings. I used half sugar/half spenda and added some maple syrup on top before baking. I tasted it about 30 minutes in (and it was done, by the way) and added a bit more and then baked it for an additional 5 minutes. I used a whole grain bread and it soaked all the liquid up! Next time I will add some more milk, maybe some half and half, but mine wasn't soggy at all. Also, like others I added more cinnamon and some nutmeg. Thanks for this great recipe and all the variations!

I made this for our Christmas morning breakfast today, and it was great. The only change I made was to use Cinnabun cinnamon bread. It makes all the difference in the world. Also, bake this in a 13x9 pan so it won't become soggy. Will make this again and again.

Great Recipe keeper in my house. I actually cooked it for a family dinner. It is great for one of thous nights that you don't have alot in the pantery and not alot of time.. I did use Brown sugar rather then White. Made my house smell wonderful while baking and my husband tried to go back for seconds but just couldn't ne more because he was full. It is also is cleaning eating for toddlers....

Finally!  A french toast casserole that does not have to sit overnight.  A necessity for those of us preparing meals by the "seat of our pants".  I just made it and it was a hit.  Thanks!

It's funny because in the UK we call this Bread and Butter pudding and eat it as a pudding after a meal.

It's delicious in anycase

Reminded me of a custard pie my mother used to make. It's was an okay dish. My husband raved about it. I think it could've used a little something more. I'll make this again but I'll make some of the changes the other reviewers made.

I've made similar recipes and had trouble with them being soggy, but that was not the case with this one. I baked it for a full hour, and it was just perfect. I really like the cinnamon sugar on top, and I added some nutmeg as well. This will definitely be made again.

Although my husband loves this dish, I didn't enjoy it at all. After taking it out of the oven, I thought it looked delicious, but after the first bite I couldn't eat any more. Like previous ratings have said, it was very soggy for my taste. But, like I said, my husband loves it!

YUMBO!  If you like french toast, you'll like this because it tastes just like french toast!  Very yummy, totally simple...much easier than preparing classic french toast for a crowd.  I'll definitely make again.

This was a great breakfast on Christmas morning. Everyone Loved it. I let it set overnight and did not have any problem with the bottom layer being soggy.  It was just soft, and the top was nice and crusty.  I put all of the sugar and cinnamon in the mixure and poured it all in.  Then mixed together 2T sugar and the recommended cinnamon and sprinkled that on top, and it was perfect not too sugary but also didn't need syrup.  I also skipped the butter.

I was in the mood for french toast and found this which I decided to try for change of paste.  Well, despite the fact that I was out of vanilla, I made it anyway and it was delicious, easy and mouth watering.  I am going to try it again with vanilla.

I agree, this tastes just like french toast, except it's a cross between that and bread pudding. Next time, I'll cook it for a little longer. I topped it off with some sauted apples and it was delicious. No syrup necessary!

Fast and less messy than making French Toast the normal way!  I added cinnamon and brown sugar as I always like those additions.  I also used regular bread.  Pretty fool proof; do what you want!

Was a little too "moist" for my son and hubby (even though I had used extra bread than called for)...I on the other hand enjoyed it.  My hubby and son thought it had more of a "bread pudding" taste and texture.

This was a great brunch recipe.  I used all of the milk it called for and it wasn't too soggy.  I also used challah bread cut into pieces and it was great.  I received a lot of good compliments.  I plan on making it again for our next brunch.

I used the French Toast bread cut into cubes - there is a variety with cinamon and maple syrup flavorings.  It is quick and easy.

I needed something for dinner in a hurry and did not feel like cooking too much.  Breakfast for dinner sounded good so I tried this.  Everyone loved it!!!  I adjusted the liquid based on previous reviews and had no problems.  I also sent one to work with my husband and got rave reviews too!!

I made it how the recipe  said to came out moist and a little tasty but to bland for my family’s taste buds. I will make it again and put in some additions like bacon or sausage.

Tripled the recipe and cooked it in an 11 in. x 15 in. casserole dish.  Fully cooked in 1 hr.  Very easy and tasty.  Made as written except accidentally included the cinnamon and sugar topping part in with the custard.  Will probably keep doing it that way because it's easier to mix everything up in one bowl.

My kids love this dish.  We did follow the modifications to mix the bread with the egg mixture, but otherwise we make this as is.  Guests love this as well.  So great to eat with a bit of maple syrup.

Made this for my kids they loved it! I made 2 one with bread one with cinnamon raisin bagels the one thing I would suggest is cook it the night before then reheat when ready to eat the first time it was kind of soggy but when we reheated it it was a million times less soggy

I was looking for something new and special to make for breakfast on New Year’s Day and tried this recipe for the first time.  It was delicious and my family loved it.  I’m placing it in my recipe box and it will definitely make it again.   As many other reviews have stated, the beauty of it is that you can revise this recipe by adding a wide variety of other ingredients to make it yours.  Enjoy!

This is good! I was looking for a way to use up dried out bread. I doubled everything and put in a 9x13 metal pan. I didn't quite use all of the liquid mixture and I took it out of the oven after 20 mins. I think this would be good with apple chunks in it, too!

I added raisins and little bits of cream cheese and mixed it all up the night before.  It took about an hour to cook the next day. It was fantastic!  It has now become our Christmas morning tradition.  (Served with maple syrup)

This was delicious. I made it smaller than what it calls for so I used 3 eggs instead of 4. Also needed dairy free so equal amount of almond milk instead of regular. Finally I subbed brown sugar in with the custard but white sugar for the sprinkle on top. Baked up well, no leftovers. Yummy!

Next time I will have to change up the recipe a bit, the middle was too runny & needed extra time in the oven.

Also, I used 2.5 cups regular bread cubes & 2.5 cups cinnamon swirl bread and it added an extra cinnamon taste, for the people saying there isn't enough cinnamon in the recipe.

DELICIOUS! This is simple, comfort food at its best. I made the recipe exactly as written except I baked it in a 9x13 pan due to an oversight...and because I'm a little bit stupid..still, it was fabulous. I scooped it out straight from the oven, drizzled melted butter over each serving and topped with maple syrup. The casserole is crunchy on top and quite moist in the center. This recipe is a wonderful base recipe for a multitude of your own variations.

I made it just as the recipe states, but added some diced up cooked breakfast sausage.  I used up all the misc bread products I had laying around, so my hopes weren't high.  I baked it 50- 60 minutes  It was delicious and tasted just like french toast.

This was the easiest french toast ever.  I'll never do it one by one on the stove top again.  The best thing about it is you can play with it and add as much or as little sugar as you want.  And you can experiment with adding other things to it like raisins or blueberries.  You can use cinnamon swirl bread  or raisin bread instead of french.  My husband wanted to get fancy and add Kahlua.  I told him we'd save that for a Sunday adult brunch.  LOL

I didn’t have time for the overnight recipes, so I followed this recipe and made the following changes:
Instead of bread, I bought and thawed frozen Eggo French toast sticks. 1 and 1/2 boxes. Guarantees flavor in each bite versus bread that may not fully absorb the egg mixture in the quick ten minutes. 
Instead of 1 1/2 cups of milk, I used 1 1/4 cup half-n-half and 1/4 cup water
For the sugar and cinnamon topping, I made a white sugar (4 parts) + brown sugar (2 part) + cinnamon (1 part) mixture. I covered the casserole in a thorough layer of the mixture before placing in the oven. I put leftovers of the mixture in a shaker/spice bottle for later use. 
Baked the casserole for 45 minutes, added a few more thin dollops of butter, put back in oven on low broil for 3-5 minutes. The broil + added butter + sugar topping makes a delicious, crisp top over moist bottom layer. 
No syrup needed!

I made as written except I baked it in a 9x13   pan.  This reduced  the cook time  to about 30 minutes.   I won’t make this again. Guests said it was good but I think they were being polite.  :)

D-lish!  Made just a few changes as others have suggested.  Used a loaf of white bread that was a "take home" from a restaurant a couple of days earlier. Substituted  2 tbsp of white sugar with brown sugar in egg mixture and added 1oz of brandy.   The amount of brandy used provided just the slightest hint of flavoring and was perfect!  Also added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg to topping of cinnamon and white sugar.  This recipe is a keeper!

Made it in a 9x13 pan, and I definitely saw why the directions called for an 8x8...the top layer of bread didn't soak up as much of the egg. But it didn't matter because it was still sooooo delicious, especially with maple syrup!

A great, easy way to satisfy a craving for old-fashioned french toast, without all the mess and time standing at the stove.  The only changes I make are to use some fresh ground nutmeg in the topping (my son has an aversion to cinnamon) and dot it with butter instead of margarine.  Otherwise I follow the recipe as written, and it turns out great every time.  A real winner!

I made this recipe exactly as written. When I look at reviews of recipes I cannot stand how people rate them based on the changes they made. So I’m reviewing this recipe as is with no changes. The recipe was good, my family all really liked it. I let it set for about 10 min before serving. The middle was a little wet but still tasted good. If I were to have baked it longer I feel like it may burn. If you want more flavor in the toast part, adding cinnamon and nutmeg to the milk and egg mixture would help. I would make this again as is.

This is a great way to feed a group breakfast all at once. I used challah bread for the cubes and did the whole loaf using a 13x9 pyrex dish. 6 eggs, 2 1/2 cups milk, 2 t vanilla. We opted for no sugar since we use maple syrup, cinnamon sugar, or preserves as toppings.

I make this every year for Christmas morning breakfast... the recipe,  as posted here,  is my base formula,  but I've developed some tweaks that put it over the top:
*sub heavy cream for milk
*sub Splenda for white sugar
*add 1/4 tsp nutmeg to sugar/cinnamon mixture
*add 1/4 cup brown sugar to sugar/spice mixture
*add 1/2 cup sugar free pancake syrup to sugar/spice mixture (creating a 'dressing') 
*stir 1/4 cup chopped,  cooked apples mixed into butter before adding to the top (can sub in apple pie filling)
--follow basic recipe, using substitutes and add ins. Pat on the butter (I mix the apples into the butter then chill in the freezer for 15 mins for easy 'patting'), then drizzle the syrup 'dressing' over the top.  Bake as directed.

Used a day old french bread loaf and substituted the milk for mocha peppermint creamer.  Used brown sugar but sprinkled white sugar over the top with cinnamon.   Also put it in a 9x13 casserole dish and baked for 1 hour.  Wow!  This is a keeper and very "Christmassy!"

I made 4 times the recipe for a realtor fundraiser breakfast. I assembled the night before then popped it in the oven the next morning. One of the dishes had a reviewers’ praline topping the other was plain. Also, I used challah bread per the bakery lady from my local Publix.

Very good. My son and wife and I really liked it.
Simple.  I added a little more volume for the 9x9 pan. I used the serving size changer on the top right to change it today for a 13 X 9 pan (which was a little less than double). And I let it soak a little longer before the cinnamon and sugar and baking it.  Very good and simple, just the type of recipes I like. (we like it with Maple syrup and whipped cream)

This was awful.  I never change the recipes I  here and make them to the T, but I wish I would have listened to other reviewers.  It definitely didn't seem cooked after the allotted cooking time.  The texture was pretty gross so I just  it back in the oven for another 10 minutes.  I have a feeling this is something we'll be throwing out.

This recipe is the best way to use up leftover hot dog etc buns that are getting a little to hard. It’s especially good using potato bread buns! My family loves it. I typically make it at 1+1/2 times the standard recipe in a 13x9 and it comes out perfectly at 45 minutes. Let it sit for 15 minutes before slicing.

I doubled the recipe, left the sugar out of the egg mixture and used a full litre of milk.  Everyone loved it, especially the cinnamon sugar crust.  Will definitely make again,,, and again.

I've made this a couple of times for a men's Bible study that my husband leads, and is always a hit. I cube a whole loaf of French bread then dry it out for about 10 minutes in a warm oven. Double the remaining ingredients in a large bowl, add the cubed bread, toss well, then spread into a greased 9" x13" pan. Cover and let sit in refrigerator overnight. Dot with butter and bake about 55-60 minutes. Perfect!

Ok, I’ve made this twice, with different bread, and got polar opposite results. The first time was great! Second time through, not so good. The inside/bottom was mushy. It can work, but I think you will really have adjust for the bread. From now on, I will reduce the liquid to 1 cup or less. The first bread I used was round dinner rolls. The second bread was sub rolls. It can work but I think you have be able to adjust to the bread. I also might try a 9x13 pan next time.

It was super good.  My picky roommate, who loves my regular French toast, really liked this.  I made the recipe as stated except I didn’t cook the butter mixture, just spread it in the pan.  Everything else as stated.  Did not find it too ‘eggy’ as some others did, for us it was just right, but we like eggs.  If I make any changes it will probably be to try different flavors like orange or blueberry.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious! I made it exactly as written, except I used some leftover "premium" hamburger buns cut up, as well as wheat bread (no crusts) because that's what I had on hand. I also doubled the vanilla just because I like vanilla. Since I didn't have an hour to bake it, I increased the heat to 400° and baked it for 30 min. It reminded me of a custard; delicious! Even my picky 1 year old ate it and kept asking for more!

First time making a French toast casserole. This dish was so easy to make and tasted delicious! I used butter instead of margarine and 1tsp of nutmeg at the end before baking. I also soaked the bread for an hour before baking them and it worked out perfectly. I think if you soak them overnight it'll be even more flavorful. I got so many people asking me for the recipe at the brunch we went to, it is a big crowd pleaser.

Used cinnamon raisin swirl bread so reduced the sugar a little but kept the cinnamon the same. Needed to add 5-10 extra minutes to the cook time  but it was easy and delicious. Will definitely make again.

This is ridiculously tasty. I used two packages of cream cheese because who cares and it was sooo creamy and rich. Also put lots of streusel on top.

This turned out great! I had a loaf of Italian bread that wasn’t fresh enough to slice and eat but still good enough to do something with. I have been ill and I needed something quick and easy- love that I didn’t have to let this sit over night.

This is very good!  I will definitely be making it many more times in the future especially when I am feeding a lot of people.  I thru in my left over hot dog buns that I no longer had a use for to the bread that I already planned on using.  They worked quite well and I did not waste the buns that would have been thrown away otherwise!

Made this for family brunch  and I actually liked it a lot.  However due to what i had on hand replaced about 1/2 cup of milk with cinnabon creamer,  and also added more cinnamon and a packet of vanilla sugar. If I hadn't done that I think this would've been a little blah. Made it with french bread that l cut up and let dry out first and let it set up overnight in fridge before baking in the morn. Served with pure Maple Syrup and my own berry sauce. Even tho I liked it there was still lots left over  as  everyone preferred the Belgian waffles and croissants I also had served. However I enjoyed the leftovers for the next couple days. Hubby thought that it was just ok but prefers traditionally made french toast. Not sure if I will make it again, but if I do I will definitely include the extra cinnamon and extra sugar and perhaps add some maple extract. Also perhaps a more firm bread.

An eggy gooey mess! We followed the recipe. 45 minuts  later it was still oozing egg mix. So back in for another 15 minutes. No longer dripping but still not "done". So we covered the top and 15 minutes later decided it was "suppoed to be gooey I guess". It gets an extra star because it IS tastey, if you dont mind the marbling of scrambled eggs in your french toast. More like  a weird bread pudding than french toast. Which isnt so bad, IF the recipe was called weird bread pudding ans not easy french toast.

Changes I made were 1 cup of eggnog 1/2 cup of cream in place of milk. Assembled it the night before so the bread soaked up the liquid but was still a little eggy. I baked 30 min covered 30 min uncovered. Taste was good with syrup.

I have never done a review on Allrecipes since I have been a member (which is forever) but I felt I had to say I LOVE this recipe.  It is so easy and tastes soooo good.  The only thing I would change is leaving it in the oven for a bit more.  Today I left it in for an hour and it was perfect.

This is a great recipe, though I spice mine up with maple sausage. I first come the sausage for a minute or two with maple syrup and than add it into the casserole mix. It's unbelievably good, like pure deliciousness in every bite. Don't make this dish to sweet as it destroys your pallet. Moderation is the key, owe and maple bacon is also a great alternative, even maple ham, mmmmm, I think I'm going to make this for breakfast in the morning. This time I'm going to add a few poached eggs on the side, peel the shell, and than open the whites over the casserole.

Trust me, it all mixes extremely well.

This was today's brunch.  Recipe serves 6??? I don't think so! Hubby and I had two pieces each and we were far from full.  It was tasty, especially with real maple syrup, but I'm not sure it was worth the calories.  I added a pinch of nutmeg.  Let it sit for about 5 min. out of the oven and  it was cooked through.

I followed the recipe exactly and the only thing I will change next drizzling some maple syrup on top while in the slow cooker. It needed just a little extra sweetness for my family, but my hubby and kids love sweets! Other than that, it was delicious! Will definitely make again!

Delicious! I made this in the slow cooker Christmas Day before we went to church. When we got back it was ready. (line the slow cooker or spray with non-stick spray. Was a bit of a mess to clean off crock.) I followed the recipe exactly except the cooking method. Quick and easy. There were no left overs!

I will def make this again. Everyone who was there to eat this loved it! I did half white and half light brown sugar. I also cut in cream cheese with the butter along the top and then drizzled maple syrup before sprinkling the cinnamon sugar mixture. I made this with about 6 cups of ciabatta.

It was so easy to make and got rave reviews, topped with maple syrup and fresh strawberries.  The left-overs were delicious the second day.

Also added 1/3 cup pancake mix to the liquids- used white bread. 50 minutes and let it sit for about 10. It's a little like bread pudding BUT it tasted really great and disappeared at the table- and that's what counts!

This was okay. I made it as is but it was pretty bland. If I make it again I will definitely make some changes. Probably some cinnamon to the custard mixture and I will add apples and raisins too.

This is good, but I do think it has a little too much custard.  It would be better with less liquid and/or baking in a larger dish to get it drier in the middle.

I have made this twice now in as many days: once by myself, and once with my boyfriend. The first time I added two tablespoons of brown sugar to the egg-milk mix and the second time we made it as written. Both turned out amazing! The one with brown sugar seemed a little stiffer and the one without was a bit more custardy at the center.

A few tips: If you're using store-bought sliced bread, toasting it a little can help to keep it from getting soggy. Both times I made it I also dipped each chunk of bread in the batter before putting it in the pan, and then poured the remaining batter over it. Use cinnamon sugar to taste- I personally think more is better. And letting it sit for a bit (about 15-20 minutes) after pulling it out of the oven can help to let it stiffen a little so it's not so gooey at the center.

All around, this was a huge hit in both households! I loved it, my boyfriend loved it, both our moms loved it, and even his little sister (usually a picky eater) came back asking for seconds. Will definitely make again and again! (Maybe with apples?)

I made this tonight and it was a hit! The only thing I "changed" was I followed a suggestion from a previous reviewer and made 2 pans...glad I did! Served with bacon & fruit and NOTHING was left. Simple and delicious!

this was good and I will make it again. the center was a little too squishy  though. I added about 1/4 cup brown sugar to the egg mixture, along with a couple dashes cinnamon. I forgot the pats of butter o  top, but didn't notice until I looked at the recipe again  days later.

This came out really well for the first time making it. My fiance is the judge for everything I make and he loved it so it's a keeper. I had to double the recipe since he eats a lot but that just means more leftovers during the week. I will definitely make it again,  maybe at the next family gathering.

I followed the recipe except I melted the sugar and butter in the microwave. Reading all the reviews about difficult cleanup, I put a silpad in the bottom of my baking dish. My family enjoyed it but the sugar stayed crunchy which I didn't like. Not sure why, but maybe either microwaving or using the silpad caused the problem. It was so crunchy, I felt like I was eating sand!

Made this for Christmas breakfast w my son & daughter-in-law. As suggested by others, I used only 4 eggs & reduced the karo syrup. It was amazing! Obviously this is rich & sweet, not a regular weekend breakfast, but for a special occasion, it is perfect!

EASY, whipped it up quick using up some crusty buns leftover from dinner the night before. The only change I made was  doubling the recipe and baking it in a larger pan. Still got all scarfed down in no time!

I'm sorry to say this was not what I expected.  Thinking maybe if I mixed some of the cinnamon sugar into egg mixture would make it more uniform..tasted too much of the egg.  Or changed bread (mine turned into mush).  Maybe cooking  longer as other reviews suggested.

I liked this. It was easy. I baked it for 55 min instead of 50. It was a little eggy though. It came out of the oven looking puffy and beautiful and then went flat lol but I'd make it again.   It wasn't goopy in the middle.

Fantastic!

I add a sprinkle of spices in the casserole.  I added a tad bit of nutmeg to the mix on top.  

It totally disappeared on Christmas morning after the presents.

I used raisin bread - could have used french toast and added in raisins to make it thicker.  Also used soy milk since I have lactose intolerance - could not taste any difference. 

Great for Christmas morning!

We loved it as is!  I doubled the entire recipe and put it in a 9x13 dish, using leftover wheat bread, italian bread,  and HOT DOG BUNS!  I put it in the fridge overnight and then sprinkled the cinnamon/sugar mixture on the top with the butter before putting it into the oven.  The only real change I made was changing the oven temp to 375 degrees and cooked it for about 55 minutes.  It was fantastic!

Simple and delicious.Used half of a large loaf of dry french bread (8 cups of 1" cubes) to make 9x13 pan and made 1.5 times recipe.  Used more cinnamon in the batter and on top. Mixed the butter (2-3T) with the sugar and cinnamon and spread over the top. Was great when let rest overnight too. Served with apple cider syrup (1/2 c sugar, 1c apple cider, 1T cornstarch, 1T lemon juice, 2t cinnamon, 1T butter. Boil until thick). Amazing!

Recipe is not sweet enough and I think making regular French toast is faster, but it was fun to try.  I added apples and blueberries which my family liked.

Very easy and delicious tasting. I omitted the margarine to save on calories and used cinnamon bread since it's what I had. I used cooking spray to grease the pan and had no issues with sticking. Baked it for closer to an hour and it was perfect!

Light and Fluffy.

Substituted 1/4 C granular Xylo Sweet for the 1/4 C Sugar. 
Substituted Grass Fed Butter for Margarine.

Used French bread, tore it up by hand into chunks, place crust sides down.  Make sure to press them completely under the liquid mixture.  Came out delicious !  

Use a good maple syrup on this one, I recommend Andersons (grade B)  Grade B has richer flavor, darker color, yum. You can get it on Amazon.

Simple and not time consuming. I doubled the recipe to fill a 9x12 pan. Only alteration I made was subbing margarine for butter since I never buy that stuff.

Made this a few days ago and my kiddos are begging me to make it again which am doing now! They loved it. I used bagel with the bread like one reviewer advised. I used a butter and milk syrup recipe. The combo was soooo good!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was ,good, yummy, but with a few additions next time it will be even better. ...add some thinly sliced apples, maybe some sliced pecans have to play a bit and see what makes it yummier and maybe a tiny bit healthier. But it was great in a pinch!

Just notes for my own memory, add additional 1/2 cup of 1/2 & 1/2 for extra moisture and richness. Don't need to be anal about the bread. Just fill a greased 8x8 baking dish with bread cubes. Good to put together the night before except for the cinnamon sugar topping. Cover and refrigerate. In the morning sprinkle with the cinnamon sugar before baking. Use a full measure of Penzey's double strength vanilla.

I liked this.  Took it to work with lots of compliments. I've made twice now first as is but second time I doubled cinnamon and vanilla and added brown sugar to the mix. Also, use crusty bread and let it sit overnight and then pop in oven next day.  Thanks for sharing.

This was delicious! I needed to get more servings out of it and wanted to make sure it was filling so I used cubed whole wheat bagels. Using a 13 x 9 dish, my version:  4 whole wheat bagels (95 g each), 5 eggs, 2 cups skim milk, 2 Tbsp sugar, 1 1/2 Tbsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp salt, 1 Tbsp vanilla. Topping: 3 Tbsp sugar mixed with 1 1/2 Tbsp cinnamon. Was perfectly done cooking in 45 minutes. Served with a drizzle of pure maple syrup, fresh fruit, and turkey bacon. Very yummy!

I will definitely make this again. 

Since we are only the 2 of us, I cut the recipe in half and used a pie tin, rather than a baking dish. I cubed 4 slices of sandwich wheat bread and as with another suggestion, I slightly toasted the bread, although after I cubed the bread. A bit more difficult to cube, but I did like the idea of toasting the bread. I also substituted Splenda for the sugar.

I also dded the cubed bread to the egg mixture and then added the entire mix to the pie tin (baking dish). And before adding the cinnamon, I added slices of 1 large apple to the top of the mix and then finishing it with sprinkled cinnamon and brown sugar.  My wife said it was, "Excellente."

Followed the recipe exactly as printed and baked it in a counter-top convection oven. Came out perfect the first time: golden brown and crunchy on top, moist but not soggy underneath. It was sweet enough for me but the other half put a bit of honey on top. This will definitely become one of our standard Sunday brunch items from now on.

I really didn't make any changes. I had more bread so I added an extra egg and a little more milk.  I added a little tarragon, because I love the flavor of it. It was great. Will definitely  make it again.

Great if you're craving a sweet breakfast and want a break from pancakes or French toast.  This is a cross between French toast and bread pudding.

This is a great recipe. I've made it a few times and my family always comes back for seconds. One year for the holiday we were short on bread for our breakfast. I found a bag of mini cinnamon raisin bagels that were almost stale. I cut those up and used them in the recipie in leau of white bread. It turned out fantastic. I now, always use mini cinnamon raisin bagels. Try It!!
I also serve this with caramelized bananas and honey.

This recipe is gross. This was very disappointing, and I don't know why it's so highly rated on here. Just stick to making french toast the traditional way. No one in my family liked this, and I followed the recipe exactly. It's really mushy in the center, and seemed undercooked. The edges were starting to burn when I took it out. My boyfriend couldn't stop talking about how gross it was. Definitely a failure that I won't make again.

I followed exactly and the whole thing is wet and soggy. I gave it longer baking time which did not help. I wish users of this site would rate the actual recipe as given so others like me don't waste our time and ingredients.

I wish I had read all the reviews (not just the good ones) before making this.  It did not cook properly because (as others said) the egg mixture at the bottom/middle was still mushy after the 50 minutes.  My husband and I are starving and keep having to stick this back in the oven.  Also, if you look at the ingredients and their required measurements, the Author changed some of that in the actual directions.  Maybe this should be revised by one of the other people who made it work.  I am just going to look for another recipe or invent my own.  Thanks for posting this recipe.  In theory, it is spot on - but your measurements in relation to cook time and temp are way off.

Fast and easy.  I followed the recipe exactly except I substituted the bread with Hawaiian sweet bread and just used cinnamon sugar instead of combining the cinnamon and sugar (same thing).  This is my go to recipe for Christmas brunch!

I used Hawaiian rolls to make the bread cubes. Amazing!!!  Everyone asks me for the recipe.  (I also used butter instead of margarine.)

I mixed the cubed bread with egg mixture and kept the pieces on the larger side.  I added cinnamon to the egg mixture.  I put the bread/egg mixture in a greased 9x13 pan as others had suggested.   It came out fantastic.  My kids gobbled it up and asked me to make it again this week.  I made it for dinner!

This was a hit!!  I used toasted high fiber bread and a sugar-Splenda mix to sweeten.  I also used a little less milk (skim) than the recipe calls for...

This casserole was very good.  Instead of dotting with butter before baking, I poured half of a stick of melted butter (I know I should be ashamed of myself) into the milk and egg mixture.  I also added nutmeg with the cinnamon. Takes just like french toast.

Great brunch item when you want to serve french toast and don't want to be cooking while guests are there. But serving size is whack! I made 1.5X the recipe, and three of us ate most of it. And I even served some fruit & turkey sausage on the side.

This french toast casserole was tasty.  I made prepared the first part Christmas Eve night.  And as other suggested, I let it sit in the refrigerator overnight.  Chistmas morning I sprinkled the cinnamon sugar topping on top before putting it in the oven.  I did add a teaspoon of cinnamon to the egg batter.  Turned out perfect!

This stuff is great! I made 2 batches, 1 exactly as explained and the other I substituted sugar with Cinnamon and Sugar. My family preferred the one with the Cin/Sugar to the original but both batches were eaten up in record time!

This was great ! I was a little hesitant because my husband doesn't like to try new things and he will only have white bread for french toast which I didn't have on hand however I did have left over white rolls from Thanksgiving and it was great,I'm thinkin left over hot dog buns or hamburger buns would be good also,have a few ideas for next time like some nuts sprinkled on top

Love this recipe...delicious...used slices instead of cube bread. And used fat free milk as well as sugar substitute...turned out great. Next time I will turn slices over after soaking with egg mixture, sprinkle with cinnamon mixture then bake. Turned out great at 400 for 22 min. Oh yea, added pumpkin spices too.

This was really good, soggy on the outside yes, but really good and crispy on the top.  I did add nutmeg and I only had brown sugar.  I only had a cup of milk and so I so I lessened the eggs to 3 and bread cubes to 4 cups of fresh sliced white bread.  I think next time I will use more bread and all the eggs and just the one cup of milk.  We served this hot out of the oven with warm syrup on top.

Delicious.  Very simple recipe that can be tweaked to taste.  I used 3 day old cinnamon raisin bread from Panera bread, threw in a few craisins, added a little orange zest, medium eggs, and used 1% milk.  Not soggy, perfectly cooked at 40 minutes.  Thank you for the recipe, I'll use it again.

All together, this was actually pretty good. The only reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 star ratings is because I chose to use CinnaBon's cinnamon bread instead of regular bread crumbs. So I'm unsure of how the original recipe would've turned out. I also chose to make a vanilla glaze instead of using maple syrup. Note: the amount of milk you will need will vary with different types of breads, as some breads do not absorb as much as others. I thought the amount of milk the recipe called for was a little overboard for the bread I chose. I also added a little more butter... it's a Southern thing. =)

Wonderful recipe!  I have made this twice now, both times as the recipe is written except that I have substituted 1/4 cup of the milk with flavored coffee creamer.  It has come out beautifully each time and is always a hit, and people want the recipe.  I am making it today with French vanilla creamer and King’s Hawaiian bread and I cannot wait to see how it comes out.  Thank you for this easy peasy, yummy recipe!

I think that we found our new Christmas breakfast tradition.  I made it just as written, but may try using 1/2 regular milk/ 1/2 evaporated milk next time.  This was very creamy and enjoyed by everyone.  (Even the uber-picky 2 year-old)

I have a few French Toast recipes, mostly soak overnight. I used 6 eggs, and thick cinnamon raisin bread.  Very good ! It was crispy and light, not soggy, more eggy if you get my drift. Served with maple syrup.  Will definately make again when soaking is not an option.

Excellent recipe! I did not change a thing. It's a fast prep breakfast that incorporates some healthy foods to make something that, to me, tasted even better than french toast!  Going to try adding blueberries this time!  Thank you for the recipe!!!

This is fantastic!!!! I made a two pound loaf of cranberry cinnamon bread in the bread machine, and was able to make two batches of this.  I baked both of them, one to eat right away and one to freeze for later.  It was just as good the second time around.  My 8x8 pans were already in the freezer, so ended up making it in round casserole dish.  The texture turned out to be something like bread pudding.  My whole family loved it!

It was quick and easy to make and much easier then letting it sit in the fridge over night plus it looked and tasted awesome when I took it out of the oven.

Sometimes I'll change this up and get a tube of Pillsbury Cinnabon cinnamon rolls (not the biscuit-like tube, the actual cinnamon roll one!)...I'll bake the cinnamon rolls the day before and refridgerate.  Then take it out the next day, chop it up...then before I put the cinnamon & sugar on it, I'll bake it...THEN put the cream cheese frosting and sprinkle the cinnamon/sugar on top.  My boyfriend and I LOVE it!

I love making this! The first time I made it, I thought it would be too dry, but the crispy tops are so delicious! And the middle is perfectly soft. I've tried a couple of other similar recipes, but always end up back with this one.

I used this recipe.  It was for a bunch of construction workers who had a very long overnight project.  Since I didn't have an oven at the job site, I did have electricity.  So believe it or not.....  I used my roaster.  I had to triple the recipe of coarse.  It worked out perfectly.  This would work great for camping too if we take our motor home.

Was well-received by family.  Even with pre-toasting the bread, it tended to be pretty soft in the middle. Some family members weren't too sure about that.

This is a great recipe, my husband and I both loved it.  As others reviewed it, it did NOT turn out soggy at all.  I added raisins to one end for him as I do not like them.  I've made it several times and it always turns out great.  Thanks for a great recipe, we love it.

The taste was very good, however, it really is more like a bread pudding.  The only change I made was to use Peppridge Farms Cinnamon swirl bread.

There is no reason to "tweak" this recipe...it is fantastic as-is!  I cannot believe any negative review....I have 3 picky eaters, who ask for this every Saturday/Sunday morning!  We also make it for weekend guests and get rave reviews every time.

It wasn't terrible, but it also wasn't worth all the work either.  Especially since it tasted no different from normal french toast.

Both my picky eaters asked for seconds of this casserole! I used homemade whole wheat bread crumbs, added 1 T sugar to egg mixture, & let the bread soak in the eggy stuff for nearly an hour before cooking. Delish!

This recipe was great for using up slightly stale bread that somehow always accumulates. We only had three eggs instead of four; I think the fourth egg could have done a lot of good. Overall good recipe, I'll have to try it again.

Didn't work for me at all. I was really disappointed because I had been looking forward to making a french toast casserole for awhile. Not sure what I did wrong but it was extremely gooey/runny in the middle even after 2 hours of cooking. And the edges that were a good consistency didnt have much flavor. Oh well, at least it works for everyone else :)

We loved it! A perfect Sunday morning breakfast. The only change I did was use cooking spray on the pan and no stick whatsoever. I also used real butter, no margarine for us. Perfect with Maple syrup.

This is bread pudding, old recipe from my mother-in-law.  Great with walnuts mixed in, good for breakfast (with milk over it), or as a desert warm or cold.

simple, easy, yummy.  i, of course, had to add more cinnamon and sugar to the top than the recipe called for.

Delicious and easy. I added extra cinnamon to the butter (I never use margarin) and less sugar. Also happened to have cinnamon bagels so cut 2 of those for the bread and used bread that was already sitting out. Family thought it was delicious.

Awesome ! reminds me of the "bread pudding" my Gran used to make  I  I agree with Patti, "just as it is." If I changed it, it would be a different recipe !  Guess what we are having for Breakfast !  Great way to use up those leftovers too!

This was great tasting. My only problem was the time between prep and end. I feel I could have made a batch of traditional french toast faster. But I would make it this way for a large breakfast gathering.

this was very good.  A little mushy but i'm wondering if i basked it 5 extra minutes if that would have fixed that.  The last 10 minutes of baking I added fresh blueberries. Yummy!

Did not like this very much. It had too much of an egg taste to it. It smelled wonderful as it was baking in the oven and it looked great. I was really looking forward to this one, unfortunately I was highly disappointed once I cut into it., The middle was mush and the texture was of an unappealing consistency. The top layer was wonderful. If I could make it, avoiding the eggy taste/mush consistency... it would probably be good. Maybe I'll try it again someday..

This is pretty good, not quite what I was expecting. It is almost more of a dessert than a meal. Tastes just like bread pudding.

I made this today and I did not enjoy it. I think it should be called french toast bread pudding. I cooked it 8-10 minutes longer and it was still pretty wet. I was expecting something else i guess. The top was pretty good tho.

This was good. My husband gushed about it every bite! I was worried about it being soggy as other reviewers said, so I used only half as much egg and milk, and only made the bread one-layer deep. The bread I used was homemade Oat Whole Wheat Bread from AllRecipes. I sliced it into thick chunks. It stood up great and was not soggy at all, just moist. Baked in an 8x8 at 400 for 30 min.

My kids and I really wanted to love this recipe.  They didn't care for the egg filling which had a custard-y texture to it.  We decided it was fine but probably not worth the time that went in to making it.

Pretty good.  With the reviews it got, I wsn't expecting it to be so good.  Used a 9x13 pan (which it stuck to).  Used the 1/4 c. sugar with the milk & topped with 2tbsp. white sugar, 2tbsp. brown sugar, 1tsp. cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg.  Baked @375 degrees instead.  The top was crunchy and underneath was soft, it was great!

This was great!  I made it for the teachers at the school I worked at and they loved it.  I think it could use more flavor though.  It was a little plain for my taste.

Some liked, some didn't.  My grandson who normally loves french toast didn't like it.  We think probably the texture.  I liked it, but I like most anything.

It cooked just fine, but it was really lacking in any flavor or richness.  For a small family, I can see where this would be a convenient option over standing over the stove, so I'm giving it two stars for convenience.  However, for brunches or pot luck breakfasts, I wouldn't recommend it - the syrup is added at the time of serving as opposed to being baked in like many other recipes out there.  Wish I could have rated higher, but, out of everything we had at our Mother's Day Brunch this morning, this was the dish that was left sitting there while everyone went back for seconds of everything else.

Was a big hit but a wouldnt suggest trying to double this recipe and put it in a 9x13 pan because it ended up being burnt out the outside and not cooked all the way on the inside. Other than that it was very good was nicely paired with a fruit topping as well.

Flavor is excellent, but mine came out mushy despite following some of the others advice to add more bread.  I will try it again and I will add less liquid as well as try it with whole pieces of bread.  If I can cut down the mushy it will definitely be a 5 star.

Making the recipe exactly as written, this was a lot easier than dipping and frying individual slices of french toast.  While I did find the casserole to be a bit eggy (personal preference), I quite enjoyed the crunchy- chewy texture of the top layer.  Thanks!

I made this over the weekend for an Easter brunch, the flavor was really good! I used a Maple Drop bread along with a Raisin Cinnamon bread. But even though I greased up the pan it stuck real bad, I had to soak it for forever. Other than that everyone loved it and said it tasted just like French Toast.

This was an easy recipe, and very tasty. Just make sure the bread soaks up  the egg mixture really well. Mine got just a bit dry on the top. Next time I will let it sit for a few minutes before baking it.

I enjoyed this recipe, it was fast, easy, and great for breakfast. I made the egg mixture and combined it with the bread first, and I think next time I will mix some cinnamon into that, as well. I loved the cinnamon sugar topping-- really great!

It was good, but it came out a little dry even with the added eggs from the suggestions from other reviews, may need to just cook a little less.

Delicious. Made it for a group of 25 and got great comments.  I used Italian bread tore into pieces, let it set 4 hours.  I doubled it and used a 13x9 pan. It raised up high while baking, but then settled back down.

When I took it out of the oven, it was still eggy inside.... I had to put it in a pan and cook the remaining pieces.  Which, by the way, made it very, very dry.

It came out good, I made it christmas morning so I think I may have liked it better if I took some time. It was a little hard around edges but I dont think I had enough liquid, didnt quite measure everything! Everyone loved it though!

delicious & so much easier than frying all the french toast. I mixed egg mixture, poured bread into bowl, mixed & then poured in pan. Baked right away. needs a bit more sugar in the batter. I'd prob. double the sugar.

Excellent! I reduced the milk to 1 cup and used a square pan so it wasn't soggy.

Love, Love, Love this recipe!  I made it for Christmas and now it is weekly breakfast item.  I have even made up the liquid items the night before and poured it on top of the bread the next morning to speed up the morning and turns out wonderful every time!

Well I made this today and I don't know it puffed up real high and smelled wonderful but when I took it out of the oven it flopped into a flat mess and stuck to the bottom of the pan I think I"ll go back to my normal way of making french toast maybe I did something wrong I don't know.

this is easy to make and tastes rich and delicious.  Have made it with some heavy cream and it just gets richer.  Have used dry bread and fresh - doesn't matter.

This was a good easy idea for breakfast for 15.  I was able to prepare it the night before and cook in the morning.  Cleaning the pan was awful, my husband almost threw away our pan.  Made it a second time and put a silicon baking sheet in the bottom of the pan, this worked out better.

5 Stars for simplicity, taste, texture... Its great. AND I didn't have to do it the night before.  I added cinnamon to the egg mixture to incorporate with the bread.   If you are having trouble with soggy, or eggy bread... try using french bread, cute into large cubes, combine the bread with the egg mixture instead of just pouring the egg mixture over the bread.  Someone else suggested challah bread, that would be great too.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I substituted Challah bread--the best kind to make french toast with and it was superb. A little dry so we added syrup!

I made this for my family Christmas morning.  What a hit!!  I did double the recipe (as we had a big crowd) and used a whole lot of different breads.  Tasted super yummy and the house smelled great :)  I might cover it with foil for the last little bit of cooking next time.  A little too crunchy for my liking.  All in all, a fabulous recipe!! Thanks :)

EXCELLENT. I made for our Christmas breakfast this year (we always have friends join us) and everyone raved about it. It was so nice because I literally spent 10 minutes to prepare the dish (breaking the bread - should have done it the night before) and then I could visit with everyone. THIS IS A DEFINITE MAKE AGAIN.....loved it. Thanks for the recipe Starflower

I know that some people reviewed this recipe and complained about it being soggy but I decided to give it a shot anyway.  Well, mine turned out soggy as well.  I was not happy with this at all and it has turned me off from french toast casseroles all together.

Very good, but not great, I used raisin bread for mine and it didn't turn out soggy at all, great with some berries. Maybe a different bread would have worked better, like king's Hawaiian.

yummy!  everyone loved this.  I didn't add as much cinnomin on top as suggested.  My kids tend to not love cinnomin very much.  But I did add a sprinkle of it into the egg mixture.

I made this pretty much as is, Christmas morning.  It was okay.  Took longer than I would have liked for a Christmas morning dish.  After reading some of the other reviews, I think preparing it the night before would help as it would give the egg mixture a better chance to soak into the bread.  Mine stuck to the pan alittle so I would be more generous with the buttering of the pan.  I think this would also be good with some blueberries or other fresh/frozen fruit.  Mine was alittle goopy in the middle so a longer baking time might be needed depending on your oven.

This is one of my favorite things to make. It's easy. You already have all of the ingredients to make it and most importantly, my family loves it! You can use all different types of bread for this recipe too. I made it with hot dogs buns last night because I was running short on regular bread and it turned out even better than normal!

not sure what all the raving is about - my 5 year old and i thought it was ok; but something was amiss that we couldn't quite place. My husband skipped it after a bite. Egg seemed a bit uncooked as well.  Definitely needed the bananas and blueberries I added.

WARNING if you are serving this to kids it is very hot and stays hot.   Not bad not great. My wife thought it was better than I did. I will make it again but will probably try one of the variations.

I also added honey on top and some nutmeg. I personally think 50 minutes is too much time and made it too dry for my preference. 30-35 minutes should be ok when it rises and is moist in the middle.

This was tasty as is, but we preferrred it with syrup and banana slices.  It was mushy, but still yummy.  I think I'll add some brown sugar next time.  I like that it tasted just like reguar French toast, but without the tediousness of flipping bread and standing by the stove.  =D

Delicious, easy recipe.  Beats standing at the stove and flipping 8 or more slices, and tastes better too.  I used french bread and let it dry out in oven while mixing other ingredients as it was very fresh and I've always heard dry bread makes better french toast.  Worked great.  I saved this recipe in my "My Allrecipes" folder as I will definitely use it again.

We had this for dinner one night.  Maybe I did something wrong but it was really soggy.  Not like the french toast I'm used to.  It honestly didn't taste that great either.  We won't have this again.

Very yummy! Was a little soggy but I didn't follow my gut and not use all the liquid, or put some more bread in it. Making again for breakfast for sure! My daughter loved it! I liked it better the next day, less soggy. I did end up using brown sugar for the topping and probably will use it for the milk mixture next time. The best part was it was sooooo simple!!!!

So, so easy.  Yet so, so good! I used all my leftover hamburger and hot dog buns - whole wheat.  I also didn't include the sugar on the top for a slightly "lower" calorie take on this.  I also used low sugar syrup.  Didn't feel as guilty and tasted GREAT.  Made for house guests who enjoyed, as well as my 1 and 4 year old boys. Yum.

This was pretty good it was a little too moist in the middle when I took out of oven so I had to cook a little longer.  Definitely need syrup with this.

Fantastic!!!  Instead of regular bread we used French Toast Bagels (from Market Basket) and added 1/2lb of bacon.  Wonderful!!!  My family gobbled it up for dinner.  We'll definitely use this again!

This is an excellent dish! The taste is wonderful and it's easy, really easy to make. Definately double the ingredients and put into a 9X13 pan as others have suggested. Let your guests put the syrup on...as it really doesn't need any syrup at all given the flavor is so good! Pair with sausages and fruit and you have a great brunch!

Really good. I cooked it for 45 min but I coulda cooked it longer as the middle was alittle soggy yet. The top and bottom were nice and crunchy. I added a teas of cinnamon to the egg mixture as well. I used 6 slices of regular white bread. I'll make this again.

I followed the recipe exactly. It turned out how it should have, but I just felt the dish was really heavy and not the texture I care for when eating french toast. I will not make this again.

This was terrific!!  The only change that I made was to increase it.  (I had 6 hungry kids, as well as dh and I).  My picky 3 year old that only eats PB&J or cereal devoured it, that never happens here.  This will definitely go into my recipe box!

This was great! I had old bread from a loaf, had some hamburger buns to use up, so put them on a cookie sheet and dried them out in the oven. Used the cream cheese and brown sugar, I'll diffently make this again. Thanks.

I made this for Mother's Day brunch, and served it with maple syrup on the side. It was soooooo good. Very easy to make (I used cubed french bread). I've been enjoying the leftovers for dessert with whipped cream. Great recipe!

This was wonderful!  I used heavy cream and a little bit more sugar since we were being extra indulgent.  I also put cinnamon in the egg mixture as well as on top....Delightful!

Not so great!  Very bland and boring, not to mention the look of it all.  My husband loves French toast but wouldn't even give it a try.  The kids tried it, but couldn't eat their whole portion because it was tasteless.

I made this with store-bought "vanilla raisin bread" for a potluck and served it with maple syrup.  Every last bit of it was devoured.  The only modification I made was to add some nutmeg with the cinnamon, but I didn't measure.

I made this today just to try it out because i am a huge french toast fan. i thought it was pretty good. the only thing i wish was that the egg in the inside was a little more cooked. I baked it at 350 for 60 min. and it was still a little mushy in the inside. maybe next time i will use a bigger baking dish or just simply add more bread....im not sure but i will def try and make this again. thanks for the recipe :)

I doubled the recipe for a 9x13 pan and had to cook it for 60 minutes. It was still pretty mushy when I served it. We loved the taste, but the texture was off for us. We don't like our regular French toast mushy though, so that is just our preference. Next time, I will reduce the wet ingredients a bit and see if that helps the texture.

This was good overall.  I made it as-is.  I think it would be good to add half the bread and then a sprinkle of cinnamon and then the remainder of the bread, or use raisin bread.  The top was a little sweet with the sugar.  Did not care for it left-over at all so that was a negative to it.  I think it would be good with some added flavors- fruit, cream cheese, the raisin bread- but it's a good simple base recipe.

This was SO delish! I doubled the recipe and used a whole loaf of challah bread.  I cubed my bread and let it sit out for about 2 hours to dry it out first, which helped prevent the mushy-ness. Then I baked it for 60 mins like someone else had suggested and it was not mushy at all. Perfectly dry and delicious! I will def be making this again!!

This is a tasty recipe. Because my family likes drier French toast, I added an extra cup of bread and cut the milk back somewhat. I actually liked the casserole better after it sat and cooled for a while.

I followed the directions but it was certainly not as I imagined!  The egg never fully cooked and the top was burned (in an attempt to cook the eggs.. lol).  I dont know if it's because my oven sucks or maybe I missed something somewhere..

I cut this recipe in half, used sara lee wheat sandwhich bread and omitted the salt. I then mixed cinnamon and nutmug withe the egg mixture (I love lots of cinnamon on my french toast). I then cooked it in my 2QT slow cooker for 4 hours. I made sure to spray the crock real good with cisco buttery spray. After 4 hours the edges were golden brown as well as the top. I cut into it, the middle was moist, but not at all runny. I smothered it in maple syrup and though it was pretty good. Mind you it is no substitute for REAL french toast, but, it was delish.  Like other reviewers said, it would be great with ice cream and caramel for desert.

I had to use up some bread so I tried this recipe. It was very good, but it seems as though the egg mixture may have been a little blah. I added cinnamon and nutmeg to the mixture. Very good though. I topped with maple syrup and confectionary sugar.

I made this for "breakfast day" at work.  It was a big hit.  I was very pleased with the way it turned out.  When topped with maple syrup it was just like eating French toast.  I plan on making it again.

This was really yummy!!  The only thing we changed was slicing french bread about one inch thick, and placing the slices in a 9x13 pan.  Everything else remained the same.  Loved it, and it was sweet enough that we didn't use syrup.  A keeper!!

This was good. I think that next time I will add some cinnamon to the custard mixture and bread. Mine was a bit soggy and it did deflate after I took it out of the oven, but other than that it was wonderful. Next time, however, I will use Challah bread instead of sandwich bread(I was looking for something different to have for brinner and I used what I hand handy). I will add this to my rotation!!

I added a peeled chopped apple to the bread and some chopped pecans to the cinnamon sugar topping.  They were both good additions.  The casserole makes a tasty breakfast dish.

This was my 1st baked french toast attempt. My family enjoyed it with maple syrup drizzed on top, but I myself wasn't sure about the squishy texture in the center of the casserole. It kinda reminded me of bread pudding. It was a great way to use up some dry bread though so I might use it again for my family. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This recipe, as is, is just OK. It needs some work. I'm willing to try this again, with adjustments.

I made this for our Christmas morning breakfast and it was so delicious.  No need for syrup either.  I plan on making this every Sunday morning.

If you want a topping for this one, try this:  1/2 lb butter, 1 cup pecans, 1 cup brown sugar, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  Mix together and spread on top.  Serve with some real maple syrup and berries.  The base recipe is great - I even used skim milk and it worked fabulously.  (I gave 4 stars only because I felt it needed a topping).  To die for!!!

Very good... made it this morning when everyone came over for Christmas. Everyone liked it... even my mother-in-law asked for the recipe... shocking! I used a loaf of Pepperidge Farm Cinnamon/Brown Sugar bread.

We just made this for brunch after I realized our brisket went way bad. It was very good! I was even able to halve the recipe with out it coming out poorly. Highly recommended!

My whole family loved this recipe. There were no leftovers. It was so easy to make and it turned out yummy. The only change I will make next time is to add more butter to the bottom of the pan so as to avoid sticking.

tasted really good. I wouldn't advise adding to much syrup after it is done though. It makes it really sweet.

This was very easy to make and very yummy too!  I did have to call it a French Toast Bake and not casserole to get my kids to eat it!!  :)  For some reason they are scared of the word casserole!  But give this one a try, you'll like it!!

I found this very tasty.  I used half a loaf of French bread.  I accidentally doubled the amount of eggs!  Oops!  Got confused with another French Toast Casserole recipe.  Even with the extra eggs, it still came out good.  Although my 31 month old didn't seem to like it as much.  Hopefully he'll like the leftovers better.

ETA~
Wow!  I did not even realize I had used this recipe before.  I just made it...again I guess.  I made it last night for this morning.  I did add a fifth egg-wanted to add a bit more protein-so I took about an ounce off the milk.  Came out perfect!  My son has eaten two servings.  Very easy and very good.  Oh and I used frozen rolls that I had in the freezer, cooked them as directly, let them completely cool for a few hours and then made this.

Used this recipe for regular french toast.  Used wheat bread and skim milk instead.  Also used less sugar and cinnamon.  My picky toddler request more.  Definately a keeper.

This is a all time favorite in our family.  I do it for kids sleep over parties or company.  No mess in the morning.  Make ahead and just bake when you wake.  It's also nice on Christmas morning.  As presents are being opened a wonderful smell comes from the kitchen.

I guess I can't give this particular recipe 3 stars since we tweaked it so much but this was our guideline. I took some other users advice and added cream cheese and brown sugar. We didn't have any vanilla so that was omitted. I used whole wheat bread with nuts because it was all I had, not sure I'd do that again. Didn't like the nuts in it. Mine didn't puff up at all. Maybe not enough bread. A little soggy. I think we put too much cinnamon on it, it was a little bland. With syrup it was better. Will try again with better bread and right ingredients! Thanks!

Very good recipe, mine did not dry out at all.  Used brown sugar (instead of white) mixed with apple pie spice as topping (as this is what I use in regular french toast too) and added just a Tablesppon or two of Amaretto to the egg mix for a unique flavor.  I agree this is much better than standing there flipping french toast slices!

This recipe is my husbands favorite.  This recipe is so simple and delicious.  Try using croisants in place of the bread for a buttery and even better tasting breakfast.  I love bread pudding and this is nearly the same thing with a twist.

LOVE this recipe.  But the baking time was considerably too long for mine...I set my timer for like 10 minutes short of the time said, and it was getting too dark.

I made this recently for a brunch party.  It was very easy to make.  I prepped everything (cut up the bread, made the egg mixture)the night before.  I put everything together the morning of (which took less than 5 minutes).  I threw this in the oven and was able to enjoy the party.  It smelled great and tasted even better!  Got tons of compliments and was asked for the recipe by many.

This did not turn out good at all, it was not soggy, but it just was not good to me, the family said it was alright, so I know what that means, ( there just trying to be nice to me ) it was dry on top and sponge like on the bottom/middle and bland in the spongey area, I did use whole wheat bread in place of white, well thanks anyway.

Great recipe!  My husband and I finished this dish off very quickly!  My only changes were that I toasted the bread cubes first and added freshly grated nutmeg.  I drizzled a caramel topping over it at time of serving.  Yummy!!

This was something new.  My little brother really liked it and ate it for every meal until it was gone. I think it almost made it until dinner time (he is a teenager and eats several meals a day).  Personally, I prefer french toast a little more firm than this recipe made it but I will have to make it again to appease my brother.

Wonderful! I did take a few suggestions and made a few changes on my own. Instead of french bread I used cinnimon swirl bread (YUM!) I did reduce the liquid but I used cream instead to make it really rich. This will be a wonderful breakfast for Christmas morning. Just prep amd put in frige over night and pop in the oven in the morning.

This was REALLY delicious and very easy to make except next time I will definaltely listen to previous reviews and use less milk. It was very soggy but still had a decadent french toast flavor. I also used cinnamon in the milk/egg mixture for more flavor and when I took it out of the oven sprinkled it with powdered sugar. My husband loved it with maple syrup but I thought it was great just plain.

I really enjoyed this recipe. It does taste just like french toast, but much simpler. My husbands thoughts though were "if you're going to make french toast, make french toast".....

The kids loved it. We will definatley try this recipe again. To add to the presentation we sprinkled it with icing sugar.
