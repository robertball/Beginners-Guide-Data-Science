I made Ceviche for the first time with this recipe while using bass and tuna.  My guests loved it.  One suggestion - lightly freeze the fish before cutting and thus being able to cut it very thin.

Unbelievable flavors in this dish. I used this for one of my culinary school classes and everyone was blown away. I didn't have the preserved lemon so I used lemon zest and crushed anise seed instead and it came out good. I'll try this with the preserved lemon if I can find it or if I have the time to make it at home.

This recipe is AWESOME, everyone and I mean EVERYONE loved it!  The first time I did exactly as the recipe called and the second time I took a short cut out of necessity.  If you absolutely don't have time or can't get all the ingredients, Gourmet Garden has a fabulous Moroccan spice blend.  I started with that and added the other ingredients.  Also, make sure you use good quality fresh seabass, a recipe is only going to be as good as the product!  ps.  I'm not a coconut fan, so I did leave that out.  The citrus flavors in this are to die for.  Make sure you use fresh lemon, lime and orange juice, worth the effort!  Thank you for a great recipe!

Great, citric flavors. Made with 1 lb seabass, 1/2 lb scallops, 1/2 lb shrimp.

Used siracha instead of harissa. Could not taste any spicey @2tsps. Will use more or add to flavor after.
