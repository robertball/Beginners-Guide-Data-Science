This is another recipe that has been in my RB for quite some time. Having an abundance of rhubarb I was searching for something new and different to make. BINGO!! Rather than make these into squares, I opted to do it in a tart pan and cut it into slices. Taking the advice of another reviewer, I used the two egg yolks in place of the 1 egg in the crust and also added the few remaining strawberries I had in the fridge to the cooked rhubarb. Absolutely delicious and beautiful dessert. Thanks for sharing and I will most definitely make this again.

Over all this was not a bad recipe.  The rhubarb set well and the meringue actually went well with the coconut.  I didn't like the crust it was too soft even with an extra 5 minutes of baking.  I will try this again but next time I will make a crisper, more shortbread like crust.

I made these squares for an open house at my church and everyone loved them!  They looked lovely too.  A great way to use up some of my abundant rhubarb.

This was a very nice recipe, a bit time consuming, but not difficult to make.  It was basically rhubarb meringue pie but baked as squares.

I love rhubarb but do not care for this... The coconut does not go with it.... The crust is tasteless.

I was really impressed with this recipe! I followed the instructions (just omitted the coconut) and they turned out perfect! They are very easy to make. I will definitely make these again.

Inspired by reviewer Avon's photos, I also baked this in a 10 inch tart pan, and it looked beautiful.  I added a couple of sprinkles of cinnamon in the crust and added 1/2 tsp of vanilla to the filling after it had cooled slightly before putting it in the crust.  I used frozen rhubarb which after thawing had rhubarb liquid that I used in place of the water in the filling.  I also omitted the coconut from the top.  I thought this was a nice change from the usual rhubarb cobbler & I'll make it again.

Tasty. Instead of using one whole egg in the crust, I used the yolks from the meringue whites. I made it in a spring form pan.

This recipe is very similar to a rhubarb square recipe my nan makes, so I was really excited to try it. It turned out great! It is time consuming, but if you like rhubarb it's a nice way to use it up.

Nice combination of flavours, the crust puffed up more than I anticipated, my husband gobbled this one up, a keeper for sure!
