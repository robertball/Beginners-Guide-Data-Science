Loved this!..........and my husband raved about it. I made it with turkey bacon in place of regular bacon. Made it for the two of us and certainly will be making again for a festive crowd!

This ridiculously simple and delicious dish brings together a trifecta of bacon avocado and pasta that is good hot or cold.

Easy and delicious! I used shredded Parmesan instead of Romano cheese... The avocado adds a delightful creamy texture and the taste pairs perfectly with the fresh basil and lemon juice. A very refreshing summer salad!

This was a bright and fresh change. I made it hot but since the one review said it was good cold as a salad I ate the leftovers the next afternoon and really like it better as a salad.

I was given this recipe from a friend. It is absolutely amazing. Perfect for a warm weather dinner or even brought out as a pasta salad. My husband said there s not a single thing he would change.

I loved it.  My picky 6 &  7 year old girls thought the garlic was too spicy.

I m rating based on my changes because I had to make changes due to what I had on hand. I used Small shell pasta. I had pre-cooked real bacon bits instead of cooking bacon and I didn t have fresh basil so I used 2 large spoonfuls of prepared basil pesto but all other ingredients were exactly the same. It was a really good quick dish. Also used fresh grated Parmesan cheese.

This dish is amazing!! I added lemon zest and chipotle pepper but kept everything else the same. This is a new staple dish in our house.

Loved this recipe! Definitely can use half a box of pasta instead of a whole one.

I cant believe this doesn't have more reviews. I've made it multiple times now and love it every time. I usually use parmesan and sometimes skip the avocado, and it still comes out amazing.
