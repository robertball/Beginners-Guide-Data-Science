This is a great recipe. I added a little more parmesan cheese & cream and then melted mozzarella over the top just before taking it out of the oven. Friends who swear that they hate spinach loved this dip!!

I make this every year during the holidays. My family loves it, even the ones who don't like one or more of the ingredients! I serve mine with corn tortilla chips, like the ones you'd use with salsa. I've had many versions of this dip, but this one is the best!

Not enough seasoning and not as creamy as I would have liked either.  I'll keep looking.  Thanks :)

Loved this...I doubled the recipe and it turned out great...then came to the recipe and looked at the heavy cream...opps! I didn't double that. But you know what? It was still delish! Not sure if I want to double it the next go round. Didn't really taste the artichokes or persay, they weren't overwhelming at all...it my spinach fan in the house devoured it completely on her own. So I guess it meets approval. She grabbed the pan and a bag of chips and said thanks for dinner! ;-) The rest of us that liked it...well we didn't get but a few chips in. Totally will make again. Just the way I made it.

Found this dip to be a bit bland.  Be sure to drain the spinach well.  I'd add more garlic next time, too.

Try putting the spinach in a food processor which makes it easier to mix and not have any large pieces. Season to taste. Works for me.

Got rave reviews for this! I doubled the artichokes instead of the red pepper (I don't like peppers), and it worked like a charm!

I served this at a progressive dinner.  I did add a little more cream.  Everyone raved about it and wanted the recipe.  It is definitely one I'd use again.  Also, I ran late getting everything on the table so we stuck the dip in the microwave for 10 minutes instead of using the oven.  It worked just fine.  I spread some of the left overs on a tortilla and rolled it up.  It made a filling and tasty quick lunch.

I agree with other reviews that said this was a little bland, but it's a good place to start.  Used a little extra garlic, some cayenne pepper, lemon juice and that seemed to do the trick.  Not too much got eaten though, so the next day I mixed in a package of low-fat cream cheese and heated it up in the oven again for another party. It was a hit and was all gone by the end of the party. Definitely recommend the cream cheese.

Possibly the best spinach dip I have ever had. I did add more cream than was called for to get a better dip consistency. Have made this on several occasions with positive feedback from everyone who tried it.

To give it more spice add red pepper flakes.  Gives it zing.

I liked it but my husband did not.  Was much better when steaming hot than it was as it cooled down.  Needed something to make it less stiff and more creamy...

Good, but not fantastic. My dinner guests liked it, but it wasn't quite what I expected. Not bad, just not great. Might make it again, if I can't find a better recipe.

Super easy and tastes great!  I would suggest chopping up the spinach to make 'dipping' easier.

Yum. I LOVE artichoke hearts but my partner hates them so I used frozen corn instead. Also I opted for fresh spinach and threw in about 1/4 cup of plain nonfat yogurt to make it a tad creamier. And (since I can't not use spice in a dip) I added paprika and red pepper. This was a great base recipe to work with!

I changed it a bit, because I didn't have/want all the ingredients.  My kids loved it!  I didn't add peppers or artichokes (kids don't like) and instead of parmesan cheese (quite expensive and I've been using it in too many recipes lately) I used a mexican mix.  It was delicious...I added a little garlic powder and paprika, too.  Will def make this one again- I may add a little cayenne to spice it up.

I used canned artichokes instead of jarred ones, and chopped instead of mashing them. The flavor of the dip was okay, but the consistency wasn't great for spreading on a cracker.

Good recipe, definately more garlic.  In order to cope with the blandness that some people talk about try adding more pepper and some chili pepper.  Also more cheese like people have said is good as well.

This seemed very bland.  I tried adding hot sauce to give it a little more flavor but it really didn't help.  It's missing the mayo for flavor.  Will not try it again.

This is a great recipe.  I used fresh spinach and had to cook it first.  I did add a handfull of pre-cooked diced mushrooms.  Yum!

I like the creaminess of this over the version make with cream cheese.
Two things I did differently:  I added 1/4 cup sliced canned chestnuts, drained, for crunch.
I heated in small crockpot on warm.
Three additional guides: drain, but don't squeeze the thawed spinach.  The garlic adds alot of flavor, so use the quantity you like. I bought marinated artichokes and blended them after draining them.  The marinade also adds flavor.

This was not creamy at all.  Definately needs more cheese and cream or something.  I will try another as well.

I suggest adding one diced fresh jalapeno if you like a little heat.  It wasn't too spicy just a little more complex flavor, really good.

I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with spinach, not spinach dip.  Not creamy, no dip like qualities... Just spinach.  Maybe a good side dish, but no way is this a dip!
