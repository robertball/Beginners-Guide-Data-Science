I don't have the patience for rolling cookies, so I turn everything into a drop cookie.  Thank Rosina for this recipe!!!  It's my birthday and I really wanted some good old ginger snaps but don't know where my recipe box is.  I was so disappointed when all the other recipes on here had only 1/4cup of molasses!!  I was worried about this recipe not having any baking soda or such, but they turned out beautifully!  I did make a slight adjustment, I used only 2 tsp ginger and added 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp ground cloves because I like my cookies spicy.  To me, that's how good old fashioned gingersnaps are!!  I also used blackstrap molasses, which is the best of the best (aka strongest) and it has 20% of your calcium per tablespoon so these cookies are good and healthy too!  I did have to flatten them before cooking since I skipped the roll them out part.  I just make tablespoon size balls and flattened them.

These have now become the most requested cookie in my house. They are amazing! Not your typical ginger snaps as they are hard and crunchy but not these.....they are soft and chewy and have an amazing flavor. I usually make them once a week. I work with a guy that I have given them to twice and he told me that he has loved ginger snaps since he was a child and said that these...by far...are the very best that he has ever had  :) These are a definite must try for those ginger snap lovers out there. Thank you for another winning recipe!!!

I didn't like these cookies at all.  They weren't really ginger snaps, they were more like molasses cookies.  And they were very hard and heavy with molasses flavor.  Not your typical ginger snap.

I'd give these 3.5 stars if I could because one of my kids liked these and we had fun rolling them out.  Gingerbread isn't my thing to begin with, and these had a very strong molasses taste that seemed a little too much.  The texture of these was great, so maybe with some adjustments they'd be more to our liking.

My son is allergic to all dairy and eggs, so finding a cookie recipe that he could enjoy was great!  I didn't have quite enough molasses, so I added about 1/4 cup of dark corn syrup, which made the cookies softer.

Putting together this dough was easy.  But rolling it out was tricky- it would get warm and unmanagable fast (so I would chill dough in the freezer).

My biggest problem was figuring out when then were done and burnt half on my first try.  

A good taste, but wish they had more "zing".

I found this receipe to be very easy and tasteful.  I did add fresh ginger instead and it came out great.  My daughter always asks for them.

My family and I did not like these cookies.  They have too much molasses and a very heavy taste.

This recipe was too gingery (is that a real word?), and the snap was too snappy (I know thats a real word).

Much too strongly flavored. Had to throw them out, I'm not sure whatI did wrong or if its just the recipe.

They are not good at all. They need more sugar. They are flat and taste like molasses.

I used a little bit more ginger, and butter instead of shortening, and these turned out FANTASTIC! I usually only have store bought ginger snaps, so it was a pleasant surprise to have these cookies, which didn't taste so processed. Great, I will use this again.
