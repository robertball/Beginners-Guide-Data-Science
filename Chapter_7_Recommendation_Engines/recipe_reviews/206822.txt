It's an easy good recipe for something alittle more than a regular popcorn ball.  Here's a tip though, 8 cups of cooked popcorn is 1/2 cup uncooked kernels. I actually tripled the recipe, then you need to consider do I have a big enough pot.

these are sooo good and so easy to make.  i used marshmallow fluff, white chocolate chunks, and chopped up some caramels.  added the chocolate, caramel, and peanuts to the melted marshmallow and let them melt a bit, then added the popcorn.

totally amazing! I left the peanuts out and added a half a bag of chocolate chips. Delish! We're having a hard time leaving it alone until it cools.

My family loved this recipe!  I only had big marshmallows and used 30 big marshmallows with 2 bags of microwave popcorn.  I did not have peanuts so I used 1/2 cup peanut butter chips instead.  It was good, but I think the texture of the peanuts would have been MUCH better!  Great recipe!

Good.  Quick and easy for granddaughter.  Next time will add one cup of chocolate chips, and melt down with the marshmellows.

I dunno. I just wasn't that into these. I had hoped they would be better. Not a problem with the recipe, we just thought they were too sweet.

Just made these and they are fantastic. Super easy to throw together, also.  I chopped my peanuts up a little as suggested by another reviewer.

Made exactly as recipe is stated and was good, but the consistency of the popcorn came out a bit chewy.  I will read the review on how to make it more crisp next time before I make again.

1/2 cup of un-popped kernels gave me 12 cups of popped corn. I read that 8 regular marshmallows = 1 cup of minis, so I used 24 regular marshmallows and that worked fine. I used the Fishers nut topping for ice cream (chopped peanuts) and couldn't even tell it was in there so maybe coarsely chopped peanuts would be better. In addition to the peanuts and mini chocolate chips, I added 1/2 cup of sweetened flaked coconut and enjoyed that addition. They are delicious and not messy like I expected them to be with the melted chocolate. They do have the texture of soft or stale popcorn. I don't know how to crisp them up, but maybe after some time they will get crisper...I just made them. Very good!

I made these for my boys, but my husband and I couldn't leave them alone! I mixed the chocolate chips in with the melted marshmallow because I thought it would be difficult to stir chocolate chips in with the sticky popcorn. It is very messy and hard to stir. I also chopped my peanuts up, and I put wax paper on a cookie sheet to place the balls on and let them cool before wrapping them. I think I will try adding some peanut butter to the marshmallow/chocolate next time. My kids loved it!

It was delicious! It took about five minutes from start to finish. I'm allergic to peanuts, so I left them off, and I added a half a bag of milk chocolate chips instead of the 1/2 cup. Everyone loved it. Actually, I think it's too good. I ate three large balls in a row. :-/

I opted for pecan pieces instead of peanuts and added a little vanilla to the marshmallows as you would while making Rice Krispie Treats.  My children loved these.
