This frosting turned out delicious! I made it according to directions but wiped the bowl of mixer with lemon juice before whipping eggs. The mix started to separate but don’t lose hope just keep mixing. I have a small stand mixer and it took 15 minutes after all butter was added and pulled back together beautifully. This is a “healthier” option if you want to cut sugar. It is not sweet but we prefer it that way! Thank you Jana!
