Excellent flavor! I will definitely not be buying this in a bottle. I did make changes. Maybe it was the Chipotle peppers but I had to use 4/1 of the other ingredients and it was still spicy. I used fresh squeezed lime juice and a tad bottled lemon as well as fresh cilantro and lime zest. I don't have a stand blender but my immersion blender handled the job just fine. These are excellent on wings. :)

This sauce is awesome. I was skeptical about the amount of peppers; thought it would be too spicy, so I doubled the rest of the ingredients and used 4 chipotle peppers. It was perfect. Hubby said that this is his new favorite sauce for wings.

This was a great wing sauce. The only thing I changed was I added a couple of tablespoons of Sriracha sauce. Will make again!!

I've made this several times using the entire can of adobo. If you want to add a kick to nearly any meat, you have it. I almost always keep a jar on hand.

Super simple and delicious!!  I doubled it thinking I would need more but that was not necessary.  It made enough to marinade 6 T-Bone Steaks, use additional sauce during the grilling, and had extra for dipping.  I highly recommend this recipe!

made as written and it tasted a little limey to me.  I added extra honey and some liquid smoke and it was perfect for us

Great sauce. Just the right amount of heat. Great on smoked chicken wings. If you double the recipe, you can use the whole can of peppers

This sauce was delicious! I’m not a fan of spicy food but gave these a try for the family who LOVES hot food. I only used 3/4 peppers out of the can. They said that they weren’t that hot to them, but raves how good they were. I will be making these again. Next time, since they like really hot, I’ll add the whole  can! Thanks so much for sharing.

I pretty much follow the recipe but used corn starch to thicken sauce.

Excellent sauce for wings!  Next time I would use the 2T pepper sauce. I used 1 T and it wasn't spicy enough for us.
Great recipe!! Thank you for sharing it!!

This sauce is EXCELLENT! I've made it several times. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. I doubled the recipe and refrigerated the left overs. The sauce is good with Salmon too.

Great sauce for wings. I loved the slight sweet in the spicy.
