The marinade for the tomatoes is incredible.  I doubled it and added a little more balsamic vinegar.  I marinated 2 pints of cherry tomatoes cut in half with the red onion.  I put it all in a bowl and let it set at room temp while we grilled the sausage. It went perfect with the Italian sausage!  We didn't have french rolls, so we served it with Pasta Hot! Hot! Hot! from this site.  I can't wait to try this again but on rolls.  This one's a keeper especially over the summer months! Update: Made this again, but served it on rolls and OMG it's wonderful! Perfect for a quick and easy meal especially paired with a garden salad with balsamic vinaigrette dressing.

It was too cold out to grill, so I pan fried the sausages and topped them with the marinated tomato mixture.  Great way to serve Italian sausage!

This was very good and I would definitely make it again.  I made the tomatoes in the afternoon and just let them sit, covered, on the countertop.  Next time I make this I’m going to dice the tomatoes and onions, rather than slicing them, which will make this more of a relish for the sausages.  I also like the idea of using this for bruschetta, as suggested by another reviewer.

Everything was great.  I did marinate tomatoes and onions a little longer, but they were great.  Will use again, thanks

The marinated tomatoes and onions make this meal.  The grilled sausage is very good, but add the veggies and it is a fantastic sandwich.  The next time I make this I will let the tomatoes marinate even longer for a more intense flavor.  Thanks chefsazy - this recipe will be on the summer rotation.

I also used cherry tomatoes, and served on round flatbread (warmed up in the microwave so they wouldn't break when folded in half). So delicious! My bf and I couldn't stop talking about how good it was.

Loved this recipe.  It is a variation of something we already do and I didn't have the grill ready, so I compromised and cut up the sausage and sauteed it with minced garlic and a little bit of olive oil.  When the sausage was ready I threw it all together with some mafaldine noodles and served.  I did increase the marinade a bit, just to ensure the entire meal was coated.  The entire family loved it!  Excellent recipe!

The tomatoes and onions add a very good taste - good enough to stand alone - and look geat as a bed for the sausages.

This was a wonderfully quick and savory dish to prepare!  My son (who is picky about how his vegetables are prepared) loved it and gobbled two sandwiches before flying out the door to the basketball game.  I added some thinly sliced red bell pepper to the marinade as well, and since my sons are not fond of raw onions, I sauteed the red pepper and onion with some of the marinade then put it back in with the tomatoes that were still marinating. (I didn't have French rolls on hand so I used onion-cheese rolls.) Delicious!

This is a great one!  I used kielbasa and sliced each link in half so they would fit on the bread better.  I didn't have red wine vinegar, so I used white and it was still delicious!

I've always made and enjoyed Italian sausage sandwiches topped with sautéed green pepper slices and onions so I was intimidated to try this recipe. This recipe, however, was even better than "my old way"! I only needed half as many tomatoes, onions and marinade which by the way was so delicious!!!

I made a number of changes. Instead of a sandwich so to speak I made it into a fully cooked dinner. The sausages were grilled according to directions. Instead of marinating the vegetables I sautéed them and added a pinch of red pepper flakes. It was served together with a wild rice mixture. It was indeed very good. Not said so by the cook but by those that ate it.

I used lean Italian turkey sausages. Followed exact recipe for onions, tomatoes and marinade, but found it too hard to eat on a bun with a big sausage. Think I'd saute the onions and chop tomato finely.

This was so wonderful! I had bratwurst as it's summertime.I would have had mild Italian sausage. The marinated tomatoes were fantastic! We didn't use buns, I just laid a lettuce leaf on the plate, piled high with the marinated tomatoes, and enjoyed the brat alongside. This combo was the bomb!

Picky husband said this one goes in the top 3 category.  He ate his whole sandwich and took the rest for lunch.  I did add Feta cheese as someone else had posted just because it sounded good - and it was.  Easy and Excellent!!!

I made this for a 4th of July bbq and it was a hit.  I prepared it exactly as written and it was a delicious substitute for the traditional hotdog or hamburger!!

The recipe turned out wonderful. I made it for a 4th of July potluck. Next time I will sauté the onions lightly,many then marinate them. Place the suasages on a bun with the onions, tomatoes, and marinade...they were Delish!

Very easy and tasty. The special treat was the tomatoes and I'm not a tomato lover.

QUICK TASTY  We enjoyed this . I will make again . But I didn't  find it fantastic. The marinade for the tomatoes isn't that
different than any tomato side dish for a meal. Here you put it right on sausage and a bun. It's good, but needs something. I added
garlic butter and drizzling of oil to buns . Toasted on BarBQ 
with sausage. Sliced sausage and opened while BarBQ ing
and melted some Swiss cheese on. All was good.

Very good. Easy and several of the ingredients are pantry items. I did let the tomatoe and onion marinate for about 2 .5 hrs. Good weeknight supper.

I made this a while back as per the recipe and the family loved it. Today, since I had the grill fired up I brushed the onion and tomato slices with olive oil, gave them a quick sear and then added them to the marinade. I think it added a nice layer of flavor in there as did a bit of crumbled fresh mozzarella. Sad part is, my home grown heirloom tomato plants aren't ready yet so I had to use the essentially tasteless hothouse tomatoes from the grocery store. Two more weeks and I'll do it again - with the good stuff!
