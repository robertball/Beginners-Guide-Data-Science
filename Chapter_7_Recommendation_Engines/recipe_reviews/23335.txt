This soup was a hearty and purfect on a cold snowy day. I did add 2 cups on water to this recipe so it was more of a soup then an a stew. My family loved it. Thank you Sara

This was pretty good. I do have to say that it's VERY thick as in much thicker than the chili I make. You could eat it with a fork. I had to add 3 cups of broth to get it to the consistency of a soup and that's in addition to the liquid I used from the can of tomatoes. I also didn't see a reason for the extra pan so I browned everything in a stock pot drained the fat then proceeded with adding the vegetables. It tasted even better the next day. It's also very filling!
