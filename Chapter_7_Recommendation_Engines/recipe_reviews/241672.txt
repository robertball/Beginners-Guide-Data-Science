Not to say this wasn't good, but it pretty much tasted like the egg salad that I just throw together.  Good, but nothing really to differentiate it from most other egg salad recipes.

It was just ok, I added a little cayenne, old bay, celery and dill relish. I'll stick to the deviled eggs. Maybe I'll like it better once the seasoning goes through it tomorrow.

I made this as written with the exception of the green onion. It was ok, my son liked it but for myself I thought it needed more mustard.

I just made this with a few changes.  I made it with rotini pasta.  I added celery, diced green olives, white onion, diced red peppers and cheddar cheese.  Everyone asked for the recipe.  was GREAT.  EVERYONE LOVED IT!

This is a really tasty egg salad! I substituted the garlic powder for real garlic which gave it a lift, though. Probably added more salt and pepper as well. Was very easy to make and definitely much better than store-bought versions.
