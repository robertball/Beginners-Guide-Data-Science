Tasty and easy but nothing especially memorable. I think I'll try a different recipe next time.

Great!  I was out of baking soda and eggs but still wanted to make cookies for a chilly night.  I replaced the shortening with butter (same quantity) and did not have chocolate chips even but this turned out great for peanut butter cookies!  I also baked for 15 minutes.

GREATT!!!!This recipe was very easy and tastes great. I didnt use vanilla extract because I didnt have any and instead of the chocolate chips I used the PB Reese pieces ones.Once I pulled them out of the oven I made a hole in the middle added some chocolate from a chocolate bar and a little PB chip in the centre YUMMMMMM.Using the ingredients from this recipe I made 29 cookies :) THANKS

Family loved these. Only negative I heard was that they could use less chocolate :/ Personal opinion :) Really quick and easy to make.
