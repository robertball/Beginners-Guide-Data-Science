As far as Kale soup goes this is definitely 4 stars.  I did make a few changes.  I chose to puree the potatoes in a blender with their broth after I mashed them until smooth.  I used chicken broth instead of water.  Also we added one bunch of scallions chopped, 3/4 cup of very thinly sliced carrots blanched until half done, 3 cloves of garlic crushed, and 1 tsp rosemary.  All of this we added to the soup when we added the sausage and kale.  My family hates kale no matter how I cook it and even they said this was okay.  I got my 7 year old to try half a bowl and she never eats anything but peanut butter or rice.

I made a few modifications as suggested by other reviewers and WOW, this was a GREAT soup. My husband hates kale, and even he loved it. I started by cutting up and browning the sausage in the soup pan. Removed and set aside, then boiled the potatoes in only 8 cups water with 2 chicken bullion cubes. I cut back the butter to 1 tbl. when I'm using real sausage (as opposed to turkey sausage) b/c I figure there's enough fat already. Any sausage will do, I've used hot and mild Italian. Once the potatoes are tender, I don't bother to reserve the liquid. Just take a hand masher and mash them in the water. I didn't use as much kale as the recipe calls for, and I also threw in some swiss and rainbow chard. This is a new favorite in our house!

Update: Trying to get away from bullion cubes (have you looked at the ingredients?!) so I'm now using 4 c. homemade chicken stock and 4 c. water, plus a little more salt. Last batch had kale, chard and turnip greens, plus a few turnips mixed in with the potatoes.

I made a change to this recipe that I think might address other reviewers' comments about watery taste.  I split the kielbasa lengthwise and browned it in the same pan in which I later boiled the potatoes.  I think this made my version a little richer and more flavorful (and gave a browner color).  I also added a ham-flavor bouillon cube to the cooking liquid. These two things made it quite flavorful and salty enough.  The really great thing about this Kielbasa Kale Stew is its versatility.  It seems to accomodate a wide variety of different ingredients and still come out wonderfully.  I added turnip greens (and a few little turnip pieces too) in addition to kale.  I also upped the sausage to 1 lb (since it comes in 1 lb. packages!) and only used 4 large potatoes. Thanks for the tasty, inexpensive, and easy recipe!

Very good recipe.  I cook for a pre-school (3 to 5 year olds) and made this for a cooks choice.  That kids loved it.  I did add some chopped onion, added some 
evaporated milk as substitute for part of the water and used turkey kielbasa.  It was a big hit with the adults too.

This soup was delicious, I love finding a great soup that is also good for you & low in fat. I used turkey sausage. Very Important: increase salt to about 2 1/2 tsp.

This was quite good. I made modifications based on others' reviews. And as I came on to review this, I noticed I left out the butter! Oh well, it was very good anyhow and I DID use a little olive oil as I cut up 1 pound of kielbasa and sauted it a bit with onions and garlic before adding it to the soup. I also used chicken broth rather than water but less, probably 6 cups. I don't think I used that much kale...I used a bag of fresh kale from Trader Joe's that was already chopped. It was my first experience using kale. I will make this again.

My mom has been making "Kale Soup" for years but with Portuguese sausage, it's delicious, ours also has kidney beans in it.  To thicken the broth, slightly mash some of the beans with a potato masher until most of the skins break open.

My husband and I LOVED this recipe! He was skeptical, at first - but is now asking when I'll make it again! Based on other reviews, we changed things up, slightly ... we skipped the butter and the salt altogether (for a healthier dish) and we substituted turkey kielbasa instead of regular.  We did brown the sausage first as another reader recommends and then cooked our potatoes in the same pan with 8 cups of low-sodium chicken broth (instead of water.) We also added onions and garlic to the recipe ... FANTASTIC!  Can't wait to make it again!

This recipe is very good ... however I did make a few changes.  1st I used 2 cans of chicken broth and 1 can of veggie broth to replace some of the water.  2nd I did not totally mash the potatoes just smashed them up till chunky.  It was very easy to make and is really yummy!!  THANKS FOR THE RECIPE!!

i love this recipe! i have altered it a little to be a little more healthy by using turkey kielbasa and a turnip base for the soup instead of the potatoes. i use just a half cup of potato flakes stirred in right at the end to thicken the stew up a little - add more for a little heavier texture :).

I enjoyed this soup -- but my family thought it was disgusting.  So you really have to like kale to try this one.  Very tasty, but the potato base was more watery than I was expecting.  I also added much more salt -- about 3 t.

I made 2 cups of chicken broth and put in 2 cups of water with my (fewer) potatoes, then after I mashed the potatoes I mixed in the broth. I fried onions in olive oil in another pan and then added them with the chicken stock, as well as a clove of garlic. I let that simmer for a while then added the kielbasa, kale, and spices: black pepper, cayenne pepper, and thyme. It was a bit salty with the broth and kielbasa, but still delicious. I would definitely make this again!

I halved the recipe as I only had 1 bunch of kale left.  Omitted the butter and used half chicken broth so I ommited the salt as well.  Browned the sausage first.  Came out great!  I think it really need the chicken broth though.

I LOVE this recipe.  I did add/change a couple of things:  First, I sauteed onions and garlic in the stockpot prior to adding the potatoes.  I also cut the water amount to 5 C. and added 5 C. of chicken broth.  I cut the amount of pepper in half, too.  I find that it's much easier to mash the potatoes in the pot without removing the water.    All in all, an excellent, easy recipe - and easy to "tweak" for personal tastes.

I substituted chicken broth for the water and smoked sausage for the kielbasa. I also added two cloves of crushed garlic for good measure. The soup is more flavorful and no added salt is needed.

I liked this a lot, but my kids wanted much more kielbasa in it.  I also used frozen chopped kale which made it easier.

I halved the recipe but did add more sausage(12 oz pkg). I browned it in pan and then set aside.  I did use ckn broth for water and sauteed onion and garlic to add to broth for potatoes.  Glad I did, or else the flavor would have been bland.  You can mash the potatoes right in the broth. Ended up thick so I had to add water.  If I make again, I'll have to add more onion and garlic.

This was delicious! Finally, a great way to eat Kale. I used spicy red hot sausage and it gave the soup a spicy zing. Delicious!

I'm rating this a four because I didn't actually make it the way it says to. I liked the premise of the recipe but made some changes cause we LOVE flavor!! First I cut up and sautéed the kielbasa, set it aside, added the butter and sautéed 1/2 an onion and 2cloves if garlic. Added a quart of homemade chicken broth and 3cups of water. Added potatoes + dashes of salt, garlic salt, pepper and about 1/4 tsp rosemary. When potatoes were close to tender I added 1/2 cup milk and kielbasa. Let summer 10 mins. Added kale til slightly past wilted. Super delish!! Will make again!

Well, I always hate when someone rates a recipe without following it precisely, but since I gave it 5 stars, I'm going to do so with a relatively clear conscience.  I read others reviews and made some changes up front. First, because I'm nothing if not lazy, after I cooked my cubed potatoes for about 20 minutes, I just mashed them up a bit in the pot. Oh, and I used chicken broth mixed with water because I just assumed that would taste better, and I think that was a good call. And I used most of a bag of collard greens instead of kale, because that's all my grocery store had the day I was there, and I follow the path of least resistance. I also did saute my polska kielbasa a little, along with some onions, and this too, seemed to work out well. We LOVED this, with a cake of cornbread.

I loved this.  I used "Better than Bouillon" in the potato cooking water/soup water and was glad I did.  Because of that I omitted adding additional salt.  I added a can of cannelloni beans and instantly regretted it because they were pretty mushy, right out of the can..... so I used my hand blender and blended the beans and the potatoes so they became smooth and disappeared in the stew.... that made it SO thick and yummy (and I loved the bean taste without actually eating beans) that I think I'll do that next time ... in fact I may leave out the potatoes next time and use two cans of beans, blended, to get the same effect without all the potato calories/carbs.  Again, really good.

This has become one of our new favorite dishes!  I did make a couple small modifications based upon other reviews.  I used pre-cooked smoked turkey sausage and sauteed it with the butter in the pan I later boiled potatoes in.  Also I mashed the potatoes in the water and then put small batches in the blender to make it really creamy.  I also added 2 tblsp better than bullion chicken or vegeatable flavor, carrots, celery and chopped garlic.  We also REALLY love kale and are light meat eaters so I usually double the recipe except for the meat portion.
This recipe is super versatile and works great with broccoli, chard, sweet potatoes or almost any other veggie you want to try. 
Thanks for sharing this one!

Very nice, simple and healthy. I mashed the potatoes in the water. I like the idea how the potatoes thicken the soup. It was fine as is, but maybe a little garlic powder could be added. Perhaps some chicken broth to replace part of the water.

I made several changes, mostly in technique.  First, brown the sausage in the soup pot.  Remove most of the fat.  Cook the potatoes in the same pot (omitting the butter).  Don't drain and mash; instead, use a hand blender to puree most of them, leaving some chunks. Omit the 20 minutes of simmering-- just add the rest of the ingredients, then simmer until the kale is tender - maybe 15-20 minutes.  This approach greatly shortens the overall cooking time, produces fewer dirty dishes, and leaves you with some nice potato chunks in the soup.

So creamy without the cream. I boiled the unpeeled cubed potatoes in the 10 cups water with a couple tablespoons chicken base then used a wand mixer to blend right in the pot. Used chard instead of Kale because that's what I had and heated that with the sliced keilbasa for another 20 minutes. So delicious! Finally found a meal using dark leafy greens that my husband really likes. Even my 3 year old gobbled it up.

This is an absolute keeper!  I sauteed my kielbaska with onion and fresh garlic in EVOO before adding it to the soup. OMG YUMMY!  =~>

A very good base recipe.  I followed other suggestions and added celery, carrots, beans (black are healthiest)... you can't go wrong with additions - get creative. I too used broth (homemade is best) instead of water, as well as 5 large potatoes mashing them well.  Great soup!

After reading the reviews, I too, made a few changes to this recipe and the result was delicious!  I browned the cut up kielbasa with a large chopped onion.  I also used chicken stock and 4 cups of water for the liquid.  I added two cans of canneloni beans, too.  It was great!  Served with cornbread for a great meal.

A started with sauteing one chopped onion, added chicken stock instead of water and then potatoes. I brought to a boil and added the kale and kielbasa. I let simmer all day with a bay leaf and broke up the potatoes right in the pot.

***Update:  OK, used all chicken broth and no added salt this time and its too salty.  Use half water and half broth!***  This soup was pretty good as written.  However, next time I will use chicken broth instead of water and perhaps a few more potatoes for a thicker soup.  It's a keeper, though!

This is a pretty good recipe, but my dad has been making kale soup for years and we have been tweeking it since forever-we just add kale, potatoes, onion, garlic, canned tomatoes with mild chilies, carrots, in chicken stock, simmer for an hour or so till veggies are tender, add some linguica sausage that has been simmered (to get rid of some of the grease) and a couple of cans of whatever kind of beans are on hand (pinto, kidney, white, cannelini)a few shots of hot pepper sauce, and whatever seasonings you like (salt and pepper, bay leaf, oregano, etc).  sometimes I use a kielbasa or beef short ribs if thats all I have.  Its really up to what you like I guess

Great tasting stew! I used turkey kielbasa. It smelled funny after reheating it the second day - not too sure whether it was the kielbasa or the kale.

I just made this stew on a cloudy rainy saturday.  It was PERFECT!  I didn't really change much (OK, maybe I added extra kielbasa).  I didn't have any garlic on hand (of course) so i through in a dash of garlic powder and that gave it some extra flavor. Otherwise it was just great as is.

I make this dish but I use smoked sausage with cheese and put the Kale over top of the potatoes and the sausage on top of the kale.  When the potatoes are done I remove the sausage , drain and mash and then serve with the sausage. I use whatever amount of kale I feel will do the trick to make this tasty dish.  My family loves it.

This was amazing. When I looked at the photos I wasn't too sure about this recipe. And when I made it I was thinking that it least it's healthy. But when I tasted it- Wow! This recipe was delicious! I couldn't believe it. I used an immersion blender which made it very easy to make. I used turkey kielbasa also. I will serve this often.

Definitely a go-to soup on chilly fall/winter days.  This recipe was a good start, but as with many other reviewers I made several modifications.  6 red potatoes, not peeled, sliced into thin rounds - 2T butter - 10 c broth - 2T salt - 1t pepper - 1/2t crushed red pepper - 1/2 c diced onion - 1t minced garlic - kale bunch - 1 lb diced carrot - 1 lb turkey kielbasa.  Sautéed kielbasa, onion, and garlic, then added all remaining ingredients and simmered for about an hour.  The potatoes broke apart nicely so I didn't mash them any further before serving.

Great basic recipe! I followed other reviewers in using broth (vegetable) and sauteeing my veggies (garlic, celery, kale) and sliced pre-cooked pork sausage (Niman Ranch Bratwurst) in a bit of olive oil. Didn't have any onions on hand, but turned out great anyways! 

Also found it helpful to thicken the soup with instant tapioca (I think it's called Minute Tapioca). 

Thanks for the recipe & helpful reviews!

Actually enjoyed the soup as I didn't now what to expect when eating kale.  As most people suggest, I made a chicken stock ahead of time instead of using water.  Definitely worth trying for something different!

I love this recipe but I didn't mash the potatoes up.  I cubed them and left them like that in the soup.  I also cooked the kale for about 15 minutes instead of thirty so it wouldn't be over done.  Great soup on a cold night.

I was excited to make this recipe because it reminds me of a dish my grandfather used to make for those chilly, winter days, except he often added beans. I substituted a cup of water for a can of chicken broth, and added corn too. Also added lots more salt (at least 3 tsp.), a little more pepper, a tbsp. of minced garlic, and some garlic and pepper seasoning salt all until I got the taste to make sure it wouldn't be too watery. I also added a little more kielbasa, which adds nice flavor to the broth. Make sure you have a big pot to cook it in. Mine was the normal sized soup pot (thought it was big enough) and I could only fit in a pound of packaged kale with everything else in it, but that seemed plenty anyways. My boyfriend enjoyed it, and he's never had kale before since he's more of the meat and potatoes man. I'll definitely make this one again. Hearty, healthy, and delish!

This is excellent and perfect for a cold winter afternoon.  It's not the easiest thing in the world to make, I find chopping all the kale a makes a big mess and draining the potato water and saving it is very difficult.  Its worth all the work and we make several times each winter.

I thought this was quite good, but I have to agree with the other reviewers that it required a chicken broth base or it would have been too watery.  I also used a combination of potatoes and sweet potatoes, and added some corn.  Mmmmmm...

Not great. You need to be very liberal with the spices, for one. The kielbasa with the veggies is an odd pairing.  It's edible but won't bowl you over.

This is our new favorite soup. Like other reviewers, I brown the sausage with an onion in the soup pan, set aside and then boil the potatoes, which I then hand mash right in the pan. Finally, when I add the Kale and sausage back in, I also add in 1/2 cup of lentils and teaspoon or so of fennel seeds. This is an easy fall soup that has plenty of leftovers.

Surprisingly Delicious!! I just wanted to make something new with kielbasa sausage...came upon this recipe and figured why not doesn't sound too bad... Doesn't Sound Too Bad???!! Please it's DELICIOUS!!!! Only differences I did were: I used "baby kale" & 4.5 potatoes because that's all I had... I also added half a cube of chicken buillion & 1 whole cube of vegetable buillion and I eyed the water to be about 2inches over to cover the ingredients. So mine wasn't too too thick.. I wanted it to be more like a soup vs stew. It is SO GOOD!

I used canned quartered potatoes. I added a diced onion and some garlic to the browning sliced sausage. I used a quart of chicken broth for half of the liquid. The crowd at the lake loved the soup!

Like others, I added about half an onion and four cloves of garlic. Also used 8 cups of low sodium chicken broth instead of water. Turned out great!

Great base for potato soup! I left out the kale but sauteed and added 2 cloves garlic, celery and soem green onions. I also added a can of corn to make this soup a little heartier. Soup is really creamy - my family could not quit eating it!
