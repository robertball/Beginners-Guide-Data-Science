This recipe was AWESOME!! It was easy and cheap, plus my husband loved it. I only used 1 large pepper per color and still had enough taste. And I only used one large Zuc.I think two red and yellow would have been overkill. I did't cook the veggies for the full ten minutes b/c I like my veggies a little crisp, but thats just preference. On the whole this is one of my favorite recipes. Its easy and healthy, what more could you want? I will definitly be cooking this again.
Thanx!

I followed the advise of another user and only used one color pepper, each, for this recipe.  I thought this had a wonderful flavor!  I added a bit more basalmic vinegar, only because our family LOVES basalmic!!!  Served this with garlic mashed potatoes and a chef salad.  Will definitely put this in the recipe box to use again!

I felt very healthy eating this dish, and my roommate liked it; however, I'm not gonna eat the left overs.  I used only 1/2 a pound of mushrooms.  I just felt something was missing.  I might try this with chicken or beef to see if it turns out differently.

I wasn't sure this turned out right after I took it out of the oven, but my husband and his friend enjoyed it very much.  I didn't use zucchini, because he doesn't like it.  I also used Healthy Choice sausage, which makes it a bit healthier!  I will make again.  Thanks!

This was really a 4 1/2 star.  I thought the flavors were great.  This is one of the few ways I've found that I like polish keilbasa.  Like others I used just one red and yellow pepper and one zuchinni.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.

This was delicious! I used 2 green peppers and one red..one yellow, and light Polish sausage. I didn't expect it to cook down so much, but the flavors were excellent. I served it over rice.
Next time, I think I would brown the sausage first..take it out of the pan, and then cook the veggies. 4 1/2 stars for me, and I'll definately make this one again..Thanks!

WOW!  This is the best way to get an amazing flavor out of the kielbasa.  I didn't have all the vegetables listed, so I only used one red bell pepper and one onion.  The balsamic vinegar is the KEY ingredient in this recipe.  It is what blends it all together in a beautiful medley.  Otherwise, it just tastes oily ^_^

Good recipe! I omitted the mushrooms because I didn't have any and used chicken sausage. Also, I cooked the veggies first set aside and cooked the sausage, then I added the veggies to the sausage, this way I had the veggies nice and crispy and the sausage well done just the way I like it.

Loved the balsamic vinegar w/this. Wow! I partially fried some potatoes in a separate pan then added them w/the pepper mixture along w/the sausage. They were perfect when all was done. I only used green peppers, red peppers, & red onions for the veggies, as that was all I had & was looking for a way to use them up. I'll def make this again!

I saw this recipe after looking for a recipe to use a package of Johnsonville sweet Italian sausage. I had a couple of small green peppers and used that for the peppers suggested. I didnt have mushrooms, but boiled 6 red potatoes I halved to make sure I still got the same servings. I liked the seasonings. I would not have thought to use steak seasoning, but did half the onion powder. I cooked the vegetables, removed them, and the decased and cut the sausages into pieces, and cooked them separately.  I drained the sausage on a paper towel and served on a platter along side the vegetables. I realized I never garnished with the balsamic and parmesan at the end and it was fine. Ty

I am eating this as I write my review!  On it's own it is very filling!

I read the reviews and cut back on the veggies.  I wish I hadn't because after you cook the veggies they are half the size they were raw!  I also forgot to cut back on the spices...still good though.

My grocery store had precut veggies which made this recipe even easier.  These are a little more expensive than buying the veggies whole but overall it is a cheap recipe!

I also cooked the veggies first for about 12 minutes, took them out of the skillet then cooked the sausage.  I wanted my sausage with a crisp edge and I didn't have much room left in my skillet.  I mixed them together in a large bowl when the sausagege was done then added the balsamic.

I will definately be making this again!

I love this recipe! It smells so good while its cooking!  It tastes wonderful, too. Nice and light, you don't feel bogged down after you eat it.  It does take a long time to cut everything up, but its very worth it! I used regular "light" polish sauage, since they didn't have any turkey. Yum yum!

This was fantastic and got rave reviews from my husband!!!! I will definitely make this again. I didn't have parmesan on hand, but this is so good it didn't need it. I served my dish with chicken flavored rice, but thought that this would be great with buttered noodles as well. Thanks for submitting!!

I personally loved this recipe!  I omitted the mushrooms because I don't like them.  I used both zucchinis called for, but only used 2 super large red bell peppers because they were on sale, while the yellow ones weren't.  I served it over brown rice.  I could easily eat this once a week, but the kids picked out the peppers.

I made this recipe this evening with veggies from our garden.  I added 1 yellow squash and 1 patty pan squash but omitted the mushrooms.  This was soo good!!  I love all the veggies, and the kielbasa makes you feel like you've eaten a hearty meal.  I wouldn't have thought the steak seasoning would add so much, but it did.  I used about a half of a tablespoon and the flavor was great!

This was pretty good. My husband really liked it. I make this type of meal alot ususally out on the grill. This one I did inside in a large skillet. I cooked it a bit differently. I cooked the veggies first and added wedged tomatoes (I do this to add juice to the dish) at the last minute.  Then I removed the veggies and added sausage. Something made me squirmy about cooking raw turkey with veggies. Then I added veggies to the cooked turkey and did the balsamic and cheese at last minute, that was a nice touch. I served mine over brown rice. All in all pretty good.

made this exactly as written, the only exception is that I used zucchini noodles instead of chopped to give it come contrast and fried my sausage a little before adding it to the mix. It's still amazing. Saving to my saved pile to definitely make again

This is a good dish. I omitted the zucchini, because I felt it just didn't fit and I cut the amounts of peppers and garlic in half. I made some with the balsamic vinegar and some without. Both were good. It came together very fast, which was great. I would definitely make this again.

What caught my eye was the steak seasoning and garlic with the veggies. It was really good. The parm on top was a nice touch, too. Will make again for sure!!

Very tasty! I would recommend cooking the sausage in another pan before adding it to the veggies. Also, I didn't have balsamic vinegar, so I used rice vinegar...and this recipe still was pretty great.

I've started feeding my family more turkey and chicken based recipes.  This one was delicious.  I cooked it exactly as it states.  I will cook the sausage seperatly next time to crisp it up a bit.  However, I didn't have a smidgen leftover cooking it as is. Yummy.

I used only one of each pepper and it was still a LOT of vegetables.  I might cut back a bit next time, but it's a good, colorful mix.  All those vegetables have to be good for you, right?  I also think the veggies were a little overcooked, so I will cook them 7 or 8 minutes instead next time.

It was much too blah for my taste. I was hoping it would have had more flavor, even after I added a lot more seasoning.
