We bought some Pillsbury crescent rolls to use as our pastries.  We found that unrolling the whole can and cutting it into 8 squares worked best.  We sealed the edges with egg and pressed it with a fork.  They came out great and were a good after dinner snack.  Although they would be good for breakfast with tea.

The chocolate is very subtle.  The flavors work really well together with nothing over-powering the others.

I actually deep fried these with wonton skins. They were really delicious. But I had a lot of filling left over. and I used fresh figs which made it kind of jam like.

Yeah, not real impressed with this. It tasted just fine, but was thick and tacky. Followed the recipe as is.
