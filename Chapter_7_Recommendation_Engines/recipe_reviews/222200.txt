This is a great recipe.  The only thing i changed is I baked the trout for 10 minutes and then panfried it for the colour and to make it crispy.  Next time, i would peel the squash as well.
i would definitely make this again!!  It was delicious and my family loved it too.

This is a really good dish, the flavor of the fish squash and salsa combined was great. I was really full afterwards because the squash was so big. Will definitely add to my list of Paleo friendly staples.

We just ate this for dinner tonight. All we had was cold smoked trout slices, but i still added the oil and fresh dill and put the slices in the oven at 300 for 5-7 minutes. I was really skeptical at first, but i figured if we try it the way you told us to, we could blame you if it was weird. But it wasn't weird at all, it leaned more towards interesting. The squash itself was warm and nurturing, of course. But the salsa gave it kick and brightened up the trout at the same time. It worked! Excellent dinner. Boyfriend is stuffed and girlfriend is happy :) Thanks for the recipe!

I did make it with some salmon fillets instead of trout.  I think it would be good with most fish, you would just have to minor adjustments for cooking the fish.  I was in a hurry and instead of taking the time to make the salsa, I used some hot Ro*Tel. I 'm sure making the salsa would have improved the texture and flavor but it was great anyway.

It's easy, delicious, and nutritionally dense. This is a go-to recipe that even my two-year-old loves.
