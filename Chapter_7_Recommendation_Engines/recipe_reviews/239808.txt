The Oreos are so festive for Halloween. I melted the white chocolate chips in a heat proof glass large measuring cup. I placed the cup in the microwave and stirred after every 20 seconds until melted. Insert a toothpick before coating the Oreos. I also placed the oreos on cooling rack so I didn't have to scrap off the extra melted chocolate around the edges.  I added some yellow and red food coloring for the pumpkins. I also bough some black food coloring for the pumpkin eyes. The container is a 12 oz. cup cut down to two inches. I used tacky glue to add scrapbook paper and added a ribbon. Add candy and Oreos to make a cute give away Halloween treat.

All the 5th grade kids liked these.  My food coloring drops never did make the orange color look quite right.  We used m&m's for the eyes and candy corn for the nose - very cute

This was a lot of fun to make.  I used a candy mold.
