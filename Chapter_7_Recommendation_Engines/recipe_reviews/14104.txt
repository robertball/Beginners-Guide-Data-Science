Uh.  I haven't tried this recipe, but as a Japanese American who has also lived in Japan for 6 years, I know teriyaki sauce and I know tofu.  This recipe sounds gross.  Teriyaki sauce does not make a good salad dressing, especially mixed with mustard, and especially store-bought teriyaki sauce that is chock full of lovely corn syrup.  For a dressing rice vinegar mixed with a bit of soy sauce.  For salad, try silken tofu, it is much better uncooked than the firm kind.  Cube it instead of crumbling

I guess I should have read the other review.  I made it, and it was not good. We didn't save the leftovers.

Olives don't belong, and recipe belongs as a stir fry.  I'd add fresh Ginger, delete cucumbers, replace Dijon mustard with red chili paste, use 1/2cup fresh peas , add snow peas and bean sprouts, oh yes...replace teriyaki with soy sauce and a dash of rice vinegar...all stir fried in peanut oil.
