I was looking for the flavorful ginger dressing you'd find at a Japanese hibachi steakhouse, and this recipe is definitely not it.  It tastes ok, but I ended up throwing it out after eating one serving over salad.  The ingredients just didn't seem to mesh well together after whisking.  Alas, I continue my search for that elusive creamy ginger dressing...

Wonderful dressing with modifications.  I reduced vinegar to 1/2 cup and I used Rice Vinegar instead.  I'm not a vinegar person and 1 cup was very watery.  I also upped the Sesame Oil from 1 tsp to 2-3tsp.

Very good salad dressing, although it does require a bit of tweaking!  The list of ingredients is perfect, but the measurements need a little changing.  One tip- if you have a good seasons bottle follow the vinegar and oil lines on the bottle and add everything else in varying quantities according to your tastes and it will turn out well!  Also, rice wine vinegar gives it a bit more authentic taste!

I made this dressing to take to work and I liked it so good that I kept it. It was well worth the time to make it.

CHANGE THE WHITE VINIGER TO RICE VINIGER AND USE TO TASTE.  1 CUP OF VINIGER IS ALOT.

This recipe has potential if you lessen the amount of vinegar used. That's all I could taste!

Definitely only use half the vinegar.  But it needs something else.. soy sauce I think.  There's another recipe for Asian Ginger Dressing on this website that I like better.

This is exactly what we were looking for complement our Oriental Spinach salad with stir fried pork.    Tangy, and that little bite was just what the salad needed.  It's a keeper!

Super easy and really good! I scaled it to half the amount and put all the ingredients into a Italian dressing shaker bottle, tossed it with some coleslaw mix, added some crunchy chow mein noodles and voila! A perfect side to Mongolian broccoli beef and rice. :)

Way too much vinegar for my family's taste. I will not make this again.

Reviews are all over the place on this one, but I'm in the "I like it group."  I used rice vinegar instead of white vinegar, and although it may be just a little vinegar-y, I don't think by much.  I thought it's loaded with flavor and is exactly what I would expect to be served at a Japanese restaurant.

I used this to marinate my salmon. I cut the recipe in half for about 3/4 of a pound of fish. I used apple cider vinegar instead   of white. I think it lacked a tiny bit...next time I make it Ill add some cracked black pepper. But it was definitely very yummy on fish. :)

Really nice flavor!  I cut all ingredients by 1/4 because this recipe makes way too much.  I have enough now for about four really big dinner salads.

Very good dressing. I headed the advise of others & used 1/2 cup of Rice Wine Vinegar instead of 1 cup of regular vinegar. I added a tad bit more Sesame Oil, & only used 3/4 cup of oil. I used a little lemon as well. It was a great fit for our grilled salmon salad.
