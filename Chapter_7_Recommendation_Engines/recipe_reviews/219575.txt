This was really decent.  The only changes I made were to substitute cream of chicken for the cream of mushroom and canned carrots instead of frozen (added for a few minutes at the end) since I didn't have the other options on hand.  I did have to simmer for longer since one of the pieces of chicken was still VERY rare in the inside but it still turned out pretty good!
