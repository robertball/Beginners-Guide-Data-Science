This was a super good recipe! I didn't use frozen squash, I roasted a whole butternut in the oven and used that instead. I used whole milk instead of non-dairy creamer because non-dairy creamer just freaks me out...I wonder if it's really a food or something concocted in a lab somewhere.  I also swapped brown sugar for the white sugar. Other than that, the recipe remained the same and I and my other dinner party guests loved this recipe. Thanks for submitting it!

This was very good; I made a few alterations using my MIL's traditional recipe.  I used 2% instead of the creamer and added an extra 1/4c (3/4c total).  I also added 1tsp. vanilla and 6oz No Yolk egg noodles.  A nice breakfast dish and a sneaky wayto get in more veggies.

My family & I loved this.  I had a fresh butternut squash, so I baked it and measured the ounces for the recipe.  It was delicious hot, and as a cold leftover as well.

Awesome dish and super easy. I couldn't find 160z butternut squash, so I used 12oz winter squash. Turned out great.

This was delicious! I made this for Passover substituting 1/2c potato starch for the flour. I also used a whole butternut squash that I had laying around. It was a big hit at dinner and this will be a staple for every big holiday meal!

My family and I loved this.  Tastes a little like sweet cornbread.  I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of non-dairy creamer, and butter instead of margarine. Yummy!

oh my gosh -- SO easy, SO delicious. I had a full crew (12) for thanksgiving dinner this past weekend and they were raving about it. What a fantastic dish! :)  
Just to add that "canadien" flare, I added a sprinkling of maple syrup flakes on the top.

Great recipe. I love the texture and taste. I changed a few things, such as using 1/2 c brown sugar and half-n-half instead of the creamer. I also used butternut squash I bought from the local farmer's market.

I used double the amount of butternut squash and still thought it was too sweet. My family liked it which is why I gave it 3 stars.

Not a big hit in our family
