This was really good.  Dried herbs worked just fine.  I think 3 1/2 minutes per side was a little long for the size of my chops so if you have small ones you might want to watch them.

Fantastic recipe/I did not use the mint as we do not like it. Think the sauce would work well with chicken as well. Give this max rating..

Be careful with the type of balsamic vinegar used. Heirloom balsamic made it almost too sweet. Wonderful recipe though.

I love it!  I cook lamb chops often but I generally like them simple with pepper and salt.  However, I really love the extra flavor of this recipe.  The flavor and the aroma are perfectly blended and it gives the lamb additional flavor.

I didn't have mint or shallots. Used onion powder in the shallots place. Still absolutely delicious- The best lamb I've ever made:)

Awesome dish! I added an apple with the onions to spice it up. I made it with Lamb shoulder which worked out just as well.

Awesome recipe! My husband and I truly enjoyed these. The balsamic reduction sauce is delicious and the lamb was cooked perfectly...my lamb was more like 1" thick and I cooked 4min per side and they were perfectly pink in the middle.

I made this last night and OMG it was absolutely delicious!! I cooked for my mom and she kept saying "I didn't know lamb could taste like that!" and got every last little bit of meat of the bones!  I followed the recipe pretty much as instructed, except I didn't have shallots so I used 1/4 C minced onion and 3 garlic cloves.  I also had 1/4 C fresh basil and I chopped that up and threw that in as well.  I mixed all the herbs into a small bowl and added a splash of olive oil so that the herb mixture stuck together a bit and would stay on the lamb chops better.  All the flavours went extremely well together and it was sooo easy to make! But it definitely is a dish that I would make if I had company and wanted to impress!

This was so wonderful!  I used all the ingredients but needed to make some adjustments because I had thick chops.   I seasoned the lamb with the first five ingredients and then browned them.  I finished cooking them in the oven at 450 degrees until they reached 140 degree temperature.   I made the sauce as directed but added some mint and a little brown sugar while it simmered.  Oh my...  delicious!

Outstanding!  I tried this mainly because I have the fresh herbs.  Even without all the name brand in-grediants it was wonderful.

we gave this a 2 because thats what we thought of it, and if i made it wrong it must be a bad recipe because I have made hundreds with no failures, most people here seemed to change the recipe so I probably would need to, but its not worth the money. Very disapponted

Excellent recipe! I followed this recipe using every ingredient. However, I used dried herbs that I already had and it still was one of the best lamb chop dishes I've ever had. THe aroma in the house from this will make you think you're eating at Ruth Chris or Mortons...good stuff!

This is an amazing recipe if you like lots of flavor. I did not like lamb chops that I had in restaurants so I was very skeptical when my husband said he was making lamb chops. This is now one of my favorite meals. We don't like the mint taste so we don't use it - otherwise great. Use the sauce over rice for the perfect meal.

Wonderful recipe!  Used basil instead of mint and cooking sherry instead of balsamic vinegar just b/c I didn't have either on hand and my husband loved it.  Great flavor!

This is a simple yet delicious recipe. The only thing I altered was the cooking time since my chops were a little thicker. Other than that I followed everything exactly as stated and we were not disappointed. My whole family enjoyed these flavorful chops. I served with roasted asparagus and mashed sweet potatoes. A keeper...thanks for sharing!

This recipe was to die for!  My husband gave it a 10 out of 10!  (And he can be a harsh critic!)  I had to make a few changes due to lack of certain ingredients.  I substituted orange zest for mint, onion powder and dried minced onion for shallots, and unseasoned meat tenderizer for salt.  I also used dried herbs and decreased the recipe to 2 servings.  I will most definitely be making this recipe again.  Please, if you haven't, you MUST TRY THIS!  It really does taste like something you'd eat out at a high end restaurant!  Hain Celestial--THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing this recipe!!!  A+++

I have made this several times and find it is wonderful every time!  The only things I change are: 1. When we don't have fresh herbs, dried work fine, and 2. We like our meat medium-well to well done, so we cook our chops 5-6 minutes on each side, depending on their size.
I also save any leftover sauce to use as a steak sauce... it is fabulous!  Thank you so much for sharing.

This was a bit hit at my dinner party, it was amazing and simple to do! I used 2 to 3 lamb rib chops per person, that was my only change!

Yum! I stumbled upon this recipe after my lamb was already marinaded for 24 hours (similar ingredients plus vinegar & olive oil) but followed the rest of the process and it turned out wonderful. The sauce is delicious  over lamb and mashed potatoes.

Wow, this recipe was delicious. I used fresh mint & rosemary but didn't have thyme so I used the dried version. Also browned on the skillet, but cooked on the grill for five minutes.

They were beyond amazing. I'm going to make them all the time now!

My only edit is that it took closer to 8 minutes to reduce the balsamic mixture.

This recipe is simple & awesome. It led to the discovery that my super picky 4-year-old son LOVES lamb chops. I've committed the recipe to memory & serve it regularly to my family. I've even forgotten the sauce & no one noticed...the seasoning is that perfect for it.

Delicious! I added a little red wine and garlic to the reduction, but otherwise I kept everything the same. So good...
