Exactly like the crispy noodles you get at the restaurants! You must be careful not to cook them too long, these noodles brown very fast and must be watched continuously. The perfect addition to soups or salads!

Crazy good dusted with cinnamon sugar to serve with fruit salad. This could be dangerous knowledge...

These are great exactly like the resturants.  Watch them close so they dont burn.

Made these using my countertop deep fryer rather than a wok.  Still worked wonderfully.  The crispy noodles are my favorite addition to hot-and-sour soup!

Awesome ,so easy. I did them in a deep fryer method..in a sauce pan with oil. Dropped them in bunches . They would be a great with soup or put garlic or cinn/sugar for a crunchy snack.
