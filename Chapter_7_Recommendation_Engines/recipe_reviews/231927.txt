I used the tomatoes as a garnish.  This is light and tasty!  I loved the ginger for a surprise in this bean salad!  The amount of soy sauce did not over power the salad, and I enjoyed it!

DELISH. Didn't have time to shred carrots so I cut them into thin matchsticks and sauteed them with a bit of oil to soften them up. Quick and simple salad. Will be making it again for sure.
