YUMMY! Made them exactly as written, except that I crushed up the instant cofee in my hand before combining it with the flour because I wanted it to be finer and  better distributed. The dough is pretty sticky at first, but once you refrigerate it, about an hour or so, it becomes super easy to work with.  After I frosted them, I dipped the tops into chocolate sprinkles and they looked really beautiful. I used a small cookie scoop and was able to get 35 out of the recipe. I know these are gonna be a hit on my Christmas cookie trays this year! Thanks for posting. :)

These are truly incredible cookies. I loved the coffee flavor...it wasn't too strong, yet still very present. The sweet, chocolate-y frosting really complimented the cookies, which weren't all that sweet and had that delicious, buttery, coffee flavor. I put my coffee granules in a small bowl and crushed them with the back of a regular spoon...this was extremely easy and not messy at all. That way, the coffee didn't leave large, unpleasant flecks throughout my cookie dough. Because I didn't want to wait all day, I chilled the dough in the freezer for about 20 minutes, and it was the perfect consistency for shaping. I made my balls slightly smaller than the recipe called for, so that they would be an appropriate size for my cookie trays. The only problem I had with this recipe is that I ran out of frosting...not sure if this is because of the smaller balls, or maybe because my family loves frosting, so I am a bit heavy handed :) The frosting did seem really runny to me as well...I ended up adding about 2 tbs. or so of extra powdered sugar because as it was, the glaze just ran right off the cookies. This did cause the frosting to harden sooner, so I had to remelt it on the stove a couple of times before I was done. I decorated the finished cookies with Christmas sprinkles, and they looked great! All in all, this is a wonderful recipe that I would definitely make again! Thanks for sharing!

These baked up beautifully, like shortbread buttons.  Not too sweet but very flavorful.  The icing is almost not necessaryand I found it too sweet, so I stirred in a teaspoon of the coffee granules.  They cut the sweetness and enhanced the chocolate flavor. I also decided to let the cookies cool before adding the frosting because it just ran right off the warm cookies, making a mess.  I wish I had seen Christina's idea of crushing the coffee before adding it.  Thanks for another great recipe.

I really liked the idea of these cookies since we love coffee. I wanted a butter type cookie not a shortbread so I added 1 large egg, kept the recipe the same otherwise, used Maxwell House instant coffee and the cookies had a good coffee flavour. I used a 1 tbsp scoop and got 42 cookies, at 13 minutes my cookies were done, will try 11 minutes next time, there was butter bubbling around the cookies which was off putting will add a little more flour next time. The cookies and frosting need to be warm as soon as they cool it is impossible to spread, will use a traditional ganache next time which is easier to use. Tasty recipe that needs some tweaking to make it work properly, will try again.

Wonderful cookie! Very delicate cookie with great flavor. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding 1 Tbs of Kahlua to the oookie dough and 1 Tbsp of Kahlua to the frosting. Make sure you frost the cookies while they are still warm.

These are very yummy.  I made coffee shortbread cookies recenlty and they tasted the same but I liked these better because of the frosting.  I found that my frosting was very thick and kinda hard to spread on the cookie that were almost cool.  Next time I would add either coffee to the frosting or Kahlua just because I love cooffee flavored things.  I am definitely making these again!

I love these cookies! I did mix the coffee in with the butter mix then added extra coffee to the flour mix. But I'm a coffee lover :) I didn't have any unsweetened chocolate so I used 1 1/2 T cocoa powder and 1 1/2 t of oil. Set up perfectly.  My husband flipped over these cookies.

This is similar to a recipe my mother-in-law gave me.  We dissolve the coffee granules in a teaspoon of boiling water and add it into the first step, with the butter etc.   We even make sandwich cookies instead of icing the top.  Just flatten the dough balls with the bottom of a glass dipped in icing sugar and bake half the time suggested.

OMG this is one seriously delicious cookie with just the perfect amount of coffee flavor and melt in your mouth texture. The only thing we did was to add a bit of warm water to the instant coffee granules to dissolve rather than add them in dry. Absolutely wonderful and one that will make an appearance every year on my Christmas cookie tray. Thank you so much!!

WOW!  These cookies are fantastic!  I chose to make these for our annual cookie exchange and I had to make sure I liked them first.  So, I made a batch.  My husband kept begging me for more!  I also crushed up the instant coffee a bit with the back of a spoon.  During the last 2 minutes I pushed the back of a spoon into the cookies a bit so there was a little alley for the frosting to sit in.  I will definitely be making these again!!

This is a nice little shortbread cookie with good coffee taste.  I followed the recipe for the dough and did not have any problem with pooling butter as another reviewer did.  I did not make the frosting but made a semi-sweet ganache which complimented the cookie nicely.  I marked it down slightly as I make a similar cookie that I believe is better.  Thank you for sharing.

Mmmm!! I think this cookie just knocked the socks of all my other fave cookies! They're melt-in-your-mouth-take-you-straight-to-paradise delicious all in one bite! I made these small ... that I managed almost 90-100 of these without doubling them. Mind you, mine were not minuscule sized, they were just not 3/4 inch balls. :) I did 2 things differently, the first was to take the advise of the other reviewers and add 1 tbsp of hot water to the coffee granules to make them into a paste and add  them to the butter-sugar-vanilla mixture. The other thing I did different was to not glaze them (coz we LOVE coffee) and just place a single milk chocolate chip over each cookie. So pretty! Also, I was in a hurry and my cookie dough seemed alright to work with it so I didn't chill it. They took exactly 18 minutes to turn a lovely mild golden. They were gobbled up at top speed at my place, and I salvaged the rest to fill up a med-size container to send off with my sister to college. The rest of the family's already begging for more, so I'm going to be making these again tomorrow! =) Oh and these are also definitely going on my holiday platter this year! Thank you Leitzel for this lovely find! And thank you reviewers for your reviews that encouraged me try this! =D

I really enjoy these, but they can be really potent depending on which instant coffee brand you use. My kids didn't like them much, but the grownups sure did!

I followed the recipe exactly and thought they turned out great!  The only thing I would change is the cooking time.  My first batch I cooked for 18 minutes and they turned out crispy, so I reduced the cooking time to 10-15 minutes and they were perfect.  I also had NO issues with the frosting and even had some left over.  Thank you for a great recipe!  This will be a holiday regular.

These were ok. I didn't taste the coffee flavor, and I used a known brand of coffee too so that disappointed me. I thought the 'glaze' was too thick more like a frosting which is fine but I tried piping it on and that was a pain, and it wasn't as sweet as I had expected.

I don't drink coffee, so I thought that these really had a strong coffee flavor.  My husband thought they were just right, but didn't care for the crumbliness and would have preferred a softer cookie.  The dought was easy to work with after chilling.  I didn't have any unsweetened chocolate, so I took another reviewers tip and used chocolate chips melted with milk and then added powdered sugar.

Didn't have any powdered sugar on hand, so I just took regular sugar and put it in a food processor. Still came out great. My brother couldn't stop eating them, and really, he's all about healthy eating and whatnot, so he NEVER eats cookies! He made an exception for these. ; D

I followed the ingredients, but stirred the coffee granules with 1/2 TBL milk, then added the vanilla extract to the coffee and THEN put it in the butter and sugar mixture... last mixed in the flour.  I got 36 cookies total, made an indent with back of measuring spoon (necessary!) for the glaze to fit. or sometimes I drizzle lines of icing. I made the glaze much simpler! Just melted 1/2 cup of chocolate chips with 1 TBL butter, 2 TBL milk and stirred in confectioners sugar for the right consistency. I also melted in 1 TBL coffee granules to this glaze. Very good! Looks like chocolate thumbprint cookies but tastes way better. I've also used dark chocolate chips and drizzle icing lines instead.

Good cookies but I found that changes needed to be made. My dough was very dry and I needed to add water to get a good  consistency.  Then with the glaze. I found a cup of confectioners to be far too much. It came out like a gluey chocolate pudding. I started over using just the butter and chocolate and added the milk and just a small amount of confectioners- just to thicken it a little. Much better! I also took another reviewer's advice and added Kahlua to the glaze bec it need some jazzing up.  A tip to get the glaze on neatly- use a spoon with one hand to lift a spoonful of glaze up from the bowl- then quickly dip the cookie into the spoon and turn right-side up again.   They look like cute little buttons and make a nice presentation.

AMAZING! The coffee taste is so, so good! It's subtle, even though I doubled the instant coffee granules (from 1 to 2 TBS). I think the chocolate glaze is a must - the combination of chocolate and coffee was perfect. After I let them cool enough to hold them, I dipped the cookies in the chocolate glaze and then into sprinkles. They look so professional! Also, I did crush the granules with the back of a spoon in a small custard dish as per other reviews - was easy, not messy, and worked well. Thanks!

Imagine that -a chocoholic/coffeeholic like myself loving these. I mixed the coffee in with the butter first-to soften the coffee granules. So good, very easy. Thanks for the recipe will make again

A really good, sophisticated cookie.  I used instant espresso powder (thought about going caffeine free, but flavor won out).  Mine turned out crispy with a shortbread taste/texture.  Found I did not need to chill, just rolled in my hand.  Yield for me was 38 cookies.  For frosting, I melted 1 cup semi-sweet choco chips and mixed it with a cup of my homemade buttercream frosting.  I also added a tsp coffee granules to frosting.  Tasty.  Piped large stars onto the cookie while slightly warm.  They are one of the prettiest cookies I've made (picture included).  Great cookie recipe.  Thanks!

Instructions were a little off for me... Next time, I'll make them 1-1/4" instead of 3/4" and cook them for no more than 15 minutes to keep them from browning on the bottom. Also, (it's probably the heat & humidity in NC in July, but) the frosting was way too runny for me. Still, excellent flavor and worth tinkering with until I get it right. :)

I followed the main recipe as-is, except did only half the recipe. I didn't find it to have much of a coffee flavor (I used Taster's Choice Hazelnut and did grind the granules down to a fine powder) - so maybe even non-coffee drinkers would like this cookie. I was hoping it'd be a really pronounced flavor. I think I will make it again, but add more coffee to the main cookie and add it to the icing as well, and maybe I'll even go out a buy a decent instant coffee like Starbucks Via. For the icing, I actually followed reviewer NJtoAL's advice in her 1/18/2010 review - but again used half - 1/4 cup choc chips, 1 TBL butter, 1 TBL milk and powdered sugar until I got the consistency I wanted. With the half recipe I made 24 cookies with approx 2-inch diameters.

These are absolutely delicious cookies!   I think using all butter is very important - I wouldn't recommend substituting.  I also liked that they basically remain in whatever shape you put them on the cookie sheet, so you can put lots on a sheet and bake a couple dozen at a time.   They were the first cookie finished off at my holiday party - and I was right in there w/my friends gobbling them up!

I was glad I had read some of the reviews, because I was concerned about the bits of instant coffee in the dough. I dissolved the coffee with 1/2 tbsp. of milk before adding to the mixture.  The resulting cookie is basically a shortbread. I had no problem with the baking; 18 minutes in my oven and they were perfectly done.  I thought the icing was a bit bland. I added a little Kahlua as one reviewer suggested, but I think it still needed a richer chocolate taste.  I dipped the top side of the cookies while they were still warm into the icing, which adhered with no problem.  I think these  cookies are nice enough, just not "fabulous".

These cookies are divine!!  I would have given 5 stars, but the recommendation to frost cookies while warm was bad advice, IMO.  Just as I suspected, the frosting slid right off!  Nevertheless, I will be making these again.  Right now, in fact.  Thanks!

I agree with other reviewers on a couple things. The cookies *definitely* need that sweet, chocolately glaze. They're very bitter without. I also reduced the cooking time to about 15 minutes, and they still came out a little crispier than I would've liked.   I ran out of chocolate glaze (was using leftover batch) and actually substituted melted white chocolate. Those turned out very well & made a nice contrast on the platter.   Nice, unique cookie, but the flavor just seemed a little "off" too me.

I followed the directions as is and changed not one thing except the cooking time I lessened as I do not like my cookies crisp I like them softer. I too did as suggested and crushed up the coffe a bit more with a spoon. They turned out pretty good. I chilled the dough for about 2 hours before bakig. Thanks for sharing!

I thought these were full of great flavor.  I'll be making these for next years family cookie swap.  I did make the just as the recipe stated.  No need to make a double batch of frosting as some suggested.  I still had extra.  I also tried adding some Kaluha to the frosting in my second batch.  Very tastey!

I enjoyed these, but my first batch burned. I measured the balls to equal 3/4 inch, but 18-20 minutes was too long to bake. I would suggest 14-15 and just keep a close eye on them. It would've made 45 cookies but I ended up with 30 after the first batch burned. I had just enough glaze for the 30 cookies so if I make these again I would increase the amount of glaze. I also topped with chocolate sprinkles after glazing. Delicious coffee flavor.

If you enjoy the flavor of coffee...and even more with chocolate, you will love these treats! I followed the cookie recipe as written--only refrigerating the dough for about 20 minutes. Using a small cookie scoop, this was a quick process that yielded great, delicate treats! I like how they crumble and melt in your mouth. The addition of chocolate is amazing! I didn't have unsweetened chocolate so I just melted chocolate chips with butter...and threw in some extra instant coffee. These are awesome!!

Oh my, these turned out very yummy. The dough had a wonderful aroma. They were melt-in-your-mouth delicious and the frosting really makes these cookies even more addictive and compliments the cookie perfectly. I love that this was an easy recipe to whip up. I made the frosting ahead of time following the directions to a T. I found it was a bit too runny so I left it to sit while the cookies baked up and cooled. By the time I was ready to frost, the consistency was a bit harder but perfect. Kinda like a sugar cookie frosting, soft on the inside with a semi-soft crust on top. I decorated mine with Christmas sprinkles and they looked so festive. Thanks for sharing!

My new favorite cookie with my two favorite things (coffee and chocolate).  I love these, as a sandwich cookie they are great to send to loved ones.  I used hazelnut coffee in the cookie and hazelnut syrup in the filling.  Orange or cinnamon would also be good variations.

I can best compare these to a subtly coffee-flavored shortbread.  I waited for the cookies to cool and piped the icing on top to make it a little neater and be sure teh chocolate flavor stayed on the cookie.  Delicious and different!  And a nice looking cookie for a tray.

If you like coffee, and I do, you'll love these crunchy little morsels. Except for needing extra milk in the frosting, I followed the cookie recipe, but had to leave the dough in the fridge overnight as I discovered too late that I didn't have enough powdered sugar for the frosting. The dough was too hard to work with until it sat out a short time. I don't have a small cookie scoop so had to improvise to make tiny 1/2 inch balls. "Button" is the perfect name for these. Next time I'll grind up the coffee more so the flecks won't be so noticeable.  The frosting: I can't tell you how much milk I added beyond what the recipe calls for.  It was just too thick. I left the pan sitting on the stove on warm as I was frosting the cookies.  I also took another's advice and added coffee to the frosting. I had plenty of frosting left over, maybe because we sampled too many ahead of time! I thinned out the extra and drizzled it over my Gingerbread Biscotti!

These are the bomb, everybody loves them!  Didn't change a thing on the cookie recipe, other than to crush the instant coffee in my hands, as other have suggested.  I used a mocha icing recipe from this site instead of the glaze, and they are soooooo good.

These are definitely a 5-star cookie!  They aren't overly sweet, and the chocolate glaze is perfect on them (I also sprinkled with chocolate jimmies and they looked really nice).  Like other reviewers, I crushed the coffee up a little before adding to the dough.  I refrigerated about half an hour.  Everyone I shared these with loved them!

Although mine flattened out and did not stay in cute little button shapes, y were "melt in your mouth" good and a really nice change from the ubiquitous shortbread.  Most of my friends were so surprised when they tasted the coffee.

Not bad. I baked these for some guests and they really loved them. I put sprinkles on mine and they looked so cute! I, however, did not care too much for them. They were a bit dry for me. I like really moist cookies. =3 However, everyone else loved them. Thanks!

Delicious cookie.  I did not have instant coffee but had instant espresso -the Medaglia D'Oro brand.  I figured that espresso is stronger than coffee so I used half as much to try to make it as similar to the original recipe.  I didn't have to crush down the granules, because the instant espresso is in pretty fine particles or powdery.  My icing wasn't as dark as those in the pictures, still tasted great though. I also had to play with the consistency as it does thicken when cooling.  So when you have it at the right spreading consistency don't walk away and work on laundry, vacuuming or computer work because you will miss that window of excellence!!
