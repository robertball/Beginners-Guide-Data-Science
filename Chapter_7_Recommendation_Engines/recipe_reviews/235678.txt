It was the previous reviewer’s mouthwatering photo of these biscuits that prompted me to get myself right into the kitchen this morning to make them.  It took me two tries.  The first time, they rose nicely and were perfectly shaped.  But they were waaay too overdone, even at the shorter baking time of 10 minutes.  Into the trash they went.  Not to be defeated by a simple biscuit mix recipe, I immediately hauled everything back out to make them again.  This time I set the oven temperature 25 degrees lower and the timer to just nine minutes.  They were better, but still more brown and crispy on the bottom than they should have been.  They were tasty enough, but somewhat on the tough side.  I was curious at this outcome, and even more so after a simple Google search revealed this is a common cinnamon biscuit recipe (think woman with the initials “BC” among the host of them).  I found mixed reviews all over which surprised me since this recipe is supposedly “tried and true” and has been around a long time.  (I found the only difference in submitter’s recipe was she calls for 1 tsp. of milk in the glaze, which wouldn’t have worked anyway, rather than BC’s recipe which calls for 1 T.)  Further, I found shortly after eating one, that it left a somewhat floury aftertaste.  These were average at best, and because I had to make biscuits twice just to have them result as only average, I’d merely call this an experiment.

Yes, these certainly were easy enough to make.  Unfortunately, I found them dry and rather tough after only 7 minutes baking, unlike a moist biscuit. If I were to make again, I'd also add a little salt to the biscuit mixture.  They hardly rise at all, so be sure to not roll out the dough too thinly, or you'll have something that looks more like a cookie rather than a biscuit.  Sorry, kzastrow, for the unfavorable review, but these were a bit of a disappointment in this house.

All I wanted was a simple cinnamon raisin biscuit.  This was exactly that, and it turned out great.  I  baked it at  425 degrees for around 12-15 minutes.  My icing was with milk instead of water.  My kids polished these off in minutes.
