Note to those that already tried this recipe and were disappointed:  If the cookies were too tough or cakey, try using less flour as instructed in the recipe.

We ended up throwing all but two cookies away.  The cookies were cakey and tasted terrible.  I would not recommend this recipe to anyone.

I made some changes to this recipe, and they came out GREAT! I used soy flour instead of regular flour (and 8 cups instead of 9), butter instead of shortening, added another 1/2 cup of buttermilk and an egg.     NOTE: If you want sweet molasses sugar cookies, you will not like these. This recipe will make soft, flavorful molasses cookies that are not too sweet. Taste the batter before you bake them. If you think it needs more sugar, add more.

A family favorite for generations. My grandma made a cut out cookie, placed a big old flattened raisin (hard to find nowadays)in the middle, then sprinkled with sugar, delicious. The first time I made them (I was in my 20s) and new to making cookies, I doubled the recipe and had cookies on every flat surface of my house. But all the neighbors couldn't get enough of them. Great recipe.

These are fantastic! You can adjust the time you bake them to make them full on chewy, crunchy on the outside/chewy on the inside or full out crunchy. The taste is wonderful! Highly recommend!

These were great. Not to strong of a molasses flavor which worked more in my favor than my husbands. I did not have to use all the flour stated. Just added a cup at a time until my dough was right consistency. I will make these again

Quite good and well liked by the family.  Lots of flavor.  To avoid too much of a 'cakey' texture, just added flour until the dough was workable (a little stiff, but still pretty moist) and didn't overmix.  Didn't cut, but the "golfball" size as recommended in the recipe made impressively big cookies.  I would probably go much smaller next time and flatten more.  Very soft and chewy.
