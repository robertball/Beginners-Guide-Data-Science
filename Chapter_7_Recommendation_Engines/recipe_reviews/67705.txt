For years I have made a hashbrown casserole with cheddar cheese and cream of chicken soup.  This is a kicked up - grown up - gotta have more version.  The flavor of the Asiago cheese is so strong and it where it gets crispy on the edges you will think you have expired from the pleasure.  I made for dinner with steaks.  If I were serving to guests though I think I would like to make them in individual dishes.  
They don't look very pretty when you lump them on the plate.

I don't know why this recipe isn't a 5-star recipe, it sure deserves to be!  We loved this and this is the only hash brown casserole recipe I will make from now on (who needs cream of chicken soup?)!  I did have to lighten up the recipe a bit - I used only 1/4 cup butter, half&half instead of heavy cream, and light sour cream.  Instead of white onion, I used a bunch of green onions for color.  The only asiago cheese I found at my store was a package of shredded asiago/parmesan blend.  It was perfect!  The ONLY think wrong with this recipe, as far as I can see, is that it says to season with salt and pepper after it's done baking.  I would highly recommend seasoning the mixture before it goes in the oven.  I stirred in  1/2 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. fresh ground black pepper.  They were not bland or greasy at all!

This dish has a delicious flavor, but the consistency seemed to be a little greasy and somewhat mushy. To rectify this on my second attempt, I eliminated the butter and heavy cream in favor of a second carton of sour cream, The onions were sauteed before adding to the mixture.And I used raw freshly grated potatoes that I parboiled to reduce the baking time. For a variation, add 1 cup Monterey Jack and 1/2 cup Cheddar in addition to the Asiago.Add 1/2 cup poppy seeds if your family likes them. Sprinkle top with Panko crumbs and bake. Yum!

I thought this was a good base recipe.  I made quite a few changes since I like a bit more color and flavor in my hash browns.  I sauteed the onions in the butter and added chopped red bell pepper and a couple cloves of garlic.  I also cut down the amount of cream to less then half.  It was pretty good with these changes.

It was OK. Sour cream gave it an unpleasant sour note and it also curdled during cooking, which didn't look good on a plate. I would've used only heavy cream and butter or even half-and-half to cut on calories and fat. Also after such a long cooking Asiago cheese lost almost all flavor, so it's not really worth spending money on it. I agree that Parmesan/Romano (or even some good sharp cheddar) would work in this dish as well. Asiago could be just sprinkled on top towards the end.

Very dry. I highly recommend using much more butter and sour cream. The asiago cheese is very costly. This works just as well with romano and parmasen mixed. If altered, this can be a great recipe, just keep in mind to be a litlle "heavy" on the butter and sour cream. For a quick trick, use chicken stock to add a little more "juice" to this recipe. Its low in carbs, inexpensive, adds flavor, and most likley you have this in your cabinet already!

The sharpness of the asiago is what makes this - I doubled the amount. However, the amounts of cream and butter make it very heavy, and for some reason the bottoms of these went soggy. I'm not quite sure where I went wrong...

I have made this recipe for years only with a few changes:  I use cheddar cheese although the Asiago sounds even better, I don't use the heavy cream or paprika, but best of all -- I add chopped green chilies to spice it up.  Everybody asks me for this recipe.

I agree, this is a definite step up from the "canned cream of..." version, and quicker than au gratin potatoes from scratch. Very tasty. My only change was to precook the onions in a little butter before adding, I prefer a mellower flavor.

I'm not a hash brown fan so it's no surprise I didn't care for this. Husband loves them though, and he wasn't overly impressed either. We thought it was really oily and sloppy. I won't be making this again. Sorry.

I really wanted to like this because I love hash browns but it was just really bland and dry, no flavor whatsoever. So disappointed :(

This was excellent. My frozen hash browns came in a 20 ounce bag, and I didn't measure exactly, but 5 ounces (by weight) of shredded asiago cheese was fine. It lacks color--next time I might add some snipped chives or green onions. Asiago gives it a sophistocated, adult taste.

I wanted to make this a little more kid friendly so I used cheddar instead of asiago.  It turned out wonderful and we ate it for breakfast with scrambled eggs.

I thought this recipe was great...made it for a brunch and everyone loved it.  I did make some changes, I used a 6 cheese Italian blend (including mozzarella, asiago, parmesan, romano, etc). I also had some fresh thyme and parsley and chopped that up in the mixture before baking.

I like this recipe but I did change it a little.  First I combined the grated cheese and chopped onion with the potatoes. I used a 4 cheese grated blend that I get from TJ's that has Asiago cheese in it. Then I mixed the sour cream, heavy cream and butter together before I folded it into the potatoes.

Delicious! I took this to a Christmas Eve Brunch potluck. Everyone loved it! Definitely a once in a while treat because of all the fattening ingredients, but so worth it, and much more special than the recipes that call for canned cream-of-whatever soup. I sauteed the onions in the butter first for those picky onion-haters and I also put some extra Asiago cheese on top and baked it until it got a little browned and crispy.

We felt this was a pretty bland recipe even with the addition of asiago cheese flavoring it.  I then tried it with the suggestion another reviewer shared... I used onion chip dip instead of the sour cream.  It was still on the bland side.. so maybe I'm just not a hash brown casserole person.

The flavor was good, but I'm a cheese freak so it's pretty hard for me not to like something that has cheese in it anyway! :)  I added some FRESH chopped basil, not dried. That was a great flavor boost.  There's only one thing I will change next time, because it was somewhat dry to me?  Maybe it's me, but I think I will add more cream or sour cream.  Other than that, good recipe! Thanks!

MY HUSBAND LOVED THIS. I FOUND IT TO BE A LITTLE SOUR TASTING, AND TOO PLAIN OF A TASTE FOR THE PRICEY CHEESE. NEXT TIME I WILL ADD OTHER CHEESES,PEPPER,GARLIC, AND WHATEVER ELSE I MIGHT HAVE IN THE FRIDGE.

This was a tasty dish! The only thing I would do different is saute the onions before mixing in with the rest of the ingredients. The crunchiness of the onion didn't mix well with the softer potatoes. Thank you for the recipe!

Very tasty!  An excellent variation of the Cheesy Hashbrown recipe that we've all grown tired of.  I made it with the shredded hash browns, but you could probably use the "southern style" cubed potatoes if you prefer.  I plan to serve this with Pork BBQ sandwiches at my son's 1st birthday party!

Pretty good stuff. I added my usual onion and garlic powders and also more cheese on top. Next time I may even throw on some bread crumbs. Thanks Linzi!

I made this for Christmas breakfast yesterday and everyone raved about them all morning, and want it added to our traditional breakfast. A real hit!  I cut back the onion a little just because of some  company’s personal tastes and didn't want to have to shred the Asiago on Christmas Eve so I used Trader Joe’s parmesan and asiago mix.  So easy and the Asiago flavor still came through. A keeper!  Oh, and cooking long enough to get that crust is a must.  Its absolutely the best part!

Made as written. Texture was broken and there was not enough hash browns so it tasted as if the hash browns were not the main part of the dish. It was rather bland and the cream gave this a sweetness that was off putting. Hash Browns we’re not fully cooked in the time and temp given.

Why anyone would give this less than five stars is beyond me.  We have served it at least a dozen times and always to rave reviews.  I have been asked for the recipe every single time.  It is especially good with ham, I think.  Don't understand the sour cream curdling - has never happened to me.  Totally yummy.

It was good.  I did spice it up abit - Green onions, green chilies, chopped jalapeno, doubled the sour cream and used jalapeno dip for 1/2 the sour cream - no heavy cream.   Could not find the cheese listed so I used colby jack,and Italian pizza blend.  It was very good but I thought next time I would add cooked chopped bacon.  Yum

I added more onion, more asiago ( 2+ cups), and a generous amount of paprika.  Go light on the salt because the cheese and sour cream will add saltiness.

Fantastic. Along with Asiago, I added some pecorino romano. Also added some panko. As others suggested, I sauteed the onions and added minced garlic cloves, and substituted French onion dip for sour cream. Good suggestions all. Will definitely make again.

I was looking for a gluten and soy free recipe that did not involve canned soup, crackers or cereal.  This is amazing and you will not be disappointed or deprived. I didn't have sour cream on hand so I substituted Greek yogurt (Greek Gods full fat). I will definitely make again and it is safe for those with allergies.

quite tasty, but asiago cheese might be a bit too strong... maybe mix asiago with a mozzarella or maybe a Gouda?

It was good, but the Asiago cheese didn't make it that much better to be worth the extra expense.

great way to use up the asiago cheese, but I wouldn't go out and buy the cheese specifically for this.  Tastey.

Very good, asiago cheese is pricey, but a change was nice.  I will probably sautee the onions next time, they were too crispy for my taste.

The flavor of this was very good, but it was a little too mushy for our tastes.  I was trying to think of a way around that, but unless you put them in small shallow bowls to cook it I think it would turn out the same way.  It was also very rich ~ not something to make on a regular basis.
