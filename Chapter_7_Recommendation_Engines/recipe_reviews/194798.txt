The chocolate referred to in the recipe is the white confectioners' coating. Although they are slightly different, i.e. white chocolate is made with cocoa butter and confectioner's coating is made with vegetable fats. Some people use them interchangeably in certain recipes, especially if it is being used for coating. I think they say the confectioners' coating melts better than the white chocolate itself. Hope this helps! :)

Fun to make. I also use Starburst jellybeans. Sometimes, I even use a little red food die to make the coating pink and used the Red Fruits Starbursts for a Valentine's Day/Breast Cancer fundraiser, broken into bits and portioned out into see-through gift bags and tied with a pink ribbon. My kids especially love to make this. VERY sweet.

Instead of pouring the chocolate onto a jelly roll pan, I decided to try something different.  I put 4 jelly beans into an egg mold and then spooned the coating around them.  What I ended up having was jellybean eggs.  I think the kids will love these at our family Easter celebration.

This is so easy and so much fun to do!  It's a great addition to Easter baskets.  I used Starburst jelly beans, put these into clear treat bags and tied them with pretty bows using all different colored wire ribbon.  This recipe is a definite keeper for future Easters!

Oh this was soo much fun!!! I used my Perfect Brownie Pan, line the pan with foil, then pour in the melted almond bark, then put in the divider and added my jelly beans. Put in the refrigerator and I popped them out when then they were cool, I will so do this again like this, because they were just perfectly uniform and soo pretty.

This was surprisingly excellent! I never buy confectioners coating, but when I found this recipe I bought it to try this. I used a fruity mix of Jelly Belly jellybeans. You can easily adjust this recipe to make as much or as little as you need. It really had a great flavor. I will be making this again in the future.......thanks Christina!

So quick and easy to make, looked great and tasted wonderful too.  I did not have jellybeans so used M&M eggs as a sub.  Thank you for sharing Christina!

Fun and Festive! I loved the simiplicity of it, but somehow it really looks impressive and inviting to eat! I did one batch of white bark with jelly beans and another batch of chocolate bark with easter M&Ms. Both looked great and were a hit. **I used Jolly Ranchers flavored jelly beans and they were good...but I missed some of the colors other brands offer. That's the thing to keep in mind... get a wide variety of colors for the best presentation. Still worked well though!

Love it! Very easy to make and fun to assemble with kids :)  Used Ghiradhelli White Chocolate Bars (about 5 for smaller cookie sheet) - and chose Starbust jelly beans.

This is such a tasty and cute idea! My little sister really enjoyed pressing the jellybeans into the white chocolate, and she enjoyed eating it even more! All of my little siblings (as well as their neighbor friends!) loved it so much that it was gone in less than an hour! Thanks so much, Christina, for sharing this cute recipe! This is a keeper!

This was fun!  I made mine with pink melting disks and used a mini muffin pan.  I used mini jellybeans, too.  If I make these again, I’ll try to keep the thickness to about 1/4 inch.  Thicker than that and they’re a little hard to bite into.  Thanks Christina!

I have to admit - I'm not a fan of white chocolate, but this is just a brilliant idea. I did 2 batches - one w/ white chips and jelly beans, and 1 w/ "Special dark" chips and Easter M&Ms. They were both gorgeous and so yummy!!! It was funny watching the big burly men chowing down on such a dainty treat. A tip - if you want to use real white chocolate chips, put all the chips minus 1/4 cup in a bowl, nuke at 50% power in 30 second bursts...stirring in between. When it's smooth and creamy, add the last 1/4 cup chips and stir like mad!! This will keep it from melting from the heat of your hand after it's cooled. I can't wait to do this for halloween with orange and black beans!!

Very yummy.  I couldn't find and white confectioner's coating, so I used white chocolate instead and it turned out fine.

Jellybeans are one of my favorite candies.  I love Easter time when all of the different varieties are in the stores.  So when came across this recipe, I couldn't wait to try it. I decided to go with jellybeans that would have a litte more tartness than the really sweet ones to add some contrast with the white chocolate.  I made these in a paper lined mini muffin tin to make them already individual size.  The kids and I loved these and you can really play around with the flavors with all of the different jellybeans out now.

This recipe makes for such a CUTE NOVELTY TREAT!  With our family Easter egg hunt coming up soon, I experimented a little bit.  I used a metal cookie cutter, which I heated with a hair dryer, to cut through the white chocolate.  The jelly beans had to be placed carefully to be sure they would be in the area desired.  Any coating not used was remelted.  After a taste test, I am sure the kids are going to love them.  Thank you Christina for sharing such a CUTE NOVELTY TREAT!

I don't really like white chocolate/almond bark, but this recipe was too cute not to make!! I added the zest of one lemon to my melted chocolate (which I do love!) and topped with Sassy Sour Jelly Belly beans. It was so tasty and adorable! Thanks for a fun recipe idea!

Too sweet.  Looked really cute, but couldn't give it away.  Next time will add in bits of pretzel to add some salt.

Simple, easy, fun! I made thick ones with the perfect brownie pan -- people literally had to eat the square in moderation, but they were enjoyed! I used the white chocolate with tart jelly beans and then the chocolate bark with M&Ms.

I made this as the Recipe Group recipe for the week of March 22nd. EDIT: I made this again this year, only this time I used Ghirardelli white chocolate bars, which I melted in a nonstick pot on the lowest heat setting on my stove top, stirring constantly. Still used Starburst jelly beans -- they still look to be the best option out of a bad lot at the grocery store, but I digress. I still find that 1 pound of chocolate didn't stretch all the way across the pan and would double or triple it next time if using a jellyroll pan. This year I scored lines into the candy where I want it to break instead of just leaving that up to fate, because didn't do me any favors with the shapes last year. This is a SUPER cute idea & I wish I'd thought to buy candy molds this year! Thanks again, Christina!

This is outstanding and couldn't be easier! I used Brach's Sour Jelly Bird Eggs (flavors such as watermelon, raspberry, etc).  I don't like jelly beans at all, but with the sweet of the chocolate and sour fruity flavor of the jelly beans, I loved it.  When I bought my white chocolate melting discs at the candy supply store, they told me they melt their chocolate for dipping and bark by melting it in the oven at 170 degrees! So I put parchment paper on my cookie sheet, put the discs evenly on the sheet and melted the chocolate (170degrees for 15 minutes) took it out, put the jelly beans on top and then used Easter sprinkle that contained the same colors as the jelly beans which helped fill in some of the white areas.  I plan to make this every Easter from now on; other adults who don't like jelly beans also loved it! Thanks for sharing such a fun recipe!

Yum!!! I used Brach's sour jelly beans and they were just perfect against the sweet white bark. This stuff is addicting! My hubby took a gallon Ziploc of it to work with him and he said it disappeared! Thanks Christina!!! :)

The adults in the family rated this 10 stars. Like others I used white chocolate chips and melted in the microwave.  Verty cute and seasonal to be sure, definitely an eye popper on a holiday table.

I think this is such a great idea! Fast and easy! I made this to go in my boys' easter baskets and they really loved it. I used sour jelly beans to kind of balance out the super sweet white chocolate. I really liked this too and I'm not a huge white chocolate fan. I think I might have spread my white chocolate too thin though because a lot of the jellybeans popped out.

I made this with my DS.  I gave him the kitchen scale so he could measure out the ingredients.  We mixed 2 kinds if starburst jellybeans and used exactly a pound.  We also used 1 lb of Wilton Cabdy melts which is just shy of 1 1/2 bags.  I melted the candy in a double boiler since I prefer that method to the microwave.  DS spread a thin layer of candy melts onto a foil lined jellyroll pan.  The candy melt layer was 1/8 inch or less.  The jellybeans were the smaller size which I think works best since the candy melt layer is thin and probably wouldn't hold large jellybeans well.  The refrigeration time was much less than an hour.  We had no trouble breaking the bark into pieces.  It turned out quite cute.  Cuter than I expected.  DS loved it and so did DH.  so family gave it an A+.  Will make it part of our Easter traditions.  Thanks Christina for the fun recipe. :-)

Ok....seriously ....my 4 yr old made this with me and had a blast with the jellybeans. I bought a pound of homemade white chocolate melting pieces at my local candy barn. I am normally not a white chocolate fan....but I had to try it and really liked it....gave as gifts to family and friends.  Very festive. Thanks!

VERY EASY! I used Starbust jelly beans, almost the whole bag and the white coating. Very good, and I only had to refg it for 30mins and it was done. I'm making it for my daughters teachers!!!

This is such a cute idea.  Instead of coloring eggs we made candy!  I bought gourmet jelly beans that came in a wide array of colors and the little ones had a ball.  I personally found it too sweet, but the under 8 yr old crowd gave it unanimous thumbs up.

terrific idea, I did it to use up some Easter candy, used milk chocolate on the bottom, sprinkled jelly beans and Easter candy corn on top, then drizzled yellow chocolate over the whole thing. I am sure it will be a big hit with my son's hockey team!

I did this a bit differently.  I put liners in a minicupcake pan (got this idea from the pictures) then I dropped a small mini twist pretzel in the bottom.  I melted the white chocolate, poured it on top, and then put jelly beans on top.  The salty sweet is delish!

Great recipe.  DO NOT use Starburst Jelly Beans!!  They are pure chuncks of sugar.  They crunch of sugar in your mouth.   Many good brands of Jelly Beans.  I used a few drops of Lemon Oil to cut the sweet taste.

This was sooo easy to make! I just finished these for a bake sale at our elementary school. Absolutely adorable! I doubled the recipe & spread it all out on a half sheet pan(approx. 17x13). Perfect!

Excellent and so easy!  I used white chocolate chips I melted in the microwave which made prep easier.  This will be a standby for Easter going forward!

Surprisingly good.  All the kids loved this!  So easy too.  I tried some with choc bark- not so great.  Def stick with the white choc.  I alos did some with PB MnMs and the jellybean ones (starburst) were the best.  I even made a few in some egg molds- really cute for Easter and some others in a lined mini muffin pan.  Very sweet though so a little goes a long way.

Cleaver, fun, and easy to make.  I made a half batch of this colorful candy using Jolly Rancher (R) jellybeans.  This would also be a fun thing to make using M&M's, candy corn, Sixlets, Skittles, etc.  White chocolate and colorful candies - thanks for sharing Christina.

Easy to make. I melted almond bark in the microwave. I used about 1.5 pounds and it filled the 11x17 pan. The 1:1 ratio should be upped to include more coating in my opinion, otherwise I would have had too many jelly beans.

This was SO super easy to make and yummy!  I melted a large bag of white chocolate chips and used the Jelly Belly jellybeans.  This is a great recipe for kids to help with sprinkling the candies:) Thanks for such an easy and unique recipe!

I'm confused about this confectioners coating. I used white bark. Not sure if thats the same thing or not.?!? I made this last night for a party. I figured I would make something just for the 8 kids that were here. They all gobbled it up. A couple of the adults tried it and weren't that keen therefore, I can't give it 5 stars. But it was very easy to make and a very cute idea.

Well this is VERY sweet!  I used a bag of white chocolate chips, melted it in the microwave, and then added whole almonds to my chocolate before I poured it out on a wax paper lined cookie sheet.  Worked just great!  I added about 1/2 a bag of jelly beans and stuck it in the freezer for maybe 10 minutes.  Doesn't get  more simple than that, but I next time I might add some pretzel pieces too.

This does turn out pretty, but waaay to sweet. I'll stick to making white chocolate and/or candy melts with something salty like pretzels.
