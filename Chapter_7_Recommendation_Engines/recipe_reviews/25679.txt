Needed more salt, spices, barley. It was an O.K. recipe, but nothing memorable.

This recipe is very good! I was concerned that the stew beef would be tough, but it wasn't. About the only thing I would change is to add more stew beef to it. Otherwise It has an excellent flavor!

I had really good luck with this recipe!I used more beef broth and less water. I threw a few sliced fresh mushrooms in and used a bagged shredded cabbage for ease. We liked it the first time and the leftovers were awesome. I did double the caraway...I like the flavor it makes!

Amazing! This was the first time I cooked with barley or made a stew and my whole family loved it!!  I will most defintely make this again.  Next time I would add some cayenne pepper and coriander to spice it up a notch.

My family loved this!  I did make a couple of minor changes.  I used 1 can of diced tomatoes, including the juice. Instead of all that water, I used one can of water (from the tomatoes)and one box of 32oz beef broth, instead of the two 14 oz cans.  I also used Canneli beans, as that is what I already had in the house.  Oh' and I omitted the caraway seeds.  I served this with some warm dark rye bread and real butter.  YUMMY!  My husband hates cabbage but he ate it in this stew!

Wow this was amazingly good.  Really easy for one thing.  We don't have Great Northern beans here in Australia as far as I know so did a search on them & since they are a white bean I figured cannelloni beans would do.  So I did the soak them overnight method rather than use cans.  (have the rest in the freezer)  Anyway made the soup pretty much as is except no carraway seeds cos I didn't have any.  Will find some for next time though.  This is a hearty soup & tomorrows left overs should be better of course!  Can't wait!  :-)  Oh & I didn't use a really cheap stewing meat either cos DH doesn't like  meat so used some a bit better & it cooked up beautifully.  A must recipe for winter!  Will make again for sure.  Oh & for the non meat eaters you can do it as easily without the meat in it & use vegetable stock instead.  I think it would be as good.  & save some money too!  Put in a couple more potatoes & carrots & you'd be set with a great vegie meal.

This recipe is a keeper.  Here are the modifications that I made: 28 ounce can of diced tomatoes and less water, closer to 1/2 cup of barley, a 19 ounce can of beans (I've used different kinds), 1/2 teaspoon of oregano, 1/2 basil, 1/2 rosemary and no caraway seeds.

My eight year old didn't like this, but everyone else did.  Substituted V8 for the tomatoes and some of the water.  Also doubled up on the spices after reading the other reviews.  I put it all in the crockpot and thickened it up at the end with a roux.  Not a bad change from my regular stew.

This was delicious with some minor changes. I doubled all of the spices except for the caraway seeds (kept those at 1/4 tsp) and omitted the salt. I didn't have any cabbage so I used celery instead. And I only had one can of beef broth, so I used chicken broth also. I used 1.5 cups of water and for the rest of the liquid I used chicken broth. With my changes I think it is five stars. Thank you for sharing!

We loved this stew!  It was just a little bland, so here are the changes I made:  I doubled the spices (pepper, oregano, basil, rosemary, and caraway).  I used a full cup of barley and added enough water to compensate.  I used pre-shredded cabbage, about 2 c. packed. Then all I did was brown the beef and onion together, then tossed everything else in a (large) crockpot and cooked it on low all day.  Super easy and turned out great!  I also added a can of garbanzo beans just for fun.  My husband and I both think that a can of sweet corn would be a great addition as well -- I'm adding that next time.  It's a keeper!

Very good flavor... the broth is heavenly! I think I'll include some frozen mixed vegetables next time I make it for a little more color and variety. Also more barley. But otherwise it's awesome!

Very good, hearty cross between a soup and a stew. I added some more of the listed spices and salt as other reviewers suggested but left out the carraway seeds since I didn't have any on hand. I also added a can of Cannellini beans. The only big differences for me was after bringing the soup/stew to a boil, I had to let it simmer for twice the said time. My husband and I really enjoyed this.

This was great - a hit with the whole family on a cold winter night. I used  dark turkey meat instead of beef and it was excellent. I also made a few changes. I used two cups of diced tomatoes, and a half a cup of barley, both of which added to the stew a lot. I also ommited the caraway seeds. If you want a really hearty stew, cook it at least an hour.
Thanks, Brandy!

I prepared everything and dumped it into a crock pot for 1 1/2 hours.  Great tasting broth.  Do not know if I added to much cabbage - (didn't think so) but it stood out above all the other ingredients.   Would I repeat the recipe? Maybe

It's a good recipe - especially when you are down to a couple of carrots and potatoes in the frige. I did add a lot more herbs than it called for. I left out the caraway seeds and used Italian sausage instead of beef which gave it more of a Mediterranean taste.

Just what I was looking for! 

Some changes of course; I used ground beef instead of cubed, since I already had some. I also tripled the barley and used pearl barley instead of quick cooking (whatever that is). And I used whole peeled tomatoes (still from a can). I expect it's not quite what everyone would do, but I love love looked it. Highly recommended and I suspect I'll be making it again soon.

Very tasty recipe.  I used a can of mixed beans instead of great northern beans, and couldn't find quick-cooking barley, so par-boiled pot barley before adding.  Next time I would use 2 lbs. of meat.  I cooked for about an hour and 20 minutes to get the meat nice and tender, and reduce the liquid.

This was a very easy, very tasty recipe, though I'd call it a hearty soup rather than a stew. I made four significant substitutions, and it still worked out well. I'll definitely try the original another time. I didn't have stew beef on hand, so I used a well-trimmed pork tenderloin (cheaper here than beef). I used a can of butter beans instead of great northern beans, and I used 1/4 tsp whole cumin and 1/8 tsp cayanne pepper instead of the rosmary and caraway. Good!

As written, this is pretty bland.  By adjusting (almost doubling) the spices, it can be made into a spectacular stew though.  I enjoyed it a lot.

Great basic recipe, with lots of room in it for modifications to suit one's taste. Although I roughly halved the recipe [it's just the two of us],  I doubled the meat, added beef flavored "Better Than Bullion" to the low sodium can of chicken broth I had, and added 8 oz of light beer instead of water. I did not have cabbage or potatoes, so I left out the caraway seeds. I did add 1 T red pepper flakes to give it a kick & 1 small bay leaf.  I added minced celery and finely chopped asparagus stalks [the portion people throw away- we don't like to waste anything].  Browned the meat and saute the veggies lightly on the stove in oil, then cooked the stew in slow cooker for 5 hrs on low, ADDING the instant barley & 1/3 can of drained corn the last 30 minutes.  Served this with zucchini cornbread.
This is a wonderful comfort food on a cold fall day and I'm certain it will warm up well as leftovers for work tomorrow.

Excellent! Doubled the barley, added a can of corn, didn't use cabbage, but celery instead. Also added 1 poblano pepper. Didn't have a potato, but wish I did. It was great and will make it over and over again!

Excellent flavor! I didn't have any caraway seeds but this recipe is a keeper!

I would have given it a much higher rating if it didn't have the caraway. It was too overpowering for my familiy's taste. I might try it again without it.

This stew was flavorful.  I liked it the only thing is the meat did not come out very tender. Other than that a good stew.
