My mother has been making this cake since I was a small girl with one difference. The purpose for heating the pineapple is so that you can poke holes in the cake with a fork and pour the hot pineapple over cake. Moist!!! Then you cool and add other ingredients. (Use Pecans instead of walnuts)

This is a delicious cake that I've made many times. I really recommend that you poke holes on top of the cake when it comes out of the oven before you pour the crushed pineapple mixt. on top. Then let it cool before spreading the rest of the ingredients (otherwise, you have a sloppy mess). Also, the coconut is best when it's toasted lightly before sprinkling on top.

This cake was absolutely delicious. I am not a big cake fan, however this one had me begging for more.

My recipe is very similar, except that when I cook the pineapple, I only use 1/4 c. sugar and 2 T. cornstarch to thicken it.  I use 2 pkg. vanilla instant pudding, 3 c. milk and 1 8 oz. pkg. cream cheese.  I also do not use bananas or coconut.  When I used to take this to work for a retirement party, it was the first one to be gone.  The men would be mad at me if I didn't make it.

This makes a great summer dessert.  Sweet, but not too heavy or filling.  Everyone liked it and I will make again.  I toasted the coconut for the topping.  Also, I reduced the amount of milk in the pudding to 1.5 cups instead of 2 for a thicker pudding.

Our family loves this cake, But we like it more simplified. I omit the bannana,coconut(I like coconut but my family doesn't) and nuts. It is a hit everywhere we bring it.

I'm a hit-or-miss cook, so when I decided to try a new cake recipe for my boyfriend's birthday I was worried.  We were too stuffed from dinner to try it that night. Later he said he and his daugher loved it and he took it to work and within minutes it was gone!  I never got to try this cake for myself, but I'm making it for Fathers Day and by golly- I'll save some for myself!

I made this cake for Christmas and it was a hit for the whole family!  Awesome tasting cake, then I made a second 2 days later.  Easy and quick....I did reduce the sugar because if you use sweetened pineapples (canned), a little sweet.  I highly recommend!

I made this along with a chocolate version for a bridal luncheon, both were wonderful selections. Everyone loved them,  especially this one. This would also be a perfect Springtime dessert! A keeper and very easy.

This is so good. It taste like a banana split sundae. I also poked holes in the cake and I used french vanilla pudding and cake mix. I also added some sliced cherries on top of the bananas. This cake just kept growing as I assembled it. It was huge so there will be plenty to share with neighbors and coworkers.

I love this cake!!! I altered it some. Instead of regular whipped cream, I used the vanilla flavored cool whip.  I'm not much of a banana fan so I sliced them ultra thin, only used one and can barely taste them.  I also used the 5 oz. box of pudding.  I advise to let sit overnight before eating so it will become extra moist, although I dug into mine after 3 hrs to ensure it was cold. Great summer recipe, great for people who don't like icing. I will definitely make this a part of my holiday meal from now on!!!

This cake made an awful mess. The cake I baked was slightly rounded on top, by the time I tried to put all the toppings on, it was running off the sides. Also, recipe said to cook pineapple and sugar 5 minutes, this still had a lot of juice. which tried to run out over the top of the pan when poured over cake. If mixture was supposed to be thickened, that's what the instructions should have said. This cake can definitely not be made in a pan that has a lid to go over it for transport. I will never make this mess again.

The cake is good but its bland.  I was hoping for a richer more decadent cake given the name.  I thought the pineapple would provide it.  If I make it again I'll make some changes to try and find a yummier taste.  1.  The bananas are not good.  They turn brown and slimy and do not keep well if the cake is not eaten right away.  2.  The pudding is bland and does nothing for the cake so I won't use it again.  In its place I want to try and find a cream cheese filling to place on top of the pineapple.  3. I might try brown sugar instead of white with the pineapple. 4. Use pecans. 5. Toast the coconut.  I think with some changes this cake can become "better than sex"  :)  But not with this recipe.

This is a 5 Star IF you poke holes in the cake and pour the warm pineapple/sugar mixture over the top.  Allow to cool before spreading the pudding and the other ingredients.

This cake was a big hit at my quilting guild luncheon!  I keep the ingredients on hand so I'm ready to prepare a quick and delicious desert with wonderful feedback from everyone asking for the recipe.
