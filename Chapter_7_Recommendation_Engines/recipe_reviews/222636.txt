Not quite spicy enough. I would add red pepper flakes or cayenne pepper to the spices. Also would double the spices and let the chicken marinate in them for an hour or so.

I love this recipe! I've made it twice with the pork ribs. I've also made the sauce for chicken and pork chops (and I've tried it with sugar free orange marmalade and it worked for us. Highly recommend that you try!

We enjoyed this recipe.  I only used about 1 1/2 lbs of ribs for my husband and I but made the sauce as recipe states. I didn't measure ingredients, I just estimated the amounts.

I followed the recipe to a T and thought these were flavorless.

My Very picky wife liked it! A LOT! I did make 2 changes (sorry). No rice wine so I used rice wine vinegar & the thought of CUMIN appealed to me so I added about 1/4 tsp. I halved the recipe (there's just the 2 of us) & used boneless ribs. They were done in less than 1 1/2 hrs. Fork tender, YUMMMM!

I followed the recipe exactly and this was one of the blandest things I have ever cooked.

Did this up in my slow cooker while we were doing things around the house.  Dee-lish!
