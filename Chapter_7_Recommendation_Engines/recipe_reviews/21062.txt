My mother used to make this for us, for sandwiches.  Instead of salad dressing, she used mayo & mixed everything up the same.  I, also, have been feeding this to my family for years.  It's just so good & great on crackers too.

Oh wow!  I thought my grandmother was the only one to make this stuff.  If my dad and I are visiting at the same time, you'll always find one of us sneaking to the kitchen to get a bit of it.  I've tried to duplicate it but still have never gotten it right.  She uses Miracle Whip thinned with a teeny bit of milk, and just chops up sweet pickles while processing the bologna and eggs.  I have a container of it in my fridge right now.  This may sound strange, but the best way to eat this in a sandwich is with a few potato chips right in there with the bologna salad.

My grandma used to make this several times a year by the buckets full! It never lasted because we ate it all in a short amount of time.  Don't use the sliced bologna. Use a ring bologna that isn't pickled. I use mayo and mix half with sweet relish and the other half with dill. I don't bother with the eggs. That's too much. Sandwich spread should be simple. Just the three ingredients and it's perfect! Slice eggs on your individual sandwich with mustard but you wouldn't put bologna on an egg salad sandwich would you? : )

I grew up with this stuff!  Though for some strange reason, we called it ham salad and not a touch of ham in sight!  My mother and grandmother (and me) use sweet gherkin pickles and a bit of onion in addition to the remaining ingredients.  My own sons love it and it disappears whenever I get the urge to make it!  Which just might have to be now...

I think Dutchgirl missed it.  The recipe says "with desired amount of creamy salad dressing and desired amount of sweet pickle relish".  It doesn't say add the whole jar!  We prefer Miracle Whip dressing.  This, too, is one of my favorites my mom made in the 50's, and my kids and grandkids love it as well.

This is one of my most favorite comfort foods from childhood. Grandma used to make this with Canadian bologna (there's nothing like Canadian bologna, I've never found anything like it here in the States), her own chicken's eggs,  Best Foods mayo and her own homemade hot pickles. She also added a couple shakes of pepper. I make it pretty much the same way only with the store deli bologna and zesty pickles. I really like it spread on saltines but it's pretty much good on anything. It's really simple to make and it stretches quite well for those on a budget but need cold lunches during the week.

I was lured in by the childhood nostalgia factor here and ended up regretting it.  The recipe didn't work on several levels.  For us, there was too much relish - it almost added a bitter edge to the flavor even without using an entire cup.  We also didn't use anywhere near 16 ounces of salad dressing, probably less that half that amount, and we still found it a little too much.   This seemed to leave a bad aftertaste as well. This isn't horrible, but if this were on a buffet table, it's the kind of thing you'd try on a cracker and think, "well, that was kind of funky" and then you'd move on to the thousand other things that taste better than this.  Sorry, but this is one that I just can't recommend.

This stuff is the best!! Reminds me of growing up as a kid, although we get the thicker bologna and julienne it instead of turning everything smooth. Good as just a salad that way really, overall it's pretty darn good! Very similar to what the local deli makes, which I used to buy before finding this recipe, thanks for sharing.

I haven't tried making this because I have my own recipe, but I just thought i'd say that this has been a family favorite passed down for generations. The recipe that I have was passed down to my great great mother from her mother..so its old. We call ours Balogna Salad as well, but our recipe calls for a mixture of bologan and ham both. We  use miracle whip, onions, and cheese in it as well. Its best to get your meats and cheese from the deli in chunks..it grinds better and gives it a better overall taste. The mixture of bologna and ham balance each other and the taste isn't to strong..if that makes sense. My family makes this for many Holidays and then of course for baby showers, birthday parties, and so on. Just wanted to add that this is an all time favorite.

I've been making this spread for 55 years now.  And my Mom made it all her married years too.
It was my Husbands favorite sandwich to take when we'd go fishing.  I used Helmans Mayo and sweet pickle relish and just a dash of yellow mustard in mine....just as Mom did.  Good eating!!!!

Yum!  I'd never heard of bologna salad until I saw it for sale at a lunch counter.  They were out that day, so I decided to find a recipe.  Very yummy!  I scaled it down for one person, which by the recipe's servings is 12...very odd.  I rough chopped instead of grinding.  I also chopped a dill pickle spear instead of using sweet relish because I was out.

I make this all of the time...but no salad dressing, eggs or relish. To get the best taste, use real mayo, sweet baby pickles and some onion.  If you need to give a little sweeter flavor, add a little pickle juice.

This tasted pretty good but I felt like it was missing something. Next time I'm going to add some shredded cheese and see how that goes.

My mother made this for us growing up, and I still make today.  We grind the balogna, add the eggs, diced celery, diced onion and sweet relish and miracle whip.  Can't get any better than that.

Like every one else my Mother and Grandmother made this all the time to feed men who came to help on the farm.  Everyone who worked for my Dad would ask if there were going to be ham salad sandwiches for afternoon coffe.  We also called it ham salad and I don't know why.  Thank you so much for reminding me of that great time and the recipe is just like theirs.

My family is from Indiana and we made this "ham salad" at least once a month.  It was my job to run the big block of bologna through the hand-cranked meat grinder.  I buy my bologna at the deli counter and grind it myself with a grinder I recently found on eBay.  Delicious for snacking and lunch boxes!

Good Sandwich Spread.. Thought there was a little to much pickle relish.  Next time will try 1/2 cup or 2/3 cup... or possibly drain the juice better.

This is very similar to what I love to eat in Germany when I visit family. It's a popular spread for the hard rolls called Fleischsalat (meat salad). Yummy!!!

This is exactly like sandwich spread you would get from you grocery deli. I buy 2in thick cut bologna from the deli and then grind it in my meat grinder. Add mayo and sweet relish and it is delish! Sometimes i add a pinch of sugar to even out the saltiness. 1 cup sweet relish is way too much, I just eye everything!

It's a classic!  I used all the same ingredients and followed your reccomendation of adding for taste.  I didn't have a meat grinder either, so I used my quickchef.  I think an electric blender would work too.  Thanks!

My Mom made a version of this back in the 50's but she would use Vienna sausages instead of baloney.  I made this for my kids and grandkids and will try it on my great grands when they get older.

This is a good recipe. But it need celery , onions,and  black pepper added to the mix. On the sandwich it is good with some lettuce and a slice of cheese. This is how I have all ways made it.

This is definitely one of my families favorites -- every summer family gathering we would have this.  And as one review wrote --add the potato chips onto the sandwich.  Thank you for posting it.  One note, if you don't have a meat grinder, my sister used a shredder (we buy the bologna in a chunk) and it worked really well).  At our recent family reunion, it was gone like the wind.  Love the hard boiled egg method-- will definitely try it and make pickled eggs with it too.

My mom made this when I was growing up.  She didn't put eggs in it, but addedd shredded cheddar cheese.  We always loved it.  She said it was a cheaper version of ham salad.

My grandmother used to make it all the time. She always added Onion and about 2 Tablespoons of Peanut Butter (weird I know). Also she used regular mayo instead of the salad dressing. It was always a Family Favorite!

OMGoodness, I had forgotten about this recipe.  I really like to add a small amount of onion and pepper.  It doesn't usually need salt because of the salty bologna.  Thanks, I love this on crackers too!

I've made this before but my recipe called for cheese, too. I was looking for something similar when I found this one. So, I added the cheese. Good!

This was not terribly well received among my friends.  One said it tasted like potted meat.  My husband didn't care for it at all.  I won't be making again.

I was raised on bologna salad....we used a meat grinder to grind the bologna and also used dill pickles, put through the grinder as well. My mom didn't like mayo so she used Miracle Whip. I don't like Miracle Whip so I use Duke's Mayonnaise.....Never had it with eggs in it, though.......My number one comfort food!!!!

Like many others on here, it was always called 'Ham Salad' in our house ... maybe it's a regional terminology thing or something; I'm originally from Western PA/Pittsburgh area, not sure about the others). This recipe is similar to what I've been making for 50 years, as did my Mother and Grandmother before me, but this recipe is way too heavy on the relish and a bit heavy on the salad dressing/ Mayo as well (Mom used Miracle Whip, I use Mayo).  My family recipe also calls for onion and a just smidge of good old fashioned yellow mustard.  I always use Deli Bologna bought as a whole piece then chunk it to run it through the grinder ... The hard boiled eggs, the relish, and the onion all get run through the grinder too, which makes for a nice even grind for the Ham Salad.  So, add some onion, a dab of yellow mustard, cut back on the relish and salad dressing, and you'll have a winner.

This is comfort food from childhood.  The appearance takes some tolerance, but it's amazing. 

I make it slightly differently and find I like it better.  I use mayo and dill relish in place of the Miracle Whip and sweet relish to cut down on the sugar.  I love it.

Used to  eat this every summer vacation up to Okoboji!! Fareway grocery store used to sell it in their deli, now they sell ham salad which tastes similar, but not quite the same. I've never had it with boiled eggs, but will throw it in just to try. Great to see this recipe online and love the memories associated with the dish. Thanks for posting!

P.S. I use an old meat grinder to get the same texture to the bologna, which matters in my opinion. ;o)

06.30.17 ~ Finding a package of ring bologna in the freezer, I decided to turn it in to Bologna Salad.  This was a good recipe choice.  My one change was to use dill relish rather than sweet as we don't care for sweet relish.  We enjoyed this with crackers and on toast for a sandwich.  A nice change for something different and I used up a package of meat from the freezer.  Win-Win

I like both egg salad and bologna sandwiches but never thought of putting them together.  I cut up the bologna first and then fried it before adding it to the mixture.

Like everyone else this has been around for a long time and is absolutely wonderful if you like bologna. This is one of those recipes you have to make your own. I prefer dill relish, additional boiled eggs, and more Bologna. This is also a wonderful recipe for ham salad.

Pretty good. Reminds me of when I was a kid. I adored ham salad and sometimes my mother would make it out of bologna. 

I processed mine a little finer than what appears in the picture. I actually didn't mean to, I wanted it a little chunkier, but my food processor has a mind of its own and decided to pulverize it within a matter of seconds. So it's more like smooth spread than a chunky spread. But the taste is still delicious. Going to take a bologna salad sandwich with me to work tomorrow.

Just be careful when reading the recipe. "Desired amount" of salad dressing and "desired amount" of pickle relish should probably be up there in the ingredient list because it appears a few peeps assumed you use a whole jar of dressing and whole cup of relish. This is not the case, as stated in the instructions. Unless, of course, you like it that way ;)

I used light Miracle Whip and turkey bologna, as I watch fat and calories.

I used a 12 oz package of bologna and changed the recipe accordingly. I added a little bit of onion too. Maybe a little too much relish. I'll add less next time. All in all not bad.

Wow! I am so happy I found this recipe. I grew up with my grandma throwing bologna, onion and relish in a hand grinder and then mixing with mayo instead of dressing...cant wait  to make it!
