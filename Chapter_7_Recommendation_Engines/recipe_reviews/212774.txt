it would help to hang the yougurt overnight instead of just for 2-3 hours.  Traditional Gujurati shrikhand is very thick, and I found that it was still a bit watery after hanging for 3 hrs, esp if you have to add 2tbsp milk with the saffron

I found this recipe while looking for saffron uses.  I made it because it sounds like a hit just by reading the recipe.  If you leave out the saffron and use green food coloring instead of yellow, call it pistachio pudding and you've got a hit.

Totally awesome! The one from the stores is too sweet, but this homemade one is simple, and tasty!
