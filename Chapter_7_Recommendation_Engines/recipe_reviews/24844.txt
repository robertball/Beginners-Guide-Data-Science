Wonderful!  I now make these every Sunday morning!  Definitely give it at LEAST 1 1/2 hours to rise before making waffles (if you don't you'll end up with dense, less flavorful waffles - I did that once) and overnight is really the best if you can think about breakfast that far in advance (which I can't).  If you like pancake mix waffles then this might not be your thing, but if you like old-fashioned waffles that don't taste like pancakes in a different shape, these are for you!

This really is a great recipe!  I often cater brunch and this is a favorite of everyone.  Most of the work is done the night before.   With a couple of steps in the morning and you have a wonderful breakfast.  I use a belgian waffle iron that flips and I wipe the hot iron with a stick of butter before each waffle.  I always serve these waffles with fresh whipping cream, real maple syrup, and an assortment of berries.  I disolve the sugar in the water before adding the yeast to help it rise.  Other than this step, I wouldn't change a thing in the recipe!!!  If you do any research and look for an authentic Belgian recipe, I think this "yeasty" recipe is very close in taste but is much easier than the traditional Belgian recipes.  They are even better the second or third day.  When I have extra batter, I freeze it in individual serving bags and put them in the freeze for my son who is away at school.  I haven't used the frozen batter for clients but my son loves having this taste from home while he is away.

I had been using a non-yeast waffle batter recipe for weeks now and I'll tell you........I don't think I can go back to using a waffle batter without yeast. The flavor of these waffles was amazing and they turned out incredibly light and fluffy. We all agree that this is one of the best waffle recipes I've made yet. EXCELLENT. Very happy.

This recipe made crisp and flavorful waffles.   I heated the milk in the microwave, and then threw the stick of butter in the hot milk to melt it.   I mixed up the batter in my standing mixer and left in in the mixing bowl overnight. In the morning, we were baking waffles in no time! Thanks for sharing.

Yummy but a bit time consuming. Make sure to let the milk cool so it's no hotter than the warm water or else the yeast won't work. My husband and I almost ate the whole batch!

These waffles are very light and crisp.  Because they aren't sweet, you could use them for a savory meal (topped with chicken and gravy, for example).  I enjoyed mine with bananas, walnuts, butter and maple syrup, and because they're so airy, they practically melted beneath the toppings.  I froze the leftover waffles, but when I reheated them they were crunchy like crackers!  The recipe is fine, but I prefer a more substantial non-yeasted Belgian waffle.  Not a do-over for me.

This is definitely a 5 star recipe!  I made it for Christmas Eve Day breakfast and with being able to prepare it the night before it was a breeze.  The waffles are light and crispy on the outside and soft inside - delicious!  We put chocolate chips in some, pecans in some and bacon in some which made for a nice variety for our waffle buffet.

These waffles bake up with a nice crisp crust but are soft on the inside.  We always add other items when baking waffles like dried fruit, nuts, and chocolate chips (my wife's favorite).  I usually add dried cranberries and walnuts (or pecans).   A plus to this batter is that it doesn't rise as much as regular waffle batter so it's easier to get the right amount into the iron without spillover.   After making these I was outside and the smell was wonderful. As a night person, I prefer breakfast recipes that have most of the work the night before.

These waffles are great.  Making the batter the night before is great.  They keep warm and don't get soggy in the oven. And they taste great!  My son, who loves waffles, said these are among the best I make.

My boyfriend and I began a Sunday morning waffle tradition.  Each week I've tried different recipes, looking for the perfect one.  When my boyfriend took a bite of these he said, "you can stop looking."

Same recipie a good friend gave us.  My husband, the "non-breakfast" eater LOVES them!!  So do my kids.  Me...I still prefer a good pancake (griddlecakes on this site are AMAZING).  I will make them again for everyone else. Note: they do take a bit of forethought...not something you decide to make one morning for breakfast.  Great, yeasty flavor and aroma!

I make these with 100% whole wheat flour, and substitute vegetable oil for the butter - the waffles are as light and crisp as anyone could ask for, and ridiculously easy.  You'd never know they were whole grain.  To make the prep even faster,  I use instant yeast, which requires no proofing (1 1/4 teaspoons added with the rest of the dry ingredients), hot tap water and cold milk.  Works like a charm.

We had these waffles this morning, probably the best waffles I've made in the years I've been making them. Definitely and emphatically a keeper!  I personally liked the subtle sourdough like taste of them.  I couldn't give these enough stars!

Very good waffles.  I increased the amount of sugar to 1T, and added 1/2t. vanilla, and we loved it.

Absolutely wonderful!  These are super easy, crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside (regular waffle maker, not Belgium waffle maker) with a wonderful yeasty taste.  I inadvertently doubled the sugar, but they weren't "sweet".  I really wouldn't change a thing about this recipe even though I did make a couple of changes.  As I said, I accidentally upped the sugar, and because I decided to make this recipe at the last minute when I already had yeast bloomed in 1 Cup of water for a bread recipe I realized there was no time to make.  Because of that, I used the 1 cup of water and reduced the milk to 1 1/2 cups and hoped for the best.  I'll do it as instructed next time, but it did work fine.  I made this Christmas Eve to have for Christmas breakfast.  Since there are just 3 of us, I had batter left and now 2 days later I used the batter for waffles for supper and I do believe it may be even better today.  The batter gets very thick, almost more dough-like than batter, with a wonderful yeast flavor.  I'll certainly make this over and over.  Thank you for putting an end to biscuit mix waffles in this house!

Best waffles ever!  My tip, not changing anything in Janet's recipe, is that I double it, let it sit overnight, make the waffles next morning, and freeze them.  Then when I want some I just put them in the toaster on "defrost" first, then toast them and they come out just like they were fresh made!  Honest they do!

I had better success with proofing the yeast by adding the sugar to the water/yeast mixture and then adding the milk/butter/flour.

Excellent ! Finally found this recipe which gives light and crunchy waffle like the store bought kind. I put the batter in the fridge overnight instead of room temperature. Room temp overnight may be the reason for the sour taste one of the reviewers experienced. I also added cinnamon and chocolate chips. Resisitable !

These are the best waffles I have ever had. They are so light and crisp, they almost melt in your mouth. I didn't change the recipe at all. I like the fact that you can do most of the preparation the night before (a real time-saver). Thanks for this recipe. I will make it again and again.

Absolutely the best waffles we've ever had, anywhere, anytime.  I let the batter sit for only 2 hours (because I didn't read the entire recipe before I started) and they were crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  They were served with strawberries and whipped cream with one person just using butter and maple syrup.  All of us thought they were beyond delicious and we could open a restaurant with this recipe! The serving size is right on, this batter made 6 servings of 2-4" waffles.

I really enjoyed the crisp/firm consistancy of this waffle recipe. For my personal taste, I would use less yeast and add malt flavoring to create a more "hotel restaraunt" taste.

As others have said, this recipe makes nice light, crispy waffles. Unlike pancakes (or waffle-shaped pancakes), I easily  ate two waffles and didn't feel like I was waddling away from the table afterwards. Based on comments posted here, I added 1 t. of vanilla to the batter to enhance the flavor but I really like the idea of making a savory waffle by adding crumbled bacon, so plan to try that the next time out. The batter was easy to put together. I scalded the milk in the microwave, then stirred the butter into it to melt; saving me an extra dish to wash. Being able to leave the batter to work overnight made for a quick finish of the dish in the morning.  I'll definitely use this recipe again; especially the next time I host a brunch.

Very good. Made recipe as stated, no tweaking. Recipe halves very nicely. Finally - crispy waffles! The other cook is right - these are NOT pancakes in a different shape, thankfully!

Since I got my waffle maker a few months ago, I've tried about 6 recipes. This is by far the best. Very light, crispy waffles. Definitely worth the extra work.  (Actually, the work in the morning it a lot easier than other non-yeast recipes.)

Awesome.  Came out great even though we only let the batter rise for a few hours instead of all night.  Delicious.  Recipe going in the file for another day.

Only needed to wait 1 hour before the batter had doubled in size.  Not sure what would have happened if I had waited overnight.  Waffles cooked to a perfect light, crispy, golden brown in about 3 minutes in my waffle iron.

The recipe worked great & the waffles had lovely texture. I loved the yeast smell, but thought the flavor was just okay. Maybe I'm a just a traditional waffle person. :)

I'll give it 3 stars as it may have been my wrong doing but these waffles were sour like sourdough.  I don't know if that was from being on the counter overnight or if I overheated the milk.  I had a 1/2 cup of buckwheat flour left in the pantry and added it to the other flour.  As a result, the waffles were soggy.  I'll have to try these again following the recipe as exactly as I can.

The best waffle recipe I've found!! I love the ease of preparing at bedtime and just finishing 'em off and throwing them in the waffle iron in the morning! Like other reviewers have stated I found they make a big batch and so I freeze the left-overs. To re-warm them we throw them in the toaster (for just a short bit so they don't burn!)and they come right back to life just as if they were just cooked! Very, very good recipe! Thanks!

Very good. Have never made waffles from scratch before now. Definately worth it. I added 1/2 t of cinnamon and an extra 2T sugar and some extra vanilla. I let it set out for about 16 hours because we didn't get around to breakfast until lunch. When it was done with butter and powdered sugar it tasted almost like french toast. Very light and puffy.Yummy!

I love that these are so good with so little sugar. The little crunch on the outside of the waffle is exquisite. Made the batter with my son the night before Mother's Day so he and DBF could make breakfast for me. I made a half batch. The OnLy issue I had was trying to put the batter in a quart jar...overflowed all over the counter....I scooped up as much as I could and put in my biggest Tupperware--cooked up great the next morning. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is my favorite yeast waffle recipe! They seem like a cross between waffles and french toast! YUM!! 
Once I even forgot to add the eggs and soda the NEXT morning (as the directions said to) instead, adding them both AT THE SAME TIME that I made the rest of batter (the night before). I was really worried that I'd ruined them, but when I went to bake them in the waffle iron the next morning they ended up being just perfect! (This is a "forgiving" recipe!) Just be sure that your yeast is good!!
I love that you make the batter ahead of time and don't even have to refrigerate it...just cover and set out on the counter. 
My family LOVES these served with "Nutella" or, buttered with a lovely topping made from 1 can of "Cherry Pie Filling" (well warmed in micro-wave) with a 1/4 teas. real vanilla and 1/4 t. Almond flavoring) added....and don't forget the whipped cream! 
*Totally decadent!!* 
(If you use home canned cherries in juice (1 qt.) you need to thicken them first with 1-2 T. corn starch, bring to a boil on med. heat and add 3/4 to 1 Cup sugar--or to taste. If 1/4 t. of Almond flavoring seems like too little you can always add a bit more, also to taste!) Great for Mothers Day Brunch with bacon or sausage on the side! :o)

Used this recipe with my Waring waffle/omlet maker. OMG these were the very best waffles ever.  My husband wanted me to personally thank you for the recipe!
I made the recipe as listed, left it out overnight in a bowl covered with plastic wrap.  Added the baking soda and egg in the morning, also added a tablespoon of vanilla flavoring.  PERFECT!

The best waffles that we have ever had. I made them as written and my family loved them. The only change that I will make the next time is to add 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla.

Really good.  Very crisp and light.  However, the yeast flavor was too strong as written.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla, used a tablespoon of sugar (as per Mammaw's Waffles, another recipe on this site that I like).  The last two I made I added some cinnamon and it made them even better.  These changes mask the yeast flavor, which to me is okay in bread but undesirable in waffles.

This is the BEST waffle recipe out there.  My stepmother made these when I was little and we still make them today for my kids.  I think credit deeds to be given to the Fanny Farmer Cookbook, since that's where this recipe is from.  I highly recommend this cookbook for this recipe and many other yummy recipes, including the best chocolate chip cookies!  Five stars for this Fanny Farmer Cookbook recipe.

This recipe makes the best waffles.  I’ve tried many waffle recipes and this is by far the best waffles I have made.  They have that fabulous yeasty bready flavor, so if you are a bread addict like me, you will love this recipe.  The texture was perfect, light with a crispy exterior.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of halving the recipe.  This recipe is  definitely a keeper.

Not to my liking.I use yeast a lot, but these waffles were inedible.  In fact, I sent my husband to the store for some waffle mix because we just couldn't eat them.  They tasted SO strongly of yeast and were almost bitter because of the lack of sugar.  Even when I added more sugar and vanilla is didn't cover up the yeast taste.  Really, really bad.

This was not my favorite way to prepare waffles, but I think it is just a personal preference. The yeast smell and taste was overwhelming, in my opinion. However, in all fairness, the waffles looked beautiful and they were very light and airy and crispy on the outside. I see these on restaurant menus all the time and have never ordered them, so I assume they are very popular. Just not in my family :)

Great recipe, but unnecessarily complicated.  No need to activate the yeast, or even warm anything.  Letting it sit out 12 hours will make it all work out.  Just pour everything in a bowl, mix it up, and let it sit over night.  For people complaining this recipe was too much work, it really doesn't need to be.

Best waffles we've ever had.  Its just my husband and I, so we usually half the recipe and its perfect. Light & fluffy.  Super tasty with pretty much any syrup, but we love having it with pure maple syrup, fresh strawberries & whipped cream.  Deeeelish!

I've tried so many waffle recipes looking for this outcome. I'm so happy I can stop searching. They are light and crispy on the outside and very flavorful without being too sweet or pancake tasting. To those of you who may not realize, yeast is a living thing and if you treat it right, it will do just what you ask of it. Make sure the warm water is as close to 110 degrees as possible and make sure the milk is too when you add them together. If they are too cold the yeast will remain dormant but too hot will kill the yeast. Both will result in no rise. Also, putting the mixture in the refrigerator instead of letting it out will cause the yeast to go dormant too. I also suggest putting the sugar into the warm water with the yeast to give them something to feed off of.  Thank you so much, Janet for sharing this. I would give it a ten if I could.

WOW!  Fantastic Waffles!!!  Truly, a treat in the morning!!  We doubled the recipe and had waffles all week long.   We loved them that much!  I didn't store them in an air tight container (to avoid soggy waffles) I just put some tinfoil on top, just to protect from accidental spills or what have you.  The next morning, we'd pop them in the microwave for a couple of seconds, then the toaster.  This recipe is awesome and a winner in our home!  THANK YOU for sharing!!!

very good as writen, I did change it to 3 servings used 1/2 cup buckwheat flour, placed 1/2 strip cooked beacon in each waffle before pouring in batter. They were crispy and light even with the heavier buckwheat

We made these for a big family breakfast and everyone really liked them.  They have a definate yeast flavor and are crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.

I printed this recipe in Jan 2006; taped it inside my kitchen cabinet so it would always be handy.I couldn't begin to tell you how many times I've made these and had rave reviews by everyone who ate them (especially my husband and 80+ neighbor lady).There can't be a better yeast waffle recipe out there.Don't change a thing.

This is my ONLY waffle recipe. I hate those boxed baking mixes-too heavy for my taste. This makes a light waffle that can be crispy on the outside if you leave it in the waffle iron that long.I like to make them a bit on the under cooked side and then freeze them for breakfast. Put them in the toaster oven for a minute or so and a great breakfast.

This makes a very good waffle. Like others, I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract.  I also increased the amount of sugar to one tablespoon.  This is our family's go-to yeast waffle recipe.  When I do not have time to make the waffles the night before, I put the bowl in the oven (not turned on), with a tray of water that has just been boiled underneath.  It provides a nice, warm, moist environment for the yeast to rise in.  Cuts the rising time down significantly and does not impact the quality or texture of the waffle.

I've not had much luck with waffle batter until now.  The first time I made this I tripled the recipe so that my dept. at work could have a "Waffle Wednesday" breakfast.  HUGE hit-- We had three waffle machines going at once!  The reviews from all was a unanimous “outstanding!”.  Crispy on the outside, light on the inside, with a nice rich flavor from the yeast.  I also added a little vanilla.  This is a keeper.  I love that it needs to be made the night before so that I don't have to get up extra early in the morning.

My hubby made these last night so we could serve guests for breakfast.  Very happy!  These are definitely worth passing on the Bisquick!  So yummy and such a different taste than plain ol' waffles.  We doubled and cooked up a bunch of waffles and put them in small freezer bags for quick before school breakfast.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Sorry to say that both hubby and I thought these were awful. The yeast took over the flavor and they didn't cook up nice and golden like the simple ones on the Bisquick box (which we promptly made after tossing the yeast batter). We add a bit of sugar, lemon juice, baking soda, and buttermilk for milk 
(if we've got it) to the Bisquick recipe and have given up on the recipes that separate the egg and fold in the white, blah, blah, blah. Make 'em and eat 'em, quick and easy!

These are the best waffles ever! 
Crispy on the outside;  light and fluffy on the inside. 
Made the batter the night before, then the next morning made waffles for breakfast. Used the remaining batter that afternoon for lunch. 
Even my granddaughter that doesn't do mornings or breakfast loves them!

Great recipe, best waffles I have ever made!  The baking soda is there for browning (I assume as there does not appear to be enough acid to activate it for leavening).  I did not want that much left over baking soda in my recipe so use 3/4-1 tsp of baking powder which still produced light golden brown waffles.  These waffles freeze really well for toaster waffles during the week.

Excellent. Wife and kids loved them. I made them (exactly as written) special for Mother's Day! A big hit. No comparison to store bought mixes. Using the flip top Belgium waffle maker I got about 5 1/4 out of the mix.  It is tough to gauge how much mix to add to each waffle. I overfilled a few which I'm sure I can prevent in the future.

The first batch I made, I followed the directions and ingredients to a "T", but they were VERY bland, so I added more sugar and vanilla and that helped a little. I didn't particularly like the sour taste the yeast gave, either. This may be an "ok" base waffle mix but just add cinnamon or chocolate chips to pizzaz the flavor a bit. Even with syrup, they still weren't that great. As is 2 stars (plus a half star because it did have a nice crunch), with added sugar and vanilla, I'd give it a 3.

I have always used a box mix to make "homemade waffles". I like to freeze them then put them in the toaster like you do with store bought ones. I was unsure what to expect with this recipe! The morning i made them the family didn't seem to impressed but I froze them anyway. Over the next few days we finished them off. We never eat waffles that quick. We loved them and you get a lot of waffles if you have a smaller waffle iron. It made 36 waffles. I will never make box mix waffles again.

Light, fluffy, tender but with a lightly crisp exterior.  Love that you can make it ahead of time and all you have to do is start cooking them the next morning. I was introduced to these at a Saturday morning Christmas breakfast and my friend who made them sent the leftover batter with me to make some for my grandsons.  I was able to find the time to make them Wednesday evening and the batter was still perfectly good so I would hazard to say that, kept good and cold in the refrigerator, the batter would be good for up to a week.

Amazing!  These were so light and fluffy.....my family devoured them.  Thanks for the recipe.  :-). To accommodate dietary restrictions, I used plain rice milk, Earth Balance instead of butter, and Egg Beaters.

This recipes is by far the best waffle recipe I have tried.  I made the batter last night and the only change I made was heating  the milk in the microwave as one review suggested.  I took my batter and belgian waffle iron to work and made waffles for our weekly meeting.  I got rave reviews.  This will now become my go to waffle recipe.

These are the best waffles I've ever had!  There was nothing weired about them, but they just were different than normal waffels, more special.  I also love being able to get them started the night before.  The recipe made plenty, with leftovers for our family of 4.

The good thing about this recipe is that it doesn't taste like the plain old waffles that you get from a boxed batter. It does have a fresh-baked bread taste. My waffles didn't turn out crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. They were actually kind of limp...I suppose it could actually be a problem with the waffle iron. The batter was also extremely thinner than what I'm used to. All in all a decent recipe and easy to execute.

This is my favorite waffle recipe.  I would give it five stars but I cannot remember to put this together the night before usually.  I have actually doubled the yeast and let it rise for aproximately 3 hours and had a passable result.

These were amazing!

They stayed crisp even as leftovers. We ate them with a little whipped cream and frozen berries. The yeast gave such a full flavor it needed very little topping.

Scalding the milk is unnecessary and as others have pointed out, the milk cannot be at much over 115 F when adding it to the main bowl. After laboring through this reviewing the long list of things to be cleaned a few improvements make this a B+ experience. Combine the 110 F water with 1½ t sugar and
1½ t yeast, add milk at room temperature (do not scald) along with melted butter, flour and salt.  Allow to set, covered, overnight or at least 4 hrs at room temperature.  Prior to cooking, add eggs and baking soda as specified here. Thank you to the others who suggested the simplifications and the easy to make error of not letting the milk cool.  Regarding scalding, the tradition lives on but only needed if you are using raw, unpasteurized milk to knock down existing organisms that might interfere with the fermenting process you started with the yeast. Yoghurt benefits from scalding in the same way, but also because heating to 180-185 F makes the milk proteins agglutinate - waffles don’t need scalded milk.  In summary, use milk at room temperature; 1.5 times the sugar. These are good to excellent and very yeasty.  If you want savory waffles use 1t sugar.

Within the past year, I have had a lifestyle change. Two of my teenage grandchildren now live with me fulltime. I rise @4:00am to prepare them a hearty breakfast every single school day. When I stumbled across this recipe & after reading reviews, I was apprehensive but intrigued by the overnight "resting" batter. I have to agree the smell was like sour dough but that does NOT transfer over to the taste. Absolutely delicious!!! Grandkids gobbled it up! So easy & I can see the leftovers being toaster friendly. I am unsaving the other waffle recipes I have- they are that good.

This did make 6. I made it as written with the exception of sugar with my quick yeast so it bubbles. I also didn't sift the flour and waited for the milk to cool a good while so it didn't kill the yeast. I left it overnight for 9 hours and served with chopped strawberries and homemade whipped cream.
I hate cooking first thing in the morning so this made waffles bearable!

Good any way you make it. The best I have found so far is to separate yolks from whites, then add yolks and baking soda into mixture, then beat egg whites until they have soft peaks and gently fold whites into mixture. Let sit for an hour more before cooking. I usually get 1-2 more waffles out of the recipe by doing this and they are much lighter and fluffy.

If you’re a waffle person, and I am, this is THE recipe.  The waffles taste great and they’re pretty much ready to cook when you wake up, after you add the last 2 ingredients. Stop thinking about making them and make them already! What’s wrong with you?!

Nice easy waffle.  It was nice to do the bulk of the work the night before so you can get straight to cooking in the morning.  They are light and very crispy, and not sweet, so your toppings don't overdo it.  I did add about 1/4 cup of sugar to the batter.  Made about 5 Belgian waffles that are 7 inches in diameter.

These are delicious yeasty waffles. I added the teaspoon of sugar to the yeast and water and then added another 4 tablespoons of sugar to the flour mixture to make them sweet. They came out great!

Great waffles. My family loves these. Silly tip. Just melt butter with warming milk. Saves a step. I also cut the salt in half but that's preference.

First 1 star review that I've ever written! I made these in the morning, and we had them for dinner, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. My hubby said they were "tough", and I had to agree. They weren't light, and they stuck to the waffle iron despite spraying with PAM. Sorry, but this one is one and done...

The only change that I made to the recipe was to use Instant Yeast instead of Active Dry yeast.  Since I used Instant Yeast I didn't have to proof it. I threw all of the dry ingredients in a mixing bowl, making sure that the salt was on the opposite of the bowl from the yeast, then heated the milk, and butter, added in the water and threw in a teaspoon of vanilla, waited until the liquids came down to 110 degrees, then threw it into the mixing bowl and mixed it with the whisk attachment until it was smooth.  I then covered it with plastic wrap and set it on the counter.  In the morning I added the eggs and baking soda.

My sister-in-laws family was very impressed.  They said that they usually use a mix.  I think that this is almost easier than a mix since you can do most of it the night before.

Really good waffles, followed the recipe exactly! Made these for Father's Day breakfast and everyone loved them. Added chocolate chips to some, berries and whipped cream to others, some with just syrup and butter. All of them were delicious!!! Must try, thank you for sharing.

I'm not sure what happened, maybe it's because I didn't let the milk and butter cool before adding it with the yeast (which kills the yeast) but this was the most disgusting thing I have ever eaten!!!

My only waffle recipe from now on! I have made these about a dozen times now, let the batter sit overnight for best flavor but still good if you only have an hour or two to rest batter. Not too sweet and crispy outside moist inside.

These are good enough for me to make again and tweek it a little bit. We made brunch at work, so I took the batter with me and for some reason my batter was a little thin which caused me a little grief, but overall they came out pretty good. I'll also add more sugar next time-I prefer a sweeter waffle needing less syrup. I think the recipe as is would be perfect to make a savory waffle.

I run a B&B, and this recipe is now a staple for us!  I don't actually bring the milk to a simmer.  I just microwave it until it is hot enough to melt the butter.  Boiling milk would kill the yeast, and I simply don't have time to wait for it to cool.

Makes our whole inn smell like freshly baked bread.

Of all my reviews,  this is my first recipe review. I was so blown away by these waffles and I had to tell everybody.  This is my first time using yeast while cooking and it was easy and convenient.  The waffles were amazingly crisp on the outside while staying light and fluffy on the inside. Flavor was just right. Loved them and will make them again for sure.  My new go to waffle recipe.

I made these for my entire family for Christmas morning.  Everyone said they were some of the best waffles they ever tasted.  Love that I was able to make the main part the day before making these easy for Christmas morning. I had fresh blueberries, strawberries, and real whip cream for a special morning.  I saw some people make them and put them in the oven to keep them warm, I tried it with two but eating them right away tasted better.  Great recipe!!

I made these for Christmas breakfast because of the night before prep helped streamline the process of my usual buttermilk mix recipe.  Overall, everyone in my family enjoyed but my husband and I missed the rich buttermilk flavor of my go to waffles.  I do highly recommend for the night before prep and those who love a yeasty flavor.

These were great. I made them in a blender and put them in the fridge overnight.  Took them out and got them to room temperature, added the remaining two ingredients and had a wonderful breakfast.

I made this recipe pretty much as written. I didn't bring the milk to "bubbling" as I feared it would then be too hot and would kill the yeast action. I brought the milk to 110 degrees instead. The batter mixed very well and it bubbled and frothed during the 6 hours that I let it sit. I used an electric waffle maker which tells you when the waffle is done. It had always worked well before. This time, the waffle was very pale when the maker said it was done so I let it cook a bit longer to get a bit of "crunch" on the outside. When removing the waffle using a fork, the tender texture of the waffle could not withstand its own weight and the waffle would tear. They were very tender on the inside, actually too much so for my liking. The taste - while okay - was not extraordinary. I think I'm going to keep looking for a waffle with a bit more body and flavor.

This was AMAZINGLY EASY to make! I'm cooking the waffles right now and eating them almost as they come out of the iron they're so yummy. I like a savory waffle; if you are looking for something with sweetness look ELSEWHERE. Woohoo! A GREAT breakfast that's not terribly hard to do :) It tastes a lot like sourdough, which is EXACTLY what I was looking for with this recipe.

I WAS kinda tentative adding the eggs in this morning; the dough (or, well, it LOOKED like dough; I bake a lot of bread) more than doubled and had a nice skin on top. Make sure you blend it well (I don't have an electric mixer, all by hand... took me about as long as it took my waffle iron to heat up :)

Oh my!  These waffles are delicious!  I took the advice of another reviewer and heated the milk in the microwave.  Also threw the butter into the hot milk to melt it.  It mixed up quickly in the morning and the waffles were perfect!
