This is a lovely recipe, but I did find it needed a little salt, which I added while the onion was caramelizing and also at the end of cooking.  I used 24 dried figs and made only a half recipe (1 cup spread), which I reconstituted with boiling water for about 10 minutes.  I also added some water to the pan after adding the chopped figs to the onion in the pan and let them simmer away for about another 10 minutes, when the all the liquid evaporated and the figs were pretty soft.  I followed the recipe to the letter after that and ended up mashing the mixture a bit with my pastry blender instead of processing (tip from mis7up).  I also used light brown sugar.  I froze the spread and plan to put on my fruit and cheese tray for Christmas Eve.  Thanks for the recipe, Thea.

Followed the recipe exactly as given - used figs picked from my Mission Fig tree. I was disappointed - but then do not know what I was expecting it to taste like. Still looking for that spectacular fig recipe. Till then, I'll just pick them from the tree and eat them for breakfast, as is.

Nummy Nummy Nummy!!! Easy recipe to follow. From start to finish. So when my figs broke down they were still a tad chunky, I finished the cooking process and then pulsed the batch a couple of times in my Ninja and there was a great thick, tangy sweet oniony spread. My girls and I liked it, but I am on guard.....don't want to share! For some reason this recipe reminds me of my childhood. I don't know if my Nana ever made this but, for some reason, it reminds me of her. And I can tell you, this will be come a cherished treat for me. TY....TY! A great pairing of savory and sweet without it being overly sweet or tart, it was right on the money! And yes, I did add the sugar!

Really enjoy anything with figs so I was eager to try this recipe. Made it exactly as written and was pleased with the result as far as consistency was concerned but felt it was a bit flat in flavor. Added the zest of an orange and it was just what the jam needed to give it a pop. Love it with Brie or blue cheese bruschetta.

Great recipe!  I made it mostly as written.  I  added cherry balsamic vinegar as another reviewer mentioned in addition to 1 tablespoon of sugar. Very good!  I'll make it again. Thank you.

Yum!  This was good as-is but after tasting it I decided to add a little brown sugar, a sprinkling of black pepper, and just a touch of garlic powder. Excellent with cheese and crackers!  I ended up using the back of the spoon to smash down the fog and help break it up while it was cooking

Tasted very good. My backyard figs are of the green variety and they worked well in this recipe . Replaced with 2Tbsp of honey instead of using refined sugar . Personal preference.

I used green figs instead of black, did not put in any salt, and one table spoon of sugar.  Turned out great.

NO sugar needed if you use a very good Balsamic vinegar.(i.e. there is no caramel colour!)  Red onions must be fresh and when they caramelize down, they sweeten up. So good.

This is so delicious!   I'm having it right now on crackers for my breakfast    :~D

This recipe is dangerous.
I could eat the entire jar of spread with crackers in one sitting.
Thank God for control!

This rescued us from dry out-of-season figs!!  We picked up 2 trays (30 figs) of fresh figs on Christmas Eve, knowing they were out of season but thrilled to find them.  And yes, they turned out to be dry and tasteless.  So I found this recipe and, voila!!  Tangy sweet fig onion jam. Not too sweet, just right. I used honey instead of sugar, and only 1 tbsp was plenty. Plus added 
 a little salt, as others here had suggested.  So easy!!  Saved the cardboard-like figs!!!  My husband thought they couldn’t be saved, now he can’t get enough of this. I love proving him wrong.
