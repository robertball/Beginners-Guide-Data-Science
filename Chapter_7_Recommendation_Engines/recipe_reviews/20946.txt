This was fantastic and so so simple! It was great for a summer dessert. I made it for a dinner get-together with friends and everyone raved about it.

It certainly is easy to make.  I added a bit more Grand Marnier because I wanted it to soak the doughnut a little.  It is kind of fancy looking, but doesnâ€™t stay that way for long once the ice cream starts to melt and the whipped cream starts to drip..

Very quick and easy and almost elegant in its presentation.  Very yummy.
