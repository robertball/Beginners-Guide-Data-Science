Loved everything in this dish! The only thing I did differently was I didn't strain the soup (I didn't want to waste anything). Next time I won't add as much balsamic vinigrette

I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes because that's what I had and used basil oil and olive oil. My husband and I both loved it and will make it again!

This was pretty tasty and light.  I used bay scallops instead of sea scallops which wound up being a mistake.  Trust me- splurge on the more expensive sea scallops.

I am giving this three stars because my guests liked it, but I didn't.  A lot probably depends on the freshness and quality of the tomatoes used.  A good option if you have vegetarians in your company, since the scallops are easy to leave out.
