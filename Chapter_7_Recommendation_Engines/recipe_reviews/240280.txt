Took my waffle iron to work and made waffles at lunch.  Everyone enjoyed them.  I made one change, I used 1 cup of chunky applesauce instead of regular.  The leftovers freeze well and reheat quickly in a toaster.

We made the waffles and ate them without the fruit pie topping and they are delicious!

Made waffles as directed but did not serve with the topping in the recipe. Good fall flavored waffle but my kids prefer the "regular" waffles. Use this recipe when you don't want them to overeat - ha!

I made this recipe this morning and used the saut√©ed apple recipe as a topping.  Turned out great!!! I used 2 t of apple pie spice instead of the listed spices.  Also, took the recommendation of someone to use 1 C chunky apple sauce, too.  The waffles were a success.  Will make again.

These were quick, easy to make and scrumptious. My husband and I are relatively new on the waffle scene so I can't speak to crispy, spongy, crunch, cake like, etc. I can speak to the flavor which is wonderful. We even used boring pancake syrup from the grocery! Straight out of the bottle even! We're obviously commoners. The waffles gave the kitchen a fabulous cinnamon and spice scent which is always a bonus in my book. I put a dash of extra cinnamon in the batter but it was unnecessary. These really are yummy..

Very easy and good. I didn't make the topping but otherwise followed the recipe. The spice amount is good and gives it a nice flavor, as does the applesauce.  This made about eight waffles as written, which resulted in three leftover waffles. I froze for another time. Thanks for the recipe!

These were a great morning treat at grandma's house this morning.  I made them exactly as written. Delicious.  They have the enticing autumn spice aroma that makes kitchen smell like love.
