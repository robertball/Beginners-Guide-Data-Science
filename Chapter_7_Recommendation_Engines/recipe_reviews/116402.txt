Excellent!! Definitely marinate overnight. Also I baked the roast in the marinade for 1 hour at 350 degrees F.

Fabulous! I upped the serving size to 8 for a 3 pound chuck roast. I used chili sauce vs. ketchup for a little extra kick and opted for the red wine vinegar. I used olive oil vs. veg oil and dijon mustard. I also used minced garlic vs. garlic powder. I poked the meat thoroughly and put everything into a ziploc bag. I let this marinate for 48 hours which I highly recommend. I put this over a rotisserie until it reached 160 degrees. The meat was tender and juicy! It just doesn't get much better than this!

This was a very good marinade, made my chuck steak very tender. The only thing I did different was I grilled mine over charcoal. First over direct heat I grilled both sides until brown then I remove to indirect heat and cook for 45min. Turning every ten min or so. I also reserved a little marinade before I added my chuck steak, to base my meat as it cooked. Also I marinade my meat overnight before cooking. Very Good!!!

Great marinade, cooked in slow cooker, was wonderful.  I marinated the roast for 3 days.

Though the flavor of the marinade is really good, for some reason, my roast was still pretty tough, so I think next time I will either BBQ as directed or put it in the slow cooker (I roasted it in the oven as I don't have a BBQ). I didn't add the additional salt as with all of the other salty ingredients I didn't think it needed it. I think with the salt it would have been too salty for me. I also doubled the garlic, since we love garlic and it was the perfect garlickiness for us. I marinated it for 8 hours, I think for next time, I'll do at least 12 hours.

Thank you for this recipe, it was a great hit!  I had a 2.6 lb chuck steak and I doubled the recipe.  I allowed the meat to marinate 24 hrs and then baked it in the oven with the marinade until the meat was falling apart.  It was tasty and tender and I will definately make again.

This recipe turned out very delicious.  Instead of broiling it, I did bake it in the oven.  Broiling will leave the meat very tough.  It was great the family enjoyed it.

Delicious! I made 2 in my crock pot already. Tweaked & used others' suggestions a bit. Here's what I did: Olive oil vs. veggie; red wine vinegar vs. cider; cut up a few onions & added some montreal seasoning. I doubled the recipe for ample sauce in crock pot.  The 1st roast I followed suggestions & marinaded for 2 days, placed in crock 7 hrs on low. Delicious!  2nd roast I put marinade ingredients (doubled) into crock & heated up, once hot, I dropped the FROZEN roast into crock, cooked on low for 8 hours - agains DELICIOUS!  I try to always defrost meat in fridge before crocking but when time is tight I know it can work with a frozen roast and double batch the marinade ;)  Superb recipe. Thanks!

I really enjoyed this dish, so did my entire family, I think it would have been more flavorful if I had let the meat marinade for alittle longer, but other then that it was amazing! Thank you : D

Very good recipe.  I also increased my marinade to 8 servings and used a 3 pound bone-in roast.  I cut the roast into smaller serving size chunks and marinated it for 2 days.  I baked it in a dutch oven at 300 degrees for 2 1/2 hours.  Very tender!

I marinated the steak for 24 hours+ and it was very juicy even though I grilled it a bit longer than I would have liked... I used cider vinegar in the marinade.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

This marinade had great flavor, but it was a tad on the salty side for me.

Great recipe, everyone loved it all the way down to the 2 year old!  My only problem was with cooking it, I broiled it and it seemed to take forever until it was done.  Or at least until it was not dripping bright red blood.

Very tasty.  I wasn't sure what broiler setting to use, so I went with low; with seven minutes on each side, I had something just on the medium rare side.  The meat was juicy and flavorful.  I think it would be good in a salad or wrap as well.

I used the slow cooker and cooked it with the marinade.  I also added whole garlic toes, chunks of onion, and large pieces of bell pepper towards the end.  It was so wonderful!  This will go into the family recipe box!

I took a different approach. I did not marinate.  Instead, I mixed the ingredients for the marinade, put it in a crock pot, put a chuck roast in the crock pot, and cooked for 5 hours.  It was OUT OF THIS WORLD!  Use a little flour to thicken the drippings to a gravy that will light up your tongue!

Loved this marinade!  I marinaded for 20 hrs and overall thought the taste was good and the meat tender.  Thought it was a tad bit too vinegary and will next reduce the amount.

Really delicious and surprisingly tender!  Followed others' advice and cooked for a few hours on rack in the oven, at about 250 degrees.

I did end up marinating the Chuck Roast for about 1 1/2 days.  I seared both sides before putting it in the crock-pot.  It smelled amazing while cooking, and was done after 8 hours.  The juices made a tasty gravy.  We all loved it!  Thank you so much!

This was a big hit with my husband and son.  Cooked the chuck roast on the grill after marinating for 8 hrs.  The roast was a little over an inch think and at 12 minutes per side it was perfect- medium to medium rare inside.  Very tender.

Fabulous flavor!  I doubled the marinade as I had a larger piece of meat.  I marinated it for around 14 hours.  My husband loved it!  The meat was very flavorful and browned nicely.  Next time, I would like to add a little brown sugar to change the flavor and make it more like a BBQ sauce, but I will definitely use this recipe again!

I added the marinade and cooked in the oven. Flavor was good and meat would have been tenderer if I had had time to cook as long as I would have liked. Had to run out for an emergency! I'll try this one again when I can marinate overnight. Thanks.

Great flavor!  I marinated for 20 hours.  It was still a little tough, but the flavor is excellent.  Served with mashed potatoes and salad.  Family loved it!

Easy, good marinade.  I used it with our top sirloin roast and marinated it overnight.  Worked great and made for some great beef!

Could be my fault... I only marinated it for an hour and then grilled.  Husband and son liked it.  My picky daughters did not.

We marinated our chuck roast for about 30 hrs then put it on the grill (we added some hardwood for flavor) and it was OUTSTANDING!  Our roast was 6+ lbs and we must have had it on the grill for almost 40 minutes - it was rare, tender and juicy.

So good and easy - everything I needed was in the house already!  This tasted like a commercially prepared marinade I used to buy at the store.  Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome marinade!! Liked by my entire picky family. The cut of meat I had was thicker on one side and didn't cook evenly, so I covered it and tried to cook it a little longer on a lower temp, which made it a little tough. Will be cooked again

Great marinade!  I forgot the mustard and didn't use pepper, and it was still fantastic.  I quadrupled this recipe to make a large batch of meat, and left it in the fridge for 24 hours.  I got a big thumbs up from the "King of the Marinades" - my dad, who is a tough customer.

This was really good!!  I also marinated for 3 days and cooked in slow cooker (8 hrs on low).  My very picky 10 y/o son loved it!!!  Leftovers were great too!

First time cooking a roast.  Had a 3lb chuck and followed instructions but trippled ingredients and marinated for two days. NO LEFTOVERS!!! My young girls are very picky about meat and they actually asked for thirds :-) The Mr. and I enjoyed it also. Great Recipe :-)

The flavor was good, but I think it needed to cook a bit more. Maybe 10 minutes on each side. I like mine medium rare, but 8 minutes on each side still left it very rare in the middle. Of course, I doubled the recipe, so that's my fault.

This steak was good, but not 4 or 5 stars, it lacked flavor and the meat wasn't as tender as I expected it to be.  I won't make it again.

It was ok but I was a bit dissapointed. I was feeding a large group of people and I dont think it was a very big hit. I really thought the vinegar was overpowering. It just had a strange aftertaste. Will not make again.
