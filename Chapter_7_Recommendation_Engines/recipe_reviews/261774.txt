I gave this recipe 5 stars  after some changes I made.  I added sage, green pepper in the patty, a clove of garlic.  I skipped the eggs as I figured that would make them too fragile to turn.  I did not use any kind of carb at all though.  I skipped the 7 tablespoons of butter and used 1/2 of the onion soup package instead.  That way I dumped a bunch of calories and it was healthier for me and my heart.  You will have to figure out how much of the onion soup to use. Very tasty.

My granddaughter asked me to make my Salisbury steak for her visit today. However, I knew she was on a low carb diet due the need to lose weight for her upcoming surgery.  Found just what I needed.  This is a great recipe. Followed the recipe for the steaks but made adjustments for the gravy.  She doesn't eat mushrooms so I had to leave them out, also changed the sour cream to low fat milk (was out of sour cream) with the beef broth and an extra tablespoon of flour.  Taste good!

Didn’t have beef broth so used chicken broth instead and cornstarch as a thickener for the gravy.  The meat patties are nicely flavoured, I used green onions, they look nice in the patty mix.  It was so good and will make it again!

Yummy!  Only thing is that it falls apart easily. However,  I am on low carbs so no bread crumbs  to make it stick.  Husband approved too.

I made this last night.  It was easy and delicious.  The gravy reminds me of stroganoff. Will definitely be making this again!

This was pretty delicious! The only issue I had was that the patties were falling apart,maybe due to the fattier cut of ground beef I used. Since,I tend to be eating low carb,next time I make this, I will use some crushed pork rinds and dip the patties into to help bind them better. I used less butter then the recipe called for,and didn't thicken with flour as it is off limits for low carb diet. To thicken it, and still be low carb,or Keto,you could certainly substitute corn starch,arrowroot, or Xanthan gum for the purpose of thickening the gravy.

This was Great! I have never had Salisbury Steak with the sour cream, I have always made it with "regular" gravy with lots of onions (and sometimes mushrooms) in it. This is now a new thing at our house. We did use Greek yogurt being careful to just add a little at a time to the not too hot pan)  instead of sour cream and low fat burger. I have no doubt that the original ingredients make it even better (including the higher fat beef the footnote mentioned) and I will try that sometime. We are just losing some of the holiday weight we put on. Thank you Chef DJ!

Very good flavor, no problem w patties falling apart as others said.  Just be gentle and only flip once.  I didnt have mushrooms so made onion gravy.  (Did not use the butter, just sauteed onions in drippings, then sprinkled the flour over, mixed in and let cook for couple mins, then added broth and brought to boil to thicken)  Only used 1/4 c sour cream, which was plenty to give creaminess and a little extra flavor.  Easy to prepare, and made a good weeknight meal.

Mine didn't turn out well. It came out with too strong of an onion and sour cream flavor.

Very easy!  I needed a low carb meal tonight and just didn't know what to fix.  Went in search of salisbury steak (and have never made it before).  So glad I found this recipe.  Definitely a keeper

I made half the recipe,  I’m not a chef by any means but this was very very tasty! I shocked myself! A few steps to get there but this was worth the effort, a tasty meal.

I cut the recipe in half but kept the rest all the same.  While it had a great flavor and was pretty easy to make I would add a dry binder like breadcrumbs to it not just the egg.  The patties were very wet and hard to keep together when cooking.  Definitely worth trying and will make again!

The rating should really be 4.5. I did change a few things but only because of what I had on hand. I did not have mushrooms and didn't buy b/c I'm the only in the family that eats them. I separated out the gravy and used a jar of mushroom truffle "creme" that contained porcini and button mushrooms as well as truffles.  The flavor was sensational. Additionally, I only had one beef bullion cube. No broth. I made the bullion and added it to some beef gravy I had. Again, delicious. It proved to me that this recipe is versatile enough to work with substitutions if you don't have everything it calls for. 
One suggestion: Recipe says to divide the two pounds of meat into six patty steaks. They were huge! Way too big  to eat in one sitting. Would be good to divide to into 8 patty steaks. Will definitely make this again!

Very easy and delicious.  I made it pretty much as directed but I added more garlic powder and salt and pepper. This would be good with noodles on the side.

Delicious.  Easy.  The only change I made was to double the gravy mixture and thickened accordingly.  WantedWill definitely make it again.  Only one of my patties felt apart into two pieces.

This was super delicious. Whole family loved the flavor. The only substitution I made (which is really rare!) was some hush puppy mix (House-Autry, from NC) for the flour because it had onion flavor and little bits in it, and it still thickened up on the stove. I halved the recipe for just three of us, and they’ve been asking me to make more ever since. Winner!
