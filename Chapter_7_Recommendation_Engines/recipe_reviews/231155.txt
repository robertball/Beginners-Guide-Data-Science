I sautéed 1 large onion and 4 clove garlic first in pan. Then added sausages, ( I used Turkey Sausages Instead of kielbasa).  Brown all and set aside. Then I added cabbage to the same pan. I shredded mine. "Then instead of beer, I added a cup of masala cooking wine, black pepper, no salt as sausage already have salt in it.  After cabbage cooked down, I added browned sausages, onion and garlic...YUM .Let all simmer together for another 15 minutes. YUM, YUM. Pictures to come. HAPPY COOKING

Although this is ok, it's very bland.  Easy to take to 4+ stars with a few adjustments.  Added 1/2 of a sautéed onion, seasoned salt, red pepper flakes, garlic powder, and a little bit of caraway seed.  Kept covered while simmering, stirring occasionally.  This was a really great dish after adjustments were made.

The recipe needed some tweeting: added a whole chopped onion sautéed before adding cabbage for 5 minutes, added garlic power and red pepper flakes when adding the cabbage. Also added two tomatoes (seeds removed) chopped to the last 5 minutes of cooking.

I've been making this for years, minus the beer (using water instead) because we don't drink. This is a favorite, that my grandma use to make. It is a very southern dish. I think a lot of people are missing the simpleness of the recipe. It is meant to "just" be cabbage and sausage, not with all the extra "stuff." Slap some cheese on that cabbage after it's cooked and serve it with corn bread.  Mmm! Delicious.

This was fantastic!! Even my 3 yr old thought it was delicious Yes this is simple and  easy. I used a light beer because that's what I had on hand although chicken stock would be a great option if you wanted something other than water. I did add an onion  only because I like those flavors together.  I saw one review that recommended not using salt and pepper...taste your cabbage just before you serve and make any adjustments then. I also cooked everything together until all the liquid was gone. Served with O'Brien potatoes.

I really enjoyed this recipe. took advantage of suggestions to enhance flavor. Will definitely make again. I added red pepper flakes,garlic powder, seasoned salt, and used turkey sausage. I did not drain liquid but let the beer cook down. Delish.

honestly my kids didn't like it, my husband and I loved it.  I added onions and garlic when sautéing the sausage which happened to be turkey.  Then I saw where someone added sugar and I have seen my gram do this.  I fully planned on doing the same until an idea hit me. The turkey sausage was a little sweet, so I added honey to the cabbage. Tasted great without an over powering sweet taste. I will make this again.

I added some peeled and chunked potatoes, onion and carrots, just because. I also added some apple juice, caraway seeds, garlic salt, bay leaf and a scant pinch of red pepper flakes. A peeled, cored and diced apple would be good instead of  or in addition to the apple juice. Serve with lots of good mustard of your choice.

Loved this! Tweaked it a little. I added some season salt and minced onions. Turned the heat up and let the liquid boil away. Also added a bit of sugar. Very easy and very good.

Used chicken broth instead since I was out of beer (booooo) and served it over mashed taters.  Also threw in a can of carrots for color.  Was tasty!

Yes I made it with changes.  I sautéed 1 onion and 4 garlic cloves in a pan with butter. I added 5 Johnsonville New Orleans Smoked Sausage (Andouille Style), sliced, with seasonings to taste.
Use 1/2 cup of chicken stock and 1/2 cup water. Add 1 head of cabbage cut to your liking. Cook with Low heat until tender.

We loved this made with polish sausage. We use gnocchi and next time we are going to use noodles. My family wasn't a fan of the gnocchi. It's a great fast dinner!

Ok, this is great.   I make it a lot, sometimes with pierogis.  I have to say though, to other reviewers, subbing chicken broth for beer or adding onion is a tweak.  Adding 8 additional spices and food items etc- that’s a whole different recipe!   Not sure why you wouldn’t post it that way.   Personally, I love the original.

I did use bacon grease instead of butter because I had fried bacon for another recipe, and I used all beef kielbasa.  I made enough to fill the largest crock pot (just used to keep it warm)and it was the most popular dish at the church potluck.(about a double recipe).  I didn't have any leftovers and no one seemed to believe that this simple recipe was all I used.  Definitely a keeper and one I will use again.

I took advice from others. Added garlic powder, red pepper flakes & seasoning salt... My husband said it was the BEST cabbage he has ever had. I have to agree! Will make again

I don't always have a beer in the refrigerator so I substituted chicken broth instead and it tastes great. Serve with mashed potatoes for a meal on the table in  under an  hour.

this very good - but from an old Polish recipe Add  sauted onions and some brown sugar along with black raisons.   DELISH with or without beer.

I cooked 1 onion and 3 cloves of garlic first with butter, then removed from the pan.  Then I cooked the sausage in the same pan and Removed.  Next, I added more butter and added the cabbage with alot of pepper and 1 cup of chicken broth. When the cabbage started to soften, I added back in the garlic, onion and sausage.  This was delicious!!!

The recipe was ok but I made some MAJOR tweaks. I sautéed the cabbage with garlic and onion, and added garlic powder, red pepper flakes, hot sauce and a splash of soy sauce and white vinegar when I added the kielbasa. SO GOOD!

Started with bacon then added onion, cabbage and smoked turkey sausage. No other seasonings needed. Very tasty and will make again.

This would have been pretty plain without some adjustments. Made this with onions and garlic to start, as other reviewers suggested. I also only used 1 cup beer, sauteed chopped sausage in a separate skillet, and deglazed the pan with some chicken stock. Then I reduced the liquid instead of draining it. It's still a pretty simple flavor, but with mustard and crusty bread it's delicious!

So we went a little overboard with the recipe, but it turned out amazing. Added garlic, an onion, and a quarter jar of sauerkraut.  Salt and pepper to flavor. Definitely will be making it again soon.

I love cabbage.  I did add some red pepper flakes, fresh garlic and onion.  I sauteed the onion, garlic and sausage in the butter then added everything else.

This was very quick and easy. It turned out great and everyone liked it. I browned the  kielbasa in  a skillet with a little olive oil then added it all to the cabbage. I used dark beer for a little extra flavor.
