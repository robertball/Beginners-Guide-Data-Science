This is delicious on just about anything... Vegetables, salad, noodles, rice. Make a plate with vegetables ( raw or cooked) and rice then top rice with a fried egg and drizzle this over all. Very nice!

Fantastic -- my girlfriend walked in the door and said "wow it smells like Korean food!" I think the key was I used Wang Taste of Korea red pepper powder. I got it at a local Asian grocery store. Try this you won't be disappointed!

Good base recipe because you can adapt per your tastes. I found that this was overpowering for my spinach based salad but i delicious with romaine or green leaf lettuce. I will be making this again for sure, thanks for sharing!

I wanted a robust sweet / tangy dressing that would dress a kale salad well. The original recipe was really good, and my family enjoyed it more the next day, when the flavors melded a bit more.  Still, it didn't have quite the "zip", I wanted for the kale, hence the 4 stars.  I made it again with slight modification - my rating is not based on my changes.  In lieu of the white sugar, I used 2 1/2 Tbs Blue Agave syrup;  I substituted 1 tsp Six Pepper seasoning blend + 1 rounded tsp crushed red chili pepper flakes for the red chili pepper powder; and added 1 tsp minced garlic.  Instead of whisking the ingredients, I pulsed everything in a mini food processor.  As with the original recipe, I suggest making this a day before needed to get the depth of the flavors.

It wasn't the dressing I was looking for but still good. I used red chile paste as a sub for the chile powder. I figured it may be too hot but added just enough spice even the kids ate it. Served with Korean Soba Salad Recipe (Jaengban Gooksu without the soba) which included: 
1 cup mesclun greens OR thinly sliced red and green leaf lettuce
1 English or 2 Kirby cucumbers, thinly sliced
1/2 sweet red pepper, thinly sliced
1/2 apple or Asian pear, thinly sliced
1/4 red onion, thinly sliced
