Something is not right. the dough is super sticky and does not form the cylinders even with flouring my hands. I had to use wax paper to form the cylinders.after refrigerating for over 30 minutes it was still very soft and sticky. after putting the cylinders in the oven, the dough spread out all over the place. after 20 minutes i took them out , tried to cut them(raw in the middle)and put them back in. after a few minutes they were burning. Not good!

The dough set up nicely in said logs, however when cooking, it was very sticky in the middle and did not allow me to cut the logs into smaller pieces.  The dough tastes great when cooked long enough, however the instructions could be much more detailed.

previous reviewer is right, very sticky dough that spreads. I found cutting into long strips and rotating these every few minutes of baking gave evenly cooked biscuits that look like biscotti
