I made this for a baby shower.  I used rainbow sherbet because I couldn't find lemon.  It got lots of compliments and i loved it because it was effortless.  My 6 year old actually made it!

I fixed this punch for a ladies Christmas Party.  Everyone commented that this puch wasn't sweet, and that it was so good.  Everyone liked it, that they all asked me for the recipe.

I could not find strawberry soda, but found raspberry soda and substituted with that. Frozen raspberries. and another frozen fruit mix that i found (which contained pomegranate seeds). Quickly made and much praised.

For something so simple it was amazing!  Everyone raved about it.  It was absolutely perfect.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  We will most definitely be making this for all of our special family gatherings. (My husband hadn't seen sherbet on his list, so we used a little food coloring to tint ice cubes to match the decorations)

So easy to make! The kids really enjoyed it (as did the adults). I couldn't find lemon sherbert, so I used orange sherbert. Very quick - love that!

Love this punch I have been making it for years, I use orange or raspberry sherbet and it is always wonderful. The pieces of strawberries you get in your cup are a nice little surprise! Heavily recommended!!!!
