This was a very tasty cookie. It's not too sweet unlike many cookies. I absolutely love this recipe and it will be a regular here in my abode. I used almond slivers instead of grated almonds. Turned out quite yumm. Thanks for a delicious, perfectly textured, gorgeous cookie recipe! Full moon, new moon, any moon!  This would be DELICIOUS with pecans and pecan or vanilla extract instead of the almond flavor. Especially if you love Pecan Sandies!  I only refrigerated the dough for 15 minutes. The dough seems perfect for molding as soon as you finish blending ingredients.

These were fantastic!  Used 1/4 teaspoon of almond extract.  Can't imagine flavor if only 3 drops.  These were great, would make an awesome Christmas cookie.

I made this and they were really good, although the dough dosen't need to go to the fridge its stiff enough to mold and bake. It is great and healthy. Almost any sugar and lots of almonds thanks!!

Isn't this the same recipe in Cunningham's book, back in the recipe section? Curious to know if you came across a different one, though. Tried the recipe for a full moon rite and everyone loved it! Even my finicky toddler!

I've been making this cookie for years and years, usually at Christmas.  Got the recipe many years ago from my sister-in-law who had a great sense of humor.  Because of the shape she called these "dog doo" cookies and that's what they've been called in my home since then.  I will make the crescent shape, but I also make them round, start with small balls of dough and then slightly flatten them with a fork.  The powdered sugar has some deep ridges to stick to.   Roll them in powdered sugar when they come out of the oven and then roll again if you want more sugar.  I don't use almonds but use pecans instead.  I don't grind them fine but I do "chop" them fine.  You still get bits of pecan when you bite into the cookie.  Overall a wonderful, rich cookie that's excellent with coffee.

I added more extract than recommended and will add even more (1/2 ts) next time. Had some almond sliver left over from something else and they looked like a cup so I threw them in the food processor, ground them up then tossed int he rest of the ingredients. I added a Tablespoon of water to turn it into a workable dough. I really like the old world Christmas cookie flavor. Thank you for posting this.

VERY tasty, I do believe I'll be making these again for Litha this year.  I had to add 2 tbsp milk to make the dough come together, and I used coconut oil instead of butter (which left my hands silky smooth after all the dough shaping I did!) Lovely cookies!

This is perfect the way it is. I have made it several times. Sometimes I forget to add the extract other times I've put in as much as 2 tsp. I use frozen almonds. And pulse everything in my Cuisinart processor. I don't chill the dough and press it into form on cellophane. I use parchment paper to bake on and coat in powder sugar once baked. Family can't keep their paws off them! If you think they are too crumbly add a teaspoon or two of water or milk or an extra egg yolk. It might be a climate thing.

I used pecans because that's what I had and vanilla flavoring but followed the rest of the ingredients.  I rolled them in confectioner's sugar after cooking.  My family really loved these!  Great recipe and so easy.  I didn't have to put them in the fridge either.

These brought back Christmas memories of when I was 7yrs old and my grandma use to make these for the holiday.  I am 43 now and this was a recipe I didn't think existed - but use to adore these.  Thanks for sharing!

Time consuming, because the dough is so dry and crumbly, and you have to form them so very large, not delicate looking. But tasty.

I love these!  I forgot about the step of refridgerating the dough, but they worked well anyway.  I used half butter and half lowfat margarine, and dusted them with more powdered sugar after they cooled.  I also only cooked them for 14 minutes.  Wonderful!

I used about 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract. The mixture was a bit too crumbly for me to work with so I added a bit of water and that helped. I could not get the crescent shape so they looked a bit different and I did roll them in powdered sugar after baking and that not only gave a great taste but made them look better as well. I will make these again.

I gave these a five star but I added 3 tsp almond extract, 1/4 more powdered sugar to the dough before baking and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts, then after they baked I mixed powdered sugar/milk and drizzled it on top of the cookies. They would have been way to dry and bland without it! But now they are so good!

These were very easy to make, although as previous reviewers suggested the dough doesn't need to be in the fridge for so long. Also the flavor was barely there, perhaps  I over processed almonds. Overall I liked this recipe, would do it again

These were really good!  I also didn't have to chill the dough.  I did only two things differently - added more extract, both almond and vanilla - 1/4 tsp. each, and rolled them into balls.  I could of eaten the whole batch myself... it was work not too!

We used walnuts on hand and vanilla extract instead of almonds and almond extract. Taste great. We had to add two more tablespoons of softened butter to make our dough stick together, but that was probably because I had a three year old helping measure the ingredients. She always tapped down the nuts, sugar and flour in the measuring cups.

I doubled the recipe so I could use a whole egg and monkeyed with the ingredients:  Substituted ground oats for 1/3 of the flour to keep gluten low. Also subbed shortening for half the butter.  And I added a few T of amaretto liqueur to punch up the almond flavor.  Very good results.

First time making these and they were so good! I made a few substitutes to make it a little healthier though. I used 1C of whole wheat flour instead of 1.25 of normal flour. Also used coconut oil instead of butter. 1/4t of almond extract instead of 3drops. And added 2t of almond milk. The consistency was hard to shape so I just made little oval shaped ball-type cookies. Then added confectioners sugar once cooled. They are delicious!!

Followed other reviewer and added 1/4 tsp of almond extract.  The almond flavor is much stronger the 2nd day (if they last that long).   Lovely crumbly cookies.  
If you make them the size of a man's thumb (2.5"), it will take 23 min to bake up.  If you make them about 1.5" it takes 13 min per the recipe.  They actually all looked more like brazil nuts rather than crescents.   
When I baked these, the ambient temperature was around 68 degrees and I thought the dough was pliable enough not to require refrigeration, but I did refrigerate 2 hours anyway.

Simply wonderful!  I used a packaged almond flour to save time and agreed with other reviewers about using more almond extract (I used about 1/2 tsp).  I also drizzled a little agave syrup over them once they cooled.  Will make again!

These were very good. They are not super sweet. I used pecans instead of walnuts. I toasted the nuts first to give the cookies more flavor. I dusted them with powdered sugar after they came out of the oven
