I changed this recipe some. I added some onion and celery and used more tomato sauce than called for (because it was the only size can I found). I used more hot sauce than called for and added some cayenne pepper and garlic. I took the sausage out of the casing and cooked it up with some red pepper and added it for the last 30 minutes or so (after shredding the chicken). I tried adding the rice into the creole mixture, but both my husband and I agree, we should have kept the rice separate. I think it soaks up too much of the sauce. It seems a bit too dry when you reheat. It would be better if kept separate until put on your plate to eat. Good base recipe and pretty easy.

This one is a WINNER!!!!!  I seasoned the chicken with cajun seasoning and added chopped jalepeno's (the kind in a jar), omitted the ham and took about a half of a pound of spicy italian sausage out of its casing and put it in with the chicken at the start.  It was super HOT and flavorful!  The dish holds well on low for a long time - the second time I made it it was in the crock for 10 hours before we ate and I couldn't tell the difference.  I do take the skin off of the thighs before cooking, and the meat is so tender it just falls off the bone.  Delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe, Nancy!!!

Very easy and simple to modify to your own taste. I added an extra can of diced tomatoes and a heaping teaspoon of chopped garlic. I HIGHLY suggest using the skinless thigh filets that you can find in the store -no bones, no skin, not so fatty and it isn't as dry as breasts.
Next time I may add some okra or celery and more hot sauce too.
I also followed the advice of serving it over rice rather than combining it in the crockpot.

GREAT recipe for those with busy schedules.  I used chix breasts instead of thighs and place them at the bottom of the crock pot and then lightly seasoned with creole seasoning.  I then put the ham on top and in a bowl, mixed the tomatoes/peppers/paste/onions/hot sauce and poured overall.  Although I was expecting a bit more kick, it didn't have any but my boyfriend prefers a more mild "creole" anyways.  Everyone devored.  Keeping this great recipe for busy days to come...since it's so simple - that gets a five star rating from me all by itself.  Thanks Nancy!!!!

This was wonderful.  I cooked the chicken about 4 hours and took the meat off the bone into large chunks.  I added some red pepper and cajun seasoning to this at the beginning to give it some added spiciness.  Next time, I may use diced tomatoes with green chilis in place of the regular diced tomatoes.

I took the advice of the other Reviewers and added extra spicyness to the recipe by using extra Hot Sauce and Cayenne Pepper.  I had to cook mine on low for 10 hours and I just sauteed the Polish Sausage with some garlic and added it when I was ready to serve the dish.  My Boyfriend and I liked the recipe alot and will make it again. Thanks!

This turned out very well, but I made several changes based on other reviews. No ham... used 1 lb. bulk Italian sausage (hot) and 1 lb. shrimp, and two pounds of chicken breast.  Also, put in a few jalepenos from a can and lots of spices, skipped the green peppers.  Served the rice on the side.  I doubled the recipe quantities and served 10 easily.  This was a hit for the whole group!

Absolutely fabulous!  We added green chiles and used chicken breast, low fat ham and low fat smoked sausage to lower fat and calories.  We will be making this regularly in our house!!

Very quick and easy to make.  Next time, I will use more seasonings, perhaps, crushed red pepper and cajun seasoning to spice it up more.  Not very hot.  Deleted the Ham, and used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and lite Turkey Sausage to make it more Weight Watcher friendly. Approximately 5 points for a serving of one cup.

My fiance and I LOVE this recipe!! I've also made it on the stove and it works just fine, just in less time. I make the rice in a rice cooker and it just means one less step for me to worry about. Then I add the rice to the crockpot at the end. We absolutely love it! Since we live on a tight budget, I always add more rice and tomatoes to make it go a little bit farther.

We really liked this recipie. I used six chicken thighs instead of eight. It really didn't have any spiceyness so maybe next time I will add more hot sauce or chilie powder.

This was good but was in no way spicy enough for my family.  We put Tobasco and jalepeno peppers on everything so we needed a lot more spices.  I think other spices would add a little more kick to it too.

The final result was a greasy, mushy consistency that didn't go over well. The ingrediants were good, and the flavor was nice, but the texture was bad. I don't usually cook with Chicken Thighs/or any bone-in chicken. The chicken fell apart in the slowcooker and the result was a dish with chicken bones floating around. You had to pick through your food before you ate it. If you make this, I would recommend boneless chicken and adding the rice to your plate, not the slow cooker. Very weird recipe.

yummy. added extra tomatoes for more liquid. put rice in pot like original recipe says but cooked rice longer than recipe indicated before adding so didn't soak up too much juice. best to watch pot to make sure doesn't soak up too much liquid & then turn off. I added more spice because we like it spicy.

I made a few changes to this recipe. I used 1 whole cut up chicken, with the fat removed, sprinkled with season all.I added 1 chopped onion,I didn't have green onions, and chopped garlic. I used diced tomatoes with green chilies. I did not use ham or sausage. Cooked the breast and thighs for an hour in the crock pot before adding the legs and wings. The meat started falling off the bone before the onion, garlic and bellpepper was cooked.I had to remove the chicken and let the gravy cook an hour longer, Next time I will just wait an hour before adding the chicken. We just spooned it over the rice. My husband loved it! We are from Louisiana, Cagin Country

Needed a heck lot of help to finally be good.  Unmodified, this recipe is not worthy of the dinner table.  After adding garlic (pretty de rigeur in Creole cooking), paprika, New Mexico Chile Powder, cumin, coriander, more salt,freshly ground pepper, some sugar (I normally never add sugar to anything - but trust me- this needed it because of the excessive acid from the tomatoes), way more hot pepper sauce, and some really good chicken apple sausage, I finally was able to serve this to my family.  Wait a minute - this is no longer the same recipe . . . call mine Creole Chicken II!

Well I liked this but my husband didn't.  I don't think it was due to the changes I made.  Used shrimp instead of chicken; used cajun seasoning instead of salt; added 1 c. chicken bouillon; used low fat Polish sausage.  Even with my changes I felt there was something missing.  Maybe a bay leaf would help.  Unfortunately I won't be making this again.

I feel silly reviewing this because I have made a number of changes, but it is a great great recipe and can so easily be tweaked to suit individual tastes.
I use chicken breast and coat them in a "creole" seasoning blend. I use one whole onion chopped, 1 whole bell pepper choppen, i can tomato paste, i can diced tomatoes (sometimes fire roasted), couple dashed hot sauce, 1 garlic clove, salt. Mix it all up and add the chicken breast. Just before serving I slice up a kielbasa and brown it in a pan then mix it in the crockpot. I serve it all over rice.  My husband LOVES this dish. Definitely a favorite in our house :-)

My family and friends love this but there is a few changes that I make to make it my own.  I use chicken breast and season it with Tony's Chachere's seasonal and some Zatarain's Cayenne Pepper  (amount to your liking).  I also add some celery salt, fresh garlic, a chopped onion and a can of tomato sauce.  I omit ham and Polish sausage I add a chopped link of smoked sausage.  I do not add the rice to the crockpot I serve it on the side but also we like it like a soup it has great flavor!!  I get people from work to ask me to make it all the time!!

Other than dips and chili, this is the best slow cooker recipe we've run across! My husband doubled the tomatoes and accidentally used tomato sauce (and a bit more of it) than tomato paste, but overall, completely delicious. Sausage really makes the dish. We used what we had in our fridge, an apple turkey sausage - yum. Served over rice but would be good over pasta as well. He added about 2T paprika, teaspoon garlic powder, and teaspoon cayenne, which I think is probably what made the dish.

It tastes great and makes an excellent base to work from. I tend to like spice and lots of meat and this more than suited my needs...

This is delicious and one of the best things I have evr made in a slow cooker.  I added 4 slices of bacon, garlic, pickled jalapenos for more spice, celery, and tomato sauce.  I sauteed the bacon first and then cooked the garlic in the reserved grease.  I also thoroughly seasoned the thighs with Creole seasoning.  Terrific.

Fixed this dish for Fat Tuesday and it was delicious.  Used boneless skinless chicken thighs, and lite smoked sausage instead of other sausage.  Added celery, regular onions and lots of fresh garlic.  Also, used the 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes and added the two cups of water. Cooked on low for 7 hours and added a tad of cayane pepper and 1 pound of cooked shrimp one hour before finish.Used leftover white rice form Chinese carryout. Awesome dish!

I fixed this a week or so ago, and my family loved it.  My husband being from Baton Rouge, so was so happy I finally found a recipe that reminded him of where he grew up.  ***Leftovers were even better!

Not good. This was lacking in so many ways. It was more like a bland Middle America version of what was supposed to be a great dish. A lot of additional spices, seasonings & veggies were needed before this became somewhat acceptable. We were not impressed & will probably not make this again.

So this was my wifes favorite slow cooker meal. I loved it as well. I shredded the chicken before I put in the sausage. I also added a few spices towards the end, it really jacked up the taste. 

Oh and it is easy as well....

Excellent with a couple of changes: Sprinkle chicken with Creole Seasoning (Tony's) and salt; use andouille sausage; add bay leaf and 1 c water; turn crock pot to high while your rice is cooking and let steam vent. Skim fat and serve over rice (don't put rice in the crock). My kids and husband LOVED it!

This was very good, I found diced tomatoes with chilies and used that, at first I thought it was too watery, but once I added the cooked rice and let that sit for awhile it became the perfect consistancy.  Thanks so much.  :-)

Good basic recipe.  I've done some tweeking to make it a fammily favorite.  First I skinned the chicken, so it wasn't so greasy. I also added alot more hot sauce, garlic, celery, and a dash of lemon juice.  Great on a cold day.

This score was given but all the people who ate this one. They loved it! I did spice things up a bit by adding some creole spices and some chopped jalapenos. I didn't cook the rice seperately, I used Uncle Bens Brown rice and added it for the last hour of the cooking so the rice didn't pastey. I also left out the ham....I used to live in Louisiana thick in creole country and never heard of anyone cooking with ham so I deleted it. This is one I will make again thanks for sharing Nancy it was a BIG hit!

This was okay.  I added Creole spices.  With the salt content in the ham I wouldn't add the salt this recipe calls for.  Too much work for a slow cooker (having to cook the rice near the end).  I like slow cooker recipes that you throw everything in and forget about it.

I've made this several times and each time I try to add something different.  Last time I added more seasonings (especially Creole Seasoning) and it came out great!  I cooked it for my boyfriend's Cuban family and they loved it and me!  Now they think I can cook - little do they know how simple this really is to prepare.

I was a little leary of using the chicken thighs because I use only boneless, skinless white meat but did it anyway.  It was delicious!  I removed the bones before serving (the chicken had fallen off of them).  I also added my rice uncooked which was even easier and can be done as long as you have at least 2 cups of liquid in the pot.  Definately a keeper!

Well this tastes yummy BUT it is wayyyyy too salty!!! I will definately omit the salt in the recipe next time. There is plenty of salt with the ham and the canned tomatoes and tomato paste. I added a potato to try to capture some of the salt but still is extremely salty. :(

It was tasty!  I cubed chicken breasts and used hot Italian sausage instead of Kielbasi.  Cooked the sausage down and added it about 30-45 minutes before serving, so the sauce absorbed into the meat. I prefer more of a kick but other family members that don't care for food as hot as I do, liked the temp just fine.  Made brown rice on the side instead of mixing it in to the meal. I wouldn't put this on my top fav meals on the site but I will make again.

Made this for dinner tonight; as with one reviewer, I used boneless/skinless chicken thighs to save time.  I panicked when an entire 28oz. can of diced tomatoes got poured in (my helper didn't hear me say to use about half), but the taste was fantastic!  We all love tomatoes in food, so the added taste was great and not overpowering.

I also added some dry Peruvian chile lime seasoning, and substituted a "chef salt" mixture that my mother makes, but won't tell me the recipe for.  Doubled the green onions since we love the bite from those, added in celery (about 4 stalks worth, chopped), and used hot italian sausage instead of Polish sausage.

Definitely was a hit, I'm already getting demands to make it again soon, so I'd say this one gets saved as a favorite!

This recipe is a family favorite.  My kids, who are not fond of creole cooking absolutely love it.  I only made one substitution.  I used 1/2 andoullie sausage and have kilbasi.  That amount was good for the kids, in my opinion, all andoullie is good, gives a great kick to the dish.  I also added a little extra cajun seasoning.  I like "Slap your mama" seasoning.  All in all, great dish, definately a keeper!

Loved it.  First time making it and it was for the office Mardi Gras party.  I would prefer it to be spicier but it had the right kick for everyone to enjoy.  Used diced tomatos with chiles and skipped the green onions because I forgot to buy them.  I also bought spicy sausage and cooked it with the chicken and ham.  I added a cup of water and then just poured on to rice at the end.  Very tasty.

Followed recipe exactly; chicken was juicy and falling off the bones, but we found it a bit bland.  If made again would use spicy sausage and cajun seasoning and/or red pepper flakes.

I really thought that this would be spicier. For us it was actually a bit bland even though I used a 3 pepper rub on the chicken, pan fried it to get the skin crispy and then put it in the crock pot. We liked it and I may try it again but next time I will add rotel tomatoes and some more spice. The chicken was moist but I thought our ham ended up too chewy and so may add it at the end with the sausage next time. All in all a good place to start but not a finished recipe for our taste.

This is a good recipe, even after I screwed it up a bit.  I used WAY more than 2 dashes of hot sauce (this was a good idea).  I also added a little water because the liquid level seemed really low (this was a bad idea).  Everything was cooked through, but just had a little less bite than I expected (my fault for adding water).  Still, this recipe was saved with more seasoning and hot sauce, but I know next time I make it, it's going to have that kick!  Sausage is the best part (I added it in the slow cooker instead of the rice, because it smelled so good.  I wanted that flavor in with the rest of the ingredients)!  Will definitely cook again.

Like many reviewers, I used this recipe as more of a "base" and added flavors to suit my own taste - canned chipotle peppers and chili oil for heat, no green peppers or tomato paste, cajun seasoning, fresh thyme, a few cloves of garlic and some Gumbo file.  Turned out very good, just the right amount of kick.  Will definately make this again.

Try instead of rice, use tortillas and serve as a fajita with grated Chedder cheese and sour cream.

Ehhhh....This came out pretty good, however, I did some tweaking!  I used fire roasted diced tomatoes, added a cup of beef broth, a couple beef cubes, garlic, worcestershire, chipolte chili powder.  I used chicken tenderloins and a whole pack of Healthy Choice kelbasa. It didn't have much of a flavor before this.  Now, that I have more of a liquid based, I would add the rice to the whole pot.

I gave 4 stars because it had a lot of potential. I left out the green pepper-didn't have it on hand. Added a chopped celery rib, 1 chopped onion, substitued a can of Ro-tel Mexican style tomatoes for the big can of tomatoes and paste. It was plenty juicy for us. Added a cup of chopped okra and 3 minced garlic cloves. Preheated my crockpot on high while I browned my chicken, then browned my sausage and veggies and poured over the chicken. It cut the cooking time by one hour by doing that. Also, used creole seasoning instead of salt. It tasted more like gumbo.

Used chicken wings instead of thighs (cut off the tips) because that is what I had. Used stewed whole tomatoes (1/2 can) & 3/4th of small fresh tomato also because that is just what I had (scaled for 4 servings approximately). Turned slow cooker on high for part of the time & low for the rest. Added a box of Zatarain’s jambalaya mix to the chicken. The chicken was so moist it fell right off the bone.

I thought it was good. But the chicken was dry. Next time I will try shrimp instead of chicken. I loved the sausage in it. It was also very easy to make.

This is fabulous! Very adaptable to your own personal preferences. A few additions that we made included adding some shrimp and okra. But the key ingredient that makes this irresitable is Cajun seasoning!

This was a flavorful, satisfying easy to make meal. I used boneless skinless whole chicken breasts. I take them out and shred them at the end. I add the sausage about 45 minutes before serving: I heat the sliced sausage pieces on a dry skillet for 5-7 minutes before adding to the pot. I also recommend serving the rice separately. I use sweet onion instead of green. Cajun seasoning and cayenne pepper are good for this one.

Used Canadian bacon as well as Emeril's Gourmet Sausage. Added additional seasonings to make it a bit hotter. Very good recipe. Made quite a bit.

Good, easy recipe.  I omitted the ham- didn't seem necessary.  Also, I used boneless skinless chicken breasts that I seasoned with a creole seasoning mix and I added chopped celery with the other veggies.  My husband thought this was fabulous- the kids and I thought it was just pretty good, but I will make again.

I made this recipe for a family party and they couldn't get enough of it.  They all wanted the recipe.  I did do one thing a little different.  The chicken cooked so tender it was falling off the bone and since thighs only have one large bone in them I removed the bone and shredding the chickin into smaller pieces.  It worked great!!!

LOVE this recipe!  I used thighs and added hot italian sausage in the beginning, all the rest of the ingredients and added shrimp for the last 10-15 minutes (time it so it's done and not fishy), left out the rice and just poured it over rice.  It's excellent!  I also made it a little more spicy cause I like it hot!  Try this one!

Pretty good crockpot dish.  Thanks to tips from other cooks, I knew to add some more spice.  I used the spicy brand of chopped tomatoes, chorizo sausage, and added some red pepper flakes and chili powder along with the hot sauce.  I also added thyme, garlic, and bay leaf.  Still could have used some heat, but we all had seconds.

I thought this was wonderful. I will certainly make it again but I will add more spice as my family would have preferred it be hotter. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and they just melted in your mouth. I highly recommend this one.

Wow, this is a super recipe!  This is a keeper.  The cream sauce was the best, and you can definately adjust your spice factor on this. I did this per instructions and added pepper flakes to my own serving, even better! Next time I'll add the spice in the cream to blend it in.

I took the advice from previous reviews and used boneless skinless chicken. The dish ended up being very dry. I think you need to have the bones and some skin to give it some grease cause it came out pasty. Great flavor though. Will make again with the wings!

As a man I required an hour prep time rather than the suggested 10 minutes.
My family did not find the recipe "spicy".  It only has 2 shakes of hot sauce.  I 
used breasts rather than thighs because my wife likes white meat.
Different but I think they would have liked regular greasy fried chicken better.
I think the recipe needs a Creole cook to review and add spices to make it 
great.

Delicious. I did have to add another can of diced tmatoes, and I used the diced tomatoes with green chiles. That gave it an extra bite. I had guests over and they absolutely loved it. There were no leftovers and everyone wanted the recipe.

Very good recipe that I will use again - I added an extra can of chopped tomatoes because I didn't think it would have enough liquid without it; also I think the next time, I will add frozen, chopped okra.

Loved It! I used cajun andouille sausage instead of polish and I substituted cajun seasoning instead of salt. My husband gave it two huge thumbs up (and it was one of the simplest dishes I've ever cooked).

Just trying this recipe today,was just wondering if there is a reason you have to cook it on low ?? Took some others advice on adding spices, did rub cajun seasoning on meat  and extra tomatoes and chopped jalapenos...... Smells great,can't wait to try it....

YUMMY! And easy!  I did add some creole seasoning and an extra dash of hot sauce.  I used leftover honey baked ham from the freezer.  I also cooked the rice on the side and served the chicken over it.  Will definitely be making again.  My 3 year old daughter kept saying how good it was and my picky husband liked to.  Win. Win.

One of the best meals I've made in the slow cooker, hands down. I followed the recipe almost entirely, except I added three cups of cooked rice and a few extra dashes of hot pepper sauce. I worried that this recipe might be too bland, but this was not the case. Must be a slow cooker miracle. For a spicier flavor, just add cayenne.

I'm not going to say I followed the recipe exactly, but I was really close.  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs, a red bell pepper, because I didn't have green, a regular onion because I didn't have green, added a couple cloves of garlic, a bay leaf and cooked the rice separately.  I've never had success putting rice in a crock-pot.  I also used a good four or five shakes of hot sauce and half a banana pepper, and it still wasn't spicy at all.  It was good, but not terrific.  I may have to play with it some more.  This was actually much better the second day!  We didn't cook much rice, so we just tossed some brown minute rice in the cooker and turned it back on high for a bit to cook.  Then dished it up for the next days lunches.  I'm eating it for lunch as I write this and I like it more today than yesterday.  I'm still not sure I'd give it a 4 though without work.

This is a definite repeat for our family!  I made some adjustments: used crushed tomatoes (double amount), added Tablespn of garlic, 1 Teaspn of Cajun seasoning, 2 Cups of chicken broth, red bell pepper (instead of green) put the cooked polish in from the start with the chicken and ham, and used 2.5lbs of chicken breasts cut into 2in chunks.  The spice level was SPOT ON for my wife and kids (I'll add some more to my bowl next time for a bigger kick!)

I cooked this on the stove top. Like other reviewers said, it needed more spice - I added Cajun seasoning, more salt and red pepper flakes. I also added some okra, used hot Italian sausage (instead of Polish sausage), deleted the ham and put in some shrimp. Hmmm, hmmm, my family loved it served over cooked rice.

This was awesome! I too made changes,used a couple of cubanelle peppers instead of green, used a sweet onion,4 cloves of garlic(minced),bay leaf,coriander,cumin,ground chipotle pepper and cajun season. I did use the ham and hot italian sausage, that i browned, i also used chicken leg quarters,added frozen shrimp in the last hour.Made rice on the side but used chicken broth instead of water and put some of the cajun spice in there as well. I also used more hot sauce. Believe me the prep is well worth the results! Thanks for an awesome recipe Nancy!!!

Pretty good recipe, quick and easy too! I didn't have time to use the crock pot earlier in the day so I cooked in a medium soup pot, covered, on low for three hours. First I lightly seasoned and browned the chicken (cajon seasoning, garlic salt and lemon pepper) then added ingredients. The chicken was falling apart by the time the sausage was cooked. What I did differently was, I added more than a few dashes of hot sauce, 2 cloves of minced garlic, a bay leaf, and only 3/4 of the can of tomatoe paste. Also threw in a half a bag of frozen sweet corn. I used 2 spicy italian sausage links (removed casings and cut into smaller bites), threw them in the last half hour. I will say that I wouldn't use Johnsonville Italian Hot sausage again. It was good but made the sauce greasy. I also cooked the rice separately in garlic, butter and knorr chicken boullion. I'm sure it would've been too dry if I'd added it. I served ontop of my rice.  My husband and I really liked this dish, and would make again, especially when it's cooler out.

This is a great basic recipe.  I added some shrimp just because I had some in the house.  I can think of lots of variations on this basic recipe that I may try.

Absolutely fantastic-and added to my favs list!  My husband raved on this one. I would add more hot sauce.  Also, I topped with a light sprinkle of Creole seasoning when serving.

I really liked this dish.  I did make a couple of changes, but overall this was a great tasting dish.  I doubled the sauce ingredients and used one can of Rotel as one of the cans of diced tomatoes.  It turned out great.  Also, I thought the dish looked good too.  The reviewer who said that it looked unappetizing obviously does not know what Creole dishes should look like.

Sorry, this dish wasn't very good for me, my boyfriend wouldn't even touch it because it didn't look very appetizing.  It tasted ok but lacked something so I added a ton of Adobo Sofrito and it still wasn't tasteful.  Sorry, won't be making this again.

Mine turned out pretty watery.  Next time I'll add maybe the uncooked rice to the pot and simmer it together from the beginning.  Overall, though, a pretty good crock pot recipe, but not a slamdunk.

It was ok, didnt have any bite that we could taste even after adding more hot pepper as well as other spicey spices. Maybe we'll try it again adding something more.

I prefer my old fashioned way of making jambalaya, but this was a good, easy version.  I had everything on hand and it was great to be able to just throw it all in the crockpot.  The chicken became really tender.  I did add celery, garlic and cajun seasoning at the beginning, omitted the ham, and used spicy chicken habanero sausage in place of the polish sausage.  I also was a little heavy handed with the hot sauce.  I'll definately make this again.

It is soo bland and not enough of flavor! It looked wonderful. BUT I don't really enjoy the dinner since it was so bland. It need more flavor though. I may not cook it again.
