Treat yourself to this healthy and guilt-free, naturally sweet concoction! Not quite a drink, because it's good and thick and at the start, anyway, even requires a spoon.  Delicate in flavor and a delicate, pretty pink. Hubs, who is really the first reviewer of this recipe, not me, declared the taste "wonderful."  His only criticism was that this starts to separate immediately after pouring it into the glass, the slushy part from the liquid part, so it requires continual stirring.  Still, he thoroughly enjoyed two, tall mugs of this!

Very light & refreshing.  I did add a frozen banana & did not have trouble with it separating.  I think I prefer drinking my melon now!

My favorite of them all. Very exotic tasting when you add the mint.

It was really bland until I tripled the orange juice. I may make it again but I'll use a full cup of OJ.

OMG it's so yummy & refreshing.    I'm use combination of frozen & fresh watermelon & cantaloupe, fresh orange juice and agave no ices. Freezing the rest for later.

I threw everything except the agave and mint in the juicer, then added them to the juice and poured into Popsicle molds for morning "juice bars". Great way to reduce juice intake and make sure you savor the flavor. Can't wait for the kids to try tomorrow. A.M. update : My toddler and teen devoured these!

Great way to use up melon.  My kids enjoyed it.
