This recipe was easy and the outcome was fantastic...great texture, good combination of richness & sweetness.
Be sure NOT to turn the fudge top-side down onto cutting board as the pretty marshmellow swirls will stick to it!

Batch turned out great!  Followed directions to the letter.  This makes a very dense, heavy fudge.  Marshmallow swirls didn't really turn out and marshmallow flavor gets lost in all that chocolate.  To me this tastes like eating semi-sweet chocolate chips, so I didn't care for it much. I would use 1/2 semi-sw. and 1/2 milk choc. chips next time.  Also made the "Super Easy Rocky Road" recipe from this site, it uses the same basic ingredients.  Preferred that one much more.

4 stars for taste but I couldn't get the marshmallow layer to "swirl" into the chocolate layer...it set up rather fast, not hard but firm enought that they didn't swirl together.

Very easy to make - but I ended up with a big stickey mess.  Everything seemed to set up just fine, but when I tried to cut it, the marshmallow on top never hardened and stuck to the knife, the waxed paper and my fingers.  Hubby said taste was good - he'll probably eat it out of the dish with a spoon but there's no way I can cut and serve this to my friends.  What a disappointment.

In addition to this recipe, I also made Chocolate Peanut Butter Swirl Fudge.  Neither recipe "swirled."  It had a great flavor, but was very sticky.  I placed pieces of parchment paper in between the layers for storage, and the marshmallow layer stuck to the paper and had to be peeled off.  Despite this, it was tasty, and I'll make it again.  Since it didn't swirl, it definitely did look like snow topped fudge!

Very yummy! When melting the marshmallows, I guess it seized or something because it didn't look good. So I dumped it and improvised. On top of my fudge I sprinkled some white chocolate chips, then set in the refrigerator. 10 minutes later, I took it out of the refrigerator and the chips had melted. I swirled them, then put back in the fridge to finish setting up. Very yummy and rich! Also not grainy, which I totally love.

A huge hit at my Thanksgiving table! People were going crazy over them. I was begged to make them again for Christmas. And the recipe is so easy, I definitely will!

This is a good fudge recipe, although it was very gooey. I wished it had had a more fluffy texture to it. Will make again though.

the fudge was alright, tasted like what it was: melted chocolate chips, which was ok. The marshmallow topping made a mess, was sticky and offered little alteration in taste. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, but was the last to go on a plate of different fudge recipes.

This turned out pretty well but I think it needed more marshmallow. Also, the picture is a little decieving. The Marshmallow mixed with butter does not melt into a pretty white, but a yellowish color, which is what I expected but not everyone may have.

This fudge is really very good.  I couldn't get the marshmallow to swirl as good as the pictue, so presentation wasn't as nice.  Overall Very easy and very good!

Very good fudge, very smooth with no grittiness. I had no problems swirling in the marshmallow topping and it was very easy to cut. With the pecans, it tasted like a rocky road fudge but with all the ingredients mixed in instead of sitting on top. Will definitely make this again.

This was a huge success at a Christmas candy exchange I went to.  My only complaint is that the marshmallow makes the top stay sticky, so you can't stack these at all.  But they taste phenomenal and are really quite simple to make.

This was really easy to make and was quite pretty on the candy platter. It was also quite yummy- though everyone I served it to rated it 3rd place behind "Foolproof Chocolate Fudge" and "Tropical Candy Clusters" (which I prepared without the candied pineapple the recipe called for). All three recipes were from this site and were served alongside peanut brittle, almond brittle, cashew brittle, chocolate covered almond brittle, gingerbread men and pecan pie. Of the three chocolate candies, this one was rated last, but everyone still really loved it. It was a little sticky to handle, but I had no problem getting the swirly effect with the marshmallows. It was super easy to make and was quite pretty- even if it wasn't THE #1 tastiest. Still a nice addition to a candy platter. Great recipe.

This is a very good quality fudge recipe-not grainy. I agree with other reviews about the marshmallow not spreading.  I will probably leave it off next time.

NOTE: I microwaved the chips and milk and that seems to have been a mistake because it was harder to swirl in the marshmallow topping. It's more or less swirled in and serves as a topping for the fudge. 
This recipe was not a failure it just wasn't perfect or pretty like the picture. Good for that beginner looking for something a little more complex but still simple.

I found this recipe to be perfect. Quick, adaptable, easy and tasty. I made this for a New Year's party and it was a big hit.

I did adapt this recipe a bit, using 2 cups of dark chocolate chips and one of semi-sweet, but I have a fondess for dark chcolate.

Thank you so much for this recipe. It's a keeper.

Fudge is very good, but marshmallow mixture does not swirl into the fudge easily and sticks to the waxed paper.

This is a really simple and yummy fudge to make.  Also it is very pretty and makes a wonderful gift.
