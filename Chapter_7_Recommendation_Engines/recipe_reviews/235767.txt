These are great!  To make them lower in carbs, I used one third each of reg flour, almond flour and oat flour.

These didn’t change much in size from the point at which they went into the oven until they came out, simply didn’t rise or spread out much.  They are small, one bite, and I expected (and would like) a little larger cookie, so I would use tablespoon size instead of teaspoon in the future.  I followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of adding a little orange extract to the glaze since I could taste no orange flavor at all.  These cookies are somewhat rustic-looking, and the cranberries and the cashews give them a slightly chewy texture.  These may not be the prettiest cookies I’ve ever made, but they are tasty.

I tried this recipe because I wanted to use up some leftover holiday ingredients. I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed them. The cookies are soft and have just the right balance of sweet with the tartness of the cranberries.

These cookies are almost perfect as the recipe is written, but due to diet restrictions within my family, I had to cut down on the sugar and omit the icing in order for them to be enjoyed by all.  I substituted Splenda for a bit more than half of the sugar...the cookies were still perfect!
