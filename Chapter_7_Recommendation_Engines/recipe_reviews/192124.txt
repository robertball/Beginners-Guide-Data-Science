This was pretty good! I did not use BBQ sauce though (not a fan), instead I put a little salt & mayo.  Next time I will use Texas Toast for a thicker bread.  (I pan seared some boneless skinless chicken breasts first. Seasoned with sea salt & paprika. Then sliced them in half.)

Delicious! I had a lonely little piece of leftover grilled chicken breast and this was the perfect way to use it up! I love chicken cordon bleu and this was a nice twist on that classic dish. I used thick sliced bread which I highly recommend and this turned out fabulous - perfect with a side of kettle cooked chips and a deli pickle.

I made a few changes to this, but kept with the Cordon Bleu tradition of chicken/ham/swiss.  Instead of cooking a chicken breast, I went the easy route and used fresh deli sliced chicken.  Also omitted the BBQ sauce.

Good recipe, easy to make.  I believe I'll cut the chicken into strips next time.  I recommend using high-quality sliced deli ham.  We used sliced sourdough bread and that worked well.

Absolutely delicious.  Those who have changed it so much shouldn't review it.  Instead, put it as a revised recipe.  Spot on Celeste.  I can't wait to have it again!

Excellent recipe and idea! (It is now in the rotation of meals to choose from.) Add some fried potatoes, a vegetable and a salad and you got a meal! Thank you, Celeste.

This is a great. quick and easy, tasty recipe. I began making these sandwiches several years ago when we started buying pre-cooked chicken breasts from Sam's. The only part of the recipe I haven't tried was adding the BBQ sauce. Everyone I've made this sandwich for loved it.

Outstanding recipe! The BBQ sauce is what makes the sandwich and gives it the extra special taste, try Sweet Baby Ray's.

Very good! I used sourdough bread and deli-sliced chicken breast.  I'm sure it would have been great with the barbecue sauce, but I was in a dijon mustard mood so I used that (nice spicy one! I actually often add a little to the bechamel-type sauce I serve when I make chicken cordon bleu, so it worked well for us!)  This was a very hearty and satisfying sandwich, and best of all it was ready in about 10 minutes! Thanks, Celeste!

I was looking around the site for a "different" sandwich and came upon this.  I was not sure about the BBQ sauce, but, after reading other's comments, I used it.  The sandwich was DELICIOUS!  I DID take the advice of another reader and I used Texas Toast.  It was very good and I will be making this again.

YUM!!!  The BEST warm sammie I've ever had!!!  My hubby & 3 kids all asked for seconds!  That is a feat in and of itself for them all to like my dinner concoctions!  Almost passed on the BBQ sauce but that is what MADE the sandwich.....gave just a little kick for your taste buds!

My family LOVED this. My girls asked if we could have it again. It was so quick and easy to make. I used a thick piece of Italian bread being as the chicken was thick. I also sliced the chicken breast so it would fit better on the bread.

This sounds delicious, except for the barbecue sauce.  I will try it with and without it, when I make it to see which I like the best.

My family and I really enjoyed this but I especially enjoyed how easy it was to make. The only (minor) change I made was that I used shredded chicken since that is what I had on hand.

Instead of BB sauce I spread either a Tomatoe pesto or a Basil pesto sauce for a more sofisticated taste.
Great on a pannini press.Low cal substitute Tomatoe wraps instead of bread. Very delish!!

This was a hit!  I was expecting a jazzed up grilled cheese but got so much more.  The chicken along with the ham and cheese combination on freshly grilled bread is so satisfying.  The bonus came with the flavour of the bbq sauce...it was a nice sweet surprise.  You could easily change up the bbq sauce for a personal preference..I might try a steak sauce next time...Thank you Celeste...we enjoyed it.

This is a nice change of pace sandwich that was well received at our house.  I had some pepperjack to use up so subbed that for the swiss.  I used Famous Dave's Sweet and Zesty BBQ sauce, which was a nice addition.  I also used sourdough bread, which I feel is a great choice for this sandwich.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Celeste!

I did not have cooked chicken breast on hand (it was all in the chicken soup I made for dinner!), I used sliced chicken deli meat instead. I made no other changes. Though I did not try this sandwich for myself, my husband and kids liked it. My husband made a remark that he thought this would have been better without the barbeque sauce.

yum! I took some seasoning blends that I had made up from another recipe ((sorry, have no idea what the blend is)) and coated chicken breasts with it. Grilled them on the George Foreman, adding the ham and cheese. Kids wanted mayo, husband coats all in ketchup and I did the BBQ sauce. All were happy. Such a simple idea but I sure never thought of it! Thanks!!
