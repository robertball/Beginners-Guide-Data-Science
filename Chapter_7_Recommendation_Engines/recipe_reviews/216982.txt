I followed the recipe exactly except that I left the peel on and I enjoyed these very much. I garnished with parsley and next time I will add some pepper. This was a very nice side dish that would compliment many main dishes.

A great concept! I added a dash of ground mustard and some tumeric for extra color. Sprinkled with paprika to plate.  Beautiful,  fun, unique and delicious.

I adored...hubby just ate.  Gave the taters a real pleasant flavor...and something different.  Makes me wonder what other additions to potatoes would be good.  Thanks for a great unique recipe!

I made a single serving of these using 1 potato and 1 tbsp of mustard (as per AR conversion).  I agree with other reviewers the flavour is a bit understated.  I will try adding a bit more mustard next time.  Fresh ground sea salt was very nice on these.  I served it with ham and sauteed cabbage.  Would be great with corned beef also!

This recipe was okay. I loved the idea of it - we are mustard loving people in my family! The flavor was very understated, and only seemed to permeate the outer layer of the potato instead of permeating all the way through. I think that I might try this again with diced potatoes instead of halves, and perhaps a little mustard powder added to up the flavor.

I was excited to try this easy recipe, but was very disappointed. The potatoes tasted like plain boiled potatoes. I even added some spicy mustard to the recipe and still didn't get any flavor.

Pretty good.  Maybe add little dry mustard or salt

This recipe makes for some very flavorful potatoes. However, simmering the potatoes for 25-30 minutes did not get them done enough for me. I would recommend boiling the potatoes for a longer time than is listed in this recipe. Also I don't see the need for peeling the potato skins. Yukon Gold potato skins are delicious. All in all the combination of salt and mustard gives the potatoes a flavor that is dynamite!

Recipe Group: I enjoyed the subtle flavor of these potatoes. Not a whole lot different from regular boiled potatoes, but different enough for me, and prettier on the plate. I think I would enjoy smaller pieces next time though; faster cooking and more flavor in the middle of the potato. I sprinkled with salt, pepper and dried parsley. Tasty and easy, thanks for the recipe AbsintheMinded!

Made this for Recipe Group...These were fine, but we thought that they really lacked flavor. The mustard taste was only slightly there (I used more mustard than called for), and they def need more salt than called for, IMO. I may try to play around with this more because I really like the idea. Thanks for sharing. :)

This was pretty good. I cut the potatoes into smaller pieces so it would cook faster and I used a little more mustard than it called for. My 5 year old, son who is a picky eater, LOVED these. I'll make them again just for that reason. :) Thanks for the recipe!

OK, would have given these a 5 rating BUT, made them twice, with two different batches of potatoes. For some reason ( and yes I cooked the heck out of them) my potatoes would not soften up.  Not sure if it is suppose to do that or was just dumb luck, bad mustard?  I did though liked the flavor.  I am guessing that mustard potatoes will just have to become a memory for our family. lol

As others have said, mustard flavor is just too mild. Plus it’s hard to make boiled potatoes that aren’t dry, even with plenty of butter. Maybe if they were mashed, they would be better. I like the idea if the mustard flavor, but I wouldn’t make this again.
