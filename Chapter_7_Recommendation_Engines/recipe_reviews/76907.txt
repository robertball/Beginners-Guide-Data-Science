What a great recipe!  I cut both sugars to a 1/2 cup each, substituted 3/4 cup apple sauce + 1/4 cup oil for the 1 cup oil recommended.  They aren't oily at all this way! I have doubled and quadrupled the recipe so I could put a couple dozen muffins in the freezer before and since my son was born.  They freeze great!  The muffins I've kept out have been moist and delicious.  Everyone asks for this recipe.  Enjoy!

Yummy, adaptable recipe!  I had carrots and oats on hand, but not much else.  I omitted all the extra stuff: raisins, coconut, pineapples and the cream cheese addition, and the muffins were moist had a good texture still.  I followed the other reviews and replaced some of the oil with applesauce.  Even good the next day! Thanks!

I run a kitchen at a retreat center and we have modified this recipe as a coffeecake (we just swirl in the cream cheese before baking). It is one of our most requested recipes. Thanks for a fantastic recipe.

These muffins were very moist and light! 4 stars because I felt that they were a little bland and needed more spice.

Following other reviewers' advice, I used 3/4c unsweetened apple sauce and 1/4c vegetable oil, and reduced brown and white sugars to 1/2c. I also plumped the raisins (boil in water for a few minutes), used whole wheat flour, and added more cinnamon, nutmeg, ground ginger, and cloves to give it a spicier taste. I also used a combination of whipped and flavored cream cheese for a quick cream cheese filling. Tasty! Will make again!

These were wonderful.  I used other reviewers' suggestions, and reduced both sugars and used applesauce instead of oil and they were superb.  Also omitted the cream cheese center but might try it sometime.  The 2nd time I made these, I forgot I didn't have any pineapple and just added more carrots, raisins, and coconut.  I keep getting asked for the recipe!  And, my Dad (who NEVER likes "sweets" like this) wanted these as his 60th birthday treat.  What a wonderful compliment!  Thank you!

This yielded excellent results.  I skipped the cream cheese center (hubby has prostate cancer so I eliminate dairy fats as much as possible).  Still turned out great.  I was very generous in my measurements of carrot and pineapple.  Added a dash of nutmeg, handful of ground walnuts.  I bet with the cream cheese these are awesome but feel free to skip that part to reduce fat - you'll still get a terrific muffin.

Love these muffins!  I also used 3/4 applesauce and 1/4 oil, instead of 1c oil, and the muffins were the perfect moistness and sweetness.  I did use a bit less sugar  though (about 1/2 cup of each sugar), I used sweetened applesauce so I wasn't sure how it would affect the sweetness.  Made some with the cream cheese middle, didn't think it added that much but it tasted fine.  I might not have used enough of the filling to make it noticeable enough.  The filling did not seem to affect the texture or consistency of the muffin.

Delicious muffins!  I made them a bit healthier by substituting 1/2 cup of applesauce for 1/2 cup of oil.  Also, I wish I would have listened to the other reviews who said to skip the cream cheese.  It doesn't really add much to the muffin.  Next time, I'll skip the cream cheese centre and top some with cream cheese icing if I want a sweet treat!

Great recipe! Don't overfill muffin tins (stick to 2/3 full), as they do not "puff" on top, and the collapsed tops aren't as attractive.  Delicious, relatively healthy as muffins go, and freezes well- just reheat in microwave 35 seconds on 50% power.  Thanks, Shonan!

I think this recipe has great potential.  But I made it exactly as described, and found it REALLY oily.  I mean, I like a moist muffin, but I don't want it to soak through the napkin! There was no noticeable spice/flavor, the coconut was lost in everything else, and although the cream cheese wasn't bad, it didn't really do anything for the muffin.  Also, please note that these muffins DO NOT RISE well.  So don't overfill the muffin cups in hopes of nice muffin tops - they'll spread flat across the top.    That being said, with much less oil, at least double the spice (and perhaps additional spices, as others suggested), this could be a nice muffin.  I will definitely try again, with modifications.

These are delicious and I will make them again, soon, but will leave out most of the oil as they were too "greasy" for our tastes. I added about 1/4 cup of flaxseed meal for part of the all-purpose flour--great tasting!

Best muffins ever! And so healthy. I cut both sugars down to 1/2 C and felt it was plenty sweet. Used 2 large eggs with no issues. 3/4 C unsweetened applesauce and 1/4 C canola oil, rather than a full cup of oil. Used golden raisins (I prefer them.) Contrary to what other reviewers have said, I LOVED the cream cheese layer in the center. I do think the measurements for the cream cheese are way off - I used half-block cream cheese with just a tiny bit of pineapple juice to soften it up. Otherwise is was very watery, and I wanted it more thick. These muffins freeze well, and you can feel good about eating them. Thanks for the recipe Shonan!

I had carrots, pineapple, and cream cheese to use but didn't want to make a cake.  This popped up on an ingredient search.  I thought they were really good, but I did make some changes.  I subbed plain greek yogurt for half the oil, and the oil I used was an orange-infused olive oil.  To complement that, I also added some orange peel.  I used all whole wheat flour and toasted coconut.  For the spice, I added cardamom, nutmeg, and allspice in addition to the cinnamon...total of about 1- 1 1/2 tsp.  I finely shredded my carrots based on other reviewer's comments, and I recommend that.  I also added a good dose of vanilla.  They took longer to bake for me, but they turned out moist and dense like a carrot cake, and I am happy with them.  As others have noted, these do not rise like a traditional muffin, and the tops are flat.  That doesnt' bother me at all, but take note if you like the high muffin tops.  Next time I make them, I think I'll cut back on the sugar a bit and sweeten the cream cheese filling a little.  The pineapple juice didn't really flavor the cream cheese, and I'd leave that out next time.  If you like carrot cake, you'll like these muffins!  They are a keeper for me.

After juicing 4lbs of carrots I had tons of carrot pulp and went looking for recipes.  This is my new favorite carrot muffin recipe!!!  I ate the batter straight out of the bowl, raw eggs and all!  
I omitted the cream cheese centers and replaced the oil with applesauce (reduces the fat).  
It's sweet and cinnamon-y, which we love at our house.  I look forward to trying this same recipe with pumpkin!

Made these delicious muffins several times.  I cut back the sugars to 1/2 cup each, and used all purpose flour. The first time I used 1 cup of each whole wheat and white flour and thought it took away from the moistness of the muffin. Carrots, pineapple and raisins are a must, but if you haven't any coconut, it won't hurt any.  As far as mixing the cream cheese with the pineapple juice, I just cut the cream cheese into little cubes and pushed them down into the center of the muffin before baking. These are by far the best muffins I ever made.

I just made these and they were DELICIOUS, even my picky 14yr old that hates almost everything lived them!!! I followed other's advice and cut both sugars to 1/2 cup each, 1/2 cup oil and added one little snack sized cup of applesauce. I also used the bagged shredded carrots as I had some left over in my fridge. They are moist and yummy! Next time I think I will add a little ground flaxseed for a little boost.

These are excellent muffins. To make them vegan and a little more healthy, I substituted mashed silken tofu for the eggs (1/4 cup per egg) and applesauce for half of the oil. I omitted the cream cheese and had no pineapple on hand, so I added a splash of orange juice to compensate for the moisture and tangy flavor. Each recipe made 12 muffins for me, and I quadrupled the recipe to feed a 50-person co-op house. They were gone after just a few hours! The muffins are super moist and delicious. NOTE: I also made these again, substituting in unsweetened cocoa powder for the white flour, adding chocolate chips instead of raisins, and making all the same omissions/substitutions as mentioned before. DELICIOUS!

Made some changes.  Everything is the same except: all brown sugar no white sugar, 1 cup of applesauce and no oils whatsoever, 2 tsp of cinnamon, no coconut, no raisins, no cream cheese, and 1 1/2 tsp vanilla.  Husband loved it.  Will be a keeper but will try it will white sugar along w/the brown sugar.

I give this recipe 5 stars, even though what I made was different that the original recipe.  Like others, I used all whole wheat flour, 3/4 c applesauce & 1/4 cup canola oil, increased the cinnamon and added cloves and ginger, and omitted the pineapple, coconut, raisins, and cream cheese.  What I got was a super healthy, moist, filling, delicious muffin!  Thanks for the recipe! (and for the suggestions by the reviewers!)

These really hit the spot.  My kids are eating them up quick!  The only differences in my batch of muffins is: I used all white whole wheat, I cut back a little on the sugar, I used applesauce instead of pinneapple (only cause I didn't have any) and I blended the cream cheese with orange juice.  YUMMMMMM!

Awesome! I also left out the cream cheese and pineapple, added pumpkin pie spice, and used 1/2 c. of each white and brown sugars. Would normally subsititute for the oil, but didn't have applesauce on hand. Loved 'em!

These were very good. I prepared the ingredients the night before so all I had to do was mix the dry and wet ingredients in the morning and bake.

I have long looked for a muffin recipe to use the pulp from my juicer that I like.  Instead of the 2 cups carrots, I used 2 cups of the pulp which included carrots, apples, beets, lemon, ginger root, jicama, even celery.  OMGosh, these are fabulous!  Next time I may try to make them a little "healthier" by using applesauce in place of some of the oil and by cutting the sugar slightly, but for now, they couldn't be better!

I wanted a muffin with substance and this was it. I had everything in the pantry to make these. The recipe was well written with easy to follow instructions and the ingredients are amazing. I made two batches. I took some to a neighbor and as I was walking by the mailman asked what the great smell was in the basket, so I gave him one too. These are a definite keeper. They don't leave you wanting more and you can feel good about eating these because they're so healthy. So a big thank you goes out to you westcoastmom from me, my neighbour and the mailman.

This is my recipe, it is a very old recipe now! My original recipe said to use unsweetened coconut and unsweetened pineapple, so that is what I use! I have also been making it with 3/4 cup of oil. You would not need all the oil if you use all white flour, the whole wheat flour absorbs more moisture so it needs the extra oil (or oil substitutes) as well as the unsweetened coconut being drier and absorbing more moisture. I came up with the cream cheese on the inside so that I can pack it in lunches and get a carrot cake type snack that was easily transportable! Thanks to all who have tried this over the years!

I changed these up based on what I had in stock.  I used 1/3 white flour, 1/3 whole wheat flour, 1/3 spelt flour (spelt adds a little nutty flavor).  Instead of 1 c. oil, I went 1/2 c. oil and 1/2 c. milk.  Also added:  1/2 tsp. coconut extract, 1/2 c. ground flaxseed, and 1/2 c. walnuts.  Skipped the cream cheese filling, pineapple, raisins, and coconut because I didn't have any of these.   I just loved them.  They are my new favorite muffin. Thanks for such a great base recipe.

I'm giving this 5 stars even though I changed some things, because I think it's a great recipe to start with and so easy to customize.  I was looking for a way to get more fruit and veggies into my kids, so I did all the basic "healthy" changes as noted by others:  used all whole wheat flour, added about 1/4 cup ground flaxseed, cut back on the sugar (1/2 cup each), used 1.5 tsp cinnamon and added 1/2 tsp nutmeg, subbed unsweetened applesauce for 1/2 the oil, and didn't do the cream cheese filling (it sounded good, but honestly I was feeling lazy).  The muffins have a nice taste and texture, though next time I think I'll grate the carrots more finely and also shred the coconut more in the food processor, because the long strands of each were a bit unappealing in the muffin.  I think carrots grated on a box grater would be the perfect "shred" size, but I used my shredding disc on the processor and they were kind of big.   The verdict:  both kids INHALED them!  I have a fairly picky 16-month-old who is not a big veggie fan and she was shoveling handfuls of muffin into her mouth.  Score! 
P.S.  they also froze very well, although I didn't really need to freeze them as the kids are eating them so fast.

These were very yummy! I took them to a breakfast playdate where they were enjoyed by adults and kids alike! As per other reviews, I added a pinch of nutmeg and substituted some applesauce for the oil (about 1/3) and they turned out delicious! Will make again soon!

I found muffins similar to these at a grocery store bakery years ago, and have been looking for the recipe ever since. Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Delightful muffins that can be changed up easily to meet different tastes.  I totally forgot to add the oatmeal and it didn't make any difference except maybe in the fiber content!  I didn't plan ahead and soften the cream cheese but I cut the cold block into small cubes (like dice sized) and just added them to the partially filled cups.  Worked fine!  Delish!

These muffins were a hit around the office!  We are all trying to eat a bit healthier and watch our calories so I made a few adjustments.  Instead of using 1 cup of canola oil I used 1 cup of unsweetened apple sauce and only 1 1/2 tablespoons of canola oil.  I omitted the raisins (simply because I don't like them) and didn't bother with the cream cheese centre.  Turned out great and I have saved this recipe for future use.

Wow!  I used the apple sauce and minimized the oil and  sugars as noted in another review.  These were just perfect. A definite main stay for our house.

Super easy recipe. I cut the sugars to 1/2 cup, and added half apple sauce for some of the oil. I omitted the coconut & raisins because I didn't have them on hand. I also added some ground flax seed with the oats.  I reduced the cooking time by 5 minutes because my oven cooks hot. These muffins are healthy & delicious! The cream cheese in the middle is what makes them so good!They aren't dry or flavorless at all! Wonderful muffins!

I was a little skeptical about how my family would receive a "fruit-cocktail" type of muffin, but they really liked it! :) We ate the muffins cold, and though they were good that way, they'd be better warm. I omitted the cream cheese and coconut and used 3/4 cups applesauce and 1/4 cup oil instead of 1 cup oil (hence the 4-star rating). Fun recipe to try!

Awesome muffins! I followed the recipe exactly with the following exceptions: Lowered the amount of sugar, used applesauce instead of oil and left out the coconut due to personal preference. These were plenty sweet, so next time I'll lower the sugar to 1/2 cup total. They came out so moist and sweet, and I experimented with putting cream cheese in only a few. Both versions are delicous! Boyfriend also gives two thumbs up! Will put into my regular rotation.   :)

I followed the advice of others and used 1/2 cup each of the sugars and 3/4 cup applesauce for part of the oil, and made the cream cheese a little thicker.  My son refused to try them at first after helping me make them because he didn't think he liked the combination of ingredients used, but I eventually coaxed him into it.  He loved them!!  Thanks for the recipe!

These were very good.  I even added 1/2 c. of chocolate chips to offset all those fruits and veggies.  Have to have something chocolate in there :)  They are maybe a little greasy, so I'll do the 1/2 applesauce next time.  Skipped the cream cheese.  Very yummy.  Will make again. Wish they would dome up a bit more as they are flat tops.  Make sure you grease the top part of the muffin tin.

I left out the cream cheese filling and halved the sugar. If I were to make them for guests, though, I would probably only cut the sugar by 1/4.

My only complaint is that these were a little greasy, so next time I will cut back on the oil.

Really excellent. Everyone loved them! Left the raisins out because the family won't eat them. Didn't use all the pineapple juice--the filling would have been way too runny. Might add walnuts next time.

Yummy, I doubled the recipe and omitted the rasins, creamcheese, coconut and pineapple... no need to add those this muffin will stand on its own without all those. I did add in 3/4 cup of milk to bring the batter to a moist muffin.

This is a 2 thumbs up muffin recipe. I made it as written, except I did not use the cream cheese (lactose intolerant). I made a double batch because I like to have some for the freezer and they turned out excellent. Thank you westcoastmon these are a keeper.

Not too bad, I liked that they weren't sweet!  I took advice on the adjustments, here's what I did...
cut sugars down to 1 cup, added 2 tsp of nutmeg, doubled the cinnamon, cut the oil to 1/4 cup and added 3/4 cup orange juice. I did not add the pineapple, but next time I will.  I also let the raisins soak in water to plump a bit. I will also omit the coconut next time to see if there is a difference, I have my doubts.  I also doubled the baking soda, filled the cups (I used mini  tins as well).  The result was nice, puffy muffins!

I didn't have pineapple or coconut when I made this recipe, so I tossed in some chopped nuts and chopped dried apricot instead.  It came out lovely, and the muffins I froze and later defrosted were even better.  I didn't worry about putting the cream cheese in the middle, just spread it on top.  Very nice!

These are delicious, but they were super soft and took forever to bake through. I followed the recipe exactly (which I actually rarely do), and they were still hard on the top but mushy in the middle.

Great recipe! I tried it as a way to sneak more veggies into my 21-month-old twins and it worked! :) I replaced half the oil with applesauce and skipped the cream cheese, coconut and pineapple. They turned out great; all four of us loved them!

Made with or without the cream cheese & pineapple filling... always gets great reviews and requests for the recipe. I've altered the recipe by using canned carrots, pureed; and another time cooked carrots mashed with a potato masher - both were great!

I made this muffin exactly as the recipe noted.  Overall they were really good.  A good texture and flavor.  In my opinion they are best cooled and eaten the next day.  The cream cheese effect is a little odd when it's still warm.

I had very high expectations for these muffins but they fell a little short. They were incredibly moist, I followed many other suggestions and used 3/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil. However, they were bland. I wanted to taste a sweet cream cheese filling and it just was not there!

My husband, two year old, and I can't stop eating these. Our favorite version is using 2 c whole wheat pastry flour, 3/4 c applesauce & 1/4 c oil, adding 3/4 c chopped walnuts and a little shredded zucchini, and leaving out the cream cheese filling. We spread them with a little honey butter...so good! And I don't feel guilty eating them either :)

These muffins were awesome! They are very moist and flavorful. My one peice of advice would be not to store them in an airtight container because they will get too moist. Just wrap them lightly with foil or plastic wrap. I also reduced the oil by 1/2 and substituted more applesauce.

Truly delicious, even without the cream cheese filling (I ran out of time).  I also made 1 change: I discovered half way through that I only had 1/2 C of oil, so I added a 1/2 C of melted butter.  I made the muffins for a pajama party (the next morning), and they were a huge hit.  Moist, flavorful, fabulous!  I will make these again and again.

I made these recently because I had some carrots that really needed to be used. These were really good! I did leave out the cream cheese filling (sigh) but that would have definitely been the icing on the cake. I used all whole wheat flour and splenda. They stayed moist the enitre time.

This is a great recipe.  I followed MAGNIFICAT's advice and boiled the raisins, used applesauce and less oil, (all I had was cinnamon applesauce and that turned out fine,) less sugar, and added spices.  These were perfect with the applesauce in place of oil--I can't imagine how greasy they'd be if I'd used the full amount of oil.  Also, I just put in a few extra spices--I think I will use more next time--they just had a hint of spicy-ness with what I had added.  (I'm glad I added some spices.)  Also, I added chopped pecans--YUM!  I didn't mix the pineapple juice with the cream cheese, and I wish I had--or done something with the cream cheese--I was just trying to save some time.  If you don't mix in the pineapple juice--you get pretty much what you'd expect--a lump of cream cheese in the middle of the muffin, (which is still good, but would be better thinned and sweetened by the pineapple juice.)
Also, I'm not a huge chunk-pineapple fan, but the muffins come out not tasting like pineapple, and the pineapple makes them sweet/moister, and gives it a nice texture.  Great muffins!  My husband and I love them.

Delicious!  I omitted the coconut and cream cheese, used less sugar and oil and these were very yummy!  Also added chopped walnuts, cran-raisins, and a cup of pumpkin (instead of the applesauce that other's used.)  Increased the oats a bit more and added flaxseed and wheatgerm to the mix!  Great mix of flavors!  Thanks!

Delicious. Modified with pureed ingredients for my toddler who will sometimes refuse anything with color. Also followed other reviews suggestion to cut back on sugar and replace oil with applesauce. Very dark muffins that looks like they would be tough, but they were delicious!!

Ohh Soo Good! I even cut back some of the juice that went in the cream cheese mixture to keep it thick, and put even bigger globs in the center of the muffins - and it stayed as a creamy cheese center! They didn't even last a day between my husband and I!

We loved this recipe.  Very moist and delicious.  I did not have wheat flour so I used all-purpose instead.  I also cut back the sugar a bit and did not do the filling...and they turned out great.  I have already made them twice.

I loved this recipe, as is, but to make it even better I substituted  for the white flour, a cup of almonds crushed in a blender. I added more cinnamon, some powder cloves, nutmeg and fresh grated ginger.  I skipped the oil but cored and blended two apples and one cup of greek yogurt. Instead of the sugar I added a cup of diced dates and a cup of chocolate chips. I skipped the pineapple and cream cheese, although fresh pineapple would be good.

These muffins are delicious, the recipe adapts  well to what's on hand, or taste preferences. I immediately soaked the oatmeal in pineapple juice and buttermilk (i used vinger in my skim milk for the buttermilk). I  did not use any white sugar and only used a half cup brown sugar. For the oil i used half cup unsalted butter,  1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce and a 1/4 cup greek vanilla yogurt. I added nutmeg, cloves and ginger along with the cinnamon which i  increased. I shedded an extra carrot increasing to 2 1/2 cups carrots and used a granny smith apple as well (about 1 cup) , i added dried cranberries and walnut plus a 1/4 cup flax seed. The muffins came out light just right sweetness with a great punch of healthy benefits. They have stayed nice and moist for 3 days now, i did notice that the muffins did not rise high but the mini loaves had a better rise to them. Lastly i froze several loaves for future meals, breakfast on the go. Thanks for a great base recipe

Followed the advice of others and replaced 2/3 a cup of oil with applesauce. Didn't have pineapple or cream cheese, but the muffins were very tasty without. Probably won't worry about it next time either. My muffins rose very nicely. Definitely using this recipe again.

I forgot to add the white sugar... But they still tasted pretty sweet, probably because of then pineapple.  I did not have coconut, and did not bother with the cream cheese filling.  It made about 16 large muffins.

I worked with the ingredients I had on hand and made a couple of adjustments and will provde recommendations as well.  
I made slight modifications to ingredients: 2 cups of whole wheat flour, 2 1/2 cups of shredded carrots (pulp from juice extractor), 1 cup applesauce, 1/4 cup veg oil, soaked raisins in warm water for about 10 minutes before adding them to mixture, reduced white sugar to 1/2 cup, 1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder, 3 tablespoon cinnamon, and 3 tablespoon vanilla extract. 

I followed directions with the filling but was a bit dissapointed. I would highly recommend adding 3/4-1 cup cream cheese mixture and perhaps avoid the pineapple juice and do what others recommended which is adding cubes of  cream cheese.  

I would also recommend going Generous with all fruit cause I think more would have been better fit to my husband and I liking. 1/2 cup more perhaps. 

Overall it is a wonderfully delicious recipe! Thanks for sharing!!

This was my first effort ever at making muffins from scratch, and they turned out GREAT!  The changes I made were: for 1 cup oil I subbed 1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt, 1/4 cup milk, 1/4 cup olive oil. I didn't have coconut, cream cheese or pineapple so didn't do those. I used golden raisins. I used about the called for amount of sugar, since I wasn't using the pineapple. Added extra cinnamon and some pumpkin pie spice. I love how flexible this recipe is!! They turned out moist, came out of the muffin forms SO easily, were the perfect sweetness.   They were a huge hit, and went quickly!

Changes I made: Pureed fresh pineapple with as much juice strained instead of canned pineapple, used coconut sugar instead of white sugar, used 3/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup of avocado oil instead of canola oil, nixed the coconut & raisins and added 1/2 cup of pumpkin seeds and upped the oats to 1 full cup, and didn't do the cream cheese middle/topping. THEY'RE DELICIOUS. Next time will probably increase raw pumpkin seeds to a full cup. Or add in sunflower seeds.

I have baked these a few times and every time they turn out the same, dependably good. I use Bobs no gluten all purpose flour which is Garbanzo flour and half whole wheat flour. I also add more crushed pineapple 20 oz drained. I used 1 cup Xylitol sweetener and added a little molasses for flavoring.I also added a zucchini. I needed to eat. I did not make the cream cheese filling but I did it the first time I baked these. Really good when sweetened with the pineapple juice. Will continue baking these this way once a week.

After reading quite a few reviews and not wanting super sweet muffins, I decided to scale the sugars to 1/2 cup each. And I've substituted applesauce in many recipes for part of the oil with great success so I knew that would work fine for this recipe also; I used 1/2 cup applesauce in place of 1/2 the oil. And due to laziness and wanting to get out of the kitchen after baking 4 muffin recipes in a row really late in the evening, I skipped the cream cheese step and didn't add raisins because I didn't have any. These didn't rise alot so next time I would consider filling to the top of the muffin tin. The result was a nice moist tender flavorful muffin! Yum!

This is a wonderful muffin recipe.  Here are my changes:

1.  I used 2 individual cups of granny smith applesauce in a 1 cup measuring cup and topped it off with canola oil to make one cup of liquid.
2.  I used the equivalent of 1 egg white and two whole eggs.
3.  I didn't use coconut or pineapple.  I did briefly boil the raisins in a vanilla-laced water mixture.
4.  I didn't make the cream cheese filling.  I will make a cream cheese frosting to go on top.

I made these for my son's  preschool class where we have to bring healthy snacks to share.  I figured these were as healthy as you could get!  My boys taste tested one and deemed them "Yummy!"  :)  I will make these again!

I didn't have ww flour at home so used 2 cups of all purpose. I did reduce the sugars to 1/2 cup each, as well as 3/4 cup apple sauce and 1/4 oil. I skipped the pineapple and cream cheese but upped the carrot to 3 cups and raisins to 1 cup. I always soak my raisins in hot water with vanilla in the water - it is the best way to plump them up and add more flavor to your baking. These muffins are super moist and full of flavor!

Yummy muffins! I eliminated the cream cheese and coconut, and used applesauce in place of 1/2 of the oil.

I made this with my 4 year old daughter and we both loved it!  No need for the cream cheese filling, but it would be great with a cream cheese frosting!  We made ours in mini loaf pans and baked for 30+ minutes.  Definitely use 1/4 c oil and the rest applesauce, and next time I might not add the coconut. I can't wait to share with my health conscious sister.   Delicious!!

I too used 3/4c applesauce + 1/4c oil.  I skipped the cream cheese, and the muffins are delicious, but my muffins stuck to the papers.  I've made hundreds of muffins and haven't had this problem before.  THe sticking made the muffins messy & ugly so I wouldn't give them to anyone/take them in anywhere, but for us at home they're fine.    EDIT: After 2 days, the muffins are still moist and tender and no longer stick to the papers. :)

Very delicious!The only problem is- muffins stick to baking cups, maybe I should have put half and half of oil and applesauce instead of 1/4 of oil and 3/4 of applesauce. They smell really nice and taste delicious! Thanks for sharing.

took the suggestions of other reviewers and used 3/4 c. applesauce in place of the same amount of oil (so reduced the oil to 1/4 c.).  I used more carrot and eliminated the coconut; used apple pieces instead of raisins.  Reduced the amount of each of the sugars to 1/2 c. each.  My son cannot get enough of these - he loves them.  Enjoy!

I followed many of the suggestions (applesauce for oil, increased cinnamon).  I also added nutmeg, about 1/2 teaspoon and increased the carrots to 3 cups.  To top then I made a quick glaze to drizzle.  They a re wonderful and sooo moist!!  This is a keeper.

I'm always looking for ways to use up leftover carrot pulp from our juicer and I decided to give this recipe a try, using two cups of pulp rather than the grated carrots. I also subbed 3/4 cup applesauce + 1/4 cup oil instead of the 1 cup oil (as suggested by other reviewers), omitted the pineapple because I didn't have any on hand, and increased the cinnamon to 2 tsps. These were wonderful! :D I'll definitely be making these muffins again and again.

These were delicious. I made them for a function and they didnt last 30 minutes.
I did cut the oil by using the applesauce/oil. Now I dont know what happened with my cream cheese mix but I didnt really like it. I dont know if it was the mix with the pineaple juice or what. So next time I will leave the cream cheese filling out. They are so rich I didnt think it was necessary. I was able to make 50 mini muffins with it.

The muffins are moderately tasty, but I have a lot of qualms with this recipe.  1) Because of all the mix-ins, or perhaps the oven temperature, the muffins were flat on top, instead of rounded.  2) I don't think so much oil was needed. 3) This makes WAY more than 18 muffins-- I made about 30.

I don't think I'll make this again-- It would have been tastier with some grated apple or zucchini, and maybe nuts.

Loved these!  They were extremely moist and tender.  I didn't have the pineapple, coconut, or raisins, so I just omitted them  and put some homemade cream cheese frosting on top and they were delicious!  Make sure to add plenty of cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, clove...they could MAYBE be bland without enough spice.  Will make again!

After reading the reviews, I modified recipe.  I used 1/2 cup of each sugar, and 3/4 cup applesause and 1/4 cup oil.  I also whipped together the pineapple juice and cream cheese.

The muffins are fantastic.  Kids and hubby loved them.

these muffins are excellent- i used a mix of golden and regular raisins. i wanted to bring cupcakes to a party but was afraid the icing would melt since it's warm out, so these turned out to be the perfect fit with the filling on the inside. they are excellent!

These are so great.  I left out the cream cheese middle, and use applesauce in place of oil.  I make them in jumbo muffin cups, so they make a real (ie. big) mid-morning snack for my boyfriend.  Yummy.

I really enjoyed making & eating these muffins.  The second time I made them I omitted the cream cheese filling since I didn't think it added much to the muffin other than fat calories and I decreased the sugars to 1/2 cup each.  Love it!  They freeze well too.

I liked the recipe and the muffins came out good.  The rolled oats didn't work for me, they gave the muffins a "sandy" taste and they were awkward to chew.  I made a substitute with well cooked oats (plain cooked oatmeal) and it made a huge difference!  I tried it a second time without the oatmeal, and the muffins still tasted good.  My 1 year old  loved them! 
Not sure if the cream cheese filling is suppose to incorporate with the dough after baking, mine did every time.  I also added more cream cheese then in the recipe, because the original filling was too "watery" and leaked everywhere.  I doubled the cream cheese amount and that worked for me.

These are very taste as written.
I new use less approx 1/4 cup of each sugar, all whole wheat flour, 1/4 cup oil and 3/4 cup unsweetened apple sauce.
Not a fan of raisins so I use craisins.
No cream cheese filling.
Always have these in my freezer. They go very well with a nice slice of cheddar cheese.

YUM!  I didn't have pineapple and omitted the cream cheese centre, made 1/2 batch with coconut and 1/2 batch without (I do *not* like coconut but my wife does), and had to add a bit of water to compensate for the moisture not add with the pineapple.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  They came very moist and  flavorful.    This recipe is definitely a keeper!  Thanks for sharing!

It's an awesome recipe and I will make it again. Below are some modifications I made.
I used 1 banana in place of 1/2 cup of oil. 
I replaced the eggs by using chia eggs 3 of them to replace the eggs in the recipe. (1 tbsp of chia seeds to 3 tbsps of water = 1 chia eggs).
I reduced the sugar to 1 cup total, 1/2 a cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup coconut sugar. It is perfectly sweet.
I skipped the coconut, raisins, pineapple and cream cheese. I did not use any frosting on the cupcakes. They were awesome as it.

The cream cheese part didn't work out for me. I ended up with a liquid mess but the muffins were amazing.  Per my daughters  request I left out the coconut but I bet they are even better with it! Will def make these again.

I omitted the raisins and pineapple and cream cheese because I knew my kids wouldn't eat them.  I subbed the 1 C wheat flour for 1/2 C coconut flour. I also subbed coconut oil for the canola oil, 1:1. And at the suggestion of other reviewers, I decreased both sugars to 1/2 C each. For extra flavor I added ground clove and ginger and increased the cinnamon as well. These are so tasty and moist. Just like eating carrot cupcakes.

I made some changes: 
No cream cheese, raisins, pineapple, or coconut. 
I used added everything else included in the recipe, and also added: a teaspoon of almond flavoring, 1/2 cup raisins, more cinnamon, some nutmeg, and one diced fuji apple. I substituted 1 cup apple sauce plus a small splash of vegetable oil for the full cup of vegetable oil, and used all brown sugar instead of white and brown. Came out moist and delicious! 
Next time I'll decrease the sugar content to make it healthier.

I doubled the recipe to use up the carrots from my garden. This was delicious. I reduced the ingredients to 1 3/4 cup oil and 5 extra large eggs and it turned out fine and still a little oily. I didn't do the cream cheese mixture, but I'm sure it would have been great. I also was out of wheat flour so I used all AP flour.

Appreciated the re views, as I also cut back on sugar .  Substituted cranberries for raisins and increased the carrots.  Ended up with 18 muffins and they are hearty!

Thank you to the submitter and the reviewers of this recipe! Once again you rock. I made the recipe "as is" except for reviewer suggestions (and one or two of my own) and created a carrot muffin star.  I used only 1/4 cup oil with 3/4 cup apple sauce, decreased both brown and white sugars to 1/2 cup each, and bumped up the spices with 1/2 teaspoon extra cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, plus a tablespoon of molasses. I love pineapple so I was generous with that measurement. And since reviewers said the pineapple juice didn't jazz up the cream cheese enough, I grated orange zest into the mixture as well. These muffins turned out light, moist, delicious and still healthy. It is not carrot cake in a muffin shape, but the real muffin deal, albeit with a cream cheese surprise. I liked that there was no icing on the top so they are easier to package for snacks.  I am saving this recipe and will make it again and again.  We are definitely better together ;-)

I followed the advice of other commenters and substituted applesauce for  3/4 cup of the oil.    I also reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup each to make it more healthy.  They were not very sweet.  I liked it that way, but I might increase it a little more next time just so my kids will like it more.  I left out the raisins and cream  cheese.  Next time I think I will leave out the pineapple just to give it a smoother texture.  This was a great way to use up the carrots from my garden!

Awesome muffins!!
I used 1/2 cup of applesauce and 1/2 cup oil instead. I also took out the cream cheese centre. I made mini-muffins so the cook time was only 15 minutes. They turned out so yummy!
Note: don't overfill the muffin cups!

The muffins are great flavor wise but the amount of work and  time to make them makes it hard to give it a 5 star. Expensive because of all the ingredients. I reduced the amount and used coconut oil in place of the canola because it is a healthier oil ( I would have elminated it completely if I had had apple sauce) I also cut both sugars in half and replaced the white with cane. And they were plenty sweet enough.  It is a muffin that takes planning in advance to be sure that you have all ingredients. Although they taste great I think they could be a lot healthier with some flax and grains added.

As per the other reviewers, I substituted fresh applesauce instead of the oil, only put in 1/2 cup sugar, omitted cream cheese (not a big fan). I also added chopped pecans, would omit pineapple next time didn't blend well as per my husband's taste buds. They were delicious, will make it again!!!

Delicious! I followed the most helpful review and I cut both sugars to a 1/2 cup each, substituted 3/4 cup apple sauce + 1/4 cup oil for the 1 cup oil recommended. I do think there could be a bit more of the cream cheese filling. I omitted the raisins. They had a wonderful, moist, dense texture. I made 18 muffins from this recipe - the muffin cups were filled with batter to the top, but they didn't rise much over the tops of the liners.

Doubled the recipe but stuck to 1 cup of oil, and for the 2nd cup used milk.  1 cup of white and brown sugar respectively.  No pineapple and muffins are awesome!  Extra healthy touch: coconut oil instead of canola and hemp heart for half of the oats.  Delicious!

The basics were great but they had to bake a lot longer than the prescribed time. I had to leave them in for at least 50 minutes and unfortunately they went flat on top. Could be because the oven was opened. However I added roughly chopped pecans and they were delicious. Crispy on the outside and moist inside. Next time I'll use more baking powder than bicarbonate of soda, less oil and will bake for at least 50 minutes before checking them. I will make them again though. The basics are great

Made mini muffins in bulk  to freeze for my daughters preschool snacks! I just grab what I need for the week and put them in the fridge. Recipe is easily modified. I Cut sugar down to 1/4 c each, used only white flour since that's all I had, I did not have coconut but added more oatmeal (2/3rds cup) I also added about a 1/4 cup ground up flax and chia seeds for an extra boost. Lastly I halved the oil and substituted with apple sauce and folded in one apple chopped roughly so there were some small apple bits. They turned out moist, plenty sweet with the apple and pineapple (even after cutting the sugar down) and I feel it's a great healthy snack my 3 year old is excited about bringing to school. My husband liked them too so I guess good for the whole families lunch sacks!

Best muffins I ever ate. I used carrots from my garden. I added 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 t. cardamon, lowered both sugars to 1/2 c each, changed the cup of oil into 1/4 cup oil and 3/4 cup applesauce, left out coconut, and added 1/2 cup walnuts.  I plumped the raisins.  I did not do the cream cheese filling. The recipe made 11 big muffins. Perfect sweetness, perfect texture.  Gonna make another batch for the freezer.

These were awesome and a great recipe to play with. I cut the oil in half (used coconut oil) and subbed apple sauce for the rest. Also added a grated apple playing off some morning glory recipes I read and skipped the cream cheese but interested to see what that would add.

Lovely muffins. Cream cheese filling was ok but I would probably like the cream cheese as frosting just as well. Will certainly make again.

It's good but TOO SWEET. And the texture is VERY MOIST. Sweetness already exists via coconut flakes and pineapple,  didn't use more than 1/4 cup of sugar total. 

I substituted ALL of the oil for apple sauce to decrease fat.

I made half the batch in cupcake liners and half in single tart trays, and the ones in the foil tart trays rose quite a bit compared to in the paper. That seems to alleviate the concerns here about the batter not rising.

The paper liners were the worst. The muffins don't really peel off at all. On the other-hand, the foil tart tins leave very little crumb and the muffins pop right out. no need for spray or any added grease. The tins are reusable-Just soak to clean.

The cream cheese filling ratio is not listed and mine came out very watery so it marbled, and did not stay in the middle as solid filling. With this part, start with the Cream Cheese first and add pineapple juice a teaspoon at a time until you get the right tartness and texture. It should still be more on the thick cream side, instead of being so watery. Roughly 1/4 cup cream cheese with about 1-2 tbsp of juice. Not too much or it will get watery.

For those of you like me who don't have a food processor for carrots, I just used a regular veggie peeler to process the carrots manually. It took a bit of time but it's faster than using a knife, and i got nice thin onionskin-slice

I am giving this five stars because everyone loved it ... though I did make changes.  I used a little more than 3/4 cup applesauce and topped with oil to make one cup, and as I didn't want to have to worry about refrigeration, I skipped the cream cheese.  The muffins were moist but not oily and didn't need the cream cheese step at all.  I will definitely be making these time and again!

I also modified this recipe by not adding the cream cheese filling. I did make some substitutions after reading the review, like using less sugar (1/2 cup brown and 1/2 cup splenda baking substitute) and substituting some of the 3/4 of the oil with apple sauce. I also used Craisins instead of raisings. This recipe, as the poster suggested would be great with substituting what you have on hand. I did use the pineapple, carrots, Craisins, coconut, etc and the end result was a very moist muffin but you really could not taste each individual ingredient so I don't think any one of the fruits added to the flavor but did add to the moistness. Hope that makes sense, in the future I wouldn't go out of my way to get coconut for example if I didn't have it on-hand already and this recipe would still be a great moist muffin.

I made these with fresh chopped apples instead of canned pineapple and left out the raisins. I also used a 12 grain flour instead of whole wheat. I made one tray of mini muffins without the cream cheese and one tray of regular ones with the cream cheese. The cream cheese was a big hit!

This is a great base muffin recipe. I use it for most of my muffins. Today I omitted the cream cheese filling and substituted 1.5 cups fresh crushed blackberries for the raisins. I had to add 1/2 cup of milk to batter as it was way too thick. I would have used applesause if I had any on hand.

Awsome and very versatile. I mean, look at those ingredients! Substituting applesauce for some of the oil would make it 5 stars. For those whose muffins weren't rising, try letting your batter stand for 30 minutes before baking. That allows glutens to form and starches to hydrate which prevents your batter from spreading while baking.

I loved these and so did hubby! Felt 'healthy' yet substantial!  Made 12 large muffins.

Small modifications - 1/2 cup oil and added a little caster sugar to the cream cheese.

Took 25 mins to bake but made mistake of baking longer as tester kept coming out a bit wet. Doh!!! Because of the cream cheese filling!!! So stick with 20-25 mins!

I tend to lower fat & sugar in recipes without sacrificing flavor.  I reduced the oil to 1/4 cup and added 3/4 cup of home made low sugar applesauce, and did not use the white sugar in the recipe, only the brown.  As well I used dried cranberries instead of the raisins, as that is what I had on hand.  The flavor was really nice, and the muffin stayed moist for days.

I left out all the fillings. 

To make it more healthy, I used whole wheat flour for all purpose and used apple sauce for oil. Next time I'll use apple sauce to completely substitute oil since I don't think it will make too much difference.

I left out all the fillings such as coconut raisins cream cheese and pineapples. 

I added a tblsp of wheat germ and another tblsp of flaxseed and a bit of pecan and walnuts. covered the top of the muffin with almond slices. 

GREAT FLAVOR AND SO HEALTHY! :)

These muffins were really tasty! I made all the modifications of other reviewers. Using half the sugar, added nutmeg, 1/4 tsp. clove and ground ginger, 3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce and 1/4 cup canola oil. I topped them with a sprinkling of flax seed meal. I love the cream cheese filling and would suggest making a nice deep well in the muffin cup to put two tsp. of filling in it!
Yum

These had a nice taste and were very moist, but were not really to my children's liking.  They would be great travel food as they are not super crumbly.

I read all the reviews and thank you all.  I eliminated pineapple, coconut and cream cheese.  I added about 1/4 cup orange juice and used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce.  I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup each.  I also added 1/4 cup walnuts and will use more next time along with a mix of Splenda and sugars.

Definitely would make this again.  I used 1 3/4 cup of whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup of white flour, substituted the oil with unsweetened applesauce and cut back the sugar to 1/2 cup.  Baked mini muffins at 400 degrees for 14 minutes.  Came out perfect!  Very moist and not too sweet.

Just made these and with a few alterations.  Extremely delicious, moist with bits of crunch.  I also reduced both sugars to 1/2 cup each, doubled the coconut, soaked raisins in warm water and threw in 1/4 c. walnuts and 1t. vanilla and cinnamon.  I omitted the cream cheese (didn't have any) and instead of oats I used a 1/4 c. flax seeds.  Also substituted 3/4 c. unsweetened applesauce for oil.   Then to spice them up, I used a cinnamon glaze made with powdered sugar (from another allecipes.com recipe).  I know it's a lot of substitutions, but they are awesome!

As other reviewers, I omitted all the final add-ins but the carrots and oatmeal. They are still great! I also used 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil to cut down on the fat. My kids request these!

Very good!  Skipped coconut, pineapples, and cream cheese.  Should have reduced sugars when I substituted apple sauce for oil, but still very good.  Didn't have the energy to shred more carrots, so only used 1.25 cups, which was plenty.

Very good muffin.  I did not use pineapple juice or cream cheese as I did not have any, but it was still wonderfully moist.  All children (and non-veggie/fruit eating hubby) gobbled these up like they were the biggest treat.  Will keep making these with our garden-grown carrots!  Added rasins.

Took the advice of a number of others - 1/2 C each of the sugars and 3/4 C apple sauce and 1/4 C oil instead of 1 C oil. Also, I didn't use the cream cheese part of the recipe and I added a bit extra cinnamon with hopes of making it a bit more spicy, but it wasn't enough. Otherwise, very good recipe - very moist!

Great recipe! I made it exactly as called for the first time and thought it was great, but abit oily. The second time I made them with applesauce instead of oil and they weren't oily and just as tasty!! I made them again, and forgot the oatmeal!! They were still good!! :)

Love this recipe.  I followed some other suggestions.  Cut both sugars to 1/2 cup each.  Changed the oil to 1/4 cup and added 3/4 cup applesauce.  Also, I added a tsp. of apple pie spice which was an excellent addition.  I skipped the cream cheese center idea.  These are so yummy you could make a cream cheese icing instead and serve them as a dessert.
Thanks for a superb recipe.

I am a huge muffin fan... especially carrot... but this recipe is nothing special. This sounded like such a great combo with the carrot, coconut, pinapple, & cream cheese, but the results were dismal. First of all this makes 24 muffins. Next although there is nothing wrong with oats and whole wheat flour, they do NOT mingle well with pineapple, carrots, or cream cheese, and  with a cup of oil and almost  2 cups of sugar, there is absolutely no point trying to makie these "healthy." The muffins did turn out pretty and had a relatively nice texture, but the flavor was just nothing special. If you do make these, take a shortcut by buying the "brick" style cream cheese and then cutting small pieces to stick into the batter of each muffin. There is absolutely no reason to thin it out with juice, it will just make it runny and difficult to work with. Overall if you have had your share of muffins, keep looking because this recipe is sub-par.

This was by far the best muffin we have had in a LONG LONG time!  I did however do the following to the recipe based on other reviews..

1)  Decreased oil to 1/2 cup and could have gone to 1/4 cup, and added 1/2 cup MILK
2) doubled cinnamon and added about 1/2 tsp ginger
3) added a touch of sugar to the cream cheese
4) decreased sugar to 1/2 cup each, and that was still really sweet

My husband loves muffins and carrot cake so these are perfect! Most of the ingredients are similar to our fav carrot cake recipe as well. Following several other reviews, I used 1/2 c each of the sugars, increased the cinnamon to 2 tsp and added 1/4 tsp of ginger (could up that to 1/2 tsp next time). I would decrease the pineapple juice in the filling next time (or not even worry about the filling if I don't have cream cheese already on hand). Yum!

Very good.  I used 3/4 cup brown sugar and cut the white to 1/2 cup, but still found too sweet.  Will make again, but think it would be best to cut to 1/4 white sugar next time...

These are good, not great, but good.  I modified them to make them super healthy (Splenda instead of sugar, applesauce for oil, wheat flour, wheat germ, egg whites, skipped the cream cheese) and I added some extra spice (more cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove) to flavor.  They came out a little tough and dry, so I think next time some nonfat, light vanilla yogurt is in order.  But, for healthy muffins, these are pretty tasty.

This is one of the best muffin recipes that I have tried. The wonderful smell during the baking time was extraordinary. I added nutmeg and cloves along with the cinnamon. Also I whipped the cream cheese and pineapple juice, instead of lightly mixing... created a softer center that almost swirled though the middle of the muffin. But I think it would be good either way, with a firmer center or with a fluffy center. Think I might try shredded zucchini instead of carrots next time. Can see that you could vary this recipe dozens of different ways. The canola oil does give it a slicker texture; might alter that next time and use butter. But still very good. Will definitely make this recipe again.

I have a son with food allergies so I made these with Ener-G egg replacer and no cream cheese filling.  They turned out great but are a little oily.  My son & husband love them, though, and that was my main goal.  I feel so good about the little one getting all these fruits & veggies in a muffin!  Thank you.
