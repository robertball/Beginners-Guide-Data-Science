My family has enjoyed these bars for years although I've never made them with real peanuts in them. They are so easy to make and I have yet to meet anyone who doesn't like them!

Thanks SO much for sharing this recipe! My Mom used to make these and I haven't seen the recipe for years. Your recipe turned out exactly like my Mom's. This recipe doubles easily.

I prefer a 50/50 semisweet-milk chocolate mix but I'm sure any type would do - fabulous recipe!

This isn't a fancy torte it's a no bake sweets recipe that has been used for ages... During the energy crisis in times of economic strife etc. In addition to the corn syrup peanut butter (always the crunchy variety) and brown sugar I add about a 1/4-1/2 c of maple syrup. I add a half c of peanuts but I run them through the chopper first to create tiny pieces rather than big crunchier ones. I don't add extra salt (lots on the roasted peanuts) and I don't add extra butter. The peanut butter provides more than enough fat for me. Truly a great Canadian recipe fantastic to take to potlucks of for a really fast fix for dinner. (I'd better go make mine nowmmm

Love these! This has to be the quickest dessert ever. They took less than ten minutes to make and are delicious. I used milk chocolate chips and added a dash of salt to the mixture. Don't leave out the peanuts because they make the dish.

Fabulous old recipe -- first made these in Grade 7 home-ec actually:) We use a 50/50 mix of semi sweet chocolate chips and butterscotch chips for the icing -- tastes so good!

Super easy to make and they taste great. The only thing I would do different is crush the peanuts. I put them in whole and I would prefer them chopped.

It was a great recipe gobbled up, but everyone thought it might be better without the peanuts. So I am going to try it again with more crispy cereal (I used a GF one) and no peanuts and see how it goes.

I doubled the recipe and used a 9 x 13 pan. For the icing I melted 2 T peanut butter with 1cup of chocolate chips. My whole family loved them.

This was just OK for us. Seemed like it took a long time for the mixture to boil. It did set up nice and the chips melted well. After it chilled and let it warm up a bit it was hard to cut and very sticky. Hard to chew. SO nuked some for a bit and said it was easier to eat. Don't think this will be a re-do. Thanks for posting something new for us to try.

A little to chewy but a decent way to use up cereal.
