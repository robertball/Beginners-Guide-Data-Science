How do you completely change it...then rate it? It's not even the same recipe when your done! This is for almost every review I read...not all...but most. Turkey instead of chicken is one thing...but when you SKIP the blue cheese, and the bun and on and on and on...it's not the same! I have an idea...change it...then submit it as yours. Don't review a recipe you have ALMOST completely changed. And yes..my family of 7 and our friends loved it as is. Well done MELXCLOUD!

We thought these were fantastic!  Now, I must admit, I had been drinking prior to eating them, so my review may be a bit skewed. However, everyone else who ate them also commented multiple times how much they enjoyed them.  I didn't have lettuce or celery (we were camping...too lazy to deal w/fresh produce.  And, I hate celery.) and they were still awesome.  I just prepped another batch to freeze for later grilling.  In the latest batch, I added some minced garlic and parmesan cheese to attempt to recreate our favorite wing sauce (garlic parmesan) taste.  I did freeze them prior to grilling as they are quite wet and I imagine would have been a little annoying to deal w/on the grill w/out freezing first.  THANKS for a fantastic recipe (one that made me expand my horizons and try ground chicken, at that!)!  EDIT:  The addition of minced garlic and grated parmesan cheese was awesome!  We loved them as written, and tweaked to mimic our favorite wing flavors.  If we're out of dry blue cheese, I'll use a little light ranch mixed some hot sauce for a topper, instead.  These are now ALWAYS in our freezer for quick meals.  When we don't have buns, I serve them on Lender's frozen bagels (toasted).

Mmm delicious. Only big change was I added diced red onion to the burger mixture. I find diced onions keep poultry burgers from drying out. I used Frank's Buffalo wing sauce and served this on a crusty roll. I did add the celery salt and the diced celery.. the diced celery added a nice crunch. I topped this with a little more hot suace when it came time to eat... yum.

This is a great burger!  I used Franks Red Hot... as there is no other hot sauce!  I left out the celery salt & chopped celery as no one care for that flavor in my house.   Added a little minced onion and garlic powder to the blue cheese crumbles with mayo & sour cream 1/2 & 1/2 of each for a creamy texture.  Let that sit in the refrigerator for about 1/2 hour.    Prepared the meat as directed leaving out the celery salt and let them rest for about 1/2 hour in the refrigerator to all the seasons to mingle. Toasted up the buns after grilling the  burger; served with extra hot sauce & blue cheese dressing on the side...  It was perfect. Thanks for sharing! Will be a summer hit.

These were super good!  Made them with my deli roll recipe from my recipe box.  I increased  the servings to 16. We did not use the blue cheese crumbles but took a short cut with blue cheese dressing mainly because the kids took one look at real blue cheese and went "Ewe". so bottled dressing was the next best thing.  The celery is key to these burgers and I mixed it with the bottled blue cheese dressing to hold together and not fall out of the sandwich.    Also, you HAVE TO watch the cooking time on these as they can get dry quickly.  Ours were fine but another minute on one or two of them would have been too much.  I might add a bit of EVOO to the next batch and see if that makes any difference.  These were a hit with everyone and will now be a regular at our house!***Update*** Have made these several times now!  I grind boneless thigh meat and breast meat in my food processor and the result is a very moist patty!  I make enough to freeze for 2 additional meals.

Well, this recipe is one I'm definitely going to keep. I made my own poultry seasoning (thyme, rosemary, marjoram, sage, black pepper) and used 1/3 C Frank's Red Hot sauce since we like the taste. Also, I combined ground turkey and chicken. I also added some onion powder, garlic powder, and Worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture.  I started them on a griddle pan and finished them in the oven at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes;  I served them on buns with low-fat Swiss cheese (less fat than the blue cheese sauce, although that looked yummy!).  This was delicious, and I'll definitely be making this again.

Since ground chicken is so expensive I made my own by thawing 4 BLSL chicken breasts and cutting them into 1 inch cubes.  I added a handful of the chicken cubes to the food processor and hit the chop button for about 5 seconds or so, scooped out the ground chicken into a bowl and continued until I had all the chicken ground.  Be careful not to grind too long as you can easily ruin the chicken.  I then proceeded with the recipe and it yielded 4 patties.  Easy recipe and would be great to make ahead and freeze.  Thanks for sharing.

These were a nice easy meal for a record hot summer evening. We did grill them, they seemed really sticky when I pattied them up, which I did two hours before grilling, so I put them in the freezer on wax paper to make them easier on the grill. The dressing is what makes these so good, I followed the ingredients as specified, except used celery seed instead of celery salt. Didn't put any real celery on them, just Romaine lettuce. Oh and I did mince some sweet onion and put in them, honestly they might have been boring without the onion.  The sauce was so good and I made extra and we used it as dressing on a salad side dish, I did add 2 teaspoons of light mayo and the sour cream and blue cheese were all low fat...couldn't tell the difference. Very good low fat meal.

These were really good-I put an egg and an handful of breadcrumbs in the chicken mixture to make the burgers bind better.  It was too cold to grill the night I made these, so I broiled them for about 6 minutes per side.  The next time I make these, I will definitely put the patties together ahead of time and refrigerate them for a while.

Recipe is excellent as written.  I tried something different for the topping.  I used a high-quality blue cheese dressing, added additional blue cheese and some worcestershire sauce, mixed with chopped celery.  It was perfect.

We were a house divided on this one. One of us liked it, the other really didn't. I think a lot of the dislike had to do with the consistency. We won't make this again.

These are really good.  I have made these burgers a few times now, and everytime we have them my kids ask when can they have them again.  They are easier to put on the grill if you form the patties and then freeze them enough to firm them up.  These are definitely a go-to-again recipe!

This was good! I only needed two burgers, so I used 8oz of meat, some finely minced onion and mushrooms (keeps poultry burgers juicy), halved the hot sauce, but kept the rest of the ingredients at the full amounts. So yummy! I stuffed the burgers with a bit of blue cheese (like a juicy loosey) and baked them at 375 degrees in the over for 30 mins, flipping once. I'll try them in the skillet as well. Also, I put salt and pepper in the seasoning mix before leaving them in the fridge overnight, and topped the cooked burgers with tomato in addition to the called for toppings. Thanks for the tasty recipe!

This recipe has me all excited for football and tailgate parties.  The burger alone tastes exactly like a hot wing!  The meat is a little difficult to handle. I formed them on foil and tossed in the freezer while the grill was heating up.  All hubs had to do was flip them onto the grill and peel the foil off of the back.  They cooked up fine and without any problems.

These were very good.  I added finely minced onion and instead of making burgers, I made sliders and served them on Hawaiian rolls.  I also made them the night before and froze them.  This helped them to stay together on the grill.  My husband loved the bleu cheese sauce, but I'm not a big fan of bleu cheese so I topped mine with ranch dressing and they were delicious!

These were good but lacked in that PUNCH/WOW experience.  I'd make them again and maybe zip them up a bit--grill the roll, make the chicken spicier...Great idea!!

I went easy on the hot sauce for my 2 year old. She never eats anything though...and didn't eat this, so I wish I would have added all the hot sauce! Still it was pretty tasty, and my hubby really enjoyed it.

These have got to be the best "alternative" burgers we've had in ages!  I minced celery & red onion & added this to burger mix; also added some bread crumbs because as others have pointed out, the patties are pretty wet.  I broiled them because I was afraid they would fall apart on the grill, and this worked fine -- it was easy and the burgers browned up nicely.   I also added some hot sauce to the blue cheese sauce (Texas Pete is our preferred brand) which gave it a good kick.   The sauce was so good that the leftover portion was brought to the table and used as an impromptu chip dip.   Will definitely make this again soon -- not a bite of leftovers remained!

I followed the recipe except for the addition of some bread crumbs and an egg yolk ( I can't seem to get moist burgers without these 2) I also used ground turkey since it was on sale. These were good but thought they could have used more hot sauce. Thanks for the recipe!

I cooked these on the george foreman since its raining out. These are soooooo yummy. Has the taste of the hot sauce, but not the heat. My 8 yr old step-son ate 2! I left off the blue cheese dressing since I'm pregnant and not allowed to have it. But will def try it when I can. This reciepe is going into rotation at our house!!

So good!  These were my first attempt at making a chicken burger and I was very impressed.  I did't make the blue cheese sauce as we don't care for it and I had to make them in a skillet instead of on the grill.  I followed the recipe exactly and can't wait to make them again.  Tender, juicy, and a bonus-they're healthy!  Thanks for a superb recipe!

These were REALLY yummy!  I made exactly as stated, except I topped with lettuce and tomato instead of celery.  The dressing was great, and the burgers were moist and flavorful!  I put mine on club rolls because I couldn't find kaiser rolls at the store.  I will make these again!

I made these with ground turkey under the broiler and they were so easy and tasty! I bet they would have been even better on the grill and I could have also stood a little more hot sauce for flavor.

I seem to be in the minority.  I thought it was ok at best.  My husband did not care much for this burger even though we like wings.  I was looking forward to it and made it as written but the burger did not seem to have much flavor other than the hot sauce.

I gave 4 stars, instead of 5, just because we didnt liked at all the blue cheese dressing.
It was sad to throw away all these expensive ingredients!
I made a ranch dressing instead. 
Also NO celery!!!
With that everyone loved it!! Didnt use ground chicken, used breast chicken instead. My sons are always craving for them! Even my picky eater one!!
We put cheese in them with iceberg lettuce and it's wonderful!

Soooooo good!  I added about 1/8 cup of bread crumbs to help keep them together and about a 1/4 lb. of ground turkey to make up for the lesser amount of chicken (only had 1 lb.) and it was very tasty. My husband and I loved it. The blue cheese mixture with the celery on top is so good. I am so glad I found this recipe because now I plan on making them more often. A keeper!

This review is for the burgers only as I did not make the dressing. (I had some commercially prepared blue cheese dressing that needed to be used.) I used one pound ground turkey but still kept the other burger ingredients in the same proportions although I used Texas Pete prepared buffalo wing sauce instead of the hot pepper sauce. The burgers were moist and tender with just enough "bite" to be interesting. Will definitely be making these again.

Yum - these burgers were great!   I cooked them on the stove, and they turned out fine.  Will definitely make these gain, and will try them on the grill this summer.

I made these without the blue cheese dressing because I am anti-blue cheese... however they totally fell apart on my foreman grill! They were a soggy mess despite putting them in the freezer for 15 min. The flavor was good - but as another poster said, not too spicy. Once they were in the bun and dressed up (lettuce, tomato, pickle, mayo, cheese, ketchup), they were not too bad

Very good.  I used turkey instead of chicken.  I didnt get a whole lot of buffalo taste so I added more sauce(Franks buffalo wing sauce) to my bun to kick it up.  I made a low cal blue cheese sauce and added diced celery to it.  Served it with microwaved potato chips from this site!

These were excellent!  I grilled them indoors on a grill pan and it worked perfectly.  Not sure how they would have held up on grill grates though, they were a little mushy but firmed up with cooking.  I used Franks Red Hot buffalo sauce and added a bit of garlic, salt and pepper.  Omitted the cayenne due to families taste but I think this was unnecessary as we all ended up dipping the sandwiches in the buffalo sauce (incluing my 5 yr old who at 1 1/2 of these!!)   I will be making these again as I no longer need to go out to fulfill my buffalo cravings!

This was FANTASTIC.  Even my 5 year old liked it!  I've made it several times, and have had problems with the burgers falling apart a few times.  If the meat seems 'wet', add an egg white and you'll be fine!  Also, when I've made them recently I've used 1 Tablespoon of Old Bay seasoning instead of the salt and spices.  It tastes the same (to me, anyway), and is easier.

I was really excited to try these and thought they would taste great but I really didn't like them. I like all of the ingredients in the recipe but the overall taste was not to my liking. I followed the recipe exactly but my boyfriend and I are not fans. I couldn't even finish it.

My husband just loves these!! I make a double batch, patty out the burgers, freeze on wax paper, then throw the frozen burgers into freezer bags, and whenever he wants one (at least once a week), I take out how many I need! Thank you for this excellent recipe!!!

Light and moist. Yes, I altered the recipe but it was in the interest of time.  I just used store bought buffalo sauce and blue cheese dressing. I did add approx. 1/2 cup flavored breadcrumbs to firm up and put in the freezer for about 10 minutes, they are quite wet.  I added extra buffalo sauce on mine afterwards to kick up the eat, but the kids enjoyed the mellower taste. These are definately a redo.

I knew I'd like these...I love buffalo chicken and all the extras. I made changes, but I don't think any of them changed the integrity of the recipe I added some hot sauce to the dressing mix and also added the celery to the dressing, just so there would only be one topping for the burger. I also added several chopped crimini mushrooms to the burger, just to keep it moist. These were VERY hard to work with, even after freezing the mixture for a bit before I formed the patties. I tried using a burger press and wax paper, but ended up having to just scrape the patties off the paper, so that was a bust. I might try freezing them solid next time before cooking. The most important part of these is the taste, though, and that was wonderful! I will make these again and again.

these are terrific and going in to my "favorite recipes" binder.  Nice and spicy . . . like chicken wings.  For non-bleu cheese lovers, serve with ranch dressing instead.

Delicious!  I cooked them in a large non-stick skillet and they turned out fantastic.  We didn't have any celery and I used good quality blue cheese dressing. Will be making these frequently.

This isn't a bad recipe. It is nice and moist and chewy and I like the crunch the celery adds. However, it is rather bland and has nowhere near the flavor of buffalo wings. I topped my burgers with sriracha but it wasn't enough; the burgers themselves need more kick. Next time, I will add more sauce and seasonings.

Also I did not care for the dip. The sour cream reminded me of yogurt. I would just use blue cheese alone next time.

We love these! I do use ground turkey instead of chicken, but otherwise follow the recipe. These are great to freeze raw and throw on the grill, too. I only have an indoor grill, but these work just fine on there. Thanks for sharing!

This was delicious!! I didn't even have all the ingredients on hand.  Instead of making the sauce (because I didn't have blue cheese crumbles or worcestershire sauce), I just put blue cheese dressing on before serving.  It was lowfat and really tasty!

Really good! Added a chopped onion and a clove of minced garlic sauteed in a tad of olive oil to the mix as well as a bit of plain bread crumbs to bind. Used low fat sour cream and reduced fat blue cheese crumbles for the sauce. Also served bun-less and served on leaves of romaine lettuce instead. Served with a little more hot sauce and grilled zucchini. Very nice!

Yum! I added breadcrumbs since everyone else said they stuck - using Pam really helped as well, especially when turning the burgers. For all the people that said it's not spicy, I don't think it's supposed to be spicy, it's just supposed to have the flavors of buffalo chicken. If you want spicier, just add more sauce.

These were better than I expected. I only used one pound of ground chicken and put some breadcrumbs in the mix to make sure it stayed together well. If I were you, I would double this recipe...it was way too good for only 4 burgers :) And don't forget to toast the buns...makes it that much better.

My whole family enjoyed these.  I substituted 93% lean turkey for the 83% lean chicken, used only 1 T of Red Hot in mix, and did a 50/50 split of light sour cream and light blue cheese dressing w/ the blue cheese.  Then, i added extra hot sauce to mine.

We love chicken wings grilled with Frank's Red Hot cayenne pepper sauce so, naturally, these sounded good. Prepared these as suggested with one omission, the celery salt, and they were great - nice and moist and the perfect amount of heat. My boys thought they were a bit spicy and they didn't try the blue cheese dressing which was a nice compliment to the spice. Will make again but maybe cut down on the hot sauce so everyone will enjoy. I loved them - but I like it hot.

This was really good.  Only had 1 lb of meat so I scaled to 3 servings.  I brushed it with 1/4 cup Lawry's Buffalo BBQ marinade mixed with 2 TBS Franks hot sauce.  Left out the celery salt b/c I didn't have it.  These were great.  Didn't make the dressing either.  Served on a twist roll with red onion and tomato.

Fixed this as written except used 2# ground chicken. To save calories, did not put the blue cheese mixture on top. I have to say it was outstanding. There was not alot of heat, just a hint of buffalo wings. Definately a keeper!
Fixed it again and husband said it tasted just like chicken wings. Put blue cheese dressing on top. Used Franks Hot Sauce.

These were just ok. Like some other reviewers mentioned, I felt they were missing something. Maybe it needs more hot sauce, buffalo sauce, or spices.

Delicious. Added a tiny bit of minced red onion, one grated garlic clove, used two pounds ground chicken, made six burgers. Grilled. did stick to grill but manageable if let them char a bit. Used ranch on mine, with cheddar and surprisingly loved the chopped fine celery on top!

The flavor of these are really good, but my husband and I both feel that working with the ground chicken was too messy and the patties were too soft. Next time, we will just marinate chicken breasts with the hot pepper sauce and spices and still top with the blue cheese/sour cream sauce.  We both feel it will be much better.

These were great! My husband and I loved them. He hates blue cheese so I made his with ranch and it was just as good. I did add a little garlic and onion to the mix and didnt grill thrm but baked them. They turned out amazing not dry not to spicy and didnt fall apart like I thought they would. Before cooking I did put the mixture back in the freezer for about 10
 minutes before forming the patties. This made it a lot easier to form. Hope to try them grilled soon!

Delicous!!! Followed the recipe except for using ranch instead of blue cheese and I didn't spray the burgers with Pam, instead wiped the grill grate down with olive oil before grilling the burgers which worked fine.

These were great!  Made them exactly as written, skipping the celery because I forgot to buy it.  The blue cheese sauce is killer.  I think next time I might make slightly smaller patties, dividing the meat mixture into six instead of four and cooking for slightly less time; as written, the burgers were really thick, and it sort of threw off the balance for us.  Still, awesome!  Thanks!

These were allright. While not terrible, I wasn't wowed either. My fiance agrees. These just weren't as flavorful as we had hoped. One thing I must say, these were not dry at all (which I was afraid grilling might do to them...). I usually make slight changes to every recipe I try, but this time I only made a couple very MINOR ones. I was worried that my burgers would fall apart on the grill, so I froze them for 30 minutes as others suggested. This firmed them up really well (no need for an egg or breadcrumbs at all). Other than that, my only  modification was to add my chopped celery and a couple tablespoons of mayo to my sour cream mixture (I thought it needed more "sauce" after adding the celery, and since I used up all of my sour cream, I switched to mayonnaise). NOTE: Our burgers took DOUBLE the amount of time to cook thru than directed (10 minutes per side), so you may want to plan for this (we were trying to time ours with fries in the deep fryer - not an easy task!). Served on fresh kaiser rolls with iceberg lettuce / sliced tomatoes and a side of homemade crispy seasoned french fries (Cassie). The fries completed this meal and were a great addition (try them!). I'm not sure I'd make these again, but am glad I tried your recipe nonetheless. Thanks MELXCLOUD! :-)

These were AWESOME.  I did follow the advice of others by throwing in some bread crumbs and an egg.  I also placed them in freezer for a while and they held up GREAT on the grill.  First time eating a chicken burger and I loved it, can't wait to make again.

Loved them! I needed to feed 7 people so I doubled the recipe.  I also added chopped red onion that I lightly sauteed.  We didn't do the chopped celery, no one seemed to want it but kept everything the same.  My only problem was the burgers were very difficult to shape being so soft, I ended up doing them on top of the stove, was afraid they slide through the grill.  I think next time I'll add some ground up instant chicken stuffing mix to firm them up  (and maybe stretch the chicken to make more).  Everyone thought they were great and I'll definitely be making these again.

Great recipe!  Added more hot sauce and cooked them inside on a grill pan because I was worried they would fall apart on our gas grill (and it was 102 degrees outside).  Just delicious!

the boys loved this one.  Nice change from burgers.  I followed the advise of some others and added an egg and a bit of bread crumbs.  I also put them in the freezer for a couple of hours to firm up.  I had no problems with falling apart on the grill.  I used Frank's Red hot in the meat and Franks Buffalo sauce to glaze in the grill. Excellent!

I really liked these! We ended up cooking them on the stovetop, but grilling would have been fantastic. Th only thing i changed was to add diced red onion and the celery inside of the burgers. I'll definitely make these again.

YUMMY!  I did not make the sauce for the top (I do not care for blue cheese, but my husband does).  Instead, I mixed lettuce with blue cheese (for my husband) and ranch (for me) and put it on top of the burger.  I will most definitely be making these again.

This was ok - I don't see the flavor as bold, as the recipe claimed. Glad I tried it out first before making it for my husband. Really liked the idea, but it was just so-so in my opinion.

my husband said "this could quite possibly be the best chicken sandwich i've ever had!" i didnt use sliced celery, still out of this world! *****update****. for those who think the burgers will fall thru or fall apart on the grill. trust me, they wont. super soft and tricky to form a patty, but once they're on the grill, they're good to go. also, please, follow the recipe as  is. outstanding..... no need to add bread crumbs or onions.

Very good burger.  I added an egg and bread crumbs.  Stayed together well and was just enough heat.  Lovely.  Will make this again.

These were really good. I loved them. the only thing i did different was use franks buffalo sauce inplace of the hot sauce. I thought there was just enough heat in them Dh said he would have liked a little more. but thats just his preference. will be making these again and again! thanks for sharing!

These were outstanding! My husband and I both loved them, but I can't give 5 stars because I didn't make it exactly as written.  I added blue cheese crumbles to the chicken mix, instead of making the 'dressing' I used low-fat blue cheese dressing and I didn't put the celery on it.  So, to be fair I can't rate it at 5. However, I will be making these again and again. If you like buffalo chicken cheese steaks...you'll love these.

Followed recipe exactly. I went bunless and it was flavorful. My husband said it needed more hot sauce, but he had a bun. I would say ramp up the amount of ingredients and hot sauce if everyone is using buns.

My family really enjoys these.  I made them exactly as recipe says first time and they were perfect.  My favorite hot sauce for cooking is Frank's! Tonight I made them and didn't have celery or celery salt so I added celery flakes to the patties and only had store bought blue cheese, not as good but worked in a pinch.  The original recipe is perfect and doesn't need any adjusting.  Also, the left over patty was delicious crumbled over a salad for lunch the next day.

These were a hit. If anyone complains about consistency, try grinding your own chicken. I used large hole metal thing (official term?) on my Kitchen Aide meat grinder, consistency was great. And I can control what exactly goes into my ground chicken.  Picky kids loved them.

This was pretty good once we figured out how to actually cook them. My BF does not like blue cheese so I did not make the dressing for us which I understand is the good flavorful part of the dish.  The issue with cooking- we don't have a grill so we were going to just use the stove top and pan, but the mixture was extremely wet and we couldn't really even form them into burgers and sure would not be able to flip without falling apart.  It was already late so we didn't have time to freeze for a bit.  Instead we put them in muffin tins and baked for quite some time at I believe 350 (it's summertime so we tried not to crank the oven).  After a while the top was nice and golden brown, but the bottoms were still wet and just kind of gooey/ gross looking.  We just flipped them out of the cupcake pan onto a regular pan and cooked some more.  They ended up pretty decent.  I would use way more hot sauce since we both LOVE buffalo sauce.  I would try again and maybe pre make and freeze them so they can be cooked on the stove top.

I made these burgers as written except for using turkey instead of chicken because that's what I had on hand.  We found them enjoyable and fun but a bit unbalanced.  The flavor was strongly of hot sauce and blue cheese which is tasty but lacked personality and depth.

These burgers turned out great! Wasn't sure what to do with the ground chicken I got on sale and this was the perfect solution. I only used 1lb of ground chicken (that's all I had), so I reduced the hot sauce but a tablespoon or so, but I could have left it in for some additional heat. I left all the other measurements the same - next time I might add more poultry seasoning just to kick up the flavor. The only thing I added to the burger mixture itself was some chopped onion. As per other reviews, I formed the patties and stuck them in the freezer for about 20 minutes to firm them up before going on the grill. For the sauce, I was liberal with the blue cheese (love blue cheese, can't have enough) and added a bit of garlic powder and pepper as per other reviews. The chopped celery adds an interesting taste and texture; I could do without it but I get where the recipe is going by adding that. They took quite a while on the grill but it was well worth it. Will be making these again for sure and will try out some different toppings!

Probably the best burger I've ever had.  Beef, turkey, chicken, whatever, this one takes the cake! Couldn't make the bleu cheese sauce b/c hubby hates bleu cheese, so  topped it with Swiss. Also mixed together Ranch and Franks Red and it was divine!

Made these just tonight....Loved them! I followed recipe, except instead of celery salt I use celery seed (what I had, and didn't miss the x-tra bit of salt. Also, a bit more cayenne & Frank's Red Hot, as we like spicy) :) My hubby loved em too. Definitely will make again...probably next week!

These were good. Really good. I followed the recipe to a tee, just added a whole chopped onion for some more flavor and moisture. The cheese sauce wasnt that great..might tinker with it next time or just top with cheese/ranch.

I thought these were good, but mine did fall apart easy on the grilled, despite being well-oiled.  Flavor of the burger was good, though.  For the dressing, I was out of sour cream so I used Greek yogurt and added a little mayo to make it less yogurty.  I also added minced celery to to chicken mixture instead of serving celery on top - I just prefer it cooked a bit instead of raw.  All in all, a good burger!

I LOVE Buffalo Chicken, but I did not care for these burgers at all. They fell apart on the George Foreman even after adding breadcrumbs. I'll stick to regular turkey burgers and buffalo chicken.

Made these as written, except I used ground turkey because I couldn't find ground chicken in my store.  I thought the blue cheese mixture overpowered the burger a little - I love blue cheese so it's not like it tasted bad - just hoping for a little more buffalo flavor from the burger to come through.  Did not have a problem falling apart or being too dry.  Glad I tried it and will be making again because they are tasty!  I may try putting the blue cheese in the burger next time.  Thanks for sharing!

I fried them stove-top, and put diced up red onions and mushrooms in them. They were a little dry, but I over cooked them a little bit- I'm not used to making chicken burgers. I made them for 3 red meat eatin' guys and they goobled them down right away =)

I followed the recipe, but feeling adventurous, I added one packet of dry roasted onion and garlic soup, one diced red onion and coated them in shake and bake! broiled in the oven! DELICIOUS! Instead of blue cheese, I tossed some coleslaw mix in ranch dressing and also used lettuce. I changed it alot, but it wouldnt have been possible without the original! Thank you!

I used ground turkey instead of chicken - I don't know about your grocery store, but ground chicken is twice as expensive here ($6 a lb!)  We used plain mayo instead of the blue cheese mixture for topping, high-fiber wheat buns instead of kaiser rolls, I used Frank's Original RedHot sauce, and I left out the cayenne pepper in the meat mixture (thought it might be too spicy for the 8yo).  Those are the only changes I made.  I did freeze the patties for about 20 minutes after I formed them, as they seemed soft.  I'm used to cooking hamburger patties on the grill, so I use a very low heat to avoid flare-ups.  I've never done turkey patties before - they won't flare-up, and they need to be cooked more quickly and at a higher heat or they'll dry out - A LEARNING EXPERIENCE FOR ME!  So, they were a little dry but the flavor was very good.  I'll give them one more try for sure, using the higher heat and maybe adding an egg like others here mentioned.  I'm a HUGE fan on Frank's RedHot sauce!  Love it!

This burger was really tasty.  I ground up some thigh meat myself and added onions.  I did not make the sauce but it was still incredible.  For a chicken burger, it was NOT dry at all!  So good!  It was really spicy so if you want to cut down on the spice, I suggest less hot sauce.

Good idea.  I used texas pete's wing sauce to get most of the flavor. I didn't have celery salt but that would have been great. I added some cut up celery just because I had it, but you couldn't taste it. I added butter to the burger because I was cooking in a pan.  My boyfriend said they weren't hot enough, but you can play around with the heat.  I know I am totally wrecking the recipe, but that is not my goal here...I just wanted to let you know if you don't use blue cheese they are still great.  We hate blue cheese so we just left it out. I will make again.

These were awesome!  I skipped the celery and celery salt and added a little garlic salt instead.  I also added some italian bread crumbs and let the patties chill in the fridge for a few hours before cooking to let the flavors develop and so they would hold together better.  They were so moist and delicious and I loved that they were healthy too!  This one is a keeper!

Really fabulous burgers - and LOVED the dressing and the burgers.  We grilled them on non-stick aluminum foil and that worked out perfectly.  The only thing to remember is to brush them with more hot pepper sauce before they're finished - the first time we didn't and they weren't as good.  Kids liked them very well, also!

This is a Great burger. It is great with even regular blue cheese. You don't have to make the Blue Cheese if you don't want to or don't have time! ;)

I love this recipe.  Its a healthier alternative to hot wings but still satisfied my husbands want for wings.  My husband doesn't like blue cheese so I swapped ranch for the blue cheese but think that the blue cheese would have complimented it much better.  We also used the whole wheat sandwich thins instead of the kaiser rolls and it was delicious!
