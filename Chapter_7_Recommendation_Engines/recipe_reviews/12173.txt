I made this pie but to call it a chess pie is a mistake. The pie is ok in its own right but a true chess pie does not have fruit or nuts vinegar is a necessity and a chess pie is sweeter and creamier and made with a dash of cornmeal for browning the top. The pie is pretty good for a some other kind of pie my husband really enjoyed it and my son ate almost all of it. It was a hit in our house but not a chess pie.
