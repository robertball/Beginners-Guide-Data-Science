This is the best Zucchini bread.. I make it just as the recipes indicates and put it into 2 loaf pans.. It turns out everytime great.. The pineapple is a great addition.  I have made this numerous times. A sure keeper..:)

Soooo good.  Made it for a family dinner dessert, didn't make frosting, but had whipped cream.  So many people that had said they couldn't stand zucchini asked for the recipe..
Have made his recipe with carrot and is just as good.

This recipe put my neighbor in an awkward situation—he thinks it’s better than his mom’s. Everyone loved it, which hardly ever happens. I didn’t have all the ingredients, but the basic recipe allows for some changes. I used raisins, dates and slivered almonds, but omitted the pineapple.
