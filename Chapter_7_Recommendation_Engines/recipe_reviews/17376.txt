I was so excited to make this recipe with so many favorite ingredients, but the first time I made it, I blamed the results on tough meat from the butcher. However, I made it a second time with more tenderized meat, and it was just bland. Maybe some more spices to add richness to it???

I read the reviews and improvised a bit...I used a dark ale and 1/4 water with 1/4 broth. I caramelized the onions and slow cooked the peppers separately by sauteeing it for 20 minutes. I then added it with the steak. 
For an added kick, I added three serrano peppers to the flour mixture. Came out pretty good!

I made this for my husband and I for dinner one night.  Didn't tell him what I was making, but he could smell the "delicious smells!"  Very good recipe.  Leftovers were delicious, too!

Recipe is fine, I added crem√© fraiche at end and thickened a little. I'd cut my meat smaller next time as I like not to have to cut it while eating a stew. Would also try it as a casserole in the oven as I think the flavours would mature more.

Very bland, not much taste.  We didn't hate the recipe, we just couldn't taste it.

It was easy to make and very delicious. We ate dinner later than planned, because the preparation took a little bit longer than 5 min. You have to keep in mind that veggies need to be cut and chopped, it takes longer than stated, at least for me.

Fast and easy recipe. Added some ground red pepper for more zip. Omitted the green pepper. Overall, I thought it was a good recipe. Thanks for the recipe. Will make it again!

I liked this dish a Lot! I was out of most of the veggies so decided to make it basically a stroganoff. I added some steak sauce with the beef bullion and simmered it about an hour, after which I added some sour cream. There was no noodles in the pantry so I made a wild rice to go under this yummy beef. DELISH! Thank you Jill Keeper;;)

I used a chocolate beer, added 2 chopped ghost peppers, 2T garlic, 1 can petite cut tomatoes w/chiles and it was yummy.
