I have been making this recipe for years. I don't change a thing with the recipe. I make it exactly as written and it is excellent.

We love all the ingredients contained in this recipe, however we did not care for this salad at all ... 

I will give it another go, leaving out the peanuts (didn't work for us) and add chopped egg, shredded sharp cheddar and more chopped onion ...
Will also be using a LOT LESS Italian dressing ...

Thank you for the recipe though not one I'll repeat as posted ...

Next time I'd skip the peanuts. The crunchy peanuts overpowered the peas to me. Interesting idea though.

This was ok for me. I thought that 1 cup of Italian dressing was too much for this, so I scaled it back to 1/2 cup, and that seemed to be plenty. The family didn't really care for it...We LOVE peas, but I'm thinking maybe we are not pea 'salad' people. I was glad to try this for something different, though...Thanks for sharing. :)

I make this receipe quite often and it is a family favourite.  Usually I serve the dressing on the side rather than mix it in as the leftovers keep better that way.
