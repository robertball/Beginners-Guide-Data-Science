First time I have been inspired to post a review despite using the site for a couple of years now. I needed to use up an opened box of elbow macaroni and found this 'recipe for one.' This mac-n-cheese recipe was absolutely delicious. Loved the flavor and texture - very creamy. Some 'scratch' mac-n-cheese recipes seem to require too much flour or baking time and the texture can be very grainy. Not this one!  Only changes - I omitted the worcestorshire and used a little extra cheese on top. Now, I just need to scale the recipe to serve several people and I will proudly prepare it for our next family gathering. Yummy!!!

Since I was only cooking for myself today, this recipe was right on time.  I pretty much followed the recipe except I baked it longer and at 425 degrees because I like my mac & cheese browned on the bottom and edges.  The recipe isn't real cheesy but the onion powder and other spices gives it a nice flavor boost.  Just taste the cheese sauce before adding the macaroni and if it isn't cheesy enough, just add more.  I'm counting calories so I thought it was just right.  I used panko breadcrumbs which always add a nice crunch. As I was eating, I thought about adding a little chopped broccoli to the dish when I make it again for a quick broccoli mac & cheese dish.  I baked it in one of my mini au gratin dishes, and it fit perfectly.  A really nice recipe that I will make again.

My very favorite macaroni and cheese is....Kraft!...doctored up with....Velveeta! I don't have mac and cheese often and on the rare occasions I do none of the homemade recipes I've tried have ever held a candle to that boxed stuff and this recipe was no exception. The flavor was okay - I used a mix of mild cheddar (for creaminess),  sharp Cheddar and Gruyere (for flavor), and skipped the bread crumbs. But I have to agree with "love my kids" who commented she'd add more macaroni in the future. There was just too much heavy sauce which totally overwhelmed the macaroni.  I will still be on the look-out for something that beats that little blue box!

Awesome! I get a hankering for mac and cheese every once in a while, and BF detests it (what's wrong with him?!?!) so I can never make it for dinner. I make this for myself for lunch now to cure my craving. Any pasta will do really, penne/ziti is actually my fave, but I use whatever's on hand. I adjust if a bit by adding a sprinkle of smoked paprika, and prefer to use a non-vinegary hot sauce, not tabasco for this one. Instead of breadcrumbs I sprinkle french fried onions on top, then the cheese and bake... SO GOOD!!! Be sure, as with any roux based sauce, that you let it thicken properly (before adding the cheese), otherwise you will end up with it 'soupy' as one reviewer described... Use the 2 minutes as a guideline, but if it's still thin, give it another minute or 2 til it looks right. Would definately scale this up and serve to guests, especially around the holidays!  UPDATE:  I now use the cheesy sauce (double amts) in my tuna casserole and it's AWESOME... try it!  DOUBLE UPDATE:  I don't suggest making this ahead of time... I scaled it up and made it an hour or so before baking and it wasn't as smooth as it is when you bake it right away, the sauce kind of starts to coagulate...  I did however adapt the recipe to be gluten free for a friend with celiacs by using brown rice macaroni  and white rice flour (just know that a gluten free roux is thinner, but it bakes up ok in the end).  She said it was really good and hadn't been able to have mac N cheese for a looong time.

Fantastic, creamy, and satisfying mac-n-cheese with this quick and easy recipe. The Hubster loved it and said it was the best he's ever had. Didn't change a thing and will definitely be making this one again. Since it's just the two of us, I love that I can make single servings and we don't have an enormous amount of leftovers to deal with. Thanks for the great recipe! :)

This recipe is darned close to my personal one- it's nice to see a "mini-mac" recipe! Real macaroni and cheese is about good, comforting REAL food. Good food, good recipe- kudos to you, for a great alternative to the boxed kind!

Why would anyone make one serving of mac n cheese that requires all this work?  I scratched my head at thought of measuring out only 3 TBS. of uncooked pasta?  You can still make this a mac n cheese for one, but make 3 or 4 portions of them at once, freezing the rest.  The measurements on this recipe need to be quadrupled and made into FOUR one-serving portions.  You prepare ONCE and eat FOUR TIMES!

Finally!  I've been looking for months for a creamy/saucy homemade mac n cheese recipe that's also tasty- and I've found it!  Thank you cody's mama for posting ur pic- which made me try this recipe.  My first successful roux.  I followed the recipe pretty closely, only changes were to double the recipe (kept baking time the same) and replaced bread crumbs with Ritz crumbs.  The pasta-to-sauce ratio was perfect, i like my pasta slightly drowning in sauce.  Some of the ingredients (worchestershire and hot sauce) might sound weird for a mac n cheese recipe, but they actually help this one stand out (in a good way) without being too bold.  but, it does give it a more grown-up taste.  for a more traditional taste, i would omit the sauces (and maybe even the mustard) and add more cheese.  The reviewer who found it too salty might have used salted butter.  thanks amydoll for this recipe!

Quite salty and not very cheesy. Best to let it sit for 10-15 minutes after baking to solidify the sauce and avoid eating macaroni and cheese soup.

My friend made this for me last night, and it was delicious! I really liked the taste of the mustard in the cheese sauce...it added a nice little kick! I watched her make the dish, and it looked like she followed the recipe exactly. If I were making it, I might add a pinch of nutmeg to the sauce for a little extra flavor, though extra flavor was certainly not needed. This makes a great meal on a chilly autumn night! Saving to my personal recipes so I can give it a try myself...

Perfectly sized for one! I added chopped up broccoli before putting it in the oven, and it was delicious. I might leave out the mustard next time, though.

It was awesome!!! Made it exactly and it turned out great. I will definitely be making this again. Also whoever said utterly foul tasting Kraft box Mac n cheese is better than this is disturbing to people who actually cook!

Really good. I omitted the mustard, Wsauce and the hotsauce, and it was wonderful. I used 3 heaped tbsp of macaroni, and was afraid it wouldn't be enough, but the creamy sauce makes it substantial enough for one person, I could hardly finish it!  Thank you for a great recipe!

I loved the flavor of the sauce, it has nice depth with the mustard and worcestershire.I didn't have hot sauce, so I used a couple pinches of chili powder and it tasted great. (scaled for 8  people)   I also sprinkled the cheese on top with some panko breadcrumbs and it was nice and crispy.  I'll be making this again for sure.

I've been using this as the basis of my macaroni and cheese recipe for years!  I always make a larger batch of it and I've tweaked the amounts of Worcestershire and mustard to suit everyone's tastes, but it's a great recipe ^_^

This is a very tasty mac & cheese. Beware though when increasing the serving size. I wanted to make 8 little ramekins, so I upped the serving size to 8 on the recipe. The measurements all adjusted and so I went with what it said, even though I thought it all sounded like too much for the amount of macaroni. Turns out I was right - by the time I added the macaroni to the sauce, it was swimming. WAY too much sauce. I ended up just scooping the macaroni out of the sauce into the little dishes and saved the rest so I can make another batch sometime soon (just add some cooked macaroni). So, it's very good - just be careful when you want to make more than one serving!

This is a winner! Easy, basic and still tasty - could easily modify or leave it the way it is. I doubled the amount of pasta (would recommend doing so), left out the bread crumbs, and used dijon mustard instead of mustard powder (didn't have any). Can't wait to show this off at the next potluck ;)

This is the recipe I've been trying to create for years!  The best I've had by far homemade.  It is as good (or better) than the mac & cheese at two local restaurants that I've been trying to duplicate.  The sauce has the perfect consistency and flavor.  I use fresh shaved parmesan on top instead of cheddar for a different flavor.  Thanks for a perfect recipe! Who ever said the boxed stuff is better is crazy, this is the BEST!

I've been looking for a good homemade mac and cheese recipe that uses real cheese (not velveeta) and this one was getting there. It still has a bit of the gritty texture, I guess from the flour. I quadrupled the recipe and made about a cup of pasta, but it made twice as much cheese sauce as I needed. Not a big deal, I just froze the rest. Next time I'd make a cup of pasta and only double the cheese sauce recipe, if I make this recipe again. I liked the worcestershire and hot sauce added in.

I'm giving this 3 stars because I increased the quantitiy to 6 servings, and cooked in a casserole dish and I don't think this receipe is meant to be increased/baked like that.... With that said, I did follow the directions exactly as far as ingredients and it was just ok. Not cheesey creamy like I hoped. It was more of a flour based creamy and I prefer the cheesey kind. My family didn't care for it much either and ended up tossing the majority of it. Keep to the individual receipe and you may have better results.

I scaled the recipe for 2 batches and I also had too much sauce but I did use most of it. I added more cheese but no mustard. I forgot it. I did add some chipotle peppers in adobo sauce which was really good. When I pulled it out of the oven I was sure there was too much sauce but then I cooked for 5 more min then let stand for 5 min and it turned out great. The texture is a little off but maybe I just didnt cook the sauce long enough. I will try again using the single serving. Not a complete failure as it still tastes good but I can see where it can be improved but that's not the recipes fault.

Made this the other night and wished I had made more. The DH loved it. I had the right amount of sauce for the type of pasta I used. I am a cheese lover so i added more cheese than called for and I also used sharpe cheese mixed with a little colby. other than that i changed the servings to 2 and followed the recipe to the t. With this recipe i can now say goodby to the processed blue box AKA kraft mac and cheese.

I'm not the best judge for mac and cheese, I don't personally care for it.  But my guys do, so I gave this a try.  The texture was a little strange to me, so I think I will try the evaporated milk next time.  BF also likes real onion in it, so I will add that too.  It took longer than 2 mins for the sauce to thicken, but keep heating and stirring, it eventually does (about 4-5 mins for me).  I quadrupled the recipe and baked individual servings in ramekins.  I liked that it used ingredients I usually have on hand.  Overall it was ok, but the guys weren't crazy about it.  Maybe it just needs a few tweaks for us.

UPDATE: I have since made this a few times, and have determined that this recipe is decidedly better with the Brilliant Sauteed Broccoli in it than it is all by itself. I will put the broccoli in it from now on. Also, I quadrupled the recipe once and used the full two cups milk, and found it made WAY too much sauce that was MUCH less cheesy. If I make larger quantities again, I will definitely cut the milk in half to preserve the cheesiness. ORIGINAL REVIEW: I read the reviews before making this, and decided to reduce the salt to 1/8 tsp and increase the macaroni to 1/4 cup. I eyeballed the milk, and probably didn't use a 1/2 a cup, but it worked out fine. I added some leftover Brilliant Sauteed Broccoli (from this site), and because of the crushed red pepper in that recipe, left out the hot sauce in this one. I made it for my two year old, and he just gobbled it up. I tried it, and was surprised that I liked it as well (usually I am okay with the flavor, but hate the texture) , so this will definitely go into the rotation!

I don't think I'll ever buy store bought mac n cheese again.  I made this for my 2 year old for lunch because it was raining and didn't want to go out. I had all the ingredients on hand and even threw in some minced broccoli. Really good and easy!

Very good, but a touch greasy.  I suppose anything with that much cheese and butter it should be expected.  Kids really liked it.  Will make it again.

Perhaps I made a mistake along the way but this didn't have a particularly cheesy flavor for me. It is a good recipe, simple to make. It gets 4 stars for that. Most other mac and cheese recipes I've found online are more work than this one is and I don't feel the simplicity in the recipe is what made it the flavor not work well for me. I'll experiment with other cheeses and see if that improves the taste and update my rating then.

Awesome! I tripled the recipe then added about 3 tbsp of butter before I added the flour/spice mix and then I threw in a 1/4 cup of parmigiana. It was so perfectly gooey and delicious!

I did not eat this, but made it for my husband. It was very clear he ate it, but would never request it again. I might make it in a pinch or for a child. I threw some ham in it when I made it for my dh.

Excellent!  Just what I was looking for.  I used extra sharp cheese and a panko bread crumbs/Parmesan cheese mixture on top.  I will be making this again!

I made this tonight and quadrupled the recipe. I used low fat milk and cheese and used dijon mustard in place of ground mustard and it was delicious. I baked it in a small casserole dish. Since I used low fat cheese, the crust on top was sort of hard...next time I'll just top it with the bread crumbs (Panko)...
Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

I made this last night, doubling the recipe so that I could have one for my husband as well. There has to be an error in the recipe ingredient quantities, because there was an incredible amount of sauce for the paltry amount of pasta. I had to stop and make more, ending up almost quadrupling the pasta quantity in order to get the right consistency.  I omitted the hotsauce and used a bread crumb sprinkle on top consisting of bread crumbs, panko crumbs and grated parmesan cheese. The result was acceptable, but a bit bland. It needs some stronger cheese flavour.

Delicious!  I left out the worcestershire sauce and hot sauce because I didn't have any, but it was still delicious.  So creamy!  I saw a couple reviewers saying there was too much sauce/not enough macaroni.  I don't think upping the macaroni just a little would hurt it, but I didn't think it was too much.  Just make sure you let it sit before you eat it.  This is an awesome mac n cheese recipe that I will use as a basis for tweaking my own version in the future : )  Thanks!

I am post GBS and trying to maintain my weight. Recently I found a product on Dr. OZ called Shitake Tofu noodles which are 0 carb and 20 calories a bag (2.50$). I am now on the lookout for recipes for 1-2 in which I can use these noodles. I think I will go with the panko as well (as another reveiwer suggested) or see if I can find a sub at my local Health Food super market. Also I know on the same site that sells the noodles there is a product to replace thickener like cornstarch and flour which I am sure I can get at the local health store as well. Thanks for this. Will try and rate again. I am sure I can make this work.

This was a very good basic recipe but I found it a little too soupy and bland for my taste.  I tweaked things a bit and now I have a fantastic recipe. I find that ground mustard is too harsh a flavor so I used yellow mustard (1/2 tsp) in addition to 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder (not garlic salt).  Finally to make it less soupy, I increased the pasta by one heaping tablespoon and slightly increased the amount of cheese, using used sharp cheddar.  To my taste, this is outstanding.

A tad too salty but I used just regular marble cheese which could have made it more salty.  I used 7 tablespoons of uncooked small shell pasta.  I also cooked the flour, butter, onion, salt and pepper for about a minute or so before adding the milk.  I find it cooks off the floury taste.  Great recipe!  Really easy to make and very delicious!!

To be honest, as I started melting the butter, I realized the only milk I had was vanilla soy milk. :O You'd think that'd ruin it, but it wasn't bad! Next time, though, I'd add a few more spices. Maybe some garlic. Otherwise, pretty good!

YUM!! I am in college and was looking for a quick, easy, cheap meal. This is absolutely delicious and so easy to make! It's so creamy! I used mexican blend cheese (left over from taco night) and water instead of milk (out of milk...) and an extra tablespoon of butter. I will make this again!

This is my go-to recipe for homemade Mac! While I've tried others from this site, this one just beats them all. It's creamy, flavorful and easy to increase servings size with no ill effects. I prefer cavatappi noodles, cook them 6 minutes, because it gives it a more grown up texture. I made this for Easter dinner, so I increased it to 12 servings. It feels like too much milk-flour ratio, but if you let it sit for about ten minutes, just below a boil, the roux is perfect! I have added pancetta in the past to make it a main course. This last time I added frozen peas/carrots to the roux and let it sit for ten minutes before adding the pasta back. I like my Mac n cheese with color. 
In addition, I don't always do this, but this time I used vanilla coconut milk and it gave it a slightly sweet taste. I skipped the Tabasco as I used a true Dijon mustard with Chardonnay in place of the ground mustard. This gave it a tang and helped balance out the flavor. 
Believe it or not, the first time I made this I followed the recipe to a T, terrific! But all of these changes have not turned it on its head and I will continue to experiment with different ideas. For now, no one has complained. :)

Superb and fast! I prefer shell pasta, so I used a 1/2 c. of small shells. Didn't have hot sauce, so I used a dash of cayenne pepper. Didn't have worcheshire sauce, so I subbed a dash of tamari soy sauce. This is my new go-to recipe!!! I personally like chopped hot dog in my mac n cheese, so I boiled the hot dog with the pasta and mixed it into the mac n cheese before topping with the bread crumbs and cheese. FABULOUS!!!

I made this Thanksgiving and have to say "it was all right", to be fair I was looking for a recipe similar to what my Mom made. This was not it. Also, I left out the hot sauce and Worcestershire sauce. I did add extra cheese because I love cheese. Sorry, not for me

I was so hopeful about this recipe.  I was supposed to bring the Mac and cheese for Thanksgiving, so it had to be good!  I tried the small portion to see how it would taste.  It was salty, gummy not creamy, and just not good.  I was very disappointed.

While the flavor was there, the sauce did not set up properly and separated after it went into the oven. Next time I will cook the milk mixture longer than 2 minutes.   Other than that, it tasted great!

My kids loved it!  It was perfectly fine for their taste buds w/o the onion powder, hot sauce and bread crumbs which I didn't have in my pantry.  I'd also cut back on the amount of milk!

ok so first this was amazing ive always been too afraid to make homemade mac and cheese but my daughter and bf loved it!!!! i upped the ingredients to make for everyone and it came out wonderful it was soooo flavorful when i mixed the noodles and the sauce together, BUT i was wondering if anyone else found that, the flavor was lacking once it came out of the oven? it was still super good but was lacking some of the flavor it had before i put it in the oven! can anyone help me figure out how to fix this problem? thank you for an amazing recipie!

YUM!!!  I used Medium cheddar.  I made this as an individual side dish served in ramekins.  It had a bit of zest to it which my husband noticed right away (thanks to the dash of Worcestershire and hot sauce) and he asked that I make this whenever we have mac & cheese.

This was REALLY good.  I didn't have milk in the house, so I used 1/4 cup sour cream mixed with 1/4 cup water to sub for the milk.  I'll do the same thing when I make it again - it added a nice tanginess.  I also used sharp cheddar.  The hot sauce and worcestershire sauce made me nervous, but I put three shakes of each in the sauce and I'm SO glad I did.  Perfect extra flavor!  I skipped the bread crumbs & shredded cheese on top and grated some Parmigiano-Reggiano on top  instead before baking.   My husband (who'd told me he wasn't hungry) was jealous that I didn't make any for him!

I wanted to make something quick and easy for lunch. I was craving mac and cheese and i am glad i made this one. It was the perfect taste, gooey and cheesy, and the hot and worcestershire sauces added the right taste. I will definetely be making this again. My sister absolutely loved it too. Thanks!

thank you, thank you!!  Great recipe, I've made it several times! I've kept it as is for the most part, except I added more cheese (personal preference) ..I also mixed the bread crumbs with a little bit of melted butter for the topping! Everything is perfect!!!   Thanks again for a great "go to comfort food"!!!

I will definitely make it  again, however I did not use the ground mustard, worchestire sauce,  and onion powder. I did use those ingredients in the beginning and then I did not my second time. It for sure tasted better.  It is delicious and a total comfort food for me.

Great recipe! I used mild cheddar cheese. And I added an extra 1/3c macaroni and a little extra cheese. I didn't use the mustard, Worcestershire or hot sauce but will try next time. I even added a small head of broccoli to the last three minutes when the pasta was cooking and I grated it when it was cool and added it in with the pasta. Will definitely be making again. My husband is allergic to cheese so this is perfect for me when he's away I can get my cheese fix! :)

AMAZING RECIPE. One thing, add a ton more pasta than it says. Following this recipe the ratio of pasta to cheese sauce was like 1:3. That's good if you like cheese, but even then it is wayyyy too much. In the future I would double the pasta but keep everything else the same.

This has become a staple in our house, it's a great recipe! You get a little kick and flavor with the hot sauce. I usually add leftover chicken, turkey or bacon to give it a little more protein. I would recommend this to any mac n' cheese lover!

I have made this recipe twice. The first time it wasn't thick enough or cheesy enough. The second time I made it I used aged white cheddar and Wisconsin cheese and cooked the sauce longer. It was fantastic. Even reheated it was moist and flavorful. Am going to try it with several different cheeses to change the taste but will make it again and again.

I changed the servings to 8, and what I got was an incredibly salty, soupy mess. I even drained some of the milk mixture off before baking. Wouldn't make again. :(

Very versatile recipe!  I double it for dinners for two and when I'm in a hurry I substitute the cheddar for 3-4 Kraft singles and it works out just fine.  Then I sprinkle the top with some grated Parmesan and I make it my own.  I also didn't have Worcestershire sauce when I first tried the recipe and so instead I used soy sauce which worked out fine so now I just use that instead.  It's a basic recipe that works out lovely and I've made it many times and it has come out perfectly in every instance.

Yum. This was good and since I live alone, it's always nice to find a recipe scaled for one serving (though I did double it and make two individual servings - one for lunch tomorrow). I did use a bit more pasta than called for (a heaping 1/2 cup for my double batch). When I put it in the baking dishes, I thought it was too much sauce even with the extra pasta, but after baking it was the perfect amount of sauciness. I did find the texture of the sauce a touch off - I wouldn't say 'grainy' but could have been creamier for my tastes (probably achievable with using whole milk). It was also quite greasy after baking but a better quality cheddar than I used might prevent that. I would definitely make this again, though maybe flavoured a bit differently. I might have been too heavy handed with my 'dash' of Worcestershire but I found that flavour a bit strong and think I would omit it in the future. Thanks for the recipe.

Way too bland and no cheesy sauce!  I suggest using 1/2 the flour, twice the onion powder, milk, mustard and using old sharp cheddar cheese.  Add the milk to the cooked rue and broil 1- 2 minutes after baking to crisp the topping.

I'm a glutton so I doubled the recipe...thank goodness because it was creamy delicious.  I added a little bit of thinly sliced ham cut up into small pieces.  For the cheese I used Colby Jack and also some shredded Italian blend that I had on hand.  I'm glad I didn't triple the recipe...I'd be needing a double bypass right about now.

Absolutely delicious! I tasted the cheese sauce before mixing in the macaroni and added a little more because it wasn't quite cheesy enough for my taste. 
Other than that I followed the recipe exactly- turned out great! So easy and delicious, thank you for the recipe.

I have been looking for a single serving of Macaroni and Cheese for so long, I have even tried to cut in half other recipes and it was never the same and was tired of having so much left over. Finally I have found one and tried it tonight, the only thing I found, it was a little too salty.  Other than that I will be making this again, will just have to keep reducing the salt till I get the right flavour. Thank you so much for giving me Mac and Cheese that I have been looking for in a one size portion.

Loved This! Made it for a baby party and everyone was asking me for the recipe. They said it was so creamy. Very good. If I ever have an extra 20 minutes, I will make this instead of the box made mac and cheese.

This was fine.  I quadrupled the recipe and it was good but not great.  Very easy and I'll make it again when I don't feel like doing much or have much time.  I wouldn't serve it for company.

My favorite thing about this recipe is that there's no nasty processed cheese in it and it's still gooey and delicious. We added a half a cup of spicy green chiles to the butter/flour concoction and it was wonderful.

I am partial to Mac and Cheese, so I decided to try this quick fix. However, I was short on a few ingredients so I changed it up a bit. I used 4 tbs macaroni, 1/8 tsp salt, omitted onion powder, Werchestershire sauce, and hot sauce; and used 1.5 tsp bread crumbs. So easy to make!!

I made as directed (substituting quinoa pasta, gluten-free flour, and GF breadcrumbs to satisfy a food allergy) and it was wonderful!!  The flavor was fantastic; the sauce was rich and creamy.  Delicious!  I suppose I should note that I used skim milk and reduced fat cheese, which wasn't the problem that I feared.  I will make again, but next time cook a few more noodles and decrease the salt just a touch.  It was a little salty for my taste, but very enjoyable.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This made way too much sauce.  My son wanted to make this for his carry-in for school, so I scaled it to make 16 servings for the 16 oz box of pasta.  Sauce needs more cheese flavor and was way too mustardy for my taste, though he seemed to like it.  I mixed the pasta with half the cheese sauce and put the rest in the fridge, hopefully it will keep until I can use it for supper tomorrow.  I might try again, use more cheese and way less ground mustard.  We'll see.

I've made homemade macncheese from scratch in the past and none have ever come close to my liking. This recipe is to die for. The cheese sauce had a wonderful taste. I will use this recipe over and over. Thank you.

This is a great recipe! I use dijon mustard instead of mustard powder (and usually put in a small spoonful) and I like to add extra hot sauce.

The taste was ok, but I'm still looking for a cheese sauce that doesn't congeal within minutes.

Very delicious, very quick. I added minced onion and garlic to the butter until the onions were translucent, then proceeded from there. Next time I will skip the mustard; I found it to be overpowering. Overall, great recipe!

Quite good. Use "bigger" pasta shapes like shells or macaroni and a nice sharp cheese (or cheese blend) for best flavor. A sprinkle of chili powder works well.

I calculated to feed 12. Something just wasn't right. Had to cook more macaroni because it ended up soupy. Didn't think it tasted all that great.

Fabulous! However, imo I think that it needs MUCH more pasta.  Double it at least.  No more embarrassing midnight trips to 7eleven to pick up the cheesy crack! This is the stuff.

I thought the sauce was way too much for the noodle amount- so I halved it and used the other half on broccoli baked the same way. 
Another reviewer said it gets grainy if not used right away...true. 
Does anyone have a way to remedy the grainy texture when sauce is leftover?

Delicious! The only thing I did different was use Italian breadcrumbs since that's all I had in the pantry. Easy recipe for myself and for making a larger serving.

Great recipe!  I have been using my mom's recipe for baked mac n cheese for years.  Family loves it!
2 c. cooked elbow mac
1 c. prepared Cheese product (Cheez Whiz)
1 c. grated Cheddar 
1/4-1/3 c milk
Prepared cornflake crumbs
2-3 Tbsp. Butter/Margarine
Cook mac in salted water 8-10 mins. Drain and return immediately to hot pot.  Add cheeses and 2 Tbsp butter/marg. Stir in hot pot until melted.  Pour/Spread mix into 8x8 glass baking dish.  Pour milk over mix until just level with mac mixture.  Top with cornflake crumbs (be generous).  Add 9 little pats of butter on top of the mixture.  Preheat oven at 350 deg. Bake for 1 hour or until crust is golden brown and crispy. Service with boiled weiners and dijonnaise mustard.  My family has loved this recipe for 40 years (before boxed Kraft)

The only reason I did not give 5 stars, was that one magical ingrediant that was missing that no one thinks of (it's what is missing out of most mac 'n cheeses), is just a dusting of garlic powder!!  Do not put a whole bunch, just a touch and it will be fabulous!!!  Happy cheesin'!!!!!

I thought the worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, onion powder and mustard powder added a really unique flavour to the sauce. I don't normally like onion in my mac and cheese because I find it overpowers the dish, but the powder added just the right amount of flavour. I also didn't add as much milk as the recipe suggested. It turned out great! I would definitely make this again!

Perfection! I quadrupled the recipe because I love mac and cheese. We had to rock paper scissor for the one serving left (I lost). So I'm on my way to the grocery right now to make it again. THANKS!

This recipe was great!  A wonderful departure from the bland mac and cheese recipes I've tried previously.  I did increase the pasta by 50% and used a pinch of cayenne pepper in place of the dash of hot sauce.  I accidentally put in an extra dash of Worcestershire sauce...I might stick with the recipe next time.  I'm inspired to expand the recipe for individual ramekins to serve with a fried chicken dinner!

This recipe has a nice creamy sauce with a great flavor kick. If you leave out the Worchestire sauce you are really missing something.  Mac and Cheese is my favorite comfort food, and this is my new favorite recipe for it.

This is my recipe so of course I have to give it 5 stars. I don't always add the worcestershire or the mustard, it's fine without it. And I've never had it be the least bit soupy. Make sure your sauce is good and thick before you add the cheese. Sometimes I use crushed crackers instead of the breadcrumbs.

Excellent flavor and quantity.  As a widow living alone I hesitate to cook many things owing to the amount of leftovers I will be faced with.  This made just enough for dinner and a hearty lunch serving the next day.  Terrific!

This is by far the best mac and cheese recipe I've found (and I've been looking for a long time)!  I added a little bit of garlic powder along with the onion powder, but that is a personal preference of mine. As for the review stating that Kraft Macaroni and Cheese is the best...these types of dishes are not meant to recreate the blue box.  If that's what you're after, just make a box.  But if you are looking for a warm, creamy, cheesy and easy pasta dish this is one of the best!  I too will have to figure out how to increase it to make it for more than just one!  Yummy!

This is a wonderful recipe that I have made several times. I have followed the recipe exactly and I don't feel I need to alter anything. Sometimes if I want a little extra protein, I'll add a little chopped, smoked ham which goes really well with the cheddar.

I converted this to four servings.  I left out the hot pepper sauce.  The only change I would make in the future when quadruple this is to add more macaroni. I did eyeball many of the smaller measurements. This was very creamy and delicious.  I found it to be plenty rich even though I used 2% cheddar and skim milk.  I've tried several mac & cheese recipes and this is very easy and yummy.  I will make this again!

Tripled the recipe so I could have it as a side dish at dinner. So easy to make and I had all the ingredients (save the hot sauce - not a big fan anyway) in the cupboard. Instead of the hot sauce, I added 1/4 tsp of chili powder - added a bit of a kick - and topped it off with 1/3 cup of mozzarella cheese, just to be a bit different. My kids and I loved it - just to note: my children don't like mac and cheese but they ate this recipe up without complaint.

To match with the amount of sauce, I generally make twice as much past as it calls for or more, but the flavour of this recipe is SERIOUSLY amazing

I have to cook for a child that has allergy to gluten! Now I can  just make them their own personal serving and the rest can have regular! I just tried this and thought it was great! I went a scant 1 tablespoon on GF flour after hearing a few reviews about being too thick, because it was for a child I used cheese I knew they would like and I also did not add the hot sauce but subbed some paprika instead. I loved the taste of it. I believe with mac and cheese you need to consider what kind of cheese the person you're cooking for likes.

Easy breezy.Also, very rare to find recipes for 1. Sure you can scale  down appropriately, but it is never as good as the intended portion size; espcially if you're scaling it own from 6 servings  to 2.

We are a family of one adult and a 13 Y.O. I naturally double the recipe. My teenage immediately requested seconds.She went on the make herself a second double helping. The only hot sauce in the house was habanero. Only 3 drops were used. Being out of onion powder a drastically reduced amount of garlic powder was used. When the youngster loves it, it deserves 5 stars.

Amazing recipe but I made a few changes. Defiantly 4-5 tablespoons of elbow macaroni. Any less, and it turns into macaroni soup. I also added bacon bits, cause every things better with bacon! And I didn't bake it at all, just added the pasta and enjoyed. I will defiantly make this again.

Have made this a few times and changed up the cheese. It really works best with cheddar and maybe a little bit of American mixed in. Great recipe - easy, fast, and good!

This was very satisfying and rich. I left out the hot sauce and added a few cooked buffalo chicken strips, cut into bite sized pieces. Filled my soup crock and I could not finish it.

I was searching for a great Mac and cheese base to for a home made kind of hamburger helper. This is perfect! I substituted corn starch for flour (I’m gluten free and didn’t ink my rice flour would be a good substitute). I added lean grass fed cooked ground beef. Was delicious!

I make this often because I love the combo of worcheshier and ground mustard with the hot sauce. I always change the portion sizing to 4 or 6 and double the pasta because there is just way too much sauce for that little amount of pasta. It's a good recipe to play with for sure.

Really good recipe. I think it includes too much onion powder so I recommend cutting that in half. I added a bit of parmesan and added in a whole serving of pasta instead of only 3 tablespoons.

I have made this at least 5 times and it is delicious. I do make it as a whole dish verses the individual cups, my husband and I love macaroni and cheese. I did change a few things in the recipe though. I prefer to use a whole onion instead of onion powder, but have made it both ways and it is still just as good with the powder. I also took out the hot sauce, mustard and Worcestershire sauce and used nutmeg instead to give it that traditional mac and cheese flavor. So good! I definitely recommend making it for dinner.

Was good, little bland but good base. I used 2 tbs flour 2 tbs butter  to one cup cream. I made enough for 8 servings. I used one cup of cheese in the white sauce and sprinkled more on top. Enough cheese, now just more flavor.

I use this recipe all the time as a base and jazz it up! If I am making it for two I just double or triple the amount of cheese (and using more pasta..)and as soon as I'm making it for 4 I'm doubling everything. My favourite variation is when I add pancetta/bacon and a drained can of diced tomatoes and I like it with seashell pasta. I make this at least once a week and the family LOVES it!! I've even used crushed garlic croutons in lieu of breadcrumbs on the top... sooooo yummy!

This is waayyy better then the boxed stuff, I can tell you that for one thing! This recipe was one of the only ones that I found that used real cheese and no evaporated milk which is nice but the only thing is, it's a serving for 1! I just adjusted it to 16 servings so the amounts were still quite even and then it could feed my big family of 8 (trust me, we are eaters!:)  Overall, great recipe and hey, if you stick with the original recipe, you may want to go ahead and double it anyways because you'll sure want to have seconds! :)

I doubled the recipe. I used small shells instead of macaroni noodles and I also used way more than what the recipe called for. I noted that someone said it was too salty, so I went light on the salt and it was good. I will be making this again.

Totally making this again. I added an extra tablespoon of butter and put breadcrumbs on the bottom as well as the top. I also didn't measure the cheese, I kind of just added until I ran out and it turned out AMAZING. NOTE FOR FIRST TIMERS: You need to melt the butter, THEN cook down the flour before adding the milk.

We liked this pretty well.  Made to the recipe the sauce  was more like an alfredo and, while that was tasty, it didn't taste like mac and cheese.  So, to my doubled recipe,  I added 1 tbsp of chopped onion, another 1/2 cup shredded cheese and 2 heaping tablespoons of Mexican queso.  Next time I will leave out the hot sauce and queso in favor of  a sharp cheddar cheese.   The amount and texture of the sauce was just right.  I  did use a heaping cup of pasta for the doubled recipe and baked in two small crocks for 10 min, then broiled for about 3 min. to crisp and brown the top.  Will make again.

Two things.  1) If you salt your pasta water, like you would, then cut down or omit the salt in the recipe, it's a bit much.  2) Absolutely double the amount of pasta.  Three stars as written, good base with adjustments.

We don't have cheddar cheese in France. I used Comte cheese and it's fantastic!  Definitely a favorite!

It's not really Mac and cheese. But if you are looking for a five star, restaurant quality, Alfredo this is the perfect recipe!!

It is a bit too dry if you use deli cheese instead of a processed cheese and it does not warm up well!

I was looking for a quick and easy baked mac and cheese recipe.  This was both.  I did increase the serving size to 6.  That being said, I found it to be so salty that I couldn't eat it.  Perhaps if the butter had been unsalted the dish would have been saved.

I found this recipe a few years ago, and even though it states for 1, I turn it into a huge pan (that is normally eaten all at once!). I cook as much pasta as will fill my dish and then make the make 5x the sauce!  The flavors are nice, and I always add extra cheese to the sauce. Perfect for a stay at home snuggle day or warm up kinda meal on a cold winters night!

Didn't have cheddar, used monterey jack.  Interesting twist.  Also, it made enough for TWO servings for me.

I quadrupled the recipe and made it in two 700ml casserole dishes because my brother and I nearly always eat two servings. I didn't have hot sauce so I added a can of drained Rotel tomato and green chilis. Plus that adds some color and nutrition to the dish. Other than the Rotel, I kept everything the same. It was pretty good, but I definitely will add more cheese next time. It didn't have close to the amount that I prefer. I also think that I will bake the mac for half the time first then add the cheese topping. It got a little too toasted to be all melty and good.

I've been on allrecipes for a year now and haven't given a review until now. This recipe is absolutely delicious! I made a couple changes however, I didn't add hot sauce or mustard powder and I only had cheddar jack cheese so that's what I used. This is an easy recipe! My family had seconds and even thirds of it!

I doubled the recipe to make 2.  Quick and easy recipe.  It was a bit starchy...If I made it again I would make less of the flour mixture and add a mixture of cheeses.  Italian bread crumbs on top added much needed flavor.

I make this somewhat regularly for myself as up until now - no one else would eat Mac and cheese!! I find that it comes together quickly and tastes great!  I now make this for myself and my daughter (there is MORE THAN ENOUGH SAUCE) I cook 1 cup of pasta and it's great!  Because I share with my 1 year old I often add in some frozen peas so that she's getting a veggie.  If you're cooking for picky kids I expect you could hide all sorts of different veggies in the cheese sauce. Works out great! Highly recommend this recipe!

This Mac n Cheese has always been my go-to-receipe. Why because as much as it says recipe for one, I always make it a recipe for three. I love to use three cheeses. First time I made it I used cheddar cheese, Monterey jack cheese and mozzarella cheese. This time I used cheddar cheese, gouda cheese and pecorino romano cheese. I use less salt, because the romano cheese is salty. As I did not have hot sauce I used dry cayenne pepper in the liquid mix, about a pinch(you can always add more). Will certainly make it again for Thanksgiving 2015. 
Who knows which tri-cheese combination will I use next. Stay tuned!

I've made this 3 times already. I play around with the spices a little because I never have everything on hand, but the basic ratios are perfect. This is the best mac and cheese, for real. I broil mine at the end to crisp up the breadcrumbs.

My niece (14) made this for a recent family dinner. She is just learning to cook and therefore followed the recipe to the letter, only scaling up to make 8 servings. While it was not my favorite mac & cheese ever, it was good. The mustard, Worcestershire, and hot sauce combine to add an interesting depth of flavor. It was cheesy, creamy, and not too soupy as others have mentioned. Once you pull it out of the oven, allow it to set up for for at least 5 minutes. To those who found this grainy, try making the roux (butter and flour) first and let cook 2-3 minutes before adding the milk and spices. This will cook the flour taste away and should result in a nice creamy sauce. How anyone can say a box is better than this is beyond me. And "doctoring" with velveeta? Gross!! That's not even real cheese. Go for "real" ingredients! The 'chef' was pleased with her results, and there were no leftovers. Thanks for the recipe!

Very Very Good!! Hubby is out of town tonight. Came across this while getting my shopping list together. I tripled it, added just a bit more cheese. Turned out very creamy. I was a bit worried when I put it in the oven it looked soupy. Almost perfect. I think I would prefer it with a sharp chedder. Three serving is perfect for 2. Good enough to eat leftover.

My husband loved "Hamburger Helper". So, I edited this recipe to make it for him.  I didn't use Worcestershire sauce, dry mustard, or onion powder.  Instead, I substituted 3 T. chili powder and 1/4 C. chopped onions.  I stirred the sauce and macaroni into 1 lb. browned ground beef.  No baking.  My husband liked it more than his old favorite.  I love regular mac and cheese.  I plan to make it again "as is" for myself.

I love this recipe! I've tried doubling the recipe and it works just as well. You can definitely add twice as much macaroni and still have plenty of sauce.

This was a pretty good mac & cheese, but a little salty for my taste. Next time I'll add only half the salt. I will also add about another cup of cheese as it wasn't quite cheesy enough as written.

Fantastic recipe!!!  I omitted the worcestor and added extra cheese (about 1 cup).  I also added a few slices of cooked bacon and half a cup of broccoli and cauliflower and my whole family just loves it!

Perfect recipe, only I made enough for the whole family. It has just enough cheeses flavor for the kids but enough of other flavors for the adults to like it to.

Brilliant! I did skip the breadcrumbs, husband request, and felt like I didn't lose anything. Loved all the extra flavor from the sauces. Also used Gouda, I think, instead of cheddar, and mozzarella and it still melted just fine.

Good sauce, I used dehydrated onion flakes because I didn't have powder and it turned out good. I cooked an extra 1/2 cup of pasta and there was still plenty of sauce.

I adjusted the recipe to six portions 1st time out.  Such a great recipe.  Though there are many ingredients, it was really easy right out of the cabinet type ingredients.  
One tip - for those making enough for leftovers - is add a couple tablespoons of milk to the top before baking. 
Had to make it again in the 1st week it was so yummy.
Oh, one other thing, for teenagers or very active folk just double the portion size.

I was craving mac and cheese all day and this was amazing!!!  I did make a few changes because I didn't have a few of the ingredients.  I added a dash of garlic, paprika and onions omitting the onion powder & Worcestershire (because I didn't have it) the hot sauce and pepper.  Will def make this again and again!

Absolutely to die for! Made 8 servings and used fresh white cheddar cheese. Cut the butter in 1/2 and for some reason when mac & cheese was mixed sauce was really runny. So I just added more flour & it was perfect! Gotta try this recipe :)

I'm so happy I found this recipe!  I don't always use breadcrumbs or bake in the oven like the recipe says, because I get impatient while I'm making it. The cheese sauce is pretty delish, but you may want to experiment with the seasonings a bit to suit your own preference.

Excellent recipe! I had my doubts at first because so many mac and cheese recipes taste so bland. The garlic and hot sauce really helped this. I mixed in some half cooked brocolli and added in a tiny bit more garlic and a dash of brown suger and my kids and I loved this! They only complained about the crust because it got hard and I over baked it.

I was looking for ways to use left over chicken and had a craving for mac and cheese and though what if I just combined them both together. It came out fantastic! Super easy and super yummy! Next time however I was thinking about adding broccoli and crumbled bacon to it. I changed the serving size to "4" and used a 8x8 baking dish and had plenty of left overs! :^d

This recipe is amazing! I have had homemade Mac & Cheese that friends have made in the past and have always been disappointed because it turns out dry and greasy and half the time is made with a bottle of alfredo sauce!  I tried this recipe and was extremely impressed.  The cheese sauce is so creamy, I honestly didn't realize you could make such a creamy sauce without processed cheese.  It is also really nice to have a recipe written for a singe serving!  Just a note - based on sauces I've made in the past I didn't add quite as much flour as the recipe called for.

Great recipe!  Tastes so so so much better than the boxed stuff.  Just a thought... I cooked 4 servings in individual serving cups instead of one dish.  If cooking as individual servings make sure and fill the dish half full with the cheese juice so the macaroni will cook.

I liked the creaminess, not sure if I liked the dry mustard in it. I used shell pasta (7 or 8 tbs dry) and fat free milk. I didnt need to bake this. just popped it in the oven to melt the cheese. dish Also added some ham and forgot the crumbs. Makes a very filling lunch.

Oh my goodness. I am glad I was alone the night I made this because I was licking the bowl. I had some shells left over from another recipe and was looking for a good way to get rid of them. The ONLY thing is there is too much sauce and not enough noodle, so the recipe should be tweaked. I ended up doing 8 tbsp raw shells instead of the 3 suggested. But with 8 tbsp noodles and the rest of ingredients as is, it is PERFECT. So delicious!!! For gluten free: do gluten free noodles, substitute flour for GF Bisquick and leave out breadcrumbs all together.

I tried this and after another poster wrote that it was too soupy, I decreased the milk.  DO NOT DO THIS!  It was not overly soupy at all.  I had to add more milk and ended up using the same amount that the recipe called for.  I only gave it a four star rating because it really could use more cheese, BUT I often add more cheese to recipes because we love it.  Other than that, it was really good.

I didn't make little dishes but just one large dish instead. I also didn't have onion powder and used Lipton Onion soup mix instead. I used about half the packet, not the whole packet. VERY GOOD!!!!!!! I will try not to eat the whole dish before my husband gets home.

This was my first time making homemade mac and cheese.  I will probably decrease the onion powder next time.  Also, I made this for my entire family, multiplying it by six.  I actually doubled the amount of macaroni called for and it was still very creamy.

First time reviewing. I made this without the onion powder and instead of cheddar I used a 50/50 mix of mozzarella and cheddar. Overall great meal.

This is, quite honestly, the best macaroni and cheese that I have ever made. I actually burned my tongue trying to salvage every last particle of the delicious sauce from the pan (worth it). I doubled the sauce and tripled the macaroni for my baking dish, and I added bacon bits to the top crust, which made it just that much more amazing (as bacon often does). Amazing as written! I recommend using a shallow baking dish just so the macaroni to crunchy, delicious top ratio is better.

This mac and Cheese was the best. My family enjoyed it and I will be making this again. As for those who ask why would a person only make a recipe for one person, it's probably because they are the only person in the house. However, that what the serviing calculator is for. You put in how many servings you want, and it will scale to yield a newamount and will still refer to the original recipe yield of one serving. So in the future, use this serving calculator to adjust to your family size.

this was a really good recipe is you want a quick lunch or dinner when your parents aren't home. It's also easy to improvise. I didn't have any cheddar cheese so I used Velveeta and it was good!

This was great!  I did add a bit more macaroni (maybe more like 5 tbs.) I love peas with my macaroni, so I added a few tablespoons of frozen peas, too.

I had increased the servings to 4 and my dish did not turn out like the picture at all. Mine was soupy and didn't have a cheesy taste. My 16 year didn't like it, even after I added more cheese and pasta. That worked for me, but I will not make this again. When I come up with a good recipe, I will publish it here.

excellent,  mixed it up with some different cheeses and baked a little longer but it was superb.  made 6 servings for 3 adults and a toddler, and there was not so much as a noodle left over.

I doubled it up since I was seriously craving mac and cheese...Omitted the hot sauce and added extra cheddar (used medium cheddar) to about 1 cup. I added the milk really slowly...I followed the rest of the instructions spot on. I cooked it in a loaf pan :) and let it sit for 10 minutes after getting out of the oven...I was hoping the sauce would settle a bit more because there really seemed to be a ton of sauce compared to the amount of macaroni...And it was quite yummy! One serving would have been fine if I wasn't super hungry. And the sauce ended up not being too much. A keeper recipe.

This recipe is amazing! It's almost identical to the one I got from Weight Watchers! A great comfort food! And I used skim milk and low fat cheese so I didn't feel so guilty!

Great recipe! My husband is a huge fan! He thinks its the best Mac and cheese he has ever had. And to top it all off, I am not a cook by any means.  This is a fast and easy recipe even for a newbie like me.  Enjoy!

AMAZING!  I am not a fan of hot sauce, so I left it out, and used Italian breadcrumbs.  Delicious and easy!

Used this recipe for Lobster Mac and Cheese.  Melted butter into a non-stick wok and then chopped up a whole lobster tail and sauted it first.  Then followed this recipe.  OMG!  You should try it!

I altered this slightly, just by leaving out the hot sauce and it also had no Worcestershire.  It was quite delicious, paired with some baked zucchini chips.

I love this recipe! I almost never review foods on here, but I had to for this. I added a bit of paprika in the sauce and on top of the breadcrumbs, and used half of a small onion instead of onion powder, but other than that I kept it the same. I quadrupled it and put them in individual ramekins, and they turned out perfect. So delicious! I will absolutely be making this again!

I thought this was really good! I used a heaping 1/4 cup of penne pasta - it makes for a more substantial mac, I find. I used garlic powder instead of onion powder, omitted the Worcestershire sauce (didn't have any) and used a small squirt of prepared mustard (no mustard powder). I also used more cheese than stated, because I like my mac cheesy! The sauce was really nice and creamy and it made the right amount for the pasta I used. I used panko breadcrumbs on top - next time I'll probably mix them with a little melted butter or oil. I really enjoyed it and can't wait to make it again!

This stuff is GREAT.  I'm a mac & cheese lover anyway, but this was so much better than I was expecting from this tiny bowl of macaroni.  My only regret was that I didn't leave it in the oven long enough to get a little crispy on top.  I made a double batch, intending to save some for lunch tomorrow... but I ate it all up. I will be making this many more times.

This is my husbands favorite version of mac and cheese that I've made. He thinks it tastes the most like his favorite cafeteria mac and cheese. I usually triple the recipe and omit the Worcestershire sauce and hot sauce and never do the bread crumb topping. I've also used different cheese for this and it always turns out great.

I used 5 TBSP of dry macaroni and could have used more, however it wouldn't had fit in my 1 cup baking dish.  Very creamy.  Would probably be just fine without the worcestershire sauce in case you don't have any, it just gives it another kick.  I used 2 Ritz Crackers crushed up for the topping and then enough cheese to cover it. I'm pretty sure it was more than what was called for.  To my taste buds its a 4, I personally prefer a little less creaminess, however for it being so dang easy and because I knew it was going to be creamy ahead of time, it gets the extra star.

This was a pretty good recipe.  Very easy with only a few ingredients.  I'd skip the worsteshire though, that flavor just didn't do it for me but I think without it this would be a 5 star recipe.

I'm not a mac and cheese fan, but my husband and daughter love it.  This recipe was super simple and made a very creamy sauce.  I quadrupled the recipe, omitted the mustard and worchestshire, added seasoned ground turkey, crispy bacon bits and ritz crumbs before baking.  I also used 3 types of cheese: asiago, cottage cheese, and a mexican blend.  My husband said it was "so good".  Thanks!

I made this pretty close to exact recipe. I didn't have macaroni noodles though so I had to use penne. I also added about a tablespoon of mozzarella & a 1/2 tablespoon of parmesan because I was trying to use them up. It turned out quite well. I dont think I would change this recipe at all. I did however use medium cheddar & believe itd be best with sharp cheddar instead. Will make again!
