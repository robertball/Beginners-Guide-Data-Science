I have actually been making caramel apples this way for some time.  I sell them to people in my office around the holiday's!  On poster commented that they would skip the boiling water part.  I would recommend against this.  The reason for boiling the apples is to remove the wax from the skin and help the caramel stick to the apple better.  They only need to be dipped in the boiling water for a few seconds though, not left in.  I just roll mine through the water and remove them.  Although dipping them in chocolate might seem overwhelming to some people, be careful if you try to make them without coating them in something.  Despite the fact that the caramel hardens, it WILL stick to cellophane if it is not coated in something.  I don't sell plain ones because of this.  I recommend trying this recipe different ways.  I use mini M&M's or Reese's pieces, crushed oreos, nuts, sprinkles, etc.  They go over very well with everyone who has had them thus far!  The most popular are the ones I roll in nuts and then dip in chocolate though!

Time consuming but worth it! I didn't use the microwave for anythingin this recipe. Instead I did it the old fashioned way. Over a double boiler on the stove. I can control the temp of the candies that way. I also put the apples in the fridge for about 30 minutes in between each application of candy. This chilled the aplles so dipping wouldn't create a big blobby mess of caramel & chocolate. I bought white chocolate & melted it & added color into it instead of buying the colored stuff. I got lots & kudos for these apples!

Don't skip dipping the apples into boiling water, the caramel may not hold with wax on the apple. Try using milk chocolate chips and simply melt those. I personally love melting a few squares of Bakers white chocolate and adding a tablespoon or so of peanut butter to that and when melted drizzling it all over the apple. HIGHLY Recommended recipe, I made these several times within the last few days. I only get 2 large apples out of this recipe or 3 small ones, but I REALLY dip my apples into the chocolate for full and thick coverage.

I love the idea of chocolate and caramel, but this was too heavy. The chocolate masked the apple and caramel flavors. Maybe just drizzle the chocolate on for a little flavor in every bite. They are easy to make and lovely to look at. We gave a bunch as gifts to happy recipients. Make sure to select a good, tart apple that can stand up to this much sugar. And I would skip the boiling water part next time as it softened the skins so much that they started peeling off. Maybe that was my fault for leaving them in the water for a good ten seconds. This is a great idea and delicious.

I used Werther's (sp?) candies in place of the caramel, topped with semi-sweet chocolate, then lightly salted peanuts (to offset the sweet).  Good stuff!

These were gorgeous when they were finished. For some reason the amount of caramel did not cover the 5 apples very well and the amount of chocolate only covered 4 of them. Is there a trick to getting the perfect amount on the apples? and the boiling water bruised them. they were fine on the inside but it was an odd sight. next time ill just wash them well to get the wax off. I used white chocolate dyed orange for the drizzle on the outside and i liked that a lot. They looked great on my halloween table.

I used milk instead of water with the caramels and it tasted great! I used Planter's sweet and salty trail mix to cover the apples much easier than mixing assorted nuts and chocolates together. I think I'll make these apples for party favors for my daughter's b-day party in a couple of weeks.

Skipped the boiling part as well as using candy bars and opted just for chocolate chips, both white and milk chocolate. These were yummy!

I did this with chocolate chips. I think next time (and I will do this again) I will do about half the chocolate. They are good! We added nuts.

I've made these twice now.  The second time turned out better than the first.  Here's what I did.  I started with cold apples so it would harden the caramel faster and hold more.  Be sure to scrape the caramel off the bottom of the apple before setting it on the waxed paper otherwise there will be a big pool of caramel underneath the apple once it sets. Instead of dipping in the chocolate I drizzled it on with a spoon (omitted the shortening).  The first time I made them I dipped them but the chocolate was too warm and it started to make the caramel slide off.  It doesn't matter how neat you do it because once you put on the candy coating you won't really be able to see it.  I put them back in the fridge to harden then proceeded with the candy coating.  I omitted the shortening again but it wouldn't drizzle so I put it in a sandwich bag and cut a small piece off the corner and drizzled it on that way.  I bought thick lollipop sticks from Michael's (the small ones are too flimsy) and expandable treat bags.  Once I had them all assembled with a tag and curling ribbon they were beautiful.  Everyone at the baby shower I brought them too for favors couldn't believe I made them.  I was really worried about them melting after being out of the fridge but they survived in a 75 degree house for 4 hours and showed no sign of melting.

These are awesome and satisfied my craving for caramel-chocolate apples.  They look so professional.  I dipped mine in caramel, then some in crushed butterfingers and some in chopped snickers.  I let them set up in the fridge and then dipped them in chocolate.  Yum.  I, like others, used chocolate chips instead of baker's chocolate.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

Good recipe a ton of work. When I read other reviews saying the same thing I thought no way but yes it's a lot of work. I doubled the recipe and it made 12 beautiful apples. A word of advice let the caramel set on the apples in the fridge for an hour. I waited the 15 minuted that the recipe calls for and when I dipped the chocolate layer ALL of the chocolate ran off it was horrible. Once we let them sit in the fridge we were able to go back and re-dip them. Also cut the amount of shorting in half I really feel that's why I ran into trouble. Now that I know how these work I will be making them again but giving myself more time  and patience;-)

I love making these for people and watching their face when I give it to them. It really is gourmet looking and they can't believe I made it. This year for our Christmas Eve dinner, I used them for the name tags for the plates. (See picture). Everyone loved it and they got to take it home for a treat later.

These were a huge hit at a Halloween party I went to! They are not too messy or too sweet with both the caramel and the chocolate as other reviewers said. I make candy and goodies similar to this every Chritmas. A few suggestions: the apples DO need to be dipped (individually) in a LARGE pot of boiling water for about 5 seconds and then wiped dry and set aside to cool (a large pot because you don't want them sitting too close to the bottom or sides) , you don't need shortening if you buy good chocolate (if it gets too thick reheat it or add a little vegitable oil), and finally they do need to be dipped in chocolate or some other kind of coating (nuts, cookie crumbs, etc.) so that the caramel doesn't stick to the plastic wrap when you open them up to eat!

Every couple of yr I buy a 5# box of bulk caramel (only $23) from our local candy/cake store. Far easier for arthritic hands. Agree that if using apples from most stores, including organic, ARE coated with edible wax, so don't forget the boiling water dip---moments only. If able, purchase apples at a local ranch straight off the tree. These have no coating and are much smaller (tennis ball to fist size) than the lovely, showy ones sold at Saks and $$$$ stores. The upside is that peeeps can each have their own without feeling overwhelmed. Agree with refrig between coatings.  Fav caramel-melting vessel for med-sm apples is my 2cup Pyrex measuring cup. Find it easy to dip/roll the apples without burning my hands or melting way too much. There is always leftover caramel, so tis easy to reheat and pour/scrape into a container to re-use (using "clean" technique assumed....no fingers, contaminants, etc.) Have had caramel last 2+ yr. wrapped in a plastic bag in a cool spot in the house. Surprisingly, no ants nor other pests so far. Yum....making these and choc/caramel/smoked almond turtles this weekend.

I prefer to use decorator's chocolate because it's so easy to work with and no need for shortening. Also, instead of wasting money on wax paper that the caramel sticks to anyway, get a silicone baking liner. No need to spray it with anyting, the apples just don't stick to it. It's fabulous and reusable.

The most crucial step is the boiling of the apples before covering them with the caramel.  I used nuts, white chocolate, and regular chocolate on these and the result was to die for.

Really fun recipe that you can personalize to your liking!  Easy to make, too!  We did not use the chocolate layer.  Instead we dipped in caramel, rolled in a variety of toppings (crushed Snickers, crushed M&M's, chopped nuts, crushed Oreos, etc) and then drizzled semi sweet chocolate.  They were delicious and a huge success at our pumpkin carving party.  I would suggest either chilling the appled before putting on the caramel, or placing each apple in the fridge as soon as you apply the caramel.  This w

Followed this recipe for the caramel and the steps, but dipped some in melted pure white chocolate chips, rolled in chopped pecans, drizzled more white chocolate around the tops and sprinkled that with apple pie spice mixed with raw sugar. For the rest, we mixed peanut butter with semisweet chocolate chips to dip in, then rolled in candy coated sunflower seeds. The recipe made enough caramel coating to cover six apples that were on the small side. There was no need to mix shortening into semisweet chocolate to drizzle it, but the white chocolate was harder to drizzle. After it was melted, putting it into a small baggie and cutting a corner off made it easier to drizzle. Pitfalls: the caramel stuck to the greased wax paper. I will try someone else's suggestion and use my silpat next time. Even after boiling the wax off the apples, the caramel still slid down the apple and pooled at the bottom. Scrape as much caramel off the bottom of the apple as you can after dipping. After letting it set up in the fridge, the caramel was still pliable so I 'pulled' it back up the apple and patted it back in place. Dipping in the warm chocolate caused the caramel to start to fall again as well.

These were so much fun to make!  I made sure to have extra caramels & extra chocolate just in case.  It came in handy b/c of course I did mess up & needed to correct it.  I bought the caramels that came w/the wooden craft sticks (Kraft I think).  I used hersheys milk chocolate chips instead of candy bars.  I also used orange melting wafers & white almond bark to decorate with.  After I melted the white & orange, I put them in baggies and made a small snip in the corner and just applied it that way.  Whatever technique works though right.  Oh, they are beautiful and so, so much fun!  Thank you djnewlon!!!!  :)

I love caramel apples and so does my family.  This was the first time I made them.  Make sure you boil the apples to remove the wax that is on them or your caramel will slide off.

These were wonderful!  They now sell Caramel "bits" which makes life so much easier (not having to unwrap all the individual caramels!)  After dipping them in chocolate, I rolled them in crushed Oreo's.   Would make great gifts!  Loved them!

I made these for Halloween and they were insanely delicious.We couldn't keep our hands off of them.Layering chocolate over the caramel is the trick that makes them sooo tasty and I have to say they were pretty easy and fun to make.Every one of mine looked different,I put nuts on some,sprnkles on others......These are now a Halloween tradition!!

Great trick to dip apples in hot water first to remove wax!  Carmel stuck well.

I had never thought of putting apples in boiling water before, not even thinking about the wax that is put on them for preserving. Neat trick. I made few different recipe for apples when I made this batch. Bravo. It was fun. I don't remember having this much fun decorating apples in years. And it had been at least 20 years since I had done so....Now that I'm a mom with kids that like to do neat things...this was a delight. I added walnuts to this batch and totally went to the NINES on decorating them up. Thanks for the recipe. I totally had a blast.

Loved these. Try cutting in pieces to serve. YUM turtles chocolate meets sour apple. The CARAMEL SOLUTION!! Took wax off the apples rolling them through a quick boiling water bath.  I did the caramel in the double boiler (just until smooth but not too runny) dipped apples & wiped excess off bottoms and dipped quickly in COLD water (not above the "caramel line") then smoothed caramel with wet hands patted dry on tea towel then put in fridge for 20min  I had no problems with caramel coming off the apples. While I did the chocolate in the double boiler I made caramel strings just rolling/pulling excess caramel from pot. dipped cooled apples in dark chocolate rolled in chopped pecans placed caramel strings on apples and then drizzled with melted chocolate from a baggie with tip cut.

Oh, these are fun to make and turn out beautifully! For anyone else who might worry about it as I did: the caramel stage didn't look as smooth as I would have liked.  I was worried it would make the apple look bad in the end.  But once I melted (Nestle milk chocolate) chips with the shortening and dipped the apple in it, it looked great.  The chocolate went on much easier than the caramel.  I lightly coated it in sprinkles and it's really cute! I'm thinking about white chocolate with crushed peppermint for Christmas gifts.  :) Thanks for the recipe!

I made these for a fundraiser and they were one of the first things to go. I used extra caramels and melted milk chocolate wafers purchased at the bulk food store. My toppings ranged from sprinkles to coloured sugar, it depends on your target audience!

Great recipe that you can let your imagination run with. I like to use Dove chocolate and I don't add the shortening. I used two bags and piped it on as decoration. If I wanted to dip the apples into the chocolate to coat the entire thing, I would have needed four bags. Regardless, they are delicious. It is easiest to pipe the chocolate on if you hold the apple by the stick and turn it as you pipe it. I like Mis7ups pictures.

Easy and fun!  My apples were very waxed, so I had to dip them in the boiling water and rub them with towel to get it all off.  Carmel stuck well.  Refrigerated for about 30 minutes as I got all the toppings ready...crushed Oreos, candy corn, marshmallows, chopped peanuts, and M & M's.  After dipped in chocolate, everything to decorate was right there at hand.  Did both white and milk chocolate.  These are easy and fun to make!

The caramel was too hard. Not sure if it makes a difference what kind of caramels you use? I bought the bulk individually wrapped ones. They were so hard to bite into and sticky it spoiled the apples. Kind of a waste when you spend all that $ on the chocolate, apples crushed candy bars etc.. Maybe if you add butter when melting the caramels it would make a differnce. Don't think i will make them again, not worth the effort.

I tripled the recipe for my son's school and it really did only take one pkg of caramels per 5 apples. I used Kraft caramels b/c I think they taste better than other brands. I dropped the apples in boiling water for 3 seconds each to remove the wax coating, however in the future I do not think I will do this since it turned the peel a slightly off, darkish color.  Thankfully, it did not effect the inside of the apple at all. After chilling the apples, I dipped them in the caramel, then chilled them again for 1 hour. I then melted milk chocolate chips in the microwave according to pkg directions with a little shortening for the chocolate dip, then chilled once more for another hour. I also melted white chocolate chips the same way as the milk chocolate, added some Wilton candy coloring gel, and drizzled over the apples, adding some festive sprinkles. Overall the recipe is a little time consuming with the steps. However, these looked first class and tasted divine! Very rich though - great for sharing. I will be making these again!

I love this recipe but It is very time consuming and I tried to add mini m&m' s but that didn't work out at all they just slid right off. Also If you use a microwave the caramel hardens way to fast you really need to use a double boiler.

We got apples from a nearby orchard and picked them ourselves(NO WAX). Washed them carefully, dried them, followed the recipe and coated them with crushed pretzels (our favorite sweet and salty treat) and then drizzled some with milk chocolate and some with white chocolate over the pretzels. Any way you slice it, these are loads of fun and absolutely delicious. Thank you for sharing a really great recipe!

These were yummy! I was able to make 5 medium sized apples. I did not skip the boiling of the apples. I did melt chocolate chips instead of a candy bar and that worked well. And for my third flavor I melted some peanut butter chips and added a little bit of that after the chocolate hardened. Those were my husbands favorite. I also made some with salted peanuts. I just stuck the peanuts on before the chocolate hardened. Those were my favorite. The tart apple, sweet caramel and chocolate, and salty peanuts--Heaven!

Yum!! You can't beat this classic (and the added chocolate - DELICIOUS!!)...I just melted some milk chocolate chips w/ a bit of oil in the microwave and didn't dip the apples in it - just spooned some on here and there.

This was a little time consuming but so worth it. I made mine with pecans with white choclate drizzled over it. I would definately recommend chilling the apples well after the caramel I did for 20 min and it wasn't long enough the caramel wanted to slip off when I dipped it into the chocolate. I pay $7.00 each for one of thses at a   local chocolate store that sells them. Now I can make myself and taste just as good.

This was a great idea... it inspired me to play a little.... I covered the apples with caramel then rolled the warm apples in mini chocolate chips then set it on wax paper covered w' mini marshmallows (so it doesn't stick to the paper)  looks really cool with the marshmallows on top.  My 4 year old and I had a wonderful time making these!!

These area awesome!  I love caramel apples and have been looking for the perfect recipe!  My 11 year old daughter and I made them for her teachers for Halloween and we dipped pretzel rods for her class.  We followed recipe exactly except we rolled in different candies and didn't use the shortening in the chocolate.  Very time consuming but definately worth it!

These were really tasty!  I wish I had some tips on making these though.  I'm sure there's a better way than the way I did it.  Messy!

I just used some dark chocolate sweet baking squares I had leftover for the top w/o shortening, then topped with finely crushed pecans.  Worked well and was yummy!

Great recipe.. A lot easier than I thought. I found it hard to cover the apples in caramel.. and there was a lot of excess caramel that formed at the bottom. I cut the excess off so that I could re-melt and pour over top. 

My first time tempering chocolate - a little difficult considering I did not add enough at first but live and learn. The apples still came out very well!

Excellent.  I made them extra-special by using a Hershey's bar that had crisp (like a Crunch bar).  Will make these again.

Wonderful, got rave reviews.  I rolled in mini M&M's and mini colored chocolate chips, however these don't look very neat.  Next time I am going to roll in skor bits or salted crushed peanuts.

I am giving 5 stars because I did this differently!  I found caramel apple wraps in the store and used those but used the other steps to make the apples...chocolate and than sprinkles as they were for a pre-k class...they looked so good it was hard not to try one!

I really didn't like this recipe.  The caramel I used got used up so quickly.  I like chocolate and caramel together, by the chocolate wasn't creamy enough.  I kept adding time onto the microwave to melt it more, but the choclate just burned.  That was a waste of my time, apples (I didn't want to, but I spent $1 on each apple.  I like organic, but I wanted them to be big.), caramel, CHOCOLATE :(, and water (It took me 2 hours to scrub my bowls clean!!!!!)  I rarely give 1 and 2 stars, but I think this recipe really deserved it.  :) sorry

I almost wish I could give these 4 1/2 stars because they were alot of work and were soo soo very messy. The end product turned out great and so it was well worth the efford. I couldnt find any orange candy melts and so I used melted white chocolate with a little bit of orange food coloring. I Would differently make again but definately not til next year!

Great recipe.  I am sure I will use it again and again.  Very, very sweet but yummy!  I was only able to get 6 "small" apples with the caramel and I used a 12 oz bag of milk chocolate chips.  I did drop the apples in hot water for only a second and you could see the wax so I would recommend this step.  The only problem I had was dipping it in the chocolate.  With the apples being chilled after the caramel step the chocolate wanted to set up too fast.  I had to use a knife to help spread it.  But after drizzling it with orange colored white chocolate you couldn't see any flaws.  They looked awesome!!

This recipe does take a lot longer than 50 min. I allowed the Carmel to dry for an hour before using chocolate. I was disappointed in the amount of Carmel that did slide off the apples. The chocolate looked beautiful at first and then it too did slide in several places. I used Kraft Carmel's, Ghirardelli milk chocolate, pecans and marshmallows. I also did a few in dark chocolate. I was only able to cover 4 large Granny Smith apples with this recipe. These were made for Teacher Appreciation Week.

Great recipe.  I took the advice of another reviewer and only left the apples in the boiling water for a few seconds.  They turned out great following the directions.  My kids helped with these and it was a nice project for them!

This recipe was so easy to follow, and me and my husband enjoyed making them!  I used chocolate and white chocolate chips, and used a variety of toppings.  They are delicious and will hopefully be a hit at class tomorrow night.  =)

This was a great recipe!  It is kind of difficult to get the caramel to stick very well to the apples however.  It seems like most of it comes off onto the paper.  The chocolate was great, and I sprinkled ground up butterfingers all over them-absolutely delicious!

Very good recipe! I love it and am making them for Christmas gifts. Our first time we made some big mistakes. We forgot to put PAM on the wax paper, and tried to dip in toppings. My recommendation is to 1. MAKE SURE TO BOIL APPLES! 2. use a smaller saucepan, this make caramel go higher on the apple. There is a big learning curve, so don't expect them to be perfect the first time.  Watching video's on technique helps.

I made these caramel apples almost exactly as described. The only things I did differently was use the caramel bits (no unwrapping), used chocolate chips to melt, and used 2 TBs of milk instead of water. I made these as favors for my sons birthday party. They were a huge hit and so so pretty!

I just made these first time making caramel apples. It was so easy and did not take long. I do bake often. So, if you do not then you may think this takes long or too many steps. I've learned if you don't skimp on buying good caramel and good chocolate it makes things delicious and easier. I did give this a four star only because the caramel did droop to the bottom a bit. So, my nuts were at the bottom. Thank you for a great recipe my family and I will use from now on.
