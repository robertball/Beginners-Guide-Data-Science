It's good...but where I come from, we just call it "Tzetziki sauce," and it's a staple of greek cuisine.  But "Duke"...whatever...this is a decent recipe that goes great on warm folded flatbread with plenty of fresh romaine or endives and some lamb strips or cubed peppered chicken.  Much too subtle for US children, weaned on hot dogs and processed cheese, but anybody who appreciates a subtle treat will take "Duke" over ranch dressing any day of the week.

Excellent! I love the subtle flavor in this sauce. I served it with crudites and toasted pita to guests. It was a big hit.  Also makes a nice side to a spicy curry.

My 'meat and potatoes' boyfriend actually loves this.  I cut the cukes into rounds and serve it as a side dish to middle eastern chicken kabobs and hummus with veggies.

I made this dip for a family gathering. I grated the cumcumber, then blotted the pieces with a paper towel to get rid of excess moisture.  This prevented the yogurt from becoming runny.

Everyone enjoyed it including the 5-year-old.

Thanks Jolie - a pleasant healthy change from bottled Ranch Dressing.

If you combine the D from Dill and "Cuke" from Cucumber and you get "Duke."  Maybe that's where the name came from?

I love this dip.  I used non-fat yogurt and made it for a party to serve with raw veggies and it was perfect.  After the party I tossed the left over veggies into the dip for lunch.  I'll make it again -- light and tastey.

This is very good. However, instead of using just regular plain Yogurt, use Greek Style plain Yogurt, it is much creamier and thicker than regular American Plain Yogurt.

VERY GOOD!  I've made this recipe twice and plan to make it a staple whenever we have excess cucumbers from our garden.  I cut the recipe in half and it still yielded 2-3 cups of dip.  I added twice the amount of dill and 5 dashes of hot sauce (still a very cool refreshing dip- it just added more flavor).  Do not use a blender or food processor or the constency will be too soupy.  Chop and mix by hand and the dip will be perfect for veggies, chips, or spreading. My favorite way to eat Duke is rolled up inside flour tortillas!  YUM!

A great dip to use up cukes, dill and chives from the garden. I added some garlic salt and freshly cracked pepper. This was good served with rye chips. I also think radishes would be good too. Taste the skin of your cukes before you chop them up and add them to the dip. My 1st one was bitter so I had to throw out the entire batch and start over with a younger cuke with sweeter skin. If I would have tested it I could have just peeled the cuke and saved the first batch. Just a heads up! I also seeded it

This was just too bland for our taste.  I cut the recipe in half and still had a ton left.  Think I will stick with my mixture of yogurt, cucumber, and dry Zesty Italian dressing mix.

I just made this to go along with the Venison Gyros from this site also. The sauce is really light and has a very pleasant delicate flavor. I love it. I'm sure it will be perfect with the gyros. Thank you for this!

This was OK as is but it needed something else and the consistency wasn't quite working for me.  We added garlic and blended it to make it smoother.

This is great. It ISN'T called Tsatziki sauce, because tsatziki is thicker. I think it IS called "Duke" because "cuke" is short for cucumber and "D" stands for dill. Both of these ingredients stand out in this recipe. Great for dunking carrots into.

Very tasty and light. Makes a whole pile of dip however. Either make it for a large party or cut the recipe in half!

6-15-11: Pretty good.  Served as a roll-up with flat bread.  Use a lot of dill weed.

Because I was low on yogurt, I used half fat free plain yogurt and half fat free sour cream. I did add some chopped garlic and a little oregano. Nice, fresh tasting dip. NOTE: I did scoop out the seeds from my cukes before chopping them fine.

Odd to give this five stars when I did not like it personally, but since everyone else did and it was a group of fifteen or so, and because it went together in practically a split second, I have to applaud. My personal preference is to not have dill, and, of course, that is the very thing everyone else was so thrilled by.

My family really liked this recipe. I substituted cooking onion for the green onions, because we all like stronger onion. I also added a little lemon. It gave it a nice zing. Thanks for the recipe.

I thought it was very good but I had to start replacing the yogurt with sour cream.  Hubby hates yogurt.  Great on gyros and goes good with grape leaves.
