I used Becel reduced fat margarine, and this pie crust turned out really awful!  Maybe try another brand?  It was very easy to roll out, and baked nicely.  The end result was very brittle, and overly salty.  Not that I expected a miracle "skinny" piecrust...  Good thing I had a back-up Tenderflake in the freezer.

I didn't soften the margarine, and it worked perfectly fine. I guess the ratio of margarine to flour makes up for that . ..sort of.  When I tried as directed, I got very little crust--it was more like floured margarine.  I added another 1/2 to 3/4 cup flour to make it workable.  Then, it came together easily.  Although I probably could have refrigerated it, I chose to just roll it out . . .which it was a tad difficult to work with, but not impossible.  With added flour, this seemed to work out okay but I'm still puzzled by the recipe.  It is a tad salty--if you use salted margarine, you probably don't need the salt at all.  This worked for what I wanted it for, and I figured this recipe deserved another chance, but I had to make enough changes that I think it wouldn't really work as written.  Thanks for the recipe!

The crust was more like a paste when uncooked. I had to add a bunch of extra flour to make it not liquidey.. After baking it just crumbled.. Didn't work out well at all.. I'll stick with a regular pie crust recipe next time. Thanks anyways..

Not enough flour. Makes for a really small crust.
