I think this is a great base recipe. I sauted 3 cloves of minced garlic in avocado oil then added the spinach. Make sure you drain the spinach well after cooking. I also added a full cup of cheese and finely diced red pepper for color.  Delicious!

I was looking for a change from my usual Greek yogurt recipes so I perused Allrecipes and found this recipe. I had the ingredients and was excited to see that I’d also be able to use spinach in a new way. It’s my first time of making spinach dip and this recipe was super easy. I halved the recipe because it’s just me. I used orange bell pepper, baby cucumber and radishes as my dippers. I enjoyed the extra juicy flavor the bell pepper added, and loaded a big scoop on the radish. The combination of flavors is delicious and that it’s healthy means I’ll definitely make it again.

I  haven't a clue how anyone could rate this higher than a one.  If I could have rated it .5 I would have.  I tried adding double the seasonings and letting it refrigerate overnight to improve the flavor but all to no avail.  I do not reccommend this recipe.

Easy! I needed to add a LOT of garlic salt and twice as much Parmesan cheese. We added a sprinkle of red pepper flakes for heat too. After that, it was delicious!

It was very bland. I only gave it points because it was quick and healthy.  Won't make it again.

I baked this and I liked it much better warm. I double down the Parmesan because it was really sweet. I did 11 ounces of spinach and didn't drain it. Dipped veggies to keep it healthy. The second time I made I loved even more!

Like the fresh spinach, still need to drain water out. I used fresh garlic and didn't have enough yogurt so substituted 1 cup with cream cheese. No need to cook, it's awesome!  Thanks for a great palate!
