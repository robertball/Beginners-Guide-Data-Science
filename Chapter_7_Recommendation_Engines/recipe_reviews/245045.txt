I found this recipe while looking for a slow-cooker idea for short ribs, and bought the ingredients without noticing it called for braising. Here's my crockpot version. Browned the meat in a dutch oven, in batches. Transferred them to the crockpot, then did onions as in the original recipe. Added 2 tsp minced garlic for the last minute, then browned the flour enough to get rid of flour taste. Deglazed the dutch oven with about half the broth, then put it all in the crockpot, with the remaining ingredients. About 1 hour on high, followed by 4 hours or so on low. When all was done, I removed the meat and vegetables to a large bowl, de-fatted the liquid, then thickened it with a corn starch slurry on the stove top. Served the whole thing over extra-wide egg noodles. Wife said it's a definite keeper.

Wow chef John does it again! This dish was amazing!!!  My husband was sckeptical of the beets and the red mixture but he loved it as well.  I served this over large egg noodles and omitted the sour cream at the end. Next time I will try it with a splash of vinegar to help balance the sweetness but it's still amazing as is. This is a must try! Just be warned that the beets will stain everything so be careful where you choose to cut and peel. Thanks chef John!

I was very pleased with the results of this recipe.  I made this using my Hot Pot pressure cooker.  I did not add the vegetables until the meat had cooked for 15 minutes and allowed to depressurize on its own.  I then added the vegetables, cooked them for 5 minutes and manually reduced the pressure.

Another keeper. We like beets a lot so it was a nice addition to the short ribs. I followed the recipe but added the cumin and other spices suggested by others. I served the stew over egg noodles.

This is amazing! The slight sweetness of the beets just compliments the beef. I used stewing beef and beef stock, and added a celery root. Of course the veggies was all out of my garden. Otherwise nothing else added. I have made this 3 times already. Just gets better every time. Chef John knows his stuff!

Good as a starting off point for a recipe. The seasoning wasn't borscht enough for me though. I ended up using 2 tbl of dill, 1 tsp of cumin, 2 tsp of caraway seeds, 3 cloves of garlic and 2 tsp of thyme. Also, always preferred parsnips over carrots so swapped those as well.

Warm & comforting. We made this for Valentine's dinner & served with crusty buttered bread & a nice French red table wine!
Leftovers froze very well & we will make again for game night with friends.

I ended up making this with brisket because the butcher was out of short ribs. Doubled the time in the oven to get to "fork tender". It was fantastic! Will definitely try it again with short ribs another time.

Really good stuff! Truthfully, I probably won't make it often; I was looking for a way to use up some beets left in my case box. On the other hand, I have so much bracing liquid left even after reduction, that it is going to Bebe tarter for what I expect to be a lovely soup. Thanks, Chef John!
