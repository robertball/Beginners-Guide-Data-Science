Before this recipe my yorkshires were always like hockey pucks because we're living at a high altitude. I mix up the batter in a blender several hours before dinner and just give it a whir every now and then- Thanks so much!!

I think this is a tasty recipe.  I have made these a couple times with mixed results.  The problem was me, not the recipe, though.  I didn't realize you cannot open the oven door to peek!  No matter how much you want to see if your Yorkshire pudding is rising, you must never open the door!  It causes your pudding to fall. I have made these as a pudding and also in muffin tins as popovers.  I enjoyed the popovers more.

I am a little disappointed with this recipe.  I always read the reviews before I try a recipe and the reviews rated this one high.  I followed the recipe and used the shortening...there was no flavor.  I have been making these puddings for years and thought I would try a recipe instead of using 'club house' mix..Don't get me wrong, it came out great it just had no flavor.  I will try again using oil or lard, if this doesn't work, I will stick to the package mix.

This did puff up nicely even in the mile high city. My Father was English and always used bacon drippings. Also added some salt 2tbs salt. Turned out wonderful!

This was great... I used olive oil and butter instead and it worked out well.

This is very close to how my Mom makes it, although she uses just a little bit more shortening (approx. 5 Tbsp.).  In my opinion, the more 'butter', the better the taste.  This was a very simple recipe to make, and I enjoyed the outcome.

This was an easy recipe.  I used individual muffin tins.  They puffed and browned nicely.  However, they were tasteless.  They definitely need salt or be smothered in a flavourful gravy.  I will try this recipe again sometime, but will experiment with it a bit.

I used drippings from the roast instead of shortening. It puffed up and browned nicely and tasted good. I do prefer the individual puddings in the muffin tin, but this is a lot less effort and WAY less mess on the tins and oven. I will make this one again.

I tried this recipe for the first time with my roast beef meal  and we found it to be very bland.  Definitely needs some salt.  The pudding rose really high, but fell by the time it cooled enough to cut.  Next time I will try adding some salt and reduce the heat after 15 minutes and continue to bake for another 15 min at 325 which is what I read on some of the other reviews.

My first Yorkshire Pudding - worked pretty well - I substituted Soy milk for milk, and used butter.  I do prefer the individual cups, but this was easy.  Sank a bit in the middle.

Absolutely brilliant yorkshire puddings.  I live in Colorado and have been so frustrated by previous recipe attempts.  I used lard in individual pan and these came out fantastic.  I recommend you make early and put mix in fridge for an hour then whisk quickly before pouring.  Thanks for making our Sunday !
