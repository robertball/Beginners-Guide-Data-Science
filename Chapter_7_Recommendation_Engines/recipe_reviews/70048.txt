It was good!  I slightly modified the recipe based on the other review though.  I used 2.5 cups of all purpose flour instead of just 2 (the dough seemed really wet and sticky to work with only putting in 2 cups). and instead of 3tsp of white sugar, I changed that to 3 tbsp.  I also had to knead for more than 15 minutes... but that was probably because I am terrible at kneading.  I kneaded for about half an hour until I got that really smooth and light dough.  I filled my buns with some finely chopped steak, flavored with thick teriyaki sauce, soy sauce, salt and pepper, and some sweet chilli sauce.  It was a HUGE hit for supper last night.

We were not a fan of these, they had no flavour besides the overwhelming taste of yeast.

I was looking for a recipe I could use to imitate the steamed buns you find in the freezer aisle of Asian grocery stores, and these far surpassed my expectations! I filled them with homemade red bean paste by rolling out a 2-inch square of the dough, putting 2-3 teaspoons of filling in the center, and twisting the top to close. It made the best red bean buns I have ever tasted. The dough was a bit sticky at first, so I had to use a lot of flour to knead it, but it was still less trouble than the average loaf of bread. Make sure you place a square of parchment paper under each bun before placing it in the steamer, and serve with the parchment so you can hold the buns without your hands getting sticky. They still taste good if reheated in the microwave, but eat immediately for the best taste. I can't wait to try these with a beef filling!

The buns came out nicely, although they tasted a little yeasty. The dough was so sticky I ended up adding probably another cup of flour just trying to knead it.

Tried but the buns' surface kinda wrinkly, probably steamed too long.  15 mins of steaming should be good (my fillings are cooked).   Use another quarter to half cup of flour for kneading as the original dough was a bit sticky.  By the way I think it should be baking powder, NOT baking soda!  I used baking powder. Overall buns ok but not as soft and fluffy :)
