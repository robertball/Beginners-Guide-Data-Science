Happy to be the first to review and to give it five stars! I’m always on the lookout for healthy after school snacks and this one caught my eye because of ‘cranberry ‘ in the title. We love cranberry anything! I made this recipe exactly as written, including the neff which is something I’d not cooked with before. My local store doesn’t carry it, so I ordered a bag online and had it shipped to me. The recipe lists the ingredients in ounces rather than cups, so I used a clear measuring cup that has ounce markings on one side. I chopped up the ingredients individually in my Vitamix and dumped them into a large bowl where I then mixed everything together with a rubber spatula. Melting the peanut butter before mixing it into the other ingredients really helped with holding everything together. I oiled my hands before rolling the bite-sized balls so the mixture wouldn’t stick. I didn’t have any trouble with the mixture being too crumbly. It held together beautifully. It does take some time to roll all of the balls. I probably got 80 or so from it. The kids all commented on how tasty the snack was as they popped several into their mouths  before I even had a chance to freeze them! A delicious and healthy after school snack is a win-win in my book. Thank you for sharing it with us! (I tried one after putting them in the freezer and they taste even better cold! I just stacked them up in a large square Tupperware-type container and didn’t have a problem with them sticking together.)
