I made this without the bread crumbs and it was delicious!! Used it with Weight Watchers Freestyle and it’s very low points.

The one change I would make if I were to make this again would be to use about half of the recommended amount of bread crumbs.  I also used a bit more olive oil which helped the zucchini cook nicely.  Unfortunately the amount of breading overwhelmed.

Added a few minutes under the broiler to brown and crisp the zucchini. Loved it! Will make again.

It turns out very well.  Will definitely do it again.
I had an eggplant and decided to add it and see the results. Outstanding result. Next time I will add mushrooms.
After all, this is the joy of c ooking, trying different ways to make a dish.

This is good. As others have said way too much bread crumbs. I had even cut back on how much  I used.

Last minute choice for a side dish. I did not have time to shop and had to use what was available. Very easy recipe and delicious! I will definitely be making this again!

Loved it!  I cut back on the bread crumbs a bit, and upped the parmesan a bit.  "Restaurant Quality" was the family verdict.

Delicious comfort food and easy to make! I used Trader Joe's croutons and crushed them down into chunky bread crumbs. They are very savory and helped add flavor. I would make this again!

Turned out great. I used half the amount of breadcrumbs as recommended by another user and it was quite enough. I added some carrots to the mix. A very tasty veggie dish that I intend to make again. Note that depending on the cheese you may need to adjust the salt.

This was a good use of the zucchini in the garden.  I followed other reviewers suggestion of using less  bread crumbs.   I don't care for mushy zucchini so I recommend baking it for much less time.

This was delicious. I didn’t add breadcrumbs because my daughter is cutting down on carbohydrates, but I don’t think it needed it. Next time I will dice fresh tomatoes and sprinkle over it before I serve it.  And top generously with Parmis on cheese.

I added bell peppers to this recipe, it didn't come out roasted like I would think, the zucchini and peppers were soft and mushy, so it was more like a saute than a roast. Still the flavor was good.

My Grandma made a similar dish .  I reduced the bread crumbs and gave a squeeze of 1/2 a lemon over the zucchini before cooking.

Made this for a family party and it was a hit! I added chicken sausage to the dish (pre-cooked), which added great flavor , but would still be awesome without - highly recommend!
