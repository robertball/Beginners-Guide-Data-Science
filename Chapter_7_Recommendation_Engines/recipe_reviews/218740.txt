As written, this recipe is very tasty and gets 4-1/2 stars in my book! The only thing that I wasn't that happy about was that the sauce seemed kind of watery - but it was still good.  The second time I made this, I added 1/4 cup heavy cream and fresh mushrooms - this bumped it up that 1/2 star to make it 5 stars!  This will definately be a keeper

Absolutely delicious! I didn't want to spend a lot of money for shrimp, so I used chicken instead. Turned out great!

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe, and it was really quite simple to make!  It wasn't a WOW in the flavor department, but it was fresh, simple and tasty.  We also loved the spicy zip of the red pepper flakes (we LOVE spicy food).  I followed the recipe to the letter (all except I used regular diced tomatoes instead of those with green chiles, and I used 3/4 of a lb of shrimp instead of a full pound because it was really expensive at my local seafood store).

The fresh parsley is a great touch and the leftovers are almost as good as the first go-round.

I will add this to my recipe box and make it again.  Although next time, I might add another 1/2 cup of diced tomatoes, and will try the ones with the green chiles as suggested.  Thanks Rachel!

I loved this recipe! The only thing I didn't like was how thin the sauce was so i drained the juices off and added a little traditional pasta sauce. It was perfect besides that.

Excellent. A perfect weeknight meal when you are low on groceries. I had some fresh basil so added that in addition to the parsley. I also used half butter and olive oil because I like the flavor of the two together. If you like this try the Pasta with Tuna Sauce recipe also on this site. Both are quite good.

This was very tasty. I didn't have penne, so I used whole wheat pasta and it was delicious. A little spicy for the kids, but very tasty. I will definitely make it again.

I used fresh tomatoes chopped up.  Love this!  So delicious and yes it does yield a thin sauce, but that was okay with us, yum!!

This recipe is a good starter recipe but needs additional ingredients to make it great. I added about three tablespoons of butter for taste, and added Thyme and about 4 oz of cream cheese at the end. I used spaghetti and mixed it all together rather than putting the sauce on the pasta. I will be doing this again!

I thought this was delicious, however this does not feed 4.  Feeding 4 would mean each person would only get a cup of penne pasta.  I used 12 oz of pasta and doubled the ingredients, then added black olives and mushrooms.  I kept everything else the same!  It as super good! Thank you for sharing Rachel!

My husband put this together tonight, exactly as written, adding the heavy cream and mushrooms as suggested in the reviews. It was outstanding! Just us two, so there was lots of leftovers. Yum!

I had to make a few minor adjustments for ingredients on hand                                                                                                                                                     like italian seasoning and lemon pepper seasoning, but it still tasted really good. I gave 4 stars because it wouldn't be accurate to 5 star a recipe that I messed with, although the base ingredients are very solid.

I really LOVED this recipe! I didn't follow the recipe to a "T" b/c i read the reviews so i made it my own. I add tomato sauce just to make the sauce a little thicker. I will do this AGAIN for sure

I love this recipe. My husband also really likes it. My son and parents thought this was too spicy. I guess it could be spicy to those who do not like spicy food, but I love spicy food and thought it was delicious, especially topped with parmesan cheese.

Pretty good recipe, not amazing. I used a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes which may have added an odd flavor. I also added sliced black olives and used whole grain pasta. Cheese on top is a must :)
