These are absolutely delicious. Chocolatey, creamy, fudgey.  The only thing I did different was using semi-sweet chocolate chips because that's what I had and adding 4 packets of Splenda. I have a large number of wooden skewers so I made them in 6 paper cups, covered them with foil and stuck a skewer in the center (I cut them into three pieces). Now that summer is here, I will be making these quite often. Thank you so much for such a great recipe!!

Amazing! So creamy! Added a little bit of kosher salt on the top after it was done freezing. I love this!
