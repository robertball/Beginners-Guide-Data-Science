This is a great simple inexpensive recipe. I have been a vegetarian since 1998, and have gotten lax over the years about the ingredient "natural flavors" which is found in the Cream of Mush. Soup. Honestly, it can be many things and often times, not a meat product, other than that, the soup is completely veg. friendly. Also, I diced about a half cup of fresh shrooms (I don't care for canned) and a whole small onion. I used less salt and subtituted a salt-free all purpose seasoning. I used one package of Morning Star veggie crumbles which is technically TVP with more flavor. I used low sodium/low fat soup. Delicious!!!

Very good!  My husband and I are vegetarians and we enjoyed this dish a lot.  It is good served on top of spaetze (German dumpling noodles).

How disappointing to search for a vegetarian stroganoff recipe and and find it contains cream of mushroom soup- not vegetarian at all.

I'd have loved to have given this a better rating but there was a lot of work involved in making this a true vegetarian meal... I am vegan and went a step beyond that as well but that has nothing to do with the rating. The cream of mushroom soup is a no go for vegetarian so I had to make homemade soup first. At that point there is so much in this recipe that was not called out, that it was no longer THIS recipe. It was a good start though and what I came up with as a result is a keeper. Thank you!

A good start recipe. I am vegetarian and like to adapt recipes that are safe to eat.  Try with Quorn products for a much better finish. 1 bag Quorn tenders needs only one can of cream of mushroom soup and one can of water. I added additional garlic powder and onion powder, freshly cracked black pepper, and one half vegetable bullion cube.  The soup isn't vegan, but most are vegetarian.  Check labels.  A good, filling dinner. 3+  I'll tweek next time to get to 4 :-)

I'm a new vegetarian so getting used to the texture and smell of soy protien has been difficult, which is not the fault of the recipe. So, I would say if you like meat substitute, this recipe is pretty good.

This was easy, fast and tasty.  I put it over potato wedges and it reminded me of poutine, without all the fat!

Yum -- I thought this was great!! Fast, super easy, and tasted close to the beef stroganoff I used to make in my pre-vegetarian days. True, it's not the most beautiful thing laid out on a plate, but it's quite tasty. Even my grumbling teenager, who was determined to think it was gross, ate a big bowl. Thanks!

Argh, really? I was excited about this, especially with the good reviews. Mine ended up being nearly flavorless TVP and Oats, with mushrooms hiding in the midst. Dry (even after I added more water and then milk) and to me, stroganoff is creamy. the TVP just soaked up the cream of mushroom. If I try again I'll SERIOUSLY cut back TVP and ratchet up the creamy and the flavor. Only 2 stars (instead of 1) because this was my first attempt at this recipe (kept checking to be sure I hadn't missed something).

Very tasty but too salty for me.  Next time I will cut the seasoned salt and add some equivalent low sodium seasoning.  I wish I had looked at the nutrition information first.  I typically don't eat anything that has more than 240 mg of sodium per serving and this has 1541.  I had it on riced cauliflower to cut the calories of the meal as compared to the typical noodles used for Stroganoff.

Great recipe. Thank you! For those who don't eat cream of mushroom condensed soup (like me), you can VERY easily make your own with milk or soy milk. Used it in this recipe and was fabulous. I did add some carrots, parsley, oregano (sautee the veges and then simmer in about a half cup of broth or water )and made my own TVP crumbles ahead of time.

Super easy to make and it's delicious on its own or over noodles.  It has become a staple in our house.  I am a vegetarian but my husband is not, but he loves this too!

Maybe 4 stars...  It was a good inspiration for the recipe I made of it. I used a whole onion, a bunch of fresh sliced mushrooms, sauteed them in olive oil (and a bit of butter later), and then added 2 cans of cream of mushroom, some garlic, seasoning salt, salt, pepper, and a bit of chicken flavoring for some zip. I added water to the consistency that I wanted, which was less than half of what was recommended. No oats. Not vegetarian, but a good stroganof minus the chunks of meat. :) Great over pasta.

Although it is easy to make, it's very bland and quite unappetizing to look at. I won't be making this again.
