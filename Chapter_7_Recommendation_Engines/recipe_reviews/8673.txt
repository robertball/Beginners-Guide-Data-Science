This recipe works better if you do the following: use cut-up corn tortillas rather than chips, cube the cooked chicken and blend the ro-tel tomatoes with the soups prior to cooking, use a mexican cheese blend, and if you use a whole onion, make it a small one! (especially if serving to kids). Layering the ingredients (including the chips/tortillas) ensures that no part of the casserole will be dry. This is a very easy, tasty recipe that all my friends ask me for.

This was a great recipe. I would be a wonderful dish to take to a gathering. I used boiled chicken breasts that I shredded in my food processor. Then layered the chips and mixed ALL the other ingredients together(saving 1/2 the cheese). Poured it over the chips, and then added the remaining cheese. It was great and seemed to really stick together better than layering the chicken would have. Will make this again and again.

I just made this for my family for dinner.  My kids are picky eaters and its hard to find a recipe they all like and my husband likes. Everyone loved it!  Usually they barely eat one serving of chicken for dinner.  But they all loved it and everyone asked for seconds and cleaned their plates.  A big hit!! I used most of a 14 oz can of tomatoes w/chiles instead of 10 oz because I misread the recipe but it was delicious--not too spicy-just right.  For those that like it spicier they can also add a little more diced tomatoes and chiles or salsa at the table.  We will have this often!  Also, I just quickly boiled some (1 1/2 - 2 lbs) chicken breast strips for this recipe in a bit of chicken broth and water-only took 15 minutes or so.

My family liked this more than I did, but I still would have given it a four.  After making several times, I have made the following changes:
Omitted cream of mushroom soup in favor of lite sour cream mixed with cheddar cheese dip (Moore's brand mild flavor) -- this mixture made about a cup.  I also sauteed my onions with a bit of olive oil, and added three cloves of garlic, a tsp of garlic powder, a tsp of dried cilantro, 1/2 tsp of chile powder, and 1/2 tsp of dried oregano.  I also used a colby/jack blend of cheese.  I made more layers, starting with chips, then sauce, then chicken, then cheese, and then repeated all.  It filled my huge glass casserole dish.  The only problem I had with this recipe is that 20 minutes on 350 (I raised the temp by 50) didn't heat it all the way through.  If I hadn't decided to precook the onions, they would still have been cold and crunchy.  
My husband loved this, and so did my kids.  They loved that the chips on the bottom were still crunchy.  I liked that too, it added some interest.  I thought it was very good and I will make it again, but next time I think I'll substitute some monterey jack queso dip for one can of the soup.  I recommend adding your favorite spices to this dish -- I'm not sure if it would have been as good without them.
UPDATE:  I've found that reheating this in the oven keeps the chicken from tasting funny after refrigeration.  Also, the next time I made it, I used jarred white queso and jalapeno dip and it was a marve

This was so good !!!! i used torn-up flour tortillas rather than chips and added a can of mexicorn too - and used much more cheese. I used boiled chicken breasts, and baked it for about 45 minutes. The kids loved it too. This is definitely a keeper!! thanks susan

I have been looking for an easy, no-fuss King Ranch Chicken recipe and I have finally found it.  Like some of the past reviewers suggested, instead of cream of mushroom soup, I use cream of celery, which I think gave it a better flavor and I only used a total of 2 cups of cheese so as to not overwhelm the dish with cheese..  Also, I started out with lightly sauteing the chopped onions with a little bit of garlic in olive oil.  Then combined the soups and the Rotel and brought it to a boil.  Then added the chopped chicken (which I used a store bought rotisserie chicken to save time) and 1 cup of the shredded cheese. Also, I only layered the tortilla chips on the bottom then spread the entire chicken mixture on top.  Then, baked it for 30 minutes at 350 degrees.  Then I topped it with the remaining cheese and baked for another 5 minutes.  I think I might try it with a layer of cooked spaghetti on the bottom next time instead of chips for a little variety.

I made this dish for the first time when we had guests over, and it was wonderful!!!  One of our guests said it was better than her King Ranch Chicken recipe and wanted a copy!  I added a little crushed garlic to the recipe to give it a little more kick.  Will definitely make it again!

 - I know I have already reviewed this, but I wanted to note that I made it again last night, and I did not have cream of mushroom soup, so I just used cream of celery.  It turned out great!  I also added in the extra garlic, dash of lemon juice, dash of lime juice, an extra tomato, and a sprinkle of dried cilantro!  YUM!

Man oh man is this ever good!!  We sub american cheese for the cheddar, and add a thin layer of crushed tortilla chips on the bottom of the pan.  We do add pimentos and black olives to ours, but there taste is not missed if you decided to leave them out.  Another great comfort food recipe.  Thanks Susan.

Good base recipe. I alter mine to be a little more Mexican. First you MUST cook the onions first in olive oil before adding them to your mixture or they will NOT be cooked. I use a whole rotisserie chicken, use 1 can cream of chicken and one can of Campbells fiest nacho cheese soup. I substitue salsa for Rotel and also add 1/2 package of Taco Seasoning Mix. I also add a can of corn. I mix everything together all at once and layer it over the chips. I reserve some of the shredded cheese for the top at the end, too. This makes a really tasty mexican dish!

yummy recipe! I used rotel diced tomatoes and pre-baked a few chicken breasts instead of the whole cut-up chicken.  I also used the bite size Tostitos and used cream of chicken w/mushrooms.  The husband liked it, I loved it, my picky son picked and would'nt touch the chicken. My daughter liked it. Will make again! thanks!

Marilyn,  This recipe was concocted at the King Ranch in Texas. Thus it became known as King Ranch Chicken.  There are many versions circulating but one important factor. ALWAYS USE CORN TORTILLAS. Flour becomes more soggy and mushy. In Texas we used cream of chicken soup mixed with Rotel tomatoes and always tore the tortillas up.  It is best refrigerated overnight before baking as the flavors meld better that way.

We really enjoyed this and will, for sure, make again. Per many reviews I used homemade tortillas and just tore them apart and layered on bottom of the pan and again on the top of the Rotel/soup mix over the chicken. I omitted the onion per personal taste and used BLSL chicken breast diced up and cooked in some olive oil/garlic before assembling.  I don't tihnk the cooking temp/time was right for my oven so next time will bake at 350 for at least 20 mintues.  We served w/ rice and will put this in our dinner rotation when I need something quick, easy and tasty.

The trick to a great King Ranch Chicken Casserole is to warm the soups, tomatoes, and onion in a large saucepan just until heated through.  Then layer the ingredients as directed.  Excellent!

This is a very simple recipe to make low fat -- use boneless, skinless chicken breasts, baked tortilla chips (easy to make your own), low fat soups, and Kraft Singles Fat Free Sharp Cheddar cheese (the only FF cheese that I've found that tastes and cooks like full fat cheese).

I have been making this recipe since the 1960's and is a favorite of my family.  It will be much tastier if you use the Flavored Tortilla Chips - I use Lays Baked  Cheese Doritoes - 1 can Rotel Original Diced Tomatoes and Green Chilies w/ 3 cans Campbells 98% Fat Free Chicken Soup; Chick Breasts.  Spray casserole w/ Pam; Layer crushed Doritoes; Shredded Chick Breast; diced sweet onion; 4 oz can diced Green Chilies;Warm the Chick Soup and Rotels together; can delute slightly with milk to a gravy consistancy -  and pour the mixture over the top Sprinkle w/ Mixed Mexican Cheeses.  Cook in oven 325 degrees till bubbly & cheese melted.

This is an easy and great recipe.  To cut down on calories, I used chicken breasts, low fat soups, and added about 3 oz. of 2% velveeta to soup mixture and heated.  I topped it off with 1/2 cup of 2% mexican blend grated cheese.  My picky family loved it.

This is stick-to-your-ribs down home comfort food, and for what it is, it's perfect. My wife and I both rate this recipe five stars. That noted, the recipe isn't clear on step two, the layering of chips. My wife recommended I cover the bottom of the dish with chips, and then after adding the soup mixture, to add another layer of chips--not quite as thick as the first layer. Then, cover the chips with the rest of the soup mixture. It turned out absolutely splendid. I used the kind of cheese I had on hand, pepper jack and hot style Rotel tomatoes because we like a little bit of a kick. We loved this recipe. I also sprayed the dish with cooking spray so it wouldn't stick. Thanks for the great recipe idea!

Put the chips on the bottom then chicken mixture on top. Baked for 15 minutes at 350 then added the rest of the cheese and baked another 5 minutes Turned out amazing!! Family loved!

I knew the lady and the famiy who served this at their ranch. My Mother-in Law was a great friend of Mamie Kleberg , the matriarch of the King Ranch.  I remember as a young bride, going to have lunch on the ranch and visiting the stables and seeing their great race horses, to say nothing of the Sants Gertrudis cattle they developed. This recipe is pretty true to the original and a good tex-mex meal that kids love!

This is a fantastic recipe, but don't discount it as a dip!  Mix all of the "liquid" ingredients together and heat or keep warm in a crockpot and serve with tortilla chips to dip.  Way better than Buffalo Chicken Dip!

This is a great dish! My family has been making it for years, but we add a 1/4-1/2 cup broth, 1/2tsp comino, 1/2tsp pepper,and 1/2tsp garlic powder to the soup and ro-tel mixture. Mix in the corn tortilla wedges(I use my pizza cutter to cut up 8-10 tortillas), and 2 cups cheese. Poor into a lightly greased dish and add remaining cheese. Serve with a small spoonful of sour cream on top. It's delicious! And five stars with the changes....

I made this recipe and it was really easy and yummy. I would recommend cooking it a higher temp. (350 F at least). I'm also thinking of adding corn and hot sauce to it the next time I make it.

Thought I would try something new since I had extra time on my hands, but I only had fritos. I crunch up the fritos and layered them on the bottom of the pan. My son just loved this recipe and has been begging me to make it again. Not sure I would make it with fritos again. He suggested that I make it with cheetos next time, LOL. Awesome recipe!

This was good.  I had never had anything like it before, but it was very quick and easy to throw together.  Both my husband and I liked it right out of the oven when the chips were crispy.  The next day they were soggy, but we used doritos, so they did add alot of flavor.

I LOVE this recipe! I take all the ingredients and mix them together except the tortillas and cheese.  Then I layer the tortillas first, the mixture, then the cheese. I add another layer of tortillas, mixture, and cheese.  It's kind of like a "King Ranch-Lasagna".  Sometimes I use hot Rotel.  Soooo yummy! Thank you!!!

Edible, but barely. Way too much "cream of" ingrediant. Tastes greasy, salty and processed. Sorry, but we were all disappointed and threw it out.

I have made this recipe for years. The recipe I have used is similar to this recipe except it calls for a can of Rotel, sour cream, cream of celery soup instead of cream of mushroom and velveeta cheese. Your recipe sounds good too. Will be making it soon.

I used low fat soups and low fat cheese to cut down on some of the fat and calories. The chicken I used was out of the fridge so I don't know if that is why I needed to cook longer than stated. I did find that the chips were a bit salty, next time I would use tortillas as others suggested. All around very tasty and I would make again :)

Added one red, yellow, and orange bell pepper and a couple jalapenos chopped up and mixed in the soup mixture. Onions are definitely better sauteed. Sauteed them with the peppers. Delicious new recipe. So glad I tried and added new things!

Not sure what happened with this.  The main picture looks so good I had to try it out.  I did everything to a T, and was really hoping it was going to be delicious as I was taking it to my neighbors house.  I had to throw away over half of this dish because no one would eat it.

Made this last night for Monday Night Football gathering. It was  a big hit! I used a rotisserie chicken, fresh tomatoes, roasted cubanelle, anheim, and jalapeno peppers.  I added about 1/2 C chicken stock, and seasoned it up with paprika, garlic powder, cumin, pepper, and adobe blend.  I put it together right before I put it in the oven so the tortilla chips still had some crunch to them when it was done cooking. Next time I think I'll make more of the sauce - add more stock, and maybe another can of soup.  It would probably also be good served with a lime wedge and fresh cilantro.

It was great and everybody wants it again.  One of my kids wished it had been spicier so next time I'll use the Hot rotel instead of Original Rotel.  We are always trying to cut calories and fat so like many suggested I used Corn tortillas, 98% fat free Cream of Celery and Cream of Chicken.  We used 2% Kraft Shredded cheese and added a small can of sliced black olives to soup mix.  Sauteed onions with some garlic in coconut oil before adding to soup mix.  Baked at 350 for 20 minutes  Cant wait to make it again

Excellent recipe!  I took some of the other reviewers advice and instead of the cream of mushroom soup, I added a 1/2 cup of light sour cream and 1/2 cup of queso cheese dip.  I sauteed the onions with some garlic, oregano, chili powder and olive oil.  There are a LOT of chips.  I would have cut back on the chips a bit.  This would also be great over rice.

I would have given this 3 1/2 but it wasn't an option. I waited until I made it a second time to rate it. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and it was just ok, nothing special. This time, I spiced up the chicken a bit while boiling then diced it in small chunks. I also used cream of celery soup instead of cream of mushroom. I used a 14.5 oz can of rotel (my husband would have been happier with more for more spice). I mixed the onion ( 1/2 onion was plenty), soups, rotel and chicken together. Spread a little of this mixture on the bottom of the pan before layering chips. Then I made two of each layers....chips, mixture, cheese, chips, mixture, cheese...It turned out much better this time. I will mention, the last time I made it as the recipe states, I had a lot of real hard spots (the chips that didnt absorb any moisture), so that is why I layered it more this time.

Great recipe! I have been trying to bulk up my recipe repertoire and this is definitely going in the keeper pile. I made a couple of changes - omitted onions as my husband is not a fan (I love them! so if he is not eating, I will definitely put them in). Added some red and yellow peppers, and used a chunky salsa instead of the can of diced tomatoes. I didn't put the chips on the bottom, but topped with corn chips when it came out of the oven. I might add a bit more spice next time.  Served over a bed of rice. Great winter meal.

I used leftover turkey to make this recipe.  I was so extremely tired of eating turkey, this recipe disguised it really well.  It was more like a nacho recipe vs. a casserole and I think I would have preferred nachos for dinner.  The baking time and temps are off.  I baked as directed and the casserole was not very warm and the onions were still raw.  Even after cooking at a higher temp and longer period of time, I had to use the broiler to melt the cheese and get everything hot and bubbly but the onions were still raw.  This recipe needs improvement IMO.  Start by omitting the onions and layering the chips and wet mixture twice.

I followed another reviewer's advice and bought a pack of corn tortiilas. I fried some of them in a little oil. I sauteed the onion along with about six minced galrlic cloves. I then added sour cream, the soups, cooked chicken, and Rotel. The following went into the baking dish in this order: layer of tortillas, half the soup mixture, cheese, layer of tortillas, rest of soup mixture, cheese. Delicious!

I have made this for years, but I do it in the crock pot and I use FLOUR tortillas, torn in strips.  Cook and bone the chicken, put everything in the crock pot (also 1 C. sour cream).  The tortilla's kinda turn into dumplings when it's done and it's DELICIOUS.  Doesn't look so pretty, but it's so good!

I grew up in Kingsville, TX, home of the King Ranch so this recipe is near and dear to me.  This particular one is pretty good although my personal variation is to use a can of Hatch Green Chillie sauce with pork rather than a can of Rotel (or canned diced tomatoes with green chillies).  No matter what you choose to use, this is a tasty recipe, especially on a cold night!  (And it freezes very well.)

Great recipe you can tweek to you liking.  I added a bell pepper that I sauteed with the onion, and also used corn tortillas rather than chips.  So good with sour cream or sliced avocados!

I gave this recipe 4 instead of 5 stars for one reason.  I had to alter the recipe slightly.  IMHO, there wasn't enough wet ingredients to make the dish sing!  So I did what others suggested and added a can of Queso cheese.  Man, that made all the difference.  I also did not include the onions (I simply forgot to add them) and I crushed the chips.  My husband's words on this was, "This is good.  This is really good.  I really like this. This one is a definite keeper."  Just a suggestion, the leftovers make awesome chicken burritos!

We enjoyed this recipe.  I usually make the traditional King Ranch recipe with corn tortillas but they always get mushy.  This had a nice texture with the crunch of the tortilla chips.  I increased the cooking temperature because at 300 degrees, the casserole was just 'warm'.  I didn't have cream of chicken soup so I used 1/2 cup of sour cream along with the cream of mushroom soup.  I also added some ground cumin and fresh garlic to the sauce mix.  I think kids will love this!

Any time my husband loves something called "casserole", I give a 5-star rating! The only changes I made were to use a can of green chiles and a little jar of pimentos in place of the diced tomatoes & chiles, and I added a little chicken broth. I did have to kick the oven up to 350, and it took longer than 20 minutes. Loved the addition of tortilla chips--very good recipe!

Really good recipe. I have made it often and it always comes out great. I usually make it with whatever meat I have. I have used ground beef, ground chicken, ground turkey  all with great success. I sometimes sub the Cream of Mushroom for Cream of Celery soup. Just depends on what I have around. One change that I do make that I think helps is I usually make up the casserole this night before. This allows the soups to soak in and gets the chips softer. If you like a crisp texture on the casserole I would not

I made a few changes. I used 3 corn tortillas instead of the tortilla chips and I mixed my soups together with half of the mexican cheese blend and also added 1 can of enchilada sause along with the tomato and green chiles. Then I sprinkled some original fritos chips on top before adding the cheese. Came out very very good!

We ate this growing up, so I'm so happy to find this recipe. This is something my mom always made for her bridge club, and we got to eat the leftovers. We always made it using corn tortillas, but I like it even better with the crushed tortilla chips. 

The only changes I made were to saute the onion in a little butter and add some oregano, garlic powder, and fresh cracked pepper, and at the end, I turned on the broiler to get the cheese brown and bubbly. We just used two chopped up rotisserie chickens to make it easier on ourselves, and I think that gives it a little more flavor. We top ours with lettuce, tomato, avocado, and light sour cream and serve it with rice and corn. Thanks for reviving a great dish from my childhood.

This was really good, we all liked it. I made it according to the recipe, no changes.  It's quick & easy, always something I appreciate!  My DH just didn't care for the chips on the bottom. Next time I might try torn tortilla wraps instead as someone else had mentioned.

I was short on time so used a rotisserie chicken, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  It was a huge hit.  My son even had "thirds".  I'll be making this again soon!  Easy and DELISH.

This was great! Next time I'll drain the can of tomatoes and peppers and cook it a little hotter / little longer so it's not so runny.

I'll also add more chips to the bottom to make it a thicker layer. 

I used roasted chicken breast from the grocery store deli. They cut off a big piece and I cut / tore it into chunks. 

I also served white rice and black beans with this to make it go a little farther.

Really good.  Quick & easy.  I cup up the chicken breasts into chunks, then boiled until done.  Used cream of celery in place of the cream of mushroom.  Used Mexican 4 cheese blend.  Great way to use up all those extra tortilla chips!

I've been using a different version of this for years, but decided to try this one. MUCH better and a bunch easier to prepare. The only thing I would recommend is increasing the cook time or temp as mine wasn't terribly hot. I followed the recipe exactly and added a little cilantro for presentation and for another dimension of flavor. I served it with the Mexican Rice recipe, also from this site.
BRAVO!!!

Great base recipe although I did make some changes. After reading some of the other reviews, I added 1 cup of chicken broth to the soup mixture, used a can of Mexican Rotel which gave it a tiny spicy kick, and seasoned the mixture with cumin, onion powder (I didn't use chopped onion), garlic powder, and pepper.  I did not follow the layering directions, by accident, and subsequently only used about half the tortilla chips the recipe called for. I layered chips, cubed rotisserie chicken, soup mixture and only used 2 cups of Mexican blend cheese.   After 30 mins in the oven, the cheese wasn't fully melted so I turned the temp up to 350 for another 10 mins. That did the trick and it was delicious. My father-in-law who is not a fan of chicken had seconds.

Loved it!  Could find tomatoes with green chili's, but did find some tomatoes with hot red pepper spice, and used that.  Turned out VERY tasty!    Only thing I might do different, and this is just personal preference, is to not put the tortillas on the bottom, but instead put a layer of them in middle and near the top.  THis time I put a layer at the bottom and a layer in the middle, and the ones on the bottom got all soft (obviously), while the middle layer was still a bit crunchy, and I preferred that crunch.  Either way, they were very tasty!  Thanks for the recipe.

Made this for dinner tonight and it was simple to make and delicious.  Used the meat from a roasted deli chicken and squeezed some lime juice and sprinkled some cumin, garlic and chipotle seasoning blend into the chicken pieces.  We also added a tablespoon of sour cream into the soup mixture and threw in some fresh cilantro.  The lime juice really added zip to the chicken and the extra spices and herbs kept it from being bland.  Well worth a try!!

This was very easy and delicious.  To save time, I used a roasted chicken from the grocery store.  I also did as some other viewers and lined casserole dish with flour tortilla strips instead of chips.  Also, I saute'd the onions before adding them to the mix, used sour cream instead of the cream of mushroom & fresh cilantro.  It was great!  There are so many ways to change this up.

With my tweeks this dish was tasty & quite simple to make! Here's what I did & I hope others try it & enjoy it too! In a deep dish lasagna pan, I sprayed it lightly with pam. Poured entire 1 lb bag of white tortilla chips. Cut 2 lbs boneless chkn breast into tiny cubes & cooked in a Tbsp of oil & 1/2 tsp Cumin. Drain juice & keep chkn in pan over med heat. Add 2 cans Cream/Chkn Soup, 1 can Cream/Mushrm soup, 1 can Ro*Tel diced tomatoes w/grn chilies & 1/2 tsp Cumin. Mix til warm & well blended then pour over chips. Lightly stir to coat chips. Then sprinkle with 8oz bag of Mexican mix shredded cheese & 8oz bag of Sharp Cheddar shredded cheese. Bake uncovered at 350 for about 25 minutes or when you see the chips begin to brown but don't let the cheese burn. Serve with a dap of Sour Cream & ENJOY! The consistency is that of a casserole & not nachos like some people seem to think! Very filling & tasty. The Cumin adds just the right amount of flavor.

I love this!! It's sort of a cross between chicken enchiladas and the traditional Mexican nachos that my family has grown up with.  The tortilla chips make it so much easier and faster to put together.  I usually don't have that much time to cut up tortillas by hand. And the more cheese, the yummier!!

This was really easy to make and tasty.  I used a few of the suggestions made by others: corn tortillas vs. chips, made layers and everything was moist, sauteed the onions with garlic, fresh cilantro, oregano and chili powder... it tasted like chicken enchiladas.

This was a big hit with both me and my hubby! I followed the recipe, only differences were I used a store-bought Rotisserie Chicken and a can of Rotel instead of plain tomatoes and green peppers. I also sauted the chopped onion with a few minced garlic cloves in olive oil before adding them to the soups. This ensured they weren't still "crunchy" since the casserole only bakes for 25 mins. I baked it at 325. Definitely a repeater!

My best friend emailed me this recipe after she had made it.  I always read the reviews and found all of them very helpful.  I cooked the onions before adding the chicken, and added Mrs. Dash smoked chipolte spices to the chicken to give it more "southwest" flavor. (That was hard to find since I live in Alaska!! :) )  I also added a mixture of cheddar, jalapeno jack, and Monterey jack cheeses!!  I tried cooking it at 300 for 20 minutes, but it wasn't even warm.  I upped the temp to 375 and cooked for an additional 20 minutes.  My husband kept telling me "Dang!  That dinner was good!  You need to make that more often!"  Thanks so much for the recipe!!

This recipe is really good and super easy.  I took the advice of a few other reviewers and mixed all the ingredients together and then cooked it.  I also used cream of celery instead of cream of mushroom.  Just because I like it better.  The chips worked great, I liked that idea because I usually have tortilla chips around the house and not corn tortillas.  I also added a little veleveeta instead of all the cheddar.  The only thing I'll change is next time I'll leave out the onions.  The kids really liked it.  It will become a new family favorite.

One of my all-time favorites, and so easy to make.  I love all the onions!  I sprinkled a little Cilantro on top for color, otherwise, I made it by the book.  Great recipe!

Made the recipe as stated other then I added crushed  tortilla chips to the top of the casserole. My  tortilla chips in the casserole got a bit soggy. I liked this casserole but the rest of the family didn't.

I have been making King Ranch chicken forever. I saw this recipe and tried it with the tortilla chips but I really prefer using corn tortillas instead. But overall it was good and very easy to make.

Great recipe!!   To make this even faster and easier I picked up a grocery rotisserie chicken already cooked.  This made the preparation time quicker and I think even better than boiled or canned chicken.  (Do people really like BOILED chicken?!)

This was a very easy and tasty recipe.  I used the Extra Hot diced tomatoes so mine was very hot.  Next time I will use the original or mild.  Also added sour cream just before serving - yummy!

Love the different tastes, it's quick and easy to make and my kids like it, but the corn tortillas become a little rough and hard to eat.  It may work better with tortilla chips.  I'll try that next time!

I used corn tortillas instead of chips.  I mixed the soups and tomatoes together with the chicken and layered the mixture with the tortillas.  I left out the onion.  I think this could have more flavor, so I'm going to check out some of the other recipes.

Very disappointing.  Too many chips, too much onion, not enough soup mix, too much cheese.  300 degrees for 20 minutes barely heated the center of the casserole. I thought the chips would make a nice moist layer on the bottom like corn tortillas, but it ended up being more like nachos.  Try a different KRC recipe.

I halved the recipe to use up the leftover pressure cooked chicken.  Used 1 can low fat cream of chicken soup and the "hot" RoTel tomatoes with green chile peppers.  Next time I make this, I will keep the chips separate so they don't get soggy for any left overs.  Topped mine with fat free sour cream.  Delish!

Very good. Everyone loved it. Next time I'll use flour tortilla shells instead of chips and cut the amount of onions and make them very small because they tend to stay very raw. Other than that, it was great.

Pretty good flavor. It was pretty soggy, which I didn't like!

This is very good for what it is.  I layered it as suggested in the recipe and had a little trouble with some of the tortillas at the bottom staying dry and crunchy.  A highly processed meal, but tasty.

Excellent, better as a dip.  Don't bake with chips.  Just make it according to directions, and eat it as a dip.  Would be great for football game foods.

This recipe would have gotten 5 stars if there was 'flavor' added to the dish.  I think that cooked as listed on the recipe the dish would lack any type of flavor.  I boiled my chicken with cajun seasoning, onions, and pepper.  I added a can of ROTEL tomatoes instead of the can of diced tomatoes.   I added 1 cup of the broth from the boiled chicken to the soup mixture too.  The soup mixture was also seasoned with garlic powder, cumin, and seasoning salt.  I also used WHITE CORN Tortillas instead of chips. The kids LOVED the dish cooked liked this.  It wasn't spicy!

My suggestions to improve this would be: cook at a higher temp, maybe 350 for a longer amount of time. Maybe 30 minutes instead of 20.  We thought it was luke-warm and definitely could have been hotter.  I boiled the chicken, but next time I'm going to pan fry it with seasonings to make the chicken more flavorful.  This dish tasted great though.  I will make this again for sure.

This recipoe was just ok for us.  I used cream of celery instead of mushroom based on another re view. Maybe that was the problem.  I still had to top my serving with salsa, lettuce and sour cream in order to enjoy it. Probably wont make again. Sorry.

I gave this a 3 star rating because the recipe was rather bland and the chips were soggy. Also, when served it looked like something my cat threw up. Originally I had swapped out the cream of mushroom and replaced with sour cream - per another suggestion. I also could not add the onions or chili peppers as my roommate is allergic. However, neither of those ingredients should have altered the taste that much. I do hate throwing out food though, so when we re-heated the leftovers we added some Taco seasoning and a little extra cheese. What a difference! It was really good!!!  I will make this again, with these changes. I will not bake the chips with the casserole! It works MUCH better to serve it like chips and dip. Quite good actually. I will also definitely add the taco seasoning with the cream of chicken and sour cream.

We absolutely loved this recipe, with some changes made by reading some of the other reviews. I used chicken breast that I poached in a couple inches of water, adding the onion and garlic at the end to lightly sautee. I added 1/2 cup sour cream to this, and 1/2 cup med salsa, also 4 oz. can of green chili's. I mixed all the ingredients except the cheese in a bowl, then shredded and added the chicken. I put all the cheese on top. SOOOOO good. Baked at 350, for 30-45 min. covered.

If you like a little "kick" then try this recipe using Spicy Nacho Doritos or Salsa Verda Doritos! Instead of tortilla chips.

This was a different casserole.  I liked it, but not my favorite.  I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes with green chilies.  And 1 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese and sharp cheddar cheese.  Very easy to make.

Comfort food at its finest!  My husband had a bad experience with this dish as a child and I nearly had to force the first bite down his throat.  Once he took that first bite, though, he couldn't stop.  My kids loved it too.  Anything with melted cheese is welcomed in my house!

Good way to use leftover chicken.  I wouldn't use an entire onion, however, as it is very over-powering.

My Aunt Betty gave me this recipe over 30 years ago and I named it, "Betty's Bird".  No tortillas or tortilla chips, you have to use Nacho Cheese Doritos as another reviewer stated.  The VERY BEST!!!

I used a 16 oz. jar of salsa in place of the tomatoes.  I added 1/2 tsp. each of onion powder, garlic salt, cumin, cayenne & chili powder.  This was a quick meal using chicken that I had already roasted and diced. I topped the casserole with sliced jalapenos before baking.   Served with sour cream, salsa and Franks Red Hot.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This was a really great recipe.  I guess the only thing I would suggest it to skip on layering the chips on the bottom of the dish.  I served it with the tortilla chips on the side and ate it as nachos in a way.  It very delicious and I would make it again.  Actually I plan to make it tonight. Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm

Too much onion!  Have been making this casserole for years but haven't in a while and tried this different recipe.  Still great but I won't use a whole onion next time, maybe 1/4.  Also, I use canned premium white chicken and still great but made even easier.

This was soooooo good!  The only thing I added that was different was the cream of mushroom soup (the store ONLY had cream of mushroom with roasted garlic).  I think this added a great touch!  Upon other reviewers suggestions, I will try flour tortillas, cut in strips next time.  Winner recipe for my family!!!

I give this recipe 5 starts for easiness due to I had frozen, cooked, diced turkey in the freezer.  All of the ingredients were in my pantry. We loved this recipe.  Can't wait to have leftovers for lunch tomorrow!!

I made this last night and my son ate two plates so it is a winner. I added corn and left out the onion. I think it would have been good with some pinto beans as well. I added a package of ranch seasoning and used corn chips for the base because I had left overs and then I used what was left of a rotisserie chicken that we had the night before so this was a good way to use up some leftovers.

I am sorry but we found this to lack much flavor at all.  I will try it again with the addition of some sort of seasoning such as taco or zesty ranch.

This was really good. I was impressed when my very picky 3-year old took one bite and said "YUM!" I substituted tortilla strips for the chips and spiced the soup mixture with garlic powder, chili powder and ground oregano. I also sautéed the onion with minced garlic and added to soup mixture. I started the layers with the strips, then chicken, soup mixture and cheese - I was able to do that twice. This will definitely get a place in our permanent rotation.

This is a great chicken casserole recipe. I did substitute sour cream for the mushroom soup & I thought the chips got too soggy the first time I made it so since then I have baked it without the chips & then served the chips on the side

My husband LOVES this. It isn't a fancy dish, but an easy and satisfying comfort dish. As other reviewers have commented, substitute the cream of mushroom for cream of celery. Heat the soups and Ro-tel on the stove first, it blends the flavors. Use cut up corn tortillas instead of chips.  Use a store bought rotisserie chicken.  Fast and delicious. I serve it with corn bread. I bake mine covered at 325 for 20 minutes, top with cheese, bake uncovered another 15 minutes or so until bubbly and cheese is melted. Add a dollop of sour cream when serving.

It was ok. After also adding a can of corn I barely had enough filling to complete two layers. The filling was ok, but I thought it was a little bland.

20 minutes isn't long enough to heat the casserole through. The corn chips made it salty...I will use corn tortillas next time I make this...

This was really good, but I used taco flavored chips and that added just the right amount of spice.  Served with alvocado slices and tossed salad. It was a hit.

I don't  like to use corn chips, I prefer use corn tortillas.  I cubed the chicken and cooked it in butter, chopped green onion, and chopped red bell pepper before adding to the dish per the other reviews.  I also added 4 oz. of sour cream to the mix before cooking.  I also add 2 tsp. of chile powder and 1 tsp. cumin. It really gives it that Texas twang!     Super Easy!  Thanks!

This recipe was tasty, but very different from other King Ranch Chicken dishes I've had.  This was more "chicken nachos" than casserole. I might make it again as a party dip or appetizer, but leave the chips out while baking and just serve them on the side.  Mushy chips don't appeal to me, and it makes for really bad leftovers.

This recipe followed as written did not turn out well. The short cook time, low temp and raw onions is not a good combination. After the cook time indicated, I turned up the heat to 350 and kept it in the oven for 40 more minutes. After that, it was a bit dry (duh) and the chips were browned. Needless to say, it wasn't that tasty.

Not pretty on the plate, but sure does taste yummy.  I did use my own precooked and seasoned chicken mix, but I don't think that would have made much difference.

Pretty good recipe overall. I did feel it was a little bland the first time I made it, but made some minor adjustments and it was much tastier the second time. I boiled the chicken in adobo and then shredded it to mix in with cream of chicken soup, salsa, & sour cream. I then poured the whole mixture over a layer of tortilla chips in a 9x13 baking dish & cooked for about 20 minutes.

Very good recipe but, I've found that if you add 1/4 cup Velveeta cheese, the consistency is much better by not sticking together.

This recipe was just okay.  I don't think the baking temp or time is quite right.  I left it in the oven for an additional 15 minutes and it still was not hot.  Probably won't make again.

This was a good BASE recipe.  Waaay too much onion, and I very thinly sliced them, and they were still way too strong.  I'll do what other reviewers said and cook the onions first, but I'll probably only use about half the onion next time.

A good change to this recipe would be instead of the chips on the bottom, use Knorr Rice sides, Mexican rice(pre-cooked) and then layer it the same way, but also using sliced FRESH mushrooms mixed in with the sauce.  YUM!  Thanks for sharing!

I added a few ingredients which I thought gave it a rating of 4 out of 5 stars. I added two fresh diced tomatoes, about 1/2 a bunch of fresh chopped cilantro, and 4 sliced green onions.  I chopped up whole wheat tortillas instead of tortilla chips and mixed all ingredients together before baking.  Delicious as main dish or would be good wrapped in tortillas with rice.

Easy to put together and the family enjoyed it.  But, they were surprised it's wasn't spicy.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts--cubed and cooked in a little oil and garlic and added cumin, chilli powder, and cayenne.  No onion.  Added a can of drained black beans.  Combined the tomatoes and two "cream of" soups (one chicken & one celery) and maybe 3/4 cup of cheese.  Added the soup/tomato/cheese mix to the chicken/beans and poured it over the tortilla chips.  No layering.  I'm assuming my husband added cheese to the top after it baked for 20 minutes...  I used maybe 1 1/2 to 2 cups cheese total.  Much faster to glop it all onto the chips rather than try layering it.

So, is King Ranch a restaurant or brand or something?

I thought this was pretty good...wish it was a little healthier, and had a bit more of a kick, but we still really enjoyed it. I layered the tortilla chips on the bottom of the dish and then mixed the cans of soup, rotel, part of the shredded cheese, and the chicken together and poured it on top of the chips. I then topped with some crumbled chips and the rest of the cheese. Yum!

YUMMY!!!!!! even broke the food strike of our 2 year old grandson!!!! I used a deli chicken, sauted onions, 2 cloves minced garlic, and 1 large red pepper chopped fine, in olive oil. Went together fast. We also put mild salsa on it as it was a little dry. Planning to try it with pork cooked in the crockpot!

I didn't really care much for this one.  I like the others using flour tortillas in the layers better.  For me, the 14 oz. bag of chips was way too much for it.  Some of the chips were soggy, some were crunch, and it was just plain dry.  Didn't work for me, sorry.

I made this tonight for my family.  I followed the instructions exactly.  We did not like it.  It didn't work out well.  The chips and onions stayed hard and the canned mixture just got warm.  I don't get this dish.  I won't be making it again.

It was a hit here!  Sooooo tasty!  My husband also suggested that we could make this into a dip, a real hearty one for sure!  Just cut the chicken up much smaller and don't add the chips in but instead just scoop with the chips!

I forgot to get tortilla chips. Instead I cooked penne pasta, mixed in the tomatoes, perdue shortcuts chicken, cream of chicken soup, mushroom soup, onion, and cheese, and baked at 350 for 20 min or until the cheese was melted. It tasted delicious and Dale absolutely loved it!

I followed instructions but the onion did not cook enough, so we got crunches of strong onion.  I would try it again, but saute the onion first or use some salsa with the rotel tomatoes.

This was delicious - I was not able to use as many tortilla chips as I was concerned about the space and I used rotel tomatoes w/green chilies - Also shared this recipe with a girl I work with who also thought it was very tasty.  I did think the chips would be crunchy but maybe if I had used more

we thought this recipe could have been improved by removing the tomatoes and tortilla chips.  mixing the soups & tomatoes didn't work for us.  we didn't care for the chips & would suggest instead using mexican rice in its place.

It had some good flavors, and some not so good flavors. I would change a few things. I did dice and fry the chicken with added cumin, garlic and chili powder. Without that I don't think I would have given it even 3 stars. The onions and tomatoes were still pretty raw after such a short time in the oven. Next time  I would pre-cook chicken and onions together and possibly use tortillas instead of chips. Definintely needed to cook longer at a higher temp.

I didn't expect to like this as much as I did. Yummy! We topped it with a little tabasco and sour cream.  Next time, however, I think I'll carmelize the onions before adding them to the mix (they kind of overpowered everything else.)

Absolutely delicious & easy recipe; I will definitely make it again. It makes a lot - will feed at least 8 as stated. The one thing I will do the next time is to pre-cook the onions till they are soft. When the casserole was done, the onions were still crunchy, which wasn't a texture that worked well with the rest of the casserole. Even the finely-chopped ones were not soft enough. It certainly wasn't a flaw that will keep me from making it again & again.

I had never made this before and I was skeptical.  But, the fam loved it.  I had lettuce, tomatoes, and guacomole on the side with more chips that were left over in the bag.  The chips in the casserole were not crunchy, but I suspected they wouldn't be before I even started.

Very easy, everyone loved it.  I did shred the Chicken as someone suggested and that worked out very well.  I added Jalapenos when I added the cheese on top at the end to kick it up a notch.

I used Corn Tortillas, 3 layers,  I used 2 cans of mushroom soup, 1 can of cream of chicken, 1 can rotel,about a 1/2 cup of the broth from the chicken I boiled. & 1 can Mexican corn, Also, I used 5 boiled chichen thighs. I cooked it at 350 for 40 minutes after it was all mixed together.

This dish was really easy to make and super-yummy!  I got corn tortilla rounds and used about 2/3 of the bag ... using the whole bag would have been excessive, I think.  I also didn't layer the rest of the ingredients, rather mixed it all up (with just half the cheese) and poured the mixture on top of the tortillas and then sprinkled the top with the rest of the cheese.  I also crumbled some crushed tortillas on top (which really made no difference to the end result).   I put it in the oven at 300 as suggested but after about 15 mins I saw it wasn't doing much and I increased the oven to 350.  It definitely cooked more than 20 mins, probably around 40 (I didn't keep track).  The dish was really really good ... the ONLY change I will make next time is to add a small can of mild green chilis since my husband seemed to think it needed a bit more flavor/spice... for little kids tho, this would be perfect as written.

I make this all the time.  My secret is to use cheese doritos for the chips. It gives it a kick. Also, I make white rice and eat it on the side. Serve with a spoon full of sour cream and salsa on top. Deee-lisch!

This dish was too salty for me, but that was mostly my fault.  I sauteed onions and some garlic paste first, then added the chicken and a packet of fajita seasoning before the rest do the wet ingredients.  That would have been the perfect amount of salt (even with the Campbell's cream soups), but the tortilla chips I used had loads of salt on them, so keep that in mind when layering.  

Ideas:  
1.  Put the broiler on for about five minutes if the cheese isn't browning nicely.  It bubbles it up and makes it look nice and golden.
2.  350 for 45 minutes is best, even with the wet contents mixed in a deep saute pan.
3.  If you mix all the wet ingredients (including half the cheese) in a deep skillet, it'll make an amazing dip!  I was dipping some tortilla chips in it before layering!  Make sure to saute with fajita or taco seasoning, though!  And don't forget a teaspoon or so of garlic paste.  Start with butter or olive oil and the onions and garlic paste.  Then add chicken and saute until it is golden, adding the seasoning packet little by little.
4.  Use the lower sodium soups if your tortilla chips are salty.

I lost my recipe for this dish, but this one is pretty close.  i did a little adjustments, but not much.  I did saute the onions and added 2 tsp of minced garlic.  Since my family members are all wimps, I used half a can of Rotel, and half a can of diced tomatoes with onion.  Turned out great.  I like the use of tortilla chips instead of corn tortillas.  Good texture and less soggyness! It was gone the first nite!

I thought this recipe was tasty, but a bit too much sauce for my liking. I think I will scale it down to one can of cream of chicken soup next time. For extra flavor, I sauteed the chicken breast with taco seasoning, with the onions, green pepper and chiles, and it added a fuller dimension of taco flavor.

Tasty and easy, my hubby liked it too.
I made this even easier by popping 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts into my slowcooker with a a couple of chopped garlic cloves, a squeeze of lime and a dash of cinnamon, cayenne, mexican oregano, cumin and tequila.  In a few hours the chicken was done and I shredded it and added the other ingredients (except the cheese and chips) then put it in a casserole dish on top of the chips and sprinkled cheese on top and baked according to the recipe directions, yummy!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is wonderful.  My mom has been making this for years and my family loves it.  I use 2 cans of cream of chicken instead of the mushroom soup because I don't like mushrooms.  Also I increased the temp to 375 for 30 minutes so it would be heated thru.

This recipe was great! I used 2 lb chicken that I cooked on the stovetop with the Taco Seasoning I recipe from this site. That was enough to give the casserole some kick. For the bottom crust I used 3 tortillas torn in strips and a handful of crushed tortilla chips. I also sprinked a few tortilla chips and some green onions on top before serving. Served with sour cream and chips for dipping and got rave reviews. I also mixed 1/2 the cheese in with the casserole.

I give this a five because the chicken mixture was wonderful.  I didnt have cream of mushroom so I used two cans of cream of chicken.  The tortilla chips were not a hit though.  I didnt mark the recipe down because I think it is a matter of taste.  We put sour cream on top.  I will be making this again using rice or noodles instead.

This was quite good.  We used a rotisserie chicken and that was very easy.  I added a can of black beans and some frozen corn.  I mixed everything together except the shredded cheese and put the mixture over the chips, then topped with cheese.  Also made good leftovers!

I LOVE this recipe.  This is the greatest thing since "sliced bread".  I always modify it slightly and it always turns out great, so don't be afraid to change this recipe.  I usually roast a chicken the day before and whatever is left over I will chop and put in half this recipe.  Make sure that your layer of chips is not too dense, you want the chips to be slightly soggy, like a noodle.  I didn't have tomatoes with green chiles, so I used half a can of stewed tomatoes and half a 4 oz. can of green chiles, worked just as well!  Since I halved the recipe, I just used one can of cream of mushroom soup.  I also added a handful of frozen corn in with the soup mixture for more veggies.  Half of this recipe will still feed 2 adults, 2 very young children two meals.  I will serve cornbread with this meal, and I put the rest of the green chiles, as well as some corn and cheese in the cornbread for a tasty side to this dish.  Love it, love it!  If you like Tex-Mex food, then you really should try this dish.

Pretty good.  Not as flavorful as I would like.  I think I'll use a different brand of tomatoes next time....

This is super yummy.  I add 1 small can of "mexi corn" (corn w/peppers), and use packaged/shredded chicken for tacos instead of cooking the  chicken to save time.  Thanks!!!!

This dish was easy to prepare, and had a nice kick to it.  I crushed a few extra chips on top after it was cooked to give it extra crunch.

This was really good.  My hubbie loved it.  Can't wait for the grandkids to come home from college to try it.  I'm sure it will become a favorite of theirs also.  Thanks for such a quick and easy recipe.

This was really tasty! So I gave it five stars. However, I think it could be better. Cut back on the onion, so maybe 3/4 an onion. Mix half of the cheese into the casserole. I think I might serve chips on the side instead of actually inside the casserole. Serve refried beans on the side (or maybe in a layer?). And leave in the oven 30 minutes or so before putting the cheese on it (ours was not hot enough). Definately will be making again!

My whole family (including my mother who doesn't like cheese on anything) loved this recipe.  I made it just as it is written.  We even fought over the leftovers for breakfast the next morning.  I am using it as a frozen dinner to give to a friend for a birthday gift.  thank you for the recipe. Kathleen

I would have given this 5 stars, but I didnt care for the dish too much, although my kids and husband loved it.  I made a fews changes, instead of the can of mushroom soup, I used an extra can of cream of chicken, plus I used cheese Doritos instead of plain corn chips.  The next time I make this, I will also add a layer of chips to the top to add a little extra crunch.

This recipe was good.  I think I should have broken up the chips a little before layering them in the casserole dish.  I used chunks of chicken breasts, which I cooked up with the onion.  The overall taste of the dish was good, just a bit salty.  The appearance of the dish wasn't too pretty though, that may have been my fault.  I think I will try this recipe again, however I may use other reviewers' suggestions and try it with corn or flour tortillas.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was okay...not like I remember my mother making. I did add green peppers to the onions (like one of the other reviewers suggested), but I should have sauteed them a bit before adding them to the mix (they were still a bit crunchy). Also, I think the flavor was a bit bland. Maybe adding garlic or something would have helped.

This is an awesome recipe!!!! It is very good with white corn tortillas cut up in strips.  I have never used chips but I am sure it works out about the same... We use extra cheese and use the mixed chedder/jack cheese and we use Rotel and 2 cans of cream of mushroom to 1 can of chicken for a different taste... also good to use 1 bell pepper (we use red) sauteed with the onions.  In addition, while boiling the chicken it is best to add bay leaves to the water while boiling.. gives it that extra bit of flavor.

I used one pound of uncooked, cubed chicken tenders, and baked it for about 45 minutes, until the chicken was cooked through.  I also used just enough chips to cover the bottom of my casserole dish- not a whole bag.  It was still very good-- very creamy & cheesy, and a good comfort food.  I'm eating leftovers today using tortilla chips and eating it as a very thick dip- I thought about running it through a food processor and serving it as a dip next time.  Yum!

The first go around with this recipe was really dry. I don't know what went wrong. The flavor was great but there were way too many chips and I only used a 12 oz bag. They weren't even covered with the soup mixture. For the left overs I added 1/2 can of each soup and refried beans, and that was perfect. Really tasty!

Good basic start.  I don't do canned soups, not too many kosher ones.  So I did a white sauce made with chicken broth.  Worked well and did fresh mushrooms.  The children loved it.  I also put some left over soft tortilla strips in on top of the crispy ones and it worked well too.

Excellent recipe.  Changes I would make include dicing the onion and chopping up the chicken into small pieces. Flavor is for a more adult palate (in my opinion) and mixes well with white wine.

My family loves this recipe!  We have it at least once a week and my husband has been known to have it for lunch as long as it will last.  I use rotel tomatoes for the tomatoe mixture and add a bit more cheese and chips on top. I've also used leftover turkey in place of the chicken and it has been just as delicious! AAA+++

I followed directions to a T. I don’t think if anything changed you should review a recipe. I thought the recipe was rather dry. It needs something else. It was alright as far as taste goes but i will not use this recipe again.

Made this with the Mexican Cornbread as suggested and put it over rice. The chips were probably unnecessary and the chicken could’ve been mixed with the soup mixture to simplify, with cheese on top.

First time making KRC with tortilla chips instead of soft corn tortillas.  They still got soft but felt like they had more "oomph" than the soft ones (the soft ones essentially totally dissolve into the rest of the ingredients).  Tasty.

I went right by the recipe except I added a bit of chicken broth (from the boiled chicken) ... perhaps about a cup.    I will make this again... I made King Ranch Chicken many years ago, and forgot how good it is.  This recipe is much easier than the one I used to use.
I might add a few jalapenos to give it more heat.

I used Campbell's Golden Mushroom Soup because that's what I had on hand.  I also substituted the other can of soup with sour cream.  Delicious!

Delicious!  I made some Man-Pleasing Chicken in the CrockPot and it didn't turn out well.  So I shredded my thighs from the other recipe and put in this.  It turned out great!  I will make this again!

I decided to use some suggestions made regarding this recipe.  I did use corn chips on the bottom and instead of cream of mushroom soup I did use  white queso blanco dip.
It turned out great.  There is one other thing that should be changed,  the dish was not hot enough.  Next time I would cook it at least 325 for 1/2 an hour.

this is not really King Ranch Chicken. It's a quick short cut to something similar to it, but not as comforting as the classic. The biggest diff. is the use of chips instead of tortillas.  They take on a weird texture and do not satisfy. Leftovers were gross instead of tastier.  Not impressed with this shortcut.

Easy to make, I used shredded chicken I bought from my local grocery H-E-B. And I cooked it 40 minutes as it wasn’t done at 20. I put final layer of cheese at 30 minutes and cooked it 10 more minutes till cheese was all melted. Not spicy, but good safe dish to make for Kids and adults alike.  Add salsa if you want a little kick. Would make again!

Great taste and easy to make. I found it to be a little dry. Next time I'll add some more liquid. I also added a can of drained pinto beans which was a good addition since we like our beans. I will make this again!

I made this exactly as the recipe states except I put the last layer of cheese on before baking.  I baked at a higher temp (375) for 35 minutes but for some reason, the 10 oz bag of chips I used (not 14 oz as the recipe calls), were crunchy in the bottom of the pan when I took it out.

After my wife and I ate a serving, I poured about half a cup of chicken bouillon over the top and created holes in the cheese with a spoon so it could soak in. Covered it with foil, then I put it back in at 400 for 10 minutes.  I let it rest for 10 minutes and now the chips are perfect now, not "crunchy and not coated with soup mix".

I found it too be too dry.  The chips on the bottom were still crunchy. 300 degree oven too low for heating    I will add a little cream, water or broth to the next one. Flavor is real good though.

I made this as written,however, the verdict from my family was it was okay not great. To suit mine,and my family’s tastes I made a few changes. I used low sodium cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom and to that I added 1 tablespoon of dry Ranch dressing mix. I replaced the tortilla chips with soft corn tortillas cut into strips that I placed in the bottom of the casserole dish. For the rest of the ingredients I kept the same.For my family the changes hit the spot and it was gobbled up!

This a great QUICK recipe that won't last long in the pan!  I did cook the onion in a skillet before adding it into the recipe  and I boiled 3 chicken breasts and then shredded the chicken. My husband is not a fan of casseroles but loved this and went back for second and third helpings. Will definitely make this again!

As a Chef, this is a pretty cool recipe ... Like a "Mad Scientist", I am always seeking new ideas. I did change up the recipe a bit. Overall, it was pretty yummy ... I served the dish over white rice.

Very good!  I had never heard of King Ranch Chicken until I had it at a restaurant.  I picked this recipe because it looked like the easiest of the King Ranch recipes on Allrecipes I did make 3 small changes which I don't think really affect the rating of this exact recipe. 1) I left out the onion since we don't like onion.  However, I can't see how it would change the recipe much - it would just add onion flavor which would be great, if you like onions.  2)I didn't layer the chicken and the "goop".  I just mixed the chicken, soups, etc. together and spread over the chips.   3) Since this was a new recipe and there are just 2 of us I didn't want to make a large 9x13 all at once.  Instead I made the "goop" as written but used a smaller dish and baked only half.   (I didn't need to worry as it was a big hit)   Very easy to make and was VERY good re-heated.  (I maybe even liked it better)  To reheat I put a fresh layer of tortilla chips on my plate, spread the King Ranch mix over it and put in the microwave for about 1 to 2 minutes.  This seems like a recipe that could have other things easily thrown in.  For example you could add mushrooms, olives, spicier peppers, etc.

I have been making this for years and everybody loves it. I think I may try it with the cream of celery soup for a little different flavor like another reviewer said. It s a great, fast meal if you need to get dinner on the table in a hurry,especially if you use boneless,skinless breasts.

I made this with corn tortillas cut into 1-2" squares, and it was perfect! Exactly how I hoped it would taste, as a few people at our party were eating this for the first time. Highly recommend!

I used fresh rotisserie chicken.  For the mixture I used cream of chicken soup, fire roasted tomatoes, colby jack & some velveeta (half of a large box).  Added some onion & fajita seasonings and about a cup of sour cream.  Topped with more colby jack.  Delicious!  The original recipe was lacking some seasonings but very good overall!

I have been making this recipe with my mom since I can remember. Except we use Fritos rather then just plan tortilla chips. It is diffidently a favorite at my house! I also make the mix while the chicken in boiling and leave it in the fridge until the chicken is done. It ends up being a little spicier then my moms.

We add mushrooms. Fresh or canned. Line the dish with flour tortilla. My mother-in- law gave me this recipe 37 years ago. A family and friend favorite. But variations on it are what makes it so yummy and fun to make. I have also made this with Hamburger/ round steak whatever I have. Yummy always

So easy and it is very delicious.  I used the flour tortillas at the HEB and Krogers by us they have a salsa tortilla that works perfectly.  I have had so many people ask me for this recipe.  Even the kids like it.

WAY too much onion, MUCH too short cooking time, not enough spice/flavor.  After realizing the flaws of the recipe while mine was in the oven, I mixed a packet of taco seasoning mix in a half cup of water and sprinkled across the dish.  Left to bake for an additional half hour but it could have used more.

Great recipe.  No Rotel. I used roasted "Hatch" Chilies from New Mexico. It's the season and they are everywhere in Houston, Tx. They are not HOT HOT but have a great flavor. Boiled chicken, baked at 300 for 45 minutes. No onions.

I made this but browned the onions and some garlic in olive oil prior to adding them as was suggested by another reviewer. The kids liked it and it was quick and easy.  A recipe to add to our dinner rotation!

I'm not sure if the intention of this recipe is to be nachos, but that's what it is. I didn't have the cream of mushroom so I used all cream of chicken, so maybe that's what made it so nacho-like. Used less cheese and everybody liked it!

I love this recipe and have even made it in crockpot as turning on the oven can sometimes heat up our whole 640sq. foot house.

This is a really good recipe.  I grew up with my Gran's King Ranch Chicken that had tortillas in it.  I made this one as directed, and the chips were SO good in it.  I had a bag of thicker tortilla chips, and they held up well in the casserole w/o getting mushy.  They also added a little salty kick that regular tortillas miss.  I'll definitely be making it this way from now on!

Grandson and niece hardly touched it.  They did like the chips, as some were crunchier than others.  I don't know, maybe they just weren't all that hungry.  I thought it was good.  I made it as written but could see where a pepper, garlic salt, etc might enhance it a little.  I was as much curious about the name as anything, so had to do a little research on that.  Thank you for sharing!

Excellent!!! I just had chicken breasts all ready to go, so I seasoned and browned them up real quick, then shredded them with forks. Still tasted awesome.  I think I need more chips the second time around, as they just became part of the mixture. I know they will soften anyways, but maybe I can layer them or ripped up tortillas throughout.

Excellent!!!  I used a Rotisserie Chicken.  I liked using the tortilla chips but will break them up slightly next time as is seemed difficult to dish out.  I also added crushed up tortillas to the top for an extra crunch.  My husband doesn't unually like chicken but really raved about this dish.

This was very delicious.  I added chopped onions and green peppers and used sour cream (8 oz) instead of mushroom soup.  I will make it again.  Its a KEEPER.

20 minutes at 300 degrees is not enough time to bake this. ..I baked an additions 20 minutes at 325.  Thought it was good.  Maybe to many taco chips...but I was surprised that they were so crispy.  I would make this again.

This is great...we called it "Mexican Chicken"...great for dinner entree or brunch...to aip up the flavor, I have added red pepper flakes and garlic is a MUST!   dON'T USE LOW FAT OR FF CHEESE...DOESN'T MELT OR SPREAD WELL.  How did it get this name of "King Ranch Chicken Casserole"???  Does anybody know?  Alittle chicken can go a long way.I often cut the chicken breasts horizontally and make thinner slices.

this is a good base. i'm not raving about it, my family liked it, and it was an easy recipe, so we will make again. I'll be tweaking the recipe next time, and post about that.

No flavor at all. After cooked, I added "crema neztle" to it and it kind of added some flavor to it. Disappointed, will not cook it again.

This was a really good casserole. I used turkey and added a can of corn the mixture. Our guests each had 2 helpings and my 2 small children really liked it. It isn't too spicy for their little palates. I would recommend this for a family dinner but probably not for serving at a dinner party. It doesn't come out of the dish very pretty.

This was easy, but are the measurements off? I opened a 14.5 bag of chips and it was overflowing the pan, so that didnt seem right. Maybe it depends on the brand of chips. I went ahead and used only half of the chips, but ended up doubling the sauce. I was worried about the chips being too crunchy on the bottom, so I was sure to cover them completely, then stirred them to assure they were all in the sauce and there were no dry areas. I am not sure how dry it would have been without doubling the sauce. The only other thing I did with the onions was to saute them in butter before adding them to the dish. That is a personal preference, though. The flavors were good, it just seemed to be "dry" as written.  Again, maybe it was just my brand of chips, but it was still good.

Didn't care for this recipe at all, the only flavor in this came from the Rotel and Cream of Mushroom soup I even added salt and pepper when it was done and it didn't help. Won't make this one again.

This is such a quick and easy way to use up leftover chicken, and it's delicious!  I used torn up flour tortillas on bottom instead of chips and it turned out great.  My two picky eaters ate it, as well.  Thanks for a great recipe!

The taste was there.  Really it was. (I added black beans, which everyone loved)  We just really didn't like the chips.  I make a very similar recipe with rice, I think I'll stick to that one.  This felt like a dip rather than a meal.  Thanks anyway!

I took this recipe to a potluck and everyone loved it. I ended up doubling the recipe, but I used less chicken than called for and it was still good. I might use a can of tomatoes next time instead of two cans of Rotel - it was a little spicy.   I also alternated corn tortillas and tortilla chips for different textures. The only main change I made was sauteeing the onion before throwing it in the mix. I don't know if it added that much to it, but it tasted great.

Good but not a contender for regular dinner recipe rotation. I will make this again, possibly.  There are just too many other great recipes on this website that are just as quick and easy.

My family did not like this verson of King Ranch.  I have four boys and that says a lot!  It had too many chips and it made it too dry.  Just my families oppinion.  Not enough kick either.

Very good, especially easy-prep (compared to other KRC casserole recipes here).  I used half an onion instead of a whole one, and sauteed until translucent.  Also added 1/4 tsp chili powder to soup mixture, and used quartered tortillas instead of chips.

My family loved this!  Even my 3 year old.  The only changes I made were to use cream of celery instead of cream of mushroom (because it's what I had on hand) and added a can of corn.  It was delicious!  The one thing I will do next time is to only use half the onion.

Great recipe. I have made this for years but our family calls it "Chicken Dorito." It's a great way to use up leftover chicken or use a rotisserie chicken. If you don't have tomatoes with chili peppers, I have used plain diced tomatoes and added salsa. That way it is as mild as you want it to be (or your kids want it to be). You can always serve a little side of chili peppers if someone wants more spice.

I took the advice of another reviewer and used tortillas instead of chips.  It was really good, but I think would be just as good with the chips.  Great busy night recipe.

This is a great dish! I used shredded turkey, sauteed the onion, added taco seasoning and used only cream of chicken soup. I served with Absolute Mexican Cornbread off this site. This is definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe has potential and I will try it again, but as is, for me, it didn't work.  I cooked my chicken the day before, so it was cold.  If you do this, you will need more than the 20 minutes the recipe states.  It took almost 40 at 300 degrees to get it nice and hot.  Also, I would suggest cooking your onions slightly before mixing them in if you don't want them crunchy in the casserole.  It had good flavor, just needs some tweaking.

Family and the meal coop I am in enjoyed this recipe! I also mixed all of the ingredients together, crushed the tortilla chips up and spread them on the bottom instead of layering them on the bottom. Also split the cheese between the mixture and topping. YUMMMMMYYYYY!!!

Pretty good, I have no complaints...I added some cayenne pepper to the chicken and used noodles instead of the chips. My family liked it. Not sure if I would make again, but overall this was a good dish.

My first thought when I read the recipe was it looked "bland, but appealing."  When we had it for dinner last night we all agreed that's exactly what it was, but more on the appealing side.  My family said it was a keeper.  Next time I will season the chicken with either chili powder or a package of taco seasoning and maybe add a 4 oz can of green chilies for a little more kick.  I will definitely make this again.  It was a real family pleaser!

This recipe is fabulous! I only put in about 3/4 a pound of chicken and it was plenty (for an apartment of girls at least). Other than that, I didn't change a thing. Can't say enough about this recipe...so easy and every single person loved it! Thanks for a keeper.

This was a bit flavorless in my opinion, and the onions were still raw after baking. I would have liked them to be cooked. I would definitely say it's a very kid-friendly casserole, though, and recommended it to one of my friends. I might try to make it a bit more "adult" next time by using tortillas instead of chips, sauteeing the onions, and adding a few more seasonings.

I enjoyed this and it went over well, I will cook the sautee the onions a bit before adding them to the mix next time though, the raw onions were a bit overpowering!

This was a super simple recipe and was pretty good. I followed another review and mixed all of the ingredients together to put on top of the chips. I may try adding corn and black beans next time to give it more flavor. We also put sour cream on top and it was great!

This recipe did not turn out at all for me.  Usually I can "save" food by adding something or cooking it longer, but this was just bad.  There was no saving it.  Nobody wanted to eat it.  The onions were raw (and I cooked it twice as long as it says), it had no flavor, and there were so many chips it was like eating nachos.

The only change I made was to boil the chicken with a packet of fajita seasoning for more flavor. DH loved it! He had 3 helpings!

The tortillas were alittle crunchy. If you added flour tortillas instead of the chips I think it would do the trick!

I used the less fat tortilla chips, only one can of 98% fat free soup with 1/2 can skim, 3 minced garlic cloves, reduced the cheese by half and added some mexican spices to taste.  Turned out pretty good!

Cooked this las night and thought it was great! First I boiled 4 boneless chicken breast in chicken broth with water, garlic, salt and pepper.I added shreaded cheddar, sour cream, and some paprika to the soup mix. Also I took the advise of the other user and added the chicked directly to the soup mixture and then put ontop the chips. My husband ate 3 plates! :) Thanks this will be made often now.

This recipe was quite good & super easy to make.  I couldn't find any diced tomatoes with chili peppers, so I used salsa instead & added a bit of water.  Also, I used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup (not everyone in the house likes mushrooms).  I was amazed at how much it did bake down since I was afraid that it would be too dry.  You can also add hot sauce or taco sauce to your own if you want it spicier.  Would be great with some lettuce on the side.  Thanks!

This recipe was tasty. I didn't have any cream of chicken soup so I used cream of mushroom and cream of onion instead - left out the chopped onion - used salsa flavored tortilla chips and added chopped olives & sour cream to the top. We will definitely make it again but next time will only use 1/2 the amount of chips because the amount the recipe calls for was WAY too much compared to the amount of the other ingredients.

It's a keeper! I wasn't paying attention and I mixed the rotel, soups, chicken and 1.5 c of cheese all together and it still came out great. You have to crunch up the chips to make it fit in the 13x9x2 pan.

I made this last night, so easy, very flavorful (spicy!) and we all thought it was a keeper.  I think I am going to add more chicken next time though, it makes a lot of "filling".  I also used 98% fat free soups and they tasted just fine.  Nice attempt to "lighten" it up.  Thanks for sharing!

This was an excellent meal.  I used canned chicken and it turned out great.  It was so easy to make.  I just mixed every thing to together and put a layer of tortilla chips in the bottom of the casserole dish and half of the mixture, half the cheese and another layer of tortilla chips and the other half of the mixture.  Then coninued with the rest of the recipe.  I will diffently make this again.
