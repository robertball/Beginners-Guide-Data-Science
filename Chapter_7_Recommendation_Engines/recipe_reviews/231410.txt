I love the idea of the phyllo dough cups, you could be very creative. Just put anything in the cups that you would put in a omelet. Thank you for the idea. I will serve this to my visiting family Thanksgiving morning.

I did pretty much the same as the recipe, I would be interested in adding some shredded potatoes to this but I don't know how it would cook. Will try it next time. Otherwise I really enjoyed this. The phyllo dough cooked perfectly like the picture.

It came out beautiful!  Great for entertaining.  Next time I will add more flavor to the spinach mixture... Maybe lemon or garlic.

I’ve been making these for a few months.  They are perfect for a grab n go breakfast during the week, so often I’ll make them on Sunday and then breakfast is covered through Friday!  I’ve continued to play with the recipe, my latest included Brussels sprouts and red & yellow bell peppers and chopped garlic.  They’re in the oven now!
