This is a "wow" on the tongue! I was pleasantly surprised. Read all reviews before starting, so I food processed yellow banana peppers and red onion in with the cauli. We only had one head of cauliflower, so I cut recipe in half. Next time I'll get another head of cauliflower! As we don't keep Italian dressing in the house I just added a mix of what might be equivalent: marjoram, sweet basil, kelp, freshly squeezed garlic, chives, parsley, tarragon, thyme, celery salt . . . but it still was lacking punch, so I added quite a bit of salt and then some paprika. Once it fried in the olive oil (with a wee bit of butter cut in), it was amazing! Thank you for this. I can see adding leftover mashed potatoes to the mix, kale, or artichoke hearts next time. It's a very flexible recipe--heat it up, mellow it out--all in your personal taste & preferences. Will stick this one in the recipe box to use again & again. And, no leftovers at all--phenomenal with a little aioli garlic mustard sauce on top, too! mmMMMmmm.

These are sooooooooooo good.  I added just a dash of red pepper flakes but otherwise, everything  just as the recipe called for.  I certainly will make these again.  My hubby and I ate the entire batch.  We used it as our main dish with a side salad.

Very simple and addictive! I forgot the baking powder and just used some salt, hot sauce and various dried herbs I had on hand for flavour, rather than any kind of premade dressing. It seems like the kind of recipe that it's hard to go wrong with. The texture was very nice too.

So I don't like to change a recipe the first time around but I was looking at a couple recipes to use up the cauliflower in my fridge and landed on this one.  I start putting ingredients together and realize I'm looking at the cauliflower mash recipe.  I figured how different can they be, just add eggs and baking powder and go with it!  I ended up adding  garlic, parmesan romano cheese and chives, because that's what the other recipe called for.  To turn them into fritters at this point I added 1/2 Italian bread crumbs, baking powder and eggs.  They turned out delicious.

I fiddled with this a bit and really liked the result. I am only cooking for two so I used two cups of cauliflower florets instead of six. I added 1/2 cup of raw organic wheat germ, 2 teaspoons of baking powder, 2 eggs, liberal amounts of dried basil, parsley, granulated garlic, minced onion, some oregano and a pinch of red pepper flakes. Fried in a small amount of rice bran oil. Delicious.

Very delicious. I decided to add Parmesan Cheese. It gave it more moisture so I cooked them about 4 minutes on each side.

Surprisingly delicious. So good in fact, I made a second batch right after the first bite of the first batch and I'm single. Plan to freeze some and reheat in the toaster over. I used a 12 inch skillet and placed 1 tablespoon oil spread with a brush for each batch. I made bigger fritters using 1/3 to 1/2 cup batter for each and then pressed down with back of spatula to flatten them. Each side took 2-3 minutes to get golden brown. Didn't have the Italian Dressing Mix (IDM) so I made a recipe by the same name on this site and greatly reduced the salt to 1 teaspoons in the IDM. I used 2 tablespoons of the mix in the fritters. Perfect. These are healthy, tasty little gems. So good, I'll bring them to the next pot luck with the gals and see if they can detect what's in these fritters. The addition of parmesan cheese or percorino romano might take these over the top over the top again. Thought they may need a green onion dip or topping to really hit the spot but they didn't need anything. Thanks so much Bettycook for a great recipe.

These were very yummy but had my whole family's (including the one year old baby who never has a problem with gas) stomachs in knots with gas for over 24 hours after eating them! I followed the recipe exactly, and we have never had a problem with eating cauliflower before, even in large quantities. I do not recommend giving these to small children unless you want to deal with a crying baby with a sore tummy!

No flour on hand, so I tried other stuff- ended up making two batches. First I tried a little corn starch in place of the flour. They came out sloppy soggy and fell apart. Next batch I used dehydrated potatoes. (instant potatoes) Those fritters came out really well. Turns out the instant potatoes provide a good option for those on a gluten-free diet. But you really do need the flour or something to make the cakes stick together, otherwise it becomes a sloppy mess in the pan. There is a surprising amount of moisture that needs to be sopped up by the flour or whatever, tinkerers take note. One head of cauliflower makes enough for two people and then some. Added in some broccoli for a little color and flavor. Another note: they seemed easier to make on high or medium high heat, using an oil that can take the heat. (I used refined coconut oil for the second batch, worked a treat!)

Very good. Light and fluffy, fried in high heat oil as well, turned out great. Also tried out ranch seasoning - I prefer it to the italian.

Incredible! My 15 month old and husband LOVED these as much as I did. Seriously had to put them away so that we didn't just eat them all! Previous reviews helped me figure out that you indeed start with raw cauliflower. Used seasonings similar to what I'd use for homemade meatballs or salmon patties. Kicked to a "whole 'nother level" when served with banana pepper rings. Thanks for this new addition to our repertoire! (My kiddo usually *does* have trouble with gas and these did not cause any problems for her).

Oh, my WORD!!! These are VERY goood! Kind of addicting, too. I opted to use Canola Oil, as it is so much better than Olive oil.....if frying. :) Anyway...TRY THESE! My daughter, who isn't that fond of cauliflower, LOVED these! As for the "gassy tummy problems", haven't had any problems!

This recipe seemed really bland to me., much like fried mashed potato patties. That's a good thing if you are feeding children who prefer blander foods. As an adult, however, I think it needs more seasoning. I think it would benefit from salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika, hot sauce, a touch of cayenne or maybe red pepper flakes (not all of them, but at least one) or some herbs. I added about 3 tablespoons of a shredded parmesan/romano blend, but we really couldn't taste it. I also only used two eggs because the mixture was moist enough to clump together without that third egg.

Added salt, pepper, & crushed red pepper flakes. We really liked it, but thought it still needed a little more spunk. Used about 1/4 cup oil, which was too much. Served with horseradish sauce. Will definitely make again, with just minor adjustments.

This was a big hit with my family!  I was looking for a new way to serve cauliflower.  It was easy to make - I grated the cauliflower with my KitchenAid attachment.  I did cook them in the oil, but I would be tempted to try my nonstick pancake griddle next time...

I have used many recipes off this site but this is the first time I have taken the time to comment.  
This recipes is a keeper.  My 3 kids gobbled these up faster than I could make them, I have never went through a cauliflower so fast.  Next time I think I will try adding green onion.

Very good! Added 1 cup of mild banana pepper rings to the cauliflower in the food processor and salted after frying. Also added 1 tsp pepper to the mix. Kids ate them up, and it's usually a fight to get the veggies in. Offered them ranch to dip, but they did not use it.

I have made these two ways and both were inhaled by my family the first time I made these I did so per the recipe instructions. Family loved them and I had no complaints even from the picky eaters. The second time I decided to take the base and change the Italian dressing packet and substitute Indian favors. I used 1-2tbs of curry powder and some extra turmeric and ground coriander as well as a clove of crushed garlic . I think toasted cumin seeds would also be great. I added minced cilantro to the batter as well. Fried them up in coconut oil but I am sure any oil would be fine. Served with a side of mango and coriander chutney with plain Greek yogurt on the side. These were also inhaled!  Thanks for the recipe.

Fantastic! I did add a bit more flour than the recipe called for and got a bit creative with my own spiced but they were loved by everyone in my house! I'm already thinking of making these with carrots or zuchinni?

I added salad and pepper, but every recipe should have one or both to satisfy the American taste.  So my diabetic husband is having problems with his high sugar and also a problem eating vegies.  I decided to make the faux mashed potatoes and found this recipe by mistake, and OH what a wonderful mistake it was.  My kids love them, but they love vegies, but my husband said interesting and then gulped down about 4 of them.  Yes this was a hit.

I used fresh herbs and chives, with black pepper and garlic, and crushed red pepper, and Locatelli Pecorino Romano instead of the package of Italian seasoning.

I made it and it was very good. I added 1/2 cup of grated parmesan cheese. I tried putting them in the pan with the ice cream baller but they were too loose and coming apart so I made them by hand and they held together beautifully. excellent taste and quick to make. I think I will add some mozzarella and black pepper as well next time. Overall excellent. my daughter is not fond of vegetables but liked this. sort like a rice ball.

I went the deep fryer route and made them like hush puppies.  They were wickedly good!  Total keeper.

So easy and delicious.  I added a bit more flour.  You can tell by the consistency if you need to add a little more flour.  My friends and I love this recipe.

This is a great little recipe to get veggie-haters to enjoy cauliflower, and it's easy to customize to your flavor prefs and what's in the pantry. My girlfriend and I are both fans, even though she doesn't like most vegetables, including cauliflower. It eats like a fast food treat but delivers lots of vitamin A--a win-win in my book!

I've tried a few variations by now, including adding things like garlic, shredded cheese or ranch dressing, and really the one thing you have to watch out for is maintaining the right level of moisture. Adding wet seasonings will quickly make the batter start to get watery and fall apart, making it very hard to work with, and coming back from that point is really fiddly.

Will make it often.  One of my favorite side dishes is Alton Brown's Broccoli and Cauliflower dish with chopped egg and buttery crackers.    These fritters are a simple and delicious side dish alternative to that dish.  I will try them with broccoli as well and report back.   These will be a hit, I promise, and simple to make.

5 stars because my 2 and 1/2 year old willingly ate them! He especially liked dipping them in the red sauce. I used a decent size head of cauliflower which I wasn’t sure was 6 cups, or possibly more, so I used a fourth egg for good measure. I hate when things don’t stick together!

These are fantastic!  And I hate cauliflower!  LOL...  I made them gluten free by getting rid of the flour and using 1/4 c almond flour and 1/4 c tapioca flour.  Instead of the salad dressing mix, I used 1T of Italian seasoning, 3/4 t salt, 3/4 garlic.  I like things really salty so you might want to cut the salt back to 1/2 t.

This is a great recipe that you can easily make your own.  I've made it several times & my 2 year old always loves them.  Once I even added a half of a cooked butternut squash to the recipe with spices out of the cupboard & it was delicious.  As others have stated I always add the breadcrumbs on the outside of the fritter as well. Enjoy!

i don't know if it was because I riced my cauliflower a couple of days ahead or what ... but these were so moist it was hard to flip the patties withou them falling apart. I even added bread crumbs to just have enough glue to be able to flip them.  For the amount of work involved, I probably won't make again. If I do, add lots of Panko for a less soggy patty.

I didn't care for this. It masked the taste of the cauliflower and turned something relatively healthy into a greasy gut bomb. I loved the idea though. I might try this again but oven "fry" instead.

I scaled the recipe down to two servings. I had leftover cooked cauliflower and broccoli mixed with the insides of potatoes (from garden stuffed potatoes, also from this site), so I used that for half of the mixture and raw cauliflower for the rest. Other than using what I had, followed the recipe exact. They turned out delicious! I will be making these again and again!

These were excellent, I threw in some chopped green onion and my own spices (garlic and onion powder, season salt, cayenne, paprika).  Next time I might put in a teeny amount of grated asiago or some other strong cheese.

Made a vegan version of this, as a side dish to my vegan chilli. Instead of using three eggs, I used flax eggs (1 tbsp powder flax seed + 3 tbsp water = 1 flax egg). I didn’t have Italian dressing mix. So, used used 1 tbsp Italian seasoning plus salt, black pepper, and smoked paprika to taste. I think I also processed my cauliflower florets too much. Next, time I’ll give it two fewer pulses. Turned out delicious though!

I made these Cauliflower fritters this evening and was so impressed because it was so simple; I guess the hardest part was processing the cauliflower but aside from that, it was all good.  I didn't change anything but next time I will add a little heat.    As I mixed the ingredients I thought it was kinda dry but that changed soon as the batter moistened up and the fritters cooked perfectly!  I'll be making this recipe again!

These are pretty amazing! However when We made them, they went onto the George Foreman Grill. Brushed the grill with a tiny bit of Peanut oil before putting the fritters on and cooked until well browned. Sprinkled with a bit of Kosher Salt as soon as they came out. They were gone in a flash.

I enjoyed the dish but other members did not care for it.  They claimed they could not taste the cauliflower.

These were easy and delicious. If I change anything for the next time I make it, it will be to add a bit of cayenne to spark the flavor a bit.

Since you can also eat the stalks of cauliflower I just ground up large chunks, florets, stalks and all in my food processor.  Didn't use italian dressing but just seasoned with thyme, basil, kosher salt.  Preparation is very easy, frying takes a bit of time.

Since I left out the flour for low carb, it was fairly good. I added Parmesan cheese which I should have lowered the heat.

I didn't have Italian seasoning so used Epicure 3 onion dip mix instead.
Delicious!

No changes necessary!  This was a hit at our church small group that we host at our home.  Delicious, quick, easy with few ingredients.  I bought the frozen riced cauliflower that Bird's Eye makes and it went together in a flash!

These are very tasty. I made one-third of the recipe (for two servings), substituted a flaxseed "egg" for the regular egg and added some nutritional yeast to help bind the fritter mix and for added flavor. I'll definitely make these again.

Everyone loved it!   I added some chopped onions, fresh parsley, chopped red pepper and a little Italian style bread crumbs to the original recipe, although as i'm typing my review I realized I forgot to add the garlic, oops!

Make sure you keep them flat so they cook faster.

These fritters were easy to make and we really liked them.  My hubby never, ever eats cauliflower so this was a first for him!  I am so glad I found a new way to prepare cauliflower that he likes.  I did have to do a few revisions.  I didn't realize that the cauliflower should be raw, plus I was using leftover cauliflower that was already steamed.  When I had all the ingredients mixed together I could see these would never stay together as a fritter, so I dumped everything into a strainer and pushed out the excess liquid.  That worked fine.  I didn't have any dry Italian dressing mix, so I substituted with Italian seasoning blend.  It was very good especially with the chicken picatta served as the main dish.  I think next time I will try the ranch seasoning idea I read in another post.  This is an excellent and healthy side dish.  Thanks for the yummy recipe BettyCook! I will definitely make this again, only with raw cauliflower next time.

I made this last night for dinner and they nearly did not make it to the table.  They were being grabbed as fast as I finished them! This recipe is a keeper! The only thing I would add is some salt into the mixture before frying.

It was easy to make but there wasn't much flavor.  I added some cumin & chili powder to the second batch.  This has potential just needs a boost.

I made a vegan version with flax eggs-2tbsp flax and 3tbs water-also I used 1/3rd French onion soup packet in place of the dressing packet, as well as whole wheat flour for the app purpose-so delicious! I’m surprised at how much these tasted like actual potato patties!

My family makes cauliflower fritters for the holidays but it’s different from this recipe. 1 large cauliflower cut up into pieces (not too small) then boiled till soft.  In a bowl add 1egg, flour,1 tble spoon baking soda, parsley, finely chopped onion, grated Parmesan cheese (more the merrier) salt n pepper to taste.  You just want to get it to look close to a pancake batter.  Add oil to a heated pan and fry them up.  Delicious!!

while I never make most recipes exact, I use the basic idea of the recipes.  Not having a food processor I used my blender and after chopping the cauliflower I drained it, but if I do it again I would drain and then dry on a towel or something and then kept adding flour to the mixture to get a good consistence and then fried them.  Found them to be quite good.  I think next time I will just let them drain longer. makes me willing to try cauliflower mashed like potatoes.

It was awesome. But I added a pinch of salt and half a cup of parmesan cheese. I topped it off with green onion and some Sirrachi. ??

Absolutely a great way to serve cauliflower.  It's a very easy recipe and you can vary it with broccoli and also serve it with sauces.  We really enjoyed the flavor!

Will definitely make again.  I added minced scallions and a bit of grated parmesan.  Did not use dressing mix, but instead just used dried herbs, salt and pepper.  Sometimes I add a bit of minced fresh parsley if I have it on hand.  Very yummy.  Many thanks to the recipe submitter for this idea.  I live alone and have trouble using up an entire head of cauliflower.  Now I use half to make cauliflower soup and the other half to make these fritters.

I omitted the baking powder and  Italian dressing and changed it up. We used adobo, minced onion and a pinch of garlic powder.  You can add cheese on top for a nice taste! My 2 yr old loved it!

Overall was yummy and easy.  Needed more seasoning to my taste.  Would rather add my own seasonings than the powdered dressing.  Sauted some onion and added to batter.  Also to get it browned took more oil than i usually use.  But soaked it up with paper towels.  Nice with apple sause like latkes.  Would make again got thumbs up from the family for a "super food".

This was delicious.  I didn't have Italian dressing mix on hand, but I used another vinaigrette mix that I used.  I made nine large fritters out of this.  Next time I may add a little curry to the mix.

I wanted to use up some cauliflower and this worked really well. For anyone looking for an alternative to the Italian dressing mix, I used Seasoned Salt and grated parmesan cheese in my mix and thought it was pretty tasty. I'm sure you can use any variety of spices that you enjoy, it's a pretty forgiving and versatile base.

Absolutely yummy! I made some changes in the cauliflower prep. I had baked a whole cauliflower from the night before and had lots of leftovers. I cut off the florets from the stalk. I mashed them with a potato masher which left some chunkiness to the mix. The rest I followed to the tee. Crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. Next time I will try broccoli with cauliflower.

great recipe, I make all kind of fritters and of cauliflower too, but usually cook it first and mash it. this is a great idea and a shortcut to use the food processor. 
I used one big head of cauliflower with the same amount of the other ingredients and it came out great. only con is to stand and fry a big amount. 
even my picky veggie eater like these fritters. Thanks for the recipe

This recipe was a great idea for leftover steamed cauliflower.  I added fresh kale (gave it a great green color and will remake this for St. Patrick's Day) a few scallions and my seasonings consisted of salt, pepper, cayenne and crush red pepper flakes.  Fabulous flavor!  I also fried these with very little oil in a ceramic fry pan.

This was a great way to deal with some cauliflower that was going bad and had to be heavily cleaned. This was delicious! I had to tweak  ours as I had more than six cups of cauliflower, but I just added a tad more flower and two more eggs. I will definitely make this again.

These are actually very good.  Didn't have the Italian seasoning so just used kosher salt, pepper (2 tsp each) and 3 tsp garlic powder and this was to 1 smaller head of cauliflower.  I did add about 2 tbsp extra of flour as once all mixed up, it was a little soupy.  They are better with a crispy crust so cooked mine to a darker brown vs. a golden brown.  Will make again for sure!

I am giving these 3 stars just because it was way more time then the 10min showing as prep and 10min cooking... tasted fine,however, they were falling apart even though i put 4 eggs there , and took more time to cook if u didnt want them burned .... found this recipe  way too much time consuming and the finish was just okay ....  sorry but will not make again

These were super good! A little time consuming on the prep, but I also made as a side with another dish so I might be misrepresenting the time. Frying in small batches (I could fit about 7 2in diameter in my frying pan) I ended up with about 4 batches total. I fried in coconut oil as well. I didn't have salad dressing mix so I just used dried parsley, oregano, and basil, salt and pepper, and some fresh chives I had leftover. Everyone enjoyed and I would definitely make these again.

I added some banana peppers, red pepper flakes, and grated parmesan cheese (as others had suggested).  My husband really liked it and he isn't a big fan of cauliflower.  I plan to make it exactly the same again.

These were as easy as proclaimed and as delicious. I did mess with the recipe a bit in that I added some locatelli cheese and chopped scallions. They were perfect- hot, warm or cold!

These are a hit at potlucks!  I use one whole head of cauliflower, not sure how many cups that is but I kept the other ingredients the same.  I never have dry italian dressing so I use Lipton onion soup mix (dry) and it turns out REALLY good.  I always have to add extra flour as the mix can be a bit wet.

I had some leftover cauliflower and decided to try this recipe. It was surprisingly very tastey and my husband loved them, too! I used a dry onion soup mix since I didn't have the dressing..very good substitution! Next time, I think I will try to bake them for a little healthier version.

Didn't enjoy these at all, sorry. I am not a picky eater at all, so I'm very surprised that I feel this way about it. :(    I was so hoping for a new dish.

This was very easy to make and great tasting.  My daughter who not like cauliflower loves this. Great with buffalo sauce on the side.
