Mashed potatoes are classic comfort food and while most every cook has their own "take" or "secret" to making them extra special there's no disputing the basic formula which is what this recipe gives you: potatoes, butter, and milk in it's own proportions. I generally use more butter and more warm milk. I also  add in some salt and pepper along with a bit of garlic powder. I always use an electric mixer to "mash" my potatoes whether its my kitchen aid stand mixer for large batches or my hand held for small batches. The potatoes come out perfectly "whipped" everytime!

I have always used an electric mixer to "mash" my potatoes so I agree it's an excellent tip.  Another little tip is to heat your milk in the microwave before adding it to the potatoes.  If you add cold milk it sort of cools off your potatoes, and hot potatoes are better! For some reason it also makes them creamier AND taste better. TRY IT!!

Mmmm, just like Mom used to make!  I used 5 Tbs of butter, and skim milk, because that's all I had.  After straining the water out, I put the taters in the hot pot back on the burner, on low, and let the excess water steam away for a minute.  Emeril suggests this for avoiding goopy or runny taters.  I used a hand electric mixer right in the pot, just like Mom.  (Make sure your nonstick can handle it--mine can, Cooks Essentials is tough.)  Use a low speed to avoid overbeating.  Add milk gradually until you get the consistency you want.  I like mine thicker, with a few little pieces to letcha know they're REAL.  If you like a more perfectly whipped version, a stand mixer would work better.  Just keep an eye on it so you stop it at the right time.  Do NOT substitute a food processor--wrong tool for the job.  You'll get a glutinous glob.  If you use a stand mixer, preheat the bowl in hot water to keep your taters hot.  Good idea to warm up your serving bowl, too, if you're using one.  In addition to the add-ins other reviewers have mentioned, try whipping in sour cream, or fold in grated cheese, crumbled crisp bacon, sprinkle chives on it, or anything you top taters with.  I like just fresh ground salt, pepper, and butter.  Good quality taters have a wonderful taste without needing to be hidden behind strong flavors.  And, don't let highly seasoned spuds upstage your main dish.  Thanks, Sandra, for the recipe/prep tips!

Yes, the use of the electric mixer is a great tip, but the recipe in and of itself is a little more bland than I prefer.  Not a bad start, but I used heavy cream instead of milk (adding a little at a time to reach the desired consistency), more butter, and my "secret" mashed potato ingredient -- just a tiny pinch of nutmeg, as well as salt and pepper.  Garlic, black olive, onion, cooked carrot or spinach, wasabi powder, or shredded cheese, are nice variations on the mashed potato recipe, too.  This is a versatile base. Use your imagination and add what you like.

Also, sometimes I scrub the potatoes well and leave the skins on.  It makes for a less-smooth texture but adds nutrients.  Adding a little dry milk powder will also enrich your mashed potatoes.

I didn't know you could make mashed potatoes without whipping them! Whipping is definitely what makes them creamy -especially if you add cream to the batter! If you want them to be extra fluffy as well, place your bowl of mashed potatoes, covered, over a simmering saucepan of water for 10-15 mn. In addition to keeping them warm, the texture will be fantastic! Don't forget to add salt and pepper -and a grating of nutmeg if you like.

I have always used my mixer to mash potatoes.  They do make them much fluffier.  Thanks to the review that suggested heating the milk.  This worked so much better and my potatoes stayed warm longer.

The technique is correct, but what will really make your potatoes decadent is to use cream instead of milk. Not necessarily the most health conscious method, but it will make your meal better.

Try using whipping cream instead of milk and a potato ricer and then use your electric mixer for the fluffiest mashed potatoes you have ever tasted...

Like others- I have whipped the taters for ages BUT tonight I used heated evaporated milk (thanks for the tip!) and they - regardless if its mind over matter - do seem to taste much creamier- and stay warmer longer! Went great w/ our roast beef dinner!  Thanks!

This is always how I make mashed potatoes and I never have leftovers.  Another add-in that I sometimes use is a packet of dry Ranch dressing mix.  I also like to leave the skins on the potatoes for a little extra flavor and all the good vitamins.

it is best to heat the liquid (milk/cream) and add to potatoes before mixing. do not add butter at this time. wait until you have your potatos mashed and add  your butter last. you don't want the butter absorbing into the potatoes prior to mixing--it will change texture and taste.

This is the way my mom taught me to mash potatoes pver 40 years ago.    However, it was butter to taste, add milk slowly to the consistency you want, plus some salt.    Lately, to make them more 'diet' friendly, I'll use fat free sour cream instead of the butter and skim milk.

I make my mashed potatoes like my mom always did.  After cooking till soft, drain and save a cup of liquid.  Mash with masher, add butter and seasonings and whip with electric mixer.  Alternately add a 5 oz can evaporated milk along with some of the saved cooking liquid (about 1/2 cup or more) till desired consistency.  Adding the cooking liquid and the room temp evap milk keeps the potatoes hot for serving and they turn out very creamy.  Always a hit with family and guests.

A good basic mashed potato recipe. I liked them whipped as a change for us. I used salted real butter and just added the milk to the right consistency. After I tried them I added salt, pepper and garlic and that seemed to give them what they were needing.

Adding a teaspoon of baking powder while whipping will make them light and airy. Don't overdo the mixer after addition as you can knock the air back out of them.

Great starting place if you've NEVER made mashed potatoes.  But please, add some seasonings!  At the very least some S&P and Garlic Powder.

I always use this method with additional creams, butter and/or cheese.   But...have any of you ever used a "potato ricer?"  Try it...yummy texture.

Great easy recipe for first timers. I agree with the evaporated milk review.You can always have it available in the cupboard and it gives them a nice creamy texture. My hubby doesn't want me to make them without it. :0)

The most thing to know is that potatoes are like pasta. You should always generously salt the water you cook them in. Everything else about this recipe I thought was pretty standard.

THIS IS THE WAY I ALWAYS MAKE MY MASHED POTATOES. I HAVE TO, I HAVE A VERY PICKY HUSBAND, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO "HIS" MASHED POTATOES. JUST ONE THING , USE EITHER YUKON GOLD OR RUSSET POTATOES, IF YOU WANT THEM TO COME OUT GOOD.

These potatoes were delicious and easy to make. I did have to use a lot more milk then called for because they were pretty dry. They are also very simple, so I added a lot of garlic. That made them very delicious. I used them for thanksgiving!

I have used this recipe, modified a bit with the use of evaporated milk rather than just milk and it adds to the whipped effect and taste.  Excellent recipe and very simple to make.

It was easy to make and it was so good. My daughter and I, we made some for the family get-together... and we added a little more extra butter. It was so good. That was one of the dish that went first, even though it was only mash potatoes. Thanks for submitting the recipe!

I as well have always used an electric mixer, which makes the potatoes perfect.  Just wanted to add, that you can use less milk and butter as normal if you try adding ranch dressing in the potatoes, with a dash of salt and pepper.  PERFECT.  My kids love them and always ask for seconds.

I have been cooking for 35 years and didn't know the secret to awesome mashed potatoes is to whip them.  I just add milk, butter, and salt to taste depending on how many potatoes I am making.  Mash and then whip.  What a difference.  I can't make mashed potatoes any other way now.  Thank you.

I really thought these potatoes were a great basic recipe that can be easily tweaked to taste. I followed some of the reveiwer's tips and added salt to the boiling water and put the potatoes back on the burner after they were drained and then I added warm milk and a little bit of cream.

My husband could eat his weight in mashed potatoes.  I do salt the potatoes while they are cooking.  I use an electric mixer for the entire process.  I have nevered used a potato masher.  I also use a little more milk about 1/4 cup.  Very good!

This is my standard mashed potatoes recipe. I , however, never add butter to mine...just warmed milk. I feel the consistency is much nicer, and people can add their own butter ( or butter substitute) to taste! I do add a little salt to the water when I boil them.

Good simple mashed potatoes. We made these for Thanksgiving to have a somewhat healthier version for my dad who has just gone on a heart healthy diet, so we used a little less margerine. They were a little bland, but that was what we wanted in order to keep them somewhat healthy -- the tasty stuff is usually the "bad" stuff. They had great texture.

This is the method I have always used and it makes amazing mashed potatoes!  Make sure not to "overwhip" with the mixer as they can become a bit gummy.  I add salt and other seasonings to taste.  I have also used chicken broth and reduced fat butters to make a lighter version...always very tasty!

Using an electric mixer does make creamier mashed potatoes. For more flavor try adding salt, pepper and garlic powder before boiling the potatoes. The seasonings cook into the potatoes before mashing.

this is the only way - is to  whip,  however I also add cream cheese and sour cream to taste.  This also re-heats well in the oven so this dish can be made a day ahead.  Larry Jan21, 2011

The texture of the potatoes was very smooth...I ended up adding some extra seasonings, otherwise I think these potatoes would have been rather plain.

very good mashed potatoes, but the recipe suggests cooking them for ten minutes or until easily pierced with a fork; I found I had to cook them for a good half hour on medium heat for them to taste the best and be easily mashed without being way too overcooked. great mash though, I really enjoyed them :)

Wow I had never considered electrically whipping mashed potato before, I always used to spend ages trying to get them as smooth as possible with a good old fashioned hand masher - what an excellent idea - I used a little more milk than you suggested and a tablespoon  less butter and I put in on a very low heat in the pan whilst I used a hand blending stick - they made an excellent topping for my very english cottage pie with a little grated cheese - thanks for sharing this.

I have found if you put some dried thyme and minced fresh garlic and fresh minced onion in the cooking water, drain and use warmed cream and butter you don't need any gravy and i'm irish...and i love gravy!!  Enjoy

Good basic recipe to start with, I add 2-3 tbsp. more butter 1/4 to 1/2 cup of fat free milk and season it well with salt & pepper. My family wouldn't have it any other way.

These taste like the way my mother made them. I could never get the milk & butter proportions right and now I know. Thanks for posting this recipe.

Growing up, this is how I was taught to make mashed potatoes.  I always add plenty of salt and pepper and more milk than this recipe, but this is a good base recipe.

It's good even if you don't mix it with the electric mixer.

And I added more butter and milk so it tastes creamier.

This was my first time making mash potatoes that didn't come from a box. I think I've been spoiled by the boxed flavors because I thought these were bland. I added buttermilk, chives, salt, two kinds of pepper, and onion powder, but it wasn't until I put garlic salt on that I was pleased (I think all that other stuff wasn't necessary. So if you're looking to add some flavor to this I recommend the garlic salt. Plus, I just couldn't seem to get all the potato chunks to mash. Oh well!

These came out very good!  I didn't have a potato peeler so I had them skin on but I think I like the skins better!  Very good, thank you.

This was my first year cooking for Thanksgiving and I was very nervous. These potatoes were very easy to make and they came out great. Everybody raved about these creamy potatoes. Thank you Sandra, I will use this recipe forever.
