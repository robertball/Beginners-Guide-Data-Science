Not good...at all. The gravy just doesn't work with this. It would have been much better if I would have just drizzled the pasta, sausage and veggies with olive oil and then a sprinkling of parm cheese. The gravy is just icky with it! My 7 year old said she would give it 1/2 star. Sorry!

I thought this recipe was pretty good..I was trying to find one similiar to my grandma's, who passed away..I substituted the gravy for cream of mushroom soup, & I think next time I may use spicy italian sausage to give it a little more of a kick.
