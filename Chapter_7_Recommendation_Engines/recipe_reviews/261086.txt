This is a good recipe. I started out as written but could tell from the look of the seasoned flour that I was going to want more spice. I ended up doubling all of the seasoning and this was perfect for us. I recommend putting your seasoned flour in a 1 gallon ziplock bag instead of a bowl. It makes breading so much easier to do. Just drop a few pieces of chicken in, zip, and shake. It's also less messy that way and there is no bowl to clean.
