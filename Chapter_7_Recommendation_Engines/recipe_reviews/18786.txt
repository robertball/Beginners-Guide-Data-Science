Terrrrific!  Easy to make, tastes great.  Took the advice of previous reviewers by adding onion and garlic.  I substituted with low fat cheese and sour cream and our favorite spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce.  To avoid the dryness others mentioned, I tripled the amount of sauce to 24 oz and mixed the noodles with the meat/sauce before layering.  Will make this again!

Good basic recipe but does need tweeking, with a few adjustments my husband loves it. Double the tomato sauce, add some salt and lots of pepper, saute some onion, peppers, and garlic with the ground turkey - so much better. I usually make it low fat by using low fat cream cheese, fat free sour cream, and fat free or low fat cheese, also ground turkey breast instead of regular ground turkey. Still delicious low fat ... really!

This dish is DE-LISH!!!  My 8-year olds are very picky eaters but they asked for seconds!  (Now that's a first).  I did take the reccommendations of other reviewers and mixed the noodles with the meat and used seasoned chopped tomatos instead of plain tomato sauce.  I also seasoned the meat by adding pepper, garlic salt, oregano, cilantro, onions, and garlic.  I also added frozen peas to add veggies to this quick, one-dish meal.  My husband thought it was lasagna.  I EVEN GOT A THUMBS UP FROM MY MOTHER-IN-LAW!!!  I will definitely make this dish again.  I can see this dish becoming a family favorite in my household.

*******Use a jar of salsa***** instead of tomato sauce & mexican cheese instead of cheddar & you will be making this once a week! You do not need the entire 12oz bag of egg noodles, I use about 8 oz. Hubby & toddler LOVED this. Couldn't ask for a quicker delicous meal. MMM, MMM, MMM...THANK YOU!!!

very very dry even w/ the addition of 1/2 a can chopped tomatoes w/ juice - but this recipe does have potential w/ modifications. I would TRIPLE the tomatoe sauce if I made this again. I also would definitely recommend adding spices to the meat as it's cooking and some oregano when the sauce is added or this dish would be pretty bland, even w/ the sour cream and cream cheese. I used lowfat sour cream and nuefchatel (lowfat) cream cheese, which seemed to work fine for that layer, but DON'T use lowfat or fat free cheese on top, it just doesn't have the melting power and richness needed for a recipe like this (learned the hard way).

I used "lite" ingredients.  Still tasted good.  Rich and filling.  Will make again but I will add more sauce or maybe a can of tomatoes.  I thought it was a little dry.

I found this recipe to be very bland. Pehaps some onions or garlic might spice it up a bit or even spiced tomato sauce.

The recipe was VERY good.  My husband loved it.  I did add a can of stewed tomatoes and chopped onions to the turkey after it browned.  I wouldn't change anything else.  This is a must for a pot luck or company.

Out Blinkin Standing...with a few of my infamous modifications.  Use your imagination.  I added milk instead of water, fat free sour cream, a little curry and red pepper flakes for those that suggested it was a bit bland.  I used a bunch of onion and garlic in the stir fry with the 1+ pound of lean ground turkey. Also added some 2% sharp cheddar and some Trader Joes New Zeeland goat fed sharp cheddar and a coup of microwaved frozen green peas.  My POC (pasta of choice) was whole wheat rotini...about 16 oz's. Hamburger helper would be lucky to associate itself with this. Don't forget the diced Shitake mushrooms I added to the stir fry.  See my other reviews to get an idea how to alter recipes to fit your tastes...flexibility to fit what you have in stock is the key to many, as suggested by other reviewers. Many of my versions involve lower fat editions...with lean grd Turkey...not much else to do with this one.  Eat up dudes and dudettes.

I used ground beef instead of turkey because my family won't eat ground turkey.  I also added some onions and used cream cheese with chives & onions. Very tasty~

Other than being slightly bland, I thought it was great.  To keep the calories low, I used FF sour cream, cheddar cheese, and reduced fat cream cheese.  My son loved it!!  I'll be sure to make this again.  Thank you and God Bless!

My 4-year-old liked this recipe but everyone else hated it; too much cream cheese and sour cream gave it a weird taste. I've made similar recipes with beef that turned out great but this one was not good.

This was sooo good! I took advice and used spaghetti sauce and diced tomatoes, put TONS of spices (thyme, oregano, basil, garlic powder) in turkey (as well as some chopped onions) and also sauteed some fresh green beans and mixed it in too. (Surprised the green beans tasted as good as they did) Served it with French bread and it was a hit! We'll definitely have this again!! Thanks!

**I PROBABLY WOULD RATE THIS HIGHER IF I HAD MADE CHANGES INITIALLY LIKE MOSTLY EVERYONE ELSE WHO ENJOYED IT**

I tried following the recipe to a "T", and I have to say I was a disappointed.  If you're a meat lover, you should add more than 1lb of meat.  It definitely wasn't enough for my family.  Also it was very dry; I would definitely use more sauce.  Finally, the layering of the ingredients didn't quite work for me. It fell apart while eating it, so it became a pile of dry noodles separated from the rest of the meal.  I think it would have been better to mix the meat, sauce and noodles, and then top it with the cream cheese and sour cream.  I do think the cream cheese and sour cream mixture was good, but I will try using fat free next time.

Excellent recipe. I jazzed it up with onions, green peppers, oregano, thyme and red pepper flakes. I also used a can of crushed tomatoes in addition to the tomato sauce. Very Very Good.

I thought that this recipe was pretty good.  It was very cheesy, which I like, but I felt that it was a little dry.  I think that next time I may mix up the cream cheese/sour cream mixture with the noodles before I put it in the oven.  Also, my husband said that he would have liked some tomatoes in addition to the sauce, so I may try that next time.  I will be making this again, just with some minor changes.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used a 15 oz can of tomato sauce with diced tomatoes seasoned for using with pasta.  I mixed the turkey and noodles together as many reviews had suggested.  I am not sure I liked the sour cream/cream cheese mixture.  Next time I might mix that in with the turkey/noodle mixture too.  My family liked the recipe and it is a keeper!

This was a very good recipe! My husband absolutely loved it and we ate it for leftovers for 3 nights after that. I was a bit sceptical when I saw the ingredients, but it really was tasty.

Great recipe!  I just ate the leftovers and it tasted even better.  The only thing I would change is to mix the noodles, meat and cheese together rather than layering it.

As written, I'd give it a 2.  I made changes to bring it up but it wasn't enough to save it.  I doubled the tomato sauce but the sauce was still too cream cheese-y.  And I love cream cheese.  But it was too much.  I mixed it all together and would definitely do that if you give this recipe a shot.  I added mushrooms that I cooked in garlic and onion powder.  Also added onion powder, garlic, and Cajun seasoning to the turkey while cooking.  After it was done I had to add Worcestershire sauce just to make it less bland.  Will not make again.  I may make an adaptation to it by nixing the cream cheese and using chicken instead of turkey.  And maybe even add broccoli.  As is, I'd give it a 2 star.  And that's being generous.

We didn't like this much at all.  Not a lot of flavor.  It tastes mostly like cream cheese and sour cream!  Needed more tomato sauce and spices or something!  Wouldn't make it again.

This recipe was certainly easy, but my family found it to be a little too rich.  It would be great to serve at a potluck where you would only have a small serving along with other foods.

I followed a couple of reviews and Added the onions, and garlic, I used a 24 oz jar of spaghetti sauce and a can of tomato sauce, Short on sour cream so mixed half sour cream and half fat free Greek Yogurt with the cream cheese. Omitted the sugar and mixed the noodles, turkey, and sauces together before layering the cheeses. I served it with a great salad and it was absolutely delicious!!! My husband just served himself 3rds.  ;)

wellllll it was a small miracle that both children ate dinner tonight in my house!!  i did make some substitutions, as follows:  i used fat free plain greek yogurt instead of the sour cream, low fat cream cheese and just a little bit of fat free mozzarella cheese on top, no sugar and subbed spaghetti sauce for the tomato sauce, using about 32oz of sauce, and finally i used penne instead of egg noodles.  with the modifications i made to help out the fat and caloirie content i felt pretty good about serving this instead of something like a baked ziti, which is much higher in fat.  overall i think it tasted quite good!  a nice change from regular spaghetti.  thanks!

I think this recipe would have been bland without additional seasoning added, so I followed the advice from other reviews and it turned out great.  I added 1/2 chopped bell pepper and 1/2 chopped onion with the ground turkey. Then I added 1 t. each garlic salt and dried basil, 1/2 t. black pepper and 1/4 t. cayenne pepper, a 14.5-oz can diced tomatoes & green chilis (drained) and a couple handfuls of fresh spinach leaves with the tomato sauce. I mixed the ground turkey mixture with the cooked pasta and layered 1/2 of the pasta mix, 1/2 of the cream cheese mix, remaining pasta, remaining cream cheese then topped the whole thing with shredded cheese. Will definitely make this again. It's quick and easy and uses ingredients I usually have on hand.

I read through the reviews before making this for the first time. Like several others suggested, I sauteed two cloves of garlic and a small, finely chopped onion with the turkey. Next time, I will skip this recommendation. It added little to the flavor, but added quite a bit to the prep time. In fact, prep time was my biggest issue with this dish. Making it managed to dirty an unholy number of dishes: one for the pasta, one for the turkey, one for the dairy, and then the baking dish. It also took me about 45 minutes before it even hit the oven. I'm not the fastest cook, but I'm not the slowest, either. The main sucker of my time was combining the cream cheese and sour cream. Big mistake on my part on not letting the cream cheese sit out for *several* hours first. One change I will keep is using a jar of spaghetti sauce instead of a smaller can of plain tomato sauce. Even with the extra sauce, this casserole ran on the dry side, so increasing the liquid is a no-brainer. I left out the sugar, as any prepared spaghetti sauce will already have the right amount in it. To make it healthier, I used light sour cream and lighter cream cheese. I used less than the full 2 cups of cheddar. I don't think the taste suffered with these lighter changes. My family enjoyed eating this. I will make it again.

This is a good, basic casserole. I followed the lead of many of the reviewers and added some onion, garlic, basil, and oregano when cooking the turkey. I added a can of diced tomatoes and I also mixed everything together except for the cheese on top when cooking the casserole. I didn't have egg noodles so I used rotini. It's good, nothing too fancy and everyone enjoyed it.

This was really easy to make, and delicious too!  After reading some of the reviews, I did add a small onion, and one clove of minced garlic to the ground turkey.  I also used different noodles!  It makes a lot, and freezes great!  Enjoy!

This tasted OK, but was bland.  I mixed the tomato sauce up into the noodles, and with every bite tried to get a mix of the cheese and noodles.  It gets points, however, because the kids and husband ate it without complaints.

I did this a little differently.  I used crushed tomatoes and a can of Ro-Tel tomatoes with green chilis. I added shallots and a bit of jalapeno to the turkey and crushed corn chips to the top.  It was a little bland but a good comfort food.  I think that, if I make it again, I will mix the noodles in with the meat mixture because I ended up the a bunch of wet noodles with no sauce.

I made so many changes to this recipe that made it delicious. First I used bow tie pasta and spread it on the bottom. I fried green onion and yellow pepper and put that next. Then I put the turkey mixture which I used just spaghetti sauce with,then the sour cream mixture but I added ricotta cheese to it. Then topped it with cheddar cheese.

I thought this was a very good dish--great comfort food! I used ground chicken because it was on sale and also used lite sour cream, cream cheese, and chedder (not fat-free!). I would suggest softening the cream cheese first in the microwave before mixing with the sour cream. Husband liked it too (although he added hot sauce!). Thanks!!!

A good basic recipe, but I would not make it again as is.... too high in calories.  I cut out the cream cheese and cheddar cheese entirely.  I put noodles in the bottom of the pan, then just made one layer with tomato sauce, ff sour cream, chopped zucchini, spinach, ground turkey, etc.  When the casserole was done cooking, I sprinkled with parmesan.  Delicious, healthier, and lower-cal!

I thought this was going to be a so-so recipe and to my surprise it was great weeknight dish. I will make it again for sure! I included 1 can of diced tomatoes flavored with Italian seasonings. I also added fresh ground pepper to the meat mixture. Next time I would add ground pepper to the sour cream misture.

This is an excellent recipe for a starting point. I think you really have to tweak it, but if you do it turns out DELICIOUS! I took other reviewers suggestions; sauteed onions & garlic in olive oil, then added meat. I also added Italian seasoning, onion powder, paprika and a dash of worchestershire sauce to the turkey while browning. I then used tomato sauce and diced tomatoes. Added frozen peas as one reviewer suggested. It came out wonderful and my husband was so impressed! Tastes great served with crescent rolls and some iced tea.

This recipe deserves more than five stars after all of the tweeking from previous posters. I read every review and took the advice to increase the meat, add sauted onion and garlic to teh meat, add my own spaghetti sauce, mix the sauce with the noodles (I used farfalle) and add 1/2 cup milk to the sour cream and cheese mixture.I used over 2 pounds of meat and one box of noodles, 8 oz cream cheese, 12 oz sour cream, 1/2 cup whole milk, 1 onion, a couple of cloves garlic, about 3 cups tomatoes and maybe 3 cups sauce. 3 or 4 cups mexican cheese on the top. This made an oversized 13 x 9 casserole and served a lot of hungry Halloween ghosts and goblins.  My family argued who was going to get teh little bit of leftovers for lunch the following day.

This was a wonderful recipe.  Thank you. I used only half of the sour cream, which was plenty, and 4 oz. fat free cream cheese, 4 oz. low fat cottage cheese, and I used 1/3 cup cooked orzo and mixed it in with the cream cheese mixture and placed that on the bottom of pan.  I also used half of the tomato sauce and replaced the other half with spaghetti sauce.  To add a little more taste, I added onion and garlic while cooking the turkey and oregano, basil, salt and pepper to the tomato sauce.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

I agree with another of the reviews I read on this meal (and wish I had read beforehand!) in that the sour cream & cream cheese mixture was VERY overwhelming and it even curdled a bit so it also had a weird texture. I added a lot of things to spice up the flavor but again, at best it was only ok. We ended up throwing most of it out. I think it might have been better with an actual marinara or spaghetti sauce instead of just tomato and much MUCH less of the sour cream mixture or less of something anyway.

This was pretty good. I added onions, garlic, salt, pepper and Italian seasoning to the turkey per others suggestions.  Make sure your cream cheese has softened or it will be chunky.

I made this for dinner and I made a lot of revisions to it. After reading everyone elses review I prepared for my changes.  I used an additional half a jar of spagheti sauce. I used 1/2 of a medium white onion.  I seasoned with salt, pepper, basil, garlic salt. I cut back on the amount of noodles.  I used enough to amply cover the bottom of the pan. I mixed everything together except the sour cream and cream cheese (I mixed them together and set aside to apply once everything else was in the pan) I also combined different cheese on top.  It was great.  Its very filling and dangerous on the calorie side, and its great with a vegetable or salad. It didn't take to much longer with my revisions.

With a few additions this was a great recipe.  My husband loved it.  Here are the changes:  Add a can of diced tomatoes to the turkey/tomato sauce.  Also spices are a must:  garlic powder, onion powder, basil, oregano, and italian seasoning.  I also would suggest a little less noodles - I used the 8 oz pkg instead of the 12 oz pkg.  Even with these additions, this was a fairly quick and easy recipe.

I loved this!  I did make a few changes...I used ground venison sausage, so no complaints about the meat being bland.  I used a large jar of spaghetti sauce, as opposed to plain tomato sauce.  I also mixed the noodles in with the meat and sauce.  My husband and I both really enjoyed this and we are looking forward to the leftovers tonight since many previous reviewers claim it tastes better the next day!  Thanks for the easy and different recipe.

This was a good recipe.  I followed others suggestions.  I used yogurt verse sour cream, "no yolk" egg noodle and a 26 oz jar of spaghetti sauce and mixed the noodles with the sauce and turkey.  We all agreed it was rich and could have used 1/2 of the cream cheese or maybe replace the cream cheese with ricotta cheese. Makes alot!

This recipe was wonderful!  My husband loved it and he is not a poultry or past eater at all.  I usually have to force it on him.  My four kids (one of whom will never eat anything) ate it up in minutes and kept saying between bites how good it was.  I did doctor it up a little by using italian seasoning, garlic and canned tomatos.  But I also used no egg yolk noodles and low fat sour cream, cream cheese and cheddar cheese and you couldn't even tell it was low fat.  Will definitely make again.

Made as it's written...it's a good base casserole. However, I made the turkey with a package of taco seasoning, which really boosted the flavor. I doubled the amount of tomato sauce (I will triple it next time) and added a can of petite diced tomatoes with jalepanos for additional flavor. With these additions, this recipe is 5 stars :)  Enjoy!

I had to add onion and peppers to give it some taste. Also some Worcestershire and paprika. Layered noodles, then sour cream/cream cheese, meat layer and then cheese. Kinda messy but it tasted good.

My 5 year old loved this! And my husband did too. He said it was even good enough to provide to a church familiy in need of a meal.  My changes:  I added 24 oz of speg. sauce with mushrooms and mixed that with the meat after browning. Then i mixed in the noodles after cooking them.  I also added garlic and onions when browning the meat.  (my husband thought more garlic would make it even better)  I added Italian seasonings to give this some extra flavor.  I used whole wheat rotini noodles rather than egg noodles.   I omitted the sugar.   I put one layer of noodles/sauce/turkey in the baking dish. Spread just under half the cream cheese/sour cream mix on top and sprinkled 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese. Then added another layer of the noodle/meat mix. I put the remaining cream cheese/sour cream mix on top and covered with another 1 1/2 cups mozz. cheese.   Definitely would have been even better with a salad and bread on the side for a complete Italian meal. YUM!!!

We all liked the taste of this casserole but it was just a little heavy for us.  I made just a few changes.  I cooked my meat with garlic, onion, oregano and basil as some others had suggested and I added one 8oz can of tomato sauce and a small can of V8 juice.  I made sure to undercook my noodles just a bit so they'd absorb the tomato flavor.  I also mixed the cream cheese/sour cream mixture right into my noodles which made layering simple.

Overall this was a good recipe. I did add a 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes along with the sauce as called for. I also added some of my own seasonings. I will make this again only I will add some more sauce just because I didn't think there was enough. It was a quick and easy meal. Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good, but I tweaked it so much I dont think it wouldve been so good as written. I browned 1/2 an onion and some garlic before I browned the meat.  I also added some basil, oregano, salt, blk pepper and crushed red pepper to the tomato sauce.  I mixed equal parts cream cheese and lowfat yogurt and used macaroni noodles (cause its what I had). I halved the recipe for an 8x8. It was plentiful and delicious! Serve w/ a big green salad to offset this heavy casserole. :)

My sister frowned at the thought of ground turkey, but this was a hit! I used elbow pasta (1/2 box), seasoned the meat with onion powder, italian seasoning, garlic powder, and seasoned salt & pepper, and used a whole container of Prego pasta sauce. With the other ingredients, it turned out beautifully. This is a must add to my menu!

I added some garlic, onion powder, salt and pepper to this turkey mixture.  I also used half a can of tomato sauce and an entire 15 oz. can of diced tomatoes. My husband loved this dish.  He had two or three heaping plates of it!!  This was very good and I am sure that I'll be making it again!

Very Tasty.  I Added some sauteed green pepper and onion, omitted the sugar, It seemed like it needed some more flavor so I also added some garlic, red pepper, little sage, and some mixed allpurpose spice mix-really helped.

This is 4 stars w/the changes I made. I had a package of ground turkey to use up and found this recipe. I added a small onion and 4 garlic cloves to the turkey while browning. Also I couldn't imagine not using any spices, so I added garlic powder, italian seasoning, basil, S&P. When the noodles and turkey were cooked I mixed them together instead of layering. Also, my cream cheese was not quite soft enough and wouldn't blend enough w/the sour cream so I just mixed it all together w/the noodle mixture. This helped melt it a lot better. I also topped w/ about 1 1/2 cups shredded mozzerella, was too italian sounding to me for cheddar. After these changes I would definately make this again. Also, my hubby doesn't like cream cheese or sour cream but b/c I mixed it all together I somehow snuck it by him, that's a reason to make it again right there:)

This was great!!  I, like others, did adjust the recipe, using only half of the cream cheese and sour cream suggested, and it was perfect...I can't imagine it with the full amount.  I also used 1 can diced italian seasoned tomatoes, 1 small can tomato paste and 1 can of tomato sauce, and I think it came out perfect...not runny, just yummy and easy!  Definitly will make again!

Very Very very yummy!!!  I did do as others had recommended and mixed the noodles in with the sauce mixture.  I also used a jar of plan spaghetti sauce.  The leftovers were even better than the casserole the first night!!  Great recipe and will definitely be making again!

I liked that it was quick and easy to make. However, I suggest to add some seasoning to it. I found that it to be a bit bland tasting. I simply added some oregano, garlic and other spices to the tomato sauce. I thought it tasted much better the second time around.

This was a good recipe but the it would have been better if the meat were seasoned a little. I would recommend adding a little seasoning to your turkey for flavor, so that you are not depending on the cheese so much for flavor.

Yuck.  I added an extra can of sauce and some garlic and onion to the ground turkey.  If you like the taste of stroganoff, you may like this.  It was very rich even though I used low fat cream cheese and low fat sour cream.  It made a HUGE casserole, enough for 12 people.  My one kid liked it, the other hated it.

This was very tasty, but I did add fresh garlic, onion, stewed tomatoes, corn and a bunch of Italian seasonings to the turkey. Also, I got it down to about 11g fat per serving by using "NO YOLK" egg noodles, and all reduced fat cheeses. 

A great hearty winter meal!

This recipe would have been too bland if I hadn't added onion powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper.  I used the amount of tomato sauce and ground turkey stated in the recipe but it could have taken a bit more of each.  We found the combination of sour cream and cream cheese a bit much, and next time I will omit the cream cheese.  That said, my husband still volunteered (always a good sign when I don't have to ask!) that it was excellent, and I will try it again.

Not a good choice in my opinion. It reminded me of hamburger helper in a way. Sounded much better than it tasted. My 2 yr old and 9 month old lived it which is how I could even rate it  2 stars. Maybe some veggies, less sour cream and cream cheese would give it a fresher, healthier feel to it.

This was fantastic! The only thing I did differently was that I mixed everything but the cheese together and topped with cheese before baking. Both my husband and I really enjoyed it, which is saying a lot since we never agree on new recipes!

Excellent! A very yummy comfort food! I followed others suggestions and sauted onions and garlic with the turkey and also then mixed it in with my favorite green bell pepper and mushroom pasta sauce. I also used fat free sour cream and reduced fat cheese....came out soooo good. Will definitely keep this in my recipe book!

This was good.  I made a few changes.  I eliminated the sugar.  I cooked onions and green peppers with the ground turkey and seasoned to taste with garlic salt, season salt, black pepper and cayenne pepper.  I took the advise of some of the other reviewers and made more that the one layer.

This was quick and easy.  I did take advice of other reviewers and added onion, garlic, but I added a can of diced tomatoes.  To make it more healthy I used low-fat sour cream, cheese and wheat rotini noodles.  All I can say is yummy!

AMAZING!!!!    My whole family LOVED this casserole!   As stated in the other ratings about it being too dry, I used a 15 oz can of tomato sauce and a can of diced tomatoes. It turned out super creamy and delicious.  Would recommend seasoning it while meat is cooking. maybe onions, garlic, salt and pepper. We all had seconds!

Considering the suggestions made by others, I added a little onion powder, garlic powder, and oregano to the turkey while cooking it.  I also used a 24oz can of sauce and mixed it with the meat and noodles before cooking.  Results:  Wonderful!  My husband said it was really good, but maybe a little less sour cream so I think I'll only use half next time.  Thanks for the great and easy recipe.

This was really, really awful. A waste of ingredients. I warmed up the cream cheese in the microwave so it would be very soft & mix well with the sour cream and still, it really tasted like turkey & noodles with globs of cream cheese.

Add some spices while you're cooking your turkey and you're set!  Everything else in this recipe makes for a wonderful, easy casserole.  My husband and I loved it and I'll be making it again.  Thanks for sharing!

Ths recipe was quick and easy and great when you need to use those extra ingredients in your fridge when you dont want to throw stuff away. Like other users I added the onion, green pepper, seasoning salt to the turkey. I sauteed my onions and pepper in olive oil. I added a little butter and pepper to the egg noodles. I cut back on the cream cheese and sour cream, just a little, I used spaghetti sauce, any flavor, and added a half of jar of salsa. My daughter said she would make this at school. It was delicious and leftovers were even better. Thanx !!

Very yummy - hubby had thirds!  I added more sauce and mixed the noodles with the meat sauce before layering cheeses. Next time I will mix cream cheese/sour cream mix into the meat/noodle mixture so the cheesy flavor is throughout.  Tonight we had to mix up our serving to get the cheese flavor- no big deal.  Melted the cheddar on time as recipe stated and that was fine.  Will make this again w/ minor changes.

The first time I made this I used turkey and the family snarfed it up, just loved it!  I, however, don't like ground turkey so am making it tonight with ground beef instead.  I added garlic, pepper and Emeril's Italian Essence to help kick it up a notch :)  This is definately a basic recipe that you can create your own way, go for it!  It gets 5 *'s cuz hubby and kids request that I make this once a week!

This recipe is simmlar to something I have done for years.  The cream cheese was a new twist I thought I would try.  I did however add some garlic, onion powder and oregano to the meat along with some frozen corn and a couple of small cans of mushrooms.  

It turned out wonderfully.

This one was a hit with my family... and easy too!  I made a few adjustments (but I do that with every recipe - I can't help myself). I used 1-15oz can of diced tomatoes w/juice along with 2-8oz.of plain sauce and 1/2 jar approx. 14oz. of "traditional" flavored sauce because I was concerned it would be too dry - I'm glad I did because it was perfect! I also mixed the noodles into the sauce mixture... Great flavor - I added a pinch of pepper flakes (but I add that too any/all tomato based sauces.) This will be a mainstay in our family.

This was really, really good. Even my 2 year old likes it! I had to make some adjustments, though:


2lbs ground turkey
1 jar of Barilla tomato basil spaghetti sauce (I only used 3/4 of it)
1 teaspoon brown sugar 
12oz bowtie pasta
8oz cream cheese
8oz sour cream
1/2 cup 2% milk (some of the reviews said to add it to the sour cream/cream cheese)
2 cups shredded cheddar cheese

I seasoned the turkey with garlic salt, seasoned salt, and paprika. I also layered it differently. I mixed the pasta with the sour cream/cream cheese/milk mixture and put that on the bottom, then the turkey, then the cheese. It kind of tastes like lasangna. Its something you could make ahead of time and just pop it in the oven when you are ready to eat.

I had never eaten let alone cooked anything involving ground turkey before and I can honestly say I did enjoy it. I split the layers in half so it went Noodles, meat sauce, cream, meat sauce, cream, and then the cheese on top. Also add some other spices to it like garlic salt or some italian seasoning to take away the sometimes considered blandness it could have. . .

After adding in a can of diced tomatoes, using enriched garden rotini (only 2 cups worth), and mixing all the ingredients up in a bowl before pouring into the pan, it was wonderful!!!

I used a can of spagetti sauce and browned the turkey with S&P, an onion and garlic powder. I used 6oz of sour cream and it was just fine. Made plenty of leftovers.

This recipe was easy, but the sour cream/cream cheese mixture just overtook the other flavors; or they just didn't meld together all that well.  I added some garlic salt and pepper along with chopped onion to the turkey while cooking, and added extra tomato sauce, and less cheese mixture, and it still was just OK at best.  It was a good way to use a lot of the things I had in my fridge, though!

My family loved this recipe.  I added a 14oz jar of marinara sauce to the ground turkey and as other reviewers suggested, I mixed all the ingredents together.  I also added garlic powder, salt/pepper and basil to the ground turkey.

This is a great basic recipe and one of my mainstayes these days.  You can season it to your own preference and it's always good.  One VERY important item needs to be added, though, and that's 1/2 cup milk.  If you don't do that it's very dry and falls apart, as one reviewer said.

The tomato sauce just didn't go well with the turkey, which is strange because we love turkey spaghetti sauce at our house!  Either way, I'm willing to try anything with ground turkey at least once.

First of all I have to agree, a few extra touches helped alot on the flavor. This makes a big 9x13 dish and is quite rich. I used more than the one pound of ground turkey the recipe called for. It just didn't seem like enough for a 9x13 dish. I also added minced garlic while browning the turkey and a few sprinkles of seasoning.  My husband loved it and said it was definitely a keeper. If I make this one again, I will go with the lower fat sour cream and cream cheese to help reduce the fat content. I also agree about adding more tomato sauce so it isn't quite as dry. Very filling, quick and easy comfort food and a very happy husband. Now that's worth at "least" 4 stars!

the 5 stars is for this recipe's potential. I added tomato paste, diced tomatoes, italian seasoning, minced garlic, a little vinegar, and extra sugar. Also used sausage instead of ground turkey.  I agree that it's GREAT the 2nd day, but still very heavy/rich with the cream cheese/sour cream mixture. Next time, I will cut that part in half.  All in all, great casserole.

It was pretty good.  In my opinion, it needs at least 50% more sauce, I think next time I will use one and a half cans of tomato sauce.  I took the advice of the other reviewers and added onion powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper to the turkey while cooking.  The cheese topping was divine!  I will probably make it again, with the above stated modifications.

This was a really great recipe!  I used ground chicken instead of turkey and added onion salt, garlic salt & pepper to the chicken.  To keep it light I used light cream cheese & light sour cream.  I also substituted marinara sauce for the tomato sauce & sugar.  My family ate it up!!

This recipe is AWESOME! You do have to doctor up the ground turkey though, as suggested in previous reviews. I added chopped onion, diced tomatoes (garlic & onion seasoned), salt, pepper, garlic pwdr & onion pwdr to the ground turkey. FIVE STARS with these changes...YUMMY!

I made some of my own mods after reading a few reviews! Added some minced garlic and a package of onion soup mix to the turkey meat, as well as a bit of cayenne and paprika. Turkey being the healthy and inexpensive choice, it can be bland - so I personally season the bleep out of mine.
I did not have a big casserole dish on hand, so I had to use my 8x9, which didn't affect it imo. Kept it saucy! Although I may add another can of tomato sauce in the future.
I also mixed a bit of onion soup mix into the sour cream/cheese mixture, and mmmmmmm!!!!
Last mod was I only had shredded Mexican blend cheese - obvs delicious, any cheese you like really!
This was cheap and easy to make, I served mine with broccoli. Will make again. :)

I will give it 4 stars as is but to be fair, I made these changes and I think it is 5 star with these changes and healthier too! First,I left out the sugar (why use it, just extra calories for nothing), used 0% fat Greek yogurt in place of sour cream (I do this with everything), added sauteed garlic and onions to the turkey and a liberal sprinkle of jalapenos and reduce the cream cheese (used 1/3 fat neufchatel) to about 6 oz. it was amazing and the jalapenos give it a great boost. Also, I used rigatoni that I precooked a little firm and then heated it all in the oven till bubbly.

This was a great recipe & I will definitely be making this again! I followed the recipe to the T because I wanted to try the original version first, before adding my touch to it the next time I make it. I thought it was great as is... my 11 year old has been pretty picky lately and he loved it... Thanks for sharing.
**Just made this for the 2nd time & added italian seasoning, garlic powder, salt & pepper to the ground turkey, and it came out great! I'd say just as great without the added ingredients to the meat. Either way is fine. My son LOVES this recipe so I know I will be making this regularly**

***Made this again, and didn't have any cream cheese, but had some ricotta, so used that instead. I have now made a habit of seasoning the  meat with garlic & onion powder, salt & pepper and italian seasoning. I used (2) 15oz cans of tomato sauce and popped in the oven for 25 minutes. It tastes the same, except the cheese mixture is easier to spread vs. using cream cheese***

I would add more turkey, sauce & topping & bake a few minutes longer. Other than that, it was super easy & I didn't have any complaints from my husband or our neighbors, that we shared this with. They all loved it!

This recipe was easy and and a hit with my family.  I did have a few modifications.  While browning the turkey, I added some minced garlic and diced onion.  I also used a jar of spaghetti sauce versus the tomato sauce and sugar.  I traded the egg noodles for a box of rotini pasta and used mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar.  To make it extra cheesy, I added Parmesan cheese to the sour cream/cream cheese mixture.

We loved it! Modified just a few things because of some reviews. I used low fat cream cheese and sour cream. I also only used about 6oz of each instead of 8. I used an entire small jar of my favorite chunky spaghetti sauce, and also spiced up my meat with garlic and minced onion. Before layering the noodles I layed them in the sauce and than layed them in the pan. They came out perfect, not dry at all :)) My kids wanted seconds!!!

didn't really like the cream cheese mixture on the top. I think I would rather go with a more traditional ricotta type thing with this type of dish and layer it in the middle.  I did mix the sauce with the noodles and meat b/c otherwise the noodles would just burn on the bottom and be dry.

I cooked my meat with onion and garlic. I also seasoned with a little of Tony's Cajun seasoning and garlic salt. I mixed the noodles, sauce, and meat all together to make sure it was all moist. I used a 45 ounce jar of prego spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce and sugar. I used light sour cream and 1/3 less fat cream cheese along with reduced fat cheese. I also used wheat noodles. Still very yummy! I would suggest maybe adding some Italian herbs in as well. My husband is very picky and he liked it, so that's saying a lot!

I picked this recipe because I had all the ingredients, but not the right noodles.  Then I read comments so I sauteed onion, garlic and green pepper for the sauce (which I doubled per people comments).  I had fettuccini noodles - regular and spinach - so used both.  It was great and would do it again, but instead of doubling sauce would only do 1 1/2 times.   Can't wait for leftovers tomorrow.

Not outstanding, but great for what it is... a simple, throw together casserole.  The kids ate well.  I had trouble fully mixing the cream cheese with the sour cream, so next time I'll either heat up over the stove or try leaving the cream cheese on the counter longer.  Oh, I took the advise of many other reviewers and added extra liquid. In addition to the 15 ounces of sauce, I added a can of Italian seasoned diced tomatoes.  I also seasoned the turkey with salt, pepper, and garlic powder while browning.

Actually probably about 2 and half stars.  It isn't that this is a bad recipe, because it most certainly is not.  It is a quick, can't think of anything else to make kind of meal.  I added fresh lemon-thyme to the ground turkey.  I added red wine to the tomato sauce.  Based on previous comments, I cut the amount of cream cheese in half.  I also added paprika and hot sauce to the cream mixture.  The cream mixture made this dish.  I loved the cream mixture, especially with the tang of the spice.

Delicious! I changed it like everyone does though! Used alfredo sauce instead of tomato sauce, and then rigatoni instead of egg noodles. It was so good. Got filled up on just a couple of bites :) Enjoy!

Trying to get your toddler to eat anything is a challenge, but he loves this dish and so does my hard-to-please husband. I throw in additional tomato sauce as well as frozen spinach at times for a healthier meal. Otherwise, it's wonderful the way it is! I also took other people's tweaks and use other cheeses besides cheddar. Yum!

Good recipe. I added onions and garlic powder to the turkey while it browned and omitted the sugar. I also added a colorful fettucini as the noodle. To make it lower fat, I substituted lowfat sour cream and low fat cream cheese and cheese. Great!

I liked this recipe but I did change it up a little.  Instead of tomato paste I used a jar of spaghetti sauce.  I also cut the sour cream in half and added a little mayo since my husband doesn't really like sour cream.

Quick and good! Great weeknight throw together recipe, I have been looking for more of these. Took others suggestions and increased the tomato sauce (I used crushed tomatoes though) And seasoned the meat with a little butter and oregano....Next time I think I will add corn for a veggie.

very good, I added some italian seasoning to the meat, I made this about four times already and tried it once mixing all the ingredients instead of layering the meat on top and then the sour cream mixture and it was not the same is soooo much better if you layer it just taste better, don't ask why since the whole things ends up mix in your plate but is not the same. I loved it when I layer it. Very good recipe.

I did what several others did.  I actually used marinara sauce instead of tomato sauce.  I also used 1/2 the amount of cream cheese & sour cream.  I added a small diced onion and a diced bell pepper.  I also mixed mine up and cooked half in a 8x8 pan and froze half for later.  My husband loved it.

This was a GREAT recipe and unbelievably easy. I substituted the egg noodles with macaroni though. I also added a layer of spicy spinach (frozen chopped spinach, diced onions, garlic, cayenne pepper and creole seasoning) before placing the ground turkey on the macaroni. A definite family favorite!

Good recipe.  I used alot more tomato sauce, added zucchini, onions and garlic.  I also stirred it all together (noodles, cream cheese, sour cream, meat mixture) in the pan and then put it in the casserole dish.  I topped with cheese and only baked 15 minutes.

So after reading the ingredients, and some of the reviews i decided that this was Almost the kind of dish i was going for, but i spruced it up. Oh ya, and i rarely ever measure so I put aprox. for anyone wanting to recreate this.  so heres what i used:  1.25 package of lean ground turkey meat frozen peas (almost whole bag) can of corn celery (not sure how much) yellow sweet onion cream of mushroom soup cheddar cheese (about 2 cups) Mozzarella (sprinkled) bag of herb seasoned stuffing mix a little milk large wide egg noodles 2 cloves garlic + sprinkles of powdered garlic  basically i browned the meat with a little garlic and season all, ( i caramelized the onion and celery separate with olive oil and 2 cloves garlic) in a seperate dish, i added aprox. 8 oz of sour cream, almost 8 oz of cream cheese, some cheddar, a can of cream of mushroom soup (actually i added that later when i realized the mixture was too dry) and some corn and thawed peas. next i stirred in the meat, onions and celery. (the celery really made the dish so add lots) I didnt want the tomato sauce, or the sugar so i left that out. this was great

Used low fat everything, but I wouldn't use low fat cheddar next time. Cook the turkey with more spices to give it more flavor. It was a little bland.

This has to been one of the worst meals I have ever had. Even my boyfriend who will eat anything said "it was okay". It sat in my fridge for a week and no one touched it after we picked at it the first night. Never again....

When I started making this I forgot that I had run out of cream cheese the night before.  So I substituted low fat cream of mushroom soup and low fat velveeta cheese.  Also, as the others said I sautéed onions and garlic with the ground turkey, and topped with cheddar cheese. To add some nutrients I put peas in the cheese mixture.  My boyfriend and I loved it and will make it again and again!  Thanks for sharing!

Nothing very fancy, but tasty.  We are looking for ground turkey dishes, and this was pretty good.  I used some suggestions from the reviews--more tomato sauce and herbs and spices and less sour cream.  We'd definitely do this again!

Meh.  Despite using lean ground beef, and adding green peppers, onions and garlic, I still found this incredibly bland.  I could see how this could be a hit with kids or good for a potluck but really it's just another cheese/noodle/tomato sauce dish.   It's not bad, it's just boring.

My 8 year old daughter and I just got done making the dish for dinner tonight. It turned out delicious. We didnt have regular ground turkey but had ground turkey with taco seasoning added. WOW! It was amazing. Didnt have to add any seasonings and the whole family LOVED it!

INCREDIBLE! THANK YOU BEKI!!!! I have the pickiest eaters "in the entire universe and beyond" (as my 4 year old would say). This is a grand slam hit for not only the kids but their leader the King of Picky, aka Daddy! One change is that I found that egg noodles where too flimsy so I use a whole wheat rotini instead. I also go low-fat on the cheeses.

My son and I LOVED this recipe.  I made enough to give to another family the next day.  It froze well and baked up well.  I took the little bit that was left over to work with me and had it for lunch.  I followed the directions closely.  We substituted a few items, I used fat free sour cream and low fat cream cheese.  We also used low fat shredded cheese for the top.  Rather than sugar I used splenda.  It was wonderful and we enjoyed it. Thanks, we will definitely eat this again!!

I ran short on cream cheese, and made it w/ GF noodles, but it was still good.  I'm sure it would be great with the full amount of cream cheese.  Hubby even liked it!  Will make it again, but will mix things together next time instead of layering.

I don't know why some people aren't liking this recipe, I loved it and so did my family and company I have made it for, it is so good almost better than lasagna. You can add lots or change it to suit your tastes but sooooo good as is. Thanks for the awesome recipe

Tasty comfort food! I modified it just slightly to keep the calories/fat lower and IMO it didn't sacrifice the taste one bit! I sauteed onions, mushrooms, garlic and an orange pepper I had on hand in a  little EVOO.  I seasoned the heck out of the ground turkey (which I find quite bland).  Instead of the tomato sauce mix I used a jar of fire roasted tomato pasta sauce.  I reduced the sour cream and cream cheese mixture to 1/4 cup of each and used the light version, the final result was still very creamy.  I mixed everything together instead of doing separate layers, used just a sprinkling of cheese on top and it was delish! :)

I made this the other night and took the suggestions that a few reviewers made.  I added a half an onion, two cloves garlic, oregano and a can of stewed tomatoes as well as the tomato sauce.  I like a lot of flavor so I always add garlic & salt in the water to boil my noodles.  Low fat cream cheese, sour cream and cheese would definitely be the way to go since doing otherwise would be way too high in fat.    My family really enjoyed it and said it was a keeper and of course my rating reflects this recipe with the changes.

My husband and I loved it! The only change I made was using a jar of spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato sauce, and I also a little less sour cream. Other than that, it was PERFECT! Ive already made it 3 times!

I was really happy with the way this turned out!  Like others I did make some additions to the recipe: I added some chopped onion & grn pepper to the turkey and mixed spaghetti sauce (instead of regular tomatoe sauce) along w/a can of diced tomatoes which almost doubled the amount of sauce like others recommended.  To the cream cheese/sr cream mixture I added some chopped grn onion, italian spices, peppers, chives & a handfull of parmasian cheese.  It turned out GREAT.  My husband went back for second plate THEN went back for #3!!! I definently will make this again.  With my Husband going back twice, we still have 1/2 of it left & I can't wait for leftovers tomorrow. Thanx for your recipe.

I did not care for the hot sour cream/cream cheese combo in this recipe. I followed it exactly and ended up with an entire meal that had to be thrown away.  No one would eat it. (nor would I make them.) Sorry, i hate to leave bad reviews, but  will not even attempt to do this one again.

This was delicious and easy. I used spaghetti sauce because that's what I had, and I seasoned the turkey with onion and a little red pepper flakes and garlic powder. I used 3/4 of the cream cheese called for, and it was just right. And I added some Parmesan cheese to the top before I baked. The kids and Hubs loved this, which surprises me because they are picky eaters. It is super filling though, so you will have leftovers. I will save this recipe for sure!

I also followed the suggestions of other reviewers, I cooked the meat with onions and garlic, I substituted about 24oz of commercial spaghetti sauce for the tomato sauce.  I didn't have egg noodles, so I broke up 1/2 box of lasagna noodles and that worked fine.  My family liked it, although my husband thought it was probably too fattening (I used regular everything).  I would make this again if I find myself with extra sour cream and cream cheese again.

This recipe was ok! I used the noodles that don't require you to boil them..Big Mistake!!!! The end result is half cooked noodles..which wasn't too bad it added a little crunch ;-)
Other than that I may attempt again...maybe!

This was very good. I also followed the lead of others and put a diced onion in with the turkey while browning it.  I wasn't sure what kind of flavor it would have based on the recipe so i add a 1/4 cup of Taco seasoning into the cream cheese and sour cream mixture.  I just mixed all the ingredients together with the noodle in the 9x13 pan.  My family enjoyed it and i will make again.  Thank you!!!

I took the advice from other reads and sautéed the ground turkey with onions and garlic.  I only had 1 small can of tomato sauce and 1 can diced tomato on hand, so I added 1 can of Campbell’s Select Tomato Bails soup and this was very good!  The soup helped to keep it very moist. The only other change was that I also mixed the noodles with the beef and tomatoes. Thank you so much for a quick dish.

Made this for my family. Everyone loved it. I used spaghetti noodles and cut them in half.  Also added some garlic and onions.  Delicious!!

Loved it! The cream cheese and sour cream combine nicely and this does have a lasagna type flavor to it. I didn't have egg noodles so I used radiatore instead. Turned out great.

This was pretty easy to make.  I didn't have any cheddar on hand so I used mozzerella.  I was a little put off by the cream cheese/sour cream mixture.  I think ricotta or cottage cheese would have tasted better, but that's just a personal preference.  My husband really liked it.  I did put some pepper and italian seasoning into the turkey, along with some canned chopped tomatoes that I had on hand.  I did this after reading some of the comments from others.  I would make this again.

If you double the tomato sauce then you do no have to cook the noodles- just put them in dry!

It was good.  Added the onion and the garlic, oregano and basil.  Could have used some more tomato sauce.

We liked this.. I used an entire jar of tom sauce, as well as 1 can chopped tom. I subsituted the sour cream for low fat yogurt, I also added chesse to the top and then covered while I cooked it. It was a little runny, but over all good.

I have three small foster children that we are adopting and they have had a tough life and food was scarce. But, they are picky eaters. They loved this recipe. We had it for lunch the next day. Even our 1yr old loved it. This one is a keeper. It will be a once a month meal.

My family liked it. It was a pretty good basic meal. I did use one jar of prego marinara sauce and a small can of tomato sauce because it looked like it would be too dry. I am glad I did, it was just right. I also cooked the turkey with a little onion and garlic powder for more flavor. My husband loved it.

Not impressed.  I broke the cardinal rule of reading the reviews before making it so I am reviewing the recipe as it is written.  Yucky.  There's my review.  It seems that almost every single reviewer had to tweak the recipe so maybe it's okay with the changes but as written, not so wonderful.  This one won't be hitting my regular rotation.

Simple, but good. I added 1/4 cup minced parsley and 1 bunch minced green onion to the hamburger mixture. Next time I would also add some green peas. I would also reduce the cheddar cheese to 1 cup and don't use sharp, ick.

This is not a very fancy dish, and probably not very healthy either( but why use low fat or fat free dairy?  Ick.) - however, it is really not too shabby, would be amenable to tweaking, and I would serve it again.

WOW!!!  My 3yr old daughter couldn't eat enough of this!  I made some changes based on what I read.  I used wheat rotini as the pasta.  I sauteed the turkey with 3 cloves of garlic and half an onion in a little EVOO with some salt and pepper.  I used a chunky salsa in place of the tomato sauce and I used a mexican cheese blend.  Next time I think I will add a bit more salsa and add some milk to thin out the cream cheese mixture. Served with homemade cornbread.  Very hearty and perfect for a cold evening.

This recipe was good, but nothing that wow'ed my taste buds.  I added some spices, onions, and garlic to give it a little more flavor because you can tell from just reading it that the recipe lacks it.  Ive made better recipes than this and I think it was right on the line of me ever making it again.  It was still good but not good enough for me to make again.

I would say first that this is very interesting and if you're feeling adventurous try it! I took someone else's advice added onion and paprika to the turkey and put the sour cream mixture between the noodles and turkey mixture besides the layer between the turkey and cheese topping.The cream cheese sort of overpowered everything else.Next time I think I would use lite cream cheese.I also used regular sphaghetti sauce and added a little Italian seasoning to it.I would also add a little garlic next time.

This was easy and totally delicious!!  Great for a really cold night.  I tried it the first time and the whole family loved it, but it was missing a something between the noodles and the turkey mixture.  So I put a little bit of the cream cheese mixture in between the noodles and the turkey the 2nd time around and it was even more fabulous!  Bravo Beki!!!

This was a great recipe after adding onion, garlic, salt and pepper to the meat mixture. I've made a very similar recipe which uses spaghetti sauce instead of plain tomatoe sauce and cottage cheese instead of cream cheese. The cottage cheese gives the recipe a fresher and lighter taste.

I used ground chicken in this and seasoned it with some seasoned salt and a little bit of Worcestershire sauce, which I think helped.  I also didn't have egg noodles, so I used the pasta shells I had on hand.  (But I bet it would be better with egg noodles!)  I liked this recipe, and although my older son was in an exceptionally picky mood tonight, I think it's something most kids would do fine with because it doesn't have a lot of spices or unusual flavors.

This was a hit.  I did as others suggested and spiced it up with salt, pepper, onion powder and some Mrs. dash spicy.  I added some chopped tomatoes too.  Even my picky son loved it.  Served it with a salad.  We have enough for left overs.

I thought this was very good! My entire family loved it... I would, however, add another can of tomato sauce, because the cream cheese/sour cream is a bit rich. I also sprinkled seasoned salt on the ground turkey while cooking it. It would also be good seasoned with garlic salt/powder. I used reduced fat sour cream, and light cream cheese. Very yummy!

This was great!! I loved it! so did my mom. I am going to make this up for a friend who's having a baby and take it to her in a throw away pan. So she'll have a dinner easily poped in the oven. 
I added an extra can of tomato sauce as someone mentined. Also i couldn't imagine not adding any seasoning to the meat! Ground Turkey needs seasoning. I think next time i'll make it with ground pork. anyway. i layered it. put mozerella cheese on top! yummy! it is soo good. and so easy! 
OOH i added garlic, onion, pepper, salt, and i would have added italian seasoning if i had had some. but anyhow. it was soo yummy! and so easy! no chunks of anything to scare off the kids! :) Thanks!!

Followed other reviewer's advice and mixed everything together rather than layering. Doubled the tomato sauce and then added about acup of spaghetti sace as well. Next time I make it I will also add a can of diced tomatoes, maybe ro-tel for some spice. Added a lot of spices: garlic, thyme, pepper, salt & basil. Was a big hit with the family and pretty easy to make.

This was very good.  My children are very picky and it was a hit with them.  I substitued the tomato sauce for 6 Cheese spagetti sauce (more flavor).  I also added 1 tsp. Oregano, 3/4 T Seasoned Salt and 3/4 t. of Tastefully Simples Garlic Garlic.  I served it with Garlic Bread and Salad.  Enjoy!!

I added fresh garlic, onion, spicy pepper seasoning, italian seasoning, & salt to the turkey plus a can of diced tomatoes. I loved this recipe, next time I will use 12oz noodles instead of 8, it wasn't at all dry. I thought it was delicious, although my BF wasn't a huge fan. I will make this again.

I'm sure the next time I make this would make the rating go up.  However, the cream cheese/sour cream was way too much.  Next time will add more red sauce and spices, then I'm sure my 4-year old will like it and my husband will eat the leftovers.  It was too dry.

This casserole is simple and economical.  Very easy to put together.  My husband and I both really like it.  I used whole-wheat pasta and added some chopped onion and garlic powder, as we like things spicy.  I made it with ground turkey the first time and ground beef since.  It is good comfort food.  I didn't think there was too much cream cheese at all.  I actually might use more next time.

We spiced the turkey up with cayenne pepper, a little hot sauce and some chilli powder.  I think it gives this recipe the kick it needs.  Also, using low fat sour cream and eliminating the cream cheese is also an option for those watching fat intake.

I made this a couple of days ago and it had a nice presentation but was a bit heavy on the sour cream and cream cheese mixture and was bland.  I will make again only to add some seasonings as others suggested and cut down on the sour cream and cheese mixture.  I will add some sauce as the baking dried it up a bit.

I also use 1/2 cream cheese, it turned out rich enough.  Casserole was average, would search for a different recipe before trying again.

recipe resulted in a casserole where there was a lot of plain noodles separated from the other ingredients. i thought maybe it would have been better if all of the ingredients were mixed together instead of layered. 

the sour cream - cream cheese mixtures was too sticky to spread evenly over the top of the casserole. the result was clumps plopped around on top.

I felt there was too strong of a cream cheese taste, and not enough seasoning. We would use more sauce, and a flavored sauce.

This was delicious!  My husband is a picky eater and he went back for a second round!  I did only use 3/4 of the package of noodles instead of the whole pack.  This is a keeper for my recipes!

The reason I'm only giving this recipe two stars is that I think it has potential but definitely needs some tweeks.  I suggest maybe buttering the noodles while hot and then covering with  whichever turkey meat/ sauce mixture you like, then top with the cheese.  I used half cheddar and half Mexican cheese blend.

I left out the sugar to the tomato sauce and added onion and fresh mushrooms to the recipe. I sauteed the onion and mushroom first, added the turkey, then tomato sauce. I layered it in an electric skillet meat mixture first, then sour cream/cream cheese mixture, then pasta, and finally cheese. I used sharp cheddar and sprinkled with oregano.

I followed all the instructions, with one exception. I realized at the last minute that I had no noodles, so I used mini bow ties as the pasta layer. Came out wonderful anyway, I’ll make it again!

Good basic recipe but  needs to be bumped up. I skipped the sugar, added 3/4 T of chili powder and 1/2  teaspoon of  Chipoltle chili pepper to the meat mixture and took it in a Mexican direction.  With that addition (no extra money)  it was vastly improved. -:)

As is this recipe is terrible.  I made it as written and it tastes like chunky turkey catsup.  Everyone giving it 5 stars with their completely different recipe are looking for a social media following or a job.

A hit with my family.  I ended up using elbow noodles instead and that worked fine as a replacement.  I also added some chopped onions to the turkey for a bit of flavor. Plenty of leftovers.

This was a relatively simple meal to prep after a day at the office. I had only a bit of sour cream left in the fridge, so I added some Helluva Good French Onion Dip to the sauce, and taco-seasoned cheese. It was good, even as leftovers the next day for lunch! I'm adding this one to the family dinner menu.

Oh, this is so good!  I added a diced onion and a little garlic powder to the turkey while it cooked.  I let it reduce so I did not have to drain it. I think it has more flavor that way.  I then added a jar of spaghetti sauce.  The recipe did not specify what kind of tomato sauce.  I did not add sugar.  The two men in my house gobbled up a double recipe in one night! I did have about two cups myself.  This would be great to take to a pot luck dinner.

After reading the reviews, I made a series of changes to this recipe and found the finished product very good.  To the ground turkey, I added Trader Joe's Soy Chorizo.  I also added chopped zucchini, mushrooms, Onion, Garlic, Curry powder & Pepper flakes.  I also added a second package of egg noodles and increased the size of the baking dish.  In place of the tomato sauce, I added a 24 oz jar of chunky salsa.  I did not increase the amount of sour cream or cream cheese (although I did use light versions of each).  I also did not increase the cheddar cheese.  The original recipe can so easily be modified to your own tastes.  If I had them available, I would have also sauteed red & yellow bell pepper.  There is plenty of room in this recipe to add even more veggies.  This recipe was very well received at our house, I love how simple it was to make!

So I took this recipe and sort of amped it up to a whole different level and it was absolutely amazing!! I had limited ingredients in my fridge but I had the basics of the recipe. I used Rotel diced tomatoes, black beans, corn, and a red onion (yea I know) I sautéed the black beans with the red onion some Goya, brown sugar, and garlic. In a seperate pan I heated the Rotel and mexicorn with some garlic and cayenne pepper. I then sautéed my turkey meat with some spicy taco seasoning and pepper. I combined everything into one bowl - sour cream, cream cheese, and all the fixins! I also only had macaroni noodles but hey - it worked! What a delight. Topped with cheese and baked. It was phenomenal!

This dish was super easy and delicious!  Like others who make this dish, I tweaked my dish as well. Instead of tomato sauce, I used about 18 ounces of Prego Traditional sauce. I loved this dish! Oh, I also served with salad and home made cheesy garlic bread.

Needs more sauce and less shredded cheddar. Skip the sugar and add salt and pepper. Will make again with these adjustments.

Very good. I took the advice of other reviewers by adding onion and garlic and using spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce.

This was pretty good. I am a little unsure about the sour cream topping. Maybe next time I will try making it with more of a béchamel style topping. Or maybe a ricotta cheese blend topping. But not bad at all.

I found this dish to be very good! I did add a little water to the tomato sauce and added Italian herbs, onion flakes, and garlic salt to the Turkey meat. I probably would add more Turkey meat but the pound I used seemed to work. I used light sour cream and tasted fine and whole wheat egg noodles. I would make this again my husband enjoyed it!!!

Love this quick and easy recipe.  My family loves it too!  I added diced onion, garlic and Italian spice to the hamburg.  I have made it ahead, covered it with plastic wrap and refrigerated until it was time to cook.  The end result was the same, super yummy!

This turned out really great. To make it healthier, I made some changes, and it tasted amazing. Instead of cream cheese, I added cottage cheese. Then I added shredded carrots, some onions, and garlic. For extra flavor, I added cayenne pepper and various herbs. Instead of mixing the mozzarella cheese with the other cheese, I just sprinkled some on top of the cottage cheese and sour cream mixture. You can also substitute sour cream with with plain yoghurt. Made it with gluten free penne pasta. I'm sure you would not notice the difference with these changes

Extremely tasty and fairly easy to make.  I did read some of the reviews before and during the meal prep.  I added chopped onions, minced garlic, yellow and red sweet peppers while browning the turkey.  I also used flavored sauce (basil I think) instead plain sauce.  I made a mistake and added the sugar to the sour cream/cream cheese mixture.  Best mistake ever!!!  Oh and add extra salt and pepper.  The turkey really needed the boost.

I seasoned my turkey with seasoning salt,  garlic powder,  and pepper while it was browning.  I would say cornbread is not a good compliment to this meal.  Pasta and cornbread is not a good mesh.

I'm giving it 3 stars because I did a lot of substitutions.    Cooked the turkey meat and added, jalapeno and serrano pepper,  can of stewed Italian tomatoes,   sprinkle cereole seasoning, pepper and cumin.  Added half sour cream.  Cooked the noodles while meat was simmer.  I added the meat mixture to noodles and put in 9x13 dish. Put shredded cheese on top and melted in 350 degree oven.  Loved it even the teenagers went back for seconds!!

Pretty easy to make and my bf gave it 9/10!  I used fat free sour cream and light cream cheese.   I used old cheddar which brought out a lot of flavour.  I can't get wheat so I used rice pasta instead.  I also omitted the sugar.

It turned out ok. I won't use any sour cream in the mixture next time and use mozzarella instead of cheddar. The sour cream made it to tart tasting. I added chopped shallots and bacon bits and cremini mushrooms to the meat mixture...

I followed the recipe to the T and found it to be a little dry, for me. Too much noodles versus quantity of meat. I either needed more of one or the other if you get me. Next time I would use less noodles and add onions while browning the meat and mix the meat mixture with the noodles before putting it into the pan. HOWEVER, it is such a kid friendly dish, my kids macked it, so that was great:). I will make this again though with a little variation.

Since I am a vegetarian and no one else in my family is, I am writing this review based on the feedback I got from them. They "really, really love it" as my 8 yo stated. I did make a few changes. I cooked the turkey with onions, minced garlic, seasoned pepper, season salt, pepper and FlavorGod Garlic Lovers. I also seasoned the sour cream & cream cheese mixture with FlavorGod Everything. I used low fat sour cream & cheese. I used one 24oz bottle of spaghetti sauce. I mixed it with noodles, put half in the pan, add the cream cheese mixture and then topped with remaining noodles & meat sauce mixture. Did not experience the dryness that others had. Will definitely make again! Thanks!

This was ok, based on family feedback. Everyone had some, and it got eaten but nobody raved. So...just ok. Have to admit...if I was a newbie, it probably wouldn't have worked, with absolutely zero seasoning included. I seasoned the meat, as well as the cheese blend, but there wasn't even salt an pepper listed here. If you're gonna put a recipe up, there must be some seasoning listed. Just saying.

Not a fan. Was hoping family liked it based on earlier reviews. Even added extra spaghetti sauce, onions, garlic. It was the sour cream and cream cheese...way too much for our taste. Maybe would have been better if 1/2 the amount. Won't make again...we threw out the leftovers 'cause no one even would eat one serving the first night.

I took suggestions by other reviewers and used 24 oz of marinara sauce and added a green pepper, onion, and garlic. It tasted good with those additions - would have been completely bland and very dry with original directions. I'm rating it down for that reason and because the amount of pasta in proportion to the other ingredients is way too high. If I make again I will use no more than 8 oz of pasta.

My children gobbled it up, which is saying alot.  They try to be picky! Anyways, I did add an extra can of tomato sauce and seasoned the meat with Italian seasonings and also added chopped onions to the meat while browning.  Very delicious.

This recipe is pretty good and shows a different way of using egg noodles. However, I cut the recipe in half except for the meat and cooked chopped onion in with the ground turkey along with salt and pepper; instead of using white sugar I used 2tbs ketchup; and I would recommend lining the bottom of the baking dish with tomato sauce, then the noodles, the meat mixture, etc.

Made it tonight my son loved it daughter just played with it!!! Made some changes put very little of beef broth on bottom of pan so it wasn't dry when done added stir fry veggies(that was all I had,next time will be mixed veggies).Tasted too much sugar and too much cream cheese next time adding more meat and tomatoes, adding mushrooms,onion and garlic and cutting back on cream cheese and sour cream mixture might just use ricotta cheese and skipping the layers, just mixing everything together and topping with cheese!!!! I love one pan meals just make some garlic bread!!!! Overall recipe was a good starter point!!!

Great Recipe! I took the advice of others and seasoned it with garlic powder, pepper, Italian & Oregano. I also added bell peppers and onions and mixed the noodles with the meat and pasta sauce.  I mixed the sour cream & cream cheese in a small pot on the stop and then poured in to the mixture stirring it around with one egg for the casserole to stick.  I used the shredded cheese for layering (sharp cheddar & mozzarella).   Also for the sour cream & cream cheese I used sour cream and onion mixed with regular.

I made this tonight and I took advice from other viewers about the dry noodles and added a can of Rotel tomatoes to it along with the tomato sauce and half a cup of water in the mixture. I cooked in some onions and garlic and mixed it with the cooked noodles. I also blended the sour cream mix into the dish after placing it in the baking dish then added shredded cheese ( the 4 cheese) on top. came out perfect. I will certainly be making this again.

Good easy meal. Have the noodles going first. I also added 1/4 tsp of salt, pepper, garlic powder, rosemary, and oregano flakes. I like seasoning!

Hi everyone.  I tried this recipe last night.  I made the changings that everyone suggested.  Added onion, basil, parsley, peas and added extra sauce.   This was a hit for the picky family that I have. I gave it a 4 since additional ingredients needed to be added, but it was a GREAT starter recipe.  I served with a side salad since this was enough to feed an army. Easy and quick... just what I like on a busy Monday night dinner.   Thank you.

Added some spices and herbs and used gluten free pasta. Turned out well. Will change the cream mixture to 1/3 cream cheese 1/3 sour cream 1/3 cottage cheese with some Parmesan, pepper and parsley next time though.

This was great...  Of course no one ever does a recipe exactly like it's posted, but that is why it's so fun to cook right?!  So I thought I'd share how I made my version: 15oz Annie's cream of Tomato soup instead of tomato sauce, omitted the sugar, sautéed half a large Vidalia onion before browning the ground turkey, increased the sour cream to 16oz and of course no casserole is compete without crushed crackers on top!  :-)

Hubby and I loved this! I used spaghetti sauce with mushrooms instead of tomato sauce. I also used two cups of plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream/cream cheese. I threw in some garlic too. It was delicious!

I made some modifications,such as putting about 1 cup of chicken broth before adding noodles to baking dish so that the casserole wont dry up during baking process,diced onions and minced garlic in the ground turkey while cooking and instead of just plain tomato sauce I made it with spaghetti sauce,the cheese blend I did use light sour cream and Neufchatel cream cheese,but,followed the instructions,all in all it tasted very good, my husband enjoyed it,so,yes I would make this again,thanks for sharing.

My critique is that it is too rich with no seasoning or spices to balance it out. The cheese is too top heavy the ground turkey and tomato sauce tasted way too plain for my taste.

So of course I totally changed it based on what I had at home. Sauteed onions, garlic, cherry tomatoes cut in half and asparagus cut into small pieces. Added dried oregano, dried thyme and fresh sage as well as salt and pepper all to taste. Then browned the turkey, added in the veggie mixture and a can of organic diced tomatoes with jus. Added a little sugar and then let this simmer slowly while I cooked one pound of penne rigate. Mixed the two, put into a 9X13 glass baking pan, mixed some sour cream with cream cheese in the carton and spread it out over the pasta mixture, then put a generous helping of shredded mixed italian cheeses (did not bother using the real parmegiano reggiano or provolone since this is an American dish in my opinion) and then baked for 25 mins at 350F. I enjoy casseroles and the creativity you can have with them. My husband doesn't care for baked pasta. I'd make it again because the combinations and options are limitless - all veggie, or using beef or pork or a mixture. Easy to make and you can get creative. I never measure seasonings or much of anything, just do it by eye/taste and it comes out well.

My family and I absolutely loved it.  Did not need to go shopping for too many ingredients, easy to make and it was delicious.  Me being from the Caribbean(Puerto Rico), of course I had to add my own little touch to the turkey, Adobo Goya and "sofrito".  And to save some calories I used light sour cream, 1/3 fat free cream cheese and 2% milk cheddar cheese.

This was great once I made some changes.  I added the onion,  garlic, and Italian seasoning as someone had suggested. I also added 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese to the sour cream and cream cheese mixture.  Next time, I think k I will reduce the amount of noodles by about 1/3.  I'm so glad to find another ground turkey recipe . My family is reducing our consumption  of red meats.

This is pretty good.  I think it is rich so I cut the fat by using low fat cheeses, sour cream and Philly.  I used spiced spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce.  I used whole wheat enriched noodles.  It made a big pan and we will have enough for left overs this week.  I added onions and garlic.  I also added low fat Feta Cheese crumbles and fat free mozzarella shredded cheese.

This is a really good recipe.  Made it the other night last week & had them asking me to make it again. Added a few things like cilantro, garlic, mushrooms & green peppers.  The boys said it tasted like lasagna.  Making again for supper tonight.  Good quick meal  :)

I think this was a great base recipe and then I added to it and was very happy to it.  With some embellishments I give it a 5.
I caramelized some onions, then added some mushrooms and garlic to the pan.  Once done I set aside.  I used 24oz caned pasta sauce like others had suggested in stead of just tomato.  I Also added extra spices, like rosemary, thyme, oregano, blah blah blah (think italian spice mix).  I thought it was great!  Very yummy, will make again.

I liked it okay, but it does need a lot more spices. Onions, garlic, oregano, basil, salt, pepper, red pepper flakes are what I added, and mushrooms too. I think it would be better with ricotta cheese vs. Sour cream too. I'll try that next time.

I used half the amount of cream cheese, and it was a little bland but still good overall. Besides using more cream cheese, I will probably add an onion and some spices the next time I make it.

I made this because my son likes casserole type dishes and he loved it. It has a different taste to it but I like it as well. It is extremely easy to make and takes very little time to cook. The ONLY reason why I did not give this a 5 star rating is because is can't be all that healthy with the cheeses and sour cream in it.

I like this recipe. I did make some adjustments after reading previous reviews. I used ground beef instead of turkey. I sautéed onions, minced garlic, oregano and basil separately then added it to my sauce & beef mixture. I seasoned beef well with garlic powder and season salt. I created two layers with noodles, cheese, cream and beef mixture. I also sprinkled basil on top. My boyfriend & I LOVED it!!!

OMG, so delicious!!!  Everyone in my family loved this and i have a few picky kids!!  i have one child who cannot have dairy so i portioned out some of the meat, garlic and onion mixture and added the spaghetti sauce and tomato to his.  I used Elbow Mac instead of the egg noodles because it is so much easier for my kids to eat.   I sautéed the turkey with olive oil and fresh garlic and then added some chopped onion.  I used a 24 oz jar of my favorite spaghetti sauce and also added a can of seasoned chopped tomatoes.  I did not have any issue with it being dry as some reviewers have said.  I also used light cream cheese and light sour cream and you would never know it.  I used the full 2 cups of cheddar cheese on top and though i thought it was delicious, my kids didn't really eat the cheese so i suppose we all could have done without!! I added crushed red pepper to mine and it was soooooo yummmyyy!!!!!

Super easy & tasty and even my super picky eaters ate it. Had to use what I had on hand. Subbed cottage cheese for half the cream cheese (loved it that way and would do it again). Used extra lean turkey & only 1 cup shredded cheese cuz that is all I had. I only had high protein elbow macaroni so I used only half a box which was plenty, almost too much but because I used less than the amount of noodles called for I didn't get a dry result.  The only addition I made was sautéed garlic to the tomato sauce.  Turns out that the way I made it was pretty healthy too. Will definitely make again - may try it w/ a side of brown rice or quinoa instead of noodles.

My husband, 3 year old and I LOVED this! I replaced the 15 oz tomato sauce with a 25 oz jar of Private Selection(Kroger brand) Cilantro salsa and 1/2 of another jar of salsa. I used 3 pounds of ground turkey instead of 1 pound. I used onion and chives cream cheese instead of regular. I also added a can of Rotel tomatoes with chilies and a can of Kroger brand Italian Stewed Tomato Halves. I added about 15-20 fresh mushroom slices. I used about 3 cups of Mexican cheese instead of cheddar. It is making me hungry again just writing this! It was delicious!

YUM! quick and easy meal. I used a jar of spaghetti sauce (I prefer prego traditional) and added a half of a medium onion chopped, Tbsp of dried parsley, and a tsp of minced onion to the ground turkey. After adding the sauce to the turkey I simmered on low as I cooked the noodles. The best thing about this recipe is the unlimited options to tweak to you liking.

My Hubby LOVED this recipe! We used light options for the sour cream, cream cheese, and shredded cheddar. We used an entire jar of spaghetti sauce as well. We didn't think it was too dry at all. It was so rich, but still under 500 calories (with the changes we made). Def a recipe we are going to use more often!

Oh my goodness- delicious! I only changed a couple of things because I didn't have the exact ingredients for this recipe. Instead of sour cream, I used Chobani plain organic yogurt. It was actually probably a little healthier this way too. I also used mostaccioli noodles instead of egg noodles, and I added some fresh spinach to the meat and tomato sauce mixture. Loved this recipe, and I can't wait to make it again.

Very good recipe! I was a little nervous before cooking it because some said it was bland.  Since it is just 2 of us, I used 3/4 pound frozen ground turkey, 15 oz spaghetti sauce, 1 tsp sugar, 6 oz sour cream, 1/4 cup frozen diced onions, 1/2 tsp minced garlic from a jar, and bow tie noodles. I was out of cream cheese! I also seasoned the meat with a little pepper and silly salt! Then used everything together and topped with cheese. Baked 25 minutes and it was absolutely perfect! Definitely a keeper!

Very good! This is a great base recipe. I cooked this as listed but next time I plan on adding spinach, Italian sausage and more cheese.  It is the perfect comfort food and very filling. Also this makes a lot, it took me some days to finish this dish.

Since there were so many reviews saying this recipe was bland so I added minced garlic, onion powder, salt, pepper and crushed red peppers to the sour cream/cream cheese mixture. It's quite heavy with the cream cheese. If I make this again, I would use cottage cheese instead.

An easy little dinner for the family.  I added onion to the ground turkey and some herbs.  I also changed the topping from cheese to crushed crackers.  I used Cabernet round crackers, and added melted butter to the crumbled mixture, then topped the casserole and baked.  Kids liked it!

I used 1/2 of the tomato sauce, & topped the cheese with Durkee's Fried Onions.   Otherwise everything the same & it was really a hit!

This was a quick, simple recipe that turned out fabulous with a little tweaking!  The ground turkey definitely needed seasonig.  I added poultry seasoning, along with salt and pepper.  Since I'm not a big fan of cream cheese, I only added like 2 Tbs, and limited the shredded cheese on top.  It still tastes great without all that cheese, and is a lot less fattening.  So nice to have a quick, great tasting go-to recipe as a single mom!

This recipe is easy and very versatile in my opinion. I did add onions and garlic when I browned the turkey. I also used a 24 oz. can of tomato sauce and a 10 oz. can of Ro-Tel which I thought added a lot of flavor. I used elbow macaroni instead of noodles because I thought it would be easier for my kids who are all 4 and under. I would recommend not cooking the noodles all the way because they came out a bit too soggy for my families liking. I also mixed the macaroni with the meat mixture like others had mentioned. This is definitely a quick and easy one! Try it!

THis was pretty good, definitely needed the add in other suggested.  I also think it needed more than 1 lb of turkey.  It made a lot, so it would be good for a large family.  We didn't love it, so probably won't make it again.

I added the extra tomato sauce and onions/garlic for flavor.  Oh, and I didn't layer (wasn't sure we'd like that big layer of cheese/cream), so I just mixed everything together and topped with the cheddar cheese.  My husband said this is definitely a keeper, and he can't wait to have the leftovers (which is unusual).  Will definitely make this again.

I only gave it 4 stars because I used most of the suggestions for the augmentations in other reviews.  But, it gets 4 stars for being a classic staple that you change according to your families tastes.  My hubby loved this, and he usually does not like leftovers but he said he is looking forward to these tonight!!!  Yay!

This recipe was really bland. I did not like it at all. I gave it 1 star because I had to select something. Generally, I like all of the ingredients that the recipe called for, but together in this dish, they didn't quite work together for me.

I just made this dish and Im sorry to say we didn't eat the rest of it .  I followed the recipe and took the advice of others regarding seasoning, more sauce etc, and I found it to still be very bland and it just seemed to be lacking something.  I will not be making this again.

I made this with a few of the modifications listed.  I used 240z of roasted garlic and onion diced tomatoes instead of the 15 oz of tomato sauce. It definitely wasn't dry with this amount.   I seasoned the turkey while it was browning with a little garlic, onion, pepper, cilantro, and oregano.  It isn't bad like this, but I would probably make further modifications if I ever made it again.    The egg noodles are pretty floppy.  It might be better with a macaroni noodle.  I would probably mix all the ingredients together next time.  Unless you use lasagna noodles I don't really see the benefit of layering...2 cups of shredded cheddar on top was way to much.  I would either cut back or mix some of it into the casserole before topping it. I ended up with a congealed mass of cheddar on mine.

changed it a bit, didn't have egg noodles so I used elbow macaroni, and I also added some mixed shredded cheese instead of cheddar. All my kids enjoyed it--even the picky ones!! THANKS

My kids and husband loved it.  But I did add garlic and onions to the turkey meat when I was cooking it and actually used a whole jar of pasta sauce because I did not have canned tomato sauce.

This was wonderful! I've been looking for turkey recipes because we are cutting out red meat. This is definitely a keeper. I did tweak it though, as suggested. I sauteed an orange pepper (so the kids don't see it!), garlic, and onion first, then added the turkey and continued as suggested. This way we get some veggies too!

I just rated it as is but this is a good base, I've made it many times with my adjustments to kick it up a bit. I skipped the sugar and added onions, garlic, italian seasonings and at least 1 veggie (zucchini is what I had this time) but sometimes I use peas &/or shredded carrots, can also add chili pepper flakes if you like it a little spicey

Awesome!  Per previous poster, I added minced garlic, half of a green bell pepper and half of a diced onion, plus 15 oz of tomato sauce, and 10 oz of Newman's Own marinara.  I also subbed lowfat SC and cream cheese, as well as extra lean ground turkey.  I am sure it's still loaded with calories, but I didn't even care:)

I make this on a regular basis.  It is only mysef and my husband, but we use the leftovers for lunches at work, and it reheats beautifully.  The only changes I've made to it -- I leave out the sugar (I find it unnecessary), and I take the ground turkey and tomato and mix them directly in a bowl to mix directlywith the sour cream mixture.  I find it easier to spread with all four items mixed together than trying to do 2 separate layers.  I also use low fat version of everything, and it still tastes great!

thought this dish was good enough for seconds.  i skipped the sugar, used light sour cream, 1/3 less fat cream cheese, 50% reduced fat cheddar cheese, and added frozen peas on top of the turkey under the cheeses.  very easy to prepare and i had all the ingredients on hand!

This is my type of dish, but was a little off.  I think when I make it again, I'll skip the sugar and use a jar of spaghetti sauce.  I also used wheat egg noodles and used a mixer for the sour cream and cream cheese.  I would not recommend using light sour cream, get all the goodness in the real stuff.  Oh and I followed the recommendation to add pepperoni which was great.  I will make this again and re-rate when I get it right.

This recipe was really delicious! My husband loves pepperoni, so I added a layer on top of the meat layer. Also, I added a jar of spaghetti sauce and a big can of spiced tomatoes and mine was not dry at all. I added lots of extra spices, such as oregano, salt, lots of pepper! My husband said that he would give this recipe a 4.7... haha. Very yummy!

This sounded like a really good casserole. I made the recipe as Beki submitted, however my husband & I wasn' really sold on it.   Next time, I will add the onions, garlic, and oregeno. I'm sorry we weren't crazy about it, but thank you for sharing anyways!

This was okay.  But I felt that the sour cream and cream cheese was too rich, and I felt kind of guilty eating/serving it.  It didn't seem very healthy.  I don't even think using "healthy turkey" made this feel healthy.  However, my husband and kids liked it.  I just don't think it is a healthy choice for dinner.

This recipe turned out to be okay, but needs more flavor. It's a good base recipe, but more ingredients should be added. I put in some mushrooms, onions, and not as many noodles. I also added more meat to make it more tasty!

This was pretty good. I took the advice of other reviewers and added some sauteed some garlic, green peppers, and onions into the turkey. I also added about a tablespoon of dried oregano and some kidney beans to up the fiber. I used reduced fat sour cream and cream cheese also. Delicious and looking forward to eating the leftovers.

Since so many people throw a hissy when a recipe is altered on this site, I followed the directions to a tee.  It was difficult because my instincts were screaming - salt - pepper - a spice - maybe an onion?  So, to those of you who are creative enough to alter a recipe, thank you.  Keep doing it.  This recipe was awful.

Excellent! I mixed the noodles with my sauce/ground turkey breast mix and it came out excellent. I didn't use sour cream (because I didn't have it in the house). It was quick and easy, which is just up my alley!

I tried this meal with my family and the kids really liked it.  I cooked the meat with a lot of seasonings, used my favorite marinara sauce, used low fat sour cream and cream cheese and they turned out fine.  I might mix the noodles with the cream mix before baking next time to take away some of the dryness in the noodles and to cut down on the richness of the cream mixture.  Definitely a winner for the kids and easy to make.

This was a lot like a lasagna.  I used homemade noodles which added a wonderful texture store-bought couldn't.  I would treat this as a base recipe; add seasonings to fit your palette. Since this recipe was rich, I would try low-fat cream cheese next time.  I doubled this recipe.  I loved it & will use again.

I used regular turkey and shredded it, and it still tasted good.  The part about this that was weird was the sour cream and cream cheese mixture. It just didn't go with the rest.  Even without that this would still be just 4 stars and not something I'll make again.

This was OK. Nothing special. I thought the turkey gave it a funny taste. Neither of my kids would eat it, except to pick off the cheese.

This came out very tasty. The only thing I changed was almost tripled the cheese amount and I also mixed the meat with the pasta a bit. Next time I make it I will probably a a little bit more meat though..

This recipe is so good! Tastes a little like lasagne but a nice change. When I make it again I will not use so much cream cheese/sour cream mixture.

Very interesting combination... After reading the reviews I made some adjustments... Italian style stewed tomatoes - 2 14.5 cans and a 6 oz can of tomato paste and some water... also used neufchatel cheese and low fat sour cream.   When browning the ground turkey I added some minced garlic and dried onion flakes.  Pretty tasty and easy to prepare - will have again.

This was very good.  I also followed the lead of others and put a diced onion in with the turkey while browning it.  I used a little salt and lemon pepper.  I only had extra large elbow macaroni and used Hunts spaghetti sauce, intstead of plain tomato sauce.I mixed everything together and topped with the shredded cheese.  The flavor was great, it turned out delicious!!!!!!  I made a huge pan of it and I'm looking forward to my left overs tomorrow.

My finicking eaters really like this.  I would consider adding spices to the turkey next time (not salt!).  I didn't have enough tomatoe sauce on hand so I just pureed w/hand blender a can of diced tomatoes.  I could see doing that again w/italian style diced tomatoes or diced tomatoes w/green chiles.  This somewhat bland, but very rich dish was very kid friendly.  I think to cut out some fat, I will also try it w/reduced fat cream cheese and reduced fat sour cream.

This recipe is VERY rich.  It was great the first night, but once I tried to have leftovers....it tasted like heartburn waiting to happen.  So, we had to throw it out. I wouldn't mind making it again, but I would cut the portions in half to alleviate the heartburn feelings.

3 out of 5 of us liked this recipe. It was an easy recipe and had a "just one more bite" quality of taste to it.  For some reason 2 of our children didn't like the sour cream/cheese mixture. I still may make this for a potluck, just not for a dinner for us. 
But it you want easy and yummy, this is it.  Definitely a good "comfort" food for cold winter days.

This was a fabulous, easy to put together meal.  My 3 year old twins AND my husband ate it without complaint and loved it!!!

I did as other reviewers suggested and added seasonings (diced onion, garlic, oregano, pepper) to the ground turkey.  It was absolutely delicious!

The only other recommendation I would make is to make room in the refrigerator for leftovers.  It makes A LOT!  You may want to halve the recipe if you have a small family or toddlers!

We really liked this.  I made a few changes that worked for us. I substituted lowfat yogurt for the sour cream and added a can of diced tomatoes to some leftover jars of marinara I had in the fridge.  I doctored the sauce with extra spices (garlic, onion, oregano, basil, etc.) which made it so tasty.  I also used higher protein spiral pasta instead of the egg noodles to cut down on the carbohydrate content.  My husband loved it.  He couldn't figure out what was in it but scarfed it down.  A big hit!  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a really good base recipe. I added oregano, basil, crushed red pepper, diced green peppers and onions to the ground turkey. In addition to the tomato sauce, I added a can of diced Italian tomatoes. It was really good!

This was a great recipe.  My kids and husband loved it.  We even had it for left overs and it still was a hit by all.  I did though use 8 oz of tomato sauce and 8 oz of spaggetti sauce because that is what I had.  It worked out great.

I found this to be bland and a bit too creamy.  It was, however, easy to make. I froze the dish in individual corning ware containers and was able to pull one out at a time for a last minute dinner. If you freeze it, I recommend baking it rather than microwaving it.

This recipe is really yummy, and my husband (who's particular) loves this!  I use lean ground beef instead, reduced fat cream cheese and light sour cream and it still comes out really well.  It's definitely a comfort food.

This was bland and tasteless.  I even followed recommendations from other reviews and used diced tomatoes, garlic, onion, and italian seasoning and it still was bland.  I was very dissapointed.

I couldn't eat more than three bites.  The cream cheese was overpowering, and everything else was just bland.  I did add garlic and onion to the turkey along with paprika, but it cheese sauce was just too rich to taste anything else.

Not that good.  My husband thought it was a little bland even with the added spices as reviews said to do.  I thought this was going to be great from all the rave reviews... but I definitely will not make again.  Way to much cream cheese tasting and I love cream cheese!

Very good & Easy to make. I changed some of the ingredients to fat free and organic. Wouldn't suggest using fat free cheese on top- next time I will use regular. But overall very good, my husband loved it!

After reading the reviews for this dish. I deceided to add some spices to the ground turkey and add spaghetti sauce and a can of diced tomatoes with italian seasoning. I also added some milk with the cream cheese and sour cream mixture and combined it with the noodles for a better blend and topped it with my meat sauce.  It turned out really good. I have a 3 very picky young daughters and one in particular hates everything spaghetti. She on the other hand had 3 servings of this. I made a 13x9 size platter and it was gone in minutes. This is something I will definetly be making again. Thanks

My family had varying opinions on this recipe.  My 7 year old daughter loved it.  My 9 year old son gagged on it.  My husband and I didn't really like it that much, but ate it anyway.  So, this one won't go into the recipe box.

Just finished eating for dinner.  Less noodles/more turkey for next time.  I added 2 T. Heinz 57 sauce and a few shakes of Worcesterhire and omitted sugar (in meat mixture).  Used lowfat cream cheese, fat free sour cream and a little low fat cottage cheese.  Turned out great.

Yum! Okay I did change it up a bit I used Kosher salt, pepper, and some chicken season to season the turkey meat. I did not have that much sour cream at home so instead I used low fat plain yogurt. I also added some spaghetti sauce. My husband and I loved it! We are having 2nd's tonight.

Excellent!  I sprinkled some garlic salt over the turkey burger as it was browning.  I also used m own, infamous spaghetti sauce instead of the canned tomatoes that this recipes calls for.  This was like "lazy girls lasagna!"  Thanks for the idea!

the taste was pretty good, but next time I try this I'll mix the cream cheese and sour cream mixture with the noodles first, then layer the meat and tomato sauce and top with the cheese.  Don't forget to season the meat well before adding the tomato sauce.

I added getti sauce along with s&p,onion and garlic salt.  I believe that instead of using the sour cream instead I would add some ranch to it.  The sour cream to me gave it a diffrent taste other then that it was good.  I am a very picky person when it comes to food.  I dont really care for cream cheese and my husband doesnt care for sour cream.  He loved it though, if the cream cheese hadnt been soft though it would have been rather hard to mix. giving you clumps instead of a cream.

I added some of the others suggestions.  I added about 1 Tbsp of Garlic garlic, Italian seasoning, salt and pepper, and a whole onion while sauteeing.  It tasted preatty good- I was looking for a way to disguise the healthy turkey.  It worked.

This recipe is not bad for a quick fix for a busy weeknight. I am exhausted when I get home sometimes from work/school, so I find this meal to be quick and easy to throw together. The cream cheese and sour cream make this recipe rich and satisfying, but I do find the overall taste of the dish to be a bit bland even with extra seasoning.

Ok, my fault. I didn't read the reviews before I made this. I made the recipe as it states. I will next time add spices to the turkey and add more sauce. I did love the rich taste of the cream cheese and sour cream. My husband likes anything with cheese so he didn't mind the bland taste of no spices. I agree there are way too many noodles. I had to bake in two separate pans. Will try this recipe again in the future.

This is very easy to make and pretty good comfort food.  I used fat free sour cream and neufchatel cream cheese to make it a little healthier. It is a little bland, though, so I think I'll try adding some spices next time.

This is the first casserole I've ever made.  Not bad.  To improve on the taste, I would add onions and garlic to the turkey mix, half the amounts of cream cheese and sour cream and reduce the amount of noodles.

This was simple to make but only average for taste.  If you like the idea of this recipe I suggest the Creamy Chicken Lasagna on this site--more work, but it tastes much better.

I really loved this casserole--it was so easy.  It even tasted great as a leftover!  I didn't have tomato sauce on hand, so I substituted a jar of spaghetti sauce.  It was great.  The whole family loved it--even my picky daughter admitted that she liked it!  Wow!

This was excellent! I added onion and garlic to while browning the turkey. I used a large can of diced tomatos. My whole family loved it. I will be making this for a long time.

I agree, this was definitely a comfort food! I've made this twice and one time gave it away to new parents and they loved it. It's easy and yummy.

This was a great quick and easy casserole. I seasoned the turkey while browning, with whatever I saw in the cabinet and I added a can of seasoned diced tomatoes to the mix. Oh and I used all of the cream cheese and sour cream it calls for, lowfat of both.

This is very bland. I had to add a lot of salt and pepper just to make it edible. I love sour cream and cheese of any kind, but, this was a dissapointing recipie. Mediocre at best.

My son asked me to make this casserole the next week.  I guess it makes this recipe a BIG hit in my house.  I did substitute the tomato sauce for spaghetti sauce. Other than that, I did everything else just like the receipe says.

This recipe was truly different for me.  I'm not used to cooking with cream cheese.  It was a nice twist to what I'm used to cooking. My son & I truly enjoyed this dish. My son usually doesn't eat leftovers if he doesn't like something.  Well all I can say is the dish is clean.  There aren't any leftovers.  Need I say more.

This was very good!  Comfort food all the way.  I made it with fat free sour cream and fat free cream cheese, and it turned out great.  Served with corn bread.  Will make this again!

I tried this recipe tonight, with a few changes, and it was very tasty.  Instead of ground turkey I used sweet turkey sausage.  I used my own homemade tomato sauce, which contains lots of fresh garlic, onions and herbs (only because I have a freezer full of it) and I used 1/2 cheddar and 1/2 mozzarella.  The result was great!  This will become a regular in our house.

Very tasty. Added another pound of turkey and 14 oz can of diced tomatoes with green chilies as others had suggested. Also added 1 tblsp garlic powder but otherwise followed recipe. Will cut the cream cheese and sour cream in half next time as others suggested as well

Very Good, I consider this a great addition to my "comfort" food category.  Not expensive, makes a lot and fills you up.  It's mild flavor is great on those stress filled days.  I used half the sour cream and cream cheese as recommended in other reviews and thought that was perfect.

I made this recipe last night, my husband and I loved  it. I took the advise of others and used 1/2 of sour cream and 1/2 of cream cheese.  What a wonderful delight.

This recipe was great. The only changes that i made to it was to cut the amount of cream cheese and sour cream in half. It was still plenty rich. The ground turkey is a nice change. I browned the turkey in the pan then combined the rest of the ingredients to it. YUMMY!

Pretty good....I cut down on the cream cheese though and it was more than rich enough.  Will probably make again.

I thought this recipe was great.  My family loved it.  The only thing I changed was that I added a few garlic cloves to the browning ground turkey.  Thanks.

Great and easy.  I did take the advice of adding about 3/4 can of diced tomatoes with oregano and garlic.  I also added salt and pepper, and a little parsley over the top.
