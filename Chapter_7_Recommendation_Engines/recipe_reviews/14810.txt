The only way I can give this four stars is after MAJOR changes to this recipe. First, a teaspoon of salt is unnecessary, I left it out entirely (Worcestershire is salty enough). I also left out the onion and just sprinkled in some onion powder. Also, fry ground beef in shortening? I don't think so. I used ground sirloin and cooked them in the oven. I greased a cookie sheet and baked the meatballs at 375 for 10-15 minutes, turning once. I then added the chili sauce, grape jelly and meatballs to my slow cooker and let them heat up.The combo of chili sauce and grape jelly is excellent, once the flavors combined and the sauce thickened this was an excellent snack. Great crowd pleaser.

This is soo easy!!  I cheat though and use frozen meatballs, put them in a crockpot w/the chili sauce and grape jelly and just let them heat in the crock pot on low.  Really nice snack. :)

Wonderfully tangy meatballs.  I bake (rather than fry) the meatballs on a cookie sheet up to 2 weeks ahead of time and freeze them.  On the day I am serving them, I dump the chili sauce and grape jelly in a crock pot.  Then, add the meatballs straight from the freezer.  If you do this, you will need to start the crock pot on HIGH setting at least 1 1/2 hours before eating.  Ready to eat when liquid is simmering.  These go quickly!!!!  (You may substitute pre-packaged frozen meatballs to save on time).

I would never have tried such a strange combo if not for all the positive ratings, but I'm sure glad I did!  We made these for our Christmas party, and everyone loved them - even me, and I'm not a beef person at all!  I used 2 lbs of frozen plain meatballs, and found that the recipe uses exactly 1 small jar (I think 10 oz) of jelly, and 1 jar (12 oz) of chili sauce.  How could it get any easier?  And definitely let them sit in the crock pot for a while - the longer they sit, the more the sauce soaks in and adds to the flavor and texture.  And don't forget that veggie meatballs work great with this too, for a much healthier treat.  Thanks for this fantastic recipe!!

I gave this recipe 4 stars since the meatballs, (minus the sauce) were excellent. However, the sauce was way too sweet, not at all spicy, and left something to be desired. After some tweaking, I was able to make this an excellent appetizer that got great reviews! First, I baked the meatballs rather than frying them.  I mixed the original ingredients for the sauce, added a few dashes of Frank's Hot Sauce, one clove of minced garlic, powdered mustard, and 1 1/2Tbs Worcestier sauce. I poured the sauce mixture into the crock pot with the cooked meatballs and cooked on high for 1 to 1 1/2 hours. They were tasty and party perfect! I am excited to make them this way again!

This is the same recipe I've been using for the past couple years! However, I don't use shortening and like another reviewer, I bake mine on a greased cookie sheet at 350 for about 30 minutes turning halfway. Also, instead of cooking the sauce on the stovetop, I use my slowcooker. Blend both sauces and then add the meatballs and cook on high for 2-3 hrs or low for 5 hrs. I've made this recipe many many times and there's NEVER any leftovers. Great for potlucks because you can bring your crock and keep them on the warm setting - just make sure not to overcook them - they burn easily if you overcook.

I just use the Costco frozen Italian style beef meatballs.  I add a bit of mustard and worcestershire sauce to the sauce, about 1-1/2 tbsp each and some ground pepper.  Always the first thing to get finished at the office potlucks.  People are amazed at the easiness of the recipe, once they wrap their heads around the idea of heated grape jelly glaze.  It is so awesome that I always have to set aside a small batch for the hubby to eat for dinner with brown rice....

I have used this "secret" recipe for years and it always gets rave reviews.  It is the most requested dish at family gatherings.  I always start with a big bag of frozen meatballs from whatever warehouse type store we belong to at the moment.  Throw them in the crockpot frozen, dump the jars in and about 1-1 1/2 hrs later it is ready to eat.  Never a disappointment.  I also like them reheated...Yum...

Excellent, Excellent, Excellent!!
I cannot tell you how good these were! I took them to a christmas party last night and I got tuns of compliments on them. I loved them myself. My mouth is watering just thinking about them.
I only had about 9 meatballs left in my pot when it was all said and done and the only reason for that is because there was so much other foods there.
I put them in the crock pot but did so too late so to speed things up I put the sauce and the meatballs(frozen homestyle) into a pot on the stove and slow boiled them for about 30 minutes and then put them in the crock pot to take to the party. They were perfect, great taste and great texture! Don't try the sauce when you first put them it because its gross but when everything cooks together its wonderful. Take my word for it, TRY THIS RECIPE!!!

I have made this a few times.  We really like it!  Especially good for potlucks using frozen meatballs, although the meatballs cool down fast.  (Better to plug in crock pot when you arrive)  There are a few chili sauces to choose from.  I find it is best with a spicier chili sauce; as opposed to those sauces that are more tomato based.  I like Bennetts chili sauce.  Thanks for a great and quick recipe!

So, one review gave one star because (as they write) they use frozen meatballs from Sam's Club. Haha! No wonder they hated this! Please, if you dont actually follow the recipe and then hate it, then dont review for Pete's sake! The meatball recipe was great, and I cannot imagine the frozen Sam's Club meatballs were any good.  My story: made these exactly. Brought them to a cook out in a slow cooker to keep warm. They ended up on the counter in the house where no one ate them... that is not until they were discovered later on. I walked in to a crowd of people chowing down on the meatballs directly from the cooker then dipping in the sauce which I kept on the side. 6 pounds of meatballs (yes folks, 6 lbs!) were devoured in a matter of an hour. Although it was sadly forgotten at first, this dish became the hit of the party and mostly because of the meatball recipe.   I now use this recipe as my standard meatball recipe for everything even if I am not making the sauce and instead use the meatballs for something else. So if you're going to make this? Please make sure to use the actual recipe, ok? Do not substitute pre-made meatballs which are generally terrible anyway. This is a great easy meatball recipe and is delicious! Also, I use butter instead of lard, and it works perfectly.

A word of advice: use some sweet Thai chili sauce, NOT Sriracha. The first time I made this (with the sweet chili -- plus garlic and some other additions) it was *phenomenal*. When I went to repeat it yesterday for a party, I decided to try the Sriracha... even just a couple of tablespoons made the sauce so spicy that it was inedible and I had to start over. Such a disappointment, when I know how good it can be with the right chili sauce!

So good!   I doubled the recipe and served at a party and they were the first thing to go.  The only change I made was to use 1 tbsp of dried onion flakes instead of the chopped onion.    I took the advice of other reviewers and baked the meatballs in advance and put in the freezer.   Three hours before the party, I mixed together the chili sauce and jelly in the crockpot and then put the meatballs in.   I cooked on high for 2 hours and then switched to low.

I have Celiac, so I can't eat any of the meatballs in the grocery stores because they're all made with wheat bread crumbs. I made these with brown rice bread crumbs and they turned out great! I've substitued salsa once when I didn't have any chili sauce on hand and they still turned out great! I prefer apricot jam instead of the grape jelly though - light tasting and doesn't mask the flavour of the meat.

These are some pretty awesome meatballs. For all those who are using frozen meatballs- you are missing out on some fantastic homemade meatball action. They are deliscous even without the sauce.   They are super easy to make.  I made the meatballs the day before my party. Instead of frying I baked them in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes.  On the day of the party I heated up the chilli sauce and jelly and threw in the meatballs.  Fantastic!!

Use frozen meatballs. Can use almost 2 pounds of ground beef for the amount of sauce. Add ingredients to crock pot.

Cocktail meatballs are always great at parties.  But, I made a few changes to this one.  I used a pound and a half of ground beef and instead of frying the meatballs - way too much grease - I baked them at 400 for 20 minutes then added them to the sauce in the slow cooker on low.  Very tasty and very simple.

This rating is just for the sauce.  I was lazy and bought frozen cocktail meatballs!  The sauce was so simple yet so yummy.  Got many compliments on it and MANY raised eyebrows when I told people what was in the sauce!  I quadrupled the sauce recipe for a party and used 1 1/2 bags of frozen meatballs (containing about 96 meatballs) and it all fit perfectly in my crockpot.

I took some of the suggestions that others had previously done (I love that about this site).  Used panko bread crumbs, used about 1 1/2 pounds of meat for the same amount of sauce.  I only used about 1/4 teaspoon of Worcstershire as I think it can be a little strong.   I pan cooked the meatballs in a little bit of canola oil rather than in so much shortening.  I also added some garlic powder and onion powder to the sauce mix.  After cooking them and simmering them on top of the stove I put them in my slow cooker to take to a clambake.  Everyone loved them.  My 4 year old at at least 10 meatballs!!!  I have a very similar recipe from my mother where she puts the meatballs in the sauce raw and cooks them in the sauce.  While it added an extra step to pan cook them I think it really added a nice texture to the meatballs.

I used frozen meatballs from Sam's Club and made the sauce as written exactly.  The meatballs were too sweet and the flavors didn't blend well.  I used brand name Grape Jelly & brand named chili sauce.  The Grape overpowered the chili sauce.   Will not make again.

These were good, but not fantastic. Not sure what I would change to make them fantastic -- they're pretty close already. Possibly a shot of vinegar-based hot sauce? Thanks for the recipe :)

These were pretty darn good!  I used someone else's suggestion of adding worchestershire sauce, garlic, a little hot sauce, and dry mustard, and really liked the doctored up sauce.  I did use frozen meatballs, which I never do, but even those weren't bad ... they were a good firm texture, good for eating on toothpicks on a buffet.  I do suggest cooking the meatballs first before tossing in the crockpot with the sauce ... yes, it's a little more work, but enough grease cooked out of them to make it seem worthwhile.   May make these again for Christmas next weekend!

Don't be scared - these really are great!  My mom has always made these... but refuses to tell people the recipe until the next day; it sounds gross but it is AWESOME!  Easiest thing to make for a party... just use frozen meatballs (saves so much work and doesn't really sacrifice the taste), cook the sauce briefly on the stovetop and then dump the meatballs & sauce in the crockpot. It will seem like there's not enough sauce, but there is.  As it heats and you periodically stir, it will fully cover.  Turn on the crockpot for about 4 hours and voila!

Easy recipe. I used 12oz Chili sauce and 10 oz Jelly and already made meatballs. Great for a party- they loved it. That was my first time to make it. When I make it again, I think I will use a little less Jelly, maybe 2 TBS. I also added 1/4 cup of water in my crockpot. Excellent and fast!!!

I made this for a party the other night, along with several of my regular top crowd pleasers and the meatballs were what everyone left talking about.  I made triple what the recipe called for and they were all gone in about 20 minutes. Definitely going to make this one again sometime.

I personally didn't care for these.  too sweet.  I even added some cayenne pepper to try to give it some kick, but I still didn't care for them. But everybody else at the party really liked them, so I gave it 4 stars.

These are very good. I always double the recipe and freeze half of them for future suppers. They freeze well! I do fry them in the oil because they seem to hold the slow cooker better without falling apart.

This is really easy and low maintenance since you can leave it warm & simmering in a crock pot.  I baked the meatballs and substituted ground turkey and panko for the beef and bread crumbs.  They turned out wonderful.  Thanks for the recipe.

i followed magnoliawench's advice and baked them ahead of time and froze them and then dumped the chili sauce and grape jelly in a crockpot and added the meatballs. I will definitely make these again.

My7 yr old daughter RAVED about this recipe...especially since it has such cool ingredient like Grape Jelly. Didn't have chili sauce so I used ketchup and chili powder. 

She requests this for dinner every night now.

I've made these twice now and they were a hit both times.  I decreased the amount of grape jelly to 3/4 cup which helps bring down the sweetness.

These are OUTSTANDING meatballs, but I cannot bear the sauce.  I use them in tomato sauce, and make heros out of them, or I serve them over spaghetti.  They freeze very very well after cooking, and if you freeze them individually, it's easy to pull out just 5 or 6 for a quick dinner, heated up in tomato sauce.  Honestly, they're terrific!  When I use this recipe to make meatloaf instead of the meatballs, I use oatmeal instead of the breadcrumbs, and cook it with 2 slices of bacon on top - 350 degrees for 1 hour.

Great! I used frozen Italian style meatballs, 18 oz jar grape jelly and 12 oz jar of Heinz chili sauce. Mixed sauces first in crockpot on low heat and because some have commented the sauce is rather sweet, I spiced it up with some Frank's RedHot pepper sauce. Sorry, for those of you who like measurements, I just dumped some in - maybe 1/4 cup or so??  Also - next time I think I might add some fresh garlic to the sauce to spice it up a bit. Otherwise - fabulous sauce and super easy with frozen meatballs!

This is the only recipe i will ever use again for meatballs! There is none any easier or better tasting in my opinion. I doubled the sauce recipe and added a 5lb bag of Armour Homestyle Meatballs. Everyone loved it at our family Christmas party and i came home with an empty crockpot! Now thats a compliment!!

Very good.  The sauce for these is so delicious and how simple.  Dump 2 ingredients into a pan and simmer the meatballs in it.  The only thing I did differently is instead of fresh onion I used dehydrated.  It saved me the time of chopping.

These went over very well for a gathering I took them to. I modified the recipe slightly, but overall stuck to the core of the recipe. I used the frozen meatballs, which worked slick! I did add a couple dashes of hot sauce to kick it up a bit.

We make them every year as an appetizer for a Christmas Eve party, and they are always gone within minutes. We make them mini sized though...about 45 meatballs. We've used the Crisco to fry, but I'm sure vegetable oil or even baking them is fine! LOVE THESE!

This recipe is an old standby that is tried and true yummy.  But if making meatballs from scratch, you dont need the shortening. Just pan fry and if you want, sprinkle a dab of olive oil in the bottom on a fry pan as you heat up the pan to cook.  Also, if you want to spice up the sauce, at 2 tbls of minced garlic, 1/2 teas onion powder and 1-3 teas of red pepper flakes, depending on your heat preference. Its great at parties!

These were good, but a little too sweet.  I used the pre-made meatballs from BJ's freezer section, so it took just a matter of minutes to put everything together and throw in the crockpot.  I warmed it on low for a few hours until our party.

I've not made the homemade meatballs, I usually buy the frozen ones from Sams.  This is the exact sauce I have always used on them and it is WONDERFUL!  You have to try it.  Then get the cocktail weiners and mix apple jelly and mustard to put them in, it is just as good. Two saucy thumbs up for this recipe!

Great appetizer!  I did cheat with the store bought meatballs, but nobody seemed to mind.  They were so easy make.  Just threw'em in the slow cooker.

My grandfather used to make meatballs like this when I was little...I searched and searched for a recipe good enough to follow his tradition, and THIS IS IT!  I have made these meatballs for holiday parties, baby showers, birthday parties, or just to eat myself, and they are always a huge hit.  I use the frozen meatballs, they always come out terrific.  I also cook them in the crock pot, as suggested.  It takes a little while for the sauce to congeal, but it is awesome, excellent.  This recipe is fool-proof!  Thank you Jennie!

This recipe completely suprised me, it was very good! I hesitated to make it because the chili/grape jelly sauce sounds strange but it is well worth it. A definite recipe to keep because it's so good, economical, quick and easy.

For years I've used this same sauce in a crock pot with 2 packages of lil smokies. Just heat until the smokies are hot throughout then turn down crock pot to lowest setting to keep warm.  They won't last long!

This can be used with frozen meatballs, but the homemade ones are much nicer.  Save time by cooking the meatballs right in the sauce - the meatballs really soak up the flavours.  If made a day ahead it's easy to skim off any fat.  If you find the sauce too sweet just adjust the ratio of grape jelly to chilli sauce to your taste. Freeze very well.

LOVE sauce!  This is now a regular at our house!  However we do it a little simpler and healthier.  Just use a bag of meatfree meatballs (Quorn is the best and all our meat lovers love them!)  Throw the frozen meatballs in with the cup of jelly and jar of chili sauce and you're done!  Add a little butter or shortening if you like a little oil in the sauce!  YUM!

Very good sauce.  I used it on premade cajun style chicken meatballs and they were very good.  Sweet sauce with the spicy meatballs worked out great.

Great recipe.  I think the grape jelly and chili sauce could be cut in half as there was a lot of sauce leftover.  Also, try cooking up some little smokies sausages in the leftover sauce - they are yummy too!

Excellent! The only change I made was to bake the meatballs instead of frying and I used 90% ground beef and baked on foil lined cookie sheets. To the sauce I added dry mustard and a little chili powder, but just a little!  Delicious!!!

These were a huge hit at my daughter's baby shower.  The only change I made was to bake the meatballs instead of frying them.  I used 90% ground beef and baked on foil lined cookie sheets.  There was almost no grease.  I also used Panko bread crumbs.  They are far superior to traditional bread crumbs.  The meatballs themselves were incredible.  This will be my new meatball recipe.

You can't go wrong with chili sauce and grape jelly.  These things are awesome!  I used pre-made meatballs, which makes it super easy.

I used store-bought meatballs like most people, but these were a buge hit at my work potluck today. I used sugar-free Smuckers grape jam, and added about 2 tbsp of medium hot sauce (not tabasco) to counter the sweet a bit. In case you are lost, the chili sauce can be found near the ketchup/condiments in the grocery. Super easy, will make again.

Well, this was not a success for me.  I brought these to an office party and they were barely eaten.  Noone went back for seconds and I didn't receive any compliments.  I personally thought the "grape" taste was a little strong and it was too sweet.  Definitely won't make these again.

I have been using this recipe since the 70's taken from a certain iconic lady's cookbook with the initials "BC".  My extended family always requests I bring this on holiday get-togethers (in the crockpot of course).  Men and kids love it!

These really are that good.  These were suppose to be an appetizer...we had an expensive honeybaked ham at our Christmas Eve buffet...but people ate the meatballs instead...they were putting them on rolls for sandwiches, eating them with crackers...all gone....who knew these would be so fabulous?  Used frozen Italian meatballs from Costco, cut down the jelly by 1/2 cup, used 2 tbsp Worchester sauce, 1 tsp. mustard powder.  Mixed the jelly mixture on the stove until hot, then poured it on the meatballs in a crockpot.  Took the hour journey to our party, and put it on high for 2 hours and they were perfect.  This recipe is a keeper!

These are good, but I'll stick to my favorite version of this recipe...add 1 can jellied cranberry sauce to the chili sauce and grape jelly. It gives it a sweet and sassy flavor.

For some reason I didn't enjoy this recipe very much, but my guest LOVED them! I think the grape jelly gives it too much of a sweet flavor i didn't care for much...would of liked the taste to have been more bbq flavored.

Great recipe, I made the following changes - used 1/2 lb. ground pork + 1/2 lb. ground beef because that's what I had on hand.  I made my own fresh bread crumbs.  Also, I experimented by cooking half the meatballs in a skillet and baking the other half in the oven for 20 minutes at 350 and then browning those for 2 minutes in the skillet after they had finished cooking.  The baked ones turned out better and were less messy.  In any case the sauce is crazydelicious, I'm going to start freezing meatballs and keeping grape jelly and chili sauce on hand for cocktail meatball craving emergencies.

I loved this recipe and it was the first time I have ever made meatballs.  Even my husband, who doesn't like meatballs, really liked these.  Like many other reviewers have said, I didn't fry them but instead baked them in the oven for about 25 minutes.  I also added them to my slow cooker after they were baked and left them in there with the sauces on low for a few hours.

I actually never got to taste these but my friends said they were good.  It says it makes 16 meatballs but next time I will cut those in half and have 32 smaller meatballs because they took too long to cook.

These were very well received at my party last night.  All were gone and I had to quickly make more.  I used the Italian frozen meatballs that are precooked (saves a lot of time).  I took another reviewers suggestion about adding worschester, hot sauce, garlic, and ground mustard.  I doubled the recipe then learned I didn't have enough grape jelly so I added some blackberry jelly.

Another party favorite and so easy to make.  I cheat and use frozen meatballs and then throw them in a crockpot for a few hours with the cocktail sauce and grape jelly.  They are always the first to go.

I made this recipe yesterday for a party I went to. I was a little leary because I really wanted to have "finger food" that people could just grab and go with.  After cooking the meatballs at home, I transferred them to a crockpot and placed some toothpicks beside them.  Everyone loved them!! They were the first thing gone from the table!!! I was so leary about the recipe. The ingredients seemed so odd, but tasted so great together!! I even used frozen meatballs and defrosted them and pan fried them before putting them in a sauce.  The whole thing was so easy and so wonderful! I doubled the recipe and there was enough sauce for a box of 64 meatballs. I can't wait to make it again!!

This was a huge hit at my sister's graduation party! I couldn't believe that chili sauce and grape jelly could taste so good together, who would have thought?? The longer you let the sauce cook the better tasting this gets! I'm not kidding this is so easy and it really taste wonderful! thanks. Becky

This recipe is awesome! Better double or even triple the recipe though - because they go FAST! I had approx 10 guests at my house this weekend and doubled the recipe that calls for 8 servings. They STILL went way too fast! (even though I had plenty of other hors d'oeuvres) Everyone LOVES them! Thanks Jennie!

These are so good!!  I used dry minced onion instead of the onion and baked my meatballs and sauce after searing them.  Delicious!  My family ate them over rice, but I had mine in lettuce wraps with carrot and bell pepper strips.

Tried this last night and everyone loved it including my 19 mth old son.  Couldn't be bothered to cook them in a skillet so I put them in a baking dish and baked them in the sauce. I used one bottle of Heinz chilli sauce and one bottle of Smuckers grape jelly. It can't get any easier than this!!

Get frozen meatballs if you are short on time.  I put these in a slow cooker for parties and always a hit.

I used this recipe as a base recipe, so I am reviewing it, even though I made some changes. I'm not going to go into all of the additions I made, (mostly cause I don't remember everything I added) but I do want to say this is a pretty good base recipe. I used Heinz chili sauce, which tasted like a slightly spicier version of ketchup and so with the grape jelly it tasted really ketchupy, so I would recommend adding some kind of spice to it, maybe smoke flavoring, and if you like your sauce sweeter, add more grape jelly, possibly some brown sugar. As for the meatballs, they were good, but had a strange texture to me, really mushy tasting, even though they were definitely cooked all the way through,. Not sure what the cause of the texture was or if they are supposed to be that way, but the flavor was pretty good.

I loved these.   I cheated and used Frozen Foster Farms Turkey Meatballs (about 1/2 bag) from Costco.  The sauce was really good.  I followed the suggestions of from reviewers and added a little worsteshire sauce, Dijon mustard and whole grain mustard to the sauce.

This recipe is the best.  I've made this 3 times for BBQ's and sporting events, and everybody wants me to bring "The Meatballs", it's a hit every time.  I had to change up the cooking procedure...I cooked the meatballs in the oven for about 15 to 20 min. then I put the meatballs in a skillet to secure the bond of the meatball and to sear it a little, and then put them in a crockpot for about 3 hours, other than that, this recipe rocks!

The meatballs were wonderful however; I am giving this a fourstar for the fact that I did change the sauce and baked the Meatballs rather than fry.  I Reduced the Grape Jelly to 3/4 cup as a previous review indicated.  I am glad I did as it would have been too sweet.  I also added some Grainy Mustard and little Worcestershire sauce and hot sauce for a kick.  Next time I am thinking I might add a few Red Pepper flakes.  My Family loved them and I will be making again!

Super easy recipe.  I cheated and used frozen meatballs from Sam's and no one knew the difference!  Served them at a family party with the best chef in the family there, and she raved about my meatballs.  I did NOT tell them they weren't from scratch!  Cooked in cast iron dutch oven first, then transferred to slow cooker on warm to serve.  Perfect!

These were a fun retro dish that I made for my daughter's birthday party.  All the grown-ups liked them and so did I.  I baked the meatballs instead of frying just for health reasons.  They were very tasty.  Would make again.

Yum!!! These are soo good! I used frozen meatballs  and cooked in oven. After they were finished I put in slow cooker with sauce and added 1 onion and 3 cloves of garlic. My 2 year old loved these and so did my husband. These are soo good! We will be making these again for sure! Enjoy!

When I made these meatballs, I wasn't as impressed as I had hoped to be. But after refrigerating and serving the next day, they were better. My friends really complimented me on these and have asked for them again.

This is a great recipe.  I don't fry the meatballs.  I just put them on a pan and cook them in the oven.  Then I turn them out into a slow cooker with the sauce ingredients, and cook for a about an hour on low.  They are always one of the first things to run out on the buffet.

This recipe was a real hit at my party.  I used 3 lbs. frozen meatballs, thawed and browned in shortening.  For the sauce I use 1 1/2 bottles Heinz chili sauce, 1 18-oz bottle grape jelly, and 1/2 c. jalepeno jelly for a little added "kick".  Wonderful.  I also served them the next nignt for dinner over brown rice as another reviewer suggested.

These were incredibly easy to make.
A few changes I made:
apparently, the instructions don't want you to drain off the shortening after frying the meatballs; I did and they were fine.
I whisked together the jelly and the chili sauce in a crock pot and then put the meatballs on top of that and spooned the sauce over them.  I let them go on high about an hour and then turned the setting to "keep warm."  They were very good and stayed moist and tender in the crockpot.
One change I would make, I think the meatballs have too much onion.  Ordinarily I love onion, but these didn't seem right with that much of it.  Next time I'll cut it in half or use just a bit of dehydrated onion.
Even better, I'll just buy a bag of frozen meatballs. LOL
The recipe is a keeper though.
Thanks!

I have made these many times over the past few years. No matter how many I make...there are NEVER any leftovers.  Never.  MAKING the meatballs from scratch really does make a difference.  :)  I've tried the frozen ones....it was fine.  But, scratch made is PERFECT.

This is the recipe I will use from now on!!  I baked my meatballs at 350 for about 20-25 min instead of pan cooking them.  My picky friends AND my two year old liked them too!!  I used 4 lbs of beef for Christmas gatherings this season (put them in the freezer until I need them) and I think the leftover meatballs themselves will be great in spaghetti sauce!

This is one of the first recipes that I ever learned to make. Used frozen meatballs from Sams Club. It couldn't be easier. The ingredients look strange but it really works. Like how the meatballs are glossy and glazed.

I used store bought meatballs. I just threw them in the crockpot with the jelly and chili sauce, stirred it up and that was it. I make these often for get togethers and I never have any leftovers

I have never had luck making meatballs, but thought Id give myself 1 last chance, and boy am I glad I did! These were so easy to make and I don't eat leftovers, but sure did these! The only thing I did different was I baked the meatballs instead of frying them, it cuts down on time this way also. Anyone wanting a truly wonderful meatball recipe needs this one! Thank you so much for the recipe, its a true keeper!

Excellent.  The first time I made these the meatballs were too delicate and some fell apart so I increased the bread crumbs to the same amount I use for the meatballs in spaghetti. I used frozen once and they just weren't as good. I also squeeze some lemon juice into the sauce.  I have been asked to bring these to several functions and they are always a hit. When people comment on these it's fun to tell them what's in the sauce, they never believe it.  I

After all the reviews of this recipe, I had to try it. Very odd combination. Took to lunch and everyone liked, but a little sweet. NOT good at all reheated the same night. Will not make again because this doesn't keep well and although different, I can think of better ways to cook meatballs.

I've been making these for years and they are a favorite with all my family.  It is well worth the trouble to make your own meatballs rather than using frozen so use your own favorite meatball recipe.  I also bake mine at 350 rather than fry, much healthier.  Then just melt the grape jelly and chili sauce and add the meatballs.  The slow cooker is a great way to keep them warm.

Pretty standard cocktail meatball.  Made this and Bourbon meatballs for sliders during our New Years eve bash, everyone liked them, but I thought they were too sweet.  I added soy sauce and chopped onions on my slider, which helped break up the sweetness, and then they were more to my liking.

I made the meatballs per the recipe, but baked them instead of frying them.  They came out moist and tender, no overwhelming flavor when they're plain.  I've used this sauce on little smokies before, and it's always a hit with the adults. I thought it was very good with the meatballs.

Wow we loved these. My mom used to make a recipe with grape jelly in her meatballs that I really enjoyed. This recipe might even be better than it was. Seriously even better after sitting a night in the refrigerator. The sauce is to die for. I didn't have ground beef on hand, so I used ground pork in it's place. I did not use the shortening or egg, but I did use leeks instead of onions. A major hit in my family.

I used 4 polish sausages, 1/2 package of ground beef, 1 egg, eyeballed the breadcrumbs, minced dried onion, and worcestershire sauce. I did not use milk, salt, or back pepper. I baked the meatballs at 350 till brown. For the sauce I used 12 oz of chili sauce, and about 3/4 c jelly, and set slow cooker to warm.

OMG! These are amazing! I used apricot jelly in place of grape because the meatballs are SOOO amazing. 

You are missing out if you don't make the meatballs--make a double batch right from the start! 

The meatballs by themselves are amazing and do not need any sauce. You can use them for Itailan dishes, snacks ANYTHING. I did make mine gluten free using a half rice-based "bread" crumb and half flax meal mixture.

Oh my goodness gracious. I have seen recipes similar to this before, but I was a bit skeptical about the grape jelly and chili sauce. Thank goodness I gave it a try, because OH MY STARS -- they were so good. I also tossed a few little smokies into the sauce because I was making pigs in a blanket and ran out of dough, and they tasted good in the sauce too. Super easy, deliciously tasty. Thanks!

First time I have tried these.  Very easy!  Next time I think I will add a little red pepper flake to the meat mixture for a little "Bang"!  I also baked mine in the oven vs. "frying" them and I added fresh grated parmasen cheese to the mixture as well.  I made the meatballs ahead (tripled the batch) and froze them.  I will be pulling these out and putting them in my crock pot for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day family gatherings!

I took these to a baby shower this weekend and everyone raved.  I used a 2.5# bag of frozen meatballs and doubled the sauce recipe.  It all fit in my crockpot.  I did have quite a few leftovers.  I probably could have just done the original recipe size and they would have all been gone.

I only used the sauce part of this recipe and opted for frozen meatballs.  The sauce came out great.  I added some Worcestershire sauce and salt and pepper.  My husband loved these!

I used frozen meatballs and simmered for 4 hours prior to serving.  It worked well.

I made a few changes...one, fresh breadcrumbs.  I didn't have any milk, so left it out and the meatballs turned out good.  Also, the shortening is not necessary.  I added a few dashes of hot sauce the the meatball sauce.  This was definitely not what I expected when I first read the ingredients, but ended up being very good.

Very simple to make and good flavor too.  The only change I made was to brown the meatballs for 8-10 min and then bake at 350 for appx 15 min. Will make again.

These were ok. They werent the best meatball i've ever had, but they certainly werent the worst either. My children (ages 7 and 3) did not like them. I might make them again if i need a party/potluck dish.

My meatballs weren't very tasty/tangy! I had trouble finding something that said 'chili sauce' at the store. Everything on the shelf said 'hot sauce' or 'enchilada sauce'. There were so many products with varying names for the type of sauce that I finally just picked one and I guess I must have picked wrong. Mine ended up tasting like watery ketchup.

I substituted cranberry sauce for the grape jelly, and used frozen meatballs.  It was just okay.  Half got eaten.  Probably will not make this again.

These just didn't do it for me. I wanted to like them because a friend of mine has a similar recipe that uses grape jelly, and hers are great, but I did not care for this recipe. The sauce tasted a little better than the meatballs, but I'll never make these again. I used ground sirloin, Italian bread crumbs, and baked the meatballs instead of frying them, but I can't imagine those changes making the difference between a five-star recipe and one that I threw away after a couple of bites.

These are very good meatballs and very, very easy to make.  I made them a second time this week - for a Valentines Party for mom's/kid's - and it was a hit!  I usually have a family Valentine dinner, so I used a big bag of frozen MB's from Sam's thinking there would be at least half a crockpot full of leftovers for the dinner - wrong!!  About a dozen were left because everyone just loved them.  I did make one addition this time and that was to add a can of cranberry jelly which changed up the flavor just a bit from the usual recipe that makes the rounds quite a bit!

I made the recipe even easier by simply buying frozen meatballs. Can't get any easier than this for a crowd. I also tried strawberry jelly and that worked well too.

These were so good. Everyone loved them. I baked the meatballs instead of frying them and kept them in the freezer for a few days. The day I needed them I put them in the crock pot with the sauce for about three or four hours. The extra time cooking in the sauce gave the meatballs a candied texture. Yummy!

Meatballs were amazing! I got so many compliments on them, even from people who normally don't like meatballs at all. Thumbs up. The sauce was really liked too, but to my taste a little too sweet.

These were a hit at our New Years party, and they re-heat very well. I used frozen Italian meatballs as some had said and that made it very simple and quick to make.

A good recipe.  The house smelled great making them and homemade is always better than frozen.  My guests didn't eat these up, though.  Now I'm wishing I'd done a bbq style so the leftovers would make good subs.

These were great!  I had a similar recipe at a our annual cocktail party that another guest always brought and I wanted to recreate it.  This did the job!  I didn't make the meatballs from scratch, but just mixed the jelly and chili sauce together with frozen 'homestyle' meatballs.  Everyone at my holiday party was raving over it!

These were pretty good. I didn't use the salt and baked the meatballs on a tray sprayed with canola oil. I froze them and then threw them in with the sauce a little while before the party. People didnt eat a lot of them. One person asked what the sauce was. They guessed bbq. I added some onion soup mix to the meatballs. They were excellent. Wish i would have kept more of them out of the sauce for other recipes! I froze the left over cocktail meatballs. We will see how they come out after reheating.

Love this recipe, different but great. It is a hit with my 9 year old autistic son  and husband. I made it many times. I brought it to parties and it was a hit. Highly recommend, because simple and it could be your parties next hit.

I made these to take to work for a friend of mine, so I had my husband try them the night before, and he really loved them. He said the sauce was very good too. I didn't tell him there was grape jelly in the sauce, he probably would have changed his mind about the sauce. I thought the meatballs were great, but I still don't have a taste for tomato sauce yet. I also baked the meatballs in the oven and they smelled so good.  I think I will bake any kind of meatballs I make from now on. Thanks for the recipe.

I brought these to a potluck and everyone enjoyed them.  They even used some of the sauce as gravy for turkey.  As recommended by another reviewer, I baked the meatballs for 20 minutes at 375 degrees instead of frying them.  They were good, but I think the Cajun Appetizer Meatballs (from this website) are better!

Great recipe - I made my own milk free meatballs one time and bought frozen meatballs the second.  The home made meatballs were a bigger hit but both went over well.  Oh yes - I increased the ratio of sauce for meatballs and made in crockpot.

I made about 600 meatballs for my receptions and froze them 2 weeks ahead of time.   I made the sauce the afternoon of the reception, and so all the girls I hired had to do was throw the thawed meatballs in the sauce!  (I had those tin heater catering things, so it was kept warm all night)  There wasn't one meatball left! Perfect for big gatherings because you can prepare in advance.

This was our 1st attempt at meaballs, these were easy to make and looked great but only tasted average. I thought they needed something else added to the meat, dont know exactly what tho. We added a packet of dry onion soup mix to the sauce mixture. Thanks!

The best meatballs we've ever had.  Made them for our Christmas party and they were gone within 10 minutes, made more for our kids and again they ate them right up and were asking for more.

this recipe makes delicious "5 star" meatballs. i omitted the salt (since this calls for worchestershire sauce) & baked them at 375 for about 20 minutes. the simmering sauce is okay but nothing special. overall, this is a festive dish to serve. thanks jenny!

My mother made a recipe like this for every party she ever gave. SOmetimes she used the cocktail franks and they were good too.  I use the frozen meatballs from costco and add this sauce -yummy and easy!  Just make the sauce and add to meatballs in a crockpot.  Let it simmer all day.

This is hands down the best recipe for cocktail meatballs.  I have also baked these in the oven and then transfered to a crockpot or warmer.  They are always empty by the end of an event and always requested.

Really good recipe.  I made the meatballs and froze them before the party.  I would recommend using a bit more bread crumbs and some fell apart pretty easily.  Great recipe though and everyone at them right up!

This is delicious exactly as written! And I will likely adapt the meatballs to other dishes. They were "simple" but really tasty. No changes were made - nor did they need to be. My family enjoyed for Christmas Eve buffet - none were left.

These were absolutely *delicious* for my first time making meatballs!! A couple of notes though: definitely do NOT overmix the meat with the breadcrumb mixture. I was wondering why the meatballs tasted quite HEAVY and this is why. Nothing is mentioned in this recipe about it, I just came across that note in a completely different meatball recipe and it makes sense. They are still quite tasty, but that is just an important note. Second, I followed Amydoll’s notes to make these which were all spot on except for not adding add’l salt. I left out the salt like she said, but the cooked meatballs ended up tasting a little bland, so I had to add on salt to the crockpot after the fact. You definitely do NOT need to add a full TEASPOON, maybe 1/2 tsp, but I did think it needed more, and that the worchestshire wasn’t enough salt. Other than that, I subbed onion powder for actual onion, and baked instead of fried. It took a lot for me not to finish these on my own before the guests arrived!! The sauce makes them soooo tasty!!! Who knew grape jelly would add such a great flavor?!? Thank you for this WONDERFUL recipe!!

I used frozen meatballs from Costco- just put them in the crock pot with the jelly and chili sauce and let it all cook.  I did add a bit of mustard and Worcestershire sauce as someone recommended.   It was an easy and delicious recipe that everyone at the party enjoyed.

Tried this recipe for a pot luck dinner, and it went over well.  The one tip I read previously was a good one:  put the dry stuffing mix in a plastic bag (half at a time) and use a rolling pin to crush it finer so the meatballs don't have lumps of bread in them.  I blended the meatball ingredients together before adding the meat.  That way you're only trying to incorporate one thing into the meat, much easier.  I'll make this again.

I make this atleast once a week for my husband, it's one of his favorites! I'm a terrible cook, so this simple dish is perfect for me, I love everything about it and don't change anything. The chili sauce and grape jelly is so strange but works perfectly together!

5-stars for the sauce, even made frozen meatballs taste good so I can only imagine how good it would be if the meatballs were good on their own as well.

I made the meatballs, set them aside and then made the sauce.  Luckily I waited too taste the sauce before I put the meatballs in, it was not to my liking at all.   
Just not my taste I guess.  I used another sauce recipe.  The meatballs were great though.

I made these meatballs for a fight party and they were not bad, but not good enough to make again.  I would rate them as just average.  The sauce is missing a couple of spices to add more flavor.

I have made this many times and it is a big hit each time.  I double the recipe everytime because there are never enough.  I bake them in the oven for approx. 30+/- minutes at 325.  I then slowly simmer in sauce for an hour or so before gathering.  You really cannot mess these up.

Super easy (because I used Italian meatballs from Sam's Club)! Kids loved them. Adults loved them (especially the guys!) and there was much whining when they were all gone. Plus I put meatballs and sauce into crockpot and just left to simmer for a few hours and they were ready by party time. What could be easier?

I am just reviewing the sauce as well because for time saving reasons I used prepared meatballs.  It was just not what I expected and I probably will try a different recipe next time.  To me it was just OK.

These were great! I am really just reviewing the sauce though, because I used frozen meatballs since time was short. My husband and 2 year old also loved them. These were so easy and delicious. They were even better than a from-scratch gourmet magazine recipe that I've tried. Amazing. A must try! Thanks for this recipe.

These were a Big hit at my office party I took them too. They were gone with in minutes, and everyone wanted the recipe. Thanks for this recipe, I always take little smokies to Christmas dinner, this year I am also taking these. One thing I changed was after that skillet, I put in oven to continue cooking before adding to Crockpot.

I had high hopes for this recipe and made it to go over rice for dinner.  There were three of us and all the meatballs got eaten, but I wasn't terribly impressed with the flavor... I'll try a different sweet and sour sauce next time, but thanks for the recipe!

Wicked good meatballs.  Everyone raved.  Changes I made: I cut the onions down a bit - but that is a personal taste.  I used Extra Virgin Olive oil in place of shortening.

These were pretty good.  I used a 16oz bag of frozen meatballs that I heated up in the oven.  The sauce is tasty but seems like it's missing something.

I made this for our Christmas pot luck at work and they were great.  It was my first attempt at home made meatballs and I was quite impressed. I used ground turkey instead of beef and baked the meatballs then added them to the sauce. I let them marinate overnight and the next day they were excellent.

I have not responded to most recipes, although all of the 5*s are definitely 5.  I used frozen turkey meatballs and my party gulped the meatballs and rushed to used the extra sauce to dip their bread.  This is definitely a party favorite.

Excellent appetizer.  I made this for a group of girlfriends and they loved it.  My kids also devoured them.  I did cut back on the jelly a bit and it was still sweet.

I am giving this recipe 4 stars because my husband and others thought these meatballs were great, but they weren't what I had expected. They tasted like meatloaf. I was a little disappointed, but they were eaten. These just weren't what I was looking for, but thanks!

These were pretty good.  I've made a recipe like this before but lost it several years ago.  I thought this one would be the same but it wasn't. The sauce is good, but the meatballs were missing something -  kind of bland.  I'll make them again, but I'll jazz them up a bit.

I thought this recipe was easy to make. It was surprisingly tasty and was even better the second day. Although the meatballs did fall apart a bit,  it's a great recipe that is sure to please!
These would definitley fly off the plate at any party!

Very good!!! Used frozen meatballs and turned out Wonderful! Put them in a warm crockpot for serving.  The only thing wrong with using the frozen meatballs is that they retain to much moisture which means trying to eat these the next day was not the great, but they are wonderful in eaten within a few hours.

mmm mmm good!!  I made this recipe, and it is sweet, but oh so good!  The flavor is almost addictive.  For leftovers I bought some good hoagie bread, swiss cheese slices, and slapped some cocktail meatballs w/its sauce, heated it up in oven for just the cheese to melt, top off w/shredded lettuce...OH MY GOODNESS! FINGER-LICKIN' GOOD.  Thanks!

I was skeptical about using the jelly, but the sauce turned out fine. Let them sit in the crock pot for awhile after cooking...they taste better the longer they are heated.

I used this recipe for a New Years Eve party for the first time.  Everyone raved over the taste and when I told them that the sauce contained grape jelly they couldn't believe it.  Not only is the sauce excellent but the meatballs are very moist and delicious! Thanks for this one!
