I made this today and it was VERY good, although I did tweek it a little.  Instead of the sugar, I used honey.   I also added a few dashes of tabasco and left out the rice vinegar.  I will definitely be making this again!!!

I made this for my family. My 3 year old said "YUM! I WIKE THIS CHICKEN MOM!" 
I didn't have any green onions so I used finely chopped red onion and I left out the corn starch because I thought the sauce thickened up nicely.
It isn't very spicy. I thought it tasted more like terriyaki chicken wings.

Mildly spicy but then again, perfect for a party appetizer since not everyone appreciates killer hot like I do. Very tasty though. I like to double bake wings for a thick saucy coating, so I mixed them in the sauce and put them back in to bake for another 15 minutes or so at a lower temp, then put back in the sauce again for the final coating. Perfect!

Recipe calls for Kikkoman Soy sauce but there's no where in the instructions to add.  Smells good but I'm having trouble believing no one else is mentioning that up front.

Love this sauce!  I did add teriyaki and used onion powder, but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  Thanks!

We have made these several times and they are delish. The key is the draining halfway through the cooking time so they don't get soggy. Instead of putting in a baggie and shaking, I just brush the sauce on and let it cook longer.

These were a big hit. I added about a tbsp of crush red peppers to give it a little more kick. Will definitely be saving this recipe. Adds great variety.

I followed the recipe but doubled the sauce and dry-rubbed the chicken with a garlic-paprika mix. Fabulous!
