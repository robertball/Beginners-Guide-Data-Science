I give this 5 stars, but I made some changes.  Instead of adding juice, I used the syrup that comes in the can with canned peaches.  I didn't have to add sugar.  If you like sweet and spicy add some ground cayenne pepper.  This entire recipe I added the ingredients to taste, so I had to keep adding this and that until I thought it was perfect.  I added some red food coloring to make it look more appetizing.  Also before I added to the chicken before baking, I took the sauce and simmered it on the stove to just as you would if you were making preserves.  It was so great my picky eaters ate it up quick. After experimenting on my family, I gave some to my next door neighbors and they loved it.  I served it with stir fry veggies and jasmine rice.

I loved the sweetness of this, but I would change things a little bit.  I used fresh fruit only and very ripe fruit.  I also could not find the juice suggested so I used a tropical blend from bi-lo with carrot and fruit juices in it.  The juice was great.  I'd definately peel the plums next time and leave the peelings out. I will also be dumping ALL of the fruit mixture on the uncooked chicken.  I found I liked the taste of the fruit better when cooked into a glaze on the hot chicken.  I also left out the pepper flakes.. I might try those next time. I served this with lightly buttered rice and sweet corn.

I hesitated to review this, but loved the results I got when I tweaked the recipe.  My fruit was very ripe.  I thought I had peaches, but had nectarines, so I used a nectarine. I didn't have the vegetable juice drink, so I subbed 1/8 cup Fresca (because it sounded like the sauce was thin in the original recipe) and after tasting, added more red pepper flakes.  The grapefruit taste in the Fresca made this fabulous.  I cooked the chicken on the stovetop, browning and then adding the sauce. Served with white rice. Very good. Thanks, Don, for suggesting this!

I did not care for this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly.

I tried this recipe for the first time tonight, but I simply used apple juice instead of a veggie and fruit blend.  I thought it tasted fine, but I might try peeling the plums and peaches next time.  The fragments of the skins present after putting the sauce through a food processor gave it a strange texture and added a little bitterness to the taste. I definitely want to try this again!

I liked this a lot!  Both spicy and sweet. I added some cayenne pepper. I used just stir fry chicken that was pre cut, and it cooked in 30 mins. Easy, quick and delicious!

I enjoyed this dish and it was pretty easy to make.  I do agree with the previous reviewer that the sauce tastes better cooked.  The salt and pepper on the chicken infuse the sauce while cooking,  taming the tartness of the fruit.  This took 35 minutes to bake..

The only difference that I had made was to add a couple tablespoons of honey to sweeten it up a little. Delicious!
