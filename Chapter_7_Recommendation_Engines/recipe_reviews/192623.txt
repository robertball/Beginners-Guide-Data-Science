Some of my all-time favorite ingredients in one bowl!  I've made it twice this week, and it's fail proof.  Used green Thai peppers (very hot!) but I think the red ones would be more aesthetically pleasing.  Second time I made it i used 3 cukes because the first time there was a lot of leftover dressing.  Perfect for a late dinner salad.

This was so yummy!  I didn't salt the cucumbers before (just didn't have time) and they did water things down a bit, so I just added a little more vinegar and suger.  I also only used 1 tablespoon of the sesame oil (very strong flavor)and added red pepper flakes and green onion too.

Love it!  I omitted the fresh red chile peppers and substituted them with red pepper flakes.  I also added a chopped green onion.  This makes a LOT of "dressing".  Even after adding another cucumber, I still had a lot left over.  You could half the liquid ingredients and still have plenty.  Very yummy!  Will definitely make again.

I reduced the salad dressing by half and still had quite a bit of it. I added some red onion and was glad i did because it might have been a bit bland without it. The dressing is very good, I did use fresh ginger and garlic and let the salad marinate for about three hours before eating. Served with Honey Ginger Salmon on this website.

Very good, and loved by our whole family (including 2 teens who aren't big on cucumbers).  Still a great recipe if you happen to be lacking ginger and can't get it. Red pepper flakes work if you are lacking the chilis.  I like to let it sit for half an hour in the fridge so the cucumbers really pick up the flavor.

I had a cucumber salad at a Thai restaurant and was looking for something similiar to make at home.  This was very close.  Tasted great.  I thought it was better the 2nd day after marinating in the vinegar mixture overnight.

This is a great change of pace from the standard vinegar cucumber recipe.  I left out the peppers because I don't like spicy.

This was good. Nice mix of flavors and a great way to use up the plethora of cucumbers during the summer. I didn't have any peppers or sesame seeds on hand, so threw in some green onions. Was a hit at the dinner table.

These were pretty good. I didn't have any fresh chile peppers so I used cayenne pepper. Next time I will cut the vinegar and sugar in half, they were a little too overpowering.

Followed directions and it turned out great!  Agree that it has plenty of dressing and could probably halve that.

Delicious! Pretty spicy but I loved it. Might use half as many red chile peppers next time. Very easy to make too. Will definitely make this one again.

The flavors in this salad are wonderful. I used red pepper flakes because it was all I had and mine turned out a little too spicy for me. I will have to figure out the right heat level for me. Good recipe, though and really delicious!

I didn't read all of the reviews before I made it. I was in a hurry, liked the ingredients and printed it out.  Agree that there is LOTS of dressing.  Very tasty though!  Next time I will use less dressing and toss in some crab! Thanks for the recipe

Light and refreshing summer salad. Perfect to serve with either lunch or dinner. I couldn't find the peppers, so took the advice of other reviewers and used green onions and red pepper flakes. It was delicious. If possible, chill both the dressing and the sweated cucumbers. Delicious when served chilled.

Tasty, simple, and my 3 year old ate it! Didn't have red chili peppers so I substituted a bit of Asian garlic chili sauce (Siracha) which seemed to work well!

Delicious salad. I used a mandolin but I think this made the slices to thin and kind of wimpy so next time I'll be slicing thinker. 

I added red onion which I think really made the dish both asthetically pleasing and yummy. I soaked the onions in the vinegar for a bit to kill of some of the harsh onion flavor which sometimes overtakes a dish when using uncooked onion. Just left it sitting in the vinegar while I cut up the ginger and allowed the cucumbers to dehydrate. I also just added a sprinkling of crushed red peppers (why take a trip to the store when I had everything else! lol) instead of red chilis. Came out perfect.

This has become a staple in my house!  I have tried variations of this dressing for cabbage and it is wonderful.  I omit the sugar every time and use a pineapple vinegar.  Also, red pepper flakes are good instead of chili peppers.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

very good flavor!  We have made this on many occasions, and the spices can be exchanged for fresh herbs instead when we want to have it with other meals.

Fantastic twist on cucumber salad. I added some tomato and onion, but the dressing is the star here. I served it with grilled teryaki chicken and steamed rice for an easy summer dinner.

I love the Asian cucumber salad in Thai restaurants and was eager to try this.  I made it for Easter dinner and it was a huge success!  I used the mandolin to slice the cucumbers very thin and didn't have peppers so used red pepper flakes instead. Also I substituted Stevia in place of sugar since I'm trying to be low carb!  I was looking forward to leftovers but sadly, there wasn't a lot!

8.5.16     Whew-eeeee, this will clear your nasal passages.  Those red chili peppers bring a powerful kick to this salad, but it still has an excellent balance of spicy-sweet, and the crunchy cukes give it just the perfect texture.  Used a small seedless cucumber, sliced whole and black sesame seeds for a pop of color, but other than that, I followed the recipe to the letter.   I wouldn't change a thing, we loved it!

The dressing is spot-on to what I've had in restaurants. I made the dressing and let it chill in the fridge by itself for a few hours first. Then about an hour before I served, I mixed in the dressing with the veggies. You probably only need to make half the dressing for this amount of cucumber. I added in some green onion and cilantro - yum!

made as directed then decided to add red onion for more flavour per another review.  This tasted great, my only complaint would be that the cucumber was a tad too salty.  I will try either using less salt or draining for less time.

Per my taste, made as is = 4 stars.  Made with the few changes others recommended and per my families preferences, = 5 stars but this is a great base for light, cool and refreshing summer side salad or we added to Asian chicken salad as an add on ingredient and it really enhanced that recipe.  Here's what others suggested...Instead of chili pepper, use 1 tsp. chili oil.  Add in red onion and tomatoes to the marinade as it complements the salad if using as side salad.  Cut the sugar in half unless you like it REALLY sweet. Thanks for sharing.

This is yummy. Everybody liked it. Spaced and forgot to put the sesame seeds and pepper in and it was still great. Bet it would be even better if I added the other ingredients.  Only made half of the dressing and it was still too much for the amount of cucumber.

Really good! I halved the recipe & used 1 cucumber. I think half the dressing would be plenty for 2 cucs as well.  Yummy! I have already made this twice.

Excellent! I left out the chile peppers because I was serving this as a cooling dish beside spicy shrimp szechuan. It was perfect and I will def make this again.

This is a great salad.  I used ginger paste and did not seed or salt the cucumbers. My children love this recipe!

No changes to this recipe it is A-OK. The dressing made enough for possibly 4 more cucumbers I used 2. The Red Peppers I used were Santa Fe I think and they worked great.

This was a hit with everyone! I used chile sesame oil and reduced it to 1 tbsp, and reduced peppers down to 2 serranos. Also, per other reviews, used much more cucumber with the same amount of dressing.

My husband liked it so much he said this is the only way he wants to eat the cucumbers from our garden from now on!

Delicious! I've made this one several times now and everyone who tries it loves it! It does make a great deal of dressing so I usually use between 4 and 6 cucumbers. I've also found that it gets better the longer it sits so plan accordingly.

I added a few thin slices of red onion instead of peppers. Next time I may add a little water instead of the whol amount of vinegar. Went great with my chicken Satay.

Tasty! I halved the peppers and used red jalapeños since the grocer didn't have chiles. There was plenty of dressing left over - might dip a few raw green veggies in it as a snack later. Easy to make. Not a stunner but a nice light salad. Will make again with pepper modification.

So so delicious! Lots of sugar, so I used a tablespoon of brown sugar instead. These peppers can be hot!!! Next time, I may mix in another veggie and cut the peppers in half.

**Yummy**...I wouldn't rate it unless I made it exactly as stated and I did with great results and little effort.  This cucumber salad is wonderful, light & refreshing! It has just the right amount of sweet, spice & texture and would accompany a variety of meat, chicken & fish dishes. A helpful hint is to use a mandolin to slice your cucumbers you get perfect uniform cucumber slices fast & easy in seconds!

Amazingly delicious - for as long as cucumbers are in season this will be in my refrigerator. I seeded the pickling cucumbers from my yard and used stevia for the sugar - which worked out really well.

I halved it, using half an English cucumber, thinly slicing and not peeling and adding chopped scallions. As others mentioned, there was a lot of liquid, so I just drained some off. Cut back a bit on the sesame oil because it can be a strong flavor and you can always add more. No fresh ginger so added a few shakes of dry and red pepper flakes in place of the chile peppers. Very good with leftover Asian Lettuce Wraps (without lettuce!) from this site (and highly recommended) and sesame ginger rice. A nice complement to Asian-inspired dishes, especially the spicier ones! Thanks sandradxb!

I'm rating this recipe 5 stars because I left out the 4 chile peppers because if the kidlets. With this modification, the kids loved it but I will definitely use the red chile peppers next time. Maybe start with 1 and gradually increase every time I make it.

LOVE THIS! Tastes just like the cucumber salad I like from a local sushi restaurant. To add protein, I added some steamed snow crab to this recipe.

Excellent! I did not have rice vinegar, so I used sushi vinegar (which is just rice vinegar with salt and sugar) and just nixed the sugar, with salt to taste. It's fantastic by itself, but I love it served over cold leftover sushi rice.

I made this dish and served it with the Honey ginger grilled salmon as another person had suggested. The only change I made to this was to add spring onions. It is a fabulous dish. My entire family loved it! We had no leftovers!

Very good! I added red onion. The red chili pepper was sweet and didn't add much spice so I added a TBS of Sambal (ground red chili pepper/very spicy). Maybe if you want it spicy add Thai red chili peppers instead.. This recipe is so fresh and a great side dish or snack.

I was looking for a salad that used primarily cucumbers since I have an abundance in my garden. I made this before work so I didn't have the hour to salt and let the cukes sit to drain. I did it for 20 minutes and nothing really happened but the salad was still really good so maybe it's an optional step. I cut the amount of salt and sugar in half and it was still plenty seasoned and sweet for my taste. I didn't have any peppers on hand so I used a carrot which I cut in matchsticks instead. The amount of dressing was a more than needed to cover the veggies but it was good so that was ok. Will definitely be making this again and will try it with the peppers next time.

This was ok, but not something I'd make again.  Subbed red pepper flakes for thai chilies.

i've made this many times and its the best! tastes very authentic to what i've had in japanese restaurants. if i don't have ginger or garlic or sugar i use the powdered kind and honey and its still good. very vital that you use seasoned rice wine vinegar and that you let the cucs drain and rinse! once i forgot to rinse and the recipe was still good but tasted more like pickles/garnish than a salad.

The sauce is so addicting! I kept finding myself tasting it while I was waiting the hour for the cucumbers to drain. 
*Update, the next day it became salty and more pickle like. It was still good but different. I think next time I will skip the salting/drain/rinse step, which I did rinse them very well. Why bother? Perhaps I will just blot the sliced cucumbers with paper towels, to avoid the over saltly flavor.

Loved this recipe! I used an english cucumber so there was no need to seed it. Plus I used nice large red Asian finger peppers that have a good amount of heat to them and this was a delicious side dish to a stir fry I made. The stir fry wasn't a keeper but this sure was! It's in my recipe box and It will be a regular.
