Everybody loved these!  I used 3 - 8 oz bags of shredded cheese and it worked out fine.

I altered the recipe as follows: used Extra Sharp Cheddar, appox. 1 lb chopped fresh roasted Hatch green chilies, and a pinch of salt and chili lime seasoning in the eggs. Awesome!

This was so good!  I switched it up and added some onions, bell peppers, and tomatoes.  Good way to get out of making omelets!  Boyfriend loved it!

Simple, easy, tasty!  My boss loved that I finally made a carb friendly appetizer for our meeting!  I added a dash of garlic powder and onion powder to the mixture.  Excellent!

This is very versatile and great for low carb dieters!  I have added browned sausage, onions, mushrooms with huge success.  Everyone loves this!

My husband and I have switched to a grain-free diet, and this recipe served as a great starting place for a versatile lunch or dinner option for us.  I added some lightly sauteed onions, red and green bell pepper, broccoli and mushrooms to the chilies to increase the vegetables, and cut the amount of cheese in half because two pounds is A LOT of cheese.  The chilies really gave this dish a great flavor!  My husband, who was skeptical at first, loved this dish.  This was a great, new way for us to eat up all the eggs that we get from our chickens.  Cut into 12 squares, each serving was a protein-rich 200 calories. :-)

Just a funny note. First,the picture shows it in a round pie dish, but it talks about cutting it into squares. Second, it makes "seven cups" ??. So how big are the squares to equal calorie count per serving? I'm going to make this because it sounds great. But can someone proof-read the page.

Very good.  I felt it needed a little something extra and think I'll add some seasoning next time, although I'm not sure what.  I did add some sour cream on top as a garnish, which was great.

Excellent!  Simple! Delicious!  I used jack/colby mix and was inspired to maybe try pepper jack next time.  Great recipe.. thanks for sharing.

This dish went untouched at our family get together.  I think that it needs something added to it, shredded chicken, olives or something to add a little flavor.

Good recipe but it is a little bland. It tastes like it is missing something. I will try it again but use half cheddar & half pepper jack.

This was a welcome delish dish on a morning when I was feeling a tad lazy and dragging my feet to work. Whipped it up and presto Breakfast done right and oh so Yummy! Used queso fresco and dried onions. My DS CJ loved it as much as his dad did:) Could not be easier! 5 minute prep, have another cup of coffee and grab tortillas, you can eat it on that drive to work! Keeper Thanks CJRogers:)
