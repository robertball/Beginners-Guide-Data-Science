I made these for a football party.  Quite tasty!  I'm wondering if you could save a step and just buy the hot dogs with the cheese already in it?!  Be sure to grease the pan well, otherwise you have a hard time getting them out without tearing them up.

Didn't have the Velvetta cheese so I used what I had in the fridge.  Turned out very tasty.  Also, I used a homemade corn muffin batter, not the box.

Yummy and easy. Don’t fill the container up too far, otherwise the volume of the dogs may push out the batter. I used some leftover grated cheddar and I don’t taste the cheese. Will have to try the cube, next time. Could probably put grated carrots? Zucchini? I’m the mix. Next time

The recipe is genius in it's simplicity.  The flavors are good, however,  after reading the other reviews,  I headed the advice & well greased my favorite shiny aluminum muffin tins with my usual,  never fails me solid Crisco. 75% of these stuck in their cup or fell apart upon removal! If I ever make again,  ABSOLUTELY will only do so with liners in muffin cups!

I don't know what I was expecting considering the ingredient list. This was rather plain. I prepared a jiffy muffin mix as directed. I bought velveeta slices and wrapped half a slice around each quarter beef hot dog. Next time I'll add shredded cheese to the cornbread mix and chop up half a hot dog for each muffin.
