I thought this was perfect!  Omitting the coconut- Yes it is chemicals-  and doubling the vanilla, it came out like International Delight Coldstone which is my absolute favorite!  Thank you for sharing this terrific recipe- i think I might try half and half next time to cut the fat a bit.

Not the recipe I had hoped it would be. Claims to not have "added chemicals" but that's what the coconut extract is, and you CAN taste it. If anyone knows where to find natural coconut extract (not imitation - i.e. chemicals) please let me know!!!

I followed the recipe exact, only making a lighter version with fat free half-n-half, lowfat milk and Truvia. This is off the charts delicious. My coffee tastes decadent.

This wasn't what I was hoping it would be. There was an aftertaste that I didn't care for.

This turned out fine. I made half a batch and added a bit more heavy cream to it. I might try it again.
