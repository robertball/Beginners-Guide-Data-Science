This was a great dish.  Will definitely make again!  I didn't change anything on the recipe except I did double up on the garlic, orange juice and Picante sauce(I used Tostito's Salsa instead) there was not much sauce otherwise.  Topped with cheddar cheese is an excellent addition.

It wasn't anything too exciting. Tasted like chicken with salsa on it; which really is what it is. It was easy though and pretty good.
