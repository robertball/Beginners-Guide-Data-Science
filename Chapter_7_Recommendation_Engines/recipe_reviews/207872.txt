Hi everyone! I submitted this recipe and since coming up with it have started to substitute about 1/4 cup storebought pesto for the basil, parm and garlic. It's easier and I think even tastier! The marinated tomatoes are a MUST!

WOW - traditional Italian meets classic American! These flavors combine to make one tasty burger! This is definitely not your average "run of the mill" burger, but something more along the lines of the "gourmet". Be sure to marinate your tomatoes at room temperature. I added some chopped basil to the mix along with a bit of minced garlic. For the meat mixture, I cut back just a bit on the Parmesan cheese and basil and added a bit more tomato paste. If you don't want to add the tomato paste, you could easily sub in some chopped sun-dried tomatoes. Next time, I might add those in anyway because I love 'em! These smelled wonderful on the grill and tasted even better. We served them with a mix of melted mozzarella and provolone along with the tomatoes on toasted crusty Italian rolls - YUM!

Delizioso!!! . 

I find your recipe absolutely delightful! I used your suggestion of substituting basil pesto for the basil, parmesan and garlic mixture, another reviewer suggestion of using sun dried tomatoes in lieu of tomato paste and yet another suggestion by another reviewer of using Ciabatta bread which I brushed with a bit of garlic infused extra virgin olive oil and lightly toasted.

This is a great alternative to a traditional burger.  I prepared an Italian spread and the burger was the main dish.  My guests loved it.  Also I used Ciabatta bread instead of a traditional hamburger bun.

This was so good! I used turkey instead of beef and didn't use tomato paste because I didn't want to open a whole can just for a tablespoon. I'm sure it's good with it, but everyone liked them just the way they were.

I made these mouth-watering burgers and loved them.  I did not have fresh basil...I used 80% lean HB and a different kind of cheese on top of each burger.  I used the canned parmesan instead of grated.. probably would have been better... but they tasted great anyhow!  next time I will try every ingredient to a tee just to see if they taste a wee better... great meal Sarah S.!

great alternative to the typical boring burger!  i added a few things which is why i only gave it 4 starts, i deviated from the original recipe quite a bit.  i added itialian bread crumbs, roasted red peppers drained, and a few sprigs of fresh oregano.  my friend and her daughter over for supper loved them...and her daughter is only 3!!!  i put these on toasted ciabatta rolls...YUM

Delicious!  Served on Hawaiian sandwich buns with a little mayo.  For anyone wary to open up a whole can of tomato paste for just a small amount, just divide up the rest into small sandwich baggies in small amounts (1 tablespoon each ought to do it) and then toss all those baggies into a quart sized freezer bag labeled and dated and freeze for later use.  They'll defrost fairly quickly under running warm water.

Being a big fan of Caprese salad which I have always made with a reduced balsamic vineger (which changes the whole vinegar taste) I can see where some reviewers would not care for the vinegary taste.  I did not marinate the tomatoes in the vinegar but added it (the reduced version) as a condiment on presentation.  Stayed truer to the to the Caprese idea.  Just be sure to have large leaf basil for the greens for the finish.

Good for a quick and easy burger.  I made these in the winter, so I pan fried them.  My husband really liked these.

I wasn't real excited about this. I like caprese salad and I like burgers, but the two flavors were just really odd together. The only change I made was adding salt and using 1/4 tsp. of dried basil, to fresh, per another similar recipe. I broiled them on the middle of the rack and nearly caught the oven on fire. So, be careful if cooking them that way instead of grilling. I was not sure why, they were so greasy, because I used 90 percent lean beef. I can only assume it was because of the parmesan cheese. The black pepper and basil taste was a little too strong for me too.

Fabulous!  As suggested by the lady who posted the recipe, I substituted basil pesto for the fresh basil, Parmesan and garlic.  Boy, was that easy.  I pan fried these and put the mozzarella on after flipping and cover with a lid to help it melt. Then I served the burger on a ciabatta roll.  Yum. Yum.

We really enjoyed these. As the submitter suggested, I used pesto (sun-dried tomato) and just a bit more chopped basil. Cooked them indoors because it was late and I didn't want to take the time to go back and forth to the grill. Served on Italian sub rolls cut in half. Will definitely make again.

This recipe was great. I used Ground chicken instead. It was really great. Also I cooked in a skillet instead of the grill. My husband LOVED it and wants me to make again. Thanks for the recipe.. It ROCKS!!!!

a tip for a small amount of tomato paste.  When I open the can I put any remaining sauce on a piece of saran by the tablespoon, twist the top to seal and put in the freezer.  Next time you need a small amount there it is.  Loved these burgers and I use home made pesto.

Wonderful recipe! I like the substitution of basil pesto as well, but either way is perfection. You can also go "vegetarian" and use portobello mushrooms, Remove the gills. Spread the mixture of tomato paste, basil, Parmesan, garlic and pepper on the underside. Preheat the grill to medium. Lightly oil the grill. Cover and grill 15-20 minutes, top with mozzarella, allow to melt and serve topped with marinated tomato.

This burger was excellent, it will become one of our family favorites for sure.  We served it on potato buns, and we marinaded the mozzarella right along with the tomato. We also served a salad with romaine, grape tomatoes, and pine nuts, topped with Balsamic glaze for dressing.

I've made the burger now twice and will make it again. Both my family and my boyfriend's family have loved it. I say the toasted ciabatta roll is a must and I also used the tube of basil which I think mixes better then chopped basil and tastes as good. I also used a little garlic powder along with fresh garlic. I had better luck when the meat is really chilled and the patties are made by hand instead of a burger press. When I used the press the burgers fell apart a little.

I made the burgers as the original recipe was submitted, not with the submitters revisions, and we loved it.  I'm sure it will be just as good with her revisions, which I will try the next time.  The burger was moist and full of flavor.  We really enjoyed the marinated tomatoes on this burger. The only thing that could have made this better, is if I would have had homemade hamburger buns......there is always next time.  With the start of grilling season upon us, I know we will be having this one again!

Just made these for the first time and they were as good as they sound. I served them on nice crusty rolls because they deserve it and added a splash more balsamic on top because my daughter and I love it. They were absolutely delicious!

Made this using pesto sauce, (without the tomato cause I didn't have one) ;-( just to try the flavor.  I thought it might be overpowering, but it was Excellent!  Yum-yum!!  Great on the grill.  Will make it again WITH the tomato!

We love caprese salad so this recipe caught my eye.  I made it as written with the exception of using tomato sauce instead of paste, which seemed to work just fine.  This was good, but we didn’t seem to get the wow factor we were looking for.  I may try this again using the basil pesto, as suggested by the submitter.

The flavor is great, and I'm looking forward to trying the author's suggestion of store bought pesto in place of parm/garlic/basil. As is, it's a little mild. I probably would have thrown a few basil leaves on top of the burgers if I'd had any leftover, but they were still delicious.

These were fantastic!  I used turkey instead of beef because of my hubby's cholesterol restrictions and my calorie restrictions.  It was excellent.  I also used a 25-year traditional balsamic and white truffle olive oil on the tomato and it really made the flavor of the burger.  Thanks for the great recipe.  This is a keeper!

OMG this is the best. The only thing we did as others suggested was serve on ciabatta buns (which you'll need cause these are juicy) and used a mayo & pesto sauce we did to taste. Will make again for sure. We talked about using a leaner hamburger because it was that juicy, but haven't decided. We prefer the 80/20 because of more flavor in meat. I couldn't really figure out why marinate the tomatoes for 2 hours as suggested but we did & worth it.

The neighbors were out with tongues wagging from the smell from the grill.  We prepared these exactly and did not add anything before eating.  Needless to say, they went so fast there was no time for a picture.  These are tasty, fresh, and perfectly delicious.  No more ratty, nasty, plain ones for us! Love this recipe!

The recipe says nothing about time to marinate the tomato slices, so I assumed it's just however long it takes to prep/cook the burgers -- wrong!  Fortunately, I checked other recipes online, and the consensus is to marinate tomatoes at least 2 hours at room temp.  With 90 minutes til dinner, I got right on it and the tomatoes turned out fine.  Phew!  (Spoiler alert: the tomatoes are a huge part of the awesome end product.)

Next, I scaled down ingredients for two 1/3lb burgers, mixed as directed, substituting the pesto sauce for basil, garlic and parm.  Following others' suggestions, I toasted some ciabatta rolls, and prepared a pesto-mayo (1/3c mayo + 2tsp pesto sauce) to spread on the buns.

Oh my!  This is going to be a regular on the grill this summer.  I will allow 2-3 hours for marinating tomatoes, and ciabatta rolls are a MUST, as regular burger rolls will not stand up to this wonderfully juicy creation.

Came out fantastic! I usually drizzle olive oil on my burger before putting it on the grill, but this time I used an olive oil and balsamic mixture. I also made a pesto mayo that I put on the ciabatta bun. Definitely making this one again.

The basil was a little overpowering so that the taste of the burger was flat.  Also I noticed a pesto on the burger, but it wasn't in the recipe.  This may have been a better alternative to putting the basil in the burger.

This is an awesome burger. I used the store bought pesto. 
I also rolled the beef mixture, after adding the pesto and tomato paste, into a "log, then wrapped it in foil and put it in the freezer till it hardened. Then you can slice the burgers into even patty sizes. This is a "gotta repeat" recepie.

The burger was moist and not dry at all.  The flavors really blended well.  We added a pesto sauce to the bun.  The only thing I changed in the recipe was swapping ketchup for the tomato paste.

You can't go wrong with this flavor combo! Caprese + charcoal-grilled beef = super delish! For a shortcut, I used some of my homemade pesto from the freezer, mixing it into the beef instead of the garlic-basil-tomato paste mixture. So good!

My family loved these burgers and they were easy to make.  I had not seen the post about the pesto, so made them the original way.  One addition I made was a drizzle of balsamic glaze on the burger, and I used ground chuck.  Delicious!!  We will make these again, and next time, I'll try the pesto, which we also love.

It was good, I think next time I'll use fresh basil leaves and a tiny bit more salt in the patties. It was VERY tomato-y, which I like but some may noy.

these were so yummy, I made them again the next night.  Even my picky eater loved them!  I did add some bread crumbs the second time becuase they are a little soft and need some help staying together.  I also used balsamic glaze to top the burgers rather than marinating the tomatoes, which is a great pantry staple to keep around.

I'm not sure why my reviews are being edited considering my opinions are always fair and non judgmental. Some recipes are hands down winners and some aren't. So, here's my second attempt at writing an honest review. Neither my hubs or I were all that impressed with these burgers. The concept is GREAT, but the end result is lacking. Our burgers shrunk to tiny little patties, but the real deal breaker was how overcooked these were. My hubby suggested that we use chuck or round next time (at minimum 80% lean beef), and I have to agree. All said and done, I absolutely am in love with your idea and think  this has real star potential, but I'll definitely make a few changes to ensure a better outcome next time. Thanks for sharing your unique recipe, Sarah!

oh my word!
these burgers were so easy to make and the taste was fantabulous!! i used the prepared pesto as suggested, but did add a few leaves of chopped fresh basil for that extra little something to the burger mix. i also added some of the fresh basil to the balsamic marinade. because i live in an apartment, i don't have a grill, so i cooked them in a pan and they came out perfect! i found the recipe for the "best burger sauce" that someone recommended and both my husband and i loved it! we even used it to dip our sweet potato fries that i made with the burgers. this is a keeper and will be made regularly.

So, so good!  The best burger I have ever made.  I lighted toasted ciabatta rolls, and I swear, my burgers looked so professional and tasted so great! I made sure to make the patties really large and used pesto I prepared in advance.  I sliced one enormous beefsteak tomato and made enough marinade to really cover the slices.  I put them in a ziplock bag and kept turning them to truly coat.  I had a couple tomatoes the next day, after living in that marinade, holy cow.  The best!

This burger is beyond good. Instead of tomato paste I used sun dried tomato paste and added fresh parsley with the basil.

This is our favorite burger!  I add two tablespoons of tomato paste, instead of one.  Everything else is perfect just the way it is.  I also use the best burger sauce found on this site as on topping.  Absolutely a perfect burger!

Great recipe, for the person that did'n want to open a can of tomato paste for 1 Tablespoon. I learned to open can ,  take what's needed then on waxed paper drop tablespoons and freeze either wrap searately. and put in freezer bags. Then use what's needed, for sauces, stews etc. NO waste.

I made this with no alterations or adjustments and it was delicious.  My husband, who is not a big burger eater, loved it and asked that I keep the recipe. Thanks for this!  Definitely in the recipe rotation.

Delicious! I followed the original recipe with no modifications & my family loved these burgers! Definitely use home-grown or farmer's market tomatoes and the best mozzarella available & you'll have a great gourmet burger.

I substituted ground turkey for the ground beef and grilled this for Memorial Day weekend and my family gave me rave reviews..I was quite impressed with myself..mainly because I am NO serious cook.

I really enjoyed this. I used the George Foreman grill, and burgers cooked up in about 5 minutes or so. My three year old wouldn't touch it, but my husband and I loved it. Served with homeade fries.

Ann said she liked this - especially the marinated tomatoes.
