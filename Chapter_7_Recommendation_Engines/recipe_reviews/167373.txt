The sauce is great.  I NEVER simmer ribs - I slow roast them in the oven for 90minutes uncovered on 325.  Baste them with sauce the last 45 mins and then under the broiler for a minute or so with more sauce.  Oh, yea.....

We loved the ribs!!  Yes,  made a few additions.  I thought the sauce was a little sour, so I added honey.  My boyfriend had me add rum to it. We also finished it off on the barbacue and not the oven.

the BBQ recipe is amazing! I really like this recipe all together, but I grill the ribs instead of broil.

Everyone loved these ribs.  Next time I will doubled the BBQ sauce amount b/c there was just enough to cover the ribs.  We like them dripping!

Delicious! This was the first time I ever made ribs at all and they were SO yummy. The only suggestion to newcomers that I have it to also brush the bottoms with the sauce...I am a newbie, so I followed the directions a bit too exact! :)

Awesome! I didn't have any liquid smoke so I used a couple tablespoons of bacon grease.  Perfect.

WOW! These were so delicious! I didn't have liquid smoke, and I'm pretty sure I didn't miss it! I can't imagine them being any better! (I baked my ribs in foil for 90 min instead of boiling)

Absolutely the best ribs I ever had.  The entire family loved them.      The only change I made was using Splenda brown sugar.  Definantly making it again soon.  Served it with baked potatoes and all the trimmings.

I figured I'd try a new recipe, so I made this for my husband last week. Not having made ribs before, I was a little hesitant. But he said they were the best ribs he'd ever had! And he LOVED the homemade sauce...I'll never buy barbeque sauce at the store again!

This was soooo easy! I had never used a broiler before. I boiled the ribs as instructed. I didn't have apple cider vinegar so I used KC Masterpiece Original BBQ sauce. I basted the ribs on one side and broiled them for 3 mins. I turned them and basted them again for another 3 mins. After I took them out of the oven I put a little more sauce on them. They came out really yummy. I was quite proud of myself. I wish I had two racks!

Just wanted to post my opnion. When you boil ribs it removes any flavor they started with.
I have been smoking ribs for 40 plus years.
I always wrap and seal ribs with the cheapest Italian dressing I find, in foil, bake or put in your outdoors smoker at around 225 to 250 degrees, for 60 to 120 miniutes, maybe longer depending how many you have.
Ribs should be hot steamy and cooked about 30 to 50 percent.
Then put them in the smoker or broiler which ever you have.
I hope my first post on Allrecipes is helpfull.

easy to put ingredients together. Also, made sure to take off the silver  (membrane) from back of bone. After combining and tasting the sauce mixture I decided to add a little honey, about 2T, eyeball it, to sweeten it a bit and take away that little bit of "zing". I then poured sauce all over the ribs, then I sealed them tightly in aluminum foil, popped them into the oven at 325 degrees for 2 1/2 to 3 hours (gas oven). The meat was so SOFT, it was falling off the bone while I was trying to pick it up. The bones were visible (sticking out from meat) to the eye and fell right off. Also, the sauce was just the right amount to cover the ribs. A sweet and slightly tangy flavor. I scooped up the sauce from the baking pan and drizzled it over my rice. I think next time I will have to make double the amount of sauce called for and use it to spoon over my ribs and rice. I also served this with corn and a side dish of potato salad. This recipe is a keeper!

I found these to be okay. Just okay. I much prefer the recipe 'Barbecue ribs' posted by SEEsign on this site. If you like these you will think SEEsign's ribs are restaurant quality! Once cooked the sauce is sooo good! I tried this for something different but am going back to the SEEsign's ribs now for good!

This is the only recipe I follow for ribs. The homemade sauce is EASY and fabulous!  I'm so glad I tried this, It's worthy of 5 stars!! I've used the sauce on many other meats, its that fantastic.

I never boil ribs, takes all the pork flavor out of them, 325 oven covered for 2 hours, add sauce and put on grill for a few minutes, the sauce was very tasty.

I was able to cut the cooking time with a pressure cooker, boiling it with some of the BBQ sauce. It just made the meat fall off the bone. Of course, finishing the cooking in the grill makes it all the more tastier, giving it that smoked charcoal flavor. I also included some A1 Steak Sauce to the mix to give an additional tart. :)

These are delicious!! Finger licking fantastic!! I didn't change a thing about this recipe. Just watch the timing on the broil setting, they can get black very quickly.  Wonderful!

I had never made homemade barbecue sauce before>  This recipe was a good starting point.  I added molasses, garlic, onion powder, black pepper, and a pinch of cayenne.  I was out of cider vinegar, so I used white vinegar.  I'll use cider vinegar next time around.  I'm reviewing the sauce only, since I braised my ribs in the oven and finished them on the grill.  Be sure to let the sauce simmer until it's nice and thick.

I followed the direction exactly except I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce instead of the sauce recipe here.  They turned out perfectly!!!  It was one of my first attempts making ribs and everyone was thrilled.

I have never cooked ribs before. I love ribs and will often buy them at restaurants. Finally I bought back-ribs at the grocery store and thought I  would give it a whirl. This recipe seemed easy for a non-cooker like myself to complete. The result was amazing!  Like some other reviewers I did not have apple cider vinegar so I  used white vinegar. Once I heated the BBQ sauce I  tasted and  added a little more brown sugar and ,like one reviewer suggested, a tablespoon of honey to lighten the  Zing. 
I am looking going to pick up some apple cider vinegar so I can see if there is a difference. 
If you have never prepared ribs you will love this easy to follow recipe. One thing I  would suggest is dont forget to remove the silver skin from the back of the ribs ( like I  did). After the ribs had simmered for 45 minutes  I  took them out and peeled off the silver skin easily. Luckily I  read about this step here on allrecipes.com!  If I  can make these delicious ribs  there is hope for anyone.

Sauce is amazing.  Easy recipe and worth 6 stars.  You must make these!  I did cook my ribs for 1 hr and 20 mins.  Make sure that yours are tender, but not falling apart.

These ribs were delicious. I agree that they would be better if they were slow cooked but boiled was a quicker way to get them on the table and I don't feel like the taste was sacrificed. I agree with adding the honey as well, it was just the right touch.

OH MY GOODNESS!!!! Wow, this is the first time I ever made ribs and it came out soooo good. It was so tasty I can't wait to make it again. The only thing I would recommend is to make a double portion of the sauce. It was tasty! Thanks a lot!

What a wonderful and easy recipe for my first time cooking ribs! The ribs were boiled first (too cold outside to cook) and then cooked in the oven.  The sauce was a bit vinagry so i just added more brown sugar and a lil honey and it was perfect.  I would make this again!

These were terrific!  Very tender, my husband who only loves to grill ribs loved these. Just keep the extra sauce for dipping :)

Delicious!  I was skeptical because its my 1st time making ribs but it was so tender & the sauce was delicious. The meat fell right off the bone.  My husband and daugther loved it.  It was even more tasty the next day for leftovers

This is a great recipe for ribs. The sauce is sooo good, and the cooked ribs fell off the bone. Boyfriend said they were "excellent"!

These ribs were delicious. I followed the recipe  but also took another reviewer's advice by adding a couple of bay leaves and a few peppercorsn to the water when boiling the ribs and I also added the suggested 2 T honey to the sauce. Wow, what flavour!

Fantastic sauce ~ sticky sweet & tangy. I made it as written and wouldn't change anything. I finished the ribs off on the bbq instead of broiling, though. Really, really good ribs!

Made these for Memorial Day Weekend last year and they were a complete hit.  The sauce was really good.  I'd never used liquid smoke before (found it at my local Giant but I had to ask b/c it was not in an obvious spot) but I'm definately going to use it from now on.  The relatives all begged for the recipe!

As my fiancee says, this recipe is full of win. Also, quite qptly, awesomesauce. I made this tonight after rummaging through the site for a good pork rib recipe, and this was absolutely wonderful I will say that i did not broil it. I love broiling, but we had been wanting to grill, so that's what i did. Put it thin side down first on medium heat on the grill. Brushed the sauce on top. 7 minutes, flipped and brushed the thin side. 5 minutes. flipped again, brushed the top, 3 minutes just to let the sauce set, then took them off. It was epic greatness. We will definatly be using this recipe in the future. Great work.

First off, DOUBLE the sauce. Second off...SO GOOD. The meat is tender and juicy from being boiled.  The sauce is like a sweet bbq sauce, it is not spicy, so if you are looking for that you will need to modify it.  My husband is a BIG rib guy (like most men) and he LOVED these.  Wanted to have them again the next night :)  Thank you for the recipe!

This cooking method is PERFECT!  I use a bottled sauce I really like and would never eat ribs before this, but the meat comes out with the perfect texture (just be careful if you do use bottled sauce that it's not too salty or anything because the sauce carmelizes under the broiler and imparts a strong taste).  Best rib recipe ever!

Very Excellant!!  An extra tasty option plus an extra tenderizer is to boil in a large tin of pineapple juice with water to cover the ribs.  My son commented that "these ribs are bad, they are falling off the bone!". Needless to say, he changed his mind in a hurry.  Great recipe!

I made these ribs for our Memorial Day dinner. These are by far the best ribs I have ever made. My thirteeen year rib coniseur gave them thumbs up and a A plus:). He told me keep this recipe in your folder, they are AWESOME!!!!! The only changes that I made was I omitted the liquid smoke flavoring, I am not a big fan of it, instead I added dark brown sugar intead of light brown sugar which gives a slightly molasses taste. I thought the change was a good one. And I also after boiling them I grilled them as another reveiwer did.  Our new grill that we got has a barbaque setting so that really did a nice job. Thanks for a great recipe my husband who isn't a big rib fan had a second helping and said "These are really good I don't mind if you make these again. I served my ribs w/ broccoli slaw and sweet potatoe fries YUMMY!!!!!!!!!!!:)

The meat was so tender.  What made them sooooo good tho, was the sauce.  This is now the ONLY sauce we use.  The last time I made it, I added a little honey.  YUM!

I really didn't care for this recipe all that much. I will not ever boil my ribs again. Pork needs to be cooked slow and low, I will continue to bake them in the oven. I also had to add a few ingredients to the sauce to make it taste good. I'm sorry we didn't really care to much for this recipe.

These were great!!  I did steam them in the oven (a little beer and water int he bottom of the pan - tightly covered with tinfoil) for about 2 hours.  They were a little too fall of the bone...but very tender!  The sauce is GREAT and broiling them to get that glaze was great.  Hubby did not want to BBQ - watching the game!!  It was an easy alternative.  The only thing I changed in the sauce was less vinegar and added some cayenne pepper and hot sauce.  Also - I doubled the sauce cuz we like them saucy!!  This is definately a keeper.

These were at least as good as the local restaurants. Even better because sometimes they don't use the freshest ribs. We used St. Louis style ribs and cooked them as full racks. We doubled the sauce as some said but then we were left with a lot of extra sauce - no problem because two days later it made great Sloppy Joes! (Just wet the browned chopmeat with the sauce and sautee a little more, doesn't need to swim in it). Instead of the extra honey some recommended, we just added a little extra brown sugar. I'm not sure that was necessary. I can understand how some might do it or find the vinegar too strong for their personal taste for dipping some as posted, but we prefer it as a coating cooked into the meat. That was flavor enough for us.

turned out perfectly!  it was my first time making ribs, and I was so proud.  I did add a little honey to the sauce to sweeten it up a bit.  I didn't have the liquid smoke flavoring, and I didn't miss it.  I wish I would've had another rack!

I cheated.  I did everything as posted, except I used a bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's sauce.  The whole process is easy and quick, and delicious.  It's the procedue that I always use, now.

The sauce is great. I NEVER simmer ribs - I slow roast them in the oven for 90minutes uncovered on 325. Baste them with sauce the last 45 mins and then under the broiler for a minute or so with more sauce. Oh, yea.....

I used the cooking method here while I did not use the sauce.  I liked the cooking method - it seemed work really well and eliminated a greasy mess.  I didn't bother with the sauce however I'm sure its good...I used Sweet Baby Ray's sauce.  I give this 4 stars just for the cooking method.

The sauce is good but take more time. Boiling baby backs?  Unless you're making pork soup... Cardinal sin! If you cook them low and slow they'll be tender and not lose flavor.

This was a fantastic recipe that will definitely be used again. The kids really liked them and my wife loved the sauce. I added cayean to the bbq sauce and put 3 bay leaves in the pot with the ribs. Next time I'll be adding honey to bbq sauce to slightly sweeten it up. This one is a keeper

Awesome ribs!  I took one reviewer's advice to roast them for 90 minutes, basting the last 45 minutes and then popping them under the broiler for about 2 minutes to finish them off.  I also doubled the sauce portion of the recipe. Served them with the Bodacious Broccoli Salad (from this site).  Terrific summertime meal!

I loved the simplicity of it! Prep time was a breeze! I was skeptical about boiling the ribs but really glad I did I followed the receipe to the T.  The sauce is finger lickin' delicious!  I had never used the broiler, the only thing I did wrong was have the ribs too close to the broiler and the burned a few ribs good thing i made a lot because after my first trial I leared my lesson and the following where sooooo gooooood! family loved them! This is a real find and a keeper! Thank you!

WOW - These were AWESOME! I've never made ribs before thinking they would be tough.  These were so tender and easy.  I used bottled sauce, however the homeade one sounds really good too.  No reason to wait for summer to grill ribs, when they can be made inside!

Very good. I used a bottle barbecue sauce and added a few of my own touches to it, but no matter how you do it, I think this is a winner. I don't think most people would be able to tell that these weren't cooked on a smoker or grill outdoors.

This recipe was easy and delicious! I was a little hesitant at the thought of boiling the ribs but tried it and it was a wonderful time saver! I made a few alterations; I didn't have apple cider vinegar so I used regular vinegar, I also didn't have liquid smoke and I thought the sauce was a little too tangy for my liking so I added about 1/8 tsp of cumin powder and it seemed to give it just that bit of woodiness that I felt it needed. I will get liquid smoke and the apple cider vinegar and try this as listed, it was very tasty as it was and I will now use this as my own main bbq sauce! Thank you for the great recipe! oh, also followed another persons suggestion and coated the bottom of the ribs before placing them on the baking sheet.. also added more sauce at the end as I like them dripping, delish!

Great recipe! I've never made ribs before and I was a little intimated but the recipe was easy and the ribs were good! My only suggestions would be to made extra sauce and cook it for less time.

I made this for my family.  Everyone loved the ribs and they were perfect.  I put less cider vinegar then suggested and I used A1 sauce instead of Worcestershire sauce...It turned out PERFECT.  I am making them again tonight.  I highly suggest this for a good dinner!

I loved this sauce. I didn't boil the ribs, I put them in the over as someone else mentioned - 325 for 90 minutes. I replaced the ketchup with chili sauce and eliminated the salt - before putting the ribs in the over I generously seasoned them with salt and pepper. BBQ sauce came out tangy.

Yumo! I browned to almost cooked the ribs in boiling water first. Then, I basted w/sauce of which I withheld probably a splash of cider vinegar for fear my kids would find it too tart. While the sauce smelled strong from the cider before cooking, it was not strong at all for my taste upon eating. I then put them on the broiler, turning several times about 6 min each side. My husband really liked these & thought they had an oriental flavor though I did not wrap them in foil or anything. I wanted them to be extra sticky so I basted every time I turned.

I added 1 tb honey, which made the sauce a bit sweeter for our taste. The sauce was wonderful. I baked the ribs for 10 minutes at 350 and then threw them in a crockpot on low for 5 hours. They were inhaled! Thanks for a great sauce.

This is a totally fail-proof recipe, my family loves it!  Pre-cooking the ribs is simple and they come out great - so tender and moist.  I had never even thought of making my own barbecue sauce but it was so easy and now I'll never buy bottled sauce again!  My only modifications are that I don't use the liquid smoke flavor as we don't really care for it, and instead of ketchup I'll use tomato paste or plain tomato sauce and then adjust the vinegar and Worcestershire sauce accordingly.  It is important to use the full amount of brown sugar called for in order to balance out the vinegar.   I like to double or triple the sauce and put the extra into a recycled ketchup bottle for easy storage.  Yum!

I was really grossed out when I took the ribs out of the water.  I had never boiled them before and was not prepared for the pale grey look.  As much as I thought against it I proceeded to brush the sauce on and cook them in the oven......WOW!   These were the best I have ever had.  The only change I made was I added about 1 tbsp of honey as I found for MY taste it was a little on the tart side, but that is my taste buds only and has no bearing on the original recipe.  TY spoiled for an awesome recipe.  I highly advise anybody to make it.  You won't regret it.

I put ribs in a 11x13 baking pan, coated ribs with a pork dry rub (you could use any type) & added 1/2 inch of water to pan, cover with aluminum foil. Bake at 300 for 2 1/2 hrs.  Make BBQ sauce while baking.  Remove ribs from pan & coat with BBQ if desired....ribs are delicious without also.  This satisfies my non BBQ sauce husband!

Top Notch,
I have tried many ways to cook ribs, different recipes and have stumbled upon some good ones. However, this one is amazing, I haven't changed anything about it, I've made it many times for lots of different guests and friends and always get great results and incredible reviews. 
I seriously recomend giving this one a try.

Just took them out of the oven and they are delicioius!  I roasted the ribs for 90 minutes at 325 in a roasting pan, then grilled on charcoal grill for flavor, then put back in the oven covered in sauce and roasted another 45 minutes at 325, then broiled about 5 minutes.  I know it's not quite according to the recipe.  The sauce is great and became milder after roasting.  I used honey instead of brown sugar.  I doubled the amount of ribs and tripled the sauce recipe.  I didn't leave the sauce cook down for 30 minutes, but it did cook down while roasting. This is the first time I've ever made ribs and I will use this recipe again. Thank you for sharing it.

These ribs turned out great. As a twist I broiled half in the oven and did half on the grill. I asked my family to pick which one they liked best. They all picked the grill, as did I. Coming from the south, it's hard to imagine ribs anywhere other than the grill.

AMAZING recipe!  Very simple to do, and my fiance and I both loved it!  We didn't have any apple cider vinegar, so I subbed in regular vinegar - still amazing!  I might cut down on the amt of brown sugar just a smidge next time as I found it a bit sweet.  Overall, the recipe as written was just fabulous!  Will definitely make this again.

The BBQ sauce was perfect after only cutting down a little on the apple cider vinegar as another review mentioned. The cooking was easy, but I had to cut down on the broiling time because my ribs almost burned. The only problem with the flavor is that most of it is on the outside; next time I will marinate the ribs so the meat itself can also have flavor.

these turned out wonderfully: very succulent and moist--the meat really came off the bone well.  i used stubbs bbq sauce rather than the recipe's.  the ribs burned a bit but were still really tasty.

Easy and delicious recipe. Only thing I did different is instead of boiling in water I put the ribs in a pan and used ginger ale ( seven up works as well ) and baked in oven at 350 covered for 1hr and half. The sugar from the pop helps sweetened the ribs a bit. Will try with cherry cola next time. Also grilled them instead of broiler for the bbq flavor. It's a keeper !!

This recipe is wonderful! My husband wanted ribs for dinner so he went to the butcher and asked which ribs were better (the pre-packaged, pre-sauced; just heat them up kind).
The friendly butcher said buy a slab of ribs, look up a recipe on the internet (he didn't know I have been on Allrecipes.com for years) find a sauce and make your own.  That is exactly what we did! We have made ribs with this recipe at least 9 times exactly to the recipe as it is written and we love it! The only thing we have done is double the sauce because we also like dunking' like the many others that have reviewed this recipe.  We tried it once on the BBQ, after we simmered them only because it was so hot outside that we did not want to turn on the broiler. Tonight we are doing the same thing because it is 94 degrees out at 7:00pm!  We put them on a disposable aluminum pan after simmering, drenched them in sauce on both sides on the BBQ on low with the lid down for 20-30 minutes.
This is our favorite recipe and we will not change it.  We have made it for family and friends and everyone loves it! Why change a good thing!  
"Spoiled" has also become one of my "favorite's"! Thank you for creating and posting this recipe! It has already been passed down to 2 of my children that are Chef's! It's a winner in our book!

My first time cooking baby back ribs and I used this recipe. I was very leary about boiling them because some of the comments were so negative but I took a chance and they were amazing! I believe the boiling is what tenderized them and melted off some of the fat which wasn't much. I added peppercorns, minced garlic and bay leaves into the boiling water for added flavor, I'm not sure if it helped but the house smelled wonderful and the ribs were delicious. I doubled the BBQ sauce per other review suggestions and also added a bit of honey as suggested, it was the best sauce ever!! I'll be making more sauce to jar and have on hand and I can't wait to make ribs again; I impressed my family members and they even complimented saying they were restaurant quality!! Thank you for always having the best recipes, this is my go-to site to cook anything and the reviews are always so helpful. :)

Ribs were amazing!!  I didn't boil them.  I baked them in a roaster in the oven around 2 hours, with a little water at the bottem of the pan. .  My family LOVED them!! Added some minced onion to the sauce and garlic.  Will make again.

Oh my goodness, these were the absolute best ribs!!  I boiled them and then put on a baking sheet (lined w/ Reynolds wrap), brushed on the BBQ sauce, and then cooked them on the grill.  I dipped mine in the left over sauce.  I did not even care about the rest of the meal, just wanted to eat the ribs!

These are excellent ribs for beginners!!! The barbecue sauce is great! I added Country Sweet Sauce, a product found here in upstate New York, it gave it that slight tang that it was missing. The ribs were melt in your mouth delicious!

A hit at our house.  First time I made ribs. Only reason I didn't do 5 stars is because I added to the sauce, garlic, onion powder, dash of hot sauce, and used Brown Sugar Twin since I'm diabetic, and increased the amount.  It is definitely a recipe I would use again.

I could not force myself to boil the ribs, but cooked them as I usually do in the oven on very low heat for a couple of hours and then pour away the fat.  I am afraid the sauce was very bland and ended up adding some garlic, pepper and chives.  I think I will just stick to my own receipe from now on, but this might be good for a beginner.

I used your recipe for the sauce and it's great, but I really don't know why so many people insist on boiling ribs first.

Easy and delicious. I used the grill with some wood chips to finish them off instead of the oven. Used a little cumin in the sauce as well. Excellent.

Just a comment that I always steam my ribs. Boiling seems to take too much flavor out. I put a  little water & salt in the bottom on a roast pan and set it on top the stove to steam for 1-2 hours. The curve of the ribs keeps them out of the water so they steam great. I fell in love with a store bought sauce called Bone Suckin' sauce!

This was my first time ever making ribs, and these were certainly easy. The meat just peels off the bones and the sauce was delicious. My only change I made was to add 2 tbs more of honey because I like my barbecue sweet. I saved just a little bit of sauce in the end so I could "wet" them once more before devouring. Thanks!

These ribs are just like my mom used to make when I was growing up.  They're the absolute best you'll ever eat, hands down.  Plus, they don't leave that ribby aftertaste like grilled ribs do.  You don't need to change a thing, but if you'd like to skip making your own sauce, find a really basic barbeque sauce, pour the bottle in a pot, add brown sugar, Worchestershire, and liquid smoke, and let it simmer... it's just as good.

Oh my gosh!  These ribs were so good, they were definitely the best ribs I have ever made!  My husband and I both loved them.  I boiled the ribs for 1 hour and then made the sauce exactly as shown in the recipe.  I spooned some of the sauce over the ribs and let them soak for a couple of hours in the fridge and then grilled them on the BBQ.  So good!  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I have used a lot of recipes here and this is the first that I have felt the need to do a review on.  This is AMAZING, honestly.  These beat my brother-in-law's and father-in-law's rib recipes (which they've "perfected over time") and are the favorite of both my wife and myself.  We won't do ribs any other way.  We don't make the sauce, we use a favorite sauce, but this cooking method is spectacular.

Would rate higher, but made a change or two. Did't have cider vinegar so subbed with half & half rice & Balsamic vinegars. Also found it to be a little salty, so toned it down a bit by adding some Tony Romas Carolina Honeys to it. Wife said it came out "Quite tasty". Translation "It's a KEEPER"

Very good recipe for fall off the bone rbs. I changed the recipe a little bit...while they were simmering I added some salt and onion powder to the water. The salted made it take a little bit longer to come to a boil. I let them simmer to the point of tenderness. Instead of broiling them I wrapped them in foil (leaving a little bit open) and let them cook in the oven for 25 min at 425. They turned out great very tender falling right off the bone. And for the people who don't like sauce the flavors added to water gave a nice flavor to the meat.

My grandmother's recipe for BBQ sauce is very similar, so I used hers.  The method promoted by this recipe is stellar... boiling then broiling ensures a very tender meat.  I used country ribs, rather than the bone-in baby backs, just cutting down on the initial boiling time a bit, and they came out delightful. :)  Will be making this one time and time again.

Great recipe! Didn't have all the ingredients for the sauce so I just boiled some ribs for one hour as the directions stated. I seasoned the ribs in a bowl after they boiled.  I then mixed bbq sauce, maple syrup and vinegar together to make a sauce of my own. Coated the ribs and cooked them on 450 for 15 minutes basting every few minutes. Really good! Husband loved it!

Ribs! Ribs! Ribs! How I love Ribs!  This recipe was a nice change to our usual rib dinner.  I love a little punch to my ribs so I added Big Rick's Chipotle Ketchup.  I also put it on the grill to give it a nice crunch. The family LOVED it.  Makes my mouth water now.

I made a few changes: I didn't have any ketchup so I used tomato sauce, only 2 tbsp. worchestershire sauce, only 1 tbls. brown sugar.  I used this with a rub for the ribs.  My daughter loved this recipe.  My son did not though.  But then again he has never really cared for BBQ ribs.  I'll keep this for my daughter and myself.  It's really good.

The sauce was delicious! The only thing I added was a few dashes of crushed red pepper to spice it up a bit and I slow cooked the ribs at 325 for 90 minutes (stopping at 45 minutes to add the sauce) and then put it under the broiler for a few minutes at the end. Will be making again, thanks for the recipe!

While the meat certainly did not fall off the bone, the flavour was amazing!! I didn't change the sauce much except for omitting the liquid smoke (didn't have any) and adding a few dashes of chili flakes for extra kick. I also added 3 dried chili peppers and a bayleaf to the water. Very good, but next time I would try slow roasting them instead.

Really terrific recipe! Ribs were tasty. I would offer the following suggestions: If you want a more "sweet" sauce, include a couple tablespoons of honey, otherwise sauce "as is" is very tangy (but still good). Remember to remove the membrane from the bottom of the ribs PRIOR to boiling. When broiling in the oven, broil the bottom first, not the meaty top. That's it. Really -- Recipe was fab!

What can I say?... WOW. Just made this for dinner, while we were watching the basketball game.  To make it easier (and not miss a second of the game) I used store-bought BBQ sauce, but mixed 3 different ones (regular, a mild one with a kick and hickory-honey) in even proportions. My fiancée is still raving about these amazing ribs. Ah! And used beef ribs, since I don't eat pork. Mega YUM!

These ribs were like candy on a stick!  I pressure cooked them in beer for half hour. Let them rest for awhile. Then slathered them with the sauce. I didn't think there was enough so I added some prepared BBq sauce. I think it would have been okay as is.  Baked for an hour at 300 degrees loosely tented with foil.
Beware if you have permanent bridges as I was pigging out on some crusties I felt my bridge slip. Off to the dentist tomorrow. Served with corn niblets and 
sliced tomatoes. Enjoy!

I have been making ribs like this for some time now. I first saute lots of onions & garlic and throw in a bunch of different spices and then add water to simmer the ribs. I do it to get rid of the fat. For those that love fat, get the grease can in the refrig. and stick a spoon in it and have at it. Bacon, chicken, beef fat all together. Who wants to bite into a bunch a fat, rather have flavor. Thanks to whoever submitted this recipe.

I absolutely enjoyed these ribs. I ended up adding a teaspoon of paprika and i also seasoned the ribs with salt pepper and a some seasonal salt . The only thing i would suggest is reducing the amount of  apple cider vinegar. But all i all it was great!

This was very good.  I had a huge rack of ribs and there were two recipes on here that I wanted to try, and this one was the winner.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, although perhaps the name of it could be tweaked to make it sound more appetizing!  ;-)  The "spoiled" part sort of makes one wonder.

This is the easiest way to make ribs and the result is amazing!  The method creates the tender rib you want, while your own favorite bbq sauce creates your preferred flavor.  Brilliant.

I made these ribs for a party of 80 people.  I baked the ribs before broiling instead of boiling them and I made more sauce for dipping, but the proportion of ingredients in the sauce was the same as listed in the recipe.  The ribs were a hit and very easy to do for a large group and now I make them in smaller quantities for my family.

Great stuff!  I followed recipe exactly, adding only about 2 tsps chili powder for the adults version of the sauce.  Even the kids loved it, and I didn't mind at all when I got sauce on my fingers while grilling.  There are a lot of pretty good bottled sauces out there, but I this one beats all commercial sauces that I have tried!

Good recipe.  I doubled the sauce and like others I reduced the vinegar a little but something was off... not sweet enough for my taste so I added a little honey and molasses to adjust.  I tried to stick to the recipe as much as possible.

My husband said these ribs were the best he's ever had.  The kids were licking their fingers.  We found that the ribs were less greasy after they were boiled.  The bbq sauce turned out delicious as well.

This sauce is AMAZING.  Easily some of the best stuff I've ever tasted.  I'd never boiled and broiled ribs before (I usually just take the easy way out and throw them in the crockpot with a bottle of sauce), so that was a new experience, but the meat turned out so flavorful I won't hesitate to do it again.  My only downfall was that the broiling time stated was a bit too long for my oven, so I had a touch of charring happening, but thankfully it didn't ruin the entire rack of ribs.  I won't take stars away for that because I really should have kept a better eye on it.  Next time I'll be sure to check on them at the 5 minute point.  The sauce I'll be making for other recipes for sure.  It is THAT good.

Great! made these for a party (double recipe) and got tons of compliments. My husband was skeptical about boiling them so long, but he changed his mind after tasting them. They were perfect and not too soft.

Absolutely fantastic! My husband said they were finger licking good! I did double the sauce. I was unsure about this method vs. on the grill, but glad i took the chance they were really moist and just fell off the bone! A definite keeper!

I have been using this recipe for years. The only things I change up is I add onion garlic and red pepper flakes to bbq sauce and I double it so I have some for other bbq meals (great on chicken) I also boil the ribs in beer,  we put the ribs on the grill.  Soooo good!

Great way to cook them. Very tender. Used baby back ribs. I boiled bone side down during the warming stage and for 20 min during the covered boiling stage then meat side down for the last 40 minutes. Very tender. Put on the grill to finish them off. The sauce was good but I didn't cook for 30 min probably would have been better if I did. Added about 1 tbs more of brown sugar to the sauce.  **edit: boiled the sauce and it was really good this time**

This sauce is absolutely amazing. I follow the recipe exactly. I do make sure that I take the membrane off the ribs after boiling them. I also brush all sides of the ribs. Thanks for an outstanding recipe. WE have made these many times in our house!

The sauce is so good! I didn't have any liquid smoke so substituted smoked paprika.
Like other reviewers said I didn't boil the ribs but instead slow roasted them covered @ 275 for 3-4 hours. I then will either bake them on a cookie sheet covered in the sauce @ 350 for 15 minutes or cook them on low on the bbq for the same amount of time basting with the sauce and turning every 5 minutes.

The only thing I changed was that after simmering them I coated them with the BBQ sauce in the recipe and wrapped them in foil, set them sideways in a foil pan and finished cooking them on a gas grill with the outside burners on med-high and the middle ones very low for one hour. Perfectly done and not falling off the bones but tender as could be. After cooking I coated them with BBQ sauce again, My husband said "the best ribs I have ever eaten!!"

I used spare ribs but the result was FANTASTIC!  Out of habit with boiling ribs I threw in some onion, celery, garlic cloves and peppercorns in the water for the boiling process.  I believe it adds some flavor to the meat.  The sauce however is so good, and sticky!  We very much enjoyed these :)

My parents were born/raised/educated in Ireland.  They cam to America before WWII.  They were raised on a farm and in America had their own farm.  Reason I share info with you...this recipe using boiling process as step 1 then coating with flavors...it's identical to my family's method.  In America...cooking ribs has various labels/locations/methods, etc.  To my taste buds...pork ribs are great no matter where the cook lives!  I enjoy this recipe for flavor as well as memory trigger.

Great!  I was a little leery of boiling the ribs (never having prepared them that way before) but since everyone had good things to say, I wanted to try it too.  They came out wonderful, nice and tender.  This sauce is really much better than I thought it would be based on how it smelled to me as I mixed it.  But it really is very good!  Thanks for sharing.

Out of a family of 5, at least one or two will complain about the dinner choice every day.  So yesterday, I decided to make ribs for dinner knowing it would be one of the few meals with NO complaints.  My 2 go-to cooks were not home so I came here for a recipe.  Wise choice.  I read all the reviews and decided to make the recipe as is.  However, I did end up sweetening the sauce with more brown sugar as I prefer a sweeter, less tangy sauce and I grilled them instead of using the broiler (less mess).  They were fantastic.  Not one complaint-just rave reviews!  They fell off the bone and the sauce was very tasty.  I will definitely be making these again...soon!

Quite tasty.  It's nice having a way to not heat up the house too much with ribs.  I always use "good" apple cider vinegar - you want something that doesn't look all distilled and I normally just substitute the dregs of the coffee pot for liquid smoke as I just really don't want to buy it :)

I used a store bought BBQ sauce, but loved this cooking method for the ribs.  They were fall-off-the-bone tender!

These were great! This was my first attempt at ribs and they came out perfect. The homemade BBQ sauce was incredible. Thanks

excellent easy recipe, especially for winter in cold country, since it can be cooked indoors.  i didn't need to change anything, but would suggest taking it a little easy on the apple cider vinegar.  delicious!

For a quick and easy rib recipe I highly recommend this.The sauce was a bit too sweet for our taste, so I added some cayenne and garlic powder to give it some kick. Overall, pretty darn good.

Delish, only I wouldn't cook the sauce on the stove as it spattered and made a mess and was thick enough to start with. Super tasty

This recipe was excellent!  They were very juicy and full of flavor.  I didn't have baby back ribs so I used pork spare ribs and increased the sauce slightly.  I served it with baked potatoes and green beans.  This recipe is a keeper!

It's the perfect no-nonsense BBQ sauce. I didn't have any liquid smoke, but I'm sure it would increase the flavor even more. I made two batches so people could drizzle more on if they wanted. I'll never buy BBQ sauce again.

Very easy to make and my husband liked them very well. My older daughter liked them, but not as well as some other rib recipes. Thanks!

Tender and tasty! I chose to add a little more brown sugar and a few tablespoons of honey bbq sauce,but I could have easily left the recipe as is. I will definitely make these ribs again.
