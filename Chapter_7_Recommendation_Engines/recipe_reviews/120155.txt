My whole family loved this recipe! The muffins are moist and flavorful.  BTW, it makes 12 servings. . .not 125 :)

Excellent recipe!  I got 12 medium/small muffins. I made this recipe twice: the first time I added butterscotch chips instead of raisins, and used apple juice instead of milk, and they turned out GREAT! The second time I substituted wheat flour for half of the flour. I also used two apples instead of one and shredded instead of chopped them - but I ended up not liking the result of this. The second time, I used apple juice again instead of the milk and doubled the cinnamon. Using wheat flour was okay, but I will probably stick to using all white flour unless I want the health benefits. But doubling the cinnamon is a must - it makes it much better! Thanks for this recipe!

I thought this was excellent!  Per other reviews, I put in double the cinnamon and about 1 1/2 cups apples.  It was quite good.  They're good cold and warm.  I also used about 1/8 cup applesauce and 1/8 cup oil to cut down on some more fat and calories.  Very good.  I would highly recommend trying this recipe!

These are really good - nice and moist but not greasy. I didn't bother with the topping and I still enjoyed them. Good and simple. 5 stars in my books.

this was great recipe. I was little leary because noone else had tried it.  My kids loved making it.  They are not to sweet and the crumb topping makes it wonderful.  Really chunky with fruit.  Try it.

Quick and easy. Very tasty too! I soaked the raisins and apples in the liquid mixture for about 10 minutes before stirring into the dry mixture. These were very moist and didn't even need the sugar topping. I baked another batch to freeze. NOTE: I don't know if you can tell or not, but those are Silicon muffin liners. That is ALL I use now for my cupcakes and muffins. A dream...  no more stuck cakes or muffins.

I didn't bother with the crumb topping, I just sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on top. I also covered the apple bits in cinnamon and sugar, as well as substituting half the milk for apple juice, and added a teaspoon of mixed spice. Overall, though, this recipe is ACE. The best muffins I've ever made.

great muffins, and low in fat, especially with the following changes: replace the oil with 1 serving of motts unsweetened apples sauce, and replace 1/2 cup sugar with 1/4 cup honey.... also doubled the cinnamon.  Great even without the topping!

These muffins are awesome! I made them as is, but substituted 1/3 whole wheat flour for the all purpose. Next time I will probably use 2/3rds whole wheat flour.

Awesome muffins!  I usually tweak muffin recipes to lower the calories or to add more flavor but I made these exactly as directed and they were delicious (and only 180 calories)!  I will be making these again soon.

I ate one just out of the oven and promptly had two more. Fabulous. 
I doubled the cinnamon as per others' reviews and it's perfect. 
I also left off the topping due to a lack of oatmeal in my cupboard, and yeah, it's still 5 stars! Can't wait to make them again.

Looking for something to have with our coffee one weekend morning, and I had everything on hand for these.  I followed other's suggestion and doubled the cinnamon in the batter, which I'm glad I did. I think next time I'll try adding a little sour cream to the batter to increase the moistness and density, like my favorite banana bread recipe. I made 24 mini muffins - baked about 12 min. I would call these apple raisin muffins, because the apples are definitely the star, and I didn't really notice the raisins. Maybe increasing the amount of raisins would add a little chewiness. All in all, a tasty quick recipe.

Excellent muffins! *munch, munch* /dropping crumbs on keyboard. I took some other reviewers' suggestions and did part WW flour to reg., as well as halving milk to applejuice, and oil to applesauce, and up'ing the cinnamon. Next time around, I'll either add chopped walnuts to the crumb topping, or not do the crumbs at all. (I wasn't too impressed w/ the topping.) I always grate my apples into muffins, but I really liked the chopped chunks of apples in this! What a scrumptiously-moist, tasty muffin!

I made a few adjustments, I wanted craisins instead of raisins, so I put 2 handfuls in (no measuring oops!) and used my apple peeler/corer/slicer thing and cut the apples into 6 pieces from the spirals, used 2 medium sized apples, so it was more then the 1 cup. Lumpy with so many apples and craisins, but GOOD that way! The kids LOVED them. Once I make apple sauce I will sub that for the oil. I might make this into a bread this afternoon. Thank you!! (Oh! I added a bit of vanilla to the wet ingredients too)

These were okay, not great. I think if I wanted apple raisin muffins again, I would add raisins to a different apple muffin recipe.  This one came together fine, but the topping is not great and pretty much fell off when eating the muffins.  They were a little on the dense, dry side.  I do like the raisins with the apples, so the idea is great!

Delicious, and very easy to modify into a gluten-free recipe as I have a wheat allergy.  I used rice flour instead of all-purpose or wheat flour; the only thing when you bake with rice flour is you always have to add more liquid. In this case I added close to a half cup (maybe it was a third of a cup - I went more by the batter's texture and wasn't precise). Still came out looking and tasting great!

I modified it- 1 cup white flour, 1/2 cup wheat flour; doubled the cinnamon (as recommended by reviewers), used 1/4 cup applesauce instead of 1/4 cup of oil, and decreased sugar to 1/4 cup instead of 1/2 cup.  My comments on the product with my modifications: Way to much cinnamon, the muffins stuck to the paper (I think that was because of the lack of oil), way to sweet (I would either decrease the sugar further on not do the crumb topping).

Instead of the oil, I used 1/4 c. of leftover whole berry cranberry sauce. I also used homemade apple pie spice in place of the cinnamon. Smells wonderful. This will be nice to have with crisp bacon and scrambled eggs before we go get our Christmas tree in the morning!

The kids and I made these muffins this morning for breakfast.  We made them in mini muffin cups.  I substituted soy milk for the skim milk to make them dairy free.  They were fantastic!  The only problem was that the recipie didn't seem to make very many - or maybe it's just that they were so delicious that there weren't many LEFT.  Definatly a "keeper" recipie!

I thought these were delicious, only I would have liked 12 big muffins instead of small ones.  Don't yet know how well this doubles, but i will try next time.  The only changes I made were that I used 1 cup all purpose flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, 1.5 tsp of cinn, 1/2 cup of Apple juice in place of the milk, 2 Tbs melted butter in place of the canola oil, and a little more than a cup of diced (red delicious) apples      The crumb topping is also very tasty!  My hubby and 18 month old son loved them!

These were excellent!!  I so enjoyed them and my family did also.  We had them with some chicken noodle soup on a very cold, dreary day and they were perfect.  The only changes I made were to double the cinnamon and I used 1/8 cup oil and 1/8 cup applesauce.  The rest I kept the same.  Will make often!

I really like these, could use more raisins though. The flavor was good, only thing I changed was the topping. I ended up with left over apple which I just coated with Splenda and cinnamon, I used this instead of the crumb topping. I also made these into 2 muffin loaves. Baked at 350 for 27 minuets.

Didn't do 5 stars because it needs some minor tweaks. I did 1 cup white flour and 1/2 cup wheat, in addition to everyone's 1 extra teaspoon of cinnamon. Everyone in the office liked them. Good hot or cold, quick and easy - will make again!

These were so good!  I didn't even make the topping, but they were great right out of the oven.  The only changes I made to the recipe were that I added a little more than 1 1/2 cups of apple and doubled the cinnamon.  Will definitely make again.  Great way to use up apples.

AWESOME muffins. My changes: replaced raisins with craisins, oil with applesauce.  I made 40 mini-muffins and baked them at 355 for 11 minutes. YUMMY!

My family still prefers my banana-bread muffins or zuchinni-bread muffins.  These didn't taste bad, but texture was crumbly.  I'll try again when I have apples to use up, and maybe put more apples or bake less time.

I've made the muffins (the recipe yielded 12 medium sized muffins) exactly as described, and they turned out great, they were gone in two days! I got nothing but compliments.  The muffins were moist, tender and fluffy. I'm going to make these again today!

I did make a few modifications. Replaced 50g of the white flour with whole wheat flour, grated the apple with the peel on, used brown sugar, 1/2 tsp of mixed spice in addition to the cinnamon and added a handful of chopped nuts to the batter. Substituted golden raisins (sultanas) for regular. Didn't bother with the topping. A heady aroma of spices filled the kitchen. Great recipe!

That was a delicious muffin.  I think I didn't put in quite enough baking powder, but they were quite tasty and didn't last long!    In lieu of raisins I added flax seed and a tiny bit of vanilla and almond flavouring.

These muffins are scrumptious and they are very pretty as well!  I used whole milk instead of skim; they turned out great.

I didn't have raisins so I used the apples only. 
A nice moist muffin. I gave my son one after his lunch and he gobbled it up.
I used a little more flour in the topping so I will stick with 2 TBSP next time. I melted the butter to make it easier to mix.
Will keep these in my recipe box.

YUM!!!! When I first tried the muffins yesterday I thought they were to bland, but when I tasted one this morning the flavor of the cinnamon had really come out. These are awesome muffins! I will add about half cup more apple next time.
Thanks for the recipe.

I just made these muffins and they are delicious. Instead of the topping above, i used apple flavored granola. They turned out great! They are not the "prettiest" muffins but they are tasty.

Fantastic recipe! I made these muffins with some sketicism but they turned out perfect! Very moist and it was lovely with the crunchy topping!
