I added more mayonnaise, and used a combination of Dijon and English mustards. Omitted the wax beans as I couldn't find fresh, and I didn't think canned would be good. Also cut back on the dill as I'm not a huge fan. I served this at room temperature. Not bad at all. Thanks!

This turned out alright once I added more mayo, and used dijon mustard.(tried a little of two other mustards, but not good)
Also, think this needs to be "cool" not cold when you eat it.

I doubled up on green beans due to my store not carrying fresh wax beans but other than that I made as written.  This was okay but I think the mayo overpowers and it could have used more Dijon. You need to let your potatoes and beans drain really well or you will end up with a watery dressing. This was pretty good but it  needs some tweaking in my opinion.
