Chocolate chip & pumpkin, what a combination! After making this recipe I thought the pumpkin taste was too bitter and I found I wanted to taste the spices more, so next time I used 1 & 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg...also, 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar, and 1/2 unsalted butter and 1/2 shortening. I also made them with and without the walnuts, and they're much better with them. They're a great, unusual addition to my Christmas cookie baking and were a hit with everyone who's tried them.

I got rave reviews from adults and kids with a modified version of the recipe.  I used butter instead of shortening.  28 OZ of Pumpkin Puree.  I doubled the cinnamon and added two teaspoons of Pumkin Pie Spice.

This recipe makes a lot! I halved it and still came out with 66 cookies/cakes. I wouldn't call these cookies--much more like little cakes--very moist--they were sticky the next day. I used sliced almonds instead of walnuts and they tasted really good. The texture was odd, unlike anything I've ever eaten. When I placed them on the cookie sheet, they were in little mounds and I expected them to melt down and flatten as cookies do but they didn't. Whatever shape you place them in on the rack is the shape they will have when baked. The batter would work well in molds or rings to create an autumn treat. Good flavor but I added more cinnamon and nutmeg because I like these flavors. My husband's golf buddies ate them up!

I really love these cookies!  They are very different from regular cookies . . . a bit like cake, but very good.  I used only 1/2 tsp. of salt and put in an entire bag of chocolate chips.  I also left out the walnuts, which were optional anyway.  My husband requested that I use raisins next time.  One thing I would say is that to me pumpkin cookies never taste as good the first day.  The second day the flavors just seem to come together and the taste is much better!

Oh my goodness....these are SO good!  Very easy to make.  The leftover batter I first refrigerated then formed into logs and then placed in the freezer for easy baking later.

These are so yummy, but I made a few adjustments. As others before me have said, I doubled the pumpkin (and the chocolate chips), used pumpkin pie spice along with the cinammon, baking Splenda instead of sugar, and unsweetened applesauce instead of the fat. The result is something no one can stay away from. I am making these again ASAP! DELICIOUS!

Great cookies!  Husband ate them quickly!  They could use slightly less flour though.  I used a bit more cinnamon and nutmeg and also added ground cloves and ginger.  Excellent recipe!

My hubby and kids thought that they were okay, however I didn't.  They were flavorless.  I was looking for a recipe that tasted like the pumpkin cookies they have at Ralph's grocery store, and this wasn't it.  I'll keep looking.

These cookies, or should I say little cakes, were very good.  I left out the salt, and added 2 tsp. gd. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg.  Very good!

YUM!  These cookies are great!  I love cookies and these are a little more cakey, but still so good.  The only thing I did different is use butter.  I would use more spice next time, but these are great as is. Even my kids like them! *Update* The second time I made these I used all shortening and they were much better! Crispy on the outside, light and fluffy on the inside.  I also used 2 tea pumpkin pie spice and think I could've used a little more.  One last thing, last time I used mini choc chips, this time regular.  I'd stick with the mini.  Better chocolate distribution.

Simply delicious. I changed a few things, though. I used 1 c. regular sugar and 1 c. brown sugar. Increase cinnamon to 1 1/2 tsp. and nutmeg to 1 tsp. I only used butter, no shortening.I also added 1/2 cup of oats. What a hit with my family, and in my kids classroom.

I've been making these cookies for many years after finding the recipe.  They consistently are my friends' favorite cookies.  So soft and not too sweet.

These cookies have become legendary, my friends don't fail to ask me about them at least once a month.  I highly recommend mixing butterscotch and chocolate chips!  Thanks a bunch :)

These are more like little cakes than cookies - I've kept them in the fridge and am having
one or two at breakfast time - like a personal pumpkin bread.  Taste great, but not really
much of a cookie.

I've done 2 batches of this recipe. One as written and another with 2 15oz cans of pumpkin. The double pumpkin amazing. Had perfect balance of pumpkin and chocolate. The recipe as written is good, but its missing the strong pumpkin taste that the modified version has, its just a cinnamon chocolate cookie.

Cakey little poufs of deliciousness!!! Recipe states it only makes 7 dozen but I got just 1 short of 11 dozen. I did add more than 2 teaspoons of ground cinnamon and more than 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice, after adding respective teaspoons of spices I decided it needed more and just shook a good amount from the bottles. I also added some fresh grated nutmeg. Used mini chips and toasted pecans instead of the regular size chips. (I always toast nuts before using.)These will be making repeat appearances throughout the year!!!!

Very good and easy! The cookies are like little cakes and they're delicious, and it's true, they're even better the next day.

Although my kids like these, I personally thought they were very bland.  I added an extra 1/2 spoon of cinnamon, instead of a pinch I used 1/2 tsp freshly ground nutmeg, but the end result was still not what I'd like.  I didn't have walnuts so I didn't use any.  They more cake like, as some have mentioned.

These cookies are sooooo soft and delicious!  I've baked a batch every week since I first made them two months ago.  I've been giving them to friends, coworkers, relatives--everyone loves them!  I added 1 tsp. pumpkin spice and extra chocolate chips.  They were delicious with a combination of milk chocolate and white chocolate chips!  Thank you for a great recipe (and for making me gain 10 pounds!?!)

I've been making pumpkin chocolate chip cookies for years and my kids beg for them.  But I lost my recipe, so I tried this one.  It was really very good.  I used butter because I didn't have shortening, and I used pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon and nutmeg.  I still think it needs more spice flavor, so next time I'll use a tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice.  Otherwise, excellent!

I used 1 stick margarine and 1 stick of butter instead of shortening, and 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar instead of 2 cups of white one (as someone from reviewers recommended) and 2 cups of chocolate chips (omit the nuts). It turned out absolutely perfect! My kids LOVED it! Thank you very much for sharing the recipe! Great addition to my recipe box!!!

Great recipe. My boys absolutely love this one. I make a couple changes. I use white chocolate chips, which I think improves the overall flavor of the pumpkin, and substitute 1.5 t of pumpkin pie spice for the spices. Makes a ton of cookies. They taste the best the day you make them, so I just keep the rest in the frige and make as needed. I make this one all the time in the cold winter months.

These cookies are too cakey and have little flavor.  Too much baking soda, not enough pumpkin.  I'm not sure I'll be able to give them away!

My grandson and I made these cookies,  He frosted his, I do not like all the sweet so did not do the rest, but I did find that the seasoning is lacking.  I believe as others after that more spice is needed. reading their reviews, after I baked the cookies,  that they definitly need more spice.  I believe I would try pumpkin pie spice, for a much better flavor.  I love the cake consistency.

We love these cookies.  My 8 year and her friend had a blast making them - and eating them!  The only change we make is to add about 25% more chocolate chips and we do a mixture of mini chips and chunks.  These cookies threw me off a little the first time we made them - because when they are done baking, they look just like they did raw.  They do not spread or change shape at all. It is kind of hard to tell when they're done, so we underbaked them a little last night and they were even more delicious - just a little gooey in the middle.

I made this before my kids got home from school with their friends.  By 4:00, ALL the cookies were gone.  I made another batch for our family later that evening, and when I woke up the next morning, those were all gone as well!  My family LOVED them!  :)

i did not like this recipe.  won't be making it again.  they are not buttery and not sweet.  more of a tea biscuit.   also, most cookies spread out when you bake them. these do not. so they are both unatrractive and non delicious.  even my toddler doesn't want them.

A really good starting point, but I think this recipe needs more spices to be outstanding (maybe double or triple what is called for). I thought the cookies were a little bland so added a lot more cinnamon and nutmeg and even a little more salt. 
But these cookies do have an interesting texture and delicious taste. I've gotten pretty good reviews. Thank you for the recipe.

This recipe is great. Though I changed a bit. I put in 1 pkg of instant vanilla pudding, 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice and didn't add walnuts. It comes close to the store bought and my family loves it :)

A delicious cookie!  I used unsalted butter for the shortening.  Next time, I will use more spices, 2 tsp cinnamon and 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice.  Also, I used the whole bag of chocolate chips, 12 ounces.

I followed the advice of others and doubled the pumpkin and cinnamon and added pumpkin pie spice. I also substituted Splenda for sugar and unsweetened applesauce for shortening. It was a bit "spongy" and not crunchy like expected for a cookie. However, my four year old said they are his new favorite cookie.

The best pumpkin cookie I have tried so far, though I am still looking for a recipe that makes "cookies" and not "cookie shaped cakes".  I used butter instead of shortening and tripled (yes, tripled) all spices, keeping the ratio the same.  After dropping on the cookie sheet, used my finger to really spread the batter down thin--a very important step for me to decrease the cake-quality a bit.  Pending a miracle (i.e, cookie-cookie pumpkin cookies!) this will be my recipe for next year.

My daughter loves these cookies!!  I have modified this recipe a few ways but the best way I found was to use 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar.  In addition to that I used 1/2 cup of shortening and a 1/2 cup of butter, 1/2 cup of "better than eggs" and I also doubled the cinnamon and added a pinch of cloves.  I tried using Butter Crisco but I thought it made the cookies a little too rich.

I really don't like cakey cookies so I tried to modify these and make them more "cookie-like".  The best I can say is I got them to flatten out, but really, the texture still reminds me of pumpkin bread in little cookie shapes.  I cut out a cup of the flour, reduced baking soda and powder each to 1 tsp, used half white and half brown sugar, and used butter (very soft, almost melted) instead of shortening (I HATE shortening).  I should have cut the 2 eggs down to 1 but didn't, though that might have helped.  I also dropped the cookie sheets down on the counter when I took them out of the oven to deflate them.  So like I said, flatter, but still cakey.  Bummer.  They have a nice taste (I upped the cinnamon and nutmeg and added pumpkin pie space per reviews), but I doubt I will make them again.

I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I'm a chocolate gal so I added an entire 2 cup bag of chocolate chips.   Also, I read where the cookies keep their shape when baked, so I flattened them like a peanut butter cookie using a fork dipped in water and then criss-crossed the cookies.  I really like these cookies!!  Makes a lot!!!

I halved this recipe and the only change I made was to up the spices and choc chips a tad. I didn't use nuts. They are very airy and moist inside but with a slightly harder exterior. Maybe they will be better cold the next day, but they just don't taste like much! No spice, not very sweet -I thought these were going to be like the cake-like pumpkin cookies I've had in the past, but guess I got the wrong recipe...

Awesome recipe!  I make these cookies every October but I started early this year.  My family will go through a batch in two days!  This is the 1st time I've made them with an egg though and it really did make a positive difference.  The only changes I made to this recipe were to use 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar; use a tbsp of Pumpkin Pie Spice in lieu of the cinnamon and nutmeg and add a tsp of ground cloves.  I also bake them at 350 degrees for a little bit longer and frost them when they've cooled with a homemade cream cheese frosting by beating (1) 8 oz. container of whipped cream cheese, 1 cup confectioners' sugar, a tsp of vanilla extract and a splash of milk until smooth and creamy.  DELICIOUS!!!

This recipe is amazing!!  I did make a few changes after reading some of the prior reviews.  I use butter instead of shortening, 2 cans of 15oz pumpkin puree, 2 tsp of cinnamon and 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice.  This is a hit everywhere it goes.  I have the recipe printed and on hand whenever giving these away.  This recipe has become a family tradition.

My oldest has been begging for something pumpkin for days, so my husband graciously decided to make these cookies for the family tonight.  He followed the recipe exactly and the end result was not exactly what we're used to.  So I compared the two recipes and this is what I discovered.  My recipe appears the same from a glance, but the minor differences are what made the differences.  First, I use butter, not shortening.  Second, for the amount of flour this recipes calls for, it only requires 1 can of pumpkin.  My recipe calls for half the flour (plus 1/2 c.), with 1 can of pumpkin.  To me, this is a HUGE difference in the end result.  My recipe calls for about 1/2 c. more sugar. Mine also uses more pumpkin pie traditional spices than this one calls for.  Meaning, this recipe lacks in spices.  In the end, we felt we were only eating flour with chocolate chips to soothe over the flour taste when you bit into one.  We couldn't taste the pumpkin at all.  :(

I made these over the weekend and they were very good! I took the advice of many reviewers and doubled the chips, pumpkin and cinnamon. I did add 1/2 tsp. ground cloves and that made it for me!! I absolutely loved the combination of chocolate and cloves YUM! Next time I may try some frostings. Thanks Diane!

Great cookies!  I substituted one cup of buckwheat flour (forgot to go grocery shopping) and it didn't hurt a bit.  I also used fresh pumkin from Halloween.  Before carving, I hollowed the pale stuff (not the orange slimy part) out of the pumkin until I had a bowl full.  Then, I stewed it in a pot until soft, drained it, and pureed it.  The cookies were light, soft, and delicious!

These cookies are great! I lost my old recipe and was so happy to find this one. It's just as good. My family doesn't like nuts, unfortunately, so I omitted the nuts and added a 1/2 cup extra chocolate chips. If you're a real chocolate lover like me you can add a whole cup extra. The chocolate and pumpkin make a great combination.

These cookies weren't really cookies at all.  I will bake the rest of the dough into little loaves of bread.  Also, the flavor was a little bland.  Use more spice and maybe less flour.  I won't make them again.

This is a wonderful recipe. I added a bit more vanilla and nutmeg since my family loves those flavors and the cookies turned out great. They were eaten faster than I could take them out of the oven!

Delish! The only thing that is needed is more chocolate chips. But even if you get one without a chip, it is the best!!!!!!

This is a delicious cakey cookie!  For you coconut oil users, I substituted 3/4 cup coconut oil for the shortening.  They turned out perfect!

I actually swapped out 1 cup of white sugar for brown sugar and 2 cups of white flour for whole wheat flour.  I accidentally ended up adding 1.5 tsp each of nutmeg and cinnamon, and then also added 1.5 tsp each of ground cloves and ground ginger, and ALL of my family and friends raved about them.  These extra spices make it kind of a spice pumpkin chocolate chip cookie. Yum!!  Just made the 2nd batch in one week, for charity function tonight.  They make TONS of cookies, but they'll be devoured quickly.

Thisis an amazing recipe. I pureed my own pumpkin and have some left over in the freezer for future batches. The only change I made was I used about 1 1/4C of chocolate chunks instead of 1C chocolate chips. It's what I had on hand and I felt it needed a bit more. These are AMAZING!!! So moist, they are almost a bread consistancy. Everyone that eats them tell me that they are like biting into heaven. Thanks for the great recipe Diane, this one is going in my recipe book.

Followed Bonnie Q's minor changes (1 & 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg...also, 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar, and 1/2 unsalted butter and 1/2 shortening) plus cooked the pumpkin with the spices to remove any 'canned' taste.  Turned out *delicious.*  Plus I made them much larger (about a quarter cup each) but they still held their shape very well in the oven and didn't really spread.  Very light and cakey but a nice change to heavy holiday desserts:)

I loved these cookies, as did my husband, co-workers and friends! They make a ton and so there are plenty to share. I also tried using bananas (3-4) instead of pumpkin and it turned out well. I will definitly make these again.

Warning!  This recipe makes A LOT of cookies!  These were very good and easy to make, but I may try them with double the amount of pumpkin next time because the pumpkin taste is extremely subtle.  The nice thing is that they do not spread, so the cookies stay pretty true to the size they are when you put them on the cookie sheet.

Very good...The texture was cake-like as others have said, but that's the same as any other pumpkin cookie I've eaten so I really liked the texture. It could have tasted more pumpkin-y, but again, probably similar to other pumpkin cookies. I guess that's why in stores they usually are frosted. They did not spread at all so feel free to put them close together on the cookie sheet

This is a new Fall Family Favorite!   I did make one addition as I thought it needed something!  So...I use an ice cream scoop to get the right size...BIG!  Then cool cookies on racks and when cool...slice them in half and add a layer of cream cheese frosting (I just use canned).  They look so pretty when finished and great for gift giving!  Have fun with this one!  YUM!

I'm eating these as I type and they're so good!  The only changes I made were to use fresh pumpkin instead of canned (whipped it well with the butter/sugar mixture to get out lumps), and  cardomom instead of nutmeg.  I LOVE the interesting depth it added to the pumpkin.  I'll "test" one more before putting them away...

I don't rate anything less than 5 stars unless I follow the recipe exactly -- not really fair if I change it and then rate less.  Anyway, this one I give 5 because it was what I was looking for in a cake-like cookie.  Yum :).  As suggested by previous reviewers, I added the whole bag of chocolate chips, added the pumpkin seasoning, used butter instead of shortening and mixed brown & white sugar.  I left out the nuts.  I also had a large can of pumpkin (29 oz), so I threw the whole thing in and it worked great.  They are yummy.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I should have known from other reviews that I wouldn't like these... they are VERY cakey (I prefer flatter, chewier, crispier cookies), but I thought I could "fix" them by slightly altering the recipe.  I used half butter half shortening, and half white half brown sugar, but I don't think that made a difference.  They are very puffy and kept whatever shape they were put on the pan--they don't spread at all (my first batch came out in little balls because I used a cookie scoop, after that I tried flattening them a bit before putting them in the oven).  I added extra cinnamon and nutmeg as previous reviewers suggested, but they still tasted bland to me.  The only good thing about them was the chocolate chips!  If you like cake-like cookies you'll probably like these, but they just weren't for me.

I have been making these cookies for years.  They are my holiday standard for cookie exchanges, office parties, etc.  My father requests 10 dozen to take to his office the week before Christmas.  I've been told that they freeze well, but have never tried it.  I recommend using chopped pecans and mini chocolate chips.

I just made these and I really liked them.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars rather than 5 is for the few changes I made and will make next time.  I cut back on the flour by 1/2 cup, added some ginger and cloves (will add even more next time) and I will definitely add even more chocolate chips next time.  I found them very light, tasty and a definite keeper for my cookie collection.

Excellent cookies!  Easy to make, taste great.  I brought these cookies along with two-bite brownies to a ladies get-together, and they were devoured... and the brownies left lonely on the dish.  THAT is the sign of a GOOD cookie!  ;oD

These are not terribly pumpkin-y, btw, for those who are not pumpkin fans.  They are akin to a spice cookie, with chocolate added for good measure.  Very substantial.

very yum - however like all things I modified it to my tastes, added a little extra margarine, an extra egg (I like my cookies fluffy), cinnamon, nutmeg, and put in 1 cup of milk choco and 1/2 cup of dark choco chunks.

These cookies are great!  My boys begged me to make another double batch (huge batch) of cookies so they could have them for their school lunches.  My picky eater liked them the best.  The second time I made them I used the pre-season pumpkin and left out the spices on the recipe.  They came out a little spicier and seemed a little more moist.  We freeze this huge batch of cookies and pull out a few at a time and heat in the microwave.  Yum!!

I INADVERTENTLY used rye flour instead (OOPS!) and these came out fantastic anyway!  I was going to make whoopie pies out of them by connecting two cookies with cream cheese frosting but I opted for just frosting one at a time.  Great recipe!

I LOVE this recipe! However, I like to use a lot more cinnamon (about 1.5 TBS total) and I add another 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. These cookies are simple to make and it's impossible to mess them up. Just don't over bake them! :)

I made these today but used better and 16 oz home frozen pumpkin puree and instead of a cup of nuts I used a cup of M&M's, they were the ugliest and best tasting cookies ever made from pumpkin!!!!! I called them," ZOMBIE M&M Pumpkin cookies" !!!!! They go to my grandsons classroom Halloween party . He loved the ugly cookies!!!

looked like a cookie, but the pumpkin bit was a bizarre, moist consistency that refused to dry out and take normal cookie form. they tasted alright, but were certainly nothing to write home about.

Great recipe! It's very adaptable and absolutely delicious. I made a few modifications, as recommended; I used butter instead of shortening, doubled the pumpkin, and use 3 tsp of pumpkin pie spice in lieu of the other spices.

I make each cookie 1 tbsp instead of one tsp, which yields about 6 dozen slightly larger cookies.

I've also successfully made this more than once with dried cranberries that I rehydrate in the microwave-- it's a little healthier, but it tastes just as good! Just nuke the cranberries with 2 c water for 2-3 minutes, then dry them and add to the batter.

You can half this recipe beautifully-- for me it comes out to be 35 1 tbsp cookies.

These were good cookies however I felt that they needed a stronger pumpkin/spice taste to them.  I might try using homemade pumpkin puree and playing around with the spices next time.  It's a good base recipe though.

I found this recipe after searching for a way to use leftover pumpkin from making pumpkin bread. I was very happy with these, even though I hate changing the servings because sometimes the result doesn't taste right. They were very soft and delicious and I will definitely be making them again.

I made these cookies with butter instead of shortening. Although I don't think that they tasted particularly of pumpkin, they were slightly orange, cakey, and tasty. The spices combined with the chocolate chips make these a little different from traditional chocolate chip cookies.

I confess, I changed this one a bit. I did butter in lieu of shortening. Doing a half batch, I doubled the cinnamon (1 tsp in 1/2 batch, 2 in whole), and substituted nutmeg with 1/2 tsp cloves, and added 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice. I omitted the chocolate chips--I think raisins would work better. They came out beautifully cakey and delicious. Loved it!

Even better if you sub raisins for the chocolate.  Great consistency and flavor and the recipe makes a ton so you can share!

I personally found the pumpkin flavor to be lacking.  The chocolate chips completely overwhelmed what little pumpkin flavor there was, but even the cookies without chocolate chips in them were kind of lacking in flavor.  They baked up nicely though, and my husband, who doesn't care for pumpkin thought these were great.  So, they get three stars.

OH MY GOODNESS these are fantastic!! I have tried other pumpking choc chip cookies and  they are so moist they dont taste cooked! These are cake-like - our favorite cookie style - and I make them year round. I like to freeze cookie dough - but beware, these take FOREVER to freeze. Probably bake them and then freeze the cookies instead.

We did NOT like these... they looked great, but the chocolate and the pumpkin didn't go well together! The cakey texture was nice, though.

They aren't as smooth as the picture, but sooooo good.  I doubled the pumpkin and used butter instead of shortening.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out beautifully.

I made these cookies for a holiday potluck at work and I thought they were awful.  There was one person who loved them and I sent him home with all of them.  I saw that a few users posted modifications to the original recipe, which I feel may have made them better - but I am reviewing the original recipe as is.

These were very good, easy to make, and turned out well.  The texture is really nice, very cakey.  I only wish they had a little more pumpkin and spice.  Next time I make them I'll add more and see how they turn out.  Nice recipe though!

7 dozen?! No where near. Maybe 2 dozen! I will also use 1 more can of pumpkin, next time I make these! Needs more pumpkin flavor!! I doubled the cinnamon & nutmeg, added allspice, ground cloves & ginger (all a dash). I also substituted brown sugar for the white sugar and used about 1/2 the amount of sugar. My cookies didn't spread out like typical chocolate chip cookies do. Oh well! Not bad!

Awesome!  I also added a 28 oz. can of pumpkin instead of 15 oz,  and a little more spice (cinnamon, ginger). I made these for my preschooler and his class and they LOVED it!  A definate keeper! Soft cookies...like muffin tops.  :)

Personally, I would much rather have a regular chocolate chip cookie.  I think it would be better with more spices.  I would add at least a tsp. of ginger if I made it again, which I probably won't.  It may be better with a pumpkin frosting.  Also, more nuts and chips wouldn't hurt either.  Maybe even sub some oatmeal instead of flour.

Was a bit disappointed with this recipe.  It lacks a bit of spice that other pumpkin recipes have and had a cake-like taste to it.

Love these. The only changes I make whatsoever are that I use chocolate chunks rather than chips (for some reason I SWEAR they make a difference) and I always cut it in half. Although Im sure that my cookies are way bigger than called for, I still get PLENTY! My family always requests that I make these and the best part about them?? They taste even better the next day!

This is an AWESOME recipe.  A great way to sneak some pumpkin into the kiddos :)  and they love it!  I use 2 cups of fresh pumpkin instead of the canned pumpkin that the recipe calls for.  Also, I make it in a 9x13 pan and them cut it into bars...like a brownie.  Yum, yum, yum!!!

this is one of a few cookies recipes I've discovered where the cookie is still soft the next day.  very delicious!
I didn't want to make 84 servings, so I just cut it in 1/2 ... although I still added 1C. of chocolate chips.  they came out perfect!

A friend of mine has made these with lots of substitutions to keep them moist, yet firm. Very good cookies!

Wow, this makes a LOT! Good thing they are yummy and I have a party this weekend. It's a bit bland on the pumpkin-front, but still tasty with half butterschotch and half chocolate chips. I was afraid that the dough was too thin to keep it's shape as a cookie, so I only did half as drop cookies, and half as cookie-bars in a 9x13 pan. It ends up the drop cookies did fine after all! For the last pan, I added more nutmeg, chips, and some cloves. With the extra flavor-oomph, these are five-star.

I've had better, but they're good.  I baked one sheet a couple minutes less and it was better. They are dry if cooked too long.

WOW!  Super tasty, I did make a few changes based on other reviews.  I doubled the pumpkin and chocolate chips.  Subbed flaxmeal for 1/2 of the butter, added cloves and ginger.  I, amazingly, have to say it had too many chocolate chips.  Great flavor, I really enjoyed them so did the family.  I will make them again but will use raisins instead of chocolate chips.

These are GREAT.  Very yummy with a cold glass of milk.  The recipe makes a ton of cookies which I didn't realize until all of the batter was prepared.

At first this recipe seemed odd; the combo of pumpkin and chocolate was weird to me. These flew off the table. The combo while different is wonderful!!!  They do get a little sticky though so be careful how you package them up for delivery or for bakesales. Use a plate under or it becomes a glob.

I make these for my cousin in CT when he comes home for the holidays. They are his favorite. I love the taste of pumpkin and chocolate together. It really is a good comdo. They compliment each other nicely. These are simple to make too.

We loved these cookies... they are more like little chocolate pumpkin muffins with their wonderful cake like consistancy.  We doubled the chocolate chips and decided not to add the nuts... Watch your timer... we had to pull them out around 11 and 1/2 minutes... mountain time

This recipes needs more cinnamon.
Other than that, this recipe is easy, very good, and makes a large batch.  I will definitely make them again.

These cookies were fun to make! They have a very adult flavor, almost not sweet at all except for the choocolate chips. They are not chewy, but cake-y and soft. Won't be your kids' favorite, but with a glass of milk, a more discerning palate could come to really appreciate these!

Quite easy to make. Since I didn't see a "yield" number, I decided to count. This recipe makes at least 10 1/2 dozen drop cookies, more or less, depending on the size of your cookies. I'll keep this recipe.

Like other reviewers I would say these are cake like cookies.  Good, but not what most people would consider a cookie texture.  I made half a recipe since I had 1/2 a can of pumpkin left over after making a pumpkin roll.  It made 24 large sized cookies.

These cookies are perfect. I did up the cinnamon to 1 1/2 teaspoons and the nutmeg to a full teaspoon as well. I had to cook for 13 minutes, but that was my only changes.

I used Garbonzo flour and needed to bake 22 minutes.  It’s a simple  and easy recipe.

I appreciated the other cooks recommendations  and used 1 cube butter and 1/2 cup shortening.  I also used additional spices.  Hubby loved them.

I followed the recipe exactly the first time. Then I made some changes. I like more spice so I used a combination of Cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and ginger.  I also used two cups of chocolate chips instead of just one. I also used butter instead of shortening.

I’ve made it in double batches. So I use a 29oz can of pumpkin. I don’t like nuts and chocolate together so I skip those too. Since I made so much my mom took some to work with her. One of her coworkers said he’d never had pumpkin chocolate chip cookies before and that mine changed his life! Anywho, my favorite cookie by far, and the best I’ve ever made myself.

I'm not at all impressed. I think these cookies are quite bland. There's absolutely nothing spectacular or 4.5 star worthy about them. Thank goodness for the chocolate chips or else they'd be flavorless. I definitely won't be making these ever again!!

I added extra cinnamon and pumpkin spice since I thought the batter lacked it. Like others said, more cake-like and fluffy. Could have a cream cheese frosting with it, but mine are for my husband to take to work and frosting would make that too messy.

Great recipe! After reading through some reviews, I decided to halve the recipe but still used a full can of pumpkin. I used applesauce for the fat, 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar and I upped the spices, plus added ground ginger and cloves. I only ever use a pinch of salt in baked goods in general. I used 1c mini chocolate chips and omitted the nuts. These turned out wonderfully and they definitely don't spread in the oven. I got 34 cookies. Will certainly make again!

The cookie is good although I will make some changes next time I make this recipe.  The pumpkin puree I used did not include any spices so I will add 1/4 tsp ground cloves; 1/2 tsp ground ginger; 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg and 1 tsp ground cinnamon or use 2 tsp of Pumpkin spice.   I also doubled the chocolate chips. I really liked the cake like cookie and will make them again.

This is the third time I've made them, and I think it'll be the best. I added pumpkin pie spice, ginger, ground cloves, as well as the cinnamon and nutmeg called for in the recipe.  I'm thinking of trying to make bar cookies with this one too.

I used Pillsbury gluten free flour , 1/2 cupcoconut oil instead of shortening, organic coconut palm sugar in place of the white sugar. I baked them for13. min. at 375 .   They were delicious and moist!   Most important, they passed the test with my grandson and husband!

Moist and delicious!  I used butter instead of shortening,  made the cookies larger (about 2 TBSP sized) and baked in a convection oven on 350 for about 12-14 minutes.

Long time Maine fall colored staple cookie. I couldn't find my grandmother's recipe so I built off this one. Instead of 1 cup of shortening, I used I stick butter (room temp) &  one small Apple Sauce 4 oz. Changed 2 cups of w. sugar to 1 1/2 c. brown sugar. I also added 1/4 tsp. of Nutmeg instead of a pinch.  Added 2 cups of chocolate chips (per my grandchildren's request) that's why I cut the sugar.  I make half of the batch without walnuts then add half a cup of walnuts to the rest of the mix. My husband took a batch to work and they were devoured. I'm going to cut 1/2 c. of flour on the next batch and see what that does, they seem to be a bit heavy. N. Maine is agriculture heaven, so we make us of everything grown up here, including the pumpkins!

My kids and I made these with minor changes in celebration of fall and decorating for Halloween. Everyone loves them. We had butter already pulled for cookies so used in place of shortening. We also added about 1/4 tsp of nutmeg, pinch of clove and pinch of coriander. In place of chocolate chips we used salted caramel chips. Delicious! We'll be making again for sure.

Delicious! I lost my infamous recipe for pumpkin chocolate chip cookies & stumbled upon this one, and I am so glad I did! I made a few adjustments: 1/2 butter, 1/2 butter flavored Crisco shortening, a pinch of ground cloves, and a pinch of ginger for extra flavor. They taste like Thanksgiving exploded in your mouth. :) They also have a very high yield, I got about 5 dozen from this batch. Will be making these again.

I've been making these for some time and they are awesome!! We love the cake like texture.  The only change I made was to omit the walnuts and add extra chocolate chips.  They freeze wonderfully and are great with a cup of coffee or tea.

Liked them!  My impression is that they're a bit like pumpkin bread in cookie form.  I really love pumpkin and chocolate together, too.  I am going to ice them to make them more decadent.

I just made these tonight and they are like nothing I've ever had! They are cake-like and like another reviewer said, they bake up exactly as you put them on the sheet.

Next time I will most definitely add more cinnamon and nutmeg and I think using the whole bag of chocolate chips is better. I'd imagine that mini chocolate chips would be fantastic in this recipe. 

I find that with pumpkin recipes, they always taste better the next day. Overall, this is a very interesting recipe worth a try.

I love this recipe! I made it for a work party and then again for thanksgiving and it's always a hit! The second time I made it, I added pumpkin pie seasoning and put extra nutmeg in it. It was much better with the extra seasonings in it!! Delicious- a cake like, simple cookie.

These aren't as moist as ones I've had in the past, or as spicy, they are more cake like and fluffy, just beautiful. If you like something more cookie like, look elsewhere. These were meant to be like this and I think they are lovely!

Phenomenal! I doubled the cinnamon and nutmeg: 2 t. cinnamon, added 1 t. ginger, 1/2 t. allspice and 1/2 t. nutmeg. I doubled the chocolate chips in mini version. Awesome. This was my first time making, but definitely not the last!

great recipe!! made them yesterday and my family & friends wont stop gobbling them up!=) i did make a few changes to the recipe like always but instead of using 2c white sugar i used 1c white/1c brown sugar, an extra tsp vanilla, and instead of just nutmeg and cinnamon i added a tsp of pumpkin pie spice! YUM YUM YUM!! be prepared for those of u who havent made pumpkin cookies, they have a tendency to be a bit cake like, very fluffy and moist! enjoy!

Overall we like the cookies.  I used butter instead of shortening.  And 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of all of the spices separately, however, I did end up adding 1tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of nutmeg more, just because.  I used all brown sugar instead of white sugar I realized after I had started I was out of white sugar.  And  I used 1 cup chocolate chips and a 12 oz bag of white chocolate chips.  I used a spoon to flatten out the cookies a bit before baking.  The kids like them and I like them, but they seem to be missing something.  I'm not sure what.  The recipe is a keeper though and I will be making it again.

I thought I'd like the choc chips in this, but I think it would be better without them. I added about a quarter cup more pumpkin to boost the pumpkin flavor.

These were good, but definitely not my favorite. I used a whole bag of semi sweet chocolate chips and butter instead of shortening.  They ended up burning a little on the bottom (could be an oven issue, though I've never had that happen before).  And they turned out really cakey.  I was expecting them to be cakey from the reviews, but they were incredibly so.  I liked the flavor, but my husband couldn't get into the cakeiness...

My family loves these cookies.  The cake-like consistency that seems to put some folks off, is a non-issue for us; these cookies disappear.  I use the Pampered Chef cookie scoop and love how the cookies hold their shape.

Delicious. I followed reviewer Kerri's advice and used 1.5 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice instead of the other spices. I used  chocolate chips as recipe called for but I also added 1cup raisins. I did not put the nuts in. absolutely will make again.

These cookies are so light and delicious!  I'm baking them right now.  They just melt in my mouth!  I will use this recipe for all our pumpkin cookies.  The only thing we did different was to accidentally add an extra cup of sugar. They are sooooooooo good!  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe...I used a scoop and the cookies stayed perfectly round and plumped up during baking.  I didn't have any nutmeg, so I substituted a pinch of allspice and cloves instead, and it was fine.

These were pretty good. The texture is certainly different than most cookies, but I thought that it was an interesting change. I doubled the amount of chocolate chips and am glad that I did because I thought that they needed to be just a touch sweeter. A great cookie selection for the fall!

These cookies taste like a real good cake like chocolate chip cookie, but not much of a pumpkin flavor. I even increased the nutmeg to 1/2 tsp. My family will probably like these because there is not much of a pumpkin flavor.

These are interesting "cookies".  My 2 year old and I liked them, but my husband hates them.  He wouldn't even finish the one he tastes.  I substituted 1 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice for the cinnamon and nutmeg and added 1/4 more chocoloate chips.  I probably won't make again, unless I get some rave reviews from friends that I share these with......my son and I can't possibly eat them ALL.

Just finished making these and a majority of the cookies mysteriously "vanished" from the plate...sign of a good cookie recipe!  My only suggestion would be what everyone else has said:  add MORE spice to the mix (pumpkin pie spice would work nicely as would some clove).  I'm off to secure a few cookies for myself...

This recipe is much better if made with twice the pumpkin called for, twice the cinnamon (or sub w/ 2 t. pumpkin pie spice), and half again to twice as many choc. chips. With these changes, I'd give it 5 stars.  Yummy!

These were okay, but not very cookie-like.  More like good lumps of pumpkin bread.  I thought we followed the recipe exactly, but it would seem something went wrong.

These were pretty good!  Definitely cake-like.  I only got 62 out of the recipe.  I used the Pampered Chef medium size scoop.  These cookies will surely hold the shape in which you put them.  They do not spread!  I used self-rising flour and left out the salt, soda and powder.  I didn't have nutmeg, so I used pumpkin pie spice.  I used margarine instead of shortening.  Also added butterscotch chips and the walnuts!  These cookies would not be the same without the butterscotch.  These were good, but not my favorite cookie of all time.  I like chewy ones!  I should rate this a five for fool proofness and easiness.

This recipe is one of those which you must try it and you will be surprised it contains 'pumpkin'. The appearance isn't as attractive as a smily face pumpkin, but the taste is one to make you smile!
