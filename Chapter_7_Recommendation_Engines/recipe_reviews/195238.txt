The whole family loved it. I made a few changes: first, I marinated the tofu in soy sauce for a few hours before cooking.  I pre-baked the tofu to give it a meatier texture.  I used canned pineapple tidbits for the pineapple juice, then threw the tidbits into the pan at the end of cooking. Next time, I will saute onions and peppers to add to it. It was a winner with all family members!

This was my first time cooking tofu and my family loved it.  I cooked it with sliced mushrooms, a quartered white onion and a sliced green bell pepper.  I then mixed fettuccine noodles with fresh baby spinach and topped it with the maple glazed tofu/veggies.  I added a little bit of hot sauce to balance the sweetness of the maple.  I thought it was a little too sweet and needed something to balance it out, so I added a tablespoon of sriracha hot chili sauce.  My family loved it and gobbled the whole bowl up.

Excellent recipe. We just made it for Easter for the vegetarians in the family (i.e. me LOL). We followed some of the other reviewers suggestions like marinating the tofu in soy sauce, adding onions and pineapple tidbits. We also added whole cooked carrots and asparagus to the mix. It was sooooo good. I was worried it would be too sweet also, but I feel the mustard and soy sauce balanced it out. This one is a keeper!

I used a little less mustard (didn't measure it) marinated the tofu in soy sauce, and used a 14 oz package of tofu.  I increased the liquid ingredients by 1/2 and had alot left in the pan, so I don't think I needed to. I just wanted the tofu to top a salad. I could see how it would be good with veggies over rice. We did enjoy it, but I probably wouldn't make it again...too many calories. Was a nice recipe to try, and very easy.

LOVED IT! I added a tiny drop of liquid smoke seasoning and a tiny drop of sesame oil, and this made it absolutely perfect. Thanks for a great recipe!

Was a decent recipe. The glaze tasted a bit too much of mustard when I made it so ended up about doubling the soy and adding a tsp of Worcestershire sauce and a bit more syrup. Though the mustard I used was Dijon mustard with whole seeds in it and that might have been the problem. Next time I will be using half the mustard, and adding the Worcestershire again. Definitely worth a try, if you like tofu.

Delicious!  I marinated the tofu in soy sauce for about 15 mins and used orange juice instead of pineapple (I'm allergic).  I also added a bunch of steamed veggies to the glaze just before it was done reducing.  Came out great!

Very tasty recipe, I felt compelled to add shredded ginger, which perfected the sauce. There was enough sauce here for 2 bricks of tofu, so next time I'd make a half recipe for one brick. Sliced green onions also ought to be sliced on top before serving. Very good!

Very good recipe, if you want to avoid it being too sweet like many of the reviews mention make sure you use real maple syrup (so avoid brands like Aunt Jemima that are just corn syrup). I will definitely be making this again in the future.

I loved making this!!!

However, I made 3x the serving. Use 1/3rd less of the maple syrup. It's very sweet, even as I reduced it.

I also used brown mustard powder as opposed to brown mustard ready-made.
When using powder, dilute 1 teaspoon with 1 teaspoon vinegar and 1 teaspoon water- per helping.

Otherwise, this is absolutely delicious!

this was so good, it tastes like teriyaki which I love. I can't wait to share with friends at work. Also I cheated a little on the browing step and added butter to make it a little crispy.

I made this only once, felt it was to sweet. It had an overpowering maple flavor.  Also, sauce never thickened on it's own, I had to add cornstarch to thicken it.  I will make this again but cut back the amount of maple syrup and maybe add a pinch of ground red pepper to balance out the sweetness.

while this dish was not horrible, it was lacking depth of flavor.. sweet is all that came through....bf's daughter even said she liked Faken (Veggie Bacon) from this site more.. i cut the recipe in half and subbed mango nectar for the pineapple juice.. i tripled the soy sauce and halved the mustard (dijon), added a dash of liquid smoke and sesame oil.. used this to marinate 12 oz of tofu overnight.. we grilled/smoked it and basted throughout.. it was just "okay"

This was the first time I cooked tofu (in the past I would always go out for it) and I am just so incredibly pleased with the finished result! The meal was absolutely delicious! The sauce had a sweetness to it that wasn't overpowering and it was so incredibly easy to make. I served this over white rice.

The sauce smelled great before but it was just waaaay to sweet. I did not like all of the maple syrup. Maybe less maple syrup and more soy sauce and mustard.

Wonderful! I had been in a cooking rut and this got me out of it! I used 2/3 c syrup, 2/3 c. orange juice, 1T dijon, 1.5t soy sauce for my sauce. I marinated the tofu(2 pkgs)in soy sauce for 30 mins, fried it out in 1T sesame oil, added 1 chopped yellow pepper, 1/2 C shredded carrot (for color), 1 lg can drained pineapple tidbits, and 6 chopped gr onions. It was still very sweet, as other reviewers have noted, but adding a titch of soy sauce at the table can easily overcome that! I served it with gelled cranberries. It was a hit with EVERYONE in the family and I have some picky eaters!

This recipe was WAY too sweet.  Even with the mustard and the soy sauce, it tasted like tofu candy.
