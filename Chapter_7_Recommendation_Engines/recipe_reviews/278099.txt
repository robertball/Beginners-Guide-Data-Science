The frosting was great.  Cupcakes had a nice texture but weren't sweet at all.They didn't have a lot of peanut butter flavor either. I wouldn't make these again.

These were a huge hit for our new neighbors. I made the peanut butter cupcake recipe as listed.  Although I did use vanilla bean paste  in place of vanilla extract. I did need to add a little milk to the banana butter frosting as it was very thick.
