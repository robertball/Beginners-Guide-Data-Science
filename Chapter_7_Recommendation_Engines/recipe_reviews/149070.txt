Holy frijoles.....these smell AMAZING. Even as muffin dough. Holy cow. I used the Rice Krispies with the strawberries in it and added one small banana which I cut into small bits. I made no other changes. This did make exactly 12 muffins which were on the bigger size of medium. Moist and very fruity. Keeper!

These were actually pretty good.  I liked the crunch of the Rice Krispies with the pineapple in there.  My neighbor thought they were awesome.  I probably wouldn't make them again, but they were a good way to use up some old cereal.  :)

I am impressed with the ease of this recipe.  With a few tweaks you can very the flavor nicely.  I like this version it's simple,flavorful,and moist. Try it with a dash of cloves or some nutmeg too.
