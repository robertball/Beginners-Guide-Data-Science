This method is pretty darn cool. The hot dog gets that almost crunchy outer skin up and down the dog. Applying the method takes some time to get it right. I ended up with many hot dog pieces. I wasn't able ro replicate the number of spirals as shown in the original picture. Regardless, this really will be the only way I serve hot dogs from now on. I made my own sauces and toppings and served them in corn tortillas so they were gluten free.
