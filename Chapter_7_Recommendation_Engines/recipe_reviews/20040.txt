Really great recipe and used many times. My recommendation is (combining many other recommendations): make sure you get the amount of turkey right. Many times people complain it’s too salty, but if you’re sure to get the right amount of turkey (which is 1 ½ lbs.) , it should be about right. Use about 1 and 3/4 lbs. of turkey (or hamburger!) instead of the recommended 1and ½  lbs., if you tend to be weary of salt. Cooking at a nice medium low heat does help if you are using leaner meat, otherwise the outside can get overdone. Definitely consider freezing the remaining patties in the freezer! They are GREAT to remove in the morning and throw on the grill for a quick meal later on.

Excellent recipe...my 11 year old son...very picky eater...really enjoyed this. I used Lipton Onion Roasted Garlic dried soup mix...didn't need to add any other garlic. Took the advice of another reviewer...cooked this very low on the BBQ to make sure it cooked all the way through without burning the outside...great idea. This is a keeper. Thanks Kym22

Quick, easy and tasty!  So good that you might defeat the purpose of low-fat cooking by eating more than you should.  I speak from experience.

Though I used extra lean ground turkey, the burgers still remained quite moist.  If you use extra-lean ground turkey, be careful with your heat.  Too much heat will burn the outsides of your burgers if you are working with extra-lean turkey.  I added some low-fat Swiss cheese and with relish, ketchup, mustard and onions - this was a Friday night feast!  To add to the healthfulness of the recipe, I used eggbeaters instead of an egg and whole wheat hamburger buns.  I will have this recipe again and again.

Very flavorful and easy to make.  I made up a big batch shaped them into patties and froze the ones I didn't need.  Those cooked up prefectly a week later.

We used to eat turkey burgers all the time and I got tired of how flat and boring they were.  These were excellent - tasty and juicy!  I used 2 lbs of turkey (I could only find 1 lb packs at the store), 2 eggs and 2 heaping tsp of minced garlic and got 10 burgers - I can't wait to finish them off!

These were great! First time making turkey burgers-- didn't change a thing and was NOT too salty. They were moist and I even used the 99% fat free grd turkey breast. Definitely a keeper recipe! Thanks for sharing.

These turkey burgers were awesome - even my husband thought they came very close to hamburger and he's a tough sell because he really likes his beef.  I used low sodium soy sauce, left out the egg, and used minced garlic from the jar.  For some reason onion soup mix works with ground turkey - I was skeptical because if you use it for ground beef burgers they end up tasting like meatloaf on a roll.  It's not the case with ground turkey, these were moist and delicious. I served these on 7 grain rolls and will definitely make these again.

My picky family raved about this recipe last night!  It's rare when we all agree!  I used an egg white instead of whole egg, like suggested earlier.  Also, put a slice of canadian bacon and pineapple ring with some fat-free mayo!  Yummy hawaiian turkey burgers!  This recipe will be enjoyed for years to come!

This recipe is wonderful.  These are equally as great on the grill as well as in the pan.  I have shared it with quite a few people since I discovered it.
My whole family loves it, including my finicky 2 year old!  Thanks for a quick and
delicious recipe!

This is exactly how I do my turkey burgers. To avoid dryness though, the trick is to add 1 tablespoon olive oil to the mix. Sometimes instead of soy sauce I'll do worchestire sauce or a couple tablespoons of barb-q sauce. I add 1 teas of fresh garlic too. Yum.

My husband called from work and asked if I would make turkey burgers for lunch.  We make turkey burgers quite often, but thought I would look for a variation.   I quickly went to Allrecipes and came across this recipe.  I did add the egg and 1/3 cup oatmeal, 1/3 packet onion mix, a little soy, A1, and worchestershire sauce (1 tsp ea), and then topped with white cheddar last minute or so.  I then topped with sliced avocado.  They were delicious!  The secret ingredient is the onion soup mix!  Thanks for sharing.

I HIGHLY recommend topping these with monterey jack cheese, avacado and the roasted red pepper mayonnaise from another turkey burger recipe on this site (1/3 cup light mayo, 2 T. chopped roasted red peppers, 1/2 tsp grated lemon peel, 1/8 tsp salt and a quick squeeze of lemon juice).  I doubled the recipe for our family of 8, but did not double the onion soup mix as many have suggested it's too much. These are delicious turkey burgers!

I love these burgers! They are easy to put together, juicy and flavorful. I used 1 pound of foster farms ground turkey. To that I added 1 package of Lipton Onion Soup Mix and 1 garlic clove, egg, slightly beaten, little soy sauce and fresh ground black pepper. My patties may have been a little larger so I ended up with 5 instead of 6 burgers. They did not take long to cook up on the grill, about 20 minutes, only flipping once. I served these on hamburger buns with thick slices of local tomatoes and manoa lettuce. The burgers are well seasoned, nothing overpowering at all. They are juicy and tasty, not dry and not needing any extra condiments (ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, etc) to the burgers. The preparation, ingredients and cooking time are approximate. I served the burgers along with, "Baked Sweet Potato Sticks," also from this website. These baked sweet potatoes are also VERY good by the way and complement the turkey burgers nicely.

So easy and my family loves them. Only modification my family requires is that, in an effort to use more natural ingredients, I actually use an organic french onion dip mix; fantastic!! This is the one dinner my husband requests regularly.

A++++++Zowie!  This was so meaty and tasty.  I did add a slice of sharp chedder cheese to each patty and sauted onions on top of that.  I also added a smidge of bread crumbs.  Turned out so good we did not even need buns.  Yum!  We will keep this around.  Thank you so much for this post.

Good recipe. My store carries only 1.25 lb packages of ground turkey so used about 2/3 pkg of onion soup mix, no soy sauce (didn't want too salty) and a tsp or 2 of steak sauce. Used egg white and also about 1/4 cup bread crumbs. Try using the beef onion soup mix- gives a 'beefier' taste.

We had these for dinner this evening, and they were the best turkey burgers I have ever had.  I too, was concerned that they may be too salty, but they weren't.  They were moist too!  Trader Joe's has organic turkey patties in their frozen section.  They have no fillers or spices, just turkey meat.  I used 1 1/2 pkgs. (1 1/2 lbs.) of the turkey patties, thawed, and mixed together with recipe ingredients.  I was well pleased, and will definitely make these again.  The children ate all of theirs, and they are ages 2, 5 and 7.

Fantastic!   My picky teenage son didn't even realize that they weren't made of beef and said they were his 'second favorite' of many hamburger recipes I've tried.    I loved how lean they were and easy to cook in a pan on the stove, without ending up with them swimming in fat.

These were good. I used the Onion & Golden Mushroom dry soup mix as it is what I had on hand. I mixed up all the ingredients and let sit in fridge for 30 minutes. Grilled these on a grill tray since they were so moist they would fall through the grill grates. Served them with Sweet Potato fries and strawberries. Yummy!

I don't cook red meat in our house, but we love burgers. I have never been a fan of the turkey burger, until now. This recipe was delicious. And my kids still say it's the best burger they have ever tasted!

Incredible, packed with flavor and DELICIOUS! I used extra lean ground (Jennie-O) turkey, and cooked on my Foreman grill for 5 minutes. They turned out very moist. So, so good.

This is a good basic idea... i do agree that if you use all of the soy sauce and all of the soup mix it is too salty. I cut back on both and they were delicious! Everyones tastebuds are different!

Delicious! Added italian seasoned breadcrumbs and substituted creole seasoing for the black pepper for a little bit of a kick! They turned out great! We will definitely be making these again!

Used 2 lb ground lean turkey, but kept all the other ingredients the same. Easy to make and my husband and daughter thought they were good. Served with sweet potatoe fries and coleslaw with chopped apples. Thanks!

Great flavor!  Thought they'd fall apart on the grill, as they seemed pretty delicate, but just let them sit for a while on a well oiled grate without turning and they'll hold together just fine.

Everyone liked this - even my little brother who might well be the pickiest eater in the state! I made a couple changes since I only had 1lb. of ground turkey, and no soy sauce. Instead I subbed 1tbsp Worcestershire sauce, and then added breadcrumbs to absorb the extra liquid until I could actually form patties.

I love this recipe and have used it dozens of times. I have a red meat and potato friend that I duped into eating one of these and he loved it.  I subbed the soy for teriyaki sometimes to add some sweetness and I always cut the onion soup mix in half.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

This was the absolute worst recipe I've tried from this website! Words cannot describe how very disappointed we were! The burgers were so dry it was as if we were chewing on cardboard. I even took the suggestions of a few others and added Worcestershire, A-1 Sauce, oats and fresh grated garlic for added flavor, but to NO avail. They were bland, flavorless and dry... so awful that we couldn't even finish them. BLAH!

Since the hubby is a MEAT eater...he likes his 100% angus beef burgers...he wasn't too keen on the idea of me making a turkey burger.  I liked it...tasted great and healthier, unfortunately hubby didn't like all that much.  So, we compromised on the rating.  Thanks for the post.

I've tried turkey burgers a couple of times before and they haven't worked out.  I decided to give these a shot when ground turkey was on sale.  These were ridiculously easy.  I used a countertop skillet that is plugged into the wall to cook my burgers, basically frying them, and they cooked right through and stayed together, both of which were previously challenges.  The flavors were good (I used low sodium soy sauce) and my family decided they might even prefer them to traditional beef burgers.  I'll definitely be making these again.

These burgers were too on the soft side for me.  My guests ate them and liked them but didn't think they were that great.  More towards a meatloaf taste than a burger taste.  The seasonings were overwhelming - I'd cut back on them if I were to make them again.  Or I'd use this recipe to make a "turkey loaf".  Cooked nicely on my 'non-george forman indoor grill'.

Very good recipe!  I was a little worried it would be too salty with both the Lipton Onion Soup Mix and soy sauce, but it was not at all!  Very moist.  I topped it off with swiss cheese.  It was also a nice change because ground turkey breast can be so dry and boring!  Yummy!  Will make again!

These are so full of flavor!  I added a little panko and a little parmesan cheese.  My teens liked them so much that I made extra and put them in individual ziplock bags and froze them for after school snacks.

These burgers are so good!  I had a 3 lb. pack of ground turkey, so I doubled the recipe, other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  These are way better than any of the premade patties I've bought in the past.

Too salty, couldn't finish eating them. I would not add the soy sauce, even though it did not call for too much, that's all i could taste. The rest of the flavor was good but like i said way too salty. For us at least.

although I did enjoy these the first time I made them I found that there are better Turkey Burger recipes out there. 

They are just ok. 

I had to use only 1 Tablespoon of the onion soup mix, as I only make 1 pound of Turkey for my family of 4. 

I also seemed to always get a stomach ache every night after I would make these, I advise anyone to make these on the stove if you have stomach problems as it is very easy to over cook the outside and under cook the inside.

be sure to use the "lid" technique on ANY burgers...where you form the patties in a large plastic lid and then refrigerate to get even patties that hold together well, before I knew this all my burgers were uneven and lumpy

This sounded like it would be great. However, the patties we like mush (even after the chilling) and fell through the grill. This recipe needed breadcrumbs or something. TOTAL DISAPPOINTING FRUSTRATION!

I thought these were very good and I'm not crazy about turkey burgers. I made smaller patties and cooked on low heat; they were super juicy! I omitted the egg bc I was out. I used lite soy sauce and didn't add quite as much to cut back on saltiness. Also used fresh garlic. Will make again!

These are obviously made with dry onion soup mix - meaning, well, salt-base dried onion.  'Not saying it 's bad, just clear.  I had 20oz white turkey so just used 2T soup mix.  Added 2T plain bread crumbs & 1/2c shredded cheddar.  No egg.  'Think it'd be better with beef, maybe less mix.  'Not bad, not great.  'Doubt I'll make again, but it'd be good inapinch.  E, 15, liked 'em; but not as much as others.

I made these with a little less soy sauce and onion soup mix because I added the "Mushrooms with a Soy Sauce Glaze" on top and a slice of swiss cheese, and I was afraid it would be too much salt.  They came out very tasty.. a little dry but I thought maybe I cooked them a bit too long.

These are ok.  I was looking for a flavorful recipe that is easy to prepare.  I let these refrigerate overnight so I'm hoping that is where this recipe went wrong.  When i cooked the burgers they kind of swelled up and got  chewy almost : (

Second time I have tried turkey burgers, first time not good.  I love this recipe but I added 1/2 cup of Panko Italian Seasoned bread crumbs because I thought it was a little too wet.  Worked out really well.   My husband loved them and so did I.  It's a keeper, thank you! Catherine

The burgers were extremely small after they were cooked, and I had made them as big as I could without flattening them out too much. They were also nearly burnt - and would have been ruined had I not checked them - 4 minutes in. The suggestion must not have been for a propane grill. Medium high was far too hot, and twenty minutes with only one flip was not accurate. I did, however, enjoy the flavor after the temp and time adjustments. Be sure to plan for small burgers unless you adjust the portion.

My family LOVED this recipe!  I used 2.5 lbs of ground turkey from Sam's Club and added 1 envelope of onion soup mix, 2 tsp of minced garlic, 2 eggs, 2 Tbsp. soy sauce to make 8 burgers.   I panfried them in a little olive oil. OMG!  Can't wait to have them again!

I have tried many, many of your recipes and I cannot recall a recipe that I didn't like.  I am just not real good at taking the time to rate them.  Anyway, This turkey burger recipe is absolutely tops.  I didn't change a thing in the recipe.  What flavor!  My wife and I are avid turkey hunters.  This is great with wild turkey breast.  Not being a fan of the turkey burger in general, I didn't expect much out of a short simple recipe.  Boy, I was fooled.  This recipe goes in the recipe book for keeps  Thank you for opening my tast buds.

Delicious!  Be careful about adding too much egg, it makes it hard to keep together as a burger.  (We halved the recipe, but still tried adding a whole egg.)  Nutritionally, the onion soup mix can add a LOT of sodium, so I would look for a low-sodium alternative.

These are excellent burgers only thing I did different was that I chopped half an onion and added it to the meat mixture.  Very juicy for a turkey burger!

I gave this 4 stars for one reason - a little too salty for our tastes.  Otherwise they were wonderful! the only change I made was adding a bit of worcestershire for a little kick. I cooked them on our panini maker, so that cut the cooking time to about 5 - 10 minutes.  I think next we'll leave out the onion soup mix to help cut down on the sodium, and just add onions ourselves. I would make again! and soon!

WAY TOO SALTY.  I couldn't even eat this.  I thought it would taste better with condiments but it was just too dry and salty.  Tasted like onion soup mix burgers. My boyfriend like it though.

Great flavor! I've already made these 2 times. Only change was to use Worchestershire sauce instead of soy sauce since I was out of soy and they still were moist and flavorful. This recipe is a keeper.

This was a great, very easy recipe, and I loved the topping suggestions...the sprouts and avocado were fantastic on these burgers!  The only change I made was adding about 1/2 cup of seasoned breadcrumbs to bind a bit better. My 1 year old, 3 year old and husband all loved them!  I highly recommed this recipe and will make them again!  Thanks so much!!

I'm not a big turkey burger fan but my husband is and he thinks these were the best we've made thus far. I used an onion and mushroom soup mix and I put them in a non-stick skillet which kept them together nicely.  For turkey burgers I think they were tasty and easy.

The only downside was on my part, I cooked the burgers a little too long. However, I did a couple of drops of lemon juice & that created a nice balance.

This is a hit at my house. The recipe is perfect just as it is. The only other thing I do is add a little bit of Italian breadcrumbs into the mix to help form the patties.

my family loved this! i substituted liquid smoke for the soy sauce because i have one child who doesn't like soy sauce. the burgers are really sticky, so don't forget to oil the grill, but they hold together nicely once they are cooked.

Everyone really liked these a lot.  It was a bit mushy, so I had to put in some plain bread crumbs.  Next time, I'll just use a little less of the soup mix also.  Will definitely make again.

Prepared these exactly as directions state. I thought they were pretty good. Not overly salty, in my opinion. The taste kind of reminded me of a Salisbury steak. I made them on our Foreman Grill, cooked for about 15 minutes. Got 5 good- size patties. I served them on a sesame bun with tomato slices, swiss cheese and avocado. I would probably rate them 3.5 stars if I could but my husband thought they were great. He said they were the best turkey burgers I've made, so I feel like 4 stars is fair. Thanks for recipe!

These were delicious!! I did however make a few changes. I used Worchestershire sauce instead of soy sauce, minced cloves of garlic instead of garlic powder, and added 2 Tbl of plain breadcrumbs. I cooked them on the Foreman for about 10-15 minutes and topped each burger with a slice of Reduced Fat Pepper Jack cheese! My boyfriend (who refuses to eat turkey burgers) loved them as well!!

My husband will not eat anything I make with ground turkey because he says "it has a specific taste". When I made this recipe, he not only ate it, but he said "this meat was really good". I made it in a pan instead of the grill because we live in a condo and do not have a bbq. I used 15% fat turkey and even saved some of the mixture to make the following day. I think that one was even better that the first days batch. The second day, we had them with white basmati rice instead of hamburger style (more like a kabob style). YUMMY!

Wow!  These are great!  I made exactly as directed.  I skipped the optional egg and only had a 1.25lb package of extra lean turkey.  The burgers turned out great!!!!  All I know is I'm hooked!

I made sliders using these ingredients... they were VERY tasty.  even the picky eater who doesnt like hamburgers enjoyed them!  The only change I sort of made was using low sodium soy sauce so they werent too salty.

We've tried many other seasonings for turkey burgers and these were the best of all.  No mods to recipe and they were perfect right off the grill.

I had long given up on turkey burgers, they always seem to disappoint.  So you can imagine my surprise when these turned out delicious!  Even my anti-turkey hubby said he liked them enough to eat them again.  It is true that they ARE a little too salty, so take some of the seasoning out of the onion soup packet if you can.  Try them, they really are delicious!

These were really good. My family loved them. I just felt like they were missing some depth. Maybe I'm just comparing them too closely with ground beef. Overall very good. I paired them with oven baked parmesan fries from this site which are also very good.

Very tasty!  I only had 1lb of turkey so I used 3/4 of the packet of soup mix. I also added some garlic powder and a dash of italian seasoning. Kids loved them.  Thanks!

have not had turkey burgers for years but with the price of beef going up (and i live in nebraska where you cant swing a stick and not hit a cow) i thought i would try again. this is the first recipe i tried and wow! it is very good and i will be adding this to my menu more often. made as directed and used on the george forman grill, fliping and rotating them halfway through to get the cross grill mark. add some sharp chedder cheese for a real treat.

Did not work for us. If we hadn't done it on the grill I think it would have been worse. I agree with one reviewer that it tasted like onion soup burgers. It wasn't terrible, but wasn't one we would do again.

The flavor of the turkey burgers was fantastic.. Along with other reviewers I found that the mixture was a little too "wet", so I added some breadcrumbs... Big mistake on my part, as they turned out a little meatloaf-ey.  I will definitely try this recipe again, perhaps with only egg whites and way less breadcrumbs!!

I'm trying to cut back on some of the fat in my diet. I thought that by switching from beef to turkey, I'd be sacrificing a lot of flavor. NOT AT ALL. These were AMAZING. I followed the recipe exactly. I put the burgers on my George Foreman grill. So full of flavor! Be careful with the amount of meat. If you don't use the correct amount, they'll be super salty. Next time, I might try adding some brown rice, maybe something green like bits of chopped broccoli just to get a bit more nutritional bang for my buck. Really, anything that's light and fresh would go well with these burgers. Fresh tomatoes, avocado, maybe some fun cheeses like feta...I also use this recipe for faux gyros. I smash up a burger, put it into a whole wheat pita, and top it with tzatziki sauce. Yum!

As written, this recipe did not work for me. The burgers were too "wet" and oozed down between the grill grates. They made a huge mess of the grill! I added about 1/4 cup of bread crumbs and tried again and they were amazing! I think maybe no egg and they would have been ok.

Just made these burgers--my husband said, "They're better than beef burgers."  In my book, enough said.  I will be making these again.    This time I used a Foreman grill.  I left the lid up and cooked each side for ten minutes.   Delicious!

This was my first time experimenting with ground turkey. It was a pretty easy recipe to follow. My burgers were a tad dry. I would recommend this recipe to my friends. I'll continue to play around with it.

Delicious!! I was actually looking for a turkey meatloaf recipe - these are SO much better, since they're individual servings, and no bun needed!  My husband and daughter are die-hard beef burger fans, and couldn't imagine a patty - let alone a TURKEY patty - being edible - let alone TASTY - all by itself.  This surpassed everyone's expectations, including my own - I had mine in a salad.  Yum... I'd read the reviews and was leery of it being too salty, so used low-sodium soy.  Cooked on stove top, about 5-6 minutes per side.  I'll be making these often!

This was the first time I've made turkey burgers on my own. I bought the wrong soup mix, so I used some garlic powder and onion powder instead, and I also substituted worcester sauce for the soy sauce. IN addition, I also mixed in some shredded cheddar cheese (maybe 1/4 cup). Delicious and very moist--my picky husband loved it!

I used 1.5lbs of turkey and 1/4 lb of hamburger. Good with cheddar or swiss cheese. Grilled on a charcoal grill for that extra flavor. Perfect recipe for a summer cookout with friends. Yum!

Very simple and very good. The onion mix took away that nasty ground turkey taste that I so dislike when I make turkey burgers. I took out some of the powder from the onion soup mix so that it wouldn't be too salty. They came out great.

These didn't turn out to have much flavor at all. I will have to read more reviews and see if there are some recommendations to improve the flavor.

I used half  envelope of onion soup mix and these burgers were a tad to salty for me, next time I'll try 1/3 of an envelope. Otherwise I think this is a great recipe. The turkey has a great taste.

These were quite good. We added the egg, and ended up having to add breadcrumbs because it made the meat quite 'gooey' Would make again.

Turkey burgers were pretty tasty. I used 2 lbs. of meat and 1 oz of onion mix, and used worchister instead of soy sauce and they turned out great. Thanks for recipe.

These are the best turkey burgers, I used extra lean ground turkey and they were amazingly moist and they stayed together quite well.  It was raining so I cooked these inside on the electric griddle at 375 (you need to cook these slow otherwise the outside will burn before the inside is cooked) and served on buttered toasted bread with American cheese (so really they were patty melts) but they were honestly as good as any burger.  My kids didn't know the difference from beef, I will be making these a lot this summer!

Really simple and really good!  I am sure the recipe is good as is, but, I changed it a little to suite our tastes.   I subsituted 1 tablespoon worcestire sauce and 3/4 tablespoon A-1 sauce for the soy sauce. I prepared the rest of the recipe as stated. I just fryed them in a frying pan on the stovetop, but, the cooking time was the same and they were moist and juicy. One little tip - if you find your turkey patties are too sticky - VERY LIGHTLY dust them in flour before frying.  It makes them more manageable and they brown nicely.

I had planned on making the recipe exactly as written, but turned out that my onion packet was expired! So I sub'd 1/4 tsp onion powder and 1/2 small sweet onion chopped, and it came out perfect. It made me look like a hero! My husband loved it, and asked for it weekly. I cooked it on the stove, and covered it for the last 6 minutes or so. Thanks!!

You have to like onion flavor because these burgers are packed with it. I enjoyed them but used 3/4 of a packet of soup & Worcester sauce in place of the soy. Put the patties on a hot greased skillet for 4 minutes, flipped, cooked 2 minutes, then covered the pan 4 minutes longer. Juicy, packed with flavor, & delicious.

This recipe is horrible. I just made this for dinner and it could not be finished by anyone. It's very salty and the onion/soy sauce mixture is overwhelming. I do not recommend this to anyone. If I could give it 0 stars out of 5, I would.

Yumm!
I added 3/4C finely chopped celery, 1/2C finely chopped carrots, 1 large red bell finely chopped, 1 slice whole wheat toast, crumbed, and 1/2C finely chopped walnuts, and 1-2 drops liquid smoke.  Was able to "sell" as veggie burgers to kids who claim to hate turkey.
Enjoyed by kids and adults!

These burgers are definitely worth trying.  Not only were they simple and quick, my very picky 9 yr old, 4 yr old and 2 yr old ate them and asked for seconds. I switched up the recipe a little: only used 3/4 onion soup packet, substituted soy sauce with worcestershire sauce (since I was out of soy), egg white only, and while burgers were on the grill, I brushed on a very small amount of A-1 steak sauce. My very finicky eaters loved them and they did taste very similar to steak burgers (as good as it gets for turkey). Just watch the temp on the grill so they don't burn before they're cooked.  Low heat worked best. I will definitely cook these again!

These are great!  I like to add 1 raw potato, peeled and grated to the mixture using the optional egg.  It makes for a nice filler compared  to those mushy bread crumbs.

This was so easy and the best burger I have ever had.  remember to make the inside of the burger slightly thinner so that when the center puffs up during cooking the burger will be flat when it is finished cooking.

Delicious...I substituted with beef onion soup mix and worchestershire sauce, added fresh garlic, then seasoned with red pepper and Tony's seasoned salt after forming the patties.  Topped with carmelized onions, jalapeno slices, lettuce and tomato with spicy mustard and spicy mayo.  My hubby, who hates anything not dripping in grease, gobbled up two and asked me to make more to take for lunch the next day.  Thanks - great recipe!

So good and so easy.   Instead of the soy sauce, I used 1/2 tsp of worcestershire.  I cooked the burgers in a cast iron skillet for about 25 minutes, covered.  I also put pepper jack on top.  We will definitely be having this one again!

Easy and quite good.  I made them into meatballs and fried them up in a tiny bit of veggie oil in my cast iron skillet.  Delish!

Delicious!  My husband and I both loved these burgers.  I used only half of the onion soup mix, 2 teaspoons of Worcest. instead of the soy sauce, and only an egg white. I also added a small amount of bread crumbs.

Yummy! Took the suggestions to halve the onion mix and soy sauce, and added some breadcrumbs to add more constistency, since I used the egg.

I made this recipe for my meat eating boys (and hubby) and they loved it. They actually thought that it was beef. My husband ate three burgers by himself. This is definately a "KEEPER". Thanks so much for this recipe. One thing I would like to suggest is that if you like to have more of a beef flavor used the "beef and onion soup mix" this helps the burger taste more like beef.

These were very tasty, however with the onion soup mix AND the soy sauce it was way too salty. I either use half the onion mix or leave out the soy sauce and it's perfect!

Did not go over well especially with the kids.  They just did not like the taste at all.  I thought they were okay but a little on the salty side.  Sorry.

Quite good.  We do not eat beef in our home, so these were a nice change in pace from chicken breasts!!  The onion soup mix adds good flavor.  I made some into burgers and some into small meatballs for the kids.  I have used both the super-lean and "regular" ground turkey and found that the super-lean had a "cleaner" flavor.

These were pretty good burgers.  Not dry or anything and not too salty tasting.  I don't think my husband would've been able to tell that it was turkey and not beef if I didn't tell him. I didn't give it five stars because it's not one of those "Oh my God, I love this" type recipe - but nothing bad about it.

These were fantastic.. followed the recipe exactly except I added panko breadcrumbs..I understand the onion soup mix is really high in sodium so  I might try a way to lower the sodium but boy, these were tasty!

Awesome turkey burgers! Great flavor and not at all dry, like turkey burgers can sometimes be.  I omitted the pepper, only because I'm not a big fan of it. I used 1 lb. of ground turkey instead of 1 1/2 lb. so I cut the onion soup mix quantity in half.  Also, onion soup mix tends to be salty so didn't want to over-do it.  I added a slice of colby-jack cheese the last minute or so and covered the pan to melt.  Love this recipe and will be making frequently!

These turkey burgers were amazing - flavorful, juicy, delicious!  I can't wait until winter is over so I can grill them.  I can only imagine how tasty they will be then.  :)  I forgot the egg, and they were still great.

YUM!  I had a 2.5 pound pack of ground turkey from Sam's club, and found this recipe.  I added 1 tsp of garlic powder, used lower sodium soy sauce, and added 1 Tbsp of worcestershire sauce.  I kept the amounts of everything else the same.  I used a old peanut butter lid lined with plastic wrap to press the burgers, and I came out with 10.  I grilled them, along with some other burgers for my husband.  He really liked these burgers, and said whatever I did 'different' he really liked!

Delicious and easy!  I used 99% fat free turkey, reduced sodium soy sauce (although they were still slightly salty) and one egg white to make it healthier.  Will definitely make these again!

These are amazing!  My husband is not a big turkey burger fan and he said these are his favorite burgers.  I didn't have onion soup mix so I used dried minced onions.  Usually when I do that I add salt and pepper but I skipped the salt since it calls for soy.  I also used low sodium soy.

Excellent taste, even vs. a beef burger!  I had 19 oz of lean ground turkey.  I used 1 pkg of regular onion soup mix, 1/2 tsp. white pepper instead of black, 1 lg. fresh garlic clove instead of the powder, 1 Tbsp of low sodium Teriyaki sauce instead of soy sauce, and the 1 egg.  Made 5 burgers.  My husband is a meat and potatoes man and he liked them too. Will be making them again for guests on Memorial Day weekend.

So good!  I followed the recipe ingredients exactly, except that I only had 1 pound of ground turkey on hand.  I mixed all the ingredients together, added the turkey and refrigerated it for 3 hours.  I cooked it over very low heat as others had suggested for an indoor grill pan, and covered it with tin foil after flipping the burgers to make sure they were cooked through.  I didn't find the burgers to be too salty at all, and everyone loved them!  I will make this again and again.

THESE WERE VERY GOOD!!  I made it exactly as directed.  They were VERY soft and gooey.  I was afraid they would fall though the grill.  But they grilled up beuatifully!   Even hubby loved them!

So Good!  I have been using Lipton Beefy Onion soup mix but I'm glad I tried the regular Onion mix. Tastes much better.  This recipe will be a regular this summer.

These were very good and were a good way to fix a quick meal.  They were a little salty, but the flavor of the soup mix made them a pleasant change from the ordinary burger.  Will make them again.

These were so-so.  I didn't care for the onion soup mix flavor and have had better turkey burgers.  I won't be making these again.

These are delicious!  I followed the recipe except I took other reviewers' advice and used Worschestire sauce.  I did add an egg but might experiment with just using an egg white next time.  Yes these are wet and sticky to handle when you mix it up but it all works out.  I cooked these on my Foreman grill and they took about 7-8 minutes.  Came out so yummy.    Thanks so much for a great recipe!  I will be making these all the time!

very good! I was surprised by the "too salty" comments. I didnt find it to be at all.I used 1.25 lbs of Turkey and omitted the egg. Tasted pretty good! I'll be making them again.

The flavor was really good, but it was too salty. I think if I only did 1/2 of the onion soup mix, it would be better.

Amazing!  Super flavourful!  Both my 2 year old and husband loved them!  I did find that the burgers seemed really wet when I first formed them, but once cooked, they are perfect (not like other dry turkey burgers I have tried).  Great recipe!

love these!! I never thought that I'd find a turkey buger that paralleled a beef one but these are delish! With the onion soup mix and the soy sauce they are a little salty so I might use a low sodium mix next time but all in all they were awesome.

I didn't enjoy the onion flavor to much in this burger, a bit overwhelming. I did add the egg, and wish I hadn't. The egg made it tough to handle on the grill.

This was our favorite turkey burger ever! Part of it is this recipe, but part of it is finding a new brand of ground turkey that we like better too, so I can't say it's all this recipe. But hey, with good quality ground turkey, this recipe makes great burgers! Thanks for the recipe, we'll use this one often!

Awsome!  I, as a general rule hate turkey burgers, but my whole family enjoyed them!  This is great for me too because my triglycerides and cholesterol levels are high.  Now I can enjoy a great burger with 1/3 of the guilt!

EXCELLENT recipe! Very flavorful and moist burgers. The ONLY thing I changed was after I made the patties I dusted them with flour and cooked them in a little olive oil (as another reviewer suggested) to hold them together. This is a keeper! Thank you for sharing.

Wonderful!  This was my first turkey burger attempt and they were enjoyed by all.  I used Beefy Onion soup mix and cooked them up on the grill pan on med-low heat.  Transfered them to a 350 oven covered in foil for about 15 min to finish them off.  They were tasty and easy to prepare.  I'm going to toss together another batch and freeze them for a quick dinner on crazy nights.  Thanks very much for the recipe!

Excellent, my picky husband and toddler enjoyed more than "regular" beef burgers.  Be sure to use full 1.5 lbs or may be too salty.  So moist that they dont need any cheese on top, just some fresh veggies,  delish!!!

These are awesome!  I have made them several times, and always to great reviews.  I actually like to double the recipe and make a bunch and freeze them.  They cook great from frozen, and are always flavourful.

Love this recipe ... however, instead of soy sauce I have been using Garlic Teriyaki sauce.  YUMMY!  My 6 YO asks for them for dinner ... that never happens!

This was a decent burger.  A little too salty/oniony for my liking, but good nonetheless. Also, I don't like it because all the onion soup mixes had MSG in it, and I don't like to eat MSG.

These turkey burgers were great!  I didn't change a thing, but used george forman grill instead of bbq grill.  They were great! Not too salty at all.

Little bit too salty, but I saw that other reviewers thought that as well so adjust accordingly based on their advice.  Flavor was good though!

I'm eating these as I type! Not bad, I liked the tip about cooking them on a lower heat that I got from other reviewers. I wouldn't say it's my new turkey recipe, but it was a good recipe to try. I used 2 lbs of turkey because I didn't want to waste 1/2 a lb.

These burgers are wonderful!!!  I used 99% lean ground turkey meat (which can be dry) but it was incredibly moist and saturated with flavor!  Even my husband enjoyed one.... or two!  THANK YOU!

I modified this using onion powder instead of soup mix, used diced cloves of garlic, and a cab/syrah red wine tossed into the mix.  Also used oregano as well.  Turned out great!

Delicious!  As mixture was way too wet, I added 1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs.  Served with lightly sauteed colored bell peppers, onions and garlic.  Froze the rest and looking forward to next time.

These tasted wonderful! A bit salty for my taste though since my family has blood pressure problems. I'm going to try this with fresh onion and garlic and low sodium soy sauce but stay with the bread crumb ratio and the egg. Thank you for a good basic recipe!

This is my go-to turkey burger recipe.  If preparing in the kitchen (and not the grill outside), I would use an indoor grill to brown/grill mark the turkey patties.  Place in a baking pan (covered in aluminum foil) and finish cooking in a 350 degree oven for 15 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes. You'll get the yummy grilled taste and moist cook-through turkey flavor. It's fail-proof.

I was skeptical about serving turkey burgers to my guys but these were a surprise hit.  Everyone really liked these and it was great to find something new.  They were flavourful and had a good burger texture.  Thanks for sharing this one!

Very Tasty and easy. 20mins seems too long for grilling these burgers though. 6-7 mins per side on medium/low heat was plenty. I used 2 lbs meat and 1pkg lipton beefy onin soup mix.

These were okay. If you want beefy tasting burgers, sure, these are good.  But they're plain. I prefer some of the other recipes for turkey burgers on this site.

Holy cow, what a burger!  These babies are even better then any ground beef burger I've ever had!  I used 2 lbs. of ground turkey, 3/4 of the package of onion soup mix, 1/4 cup of fresh minced onion and lightly coated the burgers in Italian breadcrumbs.  The result was a tasty burger that the entire family loved!  You won't be disappointed with this one...Can't wait to make them again this weekend!!!!

My husband as told he had to stop eating red meat. Neither one of us was thrilled about it. I found this recipe for turkey burgers. We cooked them on the grill. This is now our favorite burger!! We loved it! We invited a friend over and she asked for the recipe.

Loved these! So flavorful! I did omit the egg and these formed together nicely and grilled pefectly. I topped them with jack cheese, grilled onions, sliced tomatoes and served on whole wheat buns. One pound of lean ground turkey made 4 nice burgers. Thanks!

Generally good burgers, healthier with the lean ground turkey, and easy to make. One concern was the saltiness of the burgers. I made them for my family and we all agreed they were way too salty. I suggest just putting a bit less onion mix and less soy sauce because they obviously add alot of the saltiness. Otherwise, good recipe!

I thought these were great - so much better than the bland taste of gr. turkey! I used half the onion soup mix - added some chopped onion - extra garlic powder and 1/3 cup or so of oatmeal. I froze them with layers of wax paper between. Wonderful for a quick fix!!

I have to start out by saying I'm usually a red meat person.  I tried this recipe since my daughter has sworn off red meat.  I wasn't crazy about it. It was just ok.  I think the onion soup overpowered the flavor and it ended up tasting a little on the salty side.  I won't be using this recipe in the future.

Great, Great, Great, recipe. My family loved it. I am going to freeze the  leftovers and I look forward to eating them later this week! Only thing I changed is I used worchestershire sauce instead of soy sauce because that's what I had. Yummy!

This is my first time leaving a review, and felt it was my duty to do so on this one.  We use this recipe once a week, because we all love them so much.  We hardly eat reg. hamburgers anymore, and my girls 10 and 14 both love them as well.  Thanks for sharing.

Mine were falling apart so I added
seasoned bread crumbs and then
some parsley.  Delicious.

This is a staple in our house.  We like these better than regular beef burgers!  We have this at least once a week and just love it.  We didn't change a thing on the original recipe

I adore onion soup mix burgers and my husband hates them! (But, it had been a few years since I'd asked him to try them so I figured why not try one more time?)
My husband also despises turkey burgers! So I was utterly shocked that he loved this recipe .... loved it enough to request it a second time within 5 days! The burgers turned out juicy, with a great texture. Also, I have to admit that I was a bit worried about the saltiness due to soy sauce & onion soup mix and next time, I'll only add 3/4 of the soy & soup mix - it should be just the right amount of seasoning for us. Thanks for a great recipe that we can both enjoy!

I thought there was too much salt from the onion soup and soy sauce. Next time I'll try minced onions and leave out the sauce.

I made these for a father's day picnic and they were a HUGE hit!!  They were so flavorful and moist.  The key to cooking them is over LOW heat on the grill (as other reviewers have mentioned). I will never make my turkey burgers with bread crumbs again!!  Thanks for the great recipe.

These were so vicious!!  I took one bite and couldn't believe it was turkey. Not to mention they were very easy to cook. I will definately cook these again.

My husband and I loved this recipe for burgers!  They stayed very juicy when cooked on the grill, and the onion soup added a great flavor.  It is very salty, though.  The next time I make these, I am going to try using less or no soy sauce to cut down on the salt.  Overall, great recipe!  We had the Roasted Cajun Potatoes from this site with it- yummy meal!

i myself didn't like this at all, but my husband liked it ok.  it was very gooey when mixing it and almost like it had too much egg.  i had to add 1/2 c. bread crumbs to get it to stick together.  just didn't care for the flavor.

Very nice. I used our little George Foreman and cooked each batch for 6 minutes.  I got 6 medium and 2 small burgers out of the 1.5 lbs of meat. My husband was a bit skeptical about the whole turkey burger thing, I think, but he later said he liked them and would happily eat them again. And my two-year old ate hers all up and pronounced it, "lishhhhhh-us."

Hubby and I are on a low carb diet and I am trying to keep it fresh. These burgers were a nice change from regular beef and tasted great! Followed suggestions and only used 1/2 onion soup envelope. will definately make again. They are a little wet to handle when forming patties and I was worried about them coming apart but we grilled them and had no problems!

Excellent recipe.  I did, however, add 4 Tablespoons of juice from a jar of roasted red peppers, 1/4 cup bread crumbs and 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese to it.  They were a tad salty if you didn't heap on tomato and lettuce, so next time I'd skip the entire bag of onion soup mix.  But ~my oh my~ so good.  Even my son liked it and he's the pickiest person on the planet.  A decent cook goes almost completely to waste on my family.

A bit too much flavor. If I make it again I will try using 1/2 the packet of onion mix and 1/2 the garlic powder. ALso I only used 1 tbsp of soy sauce.

We loved this recipe!  Instead of using onion soup mix, I used a "chipotle pepper marinade" spice packet from McCormick.  I also added feta cheese and used crushed up triscuits as a substitute for breadcrumbs.  As one reviewer suggested, I cooked them on low heat to ensure they got done!  My husband and I both loved them-great flavor-didn't even need any condiments! Thanks!

I use ground turkey a lot - but generally only if it's half drowned in tomato sauce. I don't the guts to use it on its own, sure it will be dry and boring. This burger proves my fears wrong - it's moist and packed with flavor. I'd only suggest one change, cut the soy sauce to 1 T. so the flavor isn't overpowering. Thanks for a great turkey burger!

Wow, my first time making a turkey burger and I may never eat hamburger again. This was exceptionally good. As other reviewers did; I used low sodium soy sauce and halved it and used worchestshire sauce as well. Guestimated on the spices. I know for a fact I added more black pepper. Instead of BBQing, I just cooked it on the stove top. At the end added some muenster cheese as it was all that I had. Yummy!

This recipe was very delicious.  My family is a new comer to turkey burgers and are looking for fresh ideas with ground turkey.  I used worsteshire sauce instead of soy sauce (due to preference in taste) and they were absolutely fabulous.  In the future I will try liquid smoke flavoring and hickory smoke flavoring.  Thank you for such a versatile recipe!!!

Wow!  Loved them!  Did the soy and worchestershire sauce, half the onion soup mix and 1/2 cup or so of oatmeal with egg white.  I won't be buying frozen anymore...we had a mushy recipe before, so I got the guts to try again after reading the reviews.  Thanks!

We love this recipe at our house.  I don't put in the soy sauce because the onion soup makes them salty enough.  I also throw in a handful of oatmeal.  Nobody knows it's there and it makes them hold together well...and adds a bit of fiber.  Good eats!

I made turkey burgers once before and my husband just didn't like them. So this time he wasn't looking forward to eating them again.  I told him a good recipe will change his mind, and yours proved me right!! The only thing that I would change the next time is to cut back on the egg, or crush some crumbs into the mixture so that it won't be as wet.  This recipe is a keeper!

These weren't as tasty as I thought they would be. They certainly don't taste like a proper beef hamburger, but they're not bad. I probably won't make these again. (A nice hamburger dressing is low-cal Hellman's mayonnaise, prepared English Coleman's mustard, a little ketchup, and some finely chopped onion. Mix it all, and spread it on the bottom bun. It's yummy!)

This was an excellent recipe and easy to follow.  I have only made Turkey Burgers once before and when I made them using this recipe my husband asked me to cook somemore the next day.  The burgers were great although I did modify the amount of ingredients and I did use the egg and the burgers were great!  Also, if you use the Foreman grill the burgers are ready in half the time.  My husband likes his burgers well done so I cooked his for 8 minutes and I cooked mine for 6 to give it a medium taste.  I am giving this recipe 5 stars!!!!!

I've made turkey burgers twice based on this recipe.  The first time I added just the onion soup packet and soy sauce to 1 lb. of extra lean turkey and they seemed strange.  I just cleaned up leftovers from my second adventure and blended the same amount/type of turkey with only the onion soup packet this time and was delighted with the results!  One pound of turkey made four large burgers that were served on onion buns along with a baked bean dish!  Yum!  I'm giving this recipe four stars only because it has ingredients that I don't feel are necessary...

Great! The only thing I changed was to use 1 lb ground turkey breast and 1/2 lb ground bison. Instead of one whole egg I used 1/4 cup of Egg Beaters. I used reduced sodium soy sauce. Grilled over Kingsford briquets.  I grilled on bottom rack with lid open and after browning on both sides moved to the top shelf and closed lid. I didn't think they were salty at all.

I just made this recipe and it is fantastic! I used a package of beefy onion soup mix and I did add 3 tablespoons of plain Panko bread crumbs. it turns out I'm not sure if I even really needed them because killing them in the fridge for 10 minutes  made an incredible difference. They held together beautifully on my grill pan and are wonderful. This will be a new staple in my house, thanks for the recipe.

I made this with ground beef instead of turkey. The placed the patties in the freezer for a few minutes prior to grilling and they turned out perfect - very flavorful and moist.

Wonderful! I was afraid the burgers would fall apart, but if you let them sear on one side first they hold together quite well.
With a slice of onion and cheese to finish off the flip side, you would never know it wasn't beef.

These are good. My husband is not a fan of turkey burgers, but he said he would like these again. Not sure if the garlic powder is necessary given the onion soup mix is also in it. I also added Panko breadcrumbs, as I think it helps hold turkey burgers together better.

Turned out great. I had to improvise. I used some left over ranch powder, real garlic, some chicken seasoning, and onion powder. Also added the soy sauce as recommended and they were delish. Kids loved it. Also didn’t have burger buns so used the Pillsberry croissant and made into circular flat patty then popped in oven. Love love love.

These were great!   My husband wanted to prepare these, instead of purchasing frozen turkey burgers.    I was really proud of him, as he is usually only known for his grilling.    These were fixed exactly as directed, and everyone at our family dinner (3 generations) loved them!

I have made this recipe numerous times.  The only change I made was to use grated fresh garlic, 2 cloves  instead of  garlic powder.  This is a spectacular recipe,  burgers turn out very flavorful and very juicy.  I saute them for about 5 minutes a side. add a salad or hot vegigie and you have a terrific dinner or lunch.  I eat them without  the roll, just plain on the plate with a little Heinz spicy ketchup.  YUM, YUM,YUM

I used  2 pounds of ground turkey instead of 1 1/2 pounds and the seasoning was perfect . The whole family enjoyed the burgers. Great alternative since we are trying to eliminate beef from our diet.

Since the turkey is only sold in 16 oz (1 lb) package, I had to cut down on other ingredients (w/o egg). This formed 6 mini-size (sliders) burgers that everyone enjoyed. I used Worchester instead of soy sauce.

We loved them! My 8 y/o wanted cheeseburgers for dinner. 1/2 way through eating I asked what he thought. He loves them. (picky eater) That's when I told him I guess he likes turkey burgers now :-) This recipe is a keeper! Super easy to make and delicious.

I loved this, and so did my family. Because the mixture seemed soft, I added some Panko crumbs to hold it together a little better. Easy to make, with lots of flavor, I will be making this recipe again.

The extended family loved the burgers.  Only adjustments I made was to cut the soy sauce in half and used minced garlic instead of garlic powder. Next time I'll try organic soup mix instead.

I have 5 people to feed in  my family.  If I had not told them it was turkey, they would have never known the difference between this and 80/20 ground beef.  They were totally  shocked!  It tastes amazing!

Yum! This was tasty. I did make a couple of minor changes - I made this into a meatloaf and we ended up having meatloaf sandwiches with cheese and mayonnaise, and because it was a meatloaf I added some breadcrumbs to help combine it better. I also used low sodium soy sauce (which I do with most recipes). The turkey flavour really shone through, which I loved. Will be making again.

My girlfriend loved them, I hated them. 

They were easy to prep and cook. No problems with sticking or crumbling on the grill. 

I used fresh mince garlic and...I may have gone overboard. 

The biggest problem was getting blasted in the face with onion soup. Not my thing.

This has been a favorite of our family and friends for a long time.  We even had a guest once that couldn't believe they were turkey burgers.  He said if he had known it was a turkey burger before we gave it to him, he woulnd't have eaten it.  He loved it.

Definitely will make these again. I followed the recipe except I did not use onion soup mix because I forgot to buy it. Instead a used seasoned bread crumbs. I put the burgers on the grill & it was a hit with my family.

I followed this recipe exactly. It was perfect just like it is. It was NOT too salty at all. The best turkey patty I've ever eaten.

A good turkey burger, but kind of bland except for being on the salty side.  Used bbq sauce instead of soy to try and cut the saltiness.  Our package of turkey was only 1.2lbs, so added about a half cup of bread crumbs to stretch it a little and got 4 nice-sized patties.  Pan fried well, don't know that I would put these on the grill.

Recently I moved into an apartment and had to donate my grill so I wasn't sure how these burgers would do in a skillet.  To my surprise, they turned out fabulous and quite juicy...to keep them from burning on the outside before they cooked through I added some water to the pan after the juices had time to accumulate and then covered to keep the steam.  I always worry with ground turkey that I will undercook it, so I did try and check by cutting into the burger and then cooking them five minutes past when I thought they may be done.  Luck was on my side as they were cooked, yet still juicy!

These were the first turkey burgers I have ever made and I fell in love!  They were not salty at all.  I had mine with smoked gouda cheese and chipotle mayo.  Delish!

These are phenomenal! My husband requests these all the time. We don't have an outside grill, so we use his panini grill, and it works great! (And cuts down the cook time to about five minutes.) Will make again and again!

Awesome burgers. Even my 3 yr old daughter loved them. My only issue was they were a little sticky to handle & form into patties, but that's certainly no deal breaker for me. This is going to be put into regular rotation for the grill for us this summer!

Delicious. I made them just as the recipe says and they were great! My only words of wisdom are to not cut into the burger to make sure it is done, because then all the juice runs out. With all the seasoning, I could barely tell that I was eating a turkey burger and not a hamburger.

This is probably the best turkey burger I have ever had, and is right up there with the best burgers. I loved this burger, although my husband did not. I think it was the turkey, but you could easily switch it up with ground beef!

I used a dry onion mushroom soup mix, deleted the soy, added Worcestershire sauce, and added a sprinkle of bread crumbs. Also tried this as a "slider" on King Hawaiian wheat bread...The sliders were FANTASTIC!

Soooooo good! I made these for lunch today. I would add a little less soy sauce next time, but that is a personal preference. It was just a tad too salty, but it is still a 5 star. I will be making it again and again! Way better then beef burgers.

I love this recipe!  I made it exactly per the recipe the first time and found it salty.  I love the soy sauce (or Wostershire does well too) so to counter the excess salt, I sift out the larger pieces from the onion soup mix and use just a sprinkle of the salty seasoning.    Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

I have tried different recipes in the past, using ground turkey and have never come across a single one that I liked.  Thank you for reaffirming my faith in the bird!  These burgers were very tasty and my husband and son also liked them very much.  I will make them again.

These were delicious!  My picky hubby, 10 yr old and 21 mo. old actually liked them.  They requested them the following week. I mixed 3 lbs. & doubled everything and placed some in the freezer for a quick meal on another day.  The second time I made them, I forgot the egg, but nobody noticed.

Prepared just as written.  It wasn't WOW but good enough.  I made 4 patties and froze 2 of them for later so when I cook those I will maybe add cheese or something to kick it up a bit.  After that, I'll probably go back to my other recipe which has fresh chopped onion, cumin, worchestershire sauce and tops with salsa...

I changed it up a bit. I used BEEFY ONION soup mix. Added minced garlic and panko bread crumbs to the mix. Cooked it in a pan on the stove with EVOO. Wiped out pan, added burgers and then some Beef stock. Covered burgers with Cheddar cheese, and coverd pan with foil to let cheese melt. My picky son LOVED them!

Made these for dinner last night and we loved them.  I used egg beaters instead of an egg (to make it healthier) but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  Will certainly put this in with my favorite recipes.

Excellent recipe...I've never eaten a turkey burger before.  After looking at the reviews & seeing that people thought it was salty, I used 2 lbs per 1 pkt of onion soup.  I put garlic salt & pepper on the patties.  While it was very good this way, I needed to add a touch of salt on the patty after the first taste.  Lots of things you could add to this recipe - I'm a garlic freak so next time will add some fresh minced garlic to the turkey.

This was the most juicy and flavorful turkey burger I have ever had. I made them in the frying pan with a little bit of olive oil, they were great! Will make them again for sure!! My husband liked them a lot too and he's very picky.

Great taste and the person who stated to salty, must have used store brand onion soup. They make them with lots of salt.

LOVED IT!  SO EASY TO MAKE AND TASTED PERFECT.  I DON'T LIKE THINGS REAL SALTY, SO I WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS WHEN SOME REVIEWERS SAID IT WAS TOO SALTY.  IT WASN'T TOO SALTY AT ALL.  WE WILL BE HAVING THESE A LOT.

These were awesome.  I used about 2 ½ lbs of turkey, & the flavor was perfect.  I had one w/ lettuce & tomato because I didn’t have an onion, but I liked them & realized you don’t need onion because they are so flavorful.   I also had 1 w/ just cheese that my 4 y.o. son didn’t finish, & that was also good.  My husband & I could not stop talking about how good these were.  We can’t wait to eat them again.

great recipe as is, but second time I omitted onion soup mix and instead added finely diced red onions and finely diced green chiles (found in small can in taco section of grocery store). Also try to make 2 patties really thin & in between them "stuff" some shredded cheese (Colby Jack or Swiss..)then pinch the top & bottom patties together to seal...the smell of this burger cooking on your grill will make you a very popular neighbor:)

Good way to add flavor to boring turkey - next time I will add a ittle less soup mix; it was a little too salty (but still good!)  Burgers were very moist!

Very tasty - a great low fat burger option.  I didn't have an egg on hand, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The burgers were moist without being greasy and had lots of flavor.  I served with swiss cheese slices and a dollop of homemade cranberry sauce. yum!

My 25yr old son called these phenomenol. He says they're better than hamburgers. My grandson also liked them and he's a little bit harder to impress. Guess that about says it all.

Yum!  My husband and I both love these turkey burgers. I've found that for two people changing the servings to 4 works perfectly for 1 lb. of ground turkey. I generally freeze one or two patties to have for next time!

I used 2 lbs of already seasoned jennie-o turkey burger patties (they were on sale this week, thus saving me about 3 dollars), smooshed them all together with the ingredients (less the garlic powder since they had some in them when purchased), and a bit of Worcestershire, refrigerated, and made 8 patties.   Everyone thought they were amazing. Dare I say that I liked these more than beef?!

These are REALLY GOOD!  I admit I only put in half of the onion soup mix because they seemed a little salty the first time I made them.  Other than that, this recipe is awesome!  We eat these every week.  Thanks!

These were great.  I only had 1 pound of turkey so I scaled the spices down.  Cut back a bit on the onion soup mix as I try to take it easy with salt.  I thought that the mixture was a bit wet so I added some crushed crackers.  In the end they were fantastic and have had a request to make them instead of hamburgers in the future.  Very flavourful.  Thanks for posting this recipe.

We dont usually make turkey burgers, but these will definately be added to the rotation.  My 12 year old ate his in about 2 minutes.  I didnt do anything different to the recipe, added some chipotle cheddar cheese and feta as a topping, these were great.

Delicious.  I've used this recipe as a basic idea each time I make turkey burgers.  I don't use soy sauce or egg.  I think I tried BBQ sauce one time as well.

This is the best turkey burger EVER. I only used 1 lb of turkey breast and added some bread crumbs to the mixture. I topped it off with oven fried bacon, grilled onions, avacado and pepperjack cheese. OH MY LORD! Delicious! I had my friends fighting over the last morsals and they were so full they could barely get it down!

Easy, quick and tasty - I didn't have garlic powder, so used an equivalent amount of garlic salt, and based on other reviews I only used 3/4 of the onion soup mix. Will definitely make again, possibly with a bit of the onion soup mix combined with sour cream to make a spread to top them off. Oh, I also used Worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce.

Very good. Probably a little to onion-ie for my likely. But, overall very good. I did use the extra lean ground turkey and it was a little dry. However, I suspect if you use just lean turkey and cook at a lower heat you wouldn't have this problem.

Very tasty burgers. I added sharp cheddar cheese, dill pickle slices and a toasted but. No other condiments were needed, the flavor was all in the patties.

These were "eh". Followed the recipe, tasted like onion soup burgers- not necessarily a good thing. They were juicy though, which I think came from the egg. I'll look elsewhere for a turkey burger recipe next time.

These were very tastly burgers.  My husband (whose usual rating is a 3... or a 3.5 if he really likes it...) said "These are closing in on a 4!"  I added the egg and it was too soupy, so I dumped in the left-over cornflake crumbs I had (was out of bread crumbs).  They held together better than any turkey burger I've ever cooked (I did these on a stove-top cast iron grill).  Loved the taste.  Will definitely make again, and may try substituting the soy sauce for the Worcestershire (which I usually love on my burgers).

These were OK, but I was disappointed after reading the other reviews.  I'll definitely try them again, but probably won't use the extra-lean turkey meat...the burgers were dry.  I'll also add a little more of each of the seasonings - we like everything to have a little zip!

Wow! I never thought turkey burgers could be so good! I used 2 lbs of 93/7 (lean) turkey and Knorr's onion soup mix (which was 1.5 ounces), 2 eggs, 3 T. low salt soy,  1 t. powdered garlic, 1 t. black pepper and a small amount (1/4 cup)of seasoned bread crumbs - since the mixture was a little too moist. I cooked them on a griddle sprayed with pam on the stove top. I'm so happy to have a new recipe - my family refuses to eat grilled chicken any more!

Great flavor, and much healthier then beef! I've been hesitant about subsituting turkey for beef, but these turned out so tasty! My husband says he'll trade these in for beef burgers anytime!

I was surprised by this recipe.  The burgers turned out so well.  I did use the Golden Onion Soup Mix, because that's what I had on hand.  I don't know if that made much of a difference, but I don't want to try anything else since these were so yummy!  I was worried they would taste just like soup mix, but they really didn't, they just had a great flavor.  I loved these!

I wasn't sure how good a turkey burger would be, but we liked this recipe. They held together well and tasted good with whole wheat buns. I also liked how I had all the ingredients on hand. Will  make again.

We thought they were very good.  We didn't feel like it was quite a 5 star but I'll definitely be making them again. I'm also betting the same recipe would be great using beef.  I followed the recipe exactly. I did forget to brush the grill before hand but there really wasn't that much sticking.  The best turkey burger I've had so far!

My family loves these! I omit the egg due to a food allergy in my family, and we really don't miss it. The burgers still stay together well. I have been adding some chopped fresh basil from my herb garden, and that adds a nice color and flavor to the burgers. Very moist and delicious, and also very easy!

I am not a vegetarian but, don't eat hamburger meat and just started eating turkey burgers. This recipe is FANTASTIC!!!! I would give it more stars if I could.  My husband and I both loved it.  I just put it on the George Foreman Grill for 5 or 6 minutes and that was it. I made it was Poor Man's Fried Rice (also on this site and worth it). It's going to be a staple in our house.  Thanks so much for the post.

This is a great recipe.  I added 1/2 Tsp of Chili Powder and some Jalepeno peppers to make it spicy.  They went fast.

Awesome... My husband and I have been watching our calorie intake and were looking for a good turkey burger recipe, WOW what I found was better than I could have expected.  I read all the reviews and made some changes.  I used 1 1/2 pounds gruoind turkey, I used only 3/4  of the packet of onion soup mix, black pepper, garlic powder, I left out the soy sauce and I used half of the beaten egg.  I also put in a little bit of bread crumbs to hold them together.  I cooked them on the George Foreman for about 10 mins.  They turned out great!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Usually the turkey burgers I make turn out bland and a bit dry, but these were moist and very flavorful. Because I opted to put in the egg, I also added about a 1/3 cup of oatmeal so they were less sticky and easier to mold. I think this really helped and made for a fantastic burger. I topped them with some mayo, tomato and lettuce on a lightly toasted bun and... mmmmmm.

Liked this recipe, however the addition of the lightly beaten egg made the mixture very gooey, as other readers have also stated.  I don't even think the egg is needed as the mixture appeared an appropriate consistency for burgers before I even added the egg.  I was still able to form patties and they seemed to cook fine on the grill.  My husband really liked them!

We really enjoyed the full flavor of this recipe. The only change I made was to cook it as a meatloaf in 9-inch pan at 350 degrees for 45 minutes. Thanks for a keeper!

These burgers were pretty tasty. My family ate them all, but I didn't get the rave reviews I was hoping for. I think the onion soup mix slightly overpowers the flavor of the main ingredient; the turkey. Other than that, these were easy to throw together on a busy weeknight. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good recipe, although a tad salty. I would recommend either using only half the package of onion soup mix or omitting the soy sauce completely. Very moist and overall good. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was really good.  The whole family loved the flavor of the burgers.  The only thing I didn't like about them is they are real pain in the butt to form into patties.  Maybe it's just the way I was doing it, but the meat is really sticky and kind of gooey, which made it difficult to work with as opposed to ground beef.  But that's just me nitpicking.  :)

Fiance and I are trying to watch what we eat before the big day and since he's is not too keen on turkey meat I thought I'd try this.  I didn't change a thing, other than use low sodium soy sauce and it was so tasty.  Definitely added to my recipe collection.  Thanks

These burgers went over well with the entire family.  My husband does not eat red meat, so we do turkey instead of beef.
They were a hit and so tasty!!

These were juicy for a turkey burger.  I had to add bread crumbs b/c the mixture was too mushy to form into patties.  The onion flavor may be a bit overpowering for some.  Next time I will take out some of the onion mix b/c it was on the salty side.  Then again i was shy of 1 1/2 lbs.  I just had one for lunch, and took it right out of the freezer and put it in the pan!  I cooked in on the stovetop (electric) at heat 4 for about 7-8 minutes each side with a little bit of veg. oil in the pan.

Absolutely FUN in our mouth! My husband was so surprised that he actually enjoyed it, he felt for sure he would not like it because it wasn't ground beef-ha! This was so good-I dipped the patties in panko crumbs and then spritzed them with EVOO, and cooked them on my George Forman grill-stuffed them in a warm pita filled w/ lettuce, red onion, feta, and dijon, really moist!
served with a pot of fresh asparagus soup, what an excellent idea-thanks!

I used bison rather than turkey (it's still low in fat, plus it's what I had on hand). My boyfriend absolutely loved these, and I just thought they were ok. They smelled great!

Great for a turkey burger. They are defiantly not real burgers:) They are a little heavy on the onion soup mix.

very good, you can add some variation and more spice by throwing in a few teaspoons of ginger as well as a tablespoon or so of minced garlic

Instead of onion powder, I diced up a fresh onion, and I also shredded some smoked gouda into the mix. Overall it came out fantastic.

Not my favorite.  I thought it tasted a lot like the insides of asain potstickers.  That is not the flavor I was expecting.

It was moist, but my family and I didn't like the onion soup mix taste as much. It was too much.  Just adding beef boullion and worceshire sauce would have been better.

I loved this!! A great substitution for a normal burger. My husband didn't like it though, he's very picky. The only thing I might change is to use a little bit less onion soup mix. That flavor was a little over powering. I still love it though!

What a great twist to a popular favorite! I did not change a thing. I did cook them stove top on medium. We used whole wheat buns and low fat swiss and topped with roasted onions that were roasting with sweet potato french fries. So good!

With every bite, my husband said, these are great.   Tried this recipe with a little less onion soup (as my brand is too salty), used egg whites and it was amazing and super simple.  I typically go for the fresh basil, parsley, bread crumbs, soya sauce yet this was great.  Thanks

These were really quite good. All my family liked them, which is unusual (5 picky kids!) I made them exactly per recipe, but did not make burgers out of them;instead I used them for meatballs. Will def make again - thanks for the recipe!

These are really AWESOME burgers. I used Worcestershire Sauce as another reviewer had suggested and they came out super yummy. We did use only a pound of meat instead of the half a pound as suggested. This is our second time to make this recipe and it will be a keeper as far as our family is concerned.

Quick and easy version.  I made mine with ground turkey breast, which is a little drier.  I put the soup mix, soy, egg, spices into my mini-chopper first.  Ground it up, then added some fresh parsley from my garden for color, and gave it a quick pulse. Finally I mixed it all into the turkey and let it sit for a half hour.  Very tastey.

Actually 4 1/2. Pretty tasty! I was going to add some oats, like others, but forgot. I didn't add the egg, but stuck to the rest of the recipe. Not too salty, IMO! Definitely use a little lower temp. I used a non-stick grill with a lid to keep moisture in, as turkey breast tends to be a bit dry. My only gripe is that I have to mix it with my hands- yuck! (wouldn't mix well otherwise) Thanks!

very good recipe! have tried other turkey burger recipes, but this is by far the best. like other reviewers, used worchestershire instead of soy and also threw in some oatmeal to help bind it. I used only the egg white. Very flavorful and the burgers stayed together instead of falling apart (which happens with a lot of other recipes).

The mix is absolutely liquidy...it needed something to hold it together.  The recipe states to cook for 20 minutes, however, my burgers started burning after just 8 minutes.  Even with the seasonings, it still isn't very good tasting.  Skip this recipe!

This was our first time using ground turkey.  We are trying to eat more healthy foods and the ground turkey was on sale $2.49/lb, so we bought 10 pounds.  It wasn't what I was expecting, however if was very good.  I made a double batch and the leftovers are gone, so the family enjoyed them.  I do think I will try a few other recipes though for something with a little more zip.

My husband and I both LOVED these turkey burgers. We have been trying to eat healthier and we both like turkey burgers but agreed that they need a little "kick". We used the 99% fat free turkey burger and instead of the soy sauce we used 2 tablespoons of A-1 steak sauce. YUMMIE!!

GREAT TASTE. Made them as written minus the soy sauce.  This is a good recipe for people to try who don't like turkey burgers. The soup mix really helps to disguise the flavor. Will be making these often.

This was my very first time making turkey burgers and I have to say they were absolutely great!!! My husband enjoyed them VERY much. I read the other reviews and decided to use only a 1/2 teaspoon of the soy sauce and crumbled a slice of wheat bread in my mixure and it wasn't salty at all...PERFECT. I will be eating turkey burgers forever...THANKS

This recipe was quick,easy and very tasty. I did not add the soy sauce and it was still very delicious. My family loved them. Of course I had to add cheese to the top of the kids burgers which made them taste even better. Thanks for sharing!
