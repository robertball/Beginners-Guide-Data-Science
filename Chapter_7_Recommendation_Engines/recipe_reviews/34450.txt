No need for the food processor. I put this mix into an empty aldi spice jar / grinder that used to have their herbs d'provence mix in it. This way, the mix is fresh ground whenever I need it.

Great recipe! I love when you can mix up seasonings vs. buying them. I put this into my mini food processor and let it go. I left out the red pepper flakes because I always add that to taste in my recipes. Just store in a little tupperware container for future use!

I had no Italian seasoning, so tried this. I had everything but savory and red pepper flakes, and used it in a recipe tonight. It was great!

Cilantro is not an Italian seasoning. I wouldn't put it in because it's really strong. I don't think it would go well with the other herbs.

This is a nice easy seasoning mix to have on hand.  Cheap to make and easy to store (in a tiny rubbermaid container).  I had everything in my cupboard except savory and red pepper.  Used this in lasagna and it worked great.

Since I normally have all the other herbs anyway and can't use them up on their own this works out much better, tastes better then the store bought mix! Also you can add more of your favorite herbs if you want to. Cheers!

I cut it down to once serving. I wanted to test out the flavours of this before making a bigger batch as I've never seen red pepper flakes (or chili flakes, as they're called here) in an Italian seasoning before. Only substitutions made were parsley and sage in place of the cilantro and savoury. It was a nice addition in my burgers had I used more than that recipe called for. No more store-bought for me!

This was quick and easy to make.  The only thing I didn't care for was the amount of red pepper in it.  I cut it in half but it was still too much.  I use it a lot in my omlets to flavor the eggs and the pepper was too strong.  This would probably be fine in a more Italian type dish.

This is a fabulous all-purpose seasoning that we love to take camping. It's great on campfire potatoes, grilled char, and omelets, to name a few!

This seasoning was easy to make and a lifesaving recipe bc it saved a trip to the store! Everything we needed was already in our spice cabinet, and my 3 year old loved counting out the scoops and pouring them in the container by herself! a memorable cooking moment for her. thanks!

I used dried coriander which I googled and found out is dried cilantro. This worked for what I needed today as I went to my spice cabinet and freaked out when I noticed I was out of italian seasoning.

This recipe make a lot so I cut it down by half.  Very easy to put together.  I use this to make my homemade salad dressings and also in my homemade sauces.  It's great sprinkled over chicken and fish.  It's great when I can control the sodium content!

This is very tasty and has a great kick to it.  I put it all together and store.  Then you can grind at the time you need to use it and the flavors are fresh.

Although I love spicy/hot foods, the red pepper is overpowering. Next time, I'll only use 1 tbsp.

This is exactly what I was looking for.  I left out the cilantro because it really doesn't go with Italian food.  I also left out the red pepper because I would rather add it according to our taste.

Used it on pan grilled thick cut pork chops finished in oven. My wife comments were outstanding flavor. Also added kosher salt and black pepper too. First I salt and pepper and applied liberal Italian seasoning. Spritzed with a little olive oil.
Chops were very moist and flavorful. I usually do not write comments but this seasoning is great. Can't wait to try on other proteins and grilled corn.

My husband makes great spaghetti sauce using store-bought Italian seasoning.  He was feeling adventurous, so I tried making the seasoning using this recipe.  The flavor was nice, but I'm sure it would have been better had the herbs been fresher (and therefore more flavorful).  We liked the heat from the chile flakes.  Unfortunately I live in an area where not all the spices I'm used to using can be found, so the only savory I could find was ground.  I have given my rating based on how the recipe would have turned out had I had better ingredients.  This one is definitely worth keeping!

Very easy and good.  Used in a recipe that called for italian seasoning and it worked fine.  Next time, though, not gonna use the food processor.  I'll use my grinder or something.  The ground pepper was killing me!

My balsamic chicken recipe called for Italian seasoning but I didn’t have any such spice in my giant collection of spices. I searched on Allrecipes and found I could make it. I had everything except savory so looked up what could be substituted and learned you can use marjoram, thyme or sage. Since this mix already called for marjoram and thyme, I used sage. My chicken turned out delicious so I think this must be a good mix.

Good recipe. However I too would prefer to add the crushed red pepper on a recipe by recipe basis.  Other than that, great mix of spices.

GREAT! MY NEW FAVORITE!
It has a great balanced taste. I used it on a roast too and it was great.
I swapped smoked paprika for the hot pepper.

Good, but red pepper  flakes aren't normally in Italian seasoning, and they really give  this a kick (unwanted). Also, cilantro? In Italian seasoning? I left that out. Otherwise, good guidance in this recipe.

I altered the recipe a  bit as I needed an Italian seasoning mix for pizza sauce. I like that this recipe has equal amounts of each seasoning so it was easy to adjust down to the amount I needed for another recipe rather than having a big batch! 

I used equal parts basil, oregano, thyme, savory, and red pepper flakes, and it made the pizza sauce so delicious. I would add back in the other ingredients based on what I have available in my spice drawer and the italian based recipe that I'm making. Thanks for the good combo!

I liked just as written. Having it on hand already mixed just makes my cooking time simpler and I am glad it was submitted. Keeper. Thanks

LOVE IT! Will never buy Italian seasoning again. This is perfect! I add in 1 tsp of garlic.

I tried this because it seemed easy and I needed it fast. It was worked great! I will keep this in my cabinet full time instead of buying it.  Thanks!

Very good. I do not eat rosemary, so left that out. But,  I did not put in any red pepper flakes, as I was just looking for regular Italian season, not something with extra heat. And, also agree w/ the other reviewer that cilantro is not really a flavor I want in my Italian seasoning, so left that out, as well. But, with these changes, it did what I wanted; it was a good base to start, so thanks.

Absolutely perfect!  If I could give it more than five stars, I would.  I use this for every Italian dish I make.  It has even become the secret ingredient in my homemade pasta sauce.

this was great in Spaghetti Squash Primavera (on this site).. i subbed dried parsley for the cilantro (feels more italian to me), cut down a lot on the thyme as i only have ground thyme, and halved the red pepper flakes.. i plan on using this from now on instead of buying the premixed stuff at the store as it's a lot more flavorful and punchy.. ty for the recipe

Good basic seasoning blend.  I didn't use savory (didn't have it) and cilantro (didn't want that in an italian blend.  i used 1 tsp of each because i didn't want such a large amount.  Since they're all the same amounts it's easy to modify.

I usually keep a packet of Italian dressing mix on hand, but OOPS!! This worked out great...I didnt have cilantro or savory, so made due without. (I did add worchestire sauce to the recipe to boost the flavor--thinking it might make up for lack of savory.)  Also, I cut the amount of red pepper flakes in half, just because I prefer a little less "kick."

Thank you! Forgot to buy it and looked this up. Worked out great and now I can even adjust to how we like. Never buying it again.
