I used fresh mushrooms in this recipe that I sauteed with the onion, red bell pepper and a little fresh minced garlic before adding it to the other ingredients. I did add a little Frank's Hot Sauce to the casserole when I added in the spices. Everyone loved this baked egg omelette, especially me. I made a whole Brinner night and this went GREAT with home fries. I think I would cut the cheese in half next time, I think I could get away with that.

I am getting ready to make this for the second time.  This is really yummy.  The only issue that I had was with the flour.  If you add it as the recipe states it will be lumpy.  I did and then had to try to remove the lumps and some of the liquid and shook it all up in a jar.  No lumps.  Also used fresh mushrooms and added pepper jack cheese.  Leftovers can be reheated for a very quick breakfast.  Thanks for posting

Excellent and easy!  BUT I recommend you change the order of the layers.  The cheese on the bottom burned.  ( this made it very difficult to clean the baking dish, too.). Next time I will butter the bottom of the baking dish.  the best way to layer is to first place the veggies on the bottom.  Then the Canadian bacon.  Then the layer of cheese.  Top it off with egg mixture.  Thank you for the easy and delicious recipe.

Everyone in our family loved this, including the mushroom haters.  The only things I changed were to chop fresh mushrooms instead of using jarred ones, use fresh basil instead of dried, and to switch the order of ingredients in the egg mixture.  I didn't want lumpy batter, so I mixed the dry ingredients, slowly whisked in the milk, then beat in the eggs.

This is delicious! Just made it for Mother's Day brunch and everyone loved it. I only made one change. I substituted 1/4 c corn starch for the flour to make it gluten free. I combined it with the milk before adding to the eggs. Turned out perfectly!

REALLY FABULOUS! I have a thing about cheese...it should be optional in all things in my opinion and so my little family has had to learn to just add some to whatever they want. so...I didn't add any cheese. also I didn't sautee the veggies first, I just chopped up fresh mushrooms, green onions, green peppers and deli turkey. I whipped up the egg part, poured it in the pan threw the vegetables and turkey over the top, added some ground pepper and baked it. REALLY FABULOUS! it was just one of those nights where I seem to get everything backwards but fortunately this egg bake with some toast and a glass of milk made a really, really REALLY FABULOUS dinner!

Changes I made:  Sauteed the veggie mix in olive oil instead and added a little red onion, green pepper, fresh sliced mushroom, and a package of thawed, drained frozen spinach.  Also used fresh basil.  The ham added enough salt - next time I would not add extra salt.  Did everything the night before and put it in the fridge and baked it just a little longer the next morning (about 50-55 minutes) since it was cold.  I think I will also reduce the bottom layer of cheese next time, too.  Other than being a little salty, though, it was WONDERFUL and loaded with good flavor!

This was delicious! My husband doesn't like breakfast casseroles but he loved this one!  I also used fresh mushrooms & added spinach. I layered the veggies, then the ham, then 3/4 cheese, then eggs, then rest of cheese. This is a keeper!

This recipe is awesome! So easy! We make two of these on Sundays. One  the kids make with their choices and one for me with things I like. Cut them into individual servings and we use them for breakfast on the go during the week. Just pop them in the microwave and you're off and running!!!!!

This is my favorite egg bake recipe. I make several variations....including using hashbrowns on the bottom, or layering with spinach ;) I found it much easier to mix my flour in the milk before adding to the eggs...no lumps!

Nothing special going on here. Very heavy and has that boring every casserole flavor. I found this to be rather bland and in need of some other seasonings to make it stand out. 

Too much cheese. There are much better and more flavorful egg casseroles out there.

Very good!  You could do so many things with this breakfast bake. I just like the fact that it's not a bread base - all eggs and veggies and cheese.  Yum!  Oh, and I made it the night before and it turned out totally fine when I baked it in the morning.  I was a little worried since there was no bread how that would turn out but it was great.

Absolutely delicious. I just made it without the veggies and added crumbled bacon. I also used cake flour(1/2c+1t) in place of the regular flour and it seems to worked just fine.

This is a really great breakfast casserole.  It was perfect for dinner last night (with pecan praline French toast on the side!).  I left out the bell pepper and basil because I had forgotten both at the grocery store and was NOT going back for them! :) Everyone in my family loved the recipe without those ingredients, so I don't think I'll add them when I make this again.  The eggs were light and fluffy, yet you didn't have to eat much to feel full.  The mushrooms and green onion kicked up the flavor in this dish ten-fold!  I had an issue with the flour clumping in the egg/milk mixture.  I put half of the ingredients in a blender bottle, shook it a few times, and that did the trick.  I will definitely be making this dish again soon - for a non-traditional tailgating party in two weeks.  GO HOGS!

Loved this, made it for Christmas brunch.  Made just as instructed, except used fresh mushrooms. I put it together the night before, refrigerated and baked in the morning.  It took MUCH longer than 35-40 min, possibly twice that amount of time. This might have been becausew it was refrigerated?  I ended up cranking up the heat to 400 and it finally set up in the middle.  It was worth the wait though! Excellent.

Made this a few weeks ago for a church brunch and it received rave reviews. I used deli ham that I had them slice very thick. Once veggies were sautéed I quickly cooked ham just a few minutes. All came out great.

Great alternative to reduce bread/carbs in an egg casserole.
Make this 3-4 times already, used fresh mushrooms, no parsley, substituted the mozzarella with Monterey jack cheese which I think was much better tasting.  Also added chives - tasted like an egg pizza with no bread crust.  Family LOVED it!

I used this recipe as a jumping off point. I didn't have alot of the ingredients so I improvised.  The only veggies I cooked was green onion and spinach.  Then I made a layer of spinach on top of the green onion/spinach mix. I cooked bacon in the oven and cut it up and then I placed on top of spinach. In my eggs(12) I used parsley, Garlic and herb seasoning, parsley and pepper. Just a little bit of sea salt since the bacon is salty enough. It was wonderful!!!!!! I will definitely use this recipe again. Thanks Erin

I will absolutely make this again and again! I make a double batch so I can use leftovers for  a quick breakfast.  I love this recipe!! I do use fresh mushrooms, not canned.  Just a quick note, if you're a "low carber", omit the flour and use about  1/2 cup of cream not milk.  I have made it this way and it still binds together.

This was delicious.  I followed the advice of the other commentators.  I halved the cheese (I used fresh grated gruyère.) and I used fresh mushrooms.  I also put the cheese on top of the sautéed vegetables. I used bacon with the fat trimmed off and sautéed ahead of time instead of ham and I used chopped dill instead of basil and parsley as that was what I had in the fridge.  I could have used less cheese and it still would have been great.

I made this ahead of time, froze it in individual portions and took it camping. The night b4 I'd take it out of the freezer then microwave it next morning and even put it on a bun with cheese for a breakfast sandwich...yum

Home run for a holiday family brunch. Used gluten free flour (Pamela's) & soy milk - no problem at all. Realized after we'd all dug in that I'd forgotten the ham!! Excellent without it, and it pleased the vegetarians, too.

Very tasty and easy.  I did make a few changes.  Directions don't say to spray or butter the pan which is a must or you will have sticking and burning. I put the ham down first,  then part of the cheese, then layered everything else ending with cheese.   Added a handful of baby spinach to the veggies while they sauteed, and used red onion, so it was colorful.  Definitely will make again, it's lighter than quiche so with a fresh fruit cup and muffin or mini-danish would be  lovely for a company brunch.

I  made this to take on a 3 day ski holiday to serve 9 people.  Baked it before we left and warmed it in the oven.  Delicious I made again for Christmas morning brunch.  I didn't have enough ham so I cooked a pound of bacon, crumbled it up and added.  Delicious!

Just made this yesterday for Easter brunch and it was excellent!  Everyone loved it.  I would recommend cooking it a little longer than it suggests to make sure it isn't runny. Very nice blend of flavors and also very easy.  The fresh parsley gives it a real zing.  I'll make it again!

I give it 5 stars for versatility, which you can see by reading everyone's comments.  I adjusted the recipe by omitting all veggies to save time and money and doing a pound of sausage instead of ham.  I also used a gluten free flour (brown rice flour) so my son can eat it.  You can also switch up the seasonings.  This time I did a chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper blend just eye balling it.  I'm usually a heavy- handed seasoner. This is the second time making it for a baby shower!

I followed the suggestion of using half of the cheese amount - I substituted the bell peppers with frozen spinach, used fresh mushrooms and substituted the ham with breakfast sausage and it was a HIT! People thought I ordered this dish at a restaurant!

I like adding 1/2 cup pecorino Romano cheese, and 1/2 cup spinach, or broccoli to the vegetables. One last thing, I omit the mozzarella cheese, and add shredded Swiss, and 1/4 cup blue cheese crumbles, along with bacon bits. Now  it will rate a 10 star rating

Excellent -  it was a hit with my brunch guests! I made it without ham and served smoked salmon on the side. You can easily vary the amount of vegetables added. I used fresh mushrooms and would recommend this.

This is the best egg bake recipe that I have ever tried.  I use more of everything in it than the recipe calls for and I use Jimmy Deans sausage instead of ham.  No bread and very light.  My whole family loves it!

This is a really delicious and easy recipe to make. Putting spinach on the bottom layer insures that the egg dish will not stick to the bottom. I had to increase the cooking time to insure that the dish was cooked through.

For a variety use Jimmy Dean Sausage instead of the ham.

We have made this egg bake for several years.  I increased the onion to 1/2 cup and I used 10 eggs while reducing the diced ham to 1 cup. This is a recipe that my husband absolutely loves!  It freezes beautifully.

This is a tasty simple casserole that is well liked.  I substituted two cups of bacon for the ham (personal preference), and cut back a bit on the cheese. I made most of it the night before, so it was cold going into the oven and took 50 minutes to cook. I will definitely make it again,

This was delicious! I thought it would be weird with the herbs in it but not at all! I forgot the flour so it came out a little watery, but that's okay.  I sautéed all the veggies and used fresh mushrooms. I also took the advice of other reviewers and put the veggies on the bottom, then the ham, and then the cheese.  I might try this with hash browns on the bottom next.

I followed the advice of others, substituting fresh mushrooms for canned, adding chopped fresh spinach, decreasing the cheese to 1 1/2 cups each cheddar and mozzarella, spraying the pan, and layering with sauteed veggies first,  followed by the ham, then cheese, then egg mixture.  I didn't have fresh herbs on hand, so I substitued 1 tbsp. dry parsley for the fresh.  Delicious!

Excellent!  Ranking it 4 stars because it didn't seem to get done in the time specified -- I had to bake it another 15 minutes and almost ran short of time as I was bringing it to a brunch. I substituted fresh mushrooms vs. jared and used sharp cheddar cheese and I got so many good reviews! I will make again!

This is an excellent recipe for novice cooks or those who want something easy to make with kids. Leftovers reheat very well for  quick workday breakfasts. If you can crack eggs and avoid  pieces of egg shell, chop vegetables without cutting yourself, and grate cheese or tear open a package, you can succeed at this recipe every time. It's a great base as is but lends itself to personal creativity. Use the best ingredients you can, follow the directions, and pay attention while it's in the oven (no falling asleep on the couch or losing track of time while checking Facebook), and you'll soon be a culinary genius who will amaze your friends and family.

I wanted a breakfast casserole without using bread and this turned out to be the perfect solution! I used the ingredients I had on hand... so I used red and yellow peppers I had frozen from our garden and cooked them in the microwave, I left out the mushrooms, added a bit of garlic powder to the recommended spices. Also, I used shredded Swiss cheese as I didn't have mozzarella on hand with extra sharp cheddar cheese. My family LOVED it! I will definitely be making this one again!  Thank you!

Very tasty! First time made it exactly by the recipe. Second time made with ham. The sausage version was much better tasting. So if using ham add more of something to give it more flavor.

Why would anyone use mushrooms in a jar for anything instead of using fresh ones!?!  No wonder we have mushroom haters out there.  For that reason, I am giving this a 3 star rating.  Also the cheese could be scaled back somewhat.

This was a hit at a bridal shower brunch. I actually made two, one with meat and the other was vegetarian. For the meatless one, I added diced cooked sweet potatoes, along with diced zucchini and sweet red bell peppers. It was delicious!! This recipe is definitely a keeper!!

An amazing recipe! A quiche without the calories of a crust.  I used half cheddar and half swiss because that's what I had on hand.  The ONLY change I would make is to use PAM on the pan before adding ingredients,  Thanks for a new, easy favorite.

Absolutely fantastic recipe, from the original to a few variations I tried. Instant favorite everywhere I brought it to share. One thing I changed right away - I did not (and still don't) add any salt, as the ham is salty enough. A few things I tried, as a variation - I added a handful of cooked bacon on top of the cooked veggie mixture, and it was great addition. Another time I tossed the ham in the frying veggies and it turned out great as well, another time I used fresh mushrooms, and yet another time I eliminated mushrooms completely, adding the weight equivalent in red and green peppers. Can't go wrong with this, it turns out amazing. Thank you for posting it!

Disclaimer: I used this recipe as a guideline but made quite a few changes (specifically to make it healthier/lighter tasting). I kept the milk/egg/flour ratio as is because that's the part I wanted to make sure I didn't screw up. Instead of shredded cheese on the bottom, I took one of those super thin sliced Sargento cheese and put that at the bottom. Cooked veggies as indicated in the recipe. Then layered on a little chopped up Canadian bacon and chunks of fresh mozzarella. As other reviewers indicated, mixed flour and milk first then added the eggs. Followed the recipe's bake temp/time.  Would definitely make it again. I think that this recipe is pretty forgiving so will play around with different veggies next time.

Nice flavors! I used fresh veggies- mushrooms, spinach, onions, zucchini, tomatoes, and turkey instead of ham and fresh basil.  Very versatile dish.

Wow! Amazing. I followed some suggestions to grease the bottom of the pan and the put the veggies (fresh mushrooms, red pepper, a little garlic, and red onion ), ham ( I bought a ham slice and cut it in cubes) and then the cheese. I used extra sharp cheddar and Monterey Jack cheese.  This was excellent. I will be making this again! YUM!

I thought the mozzarella and cheddar choices were a bit boring and I don't eat meat. So I substituted havarti and baby swiss and didn't include the ham. Made it for a brunch with meat eaters who loved it.  fine!

We had some lunch guests and i added 4 more eggs and didn't add mushrooms since the kids don't like mushrooms. It fed 4 adults and 3 kids with left overs.  One of my new favorites!

Great dish! First I sprayed the baking dish with coconut spray. Couldn't imagine baking cheese on the bottom with no "grease"!  Added poblano peppers and spinach to the vegetable portion. Added sriracha sauce to the egg mixture.  I used Almond milk, not sure if that alters the taste to those that only drink milk, but tastes great to me!

Thanks Erin for a great recipe.  I made it as stated except for size only used 4 eggs and adjusted.  Used a coated pan but still should have sprayed it.  Will make again.  I diced and prepared everything the night before and threw it together  in the am.

I  followed the recipe but used fresh mushrooms and added some New Mexico green chile on the top.  I knew if it didn't have a kick to it , my husband (who's great and eats anything I make) would probably have suggested the green chiles,  I will make this again.  It was very good. Had it with a side of green salad.

used fresh mushrooms, too.   Mistakenly omitted 2 cups of cheese, but still liked it.  My kids did not want the veggies so next time I may just put them in half the casserole.

Added fresh mushrooms. The basil gave it a little something extra. Nothing flashy, but this recipe had everything I'd want in an egg bake casserole. Can't go wrong.

I also used fresh mushrooms and left out the red peppers (pepper allergy in our family), and it turned out beautifully.  It was a big hit on Christmas morning 2015.

I made it with taco cheese and mozzarella cheese. i also used deli turkey and crumbled bacon instead of ham since  it is what i had. i didn't have fresh parsley so used a lil dried. Instead of using spoon to add the milk/flour mix i used whisk to take out the lumps. :) It was totally yummy and the casserole pan cleaned very good.

Very good recipe. My guests went back for seconds and asked for the recipe. The red peppers were a bit overpowering for me. I will reduce the amount next time.  Very good leftover.

Very delicious! I used fresh mushrooms and chopped broccoli that I sauteed with the other vegetables. I excluded the parsley and basil but replaced with sea salt and pepper. What everyone thought was going to be their least favorite turned out to be the FAV!

A very good egg casserole for our school band function.  Was a hit. Super easy to assemble.  Used fresh mushrooms, as well.  Also crumbled 4 strips of cooked bacoN onthe top.  Batter very slightly lumpy,  but did not affect final outcome. Would definitely make again!

This was our family of seven, Christmas late breakfast after the gifts where exchanged and opened it was baking in the oven during this happy time. A couple of changes I made was only putting in the mushrooms in only half of the baking pan as some do not like mushrooms and along with the ham I diced up some peperoni and used it in the whole casserole. Everyone just loved it !!!!!!!!!

family loved it. one issue was putting the cheese on the bottom... it left it there.  to save heartache and wasted money make sure you grease the tray.

Though very good it was so rich that I could only eat a small amount.  Would be very good for a gathering.

Nice taste but it took more time in oven than mentioned in the recipe. After 30 mints mine was still runny, had to increase the temperature. I used chicken and just mozzarella cheese, omit mushrooms.

Tasty and simple blend together to make this a delicious breakfast or brunch meal.  Everyone who has had it, loved it!  I have made this twice using two different ovens and have found that it takes 5-10 minutes longer to bake than stated.
