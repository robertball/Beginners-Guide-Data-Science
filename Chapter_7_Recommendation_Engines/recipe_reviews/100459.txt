This recipe was a winner, thanks to many of the previous reviewers recommendations.
1.  4 hours on low was enough cooking time.
2.  Top the final noodle layer with sauce to prevent drying out.

Also I layered:  sauce, noodles, 1/2 the cheese mixture,1/2 remaining meat sauce, noodles, remaining cheese mixture, remaining meat sauce, noodles, extra tomato sauce (I just used 1 more can), parmesean cheese.

We really loved this recipe. It was the great meal of lasagne, but without the work!  The description of the recipe states that it's layered, but the directions says to just mix it all in.  I mixed it, and that is what I loved MOST about this recipe.  I threw it all together, doctored the sauce just a tad, becuase it's jarred sauce, and presto...it's done.  The family loved it and it was so simple. It doesn't need to cook as long as the recipe states, so prepare for it to be done and ready early.  Will definily make again.

I must admit I’m always looking for a decent slow cooker recipe. We don’t have Bob Evans products here in Canada, so I used some fantastic local Galloping Goose garlic sausage that I removed from the casings. I also couldn’t deal with the lack of veggies. I sautéed some onions, peppers, mushrooms, garlic and spinach to add to the mix. 
Also, a dash of Vermouth, because it makes jarred spaghetti sauce taste much better.
This is a stew, more than a lasagne. You need to break the noodles up smaller than half to mix them in properly. I would even suggest, cooking noodles or pasta separately and then adding them to the crock pot when you add the last of the cheese. The no-bake noodles were a bit gummy. Not the prettiest stuff to look at, but still tasty.

This was a great, easy recipe.  Family loved it.  Will make again, except I think it needed more sausage.

I'm giving this recipe five stars for flavor and ease of preparation.  We love & used a flavorful hot Italian turkey sausage.  I cut the recipe in half, used Newman's Own sauce, and added half of a 10oz. box of frozen spinach into the fry pan while the sausage was browning.

I made my lasagna with pre-cooked meatballs instead of sausage.  I just layered sauce, no bake lasagna noodles, meatballs cut in half, ricotta cheese, sliced provolone cheese, and repeated the layers 3 times.  Cooked on Low for 3-4 hours.  As most other people wrote, the presentation is lacking, but the flavor was delicious.  And it makes tons, so we have dinner for tomorrow night too!

The taste was good, but the noodles were very mushy. I did substitute cottage cheese for the ricotta, becuase my husband doesn't like ricotta. If I ever make this again, I will only cook it for no longer than 2 hours.

While making this dish, I honestly thought it was going to be a disaster.  Wow, was I wrong!!  The plate presentation was horrible, but the lasagna was excellent!!  My 2 year old even enjoyed it.  I did however, use Jimmy Dean Italian Sausage, and just a little more pasta sauce.  Fantastic, I can't wait to make it again!

Used basic recipe, so still wanted to rate 5 stars, but used other raters tips. First off, I used Turkey Store's italian style ground turkey in place of sausage. Secondly, I added browned meat to almost the 2 full jars of sauce..(saved about 1/4 to top off lasgna) Third, I did layer it...sauce....noodles...frost noodles with ricotta. shredded mozz and repeated for 2 layers and ending with a 3rd layer of just noodles topped with plain extra sauce and parm cheese sprinkled on top. I also used regular noodles..NOT no boil. This was fantastic! So easy and a winner! Just as good as the traditional over baked kind!

This is an excellent easy recipe although you can't stop eating it, so it has too many calories.  So I made a few changes.   OK, a lot of changes but it's still the same basic recipe.  First things first, this can be a big mess to clean up, so I like to use slow cooker liners.  You just throw it away when done.  
   I use a third to half sausage and the rest a leaner ground beef.  I first cook the meats, then set aside.  Using the fat from the meats, cook a diced medium onion.  When the onion has been going a couple minutes, I add about a half pound of mushrooms (I use cremini and button about 50-50) sliced medium thick so that they don't just disintegrate.  Turn it off, then add the meat back into the pan along with a bag of raw spinich (it will cook in the pot).  
  I use a jar of pasta sauce and a can of good tomatoes in juice, either diced or whole which I chop inside the can myself.  I have found that Prego heart healthy sauce works fine and has less salt.  I also add fresh or jarred garlic and italian seasoning to the sauce.   I use a bit of water to rinse out the tomato and sauce jars/cans.  It can use a bit more water anyway.  
   Mix about half of the mozzarella (part-skim) with the ricotta and the rest on the top. probably use a bit extra and also add some shredded parmesan on top.  As for cooking time, it took me about 4 to 5 hours.  My family rated this 5 stars but originally it's a bit plain.

I have never rated a recipe on this site before but felt the need on this one.  This was great!!!  I layered the lasagne just as you would with regular lasagne.  We work all day and there was no way to just cook this for 4 hours so in the morning, I put it on the "warm" setting.  My husband came home 8 hours later and it was perfect!!!  Thank you for this recipe - it was great!

I give 5 stars for the amazing idea of using a crockpot. The 1st time I made it I followed the recipe [other than subst. sweet italian sausage] as written & didn't like the consistency of the noodles, but the kids liked it so I kept my mouth shut! 2nd time I followed other reviewers suggestions & my own the night before: in scant olive oil sauteed onions, garlic, about 6 big leaves fresh basil, small handful of Italian Seasoning, 1-2 lbs. bulk sweet italian sausage- chopping sausage into large chunks while cooking rather than crumbling, & 1 lb. hamburger, deglazed w/some Vermouth, mixed all with 1 Newman's jar sauce & the remainder of about 1 C. Vermouth. I had a quart of normal ricotta& used normal [not precooked] lazagna noodles. Lined the crockpot [Reynolds Slow Cooker Liners], started with about 1 C. 2nd jar of Newman's undoctored sauce in bottom, layer of noodles, layer of ricotta, layer my doctored meat/sauce mixture, layer fresh mozzerella, all the way to the top, then poured all the leftover sauce. I ended up using 3/4 of the quart of ricotta & 3/4 of a pound of mozzerella altogether. Left in refrigerator overnight, next day cooked 3 hours on high, then took to a party, put on low about 1 1/2 hour due to circumstances- I was afraid it would overcook; however, it came out perfect- a big hit.

Very good!  My 2 yr old twins loved it.  This is what I did/used:
1 lb ground beef (seasoned with 1/2 tsp fresh basil and some fresh garlic, salt/pepper).  Drained fat.
Mixed in bowl about 3 cups mozarella cheese, 18 oz ricotta cheese, 2 whole eggs, and about 1/2 cup of parmesean.
Put in slow cooker in layers.  Sauce first, then 1/3 of meat w/little sauce on top.  Broke up into large pieces oven-ready (no-boil) lasanga pieces and layed some on top.  Covered with 1/2 of cheese mixture, then sauce with 1/3 of meat and rest of cheese mixture, more layerd lasagna pieces, more sauce and rest of meat.  Covered with mozerrella cheese 1/2 hr before serving.  I used 2 jars of Prego Oregano and Basil sauce.  Cooked for 3 hours on low.  Noodles not mushy (used Safeway brand). 

It was very good and very easy!  

I would add bell pepper, onion and mushrooms if my family would eat it, but they won't so add that if you like more stuff in it.  :o)

This was actually very good and could certainly be tweaked, flavor-wise, to be excellent.  For as easy as it is, I will definitely make it again.  I used whole wheat pasta and boiled it 3-4 minutes before putting it in the crock pot.  I did not think the presentation was nearly as bad as some reviewers.  A keeper for sure!

I love making lasagna in the slow cooker, and this is a good basic recipe (I usually add a variety of ground meats to the sausage and add some more spices and herbs) BUT the "no boil" noodles were very mushy and gummy. I'd stick to the traditional noodles when using the slow cooker....besides that, this is worth a try!

This was maybe the best lasagna I have ever made! I followed the recipe as written, except, I only used 1 and a half jar of pasta sauce. After it was cooked, it was kind of runny, so next time, I will just use one jar. I added an egg and some parm to the ricotta. I layered the lasagna: little sauce at bottom of crock pot, lasagna noodles, meat mix, ricotta mix, cheese. I repeated it one more time and topped it with another layer of noodles and poured enough sauce to cover the uncooked pasta. I cooked this on high in the crock pot and it took a little over 2 hours.

This was very good!! I sauted 1 onion and 1 green pepper after sausage was crumpled and cooked. I layered like lasagna and was able to use almost whole box of lasagna noodles (used regular noodles - not no-cook ones!) - had maybe 4-5 layers! I put it all together night before, stored in frig and in morning cooked on WARM setting for almost 9 hours because we work. Did not even realize you could cook on warm. Noodles were perfect! Tasted awesome!

Made as directed and it was great! 4 hours on low is perfect and mixing it up makes it easy breezy..:) I thought it could use a bit more seasoning, but using spicy sausage next time might take care of that.

Really good stuff! I used vegan beef crumbles instead of the actual meat called for, and skipped the skillet, just dumped everything into the crock pot and let it go. I was surprised it all fit in my 4qt pot, would probably work better in a bigger one.

This was really worth more than 5 stars!  I will certainly make this again.  I did make a few slight changes for my familiy's personal tastes.I used 1/2 pound of ground meat and 1/2 pound of sausage.  While browning the meat I added  a couple tablespons of dried chopped onion and a tablespoon of minced garlic plus a tablespoon of italian seasonings I mixed the sauce with the meat before layering and placed a small amount of sauce in the bottom of the crockpot before layering the rest of the ingredients.   I mixed the mozzarella chesse and the ricotta together and spread on top of each layer.   I sprinkled probably 1/2 cup parmesaen cheese on top for the last 15 minutes along with the mozzarella cheese.  Mine was done in 5 hours on low. No problems with cleaning the crockpot afterwards.

First off,I am a crockpot novice but tried this because my husband wouldn't eat vegetable lasagna and I was determined to use our new crockpot! Five doubting adults later there is not even a hint of lasagna for leftovers,and several requests for the recipe! Scanned many of the comments for the always helpful suggestions and did the following in my oval five quart pot: a little sauce after I sprayed with a nonstick olive oil;two full noodles laid across and about a quarter noodle on either side of the two. I had "frosted" each noodle with a mix of a 15oz. container of Italian ricotta,1 egg, and a half cup each of freshly shredded mozzarella and parmesan,threw in Italian seasoning mix and garlic powder,to taste. Then a layer of meat sauce,made from the two jars of sauce and a combo of a half pound of Jimmy Dean spicy sausage and a half pound of lean ground beef. Continued layering my frosted noodles with the meat sauce until ending with the last of the sauce,didn't even fill pot,so you could easily make recipe larger. Cooked on low three hours and forgot to top with the additional cheese in the last five minutes,that would have been even yummier! I used the cheapest sauce on sale at the grocery,basil garlic flavored,and my only other spices were what I added to the ricotta mixture. Used a slotted spoon to plate and everyone got a nice presentation of layers! Will tweak with other add ins and spices but can already highly recommend this one,it's a keeper!

Made this and turned out great. But I did not use the no-boil noodles. I used regular lasagna noodles and the texture was perfect. I also layered it like a lasagna. The family requests this often! Definitely a keeper.

I used fake ground beef instead of sausage. Also used real noodles, and not the no bake. Like others suggested, we layered. 

Very simple, and tastes great. Will make again for sure, probably with whole wheat noodles instead!

VARIATION ALERT! My gallbladder and I prefer ground turkey to sausage. I browned it w/onions, garlic, garlic powder, s/p. Then added ONE jar of sauce + 1 c. beef broth (to simmer). Meanwhile, in a separate bowl, I mixed a 15oz tub of ricotta, 1 1/2 c. of mozz, 1/2 c. parmesan, plus parsley, oregano, basil, and one egg. Starting with whole wheat lasagna noodles (6 total), I alternated layers of the above in my crock pot (wiped down with olive oil first - I had no spray), ending with meat sauce. Thanks for the inspiration! It's hot here in TX; I leave the oven off whenever possible. Presentation = great! Noodles = not so gummy. Exactly 4 hours on low. Easy.

I ended up throwing out the entire batch sadly.  I like the premise but I did not like the flavor on this at all.  I did add some heat to the sauce beacaus that's how I like it.  It just didn't help.  I also only cooked for two hours on low and found that that the noodles were already soft and bordering on mushy.  Unfortunately, don't think I will be making this one again.

I was surprised how good this was.  I used bulk mild store brand Italian sausage.  Browned it then added the pasta sauce to the skillet.  Put a little sauce in the bottom of the cooker, then layered with regular whole wheat lasagna noodles breaking them off to fit,. Ricotta on top of that, then mozzarella, then ladled the meat/sauce on top of that.  Then pasta again, and so on.  Cooked for about 3 1/2 hours.  Was able to cut out nice layered portions and serve.

I am giving this 3 stars with promise. I intend to add a lot more next time to give this the texture and taste I'd prefer. 1) add chopped onion, chopped red pepper, a bag of fresh spinach, garlic, red pepper flakes and Italian seasoning. 2) add more meat - spicy Italian sausage was great but will go with 2 lbs versus 1.  3)definitely DO NOT use no-boil noodles. They were incredibly soggy. Flavor was great and recipe was easy but the texture of the noodles was like paste.

I used whole wheat regular noodles and found that I should have used many more of them - 8 hours on warm was definitely enough time to cook them.  Also added red peppers and onions.  Loved this, and it was pretty easy.

It doesn't get much easier than this. Definitely make sure to choose a high quality pasta sauce for good flavor. Depending on how much you like cheese, you might want to up the ricotta portion; we used about 20oz total. Also chose spicy ground sausage. Very tasty.

I followed the suggestions of others and cut the cooking time down to 2 1/2 hours. The noodles were still mushy, The remaining meat sauce tastes ok, not anything special, and I will figure out something else to do with it. It will need some spices and major doctoring.  .

Very easy once you cook the sausage. I used 3 leftover bratwurst (took the casing off, broke up and browned in a skilllet). Love throwing it all in and not worrying about layering. Stirring is a bit hard when it's raw, so don't worry about distributing ingredients evenly too much at that point. Stir it again before putting the cheese on top the last 5 minutes and it will be fine. It's not too pretty, but it's a good, easy, family weeknight meal.  At 4 hours mine was a bit overdone (slightly mushy noodles), so watch for it to be done sooner.

This lasagna turned out awesome.  I used 2 lbs of Sausage and added slices of Provolone cheese.  I layed it like a normal lasagna.  It was divine! So easy and so delicious!

I have a 6 qt oval slow cooker and the lasagna was done in 4 hours exactly.  I did use the oven ready noodle.  They were fine.  I'm going to use the regular noodles next time just to compare.

I do recommend doubling the sausage. And be sure to add wine and garlic to the bottled sauce. I make a 2- day process lasagna and my husband says this crock pot lasagna is just as ggod as the 2-day version.

Also this recipe is a real winner for a potluck.....easy, yummy,portable and everyone loves it!

Made this last night for myself and six boys...it went so fast, I didn't even get a second helping!!  Planned to take a picture (as it looked as amazing as it tasted) but as soon as I took the lid off, I had a mad rush to the crockpot!  I did add 8oz. of fresh mushrooms and a yellow onion to the sausage and browned it all together before dumping it into the crockpot.  I asked the boys if this wwas one they wanted again and got a unanimous YES!  (In fact, they were bummed when I told them it wouldn't be tonight!!)

Ridiculously easy to make.  I agree, cook for less time.  I set it for 3 hours on low and I think it would have been fine at even 2 or 2.5.  I also added layers of sliced zucchini and used two different kinds of pasta sauce: tomato basil and vodka sauce.  Since I used the latter I was able to use less cheese.  So yummy and so easy.

This was tasty!  I followed the recipe for the most part only substituting some ground beef for half the sausage and a bit more ricotta with less mozzarella.   A few tips:  I tried layering this like a traditional lasagna.  While it cooked the liquid from the pasta sauce rose to the top.  I thought the whole pot was going to be a soupy mess but I stirred it a couple times during cooking and that helped redistribute the liquid.  Also, if you decide to layer the recipe then only use a SINGLE layer of lasagna noodles for each noodle layer, don't overlap them a lot otherwise they will become gummy and not cook properly.  Next time I make this I'll just toss it all in the pot and stir not bothering to layer it and see if this takes care of these 2 minor issues.  All in all a hearty, filling recipe that is more healthful than most "add a can 'o soup" crockpot meals that can be made even more so with the substitution of a few ingredients.

I love this simple recipe.  I could not find the sausage brand listed so just used what I could find.  I made exactly as stated, sausage, noodles, then everything else mixed on top.  After about an hour I stirred the sausage and noodles around a bit so they weren't stuck on the bottom.  Also, I only let this cook on low for 3 1/2 hours and that seemed to be perfect and not mushy.  Also fantastic as a leftover!

Easy and yummy.  Stiring in another bowl before spooning into the crock pot might work better.  I did not, so I sort of rearranged the noodles so they wouldn't be bunched together.  Also is great for a leftover!

This is a favorite...I had to double the pasta and sauce as well as other ingredients...I've cooked this twice and there are never any leftovers. I used regular cooking lasagna noodles...I also added minced garlic, italian seasoning,and chopped onions for a more flavorful and chuncky taste..mmmmm good.If I could give this more than 5 stars I would.

I used KARLA10's layering suggestion and this turned out very good. I added 1 Tblsp. of Wildtree spaghetti seasoning and one small , chopped onion to the pan of sausage, and also mixed in the 2 jars of spaghetti sauce to help with quicker layering. Instead of ricotta cheese (my family and I don't like ricotta in our lasagna), I put in some low-fat cottage cheese. I added 1 box of organic spinach and some shredded parmesan into the cheese mixture to add in some veggies. This is simply delicious and I am so happy to be able to make this in the crock pot since we will be having 100+ degree weather in my area for the next few weeks. I love my crockpot!

Good recipe. I took the advice of a previous review and layered the different items, then poured an additional jar of sauce over the top.  In reference to the noodles being soggy, it all comes to preference of how much "bite" your noodles have at the end of cooking.  I suspect that the use of "cooking required" noodles would leave more of a bite. Also, 4 hours on low is the max on cooking time. I had to only give 4 stars though because it does require a few changes to the recipe.

Really need to watch the time on this one. The noodles can burn on edges. I had to add extra sauce and seasonings. Otherwise, a good slow recipe that I would use again

AWESOME! I'm never going to bake a lasagna again! I loved the ease of this recipe. I did mix it all up, so presentation was not the prettiest but the taste was fantastic. Maybe next time I will layer like the other reviewers were able to do.

EXCELLENT!!! This is one of the best lasagnas i ever made, and so easy too! I layered the pieces of lasagna, and did not stir it, and it turned out wonderfully. I also added a can of diced tomatoes to the sauce, to make it extra chunky. My boyfriend absolutely loved this lasagna. The first time I made him the "Best Lasagna" recipe made on this site, which was also very delicious, but took way too much time (3+ hours). Definately my favorite slow cooker recipe. I will be making this one again and again.

The sauce was the only save on this recipe.  The noodles were mush but the sauce was tasty.  I will stick to my traditional lasagna in the oven.

I followed the recipe exactly, and I dont know what went wrong but this was entirely inedible. The noodles were mushy and the whole thing was a mess. I dont like rating this low, but when I didnt change anything, and I couldnt even eat it I'm not sure what else to rate it at!

This is a great recipe!  I have served several times now and everyone raves about it.  I layer like a regular lasagne, rather then mix.  Lasagne stays wonderfully moise, not dry like conventional lasagne can be.  A definite winner!

Loved this recipe so much that, "as we speak",  I am making it once again with a few modifications. I used more sausage (sweet italian), more garlic and herbs and more sauce. I tried to layer it, so... no mixing. I am using a digital slow cooker.  I'll be going home within a couple of hours to a home made meal.

Easy, tasty and simple.  I too cooked it for only 4 hours and that was plenty.  I just doctored the jared sauce a bit, but other than that no changes needed at all.  Hubby loved it, and it's very hearty so it goes a long way.

This was a smash hit!  I used a couple more oz of ricotta, a little less mozzarella, and layered it in rather than mixed it.  I used about a half of a 9oz box of no-boil lasagne noodles, and they didn't turn out gummy at all!  I seasoned each layer of sauce with parsley, basil, and oregano, and left it in the slow cooker for 2 hours on low, then put it on high for one more hour.  Awesome, and I love the crockpot idea!!!

Very easy and quick--the hardest part is mixing in the lasagna noodles, as they are big.  I think I will layer it next time just to avoid that, but otherwise perfect.  Tastes like regular lasagna, and even my bf, who does not like ricotta cheese, liked this recipe.

Cooked this for a church social.  First time cooking lasagne in the slow cooker.  Will never use oven again!  I used the advice of others and used an oven bag.  I used 2 lbs of Italian sausage. 1sweet and 1mild. I sautéed some onion and garlic in the sausage Drippings. I took tips from others and mixed the ricotta and mozzarella in a separate bowl   I mixed some oregano and basil into cheese mixture. I also used large container of ricotta (2lbs). I layered like others suggested.  Used two jars of sauce.  I got about 4 or 5 layers in my large oval crock pot. I put it together the night before.   I cooked on warm for 4 hrs.  Used gluten free noodles that would be comparable to reg noodles in that they were the "normal cook" kind.  I hoped to have left overs when I got the first serving because it was delicious! I was disappointed because i had nothing to bring home. I saw people going back for seconds....it was all gone.   My family commented that they want me to  cook this just for us......they wanted left overs too!  I will be adding this to my list of go to dinners!

Great! I followed some advice from other reviewers. Boiled, NOT oven ready, noodles layered like a traditional lasagna. Meat sauce, noodle, cheese x 3 layers with additional meat sauce on top. Made it the night before, refrigerated, then 4 hours on low with a cup of shredded mozz added during the last 15 minutes to pretty up the top. As written it filled an oval slow cooker about 2/3 full.

I made a very similar recipe to this, the only difference was the portion sizes and it had me cook an onion w/ the sausage.  This was delicious!  A little dry to my taste, but I think that's b/c I cooked it too long.  Next time I won't cook as long, and probably add more cheese and some mushrooms.  The overall flavor was delicious, and easy to prep.  I made the night before and refrigerated.

Made it yesterday, according to recipe. I didn't have much sausage so I substituted ground beef for the res and it was PHENOMENAL! So delicious, and I cannot believe I hadn't done this before. I was nervous about the directions to mix it all up in the pot, because lasagna usually has "layers", but it turned out perfectly. We're having it again tonight for leftovers, and I'm actually excited. Serve with a quick tossed salad or green vegetables, and a loaf of garlic bread or some rolls, and you've got a fantastic supper. ;o)

Excellent! However next time I plan on layering all the ingredients. I might also add some other ingredients as well. I used a crock pot liner for easy clean up.

very tasty.  I let mine cook for 3 hours or so.  I added fresh basil to the sauce.  Sauce was my top layer.  I added cheese after i cut off the crockpot, taking the advice of other reviewers.  I added mushrooms to the sauce, green bell pepper, and onions too.  I topped each layer with ricotta cheese and parm cheese.  very nice.

I rate this 5 stars for taste and ease of preparation. This was the first time I have used oven ready (no boil) lasagna noodles, and for me, there is no going back to the mess and wasted time of boiling and torn noodles. I layered the lasagna ingredients in a 6-qt slow cooker, and after reading other posts about lack of flavor and too-long cooking time, I added some herbs from my garden and put the crockery in the frig for the next day. Cooked it on low for 3 hrs 4 mins--it was fully cooked by then even though the ingredients were frig cold when I started. My family loved the blend of seasonings and perfect texture. With an entire pound of Italian sausage in the pot, this recipe was anything but bland. It was 100% perfect, a sure 10. I will definitely make this recipe again and again.

Wonderful and so easy!  I added veggies as well(eggplant, pepper, onion) and also added some (drained) cottage cheese & shredded mozz. to the ricotta.  I followed previous reviewers suggestions and "frosted" the noodles with the ricotta mixture in order to have more of a layered lasagna.  Alternated layers: "frosted" noodles, spices, sauce/meat mixtures, veggies, shredded mozz.  Next time I think I will add a couple of mozzarella cheese slices to a layer...it was a little drier than I prefer, but that was b/c of all of the ricotta & maybe I should have used regular shredded mozz. instead of the thinly shredded kind?  Either way, this one's a keeper and I was happy with my first attempt at crockpot lasagna!

Very easy, will make again, however next time I will add more seasonings it tasted a little bland. Also use a oval crock pot instead of round,  all the ingredients fit in better.

yum! I had to share this with coworkers when they saw my leftovers at lunch. I would ADD more sauce in the last 30 mins of cooking next time to keep it from getting dry

Not bad. I will have to try it with the traditional pasta to decide if I like the no-boil type better.

Hmmm..well, this is middle of the road for me.  It is a good idea for a quick and simple way to make a "mock-sagna."  That said, I had some issues.  I read the reviews and saw where many had issues with gummy noodles, so I wanted to try to fix that.  Also, my family doesn't like sausage in their lasagna, so I used burger...about 1 1/2 lbs.  Oh, and I am one of those people that doesn't like ricotta in my lasagna, so I used cottage cheese.  So, burger, 1 box of bowtie noodles, 2 jars of sauce, 1 container of cottage cheese, parsley, and the mozzarella.  Now, I figured I would cook it for about 3 hours on low.  It looked good.  It smelled good.  It even mostly tasted ok (for being jarred sauce and all).  Still had gummy noodles...like really gummy.  And, heaven help me for saying this, too much cheese!  I love cheese...I do!  But between the gumminess of the noodles and the amount of cheese, this was bordering on a really bad texture for me.  Being the way that I am, I'll probably try this again just to see if I can catch it before the noodles get gummy (and cut back the cheese a little...sigh).  It's a great idea!  It just needs some tweaking!

This seemed too totally weird for me, so I made the slow cooker lasagna a different way. This gets stars for the suggestion, because I wouldn't have thought to make lasagna in a slow cooker. The night before I cooked some regular lasagna noodles (a little less than half of a big box) until about 3 minutes before the package recommended.  I spread tomato sauce on the bottom of my slow cooker and added noodles, a thin layer of ricotta, some boca meat crumbles, a little bit of mozzerella, more sauce and repeat.  I only used about 1/2 of a 2 cup bag of mozzerella and I occasionally added a few sprinkles of dried parsley and dried oregano.  The top layer got lasagna, sauce and mozzarella cheese. I used about 3/4 of a jar of pre-made spaghetti sauce. I refrigerated it overnight and turned the slow cooker to high at 3:30, on my break at home between work and grad school. By the time I got home at 9, my partner had cooked the garlic bread and sweet corn and we had a hot meal.  It wasn't the most exciting dish I've had, but it was easy and a real time saver.  I would definitely recommend some more spices or maybe some veggies.  Hope this helps some busy folks out there!

This was a big hit with the kids which is majorly important in my house.  And it was SO easy.  I think next time I'll use some other kind of pasta as I have a small crockpot.  Thanks for the recipe!

So very good!  I layered instead of stirred.  Had my in-laws over for dinner, this literally took me 10 minutes to throw together and then it just baked itself.  They all raved about it.  I believe I added extra parsley and some oregano over the cheese layer.  I agree, presentation is definitely lacking but the taste more than makes up for it!  Very easy dish that pleases, will surely make again!

I am a picky lasagna eater.  I decided to try this recipe and it was good.  I tweeked it a little bit just to add a little more flovor.  I added garlic salt, dried parsley, oregano and 1 egg to the ricotta cheese to add more flavor.  I will definately make this again!

I loved this recipe as is, it is so simple to make as well as it is simple on the few ingredients that you need! I am lazy, having a six year old and working til 3am kinda do that to you, so I just mixed mine all together and it was wonderful! Be warned if made as is it is very thick/hearty because of all the cheese, I did throw in some cottage cheese for the leftovers to soften it up and make it creamier. I am making it again today only this time I am replacing the ricotta with the cottage cheese but I am sure it will come out just as good! I do throw in some canned mushrooms just cause our family loves mushrooms (: Enjoy!

I made this for the first time today and I will definitely make it again.  I used my own sauce; just made sure I had the same quantity.  I also used extra smooth ricotta and uncooked, regular lasagna noodles.  I have a large crock pot and it was ready in 3.5 hours.

I have never made lasagna before. I was always super intimidated and it just looked too time consuming. I made this recipe almost exactly as listed. I did add ground beef, parmesan, and asiago cheese cuz those are my faves. I took it to a ladies potluck and they all loved it and asked for the recipe. I had split the recipe and put some in a smaller crockpot for my family and all 5 of them loved it. This will for sure be a staple in my recipe book!!

I made this with ground beef instead of sausage.  It was delicious! As many others have mentioned, it didn't take that long to cook. I put it on high for 2 hours and it was perfect. I layered sauce, pasta, beef, ricotta, mozzarella/cheddar mix cheese (3 layers in total). Next time, I might consider using a spicy pasta sauce to give it a bit more of a kick!

I ended up just breaking the noodle up. I think I might have cooked it to long. It was dry. I would add another can of paste and more meat next time. My version end up just being a spoon shovel slop type meal. Good for the weekend.

The bottom layer of mine was sausage and sauce, then noodles, ricatta and mozz and sauce, noodles, sauces spices, and about 1/4 inch of water. Cooked on high for 4.5 hours.  It was THE BEST LASAGNA I have ever had, but I am not Italian.

This was great! My two-year-old loved it, which makes it a definite keeper.   We are vegetarian, so I replaced the sausage with one cup of TVP. I also had to add another half jar of sauce at the end of cooking since it was getting a bit dry. I omitted some of the cheese, and I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta.

So Good and hardly any clean-up. I used regular noodles and par-boiled them. Also, I added fresh spinach and mushrooms! Delicious!! It was done in 3 hours on LOW!

I made the mistake of throwing this all together in the pot (not layering it) the first time I made it.  It still tasted really good, but the appearance left a lot to be desired.  I find that I cut down the noodles to about 3/4 a package and up the sauce to about 2 1/2 jars.  This is probably to compensate for not minding the clock and having no idea how long it actually cooked.  But overall, for the ease and ability to leave it in the crock pot for my husband, who gets home 5 hours after me, it's a great, quick option.

I followed this recipe exactly except for adding a leftover few mushrooms and minced garlic to the sauce. To be fair I didn't even taste it.  But my husband did and it was made for him.  This is what he said- Lasagna is amazing !!! I just had a bowl and I love it !!!!  So based on that feedback and how easy it was to make I give it 5 stars.

My daughter made this into a VEGETARIAN version. Turned out wonderful! In  a skillet she sautéed,  in olive oil,  1 medium chopped onion and 3 minced cloves garlic- cooked until soft - then added a box of 'Boca Crumbles' (or use one bag Morningstar Farms crumbles), cooked just until heated through.   She also added fresh basil and extra 1/2 jar pasta sauce so it wouldn’t get too dry.  It was awesome!

I used cottage cheese, and layered instead of mixing. Other than that, I made it as stated. Mine was basically a soup! I can't imagine how some people said theirs dried out! I would cut the pasta sauce by HALF, if I make it again. I wonder if everyone else used TWO cans of sauce, as it stated in the recipe?? Bottom line: Even being so soupy I had to eat it from a bowl, the flavor is enough to make me try it again.

We used meatballs, and way too much ricotta (my husband wasn't reading amounts, unfortunately!)  and this was still fabulous!  We had lasagna loving company who all gave it the thumbs up.  Be warned...not pretty to serve, but still worthwhile!

Pretty good for being so easy to put together. I added chopped green bell pepper and sweet onion plus a little garlic to the sausage as it finished browning. Mixed it all up instead of layering, so I had to break up the noodles a little bit smaller. Use a quality jarred sauce that you really like, since there is so much of it in this recipe. I used the full cooking time plus a little extra and it was just fine.

OK, it's easy and I actually put 3 cans of diced basil & garlic tomatoes and one can of tomato paste and some herbs and seasoning (salt/pepper) and frozen ground beef and regular noodles with 4 cups water, left it on high for 2 hours and (stirred it up) then left it on warm for another 5 hours while I went to work. Then I added ricotta cheese and Parmesan cheese and stirred again and added salt. My kids loved it, the easiest thing to do!

This is a good recipe and easy to make. I left out the ricotta (I don't like it) and layered everything in the crock-pot. It ended up cooking for about 4 1/2 hours which I think ended up being way to long. The noodles were way to soft at that point. I think next time I will only let it go for about 3 - 3 1/2 hours. It still tasted really good though!

This was good - but could be improved.  I used less noodles and ended up using more sause as it really got dry.  I also used less cheese as it really called for a lot. I liked it, hubby thought it was okay but needed many more noodles..Uh, I dont know if I would make it again.

This was a good slow cooker recipe although not as good as an oven baked lasagne.  Good for when a crock pot meal fits your days agenda.  I agree with others that the noodle consistency gets a bit rubbery.  I also found that I needed to add approx. 1 cup more of sauce than stated otherwise it was drying out.  I layered ingredients instead of stirring and cooked for 3 hours on low which was plenty.  I will make again and experiment with subsitutions like ground beef, zucchini, eggplant or spinach.

this was really surprisingly good.  yes, presentation is not great but the taste is wonderful.   i did layer it and used half spicy sausage and half sweet italian sausage.  beware that this makes a ton of food.  i also broke up the noddles into 1/4's as my oval crockpot didn't accomodate the larger size and it worked well. also, this was ready in 2 hours in high. great recipe and a definite keeper.

Definitely a keeper recipe, as others have stated. My husband loves this one! We use Italian style chicken sausage from Trader Joe's. I was surprised to find that the quality/taste of the pasta sauce doesn't even matter than much due to the flavor from the ricotta/mozz mix. Meaning: don't waste your best pasta sauce on this forgiving recipe. 4 stars only because of the lousy presentation.

I made this with ground beef which I cooked before adding to the slow cooker. I layered all the components and it actually turned out very well. Not as good as a proper oven made lasagna but still a great quick & easy alternative!

Made this dish when we went camping. I layered it and also sprinkled a small amount of parmesan cheese on layers. Super easy to make. Only cooked for 3 1/2 hours and was perfect.  Will definately make again.

I made mine with the no boil noodles.  I layered in the crockpot sauce, noodles, sausage, ricotta and mozzarella three times.  Topped with noodles, sauce and mozzarella.  I did not stir.  Cooked on low for 2 hours.  It came out great.  The noodles were not mushy.  Served with garlic French toast.  Will make this again.

Very quick and easy to put together.  I loved being able to make a family favorite but not spend the time putting it all together.  I definitely prefer a more traditional lasagna over a slow cooked one, but I will definitely make it again in the future in order to save time.

It was so easy and good! I had set the crockpot on high for 4 hours, but it was definitely ready after 1.4 hours (glad I sampled it!). I used 2 packages of sausage and happy with the result, but was a little salty so will add spinach next time. I also layered the ingredients even though the instructions say to mix it in, which worked great. Will make again.

The worst recipe I have ever tried. A notch below frozen lasagna. The nicest thing my husband had to say about the meal is that the side salad was good.

First time reviewing.  5 stars for taste but especially for how easy this was.  I used my longer crockpot and made several layers starting with meat, cheeses, noodles and ending with meat again so the noodles wouldn't dry out.  I cooked it for 3.5 hours on low, then shut it off for the next hour until dinner time.  I used the no-bake noodles and just broke them to fit.  I used a roll of the cheapest Italian sausage and then I added some leftover hamburger/spaghetti sauce I had frozen to it as well.   I usually only make lasagna 2x a year but this is so easy (and so good) that I will make it on a regular basis now.  That makes my family happy.  

In the future I plan to triple the meat/sauce and freeze it.  Having the sauce ready will make the prep time about 10 minutes.  Thanks for sharing.

When I made this the noodles came out softer than we like them (I used the no-boil type of noodles).  Otherwise it was good.  Didn't really save any time from making it the traditional way.

I don't know how authentic this recipe is, but every time I have made it for a crowd the slow-cooker is empty by the end of the night. It's a cheap and tasty way to feed a big crowd.

This is a keeper! Very easy to put together and a very good dinner. I very surprised that I was able to cut and serve a nice firm square. I will be making this again. It was a hit with all! Thanks! Love that crock-pot!

So good! I made this for a pot luck at work and the students loved it! I used sweet basil pasta sauce and medium spiced sausage. I also use Trader Joes no bake lasagna noodles and never get soggy noodles! I made the sausage the night before, refrigerated over night and assembled at work. 3.5-4 hrs worked well for me.

I always add italian seasoning, parsley, parmesan cheese to my Ricotta when making Lasagna. I also use sweet and italian sausage and pepperoni for my meats-it one of my hubby's favorites and lots of flavor. I used reg. lasagna noodles and layered it. Other than the meats,sauce I always mix together.  Will make this again.

I'm not going to try and convince anyone that this is among the best lasagna I've had.  It's not.  However, for a quick and easy slow cooker recipe that can satisfy your craving for a good lasagna, this does the trick.  I did put in a little extra effort and layered the ingredients to make it more lasagna like: sauce, noodles, ricotta, meat sauce, mozzarella, noodles, and so on.  Save a cup of mozzarella for just before serving.  Not among the 5 star lasagnas out there, but 5 star lasagnas aren't this easy.

For what it is, it's good. But I still prefer the over-baked lasagna when I have time to make it. This recipe doesn't look pretty, more of a family meal than something for guests.

DO NOT COOK FOR 4 HOURS. TOO MUSHY. I'd say maybe only an hour and 1/2 like other ppl say. The flavor is great though.

I can't quote my children...because all 5 were giving me thumbs up while nodding their heads vigorously in approval while their mouths were full!  lol Even hubby, who detests lasagna, said it was ok!  VERY easy.  VERY good.  What more could a mom ask for?

I did everything as written in the recipe. The only thing I wished I had done differently was to break up the lasagne sheets more because I'm thinking that my crockpot was smaller than the one used in the original recipe. Some of the noodles stuck together even though I mixed everything well. Other than this, delicious!

It's a great hit at my home!  WHAT'S DIFFERENT:  I used 1.5 lbs of browned ground turkey, 15 oz ricotta, 2 cups mozzarella, and just 1 jar of pasta sauce.  I mixed the ricotta, mozzarella, and parsley in a separate bowl; and layered that mixture with the meat, pasta and sauce (pasta at bottom; sauce; meat; ricotta mixture; repeat; pasta & sauce).  I also lined my slow cooker with an oven bag.  I set it for 10 hours on low, but it was ready in about 1.5 hours.  Sprinkled Parmesan cheese on top and it is delicious!  Next time, I will season the ground turkey when browning.  I can't believe I found something that causes no complaints and many helpings.  :)

I expected this one to be a total fail but it turned out quite good.  I used a lb of turkey sausage that I took out of casings.  I browned some onions, mushrooms and eggplant too.  For the sauce I used one jar of spaghetti sauce and one jar of diced tomatoes (I like sauce to be a bit chunky).  I also pureed some cottage cheese in the food processor in place of the ricotta (it tastes the same in lasagna).  I cooked it for two hours on low and one hour on high.  The noodles were perfectly cooked, probably because I used the preboil ones.  I'll definitely use this method again.  It was a great way to make lasagna without heating up the stove!

The first time I made this, I followed the directions exactly. Six hours in the crock pot was was too long, even on low, as the top got too brown. The taste however, was fantastic. On the second go-round I tried to tackle those monstrous calorie/fat numbers. I used lean ital turkey sausage, 8 oz ricotta, and 1 1/2 cups lowfat monz cheese. I also added a can of mushrooms and 1/2 cup of sauteed bell pepper and onion.  Although not as rich, it had a great taste. Thanks!

This was fantastic!  Even my four year old ate it, and she usually likes all her foods separated.  I did make some alterations based upon what I had on hand, and it still came out great.  For the meat, I mixed half sausage and half ground beef.  I didn't have ricotta cheese, so used cottage cheese.  I sprinkled a little parmesan cheese on top.  Everything else I kept the same.  I cooked it for 2 hours on low and it was perfect.

I used a little more ricotta than called for, a little less mozzarealla, a little less sauce (four cheese was tasty!), and extra minced garlic along with other Italian seasonings. Next time I'll remember to add black olives, too!! * Everyone loved it!! * leftovers only get better...

This did not work. Took a long time to cook and the noodles tasted like glue. Will not make again. Guess I will have to stick to the tried-and-true way of making lasagna!
