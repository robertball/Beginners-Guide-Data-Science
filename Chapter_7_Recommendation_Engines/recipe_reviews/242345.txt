Made this for Recipe Group...This was easy and good! It really smelled so awesomely yummy while it was cooking that I was actually expecting more flavor from it though. Followed the recipe, but started w/ thawed chicken, as I did not catch to cook it from frozen until it was too late, but that was fine. Added more liquid to the shredded chicken than called for to keep it moist and add more flavor. Loved the chipotle cream sauce (I added extra chipotle b/c we love it). Served on WW flour tortillas w/ shredded cheddar, tomatoes, red onion slices and the sauce. All in all this was nice for a change and the guys liked it. Thanks for sharing. :)

This was ok but nothing about the chicken or sauce stood out.

Recipe Group: This is excellent! I cooked on low for 6 hours and the chicken was perfect. Subbed white wine vinegar for red. The chipotle cream sauce was great (I only used one pepper) but I think it was a little too much. Half would have been enough for us. Awesome easy dinner, thanks for the recipe!
