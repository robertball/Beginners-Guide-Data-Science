This is the perfect cinnamon raisin bread, if you don't like the swirl kind. It makes great toast too. My changes are as follows: I only used 2 cups of raisins and that was plenty, I soaked the raisins for 2 hours not overnight, and I ran out of molasses so I used half honey which again was delicious but I will stick with molasses next time and see if there is a difference. It turned out fantastic. It made 3 medium size loaves for me and I only baked them for 30 min. at 350 F.

This is the first time I have received a notice that I had a review on my recipe.
So what a surprise to see all these.

I am so glad you have all enjoyed it!
It is my favourite bread to make and LOL! to eat.

Mom2girls:  I have to say that I only use cinnamon.  I just increase it.
I have found a cinnamon honey spread that is to die for (intense)  and next time I make the bread I think I am  going to mix it in, replacing the cinnamon.

pomplemousse:   Thank you so much for posting the picture.
Your bread looks great!

pomplemousse:  I also use boiling water.  I also soak the raisins overnight.

I have made this bread several times now, it is the best I have ever tasted.The only change made was to substitute 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp allspice for the mace which I didn't have.Beware it is addictive!!!

This bread is really nice.  Very mild, with a cinnamon taste and a light bread, even with the molasses.  I halved this recipe and still got two loaves--I'm thinking my loaf pans are small, as I often end up with higher loaves of bread.  I soaked the raisins in boiling water (oops, missed the lukewarm part) for about a 1/2 hour, and it was fine.  I also left out the mace since I didn't have it.  I thought this turned out really well.  Thanks for the recipe!

Just like Mom's, I only used cinnamon because that's what I'm use to. This brings me home to Labrador whenever I bake this!

I love this lassy bread recipe.  I've made it several times. The last time I made it I substituted 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp of allspice for the mace and cloves since I didn't have any on hand.  I get 3 large loaves of bread out of this recipe.  I freeze two of the loaves so it lasts longer.  Take it out of the freezer the night before you intend to eat it and it's almost as good having it right out of the oven.  Reminds me of growing up in rural Newfoundland.

As this recipe is written, it is unworkable.  First, 4 cups of raisins is way too many raisins. Soaked or dry.   I reduced to 2 cups of raisins, soaked. One packet of yeast was insufficient to rise this dough. I added a second packet.  Next, 6 cups of flour is insufficient to knead the dough.  I added an additional cup and a half of unbleached flour and used a bread hook with my mixer.  The dough never balled up like a bread dough.  It was elastic like a bread dough but was more batter than dough. I added the raisins to the flour and spices. Not into the milk mixture.  Otherwise the raisins would rise to the top and not be dispersed through the entire loaf.  I was determined to save this bread because it would have been costly to dump.  The yield was three loaves.  The bread was OK. By OK I mean edible but not anything special. I doubt that I will make it again.  The rating for this recipe is misleading.  This recipe would have been a total loss to a beginner.  I don't like to trash people's recipes but I find it hard to believe that anyone could have successfully produced this recipe as written.

I made this and it was great...the slightly hard crusty top was good.  Only changes I made was to no soak the raisins and used nutmeg instead of "mace"?
