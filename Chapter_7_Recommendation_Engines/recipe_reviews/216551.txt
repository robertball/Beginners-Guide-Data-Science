Yummy!  We used turkey bacon and strawberry jam because we had those ingredients on hand and this sandwich turned out scrumptious!

Very good.  A husband pleaser for sure.  We used Dave's blues bread to make it a little healthier, and I think that made it even yummier!  I liked the spicy after-taste.

I had this yesterday and was blown away! I was so impressed I told everyone about it today. My friend was so interested he asked me to make it tonight. Sooo glad I did, best sandwich ever! FYI: Cajun seasoning in place of, or with the cayenne if you prefer, made it intensely better, just saying.... I chose with

OMG! I love apples, bacon, and especially peanut butter but never would have thought of this combination in a grilled sandwich! This was oh so goey and good. It was a great blend of sweet and salty with just the right amount of spice from the cayenne. It definitely gives your taste buds a work out. I used thick sliced whole grain bread, but whatever bread you use this is bound to be delicious. This is definitely a case of don't knock it 'til ya try it!

It was okay. Even though my kids like all the elements that went in it they didn't like them together. They said is was all squished together.

This earns a solid 4 stars from me.  I braved the grocery store after work on Friday before the Super Bowl just to get a Granny Smith apple and bread to make this for breakfast Saturday morning.  I followed the recipe w/a few minor tweaks:  I microwaved my bacon (because I'm lazy) and I eliminated two slices of bread (I used white because I wanted an *excuse* to indulge in some cheap white Italian loaf bread) because I knew 4 would make it way to hard to eat.  I didn't measure the ingredients, just used enough to cover the bread.  While I was eating, I couldn't *find* the pepper, but there's a nice heat in my mouth no, so it was def there.  I enjoyed the novelty of this, but doubt that I'll make it again.  That being said, I DO strongly recommend giving this unique sandwich a try for yourself!  THANKS for a great Saturday morning breakfast, niki.gillespie!

Couldn't wait to try this as it sounds SOOO good.  Thought I'd check the calorie count.  Rats!
Rated it 5 stars anyway because I know I would have loved it.

Ahhhh-mazing!  I was really skeptical about this sandwich, but I was pleasantly surprised that it's delicious!  I know the combination sounds ridiculous (I was asked if I was pregnant. Ha!) but all the ingredients put together make for some grilled sandwich awesomeness.  A definite candidate for a permanent place in my recipe box!

The flavours all go together surprisingly well, considering how different they are. This was an easy recipe to make, and a hit with the meat-lovers in the family.

I have been thinking about making this recipe for years, but the ingredients terrified me. As a conservative approach, I cut the peanut butter and apricot jelly in half, added more cayenne, then threw in some brie cheese. My husband loved it!  I did too. I am thinking that Swiss cheese may work as well. I agree with the previous reviewer who said don't know it until you try it". Very unique, creative, and oh so tasty.

Wow!  I was pretty sceptical when I first read this recipe but it was really good!  I used strawberry jam as I did not have apricot and omitted the cayenne as we don't care for it.  YUMMY!  Thanks for a great recipe I know I will make again for my family!

This recipe caught my eye on a day when I hadn't quite made it out of the house to the grocery store. This sandwich is great because it can be altered to include ingredients you already have in your fridge! I used turkey bacon, granny smith apples, cream cheese and seedless raspberry jelly. Sooooo good! I also just toasted some white bread because I didn't have a panini press (but I do think a panini press would take this to an even higher level). I WILL be making this again and again!

Just a little spice mixed with a good dose of sweet, savory, and salty. I don't know why some people think that the combination of apple and bacon is weird; it makes perfect sense to me. I got a few strange looks eating this, but after my family deigned to try it, they were instantly charmed! I don't normally like apples - I find them sort of bland - but in this case, I make a very big exception!
