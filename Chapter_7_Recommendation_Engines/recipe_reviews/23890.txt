Awesome! Very easy and VERY, VERY good. After reading previous reviews, I took many suggestion to great success. I used to 2 choice round steaks and cut them up. Added 2 more teaspoons of salt. Reduced Pepper to 1/2-teaspoon. The browning of the meat is definitely important, do this with care and make sure you get a nice crust on the meat without burning. Also added to great delight fresh herbs - thyme, sage, rosemary and 2 dry bay leaves as well as 1 can of crushed tomatoes + 2 tablespoons of Worchestire. Warning...you will need a big pot, this makes alot. Another suggestion, brown meat and onions in another large saute pan and deglaze with a little of the broth and butter. I didn't have beef broth so I used beef boullion and boiling water instead and it still turned out great. Also, used corn starch mixed with water instead to thicken. It was all gone and even my mother loved it to my surprise. A definite WINNER and REPEAT recipe. Thanks Angel.

When I see FIVE STAR recipes reviewed by this many people, I expect the recipe itself to stand on it's own, with little or no modification.

As is, this recipe is a TWO STAR; unless you like somewhat bland mashed potatoes with beef chunks, then I suppose it might be a FOUR STAR.

I agree with many of the other reviewers that this DOES need spiced up.  I, too, tried the stewed tomatoes, sage, rosemary, thyme, bay leaves and worcestershire sauce.

After those rather major modifications, I still cannot give this recipe a FIVE because, putting the potatoes in when instructed, I ended up with "tastier mashed potatoes with beef chunks".

Being new to cooking stews, I had no idea that the two hour time would be excessive for potatoes.  Everyone I've talked to since, including good old mother, said they normally add potatoes the last half hour or so of simmering.   Which, makes sense since at about a half hour into the two hours, I got a bit nervous when the potatoes were done, but the carrots were not... AND the flavor had not had enough time to cook into the stew.

Since I'm a novice chef and am more apt to "go by the book" rather than invent ideas on my own, I'd request anyone who got the PERFECT combination of spices and time frames together to improve upon this recipe to create a brand new (and improved) entry on this site.

Like many of the reviewers here, I followed OLIVERCADO's reccomendations (sort by most useful to see his review) and made some adjustments of my own to create this delicious stew. These are the changes I made:

1) From Olivercado: I increased the salt to 3 tsps, and reduced the pepper to 1/2 tsp. I added thyme and sage, but I used 1 tsp each of dried herbs instead of fresh (I omitted the Rosemary). I added 2 bay leaves, 2 TBS worchestershire sauce, and a can of tomatoes, although the ones I had on hand were diced and seasoned with garlic instead of crushed.
2) I cut up a cross rib roast for this dish and so I had about 2.5 lbs instead of 2.
3) I cooked this in the crock pot, having browned the meat and onion first. I cooked on high for 2 hours then reduced the heat to low for about 4 more hours. 
4) Because I was using a slow cooker, I reduced the liquid. I added only a cup of beef broth, and a cup of chablis blanc. I usually use red wines or burgandy in beef dishes, but the chablis turned out well giving the finished stew a rich mellow flavor.
5) I used about 5 medium potatoes instead of 6 large. I used a whole chopped yellow onion instead of 12 boiling onions, I used 1/2 lb of prepared (bagged) baby carrots.

The stew was rich and flavorful and the consistency just right--no need to thicken. I will definitely make this again although I will probably increase the dried spices to 1 1/2-2 tsps. each and add some green beans. Yum.

Turned out great, however, I did do the following:
#1. Added bay leaf, crushed garlic, oregano & thyme.
#2. Do not add the potatoes, carrots and celery until 40 minutes before stew to be done. Bring stew back up to boil, add vegetables, then reduce heat back to low, cover and cook the additional 40 minutes until veggies are done.
#3. Like all stews, let sit for at least 1/2 hour before serving. Bon Appetit!

I have tried many different recipes from allrecipes.com and this is the first one I've just HAD to review. It was awesome! I used 6 cups of water with 6 beef boullion cubes instead of canned broth. I also added a splash of marsala wine and a splash of worcestershire sauce. This was absolutely delicous and will be a lifetime keeper.

Ok, so I read the reviews prior to making this and I think it didn't work too well for us.  I was sure that if I followed the recipe to the T, it would be bland (no seasonings whatsoever).  Anyhow, I would agree to add more seasonings to this (thyme, rosemary, sage and bay leaf), but the suggestion of worchestire sauce and tomato sauce really killed it for us.  Didn't taste like stew we're used to at least.  Next time, I'm skipping the tomato sauce and worchestire and I'm sure it'll work out better for us.

I followed some of the other review tips and added two more teaspoons of salt and cut the pepper in half.  I added 2 tsp. of paprika to the flour mixture as well.  I also added a pinch of tarragon, thyme, rosemary, sage, two bay leaves and 1 cup of tomato sauce (my kids don't like tomatos and it makes a wonderful color).  I threw the potatos, carrots and celery in at the beginning and simmered for two hours and it was VERY tender and delicious. I added another can of beef broth to cover the potatos.  Maybe my potatos are bigger :)!  Thanks for a wonderfully tasty and easy recipe.

Great tasting.  This made more than I thought.  But the left overs are great.  I added some frozen peas near the end of cooking.  I'll do this again.

I added a can of diced tomatoes, rosemary and a bay leaf.  I also added more salt.  I browned the meat & onion and then put everything in a slow cooker.  I put the carrots and potatoes in for the last 3 hours.  The last half hour I added peas.

Excellent Stew! I've been cooking variations of stew for several years and added a few of my favorite ingredients to this recipe.  I used a diced yellow onion in place of boiling onions, and eliminated the celery due to personal preference. I added a can of Italian seasoned tomatoes, 2 bay leaves, and 2 tsp. paprika. I thickened with cornstarch in place of flour; and added salt to taste at the end.  My picky husband said it was the best stew he'd ever eaten. Great recipe with some very minor changes!

I thought that this recipe was delicious and so did my family. I did make a few adjustments though. I used my crockpot so I browned the meat in a skillet and when that was done I browned the onions and celery in the same skillet and scraped the pan real well to get all of the drippings. I let it cook all day on low THEN for the last half hour or so I turned it up to high and added the potatos and carrots so they wouldn't get too mushy.Also I seasoned the meat and veggies all separately while using low sodium broth. The taste was wonderful last night and I can't wait to taste it today at lunch!

This is the best beef stew I've ever had! Sometimes beef stew can be kind of bland.  I did use most of OLIVERCADO's suggestions (search reviews and sort by most helpful).  I used 2 tsp of salt and about 3/4 tsp of pepper.  I also added 1 tsp of sage, 2 tsp of parika, and a pinch of dried rosemary to the ziploc bag and tossed the meat in the spices. When cooking the meat, I added 2 tbls of Worchestire sauce.  I browned the meat and onions (whole), and put everything (except the potatoes) in my crock pot at 9:00 this morning.  Put the meat on bottom of the celery and carrots on top. I threw in the potatoes the last 4 hours.  I cooked the stew on low most of the time and high for about an hour or so towards the end.  I used all of the beef broth required in the recipe, and it was perfect.  I did not add the flour and water at the end.  My husband and I truly loved this on a cold winter day.  We had cheese biscuits with it (Cheddar Bay Biscuits, also on this site).:-)  This is a new favorite!
PS. I added a photo because I agree with others that the original picture almost made me not want to make this recipe.  It looks like regular beef stew. I hope the updated picture helps!

Very good but I changed it SLIGHLY. I used a large 1 gallon ziplock bag, which allowed me to coat all my beef cubes at once and I browned them in the oil WITH the onions. Once browned, I transfered all to a roaster where I added all the veggies stated.  I used 1 can cream of mushroom soup and filled the can with the beef broth and mixed before pouring it over all (dumped it in & then added a LITTLE water...not much). I baked at 350 degrees for about 1-1 1/2hrs. VERY GOOD! Veggies and meat had great taste and we all enjoyed this one. Would make again. Its a easy recipe to prepare in the roaster ahead of time and when you get home, bake! Thanks Margo!

My first beef stew ever and it was fabulous.  I took a lot of people's suggestions and would say that by following OLIVERCADO's comments (the one with over 20 "helpful ratings") as a primary guide it was perfect. However, 2 LBS of meat is NOT enough for 12 servings (think about it, that's 2.6 OZ per serving).  This recipe could very well sustain another pound of meat (adjust flour dredging mixture accordingly) with leaving all veggies and liquid in tact.  I used a beef bouillon paste called "Better than Bouillon" which was just right at 6 cups water/6 tsp. of paste.  I did add a 16 oz bag of baby carrots instead of the sliced carrots the recipe called for which made it easier and used dried spices vs. fresh.  It was KILLER.  I promise.

Excellent recipe! My jaw hit the floor when my 8 year old got up for seconds. I did as the others suggested and added 1 can of diced tomatoes, Thyme, Rosemary, sage and instead of garlic powder I used real garlic. I didnt have any Worcestershire sauce, so I used a combo of soy sauce and hp sauce. Thanks!!! :)

My wife requested stew for supper so we tried this recipe.  It was fantastic!  We added peas to the recipe and browned the meat in a Wok but other than that we followed the recipe to the letter.  We will be eating this one well into the future!
Thanks!

I have searched for a good beef stew recipe for what seems like forever. This is it. This stew is excellent. I had more compliments on this than I have had on anything I've cooked in a long time. If I could give it more than 5 stars I would. Great recipe,Margo! Thanks

I thought it was great.  I put too much flour in it though to thicken it up.  When it cooled I had a block of stew.  Try not to make that mistake or you'll never be able to reheat the leftovers!!

This beef stew is very good.  I will say I am not a big fan of stew meat and used sirlion beef tips instead. I did not have boiling onions so i used a whole onion cut up.  I also add a few tsp of gravy master for some additional flavor and two bay leafs.  I add the vegetables and potato at the last hour or so of cooking.  Freezes very well too.

This recipe is good to give you an idea of how to make Beef Stew.  I had to make several altercations to this, as to just looking at the ingredients showed it to be a bland recipe.

Alterations I used that made this a hit all around. 

I increased the garlic powder used, to nearly triple. Used the salt and pepper to own preferential tastes.  I dredged the meat as intstructed, but in the oil I'd minced up about 3 cloves of fresh garlic.  After the meat was done, I added in another clove of minced garlic, and quickly seasoned/fried up the celery/carrots/I used 2 medium onions opposed to boiling ones/potatoes.  You don't do this very long, you want the veggies a bit browned, seasonsed and coated.  I put the 3 cups of broth in a sauce pan and brought it to a boil with 2 cloves of minced garlic inside the broth.  I also added about a half teaspoon of each Italian herbs, Rosemary, Thyme and Oregano.  Boiled the meat and broth for 45 minutes, then I added 1/2 cup white wine and the vegetables we'd sauteed earlier.  Brought it all to a boil, simmered for 30 minutes.  I found no need to add any other fluids/flours to thicken or thin this recipe.

Terrific recipe!  I read through some of the comments and found one indicating the potatoes she used "broke down" while cooking.  This is due to the variety of potato used.  Make sure you use Russet Burbank potatoes - specifically Burbanks.  Other varieties of potatoes such as Russet Norkotahs, have lower solids (potatoes are mostly water) which causes the potato to break down and turn mushy.  Great recipe!  It's a keeper!!

I'm sorry but this was a bit bland, and the vegetable came out like mush.  It was not hearty and flavorful as I was expecting.  I will have to put up another great recipe that I have that will blow this one out of the water...

This was really great! I used sirloin stew meat and it was extremely tender.

It was nothing but meat flavored potato mush. Then I made it again using the most popular modifications, and it was delicious. Maybe a bit too much rosemary.

I fixed this last night, and made some of my own changes.   I ALWAYS add mustard to a beef that I am going to brown first just because it is a meat tenderizer.  Then I roll it in the seasoned flour and turned it on high to brown.  NEVER NEVER would I add potatoes until the last 20-30 min. because I want a potatoe to stand on it's own and not be mush.   It's like making a cake, why would you just add water when water has no flavor? you add milk.  The potatoes have no flavor because they have turned to mush.  I also added a can of peas at the end.   This is a recipe that has potential, but you just have to play with it and make it your own.
Happy cooking everybody!

This recipe is lacking in several key areas:  lack of adequate seasoning, adding the vegetables wayyyy too early in the cooking time (stew should be simmered 1-2 hrs until meat is tender, then potatoes and onions added for last 35-40 minutes).  You can read a lot of the reviews to make the needed improvements (see olivercado and happyapple) but know that this recipe is woefully inadequate as submitted.

Heavenly! I use this recipe to prepare my pot roasts, too, by tossing the entire roast in the recipe's flour/garlic mixture, then browning it before adding the side veggies (whole potatoes and carrots) and broth. Then I leave the entire deal in my crockpot all day, and the resulting roast is THE best roast we've ever had!

I added a lot more seasonings to the flour and beef in the bag.  I added garlic powder, celery seed, pepper, &salt.  I also added 3 bay leaves to the simmering pot.  You can add any spices to the floyr to give the a very hdown home flavor.  TY for this basic recipe :)

I'd never made beef stew before and found this recipe to be easy and very good. I added some onion powder to the flour mixture and used the pearl onions for ease. As others said, it didn't take the full amount of time to be finished cooking. I was thinking of tossing in some limas or peas next time.  Excellent recipe!

What a disappointment after the 5 star build up. It is a technical start with good proportions of meat and veggie, but there is nothing to make it yummy.  If you read the reviews you will see that the people who loved it added all their favorite seasonings, sauces etc. If you feel comfortable doing that, just improvise with amounts of meat you have and veggies you like. You really don't even need this recipe. Did anyone mention that mixing 3T flour and 1T cold water makes a biscuit dough consistency which is a crazy way to thicken a liquid unless lumps are the way you like it. Add enough water to make a pourable consistency.

The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because it needed some flavor -- I added 1 tsp each of rosemary, thyme, and sage, and then it was perfect! I did add the 3 tbsp of flour/water mixture to thicken it up and it was the perfect consistency. Reminded me of the kind of stew my mom used to make! Excellent w/buttermilk biscuits.

This isn't normally my favorite type of food, but my little boy read about a boy eating stew in a book and really wanted to try it.  It is easy and a good basic recipe without too many odd flavors that might throw off a child or picky eater.  He ate 2 bowls of it, so looks like it was a winner.  I did season as I went along since the potatoes seem to absorb a lot of flavor when they go in.  I left the potatoes and carrots out until the last 35min or so like others have suggested and their texture was perfect.

I changed this recipe around a bit and came up with a wonderful savory dish!  I used beef tips instead of Beef Chuck.  I rolled it into flour mixed /w salt and pepper, browned it in 2 tbsp oil.  I added a can of tomato paste with the broth.  I added 3 tbsp Worcesteshire sauce.  I also added a pinch or two of Rosemary and a half clove of garlic.  This turned out so well!!

Bland plus watery stew.  My family did not like how it looked and when they tasted it they told me never to make the recipe again.  They gave it the thumbs down.  Me too.

The recipe was easy to follow and it was a big hit in my house!! I only had to make a few minor changes which were: 2 bay leaves, 1 can crushed tomatoes, 2 Tbsp. Worsteshire sauce and 2 Tbsp. Sherry. Also, when I make the next time I won't add quite as much broth - I had to take some of the liquid out & add flour to it and then dump back in to thicken. I made in the crock pot and it took 6-8 hours but was well worth the wait. Highly recommend.

This recipe is wonderful!  I've never made beef stew before and was kind of worried that it would taste horrible!  Boy was I wrong.  The recipe was easy to follow and everyone loved it.  You can also brown the meat and then throw everything in a crock pot on high for about 1-2 hrs if you need to leave while its cooking.

I doubled the recipe and served the whole, big, hungry family, and still have enough for leftovers for dinner tonight.  Next time I will use a little less pepper, but it was still quite tasty.  Be sure you have a lot of fresh bread to serve with it!

I brought this stew to my parent's house one Sunday for dinner and everyone thought it was great (even my 12 year old daughter who isn't fond of stew said it was good).  The second time I made it I was short one can of beef broth so instead I added 10 ounces of water with a package of Lipton Dry Onion soup Mix.  My family ate it and then I sent some home to my parents.  We all agreed it was even better the second time!  I FORGOT TO MENTION that both times I added a large drained can of "small" peas the last 10 minutes to warm them up in the stew.  This is definitely a keeper (first one I have tried, first one I have reviewed, and first one in my recipe box)!!!

We were in the mood for a stew the way "MeMaw" used to make.  Pretty close!  Depending on your taste, you might want to add extra seasoning.  We also found the beef broth to have a slight after taste, so will probably dilute the broth with water next time.  Overall a great stew!

Wonderful aroma while simmering! Upon others suggestion, I added a splash of worcesire (sp?) sauce, some rosemary, thyme, bay leaves, garlic, and a big tomato. I'm not usually a fan of anything with meat in it, but the meat in this came out so tender and flavorful, it was a hit! Will definitely make again. :)(Would give it the extra star, but without the added spices, I think it may have come out a bit bland)

I made this for a friend going through chemo. She eats very little. I called her later and she told me it was so good she ate 2-1/2 bowls! I simmered the browned beef in beef broth along with some V8 & a few bay leaves. Added the onions when they were softened. Let this simmer for a couple of hours or until meat was tender. Then added potatoes, carrots, celery, green beans, corn, tomatoes and peas and let them simmer for an hour or so. There's a lot of nutrition in this recipe and it tastes great! My friend's review was so great, I made another pot for my family. Yummy! We had a nice meal waiting for us after we were done with the yard work. I just stirred it every half hour or so. Delicious!

While I browned the meat, I brought two cans of beef broth to a boil. I removed the meat after it had a nice crust and deglazed the pan with a cup of burgundy wine. Then the beef, broth and wine went into the crock pot with a few bay leaves.

The only other change I made was to include some fresh green beans when I added the vegetables. Delicious.

When I first read the recipe, I thought it sounded good, but then saw the photo posted and really wondered if it would be good (photo looked like dog slop).  So I pushed the picture to the back of my mind, and proceeded to make the stew. I browned the stew meat in EVOO and then from that point, finished the stew in the slow cooker. I did make some changes,  I left out the onions and celery.  I also added some Emeril's essence to give the stew some kick, it was very good - almost avoided this one, simply b/c of the picture posted.

I used a combination of this recipe and another recipe from this site. I did use the flour mixture to bread the meat but added 1/2 tsp. of cayenne pepper for an extra kick. I didn't have 3 cans of broth so I used 2 beef stock cubes, 2 cups of water and 1 can of broth with 1 can of water. I also used chopped white onion because that's all I had and added a pinch of thyme and 3 bay leaves. Actually it was thick enough after about an hour that I didn't add anything at the end for thickening. My husband loved it and thanked me for the great meal!

It was a nice basic recipe.  I cut the potatoes in big chunks and left the skins on so they would get too mushy.  I used a ziploc bag to evenly coat the meat with flour and herbs.  I also added cooking sherry.  Oh, and I added a bit of tomato paste for flavor.  Nice basics but this recipe needs some flavor.

So...I halved the recipe and used water/bouillon instead of canned broth cuz it was all I had...and I added more liquid than was called for because it made me nervous that everything wasn't submersed.  By the time 2 hours was up, the stew was a little bland (which probably had something to do with the extra water I added) so I ended up adding salt (regular and seasoned), pepper, thyme, and garlic powder.  I also added some frozen peas, and used red potatoes (skin on).  I thought it was a very tasty stew.  It honestly wasn't what I was expecting from an "old fashioned" stew, but I'm sure I'll still make this again.

Good basic recipe - the only changes I make are to add  a bay leaf, 1 tbsp worcestershire sauce, 1 tsp sugar, fresh garlic, mushrooms, turnips and some frozen peas at the end.  I have made this both in the slow cooker and on the stove.  Always turns out great.  Thanks!

It hasn't been mentioned that cooking the potatoes for two hours makes them fall apart and become practically non-existant.  I suppose that what helps thicken the gravy. Even though I turned the burner on low, it was bubbling away under the lid so I had to stir it often.   I really like chunky potatoes in my stew so getting to the point...this is a good recipe and I like the flavors.  It is what basic old fashioned stew is supposed to taste like...no worcestershire sauce or tomato sauce.  Next time, I'm going to follow the directions precisely except add the potatoes 1/2 hour before the stew is to be done so that the stew will be chunky.  I realize that might effect the thickness of the gravy so I'll add the flour, water mix at the end too (which I didn't need to do because it was already so thick this time).  Cooking the meat for so long makes the meat very tender.

SUPER yummy but I made A LOT of changes because I read all of the reviews.  I made 1/2 recipe.  I added cayenne pepper to the beef coating and 1/2 teaspoon more black pepper.  I used 2 cans of beef broth instead of 1 1/2, and I added 1 1/2 bottles of Coronita (little Corona).  I used one huge yellow onion instead of the boiling onions.  I also added two packets of Mrs. Washington's seasoning (sort of like boullion).  In addition, I added 1/2 teaspoon each of dried rosemary, thyme and parsley.  Overall it was SUPER good!  My boyfriend and I both thought it needed extra salt and a lot more pepper. THREE DAYS LATER:  I recommend making half a recipe and eating it that night.

I thought this was a really great stew.  I followed the advice of the others and added the potatoes and celery half way through, but I should have done the same with the onions because they were nowhere to be seen by the end. The carrots were perfect being put in from the beginning. Also added a few squirts of ketchup and some worcestershire sauce. Delish!

Awesome, and easy to make.  Used comments from others, in adding the extra spices, worcestershire, oregano, bay leaf, and putting the vegetables in about 1/2 hour later so the meat can get really tender.

What a wonderful stew recipe! I substituted 1C dark beer for 1C broth and added 1 Tbsp worcestershire. I waited until the last 40 minutes to add the potatos, celery and carrots and then added 1 bay leaf, thyme and oregano. It was a big hit and smelled great while it was cooking.

Some of the best beef stew I have had in a while, a long while.  Hearty beef flavor, seasoned just right.  Took me back to a time when Mom served the stew up by the wood heater and the heater, the stew, and family made everything OK.

Wonderful fragrance running through the house. I added a can of diced tomatoes and a sprinkling of Thyme. Also used only one very large potato. Six seems excessive.  Will be serving this tomorrow but it tastes great now. Will be served over broad noodles.

I made this stew tonight for dinner.  My family thought it was the best beef stew they ever had. The stew was very flavorful and hearty.  I added mushrooms and used some water in place of the beef broth since I only had one can.  The stew was still excellent! I will definitely be using this recipe from now on every time I make stew!

Delicious beef stew! Better than the crock pot version I make. I followed the first step as written. I heated olive oil and browned up the meat, I set the meat aside and chopped a whole onion and sautéed with 2 tbs of unsalted butter, to that I added about 1 tsp of crushed red pepper flakes. I added 5 chopped carrots and 3 chopped celery to the pot and sautéed for 1 min. Then I added 2 1/2 cups water and 2 tbs beef bouillon, I seasoned with a few sprinkles of thyme and 2 bay leafs and a few splashes of worchestire sauce, I added the beef and covered for 1 hour, then I added 2 chopped potatoes and finished cooking for 40 min. I let the beef stew rest for 30 min. It was so good it barely needed salt! I served it with brown rice. YUM!

My 7 year old devoured a huge bowl of this and then asked for more.  I have never in my life seen my daughter eat beef this quickly and then ask for more.  That in and of itself earns 5 stars.  I did make some tweaks to the recipe, based on some dietary restrictions for our family.  We can't have starchy foods, so omitted the potatoes and flour.  I also used just a regular large purple onion and only 3 carrots and 3 celery stalks.  I didn't have chuck on hand, but had some thick sirloin (which we tend to like the taste of sirloin in stews better than chuck anyhow).  Used 2 cups of homemade chicken broth.  I didn't mess with the stove, just threw the ingredients into the crock pot.  I was leery of using so much garlic powder (especially since the powder I have is very potent, fresh from a garlic farm), but went with the seasonings as noted and hoped for the best.  I think I could have decreased the garlic, salt and pepper just a tiny bit (all 3 of us were drinking lots of water the rest of the evening).  I was also wondering if just those 3 seasoning ingredients would be enough flavor.  But it was really, really delicious.  We had NO leftovers!  Two adults and a 7 year old ate the entire pot of stew in one meal.  And my husband and daughter wanted to know when I was going to make this again.

This is terrible. I questioned simmering vegs along with the meat for 2 hours .  This a given that mush will develop. Who ever heard of cooking potates and carrots for hours! Well, I did and should never have done so. Go with your gut feel.  After 45 min,. I picked the meat out and am simmering it alone for another 2 hours and then will put the remaining t mush with it to try to salvage it.  Read the negative reviews before attempting this awful, bland, mushy mess.

Okay, this is going to be one of those crazy reviews that is probably going to show up on the buzz.  I did not have any onions, celery, or beef broth.  I lightly coated the beef in flour and browned it in hot oil.  I don't know what happend while the beef was cooking, but the flour began to fluff up.  I used all purpose flour.  So I had to take the beef out of the pan.  Being tight on money, I could not throw the beef away so I got out my collander and washed the fluff off.  I placed it back in the pan and continued to brown.  Then I realized that I had no beef broth and no cubes to make broth out of.  So, I had just frozen some pot roast and gravy.  So I got out the gravy and placed it in the pot.  It was delish!!  So, needless to say this recipe is disaster and idiot proof!!

Just awesome! I followed all the reviews and added 2 tsps more salt, plus 1 tsp thyme and 1 tsp sage.  I only used a small can of tomatoes and will use a large can next time.  Didn't add the rosemary as my family is not fond of it.  Will definitely make again!

I made my own variation. I used canned potatoes, canned mushrooms, baby carrots chopped up and boiled and regular onion ½ of one is good.  Turnips or squash chunks would be an idea to add in too. No celery. I also added a cup of water while cooking so it wasn’t as thick. It may have been the water added but taste after everything is cooked, it was a tiny bit bland, but still good, nothing a little salt can’t fix!

I was looking for a good basic recipe that I didn't have to put into the oven and this is the perfect base. I added some stewed tomatoes and the served it with egg noodles or with perogies. It was excellent!

Very simple recipe and very similar to the stew that I grew up with. I like it a lot. If you like a lot of herbs and what not then you will have to add that. I gave it 4 stars for what was there. I did not give it five because I added a few things to suit my tastes.

Excellent base recipe! This is just what I was looking for: A thick hearty soup with tender beef stew meat. I make beef stew a lot in the crock pot, but have never liked the meat because it was tough. I was searching for a recipe that gave me tender meat and this was it! Wow! I did add more seasonings, but the overall I followed the recipe to the letter. It is well written and easy to follow! I love it! If you are looking for a tender beef stew recipe that your whole family will love; give this a try!

Awesome stew- perfect for a rainy day! I added salt and fresh herbs to spice it up a bit more. Also added a few bay leaves and substituted some of the beef broth with an oatmeal stout. The beef got sooo tender it was delicious! I've made this a few times now it is a favorite for sure!

I agree with other reviews, this makes a good "base" but isn't exactly what I would consider enough to make a tasty stew.  I took the advice of others and added a sprinkle of Worchestshire sauce.  I made the mistake of adding too much of the water/flour thickener so it was a bit too thick but just added a bit of water to thin it.  I really didn't care for the garlic powder.  But, this is more if a personal choice, I rarely use it in any of my cooking.  Next time I will use a bit of Garlic salt and then just season the rest with salt and pepper.  I added the potatoes toward the end but it was still too much time and they were a bit mushy but not bad.  Next time I will add toward the last 15-20 minutes of cooking.  Overall, it was good but I gave it 3 stars for the blandness.

First I have to tell you-I have never even dreamed of making beef stew. This was DELICIOUS! I can't believe how easy it is to make stew. I really love that it's cooked on the stove instead of a slow cooker cause I was craving it now!  My changes: precut LEAN stew beef; I used steak seasoning instead of garlic, salt and pepper; used 1/2 c cooked barley added at the end instead of potatoes; and probably used more broth-I didn't measure, just added till covered; and I didn't have to add any flour at the end, the gravy was thick the whole time it cooked. YUMMY! One more thing, I tried to used crisco butter spray instead of oil, but no sizzle of the meat, so then I used the oil and voila! So I wonder if this is why it tasted buttery once it was done? That is fine with me though. And maybe I will add peas to it next time.  I will definitely make this again!

Very good.  I added a little kitchen bouquet to darken the gravy to be more appealing and served over biscuits.  Kids and adults loved it.

Not bad, but not the most fantastic Beef Stew I've made.  Needed extra salt and seasoning, as well as tomato sauce and a few TBSP of Worshershire sauce.

UBER YUMMY.  We don't eat beef often, but when we do, we like the traditional recipes and let me tell you, this one hit the spot!  All I added was a bit of meat tenderizer to the flour mixture, then followed the recipe in every other detail.  What a lovely winter meal!  Thanks Angel!

I followed this recipe pretty much as it was.  The only change I made was that I used chicken stock instead of beef stock because that was what I had.  Even with the chicken stock, it turned out really good.  It had a lot more flavor than it looked like it might.  My youngest son told me it was the best stew he ever tasted and asked if I'd make again the next night.

I love this recipe! It's really simple but so delicious! Every time another blizzard hits, I make another pot it. I even raved about it to the family and made some for them, when I visited home this past winter. They loved it! The smell from the kitchen is incredible, and I have the hardest time keeping my fingers out of the beef, while I'm preparing it. Thanks for this great recipe! This one's a keeper!

This is a beef stew that my 16year old babysitter, who hates MEAT and ALL VEGGIES can eat TWO CUPS of! This is a beef stew that my 3 and 4 year old will eat and ask for seconds...veggies and all!!  I highly recommend trying to use less beef broth (add a tablespoon of beef broth powder) and 2 10oz cans of crushed tomatoes!!! wow..flavor EXPLOSION! a MUST eat in this house!

This was a good starting point for beef stew.  I started cooking at 9 am, so the meat was super tender by 3, when we ate it.  I added 1 small can of v8, 1 tsp sage, 2 bay leaves, 3 dashes worcestershire sauce, 1 1/2 tsp minced garlic, 1/2 tsp dried rosemary, about 2 tsp more salt, and a little more pepper.  As another reviewer suggested, I added about 2 tsp paprika to the flour for dredging. I added my potatoes about 1 hr before the stew was done.  I also added a can of sweet peas.  As my stew was cooking, it was pretty greasy looking, though it seemed to look better after I added the potatoes.  Next time I will cut some of the fat off of the meat.  The stew turned out pretty darn good, but I made many alterations.

This recipe is good, but here's a few notes.  When I browned the beef, I had to turn up the heat (to full high, not med/high) because it wasn't browning well.  To the stew I added some italian seasoning, chili flakes, bay leaves and 2 cans of diced tomatoes. Due to other reviews I waited 1 hour before putting the potatoes in, so they were only in for an hour-- not a good idea.  The potatoes didn't come up "stew-like" and were a little too firm.  It's probably best to put them a half hour in or maybe just at the beginning like the recipe instructs.  Since I put in the tomatoes, the recipe made almost a full 8qt pot of stew.  It was good, but will make few more tweaks next time.

Absolutely wonderful beef stew recipe. Have made it a few times and comes out perfect every time.  I buy chuck and cut it up myself. I brown the meat before hand in olive oil instead of vegie oil and wouldn't recommend skipping this step. I think it makes the meat more tender and gives it better flavor. This last time I cooked it for 7 hours in my crock pot. The first 5 were on High with the last 2 on low. I use Minor's Beef base instead of canned stock. I think it has excellent flavor and doesn't taste near as salty as other stocks. I cooked that with the meat for 2 hours and then added chunks of potatoes with the skin on and baby carrots cut in half. I used a yellow onion diced instead of boiling onions. The onions weren't even noticeable and   there were big chunks of potatoes as well as small pieces of potatoes since I cut them in various sizes. I did not add the water and flour mixture at the end and my stew always comes out nice and hearty. Makes fabulous left overs! I do not care for beef stews with tomato in it and this stew is perfect! It kind of reminds me of Dinty Moore beef stew, if you have ever had that. Oh, and I also add 3-4 cloves of garlic pressed in my garlic press. YUM!! Thanks for sharing! This is my perfect stew!! Even my oh so very picky eater will eat this!!

I wanted to try a new beef stew recipe so I tried this one.  I did not enjoy the taste of this stew while I was making it (a little too bland.) I added two bay leaves and 1/2 bottle of beer to add taste.  It did help, but I think I'll stick with my old recipe.

This was a very easy and tasty stew. I loved the small onions which were so tender and sweet. Instead of cut potatoes, I used small nugget potatoes in their skins which prevents the potatoes from turning to mush while still having the potatoes in small bite size. Thank you for sharing this lovely recipe!.

Great recipe but a little bland so I added rosemary, thyme, garlic powder and some beef bouillon granules.  I also only added in half the potatoes from the start and then the other half about 30 minutes before it was done, so I would have chunky potato pieces.  The thickening mixture of flour and water results in balls of flour in the stew but it does work.  It killed the flavor of the stew a bit but just add more spices after that.  I also added in a tablespoon of Dijon mustard for kicks as well, along with mushrooms.  Instead of boiling onions, I used one regular chopped onion.  I'd recommend just adding whatever veggies you like!

Way too bland, but a great start. I added lots of crushed garlic, wine, soy sauce, bay leaf and rosemary. I cooked it in a slow cooker on low for hours, as the 2-hour boiling time provided would have ruined the potatoes. I also, near the end, left the lid off the cooker in order to reduce the amount of liquid. The flour/water mixture provided would make the stew taste just like flour especially since the flour to water ratio given would leave chunky bits of flour in your stew. Eventually, with lots of tinkering, my stew turned out great. Had to give this a one rating, since when I was finished, it was no where near "Angel's Old Fashioned Beef Stew".

This recipe is very close to the one I have used for years, however, I substitute 1 can of tomato sauce, then fill the same can with approx. 3/4 water, a pinch of sugar and let it cook.  Same great taste with a tomato based sauce. Delicious recipe!

I have been making this recipe for about a year now.  Adding the vegetables in at the end is key, because the longer it simmers, the better it is and they will get mushy.  I also add fresh green beans and add gravy master to give it extra dimension, and a more robust flavor.  Using a high quality beef stock (or homemade) makes all the difference in the world.  Another tip:  Salt your beef after frying with kosher salt immediately.  It adds all the extra spice needed.  It freezes great too, so make extra!

This is an excellent stew. Instead of the small onions I just used one diced medium onion and it worked perfectly fine. I think next time I may add a couple dashes of worchestershire sauce to give it a little more zip.

I thought this was a great recipe and will certainly make this again.  I doubled the meat (we like alot of meat) and next time would also add 1 more can of beef broth.  This is also good if you are trying to stretch a meal by putting plain (already cooked) white rice on the bottom of your bowl and then poor some stew on top.  Yummy!!!!!
Thank you -

This beef stew is an excellent starter stew!  I added my own special touch to make it the best stew I've ever had! I added meat tenderizer and seasoned salt to the flour mixture.  I cooked my meat in kitchen bouquet and worchestershire sauce along with the oil.  I also used chopped onion instead of whole small onions. Along with ingredients listed on recipe, I added a half bag of frozen peas and a bag of frozen corn.  For extra flavor I added a can of tomato soup, and used 5 beef boullion cubes instead of the beef broth in a can.  Then I added some louisiana hot sauce and sprinkled in some brown sugar to top it off!!  It was Mmmmm MMMmmmmm GOOD!!!  Hope this helps!

This is a GREAT stew! I got rave reviews from my fiance about it. I did use the comments given by OLIVERCADO, and made quite a few additions of my own, including fresh sliced mushrooms, frozen green beans, and frozen whole kernel corn. During the browning of the meat (I used sirloin steak) I included minced garlic and Kitchen Bouquet, which helped to later a create a thick, rich base. I also used frozen vegetables (sliced carrots, seasoning blend) except for one yellow onion and the potatoes, of which I used only 4 medium sized. I added them with 45 minutes of cooking time left. Instead of broth I used beef boullion, and I had to kick the seasonings up quite a bit to suit our tastes. Nevertheless, for a first time stew maker, this recipe was a huge success! We will definitely have it again and again!

This was just delicious.  I was a little nervous about browning the meat since I never have good luck at that, but I used one reviewer's suggestion and used a wok.  I will never brown meat in a pan again!  It cooked slowly and made a nice crust on the meat - what a great smell!!  I put mine in a slow cooker and used a cornstarch mixture to thicken it to my liking at the end.  I also added 4 tbsp of worches. sauce and 1/4 cup of red wine - what a great dinner - thanks!!

This was just plain old cold night terrific comfort stew! I read the reviews and added, thyme, rosemary, worchester, a can of diced tomatoes and towards the end a splash of sherry. As my Dad would say, "It tastes like more"

I really loved this recipe.  I am not much of a cook but I was able to make this and it came out great. It did take some time browning the meat but the next time I think I will do it in a wok.  I also did double the salt and then it was perfect!!! I will make this again and again.

This is dee-lish!  Seems not alot of people have beef broth, myself included so I used water and boullion as well.  I added a can of mushrooms with liquid while cooking and at the end just prior to serving, a can of mushroom soup for flavour and thickening. mmmmmmmm thank you!

I really did not like this recipe. The recipe is very basic, so I thought maybe something simple would taste great. 

After we made it, it had a very strong celery taste that I didn't like. There was nothing special about it. We had a pot of pretty bland stew. Ended up adding some wine, pepper, and more spices to get this to be edible.

A very tasty, traditional-style stew. I'd never made beef stew before & I had no problems getting it to turn out. This recipes also lends itself to additions...different veggies, a can of diced tomatoes, etc.

I had my mother over for dinner last night and I made this, She is VERY picky when it comes to food.  She loved it, as did my Hubby and Kids.  They couldn't believe I made it. I had to show them the recipe to prove it!  My mother said it was better than those canned stews.  and wants to come over next time I make it, and she'll bring her friend!!!

My daughter asked me to make stew "like Grama used to make" and this recipe did the trick. My mother was a big fan of herbs and spices but not in her stew.  The only change I made was to use pearl onions I had in the freezer. Thanks, Angel!

I increased servings 50%, and adjusted amounts accordingly except for the carrots, where I added parsnips (a most under-utilized vegetable).  Instead of salt, I used cayenne pepper in the flour mixture.  After removing beef and before cooking onions, I de-glazed with beer, not broth.  Instead of adjusting broth amounts, I used beer.  I've made at least a swimming-pool amount of stew in my life, and this base with my changes is up in the top 5.

This stew was great, but I did make some additions.  First I made 18 servings (3 pounds of stew meat) and and adjusted the rest of the amounts for that.  I did flour and brown the meat which, in the end, was good enough for the thickening.  I simmered the meat with a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes in juice and all ingredients up to the vegetables for 1 hour.  After the hour I added the vegies, but cut down the potatoes to 8 medium sized.  After continuing to simmer for another 30 to 45 minutes I added about 1 cup of frozen peas, thawed, and 1 cup of roasted corn (Trader Joes has it) thawed.  The stew turned out tender, delicious and thick enough -- it actually tasted even better the second day.

This came out great.  It was actually thick enough at the end of cooking.  I really didn't need to thicken it at all!  Thanks for a great - classic stew recipe.

I found this to be a very simple meal.  I cut the pepper down by 1/2.  Leave out the the salt because of the sodium content of most beef broths.  I also bake it coverd for 2+ hours on 300* or untill tender.

Amay-hay-hay-hay-zing!!!! The only thing I did differently was added some canned chopped tomatoes.  My skinny-minny teenaged daughter who eats enough to barely keep a bird alive ate FOUR bowls of this!  We all LOVED it!  I am planning to make more this weekend!  This recipe is a keeper for sure!!!

Really good!  I used beef bouillon cubes instead of the canned beef broth and it still turned out great.  Served with buttery dinner rolls for a very cozy and comforting meal!

This was my first time ever making a stew, and it turned out fine for me. Though the amount was a lot more than I expected even after using tiny potatoes instead of large ones. Though next time I think I'm going to put the veggies in later, because I'm not a fan of soft veggies. Overall I had no problems with this stew and neither did my family, seeing as they went for bowl after bowl, even in the middle of Texas heat :)

I usually like to make my beef stew in the slow cooker. I tried it this way, and it made a wonderful gravy and the veggies were good. I just don't like how tough the meat comes out cooking this way, since it is always so tender when done in a slow cooker. If I were to make this again, I would add more seasonings. Thank you for the recipe!

I followed the basic outline of this recipe but I also incorporated Caroline's(from Buffalo Grove, Il.)suggestions except for the sage and Rosemary. The V8 was a great idea! I also used Knorr bouillon flavor "Costillas de Res"(beef ribs)instead of beef stock. Plain old sliced white onion was all I had on hand but it worked just fine. My family loved it. I also added 1 tsp. chili powder to the flour with the paprika. Added a little zip to the meat. Now, I added the veggies about 20 minutes after the meat, onions and stock. They came out perfect. I did keep their size rather small(maybe that was why I didn't have any under-cooked veggies)about the same size as the meat. Overall, I was happy with this recipe after the tweaks.

This recipe was wonderful. Everyone had seconds. I served it with dinner rolls and egg noodles and it made A LOT of servings. I used the seasonings adobo, complete seasoning, and sage. This is definitely on my "Make again" list.

Good stew.  Followed the recipe, it turned out kinda bland (salt maybe?).  I used my dutch oven to make this, so I started it off on my stove top and finished it in a 300 degree oven for about an hour.  Took it out of the oven and added the flour/water, replaced the lid and let it stand on my stove top until the rest of dinner was ready.  It stayed plenty hot and thickened perfectly.

Very good recipe! My stew came out very tasty, and nice and thick(no need to add any extra flour). I was so happy that it came out so good because I am not the greatest cook. If my family really enjoys something that I've made, it must be good!

I made this recipe as originally written, except I used regular onions cut into pieces, and I added a half-can of peeled chopped tomatoes.  My husband absolutely loved this stew!  I think this was one of his all time favorite meals ever!

Fansastic!  I have tried and failed several times to make an "old fashioned" beef stew.  This one hit the nail on the head.  The only ingredient we added was Merlot.  Yum!  Make on a cold winter day and add some garlic bread for a side.

this was pretty good! did a number of changes though. i used 2 TBL olive oil, 1/4 c flour, 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, salt and pepper, 1 tsp paprika. 2 lbs beef chuck, 1 sweet onion, 3 large potatoes, 3 carrots, 9 white mushrooms, 2 cans beef broth, 2 bay leaves, parsley,  and a 1/2 tsp thyme, rosemary, and sage. i also added 1/4 cup of merlot and a 1/2 tsp of tomato paste.   the meat was very tender, but i would probably add 1 more carrot and more mushrooms. enjoy!

Great basic stew recipe, however your only half way there when you are done.  Definitely add bravy mix to give more flavor and definitely add about a cup of tomato sauce.  About 6 tb of sugar and some salt to taste.  Throw some tobasco in there for kick and you have an awesome rich tasting stew.

This started off a bit bland so I had to spice it up a bit.  I added some thyme, a bay leaf, and some fresh garlic.  It still seemed a bit bland so at the end I added a package of brown gravy which made a richer gravy.  Next time I will add my potatoes the last hour of cooking because alot of them fell apart.  This has potential and was a good base recipe for stew.

I'm rating this based on my modifications.  I used more broth than boullion cubes due to salt control.  I browned the beef in a  skillet, added wine to the beef bits and reducted a bit with some chopped onions, added flour and cooked until starch flavor is gone, added 2 bay leaves, garlic and onion powder, garlic pepper, italian seasoning and put all other ingrediants in a crock pot for 5 hrs on low.  Delish.

Cooks up very nice.  Instead of beef broth, use dark beer and your favorite herbs for flavor.  The original recipe was very bland for my taste.  Also, the dish needs a little salt itself, not just in the meat before you brown it.  Give it a try and make adjustments as you need to.

My husband and I both enjoyed this hearty stew very much. The only altering I did was to cut the recipe in half, but still use 2 cans of beef broth. Wonderful, simple, tasty dish. Thanks for sharing!

We loved this.  It really needs a bayleaf or two (I used two).  I simmered the meat for about an hour on its own before adding the other veggies, since stew meat needs at least three hours to soften to "falling apart tender" which is the way we like it.  I also used two large yellow onions instead of the 12 boiling onions this recipe calls for, and red potatoes with skin instead of russets since they hold up better.  I would recommend, however, that you opt for a low sodium broth, like the kind from Swansons, because even though I love salt, I had to add a bit of sugar at the end to cut the saltiness.  All in all, a five star recipe that just needs some minor tweaking, but a GREAT starting point!

Great basic stew recipe. I used beef bouillon cubes because canned beef broth just isn't beefy enough, and also added a little Bisto gravy granules for flavor and to thicken the gravy. I don't know what boiling onions are (shallots??) so I just used regular onions cut into chunks so that they wouldn't simmer away to nothing (I recommend adding the veggies in the last half hour of cooking so they don't turn to mush). I also added a splash of red wine just before serving. Very good!

This stew is to die for!!!  This recipe is a permanent addition to my collection.  I changed a few things here and there to suit our own personal taste, but that is all.  I cut the potatoes and beef on the Larger side of bite-size, because my husband loves the chunkiness.  Thank you Margo!

This is a great recipe I tweaked a couple of things like after browning meat I added broth and added the left over flour mixture then added ingred.  also spiced it up a bit just for my personal taste.  My husband said it was the best and even better then the one his mom made growing up.  This was the first beef stew recipe I ever used and the last.  And to the people who completely changed this recipe and then had the nerve to give it a bad rating "shame on you!" Thank you for submitting!

Excellent. I did through in a couple of bay leaves and 1/2 cup of Burgandy wine. I also used 2 TBS of Worchestire sauce and 5 can of beef broth because 3 did not cover all of the vegi's. This is the tastiest beef stew ever.

I can't believe my picky husband and 5 year old, loved it!
This is the best beef stew I have ever made or tasted!
I did not change a thing, and it was perfect.
Thank you for a healthy and delicious recipe...

Great stew recipe. I added Lipton's dry Onion Roasted Garlic (soup) mix with water as I didn't have any beef broth.  Yum!  Browning meat well and deglazing is important.  I followed others suggestions, half the pepper, added crushed tomatoes, etc.

The perfect beef stew recipe! This is the best recipe by far. I like to add garlic & mushrooms along w/onion sautee. I also used water (after boiling) & beef bouillion cubes since I did not have canned broth on hand. This recipe is great by itself, and also very versitile - you can add whatever you want according to your personal taste. I will never try another beef stew recipe again! Thank You!!

It must be called Angel's because it's so comforting, it feels like heaven. I made it exactly like the recipe called for, even though other folks advised it was bland. It was FANTASTIC! Also, I'm not sure why someone found it a lot of work---I browned all the beef in one big batch (making half the recipe, though), and chopped up the veggies while it was browning. My 13-month-old, who is picky, gobbled this up faster than I could cut it into pieces for her. Our local heat-and-eat restaurant makes something that tastes identical---for $3.95 a pint! Will not look for another stew recipe: this is The One!

This was a good recipe to use as a base.  It is easy to customize to your own particular taste.  I added 1/3 of the potatoes at the beginning (they broke down and thickened the stew) then added the remaining potatoes half way through cooking.  I also added tomato paste, red wine, and other various spices.

This is an excellent base recipe for Beef Stew. Like all recipes, just tweak it for your own tastes. I added mushrooms and some corn as far as veggies go. I added much more seasoning...1 can of tomato juice in addition to the beef broth, fresh garlic sauteed with the onion...sage, paprika, a touch of tobasco and a few squirts of Hickory Smoke BBQ sauce. Have fun with it. Thanks for the recipe.

This was really easy and really good.  This will be my only beef stew recipe from now on.  My beef was fully tender after about 1.5 hours simmering, so check it before 2 hours.  I did not add veggies for the entire simmering time because I like my veggies a little firmer.  (the onions were the exception.)  Make it...

Completely disappointed with this recipe. Considering all the five ratings, I thought it would blow me away. It didn't even come close. Only upon adding every kind of spice, wine etc., could I serve it for dinner. Very bland. Will not be making again.

This was very good!  I took the advice of someone from another posting and added a few squirts of ketchup and BBQ sauce to give it some more flavor.  I also added a bay leaf.  If you're going to let this simmer for a while, I'd suggest waiting to add the potatoes until an hour or so before serving b/c I let mine cook on low all afternoon and most of the potatoes had disintigrated.  But it was still a very hearty and delicious stew.  The meat was so tender!

This was DELICIOUS.  I only used one can beef broth and another can of water.  This came out nice and thick because of all the potatoes.  I did add extra spices (dash of savory, sage, rosemary, garlic salt, thyme, paprika, seasoned salt) because we like like strong savory flavors.  Next time I will add a dash of burgundy wine.  The most time consuming part of the recipe was flouring and browning the meat but it's well worth it to get the crust on the meat nice and crispy. I cut the potatoes and carrots while I was doing that.  Great base recipe for stew!

This beef stew is wonderful.  My kids don't like onions so I left them out and instead of beef broth I used 3 cups of water, 3 beef boullion cubes and a bottle of beer.  It was great!!  I didn't need to add the flour and water at the end, the base thickened on its own.

This was excellent, the only change I would make was to only use about 1/4 the amount of pepper called for.  I cut the amount in half because it seemed like too much and that was still a bit too much for us.

I have been looking for a stew recipe that does not use tomatoes. This one is really delicious! I added parsley, basil, a bay leaf and worcheshire sauce to give it a little more flavor. Next time I will only use half the salt.

This is a great base from which to create a stew the way you like it. 

I substituted mushrooms for the Celery, and spiced it up.

This turned out perfectly!  I was in a rush so I throughly browned the meat.  I can't get canned stock over here so I used cubes and enough water to cover.  Turned out wonderfully!  Will definitely use again!!

I fixed this for my husband, sister-in-law and niece.  I added worcestshire and also added 1 beef boullion cube with boiling water.  Also added the potatoes one hour into the cooking time.  Took the advice of some other reviewers.  Also added the rosemary, thyme as well.  They all rated it a 4.5 to a 5.  Would definitely fix again.  Used round steak cut up in chunks that had been pounded.  Tasted great!

I have never been very good at making beef stew, but I did it :).  My family loved walking into our home and being hit with the smell of the stew cooking on the stovetop. I will be making this recipe for years to come.

Yummy and easy comfort food.  I followed OLIVERCADO's suggestions under Most Helpful.  I added extra carrots, onions, and added some mushrooms because I didn't want potatoes.  I thickened it with corn starch and served it over egg noodles.

Makes you never want to buy canned soup again.  Excellent! The beef tastes REALLY good from being coated and then browned -- add more please!  Also needs much more beef stock/broth than the recipe calls for (like, twice as much) and should simmer for only about an hour - after that it was plenty thick, and my veggies started to get mushy.

I found this stew rather bland, even though I added Thyme, a bay leaf and Peprika.  I simmered this for two hours and the potatoes and carrots were mushy...

Thank you Margo.  Each week I have my three grown step-sons over for dinner.  We plan the menu the week prior.  They were so excited for Beef Stew!  I unfortunately planned it for the hottest night in October!!!  It was well worth it!  Huge hit for my youngins' and his oldins'!

This was pretty good. I was surprised that I needed to add salt, I figured with the canned beef broth it would be plenty salty but it wasn't.  I used a cornstarch/cold water mixture to thicken it to my liking.

Absolutely wonderful!  I added 2 cans of stewed tomatoes, dried minced garlic, an extra teaspoon of salt, 2 bay leaves, celery seed, and frozen peas at the end.  I served it over Jasmine rice.  It couldn't taste any better!  Thank you, Margo.

Made recipe for six instead of twelve because there is only two of us!  The best stew recipe I have tried to date.  Changes I made were to double the amount of salt and not too much pepper.  During simmer time, I shook in (I do not measure too much!!) some Cavender's All Greek seasoning which is a marvelous blend of herbs and a little red wine!  Superb!  No leftovers!  We were pigs it was soooooo goooood!

Browning the meat wasn't super easy, but well worth it since it added so much flavor.  The only thing I changed about this was that I added some red wine to it.  Then I used cornstarch mixed in some cold water and added it as a thickener instead of the flour.

I made this for dinner last night and it was great! I scaled the recipe down to 6 servings, and still had a ton. After I brought the initial mixture to a boil, I transfered it to a crock pot, and cooked for about 5 hours.  Buying pre-cut veggies made this easy, as well.

I didn't think this recipe was very easy at all. I had never made stew before, and chose this one because of all the reviews. I had a horrible time browning the meat with the flour coating it ended up burning even though I had the heat turned way down, plus a "big" pot doesn't quite cut it. Maybe a super huge pot. I used my ducth oven and had to take out most of the potatoes and carrots that I had cut because it wouldn't all fit. The end result was good, except that it had a wierd burnt flavor from the flour burnign while I browned the meat. Next time I make stew I will not use the flour mix, I will just brown the meat in a bit of oil. If you have never made stew before or haven't been cooking long this may not be the recipe for you.

This stew was absolutely wonderful.  I did alter it a little bit by adding 1 can of baby peas and frozen corn.  I also used stew meat that was tenderized.....The meal was totally awesome....

Great on a cold, rainy day.  I served it with bread and butter.  Delicious!!  I didn't have beef broth on hand, so I substituted chicken boullion and I added a couple of bay leaves for a little extra flavor.  Worked out just fine.

Made this for dinner last night and my husband and I both enjoyed it.  I made some minor adjustments: cut down on the onions, added more potatoes and carrots, and adjusted the seasonings to taste (more salt and pepper after the first hour of simmering).  I also didn't have celery on hand so I used celery salt as part of my seasoning and added some corn as well.  Yummy!  (and it tasted even better the next day!)

I don't usually like stew but this recipe me and my kids couldn't get enough.  I did all the steps until the boiling then transferred stew to a crock pot and cooked on low for 8 hours.  Turned out so tender and flavorful.

This is the best stew I ever made. I will definately make it again. The beef was very flavorful and tender. I simmered for 4.5 hours and the meat just melted in our mouths. Next time I will add some frozen peas.

I made this the first time a few weeks ago and ever since the demands to make it again and again have been never ending. I don't add the celery as no-one likes it here and the end result is stil fantastic.

I fed my sons and their families with this recipe. It was extremely good and easy to make.
We all enjoyed it immensely and will make it again, I'm sure. I served it with homemade 
cornbread and that made it yummmm! It was really good for the cold weather! Sandi

I just tried out this recipe.  Delicious! I used beef bouillon...didn't have canned. Also, I used a little wine to deglaze the pot after cooking the onions. Will definitely make this again and again.

This came out extremely tasty.  Definitely needed more salt...alot more.  I ended up using 2 medium yellow onions instead of small boiling onions, as that's what I had on hand. I would say not to add the veggies until the last hour for still soft but not mushy potatoes. Added some thyme and a dash of worcestershire sauce for flavor like I read in other reviews.

This stuff is great! I add some sage, rosemary, and thyme if I have it on hand, and a little Worcestershire sauce. I usually only simmer it for no more than an hour and it turns out great.

Fabulous!  I added more onions, and went lighter on the potatoes.  I happened to have beef bones on hand, so I made my own stock, and that really made a difference in the final taste of the stew.

I cut this recipe in half but used two cans of beef broth instead of what should have been 1 1/2 cans. Still didn't feel like it made enough gravy, (I like gravy). Next time I will cut it in half and use three cans of beef broth. Also, used a packet of beef stew mix instead of flour for the thickening agent. Since it has seasoning in it I didn't add any salt but did add a bit of freshly ground black pepper. Added 3 tablespoons of worcestershire sauce, and 3 tablespoons of cheap red wine. Very tasty. Very tasty, indeed.

I took the advice of others and added more spices to this.  I also put the potatoes in it after about an hour before it was done.  This was good.  Will probably make again if I don't find another recipe I like better.  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe!

I followed the directions exactly and found that I did need to thicken it. I agree with those who think it needs spices. Ironically, my potatoes did not evercook, but my carrots did. This is one I think you will have to play around with to get just right, but it's a great base recipe.

This was a great recipe! It's a keeper! I also made the stew in the crock pot, however I cooked the whole thing on low for eight hours, adding the potatoes for the last 6. TO the flour I added a little garlic powder, extra black pepper, and some paprika. And to the pot I added 2 bay leaves. This is definately not a bland recipe.

I agree that the picture displayed of this stew is not appealing at all.    The stew needs something to spice it up. it is rather bland as is written.  Added some tomato sauce and used either Tiger sauce or Hot pepper sauce to it to spice it up a bit.
also, adding 3T flour to thicken is a bit much. Probably could get by with only adding 1 1/2 T of flour if it needs thickening.

Outstanding!  I did this in the crockpot and let it cook on low all day!  My kids loved it!  I would definitely not add the flour and water together at the end to thicken it though.  I took some of the broth in a small bowl, added the flour and mixed until the flour made a rue and then added it to the stew to cook for 30 minutes.

I am rating this 5 stars after I made a second time with some modifications to my first (4 stars) Both times I converted recipe to a 6 serving size (serves 12 as is). Second time I added a 4th potato, 8oz "no salt added" tomato sauce (added  some color as well as flavor), left out the boiling onions on kids request, added a little more regular onions to the first batch about 1/2 way through and added about 3/4 cup frozen peas. Also had to use a little corn starch to thicken it up a bit, otherwise a very nice stew on a cold weekend.

Very Good BEEF STEW!!  I let it cook all day in the slow cooker and it was awesome!  The only thing I did different was ADD PEAS to it which I happen to like in my stew!  Very easy to prepare the night before and let cook all day!

This makes A LOT so if you don't have a big stock pot, half the recipe.  I followed the directions as written except I added about a cup of red wine with the beef broth & used a chopped onion instead of boiling onions.  I also did not peel the potatoes.  Turned out great.  I skipped the thickening part, too.  Serve with crusty French bread.

I had never made beef stew before and this was a great base recipe to use.  I combine ideas from different recipes and user reviews.  I used a lot more seasoning when browning the beef.  I used chopped onions that I had on-hand and more veggies than called for, including mushrooms. I quartered the potatoes and they thickened the stew enough, I didn't have to add the additional flour.  Good thing too because it is much thicker the next day! I didn't have canned broth so I used boullion cubes with water and a beer.  I added enough to cover everything.  It turned out great and my husband (who is very big on spices) loved it!  We will definitely make this again!

I have been waiting for the perfect cool fall day to make this recipe...this is comfort at it's BEST! OMG...we LOVED this stew! I omitted the onions (my preference), but otherwise followed the recipe very closely, but added green beans towards the end of the cook time. I served this over some egg noodles and had warm crusty french bread on the side. This stew was so thick and filling - and the leftovers were even better the next day. (side note - when I reheated the stew, I added another can of beef broth to loosen up the stew as it had gotten so thick it was pretty much solid, lol)This is a keeper, for sure!!!

I have tried many beef stew recipes, but they never came out right. Yours is the best!! I have made it many times and always great. The only thing I do is add beef boulion cubes for extra flavor. Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe.

Delicious and homey.  My roommates and boyfriend loved it.  I did add a few bayleaves and a bit more spice and used half of a regular yellow onion.  It smells heavenly when cooking and reheats for a great lunch the next day.  (I also didn't use celery only because I dislike it)  A wonderful base for a good old-fashioned stew that you can tweak to your own liking!

I'm giving 5 stars but did tweak it a bit. Used pieces of beef tenderlion and ribeye (had in freezer), browned as suggested. Only needed 2 cans of beef broth. Added 1/4 c. flour to some cooled broth to thicken.  Wasn't too thick at all. Used chopped reg. onion. Portobella baby mushrooms, carrots, celery, turnip (instead of potatoes...tastes the same). Also added 2 bay leaves and a bit of worcestshire sauce. Made in crock pot on high for 4-5 hours. Served over rice with sweet potato biscuits. Will make again.

This beef stew ROCKS! I couldn't believe how tender the meat came out. I also bought just beef for stew (cheaper). My husband loved it and so did my 5 year old. Definitly adding this recipe to my "frequents". Thanks!

Fabulous.  I drooled all day as this cooked.  I bought the cheapest marbled sterak I could find and did this recipe exactly.  I would do it again and again if my family loved stew as much as I do.  I make batches of it for myself and freeze it.  Yum.

I have made it with both the expensive beef that is cut and sold as stew meat as well as a cheap 2lb. cut of chuck steak that i cubed myself. Both times the meat was so tender and just fell apart. I was quite impressed! Also I didn't use boiler onions, I cut a large onion into about 1 inch pieces. Make them bigger if you like pieces of onion because in mine they cooked down to nearly nothing. As a student on a budget, I was very happy that this recipe made an entire dutch oven full of stew that kept for 2 weeks. Just as good 10 days later as the first night. Thank you so much for this recipe!!!!

My husband and I enjoyed this stew, although I did make some changes.  I left out the onions and added 2 tbsp. Ragu tomato sauce, plus a dash each of parsley, basil, rosemary, and thyme.  I will have to continue to experiment with the spices.  Next time I will definitely put the celery in later as it became rather mushy.  I might also try browning the meat in a separate pan to make clean-up easier.  As others have said, this is a good base recipe and you can add your favorite ingredients and flavorings.

Yep, it's delicious with changes.  I used 3 large carrots, 4 potatoes, 2 small onions and 2 lb. of sirloin. I don't see how if you used all the ingredients called for that you'd have enough liquid. I used wine instead of water to mix with the flour, I also added several dashes of Worcestershire sauce plus a sprig each of thyme and rosemary. It was pretty amazing, but I see why people rate it so much lower because this is not the written recipe. Anyhoo, I'm grateful for this delicious meal, thanks everyone for your contributions to improve this recipe.

I liked this, though I don't think it was spectacularly greater than other beef stews. I had never made it before, and I was pretty leery about adding so much onion. But it turned out fine. It made a lot and we got to eat it all week.

Though it took a little time, it was well worth the effort.  I won't make beef stew any other way from now.  Only thing I did differently was adjust the recipe for 4 servings & used Crisco shortening instead of the vegetable oil to brown the meat in.

Good flavor and just as easy as using a store bought stew seasoning package. I like the option of adjusting the thickness of the sauce near the end of cooking because I sometimes want a thinner sauce to serve over noodles. Also, using pearl onions is great because it's easy to make sure that my anti-onion daughter doesn't get any in her serving. The whole family rated this recipe an A+

I really liked this except next time I will cut back on both the salt and pepper and add a few herbs like bay leaf or thyme. I liked the results of tossing the meat with the flour. I made a few slight changes -- I substituted a can of Campbells condensed French Onion Soup, one can of water, and almost a can of wine for all the beef broth. Also, before making the gravy, I took some meat out for my picky (non-stew-eating) kids, and one of them gobbled it up!

This was really good.I added 1/2 cup of mushrooms, split in half, canned greened beans, and small shell shaped pasta to it. Additionally, I added 1/2 a teaspoon of liquid smoke and a teaspoon or two of Accent and used Lawry's Seasoned Salt instead of regular salt. I also, after cooking, poured the mixture in a baking dish, covered the top with store bought puff pastry and brushed the top with egg white. This made it a wonderful beef stew pot pie. Great comfort food! DELICIOUS

This recipe was very easy, which was great since I'm not an experienced cook.  I added 1 tablespoon of Schillings Monterey Steak seasoning.  My husband absolutely loved the stew.  I would use this recipe again.

Pretty good, although my alterations made it even better.  I deglazed the pan with Merlot before adding the onion, scraping up all the browned bits.  Then I substituted more Merlot for some of the beef broth.  I didn't have boiling onions, so I just coarsley chopped an onion and threw it in.  Then I removed about 2 tablespoons of broth from the pot and blended it with some corn starch to thicken it up.  I have had better beef stews, but this one is still good.

I just made this recipe today, and I have to say it's the perfect comfort food to make the house smell all cozy on a cold winters day.

I didn't measure out the seasonings, as I just like to season-to-taste...but, it was a great reipe.  I did add some red-wine when sauteeing the onions, as well as worschester sauce and 2 bay leaves to the mix.  i added some corn starch at the end to thicken it up a bit.

will definately make it again soon.

This stew was incredible!  I followed the directions exactly, even adding the veggies in the beginning, and I found that the potatoes did disintegrate as others had mentioned, but that seemed to make the gravy perfectly think!  I would definitely make this again!

Very delicious. I like stews and soups with a kick so I added two tablespoons of Tabasco. I also added the can of chopped tomatoes and think it really enhances the broth. Served it with cheese biscuits. Great!

This is a very good recipe!! I used 4 beef boullion cubes and 4 cups hot water instead of broth I didn't have any broth. The gravy was excellent and just right not too thick or thin. I also dumped the remaining flour in with the last bit of meat as I was browning it and that is probably why I didn't need to thicken later. I added 1 tsp of parsley and 1 tsp rosemary, however that was way too much of rosemary. Next time I will omit the rosemary.Thanks for a super good recipe. I won't make any other beef stew except for this!!

This stew is the BEST! The crowd I made it for just raved.  The only changes I made was I probably used three pounds of stew meat and I did not add water but continued adding broth.  It was thick and delicious.  I will be making this stew often!

So easy and yet soooo good. It had the perfect "stew" flavor that reminded me of when I was a girl on cold winter days. My boyfriend said it was better than his mothers' stew.

This was super!  Very easy to make and quite tasty!  It makes a lot too!  I added some eggplant, some frozen corn and peas and a bit of fresh basil.  DE-LISH! :-)

Just was not as tasty or as thick as we would have liked it, despite adding flour.  Flavor was weak.

I have never made stew before and chose this recipie because of all the reviews.  Overall, it was easier than I thought it would be to make, but lacked flavor.  My boyfriend and I had to add a LOT of salt and pepper to our dishes in order for it to have decent flavor.  The meat came out very tender though.  I might make this again, but if I did I would add WAY more salt and pepper and maybe some mushrooms.

My husband said this is the best stew He's ever had.  He doesn't say things like this often!  I also used celery salt in place of the celery, used baby carrots, more potatoes.  I didn't have enough beef broth so I added some water and did the "thickening" suggested 1/2 hour before done.
Thank You Angel!

This recipe was amazing.  I don't like celery and onions much so I didn't use as much and I cut them big so they could be used for the flavor but could be easily picked out.  I used baby carrots and added fresh mushrooms, corn, & peas.  Other seasonings as well like rosemary, savory, parsley, & basil.  Instead of the over the stove I put it in my crock pot on High for about 5 hours. I wanted to add a little red wine but it came out wonderful without it. YUMMMMM!

Delicious!  I altered the veggies a little, because we like more potatoes and carrots than onion, but dredging the beef before making the stew really made it thick and rich.

The best stew I've tasted anywhere! That includes my father's and he's a chef! The flavor is enough to bring tears to your eyes. I find it best to use with black angus beef.

Great basic recipe and well received by all who tried it. I modified it as follows:
I  added 1/2 can tomato paste and a 1/2 cup white wine to the broth.  
In the last hour, I added frozen (thawed) peas (aprox. 1 cup) and green beans (aprox. 1.5 cups), and some chopped mushrooms.

The recipe calls for 1 teaspoon of black pepper.  We found that was just too much pepper.  We are going to cut it down to 1/4 teaspoon.

My fave beef stew recipe.  I add turnip and saute 1/2 of a large cut up onion instead of the small boiling onions.  Such nice flavour and my 88 year old mom says it tastes just like her mothers recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

This was very good exactly the way the recipe was written.  As with ANY recipe, it's your choice to customize with/without other ingredients, but the flavor, consistency and all of the basics can be found right here!  I think the key to creating the best flavor is to make sure you brown the meat really good because that's the only way you will get the rich, flavorable gravy you want.

This is the best beef stew I've ever tasted! The only thing I changed was to use seasoned salt instead of iodized salt. It's absolutely perfectly balanced and so savory.  This is the only recipe I'll use from now on.  Thanks!

I made the recipe exactly as called for just about. The store didn’t have the boiling onions so I substituted 6 small onions and halved them. I’m an amateur cook and didn’t realize that the soup would reduce, so added like 2-3 cups water to the broth but wound up pouring some off as it cooked. I also added the flour at the end. It is a very delicious and hearty soup! Enjoyment of these recipes depends on one’s palate completely. I can’t say it’s “bursting with flavor” per se, but it’s very very delicious and I will definitely make this again. Great with some rye buttered bread :) thank you!!!

It was a good basic recipe. 4 stars because I had to add to it.    Used chuck roast, beat it with the tenderizer then marinated it with 1/4 cup merlot (that’s what I had) and 2TBSP Worcestershire and salt. I used red potatoes because I was always taught they don’t fall apart and these held up pretty well. Recipe said 6 large potatoes. So I had found some really large ones... maybe too large because I had probably too many potatoes because I had to use two quarts of beef broth!! I used all other ingredients as recipe indicated, except I used three medium yellow onions instead of boiling onions. Took advice from others and added crushed tomatoes, but I’ll probably do diced tomatoes next time. About a half of a large can. Added rosemary and thyme. Even with the extra liquid, it was the perfect consistency in the end. Do not try to make this go faster, it needs to simmer at least the two hours. Will def make again. Hubs just thought it lacked some seasoning and I agree, however it was very good.

I followed as written with 1 addition only. After I braised the meat and removed it from the pot, I sauted the onions and then after I removed them I deglazed the pan with marsala wine. Followed the rest as written. I cut the potatoes and carrots similar size to cook evenly and did simmer for 2 hours with cover on.  Because carrots and potatoes were still not soft, I dumped it all into pressure cooker for 15 minutes. Perfect. Served with egg noodles to  sop up all the juice.

This is a very good basic stew.  I added more seasoning as it was a bit bland for our taste.  My husband sopped up the gravy with bread and really enjoyed it.

The only change I made was the time. It was done in an a hour and half. It's a good stew and will make again. There is only two of us so need to make a smaller batch next time. We have stew coming out our ears.

Easy to make and tastes good!  I used leftover steak and skipped flouring meat.  I prefer thickening with corn starch instead of flour.   Family loved it, will be making this again.

I went a step further and made my own broth from the meat trimmings. Cut up the trimmings, rolled them in the leftover flour mixture, browned in a separate pan, added four cups of water and 2 teaspoons of beef boullion, and let that simmer while I cut up carrots and potatoes. Strained that into the pot at the right time, then ground up the remaining bits for my dogs. They were just as happy as we were!

I used Yukon Gold potatoes quartered  they cooked up so tender, organic grass fed chuck roast cubed at the butcher.  After I browned the chuck roast I let it rest for 15 minutes before putting in the pot again.   3- 14 oz cans of unsalted non-gmo beef broth so I had lots of liquid,  at an  1 hr 20 min I stirred in the flour and water with salt and pepper to taste and it was ready at 1 hr  30 min.  Perfect tender beef and the vegs just done. I live at sea level.  I served with warm brown and serve rolls and a nice French white wine from Trader Joes.  This makes a hearty meal for 4-5 people.

This was a basic stew recipe. I agree to hold the potatoes out for the first hour and the thickening directions are backwards 1 tablespoon flour to three tablespoons water. You can jazz it up however you wish but for just a basic stew it was delish!

Made this for my wife and me, cutting all measurements by half  except water. We loved it.  I used a regular onion cut in large flakes. Next time I will add more celery and carrots, maybe mushrooms.
Easy job, and really good.

Great recipe. I did use more beef broth and diced my potatoes into decent size chunks and I think this saved them from the long cook. You could add potatoes towards the end of the simmer. Just make sure they are tender before you take off the stove.  Any potato that did disintegrate added to help thicken my stew. 4 star because I think it needs to have beef broth increased in ingredient list.

I've made several modifications and it turned out great.  I didn't add the celery (just forgot).  Doubled the salt, added some oregano, rosemary, sage and parsley.  Added potatoes and carrots about an hour into it.  I also ended up using a lot more beef broth then was specified.

Loved this recipe as a base! I followed the advice about adding fresh herbs and adding the vegetables later on. I found that there wasn't enough of the soup part for everything cooking (the measurements for the veggies and meat were followed exactly) so added more beef broth, a mix of water and flour and more herbs. I also added some beer. The beef came out extremely tender and the vegetables were amazing!

This is our favorite beef stew recipe.  I have made it several times.  We like lots of veggies in our stew so I add whole kernel corn, green beans and peas.  I also add additional flour to coat the beef which makes the gravy a bit thicker.  Just the way we like it.  Thank you for sharing.

I agree with the person who said this was a good basic recipe.  I also agree that the potatoes need to be cut larger to keep them from falling apart.  I substituted red wine for part of the broth and added thyme and salt.  I think the people who added bouillon were just looking for more salt!

This recipe is a solid 5. We had friends over when I made this and everyone loved it. The only things I did different were I used regular onions chopped fine, I added some Tex Joy Steak Seasoning to the flour mixture, and I used a powsered gravy mix to thicken, but it didn't need much. I will definately be making this again!

This was just okay. Seemed to need more spice, maybe a bay leaf or 2? I used half water and half beer, cooked the meat and onions for 1 hour than added the potatoes and carrots and continued you cooking for another hour. I threw in a handful or so of frozen peas for the last 15 minutes. I thickened it with a can of beef gravy. This was not the stew recipe for me, will keep looking.

This was an okay beef stew recipe. I thought it was a bit bland. I added some peas and corn to it to liven it up a little.

This stew recipe was awesome!!  I have made it three times.  It also makes great leftovers.  I made some for my elderly neighbors and they loved it as well.  Wonderful for a chilly day!  Simple and delicious!

This stew was the best! My kids even ate it. I followed the recipe but added 1 small(single serving) can of V8 and a can of baby peas before serving.

Wow, this is a great base recipe. I omitted the celery, cubed the potatos, added green beans, and a little more seasoning, and the finished product turned out very tasty, and perfect for this chilly fall weather. I served the stew with some homemade french rolls, and dinner was a hit.

Thank you for this recipe Margo.

I absolutely loved the recipe. My husband and I (even my picky sister) loved it. I read all the reveiws.  I made some changes like some of the reveiws. I added my potatoes the last hour.  I added beef bouillon and seasoning salt for added flavor, I used one yellow vidallia onion and one can of beef gravy instead of the flour for thickening.  It was great! I will use it again.

Delicious! I made this tonight but with a couple changes. I omitted the celery since we don't care for it, and added salt and pepper to the simmering stew because it needed salt and we like pepper. Simmered it for 90 minutes and served with biscuits on the side. I would definitely make this again!

If you quarter the potatoes, they don't disentigrate.  This stew was very tasty.  I made this for a crowd of people and they all loved it, even my onion-hating boyfriend.

I used red skinned potatoes and added a lot more pepper because I just like my stew to be very peppery.  It was really good though!

This is GREAT!  Not a big fan of onions, so I only use 1, but it was yummy!
Takes a little long to prepare, because of the time to fry up the beef, so I don't make it as often as I would like.

Awesome basic recipe.  I love to cook and enjoy trying new recipes.  Now my stew was not the same color as the picture, but I believe that's because I tweaked mine.  I made this on a cold snowy day.  I could not wait to dig in.  The flavor was lacking just a tad, I think it might have needed some red wine.  I think next time I will add some whole mushrooms.  I made the sweet potato roll recipe to go along with this.  The combination was terrific.

This is a great basic stew recipe.  I tweak it a little by adding slice mushrooms, bay leaf, a can of tomatoes (in place of 1 can of beef broth), a little bit of apple juice, and some red cooking wine.  It's great done on the stove top, or in a crock pot (I brown the beef first).  I also really like to throw in a soup bone or two--brown it on all sides first.  It really enhances the flavor.

Stew is consistent and a real crowd pleaser. Good the next day too.  I prefer using Vidalia onion, and I don't thicken it at the end.  A 1/2 recipe, side salad, cornbread, and a nice bottle of merlot will feed eight for Sunday supper.

Just follow the directions and make a yummy beef stew. I used a chopped yellow onion instead of the pearl onions and it was still just as good. Served with fresh biscuits this will quickly become a family favorite.

Tried this recipe this week...outstanding.  By far one of the best dishes I have made!  I used sirloin tips and added some Shiraz (3/4 cup) in place of one of the cups of beef broth.  It was delicious and I will keep this one handy!  Thanks!

Oh soooo yummy! This is comfort food at it's very best. I've made it twice now following the recipe exactly except I add a bottle of beer with all the main ingredients and add frozen peas and corn about 30 minutes from done. This recipe is wonderful as is and is also fun to play with. Thank you so much for submitting such a yummy stew :-)

Very good stew, with a few changes. I left out the boiling onions, using half of a yellow onion instead. I personally prefer more veggies and a slightly thicker broth, so I added frozen green beans and cornstarch. Overall, quite delicious.

Excellent, but next time I'm going to omit the flour while cooking the beef.  I'd like the broth a bit thicker too, and the flour/water mixture didn't seem to help.  But it was delicious as a soup, perfect for cold rainy nights.

I followed the recipe closely but based on other feedback I spiced it up a bit.  It was wonderful for a cold fall day - great comfort food.

here goes. it was one of the best dishes i have ever made. I cut the carrots and celery into large pieces, used one large onion and sliced it. one tsp of parsley, tyme, rosemary, and sage into the pot for flavor. two tsp paprika in the coating mix for meat. cooked 2 hrs then added potatoes, one cup frozen peas and corn. cook one more hr. 1/2 hr left to cook added small amount of flour mix to thicken. bottle of pinot noir and crusty bread and you guessed it, great. only think i would change 1/2 tsp of sage instead of one. no worchestershire or toms ever ever

Everything turned out great and the flavor was exactly what I expected, but I ended up having to cook it for over 4 hours as opposed to the suggested 2 hours in order to get the vegetables tender enough to eat.

Great recipe!  I spiced it up to our personal tastes.  At first when I put everything in the pot, I thought I had done something wrong - the stock didn't cover everything, but then eventually as it simmered all was well. The edges of the potatoes kind of "melted" to thicken the broth and made it perfect - no need for added flour.  This tasted even better after sitting overnight.  I'll make again very soon!

This is the recipe I've always used and liked.  For those who want more tomato flavor, like me, simply decrease the amount of broth and add an equivalent portion of V8 juice.  I usually use 2 10oz cans of broth, 1 can of V8.  For that matter, I've used only V8 and no broth and it still comes out OK.

This is a near classic beef stew recipe, however, I made a few modifications to suit my taste: 
added 3/4 cup red wine
used 2 large onions
1/4 cup minced parsley
used 4 potatoes instead of 6
This is easy and very warming on a chilly Fall day.

This is a great recipe.  I also added fresh green beans during the last 30 minutes of cooking time.  Thank you for submitting.  I will definitely use this recipe in the future.  I really liked that this recipe used most ingredients that you stock in your kitchen.

This recipe didn't work for me, and I followed it to a tee. I added all the ingredients the recipe asks for and didn't put in the extra flour. I let it simmer for two hours, like it says, but the broth turned clumpy and way too thick. It started to gel when I took it off the stove! What went wrong? We ate it anyways and it tasted fine, but certainly not the best I've had.

This stew is the best recipe I've ever tried.  I used "stew meat" from the store and it turned out so incredibly tender.  The flavor is good but I added a bay leaf for a little extra.  My family loved it - even the picky 10 year old.

This was good, but I think next time I will add a couple of bullion cubes to give it a little more flavor. I added about 1/3 c red wine to give it a little kick. All 5 of my kids loved it,even the picky eater! I will make this again. Thank you.

I have made this recipe a ton of times and it is by far the best stew I have made.  It is so similar to my grandfather's homemade beef stew, it is un-real.  If it seems too bland, just add some extra salt and pepper and you are good to go.  This recipe is super easy to follow and the only left overs we ever eat in my house!

On its own it is just ok, in fact a basic recipe which adapts quite well to various adding of personal preferences which I've noticed plenty of reviewers did, to it. I added LP sauce, mixed herbs, a bit of fresh garlic and bird eye chillies, more beef, delicate touch of tomato sauce, some fresh tomatoes, before the family deemed it good. Oh yeah, don't skimp on salt, add a bit more if you're using homemade beef broth, which I did. Not bad.

I made this today for my husband.  I don't do stews, but my family really enjoyed it..  But my husband said it seemed to be missing one thing.  He finally decided the next time I make it for him(which means he really did like it), I am to add some tomato sauce to the beef broth. :}

I made no changes to this recipe. I had complaints before that my stew was too thick, so I didn't thicken this and it came out perfect.

I’m brand new to the cooking experience, and this was my very first stew. Altogether, it is a really good recipe, but I must agree with others, that adding of additional ingredients was necessary to enrich the taste. In my case I put some more veggies to add some color, and more spices.  The final dish was delicious !!!

Maybe its just my preferred taste but I use 2.1/5 cups verg. juice and 2 teaspoons of instant beef boullion instead of the beef broth you get more of a beefy tomatoe base instead of a french onion soup. I add a little basil or majorum and a bay leaf for my spices you really need it and you can also put a cup of frozen beans and corn in for a little extra veggies, no need for flour because the tomatoe juice is thick.

This stew turned out great- we added red wine in addition to the 3 cans of beef broth.  Adding the potatoes in later as suggested by other reviewers was a great idea since it kept them from breaking down too early.  There were plenty of leftovers and every bit of it got eaten.  Thanks!

Good basic stew.  Next time I won't cook it as long because the vegetables were way too soft for my taste and I didn't simmer it as long as it called for.

This recipe was VERY bland.  I had to add a lot of extra seasonings to this.  But, a good basic stew to build on and season to your individual tastes.  Also, I chopped my onions (about 5) and added about 1/2 lb. more meat.

Very Good - But would definitely suggest adding only a tsp of pepper.  We also added 3 beef boullion cubes.  We cooked this in a crockpot, which was a time saver.

I thought this recipe was very good.  I did add water to mine and made a couple of small changes, such as I used one big onion cut up and did put in some peas.  Excellent dish and I will make it again.  Thank you.

I'm not really a big stew eater but this was great!!!  I used small red potato's.  And I also added a teaspoon of worcestershire sauce and about a 1/2 teaspoon of gravy master a little sage and a little parsley.  And I cut down on the onions.  I added just enough for flavor.  MMMMM!!

I followed many of the recommendations I found for this recipe and it was still a disaster.  I used regular stew beef so I needed to cook it longer then the 1 1/2 hours recommended.  The taste was rather bland and it loooked like sludge.  I don't know if it was something I did or if it is the recipe, but I will not be trying this again.

I thought this was excellent.  My husband thought it was just okay.  I halved the recipe because there's just the two of us, and I added a bit more broth because it cooked down a lot.  Good recipe, I'll use it again. :)

This is a very good stew recipe!  I used only four potatoes and one stalk of celery because my pot wasn't big enough, and it still turned out very tasty.

I made beef stew for my ill in-laws today.  I am not a fan of beef stew, but my husband really liked it.  I haven't spoken to the in-laws yet.  I didn't follow your recipe to the letter as they don't like garlic, but I did brown the meat and then the onions in the beef juices and oil.  Very nice touch.  I also added about 3 ounces of tomato juice to brighten up the flavor.  The only thing I messed up on was not adding additional salt.  I figured that the canned broth was salty enough.  I didn't take into account the added juice resulting from the steam as it simmered.  Thanks for the onion hint.

Very good stew! I used fresh garlic, and didn't
have celery on hand so I used celery seed for the flavor and it was just fine. I was very pleased with how thick and hearty it came out. The flouring and browning of the meat is what does it. The meat was very tender. I will make it again.

very good meal...makes lots so really more than one meal. The browning of meat helps a lot. I had leftover flour mixture so I went ahead and browned the other veggies some and I think that helped. I suspect it is important to use FRESH ground pepper. Might be bland with old pepper.
