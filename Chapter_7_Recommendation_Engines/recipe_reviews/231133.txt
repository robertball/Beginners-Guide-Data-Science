While super easy to make, the down fall in this recipe is the acidic of too much lemon juice and slightly off-putting. It's the 1st thing you taste, above the other ingredients in the recipe. It did however have the back heat of the cayenne and the light lingering flavor of cilantro. I would recommend only using 2 teaspoons of lemon juice, not 2 tablespoons and add an additional avocado or add a diced roma tomato for extra color because the recipe color is rather muted from the canned tomato sauce.
