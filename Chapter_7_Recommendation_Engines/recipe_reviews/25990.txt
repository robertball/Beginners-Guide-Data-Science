This very fudgy frosting tastes great, but do NOT attempt to frost a layer cake with it.  It is much too stiff to work with.  Heated, it can be poured and spread. It would be ideal for brownies or a bundt cake.

I did mine a little differently - instead of melting the butter, I let it get really soft on the counter.  Then added all the ingredients into a mixing bowl and beat it until it was very fluffy.  Very light and very good!

this is a great frosting!  it was a little scary when i added the cocoa mixture, it ended up like little peas, until I added the milk,  it frosted a 13x9 cake wonderfully!  I cut the powder suger down to 3 cups, thanks for the great recipe!

I thought this frosting recipe was fabulous, and I will totally be using it again. I also cut the sugar down to 3 cups (based on other reviewers' opinions) and I added it gradually, so that it was easier to blend. I also added the milk as I was blending the frosting in, rather than at the end. It made for an easier experience. Don't forget that if it's too thick for you, you can ALWAYS add more milk til it's where you want it to be.

Great and fudgy...I added 1 1/2 Tbsp.s of brewed coffee for an even richer fudge flavor.  Put it on a yellow cake and everyone raved!

I think I would prefer using this frosting on brownies or maybe cupcakes.  First off, it tastes like heaven.  It's almost like eating fudge, flavor-wise.  The only thing I ran into was that it wasn't enough to frost a two layer cake (I didn't use it for filling or topping, just along the edge of the top and on the sides) and I put a smidge too much milk in, so it kind of wept off the sides a little.  No one complained though, and the cake was almost gone when I left.  I used it with One Bowl Chocolate Cake III from this site.  Thanks for the recipe!

THIS IS IT!!!!!! This tastes really REALLY good!!!The only thing was I didn't use the full 3 1/2 cups of confectioners sugar. I kept pouring a little at a time and mixing it with just a 1/2 tablespoon and got the constistency that I wanted.So I'd say I used only about 2 to 2 1/2 cups.  It's really tasty :):):) I'll be using this frosting for all my recipes that call for chocolate frosting.

By the time I was done playing around with this to get it to the texture and consistency I wanted, it was very good. But I would have much preferred a more reliable recipe that didn't require so much tweaking.

I made this recipe exactly as the directions said.  It turned out perfect for a 2 layer 9" cake.  It was not too thick or thin and it is very tasty.

The flavor is great! The only thing I would change is the process. I measured the powdered sugar and cocoa and sifted them together to avoid lumps. I then melted the butter, and when the butter was melted, I added the sugar and cocoa to the butter in the pan, keeping the heat to low. I added the vanilla and milk and blended it until smooth. I have another recipe that is similar and the frosting thickens as it cools. If it becomes grainy, I heat it a little more and keep stirring until it smoothes out. Then, I frosted the entire cake. It looks beautiful on the cake and tastes great!

I wasn't too impressed with this recipe. Firstly, it tastes more like sugar than like chocolate. Second, by using so many dry ingredients before the milk, you get a clumpy mixture that you have to stir endlessly to get smooth. I'd suggest using 1/2 c. cocoa, just 2.5 cups of confectionery sugar and adding the milk alternately with the sugar (you may need more than 2 T.). With all these changes, you get a very good frosting.

I had lost my hersheys chocolate frosting recipe and found this one to be the closest for what I needed. It was enough frosting to frost one full cake although the frosting was not put on real thick. I did cut back the powdered sugar 1/2 cup and added extra cocoa to taste and some extra milk as needed to get the perfect consistency. This frosting is not meant for piping it is the consistency of the spreadable types for evenly iced cakes. With the following adjustments it works fine for homestyle chocolate type cakes.

This is a GREAT recipe for frosting, one of the best I have found. I add more cocoa powder and sift it and the confectioners sugar twice before adding them.  This is a frosting you can play with. You can use other extracts and change the flavor to what ever you may like. I used up to half a cup of milk and it turned out very nice.

This was good, very fudgy tasting icing.  But very, very thick and not very easily spreadable at all.  I recommend adding a little more milk than asked for to make it easier to spread.  But it's good if you want it very fudgy-like and thick.

very good icing! I used a little less sugar than it called for and a bit more milk and it was just enough to frost a two layer 9inch cake ( not filled though) A great basic recipe to have on hand!

This made enough for 2 cakes. Perhaps it would of been thicker if i'd used less then the 2 tbs, but as for the taste, I'm not overly impressed. It was rather ordinary. I could of made a similar version without the butter and it would of tasted the same. I guess I was looking for something "more".

SO good! Very similar to the kind in a can, but much better and far richer. I use Dutch cocoa powder and more like 2 1/4 c powdered sugar and I kept the butter soft instead of melted and just mashed everything with a fork. I used it to frost a Duff chocolate cake mix (also the best!), cooked in a 9 x 13 and it worked great! Rave reviews from our guests, too!

i did what one reviewer recommended and blended everything together using extremely soft butter.  this way the frosting had a "melty" texture when eaten.  i also found that it wasn't chocolate-y enough for the brownies i was making, so i had to add more cocoa.

i do, however, like that this is a "no-cook" recipe that is fairly easy to execute.  and no, don't try to ice a cake with this.  it's a forgiving recipe, but it's definitely meant more for brownies and the like.

in all, tasty and easy frosting.

I followed the recipe exactly. I did have to add about a tablespoon more milk. It resembled play dough. The taste needed more coco. I will only make this again if I have very little time and need a quick frosting that will be eaten immediately and not have time to sit and harden.

This is my "go-to" chocolate frosting when I don't want to use cream cheese. I beat it with my mixer for a long time to get it really creamy and fluffy and well-blended and it works great.

Very very sweet. Definitely needed more milk. I only used 3 c of sugar as suggested in other reviews, but i think that was still alot of sugar. Next time I will try 2c and add as needed. Tasted more like mousse than fudge.

This frosting recipe was awesome!  I had to modify it to make it gluten-free and dairy-free and it didn't disappoint!  I just substituted gluten/dairy-free margarine for the butter and rice milk for the milk and used it for a birthday cake.  The guests were totally surprised to find it was free of these ingredients!  Absolutely yummy!

Very tasty but way too stiff for frosting a cake.  I had to melt it and spoon it over the cake.  Next time I will use less powdered sugar and I think it would be fine.

I made 1.5 batches and it covered and filed an 8" two layer cake with a bit to spare.  I added a teaspoon of Espresso powder to the chocolate mix to give it that mocha taste.  Tasted  great.

Delicious. I used lactose-free skim milk and margarine. I only had 1 tbsp. of vanilla left, but I added a tbsp and a half of vanilla flavored coffee, and that made it up for it. I used maybe a touch more milk than was stated and used the frosting for the Eclair Cake recipe on this site. It went over well with everyone who ate it. Also, I made it another time with a chocolate cake, but was out of milk, so I used 1 tsp. of white chocolate raspberry non-dairy creamer and a little bit of water, and that worked ok too!

This is a very good "medium" chocolate frosting. I'm still searching for the perfect DARK frosting, but this has good flavor and is quick to make. I melted the butter in the microwave, added the cocoa and microwaved for an additional 20 seconds. I would recommend the stovetop method to ensure your cocoa melts completely into the butter - but I was in a BIG hurry and nuking it works fine in a pinch. Yum!

I think this frosting had an amazing flavor, and it's very basic and versatile. I used it to frost a chocolate sheet cake, and it was great. Like a lot of other reviewers, I did have to add more milk to give a more smooth consistency so it would be easier to work with and not crumble my cake. Don't be afraid to use this, no matter what you're baking. This frosting can easily be adjusted to your purpose be it a layer cake or brownies, just add the milk and sugar gradually until you have the desired texture. Achieving it is not hard, and you can always let it chill, which helped me.

No problem icing cake, but I've always used the technique of dropping spoonfuls all over the cake and then smoothing it over, so I'm always ensured that there is enough icing.  We all loved it.  We had it on banana cake.

This recipe is quick and easy, tastes WONDERFUL and is not overly sweet.  It frosted 24 cupcakes generously.  At one point, as I am slow, it hardened a bit, but I just beat it again with a little more milk and it came back to easy spreading. YUM!

I loved this recipe! It is so easy and tastes a little like fudge.  I added a bit more milk because I wanted it a bit thinner.  Also, it is not a huge batch.  Perfect for cupcakes, but I doubled it for a 2 layer sheet cake and didn't have enough to fill it. I will use it every time I want a yummy chocolate frosting!

Very rich, delicious taste. However, it was more like fudge than frosting. Not light and fluffy at all. I noticed that at least one other reviewer mentioned letting the butter soften instead of melting it. I do think I'd try that next time because I think melting the butter does change the consistency.

My girlfriend loved it I thought it tasted great but it was not the texture I was looking for. I like a fluffy, creamy frosting. It is very rich, great chocalate flavor would work great on a cake. As for a cupcakes not so good if you like the tall fluffy type. Thanks I will keep this one.

I am a chocolate frosting LOVER, but oh my, this is actually too sweet for me.  I like a frosting that is creamy, glossy and really spreadable..  It IS thick as described, definitely rich, but I wouldn't really call it creamy.  It's kind of dry looking (dull, not shiny) and I used 3 1/2 tablespoons of milk.  Oh well, I'll share it with my friends in the apartment building where I live and they'll still love it, just not what I was hoping for.

This is perfect frosting for cupcakes. It is fluffy, rich and thick, however, the recipe did not make enough to frost a 2-layer cake.  I used just 3 cups of the sugar as recommended by other reviewers. My kids loved this, and the best part for me was that it was so quick and easy to put together!

Followed recipe exactly, I double the recipe and had enough to frost a three layer  9" and a small 6" on top with some leftover. Flavor was good but the texture was perfect after I let it set for 10 min or so (one kid started crying and I had to leave the kitchen) best mistake because when I came back it was thinck enough to spread and pipe some flowers in. Very happy with the end result.

This was good and easy. I didn't heat it on the stove. I took another reviewer's suggestions and just let my butter get soft and then mixed everything together. I reduced the sugar to 3 cups and increased the cocoa to 1/3 cup. When I make again, I will increase cocoa to 1/2 cup.

I really didn't get the flavor of this frosting. Mine tasted so strongly of vanilla.  I would recommend using less.  I ended up adding some melted chocolate to mask the vanilla flavor. The consistency was great, with the addition of extra milk, and it spread easily.  But maybe start with a tsp. of vanilla, and add to taste before putting in the whole TBSP.

Used 3 cups of powdered sugar and about a small amount more of cocoa then it calls for. Also added about 1 T of freshly brewed coffee. Very good on brownies!

This recipe was a disappointment for me. It was more work than worth it. Be forewarned, you are working with chocolate dough. It was an understatement to call it thick. Wheew. I worked up a muscle, and I didn't even use all the powdered sugar. The electric mixer was preoccupied. I would definitely use the mixer if I was to make a dough. Also, I wouldn't make this again next time. I love fudge on my ice cream but I guess I don't care for regular fudge you eat with your hands. It tasted like fudge but I just didn't care for the taste. Seemed too sweet for me, and, like I said above, I didn't even use all the powdered sugar. I guess I would just like it slightly darker and more chocolatey. I think I'll try to find another recipe on this site. I also gave it more credit because my friend liked it.

Absolutely wonderful and fudgy. I followed the directions exactly and this is the best chocolate frosting I've ever had. I make cakes professionally and got a lot of compliments on this recipe. It was easy to work with and was not gooey at all. The trick is to add the milk a teaspoon at a time like the directions say. THE BEST recipe on the internet!!

i used this frosting to frost a layer cake. i just had to add a few extra tablespoons of milk and i really didnt have very much trouble spreading it. 
it was a very pretty frosting and easy to make. 
I didnt like the flavor very much. The sugar and the cocoa didnt seem to mix well and it just tasted like sweetened cocoa powder... i used a mixer on it for quite a while but it always seemed gritty. maybe i did something wrong but it didnt taste or feel like frosting should. 
after sitting out for only a little while - like even while i was frosting my cake- the icing hardened. it definitely didnt keep long sitting out.

This turned out great, I'd make this again but not for a cake needing a light fluffy whipped airy delicate frosting, as this isn't it. Nice chocolate flavor, this is a great buttercream frosting, but like I said, it is best paired with a denser cake like a brownie.

I made two batches of this to cover my daughter's birthday cake.  In an effort to make it slightly healthier I made one batch per the recipe and made the 2nd batch with FF I can't believe it's not butter.  It was probably a wash as I had to add a little more powdered sugar because that fake butter tends to be watery.  
The recipe is absolutely delicious and simple.  I will definitely make this one again.

This is the perfect frosting for just about anything.  I used evaporated milk  instead, and I'm pretty sure I used more than a few tablespoons to thin the frosting out.  After about 5-6 tablespoons, the consistency was great and I still had some frosting leftover!

I just used 2 batches of this recipe to frost my Yule Log.  It looks nice and tastes very good.  It's easy to adjust the amount of milk for the consistency you need.  I changed just a few things:  I used 1/2T vanilla, 1/3C cocoa, and 2 1/2 C conf. sugar.  I didn't measure the milk, but needed more than in the recipe.  This will be my chocolate frosting recipe from now on!

This is an excellent recipe!  I used chocolate soy milk and added a TBSP of coffee grounds, it had this great mocha flavor!  Everyone loved it, even my 8 year old god-daughter!  This is now a favorite in our house.

Delicious and creamy! For those who said it wouldn’t work for a regular cake, it totally will, just add a little more milk at a time until it reaches the consistency you require. I only had to add about a 2 teaspoons more for my purposes (2 9” rounds).

So happy to find a recipe using powder as opposed to bars.   I did increase the amount of cocoa to 1/2 C otherwise I would have given this 5 stars.  
For those who had problems using this to frost a cake, add a little more milk and beat until the texture is fluffier.  I was able to frost a chocolate cake that had a 1/4" cream cheese filing between three layers quite successfully!!    The additional 1/4 cocoa gave the frosting a rich, not so sweet, flavor.

The sugar mixing with the chocolate wasn't just thick, it was like little beads.  I was afraid it would be lumpy, but when I added the milk, it came together.  However, it was sugary like grainy fudge and it required twice as much milk to reach spreading consistency.  But the flavor was delicious and it made plenty for my 9x13 cake.

In making this easy and delicious frosting to go with the One Bowl Chocolate Cake recipe ( I also altered),  I used vegan butter (Natural Balance} and coconut milk (Silk brand...almond or soy probably works great too).    *Warning - make your cake or cupcakes first AND cool them. Have them ready to frost BEFORE making this recipe.  If you make this frosting and let it sit as you do something else it will thicken and you will have to use your electric mixer to smooth it again. You control the consistency with the amount of milk you use. Make frosting thicker to frost, thin to drizzle, or in the middle to pour and let it slowly drip to the sides as it thickens for a sophisticated flare. It's all up to you.

This is a great recipe-and so easy! Instead of cocoa I used 1/2 cup chocolate chips. Creamy and delicious!

A great frosting for brownies!  I doubled the cocoa and cut the icing sugar back to 3 cups. I also added about 1 additional tbsp of milk.

1 Tablespoon of vanilla overpowered the chocolate flavor. Next time will try 1 teaspoon and see. Could have been a typo?

Way too many dry ingredients.  Had to keep adding milk to soak up all of the sugar.  Taste was okay but I will keep looking for chocolate frosting.

I tried this recipe for the first time today to frost my husband's birthday cake. It was simple to make. I followed one reviewer's suggestion and just softened the butter and mixed all the ingredients together. Since I put the cake on a platter I needed more frosting to cover the sides. I just adjusted the serving amount and I had the right amount to cover very well. Everyone loved the taste! Very chocolatey and fluffy!

All the right ingredients but the amounts seem way off and I used a different process. I doubled the recipe to begin with. Instead of melting the butter I creamed it until it was light and fluffy then added cocoa powder and vanilla. I did the milk and powdered sugar as I was going. It was seeming way too sugary after just a short time so I added another 1/4 cup of cocoa and some brewed coffee. In the end I think I only used 3 1/2 or 4 cups of powdered sugar for a double batch, so I would suggest adding as you go to taste. I had enough to ice two 9" rounds with a little bit of filling and used some in 2 "mug cakes" I made up with the cuttings from leveling the cake.

I just made this recipe. It's delicious. If you use Ghirardelli cocoa powder it comes out a perfect brown color and the taste is yummy. This is the first homemade chocolate recipe that I really love!

Way too sweet & I decreased the sugar to 2 1/2 cups. It felt like it was missing something...maybe heavy cream instead of milk.  I don't know but I'll be looking for a new recipe next time.

Tasted great. At the beginning it looked like it was going to be too much sugar but it worked out perfectly. I had just a little bit under 2 tbsp of vanilla extract because I ran out, so that may account for why I feel like there's something missing. Still a great and easy recipe though.

I halved the recipe as I only had 12 cupcakess to frost. The quantity was just right. The icing is yummy. Though it does taste better the next day if you can be patient to wait. I just melted the butter in the microwave and also added a bit more milf to make it easier to spread. Tried piping but consistency was wrong.

This frosting tastes and looks great, it has a good texture too. But I changed it a tiny bit by using chocolate milk instead of regular white and its sooooo chocolately! I used it to frost a single layer cake and it worked fantastic. Exactly what I was looking for! Thanks for this great frosting :) By the way!!!.... I didnt melt the butter all the way, I put it in the microwave until it was halfway soft then mixed it up real well untill it was just extremely soft butter.

Takes like Fudge!!  I love it!  In the sauce pan I put 1 cup of confectioners' sugar to help with the flavor (mixing flavor) and I added more milk then is stated in the recipe.

I made this frosting to put on brownies and my roommates LOVED IT!  They that the brownies were so good, but they thought what really did it was the frosting.  I read through the other reviews and watched how much powdered sugar I put in.  I think I used almost the full amount, so the recipe, to me, is correct as it is.  :)  I made a batch and a half to cover two pans of brownies.  It smelled delicious!  Very good consistency, fudgy goodness.  I am saving this recipe!

This is basically the same recipe I was raised with but prepared differently.  My husband always said my frosting was bland so I thought I would try prepping it this way.  Instead of baking cocoa I used a square and I used 3 tablespoons of milk (more spreadable) and it came out great!  I think melting the butter instead of heating the milk (the way my mother did it) made all the difference in the world.  Thanks!

Love the flavor of this frosting.  I cut the sugar back to 2 C as other reviewers suggested and it was perfect!!  I did double the recipe and whipped it for several minutes to get it fluffy.  YUM!!!  My new favorite chocolate frosting.

Delicious!  I used 3 full cups of powdered sugar and the full 2 tablespoons of milk.  I sifted the powdered sugar and cocoa together first before adding the wet ingredients.  Very good, I don't know why I'd ever buy frosting again.

I used just 3 c. of the powdered sugar and I had to basically double the milk to 4 T. to get it to a good, spreadable consistency.  I also beat in 1/3 a bag of mini chocolate chips at the end because I love frosting that way (and so do most people I've served it to).  Worked well on a yellow layer cake for me.

I usually don't have any problems with recipes. This however caused me some problems. First, I would use the usual 1 tsp vanilla - was 1 tbsp a mistake?? I added a little almond extract to cut it. Secondly, it was way too thick. Next time I would cut the powdered sugar by as much as a cup. I kept adding scalded 1/2 and 1/2 in an attempt to make it fluffier.   I will probably stick to my safe old standby with the 6 tbsp of cocoa and 6 tbsp of butter. That one calls for 2 1/2 cups powdered sugar so I should have known  better.  Thanks for the idea though! It will just take a little tweeking for me!

Very easy to make but not quite what I was expecting. Too sugar-y and not very chocolate-y. Again, not bad just not what I was expecting.

I didn't like this too much. I tasted too much like powdered sugar.    I added about 6 oz. of cream cheese though, and that made it pretty good. I used it on a cake that I made the egg white receipe for, and colored for my cousin's Birthday.    It did turn out good as a chocolate cream cheese frosting!

This is an okay recipe. I did follow the directions, and I know it turned out right~ but it wasn't my favorite recipe. I wouldn't recommend this recipe and I wouldn't say it was bad, but to much sweetness for me.

I just realized that I was supposed to do the mixing in the saucepan on the stove! I didn't do that - I microwaved the butter and then mixed it all in a bowl.  And it's really good, except it's a bit too vanilla-flavoured. I used a hair under a tablespoon (ran out) but would probably use 2 tsp next time and see how that works.

I was somewhat apprehensive after reading some of the reviews.  This frosting is wonderful!  I followed the directions exactly by adding the milk 1 tsp at a time and mixing after each.  At first I thought I had done something wrong however by the time I added the 5th tsp of milk the recipe finally started turning into a frosting consistency.  My other suggestion is to use a deep bowl.  Mixing the p. sugar and cocoa mixture together is messy if using a mixer.  The flavor is excellent!

This was okay.  My family liked it, but I personally found the taste of the powdered sugar overwhelming.  I wouldn't call it "fudgey" at all.

I was extremely skeptical while beating the ingredients together, it looked like chocolate breadcrumbs, however, I did end up using 4 tablespoons of milk instead of 2, with 2 tablespoons it looked like chocolate dough but with 4 it was perfect creamy consistency. It's a VERY sweet frosting, I even used 3 cups instead of 3 1/2. Very good frosting.

This is SOOOOO yummy! I made my mother a cake for her 60th birthday and used tried this frosting. Despite what a few reviewers have said, it worked great for a layered cake for me. Just frost the cake while it is still warm. It does turn thicker, but it is amazing! Thanks!

Amazing, best chocolate frosting EVER.  I did make a few small changes to suit my purposes.  I used 4 tablespoons of heavy whipping cream instead of 2 tablespoons milk (for "fluffiness") and added an extra  1 1/2 Tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa.  I'll be using this recipe as my go-to chocolate frosting from now on.

I made this frosting (alongside some cream cheese vanilla frosting) to use on a yellow cake (Four Egg Yello Cake from thsi site) for my daughter's birthday decorated as Diego (from Go, Diego, Go). It had a very nice, buttery flavor. Much nicer than what you can buy premade, which always has that artificial additive taste. It also had a dark, rich chocolate color (which works well for brown hair!) But I had to add an additional 1 1/2 Tbsp. of milk to make it smooth and thin enough to spread on a cake. I also had to work quickly to frost as it seemed to want to dry out fairly quickly (at one point, I had to add a drop of milk and remix it to smooth it out again). I also made sure to alternately add the milk and powdered sugar to the chocolate mixture, and just mixed it in the pan (heat turned off). There was a moment I thought it wouldn't turn out when the frosting seemed to almost curdle, but I added more milk and mixed like crazy and it smoothed out. Oddly enough, it didn't easily stick to my cake like my cream cheese frosting did. But the flavor more than compensated for the higher difficulty of using it. I would use this again, but with the alterations I made.

I had the same problem with this frosting as most of the other reviewers - it was very tasty, but very crumbly. The my husband took over and kept slowly adding milk while blending with a hand blender until the desired consistency. It really made the cake, I think. Super tasty and buttery!

Yes, this frosting was very good. It had a fudgy - thick texture that tasted delicious with chocolate cake. My only complaints was that it was so heavy that it looked "gloppy" and made my cake fall apart, and had a bit too much of a powdered sugar taste. That being said, I would make this again and experiment with the amount of milk & sugar, because it was very tasty. My cake looked awful, but everyone loved the rich taste!

I thought it was great.  The funny thing is that I didn't finish reading the instructions that it was suppose to be cooked.  Well it didn't get cooked and it still a great recipe maybe we will try it cooked next time.

I made this to go along with Chocolate Cake II and it was absolutely fantastic. Very rich and creamy, gave me a stomach ache (but that was my fault)...heh. I added 1 1/2 tbs. brewed coffee like one of the reviews said, and I mixed it with the milk to go into the cocoa and sugar mixture. I will definitely use this recipe in the future.

This frosting was very easy to make and tastes great.  I used to make my mom's recipe that I had to beat by hand (bad childhood memories) for about 20 minutes after you cooked it to get the right consistency.  This one took maybe 10 minutes in my kitchenaid mixer.

I looked for a chocolate frosting recipe that had ingredients I had on hand, and I ran across this one.  It was awesome!

This was a great recipe.  I also did not use the full 3.5 cups of sugar I just added till right consistancy and taste.  It was very easy and I'll never buy store bought icing again!!

Thank you!  I was looking to make truffles for my husband, who's allergic to commercially-made chocolate (soy lecithin), so I needed a frosting recipe that only used cocoa.  Yours worked very well, (though I'm pretty sure I ended up adding more milk than just 2T).   This one's a keeper.

Fantastic frosting.  Works very well with a dutch black cake.  I used a high fat organic choco, for the best results

I added some cold brewed coffee in w/ the milk & it gave it a nice mocha flavor. I did as MelanieKay & nuked the butter instead of cooking it on the stovetop. I also decreased the sugar  some....be sure & beat this well or it will taste just like powdered sugar w/ some cocoa. I used this on cupcakes & also on cake-in-a-cone treats my grandsons & I made.

Too sweet for me.  I ended up adding more unsweetened cocoa and some walnuts and it tasted better to me. Good on a chocolate bundt cake.

Family and friends loved the taste, very fudgy. I thought it had sugary taste but I am not a chocolate icing type. I also found it hard to make. I used 2-3 times the amount of milk as listed and it was still hard to spread. definately not light and fluffy. Hint: Use your electric mixer!

Loved it. My boyfriend called it doughnut frosting because when it was fresh it tasted that way. The day after it was made it tasted better than the can type. I might use a runnier version of this on doughnuts and see how that turns out. For an easy doughnut recipe look under grandma's doughnuts.

Frosting wasn't to bad. Except I had trouble spreading it on my cake. But that can happen. I felt it had way to much sugar in it. However, if you like sugary frosting it would definately make the cake.
