These are great!  Note - I KNEW I had pine nuts so didn't pick up more  - came home and couldn't find them.  (Don't you hate when that happens?)  Not to be deterred I pressed one and used pecans.  Garnished with balsamic glaze, basil and quartered grape tomatoes.   Beautiful appetizer.  Thanks dimples.

Very tasty while cheese added a slightly crisp texture I did not anticipate.  Very good.
